# Chapter 523: Setting Out for the Eastern Sea

Li Yuanjiao sat in the mountains, reading the Law of Celestial Moon for a while before taking a moment to reply to Li Xizhi's letter, informing him of the situation back home.

The Li Family was preparing to head overseas, and with their current strength, capturing a Foundation Establishment Realm demon creature to be used for requesting talisman qi for Li Xizhi would not be too difficult. Li Yuanjiao had been thinking about this and decided to write to ask if they could carry out the task.

He waited for over a month, but Kongheng had not yet returned. Instead, a letter from Li Xizhi arrived first.

"...I have already broken through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and my foundation is solid. I should be able to reach the eighth heavenly layer in three to five years. After taking some pills, I will be able to touch upon the Foundation Establishment Realm. Using that qi to increase my cultivation now would be a waste. It would be better to wait until I reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, and then I will return home."

Li Yuanjiao understood Li Xizhi's point and nodded in approval. As a disciple of an immortal sect, Li Xizhi still had many spells and techniques to learn and was in no rush to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. He could even afford to delay it for a while longer. Thus, Li Yuanjiao dismissed the idea of requesting talisman qi for him and decided to wait until his son achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Reflecting on the passage of time, Li Yuanjiao suddenly realized that Li Xizhi was already thirty-five years old. He felt a moment of surprise, then realized that he himself was over fifty, though his early advancement in the Qi Cultivation Realm left him still looking like a man in his early mid-thirties.

"What a shame the repeated injuries have delayed my cultivation. Otherwise, I would have reached the edge of the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm by now..." Li Yuanjiao said as he let out a sigh.

Li Yuanjiao's talisman qi had significantly enhanced his speed of cultivation during the Qi Cultivation Realm, but since the Foundation Establishment Realm only had three stages, its effects had not manifested yet, leaving him feeling somewhat behind.

"Well... it is inevitable."

He held a pale purple jade slip in his hand when a tall, broad-shouldered man with a square face approached him. In a respectful tone, he said, "Xicheng greets the ancestor."

Li Xicheng had already reached the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He had been diligent and meticulous in his duties over the years, never making any serious mistakes.

In a gentle tone, Li Yuanjiao asked him a question, to which Li Xicheng replied, "Reporting to Ancestor, something has happened at the devil lair in the east... I had stationed people to keep watch, and although it has been quiet for the past few years, there was constant fighting early this morning. Blood was spilled and the sounds of battle echoed through the sky. The returning scouts reported that the devil lair has been destroyed."

"How many people were involved?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

Li Xicheng hesitated before replying, "Just one."

"A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator?" Li Yuanjiao frowned.

Li Xicheng replied cautiously, "It is said that the man came from the east. The devil cultivators in the lair swarmed him, but he killed nearly all of them, leaving only three or five that managed to escape."

Upon hearing this, Li Yuanjiao frowned even deeper.

"Not of the Foundation Establishment Realm..? Then he must be a Qi Cultivator..."

The devil cultivators were not fools. If they had encountered a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, they would have fled immediately rather than fight. If it had been a proper Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, there would not have been any survivors at all.

Li Xicheng nodded slightly and added, "The man wielded a golden hammer and breathed fire, fighting the devil cultivators for quite some time before scattering them. He might be a cultivator from the Eastern Sea..."

Just as he finished speaking, a purple bolt of lightning descended from the sky. Li Qinghong emerged from her seclusion, looking radiant and full of energy. Li Yuanjiao waved for Li Xicheng to leave and fell into deep thought.

Li Qinghong stopped Li Xicheng and listened closely to his report before letting him go. She then remarked, "Zhang Yun personally escorted someone and went out of his way to intimidate the nearby families, ensuring they would not interfere... It seemed he was expecting that man to show up!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded and analyzed further, saying, "Perhaps they intended to deliver some cultivation technique or dharma artifact to that person, setting up this scenario deliberately. Leaving such obvious clues was a clear ploy to pass the item into his hands. It was likely part of the Golden Feather Sect's plot... they were either targeting someone or manipulating him."

The Li Family, having become a clan, had learned over the years how to navigate the schemes of the three sects and seven gates. In the past, they were inexperienced and got caught up in the schemes, but now Li Yuanjiao could see through them immediately.
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝙤𝓿𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝙤𝓶

He sighed, contemplating, "When Maha set up their trap years ago, I am sure other clans saw our Li Family the same way... All we could do was remain silent, waiting in fear to see how things would unfold."

Li Qinghong nodded, now fully understanding. Whoever that person was, the Li Family would not dare to get involved, lest they bring ruin upon themselves. She spoke softly, "As long as there is an outcome, that is all that matters. With the devil lair dealt with and Zhang Yun gone, we can finally relax a little."

The siblings both sighed in relief. Just then, Kongheng arrived, looking travel-worn as he descended into the formation on a gust of wind. He chanted a Buddhist verse and said, "This humble monk is pleased to have fulfilled his duty."

Li Qinghong accepted the letter being handed to her, glancing briefly at the monk who delivered it. He lowered his gaze, a slight sheen of sweat on his forehead. After a few polite words, he hurriedly withdrew from the mountain.

Li Qinghong raised an eyebrow but said nothing. Beside her, Li Yuanjiao merely glanced at the letter before reading through it quickly.

It was from Kong Tingyun. Her handwriting was elegant, and her tone casual. She began the letter by launching into a tirade against Situ Mo, calling him treacherous and deceitful, devoid of honor and loyalty. She then warmly invited the Li Family to visit her, mentioning that it would be a good way to vex Situ Mo.

Her tone felt as if she were smiling while saying it, without any sense of distance. At the end of the letter, she added, "Toward the end of June, a group of disciples from the sect will head overseas. If it is convenient, Brother Yuanjiao, why not join them and offer some protection to our disciples? It will save me another trip."

Not a bad idea, Li Yuanjiao thought, nodding quietly to himself. If they could travel alongside members of Profound Peak Gate, it would be safer, especially against any potential scheming from the Buddhist cultivators.

Li Qinghong took the letter from him and, after a brief glance, smiled and said, "Kong Tingyun seems quite agreeable."

Her almond-shaped eyes briefly lingered on her brother's face. Seeing that Li Yuanjiao's expression remained unchanged as he pondered and planned, she quietly exhaled in relief, thinking to herself, Sister-In-Law's talent is slightly inferior. She's only at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Once she breaks through, I should give her a talisman pill. Although my brother and his wife share deep affection, they shouldn't be too far apart in strength...

Li Qinghong had known Xiao Guiluan for many years and had grown quite fond of her. Li Yuanjiao, being upright and impartial like his granduncle Li Tongya, had never granted Xiao Guiluan any special treatment or resources. It was only Li Qinghong who occasionally sent her some pills.

As Li Qinghong was lost in thought, Li Yuanjiao quickly noticed her distraction and asked a question. She shook her head, snapping herself out of her own thoughts. Only then did Li Yuanjiao say, "The agreed date is approaching. Let us pack up and head out together."

Li Qinghong, still holding her spear, replied, "There is nothing much for me to pack. Let us go!"

Li Yuanjiao then summoned the brothers—Li Xicheng and Li Xijun—along with Li Wushao, instructing them to manage the household carefully and avoid any rash actions.

Only after ensuring everything was in order did he and Li Qinghong, along with Kongheng, rise into the sky, riding the wind.

Fearing any potential interference from Buddhist cultivators, they traveled quickly. By dawn the next day, the Profound Peak Gate's territory in Shanji Prefecture soon came into view.
𝑓𝓇𝘦ℯ𝘸𝘦𝑏𝓃𝑜𝘷ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂

An elderly man greeted them, his appearance plain with two small moles on his face. His body, adorned with various jade pendants, clinked as he moved. He greeted them with a hearty laugh, "Kong Yu of Profound Peak Gate greets fellow Daoists!"

Years ago, when Kong Yu was invited by Li Xuanxuan to move mountains for the Li Family, he had told him about the One Stick of Incense Clan. This man could be considered a friend of Li Xuanxuan. At that time, Li Yuanjiao was in seclusion and had not met him, but Li Qinghong had.

"Greetings, Senior," she replied politely.

"Ah! Please do not call me that. You are flattering me too much!" Kong Yu smiled wryly.

When he first visited the Li Family, Li Qinghong was still in the Qi Cultivation Realm, and it had been reasonable for him to act like a senior. Now, in the blink of an eye, she had become a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and Kong Yu dared not act overly familiar, humbly declining the honor and asking, "How is Daoist Xuanxuan faring?"

"My father is in good health," Li Yuanjiao replied. After exchanging a few more pleasantries, several young disciples flew up from below, all at the Qi Cultivation Realm.

They gazed at the two of them with admiration and greeted them respectfully, "Greetings, Seniors!"

Li Qinghong, still looking youthful, was dressed in jade armor and silver boots, exuding a heroic spirit. The male disciples of Profound Peak could not help but stare, clearly both in awe and fear, making Kong Yu visibly embarrassed.

"Naturally, no one dared to look at Li Yuanjiao, whose more mature appearance gave him a villainous air. He quietly observed the group of disciples, thinking to himself, Their cultivation is even lower than Xijun's, and they don't look like disciples from a major sect... They must not be from the sect's core lineage."

After everyone had gathered, they set out swiftly, riding the current downstream, heading toward the Eastern Sea.

————

Wutu Peak.

Li Ximing slowly exhaled, and it seemed as though two bright flames flared up in his eyes, flickering and rising before turning into a golden light that gradually faded into nothingness. With a light inhale, he swallowed the Long Marching Fire Essence before him into his belly.

Two years ago, he had taken a talisman pill to break through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Afterward, he diligently cultivated, refining his strength, and now his cultivation was fully consolidated.

Li Tongya's generation lacked medicinal pills, and refining one's cultivation was a slow and painstaking process that could take three to five years. By Li Ximing's generation, however, pills were much more plentiful. Li Ximing himself had no shortage, so his progress was swift.

With a flick of his hand, he revealed a jade bottle containing an Essence Gathering Pill and thought to himself, Brother Zhi gave me this pill... but I don't really need it. It would be better to leave it for Xijun...

Li Ximing was not one to boast, but when it came to cultivation, he was brimming with confidence. His heart was set on the Dao, and he had a spirit fire from heaven and earth in his belly. Over the years, through the practice of dual cultivation and absorbing fire, he had faintly sensed that he was in alignment with this path, giving him a strong assurance of success in reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Despite his confidence, Li Ximing hesitated. Failing to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm meant the end of one's life and Dao. If it were anyone else, even with a ninety-nine percent chance of success, he would keep the matter to himself and not risk letting it slip.

But Li Xijun was not just anyone. In Li Ximing's life, there were very few things he truly cared about, and Li Xijun, the younger brother who visited him earnestly every day, was one of them. It was difficult for him to part with that bond.

Gritting his teeth, Li Ximing placed the jade bottle on the table, resisting the urge to take it. He locked the door behind him and turned to leave.

In front of him stood Meng Zhuoyun, her black hair flowing loosely, with the ends tied in a red ribbon and adorned with a small blue-gold orchid. Needing a distraction from the Essence Gathering Pill, Li Ximing pulled her into his arms.

Meng Zhuoyun pouted slightly but began to undress, almost out of habit. Li Ximing muttered under his breath while she remained passive, hesitant as though making a decision.

Suddenly, she asked, "Brother Ming, will you keep me?"

Li Ximing frowned, as though repeating himself for the hundredth or two-hundredth time, "You can handle it on your own."

Lost in his own thoughts, Li Ximing's actions were automatic. Their bodies had long since become accustomed to each other, moving naturally, yet both were distracted. Meng Zhuoyun placed her hands on his chest and suddenly spoke, "Li Ximing."

It was the first time she had called him by his full name, and he was taken aback. Softly, Meng Zhuoyun continued, "You are only relying on the Li Family... You think you are a genius? You are just living off the shadow of your forefathers, stripping away everything the Li Family has given you. What can you truly call your own? Hmm..?"

Sweat dripped down Meng Zhuoyun's graceful face as she panted softly, yet her eyes remained calm. She spoke in a quiet voice, "Even without a prestigious background, Li Yuanjiao could be a fierce general, Li Xijun could be a swordsman, and Li Xicheng could be a manager... But you? You are nothing but a coward."

Li Ximing closed his eyes, as though her words had touched a sore spot. After several breaths, he whispered, "Stop... just stop talking..."

Meng Zhuoyun pushed his hands away, exhaling deeply before saying softly, "I will be leaving."

Without hesitation, she stood up and emptied the contents of her storage pouch. Pills, secret technique manuals, paintings, and Li Ximing's clothes—all of it came tumbling down onto him.

Nearly overwhelmed by disbelief and caught completely off guard, Li Ximing watched as Meng Zhuoyun draped a robe over herself. She cast a Purification Spell on herself, then walked out of the courtyard, her black hair flowing behind her, her expression resolute.

She had barely taken a few steps forward when she saw a white-robed young man standing in the forest, blocking her path.

With sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, he held a sword in his arms. Though Meng Zhuoyun looked disheveled, her pale skin exposed, the young man respectfully averted his gaze, his expression polite.

Meng Zhuoyun shook her head gently, the blue-gold orchid in her hair glinting under the moonlight. Her soft eyes were clear and filled with defiance as she asked, "What do you want, Senior?"

Li Xijun extended his hand politely and said, "I hope you would allow me to inspect your storage pouch."

Meng Zhuoyun bowed and handed over her storage pouch. Li Xijun examined it carefully and found nothing related to his family. He apologized and returned the pouch but still did not move aside.

Left with no other option, Meng Zhuoyun cast a spell and swore a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, vowing not to disclose any of the Li Family's secrets. Still, Li Xijun did not relent, his gaze lowered in guilt as he added softly, "I have heard that you are skilled with a painter's brush?"

Though his tone remained courteous, the Hanlin sword on his back glowed ominously. Meng Zhuoyun was not foolish and immediately understood, adding a few more assurances to her vow. Only then did Li Xijun apologize, "You have made many pills for our family over the years... It is Brother Ming's fault for treating you unfairly. This is to compensate you for all the pills you have refined."

He untied a storage pouch from his waist and respectfully handed it to her. Meng Zhuoyun's face changed, a mix of shame and frustration rising within her. But seeing the genuine sincerity in Li Xijun's eyes, she knew he did not intend to humiliate her. Silently, she accepted it and whispered, "Thank you."

With that, she soared into the sky, vanishing into the distant horizon.

Li Xijun sighed and stepped into the courtyard, which remained in disarray. Li Ximing quietly fixed his attire. Li Xijun let out a bitter laugh and said, "You made a mess, yet I have to be the one to clean it up..."

Li Ximing said nothing. Hanging high in the courtyard was a painting. In it, Li Ximing wore a smile, yet his expression was cold and emotionless. His eyes were indifferent, as though lost in deep thoughts.

Irritated by the sight of it, Li Ximing waved his hand, summoning the painting. He folded it and tucked it into his robe before waving his brother out.

Turning back, he gathered the scattered paintings in the courtyard. Suddenly losing interest, he pulled out his alchemy furnace and returned to refining pills.




# Chapter 525: Mutuo

The Eastern Sea spanned thousands of li, with jagged rocks jutting out across its vast expanse. Waves surged endlessly from the boundless east, one after another, crashing upon each other. The islands scattered across the horizon were linked, their landscapes vastly different from those inland. The brilliant morning sun began to rise from the edge of the sky, casting rays of light in all directions.

It was Li Qinghong's first time venturing overseas, and she was deeply captivated by the sight. Unable to hold herself back, she asked, "Is this the end of the world... where immortals reside?"

Kong Yu stroked his beard with a smile and replied, "If you travel eastward all the way to the edge of the Eastern Sea, you will reach the Endless Void Abyss. There, the seawater reverses and falls into the abyss, descending slower and slower until it becomes vapor, rising back up and returning to the sea."

Taking a moment to recount the past, Kong Yu continued, "There is no air, no spiritual qi, nor the great void. That place is called Outer Heavens. In ancient times, cultivators and members of the demon race embarked on journeys to the Outer Heavens from the four seas, and none have ever returned."

Li Yuanjiao nodded. He had heard about this from Li Xizhi before and now asked, "If that is the case... why would anyone go there?"

Kong Yu sighed with a touch of sentiment. "When a cultivator attains the Golden Core Realm, they gain Fruition Attainment and can replace heaven's will with their own. Beyond that is the Dao Embryo, but what lies beyond the Dao Embryo? There is no path left to take...

"It is said that in the past, it was impossible to leave. The four seas were bound by a heavenly barrier. But during the immortal-devil war at Pingming Ford, the heavens lowered by three zhang, and the earth rose by nine chi. Since then, the four seas became unbound, and the practice of cultivation became unrestricted. It is said that those with Dao Embryos sense that the true path lies in the Outer Heavens, so they journey there."

Li Yuanjiao silently nodded, while Kongheng, who had been listening intently, spoke up. "So that is how the immortal sects view it... Our Buddhist sect holds a different perspective."

He had an awkward look on his face and apologized first for what he was about to say. "According to our scriptures, the battle at Pingming Ford is referred to as the Karmic Filth of Past Lives, marking the division between the previous and future incarnations of the Buddha. In the past, immortals and their laws ruled the world, with the Xia people reigning supreme. In the future life, the rise of Buddhism followed, as the Hu and Jie people replaced the Xia."[1]

Kongheng had spoken cautiously, yet the faces of the group still darkened. Kong Yu, however, seemed to reflect on it thoughtfully and remarked, "After the battle of Pingming Ford, the Wei State was destroyed, and the states of Qi, Liang, Zhou, and Yan rose and fell—all under the rule of the Hu and Jie people... Perhaps the Buddha's words were a prophecy of fate."

Kong Yu gave a wry smile and murmured softly, "Five hundred years ago, the southern immortal mansions still had dreams of reclaiming the northern lands. But after the fall of several immortal mansions, all that is left is infighting in their own small corners. The Buddha's words were not entirely wrong! Immortal law has collapsed, and what remains in the south are the paths of devils!"

The Profound Peak disciples behind them exchanged puzzled looks, and one of them asked, "Master's words do not make sense. We vanquish demons and eliminate evil, enjoying the freedom of the heavens and earth... How does that connect to devil paths?"

Kong Yu's face was filled with bitterness. He tightened his grip on the wooden staff and glanced at Li Yuanjiao before sighing. "All of you are still young... You do not understand the ways of the world yet. It is not just about vanquishing demons and eliminating evil. Take one wrong step, and you too will become a devil yourself. And as for the freedom you speak of... there is no such thing."

The disciples, some thoughtful, others defiant, remained silent. Kongheng chanted a Buddhist prayer, his face filled with compassion, as if deeply resonating with the sentiment.
𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝑐𝘰𝑚

Li Yuanjiao, observing Kongheng's demeanor, surmised that the Profound Peak Gate had likely either been coerced or willingly participated in some unsavory deeds during the devil plague. He shook his head slightly and said in a gentle voice, "Your gate has done rather well under the circumstances."

Kong Yu chuckled grimly and pointed ahead, changing the subject with a smile, "Up ahead is Splitreed Island, the first landing point of the Eastern Sea!"

The Eastern Sea was divided into five major regions. Beyond Lake Xian lay the Crimson Reef Sea, a region full of jagged rocks and home to countless islands. Looking ahead, the group saw a huge island rising in the distance.

This island was vast, covered with various pavilions and towers. Countless cultivators flew up and down, and in the distance, parts of the island were hidden within clouds and mist, its full extent unknown.

Kong Yu smiled and said, "This place is called Splitreed Island. The fire veins here are astonishingly active, surpassing even the volcanic deserts... It is one of the great wonders of the Eastern Sea."

The group was filled with awe, and the Profound Peak disciples bombarded Kong Yu with questions. The old man beamed with pride as he explained, "The island gets its name from Immortal Yingze of the Moonlight Origin Mansion. Legend has it that the immortal captured the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch here, known as Kuaili!

"This Devil Monarch had attained the Lesser Yang Fruition Attainment, becoming undying and indestructible. The immortal, unable to fully destroy him, forced him to reincarnate and start his cultivation anew. Using a white jade hairpin, the immortal divided him into three parts.

"One part was cast into a place known as Beiming, where it transformed into a woman known as the Empress Beiyao. Another part was thrown into the western Great Western Plains, becoming the Devil Lord Xiyan. The last part sank to the bottom of the Eastern Sea, where it was claimed by the Dragon Clan, now known as the Dragon Monarch Xiyang of the Eastern Sea."

Li Yuanjiao, both astonished and unsettled by what he heard, silently reflected on the culture of the Eastern Sea. Such stories would never be spoken of so openly in the Azure Pond Sect, yet here in the Eastern Sea, they were freely shared.

He could only ask, "Are all three of them Golden Core Realm cultivators?"

Kong Yu replied, "It is known that Empress Beiyao and the Dragon Monarch are both Golden Core Realm cultivators, but the one in the Great Western Plains is merely a legend..."

"If that is true... that means a single Lesser Yang Fruition Attainment was split into three Golden Cores, and all three became Golden Core Realm cultivators?"

One of the Profound Peak disciples then asked in confusion, "How is that possible?"

Kong Yu chuckled and answered, "What does a brat like you possibly understand? Back in the day, the nine offspring of the Converging Water Hornless Dragon were born from the dissolution of a single Golden Core into nine, each forming its own Golden Core... The mysteries of the Golden Core are far beyond the grasp of small cultivators like you!"

The group started chattering and discussing this. After a while, a female cultivator approached, radiating joy. She was dressed in a pale yellow-green feather robe and was riding on pink clouds. She first greeted Kong Yu as she cupped her fist, "Greetings, Clan Uncle!"

She then turned eagerly to Li Yuanjiao and said, "Brother Jiao, you are here! What a coincidence! Come with me, let's rest over there."

The group of young disciples followed Kong Yu and were led away for their training. Kong Tingyun glanced at Li Qinghong with surprise and admiration in her eyes. She then smiled and said, "So, this is Sister Qinghong... your reputation precedes you."

She exchanged a few friendly words, clearly taking a liking to Li Qinghong. The group landed at the Profound Peak Gate's station, where Kong Tingyun said, "Would you like to rest for a bit, or head quickly to the marketplace out in the deep sea? Situ Mo is treacherous and devious. If I stay away too long, something might happen..."

Li Yuanjiao and the others were just as eager to get moving, so they all agreed and flew off together. Li Yuanjiao, not wanting to miss a chance to gather more information, asked, "When Senior shared the story of Splitreed Island, he talked about Empress Beiyao and Dragon Monarch Xiyang as if they appear often... Do the Golden Core Realm True Monarchs often reveal themselves overseas?"

"They do not appear all the time, but they do show up occasionally... Overseas, we can speak more freely... They are unlike the Pristine Water True Monarch, who has not dared to show his face for over a century," Kong Tingyun answered as they traveled.

Kong Tingyun chuckled lightly and continued, "He is totally shaking in his boots! The Pristine Water Fruition Attainment is no ordinary one... Many are keeping their eyes on him."

1. Jie people were members of a tribe of northern China in the fourth century. During the period of the Sixteen Kingdoms, they were regarded by the Han people as one of the Five Barbarians.

Hu people were non-Han Chinese populations.

Xia people was the ethnicity name of Han Chinese before the rise of the Han dynasty in the 2nd century BC. ☜

Li Yuanjiao nodded thoughtfully, and his once terrifying impression of Pristine Water True Monarch faded significantly. The invincible aura surrounding him seemed to diminish, and he remarked quietly, "The Eastern Sea is truly a different world."

As they flew, Kong Tingyun reminded them, "There are a few powers in the Eastern Sea that you cannot provoke, and I am sure you are aware of them, but I will still mention them again."

After ascertaining that Li Yuanjiao was listening intently, Kong Tingyun began, "The first is the Dragon Clan... In the four seas, the Eastern Sea's Dragon Clan is the most powerful, a top-tier force. The Dragon species are also fiercely protective of their own. As long as it is a True Dragon, you must not offend even a single one."

Everyone nodded in understanding as Kong Tingyun continued, "Next are the various demonic entities—sometimes called Immortals, sometimes Ghost Officials—or even strange, unnatural beings formed from combinations of metallic essences, fate, and ill omens."

She shook her head and added, "There is not much you can do when you encounter one. Even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators avoid some of them, while others might only make you sneeze."

"In the mainland, there are emissaries of death who monitor these things so you rarely see them, but overseas, it is a different story. The Eastern Sea is vast and boundless, hiding countless unknowns..."

She paused before continuing, "As for the other factions, there has never been a day without bloodshed. In the end, it is all for their interests."

Kong Tingyun waited for a moment before leading them to the water. After calculating the time, she said softly, "The Eastern Sea is too vast. Just flying would take us forever. It is better to rely on the water veins, which not only save us mana but are also much faster."

Li Qinghong glanced around and noticed several others nearby, warily watching each other as they waited. Kong Tingyun whispered, "In just a few breaths, the water veins of the sea will surge. When the water rushes in, we will use the Water Command Technique to ride the current to the Scarlet Pristine Sea, where my family's marketplace is located."

Just as she finished speaking, the surrounding waters began to tremble and rush eastward. Large and small bubbles rose, and the ground beneath them shook violently as lightning flashed across the darkened sky.

Li Yuanjiao, having traveled the Eastern Sea for over a year, was well-versed in its ways. He calmly said, "My immortal foundation is Boundless Ocean... Let me handle the water control."

With that, a serpent dragon formed under his feet, coiling in the sea and transforming into a bluish-gray light ring that enveloped everyone, swiftly carrying them eastward with the surging current.

————

Scarlet Pristine Sea, Golden Sack Island.

There were several islands in the Scarlet Pristine Sea, and Golden Sack Island was a medium-sized one. The Golden Tang Gate had established a firm presence here, reinforcing it with great effort.

Situ Mo, dressed in gold, sat sternly at the head of the hall, his face dark. Below him, a man kneeled on the ground, trembling as he reported, "My lord... the crab has come to demand another thousand people... he says he will return in three days."

Situ Mo's expression grew darker, and he replied in a low voice, "I see."

Although the Golden Tang Gate was an immortal gate, it still had to abide by the rules of the Eastern Sea. What was due had to be paid. The crab was merely at the Qi Cultivation Realm, but it had a serpent dragon backing it. As much as Situ Mo resented it, he had no choice but to swallow his anger.

His foul mood was not just because of this; the records on the table also vexed him. As the sole direct descendant on this island, he had secretly obtained these sect records and had been reviewing the events from years ago.

"In the sixth lunar month, the Yu Family joined the gate, and Wan Huaqian became famous in the prefecture for his formation techniques... The Yu Family then ambushed and killed members of the Wan Family, framing the Ji Family... The Wan Family retaliated by attacking Mount Hua, and the Xiao Family sent a warning to the Yu Family... slaughter ensued... and the prefecture was besieged..."

Throughout the destruction of the Ji Family, the real forces behind the scenes were the Yu and Xiao families, along with the broader power struggles between the Azure Pond and Golden Tang. In hindsight, it was clear that Li Tongya was merely a pawn in Xiao Chuting's larger scheme.

"Xiao Chuting manipulated the situation brilliantly, weakening both the Jiang and Yu families and almost subjugating the entire eastern shore, while propping up the Li Family as a loyal supporter... truly masterful."

Situ Mo silently acknowledged the cunningness of Xiao Chuting but knew that he lacked the strength to confront the Xiao Family for now. He filed away his grudges, awaiting a day when he could settle the score.

But Xiao Chuting is a formidable opponent... I must continue to feign ignorance for now, lest I end up caught in Man On Creek's schemes. As he pondered, he suddenly realized that there had been no news from Kong Tingyun for quite some time. This raised alarm bells in his mind.

That woman is never quiet for long. Could she be scheming something?

He quickly ordered, "Go fetch Master Monk Mutuo!"

Watching his subordinate leave, Situ Mo felt a chill of unease run down his spine. Not long ago, he had considered getting rid of her to reclaim control, but after probing her twice and suffering minor setbacks, he had to admit he had underestimated her.

Damn it... It is easy to fool the idiots in the sect, but once outside, none of them are simple... Situ Mo silently fumed.

Li Yuanjiao had been difficult enough, and even that monk seemed like no pushover. Kong Tingyun was sly, and even Li Xijun was quick-witted. Inside the Golden Tang Gate, he could fool his seniors and juniors, but outside, he had suffered one setback after another. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, cursing aloud, "No wonder the Golden Tang Gate is declining... It is full of idiots!"

As he was in the middle of cursing, a burly, bald man barged into the hall, his face red with irritation. He growled, "What now?"

Seeing him, Situ Mo's temper flared even more. He shouted, "You filthy monk! All you do is chase after skirts! Are you even keeping an eye on Kong Tingyun?!"

Mutuo shot him a sideways glance and muttered a mantra under his breath while retorting, "What do you know?! In the Great Zhao, as long as you are a monk, even princesses get on their knees and let you do what you want with them. But here in the south, at least they still know how to cry and run..."

Situ Mo's face darkened further, but he restrained his disgust. Then, suddenly, Mutuo's expression changed. He hesitated before asking tentatively, "She is not on the island..?"

Situ Mo had anticipated this, and his face remained unchanged. Mutuo hastily resumed divining, his face paling as he poured more energy into his divination. After a while, he finally muttered, "She is not in the Scarlet Pristine Sea!"

Situ Mo's face showed a slight shift, his mind racing. Several names flashed through his thoughts, and then a moment of realization struck him. He hesitated, then said, "I heard Splitreed Island was attacked by some kind of demon creatures recently, with many casualties, right?"

Mutuo blinked, realization dawning on him.

"You are saying... Kong Tingyun went to pick up disciples from the sect?"

Situ Mo nodded hesitantly. Mutuo quickly exclaimed, "This is a perfect opportunity! We may not be able to break through the island's great formation, but we could ambush her on the sea route! Let us both go—when we get close enough, I will do the divination again!"

Situ Mo immediately flew into action, rising into the air with Mutuo by his side. As they neared the coast, doubt crept into his mind.

That woman knows I have a Buddhist cultivator here—why would she make such a mistake? Sect disciples... Does Profound Peak Gate not have other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to send? This is too convenient...

Suddenly, a thought struck him, and he almost shouted, "Quick, check where Li Yuanjiao is!"

Mutuo blinked in confusion.

"Did we not agree we would not go after the Li Family for another ten years?"

"Just do it!" Situ Mo snapped.

Mutuo's face twisted with frustration. "I am not even in the Yue State! How am I supposed to do that now? We are already close to the sea route... Why not just focus on Kong Tingyun?!"

Situ Mo gritted his teeth but relented, fixing his gaze on the approaching water surge. He growled, "Fine, but first check if Li Yuanjiao is in the Eastern Sea! Start with him!"




# Chapter 527: Suppression and Injury

"That damned bastard!" Mutuo spat, his frustration boiling over. Despite his anger, he could not overpower his opponent. He activated his golden light and performed a series of hand seals. The red glow on his face dimmed momentarily.

After a while, he finally got a result and said impatiently, "I can't deduce his whereabouts. How can he be in the Eastern Sea?!"

His crimson face contorted in anger as drops of blood trickled from his nostrils. Wiping it away with his hand, he gritted his teeth.

"Your paranoia has cost me... You better make it up to me when we get back!"

However, Situ Mo had fallen into deep thought, ignoring him. A whirlwind of doubts filled his mind.

How could this be possible? Could Kong Tingyun really have let her guard down? There are only one or two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators left in the Profound Peak Gate... Logically, she should be able to escape safely. She must have more than one Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator aiding her...

Mutuo called out to him three times before Situ Mo finally snapped back to reality. He murmured, "Mutuo, this may be a trap. You and I should retreat a hundred li for now and wait for an opportunity. It'll be safer to stay close to Golden Sack Island. If anything goes wrong, we can get away in time."

"Y-Y-You...! That's not far from Yuezhou Island! Kong Tingyun can escape easily! What are you thinking?!" Mutuo scolded in disbelief.

Seeing the determination on Situ Mo's face, Mutuo had no choice but to express his frustration.

"All of you from the southern immortal dao are damn cowards; so paranoid all the time..."

The Li Family members rode the current all the way to the Scarlet Pristine Sea before coming to a gradual stop. They broke through the water's surface, and Li Yuanjiao deactivated his spell, gazing into the distance.

The sea here had gradually turned pale turquoise, its seabed covered in deep red reefs rich in iron. From above, it appeared a vibrant tapestry of turquoise and red, earning it its name Scarlet Pristine Sea.

Kong Tingyun admired the magnificent scenery before explaining, "Two thousand years ago, this sea was known as Qunyi. Later, the eighth son of the Converging Water True Hornless Dragon was captured here. The dragon clan punished him for matricide by binding him to a deep cliff at the bottom of the sea. They built nine cold iron pillars, nailed him to the cliff, dismembered him, and let the demons devour his remains. As a result, the sea turned turquoise overnight, and the demons within it gradually transformed, becoming what they are today."

She smiled softly and continued, "The True Hornless Dragon had nine sons—six of converging and three of pristine. Now, only two remain in the world; the rest have perished."

Kong Tingyun paused, then added softly, "Some say that the dragon clan did this to scatter the Pristine Water Metallic Essence throughout the Scarlet Pristine Sea, making it difficult to gather them."

Li Yuanjiao pondered for a moment before asking, "Why doesn't the dragon clan simply keep it for themselves to create a Golden Core...?"

Kong Tingyun stepped on a cloud and quietly replied, "The True Hornless Dragon swallowed the Pristine Water Feathered Serpent and died... The enmity between them remains unresolved. To this day, dragons still devour feathered serpents, and the eighth son is one such feathered serpent!"

"The Daoist Master of my family speculated that perhaps the dragons fear that if they consume the Pristine Water Metallic Essence, they will soon grow feathers and turn into their enemy!" she added.

"Horrible..." Kongheng murmured a Buddhist chant before continuing in a low voice, "Feathered serpents and dragon species share the same origins; the only difference is that one is of Pristine Water and the other of Converging Water. It's truly a sin that they're killing each other like this..."

Li Yuanjiao looked thoughtful as he began to grasp the concept of the Golden Core.

Golden Core Realm cultivators... Are they those who obtained Metallic Essence... or are they those who achieved Fruition Attainment...?

Kong Tingyun's voice interrupted his thoughts as she said seriously, "I have something to trouble fellow Daoists with."

"Situ Mo is cunning, and he has a Master Monk from Zhao State as his assistant. I will be gone for several months; he will undoubtedly learn of this and likely ambush me on my way back. Please keep your distance and conceal your presence..." she explained.

Li Yuanjiao immediately caught on and smiled inwardly.

So there's indeed a Buddhist cultivator supporting him!

Realizing that the threat was only a Buddhist cultivator rather than a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Li Yuanjiao felt much more at ease. He immediately replied, "I have a dharma artifact that can conceal presence. Perhaps Kongheng and my younger sister should keep their distance while I stay beside you? At least it'll be easier for both of us to prevent them from escaping."

"All right!" Kong Tingyun nodded approvingly.

Li Yuanjiao activated the Profound Patterned Bottle, and a mysterious spiritual mist enveloped his body. He flew forward with Kong Tingyun, leaving Kongheng and Li Qinghong behind.

Kongheng felt slightly awkward being alone with her. He lowered his head and began chanting a Buddhist scripture, but Li Qinghong ignored him, her gaze fixed on the endless turquoise and red sea as a thought crossed her mind.

It would be wonderful if Father could see such magnificent scenery.

————

Li Yuanjiao and Kong Tingyun rode the wind together. Kong Tingyun remained silent, but she sensed that Li Yuanjiao was close by, flying leisurely alongside her. As they journeyed deeper into the Scarlet Pristine Sea, doubts began to creep in.

That guy is cautious. If fear the further we go, it'll be more difficult to defeat him.

While she was lost in thought, several golden lights emerged from the reefs beneath them, and a golden streak suddenly shot up from the sea. Situ Mo broke through the water, squinting slightly as he fixed his gaze on Kong Tingyun.

The sea was vast, its water veins flowing seamlessly, with no solid ground to plant formation flags or harness spiritual energy. Few formations could be established in such an environment, and even if Situ Mo possessed a treasure formation, he had yet to set it up.

Kong Tingyun feigned surprise before sarcastically saying, "We are very close to the two islands right now! Do you think the guest cultivators on my island are all blind?"

The sea was vast and both of them were direct descendants of immortal gates. Naturally, they were unwilling to grant each other the opportunity to use escape spells. The fierce battle would likely only end with one of them dead, eliminating the need for a large formation. Nevertheless, Kong Tingyun was fearless, given their proximity to the two islands.

Situ Mo stared at her for a moment, as if trying to discern something, before saying, "Fellow Daoist... you are quite brave. I don't need to kill you; I only need to severely injure you..."

While Situ Mo distracted her with his words, he discreetly performed a series of hand seals. As he completed the six seals, he hooked his index fingers while keeping the other three fingers together, summoning a golden saber that came out from his palm.

It's that spell!

Li Yuanjiao recalled his past encounter with it and silently put his hand on the hilt of his sword.

Suddenly, the sea below them erupted once more, and a burly monk with a clean-shaven head and a red complexion soared out, brandishing a staff with both hands and preparing to strike at Kong Tingyun.

Kong Tingyun remained calm, slapping her storage pouch. A golden mountain emerged, flying toward the monk to suppress him. The monk sneered fearlessly as he attempted to catch it with his hands.

However, when Mutuo's hands made contact with the golden mountain, his tongue unexpectedly went numb, and only four of his facial features remained—his lips had vanished, leaving a smooth space below his philtrum. Horror washed over him as Kong Tingyun sneered coldly.

"This golden mountain has been waiting for you, monk!"

With that, she produced another jade pearl that shone brightly, directing its light at the golden saber. Situ Mo's spell suddenly faltered as his golden saber hummed and vibrated uncontrollably like a dragonfly that had its tail pinched.

Kong Tingyun remarked casually, "I would love to see how you plan to seriously injure me."

This was the first time Situ Mo confronted her head-on, and he felt an impending headache.

I've heard that the Profound Peak Gate is filled with iron turtles... It seems like it's true—they excel at defense. Kong Tingyun holds an extraordinary status, and her dharma artifacts are more powerful than others. This will be a tough battle!

Sure enough, Kong Tingyun swung her sleeves, unleashing a pair of black hooks that flew toward him like crescent moons, circling and dancing as they hissed with turquoise smoke.

Situ Mo glanced at the hooks and recognized them as ordinary dharma artifacts. He summoned three golden shields and easily blocked the attack.

Meanwhile, the golden saber spell on the other side broke through the protective barrier of the jade pearl, its speed increasing as it darted forward.

Kong Tingyun appeared to be in danger, yet she showed no fear, which secretly shocked Situ Mo.

At that moment, two streams of light appeared in the distance—one purple and one brown. Situ Mo's expression shifted, and golden light flared beneath his feet. However, a chill suddenly crept down his spine. With a sweep of his spiritual sense, he detected a green-white sword light approaching.

Li Yuanjiao! They've really joined forces!

He broke out in a cold sweat, unable to determine how Li Yuanjiao had managed to evade the Buddhist cultivator's detection. With the golden shield resisting Kong Tingyun's dharma artifact, he had no choice but to quickly perform a hand seal and cast a spell, darting out of the impending attack's way, albeit narrowly.

CLANG!

Qingche's sword light sliced through the air, grazing his feathered robe instead of his neck and producing a piercing sound of mana being consumed. Situ Mo's face paled as he coughed up a smooth, round red pill.

The pill spun in the air before dissolving into smoke.

Not this trick again!

It must be some sort of displacement technique, specifically designed to counter sword and mana light.

Just as Situ Mo evaded the attack, he shouted hastily, "Retreat quickly!"

Li Yuanjiao's sword did not wait for him. It split into three sword lights as it turned back, attacking him from above, the middle, and below. Situ Mo, having suffered a setback earlier, was well prepared. Demonstrating the confidence of an immortal sect disciple, he threw out three talismans with a flick of his hand, each bouncing off into three white circles to intercept the sword lights one by one.

Clearly, Situ Mo had come prepared. The white circles released by these three Foundation Establishment Realm talismans were smooth and agile. Though their strength was not great, they were designed to effectively counter Threefold Moonlight.

With this delay, Li Qinghong and Kongheng finally arrived on the scene. Although Situ Mo did not recognize the heroic-looking female cultivator, he identified Kongheng and guessed that she was Li Qinghong. The purple light in her eyes and the purple lightning dancing across her jade armor caught his attention.

Situ Mo barely had time to retreat before Li Qinghong parted her vermillion lips slightly and released a speck of purple light that almost instantly swelled to the size of a fist, glowing with a brilliant white light.

A sense of numbness washed over Situ Mo as he realized the power of the impending attack. He quickly deactivated his three golden shields, ignoring the double hooks that Kong Tingyun had launched. He also swiftly withdrew the golden saber and disengaged with her.

Kong Tingyun hurriedly urged the jade pearl to give chase. The monk below watched on in shock and terror, bewildered by how Li Yuanjiao managed to evade his calculation. Unable to voice his confusion, he could only muster his strength to try and push the golden mountain off of him.

Kong Tingyun had to lower her head and look at the situation below her as she retrieved a golden talisman from her sleeve. With a simple flick of her fingers, she sent it flying toward the golden mountain.

Mutuo was unfortunate; despite having an arsenal of spells and techniques, he had been suppressed by the golden mountain from the start. Crafted from an unknown material, the mountain had slowed him down, also causing his lips and teeth to disappear. Just as he finally managed to push it up a little, Kong Tingyun's talisman landed on the mountain.

The talisman shimmered with golden light, its yellow-brown surface adorned with vermilion characters in one large line that read—1,006,580,000 jin.

Mutuo felt a powerful force emanating from his hand. He had only time to let out a mournful cry as the light turquoise waters around him parted. The golden mountain fell, rumbling ominously, causing the waves to surge to heights of a hundred chi before slowly settling down again.

Boom!

The spectacle in the sky was equally breathtaking. A white light erupted from above, accompanied by the roar of thunder that was like a landslide. The white lightning transformed into dense purple bolts that cascaded down like a waterfall, suppressing all that was below.

Situ Mo's golden shields were on their way back to assist him, but they were intercepted by Li Yuanjiao's swift sword. To his dismay, his golden saber was also stalled by Kongheng's spell. A golden light silently bloomed on his chest.

Rumble!

Amidst the raging thunder, Situ Mo was propelled backward, enveloped in golden light and dust, leaving only a thin layer of golden shield around him, almost resembling an eggshell.

Riding the wind, he noticed five or six streams of light approaching from the two islands, preparing for confrontation.

Situ Mo's golden shield did not reach him in time, so he was struck by the thunder spell. His feathered robe was scorched gray, and his chest was bloody. Several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators behind him caught him. Gasping, he commanded, "Let's go!"

Situ Mo silently thanked himself for being cautious, though he feared that more people would soon emerge from the market and annihilate his group. He did not dare linger and hurriedly retreated, enveloped in golden light.

His companions quickly followed suit without hesitation, fearful of being pursued. The guest cultivators of Profound Peak Gate approached to greet Kong Tingyun.

"Good... good! He wasted his life-saving trump card and is quite seriously injured; this trip wasn't in vain!" she remarked with a smile.

She glanced at Li Qinghong, who appeared slightly pale, and praised, "I didn't expect you to possess such a powerful thunder spell... Truly impressive!"

Although the profound thunder had been condensed in advance in the thunder pool, it was still a draining spell for Li Qinghong to cast. She smiled modestly and replied softly, "It's nothing compared to fellow Daoist's golden mountain."

Situ Mo was a direct disciple highly valued by the Golden Tang Gate, making it unlikely to kill him so easily in one fell swoop. With the right combination of timing and circumstances, this encounter was enough to prevent him from making any progress for many years to come.

Li Yuanjiao nodded approvingly but was more concerned about the monk and asked, "What about the monk?"

Kong Tingyun replied with a shrug, "He is no better off than Situ Mo."

The group dove deeper, navigating through the pale turquoise waters until they discovered the golden mountain resting on the seabed. Kong Tingyun stowed away the dharma artifact and examined the bloody remnants with care. After casting a few spells, she glanced at Kongheng with some uncertainty.

Kongheng understood her concern. He stepped forward, closed his eyes to sense the surroundings, and said in a deep voice, "He went back to the north."

Kong Tingyun sighed regretfully.

"It's a pity he was in the sea, not on land. He touched the earth vein too late, and managed to escape."

"He had indeed escaped but his body is ruined. He may have a backup at a temple in the north, perhaps another monk's body to take over, but his cultivation has pretty much been devastated. He won't be able to compare to Situ Mo any longer; it will take him at least decades to recover."

Buddhist cultivators were notoriously difficult to kill, and Kong Tingyun never truly believed she could eliminate him. She extended her slender hand, summoning the golden mountain.

With a hint of resentment, she said, "The ancestor entrusted me with this dharma artifact and talisman specifically to deal with these cultivators from Zhao State... He's just the first! Sooner or later, they will be driven back to their original forms, one by one!"

Li Yuanjiao breathed a sigh of relief, feeling his spirits lifting as he said, "Good, good! With this monk gone, we no longer need to worry about the enemy lurking in the shadows while we're out in the open. The threat from Situ Mo is significantly reduced!"

Kongheng, who had contributed little throughout the encounter, looked guilty. He rubbed his bald head nervously, silently glancing at the others.




# Chapter 529: Zongquan Island

Although Situ Mo had only sustained injuries, the fortunate news was that the monk could no longer stir up trouble.

Li Yuanjiao declined Kong Tingyun's invitation. The group did not linger on Yuezhou Island; they headed straight north across the Scarlet Pristine Sea.

Kong Tingyun escorted them all the way out of her territory before returning on the clouds. In high spirits, she hummed a few tunes. When she saw her subordinates approaching respectfully, she quickly recomposed herself.

It seemed like Mutuo had failed to deduce Brother Jiao's strength! The Li Family is certainly impressive... Did Xiao Chuting secretly involve himself in this, or was it another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind this? Li Yuanjiao's fate remains a mystery; I wonder if he's like Liu Changdie and Tu Longjian...

In any case, Kong Tingyun had made a good move. Not only had she suppressed the enemy, but she had also solidified her relationship with the Li Family, killing two birds with one stone. Riding the wind back to Yuezhou Island, she was looking forward to a good night's sleep.

Meanwhile, the Li Family flew toward their destination. Li Qinghong appeared relaxed, but Li Yuanjiao's expression darkened as they left the Kong Family's territory. His brows knitted together in suspicion.

Noticing her brother's unease, Li Qinghong whispered, "What's wrong, Brother?"

Li Yuanjiao tightened his grip on his sword and replied in a deep voice, "Something's off about Kong Tingyun's strength... When I ambushed the Hooked Serpent with her in Lake Xian, she was far less powerful than she is today. If she had such strength then, a mere demon like the Hooked Serpent—even at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm—wouldn't have stood a chance against her golden mountain. Why would she require my assistance and share the spoils?"

Li Qinghong considered this for a moment before nodding in agreement.

"I'm thinking that it might be the effect of that talisman. She uses it without any hesitation, so it's clearly not a rare item for her. Her identity may be more significant than we realize."

Li Yuanjiao ran his fingers along his sword, murmuring, "Indeed. I believe Daoist Master Changxi is trying to show goodwill. Kong Tingyun may be his junior; but she was quite generous in lending the formation against the Hooked Serpent, only coming to take it back after two years... I thought it was just a coincidence at the time, but now there's finally an explanation."

"It's not necessarily a bad thing after all," Li Qinghong commented.

Whether Daoist Master Changxi was showing goodwill toward Xiao Chuting or toward himself, there was no malice present, and the Li Family could only accept it silently.

It's confirmed that as long as one possesses the immortal mirror, they can not only break their fate but also thwart divine abilities and investigations... I wonder how high its inherent rank is.

Li Yuanjiao reflected, then glanced at his younger sister, who was also deep in thought, evidently considering the same matters. Kongheng hung his head in silence the entire time.

After flying over the sea for a while, Li Yuanjiao took out the sea chart to study it carefully.

The largest island in the Eastern Sea was as vast as Yue State. There were also numerous gates and powerful demons in Yinzhou in the east. The Li Family did not plan to venture there; instead, they aimed to find a remote island to the south.

Li Yuanjiao surveyed the area for a moment before summoning an Embryonic Breathing Realm fish demon with his immortal foundation. As it gurgled and released bubbles, he turned back to the group and said, "There's a water vein flowing south not far from here; we can take that route."

The group followed the water vein and, after three days, broke through the surface of the sea, reaching the southernmost end of the Scarlet Pristine Sea where it connected to the coast of the Great Xiukui Temple. The sky was overcast, and distant thunder rumbled ominously.

Li Yuanjiao looked up to see the mountain gate of the Great Xiukui Temple to the west which was shrouded in black rain, with faint thunder-like sounds echoing in the air.

"Someone is either breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, or a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator has perished!" he remarked.

"Jun'er is at home. If someone truly breaks through the Purple Mansion Realm, he will send someone to offer congratulatory gifts. There's no need to worry," Li Qinghong replied.

It was the first time the group had witnessed such a vast celestial phenomenon, visible even across the Eastern Sea. Li Yuanjiao stared at it for a bit longer before returning his attention to the sea chart in his hand.

After a long pause, he said, "In this area, we're far away from the disputed seas, at the corner of the Scarlet Pristine Sea. While it may be distant, it's safe due to the sparse population."

After discussing for a while, the group dispersed to search for suitable islands to settle on. Li Yuanjiao headed straight south, scanning the surroundings. He found several small islands; the largest was only the size of a town, while the smallest measured about ten li in radius.

Though the earth vein could be activated to expand the island gradually, there were no experts like those in the Profound Peak Gate, and bringing someone over would be quite troublesome. As a result, Li Yuanjiao felt little inclination to pursue that option.

After flying for a considerable distance, a small island soon came into view. It appeared relatively flat and was covered by only a mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm formation.

Estimating that the island was about half the size of the Li Family's estate, he landed on it and knocked on the ground tentatively.

————

Zong Yan rode the wind and toured the island before returning to the hall where his subordinates brought forth a boy.

"Island Master, this is the boy born on the night of Kuiyin, as recorded on the island," they said respectfully.

Zong Yan lifted the boy's clothes to confirm that he indeed had a belly button. He then took out two vials of blood qi from his storage pouch and said kindly, "You will live in the side hall from now on. Make sure you remember to take this medicine every three days. Do not forget about it."

The boy nodded obediently, and Zong Yan dismissed him.

Visibly relaxed, he smiled as he remarked, "Fortunately, I've registered every single one of them back then; otherwise, I wouldn't know how long it would take me to search for them on such short notice."

"My lord is wise," his subordinates replied, cupping his fist.

"After dealing with that bluefish, the rest will be much easier to handle," he added.

Zong Yan nodded repeatedly but was suddenly interrupted by a man scrambling into the hall. His eyes were red and choked with emotion as he wailed, "My lord! My lord! There is another Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator outside! He looks sinister! Something bad is going to happen!"

Zong Yan's face turned pale instantly, and he staggered backward. After a moment, he stepped forward, muttering, "Why is another one here? This is bad... I wonder how many people this one will take."

Pale and anxious, he hurried out to meet the newcomer. He deactivated the formation and looked up, spotting a figure hovering in the air.

The man indeed looked rather sinister, with gray eyes under eyebrows that were too close together. His eyes were slightly narrowed, resembling those of a serpent dragon. His black robe fluttered in the wind, and a tightly wrapped sword hung at his waist, concealing its shape.

Zong Yan steeled himself and stepped forward, bowing as deeply as he could as he said humbly, "Zong Yan greets the Exalted Immortal. We are quite terrified that you have come to our island..."

Li Yuanjiao glanced at him, noting that the man was only at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. The mortals on the island looked up at him, and he estimated that there were over five thousand people present, which satisfied him greatly.

It is truly troublesome to move mortals here. There aren't many places to settle in this vast ocean... Five thousand people here is just right.

Zong Yan felt relieved to see that he was in good spirits. But when Li Yuanjiao observed the gathered mortals, Zong Yan grew nervous again.

He seems like one that cultivates the immortal foundation Realm. He has no injuries and doesn't seem to be looking for people. Hopefully, he won't demand for too many...

As Li Yuanjiao landed on the island's peak, all the mortals paused in their activities, looking up with concern. Zong Yan spoke tentatively, "My lord, this is Zongquan Island, and I serve Dingyuan the Dragon Son under the jurisdiction of Water Mansion."

Every island in the Eastern Sea was required to pay tribute to the demon clans. Having heard of these rules, Li Yuanjiao asked casually, "How much tribute does this Dragon Son demand at a time?"

Zong Yan replied, puzzled, "Three hundred mortals or three medicine-humans."

Li Yuanjiao frowned and asked, "He wants only humans?"

Zong Yan was taken aback and suddenly realized, Could this person be from the mainland? It seems he has only ventured overseas a few times and is unaware of the situation here...

With this thought, Zong Yan's eyes grew eager, and he quickly explained, "Senior, you may not know this, but there are no minerals and spirit plants on my island. Everything below the sea surface belongs to the demon clan, and we aren't allowed to touch it. The only thing we can offer is our population..."

He continued, "Not just my small island; even those guarded by Foundation Establishment Realm and the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators must pay both tributes in the form of humans and treasures to the dragon clan. The difference is merely in the quantity..."

Li Yuanjiao, arriving in this remote place, had not considered exploiting any ore veins or treasures. He simply nodded, feeling embarrassed and silent. Zong Yan interpreted his silence as a sign he had said something wrong, and a sense of dread washed over him.

"The mainland seems to differentiate between immortals and devils! Aren't there ancient cultivators too? What are they called again? Yue Cultivating... or was it Subjects of Wanyu..."

His doubt, combined with the aura radiating from Li Yuanjiao, caused Zong Yan to lose his composure. He kneeled down in fear, his voice trembling as he pleaded, "Exalted Immortal, spare me! We are forced into this, and we never intended to do so!"

Li Yuanjiao merely glanced at him. This man was not a disciple of the immortal sect or gate, and the murky qi surrounding him was impossible to hide.

Nonetheless, he held no expectations for overseas cultivators and responded in a deep, measured voice, "You have no choice but to pay tribute to the dragon clan. However, I can see your true essence is vigorous and powerful, indicating you have consumed blood and resentment qi. What more can you say?"

Zong Yan paused for a moment, stunned, then pressed his forehead to the ground and humbly replied, "My elders also came from the orthodox path... I understand, but—"

"But..."

He paused, raised his head, and looked at the people behind Li Yuanjiao before continuing sadly, "If I consume blood qi, I will deviate from the orthodox path forever... But if I stop taking it, I won't be able to protect them. There are many demons in the sea, Zong Yan has been doing his best."

Li Yuanjiao regarded him thoughtfully and said softly, "There is no orthodox path in these times. Get up."

Zong Yan responded respectfully and stood by his side. Li Yuanjiao then looked up at the kneeling crowd. One or two children timidly raised their heads, their eyes filled with fear.

Li Yuanjiao reflected, It is inevitable to pay tribute to the Dragon Son on this island... If we want to establish a foothold in the Eastern Sea, we must first appease the dragon clan... But what should I do?

The laws of his own clan were strict regarding this matter, and the immortal mirror in his arms still emitted a slight chill, sending a cold shiver through his heart. The Supreme Yin Profound Light had not failed him so far, and this was no laughing matter.

I'll call Qinghong over first.

Li Yuanjiao launched a talisman high into the sky that glowed faintly. Zong Yan flinched at the sight. Turning to Zong Yan, Li Yuanjiao asked, "Do you have any family or offspring?"

Zong Yan, having already surmised much, remembered hearing about mainland cultivators settling overseas. However, it was rare to encounter them in his remote location. Noticing that Li Yuanjiao was not as fierce as he first appeared and seemed to have some principles, he felt a surge of relief and quickly replied, "I am a Son of Diyang, I cannot bear children."

"A Son of Diyang?" Li Yuanjiao frowned.

Zong Yan grew more confident in his assessment and explained respectfully, "The Scarlet Pristine Sea extends eastward, crossing the Qunyi Gorge. There's an island called Shiqi, where a state named Diyang exists. The springs in Diyang are known as Nurturing Springs. As long as you throw spirit items into them, babies will emerge."[1]

He lifted the hem of his robe, revealing a smooth abdomen devoid of a belly button.

"These babies are known as "Sons of Diyang", born without belly buttons and infertile. Their flesh tastes bland, like water, and as long as the spirit item thrown is precious enough, they are likely to possess a spiritual orifice."

He chuckled, adding, "Cultivating the Dao is challenging, and many cultivators end up without descendants. Unable to produce heirs, many go there for the sake of continuing their lineage. My father was one of them. He passed away many years ago, and I now manage this island."

Li Yuanjiao found this information eye-opening. He regarded Zong Yan silently, who then lowered his head and said, "But people like me are not destined for greatness. Qi Cultivation Realm is the furthest I can reach. If I cultivate the Dao, I can't establish an immortal foundation. If I cultivate Buddhism, I can't obtain the dharma. If I cultivate the devil Dao, I can't establish my own mansion. If I cultivate spells, I can't create talismans..."

After hearing this, Li Yuanjiao found these limitations to be reasonable. Nevertheless, he was still amazed.

"This world is indeed a place of great wonder..." he said quietly.

————

On Mount Qingdu...

Li Xijun sat in the courtyard, dressed in a white robe, with Hanlin resting on his knees. The thin sword gleamed coldly in the light as he wiped it meticulously with a piece of white silk cloth.

Despite his focus, he was actually polishing the blade absent-mindedly until it shone brightly. On the table before him lay a jade bottle containing the Essence Gathering Pill.

Li Ximing had reluctantly handed him the pill before retreating into seclusion to meditate in preparation for establishing his foundation, leaving Li Xijun in charge of the household. Since the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators were away, he now held the highest authority among those present.

While he continued to wipe the sword absentmindedly, an old man in plain clothes approached. The man was at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He cupped his fist and bent down slightly, preparing to kneel.

Li Xijun quickly urged him to rise and said politely, "What are you doing, Clan Elder? I can't possibly accept such a gesture from a senior."

The old man was Chen Donghe, one of the most senior members of their family. As Li Xijun moved to assist him, Chen Donghe straightened up and said softly, "I received news that Daoist Houfu of the Great Xiukui Temple has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm and attained mastery of a divine ability. The Family Head wants me to deliver a gift, so I came up to the mountain to retrieve it."

Li Xijun was just thinking about this matter. Since the Great Xiukui Temple had no connections with his family, there was no need to send an expensive gift. However, he had heard that Daoist Houfu cared about nothing else except for his image. He feared that choosing the wrong gift could lead to offense, and was troubled.

Now that Chen Donghe was here, he decided to ask for his counsel.

"What kind of gift do you think we should prepare, Elder?" he asked.

Chen Donghe pondered for a moment before responding hoarsely, "Our family gifted Daoist Master Chuting a treasured panacea, so this time, we cannot offer anything less than that. In my humble opinion, a dharma artifact of peak Qi Cultivation Realm should suffice."

"Daoist Master Houfu is well-off and probably doesn't need any lavish gifts from our family. But since he is young and is rumored to care a lot about his reputation, we should send our oldest Family Head along with six Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators to present the gift. Showing enough respect with our gesture is most important; the gift itself is not as important," he explained.

After a moment of consideration, Li Xijun remarked, "This matter has spread too widely. It almost seems like someone is deliberately pushing it, or it's related to Houfu's divine ability. Our family should give him the respect he deserves, but we must be cautious."

After another moment of consideration, he decided, "Let's visit the Xiao Family first since they will also be going to congratulate him. If our family goes with them, there's nothing we have to worry about."

1. "Son of Diyang" can be literally translated as "child born from the earth". The literal meaning of "Diyang" means "born/nurtured by earth", and Shiqi means "World's Navel". ☜




# Chapter 531: Huiyao

Li Yuanjiao stood with his hands behind his back, listening as Zong Yan introduced the island to him.

"There are more than five thousand people on the island, and most are fishermen. The island also cultivates rice and fruit, but the fields are sparse, so women and children handle most of the work..."

"There are many demons in the area, some of whom are the Dragon Son's lackeys. They tend to be greedy, so when some of our people don't return from venturing out to sea, we know they've been eaten."
𝘧𝘳𝘦ℯ𝓌𝘦𝒷𝘯𝑜𝑣𝘦𝓁.𝒸𝘰𝓂

After observing Zongquan Island for a while, purple and golden lights streaked in from the east and west. Zong Yan quickly opened the formation, and Li Qinghong and Kongheng landed one after the other.

Li Qinghong surveyed the surroundings and commented, "There are several islands to the east, but none are as good as this one. It's a pretty good size but the spiritual energy is weak."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement, while Kongheng clasped his hands together and spoke in a measured tone.

"I traveled westward. The sea was vast but without a suitable place to establish ourselves."

After hearing their conversation, realization struck Zong Yan and he felt a surge of excitement.

So, these cultivators of orthodox Dao from the mainland are looking for a place to settle! Wonderful! They appear to be disciples of the immortal sect—Zongquan Island's time has finally come!

Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong exchanged glances and came to a decision. Noticing her brother's stern expression, which made him appear fierce, Li Qinghong turned to Zong Yan, who seemed delighted.

"Fellow Daoist, as you can see, we intend to establish a base at sea. Zongquan Island is quite suitable for us. We would like to investigate further and discuss this matter in detail with you."

Since Li Yuanjiao intended to take on the role of a villain, Li Qinghong stepped in to chair the negotiation. Although she spoke politely and expressed her intention to discuss the matter in detail, Zong Yan understood that there was little room for negotiation due to the stark disparity between their strengths. It all came down to whether this group would ultimately decide to take over this island.

Zong Yan timidly agreed before Li Qinghong requested, "Well then, fellow Daoist, please accompany Kongheng and the other guest cultivators to survey the earth vein and assess the spiritual energy."

Kongheng excused himself and went off with the rest, leaving Li Yuanjiao standing alongside his younger sister.

He voiced his concerns and Li Qinghong contemplated for a moment before replying, "From what I've observed along the way, the Eastern Sea Dragon Clan treats the islands as fields and the people as livestock, much like raising pigs and cattle in a pen. Even the Golden Tang Gate and the Profound Peak Gate have to pay their tributes; it will be nearly impossible for us to avoid that."

"That's true," Li Yuanjiao agreed, lowering his gaze before saying, "I wonder if I could meet the Dragon Son or find a way to negotiate the matter... perhaps use other resources to pay. Regardless, I need to try."

Li Qinghong shook her head and said softly, "It'll likely be very difficult for you to meet the Dragon Son. Although he is only at the Foundation Establishment Realm, he is a noble dragon. I can't even imagine how many demon generals he commands. Even if we manage to meet him, we can't predict what kind of payment he might demand. It would be better to start with the lesser demons and bribe them with a generous sum, which may ultimately cost less."

The two of them rode the wind through the dark night, sinking into the sea without even realizing it.

Under the night sky, the Scarlet Pristine Sea sparkled with countless tiny green lights. The mana lights deep in the sea flickered like stars, creating a breathtaking sight in the darkness. The golden magnificence of the demon palaces could be seen from the distance.

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and remarked, "Only after leaving the Eastern Sea did I realize how small the mainland is and how powerful the demons are. The strength of the Eastern Sea demon clan alone can rival that of Jiangnan. It's even rarer to see such a unified command; they are deeply rooted and work together."

Sighing, Li Yuanjiao turned back to glance at Zongquan Island, while Li Qinghong said softly, "This island has no fire veins or earth veins; it offers little benefit other than a few sources of incense. The important thing is to establish a foothold overseas. Our family is gradually stabilizing as a prominent clan... we should consider reaching the Purple Mansion Realm."

"Without the right cultivation techniques and opportunities, it's all just empty talk," Li Yuanjiao replied, shaking his head before continuing, "In my opinion, our family can only improve significantly by obtaining what Yu Muxian possesses."

Given Yu Muxian's status, it was impossible for him to die on the mainland. If the Li Family wished to plot against him, their only option was to ambush him in the Eastern Sea with the help of the mirror, in a way that they could avoid Daoist Master Yuanwu's retaliation. This was also a troublesome matter.

Li Yuanjiao added, "Once the island matters are settled, you should return home first. I will stay here to guard, cultivate in seclusion, and try my luck to break through to the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Meanwhile, send people to the major markets to gather all available information about the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and their immortal foundations. These are classified information on the mainland, but there might still be opportunities to uncover them overseas," he said.

"All right," Li Qinghong replied.

Thunder immortal foundation was not highly coveted in Jiangnan, making it more suitable for her to remain on Qingdu. The siblings discussed for a while longer before landing back on the island.

Kongheng approached them and reported politely, "There are three relatively strong earth veins on the island, but the others are weak with shallow spiritual energy. It's impossible to establish a Foundation Establishment Realm formation; at most, it can only support one that is at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm."

After hearing this, Li Yuanjiao turned to Zong Yan and asked, "When will the Dragon Son's subordinates arrive?"

"In the next few days!" Zong Yan replied quickly.

At that moment, a cheer suddenly erupted on the island. A man arrived on the wind and whispered something into Zong Yan's ear. Li Yuanjiao cast a neutral glance at him and Zong Yan immediately caught on.

He bowed and said, "My lord, I practice the Six Yi All-In-One Technique on my island. I follow the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao but wield the shamanic spells and talismans. There are many Dao paths to raise medicine-humans... All this was granted by the Dragon Son, for the sake of raising them..."

"And we just found a baby born on the required day..." he added.

Zong Yan spoke vaguely, wary of offending the others. He lowered his voice and continued, "Each time the tributes are collected, the Dragon Son keeps the one with a specific birthday for the next collection. If no suitable person is found, he will use a hundred others to offset it. So... each time a suitable child is discovered, it's hard for us to contain our excitement."

Before Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong could respond, Kongheng could no longer restrain himself. He said in a sudden outburst of emotion, "Don't you have an ounce of compassion? Even if you're sacrificing one to save many, you shouldn't be so proud of it! Are you going to thank the evil dragon next year if it eats one less person next year?!"

Zong Yan dropped to his knees, horrified.

"Master Monk, you can't say that! If it weren't for the Dragon Son's protection, we would have been killed by passing devil cultivators or devoured by the demon generals... How can we not be grateful?"

Kongheng was taken aback. He stared at Zong Yan in disbelief for a few breaths before exclaiming, "So, you're saying that a minor crime isn't a crime?"

Zong Yan was confused by the monk's reaction. He raised his head in fear and mumbled, "But Lord Dragon Son saved us from a greater evil... Everyone knows we should choose the lesser of two evils. Why do you want to beat him down for it?"

"But he clearly eats people! How can you still be grateful toward him?"

"That's enough..." Li Qinghong interjected, trying to mediate. The perspectives of Kongheng and Zong Yan were so different that they would probably continue to argue until dawn without an outcome.

Zong Yan responded timidly, while Kongheng let out a long sigh before apologizing and appeared lost in thought.

The two men left and Li Yuanjiao stood with his hands behind his back, somewhat absent-minded before slowly closing his eyes. Li Qinghong looked back, and Li Yuanjiao murmured, "There is a demon outside."

The two of them rode the wind out and soon spotted a green fish hovering in the air. A pair of scaly wings grew from beneath its ribs, making it look particularly strange. Li Yuanjiao rode forward to meet it.

The fish's large eyes locked onto the two cultivators, its mouth opening and closing as it spoke in a clear voice, "Where do you come from, fellow Daoists? This is the territory of my Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace."

This fish demon was at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and had not yet achieved the Foundation Establishment. Both members of the Li Family were Foundation Establishment cultivators, and were much stronger than it was. The fish demon was quite polite, yet spoke to them as equals in conversation.

Li Qinghong spoke respectfully, "My brother and I were originally cultivators from a minor sect at Lake Xian. After our sect collapsed, we passed through here and considered settling down here. However, we are unfamiliar with this place and hope you can offer us some advice, fellow Daoist."

"You are too polite, fellow Daoist," the fish demon replied, folding its wings and stepping onto the demonic wind. Its fish lip curled up slightly as its scales flipped in the wind and dripped with mucus.

With a cryptic expression, it continued, "I am from the Hui Clan in the algae, patrolling the sea for the Serpent Dragon Palace. My name is Huiyao. If the two Daoists are willing to serve my Serpent Dragon Palace, I will naturally share everything I know."

The fish then retracted its tail and transformed into a half-man, half-fish figure, looking rather sinister and ugly. It wielded a fork and stared at the two of them. In this situation, the status of the cultivators from the mainland and the overseas demons was reversed; Li Yuanjiao and the others were now asking for favors, like Luken the deer demon from the past.
𝑓𝘳𝘦𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝘯ℴ𝘷𝘦𝓁.𝑐𝑜𝑚

Nevertheless, Li Yuanjiao was not one to blow his own horn. Despite the fish demon's grotesque visage, he smiled and said in a deep voice, "This way please, fellow Daoist."

As soon as they descended together, Zong Yan approached and bowed, "Greetings, Grandpa Sea Patrol. I have prepared the tributes!"

Huiyao chuckled and happily replied, "Hehe! Good for you. After enduring for so many years, you're finally in charge of this place!"

"Y-Yes..." Zong Yan nodded, flattered, and signaled for his men to fetch the tributes. They entered the hall, and the servants quickly served them tea. Zong Yan kneeled beside Huiyao and presented a jade bottle filled with red blood.

Huiyao waved his hands, scolding, "You blind fool! We have a distinguished guest today; it is inappropriate to drink this!"

Realization struck Zong Yan as he retracted the bottle respectfully. Li Yuanjiao's expression remained unchanged, while Li Qinghong's smile grew more pronounced.

Huiyao continued, "My subordinate has embarrassed himself. Please forgive him, both of you."

Huiyao was not foolish. The faces of these two were filled with pure qi, suggesting they were mainland cultivators or disciples of some ancient sect. However, its own strength was currently inferior, and it was not foolish enough to offend these cultivators. If the two of them truly killed him and escaped, the Dragon Son might not necessarily chase them down.

After exchanging a few words with Huiyao, Li Yuanjiao cut to the chase.

"What is the expected tribute for Zongquan Island?"

Huiyao regarded him calmly and replied, "This place is barren, the Dragon Son has never bothered us. It has been given to my clan, so the tributes are for me!"

The siblings exchanged glances, realizing that Huiyao had the upper hand in the negotiation now. Li Yuanjiao felt a headache coming on, but the fish demon continued, "Are you cultivating Pit Water, fellow Daoist? Can you show me your ability?"

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, summoning a grayish-blue serpent dragon that rose gracefully in the courtyard before them. Huiyao glanced at it, nodded, and said, "I see, it's the Jing Dragon King! No wonder I felt a sense of familiarity the moment I saw you, fellow Daoist... The Dragon Son also practices this method—the Jing Dragon King."

Huiyao pondered for a moment before speaking seriously.

"Since you would like to establish your base here, this arrangement is beneficial for both of us... I won't make it hard for your esteemed clan."

It stretched out its fish-like hand and casually continued, "One medicine-human each year, ten Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit items, and two Qi Cultivation Realm spirit items. Ores are acceptable too. As for the passing demons that seek bribes, that's for you two to handle."

The demon did not have much use for Spirit Stones, so most of its demands centered around spirit items and humans. This requirement was significantly greater than Zong Yan's original demand of three hundred people over five years. Huiyao said that it would not make things difficult for them, but his demands were far from reasonable.

Before either of them could respond, Huiyao stated directly, "By the rules of my Serpent Dragon Palace... No matter where you come from, you must obey the Dragon Clan's orders when you enter our territory."

Huiyao's statement was no different than a reminder for Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong to drop their arrogance. The words were harsh, and Zong Yan began to sweat nervously, fearing the siblings might lose their composure from this provocation.

He dropped to his knees, grasping Huiyao's fish-like leg, and cried, "Grandpa Sea Patrol! It's my fault for not gathering news properly. Please consider the many years of hard work I've put in and spare me..."

Huiyao pursed its lips and kicked him away. However, Li Yuanjiao remained calm and replied politely, "I understand your demands, fellow Daoist. It's just that offering medicine-humans goes against my family's rules. Can that be substituted with something else?"

"Substituted?" Huiyao repeated, then laughed sarcastically, "Others use medicine-humans as substitutions for spirit items, but you do the opposite. How foolish! Are you even aware of the cost? What can you offer year after year?"

Li Yuanjiao retrieved a jade box from his storage pouch and offered, "How about this?"

Hu Yao looked down to see a small flower resting inside the jade box. He sniffed it and exclaimed, "A Foundation Establishment Realm spirit item?!"

"Yes, one flower in exchange for five years' worth of medicine-humans," Li Yuanjiao replied, putting it away before Huiyao could inspect it further.

Huiyao wiped his drool but protested, "Five years? That's too much!"

"Think about it again, fellow Daoist. This is a spirit flower from the mainland. It makes a good present for a demon general. I acquired it through some favors with the Han Family," Li Yuanjiao countered.

Huiyao's face lit up with greed upon hearing that. Li Yuanjiao deliberately paused before asking, "Will this work?"

"Yes! Yes!" Huiyao replied eagerly, but Li Yuanjiao deliberately continued, "Alas, it's a pity that this cannot be shown to others... On second thought... Perhaps I should go with medicine-humans!"

"Fellow Daoist, what do you mean by that?!" Huiyao's expression shifted dramatically once more.

Li Yuanjiao explained in a low voice, "This flower was acquired through certain means... The Han Family has always kept its existence under wraps. If it becomes public knowledge, it could lead to serious trouble!"

The Wanglin Blossom was not exclusive to his family. Li Yuanjiao was an overthinker, so it was impossible for him to overlook this, so he made up a story to tempt Huiyao.

"Ah!"

Huiyao's expression changed completely as various possibilities raced through his mind.

Li Yuanjiao smiled, adding, "I came to the Eastern Sea merely to find a place to settle. If things don't work out, the worst I can do is leave and return home. The Serpent Dragon Palace cannot extend its reach to the mainland. Fellow Daoist, you better consider this carefully!"

His tone was gentle, but an underlying threat was evident. Huiyao fell silent for a moment, then realized that Li Yuanjiao had stepped closer, pressing his hand on the hilt of his sword.

Huiyao started, catching a glimpse of the green and white sword light flowing in Li Yuanjiao's grasp. For a moment, his legs turned to jelly, and panic set in.

The situation had shifted too quickly; in just a few exchanges, the power dynamic had completely changed. It seemed he had no choice but to comply with this person.




# Chapter 533: Threats And Promises

All sorts of emotions flickered across Huiyao's face until his expression ultimately softened as he forced himself to laugh.

"Fine; I can simply relocate those people to other islands and treat it as a friendly exchange!"

"Good," Li Yuanjiao replied, narrowing his eyes and saying nothing further.

Huiyao reluctantly swore the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, and only then did Li Yuanjiao remove his hand from the hilt of his sword.

Li Yuanjiao gave his younger sister a signal, and Li Qinghong produced a storage pouch, placing it into the demon's hands. When Huiyao accepted it, his expression became more sincere. After exchanging a few more words, he hurriedly excused himself, cradling the jade box in its arms.

He flew out of the formation in a daze. It took him some time to register the fact that he had just been manipulated into taking an oath. Cold sweat trickled down his back and his mind was reeling.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

Upon opening the storage pouch again, he discovered numerous spirit ores. The jade box in his hand felt icy, stirring feelings of excitement within him. Huiyao silently transformed back into his original form and dove deep into the sea.

As soon as Zong Yan respectfully sent Huiyao out of the formation, Li Qinghong sneered.

"As expected, they all fear power and lack morals. Trying to tempt them will just make their appetite grow; raise a fist, and they'll be silent immediately."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement and said, "Nevertheless, they should be given what they deserve. These lap dogs may be useless but it's easy for them to sabotage us. I'm just worried they may lead enemies here."

As soon as they finished speaking, Zong Yan came rushing back on the wind. He kneeled and prostrated himself before the siblings respectfully and said, "Greetings, my lord and my lady! From now on, Zongquan Island shall follow your lead!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, observing Zong Yan's behavior. He was more adept than most, so Li Yuanjiao said softly, "Have you always been this humble all the time?"

Zong Yan sighed, yet his respectful expression remained unchanged as he cupped his hands and replied earnestly, "Of course! By humbling myself and calling him Grandpa to gain his favor, I can save a few people on the island from dying."

Li Yuanjiao fell silent, while Li Qinghong cast a silent glance at him and remarked softly, "Everyone says that the Eastern Sea is a dark place, but you are much brighter than the so-called orthodox Daos in the mainland."

Zong Yan humbly denied the compliment. Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao pulled several bags of Spirit Paddies from his storage pouch, placing them before the hall with a clatter. He then took out several pills and handed them all to Zong Yan.

"You can use these resources for now and distribute the Spirit Paddies to the cultivators on the island. There's no need to consume blood qi from now on anymore."

Zong Yan kneeled and bowed deeply, his voice choked with emotion as he stammered, "Understood!"

In the eyes of the Li Family, these Spirit Paddies were just a drop in the bucket, but in this remote sea area, where they could not be grown, they were considered rare resources for Zong Yan and the others.

Clutching the items, he respectfully retreated. He checked a few of the pills, inhaling their fragrant scent, and felt his eyes watering. He hurriedly dragged a boy out from the side hall, shaking him excitedly as he exclaimed, "Good boy, let's go home!"

The boy took two unsteady steps forward, causing Zong Yan to burst into laughter. He lifted him into his arm, then rode the wind as they sped away toward the distant town.

In the hall, Li Yuanjiao and the others smiled as they watched Zong Yan leave. Li Qinghong remarked, "This is truly a remote sea area that remains oblivious to the prosperity of the mainland... Ten Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit items? What kind of request is that? When our family was an Embryonic Breathing Realm family, our tribute to the Azure Pond Sect was already far more than that!"

Li Yuanjiao sighed, shaking his head.

These spirit items from the mainland will be recognized. I should exchange them for overseas spirit items in the market first to avoid raising any suspicions with that demon.

As for the Wanglin Blossom...

I've already inquired about it. Aside from being sold overseas by the Han Family, there are several others in the north. A couple can also be found in the sea. We only have to give one every five years, it shouldn't be an issue, especially involving the Han Family...

Initially, Li Yuanjiao could not think of anything that would attract that demon's attention, so he made Huiyao swear a spiritual oath and made it accept bribes from his family. With this, he could no longer oppress them with the Serpent Dragon Palace's prestige. This was already a worthwhile exchange.

"Now that this is settled, I will return and look after our family now," Li Qinghong announced.

Li Yuanjiao glanced at his sister, then said, "Kongheng and I will escort you all the way to Lake Xian. Don't worry about troubling us. After the round trip, I plan to enter seclusion to prepare for a breakthrough to the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"All right!" she agreed.

————

The formation on Mount Qingdu radiated a light green glow as always. Li Chengliao took a few steps on the water, crossed the lake, and landed in the town.

The Jade Court Guard, Chen Mufeng, had been waiting on the shore for quite some time. With Li Xicheng's recent ascension as the head of the family, Chen Mufeng had also gained the power and resources he had long desired.

He had now reached the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, which was pretty impressive.

The young master before him was the future pillar of his lineage. Though Li Chengliao rarely visited Qingdu, Chen Mufeng had made time in his busy schedule to meet him. He greeted Li Chengliao with a smile, and Li Chengliao returned the gesture slightly, murmuring, "Battalion Commander."

"Greetings, young master."

At present, Li Chengliao was at the fourth heavenly layer of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. While it wasn't quite time for him to descend the mountain, his father, Li Xicheng, had found a betrothed for him, prompting him to make the trip to meet her.

As the eldest of his generation, Li Chengliao enjoyed a noble status in the family. Many prominent families were vying for his attention, but Li Xicheng had already chosen a girl from the Liu Family.

The Liu Family had been in decline for some time, but they had recently produced a talented girl named Liu Lingzhen. She broke through to the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm at just fifteen, making her a genius in the town.

Despite her talent, the Liu Family lacked the resources for proper training, making it a considerable achievement for her to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the prominent families on her own.

With such talent and her humble background, Li Xicheng was thrilled and consulted with the Liu Family to arrange an engagement for Li Chengliao.

The decision had been finalized, and Li Chengliao had seen the girl's portrait. She was indeed beautiful and talented, so he had no objections. However, he felt it necessary to meet her in person to determine whether she was astute or simply a pretty face.

Following Chen Mufeng into the main hall, they turned a few corners and entered the side hall. Two cups of tea had been placed on the table, but no one was present.

"Hmm?"

Li Chengliao frowned slightly and seemed to be taken aback while Chen Mufeng was embarrassed. He quickly apologized, "I'll go and check... Perhaps something has happened."

"No worries. Please do as you please, Battalion Commander," Li Chengliao assured him. As Chen Mufeng turned to leave, another Jade Court Guard rushed in, kneeling on one knee as he announced grimly, "Reporting to my lord..."

Although he spoke softly, Li Chengliao, yet to develop his spiritual sense, could only catch a few vague words.

"It's useless... The Xu Family... refused to come after all... The news has been blocked..."

Li Chengliao's frown deepened as he swirled the teacup on the table, glancing at Chen Mufeng's back. He noticed the middle-aged man clenching his fists tightly, gritting his teeth as he forced himself to suppress his voice.

"Gather all the court guards for me!" he ordered.




# Chapter 534: Xu Xiao

The Jade Court Guard hurried and left, and Chen Mufeng's expression was grim. Li Chengliao took a sip of tea and asked, "Battalion Commander... what happened?"

Chen Mufeng turned around and replied respectfully, "It's just a few trivial matters, Young Master... Let me—"

Li Chengliao happily poured him a cup of tea and responded, "There are no such things as trivial matters; they are all family affairs."

Chen Mufeng's expression shifted slightly, and he hurriedly explained, "It's about Lady Liu... She has a childhood sweetheart, the son of a family in town. His surname is Xu, and he has some family assets... His ancestor is the head of a town. The Liu Family wanted to use Lady Liu to elevate their status, but after hearing that Family Head is interested in her, they immediately changed their mind... and this caused some gossip..."

"Oh?"

An amused smile appeared on Li Chengliao's face, and he joked, "Looks like I've become a scoundrel who stole someone's wife!"

Chen Mufeng looked embarrassed and said, "We have sent two people to invite Lady Liu here but that man managed to beat them up and turn them away... Although those two are cultivators, they were no match for him."

At this, Li Chengliao's smile vanished instantly. He fixed his gaze on the middle-aged man and said, "In my Li Family's territory, I am the head of the second lineage. I sent people to bring her here, and he dared to beat them up and chase them away? Who does he take the Li Family for? We've never forced Lady Liu to agree to the marriage. She could have handled this in a more civilized manner instead of making things awkward!"

Chen Mufeng hung his head in silence and replied, "I have sent the Jade Court Guards over..."

"Wait..." Li Chengliao frowned and continued, "I finally made it down the mountain; let's not create a scene. My clan uncles dislike that and I don't want to risk drawing their attention. That won't end well."

Chen Mufeng nodded in agreement.

"Get two Jade Court Guards over here; I'll go there and see for myself," Li Chengliao instructed.

He straightened his brocade robe and walked toward the door, accompanied by Chen Mufeng.

"This young master from the Xu Family is also rather peculiar. He was mute and had been stuck at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm for many years. He only broke through last month and now that he can speak, everyone showers him with praises..."

————

Liu Family's courtyard.

Although the Liu Family had been in decline for many years, it once enjoyed a glorious past.

The courtyard was dark and old, but it occupied a large area. An exquisite stone table sat in the center, where a woman with a cold aura around her leaned against it.

Her beautiful face was filled with radiance, but her slightly furrowed brow revealed a trace of sadness. At the other end of the table stood a strong, handsome young man who radiated vitality.

"Xiao, you are acting too impulsively... The Li Family is powerful and well-established; the geniuses in their family are cultivating in the sect, and they are connected to immortal clans through marriage. How could you offend them like this..? Even if they came to my house, I could have just found an excuse to deal with them. By beating those two up and chasing them away, you're essentially making this into a big issue!"

Xu Xiao crossed his arms and shook his head as he sneered coldly.
𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝒆𝓵.𝓬𝓸𝒎

"You don't understand! How many times will your excuses work? As long as their eldest son is interested in you, he'll continue sending people to bother you. The Liu Family won't miss the chance to climb the social ladder either. The only way to make him back down is to create a scene!"

"The Li Family values their reputation and enforces strict rules within their clan. My only concern is that we won't be able to create a big enough problem!" he added.

Liu Lingzhen shook her head and remarked softly. "You've been holed up in the courtyard for years and was mute before. You don't understand the extent of the Li Family's influence..."

Xu Xiao laughed proudly and assured, "Don't worry! I've broken through to Qi Cultivation Realm! The great Dao is just right in front of me!"

"What?!"

Surprise and joy filled Liu Lingzhen's face as she continued, "It's only been a few years! You've made another breakthrough?!"

She paused, then added with a hint of regret, "It's a pity it came two years too late. You're already twenty-five, and the Xu Family has bestowed the spiritual qi of heaven and earth on your big brother..."

"It doesn't matter. I don't even want that! It's just a portion of Cave Spring Clear Qi. I've used better," Xu Xiao replied, raising his eyebrows with disdain.

"It's just that I've been breaking through too quickly, so I can't reveal it to others yet. Though there's a secret technique to conceal it, it's hard to guarantee that the Li Family won't have any perception technique to see through it. I'll have to wait a few more years..."

He then changed the subject and continued coldly, "I'm just waiting for that pack of dogs to come and openly confront me. Even if he is Li Chengliao, the eldest son of this generation, the people in the Clan Affairs Courtyard are watching him closely... He'll be in trouble if they report him directly to Qingdu!"

After hearing him, Liu Lingzhen calmed down significantly and murmured, "What if the Clan Affairs Courtyard covers up for him...?"

"Hahaha! I checked the records a few days ago. The Clan Affairs Courtyard has always targeted the powerful. If they made any mistake, they would be the first to be blamed," Xu Xiao replied confidently.

He chuckled coldly and continued, "As long as you and I stay calm, the Jade Court Guards can't do anything to us! And with the immortal sect watching over all of us, I'm sure we'll be fine!"

Liu Lingzhen nodded, somewhat naively, listening to the words of her beloved. Just then, Xu Xiao detected something with his spiritual sense and whispered, "Someone is coming!"

Sure enough, an elder from the Liu Family called out from outside obsequiously. A series of knocks came from the courtyard door, followed by a creaking sound.

Madam Liu's voice rang out, "Zhen'er! Open the door quickly!"

Liu Lingzhen's face paled, and she grabbed Xu Xiao and urged him to leave. However, Xu Xiao refused to move and merely said, "It's too late. I doubt he can see through my cultivation. Just let him in!"

Madam Liu had no intention of waiting for Liu Lingzhen to answer the door. With a creak, it was pushed open. However, it was a young man clad in a pale-colored dharma robe who entered first with a spear slung across his back.

He glanced at the two of them and waved casually.

The middle-aged man behind him, who was at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, pushed the group of elders and clan uncles from the Liu Family out with ease. The door quickly slammed shut behind them.

The young man with a heroic face then said, "Li Chengliao from the Li Family greets fellow Daoists."

Liu Lingzhen felt as if she had fallen into an ice cave, and Xu Xiao was momentarily stunned. He had never expected Li Chengliao to come in person.

"Xu Xiao from the Xu Family greets Young Master," he managed to reply.

Seeing the way the couple looked at each other, Li Chengliao quickly understood the situation. He continued, speaking with a smile, "Young Master Xu truly looks impressive. The Xu Family is a well-respected lineage; it's about time a hero emerged among them."

Li Chengliao's words caught Xu Xiao off guard and rendered him speechless, while Liu Lingzhen found herself in a difficult position.

After a brief pause, Li Chengliao clarified, "It was the Liu Family who gave your name earlier, my lady. What a foolish mistake they have made! My subordinate also took their bribes and came to invite you over. Thankfully, Young Master Xu intervened; otherwise, it would have caused a misunderstanding!"

"This is certainly my office's oversight. As an apology, I've reserved a quota on the peak for the Xu Family and you, my lady. I've also sent someone to your family to issue a formal apology. I hope you can forgive the incompetence of my subordinates," he added generously.

Not only was Xu Xiao stunned, but Liu Lingzhen was also taken aback for a moment. Her face then lit up with joy as she looked at him with newfound admiration and bowed to express her gratitude. Xu Xiao also lowered his head and did the same.

Li Chengliao's gaze lingered on him for a moment before stepping outside. A group of Liu Family members immediately surrounded him, crying out in an effort to keep him there.

These individuals had been profligate sons when the Liu Family was in power. Now, as they aged and took on leadership roles, they had made a mess of things. Li Chengliao ignored their pleas and left the yard with Chen Mufeng right beside him.
𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝒆𝓵.𝓬𝓸𝒎

Once outside, Chen Mufeng seemed eager to speak. When they finally returned to the hall, the middle-aged man leaned closer and whispered, "That Xu Xiao... is really at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

Li Chengliao's smile vanished, replaced by a puzzled expression as he murmured quietly, "Not only is the Liu Family incompetent, but Liu Lingzhen also seems naive and lovesick. Thankfully, this engagement hasn't been finalized; otherwise, problems would arise sooner or later."

He then added thoughtfully, "As for Xu Xiao... his sudden rise is quite peculiar."

After a moment of contemplation, he said, "Tell me everything you know about Xu Xiao!"

Understanding the gravity of the situation, Chen Mufeng hurriedly replied, "He is twenty-five years old, born mute and rarely left his home. He remained at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm until he was twenty-one when he suddenly began to speak. His personality changed drastically, and he broke through in his cultivation, keeping it a secret until it was recently discovered that he reached the third stage."

Li Chengliao calculated silently, then voiced his suspicion, "Could he have encountered some opportunity?"

His doubt lingered, and he turned to ask, "I remember the head of the Liu Family... is an unrefined Qi Cultivator, right?"

"That's correct," Chen Mufeng confirmed.

Li Chengliao considered this answer, placing his hands behind his back as he said thoughtfully, "Send someone to call him over. Offer him some spirit items as a bribe, and have him test Xu Xiao."

Chen Mufeng was momentarily taken aback, thinking Li Chengliao was being overly cautious.

Nonetheless, given Li Chengliao's authority, he nodded and went off to execute the orders, leaving Li Chengliao standing in the hall, staring at the tea that had already grown cold in the wind.

"I would love to get to the bottom of this and see if this is the work of a demon," he murmured, his mouth set in a stern line.

————

Liu Family's courtyard.

Once the Li Family members left, Liu Lingzhen exclaimed happily, "He doesn't put on airs! What a good man!"

Good man..?

Xu Xiao sighed inwardly. Li Chengliao's response had completely taken him by surprise.

What a clever move to turn an enemy into a friend! No wonder the Li Family dominates the lake, monopolizes spirit fields, levies heavy taxes, and squeezes out every last bit of Spirit Paddies. They rely on connections to control the quotas, ensuring only their clan members can enter the immortal sect to train... and they've solidified their power within the family!

That young master may appear polite on the surface, but who knows if he holds a grudge in his heart? It seems we can't stay here for long... It's better to leave early and explore. Once we establish our immortal foundation and acquire divine abilities, we'll return and overthrow this tyrant...

"Zhen'er, once you break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, we'll go out and explore!" he said.

This had always been their goal, but now, Liu Lingzhen hesitated slightly.

"B-But... he has given me a place to practice on the mountain! The devil plague is rampant out there! Isn't it nice to stay in this safe haven and receive stipends? The Li Family is also quite nice... they never kill to collect blood qi!"

Xu Xiao sneered, transmitting his voice through mana, "Such a formidable family must have their dark secrets. Li Ximing can produce so many pills without compromising his cultivation progress—he might be relying on devil cultivation techniques and blood qi... He probably kills in secret behind the immortal sect's back. If the immortal sect eventually finds out about it, he'll certainly face dire consequences!"

Liu Lingzhen considered what he said carefully and felt that it made sense. She looked at him with admiration as Xu Xiao continued, "We'll travel the world or join the immortal sect! Once we become Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, we'll return and take over this family. Isn't that a good plan? By then, clan stipends will mean little to us; and the entire southern shore will be ours!"

His strong confidence captivated Liu Lingzhen. Compared to Li Chengliao's politeness and reluctance to cause trouble, Xu Xiao was far more charming. She smiled and nodded vigorously.

Xu Xiao paused, feeling that the situation was becoming more challenging than expected as Li Chengliao had caught him off guard. He produced a pill and suggested, "You should go into seclusion and attempt a breakthrough now. Take this pill right away, don't wait for the Qi Cultivation Realm. When you reach Jade Capital Stage, we'll set off."

Liu Lingzhen's eyes lit up with excitement instantly, but she could not help but ask, "Where did you get this? You didn't steal it from home, did you..?"

"Don't worry," Xu Xiao assured softly.

After escorting Liu Lingzhen to the backyard, Xu Xiao prepared to leave. He had not mentioned his breakthrough to the Qi Cultivation Realm to anyone, so he could not ride the wind as his means of travel. As he stepped out of the room, he encountered a fierce-looking old man blocking his path.

"Liu Family Head," he greeted, keeping his tone even for Liu Lingzhen's sake, even though he had no respect for the man.

Yet, he had not anticipated the old man's harsh words.

"Stop seducing my daughter, you motherless bastard!"

Anger welled up in Xu Xiao as he retorted sharply, "I'm only showing you respect because of your daughter, old man! You better know your place!"

Old Liu, clearly enraged, lunged at him with an open palm, muttering curses under his breath. Xu Xiao swiftly grabbed the old man's arm with one hand, his grip like an iron clamp, preventing him from pulling away.

The old man made no attempt to pull his hand away either as he instinctively reached for the sword at his waist with his other hand.

With a sneer, Xu Xiao reacted faster than lightning, seizing the sword before the old man could even draw it. As he pulled and twisted, a dark flame erupted from his lips.

Old Man Liu felt a sharp pain in his chest and quickly pulled out two talismans, but they were incinerated in the flames before he could even have time to use them. He felt weak all over, as if his very cultivation had been burned dry.

He screamed and teetered on the brink of collapse. However, Xu Xiao had no intention of killing him; he calmly sucked the fire back into his stomach and warned coldly, "Annoy me again and you will die miserably."

With a swift motion, a small rune appeared in his hand. He slapped it onto Old Man Liu's chest and threatened, "If you dare to spread anything about me, this fire will reduce you to ashes as soon as you open your mouth!"

"Ah! D-Devil... Devil cultivator!"

Old Man Liu, having never encountered anything like that, was struck by how dark and eerie the spell was. He fearfully accused Xu Xiao of being a devil cultivator, but quickly fell silent and collapsed to the ground under Xu Xiao's fierce gaze.

With a mocking smile, Xu Xiao turned and walked away. Old Man Liu shakily got to his feet, spitting in anger, before quietly slipping into the backyard and kneeling down, too frightened to speak.

A Jade Court Guard landed in the courtyard, his appearance resembling that of Chen Mufeng. Shocked, he murmured, "Just that one move... Just one move..."

Even a Qi Cultivator of the second heavenly layer like him clearly felt the dangerous nature of the black flame, let alone Old Man Liu.

"Did he reincarnate, or did he inherit some sort of immortal legacy? I have never seen such a genius!" he murmured to himself.

Just as the Jade Court Guard finished speaking, he spotted a figure leaning against the backyard door. It was Xu Xiao, who had returned with a blazing black flame in his hand as he regarded him with a sinister expression.

"Captain Chen... why must you meddle in other people's affairs?"[1]

1. Translator Note: The author did not give Captain Chen a name, but he is actually a Squadron Leader Chen in the raw. We'll call him Captain Chen. Not to be confused with Commander Chen, Chen Mufeng, a battalion leader. ☜




# Chapter 536: Tremors

In the blink of an eye, Captain Chen felt an instant chilling sensation on his neck and when he reached for his waist, he found that the jade pendant he kept there had disappeared.

As he looked up again, a black flame materialized before him. He barely had time to raise his hands in defense before he was sent rolling on the ground. Xu Xiao glanced at him with disdain as he sneered coldly.

"All you cultivate are worthless techniques."

Captain Chen was shocked to be so easily overpowered by a cultivator at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Alarm bells rang in his mind—he suspected possession by a devil. As panic set in, he reached for his communication talisman to call for help.

"Seize!"

Xu Xiao raised a crimson command token, its surface adorned with ancient runes. With a sharp command, the token emitted a gentle red glow, shooting out like lightning right away.

Captain Chen let out two hoarse gasps before collapsing to his knees, his arms hanging limp by his sides. In a single move, his mind had been subdued, leaving him helpless.

Fearing that delaying would attract other Jade Court Guards, Xu Xiao acted swiftly. He formed a black seal in his hand, calmly stepping forward and pressing his palm into Captain Chen's chest.

Knowing that injuring or killing a Jade Court Guard would cause significant trouble, Xu Xiao had held back during their fight. Now, instead of striking a fatal blow, he planted a spell within Captain Chen's body. Once the seal took hold, he withdrew his token and watched as the man slowly regained consciousness.

Captain Chen emerged from his stupor, confused and disoriented. When clarity returned, his eyes filled with fear. Gripping his long blade, he appeared ready to fight once more.

Xu Xiao sneered, "Captain Chen, think carefully. We are in the same boat now."

The realization dawned on Captain Chen and he quickly scanned his body with his spiritual sense. With a heavy heart, he dropped his blade, despair washing over him. He thought bitterly to himself, I could die, but I can't doom my family along with me!

He reluctantly asked, "Who... who are you?"

Xu Xiao's expression remained calm.

"I know your family lives within the Li Family's territory... I will not force you into anything. Just pretend none of this happened. That way, you save your life and your family stays safe."

Xu Xiao's voice lowered, his tone measured and persuasive.

"Just turn a blind eye and let me leave. When the time comes, I will take Lingzhen and be gone without causing any trouble."

With his words precisely calibrated and the token subtly influencing Captain Chen's mind, Xu Xiao turned away confidently.

Caught in an agonizing inner struggle, Captain Chen watched Xu Xiao leave. Unable to resist the pull of self-preservation, he took off, flying toward the mountains as if nothing had happened.

Xu Xiao, observing his departure, smiled smugly, Whatever I want to do by the time I leave is beyond your control!

He then leisurely made his way back.

————

In the grand hall, Li Chengliao sat at the head of the room, holding a jade slip. A white-furred monkey stood nearby. The tall creature carried a staff on its back and wore a stern expression.

This white monkey, now at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, seldom spoke and rarely interacted with others. Its unwavering loyalty to the Li Family made it the perfect guardian for Li Chengliao.

Kneeling below him was Chen Mufeng, bowing his head in submission as he made his report.

"You are telling me Xu Xiao took two strikes from Old Man Liu and left wounded?" Li Chengliao said aloud as he listened carefully, pondering for a moment before his expression softened with a trace of guilt. "Seems I have been too harsh, envious of his talents... I may have wronged him."

Chen Mufeng remained silent, not daring to speak. Li Chengliao, known for his mild temperament, continued calmly, "Since that is the case, let us put this dispute with the Liu Family to rest. However... I fear Old Man Liu may pressure his daughter. Bring him here—I will explain the situation to him."

"Right away!" Chen Mufeng responded as he respectfully withdrew.

Li Chengliao sat in contemplation, considering how to smooth things over so he could return to his cultivation quickly.

"Xu Xiao may have potential, but he is not one to submit to others. It is best to foster goodwill, give him some Spirit Stones, and let him leave. My humble house cannot shelter a grand figure like him."

As these thoughts ran through his mind, an elderly figure shuffled into the hall, trembling as he kneeled before Li Chengliao. It was none other than Old Man Liu, who, despite his usual arrogance within the estate, now prostrated himself in silence.

"Liu Yi of the Liu Family pays respects to Family Head!"

He bowed deeply, his forehead damp with sweat, his voice trembling with respect.

"Family Head Liu, since your daughter Lingzhen and Xu Xiao have mutual affection, you should do them the favor of allowing their union. Let them pick a date, and I shall play the role of matchmaker on their wedding day!" Li Chengliao said as he stayed seated at the head of the hall and read from the jade slip in his hand, sipping tea calmly.

In his younger days, Old Man Liu had been a notorious wastrel, yet he had witnessed and heard of the Li Family's rise to power, leaving him deeply shaken. Due to Liu Rouxuan's connection, he had even met Li Tongya once.

At the time, he was still young and kneeled trembling before Li Tongya, too terrified to even raise his head. He could only hear Li Tongya addressing him by his full name and asking a few questions about the Liu Family's affairs, which had left his legs weak.

Now in his old age, Liu Yi had at least come to understand the gravity of situations and the value of life. However, with his fate in the hands of another, he could not find the words to speak.

Li Chengliao, noticing the silence, raised his eyebrows and glanced at him inquisitively.

"Hmm?"

That single sound shattered Liu Yi's courage. Torn between covering for Xu Xiao to save him and trembling with indecision, sweat streamed down his face. Before Li Chengliao could say a word, Liu Yi had already pressed his forehead to the ground repeatedly, sobbing uncontrollably.

Li Chengliao's smile slowly faded as he scrutinized the old man. Taking a step down from his seat, the crisp sound of his jade-tipped boots echoed on the steps below his robe.

He stood silently, watching as Liu Yi's sweat soaked the ground, realizing that something must be terribly wrong. In a low, heavy voice, he asked, "Liu Yi... what is going on?"

The mention of his name hit Liu Yi like a thunderclap, causing his legs to shake uncontrollably. Finally, the weight of the situation crushed him, and he wailed loudly, "Ancestor, Xu—"

He had only managed to utter the first syllable when the white monkey behind Li Chengliao opened its eyes, stepped forward, and reached for the old man.

But it was already too late. Black flames erupted from Liu Yi's body, bursting from his chest and abdomen with a thunderous boom. Blood splattered throughout the hall, sending his organs flying in all directions.

Black blood spouted like a fountain, filling the air. Li Chengliao stumbled back in shock, yet black stains still marred the hem of his robe, splattering across his chest and collar.

From within the boiling black blood, a dark seal shot upward, attempting to escape. However, a large furry hand swiftly reached out and deftly grasped the black light.

The black light struggled to break free, thrashing wildly amidst the overwhelming demonic energy surrounding it. Although it held a higher power, it was relentlessly ground down by the furry hand's immense force.

The white monkey withdrew its hand while Li Chengliao wiped the bloodstains from his collar. He removed his robe and draped it over his arm.

"Captain Chen!"

Li Chengliao's sudden shout rang through the hall. Hanging his robe carefully on the back of a chair, he saw Chen Mufeng rush in, his pupils dilating at the sight of the carnage.

Overwhelmed by fear, Chen Mufeng dropped to his knees with a thud, stammering, "I accept my punishment..."

Torn between fear and hatred toward Xu Xiao, Chen Mufeng also felt a flicker of relief that he was dealing with Li Chengliao. Had it been Li Yuanping, he would have kicked him to the ground without a word, leaving no room for explanations.

Facing away from him, Li Chengliao struggled to contain his anger, "Kneeling will not help. Gather the men immediately and secure the Xu Family... Xu Xiao might not even know yet."

Chen Mufeng leaped to his feet instantly and dashed out the door. Li Chengliao's voice echoed after him, "If he escapes, do not bother coming back."

Chen Mufeng responded with urgency, disappearing into the distance. Meanwhile, Li Chengliao was plagued by unease, recalling the old matter with Chu Yi from Yufu Prefecture. He knew too many hidden truths, and his mind remained clear despite the circumstances—Xu Xiao was no Chu Yi.

"With the cautionary tales of the Kong Family and Chu Yi, I cannot afford to be careless."

Calling yet another attendant forward, he ordered, "Keep a close watch on the Liu Family, especially Liu Lingzhen."

At that moment, Li Chengliao abandoned any thoughts of saving face or fostering harmony. His mind was now consumed with fear and hatred. Wasting no time, he summoned the white monkey, and together they took to the skies, heading toward Mount Qingdu.

Upon arriving at the mountain, the hall stood empty except for a young woman seated in the courtyard, combing her hair. Her phoenix-like eyes and fine eyebrows gave her an elegant, noble appearance.

Seeing her, Li Chengliao's heart sank. With a grim expression, he greeted her, "Auntie."

Although Li Yuexiang was younger than him, her seniority was much higher. Noticing his anxious demeanor, she asked, "Why the rush? My brother has already entered seclusion."

Hearing that Li Xijun was in seclusion, Li Chengliao's heart sank further. Li Yuexiang continued, "He sensed an opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm a few days ago, so he hurried into seclusion. It is best not to disturb him."

This is bad!

Although Li Chengliao knew there was not much benefit in sharing all the details with Li Yuexiang, he still gave her a brief account of the situation.

After listening, Li Yuexiang set down her comb, her expression thoughtful.

"So, he carries a thread of fate within him... That is why our brother suddenly went into seclusion, and Grandfather and Elder Donghe led a group of Qi Cultivation Realm disciples eastward to congratulate Daoist Master Houfu, leaving us with weakened defenses?"

Her words sent a chill through Li Chengliao as it was only then did he realize that many of their key Qi Cultivators had gone east. He responded grimly, "Can the thread of fate truly be so potent? Could this not all just be a coincidence?"

Li Yuexiang tied up her hair and answered, "Let us not lose our composure. Before going into seclusion, Brother left me a jade. It can summon him. Do you want to try it?"

Li Chengliao nodded decisively and said in a low voice, "Please awaken Eighth Uncle. This matter is too important! It is better to err on the side of caution, even if it means striking preemptively... I will take full responsibility."

Li Yuexiang took a jade pendant from her sleeve and murmured, "Do not speak of taking responsibility like that."

With a light squeeze, she crushed the jade talisman into powder.

————

At the Qingdu Cave Dwelling.

Li Xijun, looking slightly pale, stepped out of the cave dwelling, where several people were already waiting for him. He scanned them briefly, took a letter, and one of the Jade Court Guards stepped forward, bowing respectfully, "My Lord. The Clan Affairs Courtyard has sent word... there seems to be trouble with Young Master Chengliao."

"Trouble with Chengliao..?" Li Xijun frowned. The Cheng and Ming generation of the Li Family were not particularly gifted, except for the promising young Li Chenghuai. The only other noteworthy member was Li Chengliao, who was known for being courteous and steady.

"What happened?" Li Xijun asked.

"It appears to involve a conflict with the Xu Family in town... all over a woman," the guard reported.

"What?!" Li Xijun's expression darkened. Chengliao had always conducted himself well on the mountain; he never expected him to cause such trouble the moment he went down to town. However, without more details, Li Xijun held back his judgment and said quietly, "We will put this matter aside for now. Summon Yuexiang."

He figured that Yuexiang's urgent summons had to mean something serious was unfolding. His thoughts immediately turned to the possibility that their elders overseas were in trouble, prompting the use of the jade talisman to request aid. A sense of unease weighed heavily on him.

As he was about to get up, another figure rushed in and reported, "My Lord, the young lady and young master are here to see you."

Li Xijun sat back down and gestured with his hand.

"Let them in."

Li Yuexiang and Li Chengliao hurriedly stepped forward but without fully grasping the situation, Li Xijun calmly invited them to sit. However, Chengliao did not even take the time to sit before speaking urgently in a low voice, "Eighth Uncle! There is someone down in the town who might carry a thread of fate, just like what happened with Chu Yi."

This news was entirely beyond Li Xijun's expectations and far more serious than he had anticipated. His brows shot up in shock, and he asked gravely, "Where is this person? Have they made contact? How far have they gone?"

"Chengliao has already controlled the situation," Li Chengliao replied. "Though not as terrifying as Chu Yi, there is still something unsettling about him. He may carry a thread of fate and cannot be taken lightly."

Li Xijun rubbed the jade pendant hanging from his waist, pondering briefly. Just then, the lake beside Qingdu began to churn violently, and a gust of sinister wind swept through the courtyard. A young man dressed in black descended hurriedly, his piercing snake-like eyes scanning the surroundings before bowing his head, "Master, do you have orders for me?"

This was Li Wushao, whose twin hooked tail had already reformed, solidifying his combat prowess. Li Yuanjiao had assigned him to guard and train within the family grounds. Li Xijun spoke softly, "Something has gone wrong within the clan. I must rely on you, Senior Wushao."

Two streaks of black light swirled within the shadow beneath Wushao's feet. He nodded and stepped back behind Li Xijun.

"Let us go!" Li Xijun commanded.

Li Chengliao nodded in response, but Li Xijun hesitated momentarily and extended a hand to block his sister, Li Yuexiang. "You two must not go," he said solemnly, "People like this are often unpredictable and dangerous. I fear they might use underhanded means."

Li Yuexiang paused briefly, then retrieved a talisman from her sleeve and placed it into her brother's hands gently.
𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎

"Brother, this was left to me by Father. Take it for your protection. You must be cautious—who knows how strong this person is."

Li Xijun gave a silent nod, then summoned the wind and flew swiftly toward the town. From a distance, he could already see several figures patrolling the air above, maintaining a loose but watchful presence. The Li estate appeared as usual on the surface, yet a subtle tension filled the air, as if it were braced for something.

A Jade Court Guard whispered the gathered intelligence in Li Xijun's ear, guiding him toward the Xu Family estate from afar. "My Lord, the target is at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... Should we send someone to provoke the devil cultivator from the Xu Family and lure him out for you to observe?" the guard asked quietly.

"There is no need for such trouble," Li Xijun responded, forming a concealment spell. He remained high in the clouds, refraining from probing with his spiritual senses. Instead, his eyes glimmered with a pale light, cold as frost and hazy as mist as he focused his gaze downward.

The Xu Family's protective formation was rudimentary, designed merely to block external interference. With the enhancement of both his perception technique and talisman qi, the barrier quickly faded from his sight. In an instant, Li Xijun spotted a handsome youth standing within the courtyard.

"Third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm?!" he exclaimed in surprise.




# Chapter 538: Green Pine Temple

The robust young man sat upright in the courtyard, his fingers forming hand seals. Black flames churned from his palms, spreading in ripples around him. Dark runes flickered like streams of light around him, weaving and twisting through the air by his side.

Li Xijun cast a brief glance his way, wary of being noticed. He averted his gaze and monitored the young man from the corner of his eye.

Chengliao wasn't affected by him, meaning this person isn't on the same level as Chu Yi. There likely isn't a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind the scenes controlling him either. It's possible he carries a thread of fate, stumbled upon some hidden legacy, or received guidance from a skilled master.

Li Xijun refrained from acting hastily and first summoned Chen Mufeng.

"The Jade Court Guards patrolling the area are too concentrated—it might raise suspicion. Spread them out along the borders. His lover is still on the mountain; I will have Senior Wushao personally keep an eye on Xu Xiao," he instructed.

Chen Mufeng's heart was full of bitterness, thinking only of making amends and avoiding demotion.

At the time, he had only sent a trusted confidant, Captain Chen, his kinsman, to handle matters. Now, Chen Mufeng had quietly reassigned Captain Chen to Mount Yue to distance him from the events in town, intending to deal with him once the situation was resolved.

After voicing his acknowledgment, Chen Mufeng hurried off to carry out the orders.

Li Chengliao had initially granted Liu Lingzhen access to cultivate on the mountain, intending to drive a wedge and win her over. Yet now, it had inadvertently placed her within the grasp of the Li Family. Li Xijun assigned two people to question her discreetly, then turned to Li Wushao, "Senior, do you know of any sect techniques involving black flames, preferably ones capable of manipulating minds or threatening lives?"

Li Xijun was well-acquainted with the factions in Wu and Yue States and knew them thoroughly. However, he had never seen anything like this black flame—capable of beguiling minds and toying with lives—leading him to suspect it might originate from overseas influences.

Li Wushao thought for a moment, hissing as he spoke, "There are countless Dao lineages on the seas, and those sunken to the ocean floor are even more numerous. As for black flames... there is indeed one that is quite famous."

He paused for a moment, then added gravely, "Crimson Reef Island, a significant power on the seas. Their direct disciples cultivate Merging Fire, one of the Fire Virtue, and are known for breathing black flames laced with spells that confuse minds and cast sinister curses."

"Crimson Reef Island..."

Li Xijun's primary concern was whether this individual was a pawn of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. However, there had been no word from Li Xizhi's end. Given the current strength of the Li Family, any Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would have informed them before taking action, rather than stirring trouble in secret.

With no incoming news and given the limits of Xu Xiao's abilities, murderous intent rose in Li Xijun's heart. He suspected that someone was using Xu Xiao to disrupt his family. Yet, the Li Family had no prior conflict with Crimson Reef Island, making the situation uncertain. He summoned one of his men and ordered, "Find a clever female cultivator and have her extract some information from Liu Lingzhen—subtly. Gauge her stance on the immortal sects and gates."

The subordinate hesitated but nodded, leaving with several capable assistants. It was clear that he did not fully grasp Li Xijun's intent, prompting Li Xijun to elaborate, "Send a female cultivator to casually talk about some overseas sects. Drop a few deliberate errors—make it sound convincing but irritating. See if Liu Lingzhen can catch the mistakes and determine her attitude toward the sects."

After making these arrangements, Li Xijun refrained from acting hastily. He intended to probe further, delaying matters until the ancestors returned.

"If he leaves without incident, that would be ideal... but if he bears a grudge, we cannot let him go."

Li Xijun lingered in the sky, feeling deeply unsettled. Only he possessed the perception technique needed to pierce through illusions. He found a vantage point on Lijing Peak, where he could oversee the entire town below.

The night passed.

The next morning, a subordinate arrived on a gust of wind and reported respectfully, "My Lord, as you instructed, we sent someone to speak with Liu Lingzhen. She has revealed some information."

Following Li Xijun's orders, the female cultivator approached Liu Lingzhen arrogantly, showing off and casually mentioning some details about the outer seas. Liu Lingzhen, naive as she was, could not stand the boasting and retorted.

The subordinate reported, "She pointed out the mistakes made by the two agents we sent, exposing them easily. Once she started talking, she could not stop and spoke highly of the sects, even describing some of their artifacts in detail."

Xu Xiao may be cautious, but his lover is all appearance and no substance... she's left us far too many clues.

These remarks were swiftly relayed to Li Xijun. The mention of the outer seas stirred thoughts in his mind, prompting him to mutter, "A girl who has never set foot outside this town somehow knows about the artifacts of overseas sects...?"

With this information in hand, many possibilities were eliminated. The most likely scenario was that Xu Xiao had a thread of fate upon him, stumbling upon Crimson Reef Island's inheritance and falling under its influence—or he might even be a vessel possessed by someone from the island.

If Xu Xiao truly had deep connections to Crimson Reef Island, it could involve a rare technique for avoiding death through reincarnation, making him an even greater threat and harder to eliminate.

Li Xijun considered this possibility for a moment before dismissing it, "If it really is a reincarnation technique, the matter should have been made public. If he had informed us, the Li Family would have ensured his safe return to the island... unless he is some kind of rogue disciple."

His thoughts raced, circling through numerous possibilities. The more he pondered, the harder it became to judge the situation. Exhaling slowly, he turned his mind to the enigma surrounding reincarnation.

"No matter what, it is clear that he is tied to Crimson Reef Island."

Setting aside his concerns, Li Xijun flipped through the records handed to him by his subordinates, reviewing Xu Xiao's recent activities in detail. He had to admit that Xu Xiao's temperament and behavior suggested a growing resentment toward the Li Family—perhaps even greed.

Li Xijun found it intolerable for someone with a thread of fate to harbor ill will toward his family while remaining outside their control. Such a person posed a greater danger than a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator lurking nearby. If the situation escalated to that point, offending Crimson Reef Island might be unavoidable—Xu Xiao would have to be eliminated.

"Just because someone has a thread of fate does not mean they cannot be killed..."

As Li Xijun ran his hand along the hilt of his sword, murderous intent simmered within him. Suppressing it, he muttered to himself, "To deal with someone like this, you either hold back entirely or strike with full force, ensuring they have no chance to escape."

He stood up, calculating how long it would take for the senior family members to return. But with them far away on unpredictable journeys across the seas, Xu Xiao grew stronger with each passing day—waiting any longer might not be an option.

As these thoughts swirled in his mind, another subordinate rushed in and reported, "My Lord, that devil cultivator just took a large barrel of medicinal herbs! We do not know what kind of spell he intends to perform!"

The Li Family treated Xu Xiao with great caution. While the core members understood the reason, most of the lower-ranking members were left puzzled. Following Li Xijun's orders, word had spread that Xu Xiao was a devil cultivator who had seized another's body. Coupled with the grisly and bizarre death of Old Man Liu, fear and hatred toward Xu Xiao simmered among the family members.

Li Xijun rose swiftly upon hearing the latest report and rode the wind outside, where Wushao approached him with a hissing voice and reported, "He just left the courtyard."

Fixing his gaze on Xu Xiao, Li Xijun saw him sitting cross-legged, immersed in a bath of crimson medicinal liquid, seemingly preparing for a breakthrough. Li Xijun's heart sank, thinking to himself worriedly, No, I cannot wait any longer! If I let this continue, he might break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in just a few years! By the time the elders return from the vast Eastern Sea, he could already be too powerful. Who knows what methods he'll have mastered by then? And if he slips away unnoticed, it'll be too late... It's better to strike now than regret later!

Without hesitation, Li Xijun waved his hand, "Everyone, gather here!"

He narrowed his eyes, activating both his perception technique and talisman qi to observe the spiritual qi flowing through the medicinal bath. He waited patiently for Xu Xiao to enter the critical stage of his breakthrough.

"When he reaches the tipping point, we will strike together," Li Xijun murmured, his hand already resting on the hilt of the sword at his waist. Behind him, the hem of Li Wushao's robe shifted with an ominous, rolling motion, while the white monkey, Chen Mufeng, and the others stood at the ready, fully prepared for battle.

Li Xijun sighed inwardly, What a mess... Ever since our family achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm and rose to dominate the lake, it has been years since we've had to assemble with such vigilance... and now, all this, just for a mere Qi Cultivator!

Xu Xiao slowly calmed his mind, his breath becoming unsteady as the medicinal liquid in the basin whirled faster and began to dissipate. With the cautionary tales of Chu Yi and the Kong Family still fresh in his mind, Li Xijun dared not be careless. He feared his guest cultivators might also lower their guard, so he repeatedly reminded them, "This person is most likely a reincarnated devil... Who knows how many secret treasures or forbidden techniques he carries? Do not underestimate him! A single lapse could cost us our lives!"

Sure enough, at these words, the expressions of those present grew serious. Even Li Wushao, who had stood stiffly with a stern face, showed a flicker of surprise and increased his vigilance in his gaze toward the figure below.

Xu Xiao's aura surged.

Li Xijun held his breath, waiting for the critical moment to strike.

————

At the Eastern Sea.

Li Yuanjiao escorted Li Qinghong back to Lake Xian, ensuring she entered the river path leading to the Yue Cultivating Sect before heading eastward again.

Being a cautious person, he did not retrace his steps but instead took a different route with Kongheng to return to Zongquan Island, adding a slight detour while staying safe.

They flew silently for a while, passing a long, pine-covered island. From afar, the skies above were filled with clashing spells and flashes of light, creating an impressive commotion.

Based on his calculations, Li Yuanjiao determined that this location aligned with the notorious Green Pine Temple Ruins. For years, Sword Gate, Chunyi Dao Gate, and Crimson Reef Island had been vying for control over it, yet no resolution had been reached.

As Li Yuanjiao looked toward the ruins, a thought suddenly occurred to him. He turned to Kongheng and asked, "Master Monk, do the records of the Liao River's teachings mention anything about the ancient gate known as Green Pine Temple?"

Kongheng pressed his palms together and replied softly, "Indeed! This immortal temple was founded before Moonlight Origin Mansion... It produced two True Monarchs. The first remains obscure but was known to cultivate in the Fire Virtue system, while the second realized the Swamp Gold attainment but was slain by the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch."

Li Yuanjiao recalled the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch, whose name was linked to Splitreed Island. He nodded and then asked, "So, the legacies of Swamp Gold and Fire Virtue lie within Green Pine Temple?"

"Correct," Kongheng affirmed.

Li Yuanjiao, however, remained skeptical.

"If two True Monarchs emerged from there, how did it fall into the hands of these mere Purple Mansion Realm immortal gates? Would any Golden Core Realm cultivator not be interested in it? Surely, there are True Monarchs attuned to Swamp Gold within the mainland?"

Kongheng nodded and explained, "After the fall of Green Pine Temple, it was plundered by many factions, leaving it a desolate ruin. There are no longer any truly valuable treasures, which is why it is now called the Green Pine Temple Ruins."

Kongheng continued, "However, even if the artifacts are gone, the records of its techniques remain in the hidden realm within it. Moreover, there are ancient spirit herbs cultivated for centuries there, which are of significant value to any sect."

As Li Yuanjiao listened, his gaze returned to the mountain. Following his glance, Kongheng continued in a calm tone, "The Sword Gate covets the Swamp Gold Dao, Crimson Reef Island desires the Merging Fire arts, and Chunyi Gate claims to be the descendants of Green Pine Temple. Naturally, all of them want a piece. The great formation protecting Green Pine Temple remains sealed and has yet to be broken... They are all waiting for the arrival of a predestined person."

"A predestined person..?" Li Yuanjiao repeated thoughtfully, his brows furrowing.

Unwilling to get entangled in the conflict, Li Yuanjiao and Kongheng flew around the mountain. As they passed it, Li Yuanjiao murmured to himself, and Kongheng added, "This is also called fate... a subtle force, inexplicable yet undeniable. Without that destined person, not even Golden Core Realm cultivators can breach it, no matter how fiercely the three sects struggle."

Kongheng paused briefly before elaborating further, "Some formations open only when the destined person passes through it. Some treasures lie buried for millennia, waiting for one specific person to claim them. And some individuals, no matter the danger they encounter, possess foreknowledge and cannot be easily killed—all due to the force of fate."

"Fate is this powerful? Does that not make one invincible?" Li Yuanjiao pondered aloud, taking note of Kongheng's words.

Kongheng responded with a serene expression, "Fate is not a tangible force, much like the metallic essence, which also has limits. Triumph and defeat alike can be attributed to fate. As one scripture puts it: Whatever lies beyond one's strength to achieve, that is fate."

The words of a Buddhist cultivator were always cryptic. Li Yuanjiao pondered for a moment before quietly saying, "In my view, fate and Metallic Essence are very much alike. Both are forces beyond control—something that defies strategy and clouds judgment."

The thought of his elder, Li Tongya, crossed Li Yuanjiao's mind. Kongheng, hands clasped in front of him, chanted softly, "It was not always like this. Back then, whether immortal, devil, or monk, they all pursued absolute freedom. Now that freedom is achieved, this is what we have become."

Ripples shimmered across the turquoise and red surface of the water beneath them. Li Yuanjiao did not respond, instead flew alongside Kongheng quietly. Before long, they arrived at Zongquan Island. The people on the island, seeing the two return, cheered loudly, their joyful voices filling the air.

Once they landed, Zong Yan stepped forward respectfully to greet them. Kongheng murmured a few quiet words before retreating. Li Yuanjiao leaned closer to Zong Yan and instructed in a low voice, "Send out a few trusted men to gather information across the various marketplaces. Choose only the most loyal ones and ensure everything is done discreetly."

Zong Yan bowed deeply and reassured him, "Rest assured, My Lord. Everyone on this island has survived the jaws of monsters. Their loyalty is beyond question."

Li Yuanjiao's tone grew serious, "There is an immortal foundation known as the Molten Metal Cave, capable of sensing artifacts and forging weapons. Investigate which of the Three Gold it belongs to and whether it has any Dao Partners. Report back to me once you know this."

Zong Yan nodded and withdrew. Now having a direction, Li Yuanjiao mulled over his next steps, "The Molten Metal Cave—Azure Pond Sect has no known Dao Partners. Yu Muxian is a proud individual who would never allow his path to be severed. If I can gather information about related techniques and tie them to the Green Pine Temple Ruins, I can surely lure Yu Muxian out."

With the initial steps in place, Li Yuanjiao retreated to a secluded chamber. Activating the room's protective formations, he still felt uneasy. He retrieved a formation plate and meticulously rearranged the setup himself. Only then did he sit down, satisfied, ready to begin his meditation.

"Time to break through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm!"




# Chapter 540: Guo Hongyao

Lijing Town, Xu Family.

Xu Xiao stood topless, exposing his muscular shoulders and arms to the morning air. He had taken a walk early this morning and noticed several things that left him uneasy. It felt like a few silver needles were pricking at the space between his eyebrows.

Hiding in the house, he clutched a jade pearl in his sleeve and sat cross-legged, pretending to be calm. However, his breath wavered, and his thoughts flickered with uncertainty.

This morning, Captain Chen has not patrolled the streets as usual... Either something has happened, or he has been transferred. If the Li Family intends to make a significant move, they won't be able to hide it from him, so they'll move him away first...

Though Xu Xiao had both Old Man Liu and Captain Chen in his grasp, he still lacked confidence. Deep down, he felt a constant unease surging within him. Liu Lingzhen's weak character was a concern; he had to put up a facade in front of her.

Though he looked down on them, he was acutely aware of the Li Family's deep roots. Keeping these two under his control increased the risk of exposure, amplifying his anxiety.

After going out to buy medicinal herbs, he passed by the tavern to check if Old Liu was drinking as usual, only to find the shop vandalized and closed.

He returned to the courtyard with doubt gnawing at him. A bad feeling welled up in his heart.

If the Li Family were truly plotting against me, they wouldn't send just anyone to do it... But why would they go to such lengths? Who would act so obviously then so discreetly...?

He felt strange about this whole thing and was constantly on the edge. The urge to flee surged within him, but he hesitated; Liu Lingzhen was still on the mountain, and he could not bear to leave her behind.

Xu Xiao fantasized about returning home gloriously after a decade, overthrowing the Li Family's tyrannical rule, and elevating his own family to a prestigious clan. However, that was still far off, and for now, he could not afford to fall out with the Li Family.

As the jade pearl spun in his palm, many fantasies flashed before his eyes. Pain shot through his chest and shoulder blades. His heart raced as if an impending disaster awaited him. His left hand instinctively pressed against his storage pouch.

Hiss!

Suddenly, he felt a chill over half his face. Reacting quickly, he summoned the wind, retreating just in time. A flash of red armor materialized around him as the wall behind him crumbled, revealing a sinister black light.

BOOM!

A deafening explosion rang out and dust filled the air as the building collapsed. A massive black snake tail swept through the rubble, narrowly missing Xu Xiao and leaving him pale and shaken.

"A Foundation Establishment Realm demonic creature?!" he gasped in shock.

Before him stood a malevolent-looking youth, his black robe billowing in the wind. Between his black boots on the ground, two black hooks writhed in the shadows, exuding a bone-chilling aura.

Xu Xiao, taken aback and filled with dread, exclaimed, "You're that Hooked Serpent!"

Li Wushao was taken aback by the fact that Xu Xiao managed to dodge his attack, but he quickly suppressed his surprise.

"How strange. To think that a mere Qi Cultivator like you managed to dodge my attack," he murmured.

Battle cries filled the air, and several figures swung their swords, intent on cutting down Xu Xiao.

Reacting swiftly, Xu Xiao crushed the jade pearl in his grasp, conjuring a round Qi shield that enveloped him. He met Li Wushao's gaze with a solemn expression and declared, "I have never offended you. I merely intervened to stop that young master of yours from forcefully taking a commoner girl for a bride... Yet, here you are, trying to silence me!"

His words belied a blatant disdain for the Li Family's Qi Cultivators as he frowned and questioned their intentions. The Qi Cultivators surrounding him were inconsequential.

It's just a group of small fries that can't hurt me... They practice Grade Two or Three cultivation techniques and know no spells.

Since Xu Xiao's Qi shield was of the Foundation Establishment Realm, the attacks from the Qi Cultivators were ineffective against it. The mana lights merely bounced off and dissipated into the air.

Li Xijun observed the entire scene quietly, hidden among the clouds in the distance.

Thank goodness Li Wushao is here. Otherwise, even if all the Qi Cultivation elders of our family were present, they couldn't hope to touch him... It's fortunate that Li Wushao stayed behind instead of Kongheng, and he's repaired his tail hooks. If there were any missteps, he wouldn't stand a chance against him today!

Li Wushao, a demonic creature from the Eastern Sea, did not understand what Xu Xiao meant by forcefully taking a commoner girl for a bride and dismissed his words as mere nonsense. Ignoring him completely, he continued to extend his tail hooks.

Chen Mufeng, determined to stop Xu Xiao from saying more, shouted, "Devil! You killed Liu Yi! You've used devil techniques to control hundreds of households! You've advanced from the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm in just two years! What else could it be if not devil cultivation techniques? Who knows how many lives you've consumed in secret!"

While he was speaking, Li Wushao's tail hooks collided with Xu Xiao's shield. The difference in strength between Foundation Establishment and Qi Cultivation Realms was staggering.

Xu Xiao had no time to dodge and was struck by the tail hooks. Although the shield absorbed most of the impact, he still spat out a mouthful of blood and crashed into a section of the gate wall.

Li Wushao's survival in the Eastern Sea relied on the tail hooks on his tail and a few powerful techniques that utilized them. Unfortunately, he had once been ensnared by Kong Tingyun's dharma artifact and was defeated. Now, with his tail hooks repaired, his formidable performance excited Li Xijun.

Xu Xiao... He doesn't seem to be that strong...

Just a single strike from Li Wushao was enough to make Xu Xiao spit blood and stagger backward. Li Xijun breathed a sigh of relief. While keeping a watchful eye on the unfolding situation, he carefully observed the changing expressions of those around him.

Yes... Even if he were the reincarnation of a Golden Core Realm cultivator, only a peak Qi Cultivator could withstand an incense stick of time against a Foundation Establishment Realm ancestor from the Kong Family... I must have been too cautious.

Li Xijun stood in the clouds, blaming himself. He looked at the Foundation Establishment Realm shield protecting Xu Xiao, then fished out a talisman and sent it flying downward without hesitation.

The talisman flew through the air, transforming into an exquisite little hammer adorned with golden patterns. Its ends curved upward like sheep horns as it crashed down toward Xu Xiao with a resounding bang.

Li Wushao remained focused. Two shadows darted across the ground, moving swiftly like venomous snakes. As the two spells of the Foundation Establishment Realm collided, they struck with precision from both the front and back.

The little hammer talisman Li Xijun used was purchased from the Yuan Family. It was of exceptional quality—intended as a life-saving talisman that he had planned to only use in desperate situations.

The little hammer flew through the air and collided loudly with Xu Xiao's shield. To Li Xijun's dismay, the light of the shield merely dimmed as it withstood the attack.

What a powerful talisman!

With fierce determination, Li Wushao coordinated his attack according to the powerful strike of the Foundation Establishment Realm talisman. Initially planning to whittle away the strength of his opponent, he changed his battle strategy and struck hard from both directions.

"Devil cultivator?! You fools! This is the Profound Flame Merging Fire Secret Technique from the immortal sect!" Xu Xiao shouted, momentarily taken aback by the accusation.

He wanted to retort more but was quickly silenced by the decisiveness of Li Xijun, who had unleashed a high-quality Foundation Establishment Realm talisman right off the bat.

In his hand, a black and red token materialized. Upon activating it, a burst of red light was quickly unleashed. This was an attempt to block Li Wushao's tail hooks, hoping it would buy enough time for his shield to recover.

However, the red light only managed to block the black tail hooks momentarily. Xu Xiao's mana was drained rapidly, at the speed of a whale sucking up water.

Facing a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator like Li Wushao, a mere Qi Cultivator like Xu Xiao stood no chance. Despite his mana being considerably more than most cultivators, he faltered within moments.

Li Wushao was taken aback, thinking to himself, So, it is indeed the Merging Fire secret technique from Crimson Reef Island... How did it spread all the way here? If I kill this man, will it cause trouble for my master?

Gradually, Li Wushao increased his strength, and Xu Xiao found himself in a perilous predicament, screaming internally. The pressure from a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was unbearable. Without the shield, he knew he would not last more than a few exchanges against Li Wushao.

Desperation took hold, and he resorted to his most powerful attack. Biting his tongue, he sprayed a mouthful of blood onto the token.

As he cast the spell, the red light faded, and the shield creaked under the immense strain. Xu Xiao spat with venomous hatred, "Isn't your family worried about being punished by the Azure Pond Immortal Sect for taking human lives this way here?"

Li Xijun was momentarily stunned by his words. He gave the man a bewildered look.

Who could possibly rival the Azure Pond Sect when it comes to taking human life? Is this man truly clueless or is he feigning ignorance with such naive statements? The Azure Pond Sect would be delighted even if my family made buns with human flesh. They would even ask for a few...

Yet, as Li Xijun contemplated this, a sense of certainty washed over him.

This person doesn't seem to be a reincarnate but rather one who has inherited a legacy due to his fate...

In an instant, the token flared to life, unleashing a grayish-red flame that surged up and down, swirling like mist. Li Wushao's pupils dilated in alarm, and his tail hooks recoiled like a frightened bird, though they were still grazed by the flame.

Roar!!!

Li Wushao's head swelled like a balloon, twisting and morphing until it transformed into a snake head the size of a house, supported only by his small human form. His eyes, as large as a window, blazed a furious red as he screamed in agony, unable to maintain his human guise due to the pain.

His tail hooks retreated beneath his robe. A corner of them was scorched and blood was dripping from the injuries.

Seeing that the flame was effective, Xu Xiao's spirits instantly lifted. He let out a triumphant laugh, riding the wind as a red ring appeared beneath his feet, lifting him into the air.

Everything then progressed rapidly. Li Xijun had another talisman pinched between his fingers. He stepped forward, only to find Xu Xiao hovering in red armor with a gray flame burning in his grasp, turning his head back.

Their eyes met, and both men felt an unspoken intensity.

Li Xijun noted the greed and cruelty etched on Xu Xiao's face, feeling as if he were being seared by the scorching sun, teetering on the edge of a volcanic eruption.

Conversely, Xu Xiao felt an icy chill emanating from Li Xijun, feeling as if the man before him possessed eyes filled with the frost of winter, capable of penetrating his very thoughts.

I must eliminate this man!

That was the thought that crossed both their minds simultaneously, prompting them to step back, putting distance between them.

Xu Xiao contemplated, The situation is dire, and I cannot afford to delay any longer. Once I achieve Foundation Establishment Realm, I must kill him right away!

Li Xijun, too, grew wary.

This man's mistakes stemmed from information inconsistencies... He believed the immortal sect still held some sway! I cannot make him leave!

He hurled the talisman in his hand once more, shouting, "Li Wushao! If you hesitate, you will die at this man's hands!"

Xu Xiao's flame seemed particularly effective against demonic creatures. Li Wushao finally reverted to his human form but was grimacing in pain. His expression darkened as he soared into the air, gritting his teeth while pursuing Xu Xiao, wary of using his tail hooks again. He fumbled to retrieve a dharma artifact from his storage pouch.

Xu Xiao's face flushed as he pulled out two more talismans. Gray flames swirled around him. The dharma artifact that Li Wushao had drawn looked like a rod, but it melted before it could even reach Xu Xiao.

Li Xijun's eyes grew icy. He threw out the Hanlin Sword that was hanging from his waist, shouting, "TAKE THIS!"

Li Wushao coiled his tail hooks and caught the dharma sword that was glowing with a snowy light in his hand in one swift motion.
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝓮𝒘𝙚𝙗𝒏𝙤𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝒐𝙢

Xu Xiao summoned the gray flame once again to block it while accelerating on the wind. Just ahead, a Qi Cultivator raised an ax to strike at him.

Boom!

Without even as much as a glance, Xu Xiao hurled the flame forward, incinerating the attacker into ashes. A wave of shock rippled through the surrounding cultivators, and they dared only to release mana lights from a distance. The only ones bold enough to approach Xu Xiao and fight back were the more powerful cultivators like the white monkey; the rest silently retreated, shaken by the display of power.

The red ring beneath Xu Xiao's feet was probably a special flying shuttle, granting him remarkable speed. However, he was halted by several opponents, forcing him to weave left and right, unable to accelerate.

In a bid to break free from their encirclement, he unleashed the deadly flames that had earned him a fearsome reputation.

Just as he smiled at his impending escape, a flash of sword light cut through the air in front of him. Xu Xiao's expression darkened. He swung his sleeves, releasing a burst of flames as he growled, "Which blind fool dares to stop me?"

The dharma sword in the hands of the man blocking him instantly melted, and gray flames coiled up his dry arm like a venomous snake. Yet, the man seemed prepared. With a speed that outpaced the flames, he severed his own arm at the shoulder.

With a sickening noise, the dismembered limb turned to ashes before it could touch the ground. Xu Xiao was both visibly stunned and enraged. He opened his mouth to unleash more flames, but was interrupted by Li Wushao, who had already caught the sword. Besides, Li Xijun's talisman followed closely behind.

Bastard!

Xu Xiao's eyes darkened with fury. He took a moment to use his spiritual sense, discovering that the man who had dared to stop him was a shriveled, thin old man. The old man retreated silently with a stoic expression. The blood from his severed arm slowly ceased and his gray eyes radiated a calm resolve.

The old man's face was unsettlingly familiar to Xu Xiao. He recalled seeing him often, tending a spirit field by the lake—a place close to this very spot. The Li Family held him in high regard...

What was his name again...?

Ah, Li Qiuyang.

"Li Qiuyang! Li Qiuyang! A mere unrefined Qi Cultivator! I can't believe it's a pathetic unrefined Qi Cultivator! Bah!" Xu Xiao shouted, his face flushed with anger.

But as he raged, Li Wushao's sword struck him. The demonic creature relied on its overwhelming demonic power to knock Xu Xiao off balance, causing him to spit up blood. The red ring beneath his feet faltered, slowing him down.

The lethal Foundation Establishment Realm talisman barreled toward him, crashing against his paper-thin shield. The shield shattered like glass, leaving Xu Xiao exposed before the onlookers.

Flushed with humiliation, he attempted to ride the wind and force several attackers back with another burst of flames while reaching for a pill in a bottle he had taken out.

But in that fleeting moment, a long rod swept through the flames and struck his palm, shattering the bottle of pills.

Xu Xiao cried out in pain, feeling as though his heart had been pierced. He realized it was the powerful white monkey who had struck him.

Desperation consumed him, and despair settled in as he lamented, I can't believe I've lost to this despicable little creature! It seems like I won't be able to travel the world with Zhen'er!

Having exhausted all his trump cards and options, he continued to fight back with flames desperately as tears streamed down his face. Suddenly, he felt a tight grip around his neck, a powerful force propelling him out of the encirclement, and in an instant, he found himself flying several li away.

A low cry echoed from behind him, followed by a sweet voice that rang in his ears.

"I came as quickly as I could... and I finally made it in time!"

Xu Xiao, utterly drained yet filled with a mix of both sorrow and hope, turned to see a cute female cultivator in a red dress. Her fair skin and adorable appearance struck him like a bolt of lightning, momentarily stealing his breath away.

The female cultivator's attire was simple yet striking—a red dress adorned with black accents and a layer of soft gauze over it. She was breathtaking, her brows resembling delicate leaves. In her hand, she twirled a long, thin red dharma artifact that looked like a feather as she observed Xu Xiao.

Li Xijun, witnessing Xu Xiao escape from their encirclement, felt his blood boil with frustration. He coughed, nearly spitting blood. The frustration of having his calculations and plans foiled, got him biting his lip so hard it bled.

Beside him, Li Wushao was even more agitated. His reddened eyes widened to an almost unnatural size—taking up almost half of his face. A hissing sound escaped his throat as he gritted his teeth, demanding, "Who... are you?!"

For a moment, Li Xijun lost his composure, but he forced himself to calm down. Activating his talisman qi, he cooled his head and then tugged at Li Wushao's sleeve.

"Li Family of Qingdu greets Senior. If I may ask, which sect or gate do you represent?" Li Xijun asked.

The female cultivator, however, did not respond to his question.

Instead, she looked at Xu Xiao, her expression brightening as she spoke in a delicate voice.

"The legacy of Grand Martial Uncle has been buried for so many years, but finally, it has come to light at the right time... Good, very good indeed!"

Xu Xiao immediately understood that she was someone from the immortal sect who was here to rescue him.

"I... I've been hiding in this devil Dao's territory for far too long. Finally, the immortal sect has come to my rescue!" he exclaimed, a note of hope in his voice.

Reactions varied among those present. The female cultivator looked momentarily stunned before her lips curled into a small smile.

"Yes! I am Guo Hongyao from Crimson Reef Immortal Island. For the past few years, we have been fighting with Wanyu Sword Gate, Chunyi Dao Gate, and other devil Daos... I've kept you waiting, but I shall escort you back to the island now!"

Li Xijun felt sidelined, and the expressions of the Li Family members grew uneasy.

The female cultivator's gaze finally shifted to them, her demeanor cooling as she addressed them sharply.

"What kind of prestigious clans are you? Can't you even tell that I'm from the Dao lineage of this island? I've heard that you've been working closely with Wanyu Sword Gate and Profound Peak Gate... You lot are truly bad eggs!"

At this point, Li Xijun had no choice but to cup his fist and attempt to clarify.

"Senior, you've misunderstood us... We are just ignorant and have never seen the spells and techniques that originate from this immortal island."

Guo Hongyao's expression hardened as she waved her red sleeve dismissively and returned her gaze to Xu Xiao.

"I cannot simply overlook the fact that your family has bullied the disciple of our immortal island's gate!"

Taking a deep breath, Li Xijun asked, "What do you mean, Senior?"

Guo Hongyao sneered coldly at his attempt at feigning innocence.

"Command your demon pet to kill himself. As for you... since you are the descendant of the sword immortal, I'll let you off the hook if you apologize to the disciple of my gate. For compensation, let Li Yuanjiao come in person. You are not qualified to come," she said.

Li Wushao felt the hooks beneath his robe stir restlessly, circling ominously at his feet. His crimson eyes glared at the female cultivator with palpable hatred as he suppressed the urge to roar at her.

Meanwhile, Li Xijun's expression grew cold as he lowered his head and said, "Senior, you must be joking."

The moment those words left his lips, the atmosphere plummeted to a freezing point.

Guo Hongyao's smile vanished, and Li Wushao stepped protectively in front of Li Xijun, his eyes fixed on Xu Xiao as two black lights flickered ominously beneath his clothes.

"This isn't up to you!" Guo Hongyao sneered, dismissing Li Wushao entirely.




# Chapter 542: Beheading

Guo Hongyao spoke with biting sarcasm while Li Xijun restrained the Hooked Snake before him.

The female cultivator was a disciple of the immortal gate and they were without the protection of a formation. If a fight were to break out, it could spell disaster. Hence, Li Xijun had no choice but to speak courteously.

"This is our fault, but the Hooked Serpent is my elder's spirit beast, so I'm afraid we can't simply surrender him to appease you. Please reconsider, Senior."

Hearing this, Guo Hongyao's arrogance seemed to deflate. She scanned the group before turning to Xu Xiao.

"Bring the Six Ding Merging Fire Token here," Guo Hongyao demanded.

The Li Family still had considerable influence, and Guo Hongyao was wary of the looming threat of sword qi or a talisman.

Intent on securing the artifact for herself after such a long journey, she reached out, but her hand closed in on air.

"Hmm?"

Guo Hongyao snapped her head and glanced over quickly, only to see Xu Xiao smiling.

"Senior... this spirit artifact has already recognized me as its master. I'm afraid I can't hand it over," he explained softly.

This spirit artifact was the source of Xu Xiao's strength, and giving it up was naturally out of the question.

Although Guo Hongyao had saved his life, Xu Xiao knew that everyone coveted the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact so he clearly was not going to hand it over so easily.

Guo Hongyao hummed in acknowledgment and feigned indifference. However, a flicker of impatience flashed across her face as she turned away from Xu Xiao.

Hmph, you're just a lucky guy... How dare you talk back to me here?! Without my Martial Granduncle's method to enhance your cultivation, what threat could you possibly pose?

Turning back to the others, Guo Hongyao had to console him with a smile.

"Xu Xiao, what should their punishment be?" she asked.

Distracted by thoughts of Liu Lingzhen, Xu Xiao replied, "Someone I know is still waiting at the foot of the mountain. I need to bring her here first."

Guo Hongyao had not expected Xu Xiao to say that and suppressed her growing impatience. He shot a look at Li Xijun and snapped, "Make it quick then!"

Li Xijun saw his opportunity to escape the tension, but Guo Hongyao was not about to let him slip away. She gestured with her hand, commanding, "You stay. Let the others go."

Chen Mufeng quietly descended the mountain to fetch Liu Lingzhen, and Xu Xiao immediately rushed over on the wind to meet her.

Seeing Xu Xiao leaving Guo Hongyao's side, Li Xijun discreetly stepped aside.

Xu Xiao and Liu Lingzhen exchanged a few sweet words before Xu Xiao lifted his head and glared at Li Xijun.

Guo Hongyao, observing the exchange, furrowed her brow and asked, "Anything else?"

Li Xijun was secretly worried but felt a sudden heat at his waist—the tracking jade pendant was warming up. He discreetly covered it with his sleeve, blocking the faint glow while suppressing his delight.

The elders are coming!

As Xu Xiao was about to return to Guo Hongyao's side, Li Xijun stepped forward, deliberately stalling him with a question.

"Does Lady Liu and the Xu Family have any friends or relatives in town? Perhaps we should bring them along as well?"

Xu Xiao frowned but Liu Lingzhen seemed delighted.

"Brother Xu, isn't that wonderful? Why don't you bring all your brothers to enjoy the splendors of the immortal gate?" she suggested.

Guo Hongyao's expression soured. Sensing her displeasure, Xu Xiao quickly shook his head and said, "Haven't you seen what kind of people they are? They have no place in the immortal gate."

Growing annoyed by the couple's exchange, Guo Hongyao turned to Li Xijun and demanded, "Give me that sword!"

Li Xijun feigned reluctance, but Guo Hongyao was in no mood for further delays. With a hand gesture, the sword on Li Xijun's back rose to the air, struggling briefly before settling in her grasp.

"What a fine sword," she praised, admiring the beautiful sword that shimmered like a pool of cold water.

Yet, Li Xijun remained stoic, neither pleading nor begging her.

This vexed Guo Hongyao and she began wondering whether this punishment might have been too lenient.

Let's see how long you can put up that act!

Raised in luxury, Guo Hongyao had never known defiance; others always bent to her will. Arrogant and domineering by nature, she now turned the gleaming blade of her sharp sword toward Li Xijun, pointing it at his throat from a distance.

The silent threat was palpable, hanging heavily in the air like a promise of violence.

Just then, a hiss filled the air.

Li Wushao, transformed into his true form—a massive Hooked Serpent—glared at her dangerously with his eyes that were as large as windows.

Guo Hongyao sneered at him.

"You think you can... hmm...? Who's there?!"

Her words were cut off as a streak of violet light split the sky, illuminating the scene with a brilliant white and purple hue. Before she could react further, a cold voice thundered, "How dare you, bitch!"

Guo Hongyao was enraged. She turned to the source of the voice and her gaze landed on a female cultivator arriving on a thunderbolt.

She was clad in jade armor and matching boots, and her long hair streamed with purple lightning, casting several silver-white halos around her.

She looked nothing short of heroic.

Her voice, clear and resonant, stunned everyone.

Guo Hongyao, feeling the sting of insult, lowered the sword and stared at the approaching purple light.

Li Qinghong had traveled thousands of li, only to find her nephew threatened by a sword held by a Foundation Establishment Realm female cultivator. His subordinates appeared deeply troubled as if they were facing a formidable enemy.

Overcome with shock and rage, Li Qinghong was at a loss for words. In her fury, she opened her mouth and unleashed a beam of white light.

BOOM!

The white light swelled instantly, radiating a destructive aura. Upon contact, purple lightning cascaded down like a waterfall.

Guo Hongyao was caught off guard. The thin jade piece in her hand glowed red faintly as she reached out in a futile attempt to defend herself.

"Aunt is here!"

Li Xijun, having prepared for this moment, quickly seized the Hooked Serpent and bellowed, "Kill him first! Kill him!"

Caught by surprise, Li Wushao immediately sprung into action with his long hooks. He had actually been accumulating his strength to attack Guo Hongyao, but now swiftly changed his target to Xu Xiao as instructed.

The hooks sliced through the air with a piercing shriek.

Xu Xiao, unable to react in time, stepped back and raised a token, emitting a burst of red light. The prolonged battle had depleted his sea of qi, leaving the red light flickering weakly. As a result, the hooks easily penetrated the barrier like it was just a piece of rotten tofu.

The shields that could once defend against Foundation Establishment Realm attacks were already spent against earlier assaults.

Xu Xiao felt a crushing blow to his chest as the tail of the Hooked Serpent impaled him mercilessly.

"BROTHER XU!"

Liu Lingzhen was even slower to react. As she lunged forward, a sharp, agonizing chill ran through Xu Xiao's throat—the second tail of the Hooked Serpent had already sliced through his body, severing his head.

Xu Xiao's eyes widened with terror as the last vestiges of his consciousness flickered through his mind, replaying scenes like ephemeral dream bubbles.

Holding beauty in my arms... Trampling prestigious clans... Joining an immortal gate...

One moment he was conquering Mount Qingdu and crushing Lijing Town, and the next he was embracing Lingzhen and Hongyao in his arms.

In the end, the last thought that crossed his mind was...

Why did it end like this... Things shouldn't have gone this way...

"MERCY!"

Guo Hongyao's plea was lost in the roar of the thunderstorm, unheard over the chaos. Everyone watched as Xu Xiao's head fell, disintegrating into ashes amidst the tempest.

His death was swift; Liu Lingzhen, losing the support of the dharma wind, screamed as she plummeted downward. Every bone in her body shattered into fragments upon impact with the ground beneath her.

Li Xijun heard a faint, crisp sound in his mind, like a string snapping. The world around him remained the same yet felt utterly altered.

"Damn it!"

Guo Hongyao emerged from the maelstrom of thunder, her body wreathed in black smoke, teeth clenched in bitter fury.

Staring at Li Qinghong, she laughed through her anger.

"Good... good..."




# Chapter 543: Sun Seeker Ring

"Good... very good..." Guo Hongyao hissed as her lips trembled with rage.

Li Qinghong, holding her spear steadily, glanced around with flowing purple light and replied casually, "Yes, I agree."

"Bitch..."

Guo Hongyao could do nothing but repeat the insult. Unperturbed, Li Qinghong thrust her spear forward, transforming it into a barrage of pale purple shadows that surged forward with an overwhelming force.

Guo Hongyao shielded herself with a jade token, snarling, "How dare you ruin my plans. You will pay for this! I swear I will kill you, bitch!"

Li Qinghong found herself missing Kong Tingyun's golden mountain, wondering when her own family might craft a similar artifact, and cast Guo Hongyao a sidelong look.

By now, Li Xijun and the others had scattered, leaving only the Hooked Serpent, which glared with an ominous intensity. It had been thwarted time and time again, even failing to take down a single Qi Cultivator. With its dignity wounded, the Hooked Serpent's hatred for Guo Hongyao only grew as her disdain mounted.

Caught off guard by one of Li Qinghong's thunderous strikes, Guo Hongyao felt the blow reach her core, but her advanced techniques allowed her to circulate her qi and hold off the worst of it. Glancing warily at the menacing Hooked Serpent, a sense of fear began to creep over her.

With her hands free, Guo Hongyao performed a hand seal, only to hear Li Qinghong's voice ring out as a surge of purple light erupted before her, causing her jade token to tremble and her arm to go numb. The spell broke in her hands.

Guo Hongyao faltered as she thought in shock, How could such a minor clan produce someone this powerful?

Struggling to regain control, she shouted, "This... this was your family's fault, ruining my plans! How can you now turn around and blame me for it?!"

Growing bolder with every strike, Li Qinghong's jade armor gleamed with purple light as she spoke softly, "An Eastern Sea cultivator speaking of right and wrong...? How amusing..."

Guo Hongyao, fuming, pulled out a talisman to block Li Qinghong's onslaught, buying herself a moment to act. She quickly chanted an incantation and performed a hand seal.

The Six Ding Merging Fire Token, which had slipped from Xu Xiao's corpse and fallen into the lake, finally rose, floating toward her hand.

As the Six Ding Merging Fire Token settled into her grip, Guo Hongyao's expression turned strained, as though she were holding a scorching piece of coal. She dared to only pinch it between her two fingers as she invoked its flame.

Fssh!

The grayish-red fire flared out, barely the size of her palm—nothing like the sweeping blaze Xu Xiao had unleashed with a flick of his sleeve. However, it was enough to make Li Qinghong raise an eyebrow, as the flame, like ash blowing from a forge, quickly consumed the purple lightning without leaving a trace of it behind.

Li Wushao's expression darkened instantly; his demonic energy poured forth continuously, yet against this flame, it burned only like kindling, causing the flames to grow stronger and leaving his entire body aching faintly.

What kind of spirit fire is this? It is specifically meant to counter demonic creatures...

Meanwhile, Guo Hongyao managed to stabilize herself using the flame technique, but the air around her distorted as the fire intensified, and her own expression grew more grim. The gray flame withdrew, reconsolidating into a token, while her internal injuries from the lightning strike earlier flared up, sending pain through her organs.

She had no choice but to reveal her Dao Foundation. Flames enveloped her entirely, hanging like ribbons from her clothing, as she brought her hands together in a seal, conjuring a red light that radiated from behind her head.

Once the red light appeared, it shone intensely, blinding the two Li Family members and dulling their spiritual senses as if they were moving through thick mercury.

With the flame warding them off, Guo Hongyao took the opportunity to soar into the air, her hands covered in blisters, thinking to herself, The Six Ding Merging Fire Token is a Purple Mansion Realm artifact—it drains life and damages vitality; I cannot use it lightly. I'd better retreat for now...

Though she had grown up training on the island and had little real combat experience, she could assess the situation well enough. The two had already formed an encirclement; if she ended up in their grasp, they might not kill her, but she would certainly suffer greatly.

She spat a harsh parting threat, "You... you better hope I do not catch you next time!"

With that, she hastily ascended into the sky, flying at full speed. Once she had gained some distance and, seeing no one pursuing her, she tucked away the spirit artifact and, seething with resentment, muttered angrily, "If... if the Six Ding Merging Fire Token had not been mysteriously delayed from descending into the great void for a hundred years, there'd be no such thing as the Li Family... curse them!"

Although she had initially come to the mainland pleased to have discovered such a talent, this lightning cultivator had ruined her plans. Although she had still acquired the spirit artifact and would be rewarded on her island, her mood was significantly dampened.

When I get back, I will find out who that bitch is.

With that thought, she flew off quietly, crossing Lake Xian, and landed on a smaller, subsidiary island of Crimson Reef Island to tend to her wounds, capturing several people to restore her vitality.

Just then, one of her subordinates approached to report, "Fairy... just a few days ago, a masked male cultivator raided several of our cargo ships..."

Guo Hongyao, already furious, snapped impatiently, "Explain it clearly!"

The subordinate trembled as he replied, "This cultivator is at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm, wielding a golden hammer and following the immortal Dao, yet he employs numerous devil Dao artifacts... He acted alone, destroyed an entire immortal ship, murdered, looted... then vanished on the wind."

"Useless fools!"

Guo Hongyao usually cared little for such matters, but her anger against the Li Family left her eager to unleash her rage somewhere, and she shouted, "Notify me tomorrow before setting out to sea!"

Her subordinate hastily complied and withdrew. Guo Hongyao consumed blood qi, feeling her internal injuries gradually healing, then shut herself inside her cave dwelling and sat cross-legged to cultivate.

Taking out the Six Ding Merging Fire Token and examining it closely, she noticed the elegant, intricate black patterns on its surface. The more she looked, the more captivated she felt, and could not help but exclaim to herself, "What an extraordinary artifact... it is truly worthy of being a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual weapon! Just from its appearance alone, one can tell it is something remarkable."

She carefully stored the treasure, then sat down to regulate her breathing. As she gradually entered a meditative state, the Six Ding Merging Fire Token at her waist began to emit a faint red glow, pulsating gently as if it were breathing.

————

At Mount Qingdu.

After driving Guo Hongyao away, Li Qinghong descended back onto the mountain. Li Xijun approached her with a storage pouch and a small, golden-red ring in hand, with the Hanlin Sword already slung across his back.

As Li Qinghong struck with a thunderbolt at the critical moment, Guo Hongyao, caught off guard, had not retrieved the sword but had left it floating in mid-air. The Hanlin Sword, being spiritually attuned, drifted back to Li Xijun on its own.

Li Chengliao respectfully withdrew, and Li Qinghong listened as Li Xijun recounted the events in detail, breaking into a cold sweat. She nodded in approval, saying, "Well done... As for your speculation that this person may carry a thread of fate, how confident are you? To me, it seems he merely obtained the Purple Mansion Realm artifact without any evident effect on his mind."

Li Xijun considered her words briefly before replying with certainty, "I am quite sure. Though I did not notice it at first, looking back now, his mere appearance stirred in me an overwhelming hostility... I never once considered an open, civil discussion with him."

He paused, feeling that the events of the night were shrouded in a strange fog, and murmured, "But Chengliao... he started by trying to reason with him kindly. Had he not summoned Old Man Liu, our family's lead would have ended up there. If fate did interfere, it seems Chengliao was affected far less."

"Or perhaps... something else altogether influenced Chengliao..."

The two pondered this for a while, then Li Qinghong spoke in a low voice, "Maybe another perspective is worth considering: was Xu Xiao's death also destined? Could his death have ensured the Six Ding Merging Fire Token would land in Guo Hongyao's hands? Even if he had not died, he might not have parted with the artifact."

Li Xijun mulled over the sequence of events before asking, "Aunt, did you bring back the immortal mirror?"

"Of course I did. With such an extended stay overseas, Yuanjiao insisted."

Li Qinghong then produced the mirror.

Li Xijun nodded. "In that case, if Xu Xiao was indeed under a destined path, he would not have died here naturally. But since Auntie wielded the mirror, it fell outside the threads of fate and disturbed its influence, leading to his swift end."

Li Qinghong raised her brows in slight confusion and said gently, "Then why would a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Crimson Reef Island not claim the Six Ding Merging Fire Token themselves? Not much time has passed since it fell from the great void..."

Li Xijun looked down.

"My guess is that Guo Hongyao was the nearest Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator of Crimson Reef Island, but given the changes to the situation, the artifact is now beyond fate's grasp. But what still puzzles me... is how Xu Xiao advanced so quickly, rising to such a significant level within only a year or so. Even Chu Yi took over a decade to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, and Xu Xiao's skills fall short by comparison."

The two exchanged a silent look. Although they had rid themselves of him, the entire family had been thrown into disarray. Li Qinghong took out the storage pouch, sifting through a stack of overseas pills and talismans.

"It seems the Six Ding Merging Fire Token contains its own storage; otherwise, Xu Xiao would not have amassed such wealth."

These items did not pique her interest. She only picked up the small, golden-red ring, roughly the width of a pinky finger, and neither metallic nor silver in appearance. Despite her experience, she could not discern anything special about it. The ring emitted a hazy red glow, and a faint inscription in small characters read: "Sun Seeker Ring, by Lu Jiangxian of the Green Pine Temple."

"A relic from the ancient Green Pine Temple—how exceedingly ancient. It is probably best not to display it openly." Li Qinghong praised the ring briefly, unable to gauge its grade but guessing it was likely a unique flying shuttle. Just as she was about to store it, the Immortal Mirror on the table suddenly burst with a dazzling light.

The radiance was brilliant and clear, as if the sun had risen over the land, casting beams of resplendent light that filled the room. Unlike the mirror's usual cool, moon-like glow, it now emanated the warmth of a vast desert sun, filling the chamber with a fragrance of gardenias.

"Ah!"

Li Qinghong cried out involuntarily, swiftly joining her hands to raise the mirror. She looked up to see the Sun Seeker Ring trembling as if it were crying or laughing in joy, shaking free of Li Xijun's grip and leaping into the air instantly, also bursting forth in radiant light.

The room grew stifling hot in an instant, with golden sands cascading down from above, filling the chamber. Faintly, the chirping of orioles and the calls of deer could be heard, accompanied by the soft jingle of camel bells.

Clang!

At the moment the golden light appeared, every plant on Mount Qingdu swelled with vigor, animals filled with vitality, and vegetation flourished. In the underground chamber, a sweaty Li Ximing suddenly looked relieved, his aura surging rapidly.

The light swiftly spread throughout the area. The Sun Seeker Ring on the table gave a gentle roll, and the mysterious energy abruptly receded, disappearing without a trace.

————

The inner world of the mirror...

As Lu Jiangxian followed Li Qinghong on her return, his expansive divine sense stretched out, observing the Li Family estate just as Guo Hongyao was descending. Scanning the area, he detected no trace of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

Meanwhile, an ethereal golden aura shrouded the once-proud Xu Xiao, now faint and diminishing like water evaporating under the sun. On the other hand, the Six Ding Merging Fire Token in Guo Hongyao's hand pulsed subtly with an unnatural liveliness that didn't belong to an ordinary spirit artifact.

One glance told Lu Jiangxian everything he needed to know.

"This spirit artifact is far from ordinary... There must be some sinister aspect to it. Xu Xiao—he was likely just a source for its sustenance. Perhaps he once held a thread of fate, but after this ordeal, he has been nearly drained dry by this artifact."

With that, Lu Jiangxian figured out everything: it was likely that the spirit artifact or its master had forcibly accelerated Xu Xiao's cultivation, feeding him various elixirs to artificially raise his cultivation, only to drain him dry afterward. Now, having been taken by Guo Hongyao, she too was unlikely to escape a grim fate.

A Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact that can traverse the great void—it could have returned to Crimson Reef Island at any time. It seems to be deliberately avoiding other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators by wandering outside.

Considering how the artifact's influence eroded the mind, Lu Jiangxian concluded that Guo Hongyao might not even survive the journey back. He glanced at her briefly and dismissed her from his thoughts. Instead, he focused on observing the changes in Xu Xiao's condition while the last vestiges of life remained in him.

"Too bad I cannot establish contact with him directly. If I could access his memories, I'd likely find a wealth of information—perhaps even techniques from the Merging Fire system."

The Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual, Purple Mansion Realm Edition, that he held in his hands was nearly complete, though since he had not personally cultivated it, his understanding of the text fell short of the original author's insights. The Purple Mansion Realm section could barely pass as adequate.

Just then, Li Xijun approached from outside, holding a golden red ring. As Lu Jiangxian's divine sense scanned it, he read the small inscription inside the ring and froze.

"Lu Jiangxian of Green Pine Temple...! I... was a disciple of the Green Pine Temple?! That's...!"

For the first time, the hazy layers of his inner world began to lift, and the space filled with countless rays of golden light. Lu Jiangxian stood there, momentarily stunned, gazing at the sky now painted in vibrant hues. He took in the name of the artifact, chewing over it slowly.

"The Sun Seeker Ring..?"

As the Sun Seeker Ring radiated golden light, fragments of his memories flickered within Lu Jiangxian's mind, hazy and veiled in mist. He saw, faintly, mountain peaks blanketed in pine and vast plains stretching as far as the eye could see.

Strange. The Green Pine Temple ruins are supposed to be on a coastal island... Why do I see endless plains?

A brief wave of confusion swept over him, only to be drowned out by the subsequent flood of indistinct memories.

"Green Pine Temple... Yingze..."

For a brief moment, he froze, but the memories evaporated like mist, as though forcibly erased by some unseen power. Lu Jiangxian muttered a curse under his breath, his face flushing with frustration.

At that moment, the golden light above grew brighter, becoming a piercing, almost blinding white. His consciousness reeled back from its intensity, unable to withstand the blazing radiance. The Sun Seeker Ring itself transmitted an eager, jubilant energy, like that of a child discovering a new plaything. It cast a fragment of golden light.

The beam drifted down like a bird and settled in his palm. Surrounding him, ethereal sounds began to echo around him—birdsong, the calls of deer...

This strange golden light seemed to emerge from a narrow aperture, projecting outward in a cone shape. Its sharp point grew so intensely bright that it turned white, trembling as it connected with the great void beyond.

Lu Jiangxian stared at the golden light in stunned silence, barely able to process what he saw. Almost speechless, he managed to murmur out in astonishment.

"Bright Yang Metallic Essence..?!"




# Chapter 545: Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence

In front of him, the golden light spread out in countless radiances, drifting through the air lightly. Lu Jiangxian held it in his hand, feeling a warm, gentle sensation, as numerous illusions unfolded beside him, with all kinds of colors streaming gracefully.

These visions alternated between scenes of union between men and women, sparrows taking flight, and orioles chirping, to resplendent bursts of light, lonely smoke rising, and even images of emperors in reverence, receiving crowns and ascending thrones. Ultimately, they transformed into a pure, glowing orb.

A sudden insight dawned within him: this metallic essence was fully named Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence, embodying growth, union, the harmony of male and female, celestial light, bright fire... all things related to the Bright Yang.

"The Sun Seeker Ring is indeed unusual... It is likely that Xu Xiao extracted it from the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. As for how it came to be within that token, I'd need to get my hands on the Purple Mansion Realm artifact to truly understand!" Lu Jiangxian pondered aloud.

His mind had already begun to linger on the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. As the metallic essence danced in his hand, a wealth of insights came to him—this essence could be used to transform demonic creatures, influence fate, and establish bonds between individuals. Its potential was powerful and expansive.

"So, this is the nature of metallic essence... it is astonishing to witness such marvels from just a single wisp!"

Holding the wisp of Bright Yang Metallic Essence, Lu Jiangxian's initial amazement faded into a more pragmatic contemplation of how he might use it.

"First of all, this must not be given to anyone else..."

He quickly dismissed the idea of bestowing it upon anyone in the Li Family, because even if they had the capacity to wield it, this single wisp would likely cause significant trouble if released!

If his guess was correct—if this metallic essence were to fall into the world, it would instantly lead to unchecked indulgence, spontaneous births, rampant growth of all things, and finally transform into a monstrous evil, bringing about wanton killing and attracting the wrath of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

"After all, metallic essence is a rare treasure to a cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm, especially when the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment seems to be within the possession of Mount Luoxia..." Lu Jiangxian mumbled.

Having seen both the Six Ding Merging Fire Token and the Bright Yang Metallic Essence, Lu Jiangxian began to formulate deeper insights. The crafting of Purple Mansion Realm artifacts was likely closely tied to metallic essences.

The Six Ding Merging Fire Token, for example, might have been forged through Merging Fire and thereby imbued with the qualities of a malevolent creature, which would explain its peculiar effects.

"If that is the case, then the Sun Seeker Ring contains the Bright Yang essence, while the Six Ding Merging Fire Token likely embodies the Merging Fire essence. By that logic, this mirror... should also contain an essence..."

Lu Jiangxian pondered thoughtfully to himself, recalling the mirror's continuous outpouring of Supreme Yin Moonlight as he speculated further, "It seems undeniably to be of Supreme Yin essence... Judging by its abundance, could it contain the entire Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment? It's definitely more than just Supreme Yin, given how the Supreme Yin Moonlight flows endlessly; like an unending stream."

Lu Jiangxian had traveled widely over the last century, studying countless texts, yet he had never encountered a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in the Supreme Yin system. The few Supreme Yin and Lesser Yin methods he found were of low grade, with none capable of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm.

He had never heard of a Golden Core Realm cultivator in the Supreme Yin system either; only one ancient immortal called Yingze seemed possibly related to Supreme Yin or Yang systems, but that was several millennia ago.

"At the very least, this Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual could be refined a few more times!"

Looking over the Bright Yang Metallic Essence in his hand which was emanating a gentle warmth, Lu Jiangxian thought to himself, With this metallic essence in hand, I finally have some influence over the external world, though I must be cautious and remain discreet to avoid attracting the attention of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

After some deliberation, he acknowledged both the advantages and disadvantages of wielding the Bright Yang Metallic Essence. It could potentially manifest as divine light to injure enemies, but such use would squander its value, and he resolved to employ it sparingly.

As for members of the Li Family pursuing this path, there were no other Dao Partners in Yue State, and the Wei-Li bloodline obscured things well enough to prevent suspicion.

Only the north presented a concern as he thought silently, The Mahas in the north harbor an unshakable blood feud with the Wei-Li Clan, and now Mount Luoxia also has designs on Bright Yang Metallic Essence... the north is best avoided!

Fortunately, the Mahas seldom venture south unless they are reincarnated, and Luoxia remains aloof, unlikely to meddle across vast distances. The Eastern Sea contains several Bright Yang Dao lineages, so issues should be minimal.

Drawing his thoughts back from the metallic essence in hand, Lu Jiangxian began to reflect on the yield from his journey to the Eastern Sea.

During the trip, he accompanied the Li Family, but spent most of his time drifting on the sea, rarely disembarking. When they did find the Green Pine Temple ruins, they bore traces of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, so Lu Jiangxian refrained from peering in too deeply.

Nevertheless, he had managed to gather a considerable number of techniques which supplemented his understanding of Metallic Essence, allowing him to piece together some key insights.

"Many of the techniques had ancient origins, often containing references to Metallic Essence Fruition Attainments."

These findings often mentioned various Yin and Yang Fruition Attainments. Some sources referred to three Yin and four Yang, while others cited five Yin and four Yang. However, one fact seemed consistent—Yin and Yang Fruition Attainments were not equal in number.

Similarly, many Fruition Attainments seemed isolated, and suspiciously so. For example, Shamanic Talisman, Jade True, and Merging Owl... these Metallic Essences emerged independently and it was rare to find more than one associated cultivation technique.

With these questions resting in the back of his mind, he was quietly contemplating when a familiar feedback suddenly came from the link within the great void. Lu Jiangxian understood immediately.

Li Ximing has broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm!

At the time, Li Ximing had been cultivating on Mount Qingdu when the Bright Yang Essence had brushed past him. He cultivated the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual, the Bright Yang system. This was equivalent to having a peak Purple Mansion Realm expert use their divine abilities to secure his breakthrough. With the opportunity laid so plainly before him and if he still could not advance, he might as well find a rock to hit his head on.

"This child is indeed fortunate..."

Were it not that Li Ximing lacked any apparent thread of fate, Lu Jiangxian might have really thought he was a Fated One.

Born into a clan, nurtured by his entire family, innately gifted for alchemy, with a penchant for secluded cultivation that keeps him from venturing out unless in the direst circumstances... He seems almost like a Fated One. Throughout the entire clan, only he has hope of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm.

Returning his focus to the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual before him, Lu Jiangxian was confident that with the assistance of the metallic essence, he could elevate the manual to an even higher level!

Once this manual is refined, I can explore combining Metallic Essence with talisman qi!

Time in the mirror world always seemed to flow like water. Back then, Lu Jiangxian always felt lonely and bored, now, time felt almost scarce.

Qingdu Cave Dwelling.

The Sun Seeker Ring spun once in midair before it lightly drifted down again. As it settled, all the extraordinary visions within the cave dwelling disappeared. Li Xijun caught the ring and examined it closely. It looked no different from before, and its materials remained indistinct. It also felt surprisingly light in his hand.

Inspecting it with his spiritual sense, the Sun Seeker Ring seemed quite ordinary, almost as if it were just a simple flying shuttle, though its materials were unknown. If Li Xijun had not witnessed the speed at which Xu Xiao rode on it, he never would have guessed it was a treasured artifact.

Nearby, Li Qinghong checked the mirror, finding no anomalies either. Li Xijun murmured, "Aunt... this should not be a bad thing."

"Indeed..." Li Qinghong nodded. The two studied the artifact for a while but gained no further insights.

Li Xijun then added, "Aunt, the altar described in your thunder technique has been completed... It has not been used since you went abroad. Now that you are back, you could test out the Celestial Thunder."

Li Qinghong cultivated an ancient technique, with an immortal foundation capable of summoning thunder from the heavens. Yet, with heaven and earth undergoing such changes, she was not certain if the attempt would work. After nodding lightly, she put away the Sun Seeker Ring and returned the immortal mirror.

With everything finally in order, Li Xijun felt no regret about the lost opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, having secured so many other crucial items. After leaving, he flew for a while before landing in Lijing Town.

Kneeling figures lined the steps of the central hall, and a cursory glance revealed many familiar faces, mostly from the Liu and Xu families, all bowing their heads with sobs filling the air.

Seeing this, Li Xijun descended, and a Liu Family member immediately crawled over, tearfully recounting old ties and grievances. Li Xijun offered polite comfort before quickly moving along.

As he approached, the Jade Court Guards on both sides kneeled in respect. He stepped into the central hall, which was simply but elegantly arranged. At the highest seat sat a middle-aged man with a square face and broad forehead.

Li Xijun greeted, "Elder Brother."

This was Li Xicheng, the current head of the family, who had served as the leader for several years. His experience had granted him a more tempered demeanor. He greeted his approaching younger brother with a quiet voice, "It's been a while since I last saw you... The Liu and Xu families have been kneeling here for an entire night. What do you think, Eighth Brother?"

Li Xijun stepped back and, with a gesture, replied respectfully, "Elder Brother manages the family, and I would not presume to advise."

Li Xicheng smiled, straightening his posture.

"The Liu Family will not receive heavy punishment; a night of kneeling is enough. They have fallen far and have little left to penalize. Let them disperse. As for the Xu Family, I plan to split them into branches. Xu Xiao is dead, and his lineage will be removed from the records. The other Xu branches, having reported the devil cultivator, will receive rewards."

He continued, "Captain Chen was killed by Commander Chen Mufeng himself. We will report that he died from devil cultivation techniques. His family will receive protection, and Chen Mufeng will be demoted from a battalion commander to a court guard."

Li Xijun listened as his elder brother went on, "As for Elder Qiuyang, I sent him a reward, but he declined it and returned to farming... I can only pass it down to his son. Elder Qiuyang has contributed immensely, though none of his children have any spiritual orifice. He has received all the recognition we can offer, but with his dao path severed... there is little else we can give him."

Li Xijun nodded.

"Elder Brother handles these matters well; I need not say more. As for Chengliao, there are additional rewards coming from the mountain."

They spoke a while longer until Li Xijun cupped his fist, sensing weariness beneath his brother's composed demeanor. After dismissing the Jade Court Guards, he spoke gently, "Elder Brother, appoint more assistants if needed... Do not exhaust yourself. Your health is important, as is maintaining your cultivation."

Li Xicheng hesitated before nodding slowly, his gaze dropping.

"I personally promoted Chen Mufeng... I bear some responsibility for this outcome," he said softly with a regretful sigh.

Li Xijun was about to say something when he saw a servant from the Clan Affairs Courtyard approaching. The servant bowed deeply and said, "The old clan head has summoned the two of you."

"Uncle Yuanping?"

The two brothers exchanged a glance, realizing something was amiss, and their expressions turned grave. Li Xicheng then whispered, "I will go up the mountain right away."

Neither dared to delay. They hurried up the mountain, and indeed, a solemn air greeted them. Entering the courtyard, they saw people coming and going. As they stepped into the inner courtyard, they saw someone lying on a bed.

Li Yuanping's face was pale as he leaned against the edge of the bed. Li Qinghong sat beside him, while his wife, Madam Ren, who had only reached the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, sat nearby. She was in her forties, with a few wrinkles lining her face, and she was quietly sobbing.

The two kneeled in fear, and Li Yuanping scanned them briefly. Though his voice was weak, it remained gentle.

"Years ago, my brother and I kneeled before Ancestor Tongya's bed. His words still echo in my ears... In the blink of an eye, I cannot hold on any longer."

Li Xijun and Li Xicheng offered quiet words of comfort. Having studied under him for many years, Li Xicheng felt a deeper bond with him and could not help but tear up. Li Yuanping then asked, "Where is Li Ximing?"

Bracing himself, Li Xijun replied, "Brother Ming is currently in seclusion, breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

Li Yuanping gazed into the distance, his lips pale as he whispered, "It's alright then..."

Madam Dou supported him, stricken with grief. She was Li Xuanxuan's primary wife and had managed the household for a period of time. Now, at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, she had reached her limit, with no path forward.

Madam Dou had borne two sons for Li Xuanxuan. One by one, both had died before her eyes. Decades ago, she had bid farewell to Li Yuanxiu, and now she was about to lose Li Yuanping as well. Her hair had turned white, and she was powerless.

Li Yuanping glanced around, many words left unsaid, and could only murmur quietly, "Cheng'er, from now on... you will have to rely on yourself."

Li Xicheng could no longer hold back his tears. He bowed deeply while kneeling, striking his head on the ground twice. Li Yuanping waved a hand, silencing him, then looked toward Li Xijun, "Xijun, I will have to trouble you to clean up Ming'er's mess... When the elders are gone, the family will depend on you."

Li Xijun lifted his head, locking eyes with Li Yuanping. He understood that Yuanping knew everything. His brows relaxed, and he replied softly, "Xijun has only done what the younger generation should do."

Li Yuanping let out a faint, hollow laugh, his voice weakening, "Elder Sister, I entrust the family affairs to you and Brother."

He gradually sank down, a faint, almost inaudible sigh escaping from his throat.

"Ancestor, it is not that I have failed you... the heavens simply did not grant me more time..."

In the stillness that followed, the light in his eyes dimmed. Beside his pillow lay two handwritten books, which Li Qinghong, wiping away her tears, picked up. One was titled Tales of the Desert, a compilation of notes left by Li Jingtian, and the other was A Chronicle of Thirty-Two Years of Household Management.

He had only ordinary cultivation, worked tirelessly his entire life, and left behind no secret manuals or rare techniques. The only books he wrote contained merely his lifetime observations. Li Qinghong carefully put them away and rose to her feet.

Those kneeling below remained silent. Li Qinghong surveyed them and spoke softly, "Arrange everything well... I will take him to the ancestral hall."

Li Xicheng nodded with a choked reply while Li Xijun stood frozen to the spot, staring at Li Yuanping's hand, as if recalling something. His hand slowly caressed the Hanlin sword without a word.

Li Qinghong then ascended on the wind and entered the ancestral hall, first reading the two books before storing them on top of a table.

The ancestral hall remained as quiet as ever. Rows upon rows of memorial tablets lined the walls, with incense smoke flowing between them. Li Qinghong stood silently for a moment, then spoke softly, "Grandfather... My brother and I have both reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, yet without you here, the family feels unsteady, and our hearts are empty."

Li Qinghong had heard every word Li Yuanping spoke on his deathbed. The sadness lingered in her heart. Usually reserved, she rarely spoke so much, but she muttered to the tablet of Li Tongya for a while before finally leaving in silence.

She did not have time to dwell on her grief. She bathed, changed clothes, and lit incense, praying continuously for three months to prepare to ascend the altar.




# Chapter 547: Seizing The Light, Capturing The Flame

The Li Family conducted a modest funeral with all members clad in white mourning garments. Following the deceased's will, Li Xicheng kept the ceremonies understated. However, King Li Jiman of Mount Yue hurried back and mourned with evident sorrow.

Whether his grief was genuine or not, he at least showed the necessary respect. Li Xicheng helped him to his feet, observing that he had reached the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, which was proof that he had been diligently training over the years.

Yet, in today's Li Family, a Qi Cultivator was no longer a key asset, and was merely part of the middle ranks that were in charge of helping with routine tasks. Each position on the spirit mountains was highly competitive, and recently, the Jade Court Guards counted dozens of Qi Cultivators. At this level, his cultivation was far from exceptional.

Li Xijun kept vigil in the mountains for two months. One day, he looked up to see the sky ablaze with the dazzling sun, with not a single cloud in sight. Raising his arm, he dusted off his sleeve, flicking away traces of ash.

A thousand li of lake waves... where could this sandstorm have come from?

Suddenly, he paused, a look of astonishment crossing his face as he thought to himself, Brother Ming has succeeded!

Li Xijun hurried down the mountain, where he indeed found the entrance of the cave dwelling radiating golden light. The wind whistled softly, and a young man stood inside, hands clasped behind him, his face youthful.

Streams of golden light and flame wove around him as he stepped forward with a smile and announced, "I have established my Dao Foundation! Six years of cultivation, and now, twenty-seven years in total—I have achieved the Radiant Origin Pass."

Li Ximing had broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm half a month prior, spending some time stabilizing his cultivation before finally emerging from his seclusion. In front of him, Li Xijun calculated the time, surprised. "Only... about three years?! Was it difficult, or did it just come naturally? How did it happen so fast?!"

Li Ximing paused, considering, then replied, "At first, it was very difficult... Gathering my power was exhausting. Even with high hopes, I had expected it to take at least five years. But just a few months ago, I suddenly had visions filled with golden light. My Immortal Foundation began consolidating on its own, progressing at dozens of times the speed of my own efforts, until it was fully formed... I do not know what caused it."

As Li Xijun listened on, the golden light jogged his memory of the Sun Seeker Ring. With his thoughts churning, he looked on as Li Ximing began proudly explaining, "This Immortal Foundation is called the Radiant Origin Pass. It draws down heavenly light and captures flame, allows one to tread upon beams of light, banish evil, dispel calamities, nurture life, and... and..."

He paused, catching himself in his moment of pride, then continued more seriously, "Its main abilities include two great wonders. The first is Seizing Celestial Light, which could channel heavenly light into spells, surpassing most dharma lights."

He performed a hand seal and the light in his hand transformed into a vibrant, brilliant gold, appearing almost as if he had mastered some special spell.

Li Xijun, having been trained in perception technique, stared directly at it without averting his gaze, nodding approvingly. Li Ximing continued, "The second ability, called Bright Yang Gate, summons a blazing gate that can suppress enemies. The more one's cultivation advances, the taller and more imposing this gate becomes."

He laughed, adding, "As for manipulating fire, the blending of yin and yang, treading on beams of light—those are minor techniques, not worth mentioning!"

After all, the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual was a Grade Four technique. The Immortal Foundation it formed was formidable, offering comprehensive enhancement across all aspects. Although it lacked a specialized technique, it still surpassed Grade Three techniques by a significant margin.

He was brimming with pride, so much so that he failed to notice the white mourning clothes draped throughout the mountain until he finally caught sight of Li Xijun's sorrowful expression, causing him to realize belatedly.

"This is..."

He froze.

Li Xijun sighed, saying, "Please accept my condolences, Seventh Brother."

Li Ximing's sleeves trembled as he came to the painful realization.

"Oh..."

His voice immediately choked with emotion. The joy in his heart dissipated, leaving him standing there in stunned silence for a few moments before asking, "When did it happen...? Has Father already been laid to rest?"

He murmured two questions, then began to cry, descending with Li Xijun as they landed on the mountainside. Li Ximing lamented, "Eighth Brother... I only wanted to put it off until after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm to see him again."

Since that terrible argument after returning from the Xiao Family, Li Ximing had not seen his father again. Li Yuanping, filled with disappointment, had stubbornly refrained from seeking him out. Li Ximing, fearing the encounter, put it off day by day, unwilling to face his father's expression. He had not expected that this delay would stretch into years, until his father had already passed away without them ever meeting again.

Walking through the graveyard now, gazing at the rows of gray headstones, Li Ximing's face was wet with tears, his entire body trembling from head to toe. Cold sweat clung to his skin, unceasing.

He continued until he reached Li Yuanping's tombstone. The inscription was newly engraved, detailing his life's achievements. Li Ximing kneeled down weakly before it, and Li Xijun silently stepped back, intending to give him some privacy. But unexpectedly, Li Ximing choked out softly, "...Stay..."

So Li Xijun remained, standing quietly. In front of him, Li Ximing seemed more lost and fearful than truly sorrowful, crumpled before the gravestone. He kneeled there for a long time, until the full moon rose and soft raindrops began to fall from the sky, pattering down onto the earth. Only then did he snap out of his daze.

Li Ximing leaped up in a panic, glancing around before bolting away as if fleeing, rising into the wind in an unsteady flight back to his cave dwelling. Twice he stumbled over the doorstep, nearly falling flat against the stone table inside.

On the table lay a stack of small letters, each placed there by others outside his secluded chamber during his period of seclusion. Dazed, he picked one up, which read, "When will Ximing emerge from seclusion? The family's stock of thirteen types of medicinal pills requires sorting and distribution. If you have any free time, please come to see me."

The handwriting was firm, deliberate, suggesting careful thought. It was signed by his father, Li Yuanping, roughly six months earlier. He pulled out another letter, "If Ximing emerges from seclusion, please come see me."

This letter was more recent, only three months old. Li Ximing continued reading through all fifteen letters. Each was shorter and more urgent than the last.

The final letter was dated just half a month ago. At last, Li Yuanping no longer addressed him by his full name. His handwriting, no longer neat, was crooked and uneven, with just a simple message, "My son, come quickly."

Previously, Li Ximing had felt only a vague numbness, with little real grief. But now, a surge of anguish rose within him, overwhelming and relentless, as he realized the full weight of these words.

He dropped the letter as if struck, gasping, "Father... Father... I was wrong... Father..."

His mind thundered, and everything around him began to spin, intensifying the agony within his mind and body. His whole body, from his fingers to his toes, shook uncontrollably as the world fell silent.

Thud.

Gradually, Li Ximing regained awareness, finding himself slumped over the table. With both arms spread wide, he gathered up the letters, clutching at them and scattering them over the floor. One letter remained caught on his sleeve, the four small characters on it unbearable to read.

He was lost in a haze for just a moment before his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation restored his clarity. He stood still, his face pale and expression blank.
𝙛𝒓𝓮𝙚𝔀𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝒐𝒎

All this time, he had been too afraid to see his father, choosing instead to wait for his father to summon him.

However, Li Yuanping had held out stubbornly until the end. In the fading light of his life, he had gone from issuing orders under pretense, to subtly inviting, to pleading for his son's presence, and finally...to a sorrowful, dying gasp. Yet, not a single word had reached Li Ximing.

His mind was a blur, filled with confusion, but at last, he understood—those things he had been too afraid to face were now lost, and he would never have the chance to face them again.




# Chapter 548: Escorting and Slaying Demons

Yi Mountain City.

A towering fortress stood firmly against the mountain, with streams of light flowing over it. A middle-aged man, clad in black-gold spirit armor, stood upon a golden shuttle, his sharp gaze under furrowed brows fixed on the distant horizon—keen as a falcon's.

His armor, dark and glistening with black-gold scales, blended seamlessly with the golden bow on his back. Beneath him, his diamond-shaped flying shuttle radiated a sharp golden Astral Qi.

Years of experience had tempered his once-unchecked ambition. His gaze was now slightly lowered, his eyes half-closed, with a calmness that concealed his sharp resolve, his spirit refined and poised for action.

Li Xuanfeng rose on the wind from the city walls, hovering for a moment. In the distant sea of trees, demons circled but showed no sign of advancing. He returned to the wall where a group of young, unfamiliar faces approached him from below.

Only one middle-aged man moved forward, his appearance dignified and scholarly. He spoke softly, "Brother Feng, Fairy of the Autumn Lake is waiting in the city."

Most of those who had followed him south all those years ago had married, had children, and become casualties in repeated battles, devoured by demons. Only Fei Yihe remained at his side, now in his seventies, yet still cautious of taking a higher step in his cultivation.

Although the Azure Pond Sect had never commented directly, the tragic massacre of the Fei Family years ago still remained vivid in his memory, so Fei Yihe dared not act recklessly. Li Xuanfeng nodded, not surprised at all.

If Ning Wan has come, then the Daoist Master must have emerged from seclusion.

Li Xuanfeng's armored boots rang crisply as they struck the ground. Riding the wind down, he soon spotted a woman standing by a small stall in the marketplace, gazing at the wares with interest.

Ning Wan had a unique presence. Although she used an Azure Pond's spell to mask her cultivation, Li Xuanfeng, with his Spirit Eye Perception, sensed her cultivation level with a mere glance. With their cultivation close in level, he approached and greeted her softly, "Xuanfeng greets Senior."

Ning Wan, now at the peak of Foundation Establishment Realm and nearing the Purple Mansion Realm, looked back at him with a gentle smile.

"Not bad... So, when are you planning to enter seclusion for your breakthrough?"

Li Xuanfeng, who had been refining his cultivation since reaching the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm long ago, responded, "I fear my foundation may be unstable... there is no rush for a breakthrough."

Ning Wan nodded, smiling brightly.

"I have seen your archery skills! Thinking back, when that Golden Tang Gate disciple came south all those years ago, it was you who defeated him, was it not?" she asked with a knowing smile.

Li Xuanfeng had not expected her to bring up old events, but now it mattered little. He murmured an apology, while Ning Wan nodded and said, "You were so young then, yet you had already grasped the essence of the bow... At the time, I thought it was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's doing, influenced as I was by Man On Creek or Jiang Boqing's influence. But... it seems fate works strangely, and it led us to cross paths here."

Remembering those days, Li Xuanfeng felt a pang of melancholy, though he showed no outward change in his expression. Ning Wan continued, "There is some news I should share with you."

"I will be glad to hear it," Li Xuanfeng quickly replied, instantly focusing his attention on her.

Ning Wan shook her head and said, "From the overseas Crimson Reef Island, there was a female cultivator of the main bloodline, named Guo Hongyao. She flew to your family's territory and caused quite a scene... Apparently, she wanted to take someone as her disciple, but things did not go well on either side, and they parted on poor terms."

"Crimson Reef Island..?"

The mention of family matters instantly grabbed Li Xuanfeng's attention.

Ning Wan gave him a knowing look, speaking softly, "As she returned overseas, the female cultivator suffered a severe ambush, barely escaping her own territory with her life. She managed to escape with talismans, but her prized artifact was stolen. The perpetrator was outrageously bold, and Crimson Reef Island has already dispatched people to investigate."

Ning Wan's lips curved in a slight smile, clearly amused by the news. Then, she suddenly added, "With the Green Pine Temple Ruins involved, the Crimson Reef Island will likely not investigate thoroughly. The injury to that female cultivator though, will likely set her back for decades with little hope of progress."

Li Xuanfeng froze momentarily, his brows knitting in thought.

"To have robbed a direct disciple of an immortal sect on their own turf... Who would be so daring?"

Ning Wan smiled without responding. The two flew together for a while, then landed in unison in front of Yuan Su's cave dwelling, as if by mutual understanding. They passed the oddly-shaped bronze beasts in the courtyard, surrounded by a swirling white mist that chilled their ankles. Daoist Master Yuan Su lay relaxed on a stone platform up ahead.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

The both of them greeted as they cupped their fists respectfully.

Daoist Master Yuan Su's face appeared smooth and round, always lacking any sense of intimidation, and now seemed even more otherworldly. A faint golden seal swayed at his waist.

Li Xuanfeng and Ning Wan bowed respectfully. With a wave of his hand, Yuan Su gestured for them to rise, asking, "Wan'er... how are matters proceeding?"

Ning Wan answered with deference, "Honored Ancestor, those who were suspected of bearing a thread of fate have all received the news of Green Pine Temple and have each made their way to the sea. No complications..."

"Hmm."

Yuan Su nodded, his fingers resting on the seal.

"After all, the descent of Fruition Attainment from Mount Luoxia has drawn together a few threads of fate—it is to be expected. If these individuals can stand out, whether they truly bear a thread of fate or not, at least they have some skill... They should be able to bring back something from the ruins."

Ning Wan nodded and continued in a soft voice, "However... there is one major development. Daoist Master Suiguan recently visited Crimson Reef Island and then Golden Feather Sect, where Zhang Tianyuan personally saw him off with great respect."

Daoist Master Suiguan was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had mysteriously emerged from the lifeless, emerald waters of the Azure Pond Grotto Heaven. Yuan Su's expression darkened at the news, muttering, "What is he up to now?!"

Yuan Su found dealing with Suiguan exasperating. While Chi Buzi, despite his foul temper, was at least a familiar face and manageable with his not-so-high cultivation, Suiguan was utterly unpredictable.

Yuan Su had hidden himself in Yi Mountain City and even gone into seclusion to avoid encountering Suiguan. Now, upon hearing of him again, his expression soured. After a brief pause, Ning Wan hesitated, then continued somewhat awkwardly, "It is rumored, according to the Chi Family, that he... took a portion of..."

She abruptly stopped speaking, but Yuan Su waved his hand, speaking softly, "Go ahead... say it freely."

As such, Ning Wan continued, "...a portion of Profound Radiant Dual Essence Qi."

Yuan Su sat up, contemplating this information for a moment, then remarked, "Ah... yes, it must be Profound Radiant Qi. Only something of that nature would compel Suiguan to personally make the trip to Golden Feather Sect... He is at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm... could he be attempting to break through to the Golden Core Realm?"

He made this deduction before furrowing his brows and reconsidering, "No... that does not seem right."

The two below remained silent. Yuan Su soon regained his composure, falling quiet before he looked over to Li Xuanfeng and nodded approvingly, "Not bad... You are progressing faster than I expected."

"All thanks to the Daoist Master's guidance," Li Xuanfeng responded politely as he offered his thanks. Over the past decade, Yuan Su had indeed been generous to him, providing spirit armor, precious medicines, Golden Stone Qi, and secret techniques—essentially treating him as a junior disciple.

If not for the sensitivity of these items, which Yuan Su had bestowed upon him directly, Li Xuanfeng would have sent some of them to his family. In fact, Yuan Su's kindness only made him feel more uneasy.

Yuan Su watched him thoughtfully for a moment, then said softly, "Very well. Your current strength is respectable enough to carry some authority. Take a trip to the Eastern Sea and handle two matters for me."

Li Xuanfeng was overjoyed, responding eagerly, "Daoist Master, please give me your instructions!"

He was overjoyed for two reasons. First, he had been confined to this place for decades, and now he finally had the opportunity to venture out. Second, Yuan Su finally had a task for him. Without a purpose, the powerful spells and spirit treasures he had received felt almost burdensome, yet refusing them had never been an option.

Accepting the assignment promptly, Yuan Su explained, "First, I have a group of my disciples needing escorts to Splitreed Island. That sea region has been turbulent recently, and Ning Wan cannot act freely, so you should take this trip."

He added a cautionary note, "Do not stir up trouble; just deliver them safely. If you do encounter resistance, feel free to kill anyone who is not of the dragon clan."

Seeing Li Xuanfeng nodding in understanding, Yuan Su continued, "Once you reach Splitreed Island, continue northward until you reach Unison Sea. There, a market run by my Ning Family has been harassed by a demon. Deal with it on your way back."

"Do we know what it is...?" Li Xuanfeng asked.

Yuan Su promptly replied, "No need for concern. It is only a water-dwelling monkey... a threat to ordinary folks but not to you."

Securing the jade seal at his waist, Yuan Su added softly, "I noticed it has been years since you returned home. Make the most of it and reconnect with your family."

"Thank you, Daoist Master!" Li Xuanfeng expressed his gratitude, and as he saw Yuan Su wave him off, he quietly departed.

After a brief pause, Ning Wan said softly, "Daoist Master... Li Xuanfeng's cultivation has advanced rapidly in recent years. It seems it was merely the lack of resources and techniques in the Li Family that slowed him down. He had achieved nothing remarkable before his breakthrough to the late Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Well, he is a descendant of the Wei-Li lineage," Yuan Su replied, "If he practiced a Bright Yang-aligned path, he would progress even faster... A thousand years ago, the Wei-Li lineage's affinity with metallic essence was impressive—that was akin to the sun descending into the world."

They continued conversing as Li Xuanfeng exited the cave dwelling. Riding the wind, he flew a while before descending at his own cave dwelling.

Li Xuanfeng's dwelling was among the finest in Yi Mountain City. As he pushed open the door, his wife, Ning Hemian, met him with their child in her arms, smiling as she greeted him softly.

"What did the Daoist Master say?" she asked with a smile.

Ning Hemian, being from the Ning Family, often knew things even before he did, so he was not surprised at all by her question. He took the child in his arms and replied, "I will be heading to the Eastern Sea soon, escorting people and slaying demons."

The boy in his arms pursed his lips, his eyes a deep gray, though his brows were softer than his father's. Still young, he appeared rather gentle.

"Qin'er..." Li Xuanfeng called.

"Father!" the young boy called out in a cheery response.

Li Xuanfeng held him close and asked a few questions about recent events. Li Yuanqin responded with short affirmations, while Ning Hemian closed the stone door of the dwelling, voicing her concern, "What does the Daoist Master mean by this? Is he putting you at risk? Could this be dangerous?"

"It should not be," Li Xuanfeng replied thoughtfully, raising his brow as he continued, "I have already mastered Aura Rebound Technique and have the Black Gold Spirit Armor as protection. My combat power is formidable. Unless I directly face the Foundation Establishment Realm heirs of the three sects, most would not stand a chance against me."

Li Xuanfeng continued, "If I can prepare and keep my distance, even a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm direct disciple from one of the three sects would cough up blood under my arrows. Against ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... they would fare no better than the demons torn apart by the dozens on the battlefront."

Li Xuanfeng's tone was calm, though the underlying bloodlust beneath his words was strong. He added softly, "Only those in the southern borders know my reputation as the Golden Bowstring... It will be interesting to see what kind of cultivators I will encounter overseas."

Ning Hemian casually responded as she tidied spirit medicines around the cave dwelling, "Yes, yes... we all know how powerful you are!"

Li Xuanfeng, significantly older than her, could not help but laugh when he noticed her youthful demeanor. He thought to himself, When should I take Qin'er back home for a visit? I wonder how Yuanjiao and Qinghong are doing these days...

Through the Ning Family's connections, he had managed to gather various pieces of news about the Li Family, though most were only fragments. Now, with the opportunity to return home, he felt a growing warmth in his heart.

————

Mount Qingdu.

The ritual of burning incense and offering prayers was simple enough. In fact, simply meditating in front of the incense would suffice. Li Qinghong had carefully bathed, changed from her protective armor into Daoist robes, tied up her hair, and then trained before the incense for several months before flying on thunder toward Mount Yuting.

This immortal mountain was now covered in green pines, with snow piled atop its peaks. A sacrificial altar, over ten zhang tall, stood on the summit. It was adorned with carvings of mist, thunder, and rain patterns, primarily crafted from bluestone but reinforced with various metals like copper and iron.

At the top, twelve bronze and silver statues of various forms were arranged in a circle. Some statues captured thunder and dispersed clouds, while others held spears and bore fierce expressions. Eight of the statues had humanoid forms, while the remaining four took on shapes of dragons and serpents.

As Li Qinghong stepped onto this ritual platform, she felt the mana and thunderpool within her begin to stir, and the Profound Thunder Talisman pulsed, eager and active.

Sitting cross-legged at the center, she placed her hands, palms up, on her knees. Strands of violet lightning began to flow from her body, following and tracing along the patterns that were carved into the ground.

Now, the twelve statues should all light up. Dark clouds should gather in the sky, and thunder should appear... that would mark the beginning.

Li Qinghong activated her Immortal Foundation, waiting a full half hour. However, only the violet lightning circulated, with no unusual phenomenon appearing, nor was there any sign of the so-called Heavenly Resonance. Instead, she felt her internal mana depleting significantly.

"Is it really this useless..?"

She waited a while longer, but not only was there no thunder, there was not even a single dark cloud in the sky. With a sigh, she abandoned the secret technique and switched to using thunder to communicate with each statue in turn.

This was another function of the altar, allowing her to calculate where thunder would strike across the land, how many tribulation strikes had fallen recently, and who among wrongdoers was due for retribution by thunder.

"This is probably pointless too... There are not any tribulation strikes these days. Have not even heard of one... this technique is truly ancient."

After testing each statue in turn with no result, Li Qinghong's unwillingness drove her to repeat the process twice. Finally, when she connected with the last dragon-shaped statue, she received a response.

Shiiing...

The eyes of the dragon-shaped bronze statue glowed faintly, and suddenly Li Qinghong had a clear vision.

"Yincheng Prefecture, Wei State... At midnight on the 24th day. Twisting Thunder Tail strikes the ancient cypress tree west of the prefecture."

The statue emitted a flash of thunder before dimming once more, offering no further response.

"Huh..?"

Li Qinghong blinked, feeling an odd mix of surprise and resignation. "It really is an ancient technique! But... what use is this?" she wondered aloud in confusion.

If it truly provided an exact location, Li Qinghong could ride her thunderbolt there and capture this falling lightning with her spells. Judging by the name of it, this was likely some form of spirit thunder of Heaven and Earth, a rare sight in this age.

In recent ages, thunder strikes had become rarer between Heaven and Earth, and as a result, thunder cultivators were increasingly uncommon. Furthermore, thunder was unlike spirit fire or water; it dispersed instantly upon impact. Unless one was extremely lucky or encountered it in the clouds by chance, capturing it was nearly impossible.

However, the information provided by this spell turned out to be the name of a now ancient place, and even if she knew the location of it, finding it would be nearly impossible. Li Qinghong could only sigh in dejection.

"Moreover, this place is likely far to the north in hostile territory under the Wrathful Dao lineage, where deep-seated enmity remains... entangled with threads of fate. It is strictly forbidden to go there."

Li Qinghong calculated that the next thunder invocation ritual was three months away. She planned thoughtfully, "The altar has already been built, and casting the spell consumes only a bit of mana. I will try every three months; who knows? One day, I might hit upon a Yue State city with a familiar name and be able to collect some thunder!"




# Chapter 550: The Elder of Mount Yue

Having made her decision, Li Qinghong was just about to sit down cross-legged when she noticed a faint light flickering outside the formation. Two young men, riding on the wind, entered. One was dressed in a white robe with a handsome face, while the other wore a golden Daoist robe, looking rather downcast.

"Aunt!"

The two were, of course, the Li brothers, Li Xijun and Li Ximing. They landed one after the other, and Li Xijun cupped his fist and announced, "Seventh Brother has broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm! I have brought him here for you to see."

Li Qinghong glanced at Li Ximing. He still had not recovered from his father's passing, and seeing the sorrow on his face, she spoke to him softly, "The timing was unfortunate... Your father did not hold any blame toward you, so you must come to terms with it."

Li Ximing lifted his sleeve and nodded, his expression far more subdued now. He replied quietly, "Now that I have broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, I can bring forward the family's plans for refining a few medicinal pills... I will head to the Alchemy Pavilion on Mount Wutu in the coming days to study the formula for the Barrier Breaking Pill. It would be highly beneficial for those advancing to both the Foundation Establishment and Qi Cultivation Realm."

Li Qinghong nodded approvingly. Her gaze shifted, catching sight of a few blue-gold embroidery patterns peeking out from under his sleeve. Women are often more sensitive to such symbols, and it reminded her of an orchid. She asked him briefly about matters at home, but seeing his low spirits, she held back her suggestions for sparring and let him depart to recover on his own.

Once Li Ximing had left, Li Qinghong turned to Li Xijun and asked, "Jun'er, does Ximing still have any contact with that woman surnamed Meng?"

Li Xijun lowered his gaze and replied quietly, "No, he does not."

Li Qinghong sighed. Not wanting her to press further, Li Xijun quickly changed the topic, asking about her thunder techniques. After Li Qinghong had explained, he nodded, "Indeed, most of it is obsolete, but it still holds some use. If you manage to capture a rare spirit thunder, it will have been worth the trouble."

"It is more than that," Li Qinghong replied softly, continuing, "I find cultivating here on this altar very comfortable... It allows me to summon lightning and channel my qi better than any other cave dwelling back home. You will not have to leave Qingdu Peak just to make space for me."

As they were speaking, a Jade Court Guard approached and reported, "My lords, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from Mount Yue has arrived at Qingdu."

Li Qinghong raised her brows slightly and ascended with a crackle of thunder, descending onto the lake's surface. There, she saw a cultivator waiting on a black cloud, his eyes bloodshot and narrow, his vertically slit pupils giving him a rather fierce look. He wore a gray robe and had the appearance of a middle-aged man.

"Hm?"

The Mount Yue cultivator, who was at mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, fixed his gaze on Li Qinghong and spoke in a raspy voice, "Are you a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator of the Li Family?"

"Precisely."

Li Qinghong cupped her fist, recognizing him as Fei Luoya, and, remaining courteous, replied softly, "I am Li Qinghong, and Li Yuanjiao is my elder brother."
𝐟𝕣𝗲𝕖𝕨𝗲𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝗲𝚕.𝗰𝚘𝐦

"I see."

The middle-aged man nodded just as the lake's surface split open. Li Wushao rode the wind out from below, shadows drifting darkly beneath his robe as he took a silent stance behind Li Qinghong.

From another direction, a golden light streaked upward. Li Ximing, clad in a Daoist robe, arrived on a radiant path, his spell bright and imposing. Seeing the impressive gathering, Fei Luoya immediately grew cautious and stepped back slightly.

"Does the elder have business with us? Why not come down and discuss it in detail?" Li Qinghong asked politely.

Fei Luoya, highly wary, declined to enter the formation, shaking his head repeatedly. After a brief struggle to find his words, he spoke awkwardly, "Well... what Li Yuanjiao promised back then... does it still hold?"

The group froze, unsure of his meaning, and Fei Luoya knew he had no choice but to explain.

It turned out that years ago, several individuals, including Yuan Chengdun, had slain Fu Daimu to the west. His territory had been given entirely to Fei Luoya, who had decided to organize the Mount Yue people to cultivate some spirit paddies.

Li Yuanjiao had suggested that the Li Family could take over the land and, in return, provide Fei Luoya with a portion of the annual harvest. However, Fei Luoya, who was greedy at the time, had refused his offer.

So, he had spent years managing the territory himself, only to realize that the yield was less than half of what Li Yuanjiao had promised. He had even sacrificed much of his cultivation time on the endeavor. Regretful, he had now come seeking out the Li Family again.

Hearing this, the Li Family members were delighted and quickly agreed. They moved on to discuss the details, but Fei Luoya still refused to enter the formation, so they settled on a small courtyard in the town to finalize arrangements.

They had just settled into their seats when Fei Luoya appeared restless and uneasy, as though his true purpose for coming had not yet been revealed. After several moments of awkward silence, he finally spoke, somewhat hesitantly.

"Your esteemed clan seems to be thriving! However... regarding that matter I inquired about years ago... does your clan have any news?"

With Li Yuanjiao absent, Li Qinghong had no idea what this Mount Yue cultivator was referring to. She could only respond diplomatically, "Perhaps my elder brother has already begun assisting you, Senior... But why not tell me about it again?"

Seeing the blank expressions on their faces, Fei Luoya looked briefly frustrated. With a sigh, he clarified, "The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator backing your clan... could they perhaps show me a clear path forward?"

Alas... he wants to join us!

This realization dawned on Li Qinghong finally. Fei Luoya could indeed be a valuable ally. His abilities were well-known—skilled in a variety of shamanic spells learned on Mount Wu, and he was both knowledgeable and capable. The prospect of gaining his support was tempting indeed.

However, their clan had no true Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Fei Luoya was no fool; he was not someone easily placated without concrete assurance.

Li Qinghong found herself in a predicament and, after a moment's thought, spoke softly, "Ah, so that is the matter! My brother also wishes to introduce you to an appropriate guide, but... meeting a Daoist Master is not so easily arranged. Even we can only do so after rendering great merit... My brother has been sent on a mission and, for now, will not be able to give you a direct answer."

Aware she was speaking to someone from Mount Yue, Li Qinghong kept her words as straightforward as possible, watching his reaction closely.

Fei Luoya paused, seeming to ponder her words. His narrow, vertical pupils fixed on her as realization dawned on him, and he quickly replied, "I understand!"

This young girl means that only if I establish some merit for them will they be able to bring me into the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's fold... I see! So, this is one of those complex customs of the Easterners...

He appeared visibly relieved, managing an awkward smile as he nodded, "If your clan ever needs anything, do not hesitate to ask me!"

Li Qinghong saw that he had understood her intentions. Despite his years of cultivation, Fei Luoya was somewhat inexperienced in dealing with people, but his cautious demeanor revealed his keen awareness.

Now that he had received a tentative commitment, Fei Luoya seemed noticeably more relaxed and had little patience for further conversation. Waving his hand, he said casually, "I am getting closer to the late Foundation Establishment Realm and am focusing on refining my cultivation in preparation for a breakthrough. I will not be staying here any longer... In a few days, I will send Zhu Xian to discuss any further details with you all."

With that, he left without looking back, riding the wind away. Li Qinghong escorted him to the edge of her family's territory, reflecting to herself, This old Mount Yue cultivator grows stronger with each passing year. For now, it's best to stall him with this delay tactic... As for the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, I'll discuss it with my brother once he returns to decide how best to handle it!




# Chapter 551: Setting Out

Fei Luoya departed, hands clasped behind his back as he rode the wind, leaving the others with a relaxed view of his retreating figure. Li Qinghong had managed to appease him, and with Li Ximing and the other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators filling the ranks, everyone dispersed, scratching their heads in bewilderment.

Li Qinghong returned to her senses and saw that only Li Wushao remained, his expression more troubled than ever. The wound on his tail stinger had yet to heal, prompting her to ask, "Is your injury serious?"

Li Wushao's hooked tail had been singed by a gray-red flame, leaving a pain that lingered, both in his body and in his spiritual sense. Occasionally, it would flare up, and the discomfort left him looking visibly pained.

Li Qinghong noticed this and inquired out of concern. Li Wushao waved his hand and replied, "Thank you for your concern, my lady... This flame appears to be Merging Fire, which merges body and spirit, harms one's essence, and even burns away lifespan— affecting the mind. All I can do is rest and recuperate."

His face was pale as he declined the medicinal pill Li Qinghong offered him, explaining politely, "Ordinary pills are ineffective against this sacred fire. During my time in the Eastern Sea, several dragons tried to devour me. They cultivate in the Converging Water method, which, like Merging Fire, worsens injuries over time with even the slightest contact. I am used to it by now and have some experience in dealing with it, so there is no need to worry."

With a grim expression, Li Wushao withdrew to heal, leaving Li Qinghong alone to descend on thunder.

"Converging Water... Merging Fire... Supreme Yin and Yang... they really do correspond one-to-one."

Li Qinghong nodded thoughtfully. Many manifestations of Metallic Essence had corresponding fruition attainments with identifiable traits. She wondered about the nature of her own Profound Thunderpool cultivation.

"Profound Thunder...? Or perhaps some kind of Celestial Thunder..."

Shaking these thoughts from her mind, Li Qinghong retreated into seclusion to train.

Half a month passed, and though Fei Luoya's subordinate, Zhu Xian, had yet to arrive, finally a group of travelers appeared in the distant sky. They were dressed in various robes and looked worn from their journey. Leading them was Li Xuanxuan, who was tugging at his beard as he rode the wind from afar.

"Granduncle!"

Li Xijun soared up to greet him, and Li Xuanxuan nodded slightly. Behind him, Chen Donghe and An Zheyan bowed in greeting.

Li Xuanxuan seemed to be in good spirits and said, "This old man went to Great Xiukui Temple and broadened his horizons significantly! That temple oversees seventy-two Dao lineages, preserving all kinds of ancient and shamanic spells, vastly different from modern techniques."

He reached into his storage pouch and drew out a few talismans. They appeared grayish with white inked symbols scrawled across them, and Li Xuanxuan beamed as he explained, "These are ancient spell talismans, infused with water essence to relieve pain and heal ailments... They will be quite useful to pass down to cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm and to treat common folk."

As he spoke, he waved his hand, and the crowd dispersed. Li Xijun guided him down, while Li Xuanxuan continued speaking cheerfully about the talismans in his hand.

Li Xuanxuan's old eyes swept across the mountain, and he glimpsed the white mourning clothes draped everywhere. A momentary joy vanished from his face, which was replaced by shock. His smile disappeared, and he fell silent.

Without a word, he allowed Li Xijun to lead him to the grave, where he sat heavily on the ground, murmuring to himself, "So, it is time... he managed to hold on all these years..."

His aged eyes took in the surrounding area. To his right stood the headstone of his eldest son, Li Yuanxiu, and to his left, his youngest, Li Yuanping. One was new, the other old, and both towered above him. Sitting between them, the gravestones loomed taller than he was.

Li Xijun withdrew quietly, retreating to the edge of the mountain path before glancing back.

The elderly man was slumped between the two graves, his legs spread in the wild grass, clutching one of the talismans in his hand without realizing it, and he was staring blankly at the sky with an expression of utter smallness... and unmistakable grief.

Li Xijun could not bear to look on any longer and lowered his head as he left. Chen Donghe led a person up the path, a man in a brown Daoist robe with a vine whip tied at his waist. Chen Donghe spoke softly, "This is Senior Zhu Xian."

Li Xijun quickly composed himself. The earlier scene still lingered vividly in his memory, but he had no time to dwell on it. Forcing a smile, he greeted Zhu Xian in a soft tone, "Greetings, Senior."

Zhu Xian, one of Fei Luoya's men, had just reached the early Foundation Establishment Realm.

His cultivation lineage was weak, and although he had established an Immortal Foundation, he was still inferior to even Li Wushao before he had gained his hooked tail. The skill he cultivated, Pure Essence Wind, was an ordinary technique formed of Minor Pure Spiritual Qi.

Despite having a higher cultivation level than Li Xijun, Zhu Xian dared not act superior in his presence and spoke softly, "My senior brother has sent me here to coordinate the handover of the territory."

Fei Luoya's subordinates controlled a substantial amount of land. Although some barren areas at the edges were disregarded, the actual area was significantly larger than Eastern Mount Yue. As Li Xijun watched him spread out the map, Zhu Xian remarked, "Over these past ten or so years, my territory here has developed a population of just over fifty thousand..."

Li Xijun immediately felt a pang of surprise. On similar territory, their own Eastern Mount Yue had a population numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Such a small population in Zhu Xian's territory explained the lack of productivity.

Glancing over the map and estimating briefly, he said softly, "For this region, Senior, I propose establishing thirty towns, strategically placed along the land's spirit and earth veins. We can set up one or two immortal mountains and establish a governing system to oversee a population of three hundred thousand."

"There are two large plains here where we can establish major towns... Then, we can begin by setting up villages along the two rivers and gradually move people there."

As Li Xijun explained his plan in detail, Zhu Xian could only nod in agreement, not entirely grasping the pros and cons or understanding much of what was being discussed.

Once Li Xijun had arranged everything from start to finish, there was not much left to negotiate.

Zhu Xian had only one question.

"How much profit can this yield?" he asked.

Li Xijun calculated and answered, "After seven or eight years, annual profits could reach around twenty to thirty spirit stones, with our family taking a forty percent share."

After doing the math, Zhu Xian realized that this would meet Fei Luoya's expectations. He relaxed immediately, waving his hand in agreement, "Then let us proceed with that!"

Li Xijun then called Li Xicheng over for a thorough discussion. Zhu Xian, unable to sit still any longer, rode the wind back to report to Fei Luoya. Once Zhu Xian had left, Li Xijun asked, "Elder Brother, how much does our family have in reserves now?"

Li Xicheng replied, "Currently, we generate an annual income of over sixty spirit stones. After deducting the tribute payments, we can save less than a hundred stones every five years. Adding in the forty stones from the sale of Wanling Blossoms by Han Shizhen of the Han Family, our savings come to about one hundred and thirty spirit stones every five years."

After calculating for a bit, Li Xicheng continued, "For the past decade, we have avoided major expenses, so we have about two hundred stones in reserve after accounting for minor expenditures."

"Two hundred spirit stones—that is more than enough to set up two Qi Cultivation Realm formations... And since we are establishing these for Fei Luoya, we may even be able to extract some resources from his side."

With confidence in his plan, Li Xijun nodded and spoke softly, "Elder Brother, the expansion effort will need your coordination. We could consider moving Eastern Mount Yue westward, transferring the original dozen towns on the eastern side to be under Lijing Office. You have the insight to handle it as you see fit."

"Rest assured."

Li Xicheng's reply was steady and composed, carrying an air of authority. However, as his gaze passed over the white mourning garments, a lingering sorrow remained in his eyes.

Li Xuanfeng gathered his belongings, stepped onto his flying shuttle, and, with two Ning Family cultivators in tow, set off with his golden bow slung over his back. They flew gracefully toward the Azure Pond Sect. The two Ning Family members, having grown accustomed to traveling with him, used the journey to brief him on the clans of the nearby prefectures.

These two brothers were from a branch of the Ning Family and had followed Li Xuanfeng for over a decade, deeply respecting him. Li Xuanfeng listened absently, uninterested in lingering along the way. They glided over the landscape, arriving at the Azure Pond Sect, where he instructed them, "Go ahead and gather all those who are heading to the Eastern Sea."

He waited patiently. According to the practices of the Azure Pond Sect, most of those being sent to guard the Eastern Sea were likely cultivators with limited talents. Aside from members of the Chi and Ning families, disciples from Yuan Su, Yuanwu, and Yuan Xiu's Peaks were often assigned to the southern borders or the Eastern Sea.

He waited for a while, choosing not to enter the mountain. Instead, he seated himself in a pavilion, watching the mist drift across Mount Azure Pond. After a short time, he heard a commotion as the two Ning Family members returned, leading a group of cultivators.

The group of young men and women wore azure Daoist robes. Most of them were at the Qi Cultivation Realm, their faces filled with the fresh inexperience of novices. They lined up behind the two Ning Family members and called out in unison, "Greetings, Daoist!"

Within the Azure Pond Sect, those who held the title of Peak Master at the Foundation Establishment Realm were addressed as Peak Masters. If they lacked this title, they were simply called Daoists—after all, within the Azure Pond Sect, Foundation Establishment Realm alone was not enough to earn the title of an ancestor.

Li Xuanfeng found this a little strange. Years ago, his family had treated disciples from Azure Pond Sect with the utmost respect, not daring to defy them. He recalled his visit to Cloud Crowned Peak of the Xiao Family back then, where even a mere sect attendant could command a small clan's family head at will.

Back then, he had been a lowly archer, serving under the sect's disciples. Now, he had become a senior to the very members of Azure Pond, which made him chuckle quietly as he gave them a slight nod.

To the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm disciples, however, Li Xuanfeng in his Black Gold Spirit Armor was an awe-inspiring sight. His armor's elegant lines and fierce expression, with eyes sharp as a hawk, seemed to emit a golden glow. Combined with the ferocious longbow hanging from his golden robe, his imposing presence was undeniable!

Just by standing there, he exuded the aura of a veteran general who had guarded the wild borders for years. His slightly hoarse voice and commanding gaze added to his formidable image, with the gleam of his golden bow making the eyes of onlookers ache.

"I heard this senior was born with immense strength, able to wrestle tigers and wolves... He comes from a distinguished sword-wielding clan, yet chose to abandon the sword and master the golden bow instead... single-handedly dispersing the clouds of demons in the Southern Border!"

The young disciples whispered among themselves, filled with admiration for the man.

Even though they were members of an immortal sect, Foundation Establishment Realm was still an uncertain achievement for many. With fierce internal competition and frequent assignments to guard distant territories, becoming someone of Li Xuanfeng's stature was no small feat.

Li Xuanfeng scanned the group; once he saw that everyone had gathered, he tapped the golden beast buckle on his belt and took out a jade ship.

Initially the size of a thumb, the spirit shuttle expanded rapidly, glowing with emerald light until it transformed into a great boat over ten zhang in length. It floated gently in the air.

"The Everflowing Jade Cloudliner."

The boat was not Li Xuanfeng's possession; rather, Ning Wan had loaned it to him. When she had heard that he had no means of transport, she had provided the ship for him to carry the dozen or so disciples across Yue State.

Since she was in seclusion cultivating her divine abilities, she had no immediate need for it and was happy to lend it to him.

The Azure Pond disciples, accustomed to seeing spirit ships, showed little surprise as they boarded. The ship was spacious enough, and the two Ning Family brothers took it upon themselves to pilot it. Li Xuanfeng stood at the front of the vessel, gazing down at the sea of clouds and peaks below.

"If only I did not have these people with me, I would not need to delay. I have to finish my current task before I can return home for a visit... Otherwise, I would have stopped by the Lake Xian area to drop by home."

He watched the clouds part and gather, light and shadow shifting as they crossed over Mount Quanwu and reached Libu Prefecture.

The elder Ning brother at the front called out, "General, up ahead is Wubu Market!"

Li Xuanfeng understood what he meant; his grand-nephew Li Xizhi was stationed there as the local guardian. However, with all the disciples on board, stopping casually could cause misunderstandings, so he replied, "Keep going... no need to stop."

"Yes!"

They obeyed and continued steering the spirit ship, while Li Xuanfeng began to adjust his breathing and focus.

He cultivated the Golden Light Edge Technique, a Grade Three technique obtained from the Ji Family, which was practiced by a branch of the Situ Family. Compared to techniques passed down among the main lineages of the immortal sects, it was somewhat lacking.

After reaching Foundation Establishment Realm, however, Ning Hemian had acquired a Grade Four manual for him from within the sect, called Golden Stone Lofty Skies Technique. It allowed him to cultivate to the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, significantly speeding up his progress. Yet, since he had already formed his Immortal Foundation, he still could not match those who had fully cultivated the Golden Stone Lofty Skies Technique from the start.

Li Xuanfeng was rather indifferent about it; his Immortal Foundation had already been refined to its utmost limits, so a little more or less made no difference.

The Engraved Stone Dao foundation came from the Golden Tang Gate, with qi that could break through formations, split mountains, and destroy enemy artifacts. It specialized in targeting weaknesses, with its power growing stronger with each life taken, tempered by the blood qi of his fallen enemies.

And over the decades, Li Xuanfeng had slain countless foes in the Southern Border. He had suffered many wounds in his early years, but with this spirit armor, he had become even more formidable. The number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who had fallen by his hand had long since entered the double digits.

In his qihai acupoint, a chaotic golden-red light swirled. He had refined it to its limit two years ago, reaching a point where further refinement was impossible. His confidence came from this source, a confidence grounded in hard-won strength.

Daoist Master Yuan Su promoted me likely because of this, he thought to himself.

Over the years, Li Xuanfeng had gained insight into Daoist Master Yuan Su's intentions. Ning Tiaoxiao needed someone among the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who was strong enough to crush any minor threats—someone who could handle matters that he himself found inconvenient to attend to.

This Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator not only needed to be exceptionally powerful and loyal but also had to be without prospects for advancement, with weaknesses Yuan Su could exploit... and perhaps even be willing to sacrifice themselves in a critical moment.

Daoist Master Yuan Su was cunning to the core—a master strategist. He had discerned Li Xuanfeng's character perfectly, not only marrying him to a woman from the clan but also placing members of the Ning Family around him, either as subordinates or as colleagues. The Ning Family members themselves did not fully realize it, yet they had already come to care for him genuinely.

"After all, he is a cultivator of several hundred years... His methods are impeccable. He does not need divine abilities or spells to manipulate people."

Clad in the Black Gold Armor that his wife had sought for him, Li Xuanfeng stood quietly, gazing deeply at the setting sun descending in front of him.

"Boss, we are leaving the prefecture!"

The elder Ning brother, his forehead slightly sweaty, turned around and grinned, flashing a set of white teeth. His younger brother looked up at Li Xuanfeng with a shy but admiring gaze.

"Got it," Li Xuanfeng replied.

The Ning brothers kept the ship steady, calling him "General" and "Boss" with utmost loyalty. Li Xuanfeng was not easily deceived, and for years, he had harbored doubts that these two were sent to monitor him. However, after several times when they had risked their lives to protect him, he had come to see them as his own people.

Now, as long as Li Xuanfeng could not, in good conscience, abandon his wife and subordinates, Yuan Su's purpose had been fulfilled. Surveying his surroundings, Li Xuanfeng saw loyalty to his clan, his wife, and his duty.

There was no other path forward but to serve Yuan Su.




# Chapter 553: Crossing Lake Xian

Li Xuanfeng crossed borders on his conspicuous jade ship and soon entered the territory of the Profound Peak Gate.

While the Azure Pond Sect had its own coastal access, the path to the Eastern Sea through Profound Peak's Lake Xian was far closer to Splitreed Island. Going through the southern exit of Azure Pond Sect would involve a long detour, so Li Xuanfeng had opted to travel through Profound Peak Sect's land instead.

As Shanji Prefecture, controlled by Profound Peak Gate, came into view, a white barrier appeared before them. Li Xuanfeng halted the jade ship, and soon, a Profound Peak disciple rode the wind up to greet them. He displayed utmost courtesy as he asked softly, "May I ask, Senior..."

The elder Ning brother stepped forward and replied, "From Azure Pond, escorting disciples to Splitreed Island."

Li Xuanfeng took a step forward, tapped his belt, and a jade token shot out from the beast-head buckle, radiating a brilliant light in midair.

The Profound Peak disciple, an elderly man dressed in white with well-defined features and moles on each cheek, was adorned with various jade accessories. Bowing respectfully, he said hurriedly, "Junior Kong Yu greets Senior! Please... please follow me to the lake!"

His deference was evident as he led the way, sneaking glances at Li Xuanfeng with a hint of hesitation before stammering, "Is this Senior... could you be the famed Golden Bowstring of the Southern Border? You match the description so closely..."

Li Xuanfeng was not surprised to be recognized so easily and nodded slightly. Kong Yu instantly grew excited, exclaiming, "Senior, I am Kong Yu of Profound Peak! Our gate has long been allied with the Li Family! I even visited Moongaze Lake to help Qingdu relocate a mountain. I am quite close with Daoist Xuanxuan..."

Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow in mild surprise, his expression softening significantly as he responded gently, "Oh? My elder brother?"

A faint smile appeared on Li Xuanfeng's face as he asked, "I have not seen him in many years... How is my elder brother doing these days?"

"Well... he is quite well!"

Under Li Xuanfeng's gaze, Kong Yu felt a sudden pang of nervousness. After two hasty replies, he elaborated, "Daoist Xuanxuan has reached late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm and has grown more adept with talismans. He has never been much for combat, but his skills in talisman arts are increasingly profound..."

"We traveled west together back then, discussing so much along the way. I learned a great deal," Kong Yu murmured as Li Xuangfeng looked off into the distance, listening quietly.

Kong Yu, digging through his memory, suddenly remembered another detail and quickly added, "And I heard... I heard that your clan even went overseas and, along with Profound Peak's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, launched a counterattack on Situ Mo, nearly obliterating that monk from the Wrathful Dao Lineage!"

"A counterattack..? Situ Mo? A Golden Tang Gate disciple?" Li Xuanfeng repeated as he frowned.

The Southern Border was often cut off from outside news. Li Xuanfeng, though he had received one update from home through Liu Changdie, knew little overall. Most of his information came through Ning Family channels.

The Ning Family was effective at gathering news, but they could not uncover everything, especially the more private matters. Kong Yu, on the other hand, had heard this news through Kong Tingyun, which explained why Li Xuanfeng had been unaware.

Li Xuanfeng's interest was instantly piqued as he caught onto the essential details and asked further, prompting Kong Yu to relay what he had learned from Kong Tingyun.

"Yes, a Golden Tang Gate disciple! Apparently, Situ Mo somehow incurred your family's wrath and colluded with the Wrathful Dao Lineage in the north, setting an ambush for your family's younger members. Fortunately, the Li Family's Foundation Establishment Realm experts arrived in time, preventing any mishap..."

Kong Yu continued, "Later, when your family needed to go to the Eastern Sea, they teamed up with our Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Kong Tingyun, for the journey. It just so happened that they encountered those two on the way, and in the ensuing battle, that monk..."

Kong Yu summarized the event. When he described Situ Mo's ambush, Li Xuanfeng's eyes narrowed slightly, a flicker of anger lighting up his gaze.

By the time Kong Yu finished, however, Li Xuanfeng's expression had settled into a quiet calm, revealing no trace of emotion as he murmured evenly, "How bold."

Though spoken softly, his tone sent a chill through Kong Yu, who watched as Li Xuanfeng asked, "Is Situ Mo currently in the Eastern Sea?"

"He is indeed!" Kong Yu nodded eagerly, pleased with himself as he responded, "He is on Golden Sack Island in the Scarlet Pristine Sea. Just head east from here, and you will find it easily with a few inquiries."

Li Xuanfeng nodded, standing with his hands clasped behind him with his Black Gold Spirit Armor gleaming in the sunlight, his robes billowing around him. A few names crossed his mind, and he muttered coldly, "Situ Mo... Guo Hongyao..."

It would be best if they stayed hidden in Yue State or on Crimson Reef Island... Because if I catch them in the Eastern Sea, they will learn the true taste of being pierced by thousands of arrows from head to toe!

As murderous intent surged in his heart, the old man before him, Kong Yu, felt a chilling sensation, as though his face were being slashed by knives. Terrified, he dared not speak.

As for Kong Yu, he is clearly using me as a blade here!

Li Xuanfeng glanced briefly at the old man, though he was not particularly concerned. These enemies were shared adversaries, and this news was useful. Li Xuanfeng knew exactly how to handle it.

For Li Xuanxuan's sake, he remained courteous, though even this restrained glance left Kong Yu visibly uneasy. The old man quickly tried to amend his words, adding, "But Situ Mo is a core disciple of the Golden Tang Gate; regardless of his strength, it would be unwise to cause too much trouble. If you intend to deal with him, Senior, a light punishment may be best..."

Li Xuanfeng nodded as he leaned on the edge of the ship, conversing politely yet absently. As they left Lake Xian, Kong Yu finally bid them farewell, "This is as far as this old man will escort you! The rest of your journey is your own."

"Thank you, Fellow Daoist!" replied the elder Ning brother, nodding in acknowledgment.

Seeing Kong Yu's familiarity with Li Xuanfeng, he remained polite as Kong Yu turned away, sweat beading on his brow as he flew off, thinking to himself, That was close! Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanxuan are like night and day! How can they even be brothers... they are worlds apart!

To Kong Yu, Li Xuanxuan was like a mild, aging rabbit—though easily startled by even the slightest stir, he was serious, easy to talk to, and lacked any intimidating presence.

They had not spent long together, but Kong Yu had felt a genuine sense of rapport, understanding the man well.

Li Xuanfeng, however, was like a hawk, polite on the surface but brimming with a fierce edge. Especially when the topic of Situ Mo's ambush on Li Family juniors had come up, a single flicker of Li Xuanfeng's gaze had felt like a blade cutting across his face.

If he were merely a lone eagle, it might not be so concerning... but this man has endured the bitter winds of the Southern Border for decades, sharpening his claws to razor edges. Besides... he has built himself a nest within the mighty Ning Family—he's truly terrifying!

Watching the emerald jade ship disappear into the distance, Kong Yu thought quietly, In less than ten years, Yue State will be buzzing with tales of this great eagle! Three generations back to back... the Li Family truly has people of talent, no wonder they are thriving!

Returning to his peak on the wind, deep in thought, Kong Yu hurried to rummage through his storage and pulled out a talisman, tracing it with meticulous detail.

"Oh right, I should let Tingyun know! She might be able to find a way to establish contact with the Li Family. It would be best if they could push Situ Mo back to Yue State; this would also be a good opportunity to earn the Li Family's favor!"

The old man, well over a century in age and adept in such matters, quickly recorded his message in the talisman and called someone over.

"Go! Deliver this to Yuezhou Island!"




# Chapter 554: The Hornless and True Dragon

Li Xuanfeng led the group across Lake Xian, finally arriving at the coastal waters. The waves surged as the sea stretched in endless blue, and Ning Dingbo, the elder Ning brother, stepped forward to gather the disciples.

Once the Azure Pond disciples had assembled, Ning Dingbo flashed a smile, revealing his white teeth as he explained, "This area is called the Shallow Sea... The water here is not very deep; it got submerged during the great battles of ancient times. Most of the islands you see now were once immortal mountains, while the remaining few were later transported here to fill the sea."

Li Xuanfeng stood with his hands behind his back, listening silently. Understanding his nature, Ning Dingbo continued with the introduction on his behalf, "In those days, this area was home to the six most densely populated southern prefectures, all of which were swallowed by the sea... leaving ruins beneath the waves. Since the water is shallow, cultivators have already scoured it clean over the years."

Ning Dingbo continued to explain patiently, "If you travel further, toward the Scarlet Pristine Sea and the Qunyi Gorge, you will reach what was once the Eastern Sea... Dragon Palaces cover the landscape, with flood dragons and serpents roaming freely. Going deeper, you will encounter many dragon kin; do not offend them!"

The disciples reacted with mixed expressions. Those dressed in fine robes seemed unaffected, already familiar with this knowledge, while the more simply dressed disciples looked enlightened.

Ning Dingbo continued, "The Scarlet Pristine Sea was named after the eighth child of the True Hornless Dragon, which involves the ancient Pristine Converging Water. The sea is filled with demons and treasures, most of which are controlled by the dragon kin. If you go in, proceed with caution."

A young man with a finely tailored robe and slender brows suddenly spoke up, respectfully asking, "May I ask, Instructor, why is it that... while the ruling beings here are of the dragon kin and hold the Converging Water Fruition Attainment, it is referred to as the True Hornless Dragon? Why not call it the Hornless Dragon?"

"Well..." Ning Dingbo hesitated, casting a reluctant glance at Li Xuanfeng before shaking his head, replying gravely, "That is an ancient matter... few would know the answer."

The group looked slightly disappointed, but then Li Xuanfeng stepped forward and spoke softly, "If not for the Pristine Converging Water, the True Hornless Dragon would have become a True Dragon."

Having spent years in the Southern Border, Li Xuanfeng had come across one or two of these ancient secrets.

He knew that Li Chejing had fallen victim to an old flood dragon in the Southern Border, so whenever he encountered snake or flood dragon-type demons in battle, he always tried to capture them alive and interrogate them for any information about the old flood dragon.

This old flood dragon, a well-known demon king in the Southern Border, was named Cen Lufu and cultivated the divine ability of Pristine Water. Supposedly also of dragon kin, Li Xuanfeng himself had harbored the same question as the young disciple, and he had eventually uncovered the answer through careful questioning.

As he began to speak, the young disciples looked up to him in admiration. The refined young man appeared somewhat bashful as he respectfully requested, "Daoist, may I trouble you for your explanation..."

Li Xuanfeng replied softly, "The True Hornless Dragon dominated the Eastern Sea, achieving Fruition Attainment for hundreds of years, and reportedly reached the peak of the Dao Embryo Realm. It believed itself to be the most perfect creature under Heaven, and called itself the Demon Emperor, establishing the Eastern Sea Demon Palace."

"It journeyed westward until it reached a small mountain temple and encountered an Immortal Lord..." Li Xuanfeng continued, "The True Hornless Dragon asked, Is there any creature under Heaven with a form more perfect than my own? The Immortal Lord replied, The dragon kin rise and fall in size, soaring through the universe, diving beneath waves, and transforming with the times. You are merely a demon dragon; you must transform into a true dragon."

Li Xuanfeng paused, then continued softly, "The Hornless Dragon carefully questioned the Immortal Lord about the characteristics of true dragon kin, then returned to the Eastern Sea, gathering forces and consuming a feathered serpent."

"With two Fruition Attainments in one body, it was impossible to manage both Converging Water and Pristine Water simultaneously. It eventually met a hasty end, its powers divided among its nine offspring, throwing the Eastern Sea into turmoil and an era of extreme chaos."

Li Xuanfeng gazed into the distance, a hint of reverence in his voice as he added quietly, "Only then did the world's demons understand the difference between the Hornless and True Dragon, as well as those between flood dragons, snakes, and vipers—knowledge that later spread from the Dragon Palace itself."

"The Hornless Dragon may have been devoured by its nine offspring, but its descendants now call themselves dragon kin and have established the Eastern Sea Serpent Dragon Palace."

As Li Xuanfeng finished relating the story, not only were the disciples in awe, but even the Ning brothers were hearing this for the first time, marveling at the tale.

Li Xuanfeng shook his head.

"It is just a tale spun from the mouth of a mere snake; take it as a story for entertainment."

"Thank you, Daoist, for your teaching!" the disciples said in unison as they respectfully offered their thanks.

Li Xuanfeng waved it off, his eyes glinting with a cold light as he stared at the shadow approaching on the northern wind, murmuring, "Speak of the devil... here they come!"

Indeed, two streaks of light approached in the distance, one large and one small. The creature in the lead was snake-like, with a twin-hooked tail in a pale white hue, trailing a streak of blood across the sky. The one following closely behind it was nearly twice as large and was covered in bluish-gray scales, with a body resembling a tiger's but with an unusually elongated torso and belly, gliding in a prowling stance.

The bluish-gray creature had four strong legs, with an elongated torso and a long tail trailing behind, giving it an unusual appearance. It followed the white snake ahead of it with an air of ease, almost like a cat toying with a mouse.

Ning Dingbo glanced over and quickly directed his brother to steer the jade ship further away, lowering his voice as he said, "That is a dragon scion... Quickly move away... Do not disturb it."

Li Xuanfeng studied the scene closely. The creature in front seemed to be of the feathered serpent clan, with a twin-hooked tail. It was likely a hooked serpent.

Its scales were broken, blood that was a pale blue hue dripped from its body, and its window-sized eyes were filled with despair, emitting pitiful howls.

"It looks like it has been injured by Converging Water! Even if it escapes, it will not live much longer..."

Everyone watched, entranced, as the Ning brothers hastened to put distance between them and the scene. Yet, they could not help but look back in curiosity as the dragon scion closed in on the white hooked serpent, delaying the kill to toy with it instead.

Ning Dingbo's expression shifted slightly, muttering a quiet curse and silently quickening their pace, thinking to himself, Truly typical of dragon kin... The Converging Water lineage loves playing such games... Regardless of kin, they always have to test each other.

The group of cultivators watched the scene with rapt attention, awestruck, as the hooked serpent wailed miserably. After a few breaths, a faint green rain began to fall from the sky.

The rain was translucent and a delicate shade of blue-greenish hue. Though its color was light, it drenched the area and cast the world into a misty haze.

A finely dressed young disciple activated his mana to shield himself, remarking, "This is the vision of a fallen Converging Water Foundation Establishment Realm... So this is the Eastern Sea, where a Foundation Establishment Realm expert can fall on any stretch of ocean just like that."

Li Xuanfeng, meanwhile, was reflecting on the aura and appearance of the dragon scion they had just seen, thinking to himself, Indeed, they are unique. The dragon kin of the Eastern Sea must have various spells at their disposal; defeating them would likely be no easy task... If I could lure one into a wide enough sea area, perhaps I could exhaust it to death.

Naturally, he would not provoke a dragon kin, but he was calculating the strength of both sides, forming a solid understanding of the two.

Ning Dingbo moved a step closer and whispered, "Boss, I doubt that dragon scion's appearance here is just a coincidence; it is likely here to see who Azure Pond has sent to oversee Splitreed Island."
𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝕨𝕖𝗯𝚗𝚘𝕧𝕖𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝕞

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly. His task was not only to escort but also to stay on the island for a year or so to manage affairs. Splitreed Island's situation was complicated, so a dragon scion's curiosity was understandable.

As one of the largest markets in the sea and one of the most prominent immortal islands, Splitreed Island housed many natural resources. Its unusual terrain made it difficult to set up formations, leading to constant unrest.

And for reasons unknown, Purple Mansion Realm cultivators rarely appeared in the area. Each sect avoided assigning a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for oversight, relying mostly on Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Li Xuanfeng gave his assent. Soon, the majestic island appeared before them as the Ning brothers introduced the island's background while steering the ship down toward the water.

About ten li from Splitreed Island, a massive light shield shimmered across the seabed. Li Xuanfeng produced a jade token and guided them through the barrier.

The scene below was indeed radiant, with houses of all sizes nestled within the shimmering barrier. As the Ning brothers docked the jade ship, a cultivator approached them on a gust of wind.

Dressed in a green robe, the approaching man's storage pouch and sword glinted in the sun. His cloak was made of spirit silk, his robe of spirit cloth, and even the jade adorning him was of the highest grade—truly extravagant. He glanced at Li Xuanfeng and nodded, greeting, "Brother-in-law."

This man was Ning Heyuan, his wife's younger brother and the authority over the market on the island. With early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation, he was not unfamiliar to Li Xuanfeng, who gave him a brief nod in acknowledgment.

Ning Heyuan was of the main Ning Family line, but he had been taken in by the Chi Family at a young age and returned to the Ning Family only upon reaching adulthood. His position in the Ning Family leaned more toward the Chi lineage.

However, with Chi Wei's death and Daoist Master Yuan Su relocating to Yi Mountain City, many of the Ning Family had shifted their focus to the southern territories. Even though Chi Zhiyun was the sect leader, he dared not give orders to a senior like Yuan Su, who now acted independently in the Southern Border without taking directives or heeding summons.

This slight rift between the Ning and Chi families had placed Ning Heyuan in an awkward position. Li Xuanfeng had met him once more than ten years ago when he had been quite boastful. However, after hiding out at sea for over a decade, he now seemed far more subdued in character.

Bringing along several guest cultivators for introductions, Ning Heyuan quickly assigned tasks to the disciples and then pulled Li Xuanfeng aside, saying, "Brother-in-law... this is my first time working with you directly. If there is anything I overlook, please guide me."

Li Xuanfeng found his attitude somewhat unexpected and gave a polite nod. Ning Heyuan led him to his cave dwelling, explaining that he needed to meet with some of the disciples before departing. Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng wrote a letter and handed it to the elder Ning brother to be delivered to the Li Family.

————

Great Jueting.

This was an ancient city, grand and majestic. At its height, it had a population of a hundred thousand, but under Fu Daimu's rule for several decades, only about ten thousand remained. Fei Luoya had reclaimed it and, after years of nurturing, had restored the population to thirty or forty thousand.

The stone bricks of the old city were mottled with the marks of time, and Li Family soldiers hurried through the narrow streets. The Mount Yue townsfolk hid inside their houses, peeking out with hope in their eyes.

Just as the people of Eastern Mount Yue envied the prosperous lives of the Easterners, the inhabitants of Great Jueting longed for the affluence of Eastern Mount Yue. Having heard of the Li Family's reputation, they now eagerly anticipated the Li Family's takeover.

Clan cultivators and Jade Court Guards patrolled the skies while Li Xicheng rode the wind with his younger brother Li Xijun by his side. They both studied a map, deep in discussion.

"The Liu and Xu families cannot be allowed on new lands... As for those from the prestigious family, it would be best to restrict them and promote common families to settle along the western lakes and establish villages."

Fei Luoya had chosen to take a hands-off approach, handing over his territory to the Li Family before entering secluded cultivation. The Li Family had sent people to inspect the area twice, discovering that it was divided into two major sections.

One part was Mount Yue's grand city of Great Jueting, a rare ruin with a vast expanse, while the other was a fertile plain with no significant mountains.

The Li Family focused their efforts on the ancient city of Great Jueting, an old and distinguished place within Mount Yue, second only to Mount Wu. Li Yuanjiao had visited it once, but his attention had been consumed with dividing the spoils of war, so he had not been able to take a closer look.

As the two juniors explored, they found it rich in age-old elegance. The palace walls still bore many murals, though most had been damaged by years of warfare. Some still depicted scenes of cataclysms, darkness, and despair.

Li Xijun stepped inside, admiring the artwork. The recent murals depicted the rise of the Li Family, the east bursting with blossoms and the brightness of flames atop oil.

But, as he moved deeper, the murals took on a bleaker tone, showing fields overrun with locusts, drought in every direction, foreign invasions, and the death of the king... Li Xijun paused to look, then turned back and commented, "This must be the legendary Jianixi."

The two brothers continued through the palace halls, passing one scene after another of the heavens collapsing and landscapes withering, only to later reach depictions of people thriving and living in abundance.

The later murals were worn beyond recognition, but after searching for a while, they found another complete one.

This mural depicted a figure dressed in black whose face was obscured. In one hand, they held an object resembling a book, while in the other, a staff. Many people were painted kneeling before this figure, while beside them, a sun hung in the sky, casting its light downward.

"That must be Duanmu Kui..."

Both Li Xicheng and Li Xijun were familiar with their family's history and many recorded stories. Li Xijun remarked, "Duanmu Kui dominated his era, even daring to suppress the gates of Azure Pond Sect... but in the end, he could not break through to the Golden Core realm. And... that immortal text he possessed vanished without a trace, with no clues left to its whereabouts."

"As for the sun..." Li Xijun paused, then sighed, "Perhaps it has something to do with the Wei-Li lineage."

He had complex feelings about Wei-Li. Many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, including some Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, had assumed that the Li Family was of the direct line of Wei-Li. Li Xuanfeng had passed along information, and Li Xijun had done his own research, forming some theories.

Daoist Master Yuan Su believed our family to be of Wei-Li blood. If the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' divine abilities are accurate, then we are indeed descended from Wei-Li... which explains the family's numerous connections to monks. But as for whether we are direct descendants... that is hard to say...

Li Xijun knew the truth about his family. Despite the recent streak of exceptional Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, he understood that it was not due to their bloodline.

The Li Family's rapid cultivation progress was primarily due to the talisman seeds each main branch member possessed, which accelerated their cultivation speed. They had also received multiple boosts from talismans and a talisman pill, creating an aura of distinction around them.

Piecing these insights together, Li Xijun quickly came to a conclusion, Our family is likely a side branch of Wei-Li, merely appearing as direct descendants due to the support of these immortal artifacts, thus attracting such complex connections.

As he pondered these thoughts, he gazed at the grand and unadorned palace, then stopped and turned around abruptly.

"Elder Brother, I will return for now; the rest is in your hands."

Li Xicheng, puzzled but compliant, nodded, while Li Xijun took to the wind and rode swiftly back to Mount Qingdu, entering the ancestral shrine. Activating the protective formation, he stepped into the hidden chamber.

The altar of cold iron emitted a faint glow, carved with osmanthus patterns that added a mysterious, serene air. Li Xijun bowed deeply and spoke with respect, "I, Xijun, the descendant of the Li Family, humbly request the mirror to pierce through the mysteries, perceive the hidden truth, and illuminate all directions, capturing spirits and discerning the divine..."

Li Xijun had observed the supposedly ordinary Great Jueting, which, despite the multiple inspections by Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, seemed to reveal nothing remarkable. He thought to himself, The Immortal Mirror should reveal something different.




# Chapter 556: The Appearance of Radiant Origin Pass

Li Xijun rode the wind and then descended in the Great Jueting. He slowly closed his eyes and, with a calm focus, connected his spiritual sense to the exalted immortal mirror. Through it, the entire Great Jueting soon came into clear view.

He scanned the palace curtains, finding that nothing was out of the ordinary. Beneath the throne, there was a hidden passage that had been reinforced with protective formations. It had once been used by the kings of Mount Yue to escape, though it had been emptied out long ago when Mount Yue's army arrived at the mountain.

There was nothing there now.

Perhaps I've overthought it.

Li Xijun continued scanning the place and discovered several secret chambers belonging to Mount Yue's cultivators. A few Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit items were carefully hidden away in these rooms. Given the current state of the Li Family, these were of little interest to him.

"Several elders had visited here with a mirror in the past. If there had been any treasures, they would have found them long ago... It's no surprise there's nothing here now."

Though that was what he believed, Li Xijun had always been thorough in his task. His eyes continued to roam, and he carefully examined the northern slope of the Great Jueting.

Since the immortal mirror is with me now, I might as well take a closer look. It'd be wonderful if I could find one or two spirit waters or treasured panaceas!

The Li Family had never thoroughly explored this forest before. It was sparsely populated by demonic beasts, so finding a spirit item or two was a real possibility. Li Xijun spent most of the day meticulously searching through the expanse, and, eventually, something unusual caught his eye.

Within the dense forest, he used the immortal mirror to probe through the overlapping rocks. Suddenly, he spotted a dark and shadowy area. Stalactites hung from above and were shimmering with specks of light, and a turbulent winding river flowed beneath it.

It was an underground river.

Beside the river stood a massive rock, its vermillion surface glowing brightly. It was connected to a palm-sized, golden, diamond-shaped stone that was radiating a soft, colorful light.

A treasure!

Li Xijun had initially been searching for a treasured panacea, but even though he did not recognize the object in front of him, it clearly looked like something of great value.

Li Xijun landed unhurriedly and seized the opportunity to further examine the surroundings with the immortal mirror.

Elsewhere, the Yu Family was celebrating another wedding. Their residence was lively with music and celebration.

The current head of the family was the seventh young master, Yu Chengyi, who was only head because Yu Su had used a dharma artifact to kill his five brothers back then, allowing him to ascend to the position.

This man, disinterested in managing the family's affairs, had delegated all power to the clan elders. He spent his days parading through the streets, taking concubines, riding horses, and watching dog fights, living a complacent life.

Meanwhile, the power struggle among the clan elders raged on. Despite perpetually scheming against each other, all of them supported Yu Chengyi as the head of the family—this was how he had managed to stay in his position year after year.

Several Qi Cultivation Realm elders of the Yu Family had perished in their failed attempts to break through. Meanwhile, the external cultivators within the family seemed to be thriving, each supporting a different branch of the Yu Family. The internal politics were intense, and among them was an extremely influential guest cultivator surnamed Lu.

Li Xijun recalled the man. He was the one who had instigated the elders of the Yu Family to block Yu Mugao outside the formation back then. He searched with his spiritual sense for a while but could not locate his whereabouts.

The Yu Family had remained relatively stable over the years. Li Xijun checked a few times and confirmed that no new cultivators had reached the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

The few already at the late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm were all elderly men, in their seventies or eighties, with little hope of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The internal strife back then had damaged the foundation of their family and disrupted their system... I wonder when they'll recover from it.

Although the Li Family had many spies within the Yu Family, Li Xijun felt it was still necessary to inspect things personally to be sure.

After finishing his observations, he crossed the rippling lake, riding the wind toward the Fei Family's Glacial Cloud Peak.

The Fei Family was more prosperous than in previous years. Though they had to cut down their expenses and direct their resources toward supporting Fei Qingyi, they were clearly living a comfortable life with backing in the sect.

Despite lacking a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, the visiting cultivators still treated them with respect.

Additionally, Fei Qingyi had recently befriended influential masters and managed to reduce the tributes required from his clan. Although life had improved overall for the family, most of its members practiced various cultivation techniques now, with only very few following the Jade True Dao lineage.

The Fei Family had not sent anyone to visit the Li Family in years, and the two families had grown increasingly distant. Li Xijun was not interested in further observations, so he turned back and rode the wind in search of Li Ximing.

Li Ximing was absorbed in studying a spirit fruit and the Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill that Li Xizhi had brought back. Though the pill's refining method was ancient and complex, his natural talent for alchemy allowed him to grasp the basic concepts and progress steadily.

Upon hearing that he had to leave just as he was reaching an interesting phase in his work, Li Ximing reluctantly set it aside, muttering under his breath as he stood up.

Li Xijun smiled and said, "Come on, you won't regret coming with me! You're the only one in the family without a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact... If the artifact is of good quality, you'll definitely benefit from having it in your possession!"

Hearing this, Li Ximing's face lit up instantly, and he quickly followed Li Xijun with excitement.

"Since I broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, I've felt my cultivation progress speeding up. It's not like what the books say—how it gradually slows down due to talent limitations. Everything still feels smooth when I cultivate..."

He shook his Daoist robe and continued confidently, "If I focus solely on my cultivation, I'm sure I can reach the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm within ten years. Even if I need to divert my focus on refining pills, it should only take a bit longer than that..."

Li Xijun walked ahead with his hands clasped behind his back.

"All right... The family can only provide you with resources. We don't have experience beyond the initial stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, so you'll need to explore the future on your own," he said.

He then shared the findings from his investigations, and Li Ximing simply nodded in understanding. Together, they rode the wind toward Great Jueting, passing through the forest and landing beside a small hill.

"The entrance to this cave lies deep within the heart of the mountain, with layers of rocks blocking it. The earth vein here is shallow, and the spiritual energy is weak. No one would think of establishing a cave dwelling here, which is why it has remained undiscovered all this while," Li Xijun explained, transmitting his voice through his spiritual sense.

As Li Ximing saw him point out the location, wisps of light quietly emerged behind him, interweaving with each other. He shook his sleeves, and the wisps of light passed through his ribs, quickly condensing in front of him.

In the span of a breath, a bright ray of light began to form, and white stone bricks materialized one after another, fitting together perfectly. They soon transformed into a massive gate—bright, crystalline, and imposing.

The gate stood tall, with two white doorposts etched with mysterious shamanic patterns. Its eaves rose high above, towering and grand. The city gate shimmered with a hazy light, as if glowing under the heat of a blazing sun.

Li Xijun examined the door closely and noticed strange, blurry words on the two doors—glyphs resembling a talisman, unreadable at first glance.

Li Ximing, proud of his work, gestured toward the gate and explained, "The inscription on the right door reads Bright as the shining light, and the left door says Radiant as the rising sun. I had a moment of clarity when I established my foundation, and recognized the writings right away."

Li Xijun frowned, intrigued but confused.

"There are words on your immortal foundation, huh? I've never heard of such a thing."

He stared at the inscription for a moment longer but his eyes began to hurt, so he had no choice but to look away. Meanwhile, Li Ximing activated the immortal foundation, causing the Radiant Origin Pass to descend from the sky, landing gracefully on the mountainside.

The closed doors swirled with energy, and bursts of bright light cascaded down, turning the soil and rocks into flying sand which tumbled down in a steady stream.

Li Ximing stood with his hands behind his back, and Li Xijun, watching in awe, praised, "Wow, a Grade Four cultivation technique is truly impressive!"

However, Li Ximing said, "It's hard to say... My immortal foundation follows the path of suppression and annihilation. The Boundless Ocean at home aligns with the Pit Water system, which isn't as forceful or destructive. So... they're very different. If I have to make a comparison, I'd say it's almost as powerful as our aunt's Profound Thunderpool."

At this point, Li Xijun's mind wandered, and he whispered, "Our family's informants overseas reported something interesting—the Bright Yang Essence has a Dao Partner known as the Bright And Clear Heart, originating from an immortal island on Qunyi Island... You might want to take note of that."

Li Ximing chuckled and shook his head.

"I've just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, and I don't even have any Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique yet. Why would I bother about Dao Partners right now?" he retorted rather playfully.

"Perhaps it's a clue to start looking!" Li Xijun replied.

He paused before continuing to explain softly, "After all, acquiring a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique is nearly impossible. Even if one happens to obtain it, it would be heavily encrypted... I've discussed this with our aunt, and she believes this is the case too. If our family truly decides to follow the Bright Yang path, we must gather more relevant spells and techniques, then brainstorm on how to proceed from there..."

Reaching the crux of the matter, he shifted to using mana to transmit his words.

"Our family possesses a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique manual—the Aged Courtly Path Scripture. Xizhi is in the sect, so he can access information relevant to the Purple Mansion Realm. While he can't share the techniques with us, he can use them as a reference to write some content for the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual... Then, you can build upon it... with the help of Li Encheng as well as the Yuan and Xiao families.

"The cultivation techniques we write ourselves will surely have many gaps... In the end, we might have to resort to the Deng Family's method—filling those gaps with human lives over and over again... After several breakthroughs, eventually, we can attempt to reach the Purple Mansion Realm..."

Li Ximing stayed silent, stretching out his hand. The pass on the mountain then reverted into streams of light and returned to him.

"The cave has been revealed," he announced.

Li Xijun pressed his lips together, following Li Ximing. As soon as they entered the cave, they heard the sounds of gurgling water. His eyes glowed with a cold light, allowing him to see everything within the cave clearly.

He soon spotted jagged rocks along the underground river, with a red rock perched at its highest point. It was the size of an ordinary table or stool, glowing brightly, and on its surface were etchings with intricate white lines that were strikingly beautiful.

On top of the red rock was a palm-sized golden stone slab that was about the thickness of a finger. It seemed unremarkable at first glance, but was silently emitting a soft golden and white light.

Li Xijun studied the object for a while but could not figure out what it was. He turned to Li Ximing, who also appeared confused.
𝚏𝕣𝕖𝚎𝚠𝚎𝚋𝚗𝐨𝐯𝕖𝕝.𝕔𝐨𝕞

With a sigh, Li Ximing lamented, "Our family's rise within less than a hundred years has been too swift. Although we have several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators now, we are still largely ignorant about these matters..."

"It's not a problem. As long as we have secured it, we can always ask someone we trust for guidance," Li Xijun responded calmly.

He drew the Hanlin Sword from his waist. He hesitated for a moment, then refrained from using it on the rock and said, "We don't know the origin of this object, nor how to preserve or store it without damage. If we cut it hastily, we risk harming the treasure. It's better to leave it here, in this cave, and seal it with a formation."

Li Ximing paused, then nodded in agreement, feeling that Li Xijun's suggestion made sense. Together, they sealed the cave, set up a formation to conceal it, and made their way home.

"I'll ask my brother to send a team to guard this place," Li Xijun decided.

The two were about to land when they spotted a middle-aged man waiting outside. He seemed proud and aloof with his cultivation at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and he was dressed in a yellow and white Daoist robe from the Profound Peak Gate.

Li Ximing recognized him immediately and greeted him with a warm smile.

"Ah, it's you, fellow Daoist Gusun... What brings you to Moongaze Lake?"

The man was Kong Gusun, a cultivator from Profound Peak Gate. He had accompanied Kong Tingyun to Wutu Peak to open up the fire vein and was well-acquainted with Li Ximing.

Despite his cold expression, Kong Gusun was actually a warm person born with a stoic face. He smiled and replied hoarsely, "Ah... fellow Daoist Ximing! I've come to bring you some good news!"

Li Ximing walked up to him curiously and asked, "What do you mean?"

Kong Gusun politely cupped his fist before continuing, "My uncle was guarding the sect yesterday when he encountered a group of Azure Pond Sect cultivators entering the sea from Lake Xian. It turned out that the leader of that group was Senior Li Xuanfeng from your esteemed clan... He's finally returned from the southern border!

"My uncle also mentioned that Li Xuanfeng had an otherworldly and formidable aura. His cultivation had reached the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, and he was clad in black armor, carrying a golden bow, like a god descending to earth!"

Li Ximing and Li Xijun exchanged startled looks.

"Second Granduncle has returned from the southern border?!"

The southern border was a deadly place for many clan cultivators, where most perished fighting demons. The Li Family had long since lost hope that Li Xuanfeng would ever return.

Years earlier, when Li Xuanfeng broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and earned the trust of Daoist Master Yuan Su, there had been a brief spark of hope. The family was excited by the treasures he sent home and eagerly awaited his return, believing that they might one day be reunited.

But Yuan Su never permitted his return. More than a decade had passed, and Li Xuanfeng was still stuck in the southern border. Hope slowly faded over time. Hence, the surprise in their hearts was indescribable when they heard this news.

Kong Gusun observed the expressions on their faces and knew that his uncle's words had struck a chord. With a scan of his spiritual sense, his eyes widened as he exclaimed in awe, "Ximing, you've established your foundation?!"

Li Ximing's face lit up with joy, and he waved his hand dismissively.

"It was just a stroke of luck, hardly worth bringing it up for discussion."

Li Xijun could not afford to linger around any longer. He left Li Ximing behind to entertain Kong Gusun while he soared into the air and headed toward the town to find Li Xuanxuan.

That old man will surely be overjoyed when he hears this news!

A smile spread across his face at the thought. He still remembered the old man's kind and sincere expression after he took the trip to Hengzhu Dao Gate.

Once he arrived, Li Xijun hurriedly pulled Li Xuanxuan away from his desk where he had been busy drawing talismans, and relayed the good news.

"What?!"

Li Xuanxuan's face flushed bright red with excitement almost right away. He immediately flew up, calling for the younger generation to join him as he rushed toward Qingdu to ask Kong Gusun for more details.

Kong Gusun, taken aback by the sudden crowd, spilled out a stream of praises for Li Xuanfeng.

As Li Xuanxuan's delighted laughter echoed through the air, he turned to the younger cultivators standing beside him and said proudly, "I knew it! This younger brother of mine has always been extraordinary! When Second Uncle was still alive, he used to say that Xuanfeng was the most talented of the Xuan generation—and he was right all along!"

The old man had not felt this happy in a long time. He eagerly pulled Kong Gusun closer and asked, "Which part of the Eastern Sea is my young brother in now?"

"He should be at Splitreed Island's marketplace," Kong Gusun replied.

With that, Kong Gusun cupped his fist politely and prepared to take his leave, and the group of people saw him off.

Li Xuanxuan looked at Li Xijun eagerly and ventured, "Maybe... I can go to the Eastern Sea...?"

Li Xijun smiled at the old man's cautious demeanor and replied, "Granduncle... the Eastern Sea is full of dangers. It's too risky for you to go alone. You should perish the thought!"




# Chapter 558: Request

"Oh," Li Xuanxuan responded somewhat dejectedly.

He straightened his sleeves and sat on the mountain for a while, watching the two juniors chat. Feeling a bit restless, he decided to resume drawing talismans. The two juniors saw him off as he left.

Li Ximing sighed in relief and said, "Grandfather seems to be in better spirits now..."

Li Xijun nodded in agreement and responded softly, "Although the old man's cultivation isn't high, he's experienced much in his life. He's able to answer our questions now, especially on matters we thought had been buried in the sands of time. Seeing him in good spirits truly brings us some relief."

The two walked side by side. Li Ximing, dressed in a lavish golden Daoist robe, paused for a moment before speaking softly.

"I've only heard that Second Granduncle is a phenomenal archer, unrivaled in the world. With his golden bow, he's capable of great feats. If he can return, our home will be well-protected."

"I think that's unlikely. It's not easy for anyone to leave the southern border permanently," Li Xijun replied with a hint of thoughtfulness in his tone.

By the time both of them were born, Li Xuanfeng had already left for the southern border. Since Li Xijun had never met him, his understanding of this Second Granduncle was based on family records and stories from the elders.

Unlike Li Xuanxuan, his joy mostly stemmed from the idea that the family might finally have an elder in the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Now that he had calmed down and his initial excitement had faded away, he began reflecting thoughtfully on the situation.

Li Ximing seemed to be doing the same and asked in confusion, "Since the Second Granduncle has left the southern border, why hasn't he returned to visit home...? Is he on some kind of mission?"

"It seems likely," Li Xijun said with a nod as he paused, then hesitated before continuing, "I've heard that someone from the Ning Family married him. After all these years, perhaps he has children of his own now... That would make those children on the southern border our elders..."

"As for why he hasn't returned... The adults likely have their reasons. Maybe his family is being controlled so he's forced to obey the orders of Azure Pond," he speculated.

Li Ximing nodded and replied, "That makes sense."

The two paused, reflecting on the matter for a while before Li Ximing returned to Wutu Peak to continue his study of alchemy. Li Xijun wrote a letter to his aunt, Li Qinghong, who was in seclusion, and another to send to Zongquan Island. Then, he settled down to practice quietly.

————

Splitreed Island, Azure Pond Market.

Li Xuanfeng circled the sea, familiarizing himself with the terrain and gathering detailed information about Splitreed Island before returning to the market.

The spiritual energy of the earth veins on Splitreed Island was peculiar, making it impossible to set up formations on the island itself.

The Azure Pond Market was located on the seabed not far from the island. Li Xuanfeng investigated the earth vein and learned that the spiritual energy here was not any better, as the market had only been protected by a high-grade formation.

Splitreed Island itself was abundant in spiritual qi and was teeming with treasures and strange terrains. The island had many straits, some deep underground and shrouded in darkness, with vast, boundless spaces. It was said that these remnants were left behind from battles that were fought by immortals.

The island—in its entirety—functioned more like a vast entrance, connecting multiple valleys and straits. Cultivators gathered qi here, while devil cultivators also roamed the gorges, engaging in killings and looting. The deeper one ventured, the more chaotic and dangerous the environment became.

Li Xuanfeng walked around the island but did not venture too deeply, and he soon returned to the market quietly. Upon arrival, he found an Azure Pond cultivator waiting by his cave dwelling.

"Greetings, Daoist. My master would like to meet you and has been waiting for quite some time," the cultivator said respectfully.

Li Xuanfeng immediately recognized him as Ning Heyuan's subordinate. He nodded and followed him to Ning Heyuan's cave dwelling. The door was open, and rich spiritual qi flowed out freely.

Inside, Ning Heyuan was drinking.

"Brother-in-law, you're here!" Ning Heyuan greeted him with a slightly flushed face, as though he had drunk quite a bit.

He filled a wine cup to the brim and gestured for Li Xuanfeng to sit.

"Speaking of which, fate really likes bringing me and the Li Family together..." Ning Heyuan hummed.

Li Xuanfeng nodded, but thought silently to himself, Why is this guy acting so friendly now? Does he have a favor to ask of me?

He stared at Ning Heyuan, who suddenly appeared quite humble, almost like a junior in his presence.

Ning Heyuan continued politely, "When I visited Moongaze Lake with my aunt back then, I had hoped to seek guidance on swordsmanship from your esteemed family. I traded a few blows with Daoist Qinghong while we sparred on the mountain, and we exchanged names. I was overpowered and that was when I truly realized the strength of your family's Dao lineage."

Li Xuanfeng was taken aback by how humbly he spoke. He knew that Li Qinghong, as a Qi Cultivator, would never have been Ning Heyuan's match. At best, she could only evenly match him with her lightning spell. Ning Heyuan's words were likely intended to flatter the Li Family.

Li Xuanfeng smiled and said, "Brother, there's no need to be so modest. I'm well aware of Qinghong's strength... She's certainly not your opponent."

Ning Heyuan responded humbly to Li Xuanfeng's comment. Since the man had said so, he stopped beating around the bush and stated his business.

"Brother-in-law, I've heard of your reputation even overseas. The Daoist Master trusts you greatly... In the past hundred years, only a few have been as favored as you."

Li Xuanfeng was well aware of the trust Yuan Su had placed in him and silently awaited the rest of Ning Heyuan's intentions.

Sure enough, after a brief moment of hesitation, Ning Heyuan said, "Once you return, could you help me find out... how long I must remain in this Eastern Sea?"

Li Xuanfeng lowered his gaze and remained silent. Ning Heyuan grew a bit anxious, but his tone remained polite as he explained, "I've asked several times... but the Daoist Master refused to see me. I understand my mistake now... When I was younger, I was foolish, thinking that because the Ning Family had been allies of the Chi Family for a hundred years, I could do whatever I wanted with those under my family's governance."

His voice grew heavier as he continued, "After spending so many years in the Eastern Sea, I've come to realize that without the Daoist Master, our Ning Family is nothing but a servant to the Chi Family... I truly understand my mistake now. Please, Daoist, I ask you to speak to the Daoist Master on my behalf."

Li Xuanfeng looked at him. Ning Heyuan was talented, had mastered many spells and techniques, and should have been at the level of someone like Ning Wan. However, spending ten years in the Eastern Sea had hindered his reputation and delayed his cultivation.

Now, with a gloomy and slightly decadent expression, Ning Heyuan was a far cry from the proud figure he had once been.

Li Xuanfeng responded softly, "This matter is not urgent... I still have a year or so before I return. Fellow Daoist, please think carefully about how to word your request. I'll take a letter back for you."

Ning Heyuan was momentarily taken aback. Instead of speaking on his behalf, Li Xuanfeng offered to bring his letter back. He smiled wryly, realizing that Li Xuanfeng was not a simple man.

I've been too impatient! I need to take a more measured approach... First, I must build a good relationship with him and win his favor through the connection with my sister. I need a long-term plan!

Ning Heyuan then apologized, took a sip of wine, and nodded.

"Indeed, there's no rush. If the Daoist needs anything in the market, feel free to tell me."
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝒆𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝙤𝒗𝓮𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝙢

Li Xuanfeng nodded and said, "I've just come from the southern border, and some information is difficult to gather there. If there's anything I need in the future, I'll be sure to trouble you again."

Ning Heyuan nodded repeatedly and quickly saw him out. Once Li Xuanfeng left, he returned to his cave dwelling, sat at the jade table, and reflected for a long while.

"I thought he was just a tool for the Daoist Master... but I did not expect him to be a falcon tamed by the old man! No wonder... No wonder he's been so favored by the Daoist Master, and even married Sister Mian despite his insignificant family background!"

Ning Heyuan recalled Li Xuanfeng's attire, aura, and Golden Age Longbow that had been tempered countless times. Combined with some recent rumors, he could not help but sneer.

"An armored man with eyes sharp as a hawk... seems like someone's luck is about to run out!"




# Chapter 559: Journey to Purple Smoke

Li Xijun parted ways with Li Ximing, returning alone to his cave dwelling to rest. Having missed his opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer, he knew it would take some time before he could attempt it again. Sitting in the cave with his hand resting on his sword, he fell into deep thought.

The Bright Yang Dao Lineage might be on Mount Luoxia, but it's unlikely I'll ever have access to it. The techniques granted by the Immortal Mirror are unpredictable and only last through the Foundation Establishment Realm. It seems I can't rely solely on external resources...

Li Xijun had hinted to Li Ximing about the situation to gauge his response, as he knew Li Ximing prioritized cultivation above all else. When he reached a bottleneck in his path, there was no telling what actions he might take. Li Xijun himself felt uncertain about his own Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough, fearing he might not survive it.

If that day truly comes... without me here to mediate, things might get ugly.

This worry weighed heavily on him. Li Yuanjiao remained fixated on the jade buckle, and though Li Xijun could not assist him with it, he understood that Yu Muxian would not be easy to deal with. Should things come to a crisis, Li Yuanjiao's decisive nature would not wait for Yu Muxian to achieve the Purple Mansion Realm.

With a sigh, Li Xijun set these thoughts aside for now.

He bore no resentment toward Li Ximing over this. Li Ximing had been exceptionally gifted since birth, and if he could acquire the right cultivation method, he showed true potential for being the first in the family to achieve the Purple Mansion Realm. The allure of divine abilities was powerful, and it was natural for him to pursue his aspirations with all his focus.

"After all, the allure of roaming the Great Void, divine abilities to reflect the mysteries, living for five centuries, with honors from the immortal sects, freedom to toy with the mortal world, and insight into hidden secrets—such temptations surpass all else!" Li Xijun sighed, convincing himself of such great temptations.

To possess his own Bright Yang divine ability, to traverse the Great Void freely, embracing beauty and warding off calamities without being a pawn to be sacrificed at will... to witness the rise and fall of clouds and to be honored wherever he went, no matter whom he met—such a vision was irresistibly enticing.

The temptation Li Ximing faced was on a different scale altogether... While the rest of them could spend some time on mundane affairs and only circle around the Foundation Establishment Realm sooner or later, Li Ximing's choices could determine whether he ascended to that level. Faced with such a decision, his indecisiveness was understandable. For Li Xijun, it left little room for blame.

As he sat in contemplation, there came a gentle knock at the door of his cave. A young girl entered, dressed in a white dress who was around fifteen or sixteen, with an attractive pair of phoenix eyes. She spoke softly, "Elder Brother, Brother Ming asked me to bring over a dharma artifact..."

This girl was Li Yuexiang, now at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing realm. She did not like to travel, preferring to spend her days on Mount Qingdu. Li Xijun glanced at her and saw that she was offering him a jade bead.

The bead was a rich blue-green and tied with a red string; it was the Azure Manifestation, an exceptional dharma artifact at the Qi Cultivation Realm, just shy of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Li Yuexiang then continued, "Brother Ming mentioned that he has already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, so this artifact, which can summon a peak Qi Cultivation Realm green deer, is of no further use to him. He asked me to bring it to you."

Li Xijun looked at the jade bead and replied softly, "Take it and use it yourself... "

"I spend my days on the mountain and have no need for something this valuable. Let us save it for Chenghuai," Li Yuexiang replied.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

Li Chenghuai, sent back by Li Xizhi, was now studying on the mountain, though he had not yet reached the age for cultivation. Li Yuexiang, strong-willed as ever, firmly declined and placed the bead on the table. Left with no choice, Li Xijun nodded and asked gently, "Have you chosen a spiritual qi type? What technique are you planning to cultivate?"

Li Yuexiang answered, "I plan to consume the Long Marching Pheasant Flame and cultivate the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique."

Noticing she had not consulted Li Yuanjiao on her choice, Li Xijun felt a slight headache coming on but nodded silently. Li Yuexiang added, "Brother, you should think more about yourself."

Li Xijun simply nodded, waving her off, then spread out the registry on the table. Several of the Cheng and Ming generation were close to the Qi Cultivation Realm, and he needed to make proper arrangements for them.

Now, the Qi Cultivation Realm itself was no longer significant; only the Foundation Establishment Realm could bring someone into the Li Family's core decision-making circle. Li Xijun reread the names of the dozen or so disciples, thinking to himself, Who knows how many will fall along the way, or how many will reach the Foundation Establishment Realm...

On Mount Yuting.

Time passed as Li Qinghong continued her cultivation for several months. She opened her eyes and, as usual, circulated her Immortal Foundation, enveloping herself in a field of purple light.

It's time to perform the spell and call upon the lightning again!

Casting the spell and reciting the incantation, powerful purple light surged forward, and lightning flickered. The statues on her right began to light up one by one, and a wave of information flooded her mind, "March 23rd, north of Wintersweet City in Yue State... Mystic Thunder descends on Mount Douxuan... October 6th, Mount Fenkuai in Yue State... Celestial Yin Thunder descends... December 2nd, Goose Lake Island off the Qunyi Cape... Towering Thunder descends..."

A succession of messages unfolded, with over a dozen in total, ending with a hazy, broken phrase, "Flood Dragon kin... forbidden to attain Converging Water... now returns to Heaven and Earth... Falling Water Rising Storm in Eastern Sea."

Li Qinghong processed the information, feeling an inner shock growing within her as realization dawned on her.

A demon king has fallen in the Eastern Sea!

The message from the altar confirmed that a demon king at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm had failed in their Golden Core Realm breakthrough, resulting in death and the dissolution of their Dao. This failure triggered a cascade of celestial phenomena, including the Descent of Thunder and Falling Water Rising Storm.

The news, unexpected as it was, could not be immediately capitalized on, but knowing something of this magnitude put her a step ahead. She could not help but feel a spark of excitement, This altar has this kind of function! Now, with Heaven and Earth in turmoil and even communication talismans failing, its usefulness is immense! If I can know of these events in advance, I can help the family prepare better.

The Dao of thunder shortened one's lifespan. Li Qinghong had already lost about thirty percent of hers in pursuit of it. She did not mind, but she did not wish for other family members to tread the same path. However, seeing it now, there was no alternative.

This altar requires someone who has cultivated either Profound Thunderpool or Winter Thunderclap to operate it... Without someone after me to continue this path, it would be lost.

Turning these thoughts over in her mind, another issue surfaced in her mind, This technique came from Lingyanzi of the Purple Smoke Gate... and I never clarified its origins. I cannot delay this any longer... Regardless of whether this was arranged by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, I must visit Purple Smoke Gate!

Li Qinghong pulled a token from her storage pouch. The token shimmered with a beautiful violet hue, and she gazed at it for a moment.

"Lingyanzi left this token with us back then, allowing my family's disciples to be admitted into the Purple Smoke Gate... This is the perfect opportunity to use it! This time, I will head to the Purple Smoke Gate, pay a visit to Lingyanzi, and then make my way to the Eastern Sea to gather thunder."

Having made her decision, she stood, gathering the few letters by the altar. She casually glanced through them, a faint smile forming as she thought, Second Uncle has finally left the Southern Border!

She then rode a thunderbolt up to Mount Qingdu, where Li Xijun had just finished his cultivation and was having some water in the courtyard.

After Li Qinghong explained her plans, Li Xijun nodded thoughtfully and said in a low voice, "With Situ Mo confined on Golden Sack Island, now is an opportune time to go out. Since you are headed to the Eastern Sea, Aunt, you can also meet Second Granduncle."

"As for the Purple Smoke Gate..." Li Xijun asked, "Which younger family member will we send?"

Li Qinghong pondered briefly, then replied softly, "Most of the Cheng and Ming generation have average talent. Chenghuai needs to remain at home... Yuexiang may be the only one with enough aptitude."

Li Xijun shook his head, "Without Uncle Yuanjiao's approval, it will not work. Let us set this aside for now. Aunt, go to the Eastern Sea and consult Uncle Jiao first, then return at your leisure."

"Very well."

Seeing his reasoning, Li Qinghong nodded in agreement. She gathered her things and set out alone, riding the wind. Li Xijun escorted her to the edge of Moongaze Lake, then returned to his cave dwelling to review his sword techniques twice more before sealing the stone door to resume his cultivation.

On Mount Qingdu, the spring breeze lingered, the grass and trees grew lush, and the immortal towers and pavilions stood with only scattered figures, soon swallowed by the deepening night.

————

As Li Qinghong left Mount Qingdu, a light rain began to fall, and looking out, she saw endless dark clouds stretching across the sky. The rain itself was gentle, but it was unrelenting. She rode the wind through it for a long time and still could not find the edge of this cloud cover.

Had she not received that message from the altar earlier, she would have thought it was just a heavy, lingering rainstorm. But now, she suspected it was the aftermath of a failed Golden Core Realm breakthrough—an ominous celestial phenomenon.

Continuing on her journey, she flew over Yufu Prefecture and Mount Dongli and soon spotted the territory of the Purple Smoke Gate in the distance. There, a female cultivator was standing in midair, dressed in the robes of the Purple Smoke Gate, staring up at the sky with a furrowed brow.

As Li Qinghong approached on a flash of lightning, the female cultivator quickly noticed her and politely bowed, greeting her in a soft voice, "Disciple Shen Yanqing of the Purple Smoke Gate greets the honored elder. May I know..."

"Li Qinghong of the Li Family from Mount Qingdu," Li Qinghong answered promptly.

The female cultivator, who appeared to be around Li Xijun's age and at the seventh heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, looked surprised.

"Ah, so it is you! Yanqing has long admired your name," the girl praised, beaming.

Li Qinghong was not well-known, so she assumed this was merely polite flattery, but then Shen Yanqing stepped forward, speaking sincerely.

"I heard recently that you successfully reached the Foundation Establishment Realm... Female cultivators who practice the way of thunder are already rare, and those who achieve Foundation Establishment Realm are even fewer! I greatly admire you."

Li Qinghong looked at her with some interest and asked, "You also practice the way of thunder?"

"I do!" Shen Yanqing replied with a warm smile as she continued,"I come from the Shen Family in Yue Cultivating Sect, and our Daoist Master once acquired a thunder technique early on. Thus, we have a long-standing tradition of thunder cultivation."

"So... you are a direct line of an immortal clan, then...?" Li Qinghong muttered softly.

The Shen Family was a long-standing immortal clan of the Purple Mansion Realm based in the Xu State's Yue Cultivating Sect. Shen Yanqing was as esteemed as the Xiao Family's Xiao Yuansi. Despite her high status, she showed no arrogance. She enthusiastically guided Li Qinghong down toward the Purple Smoke Gate's territory, asking, "What brings Senior here?"

Li Qinghong replied, "I have come to pay my respects to Senior Lingyanzi."

Shen Yanqing nodded in understanding, producing a purple token to lead her inside. Towering peaks rose into view, and countless summits lay shrouded in dense violet clouds, which coiled and wove in strands, forming various shapes that gave the entire place an ethereal, fairy-like atmosphere. The pavilions and towers stood exquisitely against the scenery.

The Purple Smoke Gate had claimed this wondrous land, gathering many techniques related to it over the years, transforming the mountain into an immortal sanctuary. Cultivators from various regions and even overseas often traveled great distances to gather qi.

Shen Yanqing introduced, "The Purple Smoke Blessed Land is well-known far and wide. It is said that six or seven parts of the world's violet qi flow from here, and all Dao lineages based in violet qi regard this place as a sacred land. If Senior is fortunate, you might even catch sight of the immortal landscape when the morning sun rises!"

Seeing Li Qinghong taking in the breathtaking beauty, Shen Yanqing continued with a smile, "The old peak master used to boast often about his friendship with your clan... I suppose he has finally been proven right."

Li Qinghong recalled that Li Tongya had described Lingyanzi as somewhat eccentric and gave a slight smile in response. Shen Yanqing then softly added, "I myself cultivate Celestial Thunder through the Celestial Cloud Thunder Technique. If I achieve Foundation Establishment Realm, it will become the Lightfall Thunder... May I ask which technique Senior uses?"

Not sure why Shen Yanqing was asking, Li Qinghong still politely replied, "Profound Thunderpool."

Profound Thunderpool... Shen Yanqing pondered this for a moment, frowning slightly. After a brief pause, she muttered quietly, "I have not heard of that one..."

"It originally stemmed from Winter Thunderclap," Li Qinghong added.

Understanding dawned on Shen Yanqing, and she smiled brightly.

"Ah, so it is also a form of Celestial Thunder! If there is ever a chance, I would love to see the senior's thunder altar in action!"

This comment from the girl revealed quite a bit of information, and Li Qinghong felt a spark of insight, thinking to herself, So, it is a form of Celestial Thunder... It seems Celestial Thunder techniques have an affinity for altar-based spells. With the Shen Family's ancient heritage, perhaps I can learn something useful!

Seeing Li Qinghong nod with a smile, Shen Yanqing beamed, her eyes brightening as the conversation drew them closer. She added with a nod, "Our three thunder lineages differ from others; we avoid all blood qi. Because of this, we tend to be especially close to one another. Once I reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, I will be honored to demonstrate the thunder invocation technique for you!"

Li Qinghong paused, a little stunned, realizing for the first time that thunder cultivators should not consume blood qi. In an instant, many doubts in her mind unraveled, bringing her mind a sudden clarity.

No wonder... No wonder there are no thunder Dao lineages in Jiangnan! Thunder techniques faded in both the overseas regions and Jiangnan... That explains why this girl is so warm and friendly with me!

Most pills circulating in Jiangnan were made with blood qi, and if consuming such substances indeed harmed thunder cultivators, then it was inevitable that thunder Dao lineages would decline. Among the Three Sects and Seven Gates, there were few with thunder lineages, much less any capable of cultivating to the Purple Mansion Realm. Meanwhile, most clan cultivators and rogue cultivators did not fully understand this, making it even harder for thunder techniques to be cultivated successfully.

As Shen Yanqing continued, she explained, "There are certain pills, and I am sure Senior knows this as well, that will cause a thunder cultivator's progress to initially surge after consuming blood qi. But soon after, progress slows, and those unaware often take more, causing them to stagnate and face difficulty breaking through, eventually shortening their lifespan..."

Li Qinghong felt a surge of relief. When she was young, her family had been impoverished, without many pills to take. Later, she was sent to the Fei Family, where she similarly had no access to such resources.

By the time she reached the Qi Cultivation Realm, Li Yuanjiao had received the white talisman, and what little the family had went to him. Li Qinghong had taken only one or two pills, likely sourced from the Xiao Family, and somehow avoided further exposure. Years later, when Wang Xun revealed the truth, she had stopped taking them entirely.

Even so, Li Qinghong now understood why her cultivation had slowed around the third and fourth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm—it was likely due to those few pills.

She exhaled slowly, feeling a deep gratitude for her grandfather Li Tongya. She even began to wonder,

Could it be... that Grandfather suspected something and arranged everything so carefully?

Lost in thought for a moment, she quickly adjusted and gained another insight, No wonder this girl is so close to me. If thunder Dao lineages cannot touch blood qi, then they also cannot rely on Shared Dao for cultivation speed or divine ability training... This naturally removes many of the usual reservations.

Shen Yanqing continued to politely introduce the various sights of the Purple Smoke Gate up ahead, while Li Qinghong, now carrying a newfound appreciation and sense of relief, walked through this sect bathed in violet clouds with a lightened heart.




# Chapter 565: Ewu

Ewu had lain in ambush near Golden Sack Island for several years, but his senior brother, Mutuo, still had not emerged from the island.

Both he and Mutuo had originally been monks at Qinling Temple in Youxiang Prefecture. After the Maha's fall, the temple collapsed, and Mutuo and Ewu fled Zhao Prefecture, each going in a different direction.

Qinling Temple's lineage had already been in decline; without even a protector like The Merciful One, and after the fall of the Wrathful One, the lineage had weakened more considerably. Many of their methods for divination and combat were now ineffective, forcing them to hide in various places.

Mutuo, though not skilled in combat, had managed to retain the temple's Dao lineage which allowed him to calculate others' movements, enabling him to live in relative comfort. Ewu himself, however, despite being stronger, lacked comparable divination skills which made his years rather difficult in comparison.

He had fled Zhao Prefecture to the Eastern Sea, passing through the Scarlet Pristine Sea when he sensed that something was wrong. Setting up a high altar for divination, he discovered that his senior brother's physical body had been shattered, and he was so wounded that he did not even dare reincarnate back in Zhao. His heart stirred at this revelation, "In normal times, you can hide your aura, preserve the lineage, and evade my searches... But now that your vial qi is depleted, the opportunity has finally come for this old monk!"

Over the years, Ewu had encountered a few fortuitous events. Combining these new skills with his knowledge of the Dao, he managed to divine Mutuo's location after vomiting three mouthfuls of blood, tending to his wounds before setting up his ambush.

The inheritance of Buddhist cultivators was tied to destiny, and Qinling Temple's Dao lineage was intricately linked to Mutuo's fate. As Mutuo's junior brother, if he could kill Mutuo and absorb his essence, the lineage would naturally fall into his hands.

However, despite lying in wait for several years, Mutuo had yet to appear. Instead, Ewu sensed the presence of a treasured artifact. The Buddhist cultivators of Zhao Prefecture were not known for much, but they were unmatched in survival techniques. Bold as ever, Ewu decided to investigate first, rushing off on the wind.

Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng was standing still, cultivating on the sea, awaiting news from Golden Sack Island to the south when he saw a flash of golden light racing in from the north.

The figure hovered nearby, circling the area.

Using a perception technique, he took a closer look. Sure enough, it was a large monk with a long face and deep-set eyes, holding a pair of short staves. His entire body was flushed red, and his eyes were wide with anger. Clearly, he was a member of the Wrathful Dao lineage.

This monk's aura was intense, with a golden flame blazing all around him. Li Xuanfeng observed him from a distance, quietly reaching for the Golden Age Longbow strapped to his back and watching the newcomer intently.

Is this Mutuo...?

Li Xuanfeng watched coldly, sensing that something was off. According to Ning Family's intelligence, Mutuo should have been severely injured and not yet recovered, and besides, he was not known for wielding dual staves.

Seems this is an ally of Mutuo's... another lackey of the Wrathful Dao...

Although he had not managed to lure Mutuo out, he had instead caught the attention of a Wrathful Dao monk. Li Xuanfeng kept his gaze fixed on him, waiting patiently with his bow.

The monk, wearing half a robe and carrying two long staves on his back, looked like a warrior monk. He patrolled the sea area where the artifact's aura had been sensed, circling around the same spot. Li Xuanfeng kept his distance, relying on his perception technique to watch from afar, undetected.

Li Xuanfeng's Black Gold Spirit Armor, a Foundation Establishment Realm armor known as Black Tiger Eyes, naturally concealed his aura, making it unlikely that the monk would even be able to detect him if he approached. Still, aware of the Buddhist cultivators' strange abilities, he kept his distance, just in case.

Ewu frowned as he scanned the area. Suddenly, he perked up, his keen eyes spotting someone flying in from the south, lurking suspiciously and circling the area. However, this newcomer's cultivation level was merely at the late Qi Cultivation Realm. Seeing an easy target, Ewu sped towards him and shouted, "Who goes there!"
𝒻𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝘮

The Golden Sack Island cultivator jumped in fright, sneaking a glance at Ewu and confirming he was indeed a Buddhist monk. He thought to himself, So, this must be the one with the treasured Buddhist artifact that the lord spoke of. I will have a few words with him and let the lord handle it!

He took a step back, intending to deflect Ewu's attention and then return to the island. Confident in his connections, he replied softly, "Greetings, senior. I am from Golden Sack Island..."

However, before he could even finish his sentence, Ewu's face contorted into a cruel smile. Reaching out, he sent a force surging through the cultivator's body, causing his face to flush and his forehead to bead with sweat as he scrambled to reach for the talisman hidden in his sleeve.

Ewu's combat skills were exceptional, even among monks. Master Monks were inherently stronger than Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and even with his Dao lineage weakened, he was far too much for this cultivator. The cultivator felt a rush of blood to his head as the monk moved in closer to him, grabbing him by the collar.

The cultivator opened his mouth to plead, but a mouthful of blood spurted out instead. His protective barrier flashed brightly, but it was merely a Qi Cultivation Realm shield and disintegrated instantly under the Master Monk's strike.

"My lord! My lord..."

Ewu ignored his cries, dislocating the cultivator's limbs and pulling out his white bones almost effortlessly.

Pressing a hand on his skull, Ewu— though unskilled in soul searching techniques— had learned a thing or two. After scanning through the cultivator's recent three-day memories, he laughed loudly and said, "Situ Mo is truly a coward! If not for that, my senior brother would have fallen into my hands long ago."

Not only did he spare the cultivator, but he used his mana to keep him alive. Carrying the limp body, he found a banyan tree on the island and secured the cultivator's head to it, preserving his life force.

Then, taking a handful of blood from the corpse nearby, he smeared it across his face, his features twisting and shifting until they morphed into the appearance of the Golden Sack Island cultivator.

"Hmm...Heh,"

Ewu chuckled sinisterly before rising on the wind, flying south with a carefree air.

After a good ten breaths, Li Xuanfeng finally landed by the edge of the island. He took slow, measured steps forward and raised his gaze to look at the large banyan tree.

The head affixed to the tree bore a strange expression, somewhere between a smirk and a sneer, a mingle between anger and excitement. It seemed that this man was still alive, caught in some delusion of escape or dreams of revenge. Li Xuanfeng studied him intently, his eyes narrowing. The sand and pebbles at his feet clinked and rattled, jumping and scraping against each other which produced a sharp, grating sound.

His gaze grew fierce, as if he could devour a person at any moment.

This man's fate reminded Li Xuanfeng of his younger brother, Li Xuanling, who had been beaten and killed and his body devoured at Zhenhui Temple.

Back then, only Li Tongya had managed to bring back the remains, and even that was just a lone head. Li Xuanfeng had been stationed in the Southern Border and had not witnessed it himself. Now, staring at this head, a boiling rage surged within him, his eyes nearly splitting in fury.

Unlike Li Xuanxuan, who had broken down in sorrow and hatred, allowing inner demons to take root, Li Xuanfeng's expression grew colder the deeper his hatred grew. In his mind, he calmly analyzed the upcoming situation, his bowstring vibrating slightly and producing a series of sharp, eagle-like whistles in the air.

He then turned, striding step by step along the coastline until he reached the shore. He lifted on the wind, headed straight toward Golden Sack Island.

Disguised as the Golden Sack Island cultivator named Situ Er, Ewu flew swiftly on the wind. Halfway there, he encountered someone—a man in a golden robe, at the Foundation Establishment Realm, clearly a guest cultivator from Golden Sack Island.

Though Ewu had used specialized spells and blood qi to create a perfect disguise, it was not flawless before a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, especially if that cultivator specialized in perception techniques. Without any delay, Ewu hurriedly used the title from Situ Er's recent memory, saying urgently, "Master Zong, do not delay! Report back to the island at once!"

Ewu continued, "A monk and a cultivator are fighting up ahead, struggling over something that is shining like gold! They have taken the fight to the ocean floor, and it is a matter of life and death! Please, honored guest, alert the lord immediately!"

This Master Zong had dispatched five or six scouts earlier, with the person Ewu was impersonating being the first to return. Hearing this, he did not dare linger. He quickly replied, "Understood! Point me in the direction; I will go ahead and keep watch while you return to report."

Ewu had planned for every reaction, ready to adapt as needed. Casually, he pointed the guest cultivator in a direction, then continued on his journey to the island. Landing at the edge of Golden Sack Island, he spotted a rough-looking monk flying toward him.

"Senior Brother!"

Ewu was momentarily startled; his disguise might pass before a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, but fooling Mutuo, a fellow Master Monk, would be far more challenging.

However, Mutuo only cast him an impatient glance and snapped, "What is going on?!"

Only then did Ewu recall that Mutuo's physical body had been shattered, rendering him unable to recognize people accurately. Holding back a grin, he swiftly conveyed the message, prompting Mutuo to grow tense. The monk immediately flew off to find Situ Mo, while Ewu waited cautiously outside the formation.

Inside the hall, Mutuo, who was now dripping in sweat, feeling both furious and alarmed, exclaimed urgently, "Situ, get me three or four guest cultivators at once!"

Situ Mo, having overheard the conversation between the two earlier, merely frowned in suspicion.

"Could it really be true? It sounds too good to be true... I suggest we send someone to check it out first..."

"No!"

Mutuo, still visibly shaken, sighed, "Thank the heavens you had the foresight to act carefully! The person just now was no longer Situ Er! He was actually my junior brother! He must think my physical body is too damaged to see through his disguise, but he does not know that the Master taught me the secret technique of Blood Mask... I recognized him the moment I saw him!"

"Your junior brother...?" Situ Mo repeated. Ever quick-witted, he grasped the situation instantly. Speaking in a low voice, he asked, "What do you intend to do?"

Mutuo said urgently, "Stop wasting time squabbling! If we delay too long, that sly bastard will grow suspicious. Just bring a few guest cultivators with me, and I will lure him into the formation..."

"Rubbish!" Situ Mo cut him off sharply, "Do you think he will walk into the formation willingly? You are better off taking a few guest cultivators with you and setting an ambush around him!"

Mutuo paused, momentarily stunned, realizing that Situ Mo's reasoning made perfect sense. If this were truly a trap and he were anxious to escape, he would not needlessly call others into the formation; doing so would only arouse Ewu's suspicion and might cause him to abandon the plan.

Without stopping to praise Situ Mo, he hurriedly called four guest cultivators to join him and sped out on the wind.

As Situ Mo watched the group leave, he felt a slight pang of realization, thinking to himself, So it was the Wrathful Dao lineage's ambush after all. I knew this was too good to be true...

He took a couple of steps forward, just reaching the edge of the formation, and calculated, "With Mutuo and the four guest cultivators... There is no way this Ewu can escape. I should still exercise caution and refrain from leaving the formation recklessly..."

Taking a step back, he stood within the gleaming formation, watching the outside in silence.

Mutuo, now outside the formation, was flanked closely by the four guest cultivators who guarded him tightly. The disguised Ewu, posing as Situ Er, grinned and said excitedly, "My lord, come with me!"

Mutuo nodded, moving forward on the wind toward the north, preparing to strike. The four men at his side subtly edged closer to Ewu.

The four guest cultivators, all at the Foundation Establishment Realm, displayed no change in their expressions, but their actions were telling. After flying only ten li, Ewu finally sensed that something was amiss, his mind suddenly alert. Noticing this, Mutuo, who had been watching carefully, shouted out a single command.

"Attack!"

All four guest cultivators sprang into action instantly. Golden, radiant artifacts flew from their hands, weaving a blazing web in the sky as they launched their assault on Ewu.

These artifacts were all of the Golden Tang Gate, but their techniques varied wildly, chaotic and unrefined—clearly, these guest cultivators were originally Eastern Sea cultivators who later joined Golden Sack Island. Their power, however, was nothing extraordinary.

"You damned dogs!"

Ewu reacted quickly, forming a hand seal that emitted light. Golden flames ignited around his limbs, and a three-headed, six-armed figure materialized behind him, each hand wielding a short staff or hatchet.

Seeing this, Mutuo burst into laughter and sneered, "With me here, do you still think you can escape using some escape spell? You really spared no effort, even bringing a treasured artifact to bait me... Now, it seems you have lost both your plan and your prize!"

Though his aura was weak, Mutuo effortlessly cast a hand seal that shot a beam of light forward. Without further motion, the light blurred the shadowy figure behind Ewu. With a cold smirk, Mutuo declared pridefully, "I am the true head of Qinling Temple!"

With his inheritance intact, Mutuo had little difficulty breaking Ewu's spell. He called the four Golden Sack Island cultivators to close in on Ewu while he kept his distance, merely interfering with Ewu's spells from afar.

"...So Senior Brother held back a trick or two when he passed down the teachings!"

Surrounded by his opponents, Ewu remained calm, cursing bitterly under his breath and responding coldly, "Do not underestimate me, Senior Brother!"

Golden light flowed from his hands as he drew two long staves, each intricately etched with golden patterns. He crossed them together with a loud clang, deflecting the four incoming attacks.

With a fierce stance, he swung the staves at his attackers, ignoring the weapons piercing his body. His eyes glowed with golden light, heating the air around him in visible waves.

The physical bodies of Buddhist cultivators resembled clay; when the weapons pierced through his body, no blood emerged, instead, the wounds sealed with a sticky resilience after each strike. Nonetheless, Ewu's ferocity made the guest cultivators hesitate, not wanting to sustain injuries that could disrupt their cultivation. For now, they moved cautiously, making sure they did not get too close.

Of course, none of them expected to capture the monk immediately. Without employing their full Immortal Foundation abilities, they tested each other's strengths.

The flashes of light clashed constantly, creating violent explosions in the sky. Mutuo's eyes gleamed with greed as he cast a glance at his junior brother, Ewu, and muttered, "If I devour your body, I can cut down decades of recovery time!"

Ewu sneered, assessing the battlefield. He had several backup plans and felt certain he would not die here. At most, he would have to surrender this Master Monk's body to Mutuo. For now, his only thought was to escape with minimal losses.

You may escape, but can that artifact on you escape as well?

Mutuo, sensing Ewu's intentions, smirked to himself. He coughed, spitting out blood, then wiped the corner of his mouth. Examining the dark red blood in his palm, he suddenly froze.

"What is going on...?"

A chill spread across his face, and blood began to drip steadily. Turning his head slightly, he felt as if his left eye were about to burst, his remaining vision filled with overwhelming golden light.

This golden light seemed to stretch across the sky, vast and penetrating, though barely visible if he tried to look directly at it. A searing pain pricked his face, filling him with dread.

"This damned traitor has backup!"




# Chapter 567: A Kill By Arrow

Li Xuanfeng waited a while, watching as the two monks began to turn on each other.

Ever since Ewu had disguised himself as a member of the Situ Family, Li Xuanfeng had anticipated that a good show was about to unfold. Standing on his golden shuttle, he hovered quietly, observing from above.

As he saw the two monks fly north and clash in the sky, Li Xuanfeng raised his left hand and pulled the longbow from his back. Gripping the bow with one hand and drawing the string with the other, he cast a cold glance and, without hesitation, selected Mutuo as his target.

"This one is easier to kill and more likely to panic and retreat back into the formation... I will take him out first."

He exhaled deeply, his fierce eyes widening, and his black-gold armor emitted a radiant glow. A Golden Light Profound Arrow, crafted from refined gold, jumped out from the quiver at his waist and obediently set itself onto the bowstring.

The Golden Age Longbow he held had been reforged in Yi Mountain City, now much improved from its former self. It measured eight chi and six cun in length, with limbs three chi and five cun long, making it even longer than it had been in the past. The bow gleamed with a subdued golden light, the entire surface shimmering as though alive.

If stood upright on the ground, it would tower over an average person from Zhao Prefecture by at least a head. Held horizontally, it resembled a mighty siege crossbow.

The golden arrow, also a dharma artifact, measured about four chi in length. It bore no complex patterns—its sleek, sharp lines were honed to perfection by a master craftsman in the Southern Border, and it was as heavy as an iron ox.

Creak... creak... creak...

Li Xuanfeng slowly drew the bowstring, tilting the golden bow from horizontal to a slight angle, its impressive eight chi span looking like the outstretched wings of a great eagle from a distance.

Whoosh!

As the golden light intensified even more, Li Xuanfeng narrowed his gaze, his eyes spanning hundreds of li as he fixed on Mutuo's hideous face.

"Take this!"

Li Xuanfeng suddenly released his hold, and the golden arrow vanished into thin air. Without pausing to observe the outcome, he reached for a second golden arrow, placing it onto the string and aiming once more.

————

Mutuo had just wiped the blood from his face when a sudden, overwhelming terror gripped his body. Blood began to well up on his face like dewdrops, one after another, spilling uncontrollably. He let out a desperate scream, "Save...!"

He barely managed to utter a single word before the four guest cultivators around him noticed his strange state and moved back, planning to join forces to protect him—only to hear a faint hum.

Hummm...

They looked closer, and Mutuo's once-pale head was now gone.

Where his neck had been was now a smooth, mirror-like surface. Fine tendrils of flesh extended from the edge of the severed neck, waving in the air as though trying to regrow the head. Yet, as soon as they extended beyond the cut, they all snapped off cleanly.

The vitality of Zhao Buddhist cultivators was nearly unmatched, rivaled only by devil cultivators. Mutuo's hands flailed wildly in the air in a panic he had never felt before, not even when he had been crushed to pieces beneath Kong Tingyun's Golden Mountain. He staggered two steps in the air, his hands reaching for his neck, but as soon as his fingers touched the severed edge, they, too, snapped off with a wet, slicing sound.

Hummm...

A second hum rang out, and Mutuo vanished, leaving only a few wisps of blood mist in the air.

Almost simultaneously, statues in several temples on Golden Sack Island exploded, scattering into clouds of stone dust. Several infants also burst into blood mist without warning, leaving the ground soaked in blood.

The guest cultivators in the air and Ewu all froze, watching in shock as Mutuo was obliterated, body and soul, right before their eyes. In an instant, both sides had forgotten about fighting or fleeing.

Ewu felt an intangible connection gradually creeping over him. His senior brother, Mutuo, had been annihilated before him, and Qinling Temple's inheritance naturally transferred over to him. The prize he had long sought after landed in his hands effortlessly, but his face showed no joy. Instead, he murmured in a daze, "What... what was that... it was an arrow... an arrow..."

He coughed, spitting out flecks of blood, feeling his face sting as if cut by a blade. Tiny beads of blood seeped from his left cheek. With no time to cry out, he hastily formed a hand seal, unleashing a hundred beams of golden light around him.

Ewu was already stronger than Mutuo, and with the temple's inheritance now transferred to him, his power surged even more. However, he was thoroughly terrified, and the hundred beams of golden light encircled his body as he fled desperately, riding the wind through the sky.

The guest cultivators from Golden Sack Island were both frightened and bewildered. The man they had been ordered to protect had been obliterated before their eyes, leaving them with feelings too complex to describe. Glancing at the blood mist in the air and the frenzied Ewu fleeing eastward, one of them remarked, "This monk has numerous life-preserving techniques... perhaps he has already resurrected on the island!"

Another cultivator, his face pale with fear, shook his head.

"Should we give chase?"

They exchanged a glance, each seeing the terror in each others' eyes, then silently set off in pursuit to the north, moving so slowly they looked more like they were taking in the scenery than giving chase.

Ewu had barely fled two li when a chilling sensation swept over his body. A sharp hum filled his ears, and he instinctively darted to the side, his arm erupting in searing pain. Glancing down, he saw a bloody hole in his palm.

For a Buddhist cultivator, this kind of wound was hardly serious. Buddhist cultivators did not depend heavily on their physical bodies; their flesh could be easily reshaped and mended at will. Usually, a mere brush of the hand would be enough to close such a wound.

But now, blood dripped unceasingly from the injury, and Ewu felt an intense, numbing pain with no sign of healing. His pupils widened, and he felt a surge of panic.

Li Xuanfeng's attack had immense power. Ewu had encountered formidable enemies before—those from elite Immortal Sects often wielded techniques of this caliber. But what truly terrified Ewu was another question that danced in his mind.

"Where is he?!"

The attack was blindingly fast, seeming to pierce through the great void itself, or perhaps emanate from an endless, unseen distance. Ewu had no idea where his opponent was positioned. Was he moving farther away with each desperate attempt to escape... or was he getting closer?

The unknown was more frightening than raw power. Unable to see even the shadow of his enemy, he was left in complete ignorance of the enemy's energy drain, attack intervals, or range. An icy dread crept up his spine, and he felt droplets of blood beginning to seep from his chest.

"He is toying with me—damn it!"

A flash of realization hit Ewu. He cast a new spell, forming a hand seal. Behind him appeared the figure of a three-headed, six-armed figure, and he shouted, "Supreme Dharma Empowerment, Vajra Golden Body!"

His skin instantly began to glow, shifting from red to a bright, lustrous gold, as if forged from bronze with unmatched solidity. Tiny runes danced across his skin, moving in a rhythmic, pulsing flow.

Pfft!

In the next moment, however, he spat out a mouthful of pale, golden blood. The golden mist dispersed in the air, sparkling under the sunlight in a surreal display.

A hole the width of a forearm had been punched clean through Ewu's chest, exposing the greenish-red seawater behind him. Despite his empowered form, he finally caught sight of the golden projectile that had struck him.
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝘦𝓌𝑒𝑏𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝘭.𝒸𝘰𝑚

It was a slender, brilliant golden arrow, sharp and translucent, gleaming like the mythical Phoenix itself.

Forcing himself to suppress his terror, Ewu gently touched the wound and finally understood.

"So that is the true power of this attack... If this had been before Maha's fall, my dharma body might have held up... what a pity."




# Chapter 568: Destroyed Body

"I knew it... It's an arrow... When did such a powerful archer with a golden bow emerge in the Eastern Sea to take my life for no reason?!"

Since Ewu could clearly see the enemy, the panic in his heart began to subside. In its place, a deep wave of hatred surged. Thanks to his vajra body, he survived the attack and was able to determine the direction from which the golden phoenix-like profound arrow had come from.

"This arrow came from the front... so the enemy must be in the east. Damn it... I came all the way here for nothing!"

Realizing the direction of the attack, Ewu immediately returned. He quickly turned and rode the dharma light, flying toward the west.

He performed a hand seal, and his two long staves began to glow with golden light, thickening and stretching outward. The smell of burning incense emanated from them, radiating arcs of light that gradually formed into a circular shield.

"Qinling Shield."

Ewu did not have many defensive spells at his disposal. With one staff behind his back while the other pressed against his chest, he made sure his heart and vital organs were well protected as he rode the wind.

Although Ewu had never seen this man before, he was betting that such a powerful attack should not be easy to execute. But just as he thought he was safe, a buzzing sound suddenly rang in his ears, followed by a sharp pain shooting through his chest and back.

The sound tore through his ears, echoing constantly and almost to no end, causing his ears to bleed. A wave of raw fear surged in his heart. Ewu realized this was not just any ordinary sound—it was the result of the enemy's immortal foundation or its supporting spell.

His mind raced.

It's someone from the immortal sect, but not the Golden Tang Gate... Which one has such a powerful disciple? Could it be the sword gate?

Then, a tremendous shock hit his chest. The long staff in his hand let out a mournful cry before flying out of his grasp, spinning twice in the air. Ewu clutched his chest, feeling a new hole the size of a cow's eye in his left chest.

A Buddhist cultivator's dharma artifact was inferior. By the time he recovered his long staff again, he realized that it was now slightly bent.

Ewu was filled with dread.

He attacked from the front again! He's doing this on purpose!

The man's archery skills were unmatched, and Ewu had never encountered such a terrifying immortal arrow before in his life. It felt as though the archer was toying with him, striking for amusement. No matter which direction he took, the enemy could seemingly hit him at will.

Having fought in countless battles before, Ewu instinctively dove into the depths of the sea to escape at this critical moment. But just as he did, a cold shiver ran down the back of his neck.

Here it comes again...

He tried to unleash another spell, but a burst of Astral Qi pierced through his body with astounding power yet again, creating yet another small hole. It moved through his skin and organs, interrupting Ewu's spell twice until he ultimately failed to perform it.

Panic surged in Ewu's heart, growing to an unbearable intensity. He performed another hand seal with both hands and then yelled, "Paramita Technique—Body Sacrifice!"[1]

In an instant, his pale face and body melted rapidly, transforming into a golden light that enveloped him completely. Ewu radiated powerful energy, yet he did not feel any sense of security—only a chilling sense of dread creeping over him.

The buzzing in his ears intensified, almost like a million birds chirping in unison, and blood continued flowing from both of his ears. He expended his dharma body so that he could focus his gaze to the maximum. Finally, he saw five golden lights streaking toward him like meteors, their tails glowing brightly.

Hummm!

Clouds of vapor rose from the seawater, and Ewu opened his mouth to let out a roar, finally releasing the primal fear that gripped his heart. The five golden lights seemed to vanish, but he realized he was now nothing more than a head attached to a pair of shoulders—the rest of his dharma body had completely vaporized.

At this point, Ewu's heart turned as cold as seawater. He raised his arms, and without waiting for the next golden blast to strike, he twisted his own neck with a sharp, deliberate motion.

SNAP.

Ewu snapped his own neck. He had intentionally avoided using his dharma body's power, choosing instead to kill himself in the seawater. The golden light raced in, turning his torso into all but a bloody puddle as his head flew into the air, causing a massive wave to form on the surface of the sea.

The waves churned violently before slowly calming down, leaving only thick, dark clouds overhead. A drizzle began to fall on the sea before the four gusts of dharma winds finally arrived.

The leader of the guest cultivators gulped nervously, looking at the three others standing beside him. None of them dared to meet his gaze; they all lowered their heads and kept their eyes on the ground.

While the group was at a loss for what to do, a dark golden light slowly emerged before them. A middle-aged man appeared, riding on a flying shuttle. He reached out, catching Ewu's severed head falling from the dark clouds, and with a wave of his sleeve, he collected his dharma artifact and coldly surveyed the group.

This man had a chilling presence, dressed in imposing-looking black-gold armor with a longbow slung across his back. One hand rested behind him, while the other held the severed bald head with terrified eyes frozen in time.

Ewu's head, still dripping with blood, stained the man's strong arm. He said nothing, merely gazing at the group in silence.

RUN!

That was the thought that crossed the minds of the group simultaneously, but none of them dared to move a finger. A chilling wave of fear washed over them as the middle-aged man approached, step by step. Each of them lowered their heads, staring at the surface of the sea. Finally, the leader of the group spoke.

"T-Thank you for your help, Senior... We were..."

He was sweating profusely, his voice trembling as he spoke. Behind him, a figure swiftly flew over. It was Master Zong, whom Ewu had sent away earlier. He circled around, eventually finding the group. Shock and excitement filled his face as he approached and began speaking to the group in a flurry of words.

"Master Fu! Lord Situ must have used some kind of talisman... Just now, during the fight, I..."

SLAP!

He had only spoken half of his sentence when he sensed the strange atmosphere. He was then slapped across the face unceremoniously, causing him to stagger backward in shock and confusion.

The guest cultivator surnamed Fu, already sweating bullets, quickly pressed his head down and continued speaking, "We are but humble cultivators from the cape. We didn't mean to disturb the immortal sect's emissary! Please forgive us, Senior..."

Master Zong, noticing the grim expressions of his colleagues that seemed like they wanted to devour him alive, quickly suppressed his anger.

Li Xuanfeng's cold gaze swept past him and warned in a dangerously cold voice, "Go back and tell Situ Mo this—if he dares take even half a step off this island, I will shoot his head off and kick it like a ball."

Master Fu nodded quickly, understanding the gravity of the situation. This was a conflict between immortal sects, and he was just a small cultivator from overseas with no power or influence. All he could do was deliver the message. He dared not even wipe the sweat from his brow, nodding frantically as he replied, "This humble cultivator understands..."

Li Xuanfeng's black-gold armor glowed slightly before he finally vanished into thin air. The oppressive atmosphere finally lifted, and the crowd's tense expressions began to soften.

Master Zong, still reeling from the unexpected slap, was left angry and confused. He looked around at the group, his eyes filled with bewilderment.

Master Fu wiped the sweat from his brows and scolded, "You should be relieved that you're still alive because you didn't say anything that would've made things worse!"

Master Zong sort of understood the situation and whispered, "Which immortal sect's lord was that?"

"Who knows? You thought that was a talisman attack, but in reality, it was just a few arrows released by that man! Looking at his appearance... he may be from the Golden Feather Immortal Sect..." Master Fu replied hoarsely.

1. Paramita is a Buddhist term that is often translated as "Perfection". ☜

Li Xuanfeng, who was now quite some distance away from the group of cultivators, took out his hand that he had been hiding behind his back. His wide palm was now covered by tiny cuts that were slowly opening and closing like a baby's mouth. Blood was flowing freely from his fingers.

"I was fighting pretty recklessly..." he muttered to himself.

With a swift motion, Li Xuanfeng put away the severed head. The five arrows in his quiver were still vibrating slightly, seemingly thirsty for more action. The golden light from them intertwined with each other beautifully, like twinkling lights following an invisible rhythmic dance.

Li Xuanfeng had five Profound Arrows, all crafted from refined gold. After being shot, the arrows would fly back to him obediently. After their flight earlier, the five dharma artifacts seemed particularly excited, constantly buzzing energetically in their quiver.

Raising his gaze, Li Xuanfeng glanced around him before raising his longbow again. This time, he did not use the golden arrows. Instead, he drew the bow, causing the mana on the bowstring to converge, forming an Astral Arrow.

Swoosh.

The arrow whistled through the air, flying a hundred li, passing through the dense forest on an island in the sea, and striking the sinister head affixed to a massive banyan tree.

BOOM!

The head on the tree exploded with a loud bang, now reduced to dust along with the swaying banyan tree, leaving only blood stains on the ground.

Earlier, Ewu had kept this Situ Family's member alive, deliberately grafting him onto a banyan tree to avoid raising suspicion with Mutuo. Now, with the situation settled, Li Xuanfeng ended it with a single arrow, sparing the man from his endless struggle on the tree.
𝐟𝚛𝕖𝚎𝕨𝗲𝐛𝚗𝐨𝐯𝐞𝕝.𝐜𝗼𝗺

Li Xuanfeng gently wiped his palm, ensuring that the surface of his hand showed no sign of injury. Thankfully, the wounds were not serious—just a month or two of healing would suffice.

Ewu, after all, was an old Master Monk. Despite his declining Dao lineage, he was not to be underestimated, unlike the weak Mutuo who was obliterated with just two arrows. Hence, Li Xuanfeng had no choice but to attack mercilessly before this thing had the chance to escape.

"Too bad. If he had hesitated just a moment longer, he could have been shot right here."

Though the Master Monk had chosen suicide to escape, Li Xuanfeng still had to make things unpleasant for him. Astral Qi was not easy to neutralize and would continue to worsen his injuries. Without external help, Ewu would eventually die, slowly and painfully.

Before Ewu could purge the Astral Qi from his body, Li Xuanfeng's Golden Age would have sensed his presence if he came even within a hundred li, and with a single arrow, Li Xuanfeng could have made him flee again.

Li Xuanfeng had spent decades on the southern border, disheartened before growing more proud and confident. The news he had heard from the Ning Family left him seething in resentment for the longest time. And now, after obliterating and gravely injuring the two Buddhist cultivators, the hatred in his heart had finally eased slightly.

He murmured, "Just you wait... this is only the interest, not the price..."

After killing his way through the battle earlier, most of his mana reserve had been drained. As he flew through the dark, swirling clouds, Li Xuanfeng squinted, carefully considering his next steps.

Situ Mo is cautious. Since he's already revealed his strength, I don't think I can hide things much longer given his family's influence. I might as well use this opportunity to deter him or make him too fearful to leave the island. That way, he won't be able to harass my family's descendants.

Situ Mo's caution was unexpected, and Li Xuanfeng decided not to make things more difficult for the island's guest cultivators. He was in no condition to continue fighting, so he might as well stay to intimidate Situ Mo.

Thunder rumbled more frequently overhead, and the sky grew darker with ink-like clouds. Looking up at the misty expanse, the rain showed no sign of stopping. Li Yuanjiao always handled matters with caution, and since he was unable to gather information on where the Li Family had settled down in the Eastern Sea, Li Xuanfeng could only return to Splitreed Island.

It was dark on the sea, and Li Xuanfeng continued flying in the rain for a long time before he saw Splitreed Island in the distance. Diving into the sea, he was greeted by Ning Heyuan, who approached him with a smile.

"Brother-in-law, how did it go?"

"Not bad," Li Xuanfeng replied vaguely with a nod.

Ning Heyuan did not press further, merely laughing in response.

"Fellow Daoist Qinghong has arrived at the marketplace and is waiting for you!" he informed.

"Qinghong is here?!" Li Xuanfeng responded as he finally smiled, hurrying a few steps forward before flying toward the marketplace.

————

Eastern Sea, Qunyi Strait.

The islands in Qunyi Strait were densely packed, scattered across every corner of the strait with sizable populations living on them. Since these islands were near Shiqi Island, many Sons of Diyang were cultivating there.

On a remote, narrow island, the highest mountain was covered with barren, exposed boulders. At the top of the mountain stood a small temple, where five or six locals were silently praying.

The statue before them was carved from a massive boulder but was strangely white. At that moment, it began to shake, causing fine stone fragments and dust to rain down on the worshippers.

Speechless and fearful, the locals continued kneeling and bowing in reverence. Suddenly, the statue exploded, and a tiny baby jumped out from the rubble.

He was covered in blood, but disturbingly had only a head and a pair of shoulders. Everything chest down was missing.

The baby fell onto the ground with a thud, and a voice that sounded like a middle-aged man's came out of his mouth.

"Ah! Ah! Damn it! Damn it! Which immortal sect's disciple is he from...?!"

This baby, of course, was Ewu. Tears of blood were streaming from his eyes. While the local worshippers were still stunned, Ewu went up to one of them and stuffed his hand into his small mouth.

In a swift motion, the baby swallowed an entire arm whole. As soon as he did so, he grew considerably, and it did not take long for him to soon reach the size of a seventeen or eighteen-year-old young adult.

Yet, his body was still horrifying to look at—it was only a head sitting on top of his shoulders. Ewu's expression changed as the moment when Mutuo was obliterated before his eyes suddenly flashed before his eyes.

"Damn... there's something strange about this person."

He beckoned the last remaining local worshipper over, then raised his hand with nails that were as sharp as knives. Without warning, he severed the man's head and shoulders with a quick, clean slash.

With his hands on the ground, Ewu launched himself into the air and landed on the bloody stump of the corpse's chest, seamlessly merging himself with the body.

"Ah... so much better!"

Ewu took two steps forward. A small smile briefly appeared on his face before it quickly faded and froze into a grim expression.

PFFFT!

An inexplicable fluctuation erupted through his upper shoulders, causing the mortal body below to disintegrate into pieces. Ewu landed heavily on the ground again with a thud, feeling as though he had fallen into an ice cellar.

"What a brilliant immortal art!"

No matter how powerful a Buddhist cultivator's life-preserving abilities were, they could not sustain him in this form for long. While the scriptures declared that the physical body was just a vessel for the soul—one that could be replaced at will—a soul without this vessel would eventually drown in the secular world.

In that moment, Ewu realized the grim truth—unless he found a treasured panacea that was suitable for blood nourishment, he would perish within two or three years. He simply could not afford to hide away and cultivate slowly; time was of the essence. With no other choice, he steeled himself, summoned the wind, and flew toward the nearest island.

Ewu's heart was originally filled with hatred, but now... only fear remained.

Good thing the eldest senior brother is dead and the Qinling Dao lineage is now in my hands. If I can survive this calamity... I'll leave for the southern sea and never return to this cursed place!

The body, now nothing more than two shoulders and a head, floated through the air, drifting westward.

Ewu was consumed with despair, silently praying, "Oh, Revered One, please bless me! There must be an island with mortals somewhere here that isn't guarded by Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... Whether or not I can restore the Qinling Dao lineage depends on this!"




# Chapter 570: Meeting

Li Qinghong arrived at Splitreed Island discreetly. She first went to Azure Pond Sect's marketplace, where she spent some time searching for a restaurant to gather information.

After a few detailed inquiries, she eventually learned that the Azure Pond Sect's cultivator serving as the town guard of this place was named Ning Heyuan.

This person!

Li Qinghong vaguely remembered this descendant of the Ning Family. Years ago, while she was cultivating on Mount Yuting, Ning Heyuan had passed through. He had pretended to be a rogue cultivator and challenged her to a spar. His mastery over techniques and spells was formidable, and he had a rather arrogant personality.

She continued to ask about the strange natural phenomena but found no one with knowledge of it. Every time she brought up the topic of the darkened sky in the region, the Eastern Sea cultivators only guessed that something huge had happened, yet none knew the cause of these strange phenomena.

"It seems like this information is known only to the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and their trusted allies... It'll likely take more than a year for this to spread."

Li Qinghong circled the marketplace, piecing together the information she managed to gather.

Looks like the True Monarch from the Yue Cultivating Sect was behind that... I wonder if he has any fruition attainment... The Yue Cultivating Sect is said to be the strongest out of the three sects, so this True Monarch must be quite a figure.

If it weren't for the Talisman Seed protecting me, I'd probably have forgotten about the scene I just witnessed... After all, those below Purple Mansion Realm are not even qualified to know about that! No wonder I haven't heard of any Golden Core Realm cultivators's activities in years. Even if a lower-ranked cultivator had seen them, they would probably forget the encounter.

As she continued strolling through the market, noting that the materials in the Eastern Sea were vastly different from those in the mainland, two green-clad cultivators speaking in hushed tones caught her attention.

"I heard the marketplace's owner is returning to report to the immortal sect. Who did the sect send to take his place?"

"I heard it'll be the Golden Bowstring from the southern border... He's a strong and fierce man."

Another cultivator, picking items from a nearby cabinet, whispered, "Several newcomers sent by the sect just arrived at my camp. They took that Daoist's jade ship here... Those guys truly got lucky. That Daoist even revealed a few secrets to them."

The man beside him grew curious and impatiently asked, "What secrets?"

"How should I know?"

The green-clad cultivator rolled his eyes, then leaned closer and whispered, "I've only heard that this Daoist is Daoist Master Yuan Su's right-hand man. Even the marketplace owner shows him respect..."

Li Qinghong listened to the two cultivators' conversation and immediately understood that the Daoist in question was the elder of her family. Her lips curled up into a smirk.

Second Uncle has really become so powerful... To think that even Ning Heyuan has to show him respect now...!

Ning Heyuan had once caused a scene on Mount Yuting, leaving a deep impression on her. Now that she had confirmed that her elder was in this very marketplace, she left the building and sought out the person in charge of this place.

This manager from the Azure Pond Sect had overseen the marketplace for many years and was well-versed in the ways of the world.

As soon as he saw Li Qinghong, dressed in jade armor with a shiny spear, he recognized she was no ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. He smiled warmly and approached her with a humble demeanor.

Upon hearing that she was looking for Li Xuanfeng, he spoke even more respectfully in her presence.

"The Daoist is extremely busy and usually has no time to meet most people. Perhaps if Fairy can provide me with some sort of credentials, it'll be easier for me to arrange a meeting..."

Li Qinghong smiled faintly, her voice soft as she replied, "I am Li Qinghong of the Qingdu Li Family, the Daoist's niece."

Upon hearing this, the manager's eyes lit up as he chuckled.

"Ah, my apologies for not recognizing you as the daughter of a prestigious clan... Of course, this explanation is better than any credentials! Please give me a few moments, Fairy."

Li Qinghong nodded. It was not long after the manager had left that a young man with a familiar face returned, riding the wind. He smiled warmly, laughing as he approached.

"Ah, you're here Qinghong! You could've looked for me directly instead of going through all these formalities."

He's Ning Heyuan?!

Li Qinghong blinked in surprise. Although she could recognize him, he seemed more mature now. Even the aura he radiated had also changed—where he had once been arrogant and overbearing, he now exuded warmth and calm. He was like a totally different person now.

"Qinghong greets fellow Daoist!" Li Qinghong replied politely.

A look of surprise flashed across Ning Heyuan's eyes before a smile returned to his lips.

"It's been many years, yet you haven't changed at all, fellow Daoist!" he remarked.

He glanced at her, noting that she wore jade armor and appeared to be around twenty-five or twenty-six years old. He knew her cultivation had progressed quickly, making her appear very youthful.

He showered her with a few more praises before explaining, "Brother-in-law is currently away on a mission and will likely return in a few days. Please follow me to the hall and rest in the meantime, Daoist."

Brother-in-law...

Since Ning Heyuan referred to Li Xuanfeng as his brother-in-law, he was effectively Li Qinghong's senior now. She was slightly caught off guard by this but quickly masked it with a smile and accepted the invitation.

While making their way to their destination, they reminisced about the past events on Mount Yuting.

Ning Heyuan's expression turned apologetic as he said, "I was still very young and naive at the time, so I behaved childishly and offended your esteemed family. Please forgive me, Qinghong."

"Don't worry about it, fellow Daoist... If I had not sparred with you back then, I would never have realized that there were far more powerful cultivators out there..." Li Qinghong replied.

The two conversed politely and were able to move on from their awkward encounter in the past. After a few more exchanges, Ning Heyuan's face lit up with delight, and he laughed, saying, "Brother-in-law has returned! Wait here for a moment, Qinghong. I'll go to get him here!"

Li Qinghong was prepared to stay at Splitreed Island for ten days to half a month and wait for Li Xuanfeng's return. She hadn't expected to meet him so soon. A smile appeared on her face as she nodded and replied, "Sure."

Ning Heyuan summoned the wind and swiftly departed. Shortly after, he returned with a middle-aged man.

The man had sharp eyes and eyebrows, sporting a short beard. His Black Gold Spirit Armor exuded a dim glow and he carried a golden bow across his back. The clanging sound of metal boots echoed as he strode into the hall.

When Li Qinghong saw his familiar face, which she hadn't seen in years, she stood up. Her voice was slightly choked with emotion as she greeted the man.

"Second Uncle!"
𝙛𝒓𝒆𝙚𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝓸𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝓶

Li Xuanfeng's heart stirred at his niece's emotional voice. He quickly walked up to her and said, "Qinghong, you've reached Foundation Establishment Realm! That's great...!"

Li Qinghong's eyes welled up with tears as she answered softly, "Uh-huh."

After Li Xuanfeng left home, her father, Li Xuanling, and her grandfather, Li Tongya, passed away around the same time. Her eldest uncle, Li Xuanxuan, had poor mental fortitude and was unable to step forward to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of their clan, so it naturally fell to their generation.

The eldest in her generation, Li Yuanxiu, had died young. Her second brother, Li Yuanjiao, was consumed with keeping his promise to his grandfather. He was constantly on edge, to the point that he had to carefully consider every sentence three times before responding. Likewise, Li Qinghong felt like she was walking on thin ice, never daring to let her guard down for even a moment.

Now that the gifted, decisive, and capable Second Uncle she remembered was standing in front of her, she was overwhelmed with emotion. For a moment, she was at a loss for words.

Those from the Ning Family had tactfully retreated from the hall long ago, giving them a moment of privacy.

Li Xuanfeng took her hand in his and led her to his cave dwelling. Once inside, he closed the stone door behind them. He looked at her gently and chuckled.

"Qinghong, you've grown up," he commented, his voice slightly hoarse.

Li Xuanfeng's face resembled Li Xuanling's, though his features were sharper and fiercer. Li Xuanling had always been gentle and calm, but now, as Li Xuanfeng looked at Li Qinghong with the same warmth, he reminded her so much of her father.

The tears she had been holding back finally broke free and she whispered softly, "Second Uncle... My father... he... and Grandfather... they... were killed by a Maha!"

Although Li Xuanfeng had already known about it, hearing the words again still gutted him. Resentment flared in his eyes, so intense that they seemed like they might start bleeding.

"I know... Don't worry, Hong'er... Second Uncle knows!" he replied in a deep voice.




# Chapter 571: The Full Story

Li Qinghong composed herself and carefully recounted the events of recent years. When she finished, Li Xuanfeng, who had been listening quietly by her side, said softly, "I have not been at home to lend a hand with all these matters. It must have been hard on all of you."

With that, he gently ran his hand over the black-gold tiger belt at his waist, producing a glimmering jade slip in his palm. "This contains the talismans I acquired in the Southern Border. Take it back and let your eldest uncle examine it. Yue State is well-suited to cultivating talismans; our family could make great strides in this field."

Li Qinghong accepted the slip and, after listening to Li Xuanfeng, asked with curiosity, "Yue State is suitable for cultivating talismans...? This is the first I have heard of it."

Li Xuanfeng paused briefly before replying softly, "It is not something widely known. Fortunately, we are within a secluded cave dwelling, so I can share it. It seems that the True Monarch of Azure Pond Sect has Pristine Water Fruition Attainment connected with talisman cultivation. His Dao field is located in Yue State, making the region a fertile ground for talismans."

Now that he mentioned it, Li Qinghong realized that nearly everyone in Yue State knew at least a few talisman techniques. Talismans were indeed abundant, and although true mastery was rare, there were far more talisman cultivators than those skilled in alchemy or smithing. Even rogue cultivators would have a few reliable talismans in their possession.

Nodding thoughtfully, Li Qinghong remembered the True Monarch she had glimpsed by the shore earlier, hesitating to speak. She thought to herself, It is said that the head of the Yue Cultivating Sect has unmatched divine abilities, greater than any of the three sects. I'd better keep quiet to avoid unnecessary trouble.

Glancing down at the jade slip Li Xuanfeng had given her, she noticed faint, handwritten notes on its surface. The title read Annotations on the Upper Enclosures, written by Chen Gao of Mount Douxuan, detailing various techniques of talisman arts.

Mount Douxuan—it must be an ancient sect, Li Qinghong mused as she skimmed through it. She found several methods for crafting talisman swords appended at the end, finally understanding Li Xuanfeng's intent. She nodded, saying, "This will work well. Many in our family are sword cultivators, so we could forge some talisman swords for our younger generations. They could be passed down to bolster our clan's future."

Li Xuanfeng nodded in agreement, then produced two jade bottles, one large and one small. The larger bottle was a blue-green hue, with what seemed to be a liquid flowing inside, while the smaller was the usual size for holding pills. He explained, "This is Yuwa Stone Liquid and Enduring Tranquility Spirit Pills, both to aid Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation. There are five portions of Yuwa Stone Liquid and ten Enduring Tranquility Spirit Pills. Using these will greatly enhance one's progress in cultivation."

Most of these items he had acquired in the Southern Border, though some he had saved over the years. Placing them on the table, he added in a low voice, "If there is anything else the family needs, let me know. I can spend some time at the marketplace to complete any purchases."

Li Qinghong picked up the two jade bottles from the table. The Yuwa Stone Liquid inside the first was a translucent, pale green, and the Enduring Tranquility Spirit Pills in the second were a dusky color, ten in total.

She tilted the bottle slightly, letting one pill fall into her palm. She examined it closely, tracing the lines on its surface and confirming its properties with her spiritual sense before saying, "Second Uncle... this is a blood-qi pill."

"What?" Li Xuanfeng paused.

Li Qinghong chose her words carefully, speaking in a low tone, "Uncle... this pill was refined from blood qi. This practice has become widespread, both at home and abroad, though it remains a closely guarded secret. Azure Pond Sect has been gathering blood qi over the years largely for this purpose..."

She then gave him a full explanation of the situation. Li Xuanfeng listened in silence, taking a long moment before he exhaled, saying, "I have come to know a great deal while in the Southern Border, but I was entirely unaware of this. It seems Azure Pond Sect has maintained very tight control over information within the city..."

His gaze drifted over the two jade bottles before waving dismissively. "The Yuwa Stone Liquid can be used, but have Ning Heyuan exchange the Enduring Tranquility Spirit Pill for something else."

Li Qinghong nodded and finally inquired about the Ning Family. As the matter was somewhat sensitive, she lowered her eyes, asking softly, "Can the Ning Family be trusted?"

Li Xuanfeng hesitated, then answered, "Not entirely, but they are a reliable ally. Contrary to rumors, the Ning and Chi families are not that close-knit. The Ning Family holds considerable influence within Azure Pond Sect, so if our family wants to annex Moongaze Lake, we will need their support, along with that of Daoist Master Yuan Su."

Li Xuanfeng continued, "I asked around within the sect about Yuanwu Peak's affairs. It is clear that Daoist Master Yuanwu holds Yu Muxian in high regard—even offering his daughter's hand to him. If we fail to contain the situation... we may face Yuanwu's wrath."

Li Qinghong understood that he was referring to the matter with Yu Muxian and sighed, "None of us could easily handle him, let alone Daoist Master Yuanwu's possible retaliation. My brother sees this as a serious matter. He hopes to draw Yu Muxian out and resolve it directly before he reaches the Purple Mansion Realm..."

"That will be difficult to achieve," Li Xuanfeng replied, shaking his head. "I have inquired with Hemian, and apparently, this man is wholeheartedly dedicated to the immortal cultivation. He is practically devoid of desires or attachments, seeing everything except the path to ascension as a burden. Bound by no worldly restrictions... and his cultivation method is aimed directly at reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. He will not leave the sect without cause."

"His Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation technique is an ancient one, causing unbearable pain during cultivation, with golden blades seemingly circulating through his meridians at every moment. Over the past hundred years, he is the only one known to have successfully practiced it... Rumor has it that he is calm to the point of cruelty, with a technique for refining dharma artifacts using soul blood, and he has amassed considerable personal wealth," Li Xuanfeng explained.

Li Qinghong listened intently as Li Xuanfeng recounted several stories and rumors circulating in the sect about Yu Muxian. Gradually, she formed an image of him in her mind, her expression growing worried, An emotionless, ruthless seeker of the Dao... that will be troublesome to handle.

Seeing her concern, Li Xuanfeng said in a serious tone, "You do not need to worry. I will send someone to gather more information. Stay here for a few months, and you can also take me to Yuanjiao when the time comes."

"Alright," Li Qinghong agreed naturally. She had several tasks on this trip: one was to collect thunder energy according to a schedule, and another was to explore the grotto heaven near the Qunyi Strait. She then voiced a concern: "I just hope we do not alert him prematurely."

"It is of no consequence," Li Xuanfeng replied. "The Yu Family has grievances with ours, so asking around for such information would not raise suspicion."

Hearing this, Li Qinghong added, "Please also ask Ning Heyuan. The family has discovered one or two valuable items, so it is best for an elder to inquire about them."

Their family had found an underground river within the Great Jueting, along with a reddish mineral the size of a table, covered in white veining and accompanied by a piece of golden ore.

Not knowing the value of these items, Li Qinghong worried about asking too openly, thinking it would be safer for Li Xuanfeng to handle it. After all, with a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind them, any gain could be managed without fear.

After hearing her description, Li Xuanfeng nodded. With a flash of spiritual sense, he summoned someone nearby. It was none other than Ning Dingbo, the eldest brother of the Ning Family. Li Xuanfeng gestured to him and said, "Fetch Ning Heyuan."

The hall where Ning Heyuan resided was nearby, so he soon arrived, greeting both of them with a smile. Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly and asked, "Any recent movements from Yuanwu Peak?"

Ning Heyuan was momentarily surprised, then nodded in realization and replied, "Brother-in-law, Yuanwu Peak cultivates with metal and iron properties, so with the Green Pine Temple matter... I hear Daoist Master Yuanwu is very interested."

So it all comes back to Green Pine Temple! Li Qinghong's suspicions were confirmed.

Li Xuanfeng took a moment to recall and then spoke gravely, "As I remember... Green Pine Temple was known for its arts of Swamp Metal and Fire Virtue... Most of what is left there should be cultivation techniques, correct?"

"Exactly," Ning Heyuan replied softly. "The temple holds various ancient arts, though those relating to Swamp Metal and Fire Virtue are more recent and abundant. Most of them are practicable, making them especially coveted. And these ruins are about to be opened to a select few, with all the sects making preparations."

Li Xuanfeng had heard vague mentions of this before, though he hadn't delved into it and knew little of the specifics. In a low voice, he said, "Explain the background of this matter in detail."

"Certainly," Ning Heyuan nodded and began to recount, "The story begins with Chu Yi of the Li Fire Spear."

Then he began to narrate the story, "The True Monarch of the Luoxia grotto heaven possessed vast divine abilities and profound insight into the mysteries of heaven and earth. With his Fruition Attainment, he incarnated as a mortal and journeyed northward. Although we lesser cultivators do not fully understand his purpose, we witnessed strange phenomena arising from the void, triggering the fates of countless individuals."

He spoke in a somewhat mysterious manner but, feeling he hadn't conveyed it clearly, continued more directly, "In essence, the True Monarch's reincarnated form descended into the world, and various figures aligned with his fate emerged in succession. These individuals, possessing threads of fate, rose from all corners, chosen by heaven as its favored ones."

So that's how Xu Xiao came to be... Li Qinghong had a sudden realization. Figures like Xu Xiao and Tu Longjian were originally supporting characters in the True Monarch's grand narrative. With this new understanding, she listened as Ning Heyuan continued, "But the True Monarch's reincarnated form returned to Mount Luoxia rather abruptly, leaving this group of Fated Ones still wandering across the north and south, stirring up countless disturbances."

Li Xuanfeng frowned slightly and asked, "Could the Daoist Masters identify them?"

Knowing the nature of the three sects and seven gates, Li Xuanfeng understood they would see such individuals as invaluable resources, or at the very least, useful tools. He doubted they would let them slip by.

Ning Heyuan offered a wry smile and replied quietly, "Even the Daoist Masters could not recognize them outright. All they know is that a group of such individuals exists, scattered among the common folk."

"Although the Daoist Masters could not identify them directly, those who stood out from the crowd were almost certainly people bearing a thread of fate. The sect has focused on a few of these individuals, recording them all in the sect's registry," Ning Heyuan explained.

He paused briefly and added with a slight smile, "That Xu Xiao from your clan likely belongs to this group; he happened to form a connection with Crimson Reef Island..."

Seeing that Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong weren't particularly interested in discussing Xu Xiao, Ning Heyuan tactfully skimmed over the topic, continuing in a quiet tone, "Green Pine Temple is located on the island, and entry to it depends entirely on fate. How could the Daoist Masters tolerate such uncertainty?"

"So, Daoist Master Tianyuan of the Golden Feather Sect proposed gathering this group of fated individuals and sending them all to Green Pine Island. With their intertwined fates, after a few days or weeks, one of them is bound to unlock the grotto heaven." Ning Heyuan continued, "The Green Pine Temple's grotto heaven cannot accommodate Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, so each of them is simply waiting for the right moment to enter in single file."

Only now did Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong fully grasp the situation, as the many pieces of recent events started to come together. Li Qinghong frowned and asked, "But... why not bring these fated individuals into the sects... dispatching them as sect disciples would give them loyalty, and afterward, they could officially be inducted."

Ning Heyuan looked slightly embarrassed and lowered his voice, "These people... they are meant to be divided among the Daoist Masters afterward. Making them official disciples would look bad, and if they were part of the sect, we would have to provide them with dharma artifacts. By sending them out to roam as rogue cultivators, they will discover countless grotto heavens and treasure troves on their own, and their artifacts will still be high quality... Ultimately, the sect gains it all for free."

"So that is the reason... truly... a clever scheme," Li Qinghong murmured. She thought of these so-called Fated Ones, who, despite their current glory, were unknowingly being guided toward a deadly confrontation at Green Pine Temple, where they would all end up as keys for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to unlock the ruins. She could only shake her head silently.

Ning Heyuan sighed and said quietly, "This is not the first time... it is the reward the Luoxia Immortal Sect promised Jiangnan."

Now that the details were fully laid out, the sequence of events became clear. Li Xuanfeng paused, then said gravely, "It seems that fate has its limits... it cannot contend against the divine abilities of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators... Since you mentioned that this is not the first time, has no one ever managed to escape?"

"There are always exceptions," Ning Heyuan replied with a slight smile. "Two hundred years ago, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan wanted to open the Douxuan Grotto Heaven at the Qunyi Strait. One fated individual managed to charm a fairy from an immortal sect, and after discovering the truth, they joined forces with another person of destiny. Together, they ventured deep into the grotto heaven, using their courage and fate to make a daring escape."

Ning Heyuan continued, "That individual was named Guo Shentong. He is now the Island Master of Crimson Reef Island, and his Dao companion is Fairy Tianwan of the Golden Feather Sect. As for the other who joined him, their name is lost to time, but they were known as Daoist Changxiao."

He looked intently at the two of them and added quietly, "Guo Shentong hid overseas, quietly cultivated to the Purple Mansion Realm, and later returned openly to Jiangnan to establish his own sect, which is now known as Changxiao Gate."

The revelation was significant, and both Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong were taken aback, even Li Xuanfeng raising an eyebrow in mild disbelief. Li Qinghong, surprised, asked, "So these two sects... did they intervene in the Green Pine Temple matter?"

"They are very much involved," Ning Heyuan gave a sarcastic smile and replied in a low voice, "With interests at the forefront, who would let this opportunity slip by? Should they release every Destined One, allowing them to establish their own sects and achieve the Purple Mansion Realm, ultimately squeezing their own territory? The two Daoist Masters would never permit that."

Ning Heyuan chuckled and said, "From what my uncles have told me, these two—of all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators—are the most wary of Fated Ones! I will not speak much of Daoist Master Changxiao, since he resides overseas and I do not know him well. But Daoist Master Guo alone has personally taken down two of them, both of whom he destroyed completely with his Purple Mansion Realm power, erasing those two arrogant young cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, body and soul."

He spoke as if he were sharing an amusing anecdote, though his tone held an undertone of schadenfreude and even a hint of envy he himself didn't seem to notice. He continued with a smile, "I saw it myself that year. That young cultivator, riding on his thread of fate, had overcome every obstacle and was just about to escape overseas. But Daoist Master Guo shattered the great void, descended right there, and wielded a Grade Six spell combined with his divine ability, leaving the youth not even a sliver of a chance. He annihilated the young cultivator's entire clan."

Ning Heyuan shrugged. "He forged his own divine abilities through fate and understands its power better than anyone. How could he be careless? He will never let one slip away..."




# Chapter 573: Zhong Qian

After Ning Heyuan finished speaking, the two understood each other's intentions. Li Qinghong then asked about the treasures in the cave dwelling, and Ning Heyuan, hearing her description, replied softly, "I will send someone to investigate right away."

Li Qinghong nodded. Ning Heyuan hesitated for a moment before saying, "Brother-in-law, there is news from the sect."

Li Qinghong, catching the subtle hint, respectfully excused herself and withdrew. Once she was gone, Li Xuanfeng turned his attention to Ning Heyuan, who continued, "The market at Unison Sea has been attacked again by that water ape. Do you want to seize the opportunity and head over there yourself, or should I send someone to take care of it?"

This water ape was an issue that Yuan Su had previously mentioned, and Li Xuanfeng had no intention of letting Ning Heyuan handle it. He replied, "I will enter seclusion for half a month and then depart."

Ning Heyuan had only asked out of courtesy, as he wouldn't dare interfere in the Daoist Master's matters. He nodded and agreed, then accepted the Enduring Tranquility Spirit Pills that Li Xuanfeng handed him, who said quietly, "Exchange these for some pills that also aid Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation."

He cast Ning Heyuan a sharp glance and added in a serious tone, "Make sure they are pure."

Ning Heyuan hesitated briefly, then nodded with lowered eyes. "Understood."

He composed himself, took a small mirror from his sleeve, and handed it to Li Xuanfeng, saying, "The water ape is cunning and adept at concealing itself; it is quite difficult to deal with. This is the Glimmering Inquiry Mirror, a dharma artifact left here by the Daoist Master many years ago, specifically for detecting hidden forms."

Li Xuanfeng examined the mirror. It was a clear blue, about the size of his palm, radiant and crystal-clear, a finely crafted Foundation Establishment Realm artifact that seemed quite extraordinary.

Ning Heyuan explained, "This artifact contains a trace of divine ability, allowing it to detect illusions. Almost all concealment techniques below the Purple Mansion Realm... will be revealed when exposed to this mirror."

Li Xuanfeng studied it carefully and nodded, "A fine artifact."

With a respectful bow, Ning Heyuan retreated, leaving Li Xuanfeng alone in the cave dwelling, holding a jade cup in his hand, silent.

Once the stone door had closed, Li Xuanfeng pondered to himself, "A late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm water ape... to send me such a long way to deal with it... Yuan Su must have more in mind than just this. Is it a test... or an opportunity?"

Lu Xuanfeng speculated, "The Green Pine Temple ruins will open soon... if Yuan Su plans to send someone there, besides Ning Wan, I am likely the strongest among his followers. He would never risk Ning Wan, so it is most likely me..."

Reflecting on Ning Heyuan's earlier explanation of the Green Pine Temple situation, Li Xuanfeng finally felt some clarity. Perhaps Daoist Master Yuan Su had taken him under his wing all those years ago precisely with this matter in mind...

The timing seemed about right. After a moment of contemplation, Li Xuanfeng took several healing pills from his storage pouch, selected two suitable ones to consume, and entered seclusion in preparation.

Li Qinghong spent only a few days in the market before members of the Ning Family came to see her. Ning Heyuan arrived in a splendid robe, accompanied by two guest cultivators.

Li Qinghong had been training with her spear these past days, her hair bound and dressed in light armor, giving her a capable and spirited look. After a brief conversation, Ning Heyuan pulled a few red jade stones from his sleeve, lining them up from left to right, and said quietly, "Take a look, Qinghong. See which one best matches the description."

The Ning Family's wealth was immense, so they had obtained one sample of each possible spirit item. Before leaving, Li Qinghong had made one last visit to the cave and now pointed to the one on the far left. "My second uncle showed me before. This is the one."

Ning Heyuan sighed with a hint of regret. "As I suspected. From your description, it seems to be Earth-View Bloodstone. This item is barely considered a Foundation Establishment Realm spirit item, but it was highly valued a thousand years ago—even coveted by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators..."

After a quick calculation, Ning Heyuan explained, "As for its current worth... although rare, its value is not particularly high. But since you mentioned it is the size of a table, it could perhaps be considered a treasure."

Li Qinghong pondered for a moment and then said, "Please, tell me more."

Ning Heyuan cleared his throat and explained, "Earth-View Bloodstone is very effective in restoring missing parts and replenishing blood qi; it can heal severed limbs and is also useful for cultivating certain specialized spells... In the past... there were many spells that could not even be practiced without it."

Ning Heyuan elaborated, "Nowadays, though... blood qi can be purchased in any ordinary market, and with cheap alternatives available, this spirit item has long since fallen out of regular use... At best, it is simply high-quality blood qi."

"I see," Li Qinghong replied, with a slight smile appearing on her face. She thought to herself, This item may be worthless to them, but it is quite precious for my family.

Ning Heyuan continued, "As for that palm-sized golden stone, it is likely Altar Goldstone, which is very durable and serves as a Foundation Establishment Realm material! It can be used to craft dharma shields and similar artifacts, though it is a bit small."

He chuckled. "That is fairly common, though, since the Three Gold Fruition Attainment grows in the seas, and many spirit items come with golden stone byproducts. I would imagine more than fifty percent of your clan's mines produce golden stones, do they not?"

More than just fifty percent! All three of our family's mining veins yield golden stone! Even the Xia Family's Green Origin Copper Essence vein nearby is pure golden stone...! Li Qinghong grumbled inwardly but only smiled and nodded on the surface.

She then asked Ning Heyuan about the best methods for collecting the ores, planning to head to Zongquan Island with Li Xuanfeng once he had dealt with his current affairs.

————

Li Xuanfeng's wounds healed quickly. Although they had initially seemed severe, most of the damage was superficial, caused by physical strain rather than actual harm. With his talisman qi, such injuries were minor.

"Strength to Move Mountains, the progress has been immense over these years," he mused.

As Li Xuanfeng's cultivation advanced, the power of Strength to Move Mountains had also increased significantly. Combined with the treasures he had consumed from the Southern Border, his strength now surpassed even Foundation Establishment Realm demon beasts, allowing him to unleash such terrifying power with his Golden Age Longbow.

After giving Ning Heyuan a few final instructions, he took to the skies on his golden shuttle, heading northeast and riding along a series of water veins. The sea below his feet gradually turned a brilliant blue.

"Unison Sea." Li Xuanfeng muttered absent-mindedly.

Unison Sea lay at the opposite end from Scarlet Pristine Sea and was even larger in scale. It was the domain of the dragon clan, with its waters reflecting a rich azure hue. The sea stretched for thousands of li, with few islands and exceptionally deep waters.

Normally, under the sunlight, Unison Sea was a seamless blend of sea and sky—a striking sight. However, his timing was unfortunate, as an anomaly from the Eastern Sea had cast everything into pitch-black darkness, so thick that one could barely see a hand in front of them.

Li Xuanfeng broke through the darkened sea region and finally spotted a small island. It wasn't large—about the size of a small town—and was fortified with an earthen-colored formation, standing at the ready.

"According to the instructions, this should be the market town," he murmured.

He descended slowly, and sure enough, he saw signs of devastation along the coastline, evidence of considerable destruction. Puzzled, he asked himself, "What has gotten into this water ape? Azure Pond Sect is famous across the seas; it is as if the ape is tired of living..."

Just as he stopped, an elder flew out from the market town, casting a glance at him with a hint of uncertainty. "Are you General Li...?"

It was the first time Li Xuanfeng had been addressed as 'General' outside the Southern Border. He nodded. "That is right."

With a large hand, he touched the black-gold tiger emblem on his belt, producing a white command token. The elder quickly verified it and replied eagerly, "At last, we have been awaiting your arrival, my lord!"

The two descended, and Li Xuanfeng paused briefly before the formation. The elder caught on immediately, taking a formation token glowing with an earthy yellow light from his waist. The formation appeared to be operating at full capacity.

After taking control of the formation, Li Xuanfeng deactivated it with a light command. "With me on the island, there is no need for such heavy defenses."

"Yes!" The elder led him down with a respectful bow, introducing himself, "I am Yuan Huo'e, at your service, General."

Li Xuanfeng glanced at him and asked, "The Yuan clan of Mushroom Forest Plain?"

"The very same!" Yuan Huo'e answered.

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly, recognizing the connection between their families. Wasting no time, he got straight to the point, "What is the situation with the water ape?"

Yuan Huo'e shook his head and sighed. "This creature is part of the dragon clan... it has some backing and does not fear us. Its strength is formidable, and it has beaten us so badly we do not dare step off the island... this has been dragging on for nearly half a year, disrupting our business considerably. We have already evacuated all unrelated personnel from the island."

"A member of the dragon clan?" Li Xuanfeng was slightly surprised, but recalling Yuan Su's earlier words, he immediately considered, Could it be that Yuan Su intends for me to serve as a pawn to provoke the dragons and ultimately throw me under the bus to take the blame?

Running through his thoughts quickly, Li Xuanfeng felt a surge of doubt, his initial judgment beginning to waver. He thought to himself, Something is not right... This market isn't Ning's property; it's a sect-owned business, and at most, it could be considered a Chi Family asset. Why would Yuan Su go to such lengths to help others for no gain?

Settling his mind, he asked, "Why is this water ape giving you such trouble without reason?"

Yuan Huo'e, noticing Li Xuanfeng's contemplative expression, had initially held his tongue. Now, he replied in a low voice, "We asked that very question some time ago. The water ape claimed that someone stole his precious herbs and is hiding in the market... He demanded that we deactivate the formation so he could search freely. But how could we allow that? If we opened the formation, he would do whatever he pleased."

Li Xuanfeng paused, then said quietly, "Take me down. Prepare a report detailing all the water ape's Immortal Foundation abilities, dharma artifacts, and techniques."

Yuan Huo'e led him to the most lavish hall, vacating it for his use. He handed over a small note, then, seeing Li Xuanfeng wave him off, wisely took his leave.

Li Xuanfeng read the note aloud, "Water ape... brutal by nature, with a fondness for human flesh, and his Dao foundation is Secret White Mercury... rather unusual... capable of concealing himself, lurking in the sea, with a body like polished silver and skilled in spells... no wonder he caught the attention of the dragon clan."

Yuan Su's exact words were that the water ape is the primary target of this mission. Under no circumstances should it be allowed to survive; there's no path to reconciliation. Li Xuanfeng held the note in silence, mentally reviewing Yuan Su's arrangements and deducing, The water ape likely misread the situation. This claim of stolen herbs hidden on the island is probably true... and that makes the situation clear.

He flew up from the hall, ascending above the island, and retrieved a small, blue mirror the size of his palm from within his robes, the Glimmering Inquiry Mirror.

Is this mirror meant to search for the water ape? I doubt it. Li Xuanfeng activated the mirror, closing his eyes as bright blue light streamed from its surface, sweeping across the island. This mirror was certainly not as refined as his family's mirror; he had to channel his mana for several breaths before the scene below became clear.

The island was now occupied solely by Azure Pond Sect cultivators, all wearing green robes. In the center of the island, at the spot with the densest spiritual energy, a lone figure sat cross-legged—a young man in deep meditation.

A peak Qi Cultivation Realm... If his instincts were correct, this young man was undoubtedly the one the water ape had been hunting. Noticing the youth's cultivation level, Li Xuanfeng muttered under his breath, "Peak Qi Cultivation Realm? Stole precious herbs? He must have a thread of fate."

As he pondered, clarity settled in his mind. "It seems the water ape does not understand the situation. It has foolishly entangled itself, trapping this young man on the island and delaying the affairs of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Yuan Su sent me to kill it, to clear the path for this youth."

He nodded slightly. As for the water ape... it was likely that its fate had become entangled in some way. Perhaps its backing had chosen to ignore it, or it had unknowingly offended someone, or it was caught in a factional struggle after the fall of its demon king, now destined to serve as a sacrificial pawn.

His gaze returned to the mirror in his hand, and a sense of doubt rose in his heart, There was no need to give me this mirror... I could simply eliminate the demon. Yuan Su's intention... is likely to offer me an opportunity.

With this thought, the black-gold armor on Li Xuanfeng's body began to manifest, and the golden bow appeared with a fierce glint. He descended on the wind, landing silently beside the young man.

Quite the choice—this is one of the best cultivation spots on the island. He remained silent, standing quietly with his hands clasped behind his back next to the youth.

The young man had a refined face and sharp eyes, dressed in neat attire. Though not particularly handsome, he possessed a striking presence. Li Xuanfeng observed him briefly, thinking to himself, The nature of fate is truly extraordinary... what sort of power must it be to allow someone to repeatedly avert danger?

The youth's eyelids twitched slightly before he slowly opened his eyes. His gaze was deep, but upon seeing Li Xuanfeng, he froze, his face paling in shock and disbelief, "W-what!"

He had merely been meditating, yet suddenly, a middle-aged man clad in black-gold armor, with an eagle-like gaze and imposing mid-Foundation Establishment Realm aura, had appeared before him. Terrified, the youth instinctively leaped up, though his usual composure faltered for a moment.

But almost immediately, his mind raced, and he dropped to one knee in respect, speaking in a steady voice, "Junior Zhong Qian greets Senior! I entered this blessed land by mistake... I beg for your forgiveness!"

Having quietly occupied someone else's cultivation ground, only to be caught red-handed, Zhong Qian found himself in an incredibly awkward situation. Unable to come up with any smooth words, he could only state his case plainly, subtly gripping a talisman in his sleeve and scanning his surroundings with his spiritual sense in vigilance.

Zhong Qian mused, This is troublesome... this formation could protect me... or trap me within.

Li Xuanfeng regarded him calmly and said quietly, "There is no need to be tense... and as for that talisman, you do not need to clutch it so tightly. I am not like those weak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators; even an ancient talisman would not last two strikes against my arrows."

Zhong Qian, shocked at being so easily seen through, replied respectfully, "I truly had no other options, which is why I took shelter in this blessed land... I am willing to offer a spirit item as compensation..."

Cautious one, this little guy, Observing the youth's taut stance, ready to flee at any moment, Li Xuanfeng spoke again, "You did well... That water ape crossed your path and was fated to meet this calamity."

So, he is an enemy of that demon! No wonder! Relieved, Zhong Qian also sensed a certain meaning in Li Xuanfeng's words and respectfully replied, "I am not a disciple of any prestigious sect... merely a rogue cultivator from the Eastern Sea. That water ape devours humans daily. When I accidentally entered its cave dwelling and took its precious herb, it pursued me all the way to your market. I have been unable to leave since."




# Chapter 575: Breakthrough

"This formation is the only thing that makes that demon wary... I truly have nowhere else to go," Zhong Qian said, glancing at Li Xuanfeng's expression as he subtly flattered him. He then removed a storage pouch from his waist and offered it with both hands. "This contains everything I took from the demon's cave dwelling. I am willing to give it all back to you, Senior."

Li Xuanfeng glanced at it, but since he had no way of knowing what arrangements Yuan Su might have made, he didn't open it. He waved his hand and said, "Keep it. Whatever you have obtained is yours."
𝑓𝓇𝘦ℯ𝘸𝘦𝑏𝓃𝑜𝘷ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂

Zhong Qian looked at him incredulously. Noticing the stern expression and fierce aura of Li Xuanfeng, he felt he was beginning to understand his character and respectfully replied, "As you command, Senior."

After a brief, uncomfortable pause, he lowered his voice further. "It is just... I would like to stay on this island for a while longer... If I were to leave now, I fear I would fall victim to that demon."

He quickly added, "I will not stay here for free. Whatever damage that demon has caused... I am willing to compensate fully."

"No need." Li Xuanfeng responded simply, causing Zhong Qian's face to flicker with surprise before Li Xuanfeng added, almost casually, "I will leave the island to kill it myself. You may go freely afterward."

"What?!" Zhong Qian looked at him, stunned. He took in the imposing figure clad in black-gold armor, the sharp, cold gaze, and the exaggerated longbow on his back, shaped almost like a pair of eagle wings. He murmured to himself, "Who... which killer from the devil gate is this...? How domineering..."

————

Zongquan Island.

Over the years, Zongquan Island had flourished, with new palaces and formations built, and a growing number of cultivators. Thanks to the resources and inheritances Li Yuanjiao had left behind before going into seclusion, the island had accumulated wealth and was thriving.

Atop a high mountain on the island, a stone door remained tightly closed, while springs trickled gently. At dawn, a pale blue mist would rise from the mountain, drifting down in delicate showers. This phenomenon, caused by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's seclusion, had led the island residents to name the mountain Morning Mist Mountain.

With a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator guarding it, the island's people finally felt like a true community rather than transient visitors. Each morning, as they looked up to see the soft blue mist, men, women, and children alike felt a comforting peace.

Time in the mountains passed unnoticed. After three years in seclusion, Li Yuanjiao's sea of qi had grown dense and powerful, swirling upward and coalescing into two fierce water dragons that danced and coiled within his sea of qi.

"Mid-Foundation Establishment Realm... success." He took a deep breath, feeling refreshed. Ordinarily, with his temperament, Li Yuanjiao would have sought out a blessed land for a decade or two of cultivation after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm. However, he didn't have that luxury now.

The breakthrough had not been difficult. Li Yuanjiao was, after all, a prodigy who reached the Foundation Establishment Realm at forty. The Boundless Ocean, or the Jing Dragon King, progressed swiftly in the Eastern Sea, and advancing to mid-Foundation Establishment Realm was almost natural for him.

"Mid-Foundation Establishment Realm... my mana has doubled, and now I can summon two water dragons..." Li Yuanjiao took a moment to assess his abilities, feeling reasonably satisfied. The River One Qi Technique was only a Grade Three technique. While it had given him an advantage over other rogue cultivators at the Qi Cultivation Realm, he found himself competing against immortal gate disciples at the Foundation Establishment Realm, where the technique's shortcomings became apparent.

In Jiangnan, immortal gate disciples usually cultivated Grade Four techniques, while true disciples and Purple Mansion Realm heirs practiced Grade Five or even Grade Six arts. Li Yuanjiao's Grade Three technique meant his foundation's profundity would inevitably fall short in comparison.

Unbothered, Li Yuanjiao emerged from his cave dwelling. Waiting outside the stone door was Zong Yan and his entourage. Seeing the phenomenon on the mountain dissipate, Zong Yan knew Li Yuanjiao had emerged from seclusion and stood respectfully outside.

Nearby stood a thin-faced monk with modest attire and pale lips, who offered a soft smile and said, "Congratulations, Senior!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, noting that Kongheng's aura had also improved. He returned the sentiment with a polite "Congratulations to you as well," then took to the air. Outside, the island was lively and full of vitality.

Li Yuanjiao scanned his surroundings but saw no temples or statues. Looking at Kongheng beside him, he raised his brow slightly in surprise and remarked quietly, "Quite the immortal atmosphere."

For years, he had left the island to its own devices, with Kongheng, a Master Monk, overseeing it. He had expected the island to be filled with temples upon his return, so he was somewhat taken aback. Zong Yan, perceptive to his reaction, spoke softly, "Master Monk Kongheng does not establish temples... We have even tried to persuade him... suggesting he could at least create a golden statue for people to worship, but..."

Over the years, Kongheng had gained considerable respect on the island, tending to the sick and healing injuries. Many of the island's residents wanted to erect a golden statue of him and build a temple in his honor, but he refused each offer.

Observing Li Yuanjiao and his attendant discussing the matter, Kongheng murmured, "To build a grand statue gilded in gold is to instill fear in the people with an imposing image, and to construct large temples is to deceive the masses with rituals and incense offerings. These are things we of the Liao River Temple abstain from."

Li Yuanjiao pondered this and, glancing at Kongheng, asked, "Then how does the Master Monk pass down his teachings?"

Kongheng narrowed his eyes slightly. The past few years of performing good deeds on the island seemed to have furthered his cultivation. Pressing his palms together, he replied in a soft voice, "The Dharma of the Revered One requires no transmission, no form, no scripture. Those who observe me with wisdom will receive the teachings of my Liao River Temple. We of the Liao River do not bow to others; we cultivate our own nature."

Zong Yan, stroking his beard thoughtfully as he listened, murmured, "Master Monk... it is no wonder that the Liao River Dao lineage has gradually fallen out of favor. In these times... everyone seeks a quick and effective method to progress each day. The Liao River's teachings... alas!"

Zong Yan gave a wry smile. He had a foster son who admired Kongheng and had wanted to become his disciple, so Zong Yan had approached Kongheng several times to learn more. Shaking his head, he added, "The Liao River Dao lineage is truly too difficult... I have heard that cultivators of the Seven Worldly Ways need only chant the Maha incantation once to gain progress in their cultivation, while the Liao River requires one to fully experience the myriad forms of human nature just to begin. How can it compare?"

Kongheng remained silent, only smiling with lowered eyes. Li Yuanjiao was reminded of the northern Wang Family's sword immortals; he had heard that their Dao lineage was similarly demanding. Deciding not to dwell on it, he changed the subject and asked, "Has something happened? Why is the sky so dark and overcast, stretching for thousands of li?"

As far as he could see, the skies were filled with dense, dark clouds. Zong Yan shook his head and replied, "How could we know about such matters? Zongquan Island is in a remote area, and we rarely visit the market, so we are unlikely to hear any news."

Li Yuanjiao extended his spiritual sense, and two blue water dragons spiraled beneath his feet as he carefully sensed the environment. He noticed that the flow of his Immortal Foundation energy was slightly less smooth and efficient than it had been in previous years. Previously, cultivation here in the Eastern Sea was more than five percent faster than in Jiangnan... but now it is barely half that.

Riding the wind, he looked at the lightning flickering among the clouds. Zong Yan continued, "Huiyao, visited about half a year ago, claiming it came to gather information. We told it that you were in seclusion and sent it away."

"Not long ago, another cultivator arrived, claiming to be from the mainland... and delivered a letter." He took a letter from his sleeve, which Li Yuanjiao accepted with a nod. The creature had benefited from his favor and influence and even remembered to pay its respects. Li Yuanjiao used a secret technique to unlock the letter and began to read it closely.




# Chapter 576: Two Arrows

Li Yuanjiao glanced over the letter, his expression relaxing as a slight smile appeared at the corners of his mouth. Tucking the letter into his robe, he didn't say much, but turned to Zong Yan and asked in a quiet tone, "How have the island's finances been over the past few years?"

"After covering expenses, we have a surplus of only two spirit stones... as for construction, formations, and rewards... those cost even more..." Zong Yan took out the records, looking a bit embarrassed. Located in such a remote area, Zongquan Island had little income in recent years, though the population had grown. If they counted the costs of formations and spirit paddies, the island had actually operated at a loss.

The Li Family hadn't expected any major returns from this outpost in the Eastern Sea, simply wanting a foothold there. Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and replied, "No matter."

As they were talking, the dark clouds outside the island parted, and a variety of fish and turtles swam through the open space. A creature with a fish's face and bird-like wings descended outside the formation and called out, "Humans below, open the formation at once."

"It is Huiyao," Zong Yan said with some tension.

Li Yuanjiao waved a hand and replied, "Let him in."

With that, he returned to the main hall and took his seat. Before long, Huiyao entered—a creature resembling a black carp. Huiyao had once accepted both bribes and threats from the Li Family to conceal certain offerings.

Now, Huiyao had transformed his form, appearing with a fish face, a human body, and scaled wings beneath his arms. As soon as he entered, he announced, "Li Yuanjiao! So you have finally come out of seclusion! Something big has happened!"

Having read the letter Li Qinghong sent, Li Yuanjiao had a general understanding of the situation. Sipping his tea, he asked, "Oh? Does the Dragon Son of the Zhunan Water Palace have kinship with that fallen demon king?"

Huiyao paused, realizing that this person had his own background. Rubbing his hands together, he shook his head. "Not kin, exactly. Our faction never saw eye to eye with the demon king's. You have stayed in this remote place for so long, and now you finally have a chance to return."

Li Yuanjiao wasn't particularly interested in the internal politics of the dragon clan. Frowning, he asked, "Are you saying... this situation will affect us here? You are planning to return with the Dragon Son?"

Huiyao shook his head, a trace of envy flashing across his face. "I have not even reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, where would I get that kind of good fortune? I am just accompanying a few higher-ups from the palace back. When we leave... there may well be a new master appointed here."

Li Yuanjiao gave a slight nod. Huiyao then lowered his voice and continued, "But for now, with no one governing the seas, it is a prime opportunity for us to expand... I hope you could lend a hand..."

He added in a fawning tone, "If we gain higher status within the palace... it will be easier to help our allies, will it not?"

Li Yuanjiao understood immediately, but he had no desire to be used as a pawn by this demon. Shaking his head, he sighed, "I have an assignment at the moment, so I fear I will not be able to assist."

Huiyao added, "Oh, there is still plenty of time... It is only a rumor for now. When the time comes, all you need to do is join forces with me to kill a few demons, and that will be the end of it... My Hui clan... will certainly offer generous thanks."

Li Yuanjiao glanced at him, nodding noncommittally as he thought, When the family needs talisman qi, perhaps it will be worth considering.

Pleased, Huiyao took his leave, riding the wind in high spirits. Li Yuanjiao then turned to Kongheng. "Master Monk, could I trouble you to guard the island for a few days? I need to travel outside."

He planned to visit Splitreed Island but didn't give specific details. With arrangements made, he stepped off the island and flew northward on the wind.

Converging Sea.

When Li Xuanfeng spoke, Zhong Qian's face lit up with joy, and he nodded, bowing deeply. The initial shock he felt gradually eased, replaced by a sense of confusion, "Could it be that even the Devil Gate has such righteous individuals? Not only does he not want my precious herbs, but he also does not ask for compensation! And he is going to slay that demon..."

Having grown up in the Eastern Sea, Zhong Qian was naturally wary, always prepared to humble himself or bow if needed, but rarely trusting anyone as truly honorable. He thought to himself, But this man's aura is overwhelming, and he doesn't seem to mean me any harm. I'll just have to wait and see what he does... as long as he doesn't catch me off guard... I still have a chance to escape with this ancient talisman in my hand."

While he pondered, Li Xuanfeng finally spoke, his voice calm, "Come with me. Let us go meet them."

"Yes!" Zhong Qian had no choice but to obey. As he exited the formation and looked up, he saw that the dark clouds overhead were spreading out unimpeded, and he couldn't help but exclaim in alarm, "Senior, the island's protective formation is not active. That demon can sense my aura—it is likely already on its way."

"That is exactly what I want." Li Xuanfeng replied casually, stepping down the stone stairs.

Yuan Huo'e and several others waited respectfully at the foot of the mountain. Seeing the additional figure behind Li Xuanfeng, they dared not ask questions and instead greeted him in low voices, "Greetings, Daoist."

Zhong Qian noticed the respectful expressions on the faces of the market's attendants and realized that the man beside him was not only powerful but also held a high reputation within Azure Pond, with a prestigious status. He silently wondered, Could he be from the Chi Family?

Before he could think further, Li Xuanfeng approached the attendants, shook his head, and said, "This demon is coming for him. When the fighting begins, protect him."

Yuan Huo'e didn't fully understand, but as Li Xuanfeng had come on the Daoist Master's orders, there was undoubtedly a reason. He didn't dare question it, only nodding and respectfully replying, "Understood!"

Li Xuanfeng then looked back at Zhong Qian and said quietly, "This demon must hate you deeply. Stay with these men, and do not leave the formation."

Hearing this, Zhong Qian finally believed him. There was no way Li Xuanfeng would go to such lengths just to play games with him. Cupping his fist, he said, "May I know Senior's name?"

"I am Li Xuanfeng, under Daoist Master Yuan Su." As soon as he finished speaking, a massive wave surged in the distance, moving closer with the sound of thunderous roars.

Li Xuanfeng looked toward it, standing with his hands behind his back, and remarked pointedly, "The domain of Azure Pond is vast; it is not like the Eastern Sea where one claims land by occupying islands. The structure differs greatly from that of the Eastern Sea—there are distinctions between family clans, immortal peaks, and Daoist Masters that should not be generalized."

Zhong Qian responded thoughtfully, "It sounds similar to the Dragon Palace's structure... I am enlightened, Senior."

Rain began to fall in a light drizzle. Nearby, Yuan Huo'e appeared increasingly uneasy. This water ape was a late Foundation Establishment Realm demon, and if Li Xuanfeng struggled or, worse, perished here, it would spell disaster for him.

The pressure from Yuan Su, the Ning Family, and the Li Family was no small matter. After a moment's hesitation, he finally steeled himself and sent a message through a secret technique, "Daoist... this demon is no small threat... Why not return what it seeks, make peace with both sides, and let the matter pass?"

Li Xuanfeng shook his head. He appreciated Yuan Huo'e's cautious suggestion, as the two clans had some rapport, and he replied kindly through the same secret technique, "The Daoist Master sent me to eliminate this demon."

Yuan Huo'e immediately understood, nodding as he retreated and respectfully saying, "If the Daoist needs anything, a call will bring us to the fight."

Li Xuanfeng gave a slight nod, not underestimating the demon's power but mindful that, with Yuan Su's instructions in mind, he had to handle this task alone first. He didn't dismiss Yuan Huo'e's offer of assistance outright.

After only a few breaths, a white light appeared in the distance, drawing closer. It was indeed a massive water ape, its fur white with a metallic sheen, large enough to rival a building, with eyes as big as carriage wheels glowing a deep crimson.

The water ape was a strange sight—its white fur glinted with metallic tones as it surged forward on the waves, holding a massive pillar in its hands that looked like a formidable dharma artifact. Landing at the edge of the island, it roared, "Old Yuan! You finally came to your senses... Not bad, not bad. Now, let me come down and take a look..."

The water ape's voice rolled like thunder, reverberating above the island. Zhong Qian felt a tremor of fear, yet his eyes fixed on the middle-aged man before him, who finally drew his bowstring.

Swish!

From his quiver, an arrow leaped nimbly upward like a golden phoenix, obediently fitting itself onto the string.

In that instant, everyone felt a prickling chill on their backs, as if their skin were being sliced by knives. The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators managed to withstand it, but Zhong Qian stumbled back several steps, his lips cracking and dripping red blood. His face felt as if it would bleed, and he was inwardly terrified, By the heavens... this Daoist wasn't bluffing! That bow... that arrow...

Beside him, Yuan Huo'e was equally startled, frozen in shock for several breaths before realizing he needed to shield Zhong Qian. Both self-doubt and awe swirled in his mind, How could I have been so foolish? How could someone favored by a Daoist Master be anything but formidable? With such mastery over the bowstring, there is likely no one else in the entire Yue State who could match him...

Li Xuanfeng, fully focused, was oblivious to the reactions around him. His bowstring held steady, a gleaming golden arrow aimed skyward. With a calm release, he shouted, "Strike!"

The brilliant golden light vanished in an instant. Li Xuanfeng drew his bow once more, slowly rising on the wind to adjust his angle, squinting at the distant target.

The water ape, still basking in its own arrogance, hadn't finished speaking when the island's great formation blazed into action again. Startled, the water ape stomped furiously as though being toyed with, roaring, "Yuan Huo'e! You—"

Before the ape could finish its angry tirade, pain tore through its left eye, and it shouted in shock, "How dare you! How could..."

"Argh!" The water ape barely had time to raise a defensive light over its face before the arrow exploded with a thunderous blast. The massive demon let out an earth-shaking cry, sending seawater crashing upward as clouds scattered in all directions.

Buzz.

A slender thread of golden light shot back to its origin. The water ape recoiled rapidly, clutching its left eye as blood poured down like rain from the sky, dripping steadily.

Zhong Qian wiped the silver-white beast blood from his face. The rain of blood that followed was blocked by the formation that had sprung up around them. He heard Yuan Huo'e beside him marvel, "With just one strike... that old demon has already lost an eye..."

Looking up at the golden streak soaring across the sky, Zhong Qian felt for the first time a hazy glimpse of what mastery over weaponry truly meant. Excitedly, he remarked, "Everyone says weapon mastery falls short of immortal techniques, and immortal techniques are inferior to divine abilities... But now, it seems... it is not that weaponry is lacking—it is that those wielding them fall short!"

"Hahaha!" Yuan Huo'e laughed heartily, shaking his head. "This Daoist comes from a Family of sword immortals... though he is but one of their younger generation. If you had been born a few decades earlier and witnessed the likes of Li Tongyao the Celestial Moon Sword or Li Chejing the Qingsui Sword... that would show you the peak of weapon mastery! Even..."

Yuan Huo'e paused, reminiscing. Though he had never witnessed these figures himself, he had heard enough stories to last a lifetime. Watching the battle unfold in the sky as though admiring a fine scene, he recounted the tale of the sword that once cleaved Maha.

This story was widely told in Yue State, though lesser-known in the Eastern Sea. Those around listened in wonder, utterly amazed.

————

Above the market.

Li Xuanfeng's archery excelled in suddenness, with speed and immense power, often yielding effective results in just one strike. He wasn't surprised that his first arrow had injured the careless demon. Riding the wind, he pursued.

The demon, now wounded, had only a dark, empty socket where its left eye once was, while its remaining eye glared with anger and visible shock, still shouting, "How is this possible! Who are you? How dare you! I am..."

At that point, the ape's expression changed, and its massive form began to shrink rapidly, deflating like a balloon. The water ape spat out several mercury-jade tokens, dull and pale, which spun protectively around it.

Buzz!

The second arrow streaked through like a meteor, shattering the mercury-jade token in front of him. The water ape let out a frenzied roar, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

An Immortal Foundation technique? Impressive! Li Xuanfeng cast a glance at the arrow as it obediently returned to his quiver. The mercury-jade token was a specialized spell crafted with Immortal Foundation energy; the arrow hadn't pierced the water ape directly but had instead shattered the token before returning.

It has the flavor of a substitute-death spell... Li Xuanfeng had battled countless demons in the Southern Border and was familiar with all manner of strange demon techniques. Unfazed, he drew his bow once more, releasing two arrows in quick succession.

The water ape, which had spent years refining its five mercury-jade tokens, was horrified that one had been shattered so quickly. In panic, it recited incantations to cast spells, but the golden arrowlight came at it once again, forcing it to raise the remaining tokens in defense.

Boom!

The power of this arrow was not as overwhelming as before, only bursting in a flash before him. The water ape, gritting its teeth through the impact, suddenly paused, then broke into a grin. "So he cannot use that attack too often! Almost had me fooled!"

Just as the water ape prepared to recall its defensive spells, it was stunned to find that the clear light and protective energy before it had spread and was now forcefully pushing its spells aside, trapping them in an eddying vortex like mud.

Buzz!

Terrified, blood dripped from the water ape's ears and eyes. A sharp pain tore through its abdomen as a flash of golden light streaked by, opening a fist-sized wound that oozed silvery blood.

He's trying to kill me! He really means to kill me! This isn't just intimidation or a warning! Realization finally dawned upon the water ape. From the very start, it had fallen completely out of sync, losing its usual rhythm in combat. Coming alone to this island, it had played directly into its opponent's hands, responding to strength with its own weaknesses. It had taken two arrows from an unknown powerhouse, and its strength was already halved.

The water ape excelled at stealth, underwater movement, sea control, and spell manipulation—all these skills, along with its eighteen secret arts and demon-control talismans, had been rendered useless, leaving it with significant injuries.

The water ape was well-connected and understood the significance of what it was facing. Seeing that someone from the Azure Pond Devil Gate was determined to take its life, it muttered, "Master... the Master cannot even protect himself... has given up on this old ape... no wonder... no wonder..."

Activating its Immortal Foundation to the fullest, it began to fade from view, disappearing into thin air, yet its spirit was utterly crushed. Feeling hollow and icy, it looked at the figure before it, a man clad in black-gold armor whose face was obscured. A mixture of pain and a deep, cold despair filled its heart. "Today, this old ape... shall meet its end here!"




# Chapter 578: Hundred Li of Cinnabar

The water ape's fur rippled as it came to a sudden realization, its thoughts abruptly clearing, "No wonder a mere minor cultivator was able to steal my treasure... I thought he was just some ignorant child from a family clan... But it turns out he is tied to a thread of fate. From the moment I resolved to retrieve the treasure, I had already set foot on a path to death."

The water ape's bloodline was unique. It had started its life guarding the gates of the Water Mansion and later took up responsibility for overseeing a section of the sea. Yet, it had always been nostalgic for its former master. Now, faced with this situation, it thought bitterly, The master can't even protect me, so he must be in dire straits... And I deserve this misfortune. Blinded as I was, I failed to see that the thief was someone tied to fate. Well, so be it, so be it...

It concealed its form and darted swiftly through the seawater. Li Xuanfeng, anticipating this tactic, showed no sign of haste. Calmly, he brushed his waist, and a palm-sized blue mirror flew out. It was the Glimmering Inquiry Mirror.

Blue light streamed from the mirror's surface, sweeping across the waves. This time, it moved much faster than when searching for Zhong Qian, quickly illuminating a blue tail flame in the water. Li Xuanfeng nocked another arrow and drew his bow, This demon has lost its will to fight... It has figured things out... Such a waste for someone with late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation to die here.

The water ape, just a li away, felt a chill run through its body, its gray-white fur bristling. It wasn't surprised and spat out a few more mercury-jade tokens, which began to orbit protectively around its body.

This man reeks of killing intent. His hands must have ended many demons. He's one of those weapons wielded by the Daoist Masters. I... Its ears buzzed as another streak of golden light pierced through the air and struck its body, only to vanish into the distant horizon. Intense pain spread through its torso. The water ape let out a deafening roar, enduring the agony as it fled aimlessly across the sea.

Flying several li on the wind, it sensed its Immortal Foundation trembling, and realization dawned, I'm under some kind of spell!

Though it hadn't fought Li Xuanfeng head-on for long, the ape had already lost its footing, overtaken by deep panic. It lacked even the courage to turn back and fight, leaving it paralyzed by its own fear. Realizing this, its heart sank.

Yet, just as it came to this understanding, another golden arrow streaked through the air, shattering another mercury-jade token into shards of radiant light scattered across the sky.

In the brief moment after the arrow struck, the water ape seized the opportunity to form hand seals, summoning streams of grayish-white light. Complex patterns interwove, forming triangular and pentagonal shapes inscribed with runic text.

"Treasure Talisman White Inquiry Technique!" The ape's cultivation of the Secret White Mercury was an ancient Immortal Foundation technique, rooted in the Whole Pill essence and specializing in spellcraft. Once the inquiry spell was activated, the three remaining mercury-jade tokens floated upward and pointed toward a single direction.

The water ape rode the waves, heading in that direction with determination. The wound on its abdomen squirmed and slowly closed, as the Secret White Mercury technique granted it robust physical regeneration. Though it had been struck by multiple arrows, the injuries were less severe than they appeared. Immersed in the sea, its breathing and movements continuously healed its wounds.

It traveled swiftly over the waves and, after enduring another arrow, finally located the golden-armored figure amid the stormy seas and oppressive clouds.

The figure in black-gold armor was dazzling even in the pouring rain. A helmet covered his face, concealing his features entirely.

The water ape did not waste words. Instead, it charged forward in silence, its hands rapidly expanding in size until they were as large as doors, reaching out to grab the armored figure.

Li Xuanfeng, seeing the water ape coming for him, nodded slightly. The demon, despite its many spells and balanced capabilities, lacked significant weaknesses, making it difficult to kill outright. He watched the attack approach, calm and unhurried, lightly adjusting the lower corner of his longbow.

The water ape noticed the lack of evasive action and felt a chill run down its spine. He must have something up his sleeve... But no matter what, I can't let him keep firing those arrows!

Gritting its teeth, it pressed forward, silver-white light emanating from its palms, a clear sign of Immortal Foundation techniques bolstered by spellcraft. Li Xuanfeng, completely unfazed, let his black-gold armor flare with radiant light as he punched straight into the water ape's enormous palm.

Boom!

A thunderous explosion echoed across the sky, ricocheting through the dark clouds. Li Xuanfeng met the attack head-on, retreating only half a step before pulling back and swinging his longbow forcefully toward the water ape's head.

The water ape, stunned that its blow had been matched, faltered for a moment, its thoughts in disarray, What kind of Immortal Foundation is this? Such immense strength... Or is he not even human? Could he be some sort of demon himself...

Though the ape was inexperienced in close combat, it was still a demon. It hesitated briefly, but a silvery-white shield appeared over its face. However, the heavy strike from Li Xuanfeng's bow shattered the shield with a deafening crash, sending the ape plummeting into the sea. The shimmering shield flickered briefly before disintegrating entirely.

Buzz...

Before it could recover, another streak of golden light hurtled toward it. The water ape let out a mournful cry as yet another mercury-jade token exploded into fragments, forcing it to cough up a mouthful of silvery blood.

The water ape broke through the surface of the ocean, its remaining eye narrowing as it spotted the distant golden figure of Li Xuanfeng, who appeared like a shimmering speck of gold. The great bow in his hands unfurled like massive golden wings, another brilliant streak of light already aimed and heading its way.

Despair gripped the water ape's heart. It cursed inwardly, If only the Celestial Screen of Azure Patterns hadn't been taken by that wretched brat, I wouldn't be in this pitiful state... not even a single defensive artifact left to my name.

In the brief skirmish, the water ape realized the sheer precision of this man's archery, seamlessly combined with his artifacts, techniques, and spells. It was a combination that seemed almost unbeatable. Without sufficient defensive artifacts, incredible speed to flee far beyond his range, or a secure cave dwelling to hide in, the ape knew it was doomed to a slow and inevitable death.

Gritting its teeth, the ape flew through the air, heading toward the golden figure. Two remaining mercury-jade tokens hovered protectively before it, as its hands formed intricate gestures. Around it, the seawater began to condense into orbs resembling jade beads.

"Treasure Talisman Horizon Escape Technique..." Realizing that fighting was futile and running would only prolong its suffering, the ape resorted to its escape technique. Its massive, fan-like palms came together as it cast the spell. From the distance, Li Xuanfeng noticed the ape's actions and smoothly drew his bowstring.

Hum hum hum...

A piercing hum filled the air, growing in intensity. The water ape's ears began to bleed from the sound as a streak of golden light shot toward it like a blazing comet.

"Damn it!" A brilliant explosion of golden light erupted before the ape, scattering its protective jade tokens. The radiant energy disrupted its spells, leaving its defenses entangled in the oppressive clear light. Five more streaks of golden light swiftly followed, converging upon it.

A deafening roar shook the heavens. The ocean surface erupted in a towering white geyser, silver mercury droplets intermingling with the spray. Black-blue steam hissed as it evaporated, creating a cacophony of crackling sounds.

"Arrrrghh!" The ape's remaining jade tokens shattered under the relentless assault, leaving it grievously injured. Its internal organs felt as if they had been torn apart, its limbs splintering like shattered glass before dissolving into fragments under the intense radiance.

Crash.




# Chapter 584: Silver Hook Spirit Thunder

"Second Uncle, the storm clouds have indeed appeared. Perhaps this time we will catch it!"

The woman was none other than Li Qinghong. With the Duruo Spear in hand, her aura had already reached the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Purple lightning surged and rolled beneath her feet, illuminating the mountain below with dazzling light.

In recent years, the phenomena of Falling Water Rising Storm in the Eastern Sea had grown more intense, greatly benefiting thunder cultivators. Li Qinghong had seized the opportunity to enter seclusion, successfully breaking through to the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and significantly enhancing her strength.

Several years had passed in the blink of an eye. Her elder brother, Li Yuanjiao, remained in seclusion, while Li Xuanfeng roamed the Eastern Sea. Li Qinghong had returned home briefly to investigate the lightning phenomenon and, upon hearing the news, set out to explore the Eastern Sea in search of spirit lightning.

Li Xuanfeng stared at the lightning flashing within the dark clouds, nodding slightly. "During the Falling Water Rising Storm in the Eastern Sea, many types of thunder will descend. I have heard of several varieties appearing in the marketplace. This matches well with your technique."

"Indeed," Li Qinghong agreed.

The rolling black clouds gathered over the island, and thunder roared. The island's native inhabitants raised their heads in awe and kneeled in worship. Li Qinghong glanced at them briefly, paying them no mind.

This remote area lay at the very edge of the Eastern Sea. The locals spoke in a language unintelligible to outsiders. They kneeled in groups, some trembling, clutching staffs, clearly priests or shamans with a trace of cultivation. They prostrated themselves, shivering in fear of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators' overwhelming aura.

After a brief wait, the clouds slowly coalesced into a bright, snakelike arc of white lightning. It coiled and writhed restlessly, darting through the black clouds with sporadic leaps.

"It is the Silver Hook Profound Thunder, after all," Li Qinghong said.

She had obtained much information about different types of lightning through secret methods. Though she had missed some during her seclusion, she had made five or six trips since, all in vain—until now.

"Fortunately, this island has remained isolated and unchanged for thousands of years, with its name intact." The information Li Qinghong had acquired indicated that the Silver Hook Profound Thunder struck Lulai Island within the Qunyi Sea. After searching the Qunyi Strait, she estimated that this island was the most likely candidate.

The dark clouds gathered, with silver-white lightning swirling within them. Li Qinghong felt a surge of excitement in her heart as she soared into the sky. After waiting a few moments, she extended her slender finger and made a hooking motion in the air.

Boom!

The silver-white lightning, which had been hovering restlessly within the clouds, seemed to be drawn to her gesture. It plummeted downward, crashing violently onto her fingertip and transforming into a turbulent, flickering bolt of white lightning.

Some residual lightning sparks, scattered like tiny birds returning to their nest, rained down in a cascade. They converged on her fingertip, gradually compressing into a small, silver-white bead.

Li Qinghong clasped her palms together, exhaled slowly, and after a moment, stored the bead in her Thunder Pool. With the lightning absorbed, the dark clouds dissipated, and the sky cleared. Feeling pleased, Li Qinghong nodded toward Li Xuanfeng and soared upward on the wind.

After leaving the strait, Li Xuanfeng halted mid-air and said softly, "No need to rush. Allow me to search this area briefly."

Understanding his intention, Li Qinghong nodded and joined him in scanning the surroundings. After circling the area once, Li Xuanfeng's gaze swept casually across the scene. Suddenly, the golden bow on his back glowed brightly. A hint of delight crossed his face as he sneered, "Indeed... That wretch is still hiding in the sea."

Li Xuanfeng had searched for lightning on several occasions, meticulously investigating each location in hopes of tracking down the elusive Ewu. Hearing this, Li Qinghong's spirits lifted. She watched as Li Xuanfeng drew his bow and notched an arrow, a spiral of dazzling light rising from the longbow.

"Go!" The arrow vanished from his grasp, and a deafening explosion erupted on a distant island. Li Xuanfeng slung the longbow onto his back and stepped onto a golden shuttle, descending swiftly.

————

Everstream Island.
𝚏𝕣𝐞𝗲𝐰𝕖𝐛𝐧𝕠𝕧𝚎𝚕.𝐜𝚘𝗺

This island stretched in a narrow, elongated shape, with numerous rivers crisscrossing its terrain. Houses crowded the land, and monks directed mortals to carry stones and lumber up to the tallest mountain on the island.

At the mountain's summit, over a dozen temples had been erected in various sizes. The largest stood in resplendent glory, its corridors interconnected, with clear waters from a lake reflecting blooming lotuses.

Within the main temple, the atmosphere was grim and shadowed. Hundreds of carved stone statues, each with a unique and sinister form, lined the walls. In the center stood a jade altar, beneath which a bubbling pool of blood churned violently. Atop the altar rested half a corpse. Its cracked skin continuously split open and re-knit itself, absorbing the blood below in a grotesque display.

Ewu sat cross-legged atop the high jade altar, motionless as he cultivated. Beneath him lay a blood pool spanning several zhang, its surface bubbling and churning. Streams of multicolored light rose from the pool, transforming midair into vivid illusions.

Some illusions depicted beautiful women and fine wine, while others showed ornate pavilions and majestic mansions. These phantasms swirled and danced around Ewu as if paying homage. On either side of the altar, rows of monks dressed in black robes stood in a neat formation, bowing respectfully as they waited.

Ewu let out a breath, his tone laced with irritation, "This place is truly awful... Far from Jiangnan, sparsely populated, and with so many useless Son of Diyang—what a waste..."

Years ago, in despair, he had fled across the sea and eventually found this refuge. After a period of rampant slaughter to stabilize his cultivation, he had swiftly established temples on the island.

Ewu's current strength left him incapable of prolonged combat. The so-called Son of Diyang's flesh and blood were bland and unsatisfying, so he proclaimed that Son of Diyang embodied the true Daoist physique while ordinary mortal flesh was a sinful aberration. This allowed him to rapidly take control of the island and fabricate a sect of Diyang monks to provide him with blood offerings.

Having roamed the overseas regions for some time, Ewu had become well-versed in these tactics. He quickly established a fully functioning system, using mortals as cattle for blood and flesh to sustain himself.

However, he found the island's isolation and lack of spiritual energy particularly frustrating. Most of the population were ordinary mortals, and their offerings barely kept him alive. Healing his injuries or escaping to the Western Sea seemed nearly impossible.

"I will have to take it slow, cultivating a few subordinates to scour the nearby islands for more blood offerings..." Ewu had recovered from his initial despair. As long as there were people on the island, he held hope of regaining his strength. After all, mortals were easier to maintain than spirit beasts and surprisingly effective—a business with no costs and guaranteed returns.

As he mused over his plans, a sudden chill swept over him. A bone-deep coldness made him shudder, and a faint buzzing sound reached his ears, growing louder.

Buzz... buzz...

How is this possible?! Ewu froze, his body trembling as the same terrifying hum that haunted his days and nights resurfaced. The monk's body on the jade altar jerked twice, blood streaming from his ears as he murmured, "He is here!"

The blood in the pool beneath him surged violently, climbing up the jade altar in an attempt to shield him. But it was too late. A deafening explosion rang out as the jade altar was torn apart, shattered into two pieces. Multicolored light burst forth in chaotic streams.

"Master Monk!" The black-robed monks coughed up blood in unison, collapsing to the ground. The countless statues within the temple crumbled simultaneously, falling into piles of fine stone dust. The grand hall itself groaned as though mourning its destruction before collapsing with a thunderous crash.

At that very moment, across the northern Qinling Prefecture, statues shattered in various locations. In the waters of the Converging Sea and Scarlet Pristine Sea, monks raised their faces in terror, pale with fear, "Second Senior Brother... has fallen too!"




# Chapter 585: Sarira Pearl

Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong descended from the wind. They saw smoke and dust rising from the mountaintop and panicked monks scattering in all directions. Many locals frantically dug through the rubble, their faces filled with terror as though the sky itself were falling.

The buildings on the summit of the island's mountain had collapsed. The green roof tiles amidst the ruins had pretty much revealed that a huge temple had been standing in the heart of the destruction. The ground was stained with blood, looking like an eye-catching scarlet sea.

As the two people landed on the ground, the monks appeared to realize what had happened. Their cries filled the air as they rushed to the temple hall in the center.

Li Qinghong's spiritual sense swept through the scene then said, "Second Uncle, the spiritual energy in this blood is dense—this volume... it couldn't be the blood of a cultivator. It must come from some sort of a blood pool... one that's used for sacrificial spells."

Li Xuanfeng stepped further into the ruins and noticed lotus flowers on the ground. Golden light shone down upon them, making them seem rather sacred amidst the swirling dark gray dust.

The platform in the middle had been split into two. Something white and crystalline, about the size of a grain floated in mid-air. It was surrounded by a halo of colorful light that created shifting illusions.

The lotus flowers on either side released an intoxicating fragrance, while a group of naked locals fell to their knees, crying and wailing while looking at the two cultivators with intense hatred in their eyes.

"Ewu is dead," Li Xuanfeng muttered as he scanned the area. He had already expected this. This man probably failed to heal his injuries during the past few years. After taking an arrow like that, death was inevitable.
𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝕨𝕖𝗯𝚗𝚘𝕧𝕖𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝕞

Neither Li Xuanfeng nor Li Qinghong had seen the relic suspended in the air before, but they had heard rumors about it. Li Qinghong cautiously observed it for a bit longer before saying, "This must be a Sarira Pearl...[1] It seems like this monk had more to him than we thought."

Li Xuanfeng glanced at the relic indifferently but only said, "He was lucky to have lived on for a few more years."

The Sarira Pearl continued floating in the air quietly.

"This is strange. Mutuo's spiritual power was not inferior to his, yet only Ewu had left behind a Sarira Pearl after his death... Perhaps this has something to with that Abbot Qinling or Qinling Dao lineage that they once spoke of," the middle-aged man mused with a puzzled look on his face.

Li Qinghong cast another glance at the lotus flowers on the ground. Its mystical glow was strange, and numerous birds flitted down, mesmerized by their beauty.

"This Zhao Buddhist cultivator's ability to tame mortals is truly impressive. The locals of this entire island willingly fed him with their flesh and blood, and remained utterly loyal to him. They truly revered him from the depths of their hearts," Li Qinghong remarked softly.

Her comment naturally referred to the hateful glances of the locals.

Li Xuanfeng observed the Sarira Pearl and casually replied, "Zhao Buddhist cultivators are like that. Even many cultivators can't resist him, let alone mortals."

Li Qinghong's brow furrowed slightly at her uncle's response. She parted her vermilion lips parted ever so slightly but her voice erupted like a thunderclap in spring.

"HA!"

The monks in the crowd froze before losing their consciousness, stunned by the force of the sound. Li Qinghong casually raised her hand, channeling her mana. The monks immediately formed a neat line, moving toward the temple entrance.

Since they had seen the Sarira Pearl and its illusions, it would be very easy for them to stray into the Wrathful Dao. Li Qinghong used her mana to erase their memories, sparing the Li Family from any revenge that might come from a Master Monk decades later.

Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng raised his hand carefully, taking out a jade bottle. Using his mana, he pulled the grain-sized Sarira Pearl from the air, guiding it into the bottle.

The moment it entered, the jade bottle gave off a burst of warmth. A faint red glow shimmered through its turquoise body. With a sweep of his spiritual sense, Li Xuanfeng could hear the faint echoes of yelling and muffled incantations, as though the bottle contained the voices of thousands.

"How disturbing," Li Xuanfeng muttered, then cast a few spirit pacification spells. They had little effect, so he pulled out several higher-grade talismans and affixed them to the bottle, which made him feel more at ease.

As soon as the Sarira Pearl was sealed in the bottle, dharma light and the glowing lotuses in the hall vanished. The temple, now partly collapsed, slowly dimmed too. Li Xuanfeng, using his mana, shot out a burst of mana and retrieved several dharma artifacts from the ruins.

When he first severely injured the monk, the monk had lost most of his valuable items. His most prized possession, a pair of long staves, had already been taken by Li Xuanfeng before. What remained were less valuable artifacts, mostly made of gold, jade, and pearls, radiating divine light.

These were mainly dharma artifacts that could manipulate people's hearts and leave spiritual seals, so Li Xuanfeng stored them away.

After scouring the island carefully for a few rounds with Li Qinghong, they took off together. With the evil spawn dealt with, Li Xuanfeng's mood lightened significantly and he felt so much more at least.

"Perhaps this is some kind of Buddhist legacy. Maybe we could use it to catch a few more Zhao Buddhist cultivators," he remarked.

Li Qinghong smiled and nodded, her gaze turning to the mountain filled with temples with monks moving busily between them. She frowned for a moment, then performed a series of hand seals and unleashed several bolts of purple lightning.

BOOM!

The thunder cracked, instantly shattering the temples in their path. Fire and lightning erupted, burning the sacred texts within to ash.

Li Qinghong sighed softly. "This is the most we can do. After all, this place was once run by Zhao State's Master Monk. Without any rogue cultivators willing to settle here... it might take centuries for this place to fully recover..."

"We can't afford to care so much..." Li Xuanfeng replied, shaking his head as the two of them soared through the sky. They crossed the Scarlet Pristine Sea and followed a few water veins along the way until they finally returned to Splitreed Island.

Once there, they dived into the turquoise sea and made their way to the marketplace. Ning Heyuan did not come to greet them because he was currently cultivating in seclusion. By the time the two arrived at the cave dwelling, Ning Family's eldest brother was already waiting by the stone door.

"Boss... A young cultivator came to the marketplace, he said he's looking for you."

"A young cultivator?" Li Xuanfeng turned to him, and curiously asked, "What's his cultivation level and name?"

"He's a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... but he refused to give his name, only saying that he's a junior from the Converging Sea."

It must be Zhong Qian!

It's been several years, and he's already broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm too. I wonder why he's come to find me now... Hopefully, it's about Green Pine Temple...

Li Xuanfeng thought to himself.

He took a seat in the center of the cave dwelling, then waved his hand and instructed, "Bring him here!"

Ning Dingbo nodded and quickly left, while Li Xuanfeng turned to Li Qinghong and said, "You should leave first. This person carries a strong heavenly destiny. It's better for you to not meet him to save yourself from troubles."

Li Qinghong understood Li Xuanfeng's words and bowed before withdrawing. Li Xuanfeng then took a jade slip, reading its contents in silence. Not long after, a young man dressed in a dark robe and with his hair tied back appeared at the cave dwelling's entrance.

He paused respectfully before entering and said, "Junior Zhong Qian pays respects to the Daoist."

"Come in," Li Xuanfeng replied.

He had heard of what Fated Ones were capable of and now that Zhong Qian had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, his respectful demeanor impressed Li Xuanfeng. At least he was well-mannered on the surface.

Li Xuanfeng couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

Seems like there's a big difference between the Fated Ones. Zhong Qian... is very different from those I've heard of in rumors...

His mind continued to wander.

If the True Monarch hadn't returned to the mountain so hastily, but had instead taken things one step at a time, I wonder what role Zhong Qian might have played by his side?

1. Sarira is a generic term referring to Buddhist relics, although in common usage it usually refers to pearl or crystal-like bead-shaped objects that are found among the cremated ashes of Buddhist spiritual masters. ☜




# Chapter 586: Two Spirit Treasures

"It's been only a few years since we last met, yet you've already broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm. That's pretty fast."

Zhong Qian raised his head slightly and glanced at the cold man in golden armor before replying, "Thanks to your guidance, Senior, I seized the opportunity to establish my Dao foundation in Converging Sea. Afterward, I inquired about your whereabouts and traveled all the way here."

His implication was clear—breaking through to Foundation Establishment Realm hadn't taken him the three or four years one might expect. In fact, he had likely succeeded in just one or two years, leaving him ample time to journey here at his own pace.

Li Xuanfeng, recognizing that Zhong Qian's cultivation speed was exceptional, nodded slightly and motioned for him to continue.

Zhong Qian paused for a moment, then spoke softly, "Senior's kindness has been engraved in my heart but I'm still unable to repay it yet. There's nothing of value in my hands, except for the news of a cave dwelling, which I wish to offer to you, Senior."

He must be referring to the Green Pine Temple...

Li Xuanfeng listened attentively. Knowing that Zhong Qian bore a thread of fate, Li Xuanfeng didn't believe the young man for even a second when he claimed he had no valuable treasures on him.

Since he's offering information about this cave dwelling... I can't simply abandon him and explore it alone... He's quite a shrewd one.

Had Li Xuanfeng not known about Zhong Qian bearing a thread of fate, he might have felt grateful for the offer, perhaps even sending Li Qinghong or Li Yuanjiao along with him to explore it.

Zhong Qian would have killed two birds with one stone—not just repaying a favor to Li Xuanfeng but also earning a companion to explore the cave with him.

But now, with his deeper knowledge, Li Xuanfeng merely asked, "Which cave dwelling are you talking about?"

"The Green Pine Temple Ruins... on Green Pine Island!" Zhong Qian answered, stressing the words as if fearing Li Xuanfeng wouldn't grasp the significance of the site.

"Green Pine Temple is an ancient immortal gate, and the site is now a grotto heaven. Junior has a way to enter it but will need a few people's help!"

"Green Pine Temple?" Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow, feigning surprise.

"That's a grotto heaven we're talking about! Several immortal sects have fought over it for years. As far as I know, the Sword Gate is constantly at odds with Chunyi Dao Gate and Crimson Reef Island because of it... Yet you're telling me you know a way to enter it? Are you sure it will work?" he asked.

Zhong Qian froze, seemingly realizing only then how famous the Green Pine Temple was.

"Well, I acquired the method from a devil cultivator... It's written in great detail, and I've studied it carefully for quite some time now. There should be no problem. There are also specific requirements for those setting up the formation... They need to be cultivators who have mastered Grade Four or Five cultivation techniques that are mystical enough..." he answered meekly.

"I'm just a rogue cultivator born in the Eastern Sea but I'm fortunate to know two friends from immortal gates who can join us... One of them is from the Purple Smoke Gate, while the other is from Great Xiukui Temple," he added.

After hearing the general gist of Zhong Qian's explanation, Li Xuanfeng coldly laughed to himself.

Those Daoist Masters had really arranged everything carefully. They must have really feared that the opportunity inside those ruins might be snatched away by others, going to such lengths as to set up multiple requirements... I'm guessing that all of them are just cover-ups to make it easier for those bearing a thread of fate to enter that place...

Despite his inner thoughts, Li Xuanfeng nodded and politely replied, "Well, you've come at a great time. I happen to be seeking a few cultivation techniques within grotto heavens. Thank you for your help."

"No thanks needed. We are the fortunate ones to have you joining us," Zhong Qian responded eagerly, his joy evident.

Having someone as formidable as Li Xuanfeng joining his group immediately put Zhong Qian at ease. He quickly added, "I've heard that this method is known to others as well, so there will be competition within the grotto heaven... I'll be relying on your help when the time comes, Senior."

This piece of information was likely passed on to Zhong Qian by those in the immortal sect, so he was reminding Li Xuanfeng to be fully prepared.

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly in acknowledgment, and then the young man continued, "I will come to find Senior in three months. By then, the other two from the immortal gates will also be joining us. Please use this time to prepare yourself, Senior."

After a few more polite exchanges, Zhong Qian made his exit. Li Yuanjiao entered the cave dwelling right after him, and Li Xuanfeng said, "There are still three months left. We can retrieve the dharma artifact and test it out."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, though with some hesitation, and spoke softly, "The grotto heaven is dangerous, we might not be able to return. Finding the entrance would be ideal, but I'm afraid it won't be possible for us to bring the mirror inside. If something were to happen to it inside... it could lead to trouble."

Li Xuanfeng nodded and replied, "You're right. We'll just bring it out to give it a try, but finding that entrance is our best bet."

Li Yuanjiao took to the wind and left, while Li Xuanfeng fell into a deep thoughtful silence.

Daoist Master Yuan Su... is he really giving me an opportunity? Can we really kill Yu Muxian?

He recalled Daoist Master Yuan Su's words that day. They seemed to suggest that there would be no consequences for killing Yu Muxian, but the real meaning behind those words was unclear. Was it a hint or a warning?

Li Xuanfeng tightened his grip on the golden bow. Yu Muxian had been hiding himself on the peak day after day, cultivating in seclusion, never making a move. It had become increasingly difficult for Li Xuanfeng to gauge the man's strength.

He closed his eyes slowly, sinking his thoughts into the golden bow. Within it, a sea of golden light and astral light glowed brightly—thick, sharp, and brimming with immeasurable power.

"This arrow intent... I'm afraid I'll have to use it soon," he murmured.

Li Xuanfeng had sealed an arrow intent within his golden bow. Over the decades, it had been honed and refined, day after day, until its power surpassed even his own comprehension.

When he was young, he had told Li Tongya about this not long after this dharma artifact was forged. No one else knew about it. With Li Tongya's death, this secret remained buried. Now, he was the only one who knew about it.

He exhaled softly and quietly resumed his cultivation.

————

Yuanwu Peak, Mount Azure Pond.

Yuanwu Peak towered above the clouds, shrouded by mist and blessed with surging fiery veins. It was the Azure Pond's dedicated immortal peak for weapon refinement, where cultivators could be seen coming and going all the time.

A white jade pavilion stood at its summit, shrouded in mist as well. Spiritual energy was thick in the air, and the sound of flowing spring water could be heard. A middle-aged man sat cross-legged on the jade platform, meditating in silence and radiating an ethereal aura.

His long hair cascaded freely over his shoulders and he wore a jade buckle as his pendant around his neck. As he performed hand seals with his two fingers, sounds of clashing metals could be heard. It was as though there were gold and iron within his body, colliding against each other incessantly.

As the clouds drifted away, a teenage girl dressed in white approached him, her movements graceful and serene. She kneeled and bowed respectfully to the man and gently informed, "Master, the Daoist Master is calling for you."

The man slowly opened his eyes, mana light glowing at the center of his brow.

"Qingyi, did he tell you the agenda?" he asked.

"No."

The woman, Fei Qingyi, was a member of the Fei Family, now in the late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm. Since she was a disciple of Yuanwu Peak, her attire was of high quality.

She hesitated before continuing, "I wasn't informed of the agenda but based on the recent rumors, it may be related to the Green Pine Temple."

The man was none other than Yu Muxian. Having secluded himself for many years, his cultivation had grown ever more profound. He exhaled lightly, rose gracefully to his feet, and rode the wind, making his way up the mountain.

As he passed other cultivators, they cupped their fists in respect and called out, "Greetings, Daoist!"

On Yuanwu Peak, aside from the Daoist Master Yuanwu himself, Yu Muxian was currently the highest-ranking figure. He merely nodded in acknowledgment to the greetings as he continued his ascent, passing through the mountain to the cave dwelling at its peak, where he waited silently outside the stone door.

After a few moments, the door creaked open, and Yu Muxian stepped inside. The cave was ablaze with golden light, dazzling and blinding him. Heat was surging from the ground.

Yu Muxian lowered his head in reverence and spoke softly, "Greetings, Master."

The figure before him, obscured by a shimmering golden aura, spoke in a deep, resounding voice.

"Muxian... Not bad... you are already at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm."

Daoist Yuanwu sounded extremely pleased, and after a brief pause, he softened his tone.

"I see you have refined both your spells, techniques, and cultivation. I've summoned you today to send you on a trip to the Eastern Sea."

Yu Muxian disliked these mundane matters the most. He longed only to seclude himself on the peak until he reached the Purple Mansion Realm.

However, since Daoist Master Yuanwu had a personal request, he had no grounds to refuse. With a respectful voice, he replied, "Please tell me more about it, Master."

Daoist Master Yuanwu seemed to have anticipated his thoughts. His voice echoed through the cave, vast and resonant.

"I know you are focused on your cultivation, but this matter concerns your future Dao path. There are also several items I wish to obtain, and you are the only one under my command capable of handling this task."

Yu Muxian, who believed his cultivation technique could reach all the way to the Purple Mansion Realm without an issue, wasn't entirely convinced that this mission had anything to do with his Dao path. He considered it more likely to be an excuse from his master to send him on this journey.

"Go to Green Pine Temple. Tang Shedu is already waiting for you in the Eastern Sea. He has also reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and has made friends with a fate bearer. You will follow him into the grotto heaven."

Yu Muxian nodded, responding with a question, "What is the background of this grotto heaven? What is it that you seek from there, Master?"

Daoist Master Yuanwu chuckled softly, causing the golden light in the cave to flicker slightly.

"Green Pine Grotto Heaven belongs to an ancient Dao lineage known as Green Pine Temple. Through the ebb and flow of time, Green Pine Immortal Temple has risen and fallen three times since the primordial era. Now, the grotto heaven stands as the legacy of the last Green Pine Dao lineage," he explained.

Yu Muxian's understanding began to take shape, and he responded quietly, "The Chunyi Dao?"

"Correct. The Chunyi Dao claims itself to be the descendant of the Green Pine Temple Dao lineage. If you encounter them within the grotto heaven, be extremely cautious," Yuanwu replied.

The golden light in the cave shifted as Yuanwu repeated, "I want you to retrieve three items from the grotto heaven. If the opportunities present themselves, be sure to bring them back. I will reward you accordingly."

He began, "The first item is the Sun Seeker Ring. Your senior brother obtained this ring from the sea, but he never had the chance to study it in detail before he was killed by Guo Er from Crimson Reef Island. Guo Er probably could not recognize the ring, and it disappeared on Green Pine Island, where he died. The relic is now somewhere within the grotto heaven."

Yuanwu then conjured an image in his hand—a small golden-red ring. Yu Muxian memorized its appearance as Yuanwu continued explaining, "The second item is the Unspeaking Bell, a powerful spirit treasure. It would be great if you could obtain it, but don't worry if you can't."

Another image appeared in Yuanwu's hand—an ancient, majestic-looking stone bell, with two strange talisman runes carved into it.

He allowed Yu Muxian a moment to memorize its appearance before continuing, "As for the last item... If you and the others manage to enter the Three Drums Hall within the grotto heaven and find legacy techniques, record one of them for me. It is the one that goes with the Grave Gate Thorn immortal foundation.

Upon hearing that, Yu Muxian's interest was finally piqued as he hurriedly asked, "Master, regarding the legacy techniques... do we get to pick?"

"Yes," Daoist Master Yuanwu replied, as if he had anticipated Yu Muxian's question.

"The Dao partner cultivation techniques to your Molten Metal Cave are among them. I heard that three out of five are ancient techniques. Whether the specific qi required can still be gathered or not will depend on your luck."

A sincere joy finally appeared on Yu Muxian's face. The Azure Pond Sect did not possess the Dao partner of his Molten Metal Cave, so he never would have expected he could find one within this heaven grotto.

His excitement surged as he nodded and said, "Thank you, Master!"

Master Yuanwu nodded gently, pausing for a moment before adding, "This grotto heaven is very dangerous, and you will need spirit treasures to protect yourself on this journey."

With a wave of his hand, two spirit treasures flew out from his sleeve. One was a golden ring, no thicker than a pinky finger but large enough to fit a head. It was engraved with many runes.

The second was an ordinary-looking short sword, with two lines of patterns engraved into the handle. It floated gently in the air, appearing unremarkable.

"Binding Ring and Cloudsunder," Yuanwu said.

Yu Muxian, who had been by Yuanwu's side for years, instantly recognized the treasures. Both were Purple Mansion Realm spirit treasures—extremely rare and valuable.

Daoist Master Yuanwu had crafted them only several years ago, so they had not been properly nurtured or refined by metallic essence. As a result, they were far less potent than those treasures that had been carefully nurtured for many years by other Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters. Nevertheless, they were still precious Purple Mansion Realm spirit treasures.

Yu Muxian instantly kneeled, putting on a hesitant look on his face as he said, "Master, I cannot accept such precious spirit treasures! I couldn't possibly bear the responsibility of losing them out there!"

Yuanwu laughed.

"Haha! Who would dare take them? The only ones in that grotto heaven are Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. They won't be able to defeat you. Besides, which Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in their right mind would dare take these treasures?"

"Once you're out of the grotto heaven, they will return to me through the great void. You don't have to worry about anything," he assured.

Yu Muxian nodded and replied softly, "I understand."

The light around Daoist Yuanwu's body glowed slightly brighter as he continued, "Ning Tiaoxiao has sent someone named Li Xuanfeng over. I heard that he's a member of the Li Family from Moongaze Lake. You should befriend him since you're from the same sect. There are many benefits to joining forces."

Yu Muxian nodded and quietly exited the cave dwelling. As he walked, his thoughts wandered.

Li Xuanfeng has become the son-in-law of the Ning Family huh... Well, that small grudge between our clans is nothing. I don't mind talking with him.

As for these... I'm probably the only one among the sects who get to carry two Purple Mansion Realm spirit treasures like this. I have to say, this mission is a good opportunity... I'll try to find a few more treasures and cultivation techniques to bring home...

Meanwhile, Daoist Master Yuanwu remained in his seat within the cave dwelling. The light radiating from his body continued to intensify. The cave dwelling was so silent that one could hear a pin drop.

"Green Pine Temple can bridge the gap of Dao lineages, huh? Things are really getting lively. We may even see people from the north... The True Monarchs are likely keeping an eye on this, hoping to find the real heir of the immortal temple..." he mumbled.

The items among the Green Pine Temple Ruins were attractive to the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. To the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, they merely supplemented a few Dao lineages. As for the True Monarchs, they were only interested in those who could truly receive the legacy of the grotto heaven.

"Yuansu... Yuanxiu... Zipei... Tiandong... When the winds of change swept through, a dozen or so rode the tide, but now only a few of them remain. Their lifespan is dwindling, so they must be getting anxious," he murmured.

He gazed in the direction Yu Muxian had gone, his golden pupils shifting slightly.

"Whether it's too late or not, we'll have to try..."




# Chapter 588: Five Monarchs Observing A Dice Cup

Li Yuanjiao rode the wind all the way back to Mount Qingdu. Li Xijun was currently cultivating in seclusion, and it was his daughter, Li Yuexiang, who came to greet him.

Li Yuexiang had grown a lot taller now, dressed in white. She wore a simple hairpin adorned with a tiny white jade osmanthus flower no bigger than a fingernail. Just like Xiao Guiluan, she also had a pair of phoenix eyes that embodied the soft beauty of Jiangnan's water villages.

She cupped her fist and said, "Yuexiang greets Father."

Li Yuanjiao closed his eyes for a moment before saying softly, "Xiang'er is a Qi Cultivator now."

Li Yuexiang had already reached the Qi Cultivation Realm, practicing the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique. Li Yuanjiao barely registered that the little girl in his memory had already turned into a young lady. Looking at her now, he realized that he had missed her entire childhood.

Li Yuexiang smiled and nodded to his words.

Li Yuanjiao fell silent for a moment before announcing softly, "I've returned only to see you and your mother. I plan to enter the Green Pine Temple Ruins... and I fear I might not come out from it alive."

Li Yuexiang paused. She looked at the silent, middle-aged man in black and replied, "Father you've been working hard."

Li Yuanjiao continued walking with her, with hands behind him. He hesitated for a moment before awkwardly asking, "Do you... have any preferred dharma artifact?"

"No," Li Yuexiang answered casually, and her father awkwardly searched for another topic to talk about. It wasn't too long before they found Xiao Guiluan.

Xiao Guiluan had remained at the ninth layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm for some time. Though Li Yuanjiao oversaw the Li Family, he had been unable to spare an Essence Gathering Pill for her. Xiao Guiluan understood that her husband preferred she not involve herself too deeply in the family's affairs, so she quietly continued her cultivation in the mountains.

Over the years, Xiao Guiluan studied the art of talisman drawing to fill her time. When she learned of her husband's unexpected return, she was very happy. After a few intimate exchanges with him, Li Yuanjiao brought up the topic of Green Pine Temple Ruins.

Xiao Guiluan listened quietly, waiting for her husband to finish speaking before asking, "Must you go?"

Li Yuanjiao fell silent for a long while before replying, "If we wait until that man breaks through to the Purple Mansion Realm, our family will meet a tragic end. I must kill him. I fear that Second Uncle's strength alone will only be enough to defeat but not kill him. I must pick up my sword and go there to cut him down with my sword intent."

Li Yuanjiao used the feud between the two clans as an excuse but in reality, Yu Muxian's jade buckle was the more pressing reason.

Xiao Guiluan's expression grew solemn as she gave Li Yuexiang a nod, gesturing for her to leave, then said softly, "I understand you have your reasons for going. I can only hope you will take care of yourself."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, then took out a small letter from his sleeve and quietly said, "If I don't return, send this to Xizhi in Azure Pond Sect."

Xiao Guiluan accepted the letter silently. Li Yuanjiao studied her for a moment, his gaze lingering on her phoenix eyes. Finally, he smiled and assured, "Don't worry too much. Perhaps Yu Muxian isn't as skilled in battle as you think."

Three months passed in the blink of an eye, and there was no time to waste. Li Yuanjiao took the immortal mirror from its platform and rode the wind. Li Yuexiang was waiting at the top of the mountain.

Li Yuanjiao stopped, watching her for a moment. She hesitated for a moment before saying, "Take care, Father."

Li Yuanjiao gave her a slight nod and a brief smile before leaving on the wind.

Instead of heading north, he flew east toward Mount Xianyou first.

The Xiao Family's Mount Xianyou was a well-known mountain, though Li Yuanjiao rarely visited. His arrival was swiftly announced, and a man with a dignified, commanding presence, dressed in a brocade robe, came out to greet him.

"Ah, so my brother-in-law has come."

It was Xiao Guitu who had come out to receive him. It had been decades since Li Yuanjiao last saw him. Noticing that the man's aura was now fuller, indicating that he had reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Yuanjiao replied, "Congratulations, Family Head. Your cultivation has progressed very swiftly."

Xiao Guitu waved his hand modestly and responded, "There's still a long way ahead of me. It's too early to say that."

Li Yuanjiao offered a few more polite words but didn't linger on the subject. He then asked, "Regarding the Green Pine Temple, does your esteemed clan have any involvement in it?"

Xiao Guitu paused for a moment before answering, "Our ancestor, Xiao Yongling the Man on Mount Feather, has already made his way there and will be entering the ruins. As for collecting spiritual qi outside the grotto heaven... my family lacks the manpower, so we're not involved in that."

As the Green Pine Temple drew closer to this world, it inevitably gave rise to many spiritual qi and spirit treasures. Many had already made their way there to begin gathering whatever they could, especially the former.
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝐰𝚎𝕓𝐧𝚘𝘃𝗲𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝕞

Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and told Xiao Guitu about Li Xuanfeng's plan of entering the grotto heaven. Xiao Guitu nodded thoughtfully, then said, "The two elders share a strong friendship, I am sure they know their limits in everything they do."

Li Yuanjiao briefly discussed the matter with Xiao Guitu, exchanged a few pleasantries, and then took his leave. Xiao Guitu saw him off, then mumbled to himself as he turned back, "I guess Yu Muxian will be killed... Although the relationship between the older generations is good, that's not a good reason for our family to take the risk."

Li Yuanjiao exited Mount Xianyou and headed north.

He had never expected the Xiao Family to intervene in this matter—after all, it involved offending at least one Daoist Master. If things went awry, they would offend another future Daoist Master. Of course the Xiao Family would refrain from getting involved. He had only traveled there to inform them of this matter as a show of respect.

"We can only... rely on ourselves for this matter," he mumbled.

Li Yuanjiao his journey, flying swiftly toward Lake Xian, then following the water veins eastward. Soon, he passed over the Shallow Sea and descended into it, heading to the marketplace of Splitreed Island.

The marketplace had become increasingly crowded with cultivators. Many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, who usually remained hidden from view, were also here to gather information.

The contest over the Green Pine Temple Ruins had been ongoing for years, and rumors were now spreading that the Green Pine Grotto Heaven was about to manifest in this world. Like sharks sensing blood, many cultivators in the region became more active.

Whether or not they could enter the grotto heaven, the manifestation of a grotto heaven was still a huge incident. All sorts of unusual phenomena were already happening on the Green Pine island.

Many special types of spiritual qi that had long been extinct had reappeared, along with spirit water and spirit fire. It was like the time when the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven descended into the world.

Green Pine Grotto Heaven was only beginning to manifest, so it wasn't like Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven's full descent, where countless items had fallen to the world.

However, Green Pine Grotto Heaven was far grander and older than the latter. The spirit items that would be born from it were enough to spark fierce competition among cultivators eager to claim them.

As soon as Li Yuanjiao arrived, he had a discussion with Li Qinghong for a while. Seeing that there were still a few days left before he would have to leave again, he decided to browse through the marketplace. It was there that he unexpectedly ran into an old acquaintance.

It was an unassuming middle-aged man, dressed in simple clothing. Behind him stood a tall, powerfully built man with piercing eyes. He spotted Li Yuanjiao right away and quickly approached.

"Han Shizhen of the Han Family from Dongliu greets fellow Daoist!"

It was the young master of the Han Family on Dongliu Island. He had visited the Li Family before to purchase Wanglin Blossom. Li Yuanjiao had made several trips to Dongliu Island to investigate if this man had marked up the price of the blossoms to benefit his own interests.




# Chapter 591: Starry Night Over The Cloudy Sea

Tu Longjian, dressed in black, lowered the long hammer resting on his shoulder and stored it in his storage pouch before stepping forward. He glanced at Li Yuanjiao and thought to himself, Back then, I only saw the light of this artifact but never met this benefactor in person. It's possible he was already killed and the artifact was taken. I'll need to test him carefully to avoid any mistakes.

He stepped forward, cupped his fist slightly, and greeted softly, "Greetings, fellow Daoist!"

The figure shrouded in the Profound Patterned Spirit Mist remained highly alert, immediately putting away the jade bottle and turning toward Tu Longjian. A slightly hoarse voice emerged from within the mist, "I have gathered enough of this fire baleful qi. The rest is yours."

He seemed unwilling to cause trouble and gave a short response before turning to leave. But Tu Longjian couldn't let him go so easily. He stepped forward again, smiling as he said, "Fellow Daoist, do you recall the heir of Slaughter Jun? We met briefly on the borders of Profound Peak back then."

Tu Longjian kept his words vague, fearing the man might have killed his benefactor and stolen the artifact. The figure in the mist paused briefly and asked doubtfully, "You... are Tu Longjian? You have already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

Hearing this, Tu Longjian did not relax his guard. Many people knew his name. He cautiously replied, "Senior, do you recall the spell I carried with me back then? What kind of spell was it?"

Li Yuanjiao hesitated for a moment. He of course remembered the Yang Nourishing Technique, a spell his family had used to convert Long Marching Fire Essence into a usable Grade Four cultivation method. Using a slightly uncertain tone, he replied, "Yang Nourishing Technique?"

"Ha!" At this confirmation, Tu Longjian finally felt sure he was speaking to the right person. Genuine joy lit up his face as he exclaimed, "Senior, I have been searching for you everywhere!"

The Profound Patterned Spirit Mist around Li Yuanjiao's figure dissipated slightly, revealing his appearance. He studied Tu Longjian carefully for a moment before saying softly, "Your accomplishments now are a continuation of Slaughter Jun Dao lineage. That is a good thing."

Rather than emphasizing the favor he had done, Li Yuanjiao chose to highlight his connection to the Slaughter Jun Dao lineage. After all, the reason he had spared Tu Longjian back then was due to his ties to the Dao lineage. Hearing this, Tu Longjian's eyes reddened slightly. He nodded and said, "Indeed. If my master and elders could see the man I have become today, they would surely smile. That would be enough for me."

After a brief pause, Tu Longjian retrieved a reddish token from his robes. Black on the top and red on the bottom, its flowing lines caused Li Yuanjiao to narrow his eyes slightly. Tu Longjian gently held the token aloft, performing a hand seal as he activated it, and asked, "May I ask senior's name?"

The fire baleful qi immediately surged toward the token, pouring into it in a steady stream. Within a few breaths, the baleful qi was completely absorbed. Tu Longjian put the token away, and only then did Li Yuanjiao fully disperse the mist concealing his face.

"Li Yuanjiao," he answered.

Tu Longjian looked him over, finding that Li Yuanjiao's demeanor matched his expectations. Smiling, he asked, "Senior, are you here at Green Pine Temple hoping to enter the grotto heaven?"

Li Yuanjiao replied softly, "Just trying my luck. The grotto heaven is not something one can enter at will... If I cannot gain entry, collecting some spiritual qi would suffice."

Tu Longjian nodded and said in a quiet tone, "If senior is interested, why not join forces with me for a few days on the island? It might serve as mutual support."

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly and asked, "Do you have any companions? If we are to join forces, please introduce them."

Tu Longjian chuckled and said lightly, "This junior has traveled alone and has no companions."

Li Yuanjiao was somewhat surprised. After a brief moment of thought, he nodded and said, "Very well. I too am alone. Allow me to attend to something, and I will return shortly."

"Please go ahead, senior," Tu Longjian said with a humble fist cup. He watched as Li Yuanjiao flew off on the wind, then sat cross-legged, deep in thought, His cultivation method is rather ordinary, with nothing particularly remarkable. At most, he seems like a clan cultivator... Back then, I was just a lowly Qi Cultivator, my talents yet undiscovered. It shouldn't have been possible for someone to have schemed against me in advance.

Tu Longjian stroked his chin as he thought to himself, This is a matter of life and death. Having a helper is always good... Even if I can't escape in the end, leaving treasures or other things to repay a favor is better than letting the Daoist Masters have them.

As Li Yuanjiao rode the wind away, he too was mulling things over with some surprise.

Tu Longjian had not suggested bringing him into the grotto heaven, and Li Yuanjiao wasn't in a rush. Staying close to Tu Longjian was enough, as the young cultivator was already a focal point of many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' attention. It was only a matter of time before he entered the grotto heaven.

To Tu Longjian, Li Yuanjiao likely appeared to be just a clan cultivator. Perhaps Tu Longjian was planning to wait for the grotto heaven to manifest more clearly before pretending to enter it by chance.

But given the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' careful arrangements, Tu Longjian likely had a method to bring a few disciples into the grotto heaven. Yet, he appeared to have no companions, which was curious.

Pondering this, Li Yuanjiao soon found Li Qinghong.

The grotto heaven was incredibly dangerous, so it was impossible for Li Yuanjiao to bring the Immortal Mirror inside. Without saying much, he handed the artifact to her and said softly, "There may be Purple Mansion Realm cultivators guarding the perimeter of the island. Be vigilant."

Li Qinghong understood Li Yuanjiao's concern: using the Immortal Mirror to detect spirit treasures could appear as though she possessed foreknowledge, potentially arousing suspicion. She nodded and replied softly, "I understand."

Li Yuanjiao took off, soaring into the sky and gradually disappearing. Li Qinghong remained at her post amidst the waves for a while before returning to her temporary dwelling on the sea.

Li Yuanjiao's errand took only a few hours, and he soon returned to Green Pine Island. He found Tu Longjian holding a golden hammer in one hand and a small storage pouch in the other, examining it carefully.

A headless corpse kneeled before Tu Longjian, its body covered in green spots emitting a strong pine-like fragrance. In the brief moment since Li Yuanjiao landed, the spots had begun sprouting, growing into small branches and leaves.

As Li Yuanjiao descended, Tu Longjian cupped his fist slightly and said, "An unwise fool crossed my path earlier. I have already dealt with him."

He chuckled and added, "The grotto heaven is about to manifest, and the activity in the great void will surely be spectacular. Even if a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator dies, it will not cause much of a stir, which saves us from drawing unnecessary attention."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, glancing at the corpse. Whatever anomaly the body had caused had been suppressed, leaving no clue of the deceased's cultivation level. Tu Longjian approached with a cheerful expression and said, "Senior, why not walk with me around the island?"

————

At the edge of the island, Li Xuanfeng stood silently in midair, holding his bow without speaking. On the ground below, Zhong Qian and Kan Ziyu were carefully arranging a formation. Nearby, Lin Chensheng hovered in the air, observing quietly.

Lacking knowledge of formations, both Li Xuanfeng and Lin Chensheng merely waited. Zhong Qian and Kan Ziyu remained deeply focused on their work. Suddenly, Lin Chensheng's low voice echoed in Li Xuanfeng's ears, "Daoist Xuanfeng, are you a branch of Daoist Master Yuan Su's lineage?"

Li Xuanfeng remained unmoved, responding softly with a voice carried by mana, "That is correct. May I ask where you are from?"

Lin Chensheng's expression remained calm as he replied, "I am the nephew of Daoist Master Houfu."

Daoist Master Houfu was a rising figure of the Great Xiukui Temple, a young and powerful cultivator with the potential to lead the temple in the future. Lin Chensheng's background was not insignificant. Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly as Lin Chensheng continued, "When we enter the grotto heaven, Daoist Ziyu and I will propose that we act separately. I suggest you do the same—it is better to proceed alone."

"Hm?" Li Xuanfeng frowned slightly.

Lin Chensheng elaborated through secret transmission, "In places like this, traveling with others is not ideal. You are more likely to become a stepping stone for others than to gain anything worthwhile."

Li Xuanfeng fell silent for a moment before replying, "Thank you for the warning."

Lin Chensheng smiled faintly, "No need to be overly polite. When we are in the grotto heaven, we can look out for each other if needed."

Li Xuanfeng nodded. By this time, the two below had finished their formation and ascended on the wind. Kan Ziyu said, "The great formation is ready. Everything is in place; we just need the grotto heaven to descend."

The four exchanged a few words before entering a meditative state. The light between heaven and earth shifted several times as the day turned to evening. Finally, Lin Chensheng spoke abruptly, "It is coming."

Li Xuanfeng exhaled and raised his gaze, spotting a brilliant light appearing above Green Pine Island.

The light took the shape of a shallow arc, purple at the top and white at the bottom, slowly emerging from the great void. Five colors shimmered across the arc, which descended gradually toward the earth.

As the arc drew closer to the ground, more of its form became visible. Vast mountain ranges rose and fell within the clouds, faintly visible amidst the mist. Streams of light flickered and roamed across the terrain, casting an ethereal glow.

Boom!

A deafening thunderclap echoed through the sky as ochre-colored gold and stone fragments rained down. Out of nowhere, waterfalls cascaded from the air, transforming from purple-gold hues into blue-gold streams before landing below and swirling into violent deep-blue winds. These winds grew dense, turning fiery red as flames erupted, coalescing into crystalline formations.

The elements of earth, water, wind, and fire cycled in succession, producing countless streaks of light that shot off in all directions. The sea churned violently, its waters responding in kind by surging upward with torrents of multicolored spirit water.

A swarm of rogue cultivators leaped into the air, engaging in chaotic battles overhead. Li Xuanfeng and his group ignored the fray, shielding Zhong Qian as their formation activated with a thunderous roar.

One by one, the formation's glowing lines lit up, and with a muffled blast, all color vanished from Li Xuanfeng's sight. Everything became stark black and white. His thoughts grew sluggish as the objects before him stretched endlessly, distorting until they resolved into streams of black-and-white lines converging at a distant point.

An electrifying jolt shot through his mind, followed by a sudden shift in vision. Darkness gave way to dazzling silver and white.

The ground beneath him disappeared, and Li Xuanfeng suddenly found himself standing above an endless sea of clouds. Overhead, a boundless starry sky stretched into the distance, its brilliance unmatched. Beyond the clouds, distant mountain ranges rose and fell, shrouded in an eerie silence.

The Green Pine Grotto Heaven? Li Xuanfeng immediately surveyed his surroundings and noticed Zhong Qian and the others standing nearby, their faces filled with awe.

Lin Chensheng whispered, "This should be Green Pine Temple."

He raised his head to gaze at the stars and said in amazement, "As expected, the stars within this grotto heaven do not move."

At this, the group instinctively lifted their heads to observe. Sure enough, every star appeared fixed in the heavens, glowing like immovable points of light. Unlike the stars of the outside world, which shifted, intersected, and realigned, these stars remained static.

Li Xuanfeng's gaze fell upon a cluster of seven bright stars resembling a ladle, and he said softly, "There are no sun or moon in this grotto heaven... only stars?"

"Correct," Lin Chensheng replied, his eyes scanning the sea of clouds as if searching for something.

He exchanged a glance with Kan Ziyu before the two cupped their fist respectfully and said, "Now that we have entered the grotto heaven, let us part ways and seek our fortunes independently."

Zhong Qian was slightly surprised by their words, as though he had more to say. However, seeing Li Xuanfeng also bid farewell with a cupped fist, Zhong Qian could only nod and say, "Take care, everyone!"

Parting ways with the others, Li Xuanfeng carried his golden bow and flew north for a while. After pausing in mid-air for several breaths, he glanced down at the endless sea of clouds below him.

"I wonder what lies beneath," he murmured.

Forming a hand seal, a golden protective shield flared around his body. He cautiously descended into the clouds. A pale, moonlit mist surrounded him, and after a single breath, the dense layers of clouds began to thin and disperse.

"It seems one enters this place at a high altitude," he observed. Breaking through the bottom of the cloud layer, Li Xuanfeng finally saw what lay ahead and froze in astonishment.

Beneath him stretched another vast sea of clouds, endless and boundless. Above him remained the same endless starry sky, brilliant and infinite. In the distance, the mountain ranges rose and fell, winding endlessly—the same scene he had just witnessed.

Li Xuanfeng looked up and noticed that the ladle-shaped cluster of seven bright stars had now flipped upside down. If there was any difference between this view and the one above the clouds, this was the only distinction.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

For a moment, he stood bewildered before realization struck, "There is no land here at all. Beneath the clouds is another starry night."

He carefully summoned the wind, breaking through the sea of clouds as he moved forward, a growing question forming in his mind, If that's the case, then if there's a treasure above, might there also be one below?

Suppressing the thought, he focused on the surrounding emptiness of the sea of clouds. This wasn't a place to waste time wandering aimlessly. Fixing his eyes on a distant mountain range, he directed his windborne path toward it.

Boom!

After flying for nearly an hour, a thunderous explosion echoed from the distant horizon. Li Xuanfeng glanced toward the source of the sound and saw several figures locked in a fierce battle over the sea of clouds.

The combatants wore a mix of garments, some bearing traces of mainland sects. At the center of the group was a cultivator holding two large bronze bowls high above his head. Within the bowls, purple lightning swirled, releasing strikes of profound lightning that struck his opponents.

His attackers surrounded him, each wielding different weapons—long swords, hand seals, and spells. Their robes and garb revealed their diverse origins, yet they had formed a temporary alliance to besiege him. Among them, one man in a golden robe wielded twin blades, his expression fierce as he shouted, "Miao Ye! Hand over the Hidden Cloud Orb at once! Stop wasting everyone's time!"

The central figure, Miao Ye, showed no fear. Chuckling coldly, he continued to wield the bronze bowls, intensifying the surge of purple light. Meanwhile, his opponents, though cooperating, hesitated to reveal their own trump cards, resulting in a stalemate.

The dual-blade wielder's expression grew increasingly grim. He clearly didn't want to waste more time here, but he couldn't bring himself to abandon the treasure in the other's hands. His face shifted multiple times as he wavered between choices.

Li Xuanfeng had no intention of provoking trouble and didn't want to attract suspicion by passing directly through the area. He planned to dive into the surrounding mist and bypass the skirmish from another direction.

However, the lightning-wielding cultivator with the bronze bowls laughed and taunted, "Situ Chen, you better leave now. If you wait too long, everything will already have been divided up!"

Li Xuanfeng froze in midair, narrowing his eyes as he scrutinized the dual-blade wielder, Situ Chen. A thoughtful expression crossed his face as his hand slowly reached behind him to unfasten the longbow on his back.




# Chapter 593: The Small Courtyard

Situ Chen's features were striking, with a high-bridged nose that bore a resemblance to Situ Mo. Black and red fire enveloped him, swirling with ominous qi.

His flames were unusual, taking on the shapes of various birds, their sheer power enough to shatter the bolts of lightning hurled at him. His dual blades moved with ferocity, slicing through the air with the force of a tiger's charge.

The surrounding cultivators hesitated at the sight. Neither Miao Ye nor Situ Chen was someone to trifle with. A confrontation between the two could only mean trouble, leaving little for others to gain. Gradually, the others dispersed, leaving the two locked in a standoff mid-air.

Situ Chen grew even more resolute. The Hidden Cloud Orb was critical to forging his artifact. He said coldly, "I have no desire to waste time with you here. Why not name a price? Let us negotiate—"

"Bah!" Miao Ye sneered, spitting as he interrupted, "Mother fucker! Do you think I have forgotten how that Flameshadow Crow you wield came to be? It was Situ Tang who stole my family's fortune on Mount Douxuan and seized the technique! Now you dare feign civility and speak of negotiation? I spit on you!"

Situ Chen's smile darkened as his expression grew cold. He retorted, "How dare you utter the Daoist Master's name directly! If your family lost its fortune, you have only yourselves to blame. Your accusations are baseless."

Miao Ye barked out a bitter laugh and said mockingly, "The old bastard is dead! I will curse him in front of your face—what can you do about it?"

The two exchanged sharp words before erupting into battle. Li Xuanfeng, clad in his black-gold spirit armor, dimmed its radiance and concealed himself within the clouds, silently observing the scene.

"So, it is you... The Flameshadow Crow... It really is the Flameshadow Crow." Memories from Li Xuanfeng's youth in Lijing Town resurfaced. A severe drought had struck Lichuankou Village, emptying nearly every household. The Xu Family had been devoured, leaving only old Xu alive, while Chen Erniu had fled to become a tenant farmer under the Li Family.

Old Xu had died in front of Li Xuanfeng all those years ago, revealing a dark secret: Golden Tang Gate had orchestrated a demonic ritual to prepare Flameshadow Crow Qi for the young master's cultivation, using monsters to kill humans and harvest fire energy.

"Flameshadow Crow Qi," Li Xuanfeng murmured.

These events had taken place far in the past. Harvesting spiritual qi from heaven and earth often required years or even decades. Golden Tang Gate must have collected fire qi from multiple locations, their activities unnoticed amid the passage of time.

Mortals, with their short lifespans, had little time to dwell on grief. Yet old Xu, clutching six-year-old Li Xuanfeng's trousers in his dying moments, had left a memory that stayed with him for over seventy years.

Li Xuanfeng adjusted his longbow, and a quiver of arrows trembled. One leaped from the quiver to rest on the bowstring. Streams of golden light rapidly gathered and coalesced into the arrowhead.

Standing silently, bow drawn, Li Xuanfeng held his position without firing. Instead, he slowly retreated into the clouds, keeping his presence hidden as he carefully memorized Situ Chen's features.

In this grotto heaven, they won't fight to the death. It's a petty skirmish over scraps, a case of losing the greater prize for smaller gains. This man, as the young master of Golden Tang Gate, is no easy target. If I act, it must be decisive—he cannot be allowed to escape or prepare defenses.

Below him, the black-red flames around Situ Chen surged higher with every swing of his twin blades. His strikes hurled arcs of fire at Miao Ye, who stood firm with lightning crackling between his bronze bowls.

The two exchanged spells and techniques, testing each other through dozens of moves. Gradually, the battle intensified, sending shockwaves of flame and lightning scattering across the sky.

As the clash dragged on, both began to show hesitation. In the grotto heaven, prolonging their fight risked leaving them vulnerable to opportunists. Reluctantly, they reached a tacit understanding and stopped.

Situ Chen sheathed his blades and snorted coldly before flying off toward a distant mountain range. Miao Ye spat in his direction before turning and heading the opposite way.

Once the two separated, Li Xuanfeng concealed his spirit armor and silently followed after Situ Chen, heading north through the clouds.

As he moved through the mist, streaks of light grew increasingly common around him. Bright trails cut through the gray haze unabashedly, while dimmer and more subtle glimmers revealed the presence of at least a dozen other cultivators.

The distribution within this cloud sea is unclear, but by rough estimation, there must be forty or fifty people here. Of them, at least ten carry threads of fate. If a fight breaks out, it will be quite the spectacle. After glancing around briefly, Li Xuanfeng pressed on.

Before long, the mountain range began to emerge. Its deep brown base rose sharply from the clouds, towering toward the heavens. The slopes were covered in various types of spirit pines, their luminous needles reflecting a faint glow.
𝗳𝐫𝚎𝗲𝚠𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝘃𝚎𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺

A cyan wind whistled through the forest, scattering and drawing the clouds in rhythmic waves, creating the illusion of an island floating within a sea.

Amid the vast pine forest, emerald-green stone steps wound upward like the body of a great azure serpent dragon. The steps extended from the mountain's foot to its summit, flanked by pavilions and terraces exuding an ethereal, celestial aura.

As Li Xuanfeng approached the mountain, the wind surrounding him abruptly dispersed, forcing him to falter mid-air. Stumbling slightly, he landed at the mountain's foot.

Taking a moment to identify the phenomenon, he realized the wind was Heavy Abyssal Gale, a rare spiritual force capable of scattering flight techniques, disrupting spirit boats, stirring sandstorms, and interfering with magical artifacts. It was a highly coveted spirit material, even among Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Such a wind was exceptionally scarce in the present world, found only in trace amounts on the Great Western Plains. Even a wisp of it could be used to forge artifacts capable of disarming opponents. Released into the wild, it would cause rogue cultivators to fight fiercely over it.

Yet here, the gale seemed endless, circling the mountain endlessly. None of the cultivators knocked from the skies paused to gather it; instead, they hurried toward the summit.

Li Xuanfeng descended to the ground and noticed a black-robed man landing ahead of him. The man had coarse, shallow eyebrows and gaunt cheeks. Cupping his fist, he said, "I saw Daoist Xuanfeng from the skies earlier. The mountain is dangerous—why not travel together?"

The man was Lin Chensheng of the Great Xiukui Temple, who had warned him earlier. Li Xuanfeng had a good impression of him and raised an eyebrow before nodding lightly, "Very well."

The two began moving, stepping onto the stone pathway and advancing quickly while activating their footwork techniques. Ignoring the spirit pines lining the path, they headed toward the nearest pavilion.

The pavilion was no larger than a small courtyard of a commoner's home. Two stone lions stood at its entrance. As Li Xuanfeng looked closer, he realized someone had already arrived.

A female cultivator in a red robe stood at the courtyard gate, intently examining the pavilion. She held a small halberd in her arms, no longer than her forearm. The weapon, colored in shades of red and yellow, had three prongs at the tip that curved together like petals. It resembled a ceremonial artifact more than a weapon.

As soon as Li Xuanfeng and Lin Chensheng stopped, the woman turned to glance at them warily. In a soft voice, she said, "Daoists, I arrived here first. Please look elsewhere."

Her gaze swept over Li Xuanfeng and froze when it landed on Lin Chensheng. Her eyes curved into a delighted expression as she exclaimed, "Brother Chensheng!"

Lin Chensheng was also somewhat surprised and responded, "So it is Daoist Yuzhuang..."

He gave a sincere smile and introduced her to Li Xuanfeng, "This is Daoist Bi Yuzhuang of the Hengzhu Dao Gate, a close friend of mine since childhood."

Turning to Bi Yuzhuang, Lin Chensheng smiled and said, "This is Li Xuanfeng, a capable and trusted aide of Daoist Master Yuan Su."

Bi Yuzhuang's attitude shifted noticeably as she responded with a smile, "I was just troubled over how to break this formation. I was at a loss for what to do. Your arrival is timely—why not work together to resolve it? That way, we can save time and avoid unnecessary entanglements."

Lin Chensheng scratched his head awkwardly and cupped his fist, "You know I have never been skilled with formations, and Daoist Xuanfeng is not either... If Kan Ziyu were here, perhaps we could give it a try."

Bi Yuzhuang pondered for a moment before replying, "I have been studying this formation for some time. It is quite peculiar and carries an ancient flavor. It does not follow the six-segment structure nor the nine-pattern layout. Over the centuries, as the world changed and fruition attainments shifted, its original might has greatly diminished."

She flipped her hand and retrieved several jade wedges from her storage pouch. Each wedge was attached to a few fine, elongated chains. She lightly tossed them, and the chains' ends gathered back into her hand as the jade wedges danced nimbly over the formation.

Explaining as she worked, Bi Yuzhuang said, "This formation was likely established over a thousand years ago, during a time when the Pristine Waters had yet to recede, and both Bright Yang and Veiled Yin were still present. It is even possible that the Supreme Yang and Supreme Yin still existed in the world. Hence, the formation relied on a Yin-Yang stabilization method for its core, making it exceptionally durable."

Bi Yuzhuang continued, "The world today has changed far too much. Modern cultivators favor using the Five Virtues and Three Metals as the foundation for formations, almost entirely abandoning Yin-Yang methods. While the grotto heaven has mitigated the effects of these changes, flaws have inevitably appeared."

With a gentle tug on the chains, Bi Yuzhuang revealed a series of glowing nodes across the formation. She pointed to a few of them and said softly, "If the two of you follow the guidance of my spiritual sense and strike at these weaknesses, the formation will break."

Lin Chensheng flipped his wrist and brought out a talisman. The talisman was pitch-black and shimmered faintly with multicolored light. He held it in his hand for a moment, then formed a seal and activated it, slamming it down with a loud bang.

Clearly holding back, Lin Chensheng refrained from using his full strength. The formation flickered briefly under the impact but quickly regained its brightness.

Li Xuanfeng raised his bow, but instead of nocking an arrow, he condensed a long streak of golden light and loosed it at the formation. He, too, held back his power, causing the formation to shake violently.

The formation, clearly not meticulously crafted and more akin to a casual protective barrier, was already riddled with flaws. Under the combined effort of the three, it shattered into pieces. The two stone beasts flanking the gate dimmed and lost their vitality.

The three ceased their attacks, and Bi Yuzhuang retrieved a resplendent white orb from her storage pouch, tossing it gently.

The artifact landed and immediately transformed into a white-armored warrior. Though its cultivation was only at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, it stood tall and dignified, its features symmetrical and calm. Without a word, it began marching toward the courtyard.

This reminds me of Yuan Tuan's Azure Crest Manifestation, Li Xuanfeng thought to himself.

He watched as the white-armored warrior pushed open the courtyard gate and boldly stepped inside. In the center of the courtyard lay a collapsed pile of rubble.

The rubble was still intact enough to make out the form of a stone beast that once stood there.

The creature was neither wolf nor tiger, and its shattered head on the ground bore three eyes and sharp fangs, giving it a ferocious appearance. Its third eye had a gemstone embedded in it, though its nature was unclear.

Li Xuanfeng found the stone beast oddly familiar. After a moment's thought, he suddenly realized why: Daoist Master Yuan Su had a similar stone sculpture in front of his gates.

Sure enough, both Lin Chensheng and Bi Yuzhuang turned their gazes toward him. Lin Chensheng said softly, "A Three-Eyed Mount Tiao Beast. This beast was used in ancient times to guard formations and attract wealth. They were once fairly common, but the last known sighting was... Ah!"

Li Xuanfeng recalled that Yuan Su once owned a living spirit beast of this type, which had been killed by Situ Tang of the Golden Tang Gate. He asked, "And this gemstone—what is it?"
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝒆𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝙤𝒗𝓮𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝙢

Neither Lin Chensheng nor Bi Yuzhuang could identify it, so Li Xuanfeng used his mana to retrieve it and said softly, "This item is connected to the spirit beast. I will return it to the Daoist Master. Allow me to take it for now."

The two nodded, watching as the white-armored warrior ransacked the pavilion and its side rooms, casually gathering an assortment of items and laying them out at the gate.

Among the loot were several dozen ancient texts, over ten jade bottles, and miscellaneous objects like jade pillows and mats. It seemed the courtyard's owner never anticipated intruders within the grotto heaven and had left without packing anything.

Without wasting time, Lin Chensheng took the ancient texts and distributed them among the group according to customary practice, ensuring everyone could read through them.

Li Xuanfeng examined the texts closely. Thirteen of them covered formations, seven were cultivation manuals, and the remaining dozen or so were biographies, tales, and bestiaries, most revolving around sea dragons and related aquatic species.

Bi Yuzhuang skimmed the formation manuals and sighed, "What a pity... such intricate formations... but with the changes in the world, most are no longer relevant."

Li Xuanfeng focused on the cultivation manuals. Three of them pertained to Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques, including two Grade four manuals, Six Chapters Seeking Immortality and Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique, and one Grade Five manual titled Insights of Taihua.

These ancient cultivators were certainly straightforward with their naming conventions—practical and unadorned, Li Xuanfeng thought.

Among the three, Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique focused on cultivating the six chakras of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, but the technique required transitioning exclusively to water-attributed methods afterward, which made it somewhat restrictive. The others were more flexible. However, Six Chapters Seeking Immortality included a specific note at the end, stating it could not be followed by Ancient Merging techniques.

What are these Ancient Merging Techniques? I've never heard of them before... and where would anyone find them now? Li Xuanfeng mulled over these for a while.

The three Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques were of no use to Li Xuanfeng personally, but they would be invaluable for the younger generation of his family. While he wasn't sure what techniques his relatives practiced beyond the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra, he was certain none of them had access to anything as high as Grade Five techniques.

These days, only in a grotto heaven can such high-grade techniques be found! Li Xuanfeng pondered in awe.

After memorizing the three manuals, he turned to the remaining four texts. Three were Qi Cultivation Realm techniques, incomplete and seemingly excerpts the pavilion's owner had used to make a selection. The last, however, was a complete manual that reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, suggesting it had ultimately been the owner's chosen path.

It seems the owner of this courtyard settled on this one in the end. It was easy for Li Xuanfeng to reach this conclusion.

Qi Cultivation Realm techniques were of little interest to him, so Li Xuanfeng skimmed over them. However, he carefully examined the Foundation Establishment Realm manual. The ancient book had a unique texture—firm, durable, and unlike anything common. The title, written in bold, clean characters, read, "Taiyue Northern Dawn Manual".

Intrigued, Li Xuanfeng opened the first page, preparing to study it in detail.




# Chapter 595: Moonlit Spirit Barrier

Just as Li Xuanfeng opened the book, an entire row of inked characters abruptly blurred, leaping off the page one after another in a cascade of light before vanishing entirely.

The ancient book flipped wildly in the air, its pages turning with a loud whoosh. Li Xuanfeng was struck by a wave of dizziness, and in his ears, he heard the sound of waves crashing north to south, filling the heavens and earth. The waves collided against cliffs, followed by a cold rain pouring down.

With a bang, the book disintegrated into ash, scattering across the ground. Yet the moment the ash touched the earth, it transformed into black ants, wriggling frantically as they scurried away and disappeared into the soil.

Li Xuanfeng's mind buzzed, and his gaze dropped to his own hands in a momentary daze. Nearby, Lin Chensheng turned to him and asked, "Daoist, did you finish reading all six of those techniques?"

Snapped out of his stupor, Li Xuanfeng lifted his head and nodded, "Yes, I have read them all. Unfortunately, none of them exceed the Qi Cultivation Realm."

Lin Chensheng chuckled softly and replied, "No need to worry. Once the third drum sounds in the Sea of Clouds, there will be plenty to choose from."

——————

Li Yuanjiao and Tu Longjian wandered through the forest for a while, the surroundings soon becoming enveloped in thick white mist. Growing suspicious, Li Yuanjiao said softly, "Daoist, this mist rises strangely—be cautious."

Tu Longjian smiled faintly, his gaze sweeping across the mist, "This fog can block spiritual senses; it is indeed peculiar. Let us take to the skies instead. Stay close behind me, and do not fall behind."

Li Yuanjiao, ever cunning, heard this and immediately suspected something. He deduced with seventy percent certainty that the descent of the grotto heaven was imminent. Nodding, he took to the air, sticking closely to Tu Longjian's side.

As soon as they rose into the sky, the setting sun on the horizon vanished in an instant, replaced by a brilliant expanse of stars. The stars hung motionless, perfectly aligned in the heavens.

The surrounding ocean had completely disappeared, leaving behind an endless sea of clouds and undulating mountain ranges. Feigning alarm, Li Yuanjiao exclaimed, "This is not good! We have fallen into someone's illusory formation!"

Tu Longjian's expression grew serious as he scrutinized Li Yuanjiao's reaction. Seeing this, his final doubts dissipated. Laughing heartily, he said, "Senior, this is none other than the Mirrored Mirage Grotto Heaven!"

Li Yuanjiao's expression turned to one of genuine surprise. The plan had always been to reach the Green Pine Grotto Heaven, so how had the Mirrored Mirage suddenly come into play?

Sensing his confusion, Tu Longjian explained, "The Green Pine Temple lies within the Mirrored Mirage Grotto Heaven, which has remained sealed for countless years. Those ignorant of its secrets simply linked the two names together. The Daoist Masters have been more than happy to let this misnomer persist."

Continuing his explanation, Tu Lingjian said, "This grotto heaven was originally created by the ancient cultivator Yingze, borrowing from the Dao lineage of the Immortal Lord. How could it have been called Green Pine Grotto Heaven?"

Li Yuanjiao outwardly feigned shock at this revelation, but inwardly, his thoughts churned with even greater alarm. Based on Tu Longjian's words and actions thus far, he felt increasingly certain, This man has almost certainly uncovered the truth... perhaps even freed himself from the control of the Daoist Masters!

Furrowing his brows, Li Yuanjiao let a mix of joy and apprehension cross his face. Speaking in a low tone, he said, "Since we have been fortunate enough to enter, this is undoubtedly a great opportunity. Whether or not we leave here alive, however... that is another matter entirely."

Tu Longjian gave a slight nod, and Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist respectfully, "It seems that Daoist Longjian is well-versed in the grotto heaven. I will have to rely on you for the remainder of our journey."

Tu Longjian smiled and replied, "Senior, there is no need for such formality."

After exchanging a few words, the two agreed to continue traveling together. Li Yuanjiao, uninterested in the treasures of the grotto heaven, was focused on finding Yu Muxian. He wondered whether his elder had already encountered him or even begun fighting.

Tu Longjian rose into the air alongside him, choosing a random direction. Standing at ease on the clouds, his gaze fixed on the distant mountain ranges, while the token at his waist swayed lightly.

After orienting himself, he selected a route through the layers of clouds. They flew for a while before hearing the sounds of commotion and combat.

"Someone has beaten us to it..." Tu Longjian frowned, muttering his displeasure. The golden hammer reappeared in his hand.

Moments later, the clouds ahead began to tremble violently as lights of various spells and techniques clashed in midair. The sound of artifacts striking each other rang out like metal on metal.

About five or six cultivators surrounded a small hill, warily guarding against one another. Atop the hill was a tall stone platform, upon which rested a small jade bottle.

The bottle was intricately carved with silver osmanthus blossoms and encased in a silver-white spirit barrier. Its purpose or origin was unclear, but the edges of the barrier exuded strands of moonlit mist, ethereal and serene, giving it an extraordinary, otherworldly quality.

At the center of the group stood a middle-aged man in a dark Daoist robe, his expression cold and stern. Tall and thin, his robes were adorned with subtle patterns that spoke of exceptional craftsmanship, marking them as refined Dharma attire. In his hand, he held a purple sandalwood duster and scanned the crowd with icy eyes, speaking softly, "This Foundation Establishment Realm spirit barrier... belongs to Changxiao Gate. Consider your actions carefully, all of you."

Nearby, a red-robed cultivator sneered in response, his tone mocking as he retorted, "Well then, Xun Yizi, take your precious barrier and leave. Let the rest of us see what kind of treasure lies within that jade bottle!"

The tall, gaunt man in the Daoist robes didn't respond, his cold gaze sweeping over the crowd. From their perch amidst the clouds, Li Yuanjiao and Tu Longjian silently observed the scene, their eyes scanning the five or six cultivators.

Among them was a female cultivator in a light purple Daoist robe. Petite and refined, she stood atop a floating cloud, carefully examining the object within the spirit barrier. One delicate hand held a small golden mountain, while the other gripped a jade orb. She was none other than Kong Tingyun of the Profound Peak Gate!

On the opposite side stood a young man with a refined appearance, his brows furrowed as if debating whether to retreat. Though Li Yuanjiao had only seen him a few times, the young man's face was etched into his memory.

Zhong Qian!

Li Yuanjiao continued observing, scrutinizing the identities and backgrounds of the others. Meanwhile, Tu Longjian's gaze burned with intensity as he murmured, "Senior... whatever's inside that jade bottle must be something extraordinary! If a fight breaks out, just worry about keeping yourself safe."

Hearing this, Li Yuanjiao shifted his focus to the tall platform.

The platform itself was unremarkable, constructed of ordinary materials. The silver-white spirit barrier atop it, however, was far from ordinary. Its faint glow exuded an aura of strength, and its four corners were engraved with motifs of moon rabbits—marking it as a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact from the ancient cultivators.

Within the barrier, a silver-white bottle seemed to faintly emerge and recede. Overflowing with spiritual energy, the bottle's moonlit patterns were ancient and enigmatic yet oddly familiar. The moonlit mist drifting around the bottle was so familiar it could not be mistaken.

Li Yuanjiao silently chuckled to himself. The sight of the mist was unmistakable—he had seen it thousands of times in his own household. He knew exactly what it was, and its value was enough to drive every cultivator present mad with greed, Supreme Yin Moonlight Essence!




# Chapter 596: The Six Platforms of the Grand Hall

Li Yuanjiao was witnessing Supreme Yin Moonlight outside of his family's residence for the first time. Encased in a silver-plated ancient jade bottle adorned with ancient talismans, it was placed reverently on a jade platform, further shielded by an ancient spirit barrier. Even in this grotto heaven, it was clear this object was treated with the utmost respect.

The jade platform was intricately carved with various formations, suggesting it was once used to assist cultivation or extract secondary spiritual qi. However, these formations had long since lost their functionality, now appearing as mere decorative patterns.

In his family's secret chamber, where streams of moonlight essence flowed freely, Li Yuanjiao had grown accustomed to its silvery glow. It was ordinary to him—almost mundane.

Yet, when placed in this ceremonial setting, its rarity and value became strikingly evident. The silver-white radiance was dazzling. Li Yuanjiao remained composed, but the cultivators around the platform began to recognize the item. The atmosphere quickly grew tense.

The Jiangnan region had once been the site of the Moonlight Origin Mansion, with its Daoist legacy passed down through generations of immortal sects. Each family guarded its collection of ancient techniques, smithing methods, and divine abilities, making such treasures highly coveted. Even if one couldn't use it personally, delivering it to a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master would bring immense rewards.

The gathered cultivators' eyes grew bloodshot, their greed palpable. Only a few retained their composure, and even those few seemed less immune to temptation than ignorant of the object's true nature.

Among them, the tall and slender Xun Yizi, dressed in dark Daoist robes, was the first to recognize the treasure. He gripped the corner of his robe with one hand while clutching a purple sandalwood duster in the other. His wide, unblinking eyes seemed ready to fall from their sockets.

Sweeping his gaze across the crowd, Xun Yizi spoke first, saying, "There are six of us here, four from the three sects and seven gates of Yue State. If this treasure is to be shared, it should remain with Yue State. Overseas cultivators would do well to leave immediately!"

His words carried an obvious implication. Both Zhong Qian and the red-robed man's expressions shifted subtly. The red-robed man sneered and retorted, "Xun Yizi, your petty schemes are laughable. Trying to drive others away with vague words—how dare you bring such trickery to the table? I, for one, will flip the table over!"

Laughing aloud, he cupped his fist toward the surrounding five people and declared, "Let it be known to all: this treasure is none other than the long-lost Supreme Yin Moonlight! The ancient texts mention it under names such as Veiled Supreme Yin Qi, Great Moonlight Instrument, or even Extreme Yin. They all refer to this very item!"

The booming voice echoed across the clouds, causing a ripple of spiritual energies to stir nearby. It was as if the speaker feared no one would recognize the object and loudly proclaimed its identity, watching the surrounding cultivators' expressions of shock and awe with a triumphant laugh.

"Guo Hong'er!" The face of Xun Yizi, clad in dark robes, darkened severely. He muttered the name under his breath, while the red-robed man, unperturbed, casually dusted off his robes and slid a token into his sleeve.

With an indifferent hum, he turned and walked away, "Fight amongst yourselves as you will. Consider this my courtesy to all of you—Crimson Reef Island will not be joining the fray!"

His parting words left Xun Yizi seething with rage, his fury plain as he realized the trap Guo Hong'er had laid for him. The glances from the others surrounding the platform told him that there would be no peaceful resolution now.

The tension hung thick in the air for several moments before a young cultivator dressed in black cupped his fist respectfully and said, "Such treasures are beyond my means. I shall not involve myself in this matter."

The speaker was none other than Zhong Qian. Known for his low profile, he clearly recognized the immense trouble possession of this item would bring. Without hesitation, he turned and flew off.

Xun Yizi scanned the remaining four individuals and the faint, hidden presences lingering in the clouds above. He spoke in a deep tone, "If anyone here withdraws, consider it a personal favor to Xun Yizi of the Changxiao Gate."

His plea fell flat, eliciting little response. The cultivators stood silently, their gazes fixed intently on the silver-shrouded treasure atop the jade platform. Realizing diplomacy had failed, Xun Yizi abruptly sprang into action, his hand reaching for the object.

BOOM!

A thunderous explosion erupted as five or six artifacts flew toward him, intercepting his grasp. Expecting resistance, Xun Yizi feinted, drawing back his outstretched hand and instead attacking a nearby cultivator with his purple sandalwood duster.

"You!" The cultivator yelped.

Chaos unfolded as beams of light shot across the sky, their radiance interweaving in dazzling displays. Several cultivators unleashed their Immortal Foundations, their artifacts clashing with deafening force.

Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao and Tu Longjian remained aloft, silently observing the unfolding battle. Tu Longjian squinted, his spiritual sense weaving in and out as it exchanged information with the token hanging at his waist. He waited for the opportune moment.

Li Yuanjiao swept his gaze across the field and spotted Kong Tingyun using her jade orb to block incoming attacks. She stood quietly at the battlefield's edge, one hand supporting the small golden mountain she seemed to be weighing, considering where to hurl it.

Having witnessed the devastating effects of Kong Tingyun's golden mountain before, Li Yuanjiao knew its unanticipated power, especially against spellcasting cultivators.

Tu Longjian hoisted his slender, pole-like golden hammer, appearing ready to strike. Li Yuanjiao spoke softly, "Fellow Daoist, that cultivator from the Profound Peak Gate is an old acquaintance of mine. Perhaps we could coordinate our efforts."

Tu Longjian nodded in understanding. "Let us strike now. None of them seem particularly formidable."

He wasted no time. Tu Longjian hoisted his golden hammer and descended with the wind, streaking downward like a bolt of lightning.

Tu Longjian's hammer was an unusual dharma artifact, slender and elongated. The hammerhead itself was only about half the size of an average human head, while the shaft more closely resembled a spear or polearm. Its design made it seem less like a traditional hammer and more like a long-handled weapon as it swung downward with precision.

The golden-robed cultivator below, his affiliation unknown, caught sight of the descending hammer. His expression shifted instantly to shock and fear as he recognized the descending figure, Tu Longjian!

Abandoning the spell he had been casting, he ignored his opponent entirely and slapped the jade pendant at his waist. Streams of light surged upward from his body and coalesced into a formidable shield.

A sharp, shattering sound rang out as the shield splintered and dissolved into dust under the hammer's force. Tu Longjian pursued his target without pause, striking with relentless precision. Within a dozen exchanges, the cultivator took a heavy blow to the chest, spat out blood, and fled into the cloud sea, vanishing without a backward glance.

Li Yuanjiao recalled Tu Longjian's earlier words and decided not to intervene. Instead, he activated the Profound Patterned Spirit Mist, edging slowly toward the battlefield's periphery.

As he approached, a woman in a pale yellow-green feathered robe turned sharply toward him, her voice cold and alert, "Who goes there?"

Li Yuanjiao subtly revealed the outline of the Profound Patterned Spirit Mist. The woman, Kong Tingyun, hesitated, her expression uncertain. "Brother Yuanjiao?"

"It is me," he replied calmly.

Kong Tingyun's tension eased, her face lighting up with a mix of relief and surprise. "You made it in as well! At least I have someone to rely on now... You should be careful—this place is full of hidden dangers."

Li Yuanjiao hovered midair, speaking evenly. "I entered with a companion to gather qi on the island. We had not expected to end up here."

"I see..." Kong Tingyun retreated a step, distancing herself slightly from the main battlefield. The two observed from a vantage point among the clouds as she quietly explained the situation. "The item in the center is Supreme Yin Moonlight. It is nearly impossible to claim, but I am here to see who ultimately takes it."

She smiled slyly, her eyes narrowing with a hint of cunning. "Right now, it is out of reach... but that could change."

Li Yuanjiao understood her implication and nodded lightly. The two exchanged a few words as the battle below began to resolve itself.

The cultivator in black robes, Xun Yizi, had initially been the strongest among the combatants. His superior techniques had allowed him to fend off their attacks until Tu Longjian intervened, disrupting the stalemate and unwittingly easing the pressure on Xun Yizi.

Now, the two stood at a tense impasse around the jade platform, while the other cultivators who hadn't yet withdrawn continued circling the battlefield in the surrounding cloud sea.

Xun Yizi looked visibly displeased. He recognized Tu Longjian immediately, as well as the Six Ding Merging Fire Token at his waist. This ancient spirit artifact was famed for its ability to subdue demons and was equally formidable against cultivators.

As Tu Longjian activated the token, torrents of gray flame surged outward, exuding oppressive heat. The surrounding cultivators instinctively stepped back, shielding themselves from the scorching energy. Xun Yizi, standing closest, broke out into a sweat under the blazing pressure.

Xun Yizi and Tu Longjian both leveraged the unspoken rule that no one in a grotto heaven wanted to risk grievous injury. However, the moment Tu Longjian produced an ancient spirit artifact, the situation reversed.

Better to avoid him for now... there will be plenty of time for him to suffer later! Xun Yizi stepped back several paces, gritted his teeth, and ultimately retreated into the cloud sea, disappearing from view as Tu Longjian had anticipated. Tu Longjian shook his head slightly, channeling his power into the silver spirit barrier.

As the silver-white spirit barrier's engraved jade rabbits lit up one after another, Tu Longjian performed a series of incantations. The barrier rapidly shrank into his palm, and he collected the jade bottle, scanning the cloud sea. The surrounding cultivators hesitated briefly but eventually withdrew.

Kong Tingyun glanced at him, quickly understanding, and asked, "This Tu Longjian—is he your friend?"

"An acquaintance," replied Li Yuanjiao with a slight nod.

Kong Tingyun appeared worried, muttering softly, "This man is formidable. Among the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators here, he is likely among the top-tier. Be cautious and measured."

The two watched as Tu Longjian stowed the treasure. A flicker of light crossed his gaze, and in moments, he located them in the cloud sea. Flying over, he greeted Kong Tingyun with a cool, distant tone, "Greetings, Fellow Daoist."

Kong Tingyun returned the gesture politely. Tu Longjian turned to Li Yuanjiao, his tone notably warmer. "Senior, we should head for the mountains without delay. If we tarry, we will miss the chance to claim something valuable."

————

Li Xuanfeng and his two companions departed the small courtyard, employing swift footwork techniques as they ascended the mountain. The cave dwellings they passed were desolate, clearly having already been explored by cultivators who then moved toward the summit.

As they approached the mountain's peak, they came upon more than ten figures gathered before a grand hall, silently examining the formations etched into its surface. None made a move to enter.

Li Xuanfeng narrowed his eyes, quickly spotting a familiar figure in golden robes amidst the crowd. The man was youthful and handsome, with twin blades strapped to his back, his entire form enveloped in dark, black flames.

It was no surprise to Li Xuanfeng to see Situ Chen here, given that he had been tracking him. Avoiding unnecessary attention, Li Xuanfeng shifted his gaze to the grand hall itself.

The hall, constructed primarily in shades of pale blue and white, exuded grandeur. The floor was paved with white jade-like tiles, etched with elegant patterns, while massive jade pillars flanked the entrance. At the far end sat an immortal throne, flanked by six jade platforms.

On each platform rested a jade box. Five of the boxes sat undisturbed, faintly glowing. However, the final platform presented a peculiar sight.

Two figures were frozen there, one sitting cross-legged with a pale face, one hand resting on his knee and the other clutching his chest, a gleaming sword impaled through his torso. The blade protruded from his back, flashing cold light.

The second figure kneeled before the jade platform, left hand raised as if to seize something, right hand planted on the ground. The jade box from the platform lay cracked on the floor, its corner chipped.

These figures appeared lifelike, as if only moments ago locked in fierce combat. The scene seemed to have been frozen in time, the hall itself preserving their moment of confrontation.

From Li Xuanfeng's vantage point, the inside of the jade box was visible—completely empty save for a small, circular indentation. The hollow was approximately the thickness of a pinky finger, suggesting it once housed a ring-shaped dharma artifact.

At the very center of the grand hall stood a massive copper bell, adorned with two peculiar and intricate patterns. It hung silently, suspended in the middle of the hall, exuding an aura of mystery.

Beneath the bell, six meditation mats were arranged neatly, with an assortment of items placed upon them. Most of these were partially opened ancient tomes, alongside small, portable dharma artifacts.

These items were either set atop the mats or carefully placed beside them, creating an impression of abundance yet maintaining a remarkable sense of order.

The formation within the hall flickered intermittently, casting an ever-changing glow. The cultivators gathered outside the hall stood still, none daring to step inside. They watched intently, exchanging cautious glances, each waiting for someone else to make the first move.

Lin Chensheng cast a glance at the scene and transmitted a message quietly with his mana, "Do you recognize the two people in the hall?"

Li Xuanfeng squinted, observing the figure with a sword through their chest. The robes looked familiar, and after some thought, he realized they bore a resemblance to the attire of Azure Pond Sect, though not entirely identical.

Beside him, Bi Yuzhuang spoke softly, "Could that be... Yu Xiuxian? Was he not the senior disciple of Yuanwu Peak?"

"It seems... it might be..." Lin Chensheng carefully examined the figure, nodding as he spoke in a low tone, "Yu Xiuxian was killed by Guo Er back then. Yuanwu Peak even stormed into the Eastern Sea, causing a huge uproar until Guo Shentong made extensive reparations. I did not expect that he truly died here in the grotto heaven!"

The two discussed for a while, glanced at the other unidentified cultivator's remains, and eventually gave up trying to determine their identity. Suddenly, they saw a streak of golden light rise in the distance. It followed the emerald jade pathway and eventually descended in front of the grand hall.

The golden light slowly dissipated, revealing two figures. One was a man with a grim expression, clad in a black-and-gold daoist robe, wielding a long halberd. His cultivation was at the late Foundation Establishment Realm, and he stood staring at the figure inside the grand hall. His daoist robe bore a striking resemblance to the attire worn by the skeleton within the hall, sharing at least seven parts of its design.

The second individual was also at the late Foundation Establishment Realm, dressed in flowing white robes that exuded an otherworldly elegance. He held a longsword in one hand, while his waist was adorned with a crystalline, translucent jade buckle. His jet-black hair flowed freely, and his expression was cold and indifferent as his sharp gaze scanned the grand formation.

Lin Chensheng and Bi Yuzhuang exchanged glances, their suspicions solidifying. Lin Chensheng whispered, "That is Tang Shedu from Yuanwu Peak! Judging by his attire, the skeleton inside must be Yu Xiuxian... As for that man in white, I have never seen him before."

Li Xuanfeng remained silent, his gaze seemingly casual but briefly pausing at the jade buckle on the white-robed man's waist. Within his heart, he murmured quietly, Yu Muxian...!




# Chapter 601: Morality

Li Xuanfeng and Xiao Yongling descended the mountain together. On their way up, they had rushed and not paid much attention, but now, as they reached the foot of the mountain, they noticed a small platform. Scattered across it were six ancient lamp stands, lying askew.

These lamp stands, dark gray and simple, were mostly broken into pieces. Evidently, they had once held treasures that had drawn intense competition, leaving behind clear traces of battle.

Reaching the platform's edge, the two stepped onto the wind and flew toward the sea of clouds. Xiao Yongling spoke softly, a trace of wonder in his tone, "This Green Pine Grotto Heaven... originally named Mirrored Mirage, was established by the ancient immortal cultivator Yingze. It is also the last remnant of the Green Pine Dao lineage. My family's ancestor once said that Yingze carried both the powers of the Supreme Yin and the Supreme Yang, thus earning the name Yingze."

Xiao Yongling continued, "When he created this grotto heaven, his cultivation had already reached its peak. He sought transcendence and aimed to find a new path between the Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang... But in the end, he perished, and there was no further news of him."

Li Xuanfeng gazed at the vast sea of clouds below his feet, pondering for a few moments. He hesitated to ask if this immortal's surname was Lu, wary of revealing too much with Golden Core Realm cultivators present. Instead, he asked, "If the sea of clouds above and below represents different layers, would there not also be treasures hidden in the lower layer if we have already taken them from above?"

Xiao Yongling paused momentarily before explaining, "I had a similar thought when I entered. I came across a small peak that was deserted, where I found a jade slip with a spell. After retrieving it, I returned to the sea of clouds below, only to find that the peak had become completely barren."

Li Xuanfeng considered this briefly before murmuring, "Perhaps we are all within the lower realm, each searching for our own opportunities, while the upper realm is merely a projection..."

When Li Xuanfeng had entered the grotto heaven, he had immediately descended into the sea of clouds, believing he was in the lower realm. Thus, he voiced this deduction. Opposite him, Xiao Yongling frowned and replied, "This is the lower realm? I have traversed this space several times, only to return to where I first entered..."

Li Xuanfeng looked at him, and a look of shock gradually appeared on his face. Meanwhile, Xiao Yongling's expression became increasingly uneasy. Li Xuanfeng spoke softly, "Senior, please wait here. Let me go down and take a look."

He rode the wind and dove headfirst into the sea of clouds. After just a single breath of time, he emerged from the lower edge of the cloud layer, now inverted, and ascended once more, riding the wind upward.

Before him stood a middle-aged man clad in white, a sword at his waist—it was Xiao Yongling!

The Xiao Yongling before him clutched his sleeve, his expression puzzled as he looked at Li Xuanfeng. In a calm tone, he said, "I thought you would investigate for a while longer. I did not expect you to return so quickly after just diving down. Did you discover anything?"

Li Xuanfeng was struck with alarm and replied in a low voice, "Who are you...?!"

Xiao Yongling frowned, sensing that something was amiss. Li Xuanfeng came to a realization, silently retreated a step, and once again plunged into the sea of clouds.

He took another breath of time to pass through the dense gray clouds, flying upward on the wind. As he emerged, there was yet another Xiao Yongling standing above the sea of clouds. Li Xuanfeng's expression turned complex as he gazed at this Xiao Yongling hovering above. In a quiet voice, he said, "I will remain here. Senior, why not go down and take a look for yourself?"

Xiao Yongling's face darkened slightly. After a moment's hesitation, he gave a brief nod and descended into the sea of clouds. Li Xuanfeng fixed his gaze on him, watching as yet another Xiao Yongling rose from the clouds below. This figure turned around, and the sword, which had been strapped to his left side, remained exactly in place.

Xiao Yongling stood in silence for a moment, his disbelief evident. Finally, he spoke, "Could it be... that this is an illusion? It appears as though we are diving into the clouds, but in reality, we are being transported back by some kind of maze formation... giving us the sensation of traversing two realms."

Li Xuanfeng shook his head slightly and said, "Senior, ride the wind down again. This time, look carefully at the stars in the lower realm."

Xiao Yongling nodded, descending once more. From beneath the clouds rose yet another Xiao Yongling. This figure lifted his head to the sky, his face marked with shock. "The stars above and below are indeed reversed... This is not the same realm. Entering this grotto heaven has created a shadow of ourselves in the lower world..."

"What just occurred on that mountain... it has been mirrored below the clouds, completely intact!" Li Xuanfeng remained silent. He had initially assumed that the reflections conjured by the grotto heaven would differ, akin to the inversion of stars between the realms. Yet, as it turned out, they were perfectly identical.

Once Xiao Yongling had processed his astonishment, Li Xuanfeng softly remarked, "But... how can we be certain... that we ourselves are not merely reflections projected by this grotto heaven?"

The two spent some time experimenting, diving in and out of the sea of clouds. No matter how many times they moved, the figures above and below were indistinguishable. When one descended from the upper realm, the other ascended from the lower. If not for the precautions they had taken to coordinate beforehand, it would have been impossible to tell the difference.

Xiao Yongling fell silent, staring at the sea of clouds in a daze for what felt like dozens of breaths. Finally, with a hint of despair, he murmured, "The divine abilities of ancient cultivators... their power truly defies comprehension."

————

Tu Longjian charged into the hall and seized an item before swiftly exiting. Riding the wind, he flew across the cloud sea for some time. Li Yuanjiao had already revealed his figure, having never entered the mountain. Instead, he had been waiting in the cloud sea all along.

Li Yuanjiao stood amidst the sea of clouds, refraining from joining the fray below. Instead, he focused on identifying Yu Muxian's figure and scrutinizing the overwhelming aura emanating from the person standing beside him. A heavy pressure weighed on his heart. "Two cultivators at the late Foundation Establishment Realm... Who knows what sort of protective artifacts Yu Muxian has on him..."

Tang Shedu stayed close by Yu Muxian's side, not straying a single step. If Yu Muxian were to be killed, it would require dealing with Tang Shedu as well. Li Yuanjiao silently acknowledged that his own strength might not be sufficient for such a task.

His expression darkened. At that moment, Tu Longjian returned triumphantly, clearly pleased with himself. Noticing Li Yuanjiao's troubled demeanor, he spoke up, "Senior, what troubles you?"

Li Yuanjiao's concern was evident, his voice steady but heavy. "I spotted an old enemy... He is already at the late Foundation Establishment Realm. It makes me worry for the future."

Tu Longjian observed him carefully, noting the fine beads of sweat glistening on his forehead. He lowered his gaze thoughtfully. After they flew together for a short distance, Tu Longjian softly said, "Senior... I have never forgotten the kindness you showed me in the past. Would you care to share the details?"

He paused briefly, watching as Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist in a respectful salute and murmured a word of thanks. Tu Longjian then continued, "May I ask who it is?"

"Yu Muxian of Yuanwu Peak," Li Yuanjiao stated plainly.

As soon as the name was uttered, Tu Longjian fell into a prolonged silence. It was only after what felt like an eternity that he finally spoke, his tone subdued. "That man carries Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts... and not just one."

Li Yuanjiao's eyelids twitched. He silently rested his hand on the hilt of his sword, his thoughts racing, This complicates matters...

Tu Longjian hesitated for several breaths, his gaze lingering on Li Yuanjiao. At last, he quietly asked, "Senior... why do you need to kill him?"

Li Yuanjiao recounted the enmity between the Yu and Li families in broad strokes. After a brief moment of hesitation, he added, "For the Li Family to advance further—whether it be for territory or influence—this man must die. If he reaches the Purple Mansion Realm, our family's position will be crushed. Yu Muxian is heartless and ruthless; he will not hold back."

Tu Longjian pondered his words for a moment, his expression becoming slightly inscrutable. Finally, he murmured, "In the end, it is all a matter of interest—taking lives for the sake of gain."

Li Yuanjiao fell silent for a moment, his voice turning hoarse. "You are correct... Yu Muxian entered Azure Pond Sect at the age of eight. He has spent his years in secluded cultivation. I have never heard of him harming others..."

His vision dimmed slightly, his Immortal Foundation wavering. A wave of fear crept into his heart, filling him with a sense of helplessness. Beads of cold sweat gathered on his face, dripping steadily. He finally broke the silence, his voice trembling slightly.

"People like us are not like you. Our lives are spent walking on a knife's edge. The things we do... they are far from honorable. We kill for wealth, for self-preservation, for family... And sometimes, the people we kill do not deserve to die."

"I have lost count of how many lives I have taken. I do not fear death, nor do I claim to follow a righteous path. I do not weigh sins against virtues. My family has shed blood at Moongaze Lake, and among those who perished, not all were guilty."

"The road to the Dao stretches endlessly forward. Do you think every obstacle in the way is a despicable villain? No. The path to power is not paved with ethereal purity and celestial grace. My family... we are merely struggling to survive."

Li Yuanjiao stood with his hands clasped behind his back, the sharp blade at his waist emitting a faint hum. A cooling sensation spread through his Shenyang Mansion, gradually calming his turbulent emotions. His tone softened as he continued, "I do not offer this as an excuse. I am simply not a virtuous man. My family treats mortals and rogue cultivators kindly. We do not cultivate through blood qi, and I rarely harm others without cause. But when the survival of my family is at stake, I cannot afford to retreat."

Tu Longjian stared at him blankly before responding, "Senior, you misunderstand me..."

He fell silent for several breaths, as if he had more to say. However, before the words could leave his lips, a deep, resonant drumbeat reverberated through the heavens.

Boom!

Both men instinctively turned their gazes skyward. Amidst the vast sea of stars, a brilliant white light emerged, scattering clouds as it descended. Amid the glittering starlight, a jade wall slowly rose into view.

The jade wall was covered in dense engravings, etched with countless names. Amidst the hazy clouds, it appeared blurred and indistinct. Several streaks of light rose from the horizon, heading toward the jade wall.

Boom!

A second deep drumbeat echoed through the air. Tu Longjian hurriedly said, "Senior! The Three Drums Wall is descending. Let us go observe it first. We can discuss this matter later!"

The two of them soared into the sky, Tu Longjian's hand gently brushing over the black-red token at his waist as his spiritual sense stirred. What madness is this? Why would you use your divine ability to influence him!

The token flickered faintly, transmitting a weak spiritual response, You are the one who's mad! Why would you provoke that Yu Muxian! I know someone like you, still clinging to notions of old debts. If I act to deter him and make him retreat on his own, wouldn't that be perfect? But alas, my strength has waned... and this man's will is solid... he actually broke free of it on his own...

Tu Longjian's anger flared but there was no opportunity to lash out, so he could only sulk as he flew higher into the clouds, glancing into the distance.

The skies were already filled with figures, their forms scattered within the cloud layers. Many familiar faces hovered silently in the mist, all intently watching the jade wall, waiting. Tu Longjian turned to Li Yuanjiao behind him and said softly, "This is an opportunity open to all... Senior, let us wait a moment."

The two stood in midair for some time. Slowly, the veil of mist shrouding the jade wall dispersed, revealing a massive surface inscribed with tightly packed ancient characters. At a glance, all the markings on the jade wall appeared to be names of techniques.

The sight in the clouds was spectacular. Nearly all those within the grotto heaven had gathered here, their robes and garments of every color glimmering in the light of their dharma artifacts and spirit tools. Each cultivator stood frozen, hands forming incantations, their gazes fixed on the jade wall.

Boom!

The third drumbeat reverberated at last. None dared to move as two figures materialized before the jade wall.

One figure was tall and clad in ancient white robes, cascading downward in flowing lines with two pale sashes hanging loosely at his sides. His face was obscured by a hazy aura, and golden-white halos rippled outward behind his head, marking him as no ordinary being.

The other appeared to be a youth, sitting cross-legged atop a cloud with his feet dangling freely. He leaned lazily against the Three Drums Wall, holding a jade pot in one hand and casually pouring its contents into his mouth. His face, too, was veiled in indistinct mist, while his other hand rested on his knee.

The youth spoke softly, "I have always had a question I cannot resolve. I wonder if Senior might enlighten me."

The standing figure gave a slight nod.

The youth asked, "Does morality truly exist in this world?"

"I have wandered across Jiangnan and the Eastern Seas, witnessing countless people and countless events. Conflicts in this world stem first from gain, second from emotion, and only third from morality." He continued, "Forget about good and evil. Killing someone to advance one's cultivation—could that be considered moral?"

The white-robed figure shook his head definitively. The youth chuckled and pressed on, "If killing to cultivate is immoral, then what about killing to seize treasure—can that be called moral?"

The white-robed figure gave a faint shake of his head.

The youth persisted, "Then is it moral to harm and kill in the name of stealing another's heritage or dharma artifact? If it is immoral to harm and kill for the sake of theft, then enslaving others must also be immoral. If enslaving others is immoral, then renting land to tenants and collecting taxes or tributes must likewise be acts of exploitation! Buying cheap and selling high, extorting excessive profits—are these not also violations of morality?"

The youth's voice remained light and airy, "In that case, let me ask you, Senior: Since the dawn of human society, when has the ruling class ever possessed morality? And when have the ruled ever followed morality?"

The white-robed figure gently shook his head and replied, "It is precisely because human hearts are mired in greed that we, who are blessed by the heavens and earth, must act to set the world right. We are tasked with correcting humanity and nurturing our own morality... to enter the world and cultivate by upholding justice."

The young man straightened his back, his gaze fixed on the figure before him, and his tone grew cold and stern, "If we go by what you have just said, the Wei State is still cultivating Bright Yang, with its system of three wives and four concubines. They have established an imperial hierarchy, centralizing power into a single figure and enforcing a rigid structure of reverence and submission. Where, then, is the concept of governance through noninterference? In today's world, when have cultivators ever shown any true morality?"

He let out a cold laugh. "So this is your logic: cultivate immortality, cultivate immortality... but no matter what we cultivators do, we are born guilty! As long as there is injustice and inequality in this world, it can all be blamed on us. And then what? So what? What does it have to do with me?"

His tone was icy, and though he addressed the figure before him as senior, there was no hint of reverence in his words, only audacious defiance.

The figure in white spoke softly, "In ancient times, men and women mingled freely, and they felt no shame in being without clothing; union itself was considered morality. In the distant past, when heaven and earth had no order, treasures were claimed by the capable, and that, too, was morality. Today, under imperial rule, the authority of rulers and parents is morality. Morality, like the fruits of the Dao, is ever-changing. It is not a static thing."

"Oh?" The young man burst into laughter, his laughter rolling out uncontrollably, his body swaying with amusement.

The figure in white merely stood there in silence, observing him until the young man finally subdued his laughter. When he spoke again, his voice carried a biting edge, "So, senior, your so-called morality is like dandelion fluff in the wind, changing at every whim! You keep your eyes fixed on the heavens, bowing to the celestial tribulations above, letting them dictate everything. With reins through your nose like an old ox plowing a field, you move wherever you are directed!"

His tone turned chilling, his words laden with scorn, "Then remember this, senior—perhaps someday, killing others to cultivate will also be considered morality! After all, the fault lies not with me, but with the times, with the heavens themselves!"




# Chapter 605: Tang Shedu

He wore a serene expression, as if admiring the scenery within the clouds. Decades of torment and cultivation had completely severed the connection between his inner emotions and his outward expressions. Standing with his hands clasped behind his back, he gazed at the small mountain peak gradually emerging in the distance.

Smiling, he glanced at Tang Shedu and spoke softly, "Senior Brother, why not descend and take a look?"

On the mountain peak, two figures stood locked in confrontation. One of them wielded a pair of large copper bowls, unleashing arcs of lightning and flickering purple light, his expression ferocious. His attire was unfamiliar, suggesting a lineage not commonly seen.

The other figure held twin blades, his body exuding a black and red mist-like flame. His expression was equally tense, with anger barely restrained, as he spoke in a cold tone, "Miao Ye... you truly are out to make life difficult for me, are you not?"

Miao Ye clutched the two copper bowls tightly, his face fierce. Between them, resting on the peak, was a long halberd of deep golden hue. Its shaft curved like a crescent moon, towering taller than an average person, standing silently on the mountain.

"There is no one else here, and the closing of the grotto heaven is near. Why not settle this with a proper fight?" Miao Ye suggested.

Overlooking the scene from the clouds, Yu Muxian appeared relaxed, while Tang Shedu cradled his own halberd, his demeanor indifferent. Yet his gaze lingered on the golden halberd below, betraying a glimmer of interest. He murmured, "That is Situ Chen... the current heir of the Situ Family. After so many years of turmoil in the Golden Tang Gate, how many heirs have died? At last, there is one who is capable."

Yu Muxian's eyes glowed faintly white as he activated his perception technique to examine the artifact on the peak. His own Immortal Foundation circulated within him, its power now even more extraordinary as he had advanced to the late Foundation Establishment Realm. Immediately, he gleaned details about the artifact.

"It is indeed an ancient Foundation Establishment Realm artifact," Yu Muxian said softly. "Likely belonging to some general of the Wei State from long ago. It carries the essence of the Bright Yang. The Wei State always loved crafting halberds and spears as symbols of their valor."

Tang Shedu paused, then chuckled. "When Zhao Zhaowu Emperor conquered the Wei State, he melted down all their weapons to forge the Heavenly Martial Hall. These kinds of artifacts vanished after that. Only a place like this grotto heaven could still hold remnants."

"Senior Brother, are you tempted?" Yu Muxian teased with a faint smile.

Tang Shedu clasped his hands behind his back, smiling lightly. "Though it does not perfectly align with my cultivation technique, it is still an ancient artifact. Studying it could be of great benefit."

"As for these two..." Tang Shedu cast an indifferent glance toward the peak. "Kill the one from the Miao Family. As for the one from the Situ Family—Situ Tang had ties with our master. We should at least show some courtesy."

Tang Shedu lifted the halberd in his arms and lightly tapped his belt. Instantly, golden radiance surged around him, coalescing into a majestic suit of spirit armor.

Yu Muxian adjusted his feathered robe, more suited to spellwork than combat, and smiled faintly. "I wonder how Senior Brother's cultivation measures up these days. Why not go down and try?"

"With pleasure!" Tang Shedu laughed heartily and descended toward the peak with his halberd.

Miao Ye and Situ Chen were in the midst of their clash when Tang Shedu arrived, flying through the air. Both hesitated briefly, sensing his arrival. Yet, before they could react, Tang Shedu's expression turned cold. With a quick flick and hook of his halberd, he unleashed a powerful strike directly at Miao Ye.

In a single breath, white light surged from the halberd, forming six sharp branches that materialized in the void, all aiming for Miao Ye's throat. The flowing brilliance swept away the crackling lightning around them, leaving nothing but sharp force in its wake.

Miao Ye, caught completely off guard by Tang Shedu's sudden intervention, inwardly cursed his misfortune. He raised one of the copper bowls in defense, letting it spin in midair while his other hand formed a fist. Pressing his thumb against his throat and spreading his other four fingers outward, he activated a secret technique.

This move revealed the depth of his background as a disciple of an ancient Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan. Drawing upon a nearby meridian point with his body, he channeled his mana and unleashed four bolts of lightning, barely managing to fend off the branches. He quickly retreated, forming seals as he moved.

However, the copper bowl in the air emitted a dull thud before being blasted backward at an even faster speed. The concentrated lightning it had gathered dissipated into scattered purple sparks. Tang Shedu's halberd, undeterred, flipped upward. The intricate patterns on the arm guards of his domineering armor shimmered, stinging Miao Ye's eyes as the halberd surged forward, aiming straight for his forehead.
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝓮𝒘𝙚𝙗𝒏𝙤𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝒐𝙢

Damn it! Such fierce halberd techniques, and he's gotten so close! Miao Ye thought frantically.

Unable to form seals in time, Miao Ye brought both copper bowls before him as a shield. He bit his tongue, spitting out a mouthful of blood that transformed into a bloody bolt of lightning aimed at the halberd.

The qi blade of the halberd, shorter than a spear yet wider and heavier, clashed against the bloody lightning in an instant.

Boom!

The bloody lightning barely lasted a moment before dissipating into glowing fragments. The twin copper bowls, trembling under the halberd's onslaught, barely managed to block the strike. A shockwave erupted in the air, sending ripples of force and streams of purple and white energy cascading outward, pushing the surrounding clouds far into the distance.

"Decisive enough," Tang Shedu remarked coldly, retracting his long halberd with ease and hovering midair.

Seeing this, Situ Chen, who had been watching from the side, exclaimed in shock, "The Long Sky Halberd, Tang Shedu!"

The man before him was a renowned and ruthless killer, a senior cultivator with a long-standing reputation. Situ Chen quickly clasped his hands together, transforming into a streak of crimson light that shot away like a meteor, leaving a long tail behind as he vanished into the sea of clouds.

Tang Shedu glanced at him with disdain, while Miao Ye, standing before him, was frantically forming hand seals and retreating step by step, his heart pounding in fear.

Miao Ye knew very well who he was facing. When Tang Shedu had roamed the world, Miao Ye had still been a minor cultivator in the Qi Cultivation Realm, yet even then, he had heard of Tang Shedu's fearsome reputation. Back in those days, only a select few, like Yang Tianya or Yu Yuxie, could rival him.

If this man had not hit a bottleneck... he would probably already have broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm by now. Damn it! How did I end up provoking someone like him? Miao Ye's thoughts were racing with terror.

After a single exchange, he realized he was no match for this opponent. No matter how hard he tried, he could, at best, delay the inevitable. Sooner or later, he would meet his end here. Desperately, he pleaded, "Senior... I have no intention of competing for this treasure. I am even willing to hand over all I have gained in this grotto heaven... I only beg that you spare my life!"

Tang Shedu looked intrigued and smiled faintly. "I have killed so many people over the years. Back then, the Thunder Techniques had not yet emerged, I never had the chance to kill a thunder cultivator with an Immortal Foundation. Killing you now would fill that gap nicely."

Tang Shedu's previous attack had sent Situ Chen fleeing in disgrace, and now Miao Ye was desperately begging for his life. Watching from above the clouds, Yu Muxian nodded silently to himself.

Although neither of them is weak, my senior brother's strength is undeniable. With his premeditated strike and sudden appearance, it's no wonder he managed to terrify these two. But if they were to truly engage in a life-and-death battle, it would probably take him a hundred or so rounds to kill Miao Ye.

He mused over whether Tang Shedu could indeed finish the fight within a hundred exchanges when, suddenly, a sharp pain shot through his ears. A piercing ringing sound filled his head, accompanied by a sense of foreboding.

"Hmm?" Yu Muxian frowned. A wave of panic began to rise in his chest, but it was quickly quelled by a surge of suppressive power that restored his calm. Quietly, he thought to himself, It seems... someone has come seeking their own death!




# Chapter 607: The Battle Begins

In the cloud sea, after an initial clash, each side had already gained some insight into their opponent's artifacts. There was no need for further concealment. Xiao Yongling revealed himself, chasing after the sword artifact and grasping it in his hand, silently moving closer.

Meanwhile, Tu Longjian moved with eerie stealth, somehow managing to get within three chi of Yu Muxian without being noticed. Wielding his golden hammer, he swung it ferociously toward Yu Muxian.

Yu Muxian tilted his shoulder slightly and shifted to a new hand gesture. Using his pinky's upper joint to represent You, its middle joint Xu, and its lower joint Hai, he formed a lotus-flower seal. Golden light flickered in his eyes as he seated himself midair.

Splash...

In an instant, a golden lotus bloomed in the sky, its layers of petals enclosing Yu Muxian within. He did not counterattack but instead maintained a steady defense, intending to hold out until Tang Shedu arrived to assist.

These three successive spells demonstrated his extraordinary talent. Not only could he wield numerous techniques with ease, but his ability to quickly discern the flow of spiritual energy and adjust his methods accordingly highlighted a combination of innate aptitude and rigorous training. This far outstripped the capabilities of those around him.

The Li Family cultivators lacked deep foundations, Xiao Yongling was a half-trained scion of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and Tu Longjian seemed incapable of invoking techniques to disrupt spiritual energy, leaving Yu Muxian free to manipulate it as he pleased.

However, Xiao Yongling was renowned as the Man on Mount Feather, he was no easy opponent to deal with. His sword flicked upward, tracing an elegant arc in the air, and his immortal foundation, Eastern Feather Mountain, surged to its full potential within him. As his lips parted, he exhaled a wisp of white mist.

The white mist scattered in the air, drilling downward with force, spinning and twirling. It froze the surrounding spiritual energy, gradually forming a vague outline of a massive mountain. Suspended mid-air, the mountain neither rose nor fell, standing still as if suppressing the spiritual energy around it.

However, the sword in his hand repeatedly slashed through the lotus-like petals before him, slicing through more than a dozen layers, but each strike felt as if it lacked substance. Even the sword seemed on the verge of being trapped. Xiao Yongling, not particularly adept in swordsmanship, hurriedly withdrew the blade.

Meanwhile, Tu Longjian's golden hammer had already reached him. Its gray flames exuded terrifying power, forcing Yu Muxian to use his six golden shields to block the flames. Even as the enemy advanced right to his face, Yu Muxian dared not recall the shields. Instead, he brought his two fingers together and pressed them toward the golden hammer.

At first glance, this action seemed suicidal, but Tu Longjian raised an eyebrow slightly, only to witness the golden hammer forcibly stopped in mid-air by Yu Muxian's maneuver. Tu Longjian's expression showed surprise as both his hands lit up.

Yu Muxian quickly withdrew his fingers, finding himself momentarily overwhelmed. The six golden shields retreated further and further, while the gray flames edged closer. Still, he hesitated to summon his spirit artifacts, thinking, If I release the two Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts now... they'll undoubtedly scare these people away. At most, I might injure one of them... That would be far too reckless.

Yu Muxian was determined not to leave any loose ends for himself. Since he had chosen to act, these two Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts must ensure that all of his foes were annihilated without exception.

Yu Muxian continued, Tu Longjian still carries one of the six jade boxes from the hall. Killing him now is just perfect!

Indeed, in the midst of this exchange, Tang Shedu had already erupted in fury. Abandoning the battle with Miao Ye, he turned back in a rage, his gaze cold and domineering as he roared, "Who dares harm my junior brother?!"

On the other side, Miao Ye, as though granted a pardon, knew full well that this chaotic battle was beyond his ability to meddle in. He had no intention of getting involved. Finally seizing a rare chance to escape, he wasted no time in abandoning the battlefield and fleeing at once.

Although Miao Ye harbored resentment toward Tang Shedu, he was shrewd and cautious, Given the current situation, even if those trying to harm Yu Muxian win, they'll likely silence me to tie up loose ends. And if they lose, I'd still die in the end. As for profiting from their battle—who doesn't have a hidden trump card? It's never that simple!

Making his decision swiftly, he fled into the distance. Tang Shedu, now free of his previous engagement, unleashed his halberd, its momentum overwhelming and exuding the aura of someone who had long been in the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm.

The earlier battle had already demonstrated to Tu Longjian and his allies that Tang Shedu's strength was astonishing. They all felt a sense of foreboding. Yu Muxian, however, smiled faintly, just about to speak when a buzzing sound suddenly rang in his ears.

"Hmm? Again?" Yu Muxian sneered. The spell above his head, Heavenly Golden Cymbal, rotated and floated in mid-air. He blinked a few times, then froze, Can't locate it? How is that possible?

From the moment of the ambush, Yu Muxian had meticulously maintained control over the battlefield, analyzing the logic of each move and assessing everyone's strength and intentions. But now, this unexpected development left him genuinely baffled.

The Heavenly Golden Cymbal was designed to detect incoming spells and artifacts, employing incredibly sophisticated techniques to avoid the stealth methods or concealed artifacts of his foes. Thus, it was impossible for Li Xuanfeng to be using any sort of concealment technique.

If he could attack from this far, why would he have stayed within detection range earlier and wasted his advantage? A flurry of thoughts flashed through Yu Muxian's mind, but he couldn't pinpoint where the attack was coming from. With Tang Shedu's halberd only a single step away and the buzzing sound in his ears growing louder, Yu Muxian felt a surge of unease.

A sense of danger welled up within him. Blood formed on the tip of his tongue, its metallic tang spreading in his mouth. Acting decisively, Yu Muxian made his move, "No more hiding!!"

He opened his mouth, spitting out a golden ring no thicker than a pinky finger but as large as a human head. The ring was inscribed with countless intricate runes. It hovered briefly, then began to rise into the sky.

"Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact—Binding Ring!" Yu Muxian shouted.

As soon as the golden ring appeared, the buzzing sound in Yu Muxian's ears vanished. Without any visible movement or golden rays striking out, a Profound Patterned Spirit Arrow appeared trapped within the ring.

The arrow seemed almost alive, struggling incessantly within the confines of the golden ring. It emitted the sharp clinking sounds of metal clashing, but despite its efforts, the disparity in power was insurmountable. The arrow could only whirl helplessly within the ring.

Seeing this artifact in action, the faces of everyone present changed. Tu Longjian narrowed his eyes slightly, thinking to himself, The first Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact is out—and it's a defensive artifact? This is going to be troublesome.

His spiritual sense flickered as he inwardly cursed at the token in his possession, You call yourself an ancient spirit artifact? Look at that modern spirit artifact—how formidable! If you continue to underperform, and something happens to my allies... how do you plan to handle it?!

Expressions shifted among the crowd, but Tang Shedu let out a breath of relief. He understood better than anyone how Daoist Master Yuanwu regarded this junior disciple of his. If Yu Muxian were harmed here, Tang Shedu would likely face severe consequences.

Yu Muxian, always calculating, had not discussed the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts with Tang Shedu on their way here. Tang Shedu was therefore pleasantly surprised, feeling a wave of cruel delight as he redirected his halberd toward Xiao Yongling.

Xiao Yongling glanced coldly at the golden ring. He recognized it immediately—it was clearly modeled after a certain artifact from years ago. He didn't have time to examine it closely, as he was forced to withdraw his sword and turn to defend himself. Hidden in his sleeve, his fingers clenched tightly around a jade hook.

Before their artifacts clashed, Tang Shedu's mocking voice rang out, "You are from the Xiao Family, hah! I bet you are quite familiar with the appearance of the Binding Ring, are you not? What are you called again? Man on Mount Feather or something... looks like you are destined to become the next Xiao Xianyou!"




# Chapter 609: The Battle Begins

On Tang Shedu's side, after more than ten close-quarters exchanges, Xiao Yongling had already vomited blood, relying solely on his mana to barely hold on. Tang Shedu, in contrast, seemed completely at ease, even occasionally casting glances around the battlefield.

When his gaze met Yu Muxian's, Tang Shedu realized that the fight could not be dragged out any longer. He reversed his halberd, which began to emit a dazzling white glow. Xiao Yongling's face shifted, his expression darkening. Tang Shedu cast him a cold glance and, at long last, raised the halberd high. A brilliant beam of light surged upward from the weapon.

"Playtime's over!" Tang Shedu declared.

As Tang Shedu's armor gleamed brightly, Xiao Yongling suddenly lifted his head. He neither dodged nor attempted to defend with his sword. Instead, he channeled his mana and pressed his hand against the jade hook hidden in his sleeve.

A verdant green glow rose, forming a barrier. At the same time, the sharp buzzing sound in Yu Muxian's ears intensified. Tu Longjian had already smashed all eight of Yu Muxian's artifacts aside and was now swinging his hammer directly at Yu Muxian's face.
𝗳𝐫𝚎𝗲𝚠𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝘃𝚎𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺

Alarm bells rang in Yu Muxian's mind. At last, he flicked his sleeve and threw something out.

Cloudsunder!

The object left only a faint white trace in the air before disappearing entirely. Opposite him, Tu Longjian let out a muffled groan as the bright flames on his hammer were extinguished in an instant. The hammer slipped from his grasp, falling to the ground.

Slash!

Tu Longjian's face turned pale as he stumbled back dozens of zhang. Only then did the sound of a blade piercing flesh echo through the air. He swallowed the blood rising in his throat, his spiritual sense flaring as he quickly took stock of the situation.

Floating in front of Yu Muxian was a short sword. It appeared unremarkable, small and rhomboid in shape, with two simple carvings etched onto its hilt. The weapon hovered lightly in the air.

Tu Longjian gasped for breath, while across from him, Yu Muxian hastily recalled the golden Binding Ring. The ring reluctantly retreated a mere two cun when a sudden series of booming sounds erupted.

Boom...

Yu Muxian's face paled slightly. The six circular shields surrounding him emitted a succession of sharp cracking sounds as the astral gold pierced through them, colliding against his feathered robe with a chorus of metallic clangs.

Just as he began to recover his composure, droplets of blood trickled down from his chin. His hands twitched uncontrollably, yet his spells and artifacts were being restrained, leaving him unable to respond. At last, a deep fear arose in his heart, and a single thought echoed in his mind, How...

Then he had a sudden epiphany, I miscalculated! This grotto heaven has another layer below!

In that instant, the weapons in everyone's hands began to hum in unison. The sea of clouds around them retreated like the ebbing tide. The Eastern Feather Mountain, which Xiao Yongling had used to suppress the battlefield, disintegrated into smoke and ash. The Merging Fire dissipated, and the Binding Ring trembled violently.

Buzz...

Everyone felt a sharp pain in their ears, blood trickling from them as a pillar of golden light shot up from beneath the sea of clouds.

Buzz... buzz... buzz...

When the golden light appeared within their line of sight, it had already reached the heavens and disappeared into the boundless night sky. The cultivators within the grotto heaven raised their heads in shock, staring at the radiant beam with disbelief.

Yu Muxian stood silently in midair. Charred talismans, reduced to ashes, floated around him like falling dust.

In front of him, five or six shield spells shimmered faintly. Each was riddled with cracks and bore a perfectly round hole at its center. As though suddenly realizing their state, the shields dissipated into streams of white light and scattered into the air.

Yu Muxian's feathered robe drifted down like willow fluff, revealing the thin underlayer beneath. A circular hole had been burned through his chest, with the golden light piercing his abdomen and exiting through the back of his neck.

The wound was bloodless, and through the hole, the glittering stars of the night sky were clearly visible. His prominent nose, handsome features, and slender body were all riddled with small, gaping holes, like the mouths of infants opening and closing. Faint patterns of formation inscriptions were etched across his exposed skin.

"Junior Brother!!" Tang Shedu let out a heart-wrenching roar. He had barely taken a step back when the emerald-green glow that had previously shielded Xiao Yongling flared up once more. The defensive light turned to offense, surging toward Tang Shedu with unstoppable force.

The golden light continued to radiate its brilliance, blindingly dazzling and overwhelming, causing those present to feel as though they were being flayed alive. Their six senses faltered. Tu Longjian froze momentarily, stunned. Meanwhile, Yu Muxian abruptly came to a halt, his body suddenly suffused with a faint white glow.

Yu Muxian's eyes snapped open. His pupils, now split into four segments, bled profusely, and streaks of blood dripped from his face. A glowing array emerged at the center of his brow, and his lips curved into a faint smirk.

His cautious nature and years of seclusion, spent regarding Yuanwu as a potential adversary, had ultimately saved his life. He had meticulously engraved dozens of Foundation Establishment Realm talismans into his chest, crafting layered arrays over the years, all to survive a moment of life-and-death crisis.

Unexpectedly, this attack had not been spent against Yuanwu, but even so, it had saved his life in this desperate moment. At the critical juncture, the accumulated power of dozens of talismans activated simultaneously, absorbing and weakening the golden beam just enough for Yu Muxian to survive.

His body screamed with intense pain, but Yu Muxian, long accustomed to the sensation of his meridians being sliced through daily, barely registered the agony. With the jade buckle reinforcing him and several precious pills swiftly consumed, he shed tears of blood as he coldly observed his surroundings.

Yu Muxian's body began to mend itself, the gaping holes slowly closing as if made of soft mud. His segmented pupils merged back into one, and streaks of luminous energy surged from the Shenyang Mansion within his body. Four talismans shot out from his sleeve, transforming into glowing shields that enveloped him protectively.

Though outwardly calm, blood qi was mixed in his mana, and his body was as fragile as porcelain. Tang Shedu, clad in resplendent golden armor, stood before him with visible regret, his halberd held horizontally in a defensive stance.

Yu Muxian, however, showed no gratitude. His voice was icy as he spoke, "Senior Brother, have you played enough? If I die here, I wonder how Master will torment you."

Tang Shedu, who had always been domineering outside, broke into a cold sweat at those words. Hastily, he pulled several talismans from his storage pouch and handed them to Yu Muxian, his face etched with pale vein lines. He stood solemnly, staring at the opposing group with renewed vigilance.

Buzz... buzz... buzz...

Several streaks of golden light shot through the air, but all were swiftly captured by the Binding Ring, where they clanged sharply as they struck its inner walls. Amid the tense stalemate, the sound seemed especially jarring.

Xiao Yongling, the most fatigued among them, appeared pale, having suffered severe injuries to hold back Tang Shedu. Tu Longjian, his face dark, clutched at a wound on his abdomen, silently deliberating something.

Yu Muxian surveyed the scene, realizing that the immediate crisis had passed. Yet his cautious nature kept him on edge. Despite the layers of Foundation Establishment Realm shields protecting him, he still gripped several talismans tightly, ready to activate them at a moment's notice—until he froze.

Just three chi to his side, the clouds and mist suddenly parted. A middle-aged man stood there silently, his sword resting against his chest. The green and white glow emanating from the blade was so intense it seemed ready to drip from the weapon at any moment.

Yu Muxian's scream barely reached his throat before the middle-aged man drew his sword.

A gentle breeze swept through the heavens and earth. Xiao Yongling's treasured sword, hanging at his waist, began to tremble with metallic clangs, as though about to leap from its scabbard in excitement.

Throughout the grotto heaven—on mountaintops, amidst the clouds, and within grand halls—the swords at countless cultivators' waists vibrated in unison, chiming as though eager to be unsheathed. These cultivators, startled, raised their heads in wonder.

Amidst the layers of pale gray mist in the grotto heaven, a crescent of green-white light rose.




# Chapter 613: Exiting the Grotto Heaven

Li Yuexiang kneeled at the front, overcome with sobs. Li Xijun stood silently in the courtyard, the Hanlin Sword at his waist emitting a faint glow. His eyes were rimmed with red, and his gaze lingered on the fragments of shattered jade scattered across the ground.

A flood of thoughts coursed through Li Xijun's mind, one after another, each slipping away before he could grasp them. Amidst the turmoil, the image of Li Xuanxuan's aged face surfaced vividly before his eyes.

The lamps within the ancestral hall flickered dimly. Li Yuexiang's quiet sobs echoed faintly in the still air as a gentle breeze drifted through the hall. Li Xijun's expression grew increasingly complex. He took a step back, then turned and exited the ancestral hall. Outside, the rain continued to fall, its steady rhythm pooling into streams at his feet.

Li Xijun rose into the air, carried by the wind, and landed before the Alchemy Pavilion. With his hands tucked into his sleeves, he stepped onto the stone stairs.

The courtyard was deserted and shrouded in shadows. The only light came from the furnace fire inside the grand hall, casting flickering shadows that danced across the floor. Inside, Li Ximing sat upright before the alchemy furnace, his hands forming seals as he focused intently. He lifted his gaze as Li Xijun entered.

Li Xijun waved a hand, saying nothing. He waited in silence until Li Ximing completed his pill refinement, extinguished the furnace, and tidied up his tools. Only then did he take a step forward.

"The life jade of Second Uncle has shattered," Li Xijun said softly.

Li Ximing, still immersed in his study of the alchemy formula, froze in an instant. He raised his head with disbelief etched across his face, his voice trembling as he cried out, "This… how… what happened?!"

Li Xijun covered his face with one hand and stepped back. As he departed, he heard Li Ximing's distraught voice behind him. Looking up slightly, he saw the lights on Talisman Peak flickering faintly in the distance.

Night had deepened, and Li Xuanxuan had not yet retired for rest. Li Xijun found himself almost unable to face the old man, unable to tell him that his last surviving son had also perished in service to the clan.
𝘧𝘳𝘦ℯ𝓌𝘦𝒷𝘯𝑜𝑣𝘦𝓁.𝒸𝘰𝓂

"Delay it for now… just delay it… perhaps there is still hope," Li Xijun murmured to himself.

————

Green Pine Island.

Compared to the controlled skirmishes in most areas of the grotto heaven, the fighting on Green Pine Island was chaotic and disorganized. Rogue cultivators clashed in a frenzied melee, killing and plundering one another.

Li Qinghong flew along the island's edge, wielding her spear. Her jade armor shimmered, deflecting the splattering blood, while violet lightning crackled around her, causing the seawater below to surge and rise as white mist.

The sea ahead churned violently. From the void, an object fell—a small, glossy black stone, no larger than a fingernail. It floated silently in the air, immediately drawing the attention of several cultivators.

Li Qinghong's spear erupted with lightning as she stepped forward decisively. With a sweeping motion, she forced back the surrounding cultivators, snatched the newly emerged spirit item, and swiftly stored it in her pouch before retreating.

Having recently advanced to mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Qinghong's strength ranked among the top of the cultivators present. Her repeated successes had already attracted envious gazes. Sensing several individuals considering an alliance against her, she assessed her surroundings carefully.

Though unafraid, Li Qinghong understood the wisdom of withdrawing at the right moment. Guiding her lightning, she retreated steadily until she reached the edge of Green Pine Island's waters. Only then did the figures in the sky begin to thin out.

She had initially partnered with the Han Family of Dongliu Island, planning her moves carefully. Yet the winds of fate were ever-changing. As spiritual energy grew unstable and various spirit items emerged, the group was scattered in an instant, each person scrambling to seize treasures. Before long, she lost sight of the Han Family members.

This area, where the grotto heaven overlapped with the mundane world, was filled with peculiar gray clouds that hindered spiritual senses. Unable to locate the Han Family, Li Qinghong managed to rescue a few junior Han Family disciples within her reach, but after collecting a substantial haul of treasures, she quickly left.

The inability to coordinate with the Han Family was no great loss for Li Qinghong. Being stronger, she was confident in her ability to harvest rewards on her own with the help of her immortal mirror. Without needing to share the spoils, she even found herself enjoying the independence.

Adjusting her hair, she landed on a reef and immersed her spiritual sense into her mirror to assess her surroundings.

Before she could make sense of her environment, a flickering green light emerged from the void. It wavered erratically within her mirror's view before shedding its radiance to reveal an unassuming talisman seed that lingered faintly.

Li Qinghong's grip on her spear tightened, her knuckles turning white. She stood frozen in place for a long time before abruptly taking flight, heading toward the small island where Li Xuanfeng had entered the grotto heaven.

The island was barren, with no signs of life or traces of battle. Li Qinghong stood there briefly, wiping at the corners of her eyes as she thought to herself, If Brother is in trouble, Second Uncle likely isn't faring well either. I don't know what's happening in this grotto heaven, but it's best to wait here for him. If he's injured, I can at least provide some support...

————

As Li Yuanjiao died, his Immortal Foundation dissipated, and the power of the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact swept forth. Li Yuanjiao's body gradually faded in Li Xuanfeng's hands, dissolving into rain that fell softly to the ground.

Li Xuanfeng found his hands empty, save for a longsword, a jade bottle, and a simple black-patterned storage pouch.

He attached these three items to his waist. Retrieving a jade box from the storage pouch, he murmured under his breath. The green rain in the sky immediately began to gather, pouring into the box and forming a pool of green-gray spirit water that swirled gently within.

The anomalies of the grotto heaven faded like a fleeting breath. The pale green rain lingered briefly before dissipating, leaving only the dispersing gray clouds.

It was common for a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's body to return to the heavens and earth upon death. In Jiangnan, it was customary to use the remaining spirit items to represent the deceased in burial rites. Xiao Yongling stood silently nearby, hands clasped behind his back, watching as Li Xuanfeng carefully stowed the jade box.

The blood on Li Xuanfeng's hands had finally stopped flowing. He attached the Qingche Sword to his waist and stood still for a moment, lost in thought. Then, taking flight, he descended to a mountain ridge where Yu Muxian's corpse lay.

Yu Muxian, having perished from the slash, had his body shattered into two halves from the fall. Fine, sharp golden needles, like pine needles, seeped from his shattered meridians, scattering glittering fragments across the ground.

The once otherworldly face of Yu Muxian now resembled a fish carved apart by a thousand blades, exposing raw flesh beneath. His mutilated eyes, still slightly open, reflected lingering confusion. His bloodstained lips hung ajar.

Beside his wrist lay a small white jade buckle, smooth and pristine, untouched by the blood that stained everything else.

Yu Muxian's feathered robe, pierced twice during the battle, had been shredded to tatters. Within the remains of its sleeve lay a pale purple circular object—a hidden trump card that, even in death, he had never managed to use.

Li Xuanfeng waved his sleeve, gathering the shredded feathered robe along with the jade buckle. He then used his mana to retrieve Yu Muxian's storage pouch and probed it with his spiritual sense, finding it tightly sealed.

Removing the robe, Li Xuanfeng saw Yu Muxian's abdomen faintly rising and falling, streaked with blood.

Pop…

A muffled sound echoed from Yu Muxian's abdomen. As the Molten Metal Cave dissipated, several dharma artifacts flew out from his body one after another, bouncing into the pool of blood and wobbling slightly.

The artifacts ranged from the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm to Foundation Establishment Realm, none particularly outstanding. However, the six shields and eight golden shuttles stood out as a matched set of artifacts, making them exceptionally valuable.

From the distance came the sound of clanging metal as Tu Longjian, clad in black, descended slowly. The black-and-red token beside him was suppressing a golden ring, causing it to tremble violently in midair, glowing red-hot as it burned.

"Cloudsunder has slipped away. I have lost its trail," he murmured.

Li Xuanfeng's expression remained impassive as he handed over Yu Muxian's storage pouch, speaking in a hoarse voice, "Many thanks for your tireless assistance. Here is this man's storage pouch—it has not been opened."

Tu Longjian hesitated briefly before opening the storage pouch. The Six Ding Merging Fire rose from within as he casually wiped away the seals and traps on the pouch.

Still nursing the wound on his abdomen, Tu Longjian didn't hold back, taking out valuable medicinal pills and elixirs for himself. He also removed a few healing salves, which he applied to Li Xuanfeng's injuries.

Yu Muxian's possessions were indeed of high quality. Li Xuanfeng's wounds began to heal visibly, the torn flesh knitting itself back together. Although the injuries on his hands remained, they were far less ghastly than before.

Tu Longjian rummaged through the storage pouch, retrieving a jade box, which he kept for himself, along with several other items. He then returned the storage pouch to Li Xuanfeng, who handed it to Xiao Yongling, saying softly: "Thank you, Senior. Please take a few items as compensation."

Xiao Yongling looked at him silently before hesitating slightly. He picked up two artifacts from the ground before glancing through the storage pouch. Meanwhile, Tu Longjian remarked softly, "Senior, there is still something of yours in that golden ring."

Tu Longjian intensified the flames, and after a few breaths, the two Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts ceased their battle. The Binding Ring let out a puff of black smoke, spitting out a small golden orb.

Li Xuanfeng caught a glimpse of it and suddenly recalled that the first arrow he had fired had been absorbed by the golden ring. After being worn down by the spirit artifact, tempered by the Merging Fire and Molten Fire, and subjected to various spells, it had been refined into its current state.

Xiao Yongling reached out to catch it. Returning the storage pouch to Li Xuanfeng, he also took out a gleaming golden halberd and offered it with both hands, saying softly, "The halberd that Tang Shedu coveted… it is now returned to its rightful owner."

This halberd had originated in the ancient Wei State, and calling it a rightful return was not far-fetched. Li Xuanfeng accepted it on behalf of the Li Family, giving the storage pouch only a brief glance. He left its contents untouched but instead displayed a pale purple circular object and asked, "Is this a Purple Mansion Realm talisman?"

Seeing the two nod, Li Xuanfeng replied, "I hope to use this talisman to stabilize my clan's fortunes. I will take nothing else from this pouch."

Pushing the storage pouch forward, he added, "This pouch itself… is something I cannot keep."

The storage pouch was indeed a dangerous item to hold. Tu Longjian nodded slightly and said softly, "Leave it to me."

The group divided the artifacts and found a mountain peak to rest on, silently meditating as they waited for the grotto heaven to close.

Within the grotto heaven, there was no cycle of day and night. Li Xuanfeng and the others meditated for several days, each recovering somewhat before finally opening their eyes.

Although the three sat quietly atop the mountain, none of them appeared at ease. The development of events had clearly diverged from Tu Longjian's expectations, leaving him hesitant to speak. At last, a rumbling sound echoed across the heavens, and the clouds surged like tidal waves. Tu Longjian said, "Honored Seniors, I still have pressing matters to attend to and cannot accompany you to the boundary. Please forgive me."

Li Xuanfeng and Xiao Yongling understood that Tu Longjian leaving so openly would undoubtedly lead him to the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' hands. They bid him farewell nonetheless.

Tu Longjian hesitated for a moment before responding, "I deeply regret what happened to Senior Yuanjiao. If I manage to survive and establish myself in the Eastern Sea, I will rebuild the Slaughter Jun Gate. One day, I will come to visit and exchange techniques to revive the Slaughter Jun Dao Lineage."

Li Xuanfeng did not fully understand what connection his family had with the Slaughter Jun Gate, assuming this was Tu Longjian's reason for assisting them. Accepting the pledge on behalf of his family, he replied solemnly, "I am not clear on the details. Perhaps this was Yuanjiao's personal connection. However, the younger generation of my clan will remember your name and welcome you warmly."
𝓯𝓻𝒆𝙚𝒘𝓮𝙗𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝒍.𝙘𝓸𝙢

Tu Longjian nodded, offered two words of condolence, and departed. Riding a fiery red streak of light, he vanished like a whirlwind into the horizon, sinking deep into the sea of clouds and disappearing from sight.

The two remaining figures rose into the air on the wind, only to find their surroundings gradually fading. The stars in the sky receded swiftly into the distance. Xiao Yongling waited for a moment before finally speaking softly, "My condolences…"

Li Xuanfeng waved a hand, the grief in his eyes flickering for only a moment before being replaced by deep restraint. Xiao Yongling observed his face carefully and spoke quietly, "Back during the slaughter in Lixia Prefecture, you and Ruyu pursued and executed members of the Situ Family in the name of justice. It all feels like yesterday. Decades have passed, and you seem so much different now."

Li Xuanfeng lowered his gaze and replied, "What happened back then is like a bronze mirror sinking into water, dulled and worn down by sand and stone. Even if I revisit it, it remains hazy and unclear. Thinking of it now feels like recalling a past life—impossible to relive."

Xiao Yongling paused, unsure of how to respond. After a moment, he said softly, "Back then, I thought you were too sharp, that Ruyu was bound to be hurt by your brilliance. I even considered mentioning it to Tongya. But looking at you now, it is clear you surpassed Ruyu in every way. It seems I underestimated you and made a fool of myself."

Li Xuanfeng shook his head deeply, uninterested in continuing the conversation. Just as he was about to respond with some polite remarks, Xiao Yongling suddenly vanished. From head to toe, he disappeared completely, as did the stars, clouds, and mountains, which all faded away into the distance.

"The grotto heaven is closing!" Li Xuanfeng raised his gaze, finding himself surrounded entirely by the deep blue sea.

Beneath him were the same island and rocky shore from when he first entered. The formation he had set up at the beginning still glimmered faintly. Nearby, Lin Chensheng stood in black robes, clutching his chest. Crimson blood dripped steadily from between his fingers.

On the other side, Kan Ziyu collapsed to the ground with a thud. Sitting cross-legged, she immediately began meditating to recover. Li Xuanfeng scanned the island with his spiritual sense but found no trace of Zhong Qian. He surmised that Zhong Qian had likely met a grim fate—if not within the grotto heaven, then perhaps already in the hands of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

Although Zhong Qian was absent, Li Xuanfeng saw a familiar figure nearby. Dressed in jade armor and holding a spear, her eyes rimmed with red, Li Qinghong stood there, staring intently at his hands.

"Qinghong!" Li Xuanfeng called out.

Li Qinghong nodded firmly, her throat tight with emotion. Uncertain of the situation, she dared not say much and choked out a brief response. Li Xuanfeng, having killed Yu Muxian, had no desire to linger. Bowing slightly with a cupped fist toward Lin Chensheng, he ascended on the wind and sped toward the marketplace on Splitreed Island.

As he took flight, Li Xuanfeng suddenly froze. The great void before him split open, trembling violently. From the rift stepped a man clad in platinum armor, his familiar halberd pointing directly at Li Xuanfeng. Behind the man stood an elder clad in green robes.

The elder's hair was white as a crane's feathers, yet his face was youthful. His nose was high and straight, and his eyes were etched with golden patterns. Behind him, a long, slender object rested silently. Standing in midair, the elder radiated a quiet but commanding presence. Beside him, a golden short sword hovered, buzzing sharply with its tip aimed directly at Li Xuanfeng.

The sword vibrated with a ringing hum, as though identifying its target. In the elder's other hand was a familiar golden ring, spinning slowly as it emitted a faint, whooshing sound, almost as if it were aggrieved.

Tang Shedu's aura was weak, his armor battered and fragmented, and his halberd bore two deep scars. His face, pale as gold paper, was far more haggard than when he had fled. In a hoarse voice, he said, "Daoist Master, it is him!"




# Chapter 615: The Subtle Wonders of Profound Patterns

Daoist Master Yuanwu! Li Xuanfeng's heart sank abruptly. Yet, he noticed that Tang Shedu's expression lacked the arrogance and brazenness he had expected. Instead, Tang Shedu appeared somewhat apprehensive, his head slightly lowered as if he didn't dare to meet anyone's gaze.

Similarly, Daoist Master Yuanwu did not make a move. His golden-patterned eyes remained fixed on something behind Li Xuanfeng, smoldering with restrained anger. The oppressive atmosphere felt heavy enough to drip water.

Sure enough, a gentle breeze swept past, and a figure clad in green robes stepped forward, stopping in front of Li Xuanfeng. The man crossed his arms over his chest, a faintly swaying pale gold jade seal at his waist. His tone was lighthearted as he spoke, "Senior Brother, it has been a long time."

This man was none other than Daoist Master Yuan Su, Ning Tiaoxiao. It was clear that Daoist Master Yuanwu had already learned of his disciple's death and had come seeking retribution as soon as Tang Shedu exited the grotto heaven. Equally prepared, Ning Tiaoxiao had anticipated Yuanwu's arrival and was already waiting here.

"Tiaoxiao, He killed my disciple," Daoist Master Yuanwu's cold gaze swept forward, yet it was blocked by the presence of Yuan Su.

Li Xuanfeng understood that he should not meet Yuanwu's gaze and followed Tang Shedu's lead, bowing his head low. Yuan Su, standing in front of him, simply smiled, "Senior Brother, you exaggerate! It is just one disciple. You have plenty more. It was merely a misunderstanding—our juniors fought over treasures, and in the heat of the moment, someone struck too hard... Surely, you would not have allowed Yu Muxian to reach the Purple Mansion Realm anyway. He did not have long to live, so what is the harm in compensating with some spirit artifacts to settle this matter?"

Yuanwu's face darkened further as he responded in a low tone, "He was no ordinary disciple!"

Yuan Su, appearing to know more than he let on, chuckled nonchalantly and casually remarked, "His talent was indeed remarkable."

"Ning Tiaoxiao! Yu Muxian carried many secrets, perhaps even some profound opportunities. By killing him, these people have ruined my plans!" Yuanwu's icy voice rose as the two spirit artifacts by his side began to spin rapidly.

However, Yuan Su stood his ground, meeting Yuanwu's gaze head-on and countering bluntly, "What secrets could he possibly have? Senior Brother, do not let yourself be deceived by tricks."

The atmosphere was tense, as if a drawn sword hung in the air. The sea churned with low rumbling sounds, splitting apart like receding tides. On one side, the water boiled into a pale blue froth, while on the other, it remained golden and calm, smooth as a mirror.

The divine abilities of the two Daoist Masters collided subtly in the air, growing increasingly fierce. On the nearby island, Lin Chensheng and Kan Ziyu's expressions turned pale. Without hesitation, they flew into the water to escape, not even taking time to tend to their injuries, desperately fleeing for their lives.

Just then, two more figures emerged from the great void. At the forefront was a Daoist Master wearing a dark-blue robe, his white hair flowing as he traversed the air with a calm demeanor.

The confrontation between the two Daoist Masters immediately paused as they turned to the newcomers. Daoist Master Yuanwu glanced at the lead figure and spoke in a low voice, "Xiao Chuting?"

Xiao Chuting's sudden arrival disrupted the stalemate. He stepped forward with a faint smile and addressed Daoist Master Yuanwu, "It has been so many years. It is rare to meet you, Senior."

Daoist Master Yuanwu's expression darkened as he cast a quick glance at both Xiao Chuting and Yuan Su.

Xiao Chuting, speaking softly, said, "I am here to offer my apologies... My family's junior acted impulsively and caused the death of a disciple of the Azure Pond Sect. Now that the killer has paid with their life, I suppose this resolves the grievance."

Daoist Master Yuan Su, playing with his jade seal, casually added, "Yes, yes. Senior Brother, you have always been fond of Auric Stones. I will send some your way. Let us not waste any more time here!"

With this, Yuanwu was given a graceful exit. His expression softened slightly, though resentment still lingered as he thought of Li Yuanjiao's death. He had nowhere to vent his anger, but more importantly, suspicions gnawed at his heart.

Yuanwu was convinced that Yu Muxian harbored many secrets. Now, with such an abrupt and inconclusive death, he couldn't help but suspect, Could it be... that the boy staged his death to escape me? But in the great void... it's about to begin, I can't afford any delays.
𝐟𝚛𝕖𝚎𝕨𝗲𝐛𝚗𝐨𝐯𝐞𝕝.𝐜𝗼𝗺

Doubt clouded his mind, and his face remained grim. He spoke in a low voice, "Since the two of you have said so, I will visit in a few days to discuss compensation."

Xiao Chuting and Yuan Su seemed to have anticipated his concession. Watching him leave, they cupped their fists politely to each other before parting ways too. Yuan Su turned back to Li Xuanfeng and instructed lightly, "We are heading into the Great Void for a gathering. This matter is not over yet. Stay put, settle your family affairs, and return to guard the southern border within three months."

Without waiting for Li Xuanfeng's response, Yuan Su flicked his robe and vanished.

The world fell silent. Only the pristine blue sea and bright sky remained, tranquil and serene as if the intense confrontation had never taken place.

After the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters had all departed, Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong finally let out sighs of relief and took to the skies. Li Xuanfeng felt utterly exhausted, so much so that he didn't even have the energy to respond to his niece's questions.

The two flew through the air until they reached the edge of Lake Xian. There, Li Xuanfeng nearly collapsed from the sky, forcing him to land and sit cross-legged to meditate and recover.

Li Qinghong stood guard by his side, ensuring his safety. She took out the relics her uncle had given her earlier.

Not daring to open the jade box, she held it in her arms for a while before carefully setting it aside. Then, she retrieved a jade bottle tied to her belt—one of Li Yuanjiao's belongings—and examined it closely.

"This must be the Foundation Establishment Realm artifact, the Profound Patterned Bottle..." she murmured.

Thinking of its name, her lips trembled, and she let out a quiet sob.

The small bottle was no wider than two fingers, simple yet elegant, adorned with dark silver profound patterns. Li Qinghong hesitated for a moment before injecting her true essence into it.

The inscriptions on the bottle lit up one by one, visibly shimmering with silver radiance. To her amazement, the patterns shifted and transformed, changing from cloud-like designs into jagged thunderbolts, as though fractured with cracks.

The bottle, having lost its previous owner, was quickly refined by her. Its surface glowed as streaks of black lightning surged forth.

"What?" she exclaimed.

The moment the lightning appeared, Li Qinghong instinctively suppressed it. She glanced worriedly toward the stone cave where Li Xuanfeng meditated, then distanced herself to study the artifact further.

The dark purple inscriptions and the bottle's silver base emitted a dense black cloud, which rose into the sky and spread out, forming a thundercloud. Lightning crackled from within, striking the ground violently.

"Not bad... At least it could hinder a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator," she thought, analyzing its potential. Turning the bottle upside down, she let it float mid-air.

Boom!

Thunder roared. The bottle unleashed a torrent of purple lightning bolts, spiraling out with tremendous force. They struck the mountainside, leaving charred marks in their wake.

"This is much stronger! Nearly equivalent to a full-strength strike from an early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator!" she surmised.

Having seen her elder brother use this artifact many times, she quickly grasped its essence. "This artifact is far more intricate than it appears. Perhaps its effects vary depending on the cultivator's immortal foundation... Truly an ancient artifact! Fascinating!" she concluded.

Her spiritual sense swept over the bottom of the bottle, revealing a series of small characters etched into its base, "Li Qianyuan of the Wei State's Li Clan."

Li Qinghong silently put the artifact away. Suddenly, the formation at the entrance of the stone cave dissolved, and Li Xuanfeng emerged. His black gold armor gleamed under the light, and his complexion looked much better than before. He glanced at the bottle hanging from her belt and asked softly, "How is it?"




# Chapter 616: Rising Yang Meets The Rainbow

"Elder Brother's artifact has some peculiarities." Li Qinghong handed over the jade bottle, presenting it briefly before removing her own mana and spiritual sense. She then passed it to Li Xuanfeng, allowing him to infuse it with his own essence.

The surface of the bottle shimmered with golden brilliance, releasing a bright golden mist that danced and leaped across Li Xuanfeng's fingertips. He lowered his gaze to inspect it for a moment before replying, "An artifact from the ancient Wei State. It might have belonged to the Bright Yang. Bring it back to the family and let the juniors test it—perhaps it may reveal different effects."

The two ascended into the skies, riding the wind. As they flew over rivers and shifting landscapes below, Li Xuanfeng's thoughts drifted to the lake. Suddenly, he turned back and asked, "I have heard that my elder brother's inner demons have plagued him, leaving his Dao Heart unstable. Is this true?"

Li Qinghong nodded slightly, seemingly anticipating his line of thought. Sure enough, Li Xuanfeng calculated something with his fingers before asking again, "Did my elder brother later have any other children?"

"He did not," Li Qinghong replied softly. "There have been no more descendants. Those mortal kin of ours... they all passed away some years ago."

Li Xuanfeng spoke hoarsely, "Elder Brother... the loss of his last child in the grotto heaven must be leaving him in unbearable agony."

The two flew in silence, the atmosphere heavy with grief. The sky alternated between light and shadow as time passed. Eventually, they reached the lakeside. Torrential rain poured down, drenching the landscape. Mount Qingdu stood solemnly amidst the storm. As Li Xuanfeng had never returned after leaving, his imprint was absent from the mountain's formations. Thus, Li Qinghong activated the formation, allowing them to land on the peak together.

Once within the mountain's protective barrier, Li Qinghong respectfully handed the Immortal Mirror back to Li Xuanfeng. He accepted it with both hands, and the two proceeded forward together.

By the stone steps on the mountainside stood a young girl. She was dressed in a white gown, her phoenix-shaped almond eyes radiating a quiet beauty. Li Qinghong spoke gently, "This is elder brother's surviving child."

Li Xuanfeng nodded silently, watching as Li Qinghong took the girl's hand. He stepped forward on the somewhat unfamiliar stone steps, his voice soft as he said, "I will head to the ancestral shrine first, go and gather everyone."

Li Qinghong understood Li Xuanfeng's intention to return the Immortal Mirror and report his accomplishments. Leading Li Yuexiang away, she left him to ascend the path alone. Step by step, Li Xuanfeng approached the ancestral shrine, closing the heavy doors behind him and isolating himself from the outside world.

Inside, he bowed solemnly before a row of ancestral tablets, confirming with the Immortal Mirror that no Purple Mansion Realm experts were nearby. Only then did he open the door to the stone chamber and place the pale grayish-blue Immortal Mirror atop the mystical spirit altar. From his belongings, he retrieved the jade buckle.

In an instant, the pale grayish-blue Immortal Mirror lit up, trembling violently and emitting waves of dazzling white light.

A mist of moon-white hue surged forth, casting a luminous glow across the ground. In this light, clusters of complexly patterned osmanthus flowers bloomed, their golden-white blossoms drooping delicately with golden stamens, exuding a fragrant aroma. From the dim corners of the room, a few sprightly rabbits and toads leaped out, their movements lively and animated.

The scent of osmanthus flowers wafted through the air. Li Xuanfeng raised the jade buckle high in both hands, which began to emit a soft light.

He had already inspected the jade buckle earlier. Sweeping his spiritual sense over it revealed that it was made of ordinary jade. After Yu Muxian's death, it had shown no reactions—neither signs of acknowledging a new master nor changes in brightness.

But now, the jade buckle finally reacted. A stream of pure white light cascaded downward, entering the Immortal Mirror and vanishing within. The pale grayish-blue mirror surface glowed intensely, transforming into a brilliant, radiant white.

————

Within the Mirror World.

Lu Jiangxian sat cross-legged, slowly absorbing the feedback from the talisman seed. Li Yuanjiao's cultivation, while not exceptionally deep, had been the first mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm talisman seed, far superior to the previous ones.

Lu Jiangxian had always been satisfied with and confident in Li Yuanjiao. The way he exchanged his life for Yu Muxian's death and the jade buckle revealed subtle layers of calculated deliberation. Not only did Lu Jiangxian comprehend it, but even those present, such as Li Xuanfeng and Xiao Yongling, could sense its meaning.

"Jiao dares not forget... Not many could have done better than you in fulfilling the promise to Li Tongya..."

Lu Jiangxian remained silent for a moment as scenes from the grotto heaven replayed in his mind like an unfolding animation. He watched as Li Yuanjiao reached the Three Drums Wall, entered the phantasm, and selected a technique to memorize.

The image froze on the final moment at the stone wall, where golden script floated across its surface. Lu Jiangxian's expression changed as his gaze fixated on the golden characters, True Insight Profound Method.

The four words seemed to carry a magnetic force, evoking countless thoughts in his mind. What truly shocked him was not the golden text of the scripture's principles but the very existence of these four characters.

Lu Jiangxian had not seen this particular script for more than ninety years.

"Seal Script..." The words were unmistakably written in the ancient style of his past life, the Small Seal Script.

The golden characters leaped from his memory, emerging from his pupils and hovering in the Mirror World's space. Lu Jiangxian remained seated at the center, his gaze growing brighter as the characters circled around him.
𝓯𝓻𝓮𝙚𝙬𝓮𝙗𝒏𝙤𝒗𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝒐𝓶

He remembered.

It was not a matter of learning or reading anew but of memories surging forth from deep within. Perhaps he had studied this scripture hundreds or even thousands of times before. Now, with sudden clarity, he recalled it all.

The True Insight Profound Method was originally named The Liangzhi Path of Radiant Truth and Supreme Enlightenment Sutra. It was an ancient method for cultivators to refine their nature, extend their lifespan, and ascend to immortality. In Lu Jiangxian's memories, he had already perfected it to its ultimate form.

Lu Jiangxian slowly opened his eyes, and his entire demeanor had completely transformed. He gently raised his hand, palm facing upward, and the Bright Yang Metallic Essence, resembling a radiant cone of light, emerged in his grasp.

Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence!

"Ah... So this is the nature of the Metallic Essence! Life and essence are intertwined, and the Metallic Essence and thread of fate are fundamentally one!" Countless revelations surged within his heart, yet he found himself unable to articulate them. Overwhelmed with joy, tears fell from his eyes as he muttered, "No wonder a Golden Core rebirth ties itself to a thread of fate... The Metallic Essence, when activated, naturally forges one's fate!"

The Metallic Essence in his hand had undergone a fundamental change compared to before. No longer inert, it now swirled warmly in his palm. Interlocking his index and middle fingers, he gently tapped the essence with his thumb, causing it to emit an even brighter radiance.

In an instant, Lu Jiangxian's robes transformed into garments of dazzling golden splendor, surrounded by rings of colorful light. Streams of spiritual qi and flames cascaded like rain, dancing around him.

Golden embers resembling the Supreme Yang Splendor Flame, the explosive brilliance of the Six Yang Radiance, and the luminous patterns of the Golden Yang Radiant Origin emerged around him, merging, fading, and evolving.

Though he had yet to claim the jade buckle, Lu Jiangxian's heart brimmed with indescribable joy. He whispered, "The greatest treasure of this journey is, without doubt, the True Insight Profound Method!"

Lu Jiangxian felt certain that with these immortal techniques, even if he unleashed the Bright Yang Essence into the world, no one could take it from him—unless the rightful owner of this Bright Yang Fruition descended in person.

To compare his former self, Lu Jiangxian mused, he had once been like a child holding a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact without the ability to wield it—perhaps only capable of using it to crack walnuts.

But now, he was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator well-versed in various spells. Not only could he harness the metallic essence's myriad wonders, but through its guidance, he could gain insight into countless truths of the world!

"What a pity... If I had a physical body, with just this Metallic Essence and the immortal techniques, I could reach Foundation Establishment Realm within three months and Purple Mansion Realm in six years..." Joy flickered in his brightened eyes as he muttered, "I wonder if there are other similar relics in this world. With just one glance, the rewards would be immeasurable!"

Suppressing his excitement, he silently reminded himself, "Caution... I must remain cautious. Though this Metallic Essence could make me a master strategist in this realm, I am still within the territory of the Golden Core Realm experts. I must tread carefully and proceed slowly."

As he pondered his plans, the murky glow in the sky gradually dispersed, casting down a ray of white light. Lu Jiangxian felt the gradual restoration of the mirror artifact's power. Though his anticipation for the jade buckle had diminished, his heart still stirred with some delight.

"Not only do I have three more talisman seeds, but the Supreme Yin Profound Light has also reached the power of the Purple Mansion Realm!" Lu Jiangxian's eyes gleamed faintly as he gauged the feedback from the world. Though he couldn't fully grasp the level of power associated with the Purple Mansion Realm, based on his past experiences, it likely meant that a direct strike could instantly kill a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

"The Supreme Yin Profound Light must not be used carelessly..." His gaze lingered on the Bright Yang Metallic Essence before him. With a slight thought, the essence shifted, transforming into a beam of light and manifesting a human face.

This face appeared resolute and commanding, with a high nose bridge and deep-set eyes radiating a dignified masculine charm. However, it was not brutish or aggressive, but rather an inspiring and enthralling presence.

His brows were broad and smooth, and his golden pupils glowed faintly under the shadow of his nose, exuding an air of dominance and cunning.

"Great Ancestor of Wei, Li Qianyuan..." The Bright Yang Essence, passed down through countless years, instinctively displayed the visage of its original owner first. Gradually, the face morphed into that of a pale, slender youth, then shifted rapidly through a series of faces—each belonging to ancient cultivators who had once interacted with the Metallic Essence.

Finally, the sequence slowed and settled on the youthful face of an inexperienced young man.

"Chu Yi." Lu Jiangxian studied the face intently, his gaze lingering on the brows and the bridge of the nose. "It truly is Chu Yi!"

But then, to his astonishment, the features began to overlap with the earlier face he had seen. He froze in place, his expression shifting to one of disbelief. Moments later, he exclaimed, "Li Qianyuan! Chu Yi is the reincarnation of Li Qianyuan! How can this be? This is impossible! How could Mount Luoxia..."

His words trailed off abruptly. With a change in his hand seals, the Metallic Essence began to shift once more. Lu Jiangxian carefully examined its patterns, discovering that over the past millennium, Li Qianyuan had reincarnated a staggering nineteen times.

The metallic essence in his hand slowly reverted to its original conical form, floating quietly in Lu Jiangxian's palm. He sat back down on the stone bench, his expression dark as he muttered, "Mount Luoxia... how ruthless Mount Luoxia is!"

Lu Jiangxian had long determined that the Bright Yang Fruition had an owner, but he had not realized that this person was still Li Qianyuan.

In hindsight, Li Qianyuan, as perhaps the first emperor to achieve mastery over the Bright Yang Essence, had single-handedly built the unprecedented centralized feudal state of the Great Wei. His actions, from Lu Jiangxian's current level of insight, ensured that as long as he lived, no one else could hope to touch the Bright Yang Fruition.

However, the True Monarchs of Mount Luoxia, desiring the Bright Yang for themselves, had to contend with the fact that a Golden Core Realm cultivator was nearly immortal in this world, capable of constant reincarnation. The only way to seize the Fruition Attainment was to repeatedly bring about Li Qianyuan's reincarnation and death. Each cycle of destruction and resurgence chipped away at his fate and divine abilities, inching the True Monarchs closer to their goal.

And yet, something had gone wrong with Li Qianyuan. He seemed to have lost his memories. With each reincarnation, he failed to recall his past lives, repeatedly falling into Mount Luoxia's grasp.

"Everyone thought Chu Yi bore a thread of fate, unrivaled in this world. They envied his ability to play among mortals, to return north to Mount Luoxia, and assumed he was merely a True Monarch toying with the world." Lu Jiangxian closed his eyes slightly and murmured, "Who would have thought... who could have imagined... that behind it all was a scheme using the states of Wu, Yue, and Zhao as pawns on a chessboard, corrupting the Bright Yang Fruition time and time again? I fear that with every cycle, multiple True Monarchs are watching from the Great Void."

"No wonder... Chu Yi, with fate upon him, was so unstoppable. Even when Bright Yang descended, the threads of fate scattered across a few lucky individuals, each one immensely formidable! This was precisely to exhaust his fate and divine abilities to the fullest!" Lu Jiangxian concluded, "What a ruthless Mount Luoxia!"

Lu Jiangxian exhaled lightly and quickly connected the dots to the collapse of the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven.

"When control over the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment reached a certain level, they first caused the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven of the Cui Family to fall. This led to the emergence of numerous Bright Yang Dao Lineage across the land and overseas... Why deliberately allow these inheritances to flow out?" He lowered his gaze to the small strand of Metallic Essence suspended in his hand.

Although Lu Jiangxian had gained some profound insights into the nature of Metallic Essence and fate through immortal techniques, his understanding of Fruition Attainments remained limited. He could only speculate, "On the surface, it looks like compensation for various sects... but considering their usual practice of strictly sealing techniques and my earlier deductions, this cannot be so simple! This suggests... Mount Luoxia hopes to see Bright Yang cultivators arise both on the mainland and beyond the seas, likely as part of their larger plan..."

The next moment, Lu Jiangxian suddenly recalled the sight of the five True Monarchs gathered around Green Pine Temple. His chest tightened, and he exhaled softly, suppressing his growing unease. He comforted himself, "I have already chosen Bright Yang and now possess the Bright Yang Metallic Essence... I have come this far."

With a gentle wave of his hand, he retrieved an object from the table before him.

This was the result of years of effort, a Grade Five Purple Mansion Realm technique written using the Metallic Essence and references from numerous other techniques. Having reviewed it with his newfound immortal techniques, Lu Jiangxian was reassured of its perfection. Finally, he allowed himself a sigh of relief.

The item was a golden jade slip with intricate patterns, engraved with small characters that read, Radiant Essence Scripture.

After putting everything in order, a bold idea arose in Lu Jiangxian's mind. His gaze swept downward, and his divine sense extended outward, scanning the entirety of Moongaze Lake.

His attention lingered briefly on the core members of the Li Family, but he failed to find what he was seeking. His divine sense swept further until it reached the small town, where it rested on a young man standing in a courtyard, looking gently at the people around him.

This youth had broad eyebrows and an imposing yet composed demeanor. Dressed in a fine robe, his smile radiated warmth. This was none other than Li Chengliao.

Li Chengliao had navigated the situation with Xu Xiao deftly, earning the favor of many elders. Recently, he had been riding a wave of success, having taken a new wife and broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. It was the prime of his life.

However, Lu Jiangxian's divine sense did not linger on Li Chengliao but instead shifted to the figure beside him.

Seated next to him was a gentle woman with a sweet smile. Though her beauty could not rival that of Liu Lingzhen, her actions exuded natural elegance, and her eyes shone brightly. She was lightly cradling her stomach. With a slight movement of his divine sense, Lu Jiangxian detected the presence of a fetus within her womb.

He softly formed a hand seal, and the Metallic Essence flowed with his will, surreptitiously linking to the void beyond. Lu Jiangxian murmured in a low voice, "Since Bright Yang descends and the threads of fate scatter, bringing forth fated ones, why should it not be my Li Family's turn?"




# Chapter 618: Wandering Through the Great Void

Li Xuanfeng stepped out of the ancestral hall. The rain outside had lessened, but droplets still fell rhythmically onto the stone steps. His black-gold boots splashed through a shallow puddle of water collected at the threshold.

He glanced into the water, where his reflection gazed back—a face marked by age. His temples had turned white, his eyebrows thinned, and the lines of his face had blurred. His lips had grown thinner, and his deep-set eyes betrayed neither triumph nor joy but rather the weariness of one who had endured the pain of parting with life and death.

Li Xuanfeng was startled to realize how aged he had become. In that instant, he became aware of the toll taken by eighty years of struggle and hardship. Like most cultivators of the world, though his life expectancy placed him in his prime, the battles he had endured had left him prematurely weathered, unrecognizable from his youth.

He stepped into the main hall, where the threshold now seemed far higher than it had been in his younger years, rising all the way to his calves.

The juniors stood in rows along the sides. His elder brother, Li Xuanxuan, now a frail shadow of his former self, trembled as he stood at the highest position. Behind him stood a youth dressed in mourning robes, who was likely Li Ximing.

Further down stood Li Qinghong of the second branch, flanked by Li Xijun and Li Xicheng. Behind them, a scattered group of younger descendants waited. Li Yuexiang stood in a corner, accompanied by a hunched man dressed in black. A faint aura of demonic qi surrounded him, and he remained silent.

Li Xuanfeng immediately recognized the figure as a Hooked Serpent demon but refrained from commenting. Li Xuanxuan, his eyes brimming with tears, approached him and simply took his hand, saying, "Come, come."

In his youth, Li Xuanxuan had always ceded the spotlight to his younger brother whenever Li Xuanfeng was present, subtly stepping aside to give way to the more gifted sibling. Even now, he deferred, guiding his brother to the seat of honor.

The rest of the family bowed deeply and called out in unison, "Greetings to the Ancestor! Welcome home!"

Li Xuanfeng responded, "Rise."

Li Xuanfeng's gray eyes swept over the gathered family. He noted who met his gaze directly and who lowered their eyes in silence. He quickly discerned the state of the household. Having fought his way through rivers of blood in the southern border, his presence exuded a fearsome and commanding aura. His brief silence immediately drew the full attention of the room.

In a low voice, he began, "Yuanjiao perished in the grotto heaven. I have returned to bring his belongings home."

The assembled family remained silent, prepared for the news. Li Xuanxuan closed his eyes slowly, as though he had anticipated this outcome. Though the younger generation had tried to shield him from the truth, their expressions had long betrayed the reality of the situation.

Upon learning that only Li Xuanfeng had returned, the events that transpired within the grotto heaven became self-evident.

Li Xuanfeng could see the pain in his brother's face and chose not to dwell on it. Instead, he retrieved several jade slips from his storage pouch. Fixing his gaze on the gathering, he called out in a steady voice, "Li Wushao."

The black-clad youth dropped to his knees with a resounding thud, the sound echoing against the steady patter of rain outside. Li Xuanfeng narrowed his eyes slightly. Having slain countless demons, his mere glance struck terror into this Hooked Serpent, who now pressed his forehead firmly to the ground.

Li Xuanfeng said, "Li Wushao, Qinghong has spoken of your diligence, and Yuanjiao freed your spirituality before his passing. You are no longer bound to our family. If you have somewhere else to go, you may leave freely."

Li Wushao dared not say much. After all, the Li Family had treated him generously over the years, and as a loyal servant, his life within the family had been secure and comfortable. Returning to the Eastern Sea would only render him prey, a mere morsel for the dragon clans. Bowing deeply, he rasped, "Wushao is but a lowly demon, indebted to my late master's kindness. I would never dare to betray that bond."

Li Xuanfeng, uncertain about the rank of his family's demon-suppressing techniques, hesitated briefly. Before he could respond, a handsome young man stepped forward from the crowd. Carrying a sword on his back, his clear eyes were calm and resolute as he said respectfully, "Our family has rules for such matters. Why not leave this to Xijun for resolution?"

Li Xuanfeng nodded in agreement, then unrolled a series of jade slips in his hand. Speaking softly, he announced, "These three manuals were acquired from within the grotto heaven: Wei Radiant Celestial Pass Technique, Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique, and Azure Serpent's Return Technique. All are ancient techniques tied to our family. Except for the thunder technique, the others lack spiritual qi, but they can still be cultivated if the opportunity arises."

He handed over the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique with a glance at Li Qinghong. "As for this one, Qinghong, study it carefully."

Li Qinghong accepted it with a nod. Li Xuanfeng continued, "There are three Embryonic Breathing Realm manuals here as well. Two are Grade Four: Six Chapters Seeking Immortality and Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique. The last is a Grade Five Embryonic Breathing Realm manual, Insights of Taihua."

"A Grade Five technique!" The crowd murmured in astonishment.

Li Xuanfeng didn't pause, producing a deep golden halberd next. Its shaft curved like a crescent moon and was taller than an average man. "This is an artifact from ancient Bright Yang. The family may put it to use."

One by one, he laid out various rare spirit items. Finally, he brought forth a violet, circular jade talisman, presenting it with great solemnity. "This is a Purple Mansion Realm Talisman. When infused with mana, it can be activated. It shall be used to stabilize the family's fortune."

His gaze swept across the gathered faces. Seeing no trace of greed, his heart settled with some satisfaction. He gestured for Li Xuanxuan and said softly, "Elder brother, let us talk privately."

Li Xuanfeng hadn't seen his elder brother for decades. Though he'd returned this year, his responsibilities in the Eastern Sea meant he wouldn't be able to visit often. Faced with his brother now, he found himself at a loss for words.

Li Xuanxuan simply waved a hand. A faint, clear light emanated from several of his orifices, revealing the formation that the Hengzhu Dao Gate had placed upon him long ago. Accepting a jade box from Li Xuanfeng, he said hoarsely, "I shall see to burying Jiao'er."

He shuffled unsteadily down the steps. Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng took a moment to stroll around the area. Despite the potent medicinal properties of the pills provided by Tu Longjian, his internal injuries had yet to fully heal. He decided to prioritize his recovery and went off to tend to his wounds.

At the same time, the two elders retreated to the back courtyard, while those in the main hall rose to their feet. Li Ximing cupped his fist and said, "The elixirs required by the clan this year will be available tomorrow. Send someone to retrieve them from my Alchemy Pavilion."

Leaving these words, he departed. Li Yuexiang was preparing to take her leave when Li Qinghong stopped her gently, saying, "Your elder brother is stationed in the sect. The branch line must have someone to speak for it."

Li Yuexiang paused, nodded, and stayed. The group then divided the techniques. The Grade Five Embryonic Breathing Realm technique, Insights of Taihua, was naturally set aside as a secret manual for the main family. As always, the Li Family treated outsiders with generosity. The Grade Four techniques, Six Chapters Seeking Immortality and Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique, were allocated to the descendants of meritorious contributors.

As for ordinary external members and offshoot cultivators, they were already entitled to Grade Three Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques. This level of generosity was significant, rivaling what some other clans might reserve for their less-favored direct descendants.

Li Qinghong studied the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique carefully, pondering over it for some time. In her estimation, it did not surpass the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique significantly, save for its lack of reproductive side effects. However, it did not reduce life force consumption much either.

"Strange… This seems to be a result of changes in the world, not a flaw in the technique itself." Li Qinghong's mastery of lightning techniques was already profound. With two ancient lightning manuals in hand, she quickly made her judgment. She murmured, "Still, it contains many insights worth referencing. The Eastern Sea is currently experiencing Falling Water Rising Storm. Once the family stabilizes, I will retreat to an offshore island for seclusion."

Li Qinghong surveyed the group, and after a brief discussion about the family's recent changes, found no significant issues. Li Xijun then spoke softly, "News has arrived from outside. Ancestor Yuan Licheng of the Yuan Family failed in his Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough and perished in meditation. This prolonged rain outside is likely the celestial phenomenon marking his death."

Li Qinghong, prompted by this comment, recalled something and said quietly, "When I was fighting for treasures near Green Pine Island, I saved someone from the Han Family. I overheard that a Yuan Family cultivator had died. After all, they are allies..."

Li Xijun nodded, "I have already sent someone to investigate."

Li Qinghong frowned slightly and remarked, "I have heard that Ancestor Yuan Licheng once studied under Daoist Master Buzi. Later, he was exiled for committing a transgression. Now that Buzi is missing, and Yuan Licheng has passed, the Yuan Family is likely to face a difficult period."

Li Xijun looked at the unrelenting downpour in the sky and nodded slightly, "Let us hope this does not affect the sect. If we count the days, Brother Xizhi should be close to breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

————

In the world within the Mirror.

Lu Jiangxian held the Bright Yang Metallic Essence in his hand, and with his elevated inherent rank, he had spent half a month carefully linking it to the fetus before cautiously withdrawing.

Because it was still an unborn child, he dared not establish too deep a connection, fearing that the Bright Yang might ignite and destroy both mother and child. The task was extremely delicate; even with his mastery of immortal techniques, it had taken him half a month to establish a preliminary connection. Had it been his earlier self, such a complex task would have been impossible.

"Though difficult, it was flawless!" Lu Jiangxian marveled at the brilliance of his method.

Using the mirror's undetectable properties, he stored the Metallic Essence within the mirror and subtly extended its influence outward. Coupled with the True Insight Profound Method, even if Pristine Water personally inspected it, unless they first located the mirror itself, they would be unable to detect the child's anomaly. They would simply assume the child was born bearing a thread of fate.

As Lu Jiangxian admired his ingenuity, the mirror grew increasingly radiant with the fusion of the jade buckle. Retracting his divine sense, he closed his eyes and immersed himself in the experience.

It had been far too long since Lu Jiangxian had acquired a new component for the mirror. Compared to his earlier days in this realm—when pieces came one after another, rendering him unconscious for years—this jade buckle caused only a slight weariness.

"Three Talisman Seeds, the Supreme Yin Profound Light raised to the Purple Mansion Realm... these are but secondary gains." These upgrades did not move him deeply. Over the past half month, the jade buckle had gradually dissolved, granting the mirror a new, special ability. "Traversing the Great Void!"

The jade buckle had seemingly been the immortal mirror's original mechanism for entering the Great Void, but it had been extracted and condensed into its current form. Now, with its reintegration, this capability was restored to the mirror.

Lu Jiangxian finally let out a long breath of relief. After toiling in this realm for so many years, the immortal mirror could now connect to the Great Void and traverse it freely. Combined with the mirror's inscrutable nature, it meant that no one below the Golden Core Realm could hope to reach him.

Moreover, he no longer needed to be carted across the world by others. The immortal mirror could now float within the Great Void, allowing him to descend from any Talisman Seed at will.

Not only that, he could use the Great Void to communicate with any Talisman Seed and unleash the Supreme Yin Profound Light in a grand display, annihilating his enemies. This meant that if Lu Jiangxian resolved to kill a cultivator in the Purple Mansion Realm, there were few places in the world where they could hide.

Of course, the Great Void was an unpredictable realm filled with countless demons and entities. Attempting to strike across vast distances from within it was akin to lighting firecrackers next to slumbering Golden Core Realm cultivators.

With his thoughts sorted, Lu Jiangxian's spirits soared. Slowly forming a hand seal, the ritual altar outside—engraved with intricate patterns—began to transform. The pale grayish-blue surface of the mirror gradually turned bright white. Lu Jiangxian felt a chill spread through his entire being, and the illusions around him dissipated as the mirror vanished from its place.

————

Li Xuanfeng spent only half a month in seclusion, during which his injuries recovered significantly, almost to seventy or eighty percent. After all, the medicinal salve he applied was a rare treasure, with a single dose costing over a hundred and eighty spirit stones. Its efficacy was naturally remarkable.

"It is effective, but still... it cannot always be calculated like this..." Li Xuanfeng shook his head.

Upon reaching the late Foundation Establishment Realm or even the Purple Mansion Realm, the value of spirit stones diminished significantly. Genuine Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts, elixirs, and precious spiritual qi or spirit water were rarely traded with spirit stones. Instead, bartering became the norm.

He touched the storage pouch at his waist, taking out several letters and a few artifacts. Reflecting to himself, he thought, I will need to find an opportunity... to circle around the lake.

Back during the Azure Pond Sect's recruitment, he was not the only one from the family to leave for the southern border. Over the years, many of those who had left had either perished or suffered grievous wounds, leaving only a few still alive.

Upon hearing that Li Xuanfeng was leaving the southern border, these cultivators naturally wrote him letters. For those who had passed away, their relics were entrusted to the city for safekeeping. Since they had fought alongside him, the sentiment still lingered, and Li Xuanfeng felt obliged to visit the families of his fallen comrades to return their belongings.

As Li Xuanfeng pondered these matters, he slowly adjusted his breathing. Soon after, he emerged from the cave dwelling, his thoughts shifting, The immortal mirror absorbed the jade buckle but has not shown any reaction for some time. I should go check on it.

He made his way to the secret chamber, raising his brow slightly as a pang of alarm surged through his chest. To his astonishment, the altar stood empty, devoid of anything.

"What!" He froze briefly, his heart suddenly sinking. However, he faintly sensed something still present before him. Focusing his gaze, he noticed that the talisman seed within his body stirred. To his shock, a faint, illusory shadow appeared on the altar. "This is... an entry into the Great Void?"

At that moment, an intangible ripple spread outward. Outside, Li Qinghong abruptly lifted her head, her expression revealing a trace of joy. Her gaze seemed to pierce through the clouds, sensing the immortal mirror's shadow in a certain direction.

On a stone path, Li Xijun also raised his brow sharply, an instant comprehension flooding his mind. Just as a look of astonishment crossed his face, the golden and resplendent Alchemy Pavilion before him emitted a loud explosion, releasing a column of crimson flames. Li Ximing emerged from the flames, covered in soot. It was evident that the sudden realization had disrupted his pill refinement.

The two brothers exchanged glances and nodded in unison. Li Xijun spoke in a low voice, "It is the jade buckle!"

Li Ximing, highly gifted in alchemy, rarely experienced cauldron explosions. This was his first time ending up in such a disheveled state. With a casual wave, he cast a cleansing spell on himself and hurriedly joined Li Xijun in heading toward the ancestral hall.

Meanwhile, within the secret chamber, Li Xuanfeng continued to gaze at the now empty altar. Having encountered and learned much during his time in the southern border and through his interactions with Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, he quickly pieced together the situation. Numerous thoughts flashed through his mind as he deliberated before removing the Qingche Sword from his waist.

When Li Yuanjiao designed the altar, he had carefully considered various contingencies, even preparing for the possibility of using the Qingche Sword as a substitute. Li Xuanfeng gently placed the sword on the altar. It fit perfectly, as though it had always belonged there.

Behind him, the stone door shifted slightly, and several direct descendants of the Li Family hurried in. Li Xuanfeng waved his hand, signaling for them to leave.




# Chapter 620: The Fei Family Today

The group exited the secret chamber, with Li Xuanfeng clad in his black-gold armor leading the way. He took his seat at the head of the room while the others stood respectfully to the sides. Sitting upright, he asked, "Have you gained any insights?"

Everyone nodded in affirmation. Moments earlier, a ripple of energy had triggered revelations through their talisman seeds, causing their sea of qi to brighten. The seeds emitted a more luminous hue, and several chants appeared in their minds. Through their talisman seeds, they could sense the immortal mirror in the Great Void and use the chants to establish a connection.

Seeing their nods, Li Xuanfeng paused briefly before stating gravely, "This is good news. Xizhi should also sense this within the sect."

The group nodded again, though their subdued expressions reflected the lingering atmosphere of mourning. The recent loss in their family prevented much celebration. After a moment of thought, Li Xuanfeng added, "Although Yu Muxian is now dead, refrain from acting rashly around the lake for the time being. Once I return to the southern border and understand the sect's internal negotiations through the Ning Family, I will send back instructions. Proceed accordingly."

Li Qinghong nodded in agreement and replied, "We will await your message. However, there is one matter... In the past, the Yu Family had a swordsman by the name of Yu Mujian."

Few in the hall recognized the name, though Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly. Li Qinghong turned to explain to the younger members, "During the Yu Family's peak, its brothers each excelled in their own right. Yu Muxian was extraordinarily gifted, Yu Mugao was ruthlessly cunning, and another, Yu Mujian, was defeated by our grandfather. Afterward, he went north seeking the Dao and has been unheard of since."

After a brief pause, Li Qinghong continued gravely, "If this individual is still alive, he may have already surpassed the Foundation Establishment Realm. Caution is advised."

Li Xicheng, who managed family affairs in the mountain foot, immediately understood and responded, "Over the years, Second Uncle and Youngest Uncle planted informants within the Yu Family to foment discord. I will investigate whether there is any correspondence or trace of his whereabouts."

Li Xuanfeng nodded, satisfied with their diligence, and dismissed everyone except Li Qinghong.

He asked, "I have heard that in recent years, relations with the Fei Family have grown distant. Is it because Fei Qingyi is cultivating on Yuanwu Peak?"

Li Qinghong nodded and briefly explained the situation, speaking softly. "Indeed... The Fei Family has not communicated with us for years. Whatever debt they owed us appears long forgotten."

Years ago, Fei Yihe, the young master of the Fei Family, had accompanied Li Xuanfeng to the southern border. Li Xuanfeng still carried letters from Fei Yihe addressed to his family. Hearing Li Qinghong's words, he furrowed his brow and said gravely, "I will pay the Fei Family a visit."

Li Qinghong hesitated, then added with concern, "I... I will go with you."

Li Xuanfeng did not object. The two took to the skies, leaving the mountain's protective formation behind as they flew north. They soon passed over an island filled with ruins and scattered formations.

"The marketplace on the central lake island from back then," Li Xuanfeng remarked, glancing down. The area had been scavenged by countless rogue cultivators over the years, though the restrictive formations still activated sporadically. He added, "In another decade or so, a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and a formation master should be enough to clear the remnants. The island's wealth could easily support cultivators."

Li Qinghong nodded; the family had long planned to reclaim this land. Together, they continued northward. The northern shore of Moongaze Lake rose higher, with abundant spirit veins and breathtaking landscapes. Cliffs, stone walls, and snowy peaks emerged into view as Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong descended toward Glacial Cloud Peak.

As they landed, a middle-aged man in white robes approached them, radiating cold qi. His brows lifted as he looked at them, his heart racing.

The woman before him stood atop lightning, her cultivation at mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. With her willow-like brows and almond-shaped eyes, she appeared to be around twenty-eight or twenty-nine. Her presence exuded a strange familiarity.

Seeing the woman whose presence already far exceeded that of a typical Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and the man clad in black-gold armor, whose mere presence caused eye-watering discomfort with his blade-like features, the middle-aged cultivator quickly concluded, They are disciples of an immortal sect.

At once, he bowed low, his posture bending to its utmost, and respectfully addressed them with his head lowered, "This is the Glacial Cloud Fei Family. I wonder, who are the honored seniors before me?"

Li Xuanfeng did not respond, but Li Qinghong, ever polite, answered warmly, "Qingdu's Li Qinghong."

The moment she spoke, the man before them appeared as if struck by lightning. His face turned pale, his lips trembled, and for a moment, he was at a loss for words. After hesitating for a breath, he finally stammered, "So it is... it is the Li Family. I am Fei Tongcai, and I greet the two honored seniors."

Only then did Fei Tongcai realize why the woman had seemed familiar. Years ago, Li Qinghong had spent three years with the Fei Family, and he had seen her a few times. Now understanding the situation, he took a deep breath and bowed his head again, asking cautiously, "May I ask what brings the two seniors here?"

Finally, Li Xuanfeng spoke, his tone low and unhurried, "Our families were old acquaintances. Have we now come to the point where even entry to Glacial Cloud Peak is denied?"

Fei Tongcai was drenched in sweat, unsure of how to respond. Bowing even further, he replied, "This junior holds little authority... the family head himself must come to greet you."

He hurriedly excused himself, leaving Li Qinghong to quietly explain, "The Fei Family was once forbidden to practice the Patterned Brocade technique, completely dismantling their system of cultivation over the centuries. They have had to start anew, and for decades now, they have not produced a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator."

Li Xuanfeng, standing with his hands behind his back, replied calmly, "Mortals will always seek profit and avoid harm. The Fei Family's choices cannot be considered wrong, but whenever I think of how Second Uncle spared their entire clan with a single sword strike, only to receive this in return, it leaves a bitter taste."

Before Li Qinghong could respond, her expression shifted. Below them, Glacial Cloud Peak suddenly erupted with radiant light. The Fei Family's long-relied-upon Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation activated, blanketing the entire immortal peak in a shimmering white glow.

Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow, watching as a figure flew toward them. The man bore a striking resemblance to Fei Yihe, sharing seven-tenths of his features and a similarly handsome demeanor. However, his current expression was grim. Riding the wind, he lowered his voice as he greeted them, "I am Fei Tongyu, head of the Fei Family. Greetings to the honored seniors."

The activation of the formation made the Fei Family's distrust blatantly clear, a slight of no small magnitude given that Li Tongya had once saved their entire clan. And yet, Fei Tongyu personally came to greet them, placing himself at risk. The contradiction in these actions—the defensive formation and the risky gesture—made Li Qinghong shake her head internally.

My elder brother once said this man was like a weasel rushing to prepare for winter. Indeed, his actions are telling. He is cautious to the extreme, yet even his offense is clumsy and incomplete—a man who sways with the wind.

Li Xuanfeng studied Fei Tongyu closely, a faint and ambiguous smile appearing on his face. In a deep voice, he declared, "So, you are Fei Tongyu! Excellent!"

From his sleeve, he pulled out a letter and handed it over with an impassive expression, "This is from your father. Do as you see fit with it."

With a flick of his hand, he tossed the letter along with a storage pouch, which hit Fei Tongyu squarely in the chest with a sharp thud. Without another word, Li Xuanfeng turned and soared away. Li Qinghong, seamlessly playing along, hurried forward and chided, "Fellow Daoist! How could you act so rudely? This is excessive!"

For Fei Tongyu, it was as though a bolt of thunder had struck his ears. Hearing news of his father for the first time in decades left him reeling, his composure shattered. Already rattled by the intimidating presence of Li Xuanfeng's piercing gaze, he was utterly disoriented and stammered helplessly, "I... this... ah!"

Li Xuanfeng's decisive gesture had delivered their message clearly, returning the slight with precision. Meanwhile, Li Qinghong softened the blow, her tone gentle as she admonished, "Fellow Daoist, your behavior truly leaves much to be desired."

Fei Tongyu stood dazed in midair for a long moment, his movements slow and clumsy. Clutching the letter written by his father, tears welled up in his eyes. In a tone of quiet pleading, he finally said, "I was only afraid... never mind. Please, honored seniors, I humbly invite you to visit our peak."

Li Qinghong knew that Li Xuanfeng had not gone far. She gave a slight nod and descended with him. Fei Tongyu hurriedly offered to escort her into the cave dwelling, but Li Qinghong had no intention of staying long. She merely said, "Let us walk around this peak instead."




# Chapter 635: The Profound Method of Continuation

The Cloud Octopus had just been subdued when two more demon octopi flew out of the sea, breaking through the air with bared fangs and brandished claws. They collided with Kongheng's golden light, causing it to waver slightly and granting Yun Xiaozi a brief opportunity to breathe. He channeled his demonic power to fend off the incoming thunder.

Kongheng, though slightly strained, maintained an unperturbed expression. Instead, a peculiar glint appeared in his eyes.

Over the years, he had mastered many spells, but subduing three demons simultaneously was beyond his limits. He found the two newly arrived demons surprisingly weak and, upon closer inspection, activated his spell-bound eyes. "These two demons seem odd. They appear to be clones... No wonder the two serpent fishes show no fear."

While he continued suppressing the three demons, Li Qinghong, in the air above, was not idle. Thunder gathered in her hands, and the long spear she wielded turned the surrounding spiritual energy into a brilliant violet hue. With a flourish, she unleashed a spark with her spear, which transformed into the image of a sparrow.

The long spear emitted a conical violet wave in midair, surrounded by thunder. In response, seven or eight bolts of lightning descended from the sky, creating an awe-inspiring spectacle.

Yun Xiaozi was alarmed, thinking to himself, This is not good. She must be a disciple of an immortal sect. If she truly intends to kill me, I will not escape alive under such a barrage of thunder.

Realizing escape was futile, he abandoned the thought, baring his fangs in determination. He knew he had no choice but to fight to the death. Stretching out his eight tentacles, he surged through the clouds and mist, frantically absorbing energy.

Meanwhile, Huiyao, with his round, bun-like face, hesitated to intervene, fearing that stepping forward would result in being suppressed by the golden light. He thought to himself in alarm, Dealing with a monk is already bad enough! But now there is also a thunder cultivator... They speak of merging fire to exorcise demons, and heavenly thunder restrains filth. But in this world, what demon does not carry some corruption?"

Yun Xiaozi, caught between the thunder and his desperate attempts to absorb the spiritual energy around him, caused the energy in the area to plummet. Even the sea, which had been sealed into a flat expanse of land, showed faint cracks as if it might leap and churn under the strain of his spell.

Li Qinghong parted her lips slightly, preparing to summon the profound thunder stored in her thunderpool. A faint purple-white glow flickered at her red lips, giving her an otherworldly appearance.

Since her breakthrough to the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, her thunder reservoir had increased to two profound thunder. If she were to recklessly expend her temporary mana to conjure a third, it would be enough to end Yun Xiaozi, a demon without a proper Dao lineage. Yet, she hesitated, distrusting the two demon fishes.

Huiyao burst into loud laughter and shouted, "At last, I can be of use!"

He blew and struck the small jade-green bell floating midair. The bell trembled and swayed with a faint hum, sending out ripples that halted the surging flow of spiritual energy. The energy lingered in the air, suspended and indecisive, unable to find its path.

Yun Xiaozi, never having faced such a situation, flailed his eight tentacles in a frenzy. He writhed wildly in midair, struggling to resist the incoming thunder. Unlike Yu Muxian, who was a prodigy in spellcasting, Yun Xiaozi was helpless in this predicament.

While Yun Xiaozi's spell clashed against the green bell's power, Li Qinghong put away her profound thunder. Her long hair flowed freely as she leaped into the fray with unrestrained energy. Thunder and black smoke surged in all directions as she wielded her violet lightning spear, moving effortlessly through the attacks of the three demons.

Li Qinghong had arrived in the Eastern Sea only to face unsatisfying battles thus far. Her opponents were either dealt with in two quick strikes or refused to fight her to the death. This time, she finally found a worthy challenge. The talisman qi within her surged faintly, and with every clash, her strength grew fiercer.

Yun Xiaozi, trapped in the chaos, found himself in utter despair. The power of the lightning in the female cultivator's spear grew stronger, and her spear aura sharper. Torn flesh and blood flew high into the air, raining down in a crimson storm, attracting swarms of fish to feast upon it.

Forced to abandon his spell, Yun Xiaozi noticed that the two serpent fish had already entangled his subordinates. Meanwhile, the bald monk's glowing golden palms landed heavy, crushing strikes directly on Yun Xiaozi's body.

Having lost the initiative and suppressed by the artifact, Yun Xiaozi found himself unable to effectively cast his spells. He was forced into direct combat with Li Qinghong, barely holding his ground. With the Master Monk joining the fight, Yun Xiaozi's predicament grew increasingly dire.

This was a flaw shared by most cultivators outside the dragon clans, immortal gate scions, and major powers. They often relied on just a handful of signature techniques. Once they lost the upper hand or were countered early, they quickly fell into disadvantage and could not sustain themselves.

Desperate, Yun Xiaozi activated his Immortal Foundation and hastily cast several self-created spells. He summoned golden mist to block the attacks, but under the combined assault of his two enemies, his defenses seemed pale and ineffective. The only remotely threatening move he had was his occasional use of a purple-black beak.

The beak was incredibly sharp and charged with destructive power. It could bite through thunder with ease. Even Kongheng, with his iron-like palms, had to avoid the beak's attacks carefully.

After a fierce exchange, Kongheng finally brought out his ancient bronze staff. It rang loudly with metallic clangs as it struck Yun Xiaozi repeatedly. The strikes reduced his flesh to pulp and left him on the brink of collapse.

Yun Xiaozi resisted desperately, but his strength was only comparable to that of Fu Daimu in the past. Fu Daimu, at least, had the advantage of being a disciple of Mount Wu and wielding a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact. Yun Xiaozi had neither of these. Unable to withstand the relentless assault, he continuously threw out talismans and spirit items in a futile attempt to defend himself.

Despite being in the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm and carrying numerous treasures and talismans, Yun Xiaozi was forced to flee southward for hundreds of li. Blood and golden mist trailed behind him as pieces of his flesh peeled away during the desperate chase.

Finally cornered at the cape, Li Qinghong severed Yun Xiaozi's eighth tentacle, rendering him completely incapable of resistance. After battling through the entire night, her mana was greatly depleted. However, her momentum only grew fiercer. By the end, each spear strike was twenty percent stronger than when the fight began. With Kongheng blocking Yun Xiaozi's escape route, they finally managed to bring the demon down.

Li Qinghong forced Yun Xiaozi into his humanoid form. His previous saddle-nosed elder appearance had been reduced to just a head connected to a withered torso. Closing his eyes tightly, Yun Xiaozi begged for mercy. Li Qinghong sealed his Immortal Foundation and his beak. Only then did the two serpent fish demons finally arrive.

Each of the serpent fish demons held a Cloud Octopus in hand, both of them barely alive. The octopi's eight tentacles had been devoured completely, clearly consumed by the two demons.

Seeing the overwhelming strength of the two cultivators, Huiyao quickly changed his demeanor. Putting away his green bell, he became respectful and deferential, exclaiming, "Your Grace, such powerful thunder techniques! Master Monk, such powerful spells!"

The demon clearly wasn't accustomed to such flattery, repeating "powerful" over and over in its speech, characteristic of its kind's lack of moral burden and willingness to change attitudes in an instant. Li Qinghong, unsurprised, pointed to Yun Xiaozi and said, "Let us not discuss how the rest of the spoils will be divided for now. He is mine—I still have use for him."

Huiyao nodded repeatedly in agreement. Kongheng glanced at the Cloud Octopus heads held by the two serpent fish demons, a look of doubt crossing his face, and remarked, "These two creatures seem surprisingly weak."

Li Qinghong silently turned her head, hiding a smile. She wasn't sure if Kongheng's words were deliberate, but the serpent fish brothers seemed entirely oblivious. One of them hurriedly explained, "Master Monk, you may not know, but Yun Xiaozi's Dao foundation is quite peculiar. These two are not normal Foundation Establishment Realm demons but products of a fortuitous opportunity."

Huiyao continued, "Years ago, he severed eight of his tentacles, each one transforming into a Cloud Octopus. By linking their innate abilities to his Dao foundation and nurturing them over the years with his mana, he managed to cultivate two Foundation Establishment Realm subordinates. However, they are inherently flawed and ultimately inferior."

"Master Monk's abilities are vast, naturally far beyond what these creatures could challenge," Huiyao added, following up with a stream of exaggerated praise. His words fully embodied the typical demon mindset of fearing power without genuine loyalty. Quickly changing the subject, he invited, "This old creature has quite the collection of treasures. Let me take you down for a look."

The two demons reverted to their true forms and dove into the sea. Li Qinghong, after swallowing a pill, calculated that she hadn't even needed to use a single bolt of profound thunder from her thunderpool and followed them leisurely.

After some time searching underwater, the group returned empty-handed. Huiyao, visibly frustrated, grabbed Yun Xiaozi and slapped him a dozen times, demanding the location of his lair.

However, Yun Xiaozi, knowing his fate was sealed, kept his mouth tightly shut and refused to reveal anything. Huiyao and his brother exchanged a sly smile. "My Grace, leave him to us for a bit," one of them suggested.

"Keep him alive, I still need him," Li Qinghong ordered. She watched as the serpent fish dove back into the sea, and a thick mist began to rise from the water. Soon, only Li Qinghong and Kongheng were left on the surface.

Kongheng clasped his hands together, hesitating for a moment with his eyes closed. Meanwhile, Li Qinghong gazed toward the horizon, secretly observing their surroundings.

The group had ventured several hundred li deeper, reaching the sea's edge. The spiritual energy in this area grew increasingly sparse, and the sky was an endless expanse of dim darkness. It was said that the spiritual energy here was so thin that even the Great Void was fractured and unstable. Even cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm, upon reaching this place, would have to descend to lower altitudes to continue flying.

At the sea's edge, the water tumbled over, transforming into mist that rose into the air. This created a dense, heavy cloud cover. If a location with abundant spiritual energy could be found amidst this, it would indeed be an excellent place for cultivation.

Li Qinghong observed her surroundings for a moment, noticing that sweat had started to form on Kongheng's face. Finally, the two serpent fish leaped out of the water, handing over Yun Xiaozi and taking the lead to guide them further.

Yun Xiaozi's eyes were tightly shut, his body covered in blood, and he appeared to have lost consciousness. Half of his form had turned into a limp, fleshy mass, dripping blood that transformed into golden mist as it rose and dispersed into the air.

The group flew over the sea and soon located a formation point. Using Yun Xiaozi's token, they activated it and descended into his lair.

The interior of Yun Xiaozi's lair was empty and slimy, resembling a sea cave. The wet, churning spirit mud created an environment well-suited to the Cloud Octopus' tastes. After searching the area for a while, the group began collecting various spirit items.

The spirit mud here was unusual. Aside from its foul stench, it had a corrosive property that could penetrate mana and erode the body. While the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators were unaffected, they still found the smell unbearable. Huiyao, thoroughly disgusted by the environment, dragged Yun Xiaozi over and slapped him several dozen more times to vent his frustration.

Most of the treasures they found were broken artifacts. Some had been refined by demons, while others were remnants left behind by cultivators. Beyond that, they discovered spirit items, including various forms of spirit water and spiritual qi.

Li Qinghong selected a few spears and swords, inspecting the spiritual qi within them. None of them were familiar to her, but she casually picked a few and selected some spirit water that would be useful for juniors practicing perception techniques.

In terms of wealth... there is nothing truly remarkable here. Just a few rare spirit items to bring back, she thought to herself.

After assessing Yun Xiaozi's strength earlier, she hadn't held high hopes for the treasures he might possess. Huiyao's earlier boasting about the vastness of his collection was no more than a typical ploy to stir greed. Now that their enemy was no more, Huiyao's cheerful demeanor betrayed no hint of embarrassment.

Once the spoils were divided, Huiyao was in excellent spirits. He courteously escorted Li Qinghong and Kongheng back to the island, showing an unusual degree of hospitality. He didn't even bring up the topic of offerings, let alone demand a share of the underwater mineral resources.

Li Qinghong, however, remained cautious. She feared the serpent fish might eventually broach the matter of dividing mineral resources, a topic that was highly taboo among the dragon clans. If such a proposal reached the ears of a Dragon Son, it could lead to serious consequences. She tactfully declined and quietly retreated into seclusion on the island.

In the southern borders, at Yi Mountain City.

Li Xuanfeng had waited in the southern border for over two years before finally being summoned by Daoist Master Yuan Su.

Returning to the entrance of the cave dwelling, he carefully observed the spirit beast statue at its entrance. Sure enough, it resembled the one he had seen in the grotto heaven, giving him confidence as he stepped inside.

Yuan Su, as always, reclined on his jade platform. Spiritual qi surged below, and white mist swirled about. His gaze lingered on Li Xuanfeng for a moment before he spoke softly, "So, you really killed Yu Muxian."

Li Xuanfeng kneeled and bowed, replying, "This subordinate acted rashly. I beg the Daoist Master's forgiveness."

Yuan Su shook his head and slowly straightened, his voice light and drifting in the air. "It does not matter. Yuanwu must die before I do. When that time comes, even Tang Shedu will not be able to do anything to you."
𝘧𝓇𝑒𝑒𝑤ℯ𝑏𝓃𝘰𝑣ℯ𝘭.𝘤ℴ𝘮

He completely ignored Li Xuanfeng's words and continued speaking to himself. "Suiguan has seen two years of continuous rain without pause. That Golden Feather Sect will not remain idle either. Troubled times loom ahead..."

After a few idle comments, Daoist Master Yuan Su stopped talking. Li Xuanfeng stepped forward and said, "While in the grotto heaven, this subordinate encountered a spirit beast statue resembling the one at your cave dwelling. From the statue, I acquired a gemstone, which I have brought to offer to the Daoist Master."

"The Three-Eyed Mount Tiao Beast?" Yuan Su's interest was piqued. As Li Xuanfeng presented the gemstone with both hands, Yuan Su gave it a brief glance. The gem was dark in color, with what seemed like rippling water inside. Disappointed, he remarked, "It is nothing valuable, just a piece of Valley Water Stone. It is useless to me. Keep it for yourself."

He leaned back on the jade platform again. The matter seemed to remind him of something, and he casually asked, "What techniques did you acquire in the grotto?"

Li Xuanfeng, already prepared, retrieved three jade slips from his storage pouch and respectfully replied, "The first is the Clear Dew Origin Manual, said to align with the Daoist Master's Shared Dao. The second is Meditative Chant, aligned with Fairy Ning Wan's Shared Dao. The third is my own Gold Aura Profound Inquiry Technique."

Yuan Su laughed heartily, the sound echoing for several breaths before he stopped. He then said, "You certainly put thought into this. The Purifying Dew divine ability within the Clear Dew Origin Manual does happen to be the one I lack. Unfortunately, the technique recorded on the Three Drums Wall ends at Foundation Establishment Realm, making it useless to me!"

He slowly sat upright and explained in a soft tone, "When one cultivates their first divine ability in the Purple Mansion Realm, they must start anew with the second. It similarly requires a cultivation technique aligned with the Purple Mansion Realm to develop. Without such techniques, the path is severed."

Li Xuanfeng furrowed his brows slightly. Yuan Su, resting his chin in his hand, casually asked, "Are you wondering how Chi Wei managed to reach the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm despite three of the five techniques from the Chi Family only extending to Foundation Establishment Realm?"

Although Li Xuanfeng had already deduced the answer, he still bowed respectfully and said, "I ask the Daoist Master for guidance."

Yuan Su shrugged and explained, "Without Purple Mansion Realm techniques, the solution is simple: find a prodigy to cultivate the foundation. Once they have brought the Dao foundation to the Foundation Establishment Realm, consume them through various means, supplement it with Purple Mansion Realm spirit items, and guide the transformation into a divine ability."

His eyes narrowed in a sly smile as his voice echoed throughout the cave dwelling, "There are many ways to achieve this, collectively known as the Profound Method of Continuation. It saves time while extending one's cultivation path. Naturally, the world flocks to it."

Yuan Su lamented, "After all, most of the Purple Mansion Realm techniques were lost during the southern migrations. Each family hoards what remains. Without resorting to such devouring methods, there is no other path forward. Otherwise, you end up like me—stuck on the borders, waiting for death to come."




# Chapter 637: Retribution and Response

Li Xuanfeng lowered his head, knowing it was not his place to respond. He remained silent as Yuan Su raised his hand and casually said, "Go to the Eastern Sea again and kill for me."

With a flick of his wrist, Yuan Su retrieved a piece of cloth from his sleeve, densely packed with names. Among them were prominent surnames and sects, though most of the names were unfamiliar and belonged to young individuals, with only a small portion being Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Li Xuanfeng nodded, carefully received the list, and tucked it into his robe.

Yuan Su then pulled out a jade talisman from his own robe, his voice low. For the first time, his usual lazy demeanor gave way to an air of weariness and age. "This is an artifact from northern Buddhist cultivators. It can conceal your thread of fate. Use it to kill and avoid being traced."

As he watched Li Xuanfeng accept the talisman, Yuan Su waved his hand with little interest. "Go. Get it done cleanly within ten years."

Li Xuanfeng bowed and retreated. Once he had left the cave dwelling, he carefully examined the list. On it were names from locations such as Crimson Reef Island, Golden Tang Gate, the Han Family, and even people from Profound Peak Gate, Hengzhu Dao Gate, and Azure Pond Sect. The sheer number of cultivators listed was staggering, and their inclusion would almost certainly offend the entire Yue State and the Eastern Sea region.

As Li Xuanfeng descended and disappeared into the mist, Ning Heyuan kneeled on the other side of the jade platform, his face drenched in sweat.

Yuan Su slowly stood and moved beside him, his voice soft. "Do you understand?"

Ning Heyuan lowered his gaze, trembling as he said, "Daoist Master... is this truly necessary?"

Ning Heyuan was no fool. He could clearly see the situation. The Ning Family had no one capable of restraining Li Xuanfeng. If Yuan Su were to die unexpectedly and Ning Wan failed to break through, the family's future would be precarious.

Yuan Su, having reached his status as a Daoist Master, was naturally meticulous and cunning. He wouldn't rely solely on Ning Hemian to secure Li Xuanfeng's loyalty. If the time came when Li Xizhi and Li Xuanfeng, both Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, held sway over the sect, and the Li Family continued to rise, the question of who would serve whom would be unclear.

By secretly ordering Li Xuanfeng to kill these people, Yuan Su ensured the Ning Family would have leverage over him. If the matter were ever exposed, it would spell Li Xuanfeng's ruin, leaving him no place to hide.

At the same time, once Li Xuanfeng was burdened with these blood debts, Yuan Su wouldn't need to act himself. Li Xuanfeng would sever ties with the Li Family entirely, achieving multiple objectives with a single stroke.

Still, no matter how much Yuan Su controlled Li Xuanfeng, Ning Heyuan could not feel the same sense of security as when Yuan Su was alive. Trembling, Ning Heyuan tearfully pleaded, "Daoist Master... I am of little use and still have much to learn from you. Without you, the family would lose its pillar of support."

Daoist Master Yuan Su paused briefly, his expression twisting. Beneath his robes, his hand clenched tightly as though suppressing something within himself.

A Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master's predicament was unlike that of ordinary people in power. When ordinary people grew old, they became senile, weak, and powerless to act on their desires.

But a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator retained their divine abilities and full consciousness until their very last breath. They could do nothing but watch as their own end approached, with the signs of their imminent demise looming over them. This terrifying clarity surpassed that of mortal death by a thousandfold.

Thus, it was not uncommon for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to wreak havoc in their final days, unleashing violence on friends and family alike. Ning Heyuan had heard of such cases before. Seeing Yuan Su's darkening expression, he quickly fell silent.

After several long breaths, Yuan Su slowly opened his eyes. His face twisted with malice as he stepped forward and spat out a single word, "Leave."

Ning Heyuan quickly scrambled out of the cavern, the jingling of his footsteps echoing in the quiet as the stone door closed heavily behind him. Yuan Su was left standing alone in the cave dwelling.

Ning Tiaoxiao clenched his teeth in silence and let out a deep breath. As the mist inside the cave dwelling dissipated, faint ghostly lights emerged on the stone walls, revealing exquisitely detailed faces etched into the surface.

Ning Tiaoxiao stared intently at these faces, counting their numbers. With a quick calculation, despair washed over him. He muttered in a low voice, "Burn the records, erase the names, replace the real with the false, and confuse truth with illusion. The world will have no clear path to follow."

"Brother Qun..." Ning Tiaoxiao continued absent-mindedly, "Chi Wei once said, in a world where the righteous path is sealed, all crooked paths become the righteous way. Brother Qun... my life's span is nearing its end. I have not encountered any immortals. Instead, I have drunk the blood of the people for a hundred years and committed countless evils. All that is left is to wait for death."

As the mist gradually rose, his figure disappeared into the swirling white vapor. Bowing his head as if in repentance, the spirit water flowing across the ground ceased its motion and began to float silently.

"For this is the only way to protect our clan." His voice reverberated in the cave dwelling.

————

"Daoist Master Yuan Su is planning for the matters after his death. This is a token of allegiance." Li Xuanfeng left the cave dwelling and flew straight back to his residence. Only upon arriving did he take out the list of names to examine it carefully.

As he narrowed his eyes at the list, his hands trembled slightly. One name after another surfaced in his mind, and, as he had expected, many of the families listed had close ties with the Li Family.

"...Yuan Su... what a masterstroke." Li Xuanfeng sighed.

Saying nothing, Li Xuanfeng walked into his residence in a daze. In the courtyard, Ning Hemian was sitting under the warm sunlight. A child sat nearby, reading aloud. For a moment, Li Xuanfeng stopped in his tracks, crossing his arms as though caught in a distant memory.

It was a scene so familiar: soft sunlight, a tranquil courtyard, and even a featherless wild goose wandering aimlessly about.

Yet this was Yi Mountain City, where the imposing atmosphere discouraged geese from flying above. The Ning Family's thresholds, carved with formation patterns, were far too high for a goose to enter.

"Dear husband!" Ning Hemian exclaimed in joy, raising her head. Her bright eyes sparkled with happiness, shaking Li Xuanfeng to his core. Her gentle words, spoken softly, didn't register with him. Inside, his emotions surged violently, making him feel nauseous.

Two faces flashed back and forth in his mind, causing him to clench his teeth until they almost shattered.

Pale-faced, Li Xuanfeng stood there motionless, haunted by the memory of his wife and child's brutal deaths. The horrifying scene interwove with the present reality, forcing long-buried memories to surface despite his efforts to suppress them.

He panted heavily until Ning Hemian approached and lightly shook his arm, her gaze filled with concern and affection. Only then did the shadows in his mind recede. He waved his hand lightly, signaling that he was fine.

Quickly regaining composure, his face returned to normal. He sat for a moment on a stone bench, his eyes vacant and unfocused.

Who was he supposed to take revenge on? He knew much of the truth now: the deal between Chi Wei and Jiang Boqing had forced Golden Tang Gate to strike southward. At the time, Chi Zhiyun had refused to dirty his hands, leaving the Ning Family to oversee matters covertly.

But Chi Wei was dead, and so was Jiang Boqing. Who now could bear the brunt of his vengeance? Should he target Ning Wan, who orchestrated the matter, or the Ning Family as a whole? Should he lay the blame entirely on the Chi Family? Lost in thought, Li Xuanfeng grasped his golden bow and shut his eyes tightly.

"Now, I have been ordered to kill, to massacre families allied to my own, merely as a token of allegiance. How is this any different from what Golden Tang Gate, the Ning Family, and the dogs of Azure Pond Sect did before?" Li Xuangfeng lamented, "How am I any better than the one who murdered Yu'er and my son? I have enjoyed the wealth of the immortal clans, taken a wife, and sired children. If Yu'er knew, she would surely spit on me in disgust."

His brow furrowed deeply, and his face darkened with grief. His lips trembled, and as night quickly fell, it felt as though a cold, venomous fire consumed him from within, leaving him frozen and dazed.

The courtyard was now empty, with only Ning Hemian sitting softly beside him. She clasped his hand silently, her expression calm and patient.

He raised his eyes to look at her, but the words refused to come out. His throat felt like it was full of thorns. After a long pause, his trembling voice finally broke the silence, "Mian'er, the Daoist Master has ordered me to kill."

Ning Hemian, ever perceptive, lowered her gaze as she took the list of names from his hand. Slowly gripping his hand tighter, she forced herself to say, "This is... a token of allegiance."

Li Xuanfeng's heart felt like a cold stone, lodged deep and immovable, as he watched Ning Hemian, her face pale, begin to read aloud, "Xiao Fu... the sixth grandson of Xiao Guitu... Kong Gusun, the nephew of Kong Yu himself! Cheng Xun'en... an inner disciple of Sword Gate... though not highly regarded, still a member of Sword Gate... Daoist Master... what is he thinking?!"

Ning Hemian abruptly stood, her face as white as paper, as she prepared to rise with the wind. But Li Xuanfeng caught her wrist, his lips bloodless as he spoke in a low voice, "Our family killed Yu Muxian."

The words struck Ning Hemian like thunder. She slumped back into her seat, staring at Li Xuanfeng, who refused to meet her gaze, his eyes fixed on the ground. The two sat in silence, husband and wife with no words to bridge the gulf between them. Finally, Li Xuanfeng spoke, "There is no other way forward. If the heavens and earth condemn me, let the punishment fall upon me alone. I will not allow it... to implicate others."

Ning Hemian's hands slowly fell to her sides as she sat quietly, watching him. Under the moonlight, his temples had turned completely white.

————

In September, the rain fell incessantly.

The population of Lijing Town had dwindled over the past few years. With unceasing rain, the crops could not grow and instead rotted in the fields, leaving them black and useless.

Famine had already begun to spread in the surrounding areas. Stable factions managed to survive better. As long as Qi Cultivators could soar with the wind, they could always trade for abundant grain elsewhere. In the fertile lands of Jiangnan, starvation could be avoided with effort.

The Yu Family had fragmented into six or seven smaller clans, allowing the townsfolk to live slightly better lives. With their population thinned, these newly established clans were eager to recruit cultivators of humble origins. Additionally, under the warnings issued by the Li Family, they generously distributed grain to avoid conflict.

Li Chengliao was in the main hall, holding his young heir on his lap as they read together. Suddenly, a figure entered from below.

The man, clad in armor and carrying a massive golden hammer in one hand, was tall and imposing—Li Wen.

As a rare talent among the Li Family's branch members, Li Wen had steadily risen to the peak of his power. Loyal and steadfast, his twin golden hammers had guarded several generations of clan heads, though they were rarely needed.

Li Chengliao had gradually taken over authority from Li Xicheng, and Li Wen had become a banner under his command, signaling his clear succession as the family's head.

Li Chengliao treated the old retainer with respect. After setting his son, Li Zhouwei, down from his lap, he looked up. The burly man spoke, "Master, Lord Lu has come to see you."

"Master Lu?" Li Chengliao wasn't surprised. Master Lu was the one responsible for Yu Mugao's death and the Yu family's subsequent fragmentation.

He was about to ask further when Li Wen continued, "He has been intercepted by Senior Wushao over the lake. Unable to advance or retreat, Senior Wushao has summoned Ancestor Ximing, and the three are currently at a standoff."

Li Wen, despite his rugged demeanor, spoke slowly and deliberately. The gravity of the situation was clear. Li Chengliao raised an eyebrow, quickly stood, and hurried outside. As he ascended with the wind, he asked, "He is merely a Qi Cultivator. How could he warrant the attention of two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators?"

He hesitated briefly but soared into the sky, observing from a distance.

————

Master Lu, dressed in flowing white robes and holding a fan, landed gracefully on the lake's surface. He faced the Foundation Establishment Realm demon before him without a trace of fear.

Taking a few steps into the air, he noticed a man in golden daoist robes flying in his direction. Once the two joined together, Master Lu finally restrained the frivolity on his face, offering a fist cup with a smile, "A visit from an old friend—would the two of you invite me in for a seat?"

Li Wushao's expression darkened as he fixed his gaze on Master Lu. This man was clearly at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, making it impossible for him to be just a guest cultivator of the Yu Family. Li Wushao stood ready, awaiting Li Ximing's command.

Li Ximing, though feeling uncertain in his heart, forced himself to stand firm. Despite being out of practice, his upbringing in etiquette gave him just enough composure to respond appropriately. With a calm demeanor, he gestured and said, "Please, Fellow Daoist."

Master Lu showed no sign of concern and followed the two into the formation. Once inside, he chuckled softly and cupped his fist again. "I am Jiang Heqian. I once had the honor of joining hands with Daoist Tongya against a mutual enemy. I wonder if your esteemed clan still remembers."

These words sent a chill down Li Ximing's spine. He had read the family histories and was well aware of who Jiang Heqian was.

Years ago, during the Yu Family's peak prosperity, with two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators overseeing their affairs, they had established the Milin Marketplace to further expand their influence. However, this had simultaneously infringed on the interests of many factions, even drawing the dissatisfaction of the Xiao Family.

In response, Li Tongya had united various forces, not only killing the ancestor of Yu Family but also destroying their market. During this assault, he had collaborated with Fei Wangbai and Jiang Heqian, a descendant of the Jiang Family. This partnership had dealt a severe blow to the Yu Family.

Jiang Heqian played a pivotal role in the incident, enabling the Yu Family's grand formation to be easily breached. Li Ximing had only read about this name in the family's history books, yet now, seeing the man in person, he felt as though a figure from history had stepped into the present, bringing with it a profound sense of the passage of time.

However, this feeling was soon replaced by an intense sense of dread.

This man is the last survivor of the Jiang Family. The Jiang Family was founded by outer disciples of the Moonlight Origin Mansion. Countless factions have sought him over the years, but his whereabouts had always remained unknown. And to think... to think he disguised himself as a mere Qi Cultivation Realm guest cultivator, endured decades in the Yu Family, orchestrated the death of Yu Mugao, and ultimately caused the Yu Family's fragmentation...

At this thought, a moment of realization dawned on Li Ximing.
𝒻𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝘮

No wonder... no wonder the Yu Family, once a big clan, lacked any means of maintaining stability and crumbled so easily. If not for Yuanwu Peak's intervention, the Yu Family wouldn't have lasted this long! So it was all his doing, pulling the strings from the shadows... an eye for an eye, blood repaid with blood!

Back in its heyday, the Jiang Family had been a powerful force. The Yu and An families had been subordinate branches of the Jiang Family. However, after the Jiang Family's main lineage fell from power, several surrounding immortal gates had quietly pushed its downfall, leaving it shattered.

The Yu Family had been the greatest beneficiary of the Jiang Family's collapse, producing numerous talents over the following decades and rising to prominence. Yet Jiang Heqian, through a century of patience, had methodically delivered his revenge, returning the favor in full.

As the initial wave of disbelief passed, Li Ximing mulled it over and found that the plan was indeed feasible. The Jiang Family's inheritance likely included techniques for concealing one's aura. While these techniques might not fool Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of equal rank, they were more than enough to deceive Qi Cultivators.

After Yu Xiaogui's death, the Yu Family no longer had any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. No one remained who could uncover Jiang Heqian's true cultivation level. Even spies from other factions, at most possessing moderate cultivation, would not have been able to see through him.

Ingenious... truly ingenious... Li Ximing praised inwardly.

Jiang Heqian seemed thoroughly satisfied with the expression on Li Ximing's face, as if savoring the gratification of a long-sought revenge. He let out a hearty laugh, pointing northward, and said with a smirk, "Well? With Yu Mugao's head and this grand gift, does your clan find it satisfactory?"

His laughter grew wilder, carrying a hint of madness, but he eventually calmed, his tone turning somewhat regretful. "It is just a pity... Daoist Tongya and Wangbai cannot witness this with their own eyes. It would have made the revenge all the sweeter!"
