# Chapter 843: The Scheme Of Golden Feather Sect

Great Ning Palace.

Li Xuanfeng adjusted his breath mid-air for a while, while Si Yuanli stood with his sword in hand. He kept one arm behind his back as he silently gazed at the crystalline pillar of light that pierced the heavens and earth.

The Dao lineage of Ning State is renowned for its use of True Essence, often in conjunction with talismanic arts, with many cultivators practicing talismans and shamanic paths. Anhuai Heaven has never been opened before, so there must be quite a few treasures inside.

He was in no hurry. The grotto heaven was vast, and many formations remained intact. It was far beyond what Great Ning Palace could compare to. Being early or late by fifteen minutes didn’t matter.

Si Yuanli was still in thought, when suddenly the world seemed to dim slightly. The crystalline light pillar flickered faintly. He furrowed his brows, but everything quickly returned to normal.

“Hmm?”

Suddenly, a golden glow faintly lit up the sky. Si Yuanli froze in surprise. Glancing down, he saw the clear lake surface rolling with waves of white mist as tiny lotus flowers burst forth and rapidly bloomed in full.

“This...”

As he stood dazed, endless pink lotus blossoms crowded and collided across the lake’s surface. Auspicious heavenly glow rose at the horizon. Only then did Si Yuanli belatedly lift his head.

The sky was now filled with boundless gold, as fine golden dust fell like sand. An enormous celestial figure was now reflected in his pupils. A majestic yet benevolent golden face filled nearly the entire sky, breaking through the clouds as if the heavens themselves had collapsed. Its eyes, shimmering with golden lacquer, slowly descended into Great Ning Palace.

“Maha...!?” Si Yuanli cried out in pain, hurriedly shutting his eyes. Crimson tears of blood welled at the corners of his eyes and streamed down his cheeks. His heart was filled with terror and shock as he said, “Have I gone mad!?”

Li Xuanfeng opened his eyes at almost the same moment. A muffled boom like thunder rang out, golden-white light flashed, and Si Yuanli coughed up a mouthful of blood.

He screwed his eyes shut and clutched at his chest with one hand as he forced out a whisper. “Honored Daoist Masters...”

The sky burst into a kaleidoscope of color. Yellow, orange, red, and purple filled the sky. Hazy halos bloomed one after another as vague flames surged forth. Silhouettes descended in quick succession, and in the blink of an eye, a slender hand reached out and a white-clothed woman stepped through.

Splash...

She had just flown into the air when a misty white rain began to fall, delicate and ethereal. It was quite beautiful.

But the two had no mind to admire it. As the white rain brushed past them, the spirit wind beneath Li Xuanfeng's feet vanished like winter snow. His footing gave way, and when he instinctively tried to summon mana, not a trace of spirit wind responded.

It’s the Water Mansion... thought Li Xuanfeng.

He crashed onto the stone platform, shattering the tiles beneath him. Si Yuanli fared even worse, slamming down beside him with a heavy thud, his face flushing red.

Li Xuanfeng looked up, but the white-clothed woman had already vanished. They had been merely brushed by her divine ability, but the wind beneath their feet had been entirely dispersed, leaving them momentarily unable to fly.

Si Yuanli struggled twice before he managed to rise. His eyes were still shut, blood pouring out in streams, dripping down his cheeks as he murmured, “Brother Xuanfeng! They’ve all made their move...”

The radiant lights overhead surged toward the central cliff, painting the sky with strange phenomena. Li Xuanfeng watched Si Yuanli take out a jade vial and drop two drops into each eye before finally opening them slightly.

Li Xuanfeng felt the tremors underfoot and rose to his feet. “There’s likely going to be trouble inside Anhuai Heaven.”

Si Yuanli chuckled twice and muttered, “Trouble? This is beyond that... we should be thankful just to be alive...”

He hadn’t even finished speaking when another bearded immortal streaked across the sky. Torrents of True Flame surged through the air, evaporating swathes of lakewater and sending fiery sparks scattering. Si Yuanli was forced to shut his mouth, raise his hands, and summon mana to defend himself. His face was twisted from the heat, and his palms sizzled audibly.

Even the dullest among them could now see that there was no sense in heading for Anhuai Heaven anymore. They would likely be burned to ashes by True Flame or have their bodies eroded by Water Mansion. It would be an end without a corpse or soul.

As for the majority of cultivators who had already entered, they could only pray their sect’s Daoist Masters were inside as well. Otherwise, no one even needed to target them. Just standing in the grotto heaven would be enough, for not even a trace of their true soul would remain in a few moments.

“So this is why we weren’t supposed to enter...”

Si Yuanli had only glimpsed a Maha unleash his full power, and been grazed by the divine abilities of a few other Daoist Masters. He was already bleeding profusely and gravely injured. The flesh of both his palms were sizzling as they tried to fight the searing True Flame, yet he still gritted his teeth in bitter relief, “Thank goodness... thank goodness we rested beforehand...”

Li Xuanfeng also endured the searing True Flame with gritted teeth. Though he and Si Yuanli had narrowly escaped disaster, his expression remained grim as he asked in a deep voice, “Brother Yuanli! This is no time for relief! How do we get out of Great Ning Palace?”

“Out of Great Ning Palace?” Si Yuanli wiped the blood from his face and shook his head. “Without a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to receive us, you and I will die trapped in this damned place!”

As expected...

Li Xuanfeng’s heart sank. Si Yuanli lowered his voice and said, “We must hide quickly... You have the Huai River Map. If things truly become dire, unfurl it. It should preserve your life!”

He stabbed his longsword into the ground. One palm pressed flat against the hilt, he tapped the balde with the fingers of his other hand as he intoned, “Complete Yuan Escape Spell, seek aid from the Nether World!”

The sword immediately radiated with light. The ground beneath them split open wide before Li Xuanfeng’s eyes. Si Yuanli gave a slight nod and began burrowing into the earth.

Li Xuanfeng let the spell art guide him. After sinking for roughly fifteen minutes, they finally reached the bottom. Pitch-black stone walls appeared around him; it was an enclosed chamber no larger than a small hut, with neatly squared stone surfaces.

He suddenly noticed Si Yuanli looked shorter. Upon closer inspection, he saw that Si Yuanli’s lower body was still embedded in the stone. His face was pale, with a stream of mana held tightly in his chest.

Boom!

Li Xuanfeng immediately understood, striking the stone with his palm to extract Si Yuanli’s bloodied lower body. The moment mana began circulating, the wounds on Si Yuanli’s legs rapidly healed.

“The spiritual energy here is unusual... It’s no wonder I made a misstep...” He coughed once, then laughed heartily, “Brother Xuanfeng, your caution has saved both our lives!”

Si Yuanli didn’t suspect that Li Xuanfeng had anticipated anything. After all, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Mahas that they saw were clearly beyond any forecast. Clearly something so catastrophic had occurred that even mighty cultivators were forced to intervene. If even Daoist Masters couldn’t foresee it, how could Li Xuanfeng?

“You flatter me, Brother Yuanli.” Li Xuanfeng watched as he took out pills to heal and replied softly, “If not for that brief delay, even had we entered the grotto heaven, you would still have been protected by your sect’s Daoist Master. Nothing too serious would have happened.”

Si Yuanli was momentarily stunned by those words. He didn’t know what to think, but he replied gently, “Our sect’s Daoist Master may treat his own kindly, but it’s always best to trouble them as little as possible.”

Li Xuanfeng’s thoughts were elsewhere. He spoke in a low, calm voice, “It’s a pity that Chi Tianxing and Chi Fuju from the Chi Family... now have no Chi Family cultivators to shield them within the grotto heaven...”

Before he could finish, Si Yuanli burst into laughter. “I forgot about those two bastards! What a delight! Serves them right!”

Li Xuanfeng lowered his gaze, fingers gripping his golden bow so tightly they turned pale. Meanwhile, Si Yuanli continued laughing in satisfaction. “These two were the most promising of the younger Chi Family generation, and now both are gone! I’d love to see... what talents Chi Zhiyun can turn to next!”

The great void.

The great void was shrouded in endless darkness. Gradually, a harmonious and beautiful arc began to glow, revealing its form within the void. The shape of Anhuai Heaven grew clearer and brighter, becoming the most prominent feature in that space.

More and more gazes turned toward Anhuai Heaven, staring through its transparent and beautiful barrier to observe what lay within. Lu Jiangxian’s divine sense hovered within the great void. It took only the slightest movement for it to slip inside.

Lu Jiangxian’s divine sense was far superior to mere spiritual sense. While the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were still speculating whether Anhuai Heaven even existed, he could already see its form. Now that Anhuai Heaven had fully manifested and others were only just gaining clarity, he had already entered without needing to pass through Great Ning Palace.

After the incident with the five True Monarchs of Green Pine Temple, he had become confident that even Golden Core Realm cultivators couldn’t detect his divine sense. Reassured, he sent a wisp of his divine sense drifting into Anhuai Heaven, where it landed above a small lake.

The lake was only two and a half kilometers across, its waters rippling with a bluish-white radiance. Yet it didn’t seem quite like water, drifting upward like mist before being drawn back by the formation at the lake’s edge.

A grayish-white stone stele inscribed with several ancient seal characters stood at the lake’s edge.

Daling Lake. Lu Jiangxian took one look and immediately recognized it, River Pure Qi

This lake was formed entirely of River Pure Qi. Li Tongya used this very qi for Qi Cultivation, but just a small vial had cost him dozens of spirit stones. Yet here in Anhuai Heaven, there was an entire lake of it, likely intended for cultivators of the Pit Water Dao to refine their techniques.

Just as Lu Jiangxian paused to observe, two figures flew in from the sky and stopped at the same spot. The one in front was a female cultivator in golden robes, her eyes bright and gentle. Behind her stood a figure cloaked in black, faintly shrouded in golden haze.

“Qiushui and Chang Yun...”

The two landed in front of him, but they were unable to see him. They both looked up at the lake. A look of admiration appeared on Qiushui’s face as Daoist Master Chang Yun used mana to transmit his voice, “Ancestor... This Anhuai Heaven is rather strange... we can’t extend our spiritual sense at all... and the formations are still intact... who knows how long it will take to find what we need...”

Daoist Master Qiushui nodded slightly and revealed a golden pearl in her hand, releasing a mist-like golden glow that enveloped the two of them. Then she spoke softly, “No one could’ve expected it would turn out like this... what a pity. Tianque, Tianyuan, and I went through all that secret planning just to protect Zhong Qian... and in the end, there’s no use for him...”

The two did not linger and rose swiftly into the air. Though they were suppressed by the grotto heaven, making their speed modest, Daoist Master Chang Yun chuckled and said, “Ancestor... Zhong Qian is a gentlemanly sort and easy to handle. That’s why we chose him in the first place. Even if he’s not useful here in the grotto heaven, he’ll be a major asset once he establishes a sect in Jiangbei. Who knows? He might even help reform our devil sect into something more like the immortal path...”

Daoist Master Qiushui smiled gently and replied, “That’s true... Xu State is currently empty and pure, with exceptionally rich spiritual energy. Don’t let the efforts and calculations of your grandmaster and me go to waste.”

Their conversation showed clear familiarity, and it turned out that Daoist Master Chang Yun was her junior. His tone carried great respect.

“Of course. It’s just a shame...”

They casually gathered treasures from the palace on the lake’s small island. The items were precious, but no longer of real value to those at the Purple Mansion Realm. Zhang Qiushui kept her focus on detecting any signs of combat.

Meanwhile, Daoist Master Chang Yun sighed softly and said, “Seeing this whole lake of River Pure Qi reminds me of something... Back when we were setting up the plan, I casually placed a piece and handed the River Mountain Sutra to Li Tongya. I thought him exceptional, and suited to the image of a river beast. He might’ve been able to unravel it. But then Maha meddled...

“Later, we saw Li Yuanjiao making swift progress in cultivation. He was ambitious and a true schemer. He might have been capable of stirring up northern Azure Pond, crossing the great river, uniting Jiangbei, and doing something grand. But he died inside the grotto heaven...”
𝗳𝗿𝐞𝕖𝘄𝗲𝕓𝗻𝚘𝚟𝕖𝐥.𝚌𝕠𝕞

Lu Jiangxian sharpened his gaze, and in that moment, saw through Chang Yun’s disguise to a clear view of the man’s face. He looked ordinary, but had a sharp, fierce gaze. A blade was hidden within his robes, suppressed and ready.

So it was you... Lu Jiangxian sighed inwardly. Chang Yun... Zhang Yun.

The man before him was none other than Zhang Yun of the Golden Feather Sect! He had entered seclusion years ago to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Not only had he succeeded in just twenty years, he had even infiltrated the ranks of Eastern Sea’s devil cultivators!

In an instant, all the scattered clues aligned. Why had the Golden Feather Sect spread the Blood Dharma Manual during the devil plague? Why had Chimen Difu, a devil cultivator, known the Golden Feather Sect’s techniques?

Clearly, this had been planned years ago. To avoid suspicion, they had secretly stolen the Blood Dharma Manual from the Miao Family of the Southern Sea, quietly gathered a group of devil cultivators, and converted several northern disciples of the sect, like Chimen Difu and Zhang Huaide, into devil cultivators and scattered them across Jiangbei...

It was all for the moment Zhang Yun achieved his breakthrough; he could immediately rally a loyal force of devil cultivators and instantly alter the balance between north and south. Leveraging the chaotic situation in Xu State, he fabricated the identity of Daoist Master Chang Yun and justified the establishment of his own sect.

It also explained why Zhong Qian, who was supposedly dead and his dharma artifact long divided, had suddenly reappeared among devil cultivators. Naturally, the Golden Feather Sect had secretly protected him, grooming him as a pawn for this very day, so he could enter Anhuai Heaven!

“Furthermore, as the founder of a sect and a key figure in the northern-southern struggle, Chang Yun could even claim a spot in Great Ning Palace. If everything went according to plan, the specially preserved Zhong Qian would shine brightly within Anhuai Heaven and seize countless treasures...

“This plot would allow Golden Feather to not only gain two entrance slots, but also secretly establish their own sect in fertile Jiangbei. It would secure the northern flank... and ferry endless spirit herbs and spirit items from the spiritual-energy-rich Jiangbei into the Golden Feather Sect...

“This was the Golden Feather Sect’s century-long plan... A hundred years ago, they foresaw the Shangyuan breakthrough, predicted inevitable chaos in Jiangbei, and how several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would join forces. They began planning in secret, and now, at last, the fruits have begun to ripen.”




# Chapter 845: Palace of Enlightened Dao

Lu Jiangxian remained only as a wisp of divine sense as the two conversed. Though he couldn’t act physically, it allowed him to pass unnoticed right beside Daoist Master Chang Yun and Daoist Master Qiushui.

He did not linger. His divine sense roamed, sensing waves of magical powers clashing. Many familiar faces of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators appeared here and there.

These cultivators hailed from both the north and the south, but they were mainly Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and those Merciful Ones. His divine sense swept through the surroundings and rose high into the sky. He saw countless blue-black grand halls, some encircling lakes, and others stacked like fish scales upon mountain ridges. Clouds billowed throughout, and colorful arrays were interwoven in a landscape of boundless grandeur.

Several grotto heavens in the south had already been opened. Chu Yi had forcibly broken through Eastfire Heaven alone, thus it lacked prohibitions. Mirage Mirror Heaven had connections to many southern Dao lineages. But Anhuai Heaven was the first grotto heaven to remain fully intact till the present.

Most of the formations in Anhuai Heaven weren’t independent, but rather sub-arrays affixed to the foundational grand formation inscribed deep into the grotto heaven itself. Though time had weakened it somewhat, its structure remained firm.

These were naturally problems for the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to worry about. Lu Jiangxian, however, moved freely, and was able to observe nearly half the entire grotto heaven.

He frowned slightly and thought, Jinlian and Zhelu... where have they gone?

Those Mahas were not to be underestimated. Jinlian was a Maha of seven lifetimes, and only someone like Zipei in Jiangnan could match her. Their movements could decide the entire balance within the grotto heaven. It was of great importance.

However, even after scanning the area twice, he still couldn’t find them. Growing suspicious, he sent his divine sense to linger in Anhuai Heaven’s highest point, the Anhuai Hall. The Metallic Essence remained safely on the celestial throne. It shimmered faintly from the fluctuation of Purple Mansion Realm divine arts nearby, but it bore no sign of being touched.

There was a glowing official seal emanating quiet brilliance next to the throne. Four large characters were engraved beneath, Jiang Family of Huaining.

Though divine sense could not move spiritual items, he had cultivated the immortal technique True Insight Profound Method from Mirage Mirror Heaven. Manipulating the Metallic Essence would be easy. Lu Jiangxian could have entered Anhuai Hall and taken the essence for himself. But it would require him to reveal his true form to take it.

But how could the Upper Sect Mount Luoxia not be watching something like this? The southern Underworld specializes in gathering Metallic Essence. Could they be watching from the great void right now? Perhaps some pact gives the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators a chance to fight over it... but if I take the Metallic Essence like this, I’ll surely die, thought Lu Jiangxian.

He had never intended to take it. Instead, he continued gliding swiftly through the grotto heaven. The many formations might as well have been air as they parted before him. He soon passed over numerous celestial halls and radiant treasures, before halting in front of a tall, circular altar-shaped hall.

A radiant plaque hung above the hall, its brushstrokes flowing like dragons and phoenixes. It was clearly a dharma artifact itself, inscribed with several ancient seal characters.

Palace of Enlightened Dao.
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝘦𝓌𝑒𝑏𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝘭.𝒸𝘰𝑚

Dharma light glowed brightly inside the hall. Jade slips floated quietly on shelves, suspended and reinforced by multiple formations. Evenly spaced and neatly arranged, they stretched along a grand brown rack that extended deep into the palace.

The Palace of Enlightened Dao was circular in design, rising higher toward the center, and divided into six tiers. The outermost ring stretched into seeming infinity, and was dotted with starlike crystalline lights that glimmered across the towering, endless brown racks.

The centermost tier was only the size of an ordinary room, and had jade slips placed upon desks. Five silver desks encircled a central cylindrical jade platform, upon which a single translucent, radiant immortal slip hovered silently.

So this is it... The full legacy of Ning State’s Dao lineage... all cultivation methods of Anhuai Heaven, gathered here!

He stepped over the densely packed luminous jade slips at his feet and landed at the center. The platform beneath him was a pale gray, streaked with crystalline patterns that pulsed faintly, like breathing.

Clearly, some profound formation was carved into this platform and still functioning loyally after a thousand years, yet it hadn’t detected anyone's presence. Lu Jiangxian calmly stepped inside, gazing at the immortal slip at the center.

His divine sense touched it lightly, and as expected, a restriction was hidden within. The royal family of Ning State was indeed cautious. Even after laying a grand formation over the central platform, they still embedded a seal within the immortal slip itself.

The restriction glowed with crystal clarity. A wisp of divine mana coiled around it, subtly connected to the altar below, and even further, to the vast formation spanning the entire grotto heaven.

Lu Jiangxian hesitated for a second, but ultimately refrained from forcefully probing its contents. Instead, he shifted his divine sense across the surrounding desks and began reading carefully.

Fortunately, the remaining manuals were evidently for the daily cultivation of Anhuai Heaven’s disciples. The formations could be unlocked with enough merit or permission. A few encrypted arts were simple enough, so he easily saw through them.

“Purple Mansion Realm techniques... These are indeed genuine Purple Mansion Realm methods...” he muttered.

Lu Jiangxian frowned as he read. All five were based on the True Essence Dao. It was extremely high in grade, and clearly part of a complete set. Their qi-gathering methods were exceedingly refined but demanded near-impossible precision. It required even the buildings of Anhuai Heaven to assist.

“At this point, there’s no way to gather qi as required... I can only take them as reference... In the end, they are Purple Mansion Realm methods, after all.”

He speculated that the central immortal slip was likely yet another True Essence technique. Losing interest, he shifted his gaze downward to the vast array of other methods and spells below.

While Lu Jiangxian quietly enjoyed the fruits of the Palace of Enlightened Dao, chaos had long erupted throughout Anhuai Heaven.

The True Monarch who had founded this grotto heaven cultivated the True Essence Dao. The sky shimmered with crystalline hues, and faint traces of formation patterns could be seen flowing downward, creating a beautiful, ethereal scene.

Yuan Xiu stood above a grand hall with a gloomy expression. The golden glow in his hand flickered faintly but remained dormant. A cultivator before him stood with arms folded, speaking in a low tone, “Senior Si, this place belongs to our Mount Changhuai.”

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Mount Changhuai floated midair, calmly watching him. Yuan Xiu’s face darkened, but not because of the hall in question.

Though Anhuai Heaven was once grand, the Jiang Family had gradually declined. Their Golden Core Realm cultivator had disappeared early on, and Anhuai Heaven had slowly faded from the manifest world. The family had already withdrawn before even the final Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had perished. Only that last Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could still enter the grotto heaven.

When that final Purple Mansion Realm cultivator died a violent death, Anhuai Heaven had fully vanished. Most treasures valuable to Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had long been exhausted, and only a few spirit artifacts and items remained. If not for the recent discovery of Metallic Essence, none of this current chaos would’ve erupted.

His dark expression wasn’t due to greed for what lay within the hall. If the Metallic Essence truly resided there, the disturbance caused by opening it would be far beyond what Mount Changhuai’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivators could conceal. Finding it first wouldn’t mean claiming it.

Nor was he upset by Mount Changhuai slighting him so openly. What truly unsettled him was the deeper message saying that his old friends had all passed. Alone, Yuan Xiu was now weak and isolated. He was no longer well regarded by these younger cultivators.

Though he often quarreled with Yuan Su and found him distasteful, if a junior had dared say such words before them, Yuan Su would’ve slapped the offender and cursed him to his face.

That idiot’s done it more than once, too...

The image of Yuan Su flashed through his mind, but Si Boxiu, his true name, quickly forced it away. He turned his gloomy gaze toward the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Changhuai. But after a moment, he said nothing, simply flicking his sleeve and leaving in silence.

He had only taken two steps when his divine power, Words of Hidden Perception, stirred faintly. Instantly stepping back, the golden talisman in his hand surged to life, blocking the beam of golden light coming straight at him.

Two radiant dharma bodies shot out before him; they were both glowing gold. One had four arms and four legs, with two faces on its neck. One of the faces was grinning, and the other one weeping. The figure held various dharma artifacts in its hands.

The other had two eyes on his face and a three on his chest. He gazed coldly, his arms arranged like a lotus bloom. It was he who had launched the golden attack just now.

“Nuzi, Five-Eyed...”

Si Boxiu was already simmering with frustration. But this incident was like a spark that had lit his fuse. His eyes turned dark, and countless tiny incantation symbols that were fine as sand surged like a river across his eyes.

His voice overlapped with itself as he snarled, “You bald donkeys think you’ve got the guts for this? Who else dares!”

“Fellow Daoist Yuan Xiu... no need to be rash...” Nuzi, the Merciful One, appeared completely calm and temperless. All of his faces smiled at once, as his voice rant out like a chant of scripture, “We can speak peacefully... All I ask is that you vow never to interfere with Li Xuanfeng again... Let me fulfill this little wish of salvation... and I shall trouble you no more within this grotto heaven.”

Si Boxiu had always detested Buddhist cultivators. Rage surged in his chest. How could he listen to such drivel? His voice boomed like spring thunder, “Keep dreaming!”

The golden talisman in his hand flared to life, unleashing a golden veil of light like falling rain. Complex runes burst forth; this was his famed Profound Yellow Dao Talisman. Yuan Xiu began to chant softly, “Preserve the talisman in the belly, draw protection from the hidden source, divine command, Conceal.”

In that instant, the radiance on the two Merciful Ones dulled beneath a veil of ash. The colorful and golden halos behind their heads dimmed, and the entire sky seemed to fade to gray. All the scattered spiritual light was drawn into the talisman.

Nuzi’s spell flickered twice in his hand. He gestured, but nothing formed. The golden blade that should have appeared failed to manifest. Anger twisted across both of his faces as he sneered, “A powerful divine art, indeed!”

He shook his arm, and the golden blade came flying out. Half of it was still embedded in his own dharma body, like a venomous tongue biting into his limb. When he noticed that Five-Eyed was still standing idly, he hastily transmitted a message, “Five-Eyed! Act with me now! As long as we injure him, the effect is the same... Once it’s done, that fruit is yours without question!”

The Five-Eyed Merciful One nodded deeply. The three eyes on his chest radiated a violet-blue glow. His expression was focused and calm, but inwardly, he was scheming, I’ve long heard this man is a standout even among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. His mastery of talismans often wounds people by surprise... I wonder how badly he can hurt me. Ideally, he’ll injure me severely enough that I can fake near-death and slip away to cultivate in seclusion.

He hadn’t joined this mess for some fruit. Yu Mujian had fallen at Moongaze Lake, and in his panic, he had miscalculated to the point of nearly sending himself to death. Now that a glimmer of hope appeared, he was filled with anxiety.

He had made bold promises before that superior and claimed he would handle things cleanly. But on the surface, he still had to seek revenge against Li Xijun. If anyone sensed something amiss, and that superior caught wind of it, he’d be done for.

After much deliberation, he settled on a plan of joining forces with Nuzi. Outwardly, he acted greedy and hesitant, but inwardly he hoped Yuan Xiu would strike him down quickly so he’d have an excuse to retreat north and lie low.

Nuzi had no idea how many mental backflips the man beside him had done. But when he saw Five-Eyed truly act, he exhaled in relief and thought, Thankfully, this idiot desperately needs the fruit. Looks like this will go smoothly after all!

Si Boxiu was in the midst of casting a divine technique when three beams of violet-blue light shot toward him. His expression darkened, and he flipped his palm over, forming a new spell as he murmured, “He who hears the Dao, void and emptiness, beware the deviant Dao, all ends in nothingness.”

When he turned his palm back up, a mass of milky-white qi had formed in it. The beams struck it, and Si Boxiu furrowed his brow slightly. He forced his hand to close around it and tossed the qi aside, unraveling the spell with ease.

The three eyes on Five-Eyed Merciful One’s chest blinked. He tried to replicate the spell twice, only to realize he’d already forgotten how to cast it. Both shocked and delighted, he shouted theatrically, “Nuzi! How is this man so powerful?! You dare trick me into fighting him to the death over a mere spirit fruit?! What logic is that?!”

Nuzi, having just resolved a spell himself, suddenly swelled in size. Many arms appeared across his body, each forming a different weapon. He muttered via sound transmission, “Don’t play dumb, damn you! How many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from that era were ever simple? Yuan Su, Yuan Xiu, Zipei and Qiushui were all titans! If he’s not famous, it’s only because Duanmu Kui and Donghua overshadowed him!”

Of course Five-Eyed knew all this; he was just playing coy, angling for more. He replied with a transmission, “I’m done! I’m done! This old monk refuses to fight anymore!”

“If you want more, I’ll pay you more!” Naturally, Nuzi saw through him and replied coldly. Though the two Merciful Ones appeared united, they were still bargaining in secret.

Si Boxiu could see right through them and sneered, “A rabble of fools!”

He was about to unleash another divine art when his expression suddenly froze. He looked up, studied something carefully, then abruptly withdrew his energy and placed his hands behind his back, face dark and silent.

The two Merciful Ones also sensed something and raised their heads, only to see a man materialize before them.

The newcomer had youthful features and wore azure robes. His sleeves fluttered, as his loose long hair swayed in the wind. His eyes were pale teal, and he was surrounded by glimmering green shadows.

He stood with hands behind his back, his expression calm and unhurried. He glanced over casually and spoke softly, “Uncle, it truly has been many years.”




# Chapter 847: Immortal Threshold

"Late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm..."

Yuan Xiu’s gaze lingered on the sword-wielding man before him. His attire was identical to that of Si Boxiu; it was the attire of Azure Pond Sect’s first-tier Purple Mansion Realm. Yuan Su never liked wearing them, but Yuan Xiu never took them off.

"Chi Buzi..."
𝘧𝓇ℯ𝑒𝓌𝑒𝑏𝓃𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝒸ℴ𝓂

Late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, four divine abilities!

The man did not have the usual narrow-eyed, flat-browed face of Chi Family members. His features were sharper and his eyes were larger and more striking. His cultivation was complete and forceful, emanating a fierce presence.

Si Boxiu was silent at first as he calculated. Chi Buzi had just turned three hundred, yet his form already shimmered with layered reflections, revealing the unique balance of clarity and murkiness of Pristine Water. His aura was even more terrifying than Si Boxiu’s own.

He disappeared for decades, and shows up having crossed the Purple Immortal Threshold as if it were nothing...

A century ago, Chi Buzi was a genius of Azure Pond Sect, progressing at a frightening pace. After breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm with Heavy Murk, he swiftly cultivated divine abilities. He cultivated Spring’s Echo and then Clear Dusk Rain, in under a hundred years!

Chi Wei had held him in high esteem, calling him the Treasure Tree of the Chi Family. That bastard dared to brazenly sweep up geniuses across the lands, all because he had Chi Buzi backing him.

Too bad Buzi doesn’t follow the old man’s script...

Later, Chi Buzi broke through to the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. Yuan Xiu thought he would stop there, but in the decades that followed, whether he mastered Purging Dew or Chougui Hidden Form, he had somehow reached the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm.

One must understand that the Shenyang Mansion stabilized once three divine abilities were formed in the Purple Mansion Realm. The fourth divine ability was extremely difficult, so getting stuck for a hundred years was common. In the immortal path, this was called crossing the Purple Immortal Threshold.

Si Boxiu himself had been stuck at that threshold for nearly a hundred years. He had only broken through to the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm after Chi Wei’s death. Thus, he knew full well how hard it was.

The immortal threshold seemed like nothing to him... what kind of fortune did he gain in the Eastern Sea... Si Boxiu’s aged eyes were grave as he replied coldly, "Buzi, your cultivation has truly advanced."

Chi Buzi, however, was all grace and ease. He lifted his sword slightly, smiling as he said, "Uncle overpraises me. Let’s first deal with these four fools."

His gaze turned to the two Merciful Ones before him. One hand formed a seal at his waist and the other gripped his sword like a talisman blade.

Divine energy flowed as he said, "Respectfully summon the Weak Ugly Ding Water."

His words fell into the air, transforming into gray light that burst from between his lips and landed on the sword hilt. It clashed with the golden blade and rippled outward in waves of gray radiance.

"Humph..."

Ugly Ding corresponded to Weak and Dissolving among the heavenly stems, governing the clarity of one’s artifact sense. The remaining two Merciful Ones could no longer remain hidden in midair. They burst forth at once, radiating colorful light. They were both Golden Body cultivators and massive in form. They simultaneously struck at him with their palms.

Chi Buzi even had time to glance back and laugh lightly. "Uncle, all these Merciful Ones wield borrowed divine arts from the same mold. In the end, they are still borrowed..."

He spun lightly, and his azure robes fluttered as he vanished. He reappeared behind the two Merciful Ones, raising his sword with a grin. "Borrowed power is never your own. Once seen, it’s easy to deal with."

His magic sword released two rays of clear light, suppressing the colorful radiance around the two Merciful Ones. He spoke casually, "Next, you’ll need to form seals."

The words struck the Merciful Ones hard. A flicker of hesitation crossed their golden-painted faces. They had half-formed their seals with seven or eight hands, but now they were stuck. They were unable to press on or abandon them.

Chi Buzi reversed his sword and lifted it, laughing. "Trash!"

His azure sword erupted in a cascade of sharp currents, and tens of thousands of blades blasted forward. The two Merciful Ones screamed and retreated. Five-Eyed, watching from the side, eyes blazing with golden light, instantly abandoned Si Boxiu, who was still holding back. He flung out two golden rings and hurled them at Chi Buzi.

When Chi Buzi revealed himself, Nuzi the Merciful One was already wavering, torn between retreat and delay. When he saw Five-Eyed strike with full force, he made up his mind and moved to hold off Si Boxiu.

Just then, a thunderous roar echoed through the sky. A blazing red light streaked across the air at lightning speed, appearing before them in an instant. Only after it arrived did the voice catch up, echoing slowly, "Bald donkey!"

"Daoist Master Hengli of Hengzhu Dao Gate..."

Si Boxiu’s ears twitched. He immediately recognized the man from his voice and sighed inwardly. His plan to probe Chi Buzi’s strength was clearly for naught now. He struck without hesitation, his talisman spraying countless golden chains toward Nuzi the Merciful One.

This is bad... Just hearing the voice sent a chill through Nuzi’s heart. Hengzhu Dao Gate had always stood opposed to Buddhist cultivators, and Hengli was notoriously vengeful. When he saw him arrive in force, especially with three Purple Mansion cultivators present. Nuzi panicked like a rabbit, abandoning Five-Eyed and bolting away.

Who knew Five-Eyed would be just as terrified, cursing inwardly, Why is that lunatic here too?! I agreed to be injured, not to die!

He swept the field with spiritual sense and confirmed his fears. Nuzi had fled, and the brothers Shike and Shien had also vanished. He made a snap decision, stepped back, and turned into golden light, soaring upward.

"Bald donkey!" Daoist Master Hengli roared like a ferocious tiger. He struck the golden light with a palm, making Five-Eyed stagger. He said coldly, "Way of Emptiness? Come on then..."

The Buddhist cultivators all scattered in panic as Chi Buzi rode the wind back. Si Boxiu hesitated whether to pursue Nuzi, but unlike Hengli, he bore no deep grudge against the Buddhist cultivators. He had no desire for such thankless labor.

As they watched the fire-wreathed Hengli give chase, Chi Buzi landed beside Yuan Xiu and said casually, "Hengli truly loathes the Buddhist cultivators!"

Both men understood well. Hengzhu Dao Gate had always despised Buddhist cultivators. Years ago, when Murong Xia had traveled south to seek enlightenment, he happened to seduce a direct disciple of Hengzhu Dao Gate. Three Purple Mansion Realm elders struck out in revenge but returned in defeat. It quickly became the talk of the town. Since they had grudges both old and new, it was no wonder Hengli harbored such hatred.

Yuan Xiu didn’t respond, instead saying sternly, "Now you’re finally willing to show yourself?"

Chi Buzi seemed used to his tone. He stepped slightly behind, one hand holding his sword, laying its blade flat across his other palm. He kept his eyes on the sword’s engravings as he said, "Uncle... I didn’t come here out of greed for Metallic Essence..."

He grinned as he said softly, "First, since Metallic Essence was left behind in Anhuai Heaven, it means that the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator must have died suddenly. Besides the essence everyone wants, who knows what ancient spirit artifacts might be inside? I figured I’d stop by for a look.

"Second... as you know, our sect only has two Purple Mansion Realm techniques. Even counting the Ning Family’s Pristine Spring Profound Cave Sutra, that’s only three. The remaining two are truly hard to find, so I hoped to check here."

There was indeed merit to the idea of finding techniques in Anhuai Heaven. Though the Jiang Family had brought out many copies, most originals were still kept safest within the grotto heaven. Since that Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had seemingly died suddenly, many techniques might remain untouched, so there really could be one aligned with the Pristine Water Dao.

Yuan Xiu heard his words, but his mind was struck by the hidden implication. His heart thundered, and disbelief flickered in his eyes. He muttered, "I see... so you cultivated all four Daos on your own!"

"Naturally." Chi Buzi smiled gently as he lowered his gaze, "I may lack in other areas, but I have plenty of ambition. True Monarch Shangyuan cultivated by his own nature and became a True Monarch. I tried to learn from him and I’ve made some progress."

Yuan Xiu’s heart was tangled. Hands clasped behind his back, he said nothing, thinking of his senior brother Yuan Su. Yuan Su had never asked the Chi Family for a single technique, even unto death.

After a few moments, he finally responded, "To acquire Purple Mansion Realm techniques on your own... that’s something, at least."

Chi Buzi smiled and simply replied, "Uncle, you flatter me...”

Dense formation patterns in the sky gradually lit up as they conversed and flew northward. Three pitch-black fissures appeared. The entire formation shuddered slightly, but with no one controlling it, it could only resist through its built-in instructions.

Countless golden eyes lit up within the darkness. Then came innumerable massive hands that started to pull at the edges. A golden dharma body strained with all its might to push inward, producing thunderous collision sounds.

Boom!

Daoist Master Chi Buzi studied the scene carefully, then turned and said, "I was wondering why Maha hadn’t acted yet. Turns out this Immortal Dao formation sensed him and kept him sealed outside for more than fifteen minutes!"

Though his tone was joking, his footwork technique picked up speed. Yuan Xiu also glanced up once before passing through the grotto heaven and stopping before a tall, rounded altar-like dome.

Chi Buzi halted instantly and looked up. White steps led to a blue hall, glowing faintly with floating white mist. Above the entrance hung a bright plaque, on which a few ancient seal characters were inscribed in golden strokes.

He took in the scenery before him and nodded, "Uncle, shall we go together? It seems to be the Palace of Enlightened Dao within Anhuai Heaven up ahead."

Yuan Xiu looked up at the formation. No one had entered yet. He wasn't very interested in cultivation techniques but did want to examine the spell arts. While nothing passed down by a True Monarch would be kept here, it would still be worth studying for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

He nodded and said, "Lead the way."

Buzi smiled slightly and replied, "I understand formations a little, but I can’t compare to Uncle's formation breaking talisman techniques. Your skills were already famed across Yue State back when you cultivated at Moongaze Lake. I rarely got to witness them myself; now I finally get to see it for real!"

————

The Great River.
𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎

The Great River surged with mighty waves, flowing from the west into Lake Xian, dividing the land into north and south. The spray was so white and crystal-clear that the whole scene was breathtakingly beautiful.

Cultivators moved about the riverbank. A beam of bright light descended from the south, stopping at the formation along the shore. A young cultivator emerged, standing on radiant light under his feet that drew many stares.

Li Ximing had stayed here for several months and was growing familiar with the place. The cultivators on either side stepped aside at his descent and greeted him respectfully, "Greetings, Daoist!"

He held a small white disc, about the size of a palm, engraved densely with markings. It was divided evenly into three sections, each with distinct patterns. This was the dharma artifact he had exchanged for using the devil jar. Called Guiyang, it was a solid defensive artifact, also taken from a devil cultivator and given to him easily by the Ning Family.

Guiyang was forged from spirit items of the Lesser Yang attribute, mixed with a trace of True Flame essence. Clearly, its previous owner had been a devil cultivator of the Purple Mansion or Golden Core Realm. Though not Bright Yang, it was close enough. It was a reliable artifact.

Li Ximing knew full well the devil jar was worth less than Guiyang. The Ning Family had offered the exchange so easily to repay a favor. He accepted it in silence, feeling more at ease.

"Daoist Ximing!" One of the nearby cultivators called out, his face filled with both alarm and fear. He spoke in a hushed tone, "Please hurry... the devil cultivators from the north are descending again..."

Li Ximing’s expression darkened. He strode forward quickly, stopping before the formation and looking up. Sure enough, several devil cultivators stood within the thick, overlapping devilish mist, their greedy eyes staring directly at him.

The number of devil cultivators gathering here over the past few hours keeps increasing...

Li Ximing had no idea what had happened at Chengshui Tomb. After months of defending this place, he had gained some experience, but the battle between North and South had taken an entirely unexpected turn since the midnight hour...

A tangled mess... a complete mess...

It was as if some restriction among the devil cultivators had been removed. All of Xu State was in chaos, with orders from Mount Bianyan blocked to the north. It was as if the entire chessboard had been smashed to pieces. The North and South were left disoriented.

The devil cultivators had begun slaughtering each other, yet the massive devil cloud still advanced, spawning countless tendrils that surged southward. The former sense of orderly combat where soldier versus soldier, general versus general had completely vanished.

Dozens of Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivators had fled into Li Ximing's area within the hour, with even several Foundation Establishment Realm devil heads pausing here. The cultivators in the formation were so terrified they nearly lost control of their bowels and hurriedly called for him.

The man reported, "Daoist... in just one hour, several of our strongholds on the northern shore vanished without a trace or message..."

Li Ximing felt more and more uneasy and asked quietly, "Any word from the Ning Family?"

"They came asking once, fifteen minutes ago!" replied the man.

Li Ximing immediately frowned and sighed inwardly at how clueless this man was. If this formation had been under his full control, how could someone like this hold such a position?

He said coldly, "What did they say?"

The man seemed to realize his blunder and trembled under Li Ximing’s tone. Suppressing his fear of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, he responded respectfully, "Reporting to Daoist... the upper sect asked... they asked if you could get in touch with General Xuanfeng..."

"What?!" Li Ximing froze, a chill creeping up his spine as he murmured, "Didn’t Ning Heyuan say Uncle was with Daoist Master Yuan Xiu? Why would they ask me something like this? Did he lose contact with the Daoist Master?"

"I... I don’t know!" The man thought Li Ximing was questioning him directly and collapsed to his knees in fear, kowtowing repeatedly. Li Ximing no longer paid him any mind, pacing anxiously as dread grew in his heart.

He rushed to grab a jade talisman from the desk, infused it with spiritual sense, and wrote, The north is in upheaval... I urge Zhouwei to retreat quickly to the Eastern Sea...

He yanked the man up from the ground and shoved the talisman into his chest, his voice sharp and stern, "Deliver this to the Li Family in Qingdu immediately!"




# Chapter 849: Shaken With Fear

The white steps before the circular hall gleamed brightly, and the four words ‘Palace of Enlightened Dao’ above the hall sparkled with light. The formation around the hall flickered on and off, humming softly.

Buzz...

Both Yuan Xiu and Buzi were late stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Dealing with a formation that was already worn and flawed due to the changes of heaven and earth was effortless for them. It took them less than half a stick of incense’s time to twist several formation nodes and open the formation.

A wave of dense spiritual qi rushed out. Chi Buzi’s eyes narrowed slightly as he looked around to see a vast expanse of jade slips stretching as far as the eye could see. The surging spiritual qi caused the jade talismans labeled with technique names to clink together between the racks.

Beneath his feet, countless intricate formation patterns seemed to glow and fade away like breathing. It wound and twisted through the hall like rivers, accentuating the grandeur of the entire hall.

He couldn’t help but express his surprise in a sigh. "The immortal treasury of Ning State truly is as vast as a sea of mist! Backed by the power of a nation and descendants of Golden Core Realm cultivators... This treasury far surpasses that of my Azure Pond Sect..."

He stepped forward and activated his technique, but only floated a foot above the ground before dropping straight back down. He frowned. "What a formidable formation."

Though the formation outside the hall had been broken, each floor within the hall was reinforced with its own formation that protected the jade slips. The formation layers interconnected like Dharma Masters cooperating, locking down the environment completely. Traces of the Water Mansion Dao were evident, so much so that even a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master couldn’t fly inside.

He had no choice but to advance quickly on foot. He swept right past the jade slips on the first floor. After climbing several levels, his eyes skimmed over the many slips until he paused, joy lighting up his face, thinking, The Clear Dew Origin Manual... could it really be this?

The jade slip glowed with a pale azure hue, emitting an alluring radiance. Unfortunately, the grotto heaven suppressed spiritual sense, so any external probe dissipated quickly. Chi Buzi formed a seal and gently touched the jade slip. His spiritual sense tried to enter but was blocked by the formation, so he resorted to divination with finger signs.

This formation is powerful, but it has flaws... with enough time, I can deduce its contents.

He focused his spirit entirely on the jade slip, unaware that an old man stood ghost-like nearby, hidden in the glow of the jade slips. His eyes shimmered with dense, intricate patterns.

Si Boxiu had followed him in. His gaze had never lingered on the sea-like treasury, not even for a moment. He was fixed solely on Chi Buzi’s every movement, hiding like a shadow nearby as he coldly watched.

His feet hovered just above the ground without making a sound. Spiritual sense was suppressed in this grotto heaven, making it hard to perceive one's surroundings. Si Boxiu took advantage of the opportunity to inch closer, his old face filled with suspicion and gloom.

He remained hidden in the shadows, his eyes glowing with countless tiny golden runes due to the full exertion of his divine ability. His aged lips trembled slightly, the spell condensed at the tip of his tongue, but remained unspoken.

As Chi Buzi became increasingly engrossed in deciphering the jade slip, joy appearing on his face, his guard dropped to the lowest point. Suddenly, Si Boxiu stepped forward, golden light erupted from his lips, and he let out a thunderous, explosive voice, "Chi Wei!!"

This was a divine sound technique that was terrifying in its force. Had the target been an ordinary Qi Cultivation Realm cultivator or someone in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, they would have been instantly reduced to ashes. The golden shockwave rippled from his lips, but when it struck Chi Buzi, it passed over him like a gentle breeze, doing nothing more than ruffling the green-robed man’s garments.

He tilted his head and responded, "Uncle, you’ve mistaken me for someone else."

The golden runes in Si Boxiu’s eyes seemed about to burst forth, as they condensed tightly within his pupils. He paid no mind to the reply as his divine sense was verifying something.

Dharma light flowed between Si Boxiu and Chi Buzi. The two faced off in silence, the hall bathed in radiance.

Si Boxiu muttered in a low chant-like tone, "Li Jiangqun. Kan Xuyu. Ning Tiaoxiao. Xiao Xianyou."

He recited the names one by one, eyes fixed intently on Chi Buzi, watching for any change in expression. Only after finishing the list did he finally wave his sleeve and return to a composed demeanor, "I’m only concerned for your safety, Buzi. Don’t hold it against me."

"Thank you, Uncle." Chi Buzi’s smile remained gentle throughout the entire event. Si Boxiu nodded slightly and finally turned to leave, going off to browse the techniques in the hall that interested him.

Chi Buzi watched him go, then turned his gaze back to the jade slip in his hand. A flick of his fingers formed spell seals, and the formation light on the slip began to gradually dissolve.

Everything that had just happened seemed not to weigh on his mind at all. He showed a trace of delight as he read carefully, then frowned and gently placed the jade slip back on the desk, murmuring, "Another one that only goes up to Foundation Establishment Realm... Could this divine ability have been made forbidden by some family? What a nuisance..."

He exhaled deeply. The formation before him flickered between light and shadow, causing a slight sense of dizziness.

"Uncle..."

Just as he stepped onto the high platform, he saw Si Boxiu holding a jade slip and reading intently. Chi Buzi took a step forward and called out to him twice, but his expression suddenly froze.

Si Boxiu stood frozen like a statue before him. Spiritual qi shimmered within the dharma light, like mist and smoke, yet Si Boxiu seemed paralyzed.

"Uncle..."

Chi Buzi’s calm smile finally vanished, replaced by a creeping dread. He stiffly twisted his neck, eyes scanning the formation patterns on the platform beneath his feet.

The patterns, which had once glowed faintly along the flow of spiritual qi like a beautiful river, were now frozen in place. The entire hall seemed to hold its breath in terror; even the clinking of jade talismans had ceased. Everything stood in utter silence.

A great terror engulfed his soul. Every divine ability within him ceased functioning. Chi Buzi stood as helpless as a mortal, slowly looking around until he saw a figure quietly seated atop the beam that was glittering like stars.

The man sat neither too close nor too far, yet all the hall’s radiance gathered around him, trembling with fear. Chi Buzi’s gaze traced the hem of his snow-white robe, patterned with suns and moons, slowly upward.

"This..."

The ancient-style garment was dignified and austere, its patterns dazzling to the eyes. Multicolored lights circled his body, swiftly turning into white clouds that manifested the myriad faces of humanity—joy, sorrow, laughter, weeping.

The entire formation above trembled, as if it would ascend with this immortal and vanish into some celestial capital of white jade.

Chi Buzi’s gaze dared not rise past the robe’s hem. The immense fear within him surged like a tide. His thoughts roared with terror, Who is it? The one from Luoxia? Or Ning State’s Golden Core... has that True Monarch not died?

Struggling to compose himself, he slowly knelt to the floor. His voice was hoarse as he said, "This humble cultivator is fortunate to witness such immortal presence. May I know which exalted being I face...?"

The immortal’s voice was light and cold. It drifted gently down like a whisper from the heavens, sending a tremor through all his limbs.

"Weren’t you always longing to meet me?"




# Chapter 850: Bestowal Of The Method

All Yin Fruition Attainments revere the Supreme Yin. The Supreme Yang is the foremost manifestation during the day. All Yang phenomena follow it...

Chi Buzi’s spiritual orifice had opened earlier than most, so he could already cultivate by the age of five. Chi Wei had begun teaching him with the concept of Fruition Attainment. The various Dao Fruits were introduced starting from Yin and Yang.

Chi Wei had read this line from a hall in the Mifan Sect. It was an ancient cultivator’s view on Yin and Yang Fruition Attainment. The next line went, The mystic brilliance of the Supreme Yin falls into the Bingzi water. It becomes the color of the lake moon. It guides the Pristine and Converging positions. This implies the True Hornless Dragon inquiring into the Dao. The celestial essence of the Supreme Yang blends with the Renchen water. It becomes the Divided Yang Hairpin and dissolves the Lesser and Bright Yangs. This is the alternation of fullness and waning. This is the division of Kuai.

When Chi Wei read that passage, no emotion had crossed his face. Only later did Chi Buzi realize that Chi Wei had used this line to justify consuming Li Chejing. Putting aside the differing terminology for spirit items among Dao lineages, it was clear that the Lake Moon Autumn could guide Pristine and Converging. The Divided Yang Hairpin could dissolve the two Yangs.

But Yin and Yang had seldom revealed themselves since ancient times. Spirit items had withered. Dao lineages had been lost. There had been very few who even reached the Foundation Establishment Realm through Yin-Yang Fruition Attainment. The Purple Mansion Realm had been even rarer. Those who had attained the Dao Fruit of Yin and Yang in the past had all been unbelievably powerful. No ambitious person in the world had ever dared to covet that Dao.

Most Purple Mansion Realm cultivators set it aside. Only a few people like Chi Wei used changes of the Yin-Yang duality to achieve their aims. There were perhaps only a few stubborn sects who still tried to make real progress in these two Daos.

It was precisely because of the deep significance that Chi Buzi did not dare let his eyes linger when his gaze fell upon that Yin-Yang pattern. He dropped his eyes immediately to the floor as if he had been burned. His forehead pressed tightly against the etched lines on the ground. All the arrangements and calculations in his heart were shattered. Only boundless panic remained.

He... it’s actually Him. It’s this Immortal Lord. What Valley Water. What Water Mansion. It was Yin and Yang all along.

He pressed his forehead firmly to the ground. His voice had gone slightly hoarse and his tone could not be more humble and respectful as he said, “This junior Buzi greets the Immortal Lord.”

But in his mind, thoughts raced like lightning, Who is this person before me?

This was no longer the age when immortals revealed their divine forms. Only Mount Luoxia and the Underworld were acknowledged as the residence of immortals. Those ancient cultivators who had become immortals had either perished or flown into the boundless Outer Heavens. Only a few had been known by name in recent ancient times. Those with Yin-Yang Fruition Attainment had been even scarcer.

His courage drained away as he gritted his teeth to keep his lips from trembling. The answer was already clear to him.

Yingze!

Chi Buzi had made countless calculations. But he had never once imagined that the Li Family was backed by this immortal. Who was Yingze? He was the master of Green Pine Temple; a great cultivator who practiced both Yin and Yang. He had also attained the Dao Fruit of Supreme Yang.

The Lesser Yang Devil Monarch Kuai Li had been unbelievably powerful back then. Yingze first sent someone to read a celestial edict in front of Tuoba Xuantan, and only then did he act to capture Kuai Li. True Monarch Tuoba Xuantan of Tiancheng had not even dared speak a word.

Kuai Li had been split into three, and each part was no weaker than an ordinary Golden Core Realm. This alone showed how terrifying the Devil Monarch had been in his prime. Chi Buzi was shaken to his core. For a moment, he did not know what to do.

Pristine Water had personally come and stood humbly to the side, performing the disciple’s salute and addressing this figure as Master or Martial Uncle.

He knelt obediently, staring at the frozen pattern on the ground. He could only squeeze out a sentence after taking several breaths. “This junior... this junior is deeply grateful to witness the immortal countenance. I had only wished to receive the immortal’s decree and serve with all my strength. I did not expect to trouble your divine presence. I am overwhelmed with both fear and honor.”

Chi Buzi was fairly cogent, and his tone was humble and respectful. He never thought that lowering himself was disgraceful in any way. This person before him had attained a Dao Fruit. Even now, traces of his legacy could be found in formations, spells, pill forging, artifact refinement, and Yin-Yang transitions. What harm was there in speaking a few words in a soft tone?

“I only fear I am not humble enough.”

If Chi Buzi had been born a thousand years earlier, before the changes of heaven and when the heavenly order was still intact, even claiming to have spoken with Yingze would be considered a brag and met with laughter. Now, he simply submitted himself honestly, without even the slightest hidden intention.

The immortal above leaned silently forward, then spoke, “This lord did not pass through this place for you. It is a tangle of fate. You came seeking me on your own.”

Chi Buzi responded meekly. Lu Jiangxian’s divine sense had already connected with him and could naturally read his thoughts with perfect clarity.

He had always admired power and never hesitated to use underhanded means. He had little respect for Pristine Water. That True Monarch withheld knowledge and passed down incomplete and confusing methods. He lacked the grandeur befitting a True Monarch and stood in Chi Buzi’s path. Naturally, Chi Buzi came to resent him.

Chi Buzi knew with near certainty that this ancient immortal could perceive his every thought. He was extremely calculating and had immense self-control. He deliberately filled his heart with admiration to the point that even he believed it.

Lu Jiangxian simply examined the fullness of his emotions and remained silent for a long moment. He certainly did not believe that the Chi Buzi before him had any way of deceiving him.

“Good... truly a ruthless one...”

Chi Buzi was still kneeling. He did not even dare lift his head, let alone try to guess the immortal’s mood. Then he heard the immortal pause, followed by a statement that made his mind reel.

“Dangjiang, come out and face me.”

What... It felt as though ten thousand great bells rang in Chi Buzi’s head. The heavy sound echoed again and again in his mind. The disbelief only flickered for a brief moment before he felt everything recede, vanishing into endless silence.

It was as if his soul had left his body and now quietly watched from the side as his body moved. Chi Buzi saw his own body leap up and perform a strange and twisted salute.

A familiar face twisted into a foreign expression and obsequiously said, “This little god greets the Lord of the Mansion. I humbly welcome your great presence. This little god congratulates you on your return from the Immortal Mansion. May you bring peace to this realm. All crowned hermits and feathered guests under heaven shall have joyous tidings...”

The one who had taken over his body was none other than the fiendish being that had leaped out from the Li Family. Chi Buzi had fought him with wit and will for years, until he thought he had finally destroyed him and devoured the treasure hidden in his soul, gaining a great advancement in cultivation. He never imagined that the wretched thing was still hiding within his body.

“Dangjiang... very good... you really managed to fool everyone...”

Chi Buzi’s anger flared for a moment but was quickly swept away by his rationality. He forced himself to ignore it. Even though it felt like his soul had left his body, he still maintained his respectful thoughts, silently watching the fiend control his body and babble on.

Lu Jiangxian had no intention of speaking further with Dangjiang. He silenced the Immortal Official of the Water Mansion with a thought and spoke softly, “I was in secluded cultivation that day and not within the mansion. Yet you used our link to escape.”

At this point, he paused, as if addressing another person, “It ended up saving your life.”

Chi Buzi shuddered involuntarily. Of course he understood the immortal was speaking to him. A wave of dread rose in his heart.

So it’s true... when I searched that young cultivator’s memory, I triggered something and nearly got myself killed. But it happened to coincide with Dangjiang’s escape, which ended up sparing me...

Dangjiang, having taken over Chi Buzi’s body, did not stop talking. He immediately burst into sobs, crying out, “Lord of the Mansion! My lord! This lowly one has suffered so terribly in this filthy world! What... what kind of world is this? This little god... this little god...”

Chi Buzi was left speechless as his breath caught in frustration. He sneered inwardly, grinding his teeth in hatred as he thought, I’ve fought with you for decades. Do you think I still don’t know what kind of scum you are? You talk so righteously, but deep down you’re lustful, cowardly, and greedy to the core. Pretending... and you’re still pretending so well...

Lu Jiangxian watched the creature’s mouth flap and secretly felt a headache. It had taken a lot to stage this moment properly and he truly feared that this fellow would talk too much and give something away.

Jinlian wasn’t talkative at all. How did he manage to produce such a noisy thing like Dangjiang...

Lu Jiangxian silently commanded the creature to shut up, gently shook his head, and spoke in a warm tone, “You have deserted your post for many years. Naturally, you must bear punishment. Return to your position.”

When these words landed, Chi Buzi instantly regained feeling in his limbs. The burden in his heart was finally lifted. When he felt the cold touch of the floor beneath him again, he sighed silently in his heart, So he really didn’t take my body... after all, he is an immortal...

So it was this idiot abandoning his post from some grotto heaven or secret realm back then. No wonder that fiendish thing barged in out of nowhere!

He had originally thought that Dangjiang had been sent by some True Monarch to seize his body. That was why he had gone to Zongquan Island and taken the risk to speak all those words. Now that he had finally pieced together the full chain of events, he felt a trace of envy in his heart, This fool really has foolish fortune...

He paused for a moment and realized that this Immortal Lord, who seemed to be Yingze, had likely come only to retrieve the fiend. In all likelihood, he would soon depart into some immortal realm, and anxiety began to rise in his heart.

Chi Buzi had finally obtained a chance at forming a Golden Core. How could he let it slip away? At the very least, the immortal before him seemed approachable.

He gritted his teeth and bowed fiercely, then spoke in a solemn tone, “Buzi feels longing in his heart to behold the Immortal Lord’s face. I only fear the great path is not in harmony. To see the immortal is like seeing the truth of the Dao. I beg the Immortal Lord to guide me to the Golden Core Dao.”

He could not stop trembling in fear as he spoke. The immortal above did not seem surprised and quietly watched him.

After a moment, he said, “You used your body as a cage to imprison Dangjiang. You prevented him from revealing himself. That can be considered a merit.”

Chi Buzi felt both doubt and joy in his heart. He pressed his head even closer to the ground. The brilliance before him receded like the tide, little by little fading away, leaving only a long sigh.

The immortal declared, “You have the heart to cultivate yourself and preserve your nature. That is already rare in this world today. Since you seek a clear path, I shall show you one. Make good use of it.”

Chi Buzi knelt silently. Only when the brilliance before him had fully vanished did he slowly raise his head. Everything before him remained frozen in endless stillness. It was tranquil and peaceful.

If not for Si Boxiu standing beside him like a statue, Chi Buzi would have thought everything had been nothing but a dream. He slowly stood up and looked around.

All the splendid colors in the great hall were slowly fading. The stone steps, jade slips, formation lines; everything dissolved like sand in the wind, leaving behind endless whiteness.

He looked ahead, where a snow-white command token floated in the air. The man in green stepped forward and gently grasped it. A thunderous boom echoed in his mind as the token transformed into white radiance and shot into his consciousness.

Countless spell chants surged forth like a great flood. Chi Buzi slowly raised his head, light flashing in his eyes, as several large words appeared in his mind, Heavenly Glyph Bright Profound Sacrificial Method!

Clink clang...

He suddenly lifted his head. The white light before him had completely vanished. The clinking of jade pendants returned to his ears at the same time as the flow of spiritual energy reappeared in his perception. Chi Buzi still held the green jade slip, cool and smooth to the touch.

The glow of the formation lit up his green robe, revealing intricate patterns. He heard the aged voice of Si Boxiu behind him.

“Any gains?”

“Not enough.” Chi Buzi smoothly and naturally lifted his head. A look of helplessness appeared on his face as he slightly shook his head and frowned. “It’s still only Foundation Establishment Realm.”

He quickly searched through it again. As expected, the Purging Dew of Pristine Water was still not there. Disappointment written all over his face, he returned to Si Boxiu and spoke softly, “What a pity. Has Uncle already taken the spell he wanted?”

“There’s nothing here I particularly need...” Si Boxiu shook his head and said, “These techniques seem more suited for ordinary disciples to study. What I’m looking for is a more profound kind of sigil and formation art. While there are some interesting things here, they’re still not enough.”

“A more profound kind of sigil and formation art?” Chi Buzi's expression remained natural. There was no trace of the events just moments ago. He smiled and said, “Then we’ll have to head to Moonlight Origin Mansion!”

“Wouldn’t dare say for sure...” Si Boxiu’s mouth twitched slightly as he silently shook his head.

Chi Buzi cast his gaze across the sea of Dao methods and casually remarked, “Since Uncle has already taken what he wants, then let’s act together. Trigger the formations in this hall and destroy everything here!”

Si Boxiu frowned slightly but found some sense in the suggestion. The ones at the center were all Purple Mansion Realm techniques related to True Essence. Their formations were especially tight. There might even be additional restrictions layered within. It would take at least an hour to break one open.

Since none of it was essential to either of them, and time was precious within a grotto heaven, spending an hour just to extract one technique was not worth it. But leaving it for others to take was even more unacceptable.

Si Boxiu activated the Profound Yellow Dao Talisman and placed it onto the center of the formation, speaking softly, “Stay back for now. Breaking this great formation isn’t easy, but triggering its self-destruction is much simpler!”

Si Boxiu was a master of the art, so Chi Buzi naturally left it in his hands and gracefully retreated. Once he was a quarter of a kilometer away, a dazzling blaze shot skyward. Golden-red mixed with ash-black erupted as True Flame and Merging Fire exploded simultaneously.

Now, no matter how good the techniques inside were, they’ve all been completely burned away... Chi Buzi’s face was slightly reddened by the surging flames in front of him. A harmonious smile appeared on his face, and he was thoroughly satisfied in his heart, I must keep the Heavenly Glyph Bright Profound Sacrificial Method strictly confidential. But who knows when someone might catch a glimpse... It needs a plausible origin.

This Palace of Enlightened Dao is the perfect source. Who knows what secret techniques were hidden within? Burn everything to ashes, and there’s nothing left to verify... Who could possibly say otherwise?

He clasped his hands behind his back. His green robes flickered between light and shadow under the blazing fire. He forcibly suppressed the surge of joy and doubt in his heart, thinking silently, I’ll study this technique carefully when I return. But since it was bestowed by an immortal, there’s an eighty or ninety percent chance I won’t understand a thing... Still, I must try.




# Chapter 852: Crimson Reef

In the mirror’s world.

Thick mist dispersed, and shimmering soft light fell on the misty mountain top. Lu Jiangxian paused with Dangjiang in hand. This fabricated Immortal Official had his spiritual sense suppressed and was dazed and confused in Lu Jiangxian’s grasp.

He moved his divine sense slightly, dispersing the glow of various magical arts around him and dimming his clothes. Only then did he sit quietly under the tree and begin to reflect carefully, Using the hidden seed in Buzi’s soul to drag him into an illusion in advance... With my current Inherent rank and the Metallic Essence, even a Golden Core Realm cultivator would be stunned for a moment. This fellow absolutely lacks the ability to see through it... There shouldn’t be any traces left...

Lu Jiangxian now possessed the ability to traverse the great void and Buzi had already revealed his ambitions. Dangjiang was no longer of any use in Buzi’s body. After all, it was a part of Maha Jinlian. Retrieving it might serve other purposes.

The only risk was Buzi’s unusual behavior. If he failed to conceal the traces and was soul-searched... Fortunately, the restriction was still in place.

He had studied the immortal texts, and the mirror itself had become more complete. This time, he had focused on reinforcing the seal, making it completely undetectable and placing it inside Buzi’s body, to prevent him from falling into the hands of any True Monarch.

After thinking it over, he found nothing amiss and pondered silently, Although this man had once humbled himself, he was not easy to deal with. Relying solely on Inherent rank to intimidate him wouldn’t be enough to control him and might even arouse his suspicion. I could only keep him dangling with this method of extending the cultivation path.

Lu Jiangxian had no real immortal arts or techniques to give him. Sending ordinary things would only reveal the truth. Thus, he had carefully refined the Immortal Mirror’s essence-extraction and spirit-seizing methods before handing them to him. He thought, If the Li Family cannot find a Purple Mansion Realm demonic creature, then let Buzi search for one himself. As for whether to reward him after he sacrifices it to me, that’s another matter. At worst, I just won’t respond, and he’ll only suspect the offering wasn’t grand enough.

He wasn’t worried that Buzi wouldn’t take the bait. Though this man was cunning and treacherous, his natural talent was excellent, and his desire for the Dao was unshakable. It was precisely because he was cunning and knew the taboos of all sides that Lu Jiangxian dared to let him try.

But Purple Mansion Realm demonic creatures were not so easy to kill, especially one without any backing. It was just a casual hook, after all. Lu Jiangxian quickly shifted his attention, savoring an interesting matter, He thinks I am Yingze...

The leap in logic wasn’t hard to understand. Lu Jiangxian himself had once doubted it, but from what he heard, Yingze had attained the Supreme Yang Fruition Attainment, which didn’t quite match.

According to Li Jiangqun’s memories, I should be the Lord of the Moonlight Origin Mansion, bearing the Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment, which also matches the current abilities of the Immortal Mirror. But whichever way I look at it, these two should not be the same person...

What was even harder to account for was the relationship between Moonlight Origin Mansion and Green Pine Temple. The Kong Family said that Yingze was from Moonlight Origin Mansion, yet he was also the master of Green Pine Temple’s Mirrored Mirage Grotto Heaven. Even the Sun Seeker Ring had been engraved with Green Pine Temple Lu Jiangxian...

He couldn’t make sense of it, so he gave up for now. He looked down at the rows of moon-white buildings below as he stood atop the peak. He lightly flicked his sleeve.

An elegant, moon-white tower rose from the mountainside in a burst of radiant light. Eighty-one jade steps unfurled one by one, winding downward. Countless jade slips poured down like mountains and seas, yet each one landed neatly in its designated cabinet.

The Dao Collection of Anhuai Heaven is all here!

He landed atop the exquisitely elegant celestial tower, which was filled with countless magnificent corridors. Countless jade slips spurted out from the mountain peak above; some streaming through windows, some from palace gates, and others from corridors, but all rushing into this white jade tower like a storm.

Lu Jiangxian murmured, “Hundreds of years of work. The Anhuai Heaven Dao Collection, brought together by families from Jiangnan and Jiangbei as well as small clans from the Eastern Sea. Altogether, there are over sixteen thousand Daoist texts and more than fifty one thousand spell arts...”

He stood in front of the white jade tower and flipped his hand over. Several colored immortal slips appeared at once.

“There are Twelve Purple Mansion Realm cultivation methods. One Li Fire, one Whole Pill, two Purple Essence, one Bright Yang, one Jade True, one Azure Manifestation, and five True Essence.”

With the exception of Bright Yang, Jade True, and Azure Manifestation, the rest all came from the Anhuai Heaven Dao Collection. The Palace of Enlightened Dao might not have held all the cultivation methods of Ning State, since some might have been moved earlier, but the sheer number was still astonishing.

Lu Jiangxian threw them into the tower, then suddenly paused, beckoning. Six of them were the Yuan Family’s Yanyang Temple Dao lineage, also an extremely ancient immortal art. Lu Jiangxian read through them carefully and gradually realized something was wrong.

Among these six, only Profound Goat was a Purple Mansion Realm technique; the rest were all Foundation Establishment Realm methods. Together, they formed the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual.

When Lu Jiangxian first obtained this technique, he didn’t understand it well and had only skimmed it. Now, after reading so many Purple Mansion Realm methods, he finally noticed the problem with this manual.

“The Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual once said that once Profound Goat is cultivated to the Purple Mansion Realm, and the other four Foundation Establishment Realm techniques are completed one by one, one can attain divine powers...”

“How could that be...”

Although Lu Jiangxian had never practiced it himself, he had written a Purple Mansion Realm technique himself and understood what Purple Mansion Realm cultivation entailed. If one did not consume others, they could only refine themselves, and it would take five Purple Mansion Realm techniques! If not, why would the elementals remain trapped in the southern border!

He finally took out the technique, condensed a human figure before him using moonlight, and carefully deduced it. After a dozen seconds, he saw the flaw and muttered, “This ancient technique states... once the other five Daos condense an Immortal Foundation within the body, they can resonate with the external world and transform into divine abilities...

“But in this era of heaven collapsing and earth splitting, the heavenly Dao itself has disappeared. What is there to resonate with?! Even this one Purple Mansion Realm technique Profound Goat requires resonance. Without that portion, how difficult it would be to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!”

Lu Jiangxian silently put away the jade slip, gradually realizing, So the Yuan Family’s relocation from the north, flourishing for a time yet never producing a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, was not without reason... their decline was long predetermined... The Yuan Family might not have lacked spiritual qi to cultivate Profound Goat, but in the end, the family’s ancestor realized this flaw and switched to cultivating Water Virtue...

He returned the techniques to the white jade tower, sighed inwardly, and glanced up at the sky. The battle inside Anhuai Heaven was growing more intense. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who wanted to enter had already gone in, and the Great Ning Palace, which had served as the entrance, was on the verge of collapse.

Li Xuanfeng is still inside.

Li Xuanfeng had gained much in the Great Ning Palace. Not only was that screen a dharma artifact from ancient techniques, but even the mercury droplet containing Helian Changguang’s soul was no ordinary item. Even the casually taken incense burner was remarkable.

It’s a pity that the Supreme Yang Sun Essence couldn’t be taken; otherwise, it would truly have been a massive gain...

Si Yuanli’s limited vision couldn’t see it, but Lu Jiangxian’s divine sense had swept over it clearly. The mercury droplet housing Helian Changguang’s soul was clearly a Whole Pill treasure! It would be useless in the hands of an ordinary cultivator, but in the hands of one who practiced this method, it could be of endless use.

In the Anhuai Heaven Dao Collection, there is a sixth-grade Whole Pill text called the Houshu Golden Book. I could bestow this book while waiting for the Bright Yang cultivation to succeed. The Whole Pill is famous for its marvelous transformations and has great uses.

He organized the techniques, then leaped out again, stopping in the great void. As he watched the countless divine lights gradually rising in Anhuai Heaven, he examined the opportunities, thinking to himself, That’s a Metallic Essence of the True Essence Dao...

Although these Purple Mansion Realm cultivators didn’t have immortal arts, their means with Metallic Essence would certainly not compare to his. But if they had divine powers, holding Metallic Essence would enable countless possibilities...

Metallic Essence was incredibly powerful; when Duanmu Kui failed to break through to the Golden Core Realm, the two Underworld beings that emerged from the Metallic Essence had needed the use of Dharma relics to be subdued...

Dongfang You of the Dragon Clan had also failed in his breakthrough attempt, causing the chaos of Falling Water Rising Storm in the Eastern Sea. The fallen Metallic Essence had naturally gone to the Dragon Monarch, and none of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators dared or even cared to fight for it.

After all, there’s someone holding the Converging Water Fruition Attainment, but True Essence is different...

This True Essence Metallic Essence originally came from a True Monarch. Once it was seized, even the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Mahas couldn’t calculate its background. There would be no aftermath after seizing the treasure. Once one had the Metallic Essence in hand, one could reincarnate anywhere and cultivate True Essence again, gaining another five hundred years of life... They would even have hope of reaching the Golden Core Realm!

When one’s true end drew near and their Dao path was severed, even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would risk everything to snatch the Metallic Essence, using it up before falling, and then seek rebirth...
𝑓𝑟ℯ𝘦𝓌𝘦𝘣𝑛𝑜𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂

As for the new Purple Mansion Realm cultivators like Hengxing and Zhang Yun... they were taking a cautious approach. They are more interested in fishing in troubled waters and dividing up the legacies left behind by the desperate Purple Mansion Realm cultivators...

Boom!

Purple lightning rumbled and exploded in the clouds. Li Qinghong, clad in a long green feathered robe, gathered lightning on her spear and descended on a pitch-black mountain peak, casting a heavy gaze northward.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

Few dared to confront her directly as she fought her way through. Most merely tested her strength. The devil cultivators were mostly cautious. A few greedy ones attacked for a few moves before retreating. Therefore, her mana consumption remained low.

The worry on the woman’s face was not due to the demonic smoke but because of the overall situation between the south and the north.

Chaos... thought Li Qinghong.

Li Qinghong had felt this deeply as she came along. Xu State had fallen into utter chaos. Though the demonic clouds still roiled, the situation was completely different from before.

Previously, though it was chaotic, there was order within the chaos. You could faintly see traces of the choices of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. At least the northern devil cultivators still followed some rules... thought Li Qinghong.

Now the chaos among the devil cultivators had reached the level of headless flies. Whether it was in the east, west, south, or north, one could see devil cultivators from various sects and families flitting around. Some were even led by Purple Mansion and Golden Core Dao cultivators, all fighting for themselves.

Outside of Xu State, devil cultivators and Buddhist cultivators were still gathering rapidly. Where she stood near Lake Xian, she could even see many cultivators from the Eastern Sea swarming ashore and surging southward, hinting at a strange and ominous new tide.

Now Jiangnan is the Upper Evil Spirit Storage, where all evil and corruption emerge. When the devil cultivators reach the river’s edge, their strength grows even stronger. Why would they stop there and not continue to sweep downward...

Li Qinghong kept worrying as she withdrew the lightning from her spear. Suddenly, she felt a violent surge of devil wind rushing in from the east, whipping the ground smoke into a frenzy.

She frowned lightly, raised her spear, and pointed it diagonally at the ground. Purple lightning flickered to life with a thunderous roar. She snapped her spear up and it flared with blazing lightning that shone brightly in the sky.

Boom!

A gray flame shot out from the demonic smoke and was struck squarely by the spear in midair. The flame exploded with several bursts of light that clung stubbornly to her spear. But the surging lightning shattered it within moments, and it fell to the ground with sizzling sounds.

Crash...

Li Qinghong drew her spear back and took up a defensive stance. The blazing purple lightning danced along the spear and up her hand. Her apricot eyes glowed faintly purple as she looked into the gray smoke.

A tall, thin man in a red robe descended from within the devil winds. His brown boots struck the ground, sending up a wave of gray fire. A command token, gray with red patterns, floated beside him.

He crossed his arms over his chest and looked at Li Qinghong with some curiosity, his gaze somewhat cold, and said, “Fellow Daoist, what an impressive bearing.”

Li Qinghong swept her spiritual sense lightly over him and sensed this man’s overwhelming cultivation. His Dharma robe was especially luxurious. She realized he was no ordinary figure. She silently examined him while estimating the distance in her heart, This place is no more than two hundred and fifty kilometers from the Lake Xian stronghold. I still have three Profound Thunder talismans. If things go awry... retreating wouldn’t be difficult...

As she considered her escape route, the man’s red robe began to float in the demonic smoke. His voice was a bit stiff and sharp as he said, “Fellow Daoist...thunder cultivators are rare these days... and even rarer are female cultivators. It just so happens I’ve heard your name.”

Li Qinghong maintained her impassive stare, but her spiritual sense quickly searched around to see if he had others nearby. Meanwhile, the cultivator before her continued to speak, “My younger sister went to Jiangnan but was stopped by you. She couldn’t save that person and even lost the Merging Fire Token. She has been banished from the island and cannot return...”

The man in the red robe’s face darkened. “And I haven’t yet settled the score with you!”

Li Qinghong immediately understood he came with ill intent. She spun her spear with a flourish and laughed lightly, “Oh? So that foolish woman is your sister. No wonder she had such an aggressive air. She was so arrogant, trying to seize my sword and kill my family. Granting her one Profound Thunder was already merciful!”

It was clear that he was Guo Hongyao’s elder brother, the one who had come for Xu Xiao back then. Li Qinghong instantly understood that he was no friend. She didn’t hesitate as she thrust her spear forward, lightning coursing through it.

Boom!

A swirl of gray fire rose around the man in the red robe. He made a spell gesture and the fire clung to the command token and shot forth. It collided with the lightning in midair and exploded into a sky full of thunder and fire.

His tone was grim as he shouted, “How could I not know about my own sister? Would she target your family without reason? If you had just let them leave peacefully, would things have come to this?”

Li Qinghong danced with the lightning, smothering the rushing gray fire. Her black hair floated lightly in the wind. She couldn’t be bothered to argue and only replied coldly, “What’s the point of talking now? I’d like to see the might of the Crimson Reef Merging Fire!”

Bright purple light gathered on her feathered robe. The man in the red robe laughed out of sheer rage. He pressed two fingers together and the command token leapt up, sending out a stream of gray fire that twisted the air as it burned.

He spat out in a low, hateful voice, “Such bold words! You’ve killed too many devil cultivators and think everyone’s mana will scatter when they face lightning!”




# Chapter 854: Yu Jiang

Li Qinghong leveled her silver spear at her opponent with one hand, while the other hand formed two fingers pointing diagonally at the ground. Bright lightning gathered at her fingertips. As raging gray fire shot toward her, she brought her slender hand to her lips, exhaled a breath of lightning, and intoned, “When the sun reaches its height, it births six thunders!”

A thunderous boom rang out as six dazzlingly bright silver-white rays of light emerged before her. Six slender, elegant command tokens flickered simultaneously, and their runes lit up one by one.

Boom!

The six ancient command tokens aligned their bases, forming a six-sided silver-white array in the air. Explosive silver-white lightning leaped out and soared into the sky. It met the gray fire and instantly blasted it into ash, filling the sky with silver-white fragments.

Not only was this silver lightning incredibly powerful, it also followed the mana connection of the gray fire back to the red robed man’s palms. It flickered on and off, sending a numbness through both his hands.

“This!”

The red robed man’s expression changed dramatically. He hurriedly shook off the spell art in his hands, dropping a clump of gray fire that gleamed with silver light as it shuddered and contracted in the air.

Boom!

The gray fire, no longer under his control, hit the ground like thunder and exploded, sending gray dust flying everywhere. It fell like rain. He stared at the six dharma artifacts as if he’d seen a ghost.

Although Crimson Reef Island’s east and west sides were at odds and Guo Hongjian had suffered because of it, the Merging Fire Command Token he held had been granted by the island itself and was considered excellent among Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. But now when his opponent produced six command tokens of similar, if not higher, quality, Guo Hongjian was at a loss for words.

“Ah?”

Then he looked at her fine dharma artifact spear and the mysterious greenish-white feathered robe she wore, each piece no worse than his own, and felt shock and confusion rise within him, Am I the Purple Mansion Realm descendant, or is she? How could a single family have so many high-quality treasures?! What is this?!

He was frozen in shock, but Li Qinghong didn’t wait for him. Using the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens in real combat for the first time had yielded surprisingly satisfying results. She deftly formed a hand seal with her slender fingers.

The six command tokens suddenly leaped up. One started to crackle with lightning and rose to float upside down over another below, while the other four positioned themselves at the east, west, south, and north.

She parted her vermilion lips and said coldly, “Rabbit enters Dragon Palace, bestow the Profound Punishment.”

Guo Hongjian only heard the thunder roar. He clasped his hands together and slapped them down on his command token. A pillar of gray Merging Fire shot skyward, enveloping him. He heard the clouds herald thunder as the roiling Merging Fire wrapped around him.

Boom!

A silver-white lightning bolt descended from the sky, and the Merging Fire surrounding him exploded. A silver-white glow ate its way through the gray flames, making them sizzle and hiss.

Fortunately, the lightning only flickered for a moment before vanishing. Guo Hongjian’s face turned pale, then regained some color. He dispersed the flames, his hands slightly numb, and flung out a sleeve of black smoke, secretly relieved, Thank goodness we’re not in the Eastern Sea!

Unfortunately, we’re not in the Eastern Sea... Li Qinghong felt a tinge of regret. She drew back her dharma seal, and the silver command tokens gathered together to form a six-sided silver formation.

It’s a pity I’m not skilled in spell arts... I can only partially activate these Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens. They cannot be fully utilized...

These two invocations were not her own invention but were inscribed within the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens when she had refined them. There were six in total, each very powerful, but controlling them was extremely cumbersome. Li Qinghong hadn’t had the artifact for long and had barely deciphered two of the spells. She sighed inwardly, The first spell is still decent... but the last one falls far short of what the description says... Maybe it’s because of the changes in the heavens, and the thunder no longer exists. If this were the Eastern Sea during the Falling Water Rising Storm, this strike could at least injure him.

A thought flickered in her mind. She flipped her hand over, and all six thunder tokens leaped apart and floated at her side. Her feathered robe glowed greenish-white, and her spear pierced through the thunder shadow in an instant.

Her spear danced, spreading a field of purple sparrow shadows in the air. But Guo Hongjian was a direct descendant of Crimson Reef Island and had managed to regain his footing during the exchange. His command token flew up, capturing two points of gray light.

He formed a seal and shouted, “Go!”

The two gray lights shot toward Li Qinghong at lightning speed. Gray fire erupted around her and dove into her mana. She used her mana to disperse them, swung her spear across, and slashed at his chest, only to see a black round shield materialize in front of him. The two collided, and purple lightning exploded.

The black shield fell away, smoking, and Guo Hongjian seized the chance to pull back. Li Qinghong’s spear never paused, but as she thrust to pursue him, the gray fire on her body burned ever fiercer. It clashed with the lightning and gave off thick black smoke, forcing her to retreat a step.

Merging Fire shortens lifespan and damages life force. It transforms into artifacts to dispel evil, and like a malignant tumor, it burns stronger with every moment it’s allowed to burn...

Now that the Li Family’s legacy had grown more complete, she could now recognize many famous Dao lineages. Li Qinghong instantly recalled the nature of Merging Fire and dared not allow the flames to burn unchecked. She stopped immediately.

Sure enough, the gray fire clung to her mana, rapidly burning through her mana. Merging Fire could also damage her Dharma robe, yet withdrawing her mana would damage her Cyan Sparrow Plume.

She had no choice but to press her two fingers together and activate her Immortal Foundation. The purple lightning on her body grew denser until it gradually suppressed the Merging Fire. Guo Hongjian hailed from Crimson Reef Island, so he had used this move successfully many times. Knowing her reaction, how could he give up?

He thrust his palm forward to restrain her and shouted, “Fire, come!”

Two streams of gray fire spewed from between his lips and poured into his palm. They were then guided by his Merging Fire command token, transforming into two talisman seals that shot toward her face.

Li Qinghong sidestepped and raised her spear, summoning lightning. But the spear shadow seemed a bit too thin amid the raging Merging Fire. It only split the Merging Fire into two sections, but the flames still clung to her. She let out a muffled groan, and her eyes suddenly glowed with purple light, Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique!

She spat out a point of white light from between her apricot lips. It expanded rapidly in the air, not to block the Merging Fire before her but to softly and elegantly bypass it and shoot toward Guo Hongjian.

“Hm?”

Boom!

A waterfall of purple lightning expanded, flowing like clouds and rain in the air. The spell art in Guo Hongjian’s hands was instantly shattered by the lightning, and the intense purple lightning struck toward him. His face turned pale, and he hurriedly pulled out a talisman.

The Merging Fire on Li Qinghong’s body lost its mana source and dimmed slightly. She swung her spear and forcibly extinguished it, though her chest still felt slightly stifled. The Merging Fire on her mana shield continued to burn fiercely.

She freed her hand to form a seal, and the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens instantly retracted to form a barrier between the Merging Fire and her Dharma robe. The purple lightning waterfall condensed for two seconds before slowly dissipating.

Guo Hongjian stumbled out, covered in dust, and coughed up two mouthfuls of blood, which transformed into lightning and drifted away. He spat bitterly, “What formidable thunder arts... what spell art is this from...”

Li Qinghong withdrew her mana. The Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens were arrayed in front of her, shielding her from the Merging Fire. Sure enough, the Merging Fire struggled to burn through the dharma artifact and weakened from having nothing else to consume.

She let out a quiet sigh and thought to herself, Indeed, it is as sturdy as ancient dharma artifacts...

The Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens had a long history and were crafted long ago. Although they weren’t as indestructible as Li Encheng’s Water Wall Pearl, which could even serve as a defensive dharma artifact in its base form, they were still extremely strong. Guo Hongjian’s Merging Fire was not enough to trouble them.

One often suffered from internal reverberations in battles involving thunder arts. After taking a hit from Profound Thunder, Guo Hongjian’s core was shaken, and he had no choice but to pause and recuperate. He could only watch helplessly as his spell was neutralized.
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝚠𝕖𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝕖𝚕.𝚌𝗼𝗺

He stared heavily at her and thought, She’s rather troublesome... Since I can’t take her down immediately... it’s inevitable that other devil cultivators might gather...

The two were now in a brief stalemate. Li Qinghong also scanned the demonic smoke. Suddenly she froze, and together with Guo Hongjian, turned to look into the depths of the black smoke. A wild wind swept by, revealing a pair of black boots as a young man emerged.

He wore a black robe and was dressed like a devil cultivator. His sleeves were tightly bound with gray cloth, giving him a lean, capable look. His exposed fingers were slightly pale.

His face was somewhat pale, and his eyebrows slanted upward, giving him a sharp appearance. His gray eyes held an inscrutable light. He crossed his arms over his chest, squinting as he surveyed them. His gaze passed quickly over Guo Hongjian and settled on Li Qinghong, examining her silently.

Li Qinghong didn’t recognize him and took a cautious step back. But Guo Hongjian’s expression brightened. His eyebrows rose as he called out, “Fellow Daoist Yu?!”

His spirits soared instantly and his red robe started to billow. The flames of hatred surged in his heart, and with them a spark of greed. He shouted, “Daoist Yu, help me kill this woman quickly... she has many treasures on her. Let’s divide them together!”

Daoist Yu acted as if he hadn’t heard. He glanced at Li Qinghong, then turned his head, looking at Guo Hongjian with a frown. “What are you supposed to be?”

Guo Hongjian’s face turned pale and then green. He realized this man had a strange temperament. Holding back his anger, he said softly, “I am Guo Hongjian of Crimson Reef Island. A few years ago, I visited the Southern Sea to ask you for a talisman...”

When she heard him call out Daoist Yu’s name so eagerly, Li Qinghong had already been on guard. How could she just stand by and watch them get acquainted? She leaped into the air, riding lightning, and shot through the layers of demonic clouds, heading south.

Purple light streaked through the air in the blink of an eye. Guo Hongjian immediately sensed it and his face turned anxious. He threw out gray fire to intercept her, shouting, “Daoist Yu... we can’t let her escape!”

But the black-robed youth in the sky remained unmoved, arms crossed as he watched the show. Only then did Guo Hongjian rise on his fire, but a white bolt of lightning immediately materialized above him. Having just been hit by one, he was instantly terrified out of his wits. All his mana rushed into his Merging Fire command token, and a fierce blaze of Merging Fire enveloped him in an instant.

Psshh...

This white bolt of lightning looked fierce, but when it struck the Merging Fire, it vanished without a trace. No purple lightning waterfall fell. Guo Hongjian froze in shock, and then his expression darkened. When his gout of Merging Fire fell away, he saw that the lightning-augmented glow from Li Qinghong’s Dharma robe was astonishingly fast. She had already flown south.

He landed with a sullen face and looked back at Daoist Yu. The young man wore a mocking smile, as if it was none of his concern.

“Yu Jiang!” Anger flared in Guo Hongjian’s heart, but he gritted his teeth and restrained himself, speaking coldly, “You have quite the patience, Daoist.”

In truth, Guo Hongjian didn’t know this man very well. He had heard of this man’s reputation while stationed in the Southern Sea at the large continent of Danjungwulo and had deliberately gone to visit him to exchange for a talisman.

The Southern Sea had once been home to a major Dao lineage of Buddhist cultivators, and so was full of devil cultivators. An ancient Revered One had once attained enlightenment in Danjungwulo, but now it was very chaotic. The talisman had helped Guo Hongjian a lot, so he had a deep impression of this man.

This man always stayed in the Southern Sea. Why did he suddenly come to Jiangnan... Could it be that he also wanted a share of the spoils...

The black-robed youth, Yu Jiang, watched coldly. His long brows rose as he examined Guo Honjian with a hint of amusement. He said, “If you insist on seeking death, don’t drag me down with you.”

“You!” Guo Hongjian was truly so infuriated that he nearly exploded. His hands folded behind him, he immediately started cursing, “Yu Jiang! I never knew you were such a coward to be so afraid of a mere family thunder cultivator! The two of us fear no thunder. You could have restrained her dharma artifact, and I’d have bound her with Merging Fire. We wouldn’t even need to fight her directly to capture her! Why shrink back like this?!”

“Oh?” Yu Jiang let out a cold laugh, his eyes narrowing dangerously. He replied, “I have never seen a family’s thunder cultivator with such a marvelous dharma artifact and such ancient spell arts.”

“You!” Guo Hongjian snapped back sarcastically, “Who doesn’t have a few lucky opportunities? What does that prove? Couldn’t the Azure Pond Sect have lent her the dharma artifact? So from now on, you’re just going to back off every time you see a cultivator with a remarkable dharma artifact or ancient cultivation techniques?!”

Impatience flickered in Yu Jiang’s eyes as he replied coldly, “The Profound Thunder she used was the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling. Do I really need to explain who controls that grotto heaven now? With so many suspicious details... Aren’t you afraid that Dongfang Heyun is watching from the sidelines?”

The youth swept his sleeve and mocked, “If he decides to take a stroll and kills you like a cat playing with a mouse, who would you go to for justice? Tianwan? Guo Shentong? Could you even find them?

“And even if you did, would they be able to figure out who did it? Even if they guessed, would they dare to utter a single word in front of the Converging Water True Monarch? A single breath from Beijia could leave a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator nursing a century-long injury!”

“This... you... you!” His words were truly sharp. Guo Hongjian’s face turned green, then red, but he found himself unable to retort. He also knew what Yu Jiang meant by a single breath. The gap between a True Monarch and a Daoist Master was like heaven and earth.

Moreover, there were historical examples...

There was an account in the ancient texts of the Valley Water True Monarch named Tianyi. He was once wounded by Earthly Element, his dharma body shattered, leaving only a wisp of Metallic Essence that was about to dissipate. He encountered a greedy Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but blew him to death with a single breath.

Guo Hongjian paused for a few moments, pondering silently, and finally fell quiet.

After hearing this, the matter indeed felt a bit ominous. Guo Hongjian stiffened his face, unwilling to lose face, but also mindful of this man’s talismanic prowess. He didn’t want to offend him and could only mutter stiffly, “I did not understand the subtleties. Thank you for the advice, Daoist.”

Idiot...

Yu Jiang couldn’t be bothered to waste more words with him. Every Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters’ attention was on the grotto heaven. Every moment counted for slipping into Jiangnan. He stepped forward, his mind filled with that thunderous radiance, and muttered softly, “Li Qinghong...”




# Chapter 856: Calamity

On the riverbank.

The demonic smoke on the northern bank was heavy and dark. Cultivators from all factions in the north gathered in small camps on the shore. The major forces each occupied a corner, their auras converging and flowing down the river with an imposing momentum.

Even more northern rogue cultivators were visible further back. At a glance, the sky was full of fleeing lights, just waiting for the riverbank’s formation to break so they could flood into the south.

The rolling demonic smoke halted at the river’s edge. A bright checkpoint hung suspended in the air. Gleaming white bricks that radiated grandeur were fitted tightly together. The city gate towered high, with two white pillars at its base carved with many runes and mysterious incantations.

A brilliant light shimmered inside the city gate, as if aligned with a Bright Yang. The dazzling light radiated outwards, piercing the black smoke and forcing the devil cultivators to retreat.

At the very top of the checkpoint sat a young man clad in a golden Daoist robe. A palm-sized white disc, covered in intricate patterns, floated in front of him. The youth sat upright, quietly watching the cultivators on the other side of the riverbank.

He was accompanied by another figure in a white feathered robe, a spirit fan at his waist. He stood gracefully, carrying a sword in his arms. His gaze was on the north as he pondered.

Li Xizhi was originally supposed to report to Mount Bianyan, but the entire north had been engulfed by demonic smoke a few hours ago. Mount Bianyan stood isolated in the black fog, giving him an excuse to stop at the checkpoint.

After all, Li Xizhi had no desire to face the group of Chi Family members at Mount Bianyan. Besides, his own territory lay just beyond this grand formation, so he was all too happy to remain on guard now that something had changed.

He had taken a short blade from a devil cultivator, examined it carefully, and exchanged it for a Foundation Establishment Realm sword. It was completely brownish-yellow in color and was called Xushi. Because of its rather poor materials, its quality was not high and ranked near the bottom among Foundation Establishment Realm weapons.

After some careful inquiries, he learned that this sword actually came from Yuanwu Peak. It had been forged in the early years by Tang Shejun, a member of the Tang Family who had died while trying to break through to Purple Mansion Realm. The sword was now over a hundred years old.

“What a coincidence...”

Li Chejing’s Qingche Sword from back then had also been forged by the same Tang Shejun when he was the peak master of Yuanwu Peak. After looking at his options, Li Xizhi found nothing better and ultimately chose this sword.

“What exactly is happening at the Great Ning Palace...”

Half an hour earlier, the number of devil cultivators gathering at Li Ximing’s front line had grown. When some started to occasionally test the defenses, he had manifested his Immortal Foundation and stood atop the formation.

Regardless of Li Ximing’s personal strength, his late stage Foundation Establishment Realm Immortal Foundation, condensed with a fourth-grade technique, was truly intimidating. When Li Xizhi, also at late stage Foundation Establishment Realm, stood beside him, they were more than enough to deter the crowd. The riverbank had many crossing points, so the devil cultivators, seeing that he was not to be trifled with, naturally gathered elsewhere.

“Only the direct northern cultivators have gone to the Great Ning Palace, and they haven’t been seen since. The rest are easy to fool... They have no real fighting spirit...”

Li Ximing was no fool and picked his moments carefully. But even though many devil cultivators withdrew, his mood remained low.

He waited for a moment. A female cultivator in green robes flew from afar and landed at his side. She wore a light turquoise Daoist robe, with brilliant dharma light shimmering. Her beautiful face carried a hint of restrained anger, but she paused slightly when she saw Li Ximing.

“Greetings, Senior Lingu,” said Li Ximing.

This was Lingu Lanying, who was also guarding the riverbank. She had lost her mount and spirit pet during the earlier chaos, and had only just flown back in recent days to defend the riverbank.

She took out a jade talisman and handed it to Li Xizhi, speaking softly, “News from Bianyan.”

Li Xizhi focused intently as his spiritual sense probed the talisman. Lingu Lanying spoke bluntly, “News from Mount Bianyan... Chi Zhiyan is being forceful and decisive, ordering more troops and saying reinforcements will arrive soon. He’s telling us to hold this place.”

She laughed sarcastically as she continued, “On the other hand, my family received news that although he’s sent people back to recruit more cultivators, he’s also gathered all the members of his direct bloodline at Mount Bianyan. Clearly, he wants us to clash head-on with the devil cultivators...”

Li Xizhi sighed inwardly. Chi Zhiyan had never been a magnanimous person. Although he put on a good show of being gracious and approachable, his true nature was revealed the moment he had to act.

The Li Family had wanted to receive this order to hold, since their Moongaze Lake was just behind the defensive line. Li Xizhi and the others wanted the Azure Pond Sect to stand firm and resist the devil cultivators. So although Chi Zhiyan was acting out of his own interests, it ultimately aligned with the Li Family’s needs.

But the devil cultivators were pressing so fiercely that he was gathering up all the Azure Pond Sect direct descendants, Chi Family guest cultivators, and Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators back at Mount Bianyan, leaving the various families to hold the line. Clearly, he didn’t value their lives at all, he only wanted to squeeze out their last ounce of worth.

Li Ximing sat quietly on the radiant pass, exchanging a glance with his brother. Both of them understood perfectly and watched coldly, thinking, Mount Bianyan, though on the far bank and isolated in the north, is actually the safest place. Its layers of formations are formidable. The devil cultivators will flow downstream like water. They would rather crash into our weaker earthen dike than break themselves on that rock.

After all, the grand formation on Mount Bianyan could be seen from far away. Disregarding whether or not it could be breached, the first devils to charge it would certainly die. Meanwhile, the river crossing’s defenses were full of holes. If the devil cultivators could find just one weak spot, they only needed to reach out to grasp the wealth of Jiangnan.

Chi Zhiyan gathering his direct descendants at Mount Bianyan is truly a no-lose position. Even if Purple Mansion Realm cultivators never show up and all lines in Jiangnan collapse, it’s just another plundering of the north...

When the order came down, Lingu Lanying, Li Xizhi, and even the various families all saw the truth. This man was indeed a narrow-minded schemer. Now that he’d shed his mask, his actions basically spelled it out, Your own families’ foundation lies beyond the river. Surely the devil cultivators can’t break into Mount Azure Pond, can they? If you can’t hold it, that’s your own misfortune!

Li Ximing was silent for a couple of breaths, then replied, “What do you think, Senior?”

Lingu Lanying’s apricot eyes widened slightly as she answered, “We’ve already sent someone back to report to the sect master. If Chi Zhiyan is acting like this, how can the riverbank be held?!”

Li Xizhi shook his head slightly and said softly, “It’s too late. Besides, the sect’s disciples are very good at self-preservation. Would they really fight to the death with us? Even if they came here, they’d only watch from the sidelines.”

His words were tactful but clear. The Chi Family’s disciples were extremely privileged. Even if they were sent here, would they really follow the orders of people like Li Xizhi?

Li Xizhi paused for a couple of breaths, then added, “If they actually do send people over, I fear the elders would have their own demands, which would make things even harder to handle.”

“This...”

Li Xizhi had reminded Lingu Lanying of an important fact. It would be one thing if the Chi Family really came to guard the formation and took over command. But if things went even a little wrong and they demanded an escort to leave, what then?

The female cultivator looked at him with renewed attention and said gently, “After all, it’s still a force... Sigh! What exactly is happening at the Great Ning Palace? It doesn’t look like the north and south have completely fallen out... This place is full of holes. We can hold it for a while, but certainly not for days or months... Why hasn’t the Daoist Master said a word?”

Li Xizhi offered comfort, “The Daoist Master hasn’t responded. Perhaps he’s still fighting the devil cultivators. It’s been six hours. Though Purple Mansion Realm duels can be long, they wouldn’t stretch on for months. If we hold on long enough, perhaps there’ll be a turning point.”

Lingu Lanying fell slightly silent. She too knew that Moongaze Lake lay just beyond the grand formation, and the Li Family would naturally be more anxious than anyone. Meanwhile, her own Lingu Family, deeply rooted in the south, would likely be less affected.

Most of Lingu Lanying’s urgency was for her family’s disciples inside the formation and for the people of the counties that would suffer if the line broke. Her concern should be far inferior to that of the Li Family.

She settled down and said softly, “Besides the families on the riverbank, there’s also the Xiao Family, a Purple Mansion Realm immortal family. What if Daoist Master Chuting decides to intervene...”

She spoke the words, but in her heart she knew the hope was slim. Sure enough, she saw Li Xizhi shake his head. “The Xiao Family has been secluded for years. Their Daoist Master has long made it clear that he doesn’t want to interfere. He even went to the Northern Sea a while back. The devil cultivators aren’t stupid; they won’t even touch a scrap of Xiao Family territory.”

Everyone present reached the same conclusion in their heart, Xiao Chuting didn’t intervene even when Lixia slaughtered the prefecture and the Xiao Family’s own lands were massacred. There are so many hidden agendas in today’s north-south conflict, and he’s always been the most rational and meticulous. Why would he get involved now?

They didn’t dare to speak the words aloud, except for Lingu Lanying, who nodded and said, “Then I’ll return to the formation to stand guard.”

She rode the wind away, and only then did Li Ximing speak, his voice somewhat low, “Brother... Could the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators really be willing to sacrifice all these families here and let the northern cultivators flood south? Even the Azure Pond Sect would suffer a huge loss of vital qi... Why would they do that...”

“Hard to say.” Li Xizhi responded and asked, “Has the family replied?”

“Not yet.” Li Ximing activated a secret technique and spoke quietly, “But a few days ago, Zhouwei reached the seventh layer of Qi Cultivation Realm. He’s carrying a Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill and a Talisman Pill on this trip. With those two combined, he might soon have a chance at Foundation Establishment Realm.

“Foundation Establishment Realm... and he’s not even twenty yet... Even if he secluded himself for five years, he’d still only be twenty-five...”

Li Xizhi frowned, circulating his secret technique, and said softly, “That’s a bit too fast. It’s almost catching up to Daoist Master Junjian’s cultivation speed. Zhouwei’s innate talent is exceptional; he could have built up more strength. But the situation keeps changing, and there’s no time to go slowly.”

Li Ximing sat quietly atop the Radiant Pass, his voice soft. “Not necessarily. People like him can’t be measured by ordinary logic. For him, adapting to the times is more important than slow accumulation. If he establishes his foundation, what difference does one or two spell arts make? How many high-grade Bright Yang spell arts can our family even afford to let him learn before he reaches Foundation Establishment Realm?”

Li Xizhi paused, tilted his head to look at Li Ximing, and nodded in agreement, “Brother Ximing, you have a point.

“We have to get through this hurdle first.”

Li Ximing looked ahead. Dharma light illuminated the world, and torrential rain was pouring between heaven and earth. But it evaporated with a hissing sound before it could even hit the Radiant Pass beneath his feet.

The demonic smoke surged rapidly, countless tendrils of fleeing light shooting out from it, dragging rolling black clouds in their wake. Five beams of light flew close, heading straight for the formation beneath the two men’s feet.

Northern cultivators followed the five devil cultivators like a swarm of locusts, landing one after another in front of the formation. Li Ximing activated his Immortal Foundation and casually selected two of them, smashing down with force.

Boom!

A brilliant light shot out from the grand checkpoint. The Radiant Pass was best at honing and suppressing, and it also countered devil cultivators. Bright light flowed from it, causing the two being suppressed to curse loudly and hastily summon their dharma artifacts to defend themselves.

“Hmph...!”

Their bodies sank under the pressure. Their curses stuck halfway in their throats, turning into muffled grunts. Both of them were only at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, how could they endure such a blow from Li Ximing’s late stage Foundation Establishment Realm Immortal Foundation?

One of them shouted, “Back there! This guy’s Immortal Foundation is weird, like a solid object... Someone get over here and help!”

Li Xizhi drew his sword. His gaze swept over the five, picking out the one with the highest cultivation, a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm old devil. He vanished, and a misty golden glow danced in the air. He suddenly appeared behind the cultivator, casting a sleeve of Heavenly Glow.

Gold In Cloud!

The devil cultivator was so frightened that he hurriedly drew the long blade at his waist, but he was caught completely off guard. He didn’t even have time to release any blade energy as Li Xizhi formed another hand seal. He stepped to the side, splitting into several Rainbow Phantom Splits, each forming a seal and chanting.

The old devil was completely unprepared. Li Xizhi even had time to watch his reactions, finding his movements suspicious. All six phantoms drew their swords simultaneously, sending out arcs of white crescent-shaped sword light.

It was Li Xizhi’s first time wielding a Foundation Establishment Realm sword. Xushi allowed his sword light to carry half again its usual strength as it shone with a sharp brilliance.

The old devil finally found the chance to release a wave of chilling blade light, but it was instantly shattered by the sword light. His figure was flung aside in a splash of blood. A miserable howl hung in the air as he reappeared a few meters away, too terrified to stop as he frantically formed hand seals.

Li Xizhi saw that the man’s lineage was shallow, so he summoned a single rainbow light, then tugged and twisted it in the clouds. The man’s spiritual energy instantly fell into chaos. Li Xizhi casually stripped his spell art from his hands and advanced calmly.

The old devil couldn’t hold back any longer and shouted, “Help, quickly!”
𝘧𝘳𝘦ℯ𝓌𝘦𝒷𝘯𝑜𝑣𝘦𝓁.𝒸𝘰𝓂

A swirl of devil winds churned at his feet, revealing a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm female cultivator. She also held a sword, raising its light as she struck at Li Xizhi.

This female cultivator seemed to be of the rare Wood Virtue type of Immortal Foundation from Yue State. A wave of wood spirit qi rose as she swung her sword. Li Xizhi’s expression finally grew a bit serious, and his Immortal Foundation circulated, releasing a flow of multicolored clouds.

He brought two fingers together, and Heavenly Glow appeared. He casually pinched the surging sword energy, then flipped his hand to send out a sleeve of brilliance. The female cultivator’s spirit sword was now in his hand; it was merely at the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Floating Light Gathering! The northern cultivator was visibly stunned, her eyes filled with complete disbelief, There’s actually such a spell art!

Li Xizhi found it all very strange. He had never had the experience of casually leaving his opponent so utterly bewildered, and he felt a tinge of emotion. Since leaving seclusion, the enemies he’d faced were either the first breath of a Dragon Monarch, a prince from the Tuoba Family of Great Liang, or at the very least, deeply entrenched old devils like Chimen Difu with hidden backgrounds.

He’d always found those opponents so difficult to handle that he had almost forgotten that he was the Peak Master of Azure Pond Peak. When facing these northern Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators with no Dao lineage who relied solely on luck and brute strength, the difference was indeed stark.

Yet these two acted like they were facing a dire threat. Even though those last two moves had not been life-or-death struggles, the fact that they had been so easily toyed with revealed the terrifying strength of the man before them.

They exchanged secret messages, “The one before us is probably surnamed Chi! An old devil with years of experience, he’s not easy to deal with. We should call for reinforcements quickly...”

Li Family.

A continuous drizzle dripped and trickled among the treetops on Mount Qingdu. The atmosphere felt a bit gloomy inside the grand hall. The elder paced a few rounds in the hall, holding a letter in his hand.

He called someone in, his heart heavy, and said, "Go and summon the heir."

The letter contained some speculations by Li Ximing and Li Xizhi about the situation between the north and the south. Li Xuanxuan had just received it and glanced through a few lines, but it had immediately made him rather uneasy.

"The northern devil cultivators have lost their restraint and are swarming south. How could the defenses on the riverbank possibly hold?"

Li Xuanxuan read the letter over and over, unable to find peace in his heart. Li Ximing advised him to send the heir to the Eastern Sea, clearly implying they might not be able to hold the riverbank.

The letter even urged Li Xuanxuan and the others to flee to the Eastern Sea as well, which made the old man frown deeply and sigh heavily.

How could I abandon the lake and run? I have lived long enough already. If the north falls and the devil cultivators come south all the way to Moongaze Lake, I will still hold my ground to the last moment...

Someone needs to give an account if something happens to the sons and disciples. I should lead them to meet the ancestors in the netherworld. If the family is destroyed, there must be blood spilled.

He sat down and pondered for a few seconds, feeling much more composed in his heart. After a while, Li Zhouwei came in, wearing his armor. He was only eighteen years old, but he was already at the seventh layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, with strong dharma light emanating from him. He was almost progressing one layer per year.

Although the breakthroughs in the later stages of Qi Cultivation Realm were especially difficult and normally required several times the effort, at his speed, he would likely reach Foundation Establishment Realm at around twenty-two or twenty-three years old if he relied solely on self-cultivation.

But the later stages of Qi Cultivation Realm were quite different for the Li Family. They had the Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill and the Talisman Pill. After building up enough cultivation, they could first take the Breaking Realm Pill to break through, then steady their foundation before taking the Talisman Pill.

The Talisman Pill’s effects were not comparable to ordinary pills. The cultivation it provided was real and solid, as if achieved through self-cultivation. In some ways, it was perhaps even better, and one could immediately attempt to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Without waiting for him to be greeted, Li Xuanxuan waved Li Zhouwei into the hall and handed him the letter. Li Zhouwei glanced through it and frowned. After a moment, seeing his golden eyes flicker, Li Xuanxuan said, "According to your uncle’s description, the riverbank may not hold."

Li Xuanxuan thought of sending him to the Eastern Sea but worried he might insist on staying at home, so he hesitated and only asked, "What does Minghuang think?"

Li Zhouwei read the letter carefully again and replied, "Looking at the situation, if the riverbank falls and the devil cultivators flood into Jiangnan, they will likely take two routes. One goes down along Moongaze Lake, and the other squeezes through the wilderness between Shanji Prefecture and Lixia Prefecture.

"That route is caught between two Purple Mansion Realm powers, so it’s not an easy path. I’m afraid they will still attack our family."

Li Xuanxuan hadn’t expected him to mention this matter. Just as he was about to ask further, he saw Li Zhouwei softly say, "After I head to the Eastern Sea, you should split the family into two routes. One burrows a way to Lixia, the other drives the people toward Mount Dali. Senior White Banyan Fox and that Luken are on good terms with our family and can grant us temporary refuge."

Li Zhouwei explained the arrangements in detail. Li Xuanxuan listened and felt slightly relieved in his heart. He said, "There probably won’t be many people who can be saved in the mountains."

Li Zhouwei nodded and replied, "The devil cultivators could reach here in less than fifteen minutes. The nearly million people along the lakeshore wouldn’t even have time to gather in that short time, let alone all squeeze into the mountains..."

Li Xuanxuan fell silent. Li Zhouwei had no choice but to say, "It’s hard to predict these things. The riverbank might still hold. There are so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan, who knows which of them might act. We’re only making necessary preparations."

Li Xuanxuan nodded and said hoarsely, "There’s no time to lose. Take a group of people, pick some of the young talents from the various families, and bring the pills as well. I will have Kongheng take you there."

Li Zhouwei thought for a moment and said softly, "That works out. Lady An is about to give birth, and the Master Monk is considering the idea that Jiangnan is the Upper Evil Spirit Storage. It would be good to take her along to the Eastern Sea as well. Perhaps things will turn out differently there."

He was a decisive person, and the matter was settled neatly. He bade Li Xuanxuan farewell and immediately flew out of the hall and descended. Less than fifteen minutes later, Kongheng arrived with a few people and landed on the mountain.

The monk was always calm and peaceful, and years of cultivation had made him appear even more unfathomable. There were few clear distinctions among Master Monks, making it hard to guess his true strength.

Yet even those like Li Ximing who had broken through later than him had all reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. This monk probably wasn’t far behind either. The Eastern Sea was chaotic, and the white ape would find it hard to establish a foothold there, but Kongheng would be much safer.

When Kongheng saw Li Xuanxuan, he was very kind and said softly, "Please rest assured, my lord. Your esteemed family has accumulated much virtue and will surely turn calamity into blessing."

Li Xuanxuan disliked hearing talk of virtue and vice. He forced a smile as he sent the people out of the lake, then rode the wind back and sat in the grand hall, where he was once again left all alone.

The elder pondered deeply, unable to determine whether it was virtue or vice he had accumulated. He stopped thinking about it and quietly looked out at the rainy weather outside the window, where white frost had already formed. After a moment, a nine-foot-tall, burly man in white armor came in and silently stood in the hall.

"White ape!" Li Xuanxuan exclaimed. The old ape raised his head, his voice like rocks clashing, "Greetings, Master... this old servant has just returned from patrolling the lake."

The man and the ape had fled the raging flames in the marketplace all those years ago and had accompanied each other for decades, so there was no need to speak of their understanding.

He saw Li Xuanxuan’s unease and moved to his side to stand, then said, "This old servant’s Stone Embrace Slumber technique has been brimming with spiritual energy and running smoothly in recent days. Perhaps there is a Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough in the True Essence Dao, or maybe some spiritual item has emerged."

Li Xuanxuan nodded silently, not perceiving anything unusual from it. Just as he was about to speak, he suddenly felt a cold breeze enter from the door. Li Xuanxuan raised his head slightly, as if something had dawned on him, and was about to stand up when suddenly he heard knocking at the hall door

A handsome man in white entered. He had sword-shaped brows and star-like eyes, a handsome appearance, and held a slightly slender cold sword in his arms. His brows were furrowed slightly in worry as he looked inside.

"Xijun!" Li Xuanxuan was overjoyed and stepped forward, holding the letter in his hand, and asked, "Has your injury fully healed?"

"Greetings, Great Uncle." Li Xijun first saluted, coughed twice, and smiled, "It hasn’t fully healed yet. I was worried about the family, so I came out of seclusion early."

Yu Mujian’s sword strike was indeed formidable. If it hadn’t been for the Earth-View Bloodstone, Li Xijun would likely have fallen on the spot. After several years of recuperation, he couldn’t stop worrying about the situation at home and emerged from seclusion early, with his strength only barely recovered to sixty percent.

Li Xuanxuan was overjoyed, immediately pulling him over to find a seat. The white ape silently served tea. Li Xijun recognized him with a glance and said softly, "So it’s you... truly blessed with deep fortune, congratulations!"

The white ape cupped his fists and withdrew. Li Xuanxuan recounted the events of the past few years in detail. Li Xijun listened, his brows furrowing tighter and tighter.

After a long exhale, he replied, "As expected... I knew Azure Pond Sect wouldn’t have arranged anything good for my family... so it’s come to this."

He lowered his gaze, his eyes gradually reddening as he said softly, "I misjudged... I shouldn’t have trusted that Zhao Tinggui... he died and left everything to ruin my family...

"Qinghong has already ridden the thunder to seek him out..."

Li Xuanxuan didn’t know how to respond. The old man waited a moment and finally said, "But your injuries are not yet fully healed. You cannot act. It’s better to focus on cultivation and seclusion."

Li Xijun closed his eyes and exhaled, still carrying some sorrow. The Radiant Snow Pine Ridge began to circulate inside his body, driving all emotions from his mind.

His tone calmed, and he said softly, "Not necessarily... even with my injuries, I can still strike once or twice without issue."

He shook his head slightly, held one hand level, and revealed a shimmering light condensed from frost and snow in his palm. It was pure white and crystal clear. A wave of cold mixed with sharpness surged around it.

This was not quite a spell art, yet not exactly a spirit item either. It looked like a mass of highly condensed energy. With a thought from Li Xijun, the light leaped like a swimming fish, dancing in the air. Its fine scales were clearly visible as it flicked its tail and fell back into his palm.

"What is this..."

Li Xuanxuan had never seen such a thing before. For a moment he couldn’t figure it out. The old man was stunned for a second, then saw Li Xijun’s sword-shaped brows raise slightly as he said softly, "Sword Essence."

Lake Xian.

Li Qinghong rode the wind fifty kilometers out. The black smoke before her gradually faded, but the sky remained heavy and rolled with gray clouds. The sky was the same gray on both the north and south sides of the lake, dimly hiding the sun.

She flew for a while, and somehow her mind turned again to those two, and she pondered in secret, So it seems at least Crimson Reef Island has been offended. The east and west reefs of Crimson Reef Island have not gotten along in recent years. I don’t know whether Guo Hongjian’s faction is east or west, or if there’s any room to maneuver.

As for Yu Jiang, judging from Guo Hongjian’s attitude, he’s also a powerful figure in the Southern Sea...

As she flew south, she also realized it would be impossible to return to Mount Bianyan, and she felt a sense of relief, That’s fine too. There’s no need to follow their orders... I’ll just return to the riverbank and help guard the lakeshore for my family...

The devil cultivators were already pressed up to the riverbank. She no longer had the heart to deal with that group on Mount Bianyan. Like Li Xizhi, she just wanted to hide as far away as possible.

Turning a corner of Lake Xian, she glimpsed the radiance overflowing from Profound Peak Gate’s Shanji Prefecture. Light flowed in all directions. When she approached, she could faintly see a towering, majestic mountain suspended above Shanji Prefecture.

The mountain loomed vaguely in the clouds, emanating a hazy glow. She could feel her body growing heavier as she drew closer to Shanji Prefecture. She looked up thoughtfully and thought, It must be a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability.

Such power could only belong to Daoist Master Changxi of Profound Peak Gate. Only then did she understand why the demonic mist had stopped at Lake Xian and why the devil cultivators had not crossed into Jiangnan.

The threat hangs high above in the sky... who would dare put even a single step over the lake?

She quickly flew past and vanished into the wilderness by the riverbank. But a beam of golden light caught up and stopped brightly before her, revealing a woman in a Xiang robe.

The woman was dressed in Xiang colors, with a round face and almond eyes, and held a small golden mountain in her hand. She was Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak.

She looked worried as she stepped forward and softly greeted, "Qinghong, little sister."

Li Qinghong had thought she was at the Great Ning Palace, so she was surprised to meet her here. She nodded in reply.

Kong Tingyun spoke softly, "It’s been so long. Why don’t you come sit in my sect for a while?"

"Hmm?"

As soon as she said that, Li Qinghong felt something off. Kong Tingyun had returned from the northern ruins and settled at Mount Yan Pass. The two had even met at Mount Yan Pass days ago, so it was indeed strange to say ‘long time no see’...

That could have been considered a polite greeting from Kong Tingyun, but at this critical time of conflict between the north and south at Azure Pond Sect, it was hardly a leisurely moment. The timing really didn’t make sense.

She was clever enough to not immediately refuse or accept. Instead, she asked, "I should have taken a moment to pay a visit when I passed by Shanji Prefecture, but I noticed something strange in the north..."

Kong Tingyun replied softly, "Something has happened in the Great Ning Palace!"

She moved a few steps closer and used secret techniques to transmit her voice, "Did you think it was strange that the north and south armies are now at odds? That’s because all the Mahas and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from both sides have entered the Great Ning Palace! Now the northern demon horde is out of control, and the southern cultivators have no protection at all!"

Li Qinghong’s pupils widened slightly as Kong Tingyun continued, "My sect’s Daoist Master had a grudge with a few of the new demon leaders, so he didn’t go. I don’t know exactly what happened, but Anhuai Heaven has now appeared in the great void, and all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have entered it."

Li Qinghong’s voice was slightly hoarse as she asked, "The north is already strong, and my second uncle is still in the Great Ning Palace. The defenses along the riverbank are hastily built... how can we possibly resist the northern demon horde...

"Of course, we cannot."

Kong Tingyun nodded firmly, then hesitated a moment and asked softly, "Do you know which route the demon cultivators will take when they move south?"

Li Qinghong had been traveling across the north and south for a few years, so of course she knew. She answered, "After crossing Xu State, they could either enter Wu from the riverbank west of Mount Xiping or follow the entire riverbank south. Any spot would let them into Yue State..."

Kong Tingyun nodded, a solemn expression appearing on her round face, and she said softly, "Right now, only Daoist Master Yuan Xiu remains in the Azure Pond Sect, and he has entered the Great Ning Palace. Meanwhile, Golden Feather Sect has four Daoist Masters, with two of them currently guarding their sect. If you were a demon cultivator moving south, where would you attack?"

"Of course, it would be the Azure Pond Sect..." replied Li Qinghong.
𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝒆𝓵.𝓬𝓸𝒎

At this point, Kong Tingyun no longer hid anything, treating Li Qinghong as one of her own, and spoke in a very gentle tone, "the Azure Pond Sect has seen its Purple Mansion Realm cultivators fall one after another, and its top experts are nowhere to be seen. It’s at its lowest point in five hundred years. Yuan Xiu has been trapped in Anhuai Heaven, with no way to receive word from him. Yet the core members of the Azure Pond Sect like Chi Zhiyan are still at Mount Bianyan!

"Now that the northern demons are out of control, do you think the other immortal sects have no means to influence them? Ever since the events at Anhuai Heaven, the entire situation has taken a sudden turn. At that very moment, they decided to go with the flow, and a new chessboard emerged—targeting Azure Pond!

"Isn’t this situation a perfectly timed, heaven-sent blade? The other immortal sects are taking advantage of the Azure Pond Sect’s weakness to cut out the roots of the demon sect! Even the remaining northern demon cultivators and high-level Buddhist cultivators are happy to watch this scene unfold and are deliberately staying hidden..."

Her voice grew heavy, her expression solemn, "Right now, the Azure Pond Sect faces a great calamity, and all the other sects are just watching from the sidelines! Little sister, I fear it’s not wise for you to return."




# Chapter 860: Profound Punishment

Li Qinghong felt a chill in her heart. She pressed her lips together and gently transmitted through mana, "However, there is still Daoist Master Suiguan in the Upper Sect, who is said to be a first-class cultivator. I wonder if he is still on the mainland... If the devil cultivators move south, he should step in to stop them."

"Suiguan..."

Daoist Master Suiguan was a peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Azure Pond Sect’s grotto heaven. He was said to be very powerful, and Kong Tingyun obviously knew this. She paused, put away the golden mountain in her hand, and used a secret technique to transmit her voice with a solemn expression, "My Daoist Master has already asked Penglai. If the True Monarch heads to the Outer Heavens, then Suiguan will definitely remain in the Azure Pond Sect and wouldn’t dare to enter the present world, let alone come to Jiangnan!"

Li Qinghong slowly raised her head, her almond-shaped eyes meeting those of the woman. Kong Tingyun hesitated for a moment, then spoke softly, "The True Monarch’s divine powers are beyond measure, but Penglai is not necessarily inferior. The other Daoist Masters should also understand this, which is why they have made this plan."

Li Qinghong had weighed the causes and consequences and now understood. She remained silent for a moment, then replied softly, "Thank you, sister. But Moongaze Lake is right on the riverbank, and I must return. Even if the riverbank cannot be defended, I will still go back to protect the lake. I cannot abandon my clansmen and enter the sect alone."

Kong Tingyun sighed faintly in her heart, unsurprised, as she spoke gently, "In that case, I have a message from the Daoist Master that might help you, sister."

The round-faced woman in Xiang attire leaned close to her ear, keeping her mana exposure minimal amidst the spiritual energy, and spoke gently, "Flooded fields bring a hundred years of crop failure, which is certainly satisfying. But when the river floods back and destroys all the courtyards, that is even more satisfying."

Li Qinghong listened intently, and only then did Kong Tingyun continue, "Great Ning Palace will manifest in this world in half an hour. It is less than five hundred kilometers from here, so if you ride the lightning back, you should make it in time... I won’t delay you any longer. Please take care of yourself."

Half an hour!

Kong Tingyun bowed slightly, and transformed into golden light that soared east, returning to the territory of Profound Peak Gate. Meanwhile, Li Qinghong silently rode the lightning west.

She said Great Ning Palace would manifest in this world in half an hour... thought Li Qinghong.

Li Qinghong did the math in her head. Kong Tingyun’s estimate was probably because Li Xuanfeng and others were still at Great Ning Palace or somewhere. As long as they could hold on for half an hour, there would definitely be a chance to turn the situation around.

Even if Yuan Xiu was still trapped and unable to come out, at least Li Xuanfeng, Lingu Rao, and the others could still come!

Judging from her tone, the southward movement of the devil cultivators this time is a result of a consensus among several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. That means the riverbank’s formation is bound to be broken; it’s only a question of how long it can be held.

Now that she knew the situation had shifted to target the Azure Pond Sect, this was no longer something that a few people could control. Li Qinghong no longer hoped to hold the riverbank; she only hoped to protect her own family.

As long as second uncle emerges from Great Ning Palace in half an hour, his renowned prestige among the devil cultivators, combined with the strength of the whole family, will be enough to protect Moongaze Lake and force the southward-moving devil cultivators to change their course.

Li Qinghong tightened her grip on the spear in her hand as brilliant purple lightning crackled constantly above her black hair. The six silver-white Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens on her body glowed with dazzling light, intense thunder pouring into them as if they were ready to erupt at any moment.

She darted into the wilderness. Those witnessing her passage only saw purple lightning gliding through a patch of black clouds, accompanied by faint rumbling. The Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realms devil cultivators beneath her feet all scattered, not daring to lift their heads.

After flying for several kilometers, she saw the riverbank filled with urgent streams of light requesting aid. Several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators hastily rode streaks of light past her, as if transferred from marketplaces all over, rushing to reinforce the frontline defenses.

Li Qinghong paused, purple light flowing through her eyes. She located the place where demonic smoke was the most rampant and arrived in an instant on her lightning.

As soon as the purple light landed, she saw rolling black clouds surrounding a brown formation. There were numerous Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realms cultivators beneath it, but in the sky, several Foundation Establishment Realm devil cultivators were working together, hurling all kinds of dharma artifacts at it.

The formation was already on the verge of collapse, groaning under the weight of the black demonic hammers conjured by the joint efforts of those devil cultivators.

She didn’t hesitate. She lifted her spear with one hand and formed a hand seal with her free hand. Bright lightning gathered at her fingertips, and the silver command tokens that had been impatiently waiting assembled before her into a hexagonal shape.

She muttered, "When the sun reaches its apex, six thunders are born!"

The six silver command tokens spun together, unleashing explosive thunder that instantly leaped across several kilometers, leaving a streak of silvery-white light in the sky, and slammed down among the six devil cultivators.

Boom!

Furious thunder rang out. Those devil cultivators had never expected such a powerful bolt of lightning to suddenly strike them. Caught off guard, their spells were forcibly interrupted and they screamed in agony as black smoke rose from their bodies.

A cloud of darkness exploded outward from the six, and silvery lightning wrapped around their dharma artifacts, knocking them down from the sky. The lightning also surged along the threads of their mana, slamming into their bodies, filling the air with flickering silver and causing them to tremble violently.

Clang!

Li Qinghong didn’t pause. Her spear thrust forward and a bolt of purple lightning exploded, spanning several kilometers in an instant. Her eyes glowed with intense purple light, and the thunder at her feet surged with a fierce violet glow.

"Hm?"

Li Qinghong noticed one of them was already injured. Decisive and swift, her thunderous spear transformed into countless purple sparrow shadows, piercing through that devil cultivator and erupting in a burst of purple lightning.

"Ah!"

Li Qinghong had prepared this strike long ago, and had arrived with overwhelming force. The other devil cultivators were still reeling from the blast of the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens. Their bodies were trembling and blood was gushing from their mouths. How could they possibly react in time?

The man managed only a single wail before lightning incinerated his eyes, blasting outward from his eye sockets, ears, and mouth. An instant later, the purple lightning erupted from every inch of his body from head to toe.

Boom!

He was already injured, and his body had just been seized from several Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators. He was torn to pieces by the lightning. A pitch-black bead leapt up and fled north at full speed without looking back.

Only at this moment did the surrounding devil cultivators collectively panic. They exclaimed, "A lightning cultivator!"

An old devil cultivator, experienced and knowledgeable, was especially stunned. Silver lightning still coiled around his body, burning his mana with a sizzling sound as he muttered, "Decreed as heavenly punishment, profound thunder is most effective against devil cultivators..."

Li Qinghong wore a long, feathered robe of pale green and white. Purple lightning danced around her, causing her black hair to flutter. Though her almond eyes were beautiful, they now held a cold light. Her long spear shifted, while the spell art on her other slender hand never ceased.

The Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens formed another formation in the air, releasing a wave of silver lightning that filled the devil cultivators with dread and confusion. Her pleasant voice echoed in the sky.

"Branch into the Chen Palace, decree the profound punishment."

Boom!

The fleeing black bead had barely flown a kilometer before a silver bolt of lightning slammed down on it with a deafening boom. A heart-wrenching scream rang out; that person had likely been reduced to ashes.

She hadn’t even glanced to the north. The purple lightning on her spear shifted direction, but before she could even speak, the remaining five devil cultivators leaped in terror. Every single one activated their escape light and fled north.

Boom!

The fleeing figures vanished into the clouds to the north, and only then did the deep rumble of thunder ring out. Li Qinghong let her spear fall and turned to face a young man emerging from the formation.

The youth emerging from the formation wore a brown robe. He looked somewhat familiar, and was possibly from the Lingu Family. When he arrived in front of her, only to find the devil cultivators had already fled in defeat, he could only stand in amazement and mutter, "Senior..."

Li Qinghong had just annihilated one of the devil cultivators in a blinding, thunderous assault right in front of the other five. Still, her internal mana was slightly unsettled. She paused briefly to adjust it, dispersed the seal in her hand, and the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens flew back to her body.

"If you can’t hold out, request reinforcements again!" Li Qinghong responded crisply, not bothering to pursue the fleeing devil cultivators. Instead, she summoned her lightning once more, flying like a shooting star toward the next crossing, leaving the people in the formation staring in stunned, complicated silence.

"Was that... the Li Family’s thunder cultivator, Li Qinghong?"

The youth slowly let out a sigh of relief. Several cultivators flew out together, seeing the look of relief on each other’s faces. Though the demonic smoke ahead slowly began to gather again, it was much better than before.

Western riverbank.

The river water rolled past, and the formation beneath his feet glowed brightly, preventing the spirit wind in the sky from crossing the riverbank. The demonic smoke moving south had no choice but to settle here, forcing a battle on the riverbank.

Li Xizhi lifted his rainbow light, dispersing the incoming spell art. He glanced downward. The surging devil cultivators were being held off by the formation. Most were blocked, but quite a few were searching for gaps, trying to slip around the edges of the formation.

The Azure Pond Sect’s formation hadn’t originally been designed to trap devil cultivators. It had been a strategic move between Purple Mansion Realm cultivators; a defensive measure rather than a complete blockade. After all, in their eyes, it was just a game of moves and countermoves between Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

But the situation had changed dramatically. The devil cultivators had surged toward them as one. The formation was no longer enough, even though it left them trapped outside. Most of the devil cultivators coveted the treasures inside and, emboldened by their numbers, hurled spell arts at the formation rather than trying to bypass it. Still, quite a few devil cultivators found other ways to slip through the gaps between formations.

These were mostly Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realms cultivators, and Li Xizhi paid them little mind. He was fighting four at once, blocking any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from attempting to leap over, while still keeping an eye on the situation below.
𝙛𝓻𝒆𝓮𝒘𝙚𝙗𝒏𝙤𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝒐𝙢

Xushi’s light rippled in his hand as he slashed away a flying dharma artifact. Another figure landed before him, riding the wind, holding a large hammer in each hand, looking exceptionally fierce.

Now it’s no longer me blocking them. It’s these devil cultivators, greedy for the treasures and techniques I carry, who have surrounded me themselves... A thought flickered through Li Xizhi’s mind.

The Gold In Cloud transformed into a golden Heavenly Glow that leaped a few times in the air. He flicked his sleeve of Heavenly Glow, revealing his form and leaping out of the encirclement.

Though he was now fighting five opponents at once and it was growing harder, he remained calm. As a disciple of a major sect, he was not someone these devil cultivators could easily match. His Heavenly Glow was adept at maneuvering escape spells, and if the fight became truly desperate, Li Xizhi could simply ride his escape light to leave unharmed.

It was Li Ximing who, using his Radiant Pass, was holding down four devil cultivators but was already showing signs of strain. Li Xizhi, far more experienced in combat, frowned as he watched and thought, He doesn’t know any advanced escape spells, and this footwork is all part of his Immortal Foundation manifestation. If he gets injured, it won’t be a small matter... If he can’t hold out, it’ll lead to big trouble.

As this thought crossed his mind, the female cultivator practicing Wood Virtue in front of him had already drawn another dharma sword and thrust forward. But Li Xizhi also knew swordsmanship, and this woman’s sword art was truly not very skilled. He flicked his fingers and the dharma sword fell into his hand. He twisted his wrist to throw it away, and even managed to snatch away another devil cultivator’s spell art at the same time.

"You!"

The female cultivator, both angry and afraid, quickly backed up a few steps and reached for her storage pouch at her waist, only to find she had only an Embryonic Breathing Realm sword left. Her face fell in embarrassment as she muttered, "Such a devil! Only knows how to sneak around with those underhanded spell arts..."

She was still afraid of Li Xizhi and dared not raise her voice. She muttered to herself, but stopped halfway. Li Xizhi paid her no mind and took a moment to glance around.

This woman’s dharma light was actually clear and pure, so she didn’t seem like a devil cultivator. Li Xizhi looked at the other two beside her. Though there were some blemishes, they were lighter than those of ordinary Jiangnan cultivators. Only the last two radiated blood light, which was a clear sign they were up to no good.

A thought stirred in his heart, Both the north and south refer to them as devil cultivators, but it’s never that clear... As long as they’re Purple Mansion or Golden Core Realms cultivators, whether they’re devil cultivators or not, or to what degree, all depends on their own cultivation.

Though these thoughts filled his mind, the spell art in his hands was utterly merciless. He made no distinction based on the purity or impurity of their mana, striking every blow to kill. These cultivators were at most mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm, and his onslaught immediately forced them onto the defensive.

At the other end, Li Ximing’s forehead was dotted with sweat as he fully activated the Radiant Origin Pass. A dazzling stream of light burst from it, the scorching radiance within burning the air into a bright and still state. It trapped the four devil cultivators’ dharma artifacts inside and forcibly suppressed them.

While he still had to defend against incoming spell arts, he finally found a brief moment to glance at his surroundings, and his heart sank.

There are even more devil cultivators on Brother Xizhi’s side than here... and more demonic smoke is still coming! How could we possibly hold this?

Brother Xizhi and I are both pretty strong among Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, yet we’re already under heavy pressure. How could the other places fare any better?

He understood that the riverbank would inevitably be breached. But he had essentially pinned himself by suppressing these four. How could he possibly get away easily when the formation broke? He grew anxious.

Li Ximing waited a moment, then suddenly saw streaks of purple lightning light up in the east, drawing closer and closer with every moment. The jade token at his waist grew warm. Instantly overjoyed, he activated his Immortal Foundation, and the radiant light shone even more brilliantly, holding the four devil cultivators down tightly.

Boom!

After counting a few breaths, he finally saw the purple lightning tear through the sky. A woman with black hair flowing held a spear in one hand. Six silver Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens swirled and gleamed around her. The pale green feathered robe she wore glowed softly with purple light in the air.

Rain was still falling from the sky. When the gray-black raindrops neared her, they were captured by the power of primal magnetism, transforming into small round gray beads that quietly rotated around her.

Her beautiful, misty purple eyes turned to look, and her voice was sweet, "When the sun reaches its apex, six thunders are born!"

The silvery lightning reflected in Li Ximing’s eyes, flashing as it descended from the sky. Amid the shocked expressions of the surrounding devil cultivators, Li Ximing finally let out a sigh of relief, shouting, "Aunt!"




# Chapter 862: The Fall Of Great Ning Palace

Great Ning Palace.

The sky over Great Ning Palace was gloomy and gray. The once bright and beautiful lake had completely dried up, the ground had cracked, and the occasional clouds drifting overhead quickly dissipated.

The cliff at the very center had already collapsed, filling more than half of the dry lakebed. Countless palace halls and towers had toppled and collapsed, littering the ground with wreckage. It was a scene of desolation.

Trouble had broken out in Anhuai Heaven, and a host of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had started to battle. They had even started fighting inside Great Ning Palace itself, causing the entire area to quake. In less than fifteen minutes, the place had been reduced to ruins. If not for the continuous efforts to maintain it, it could very well have been shattered into dust.

Now, with all the Mahas and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators inside, some unknown Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had apparently left a hidden trap that destroyed the sky-piercing pillar of light. It had been smashed to pieces after everyone had entered, leaving Great Ning Palace abandoned and disregarded, shrouded in darkness.

Silence lay heavy over the area as Li Xuanfeng stepped down from the palace ruins. The ground was covered in rubble. He pressed one hand on a stone stair several feet wide, pulled it loose, and casually tossed it aside, where it landed with a heavy rumble.

Li Xuanfeng had been trapped here for some time, but he hadn’t been idle. After all, there might be quite a few spirit items hidden in the ruins of the collapsed palaces that he could put to use.

He retrieved a bright silver lamp from the debris, brushed away the dust, and saw large words engraved on its base, Gaoping’s Xi Family.

This lamp was only at the Qi Cultivation Realm. Li Xuanfeng examined it carefully; the craftsmanship was elegant and refined. Just then, he heard Si Yuanli’s voice from the side, "When the Wei State fell, many cultivators fled south and reached the riverbank. At that time, most of the land south of the Great River was under Chu’s control. The King of Chu ordered the cultivators to stay north of the river, forbidding them to cross south.

"The Sima, Su, Xi, Xiao, and other families gathered in Jiangbei and held secret talks for several days. Led by the Li and Jiang families on both sides of the Jia River, they founded the Ning State, upheld the legacy of Wei, and made the Wanglin Upper Sect the leading immortal sect."

The collapsed palace’s roof ridge jutted high into the air. Si Yuanli sat cross-legged on top of it, resting his chin on one hand, looking rather leisurely as he continued, "Sect rivalry wasn’t so fierce at that time. All cultivators did their best for the country. Ning State made the King of Chu extremely wary, and he always viewed the later-arriving families with suspicion..."

After listening for a while, Li Xuanfeng glanced at the glowing signature of Gaoping’s Xi Family on the lamp base in his hand and said softly, "I heard the founder of the Chunyi Dao came from the Xi Family..."

"It was indeed the Gaoping’s Xi Family." Si Yuanli replied, "That person only ever listened in at Chongming Hall, so strictly speaking, it was only half of a proper Dao lineage. But the more one lacked something, the more they cared about it. I heard that person claimed allegiance to the Green Pine Temple Dao lineage for life. The Chunyi Dao was the same way—always obsessing over such things."

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly. Si Yuanli paused for a moment, then spoke softly, "Fellow Daoist, you guessed right. My Si Family originally bore the surname Sima. We were a powerful family from the north, with Purple Mansion Realm cultivators as far back as the Zhou dynasty. When Wei fell, we fled south all the way and finally settled in Jiangnan."

"So that’s your ancestral origin..." Li Xuanfeng noted.

Si Yuanli sighed softly, "The noble lineages from north and south have lasted to this day. When you look around, whose ancestors weren’t princes, marquises, or generals? It’s better not to mention it; once you do, all you can say is that their descendants are unworthy of their name."

Li Xuanfeng fell silent for a moment. At least his own family was acknowledged as Wei's Li. Then he saw Si Yuanli pause for a moment and speak softly, "My ancestor once guarded the riverbank for the Wei State, and that’s how this scroll of the Huai River Map came to be. It was drawn by the True Monarch Shangyao Cui Yan of the time... It’s a first-class ancient Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact."

Li Xuanfeng was slightly stunned and asked softly, "An ancient spirit artifact... It looks like it’s for defense and suppression. How does it compare to the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal?"

"Well..." Si Yuanli considered for a while, then shook his head as he replied, "It can’t really be compared. Besides, different spirit artifacts perform differently in different hands. In any case, both spirit artifacts are extremely formidable."

Li Xuanfeng suddenly recalled the Binding Ring and Cloudsunder that Yu Muxian had used in the past. Since Si Yuanli seemed open to conversation, he casually asked, "How does it compare to Binding Ring and Cloudsunder?"

"Hahahaha!" Si Yuanli let out a hearty laugh, raising his eyebrows with disdain, and answered, "Fellow Daoist, you must be joking! Binding Ring and Cloudsunder are imitations made by Yuanwu. Binding Ring is a copy of the Yue Cultivating Sect’s Bu Yue, while Cloudsunder is a copy of Xiu Kui Temple’s Tian Xiu. They’re already somewhat inferior to ordinary spirit artifacts. How could you compare them to an ancient spirit artifact?"

He hesitated for a couple of seconds, as if searching for a suitable analogy. Then he pulled out an ordinary dharma sword from his storage pouch and pointed at it. "This thing also came from Yuanwu Peak. It’s said to be at the Foundation Establishment Realm, but anyone can tell it was just pieced together by countless Qi Cultivation Realm refinements over time. It barely meets the Foundation Establishment Realm, has the appearance, and some qualities of Foundation Establishment Realm, but no real wonders."

The orthodox Immortal Sect disciples would never use this kind of dharma sword. Li Xuanfeng examined it carefully, found it just as Si Yuanli had described, and nodded.

Si Yuanli chuckled and said, "Fellow Daoist, comparing this thing to Fuchen Peak’s Water Wall Pearl is about the same as comparing those imitations to an ancient spirit artifact!"

The words flashed through Li Xuanfeng’s mind like lightning, and he keenly caught a certain phrase, Binding Ring dwas a copy of the Yue Cultivating Sect’s Bu Yue...

When Yu Muxian had brought out Binding Ring, Tang Shedu had mocked it endlessly, infuriating Xiao Yongling so much that even his spiritual qi changed color. Li Xuanfeng remembered that incident well. He vaguely recalled that the Xiao Family’s ancestor, Xiao Xianyou, who was once hailed as a Golden Core seedling, had been slain by a dharma artifact resembling the Binding Ring!

Whether Tang Yuanwu actually had that level of strength at the time is another question... and the Binding Ring hadn’t even been completed yet. That means it must have been that spirit artifact, Bu Yue...

Xiao Xianyou was killed by the Yue Cultivating Sect! Was it Shangyuan? Or who else?

Li Xuanfeng wasn’t curious without reason. Xiao Chuting’s actions were difficult to understand, and there was no way to infer his position. If he could get information about Xiao Xianyou, he might be able to roughly deduce Xiao Chuting’s stance, giving himself a basis to judge the situation in the future.

These direct descendants already have resources and innate abilities that are a hundred times greater than ordinary people, and most of their temperaments aren’t far off either... they monopolize the situations and relationships, leaving ordinary people clueless and at their mercy...

Li Xuanfeng thought deeply. Si Yuanli seemed also touched by the Huai River Map. The two of them fell silent, and the sky overhead had turned a pale blue. A bright glow faintly shone through, illuminating them as if they were at the bottom of a lake.

"After losing Daoist Master Qiushui’s divine abilities and suffering at the hands of all those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, Great Ning Palace finally couldn’t hold on!" Si Yuanli exhaled and laughed, "Just wait a little longer, and we can finally leave this wretched place!"

Boom!

Purple lightning roiled in the sky with a terrifying momentum. The lightning around Li Qinghong’s entire body had turned bright purple. Each feather on her feathered robe was glowing brightly.

She had slaughtered her way here without regard for cost or consumption, breaking several sieges at different crossings. Even though she had been injured, she’d also saved a lot of time.

She immediately activated the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow inside her body. Her internal mana surged and her thunder pool roared with waves of lightning. Her eyes shone with a misty purple hue, and her silver-white spear shone as it pointed forward. Silver lightning burst forth from the six tokens in her palm, descending with a thunderous crash.

Of the four northern cultivators beside Li Ximing, three were Purple Mansion and Golden Core Daos cultivators that had ingested blood qi. The last one was a true devil cultivator from the Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace. The silver lightning exploded, and they all let out pained howls.

The three blood qi-infused Purple Mansion and Golden Core Daos cultivators were better off as they were only paralyzed. However, the last devil cultivator was like a man thrown into boiling oil. His robes burst apart, and his skin bubbled with countless blisters. His blood vessels burst, and thick black smoke billowed forth.

His eyes burst from their sockets like two rotten fruits, exploding midair with a pop. The blood evaporated in an instant, and his body melted like wax, revealing pale white bones at the elbows.

"Profound Thunder!"

Li Ximing was shocked as he watched. This devil cultivator had been the most restrained in his previous battle with Li Ximing. He was often drenched in sweat under his Radiant Light and unable to move freely. Yet, thunder truly was the bane of devils. And among all lightning, Profound Thunder was supreme—he naturally couldn’t compare.

Li Qinghong had seen countless devil cultivators on her way. Her almond-shaped eyes glinted as she immediately understood that this one’s entire body had almost certainly been refined through demonic rituals, usually making him indestructible. But he was as fragile as tofu against Profound Thunder, breaking apart in just two strikes.

She rode the lightning closer, and the purple spear shadow pierced into the demonic smoke, seizing the moment when the silver lightning was still reverberating in the air. Purple light and sparrow shadows flew in, but instead of striking the devil cultivator whose body was already melting, she turned and aimed at a figure in midair.

Li Qinghong had rescued several crossings already, and had long since understood the mindset of the attackers. She wasn’t in a rush to kill the heavily wounded devil cultivator; letting him go would actually attract many cultivators to hunt him down and relieve pressure on the grand formation.

As she calculated, the cultivators themselves were miserable. Their internal mana was still trembling, yet they were being forced to use their dharma artifacts to defend. Their hearts quaked, This southern devil sect... even has a Dao lineage of thunder arts? Why are they working with the devil sect?

Li Ximing formed a spell seal and saw a round shield fly toward him in the air, humming and shimmering faintly. But its quality was truly mediocre. It had just reached him when the purple-and-white spear was already there.

Clang!

Purple lightning exploded on the round shield. The dharma artifact was struck so hard it staggered to a stop and almost flew backward. It started to give off black smoke from the sheer heat of the collision. But Li Qinghong’s spear did not pause; it thrust forward again.

Just then, a bright radiance descended, and the familiar suppressive force returned. The bright light atop the sky flickered, and a magnificent white barrier rose once again.

Battling such a fierce, thunder-wielding cultivator was already nerve-wracking and left no room for distraction. The renewed suppression caused merely a half beat of delay in the northern cultivator, but that was enough. His eyes were filled with the sight of lightning striking down on him.

Puff!

Li Qinghong was battle-hardened and experienced in spell combat. Her spear flashed, and the dharma robe on his body, as fragile as a layer of thick hide, shattered with a crack. Her spear had already pierced his chest, spraying blood.

At that moment, the dharma artifacts of the remaining devil cultivators finally arrived one after another, but they were all subdued by the Radiant Origin Pass. The man with the spear through his chest turned deathly pale, vomiting blood as he stumbled backward, desperately suppressing the lightning within him.

Li Qinghong withdrew her spear and activated the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow within her, purple lightning crackling under her boots. She pointed her spear diagonally, eyes like lightning, and coldly shouted, "Begone!"

Silver lightning spread with her words, forcing them back several steps. Li Ximing loosened the Radiant Origin Pass’s suppressive force at just the right moment. Three dharma artifacts flew out in a hurry, and the three men, as if granted amnesty, quickly retreated.

As for the devil cultivator whose body had melted earlier, he dared not linger any longer. He had long since transformed into a black mist and fled several kilometers away. He was also being chased by other streams of demonic light and continued fleeing northward at a frantic pace.

Li Qinghong stepped forward with her spear. A muffled thunder rang out, and purple lightning landed beside Li Xizhi. When she looked back, the surrounding cultivators felt a chill of fear and retreated in unison.

Li Xizhi had held his own against five opponents, which was a testament to his mastery of spell arts. He took the opportunity to rest and replenish his energy. But when he saw Li Qinghong return alone, his expression turned slightly somber.

Li Qinghong’s purple lightning shielded him; the Profound Punishment Tokens whirled around her; the Duruo Spear gleamed silver; and the Cyan Sparrow Plume shone brilliantly. Thunder itself was already fearsome, but with her late Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation strengthened by the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow, she shone even more brightly, making everyone’s expressions change in shock.

"Lightning cultivator..."

The female cultivator of the Wood Virtue shuddered slightly, her eyes filled with disbelief. Five of them had surrounded and attacked him for so long, yet they had gained nothing. They lingered unwillingly until Li Qinghong’s Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens lit up, at which point they all fled in a rush.

Li Qinghong exhaled lightly and looked into the distance, where streaks of escape light continued to converge rapidly. More and more brilliant streams of light were flowing together.

Li Xizhi moved closer to her and said softly, "Aunt, I’m afraid we can’t hold anymore."

The situation was becoming increasingly clear. The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the sky had some reservations and weren’t fully engaged; many of them were still fighting among themselves. Yet, the number of Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators flooding in was growing rapidly...

What’s more, those who had arrived so far were just rogue cultivators from the north without any background. The ones with real strength were still observing from the sidelines, ready to pounce at any moment.

"The Azure Pond Sect’s formation here isn’t exactly impressive. Even if these Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators don’t strike, the southbound devil cultivators can each throw a spell art and still tear this grand formation apart."

Once the formation beneath their feet was broken, a horde of cultivators would swarm them. There would be no point in holding this place any longer.

Li Qinghong nodded silently and said softly, "I’ve received some news. I’ll do my best to hold on for a little longer... maybe there’s still a chance."

She turned to the north. The purple light in her almond eyes dimmed, but the bright purple lightning on her robe still danced, intimidating the demons in the sky.

A patch of black cloud gradually emerged from the demonic smoke and slowly approached them. It didn’t carry an overwhelmingly demonic aura; instead, it exuded a peculiar and profound feeling.

Li Ximing frowned slightly as his Immortal Foundation burst into the air, transforming into a massive radiant pass that glowed with a searing light.

It illuminated a man in crisp, practical black robes. His face was slightly pale, and he stood with his hands behind his back. He had sharp eyebrows, and two calm gray eyes. He slowly rode on two black clouds, and held a white talisman in his hand as he stopped unhurriedly in front of them.

"Fellow Daoist, we meet again."

Yu Jiang

Li Qinghong had just seen him earlier, when she had been duelling Guo Hongjian; he was a cultivator from the Southern Sea whose aura was hard to gauge and carried an air of deep mystery.

He simply stood there, staring at Li Qinghong’s dazzling purple lightning-covered figure. His expression was naturally full of admiration, as if he were waiting for something rather than attacking.

Li Qinghong knew this person was formidable and held her spear without striking. After two seconds, she saw a streak of blue-black light shoot skyward from Chengshui Tomb in the north, rapidly spreading and dyeing half the sky blue-black.

Boom!

A thunderous roar erupted, as if something had fallen from the distant mountains, sending tremors through the earth. A hazy purple-black energy surged skyward.

The demonic smoke in the north all paused, and twisted in chaotic confusion. Some turned back north; some halted to fight among themselves; and a few continued south, becoming increasingly disordered.

She glanced worriedly, but the young man before her seemed to have been waiting for this moment to arrive, and finally spoke, "Daoist Li, the Great Ning Palace has fallen. Chengshui Tomb is filled with all sorts of relics, and the devil cultivators will surely rush to search for them, so the offensive will slow down for a while.

"I came here especially for this chance, and I ask for your guidance."

His clear voice slowly echoed in the air. Li Qinghong frowned slightly at the unexpected words and softly replied, "Li Qinghong greets you, Daoist friend. But there is a great calamity between the North and South at the moment. I fear it is not appropriate for a duel right now. Please wait until this time has passed. If I survive, you may seek me out then."

Yu Jiang looked at her seriously and replied, "I have some grudges with the Azure Pond Sect, and since you blocked the devil cultivators, I’m not too pleased."

Li Qinghong narrowed her eyes slightly. His words were contradictory, but she immediately became alert, Of course, since the southern advance of the devil cultivators was the will of several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, I greatly reduced the pressure on the defense lines by blocking them alone. As time passes, I might offend all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators...

She exhaled slightly. She started to regard the person in front of her as a cultivator sent by one of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to block her. On one hand, she was relieved he hadn’t come a moment earlier, and on the other, she drew her spear, purple lightning rippling, and softly said, "Li Qinghong of Qingdu."

"Yu Jiang of the Southern Sea," replied the man.

The young man nodded lightly, and suddenly a clap of thunder exploded by his ear. Li Qinghong’s figure vanished from where she stood. She rode a surge of purple lightning, speeding toward him with Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens spinning in her hand and shining with silver-white lightning.

"When Yang reaches its peak, it gives birth to six thunders!"

Boom!

Before her spear could reach him, a streak of silver-white lightning shot forth, but Yu Jiang glanced at the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens and formed a seal with his hand. A glistening gold rune appeared in his palm.

He said softly, "Thunder falls in Dui, resting in the sea of clouds."

In an instant, a vast ocean appeared in the air and a sparkling golden light rose from it. The silver-white lightning fell into it and disappeared like being drawn into a bottomless vortex.

The vast ocean swirled once, then condensed into a single golden talisman that fell into Yu Jiang’s hand. Li Qinghong’s Profound Thunder had been dispelled.

However, she already knew this person was formidable and was not surprised. But as the Duruo Spear carried a purple shadow and thrust forward, Yu Jiang actually raised his hand to slap at her spear.

"Hm?"

Li Qinghong’s silver spear seemed to land on something soft, bending slightly and brushing past him. The black-robed youth casually deflected a surge of purple lightning with a wave of his hand.

Clang!

Li Qinghong pulled her spear back, reversed it, and raised the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens in front of her to guard against attacks. She glanced quickly and saw that the tip of the Duruo Spear had indeed bent slightly, but it was slowly straightening out like a living thing.

"This is the Shamanic Talisman Dao technique..."

She now had a rough measure of her opponent’s strength, while Yu Jiang remained outwardly calm. Still, the hand holding the golden talisman trembled slightly, dissipating a bit of silver lightning. Clearly he wasn’t as nonchalant as he appeared.

Li Qinghong drew her spear back, but Yu Jiang raised his sleeve and lightly flicked it, releasing a few specks of black light that spun in midair, transforming into flowing talismans that quietly circled him once before falling into his eyes.

His pupils suddenly widened, staring intently. Li Qinghong felt as if thunder had exploded in her mind, seeing only darkness as drops of fresh blood dripped, and everything before her became unclear.

What a formidable spell art! Li Qinghong’s vision dimmed, giving Yu Jiang a chance to form another spell seal. His gaze fell on the Duruo Spear in her hand, and he calculated silently, That spear is not ordinary. Perhaps because of its Profound Thunder nature, it naturally restrains shape-shifting demons and evildoers. It was able to straighten itself out almost immediately after receiving my palm strike...

He placed one hand under his elbow, extended two fingers on the other hand, and pointed them at the Duruo Spear in Li Qinghong’s hand. Raising his head slightly, he intoned, "Rise, Shamanic Transformation, turn the weapon into demonkind."

Li Qinghong’s eyes briefly darkened, but a clear light surged from her dantian, sweeping away the illusions of the Shamanic Talisman Dao in her mind. Once she regained her clarity, she summoned her lightning and suddenly felt something slimy in her hand.

The Duruo Spear in her hand had turned into a white python with fine scales, opening its mouth in confusion as it tried to wriggle free. Li Qinghong gripped it tightly, realizing she had fallen into someone else’s spell rhythm.

"Command!"

She decisively spat out a Profound Thunder, and a spot of light shot from between her lips and teeth. Yu Jiang raised an eyebrow, stepped back half a step, and the air exploded with a purple thunder cascade that came crashing down. He had no choice but to pause his spell art to defend himself.

Li Qinghong seized the opportunity, pouring her vast lightning energy into her spear and completely purging the Shamanic Talisman Dao art from it. The Duruo Spear instantly regained its original form, its silver light flashing as it merged into the lightning cascade.

Yu Jiang struggled to move in the thunder cascade but managed to raise his hands, talismans glowing as he pressed both palms against the spear, trying to deflect it.

Li Qinghong was no longer playing around. Her eyes turned a bright purple-white, and terrifying lightning coursed through her body, instantly tearing his spell art apart as she thrust straight at him.

"Good!"

Yu Jiang had no choice but to avoid her strike. He gently twirled his robe, letting it be shredded in the lightning. His figure reappeared several feet away, and he spat out a mouthful of purple lightning.

Both of them stopped fighting and looked north, only to see billowing demonic smoke roaring as several magnificently dressed, awe-inspiring devil cultivators stood among the clouds, slowly pressing down from the horizon.

Clang...

But neither of them looked at the demonic smoke in front of them. Instead, they gazed farther north, where a point of golden light was rushing through the air with fierce, overbearing Astral Qi, ruthlessly tearing through the demonic smoke and rapidly approaching.

Thunder arts split the sky, wielding the spear like a wandering dragon.




# Chapter 865: Li Qinghong Side Story

This side story is a speculative future based on the Heaven Expanding Profound Talisman, beginning with the Northern-Southern conflict.

"Profound Thunder."

Silver-white mist drifted amidst the darkness as long cyan-white plumes fluttered lightly. A bluish-purple glow streamed down from the white robe of a young woman and scattered along the hem of her skirt into the dark clouds.

She looked no more than seventeen or eighteen years old, with a delicate nose and misty purple eyes. Purple and white lightning coiled around her, illuminating a breathtaking beauty.

"Long Profound Heavenly Lightning Talisman is already seventy percent spent... The summoned thunder is becoming even more powerful..."

Li Qinghong had just slain Xi Zikang and watched the young man collapse at her feet, her expression somewhat complex. The entire formation was channeling the lightning from the Long Profound Heavenly Lightning Talisman into her, and her footwork technique-infused body was nearly coalescing into lightning, naturally restoring her appearance to that of a seventeen or eighteen-year-old.

The Profound Thunder was vast, yet it was not black but rather silver-white. Xi Zikang had mentioned that the Profound Thunder was not truly profound colored thunder. In ancient times, it had been classified among the Three Thunders and was called Divine Thunder.

Later, Immortal Lord Huan Xuan had attained enlightenment in the Northern Sea, becoming the source of all thunder arts that wielded punishment and slaughter. The closer one was to the Northern Sea, the more terrifying tribulation lightning became. The Purple-Gold Devil Dao then migrated southward, and from that point on, it was no longer called Divine Thunder but rather, using the northern symbol Profound to represent it, became known as Profound Thunder. Hence its silver-white hue.

Mist-like silver-white lightning drifted through the air. Li Qinghong climbed the white steps one by one. Figures either stood or knelt in the main hall below—some on the verge of death, while others slowly transformed into lightning.

A few cultivators knelt sporadically, while thunderous voices roared furiously in the grand hall above.

"Zhang Yuanyu!

"Zhang Yuanyu!"

Each time that voice echoed in the air, countless silver-white lightning bolts lit up the endless darkness above like a spiderweb, flashing briefly and leaving behind a chorus of rumbles.

"Zhang Yuanyu!"

Li Qinghong took another step forward on the steps before the grand hall. It was as if time that had been frozen began to flow again. The silver-white lightning cascaded back down the steps, and the voice roared once more, now tinged with a cold hatred, "Zhang Yuanyu... why did Taiyu die?"

The voice lingered for a moment, then left a profound silence. No reply came from the other side, but a soft shower of golden rain fell through the cracks in the tightly closed hall doors, dotting her face like tiny stars.

Dazzling lightning poured down the steps again, illuminating the carvings on the pillars and stairs in a brilliant silver-white that cast shifting light on her face.

The voice sounded again, cold and grim, "Metal says transformation! Metal says transformation!

"And what about you, Zhang Yuanyu? Did you not lend a helping hand with the fall of Great Liang and Taiyue’s rise to Fruition Attainment?"

These words rolled forth like waves, then turned into a golden rain as they left the hall, fluttering toward her face. A crisp, pleasing sound rang in her ears like tiny bells as the cyan-white plumes on her clothes gave off a delicate metallic clink.

Chaotic illusions arose before her eyes. There were crowds of people, rivers of blood, chariots thundering across the plains, broken swords, and swirling dust.

Zhang Yuanyu...

Li Qinghong paused slightly as an ethereal yet calm and clear voice drifted in, "Daoist friend, how much of the Profound Thunder Dao lineage remains? Moreover, how much strength do you truly have as a mere residual position of the Hearing Chime Seat? Why meddle here?"

"Zhang Yuanyu!" The voice cracked like muffled thunder, echoing in the air, deep and resonant, "You old thing..."

Countless silver-white talismans rose from the top to the bottom of the white steps. Silver-white lightning surged upward, and thick, dense thunderclouds gathered above Li Qinghong’s head.

Profound lightning appeared on her robe, and the Long Profound Heavenly Lightning Talisman transformed into a point of purple light that flickered like a star above her head, sometimes near and sometimes far. Li Qinghong’s vision gradually blurred.

Boom!

A bolt of lightning flashed by, and the Long Profound Heavenly Lightning Talisman slowly activated, enveloping her in the Heart-Questioning Spell. Li Qinghong faintly heard a deep, cold voice, "Dongfang Weiming also wants to seize the Profound Thunder. You two old things have clearly colluded... Good... very good!"

***

The sunlight was fragmented, resting on the yellow-green treetops of autumn, and the light before her eyes was sliced into several segments by drifting dust, streaming down like liquid gold and landing on the boy’s profile.

His gray pupils slowly shrank in the sunlight, reflecting Li Qinghong’s youthful face. Her gaze traveled down his cheek and paused at his lips, watching them part and close, his lips red and teeth white.

"Sister."

Li Qinghong realized that her arm was still tender, with bead-like sweat dripping down its curve. Her arm was not overly pale, but the color of youth made it uniquely and strikingly beautiful.

Ding-dang...

A silver ring on the wooden spear in her hand spun, jingling as the spear tip danced among the osmanthus flowers on the treetops. Bright yellow blossoms were lifted by the spear tip and fell onto her wrist.

Ding-dang... ding-dang...

The crisp sound rose and fell, and she remembered this was the training method she had practiced when she was ten. She was spinning the silver ring to poke at the osmanthus flowers, knocking down just one blossom without letting a leaf fall or a flower shatter.

At that time, Li Qinghong already had some cultivation and could do it easily, so she deliberately caught the flower on her wrist, partly because it looked nice, and partly because it was more challenging.
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝚠𝕖𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝕖𝚕.𝚌𝗼𝗺

The boy before her sat quietly in the sunlight, his lips still parting and closing. Li Qinghong’s vision blurred as his gray eyes moved closer and farther. She wanted to look at her brother longer and couldn’t help but mouth the words he was saying, "Sister."

A purple-black light shimmered in his gray pupils, reflecting a purple thunder pool within. She faintly glimpsed lightning leaping like snakes and dragons inside.

Half of his face was bathed in sunlight, and his lips trembled, "This... is your era."

His gray pupils widened, and he stared calmly at Li Qinghong, saying, "What about us... sister..."

Li Qinghong stared at him. Her younger brother Li Yuanyun had no achievements to speak of, and had died violently as a mere mortal, his bones lost and unrecovered.

His gray pupils stared at her. Li Yuanyun’s face was seventy percent like their father Li Xuanling’s and also bore a strong resemblance to their grandfather Li Tongya, with long brows and deep-set eyes. This similarity, combined with his wasted, tragic death, left Li Qinghong feeling suffocated.

"What about us... sister..."

His lips softly closed, and Li Qinghong felt a chill in her heart as the scene before her blurred, and more voices emerged, "You want to forge six wheels and refine the will of divine powers, to slay immortals and demons, to guard the land and bring peace to the people. Good, sister, I have this aspiration too.

"Sister, what should I do?"

Yuanyun... thought Li Qinghong.

Li Qinghong looked at his gray-black pupils as words stuck in her throat. She remembered her own youth had been too rushed. She could still comfort her brother when she had just begun cultivating, but later they hardly saw each other at all.

She had to refine the six wheels, practice spear techniques, and continue her thunder arts cultivation, and the family’s affairs grew heavier by the day. Li Qinghong did not even have enough time for herself...

Later, when she saw Li Yuanyun again, the boy had to bow and call her eldest sister. He had become the Li Family’s first male who could not cultivate, despite being the legitimate grandson of the renowned Li Tongya.

This stayed until Li Yuanyun died in the market, leaving Li Qinghong both shocked and furious. In the end, she had captured Qiu Ji and used thunder to refine him, emerging from the demonic clouds, yet her heart found no peace.

What had once burned in her heart as hatred now became clearer. Li Qinghong reached out to stroke her brother’s face, and everything before her suddenly faded.

"Yun’er..."

***

Boom!

A sharp crack of thunder suddenly jolted Li Qinghong out of her illusion. The lightning flowed down the white steps before her, the illusion dissipating like wind, and her gaze fell back on the scene before her.

Lightning churned in the sky, as Li Qinghong watched quietly. There were various spell markings and illustrations on the walls of the grand hall. Unlike her family’s Celestial Thunder, these lightning bolts mostly appeared silver-white and crawled slowly along the walls.

Silver-white lightning hung from the sky like liquid, extending deep into the boundless darkness. Li Qinghong opened her eyes slightly, and the grand hall before her was now close at hand.

The rolling silver lightning danced, and the murals on the walls shifted constantly. One moment, it was transforming into a dragon and a serpent devouring each other, the next into a person raising a sword to the sky, and another into a broken sword dissolving into a single bead.

Li Qinghong had never been accustomed to using the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens and had left them on Zongquan Island. The Duruo Spear still shone brightly as it continued to tremble in her hand.

The Duruo Spear was a silver-white spear that was originally of the Profound Thunder lineage and not part of the Celestial Thunder. However, many Celestial Thunder treasures had also been refined into it during its forging. This spear had accompanied Li Qinghong through life and death. It had been tempered by her blood and spirit, and had long since become one with her.

She stepped onto the white steps. The rumbling in the hall had ceased, but the golden rain still splattered against her skirt, making its hem tremble slightly.

"Zhang Yuanyu... the Fruition Attainment of Metal Virtue, and his surname is Zhang, he must be that True Monarch from the Golden Feather Sect."

The words of one at the level of True Monarch carried immediate magical effects. He must have fought in this hall, leaving behind echoes that, along with various visions, still reverberated, sometimes as golden rain and sometimes as white lightning.

This True Monarch of the thunder lineage might have already perished, and the white lightning that marked the beginning of his fall was incredibly dense, with spiritual lightning flowing down, brushing past both sides of her.

The grand hall’s doors were tightly shut. There were carvings of surging waters on both sides of the door. Ferocious dragon kings loomed faintly in the stormy rain and sea, and above, immortals stood calmly with hands folded behind their backs, a command token floating before them.

Below was inscribed, Falling Water, Rising Storm.

"Falling Water, Rising Storm..."

Xi Zikang had once said that the master of this hall had slain the fourth son of the True Hornless Dragon to attain enlightenment. Now Li Qinghong understood.

"Why is there this spiritual aura of Falling Water, Rising Storm? Why did Dongfang You fail to refine the Converging Water and die instead, resulting in falling water and rising storm?"

"It fits the struggle between Converging Water and Profound Thunder... The son of the True Hornless Dragon died by thunder, and from then on, whenever a Dragon Clan’s Converging Water line perished and water fell, thunder would inevitably rise."

Li Qinghong’s face brightened and darkened in turn under the silver-white lightning. All kinds of illusions gathered before her once again, and the grand hall suddenly seemed to recede into the distance, replaced by a bright moonlight.

***

Moonlight gathered before her eyes, and the white steps of the thunderpool in front of Li Qinghong transformed into a clear, bright lake. The dark green water rippled with glints of light, and pale white moonlight cascaded down as she stood among the clouds. Before her stood a middle-aged man.

His brows were long and arched, his bearing broad and composed. He wore a flowing gray robe, holding a sword and carrying another on his back, both sheathed.

His calm gray eyes turned toward her, and he spoke gently, "Qinghong, that boy from the Fei Family probably has some feelings for you. What do you think?"

Grandfather!

Her heart ached, and in her ears, her own voice from her spirited youth rang out, "I have no interest in romance and do not wish to become anyone’s wife or concubine!"

Li Qinghong realized that she had not yet faced much hardship back then. Both her elder brothers were alive, and her father and grandfather were the family’s pillars. The girl’s voice was still bright, echoing over the lake, "Though I am not a man, I too aspire to refine the six wheels and hone divine abilities, to slay immortals and demons, to guard the land and bring peace to the people. Let the red tassel of my spear move, and heroes falter and immortals bow their heads!"

Li Qinghong remembered those words but had long buried them deep in her memories. She looked at Li Tongya before her, who lowered his brow slightly, paused for several breaths, then spoke a single word, "Hard!"

Hard!

Li Tongya gave her just one word, but it carried all the decades of struggle she had faced. At the time, she had not even registered Li Tongya’s answer.

Now, as she recalled it, Li Qinghong’s eyes finally grew moist and muttered, "Hard!"

Li Yuanxiu had been murdered; Li Xuanling fell at Zhenhui Temple; and Li Tongya had slain Yu Xiaogui with his sword and perished. Later, her younger brother Li Yuanyun died an ignoble death, her second brother Li Yuanjiao died at Green Pine Temple... Li Yuexiang, Li Xuanfeng, Li Chengliao, Li Xijun... Li Qinghong was not one to show her emotions, but that did not mean she did not feel pain.

Meeting her grandfather’s gaze, which was as warm as ever, Li Qinghong’s voice grew hoarse as she softly said, "Grandfather... If the Great Dao lies ahead and there is a chance to attain divine abilities, yet the risk is nine deaths out of ten and I fear it will shake the very foundations of the clan, should I take that step or not...

"I also understand Ximing’s thoughts. On one side is the endlessly tempting path of the Dao, on the other, the interests of our brothers in the family. How can one separate the two..."

Li Tongya watched silently, as Li Qinghong’s voice grew even quieter, "Grandfather... Uncle Xuanfeng took the Human Pill... but what could we have done?

"When I was young, I thought that righteousness was righteousness, that good was good and evil was evil, and that doing good was enough.

"But now I see that we cultivators are a hundred or a thousand times stronger than mortals. Thus, doing good is extremely difficult, yet doing evil is all too easy. Yet merit cannot offset the sin of killing!

"If it could be offset, then Chi Wei, who saved millions but devoured hundreds of thousands, or saved a hundred thousand but ate one, wouldn’t he have canceled it out completely? Thus, a single crime, a single evil, is a lifelong stain..."

She spoke in a low voice, "Grandfather... it seems to me that our family today is like a boat traveling through muddy water. All things are pure at the beginning, but when things get stirred, there will inevitably be traces of mud. After a hundred years of navigating, stains have already appeared...

"I don’t wish to complain about the ways of the world, but there is certainly no such thing as a perfectly pure, spotless world. In every generation, which family is without sin? ...Is eating people only a sin when they are in your mouth? Which family’s hands are not stained with human blood?"

She slowly raised her head, her voice hoarse yet still pleasant to the ear, "Grandfather, how is it that we are always guilty? Is there truly no path in the mortal world but sin or death?"

Li Tongya before her watched her quietly, one hand resting on her head. His voice was as warm and gentle as ever, "Don’t take it too heavily, each generation does what it must..."

***

Boom!

Thunder echoed in the sky as Li Qinghong gradually came to her senses. Before her was a white stone staircase ascending into the endless void, surrounded by raging lightning.

Li Qinghong’s eyes gradually cleared as she stepped onto the final stair, its surface dense with patterns that glowed with a silver-white light.

Purple lightning flowed from her slender hand, sliding down the white steps into the Thunder Pool below. Li Qinghong held her spear pointed diagonally toward the ground, her long hair fluttering in the wind like ink dissolving in the endless purple, her eyes contrasting strikingly in black and white.

The thunderpool behind her kept surging. A middle-aged man knelt at its edge, his massive thunder-imbued axe shattered into a chaotic mess of fragments that danced on the ground under the pull of lightning. Black blood gushed from his lips, quickly turning into white lightning that rose into the sky.

Yet he lifted his head and laughed wildly, "Purple Lightning Primordial Radiance Secret Technique! Hahahahahaha!"

His laughter aggravated his wounds, and black blood spurted again, turning white in midair. Without turning his head, he transformed into lightning and shot upward, shouting loudly, "Li Qinghong! Li Qinghong...

"Above the thunder is the dragon! Above the thunder is the dragon! Thun—pfft..."

Li Qinghong turned her face slightly, the raging lightning sweeping her black hair behind her ear. Her voice was cold and pleasant, like the soft chime of a bell, "I know."

Her cyan-white feathered robe glowed with silver-white lightning. Her profile shone bright in the light, tinged with an apricot-white luster that reached her chin.

She stepped forward until she reached the front of the grand hall. Six stone slabs extended to the entrance before her. They glowed bright silver-white, with even brighter patterns blooming across them.

Nine enormous pillars stood in a row, each entwined with itself and seamlessly integrated with the main columns. Dazzling white runes soared upward, circling and leaping around the pillars.

Thread-like lightning crackled as they wove through the runes. Her cloth shoes disintegrated in the dazzling thunder, leaving her barefoot on the stone slabs.

Li Qinghong, draped in a long-feathered cyan robe, stepped across the shining white stone slabs and approached the grand hall doors. She placed a slender hand lightly upon them and slowly pushed.

Faces began to appear before her eyes, her father Li Xuanling’s steady, gentle brows; her mother Lu Wanrong’s sorrowful expression; her elder brother Li Yuanxiu’s bright profile; Li Yuanjiao’s cold and sinister gaze; Li Xuanxuan’s look of hopeful concern...

Boom!

The bright white doors emitted a sharp crack of thunder, as ferocious dragons on both sides roared. The carvings of the watching immortals slowly sank into darkness, revealing a vague purple-black glow.

Li Qinghong gazed quietly into the hall.

There was nothing inside but an endless, boundless black void. Two beams of golden light fell from the sky, illuminating her face.

A handsome youth in an immaculate cloud-patterned Daoist robe stood in the void. He bowed slightly toward her and said softly, "I am Dongfang Heyun. Daoist friend, please follow me inside."

He led Li Qinghong forward into the endless black void. His voice was clear and polite, "Daoist friend, please look."

Dongfang Heyun extended his hand into the black void. Li Qinghong looked closely, focusing her sight to its utmost, and at last, she saw countless faint white lightning currents spiraling and twisting through the darkness, stretching endlessly into the sky.

The lightning that fell from the sky came from the mouth of a pitch-black abyss. This object was unimaginably massive, extending all the way up to the pinnacle of the black void before coiling downward into the deep darkness at its base.

The two golden suns hung directly above her. She and the grand hall doors behind her were so tiny they looked like small dots of light, as they vanished in the endless purple-black void.

"Dragon!"




# Chapter 867: Urgent Persuasion

Yu Jiang lifted his head to gaze at the Astral Qi tearing through the sky, trailing a long golden flame. Its golden light was as brilliant as a sword that split a dark cloud in two. His expression remained unchanged, but he silently stepped back as the golden light manifested before him.

Clad in thunder, Li Qinghong twirled her slender hand, retracting her long spear, which now hung upside down behind her as purple lightning rained down. A man in platinum armor appeared beside her.

The man had a broad chest, sharp eyes, and was slightly taller than Li Qinghong. He was clad in armor and wielded a massive, fierce golden bow. He hovered in the air, invisible Astral Qi spreading around him.

His eyes under long eyebrows opened like an eagle’s, scanning the heavy demonic clouds.

"Second Uncle!" Li Qinghong said delightedly, and the man in platinum armor nodded slowly, raising his gaze to meet Yu Jiang’s eyes.

His eyes were only slightly cold, but Yu Jiang involuntarily gritted his teeth, feeling as if ice and snow had fallen on him from head to calf. The young man forced himself not to look away and quietly met the gaze.

He saw the man’s brow twitch upward, his black-gray pupils slowly dilating, and all the fierce killing intent dissipated. The man’s lips trembled, and Yu Jiang heard a hoarse voice, "You..."

The youth felt frozen stiff all over, but that single word made hot blood surge to his head. His hand clutching the talisman twitched twice, and a strange thought crossed his mind, His voice sounds much older than his face.

Yu Jiang raised his hand and touched his storage pouch, taking something out. He tried to steady his voice but couldn’t help the slight tremble as he said, "Senior."

He produced a golden arrow, heavy and cold, with bright feathers at the tail. Its arrowhead was finely polished and shining with a faint glow.

A few small characters were carved on the shaft, Li Xuanfeng of Yi Mountain.

The bold script revealed the owner’s spirit. The man’s gaze fell on the arrow, and the youth even felt it grow heavier in his hand. Li Xuanfeng then intently examined Yu Jiang’s eyes and brows.

The youth maintained his composure and spoke softly, "This is yours, Senior. I am returning it."

Li Xuanfeng’s gaze lingered on the arrow for a moment. Yu Jiang vaguely heard his restrained breathing, then that slightly hoarse voice sounded again, "So it was you."

Those words felt like they burned the youth, and he immediately closed his eyes. His figure turned from black to gray, then slowly faded away, leaving behind a wisp of black smoke that drifted away in the air, vanishing without a trace.

Li Xuanfeng still stood steadily, the dimly glowing arrow floating in the air. His emotions were hidden beneath his iron-hard demeanor, and no one could see anything from his face.

Astral Qi twisted in the air, occasionally brushing against Li Qinghong’s Cyan Sparrow Plume and producing a sharp, grating sound. Li Qinghong carefully studied Li Xuanfeng’s face, then recalled Yu Jiang’s face, her expression turning thoughtful.

Li Xuanfeng maintained his rigid posture, his voice slightly hoarse as he spoke softly, "So it was you..."

Li Qinghong stood beside him as a beam of green light streaked across the sky and landed nearby, revealing a middle-aged man with a sword at his waist, exuding a touch of elegance. He stared solemnly at the dark clouds in the north, his expression grave.

This is bad!

"Brother Xuanfeng!"

This man was naturally Si Yuanli. He and Li Xuanfeng had just escaped from Chengshui Tomb in Great Ning Palace and rushed over just in time to see the rolling demonic smoke.

He knew well the filth between the various sects and the schemes between the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. When he saw the rolling demonic smoke along the way and recalled that all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were trapped inside, his heart trembled.

He whispered, "Brother Xuanfeng... I fear this is the plot of another sect! This is trouble..."

Si Yuanli glanced carefully across the river, then immediately turned to look at Li Qinghong behind him and asked quietly, "Where is Chi Zhiyan? Is he stationed at the rear? Who is in charge of the riverbank defense? Have him come out to see me at once!"

Though Si Yuanli had recently kept a low profile in Great Ning Palace, in the end, he was highly valued and Si Boxiu’s direct descendant. Even though he usually held no position within the sect, he did not need to bow to Chi Zhiyun!

Moreover, although the Si Family was small in number and usually kept a low profile, Si Boxiu was fiercely protective of his own. Even Si Yuanbai, known to be kind, once threw twelve Rain Summoning Talismans at Yuanwu Peak in a fit of anger and nearly flooded it.

His words were cold and instantly revealed his status, but Li Qinghong returned the courtesy with a light bow and said gently, "Reporting to Senior, there is no one in charge of the riverbank."

Si Yuanli seemed to vaguely understand and replied coldly, "Where is Chi Zhiyan?!"

"My Lord is still at Mount Bianyan." Li Qinghong’s voice was gentle and her etiquette impeccable as she politely replieddaid, "My Lord took his trusted followers to guard Mount Bianyan to observe the situation within the devil cultivators, so as to better plan for us."

She spoke politely, but when he saw Li Xizhi beside her look away and Li Ximing curl his lip, Si Yuanli immediately understood and laughed in anger. "What a coward! He’s not even worth a hair of his brother! He’s still worrying about that at a time like this? Sitting back while the riverbank collapses and all the cultivators rush in to seize Jiangnan’s lands?"

Si Yuanli’s eyes narrowed, and a chill suddenly crept into his heart, "The man may be greedy and timid, but he’s no fool... Could it be that he knows Chi Tianxing and others died in Anhuai Heaven, leaving the Chi Family without Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Does he now fear losing control, and wants to cut off branches to preserve the trunk?

"But Chi Zhiyun is still around... Could Chi Zhiyun have already gone into seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm?"

Growing up in the sect, Si Yuanli was especially sensitive to these factional struggles. The Si Family was small in number, and the Chi Family wasn’t much better. However, the Chi Family’s internal struggles had grown increasingly intense in recent years. It was a dire situation.

He felt uneasy at this thought. He lightly brushed the silk pouch at his waist, took out a small bright bead, and blew on it, instantly releasing a wisp of white wind.

The wind enveloped them all, isolating them from the outside world. Only then did Si Yuanli’s expression darken as he spoke, "I just remembered something... The Chi Family only have a few direct descendants from two generations, and now they’re dead in Anhuai Heaven. Daoist Master Buzi has been missing for years. How could Chi Zhiyan not be afraid?

"Although the devil plague was terrifying and many direct descendants from various families died, the best among them survived thanks to Li Xuanfeng holding off Tang Shedu at Chengshui Tomb. Instead, they seized a lot of resources... completed many cultivation techniques, and even learned many secrets...

"There aren’t many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in these families, but every one of them clawed their way up. There aren’t any disposable guest cultivators among them. Just look at your esteemed family, and you’ll understand..."

Si Yuanli’s eyes narrowed as he spoke in a low voice, "The Azure Pond Sect is different from the Golden Feather Sect, it exploits far too harshly. The Golden Feather Sect has plenty of family and rogue Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators they can throw at the slaughter. But which Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator left alive in the Azure Pond Sect’s territory is an easy target? They can only carve flesh from their own bodies...

"Most of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators lost in the north-south struggle were the Azure Pond Sect’s guest cultivators and Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Once Chi Zhiyan counted the losses, he must have realized he couldn’t afford any more. That’s why he’s consolidating power and using this crisis to cut away everyone’s strength!"

Si Yuanli’s voice remained quiet. "I understand now... The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were simply convenient meat for the Azure Pond Sect to carve up. Chi Zhiyan reacted quickly, immediately choosing a method that balanced gains and losses to minimize his own damage."

Li Qinghong’s heart cleared. How could she not understand after that? She thought silently, So some of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who bear deeper grudges against the Azure Pond Sect are not satisfied!

Li Qinghong glanced silently at Li Xuanfeng, and suddenly understood the message Kong Tingyun had brought from Daoist Master Changxi. She thought to herself, Perhaps that message wasn’t meant for me at all... but for Second Uncle!

She used a secret technique to transmit her voice, "Second Uncle! I passed by Profound Peak Gate earlier, and Daoist Friend Tingyun brought a message from Daoist Master Changxi..."

Li Xuanfeng listened carefully, and at last his expression changed. His sharp brows relaxed, and his voice turned deep and hoarse as he muttered, "Flooding the seedlings and wiping out a hundred years of harvest is certainly satisfying. But when the river flows back and drowns the steps of the courtyard, that’s even more gratifying."

His words seemed like a recitation, but they made Si Yuanli shiver in fear as he turned to stare blankly at Li Xuanfeng. How could he not understand the meaning of those words? As long as the riverbank was harder to swallow than Mount Bianyan, then naturally the river would flow back to attack Mount Bianyan in the devil cultivator’s isolated heartland!

But Mount Bianyan contained the Chi Family’s direct descendants! Compared to the severe losses the Azure Pond Sect families suffered from the flooding of the seedlings, it was truly drowning the courtyard steps, the Chi Family’s direct line. It would truly wound them to the bone!

When Si Yuanli heard this, his heart was pounding like a drum, and all the blood rushed to his head, River flowing back... river flowing back...

Such a counterattack was extremely brilliant. It was so legitimate that even Chi Zhiyan couldn’t pick a flaw in it. Yet Si Yuanli hesitated, to the point that the dharma light on his body flickered faintly...

He certainly enjoyed seeing the Chi Family make a fool of themselves; he’d even laugh heartily at the deaths of Chi Tianxing and Chi Fuju. Yet in the end, the Chi, Si, Ning, and Tang families were all one body. Though he’d suffered much oppression in terms of benefits, he’d never harbored the intention to actively persecute them...

This method was good, even legitimate, but who with eyes couldn’t see it? Making that decision meant offending the Chi Family! When he heard those words spoke aloud, even someone as composed as he felt a sense of panic in his heart. Though his face remained calm, the hand gripping his sword hilt turned white.

Li Xuanfeng slowly raised his head, his eyes sharp enough to terrify and his voice cold and hoarse, but his words struck right at Si Yuanli’s heart.

"Daoist Friend Yuanli... why would the Daoist Master give the Huai River Map to me?!"

This is an ancient spirit artifact originally meant to guard the riverbank... guard the riverbank! Could it be for this very moment?!

That straightforward statement shattered Si Yuanli’s psychological defenses, as a cold fear, like ten thousand years of black ice, rose in his heart. The meaning was perfectly clear, Si Boxiu himself also supported this move!

But the Daoist Master clearly didn’t tell me beforehand!

Si Yuanli was instantly thrown into confusion. Yuan Xiu had never shown any dislike towards the Chi Family, and he’d even often treated them courteously. He’d even gone so far as to ask people to bring the Chi Family to Great Ning Palace, he couldn’t have tried harder...

But the thoughts of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are unfathomable. Who knows what the Daoist Master was really thinking...

His heart sank. Across from him, Li Xuanfeng’s gravelly voice aligned perfectly with his own thoughts, Chi Tianxing and Chi Fuju were also specifically invited by the Daoist Master...

The same words, from his mouth, carried a completely different flavor. Chi Tianxing and Chi Fuju were now probably unrecognizable corpses in Anhuai Heaven. Si Yuanli couldn’t help but feel suspicious, Could the Daoist Master have done this on purpose?

All the evidence pointed to Si Boxiu’s instructions, yet Si Yuanli couldn’t help but feel a lingering doubt. Every clue now darted through his mind along with Li Xuanfeng’s words, making his head pound as though it might split open.

Li Xuanfeng simply spread his hands, revealing a small golden talisman in his palm that was only two fingers wide and filled with pure white patterns. He said coldly, "Brother Yuanli! You can see for yourself; this talisman was handed to me privately by the Daoist Master! Perhaps it was for this very moment! It shouldn’t be shown in private, but the urgency of the situation leaves no choice!"

He spoke solemnly, "The Daoist Master saved my life from Maha’s hands and helped me greatly. I remember that in my heart. As long as Brother Yuanli gives the order, I will certainly act! But if Brother Yuanli wants to abandon the river and leave..."

Li Xuanfeng’s expression was calm as he spoke quietly, "Of course, I will hand over the spirit artifact and talisman to Brother Yuanli. But I cannot disregard the millions of people behind me. I will stay here and defend them to the very end!"

Si Yuanli didn’t even need to look closely. This talisman was extremely powerful, and he’d personally seen the Daoist Master refine it with his divine abilities. He never expected to find it in Li Xuanfeng’s hands.

He silently took a breath, unable to find words, and murmured, "How can this be..."

Beside them, Li Qinghong had understood everything. She stepped forward and urged softly but urgently, "Senior... I won’t speak of my own private concerns in my home region. Even if we can’t hold this place, my family still has the means to protect itself! But behind this river are millions of common people... all depending on us!"

Si Yuanli fell silent, but the devil cultivators across the river could no longer hold back. The heavy devil winds slowly approached. The white mist dissipated, returning into the bead in Si Yuanli’s hand.

Li Xuanfeng turned slightly, and finally took action.

Clang!

He raised his bow, brilliant golden light gathering along the string. A sharp buzzing sound rang in everyone’s ears, and the man’s eyes filled with a fierce killing intent. His voice thundered like rolling lightning, carried by the wind.

"Li Xuanfeng of Bianyan is here. Step forward and die!"

The voice, powered by mana, rolled through the thick black smoke like thunder rolling in the clouds.

"Li Xuanfeng of Bianyan is here. Step forward and die..."

"Step forward and die..."

The voice spread among the demonic sounds, actually halting the restless demonic clouds on the horizon. The gathered cultivators looked at each other, but no one dared take the first step.

Only the river below continued to flow. The man in platinum armor hovered above, his cold eyes watching. He had halted the cultivators with a single shout. He regarded the thousands of devil cultivators before the river as if they were nothing.

He slowly turned to look back, his sharp eyes calm, and spoke in a low voice, "Intimidation can only work for a moment. Brother Yuanli, make your decision quickly!"

His voice spread through the air, prompting Lingu Lanying and the others not far away to raise their heads. Si Yuanli’s face flushed faintly.

He exhaled heavily from deep in his chest and said solemnly, "Hold!"

As his words fell, the eyebrows of the man before him slowly rose. The icy calm demeanor faded away as a savage expression, like that of a tiger or a leopard, took over his face.

A smile slowly curved his lips, and he showed the same wild arrogance he’d worn at the age of six when his uncle had pulled him from a mountain of corpses.

Golden light flared, and a frozen voice rang out, "Xuanfeng obeys."




# Chapter 869: Lingering Sunlight Over The Huai River

The wind along the riverbank was fierce, with dark black rocks scattered among the river waters. The jagged stones created eddies in the flow, some calm, others turbulent. Occasionally the reflections of the sky could be seen in the bends where the water was smooth.

However, there was a single point of brightness amid the dense night fog.

A man in platinum armor rose high into the sky, shining like a white star in the dim night, radiating a blazing light. The cultivators in the north hesitated for a moment, then all looked up at him.

"Li Xuanfeng of Bianyan..."

The crowd of cultivators did not just have rogue cultivators and family cultivators, but also experts. They were all silently waiting for something. The entire stretch of the river from north to south fell eerily silent, leaving only the sound of the surging water.

Si Yuanli was also a decisive man. Once he’d made his decision, his mindset shifted immediately. His sword aura was ethereal as he stood beside Li Xuanfeng.

There were many cultivators on the northern bank, yet they were divided into several factions. Several Buddhist cultivators and Master Monks gradually arrived, settling in the back like immovable mountains. The front was mostly made of family and rogue cultivators conscripted from the northern counties, with their sects often a mix of Daoist, Buddhist, and demonic practitioners. It made for a complicated scene.

The rogue cultivators and minor sect cultivators were clearly much simpler; they were either purely practicing Daoist or devil cultivation, or sometimes both. In any case, they were all demonic in nature, with no real conflict. They were mixed with devil cultivators from all over the southern and northern regions. There were even some from overseas, all here to fish for profit. It made for a chaotic gathering.

Si Yuanli watched for a while and even saw some Zhao State’s banners. He wasn’t surprised; Zhao’s imperial court had become a puppet of the Buddhist Dao, but unlike Wu and Yue, it wasn’t just an empty shell. The Buddhist cultivators used Zhao’s court to conscript cultivators, and it looked more legitimate that way.

He turned to Li Qinghong and spoke softly, "Buddhist cultivators from the Way of Emptiness, Compassion, and Virtuous are gradually arriving. The northern bank is no longer as chaotic and leaderless as before. Buddhist cultivators like to seize the destiny and fortune of this north-south conflict; they definitely won’t give up easily. We must remain vigilant."

Boom!

Thunder rumbled twice in the clouds when he finished. The dim, dark smoke rose, and Li Xuanfeng stood in mid-air, bow in hand and bathed in golden light. The cultivators he had halted with his shout began to press forward again after more than ten seconds.

Brilliant platinum light shimmered in the air, beams of bright light shooting out, piercing the night across the river. The man released the string and drew a scroll from his waist.

The scroll wasn’t large and looked quite ordinary, yet now all eyes from north and south were focused on him alone. Every burning gaze fell on that scroll, some curious, some suspicious; all their pupils followed its every movement.

Li Xuanfeng’s eyes also fell on the spirit artifact. He poured his spiritual sense and mana into it. The ivory-white hook fastener untied itself, and the long scroll unfurled, forming a sheet of white in the air.

Li Xuanfeng personally held the scroll and took in its contents at a glance. It was a vast depiction of the Huai River region. The depiction covered five thousand kilometers of the river, with rich scenery of vividly lifelike birds and beasts on both banks. It was far longer than the river at his feet as it wound and twisted its way until it flowed grandly into the Eastern Sea.

His gaze followed the scroll all the way to the end, "Huai River Map, Boye Cui Yan, Year 317 of Zhenghe."
𝚏𝕣𝐞𝗲𝐰𝕖𝐛𝐧𝕠𝕧𝚎𝚕.𝐜𝚘𝗺

When the scroll opened, countless red light streams burst forth, swirling like fireflies in the air. Li Xuanfeng’s voice was slightly hoarse, but sonorous and powerful, "Shining in the Profound Mystery, remnants of sunlight over the Huai River..."

His voice was drawn into the scroll the moment he spoke. The sky instantly brightened, and the clouds transformed into a brilliant golden hue as a sheet of bright light fell from the heavens.

Below, Li Ximing’s pupils slowly widened. His Immortal Foundation seemed to stir, letting out a series of rumbles. A dazzling brilliance was reflected in his eyes as he murmured, "Bright Yang..."

Before tens of thousands of onlookers, a golden light flew out from the scroll and descended from the sky. A brilliant radiance appeared beneath Li Xuanfeng’s feet. The great river had turned into a bright, clear golden stream.

The bright river continued to surge forward. A shadow faintly emerged on the water’s surface, and a second later, a tall pass rose from beneath the water, breaking through the surface and soaring into the sky.

The pass stretched on without end, its patterns intricate and bright. The white bricks fitted together perfectly, with a jade-like color that shone even brighter. It exuded an ancient yet elegant beauty as it rose into the sky.

Splash!

The heads of the assembled cultivators slowly lifted as their eyes followed the pass into the air. Golden river water shimmered as it cascaded down the pass like countless golden waterfalls.

"An ancient spirit artifact... Huai River Map" A voice from the north murmured. The words echoed among the cultivators, sounding especially sharp in the quiet atmosphere.

The sky grew dim once more. The man in platinum armor stood atop the hundred-zhang pass dividing north and south like an ancient celestial general. Behind him, white illusions formed concentric rings of light, illuminating the space at his side.

Countless mysteries rose in Li Xuanfeng’s mind, and both of his Immortal Foundations received some kind of blessing. Thick mana surged outward, allowing him to lightly float in the air. The Heavenly Gilded Helm covering his body shone more clearly than ever, exuding a fierce and mighty aura along with dazzling platinum light.

Buzz.

He raised his bow, and a mysterious arrow immediately fell onto the string. Sharp light began to flicker along the bow, and powerful Astral Qi spread behind him, leaving golden trails that occasionally put his face in shadow.

Whoosh...

A flash of golden brilliance streaked through the air. All the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators felt a sudden alarm in their hearts and hastily raised their dharma artifacts in panic. The cultivators on the riverbank froze all at once as colorful dharma artifacts, red, orange, green, rose into the air, creating a dazzling display.

Boom!

But the head of a middle-aged cultivator standing on the northern bank exploded with a bang. The dharma artifact in his hand was torn through like thin paper, raining down on the others in a flurry. The blast of dharma light and Astral Qi erupted, producing a deafening roar.

Rumble!

The surrounding cultivators all backed away. This person hadn’t even taken a single blow before being killed on the spot. His only claim to existence was a red mist rising to the sky, transforming into a crimson light like a sunset glow.

"A phenomenon... that’s truly dead!" The elderly cultivator beside him turned pale, trembling as he exclaimed in fright, "Chunyu Bei is dead... even though he was injured, that was just one arrow! How can this be reasonable?!

"We are, after all, prefecture temple masters from many regions, yet in front of this man, we’re like dogs and chickens... what’s the point of fighting?!"

The crowd did not even have a chance to mourn before a fearful wailing rose in their ears. The cold-faced man already had five more arrows nocked on his bow. The Embryonic Breathing Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators that were at his feet, the monks and nuns, couldn’t see the situation clearly and rushed forward in confusion, but every Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator collectively took a step back.

"Not good!"

Boom!

Brilliant golden light exploded everywhere. Before the elder could even see who had died or been injured, several black escape lights shot into the sky. Li Xuanfeng exhaled lightly, and five more arrows appeared on his bowstring.

The elder felt a cold chill on his neck, stepped back, and exclaimed in shock, "Why is no one stepping up? Are you forcing us to die for nothing!"

Terror spread across the northern bank. Even the lesser cultivators on the ground raised their heads, and the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators’ escape lights flickered in and out, showing signs of collapse.

Meanwhile, the many cultivators on the southern bank were equally shocked. They all looked up at Li Xuanfeng in the air, expressions of joy appearing on their faces. They flew up to the pass one after another, each raising their dharma artifact.

Li Xuanfeng’s body shone brightly as he lightly juggled the arrows in his hand. At last, the north could no longer hold out. A monk soared forward on the wind, his muscular body tense and eyes wide with anger as he shouted, "Little demon, how dare you be so insolent!"
𝐟𝕣𝗲𝕖𝕨𝗲𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝗲𝚕.𝗰𝚘𝐦

This monk, so different from the usual Buddhist cultivators with their few dharma artifacts, now stood on a golden cloud at his feet. He also held a crescent-moon spade covered in brilliant patterns. It was quite luxurious.

Only then did he ride the wind upward, immediately followed by a tall, thin monk with a constant smile on his face. His left hand rested flat against his chest, thumb and index finger pinching a golden ring. He said nothing as he silently followed.

Li Xuanfeng, empowered by the spirit artifact beneath his feet, shone with bright light that moved with his every motion. It did not just boost his physical strength and mana but also spread his spiritual sense across the entire riverbank. He merely glanced coldly as he drew his bow, golden light streaming past both sides of his face.

Buzz!

Although the two monks called him a demon, they didn’t dare to be careless. Their faces turned serious, and the smile on the thin monk’s face froze, as if facing a great enemy. He raised the golden ring in his hand.

The golden ring rolled and expanded in midair, revealing dense patterns. It spewed a hazy golden light that abruptly captured a speck of golden energy. The thin monk immediately beamed and commanded, "Collect!"

The dense clattering of metal echoed across the riverbank, making everyone’s ears ring. The thin monk looked tense, as if facing a great foe, and the burly monk quickly swung his dharma artifact forward, aiming to strike Li Xuanfeng.

The two monks’ brief obstruction allowed the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators behind them to finally reach the riverbank. The northern and southern cultivators clashed, countless lights rose into the sky, and roaring sounds filled the air.

Li Xuanfeng’s single arrow had been blocked, but his expression remained unchanged. He was renowned far and wide, so it was only natural that the north would send special dharma artifacts and cultivators to counter him. It was no surprise.

"Courting death."

The tall, thin monk wasn’t particularly strong. It was clear from a glance that he was just a pawn sent to probe. Only his dharma artifact was somewhat unusual.

Li Xuanfeng stamped his black boots, drew his bowstring, and sneered, "Go!"

The golden-red arrow in his hand vanished in an instant. A burst of golden-red light erupted in the sky, and the golden ring seemed to be struck hard from the front. The mana dissipated, and it reverted to its original form as it flew backward. The thin monk spat out a mouthful of blood, his eyes reflecting the golden-red brilliance.

Bang!

Li Xuanfeng’s full-strength shot, empowered by the Purple Mansion Realm’s spirit artifact, was even more powerful than the arrow that once pierced through Tang Shedu. The thin monk’s upper body was instantly torn to shreds; his lower body lingered for just a moment before being shredded by Astral Qi as well, leaving only a golden light drifting northward toward reincarnation.

Only then did the burly monk charge forward, his body covered in golden runes. His crescent-moon spade fell like a meteor from the sky, bringing a sweeping golden light crashing down.

Boom!

The golden light scattered, revealing a large hand covered in golden-white armor plating that had caught the dharma artifact. Li Xuanfeng tightened his grip on the artifact. The platinum patterns on his face intertwined with radiant light, transforming his previously fierce features into a solemn majesty.

"Just with you?"

The cold words froze the monk in place, preventing him from retreating. His voice thundered through the sky, "Since Tang Shedu rebelled and turned to The Merciful One, then killing me in the midst of the north-south conflict must be a fine opportunity..."

Circles of light rippled behind him, his golden armor shining brilliantly. The patterns on his face radiated authority. He held the burly monk’s dharma artifact lightly in his hand and cast his bright, golden gaze northward.

"Come out, all of you!"

His voice rolled like thunder, reverberating through the clouds, drawing the attention of everyone present.

Figures appeared one after another around him, some holding spears or staffs, and others cradling bottles or rings. Their faces bore the golden features of compassionate Buddhas, but their bodies were like unbreakable Vajra. They stood scattered in the air, around a dozen in total, all eyes staring coldly at him.

Their voices resonated through the air, some male, some female, as if tens of thousands spoke at once, "Brazen demon!"

***

A young man in black emerged from the black smoke, clutching a talisman tightly. He slipped into the crowd of cultivators on the north bank, heading deeper northward until he reached a small hill on the northern side.

A large, fat monk wearing a kasaya approached him. He beamed as he said, "Daoist Friend Yu!"

"Master Monk Xuwang," Yu Jiang responded casually, his face calm though his mind was elsewhere. He raised an eyebrow and asked, "Why does your Buddhist sect have so many Daoist and demonic cultivators under its command?"

"Ah..." Xuwang chuckled twice and replied, "What are you saying? My orthodox sect is the most magnanimous and treats all equally. How could we possibly coerce Daoists or demons, or deny others their Dao lineages? Daoist Friend, you’ve been in the Southern Sea, and you’ve only heard that the Great Zhao is a Buddhist nation, so you assume too much..."

He spoke more seriously, "Although Great Zhao reveres Buddhism, there are still plenty of Daoists and demonic cultivators. We of the Buddhist sect prevail in the prefecture cities, but we Buddhists never interfere in the surrounding prefectures and the mountain wilderness. Those places are left for those with the affinity to find them..."

As he spoke, he led Yu Jiang to the top of the hill, where several people were already seated in a great hall. One of their number, wearing Daoist robes, looked sullen.

When he heard Master Monk Xuwang from afar, he sneered, "Isn’t that the truth?! If there were no devil cultivators, who would even believe in Buddhism?! The common folk are clever, they only become more devout when the devil cultivators grow rampant! Haven’t you heard that beneath Buddhist Mountain lies hell itself?"

He glanced over and recognized Yu Jiang, his tone easing a bit as he casually said, "Daoist Friend, you come from Danjungwulo in the Southern Sea, the place where the Revered One attained Dao. Now it’s where devil cultivators are most numerous, isn’t it?"

Xuwang didn’t get angry, but laughed instead. "What are you saying? We respect their Dao lineages and do not interfere with the mountain cultivators. If they cultivate themselves into demons, eat human flesh and drink blood, and frighten the common people, then in the end, we kill them. That is our merit, is it not?"

The man in Daoist robes sneered but said no more. Yu Jiang turned to look over at an effeminate man in a python robe sitting silently and sipping his tea.

Yu Jiang sat nearby, knowing well why he had been invited. Still, he spoke coldly, "Master Monk, why did you so urgently ask me to come? What’s the matter?"

Xuwang chuckled and replied in a low voice, "Our Mahas, The Merciful Ones, have lost contact. It’s time for us to ponder his true intentions... Daoist Friend Yu, you’re still in touch with some great cultivators, could you give us some guidance?"

"What is there to guide?" Yu Jiang understood his meaning but deliberately didn’t expose it. Instead, he wanted to glean more information, so he stood up and pointed south, speaking coldly, "Can’t you see what’s happening in the south? You’re asking me to break the Purple Mansion Realm’s spirit artifact? You think too highly of me! That’s a troublesome matter; please find someone else for it!"

"No, no!" The fat, big-eared monk shook his head repeatedly as he laughed. "The situation is changing, how could the plan remain the same?"

"That ruthless man in the south..."

The monk laughed heartily and replied, "Of course that’s a chance for the senior brothers of my sect. There’s no need for the Daoist friends to intervene!"

Yu Jiang’s heart jolted at that, but then he saw the monk point northward, a smile appearing on his face as he spoke softly, "Daoist Friend, you have a grudge with the Azure Pond Sect, do you not? Only you can quickly break the great formation on Mount Bianyan!"




# Chapter 871: Breaking The Formation

"Oh?"

Yu Jiang’s face was completely different from when he had faced the Li Family just now. His skin was light brown, typical of a Southern Sea cultivator. He already knew what Xuwang was plotting, so he sat down, one hand resting limply on the armrest, and said casually, "Grievances are grievances, but there’s no reason to expect something for nothing."

The situation in Anhuai Heaven was uncertain. The various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Mahas might emerge at any time. Master Monk Xuwang was all smiles on the surface, but inwardly he was extremely anxious, If those few come out right now, everything in front of me will fall back into the game of high cultivators. That would be troublesome! I absolutely cannot delay any longer... If this person doesn’t have any excessive demands, then I’ll agree to them...

Xuwang’s current actions could be seen as testing his superiors’ intentions, but they might also be interpreted as acting on his own authority. He had been stuck at Master Monk for over a hundred years, and only needed one opportunity. Once he took Mount Bianyan, not only would his breakthrough be within reach, but he’d also obtain great merit... at that time, it would be all benefits and no losses.

But if he failed to take the mountain, or if someone from Anhuai Heaven came out halfway, then he’d be roasted alive. The competition for the northern seat was already fierce. No matter what attitude the Azure Pond Sect’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivators held, the various Merciful Ones would rather watch him fall than offer a helping hand. They certainly wouldn’t protect an ambitious junior hoping to carve a share for himself.

Only by standing out and catching Maha’s eye can I claim the position of the Merciful One... then who would dare not smile when they see me?

He was much stronger than his fellow disciples, and he had already calculated everything in his mind, A Li Xuanfeng, powered by the Huai River Map, is not someone any one person can defeat. If it weren’t for a group of cultivators surrounding him, who could possibly take his life? Even if Tuoba Chongyuan were reborn, he’d have to die a few more times!

But if it’s a group attack, how much merit will I even get out of it? That’s no fun!

His ambition was boundless. Since heading south was no longer possible, and he didn’t want to fight for Li Xuanfeng’s life, taking Mount Bianyan was important for his own survival.

He said at once, "Time is pressing. Fellow Daoist, if you have any requests, just state them."

Yu Jiang smoothed out his expression and replied, "I have a way to break Mount Bianyan. I only need one blossom of Lesser Yang Fire."

As soon as the name of this item was spoken, the eyebrows of the man in the python robe sitting nearby slowly rose. Xuwang, of course, recognized the item, and quickly whispered to him, "Quite a bit of this Lesser Yang-type item was acquired when Great Zhao broke Liang. The imperial line is weak, and the attendant over there should have seen it. Please lend a hand..."

He spoke softly, with all the polite words he could muster. The python-robed man finally spoke, his voice sharp and thin, "Once the item is given, it’s considered the Daoist Master’s will. Fellow Daoist Xuwang, you’d better understand the Dao you must walk from now on!"

Faced with the pressing situation, Xuwang could only nod and agree, taking out a stone vial and handing it to Yu Jiang. The others also understood that this was something that had to be done decisively or not at all, so they said nothing more and quickly flew off together.

They were only a few hundred kilometers from Mount Bianyan. Once they passed through the billowing demonic smoke, they arrived at the front of the formation, where countless Buddhist and devil cultivators had already surrounded the formation and were attacking it with all their might.

The grand formation glowed pale green, concealing the scenery within, yet it was incredibly solid and reliable. Despite the cultivators besieging it for so long, it still shone brightly, as unwavering as a pristine green lotus amidst the surging demonic abyss.

A circle of cultivators had already formed around the formation’s perimeter, with even more cultivators who had failed to head south gathering here. The three of them all turned to Yu Jiang.

Xuwang’s heart leapt into his throat as he whispered, "From here on, it all depends on your skill, fellow Daoist."

"Give me the jade talisman!" Yu Jiang demanded, and the monk hurriedly handed over a jade talisman. It was indeed the talisman for entering and exiting the formation before them; it had been taken from a certain immortal cultivator. But this formation was so sophisticated that it required every talisman to be officially recorded for entry, so it was of little use.

Yu Jiang took the jade talisman, unhurriedly using his hand as a blade to lightly slice his chest open. He reached inside and groped around twice, then carefully took out several talismanic implements one by one.

These talismanic implements came in various shapes, but they were all smooth and bright. He selected three long plates of beast fangs from them, placing one in front of him first.

"Respectfully welcoming Supreme Shaman Thirty-Nine."

Then he placed one on each side and recited, "Respectfully inviting Jade True Sixty-Nine.

"Praying to Merging Owl Nineteen."

The three fang plates glowed together. He then took a white talisman from his sleeve, pressed it between his palms, and, with the tiger’s mouth facing his lips, exhaled twice, murmuring, "Sacrificial Talisman Whole Pill, combining ancient methods, transformations beyond measure... There is one here, grant me an arrow, lost first then returned, a temporary borrowing, they come to me and I to them, I also borrow..."

His words were vague, interspersed with many incantations that the others could not clearly hear. Strange sounds of bones cracking emanated from his body. His eyebrows grew longer and sharper, and his eyes turned a pale gray. A dignified, commanding aura radiated from between his brows, sweeping over the few people nearby.

"Li Xuanfeng!"

One look nearly scared Xuwang out of his wits; he hurriedly stepped back a pace. The man in the python robe even pulled out a long whip. Xuwang exclaimed in shock, "Fellow Daoist, what a skillful art of transformation! Th-this..."

Yu Jiang’s appearance as Li Xuanfeng was not just a mask, even his aura was exactly the same. When they probed him with spiritual sense, no matter how they looked, he seemed to be Li Xuanfeng himself! If not for the absence of his signature Astral Qi, they might have truly thought Li Xuanfeng was present!

Xuwang clapped his hands together at once, a sudden realization dawning on him. He sighed and said, "I was wondering why fellow Daoist insisted on seeing Li Xuanfeng that time! So it was to use the Southern Sea cultivator’s appearance to get close to him, just to perform this spell at this very moment... Fellow Daoist planned this all along... and fooled us all so thoroughly!

"Fellow Daoist, so perceptive!"

Yu Jiang nodded, outwardly displaying a look of praise, though he thought, If I truly needed his appearance, I wouldn’t need to rely on anything. It’s just to dispel suspicion...

He coldly glanced at all three of them. When they couldn’t help but avert their gazes, he finally picked up the jade talisman, rose on the wind, and said softly, "I will enter the formation. I will open the formation gate before Chi Zhiyan can react. All of you, stay sharp! Do not miss this opportunity!"
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝘦𝓌𝑒𝑏𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝘭.𝒸𝘰𝑚

His transformed face gave his words an added air of authority. The others felt uneasy in their hearts but nodded in response.

Yu Jiang entered the formation. After just three breaths, the green-lotus-like formation began to flash, its light flickering on and off, revealing several openings.

A roar rang out from within, "Who?!"

"Kill!" The voices of demon cultivators instantly shook the heavens, and countless black clouds poured through the portals. Xuwang laughed heartily, shouting, "My opportunity to attain the Dao has come!"

***

The green lotus in Jiangbei gradually dimmed, while the radiant light in Jiangnan grew ever more brilliant. The sky was already shrouded in all sorts of Buddhist light, and the sharp energies of spears, staffs, knives, and swords interwove. Lake water poured from a bottle, surging and roaring in the sky.

All the Master Monks had appeared together, yet Li Xuanfeng remained as cold and hard as iron. He seized the Master Monk’s crescent shovel with one hand. Bright light shone, and wrapped around his body. But his other hand pierced straight through, and exploded the Master Monk’s head with a loud boom.

Splash!

The blood of the burly Master Monk transformed into countless drifting, fragrant lotus flowers. His headless body was now covered in cracks. The Master Monk abandoned even his dharma artifact, hurriedly flying downward, grateful that Li Xuanfeng had used his fist instead of his arrows.

The two small Master Monks used as bait had both lost the bodies they had cultivated for a hundred years and fled in panic. The fourteen Master Monks in the sky, who had specifically targeted him, finally took the opportunity to step forward.

Their faces were filled with rage as they bellowed, "Bold demon, how dare you act so wildly?!"

Boom!

Countless dharma artifacts fell together, producing a deafening roar. Blades, spears, axes, and clubs all struck at once, bursting with a dazzling brilliance that made one’s eyes spin. The sharpness of metal intertwined with the colorful light of the Buddhist cultivators, but everything was blocked by a single golden bow.

"Ha..."

Li Xuanfeng’s figure sank, and his aura finally faltered. Blood appeared faintly at the corner of his mouth. The brilliant light under his feet soared as the Huai River Map’s mysteries operated, allowing him to break free from the encirclement of over a dozen people. He reappeared on another pass, the celestial bow in his hand gleaming sharply.

Clang!

A sword light suddenly leapt upward from below. Si Yuanli lifted his sword essence, but two Master Monks purposely separated from the group, each holding a bottle designed to absorb sharp energy, and tied him down.

These two bottles were unusually shaped; they were not for spraying out but for absorbing. Clearly they were specifically designed to counter sword cultivators like him. It only took them a second to swallow all his sword qi, producing a metallic grinding sound.

Pinewhite Full Essence Sword Art!

Si Yuanli’s azure sword flipped in his hand, weaving bits of ethereal sword brilliance. Although the two before him clearly targeted sword cultivators, he was no ordinary man. He fearlessly conjured countless drifting sword lights.

He encircled the two Golden Body Master Monks before him, his expression steady. His vast and mighty swordsmanship grew ever more fluid as he seized the opportunity to observe the entire riverbank’s situation.

There were many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from the north below. Li Qinghong, wielding thunder and lightning, was the most dazzling. Li Ximing held the Radiant Origin Pass, suppressing several opponents on his own. Li Xizhi’s spell arts were nimble, toying with groups of cultivators in the palm of his hand.

All of them displayed remarkable skill, which made Si Yuanli secretly startled, The Li Family of today already has the strength of the Xiao Family of the olden days. Li Ximing is comparable to Xiao Yuansi, and Li Qinghong is on par with Yuan Chengdun... As for Li Xizhi, he’s also in the sect, and his tactics and scheming surpass even Xiao Yuansi...

Having grown up around the internal struggles of a minor sect, he always viewed things from the perspective of factional disputes. Even now, that was his first reaction. The more he thought, the more astonished he became, and he mused silently, I don’t know if Buzi has fallen, but now that my family has taken this step, we’re bound to offend the Chi Family in the future. Since we’ve already taken this step, we must draw the Li Family in as an ally...

All the other cultivators had to deal with enemies, but only he had the chance to help Li Xuanfeng, so he observed more closely. Yet most of his attention remained focused on Li Xuanfeng.

"Brother Xuanfeng..."

The man in white-gold armor had rings of light spreading out behind him, pushing back the rushing water from the spirit bottles. The longbow in his hand was drawn to a full moon as it flickered with golden light.

On the other end, the Buddhist light seemed to dye the sky in colors. Twelve Master Monks of the Buddhist cultivation each took their seats, their voices buzzing in the air in unison, "Huixu Demon Subduing Grand Formation!"

A faint and ethereal bell rang out as deep golden patterns mingled with colorful brilliance in the air, forming a massive grand formation. Each Master Monk settled into their assigned positions, their dharma artifacts shining even more brightly as a terrifying amount of power coalesced.




# Chapter 873: Kongsijiang Demon Bowl

This man was dressed in typical Fei Family attire, and the spear in his hand was scarred and broken. Decades of managing the household had worn away all the color from his face, yet he still retained a trace of the nobleman's bearing.

This was none other than Fei Tongyu, the current head of the Fei Family on the north bank of Moongaze Lake!

The Fei Family had fallen into silence and decline over the decades. Fei Tongyu's days had been the most difficult, and that illusory sword light would always appear before him whenever he closed his eyes at night.

The sight of that man casually slaughtering his grandfather, Fei Wangbai, like a dog, would always play in his mind. From that day on, the Fei Family could no longer restore the Patterned Brocade that had been passed down for generations. A century of accumulation had evaporated, and starting anew plunged them into endless torment...

He had truly awakened from nightmares too many times to ever mistake it! It was definitely that person in the sky! Fei Tongyu's current position was so humble that he didn't even have the qualifications to know that person's name, yet he was not anxious.

He murmured, "Such a big matter... Qingyi can find out... good... good..."

The man who had always been as hesitant as a white weasel calmly gazed at the vast rainbow light in the sky. Clearly, even a single thread of that force could tear him to shreds, yet he felt no fear.
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝐰𝚎𝕓𝐧𝚘𝘃𝗲𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝕞

He murmured, "As long as there is a place for vengeance to go, I fear not its disappearance. You beheaded my grandfather and left his corpse lying in the snow under the eyes of all. The body could not be joined back together for three months...

"The Fei Family still has three thousand people who hate with their ancestor's weeping blood. Even a three-year-old child in the peaks draws talismans with wooden sticks. Just wait... just wait..."

Those eyes sank into the black smoke and disappeared into the darkness. Meanwhile, the golden light in the sky brightened again. Si Yuanli remained fully focused, and didn’t show the slightest sign of discovering him.

His blue robe fluttered as he danced through the sky, forcing the two Master Monks to retreat again and again with his ethereal and unrestrained swordsmanship. Si Yuanli had been sealed away by Yuan Xiu for many years, and he reveled in the satisfaction of displaying his sword.

The Pinewhite Full Essence Sword Art had a profound heritage that could be traced back to Sima Jun, who once defended the riverside of Wei State. The sword energy in his hand was snow white, resonating with the Huai River Map beneath his feet and growing ever sharper. The Master Monks' roar only gave him momentary pause, and the jade ring on his wrist flashed bright and dim. He immediately disengaged and glanced up at Li Xuanfeng.

Li Xuanfeng had already exchanged several rounds with the Master Monks, filling the sky with thunderous booms. Their battle was now at a critical juncture.

High in the sky, the six Master Monks glared with round, furious eyes as their Buddhist chants grew louder. Some had three heads; some had six arms; some had burning eyes on their chests; and others had four ears that trembled on both sides, each revealing their true form.

Once they reached the level of Master Monk, apart from two special Dao lineages, most highly cultivated Master Monks were both male and female in form. Their faces shifted between male and female, intertwining in a rather eerie way.

Their arms were strong and graceful, glinting with gold powder. They tightly gripped their dharma artifacts, all bearing down on the golden bow that was interwoven with brilliance. The fierce golden bow had hooked onto the blades of all the weapons, holding them steadily back in midair.

Li Xuanfeng was being restrained by six Buddhist cultivators. His Astral Qi rolled like clouds, materializing from intangible to tangible as countless sharp lights that gradually interwove in the air. They spiraled upward along the edges of his Heavenly Gilded Helm, and coiled around his body.

The hand that braced the golden bow was as steady as a mountain, yet streams of golden light flowed out from between his fingers. A white scroll unfurled beside him, drifting like a long snake, and Li Xuanfeng suddenly vanished.

The six Buddhist cultivators’ dharma artifacts simultaneously dropped down before they caught themselves. Six pairs of eyes, seemingly cast from the same mold, all turned in unison and caught sight of the man in platinum armor manifesting in the south. His longbow was drawn like a full moon and aimed straight at them.

Clang...

The three golden rings in the air suddenly leaped in place, bursting with a dazzling light as if they had seized a fiercely struggling foe. They emitted a frenzied metallic clashing sound, but Li Xuanfeng’s bowstring did not pause.

Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang...

The three Buddhist cultivators holding the golden rings paled as they simultaneously spat out blood. The remaining nine hurriedly formed seals and cast their spells, chanting deep, complex incantations that bewitched the mind, murmuring in the air, "We respectfully summon the 'Kongsijiang Demon Bowl'!"

The grand formation trembled as the great void cracked open with a roar. A point of golden light darted through, falling right in the middle of the twelve. It rippled outward like a small stone dropping into water, swiftly gathering and solidifying into a large purple bowl.

The purple bowl was encircled by two black bands. It bore no inscriptions, yet it was mysterious and solid. Its black mouth swallowed and held countless incoming golden lights.

A treasure of the Purple Mansion Realm!

Si Yuanli’s expression instantly sank, and he grew wary. He secretly sensed some terrifying news.

This Kongsijiang Demon Bowl was unmistakably something a Maha had bestowed. It had undoubtedly been summoned at the directive of one of the Seven Dharma Forms. Its descent here signified that at least one Maha was currently paying close attention to them!

"Hahahahaha!"

Si Yuanli grew extremely vigilant. These twelve had summoned a dharma artifact specifically meant for Li Xuanfeng. The frustration they had felt in failing to defeat a single man earlier dissolved a little, and they all began to laugh loudly, their voices overlapping and resounding through the sky, "A mere tribe from the southern barbarian Mount Yue dares to test the holy laws of our orthodox sect? The Revered One is merciful, but we will make sure you fall here today."

This voice roared like thunder, causing many cultivators to turn their heads.

No matter how powerful Li Xuanfeng was, he was only one man. He was facing twelve orthodox Master Monks of the Way of Emptiness! Each one was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. They were not just capable of borrowing power from higher forces but also possessed extremely sophisticated formations. How could one person possibly stop them?

At that moment, Li Qinghong's expression creased with worry as she considered how to abandon her current foe and rush forward to help. She almost convinced herself that by fully activating her Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow, she could still pose a threat to the cultivators even if she took a few more injuries

But Li Xuanfeng's expression did not change. He said softly, "Just watch!"

As soon as Li Xuanfeng finished speaking, the golden string in his hand flickered. The scroll at his side leaped into the air and unfurled in midair, twisting and turning like a swimming dragon. A brilliant silver light shone from it.

Countless golden rays surged from his hands. It was like a dam bursting as a flood gushed forth. In an instant, countless beams of profound light flew into that clear silver light.

When the golden rays touched the silver light, they immediately split into gold and silver, then split again, and again until they leaped into the clouds high above.

Clang!

The sky was filled with profound light rushing toward the heavens. However, before it could fall back down, the silver light swept down first. The purple bowl held up somewhat better, but the three golden rings were jolted askew as if struck by a speeding comet, wobbling crazily.

Clang, clang, clang, clang...

The three Buddhist cultivators controlling the golden rings turned pale, but with the help of the formation balancing their mana, their complexions quickly warmed again. Yet all twelve Buddhist cultivators hesitated for a brief moment.

This grand formation had a long heritage and was incredibly wondrous. The twelve of them could not only balance their mana and distribute damage evenly but also connect their minds. They instantly started communicating through the array, "This demon is formidable. The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl can only hold so much; how can we waste it so easily? Better to put it away first and use the formation to respond!"

None of these Buddhist cultivators were simple; they refused to give Li Xuanfeng a chance to test the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl.

The purple bowl vanished, and the twelve returned to their formation, intoning in a booming voice, "Mi!"

A massive golden formation spanned the banks, with countless golden incantations flowing through it. It manifested in the shape of a slightly tilted circular array that was as large as a mountain. It scattered clouds and demons alike with an overwhelming presence.

"What an incredible formation."

By this point, the cultivators on both sides of the battlefield were gradually losing their fighting spirit. But they were all bound by orders from above, so none dared to stop. When they sensed the commotion, they all looked up but had no time to examine the formation closely; they vaguely saw a flickering behind it.

Si Yuanli finally lost his composure, and the light of his sword wavered slightly. Luckily, his opponent had long been beaten to the point of being unable to retaliate, so this slip caused no consequence.

Yet his heart was filled with terror, and he muttered in a low voice, "Thirty-two thousand seven hundred sixty-eight..."

As his words faded, a sky full of stars appeared above him, intertwined in gold and silver. They flickered uncertainly as they slowly grew larger in the pupils of the onlooking cultivators, transforming into a sea of profound light that fell from the sky. But the heavenly downpour was preceded by an aggressively sharp aura.

"Wh-what is this?!"

"Is this Foundation Establishment Realm?!"

The cultivators below had all lost color in their faces. Li Qinghong's eyes turned slightly red as she thought silently, Second Uncle must have used a secret technique that burns his own lifespan for Yuan Xiu...

The sky full of profound light fell like a torrential rain, and the many lesser cultivators on the ground immediately ran for cover. Fortunately, the light gathered on its own halfway down and slammed down on the central formation like a falling river of stars.

The twelve Buddhist cultivators were all pinned inside the formation. Their eyes were filled with gold and silver light. The formation wavered like a lotus leaf in the rain, tilting this way and that, but in the end, there were twelve of them. Every so often, one of them would cough up blood, yet the formation remained unbroken.

The twelve Master Monks were temporarily suppressed, and the profound light filling the sky had not hit the ground. Yet the lesser cultivators on both sides retreated to either bank. The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators also had no intention of stopping them...

The torrential rain of profound light and golden mist forced the offensives on both the north and south sides to temporarily cease. The cultivators on both sides lost their will to fight. Those at the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms withdrew one after another, leaving only the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators still locked in a stalemate.

By now, almost everyone on the field understood clearly that the outcome came down to Li Xuanfeng and these twelve Buddhist cultivators...

Either Li Xuanfeng would kill all twelve, forcing the north to retreat, or the twelve Master Monks would slay Li Xuanfeng. Once Li Xuanfeng died, the Huai River Map would naturally collapse, and the northern cultivators would have a chance to advance south!

As tens of thousands looked on, the golden string in Li Xuanfeng's hand was drawn back to its full length. His eyes shone with astonishing brightness. Even with the boost from the ancient spirit artifact, it was still not enough. Two streams of his Immortal Foundation within him began to evaporate recklessly, giving off a thin golden mist.

Over the years, Li Xuanfeng had naturally learned methods to burn his essence qi and lifespan. He had studied the Foundation Sacrifice Stabilizing Technique, a secret of the Ning Family. He had already used it once back when he killed Tang Shedu.
𝒇𝒓𝙚𝒆𝔀𝓮𝓫𝒏𝓸𝙫𝓮𝓵.𝓬𝙤𝙢

This secret technique came with extremely severe aftereffects, often overdrawing thirty to forty percent of one's Immortal Foundation, leading to a collapse of one’s cultivation. Although he had used this technique once to kill Tang Shedu, he had remained stable in the Great Ning Palace thanks to Yuan Xiu’s intervention and his current state.

His cultivation was largely stored in talisman seeds, and nearly half separated from his body. Thus, he was effectively always borrowing power from the talisman seeds. This unexpectedly had its advantages where his Immortal Foundation was supported by the talisman seeds, and unless he exhausted it all at once with the secret technique, his cultivation would not collapse no matter how he drew on it.

Thus, now he wielded the technique again without hesitation, seizing the moment while the twelve were tied down. The golden-red arrow in his hand grew ever more solid, with surging mana and Astral Qi condensing in his grip.

Buzz...

The sky full of profound light lasted dozens of breaths. When that gold-and-silver brilliance finally faded, the golden-red light in Li Xuanfeng's hand also disappeared at the same time. The twelve trembled as one but had no time to summon the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl.

Only the three golden rings floated up alone and suddenly grabbed something. The three circular rings paused for a moment, and buckled. An instant later, the dharma artifact let out a sharp tearing sound in the air.

Ka ka....clang...

The three dharma artifacts exploded, scattering golden fragments that fell with a rustling sound. The three Buddhist cultivators had severed their connection with the dharma artifacts in time, yet they still coughed up blood, their faces pale as gold paper.

Fortunately, it had bought them enough time. The purple-gold bowl reappeared in the air, swallowing the freed golden-red arrow. It shook twice, then flickered bright and dim.

The twelve Buddhist cultivators seized the moment, and decisively leaped from their positions. They put away the bowl, and the remaining nine Buddhist cultivators shifted positions, reforming the grand formation.

They shouted in unison, "We beseech Suxikong! True path to subdue the demon!"

The sky vibrated with a roar. The remaining nine Buddhist cultivators' bodies shone brightly. A pair of cold, emotionless eyes opened on their chests in unison. Golden lines erupted all over their faces. They no longer looked human.

The strange eyes all turned toward Li Xuanfeng. There was no colorful light or golden brilliance, no sign of anything tearing through the air. But the radiance beneath his feet trembled, causing the cultivators' footing to sway.

The bright light on Li Xuanfeng's body dimmed for an instant, and he was frozen in place. The nine Buddhist cultivators all leaped forward together. The formation beneath their feet dissolved instantly, and they attacked together, empowered by Suxikong's true form.

Boom!

In that instant, gold clashed with stone, like the meeting of a landslide and a tsunami. All the brilliance in the sky dimmed, and both the northern and southern banks froze simultaneously.

Ten Buddhist cultivators struck together, empowered by Suxikong's true form that had been summoned by the grand formation. Their combined strength had reached a terrifying level.

Si Yuanli stood to the side, a sense of impending doom rising in his heart. He exclaimed in horror, "I underestimated them!"

The radiant pass beneath his feet wavered. Si Yuanli broke into a cold sweat. Panicked, he searched the intertwining golden and multicolored lights of the various weapons and saw a hint of red.

Ting ting...

The scattered droplets of blood were like shattered strings of jade pearls, each round and crystal clear, scattering in all directions. When they struck the dharma artifacts stacked by the Master Monks, they actually rang with a sound like jade beads.

Clatter clatter...

Blood dripped and turned into a golden rain in the dim sky. Under the gaze of countless anxious or relieved eyes, both the golden bow and Li Xuanfeng’s figure vanished.

"Where is that fierce man?"

"Could he have turned to ashes and smoke...?"

Si Yuanli stared as the blood rain fell. Suddenly, he heard a crisp clash of metal on metal, and an icy, hoarse voice echoed in the sky, carrying all the way to the ears of the northern and southern cultivators.

"When the Heavenly Stem meets Ren and Gui[1], gold is used to its utmost..."

The crisp clash of metal grew even louder, almost louder than thunder itself. The cold, hoarse voice grew even deeper, "Invoke the proper position of the Metal of Shen and You[2], grant me dominion over metal!"

1. Ren and Gui refers to the Heavenly Stems where Ren is the ninth stem and Gui is the tenth. ☜

2. Shen and You refer to the Ninth and Tenth Earthly Branches ☜




# Chapter 875: Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman

"What is this..."

The twelve Buddhist cultivators, each with a different expression, cautiously landed, reforming the massive golden formation that spanned the great river. The faces of males and female alike glittered with golden powder, but they were all filled with suspicion and uncertainty.

All the cultivators craned their necks as they searched the sky. They came from diverse backgrounds; some were peak masters of Azure Pond Peak, some from southern clans, some had gained fame at a young age, and some were seasoned veterans. But everyone was watching intently.

"Could he be dead... could he really be dead...?"

Below, a middle-aged man in splendid robes wore a solemn expression. He was none other than Yuan Hudu, head of the Yuan Family, who had once been struck by an arrow. His face remained calm, but inside he was more anxious than anyone.

"His strength surpassed the norm long ago; how could this be possible?! How could this be possible?!"

He searched carefully, his hand half-heartedly continuing his spellcasting, as he listened to the whispers around him. In the sky, two points of platinum light drifted downward.

"Li Xuanfeng..."

In the sky, Si Yuanli, dressed in fluttering azure robes, wore a complex expression as he looked at the white-armored man appearing not far away.

The proper position of Metal in Shen and You had transformed into the white of the West. Li Xuanfeng’s Heavenly Gilded Helm had responded first to the talisman and turned pure white. Stark white lines crawled up his cheek to the corner of his eye and then into his gaze.

Grant me dominion over metal.

Li Xuanfeng had always thought this talisman was a kind of supportive technique or protective spell. Only now did he realize that the reason Si Yuanli had recognized the Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman at a glance was not because it was something Si Boxiu had simply crafted. It was actually a treasure, perhaps a talisman tool or even a Dao treasure.

"Of course... how could a single talisman suffice for something as important as Anhuai Heaven? Anyone who enters must surely have at least one Purple Mansion Realm item!"

Both of Li Xuanfeng's Immortal Foundations resonated with the Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman. As his spiritual sense flooded into it, the last doubt in his heart finally dissolved completely.

Why me? Why the Heavenly Gilded Helm? he thought.

Could the goodwill of a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master be without cause? The Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman had always been Si Boxiu’s trump card, and the Heavenly Gilded Helm its most compatible vessel...

Si Boxiu had specially refined a pill and likely added many techniques to make this Immortal Foundation resonate with this set of treasures. Now, the Heavenly Gilded Helm poured into the Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman, drawing out all the stored divine abilities and mana within.

At this moment, he looked like the incarnation of slaughtering metal, clad in white armor, fearsome and fierce. White energy dripped from his elbows, dyeing his golden bow a cold, ghostly white. Autumn dew fell from the sky like raindrops, pitter-pattering around him.

"Is he really Li Xuanfeng...?"

The doubt even surfaced in the minds of the onlookers. A ring of bright light shimmered behind the man as he stood on the pass gate. Autumn dew flew sideways as he stood unmoving, but that cold, white metal aura silenced them all.

Li Xuanfeng's pupils were fixed on the twelve Master Monks.

Fear finally filled the twelve. They could no longer utter their earlier words about subduing demons and evil spirits. They all avoided his gaze but quickly recovered, and their expressions turned angry as if their pride had been trampled.

They roared, "What a monster! You dare resist!"

Their hands did not stop casting spells. The dharma bottle in the sky glowed with bright lake water, spraying gleaming droplets once again.

The water droplets circled the light around him, mixing with the autumn dew and losing their way. The scorching and sharp mirror light of a golden mirror shot toward him, but it dissolved in front of him and disappeared.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

Li Xuanfeng merely opened his fierce eyes slightly, staring at them with a terrifying presence.

"Hahahaha!"

As silence fell over the north and south, laughter suddenly rang from the north. A few more Master Monks tore through the air, their attire completely different from those before.

The leader appeared to have come from afar, his body covered with scattered wooden talismans and his clothes full of patches.

He took one look at the grand formation, then burst out laughing and jeered, "Xu An... you and your brothers are all a bunch of useless trash! Such a golden opportunity! More than a quarter of an hour, and you still couldn't take him down!

"Now that we’re here... if the Way of Emptiness can't swallow this meat, we’ll take a share of it too!"

He laughed for two seconds before realizing how eerily quiet it was over the river. He awkwardly stopped, scanned the scene, and saw that three of the twelve had withered auras and the other nine bore slight injuries.

Then he looked toward the man in white armor across from him. The monk's expression quickly turned solemn. After glancing at the bright gate under his feet, he quietly retreated a step.

The sky was filled with distorted, translucent, slightly white metal qi. Li Xuanfeng remained motionless, silently resonating with the Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman within him as his aura steadily rose to its peak.

The cold, white metal qi seemed ready to slice open Si Yuanli’s cheek. Of course, he knew exactly what was happening and was extremely familiar with the Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman.

This was a treasure of the Si Family. Though it was called a talisman, it was more like a spirit artifact. After each use, it required a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master’s personal spellcasting to restore it before it could be used again. It was the ultimate object. But it was not something just anyone could wield. Each person’s power differed... without a special technique, only a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could truly unleash its might.

He had never doubted Si Boxiu’s actions, yet he felt both awe and fear again at the far-reaching vision of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. He thought to himself, The Heavenly Gilded Helm... Brother Xuanfeng actually brought the Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman to such a level! Never mind this place, who in Anhuai Heaven could be his match even for one round?

Everyone watched him in stunned amazement. The twelve tried probing attacks to no avail, and as time slowly passed, they finally exchanged glances. The massive formation in the sky reassembled.

Brilliant golden light flowed, and a whispering chant fell from the twelve’s mouths in unison, echoing in the sky. It grew from a murmur like an ant swarm to a roar like thunder until it gradually reached its peak.

Li Xuanfeng moved.

He still held the white bow, forged from the Metal of Shen and You, and perfectly attuned to his mana. The savage expression on his face had faded, leaving only a slender sharpness. As he drew it fully, it truly resembled an autumn moon.

Yet there was no arrow on the bow.

Everyone was puzzled, but before the twelve could react, something seemed to dart across the sky. The sky slowly turned white, and autumn dew fell like rain. A chill descended from above.

"What..."

Si Yuanli had already disengaged from his duel with two other cultivators. He gently reached out, and caught a small object amidst the falling autumn dew.

He slowly opened his hand and saw a pink flower petal nestled in his palm.

The sun shone brightly, the clouds in the sky dispersed, and countless pale pink flower petals fell from above. A sound of mixed joy and sorrow filled the air, carrying a faint, eerie fragrance.

The petals were tender pink, exuding a delicate fragrance, resembling both a lotus and a peony. They floated on the north wind, drifting across the stunned eyes of the Buddhist cultivators, and gracefully falling into the surging river below.

Si Yuanli’s gaze followed the pink petals swirling on the river’s surface. Slowly, he raised his head, and his eyes found the Master Monks on the opposite side.

Of the twelve Master Monks, only eleven remained.




# Chapter 876: Clash Between Evils

"One arrow."

Li Xuanfeng stood in the air, clad in gleaming white armor. The markings on his face shone as his long brows relaxed. His white radiance flowed across his chiseled face, and his eyes were fixed on the distance.

Petals fluttered down from the sky behind him; it was an omen marking the fall of a Buddhist cultivator. One arrow from Li Xuanfeng had caused the heavens to pale, and obliterated the monk without even a chance at reincarnation.

Everyone stared in stunned silence. There was not a whisper on either the Jiangnan and Jiangbei sides. Only the faint crashing of water against the rocks echoed as countless eyes watched the petals fall.

"Killed by a single arrow."

Many Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms cultivators were at a loss as they only saw a monk fall on the Buddhist side. Cheers erupted in the south, while some in the north remained silent. Others gnashed their teeth, cursing the demon under their breath.

But the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators all fell silent. These were all prominent figures from Jiangnan and Jiangbei. This great battle between the two sides had broadened their horizons; cases of one-shot kills among Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators weren’t unheard of.

Notable figures in the southern-northern struggle such as Tuoba Chongyuan, Tang Shedu, Lingu Rao, and even some from the Murong Family could easily dispatch early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in one exchange. Li Xuanfeng himself had risen to fame after slaying Murong Wu in a mere fifteen minutes.

Yet, though those twelve monks varied in strength, they were all proper cultivators of the Void Path. To kill one with a single arrow...

The most troublesome part of the monk’s path was their reincarnation method. Unless they were destroyed in an instant, body and soul, they could always revive through a devout follower. That arrow had utterly erased both body and soul; it was an unbelievable feat. A shared thought rose in everyone’s heart, Could it be that a special Purple Mansion Realm talisman was activated with that incantation and bound to the arrow?

Is this really Li Xuanfeng? Or did he unleash some kind of demonic force?

The monk holding the pagoda had not merely been slain, the arrow had shattered his body and soul. The Huixu Demon Subduing Grand Formation collapsed with a boom, and the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl could no longer be maintained. The remaining eleven monks turned pale, staring in shock and pain at the flower rain filling the sky.

"Xu Mo has returned to the Buddhist soil..."

Shock and suspicion surged among the remaining eleven monks. All of Jiangnan and Jiangbei seemed paralyzed for a moment. No one moved, and only the white-armored man’s bowstring stirred.

Buzz!

The white bow instantly bent into a full moon shape. All eleven felt like blades were pressed against their backs, and sweat poured down in unison. Their hands twitched, but none managed to form a spell before a fragrant breeze swept over them.

The sky brightened once more.

Too fast!

The dharma artifact of the ring-holding monk shattered. His face was pale, then abruptly went slack. Flower petals filled the sky again, mixed with dewdrops like jade pearls and an auspicious glow that filled the sky. All hearts turned cold.

Another arrow!

No, only ten of the eleven monks remained in the air. Their minds went blank, leaving just one word, Flee!

The northern cultivators were the only ones who were even faster. The very moment the bowstring rang out, the demonic clouds over the north had already begun to scatter like melting snow under the sun. Countless streaks of escape light erupted, filling the sky with chaotic colors as everyone fled northward.

Whoosh...

The entire northern bank of cultivators routed. All sorts of dharma artifacts shot skyward as they scrambled to flee north. The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators vanished in a single breath, while the Embryonic Breathing Realm, Qi Cultivation Realm disciples, and monks below were thrown into chaos. They rose and fell, colliding in disarray.

The northern factions had always been a disorganized mess. Thus, the beginning of the rout was like a dam breaking as everyone started to flee in all directions. Some greedy individuals even took the opportunity to attack one another amid the chaos, sending blood light flashing across the sky.

Shouts rang out.

"Run quickly!!"

"Head to Mount Bianyan... the great formation there has broken..."

The northern bank, long shrouded in demonic smoke, was finally cleared. Only bloodstains remained on the ground, as even the corpses had been scavenged for use. There was nothing to see aside from the red-black stain across the land.

But even as the northern cultivators withdrew, the ten monks in the sky did not move an inch. All wore frozen expressions; it was not just the ten, the monks who arrived afterward were also stuck in place, unable to move.

Si Yuanli’s joy froze on his face as he looked toward the horizon. A layer of color slowly emerged, dazzling and radiant, suspended on the farthest edge of the sky like a giant eye that gazed coldly at them.

"The Maha is watching with his own eyes!" Si Yuanli had a scholarly background, and thus recognized it at a glance. He quickly ducked his head, panic rising within, and instantly understood why none of the monks fled.

He muttered to himself, "It’s not that they can’t flee... they dare not."

In the Seven Dharma Forms of Buddhist Dao, one stage higher could crush someone outright. The fate and very lives of these monks were in the Maha’s hands now. How could they possibly escape?

A suffocating pressure lingered for a moment. Those on the southern bank also began to sense something amiss when they saw the colorful light in the sky mirrored on the ground. Something in the great void had responded to a call and was emitting a faint glimmer.

The light pierced through the air, turning into a deep purple-black hue. It rapidly expanded in the sky, revealing a purple alms bowl ringed by two black bands. No incantations adorned it, but its gaping mouth was dark and terrifying.

"The true form of the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl!"

The Buddhist artifact gradually took form. The eldest monk among them pressed his palms together and murmured softly, "This demon of great evil has come this far, yet is returned to our junior brother... everyone, the mundane world is void. It is time for us to suppress the demon with our bodies and return to the Buddhist soil!"

His expression remained calm, and his tone steady. He was clearly a cultivator of great attainment. Yet among the remaining nine, six looked down, faint traces of fear and anxiety in their eyes.

Still, despite fearing that they would see themselves blasted into dust in the next moment, not one of them hesitated. They formed hand seals together, abandoning any thought of escape.

The Maha made no move, and merely watched. Yet the monks had already lost their right to flee. Even those nearby who weren’t of the same Dao lineage stood paralyzed, their freedom gone.

These ten did not evade. Suxikong’s true form activated, as his dharma body radiated colored light. Their dharma artifacts surged forth together, soaring toward the white-armored man in the sky.

"Senior brother! Since there’s no chance of escape... at the very least, let this opportunity fall into our own hands!"

Several whispers echoed in the ear of the leading monk. His smooth face darkened slightly; he had clearly understood his junior brother’s intention.

Li Xuanfeng’s karmic burden had only grown ever more dreadful as he repelled the northern forces. His karmic entanglement would only deepen with every one of the twelve he slew. Even if only one or two survived out of ten, as long as Li Xuanfeng was killed, infinite karmic rewards would follow. With fewer people to share them... they might immediately attain the title of The Merciful One, and have a boundless future!

The ten understood there was no retreat. Filled with a desperate resolve, they charged together, gritting their teeth as they rapidly closed the distance.

Every cultivator knew Li Xuanfeng was no slouch in close combat, but no matter how strong he was up close, how could it compare to the bow in his hand?

If they kept engaging from afar with spell arts, their only fate was to be picked off one by one. Biting down under the mounting pressure, they advanced and shouted coldly in unison, "Fiend, meet your end!"

Buzz...

Li Xuanfeng’s gaze swept across the heavens. Though he hadn’t read as many ancient texts as Si Yuanli, he had personally seen a Maha. He drew his white bow back into a full moon once more.

Thump!

The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl had yet to fully manifest when petals began raining down again. The remaining nine Buddhist cultivators didn’t even look back; they had already rushed in, their male and female features suddenly clear. Golden powder fell from their faces; their teeth glinted gold, and they furrowed their brows in rage.

The monk charging at him was fierce, with bulging eyes and pronounced brow bones. Muscles swelled across the face, radiating killing intent. It was a true visage of a wrathful vajra.

Li Xuanfeng's gaze was icy sharp and as piercing as steel. He sensed the arrogance and fear hidden beneath and spoke in a hoarse voice, "Fierce in appearance, weak within!"

He simply opened his hand, and pale-white energy gathered in his palm. He threw a fist forward and three shades of chilling white energy morphed into tigers and leopards that slammed straight into the target.

Boom!

The monk's head exploded with a loud bang. Countless sparkles flew up to try and reform but were instantly dissolved by the golden aura in midair. The headless body stumbled back in defeat.

The man’s eyes were cold as metal, and his other hand swung fiercely.

Clang!

He grabbed the neck of the monk beside him. The monk, covered in gold powder, frantically reached up with six hands to pull at his arm, like a panicked octopus.

Li Xuanfeng’s voice was chilling as he said, "Always putting on a fierce face to scare the common folk..."

His broad hand clenched. The monk’s neck shattered with a crack, and three shades of pale golden energy shot into the sky, kicking the head far into the distance like a ball.

"Monster!"

But the monks’ spell arts had arrived. Countless golden chains swirled down from the sky, interlinking and locking around him, striking bright sparks against his pale-white armor.

Clang...

The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl manifested above him like a colossal mountain. Buddhist cultivators appeared in the distance as they rushed over from afar. The spirit wind that had allowed cultivators to remain airborne dissipated, and they all began descending to the ground.

Only Li Xuanfeng remained in the sky, supported by the Huai River Map.

The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl now looked completely different from before, having grown to the size of a mountain. It was no longer meant to block his arrows, it was meant to stop him from escaping.

Clang!

Golden currents flowed in layers beneath the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl. Spears, halberds, axes, and cudgels fell from the sky and struck Li Xuanfeng's chest with a ringing clang. He stood unmoved as he slowly raised his head.

His gaze sparked a surge of Astral Qi. Each of the four attackers had intricate, eye-blinking patterns on their chests, silk sashes at their waists, and were dressed in resplendent robes gleaming with golden lacquer. Li Xuanfeng caught their weapons with one hand, while the other swept across them with his white bow, unleashing a dazzling wave of sword-like radiance.

Clang!

The metallic ring of the radiance clashing against the dharma artifacts echoed across the battlefield. Several Buddhist cultivators’ expressions changed simultaneously, only to see the man enveloped in pale-white aura reaching out to grab one monk’s arm.

"Build great beams and pillars, burn wood for fuel, seize golden gauze to adorn your body..."

He yanked the monk’s muscular arm off and crushed it to dust as he stepped forward. He drew his bow back in one smooth motion, three streams of white light forming with a thrum.

Three monks casting spells from afar instantly coughed up golden blood as their heads, chests, and abdomens exploded simultaneously. Li Xuanfeng broke free from the golden restraints on his body and blocked the incoming palms of two charging monks with both hands.

"How dare you?!"

Several more monks flew in from both sides, their faces rigid and bitter. Their mouths moved involuntarily, voices righteous and solemn as they shouted, "Fiend! You’ve slain countless lives, lackey of the Demonic Dao! Even if we perish into the Dharma Realm, we will still suppress you, monster!"

Li Xuanfeng firmly suppressed the two monks’ dharma bodies. As their bodies began to crack from the pressure, the image of the battlefield before him was replaced by the ruined remains of Zhenhui Temple on Mount Bianyan.

His voice was icy as he said, "A world cleansed that remains impure, emptiness that is not empty, compassion that is not kind... Temples stretch for kilometers, yet still you cry of demons. Golden bodies thirty meters tall, boasting doctrines steeped in worldly pride..."

His words rang like thunder, drawing the attention of both the north and south. Many Master Monks and Buddhist cultivators looked away. The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl in the heavens trembled as if enraged and released a deafening clamor.

Clang!

The sound echoed beneath their feet, sweeping across the north and south and delving deep into the demonic mist. Si Yuanli was also shaken by the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl and had no choice but to descend to the riverbank. Things had once again gone beyond his expectations. He looked up, and his expression darkened.

"Maha cannot act directly. This dharma artifact can only be summoned by the Master Monks, and thus, it can exert pressure. Nothing more..."

Clang!

The distant monks all looked up, their faces pale as if they’d seen a ghost. They exchanged glances, then simultaneously turned and fled in the opposite direction.

"Something terrible has happened! If we keep flying that way, we’ll surely become one of Maha’s blades!"

***

"Hahahahaha!"

White light blazed beneath the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl light. The white armor on Li Xuanfeng’s body had cracked, and the markings on his face had fractured, but this only made him appear more real. He was no longer like some celestial general, but like Li Xuanfeng himself.

The white bow in his hand had been suppressed by the bowl in the sky, as it struggled dimly. Before him stood the remaining Buddhist cultivators, some missing arms, others without heads, all in tatters. Only eight were left, their radiance flickering, standing silently like shattered statues after a temple collapse. But they now had a more fearsome air.

They exchanged glances, and their voices grew hushed, "He’s not invincible all the time!"

Despite those words, the Buddhist cultivators remained frozen in place, staring at the man who stood with one foot on a broken dharma body. Of the original nine Master Monks of the Way of Emptiness and the six who joined later, only eight of them remained alive.

The strength of the twelve monks of the Way of Emptiness had varied. The disparity had not been all that apparent when forming the grand formation, but the fierce battle that followed had been a thresher. Only the five strongest survived.

"What a fiend... what a demonic presence..."

A broken golden spear remained lodged in the fiend’s chest, flickering between the cracks in his white armor. Its shaft trembled faintly with each breath he took. His sharp eyes and brows landed on them, and he exhaled softly.

The broken dharma body beneath Li Xuanfeng’s foot continued to float there, its head dangling loosely. Li Xuanfeng raised a long brow as he took in the eight monks whose gazes had grown feverish and greedy.

"Kill him!"

"Kill him!"

"Kill him and the position of The Merciful One will be ours!"

Li Xuanfeng calmly held their gaze as he crushed the half-broken dharma body beneath his foot. His hands shot out and grabbed two heads, replete with compassionate expressions. He raised them high, and upon seeing the fear lingering in their eyes, laughed from deep in his throat, "I am no saint either, but this is perfect. Two evils killing each other... and everything ends cleanly!"




# Chapter 878: All Tinted Rose

The massive black-purple bowl continued to loom in the sky, its hollow, circular center glowing with a radiance like intertwined branches and leaves that blanketed the heavens. Pale golden, curling clouds spread outward and settled motionless above.

Now that the true form of the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl had been revealed, not a single person across Jiangnan or Jiangbei could rise on wind. All were forced to the riverbanks. Even Li Qinghong, riding Celestial Thunder and bolstered by a feathered robe, could only hover forty meters above the ground.

She looked upward as the rumbling from the sky slowly descended. All the cultivators around her were wounded, but she clutched her spear tightly and turned toward Si Yuanli.

She asked quietly, "Senior, do you have a treasure that can ascend?"

Si Yuanli was intently examining the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl, bitterness filling his heart. Just as Si Boxiu had granted the Huai River Map, the monks above summoning Maha’s bowl technically didn’t count as direct intervention... But the Maha’s control over Master Monks was unlike that of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. When the stubborn Master Monks claimed they were slaying a demon, who could really argue?

"The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl is nurtured by a Maha... now that it's revealed... who could possibly ascend..." Si Yuanli murmured, "He’s dead set on using these Master Monks to exchange for a competent Merciful One... If they can’t share in the treasures of Anhuai Heaven later, this alone is still a worthwhile reward..."

Although Li Qinghong didn’t fully understand the intricacies of Buddhist cultivation, she had heard that many Mahas were deeply moved and personally intervened when Tang Shedu rebelled. At this moment, Li Xuanfeng's appeal was likely even greater...

Just as Si Yuanli finished speaking, the sky-darkening Kongsijiang Demon Bowl began to shift again. The two black rings on the bowl began to gradually glow golden, and a distant, ethereal decree echoed.

"Compassionate karmic fire. Burn the wicked, and punish the evil!"

The voice drifted down and lasted only a moment before everyone instinctively covered their ears. The black-purple hue in the sky turned deep crimson, and the multicolored clouds transformed into a fiery blaze.

The entire sky now seemed to burn with erratically flickering flames. A thunderous roar followed, "The karmic fire is here, the fiend is doomed!"

As the voice rang out, Si Yuanli’s heart jolted, and he silently began to pray, Please, let nothing go wrong...

***

Inside the Demon Bowl.

Boom!

Li Xuanfeng stood within the blazing deep crimson flames ignited inside the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl. The flames clung to him like a shadow, climbing along his armor, their tongues licking and crackling with metallic clangs.

The eight monks saw the flames, exchanged glances, and burst into laughter, shouting in relief, "The karmic fire has come! The fiend is doomed!"

Li Xuanfeng’s spiritual sense roiled within the fire but was soon forced back into his body. He could feel a searing heat around him, causing the mana in his body to hiss and crackle.

He glanced down and sneered, "Karmic fire? It’s nothing but a fusion of the True Flame, Merging Fire and Molten Fire!"

But the combination of all three fires had weakened the golden qi protecting him. The once indestructible white armor began to groan and crack under the strain, creaking loudly from the burning.

The eight monks thrived in the fire, surging forward like fish in water. Even as he spoke, Li Xuanfeng had already drawn the golden spear from his chest. The white bowstring twanged, releasing five white arrows.

Now, not only was the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl suppressing him, but the blazing triple flames were also burning fiercely. The flash of white light had far less might than before.

Bang!

The Astral Qi on Li Xuanfeng’s white bow weakened in the flames. The five arrows managed to block only five monks. The remaining three rushed forward, forming hand seals, "The ācārya taught me to invoke the Suxikong method, the Shijiali art..."

Ding dang...

Three intricately patterned golden chains flew from their hands, links interlocking as they coiled around Li Xuanfeng’s body. Sparks flew as they climbed up his arms, only for Li Xuanfeng, who had been waiting, to condense golden qi into giant hands, seize the chains, and yank fiercely.

Clang clang clang clang clang...

The sound of the chains striking the white armor thundered like rolling drums. The three monks were stunned as a tremendous force surged along the chains. Sparks exploded as they were pulled straight toward the white-armored figure.

Their spiritual senses flared. They saw the other five monks already closing in behind Li Xuanfeng, five dharma artifacts aimed at his back. Suddenly, realization dawned in their hearts, His spiritual sense must be scorched by the karmic fire, he can’t sense the situation clearly anymore!

Joy overtook fear in their hearts. They lunged forward, deeper into the embrace of that pale, rune-marked face, and shouted, "Die, monster!"

Boom!

Li Xuanfeng’s eyes had turned entirely pale-white. He unleashed a massive blow that shattered their dharma bodies. The three monks below him suddenly erupted with golden radiance.

Unfazed, his fist moved like a blur of light, smashing down upon the three below. Shards of glass-like limbs flew into the air as three anguished screams rang out, "Li Xuanfeng... you’re seeking death!"

But golden qi struck the massive dharma body without restraint. The three monks were already injured with missing heads or limbs, but three cries of regret and fury rang out as Li Xuanfeng yanked them toward him.

"You! How utterly foolish!"

None of the three had expected such ferocity. They were annihilated in an explosion of shattered shards of colored glass and drifting petals. Li Xuanfeng let out a muffled groan.

Crack!

Five dharma artifacts pierced through his body, dragging golden qi in their wake. He swept his white bow around in retaliation, but his movement had grown sluggish and heavy. The five monks leapt back nimbly, each retreating and laughing in unison.

"Excellent!"

Clatter...

Pale-golden qi flowed like blood, trailing down his armor's etched lines. It turned into a white mist in midair and dissolved into the flames. Li Xuanfeng slowly straightened.

Two spears had pierced through his body, with one entering at the left rib and exiting the back, the other transfixing his chest and abdomen. Both bore ornate golden patterns, releasing radiant light that seeped into him.

His left leg bore web-like fractures from a monk's war hammer. Two massive wounds had opened in his abdomen, revealing karmic fire dancing and burning in a hollow inside his white armor.

"Hahahahaha!"

The five monks retreated together, wary of a dying counterattack. Yet they all breathed a sigh of relief. Rather than feeling triumph, it was more like a weight had lifted from their shoulders.

Li Xuanfeng had judged correctly; the karmic fire in the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl was indeed a fusion of three fires. But each fire was of the Purple Mansion Realm. The five had known from the moment they saw it that his death was inevitable!

"No matter how powerful your white armor is, it’s rootless, like floating duckweed! How could it withstand such flames?"

His vision had been obscured and body grievously wounded, but he had still insisted on dragging three down with him. Now, all the five needed to do was guard against a dying blow, and wear him down bit by bit till he died!

Pleased with their advantage, the five monks each began plotting. They slowly and subtly widened the distance between each other. The glow around their bodies was not only watching Li Xuanfeng, but also wary of one another, If I can bring down a few more... wouldn't I earn a greater share of fate?

As the glow behind their heads grew stronger, their eyes began to shift. Their peripheral vision tracked each other’s movements. Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng stood motionless, raising his white bow.

His entire body was shattered, hollowed out by karmic flames burning within. His aura weakened bit by bit, yet he still stood firm, the string of his bow quietly humming.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

What is he doing?

The five were momentarily stunned as he drew his bowstring back to a full moon. Some chuckled, and one monk wielding a hammer even laughed aloud, "Bathed in karmic fire, what could you possibly shoot!"

Despite the mocking words, all five tightened their guard. Mana surged within them, ready to intercept at any time. It wasn’t carelessness; they simply didn’t want to be the first to make a move and risk falling to a teammate’s betrayal. And so, all five froze in mutual hesitation.

Li Xuanfeng raised his bow and aimed it straight at the hammer-wielding monk. The latter’s expression darkened, while the other four immediately smiled and activated their dharma artifacts, rising higher into the air.

Buzz!

A thunderous roar rang out as the white glow vanished from Li Xuanfeng’s bowstring. The other four simultaneously hurled their dharma artifacts at the hammer-wielding monk, whose face changed drastically as he cried out in horror, "You fools, how could you be so careless!"

Buzz...

The white light shimmered in Li Xuanfeng’s hand, but the white arrow materialized in front of another man, whose face bore a wrathful vajra expression.

Sword in hand, startled and furious, his voice thundered, "You dare!"

"Sowing discord..."

"Good!"

The hammer-wielding monk’s expression darkened, while the other three rejoiced. For the first time, they felt admiration for the white-armored man before them, Pity, how many arrows can he still fire? No matter his schemes, death awaits!

Li Xuanfeng was clearly engulfed in karmic fire; there was no faking that. His mystical arrows had grown weak and feeble. The three relaxed, sneering internally, Tricks of an insect! All he’s doing is helping us claim more glory!

While the five circled in midair, Li Xuanfeng pulled back his bow once again, and this time, a golden-red arrow shimmered on the string.

The arrow was slim but blindingly bright. It was the very mystical arrow forged in Green Pine Temple’s Mirage Mirror Heaven and tempered by Merging Fire and Binding Ring. It was highly resistant to flames. The other five had long melted in karmic fire, while this one merely glowed red.

Li Xuanfeng focused completely. Golden light burst from his white bow, gathering in his palm. Dense Astral Qi poured out like water, forcing the karmic flames around him back three feet.

He no longer looked like a man at the end of his rope. On the contrary, he was even more terrifying than before. The edges of his shattered white armor burned with searing brilliance, stirring fear deep in the soul.

Buzz...

All five froze as the familiar dread of death returned in full force. As Astral Qi surged outward, they all let out sharp howls in unison, shaking the flames around them, "Aaah!!"

Unbelievable shock filled each of their hearts. A single thought surfaced in all their minds, Impossible!

A torrent of golden light erupted like a pillar that connected heaven and earth, parting the karmic fire and converging into the golden-red arrow, which screamed with an ear-piercing shriek.

This arrow was forged from all the Astral Qi Li Xuanfeng had accumulated over countless shots. Over twenty years ago, he had used it against Yu Muxian and nearly killed that genius in a single strike...

Now, after twenty years, twenty years of late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm, of bloodshed and killing, every arrow held the force of years of effort. How could this accumulated force not be terrifying?

When the karmic fire scorched him, he realized his white armor could no longer protect him. But his decades of combat experience, far exceeding the battles these monks had ever seen, he made a split-second calculation and unleashed this arrow.

Buzz...

The five Master Monks in the air were instantly engulfed by Astral Qi. One after another, they and their dharma artifacts were devoured until they were completely erased in that overwhelming storm of Astral Qi.

The brilliant golden light flooded the entire Kongsijiang Demon Bowl. The mountain-sized artifact trembled, letting out a dreadful, muffled roar.

The two closest monks didn’t even have time to groan as their bodies and souls were obliterated in an instant. Even their dharma artifacts turned into golden dust as they were completely annihilated.

The next two had unfortunate comrades shielding them, one blocked by the white arrow, the other by a teammate’s body, yet they too were reduced to ash. Only two faint streams of light flickered in the karmic fire, falling earthward like meteors and veering northward toward reincarnation.

The last monk managed to shift half a step before his body vaporized into nothingness. He only had half a head remaining. His eyes were filled with disbelief, and he had no jaw left to speak. The head tumbled into the karmic fire with a dull thud.

"Ugh..."

He barely formed a mouth, but not a single word emerged. The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl grew dim. The white-armored man now stood before him, eyes cold and resolute. Hde stomped down without hesitation.

Crack!

Shards like colored glass scattered amid the rolling flames. The severed head still held a pleading look in its eyes, but it was crushed underfoot. The supreme golden qi shattered soul and spirit alike, ending his life.

Silence finally returned within the karmic fire. Li Xuanfeng was surrounded by the remains of monks and scattered dharma artifacts. The fire’s tongues licked at the white armor, gradually consuming the golden qi that cloaked him.

Drip!

Autumn dew trickled down Li Xuanfeng’s armor, only to evaporate into nothing in midair from the fire. He slowly pulled the golden spear from his chest and dropped it before him with a clang.

Crack...

He crushed the glass beneath his foot, then slowly sat down. The two Immortal Foundations within him had been reduced to a thin, flickering layer.

He had a faint smile beneath the pale-white runes as he sat atop a mound of broken dharma bodies like a man on his throne. His white bow was lodged in the chest of a corpse as it rested gently in his palm.

Beneath his feet stretched a field of shattered limbs like stained glass. There were arms, legs, snarling faces, and vajra-like bodies, all lying still in the karmic fire. The white bow stood beside him, glowing faintly.

He slowly adjusted his breathing as he waited for the remaining monks to arrive.

But perhaps the other Mahas had intervened, or perhaps the remaining Master Monks were not fools and had already withdrawn. The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl hovered motionless in the sky, but with no monks to sustain it, it lingered for no more than ten seconds before reluctantly fading back into the great void.

Li Xuanfeng sat atop the mountain of monk corpses. The scenery of Jiangnan finally returned in his flame-dimmed eyes.

The surging river flowed east, eddies curling through currents fast and slow. Its cold indifference remained timeless. Jagged rocks jutted up; waves rose and fell. The view was no different than before he entered the formation.

Only now, the river’s surface was crowded with petals, drifting and scattering freely. They clustered together, flowing with the current from west to east, rushing toward the distant Eastern Sea.

His eyes shifted slightly, turning north, along the river’s stretch of fifty kilometers from north to south. The ground was covered in glassy shards, all tinted rose.

"Truly beautiful," he muttered.




# Chapter 880: Annihilation

The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl in the sky faded, and the eye-like colors at the horizon disappeared with it. The radiant lights across the heavens dimmed, gradually returning to the normal sky.

All the cultivators simultaneously looked up, pupils dilating as they collectively froze. The purple-black hue and colored lights brought by the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl had yet to completely fade. The entire sky bore a light violet tint, with flowing lights that exuded an entrancing, soul-stirring aura.

But glass-like fragments of bodies, both big and small, were scattered across this violet sky. These Master Monks' dharma bodies were immense to begin with, and now they littered the air like countless fallen statues.

All eyes traced the trail of broken corpses upward until they landed on a mountain of golden remains formed from dharma bodies. A white-armored man sat quietly cross-legged at the peak, with a white bow planted beside him.

He slew the entire assembly of monks...

The scene lasted only a moment. Now that the suppression of the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl had vanished, the fragments of dharma bodies instantly vaporized into dazzling lights, and the floral rain in the sky intensified, accompanied by cascading shards of colored glass crashing down with clinks and chimes.

The crowd still craned their necks, stunned. Though it was but a fleeting moment, the sight was so terrifying it branded itself into the pupils of every cultivator present. Most hadn’t even moved to collect the falling glass, frozen in place.

Boom!

A muffled thunder rumbled. Li Qinghong rose first, transforming into a bolt of violet lightning. She pierced through the falling dewdrops and petal rain, searching for the white-armored Li Xuanfeng.

He had already descended on the wind. The gaping wounds across his body and the hollow insides beneath them had been concealed, and he was suited in his domineering white-gold armor once again. His white bow was held with casual ease in his hand.

Li Xuanfeng’s eyes, flickering with golden energy, now appeared faintly gray. He raised a hand to silence Li Qinghong’s words. She immediately swallowed her anxiousness, stood firm with her silver spear behind him, and the uncle and niece descended toward the southern bank amid the celestial phenomena.

Below, everyone stared blankly at the wonders overhead, allowing the pink petals to reach their knees. When Li Xuanfeng stepped onto the radiant pass summoned by the Huai River Map, even the noble Si Yuanli trembled, unable to meet his gaze.

Everyone knelt in reverence from west to east. The fierce and majestic man radiated brilliance in his white armor. Families on either side bowed their heads, immortal descendants lowered their gazes, and rogue cultivators and kin alike prostrated like blades of grass.

Dew and petals rained down as a thunderous chorus erupted from the southern bank, "Greetings, my lord!"

Li Xuanfeng gave a slight nod and gently raised his left hand. A scroll slowly materialized, floating long and horizontal in midair. The white-armored man unfurled it with a soft flick of his wrist.

Splash!

The long radiant pass beneath his feet instantly vanished, turning into streams of golden light that flowed back into the scroll. Li Xuanfeng said nothing more. The scroll spun once in the air and landed in front of Si Yuanli.

Swish...

Si Yuanli stared blankly at the sky as pink blossoms spiraled down onto his face, only to be brushed aside by the dharma light shielding him.

His perception technique was among the finest. He had clearly seen the glasslike dharma bodies scattered across the heavens the moment the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl vanished from the sky. Coupled with the terrifying, hair-raising phenomena, only one thought remained in Si Yuanli's heart, All eighteen Master Monks had been executed.

Soft petals had risen past his knees. Si Yuanli cast his gaze northward, where endless pink and gold stretched before his eyes. Dew, petals, and glass covered the land like an ocean, dazzling him so much he could hardly keep his eyes open.

Who could compare to such divine might in the last five hundred years?

The names of figures like Duanmu Kui and Shangyuan surfaced in Si Yuanli’s mind. Perhaps only that incident seventy years ago, the pacification of Xu State, when Shangyuan entered alone into a gathering of monks, slain two monks and three devils, and walked away unopposed, could be considered comparable.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝙬𝙚𝓫𝒏𝓸𝓿𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝓶

His gaze slowly traveled from the sky full of wonders to the cultivators along the riverbank. Some eyes held fear, some relief, and others joy. But one emotion prevailed among the family cultivators and rogue cultivators.

Reverence.

Si Yuanli looked away, dazed and confused. Li Xuanfeng slightly tilted his head and looked toward him, causing Si Yuanli to jolt upright and listen intently.

Li Xuanfeng’s slightly hoarse voice echoed through the air. It wasn’t loud, but it made all the cultivators bow and listen solemnly, "The northern monks have been slain. My duty as guardian is fulfilled. My lifespan and Immortal Foundation are all but spent. I only hope to be permitted to return to the lake and enter death."

His words made all cultivators raise their heads, stirred. Even those from the Yuan Family, who had clashed with him before, now looked at Li Xuanfeng with reverence. The entire assembly fell silent.

Though most cultivators had come to defend the river out of necessity rather than devotion, they had also fought with all their strength. After all, their families and cave dwellings lay behind the riverbanks, and who hadn’t brought their entire family?

Now, nearly all could see that it was Li Xuanfeng alone who had defended the riverbank. This fearsome man was about to enter death, and the families’ dread and fear gradually turned into relief. Along with reverence, came gratitude.

Thank goodness... truly, thank goodness...

Instead, it was the rogue cultivators and family members who exchanged glances filled with regret and gratitude, lifting their heads to look at him, at a loss for words.

But in Si Yuanli’s mind, a shudder ran through him. The ominous premonition he had been dreading was now reality. He thought in fear, He... he is going to enter death!

Li Xuanfeng dying in battle versus surviving with heavy injuries, these were two entirely different outcomes for Si Yuanli! Just moments ago, he had admired Li Xuanfeng’s imposing might and felt a touch of relief.

But now, his heart was left only with cold dread, This changes everything! This changes everything! Li Yuanqin is a close aide to the Chi Family. If he perishes in the line of duty, the Chi Family will seize the chance to exploit the situation!

At that point, it won’t even matter whether the Li Family can support us... the entire war might shift in a dangerous direction!

No matter how cold his heart felt, when the words reached his lips, all he could do was respond bitterly, "How could this be... Very well... Xuanfeng..."

Li Xuanfeng gave him a slow nod, his voice slightly lowered, "The Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman cannot be retrieved now. Once I enter death, my family will surely deliver it."

His gaze had softened slightly. Though the man hailed from Azure Pond Sect and had committed acts better left unspoken, the survival of millions behind the river was in no small part thanks to him. As a swordsman, at least he still held to some lines he would not cross.

Meeting his gaze, Si Yuanli felt a flicker of guilt. Li Xuanfeng was about to die, ultimately due to obeying his orders. The man had not yet realized how much Si Yuanli had come to admire him in secret. He only felt pain, What a pity...

Li Xuanfeng gave a soft laugh and transformed into a gust of bone-white wind, departing. The Li Family members had no reason to remain, and all rose into the air. Everyone stood to the side and spoke in respectful unison, "Respectfully seeing the lord off!"

The voices spread from east to west, gradually merging into one. Even Lingu Lanying’s eyes revealed a trace of reverence. She turned slightly and offered a salute in the direction of his departure.

"Respectfully seeing the elder off..."

Si Yuanli felt his chest fill with icy snow, but soon realized more and more eyes were turning toward him. A woman in green robes stepped forward, her attire elegant and striking, a sword at her waist. She first offered him a bow.

"This is bad!"

Si Yuanli’s scalp tingled. Lingu Lanying’s voice rang through his mind like a great bell, sending a jolt through his whole body, "Senior Yuanli! The northern cultivators have retreated. Should we proceed to aid Bianyan?"

Si Yuanli turned his head and realized the entire southern bank was watching him with cold stares. The silence was so complete one could hear a pin drop. Every gaze stabbed at him like blades, like a rain of arrows piercing him through. Those eyes held curiosity mixed with pressure, pressing against his chest little by little.




# Chapter 881: Better To Act Decisively

Lingu Lanying’s seemingly baseless remark caused the surrounding cultivators to subtly change expressions, turning Si Yuanli into the center of attention.

He didn’t need to think too hard. Just by looking at the crowd’s furious expressions, he knew that Chi Zhiyan’s orders and actions had long been deliberately leaked by the esteemed families. These cultivators may lack deep heritage, but they were no fools. Who among them wasn’t bitter right now?

Sending aid to Mount Bianyan?

If Lingu Lanying hadn’t brought it up in public, Si Yuanli wouldn’t have treated it as a matter of concern at all. Though the northern cultivators had retreated, the south was ultimately weaker, and who would dare act rashly with Li Xuanfeng on the verge of death?

Si Yuanli had only intended to dismiss the crowd, then secretly send a few to scout the north. He could then claim to the Chi Family that it was a rescue mission. With the riverside barely secured and no orders from the south, who could call him a liar?

Once the riverside crowd dispersed, only a few direct descendants of esteemed families would know what he had done. But Lingu Lanying’s blunt question had thrust him into the spotlight, leaving him prickling with discomfort under so many eyes.

This isn’t just about putting me in an awkward position...

The riverside fell silent. Si Yuanli stood slightly to the side, meeting the gaze of the green-robed woman before him. Her eyes showed no aggression nor outrage, only calm.

He realized the sword in his hand had gone cold. Though more calculating than his older brother Si Yuanbai, the moment he met that gaze, his heart had skipped a beat.

Any family that had lasted a century within the Azure Pond Sect represented more than just itself. It symbolized vast power behind the scenes, and at times, a particular voice, the Purple Mansion Realm.

In a moment so full of scrutiny, if someone from the Li Family spoke, Si Yuanli had to consider whether it was actually Xiao Chuting’s will. If someone from the Yuan Family acted, he had to wonder if Buzi had returned.

The Lingu Family, a naturalized house of Mount Yue, had stood firm for three hundred years and guarded the Southern Sea on the Azure Pond Sect’s behalf. Though their roots were deep and tangled, their true strength lay in being the in-laws of a Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Temple.

Lingu Lanying’s words represented more than just the Lingu Family, it also signified the stance of Jiachuan Prefecture, the Southern Sea cultivators, and even the shadow of the Lin Family from Xiukui.

His mind raced. Neither Lingu Lanying nor the Southern Sea cultivators had any real conflict with him. Their provocation was not meant as an attack, but a confirmation. They wanted a response from him, whether it be a vague evasion or a polite deferral.

Which cultivator present wouldn’t see through an attempt to shirk responsibility? As long as Si Yuanli wasn’t a diehard loyalist of the Chi Family, their resentment wouldn’t land on him. But then again, the Chi Family were no fools either.

The sword cultivator calmly sheathed his weapon as he said, "Chi Zhiyan has gathered elite forces and stationed them at Mount Bianyan, which is protected by a grand formation. The northern cultivators are being forced to detour around it. Mount Bianyan should be several times safer than here. They ought to be secure."

With a single sentence, he set the tone, indirectly confirming the rumors spread by the esteemed families and pinning the blame squarely on the Chi Family. Only then did he continue, "But the minds of devil cultivators are unpredictable, and their methods are strange. Who knows what schemes they may have? If the rescue fails, it would be a grave mistake. I will personally lead a team to investigate, in case a devil cultivator returns for an attack."

He spoke crisply and efficiently. Lingu Lanying nodded along, and several peak masters and daoists close to the Lingu Family stood behind her in contemplation, while the rest of the cultivators whispered among themselves and turned to peer at him.

Si Yuanli spoke warmly, "Everyone, please rest for now. The promised Essence Gathering Pills and spirit items will be fully distributed within three days. As long as I, Si Yuanli, am here, not a single one of you will be shortchanged."
𝙛𝒓𝒆𝙚𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝓸𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝓶

A chorus of cheerful voices rose from below. Si Yuanli stood with his hands behind his back on the riverbank, meeting Lingu Lanying’s smiling face.

His eyes narrowed slightly as the woman before him softly said, "Be at ease, senior. There are no unusual signs in the sky, and no one has fled back in defeat in a long time. It must surely be safe."

That reminded Si Yuanli; he didn’t believe in peace and safety at all. With such a perfect opportunity, the fall of Mount Bianyan was inevitable. The current silence could only mean the truth was being concealed.

Chi Zhiyan is finished.

Si Yuanli likely knew best of everyone how many were still at Mount Bianyan. For that very reason, he still found it hard to believe.

Chi Zhiyan, second only to sect master Chi Zhiyun in the Chi Family’s direct descendants, along with seven direct descendants, from Chi Liangzhe to Chi Dongqing, plus numerous peak masters and daoists of the Chi Family, whether by blood or marriage... and even Ning Heyuan from the Ning Family.

The two most talented generations of Chi Family juniors had been deliberately kept within the sect, only to be taken out by Si Boxiu. Then, they perished with him inside the grotto heaven!

The situation at Mount Bianyan was entirely unlike that of the riverbank. Chi Zhiyan was no Li Xuanfeng. Suddenly, Si Yuanli realized that Lingu Lanying’s question had been inevitable. His heart grew clear with insight, There is no room for diplomacy in sect strife and faction struggle. From the moment I chose to defend the riverbank, I had already taken a side. Be it the Li Family or the Lingu Family, the will of the people is clear.

A look of decisive clarity finally emerged on Si Yuanli’s face as he thought in his heart, In the path of shifting power, only speed and ruthlessness prevail. To seek compromise is to invite ruin. Better to be resolute!

————

Mount Bianyan.

Billowing demonic smoke drifted over the bloodstained mountaintop. A black boot sent ripples through a pool of blood as the sharp-eyed black-robed youth looked up at the sky raining with blood.

The green-robed cultivator before him had a handsome face and ethereal attire, yet the sinister glint in his eyes added a terrifying edge. He stood with sword in hand, his face covered in blood.

His dharma robe was slashed in several places. His complexion was pale and grim as he panted heavily, struggling to exhale the chilling air that had invaded his lungs.

"Chi Zhiyan..."

The black-robed youth said the name with a smile, and the blood pool beneath his feet trembled slightly with his voice.

Yu Jiang stood with arms crossed, three bone tokens circling around him, and smiled. "I heard you're the sect master’s younger brother from Azure Pond Sect. Well then... how do you like this grand gift?"

"Brother Yu Jiang, why waste words on him?!" Master Monk Xuwang let out a hearty laugh, though his eyes betrayed urgency. The spells in his hand grew fiercer and more relentless, breaking Chi Zhiyan’s tendons and bones. If not for the sturdiness of his dharma robe, he would have already collapsed.

Severed heads lay at his feet, their faces still frozen in terror. Chi Zhiyan gasped for breath, blood dripping steadily from his collar.

In just fifteen minutes, he had exhausted all his trump cards.

Chi Zhiyan’s innate talent was decent, but his strength was not outstanding, and he rarely needed to engage in battle. There was a clear gap against these opponents. If not for several powerful items on him, he would have been killed already.

As a core member of the Chi Family, he naturally carried Purple Mansion Realm talismans, multiple even. But after fifteen minutes of fighting, he had only used one, and even that had been neutralized through the combined efforts of his opponents.

Meanwhile, Yu Jiang’s shamanic arts had begun to take effect. When Chi Zhiyan reached for the embroidered pouch on his waist a second time, it had turned into a damp, furry golden rat, its long tail tied to his belt as it let out shrill squeaks.

How bizarre!

Chi Zhiyan carried not only Purple Mansion Realm talismans, but also a rare talisman that allowed a brief escape into the great void. It was tied to his wrist and was yet unused. Despite his repeated attempts to activate it, it showed no response.

Chi Zhiyan’s gaze moved past his opponents to the sky. His heart gradually calmed. The great void here had already been sealed. Even if Purple Mansion Realm cultivators could come and go freely, his talisman alone would not allow him to escape.

By command!

The black-robed youth cast another spell. Chi Zhiyan’s longsword suddenly transformed into a colorful lizard that twisted and bit at his wrist. Chi Zhiyan no longer had the strength to dispel the spell, he simply reached for his waist, hoping to switch weapons altogether.

Squeak, squeak!

The fat golden-furred rat squeaked again, and only then did Chi Zhiyan remember that the pouch could no longer be used. A wave of despair rose in his heart, To think I would fall here!

He didn’t know what had happened in the south, but the swarm of devil cultivators from the sky had sealed off Mount Bianyan. Demonic light shimmered in every direction.

To be fair, Mount Bianyan’s defenses were not weak. There were over ten peak masters, all of significant strength. Only four devil cultivators among the enemy were formidable, and the grand formation had only been breached in a few spots. They still had the strength to fight.

But the north did not only bring Yu Jiang and his three companions, but many more devil cultivators that surged from the south. Though they were weaker, they mercilessly slaughtered the Qi Cultivation Realm disciples on the mountain. Since the main four were holding off the top defenders, the key nodes of the formation were quickly dismantled and lost all brilliance.

The peak masters were then executed one by one. Chi Liangzhe, Chi Dongqing, and others had fallen before his eyes. Chi Zhiyan gradually understood that he had miscalculated, I should have abandoned the riverbank and let the devil cultivators sweep down from there, instead of having them trap us at Mount Bianyan! There would have at least been a chance to escape!

Chi Zhiyan’s heart turned cold. His storage pouch still held pills and talismans, yet Yu Jiang’s persistent spells prevented him from using them, while Xuwang pressed closer with ruthless aggression.

Finally, blue rain began falling from the sky. The blue rain was laced with droplets of blood, pouring over the battlefield. The Hooked Serpent seal floating in the air reverted to its true form and hovered silently.

The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal has been broken!

He could no longer see Ning Heyuan through the hazy rain. All he saw was a delicate-looking man in a python robe emerging with a long whip in hand, lashing out in a cold flash.

Splurt!

Chi Zhiyan could only raise both arms to block. The last of his mana had run dry. His dharma robe dimmed, and a searing ray of colored light pierced his chest. His heart turned utterly cold.

Xuwang’s palm strike pierced through his chest and shot upward, shattering his face as well. In that fleeting instant, what remained of Chi Zhiyan’s consciousness flickered, So I’ve ruined my brother’s great plan after all!

Boom!

As he fell, several beams of golden light mixed with rainbow hues shot into the sky. Xuwang suddenly rose into the air. Countless corpses and blood below him lifted with the surge, shining with golden radiance.

Wisps of soul-like pure energy rose skyward, flowing into his body. Xuwang sat cross-legged midair as a golden lotus bloomed beneath him, joy lighting up his face as he thought, Destiny has arrived!

————

Within the great void.

A vast, multicolored radiance condensed within the great void. Layers of iridescent clouds drifted like smoke as a dark-purple alms bowl hovered silently in the air, trembling slightly, yet unable to move.

A single dot of amethyst light rested upon the bowl. It was gleaming faintly, yet it was as immovable as a mountain. Just like that, the treasured Kongsijiang Demon Bowl, refined over many years by a Maha, was pinned in place within the great void, unable to advance or retreat, hovering dumbly in the air.

A woman in purple robes was standing before it. Her black hair was pinned back with an ordinary white hairpin. An elegant brow lifted as she looked northward, her gaze landing on the vast, round shape of Anhuai Heaven suspended within the great void. She said nothing.

"Zipei..." Maha’s voice echoed from near and far, tinged with fury, rumbling across the great void like a multitude speaking in unison, "It was one thing for you to ruin my plans, but now you won’t even let it go. What is it you want?"

Li Xuanfeng carried the fated weight of the north-south conflict. The Maha had been lurking in the great void, awaiting changes within Anhuai Heaven. But when he sensed such a ripe opportunity, he could no longer restrain himself.

If I could seize such a dense fate, wouldn’t that be perfect?

Though the Maha could not act directly, there was still a host of Master Monks in the north. He summoned them and granted the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl with the goal of forging a Merciful One under his command.

If one of them killed Li Xuanfeng and became his Merciful One, it would not be just any servant; he would gain a powerful subordinate. Then, with the Merciful One’s fate in his hands, he could absorb that destiny to nourish himself, skipping much of the effort required for cultivation.

The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl had three transformations. He had only used two. Though they had been summoned by a Master Monk rather than wielded by him directly, they were already more than enough to deal with Li Xuanfeng.

He had intended to take more time and let a few more monks die so their fate could gather, thus he had not unleashed the final transformation. Who would’ve thought Zipei would suddenly interfere, causing the prize already in his grasp to slip away!

That wretched woman actually didn’t enter Anhuai Heaven? How is that possible? thought the Maha.

To put it bluntly, with Shangyuan and the others now gone, Zipei was already the most formidable cultivator in Jiangnan. If she had entered Anhuai Heaven to compete with the others, she would have secured a significant share. Who could have predicted that she would show no interest?

Now, his treasured artifact was suppressed by Zipei’s divine power, trapped and unable to act. The Maha could neither advance nor retreat. He glared at her with hidden fury, secretly growing uneasy.

He had taken advantage of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's momentary absence in the south to summon two transformations of the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl. Though it had not been wielded by his own hand, relying on those monks to enact his plans was already crossing the line. Now, feeling guilty, he found himself at a loss for words.

Daoist Master Zipei finally spoke, "The bald monk certainly crafted a fine dharma artifact. So many transformations, all just to target a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator!"

She tilted her head slightly to the side, and a flicker of violet light spun atop the bowl. The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl shook violently, emitting pained wails.

Maha’s voice boomed in fury, "Fellow Daoist, are you trying to break the rules?"

Zipei watched coldly, her divine ability drawing forth a swirl of gray mist. The mist dispersed and transformed into three kinds of flame, each falling into her hands.

She lifted her head and said coldly, "You, Daisi, are no more than a Maha of two incarnations, and you dare speak to me of rules? Even Zhelu wouldn’t presume so much. Get lost while you still can!"
𝐟𝐫𝕖𝗲𝘄𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝕧𝐞𝚕.𝕔𝕠𝐦

Maha Daisi’s radiance flickered in the great void, bearing the flavor of forced restraint. He truly dared not retort. Retracting the wailing Kongsijiang Demon Bowl, his eye-shaped glow dissolved into a patch of rainbow mist and retreated northward.

An ordinary Merciful One possessed only early stage Purple Mansion Realm strength and lacked divine protections, making them comparatively weak. Even those who had cultivated for years were barely equal to an early stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

Only after becoming a Maha would one gain true power. It took three incarnations to reach mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, and five to seven to approach the late stage. Frankly speaking, Daisi was no match for the woman before him. He had no choice but to swallow his anger and flee like a defeated dog.

Zipei lowered her eyes, quietly gazing at Anhuai Heaven before her. The grotto heaven was gradually fading away, while the aura of Metallic Essence pulsed in and out, releasing a sudden, thunderous roar.




# Chapter 883: Scattered Geng, Drifting White

Moongaze Lake.

The sky was bright, while the lake water was clear and crystalline. Qingdu Peak stood tall in the middle of the lake. Stone steps wound up the mountain to the great hall. An old man, wrapped in a gray-blue cloak, paced in slow circles in front of the grand hall.

Li Xuanxuan waited a moment before finally seeing a spear-wielding man land in front of the hall. At the ninth stage of Qi Cultivation Realm, he brought his hands together in salute and said respectfully, "Siwei greets the Lord."

"How is the situation by the shore?" Li Xuanxuan raised him to his feet and hurriedly asked.

This man was none other than the calm and composed An Siwei, son of An Zheyan. The handsome and dignified man replied quietly, "What I saw just now was no illusion. To the north, everything along the river where the Fei Family moved was dyed in crimson, numbering over a million. It was mixed with glazed glass, golden sands, and various treasures, drawing cultivators to scavenge. There were figures everywhere.

"I overheard... those from the north say it was a sign of a fallen Buddhist cultivator."

Li Xuanxuan twirled his beard, heart sinking. He tightened his grip as he replied, "Buddhist cultivators excel in reincarnation. If one has truly fallen, it likely means the battle has reached a critical turning point."

"My lord says the same as well..." An Siwei was clearly referring to Li Xijun, who was still investigating by the shore. Before he finished speaking, frost and snow stirred before the hall, and Li Xijun swept in with the wind, the Han Lin hanging from his waist, his face still slightly pale.

"Xijun!" Li Xuanxuan called out to him.

Li Xijun returned the salute before speaking softly, "Quite a few Master Monks may have fallen. There seems to be some spirit artifact suppressing the riverbank, and the situation looks much better. Earlier there were a few devil cultivators circling around, but now not a single one remains."
𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝑐𝘰𝑚

He pressed a hand to his sword and took a step forward into the hall. After a moment of thought, he said in interest, "Seems Mount Bianyan may not be such a good place after all. The real experts are full of schemes. If the riverbank is held, then where would the devil cultivators go next?"

Li Xijun’s words eased Li Xuanxuan's mind considerably. The old man raised his brow and looked into the distance as he noticed a surge of silvery-gold aura from the north. He immediately grew alert.

Li Xijun’s perception technique was the most formidable. He had already seen through it. He exhaled lightly, and his eyes glimmered with unusual brilliance. The trace of worry between his brows vanished as he turned back with a smile and said, "It’s a great victory!"

He instantly relaxed inside, loosening the grip on his sword hilt. A new thought arose in his mind, Seems there was truly a scheme at play! But since I’m stationed in the rear, I haven’t heard much. Maybe Chi Zhiyan played a brilliant move... but if it was a scheme by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, then things are about to get very interesting!

Li Xuanxuan still couldn’t clearly see the distant figures, but when he saw thunderous clouds dyed in colorful light and golden aura glowing with Bright Yang as well as heard Li Xijun’s words, his heart relaxed. He had spent half the night anxious, but now his face could not hide the joy.

"The ancestors must be watching over us, this looks like a great victory!"

He gradually recognized his own younger kin, and counted several of them, but he did not see Li Xuanfeng’s figure. Instead, he noticed a man in white armor, around whom the others respectfully gave way as he walked. His status appeared extremely high.

The old man immediately said, "It seems there’s a high-level cultivator as well. That white aura is blinding, I can’t make out his face. We should’ve gone out to greet him earlier, so as not to be disrespectful!"

Li Xijun was briefly surprised, then understood that Li Xuanxuan did not cultivate a perception technique and couldn’t see clearly. He smiled inwardly and nodded solemnly, "It should indeed be more formal. Let us go and greet them together!"

The group rode the wind together to welcome them. Li Xijun stepped slightly ahead of Li Xuanxuan. When he sensed the family jade pendant at his waist glow in response, he was reassured and respectfully stepped aside with a junior’s bow.

Splash...

Li Xuanxuan’s eyes first fell on Li Qinghong, who was always valiant and spirited, though now a trace of worry lingered in her brows. Li Ximing and Li Xizhi were beside her. They looked somewhat worn out but bore no serious injuries.

Only after he calmed himself did he focus on the white-armored cultivator in the center. The man wore a tiger-headed black helmet that extended to his cheeks, and seemed extremely imposing. His pupils were pale, while his hair and beard were jet black. He seemed to be in his prime.

Faint white patterns shimmered across his face and neck, so glaring they made it difficult to look at him directly, let alone observe his features. Li Xuanxuan found his figure vaguely familiar and thought, This golden aura is even colder than my second brother’s Geng Metal. It might be a high-level cultivator of the Dui Metal Dao?

He dared not look further and turned his gaze away, but even before the man arrived, his presence already made everyone feel as if blades were cutting their faces. Li Xuanxuan grew more doubtful, pondering, Could this be a Daoist Master from the Golden Feather Sect? What ties could he possibly have to our family?

When the group finally approached, Li Xijun spoke in a gentle voice, "Greetings to all brothers and elders."

His voice was as clear as ever. Li Ximing and Li Xizhi looked dispirited and did not respond immediately. Even Li Qinghong turned to the man in the center.

Li Xuanxuan was puzzled when he heard a slightly hoarse male voice say, "No need for formalities."

Drip...

A drop of clear dew rolled off Li Xuanxuan’s gray-blue robe. Autumn dew had begun falling all over the lake, its sound crisp and piercing.

The sound made the old man lift his head instantly to meet those eyes. He said in a daze, "Xuanfeng...?!"

The pale patterns on Li Xuanfeng’s face had faded. His eyes were sharp and spirited. Having just slain a host of Buddhist cultivators, his suppressed killing intent had transformed into an indescribably majestic aura. His armor made him look all the more divine, like a celestial general descended from an Immortal Mansion.

Yet his face looked just over thirty. In an instant, Li Xuanxuan was pulled from breathless disbelief back into the past. The old man gave a soft grunt, his face slightly flushed as he said, "Second Brother..."

"Elder Brother." Li Xuanfeng replied softly, and the autumn dew over the lake grew even more intense, like a sudden downpour.

Beside him, Li Qinghong appeared worried and gently said, "Why don’t we head into the peak first..."

Li Xuanxuan, once the head of the family and no ordinary elder, quickly picked up on something from the junior’s expression. He stepped forward swiftly and led the white-armored Li Xuanfeng into the hall.

But his heavy gaze never left his younger brother’s face. His eyes were slightly red, as if studying something closely.

Li Xuanfeng had shed all his youthful arrogance like a divine bow weathered by time, revealing only a perfected essence. It wasn’t just Li Xuanxuan who was stunned, even Li Xuanfeng himself would likely pause if he saw his own reflection!

Li Xuanfeng took his seat and glanced around at the younger generation. After a moment, he brought up a matter in a quiet voice, "Qinghong, that Helian Changguang has been slain by my hand. You need not worry about him anymore."

Li Qinghong’s almond-shaped eyes reddened slightly. She nodded, not interrupting him. Li Xuanfeng’s pupils shifted slightly, and his voice remained calm, "All the Buddhist cultivators along the riverbank were slain, frightening the northern cultivators into retreat. Mount Bianyan sank without a trace. The Chi Family’s direct descendants and forces perished there. Si Yuanli acted under an immortal command and fanned the flames. Though it may appear righteous, enmity between the Si and Chi Families has now taken root.

"If I were to die, the Jiangnan families would surely celebrate. The Azure Pond Sect would fall into the hands of Si Yuanli and Lingu Lanying. Though Si Yuanli has some good in him, he is by no means indecisive. He will act when change comes."

His iron-hard face lacked some of his father’s calm, but it carried the domineering air of one who had slaughtered countless cultivators. His every word was chilling, "The five prefectures are where the Yuan Family once supported the Chi Family. With Yuan Tuan and Yuan Chengdun dead, how can there be no resentment? Huyuan is kind but weak, while Hudu is venomous and ruthless. Should the balance shift, they may not remain loyal.

"The Yu Family was fragmented by the Chi Family. Only Yu Yuwei could have united them, but he died early, so rising again will be near impossible.

"The Lingu Family is deeply entrenched and has long harbored ambitions. They have ruled the Southern Sea for generations and are an esteemed family of Mount Yue, allied by marriage to the Xiukui Family. Si Yuanli will surely court them with favor, and they may serve as his support...

"The Ning Family’s fate hinges on Ning Wan. Ning Heyuan likely has no chance of survival. Since the family will fall to Ning Hejing, they cannot be trusted lightly..."

His gaze swept across the crowd and landed on Li Xizhi. He said quietly, "Xizhi... Our Li Family has labored through three generations to reach the ranks of the Jiangnan families. The Chi Family has grown too large to control. Si Yuanli will surely use you. Handle family affairs on your own initiative."

"Rest assured, Second Great Uncle." The graceful and composed young man nodded, showing his usual poise. He said softly, "I only worry about Uncle Yuanqin..."

"It is of no concern." The white-armored man sat upright and spoke in a low voice, "He knows his limits."

Li Xizhi withdrew thoughtfully. Li Xuanfeng opened his eyes and looked at Li Qinghong, his voice softening, "Qinghong, if I am not around, you alone are best at combat among the family members. Thunder arts are fierce and explosive. Keep to the seas, deter those with ill intent, and do not involve yourself too deeply in the sect’s inner duels."

"Yes," replied Li Qinghong.

Only then did Li Xuanfeng turn to Li Ximing. Li Ximing had always feared him, and kept his head lowered, not daring to speak. The man before him merely asked, "Ximing, how confident are you in reaching the Purple Mansion Realm?"

Li Ximing felt bitter inside, his heart full of sorrow, and answered heavily, "Less than twenty percent."

Li Xuanfeng nodded, and said gently, "That’s already considered good. Don’t rush for quick success... Where is Minghuang?"

"He’s gone to the Eastern Sea, and has yet to return." Li Xijun answered softly.

Li Xuanfeng looked at him and spoke calmly, "You have a true passion for the Sword Dao. It’s a shame our family has held you back. Not everyone is born with the bearing of a sword immortal. Even Wang Xun had to travel the world. You should get out more."

Li Xijun paused slightly, only to see Li Xuanfeng turn to the elder nearby. For the first time, a slight tremor entered his voice, "Xuanling was the same back then. Once is enough, there’s no need for it to happen again.

"Bring the family registry."

Li Xijun immediately withdrew, and before even two seconds passed, he returned with a purple jade slip, along with a book pressed beneath it. Li Xuanfeng took it gently, placed the jade slip casually on the table, and lifted his hand.

Clang...

Golden aura gathered in his hand, condensing into a pen of interwoven gold and silver. He turned to a single page marked 'Uncle Branch,' then flicked the brush across it.

"Li Yuanyu." He handed the items to Li Qinghong and said hoarsely, "You’re the most perceptive of all when it comes to reading people. You saw it clearly. I handled this matter poorly, but I have no more chances. From here on, you must keep a close watch over things..."

Li Xuanfeng exhaled a breath of golden energy and fell silent. After a moment, he unfastened the brocade pouch at his waist, casually lifted its restriction, and gently drew out a white bow with his other hand.

This white bow was forged from transformed Geng Metal. Li Xuanfeng carefully examined the mystic bow that had accompanied him through a lifetime of battle, gently caressing it. The words 'Golden Age' on the bow vanished, shifting and transforming into two new words, 'White Lightning.'

His voice grew gentler as he said, "I wielded gold metal in the rightful position, and finally completed this bow. The rest of my belongings in the storage pouch shall remain with the Yu Family. This celestial bow, let it be passed on to Yuanqin."

Li Qinghong vaguely saw golden sands rolling beneath her feet. Realizing Li Xuanfeng’s time was short, she simply nodded. The white-armored man rose for the final time, silver-white light rippling across his face, and his voice rang out like clashing metal, "In the war between North and South, I killed without count. Murong, Helian, Emptiness, Compassion, all fell to my blade in blood debt...

"Now I enter stillness, and their resentment may rest for a time. Let no younger of the family travel north without reason, lest they fall victim to others. I, Li Xuanfeng, have committed the greatest bloodshed and done much evil. To fall by killing is only just, there is no resentment."

All those beneath the hall bowed their heads as tears streamed down their faces, but the man laughed heartily, pulling the sobbing Li Xuanxuan to his feet. He sent everyone else out of the hall with a light wave of his hand.

The doors slammed shut, and he laughed, "Brother... Our second uncle disliked wine, so the three of us never dared drink much. Now that all is settled, how about one final drink?"

A golden flask appeared in his hand, and he dropped a few glistening Wanglin Blossoms into it. Pouring it into jade cups, he smiled as he filled one for the weeping old man. Though his voice was slightly hoarse, it carried the boldness of one seasoned in war.

"Brother!"

Li Qinghong and the others stood outside the hall. The woman raised tear-filled eyes to see radiant brilliance flooding the entire hall, casting two shadows upon the door.

One brother cried, the other laughed, and their voices rang out. They spoke of green swords and white blades, of casting down fiery clouds, of throwing swords through wood, of youthful daring, of subduing serpents and felling monks, and of moonlit whales sinking beneath the tide...

The two laughed, argued, jested, and gambled with wine. When they spoke of shooting down the Lord of Golden Tang Gate with an arrow, they drank three rounds first, their arrows illuminating Chengshui Tomb, raising their cups in mutual respect.

Then they spoke of tearing apart the Yan State demon general with bare hands. They slammed the table and clinked cups as they told the story of slaying eighteen monks, slaking each toast with a full bowl.

Their laughter even drowned out the sobs outside the hall that echoed through the mountains. Li Xuanxuan had never felt so unrestrained and free. He spoke of things long buried, and Li Xuanfeng before him laughed heartily, bold and unflinching.

But the brilliance within the hall slowly began to fade, though the elder’s voice remained strong, "Xuanfeng! Back then, the seat of leadership... it should have been yours and Xuanling’s!"

Li Qinghong’s tears gradually ceased and her almond eyes fell. Only one shadow remained on the hall doors. Everyone looked up, listening as the old man shouted and cursed, wept and laughed, yet no one ever responded to him again.

Splash...

The autumn dew fell like rain from the sky, urgently drumming against the rooftops. A cold wind swept through the mountains, rustling the leaves with a loud whisper. It passed over everyone present, but not a single person summoned their mana.

The clear, transparent autumn dew rolled down their Dharma robes, circled once or twice in the muddy soil, and gradually gathered into a stream, washing the dirt down the stone steps and leaving behind a patch of cold, pristine clarity.

Li Qinghong lifted her head. The heavy clouds in the sky had scattered. Dusk deepened, stars began to twinkle, and the distant lake roared with waves. A few dark reefs rose from the surface, glinting faintly with metallic light.

She stepped forward quietly and gently pushed the hall doors open. Inside, starlight and moonlight cast a soft, warm glow. The dark-colored steps stood out clearly, and the old man was slumped asleep against a pillar, dressed only in a white inner robe. Thankfully, someone had kindly draped his gray-blue cloak over him.

In front of him was a scene of chaos, as the table was soaked in spilled wine. Yet across from him, everything was neat and tidy. The white bow stood upright by the desk, and a jade cup sat perfectly placed at the edge, filled with clear wine that reflected the moonlight, as if untouched.

A single Wanglin Blossom floated in the wine.

Her gaze slowly moved across the dark table. The only source of light in the grand hall was a charm, two fingers wide, placed on the corner of the desk, etched with intricate patterns. Everything was clean and orderly, as though the host had simply stepped away.

Li Qinghong did not step inside. She knelt lightly outside the door, her voice slightly muffled, and murmured softly, "Second uncle..."




# Chapter 885: Returning

The autumn dew over the lake had yet to fade even as the morning sun dimly appeared over the horizon. Li Qinghong stepped out of the great hall, and the sword-bearing Li Xijun approached her.

He said quietly, “All families may see clearly with the autumn dew filling the lake, but news of mourning should still be sent to all. Report to the Ning Family in the Azure Pond Sect, then pass word to Yi Mountain, the five prefectures, and even the cultivators along the riverbank. My lord preserved Jiangnan single-handedly, and such grace must be swiftly consolidated.”

Li Qinghong nodded and instructed him to proceed. Li Xizhi stepped forward lightly and continued, “I’ll handle the news to the Azure Pond Sect. I’ll set off in three days, after observing the proper rites...”

He paused, then shifted the topic gently, “We should also wait for Si Yuanli.”

No one showed any doubt. Li Qinghong nodded as though it were only natural. Si Yuanli, who would be returning triumphant to his residence, would surely stop by Moongaze Lake. He wouldn’t leave without presenting himself properly.

The woman then spoke softly, “Yuanqin is held as a hostage in Yi Mountain, and there was no hope of seeing him. But now that the Azure Pond Sect is in sudden chaos, we must seize this chance to summon him back at once. If we hesitate, we may never see him again.”

Though the Chi Family had suffered severe damage to its core and most of its direct descendants had perished, there could still be ambitious ones among the collateral branches. Li Yuanqin’s closeness to the Chi Family was well known, and Li Qinghong feared a shift in the situation could lead to unforeseen troubles.

“I’ll send someone there overnight.” Li Xijun replied softly. Just then, the formation let out a burst of sound, and a towering elder descended from within it, his back slightly hunched.

His voice was low and deep, “My lords, Li Wushao and Li Minggong have returned from the North. They are waiting outside the formation.”

“Quick, bring them in!” Li Xijun felt a chill run through his heart and quickly gave the order. Moments later, several figures descended from the formation and knelt before the hall.

Li Minggong was in front, and bowed at the base of the steps, “Greetings to all elders...”

Her face was slightly pale, but her clothes were still neat. She was clearly in the best condition among them all. The grim-faced Li Wushao, an elderly man, stood behind her with a burly figure. Both of them were at the ninth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

The elderly man had a full white beard, a smooth, bald scalp, and was missing an eye. He knelt blankly on the ground. The burly man was physically intact, but his face was the color of gold paper. He was also swaying like a teetering iron tower, as if he could collapse at any moment.

Li Qinghong lowered her eyes slightly and spoke softly, “The upheaval at Chengshui Tomb that broke Mount Yan Pass was part of a larger shift, it is not your fault. Go on and speak.”

Li Minggong, a bright and gracious woman from the first lineage who had always been fond of smiling, now spoke with a choked voice, “Less than half a day had passed from when the lords had entered Chengshui Tomb when the devil cultivators arrived. A devil general rode in on a wave of violet aura, holding Yu Su’s severed head. He activated several talismans and breached the pass in under fifteen minutes.

“The cultivators collapsed like a landslide, fleeing south in panic, fearing only that they weren’t running fast enough. They trampled over the rear formations, and half of them abandoned their posts. Midway, I encountered Master An, who was gathering the scattered forces under his banner. We made our way toward Aunt.”

The Aunt she referred to was naturally Li Yuexiang. Regret colored Li Minggong’s face, and she choked up for several breaths before continuing, “The scene was complete chaos, with a grey and overcast sky. We couldn’t tell which experts were above us. The hearts of the people had scattered, so we rushed toward the rear. Soon we saw Aunt Yue, wielding her sword and controlling fire, locked in battle with a devil cultivator...”

At this point, she was overcome with sobs. Behind her, An Zheyan, who resembled a lifeless corpse, crawled forward a few steps on his knees and took up the tale in a hoarse, grating voice, “I sought only to aid, and led the cultivators to support her. When Yuexiang saw us, her expression changed. She rebuked me... and said...

“Master An, are you here to harm me as well?!”

At those words, Li Qinghong slowly closed her eyes. Li Xizhi lowered his head. Li Xijun’s hand gripped his sword hilt so tightly that his knuckles turned white.

An Zheyan’s forehead knocked hard against the ground as he went on, “Then a Buddhist cultivator descended from the sky, calculated with his fingers, and smiled with delight. He looked around and said, ‘I nearly missed a fine delicacy.’”

Li Xijun dared not look at Li Xizhi. He stood alone as An Zheyan continued, weeping, “Only then did this old man recall that Buddhist cultivators relish esteemed blood, it was already too late. That bald demon struck Li Qin dead with a single palm, plucked out his heart for inspection, then sneered. All the cultivators were shaken with fear...”

“My son Siming charged in with his sword but died in five exchanges. That bald monk killed several others, and was about to strike me when Li Wen threw his hammer to stop him...”

Li Minggong had regained her composure and continued softly, “Aunt Yue took my hand and said urgently, ‘If I must die today, I will not drag others with me.’ Then she relinquished her spiritual essence, summoned a talisman, and looked at Master An, saying, ‘Escort them home, do not waste my life in vain.’

“We fled several miles, while Aunt Yue used a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman to protect herself and headed north. She was cloaked in pheasant fire; it must have been self-immolation.”

There must have been quite a few survivors back then, yet only the two with the highest cultivation made it out.

An Zheyan merely kept knocking his head to the ground. “I am incompetent. Please execute me to atone for my crimes.”

An Zheyan collapsed to his knees like a corpse. Li Yuexiang, An Siming, Li Qin, nearly everyone had died because of him. How could the old man not be driven nearly mad? Inwardly, he repeated to himself coldly, In the past, I was reckless and caused my eldest son’s death. Now, I’ve caused the death of my second son, and brought ruin upon my lord’s family and fellow cultivators out of stupidity. A man more useless than me does not deserve to live. Better to die early, so I harm no one else!

Li Qinghong gazed quietly at the old man before her. He had served faithfully since the time of Li Tongya, through four generations. His two sons had both given their utmost, and even now, An Siwei was still guarding below the mountain. How could she say anything more? The hall fell into heavy silence.

At last, Li Wen spoke. The honest man had already discarded his golden hammer and said in a deep voice, “The situation then was urgent. Had I been leading, I too would have gone to help. Master An merely happened to be there in the moment... I ask to be punished along with him.”

Li Minggong also stepped forward to accept punishment. Only Li Wushao remained in the rear with a sour expression, lost in his own thoughts.

All of Jiangbei was in chaos at the time. If they saw their own kin locked in battle with devil cultivators, anyone not exceptionally sharp would have struggled to react in time. The elders above said nothing, their expressions heavy.

Li Qinghong waited for a while before Li Xizhi finally spoke, his voice quiet, “Were any belongings left behind?”

At last, Li Wushao stepped forward. He held up a broken sword and a small box with both palms. Li Xizhi took them gently, glanced briefly inside the box, then quickly turned his gaze to the sword.

The wooden talisman tied to the sword’s end swayed gently. Li Xizhi examined the script, then put the sword away. He handed the small box to Li Qinghong before finally speaking, “Deliver lenient judgment.”

Chengshui Marsh.

The gloom over Jiangbei had gradually faded away. Bright light reflected across the surface of Chengshui Marsh. The Converging Water had also thinned, and one could vaguely make out the wreckage at the bottom.

The air trembled faintly as the pitch-black great void revealed itself. An elderly man in green robes emerged, holding a talisman. He stood suspended in midair, his complexion slightly flushed, and began coughing, Cough... cough...

His cough stirred ripples across the water’s surface, causing it to flash with a hint of golden light. A young man, also in green robes, appeared behind him and stepped forward cheerfully.

“Uncle, are you feeling better?”

The elder kept a stern expression, his voice slightly hoarse as he replied, “Mount Changhuai is, after all, the leading sect of Wu State... not so easily dealt with...”

This was none other than Daoist Master Yuan Xiu, Si Boxiu. He glanced at Chi Buzi before him and frowned. “And yet you didn’t even make a move? Three strands of Metallic Essence. If you’d truly given it a go, you might have seized one for yourself.”

Thinking back, he still looked regretful and said with a sigh, “That was the Metallic Essence left behind by the True Essence and Divine Fiend True Monarch Tianwu... That Fruition Attainment is still unclaimed. The essence itself is a thing of beauty. Even if True Monarch Tianwu had some scheme, he acted with honor. At the very least, he would have risen to a subordinate station...”

“Haha...” Unexpectedly, Chi Buzi laughed twice, glanced northward, shrugged, and replied, “Uncle, you know I’m the most suspicious sort. Just looking at that thing gives me the creeps. I’m no saint; if I really tried to attain True Essence, who knows if I’d even succeed? I fear the lord’s backup plan would send me off to the afterlife before I got there.”

Si Boxiu burst into laughter, shook his head, and sighed, “You overthink it. If the True Monarch hadn’t perished, the three strands of Metallic Essence in Anhuai Heaven wouldn’t look like this. The Fruition Attainment remains unclaimed simply because our lord has no use for it. He certainly wouldn’t fake death just to leave it vacant.”

The old man paused for a moment before replying, “At most, it’s like the moon and sun not responding. There’s no way a True Monarch could exist while the Fruition Attainment remains vacant.”

Chi Buzi curled his lips, activated his divine ability, and calculated with his fingers. He shook his head and said, “I’ve nothing more to say. I still need to divine something, I don’t have time to waste here.”

Daoist Master Yuan Xiu squinted slightly and said suspiciously, “You’re not going back to the sect? Zhiyun is in closed-door cultivation, trying to break through. I fear no one is left to oversee the larger affairs.”

“Forget it!” Chi Buzi waved his hand disinterestedly and said, “Isn’t Uncle still around? If worst comes to worst, there’s always Lord Suiguan. What’s there to worry about?”

Chi Buzi had no intention of returning to manage the Azure Pond Sect on behalf of Pristine Water. Ever since Chi Wei's death, he had gradually come to see the flaws in the pursuit of Metal essence. Every moment spent in the Azure Pond Sect felt like torment. Why would he return at all?

Si Boxiu furrowed his brow, his voice growing solemn, “You know well what Lord Suiguan is like. The Chi Family was never populous to begin with, and now there isn’t a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator left. How can they hold the ground? With Zhiyun in seclusion and you refusing to return, the Chi Family may not endure.”

Heh!

Chi Buzi sneered inwardly and thought to himself, I’ve been gone for years, and he’s the one who’s been thrilled! He’s coveted the Moon Glazed Tree for ages, and now he’s finally getting his wish! He’s probably praying I die out here!

Chi Buzi, being extremely cunning, fully understood Si Boxiu’s true intentions. He knew the kind-sounding words were mere pretext, so he simply smiled and said, “I was born into this world to follow my nature and cultivate my fate. My parents gave me life, but they never forced me to do anything. I cared for them without obligation. They died early, and I’ve since changed bodies multiple times, so what bloodline could I possibly speak of? ‘Chi Buzi’ is just a name. What has the Chi Family to do with me?

“An immortal ought to cast aside worldly burdens, thinking of family, then sect, then all beings, and finally the cosmos... but the cosmos follows natural law. What does that have to do with me? A Daoist Master has but one truth, the ‘self.’ To follow nature and fate, succeed and one ascends, fail and one dies.”

Si Boxiu looked at him deeply, as if slowly beginning to understand why this man could cultivate with such speed, breaking through barrier after barrier. He only shook his head silently, He bears no concern for morality, family, or all living beings, only the word 'immortal' remains in his heart.

Chi Buzi had no interest in mincing words. He was eager to seek out Purple Mansion Realm demonic creatures. He said everything he needed to in one breath, then entered the great void and vanished without a trace.

Left behind, Si Boxiu stood in silent thought, running several things through his mind, There were only three strands of Metallic Essence to begin with. Zipei struck unexpectedly, caught Zhelu off guard, and forced the essence out. In the end, the Buddhist cultivators didn’t get a single share. How satisfying!

But this was also Kan Xuyu’s final move. Once she returns, she’ll be attempting to attain Purple Essence... how incredibly difficult that is. Once she succeeds, this entire North–South contest will come to an end.
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝐰𝚎𝕓𝐧𝚘𝘃𝗲𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝕞

Si Boxiu gathered his sleeves, stepped into the great void, and with a turn, disappeared as well.

————

Mount Bianyan.

The sky above Mount Bianyan was completely empty. The vegetation on the mountain was torn and scattered. Even the hundred spirit cords embedded into the mountain as formation anchors had cleanly been dug out. Si Yuanli stood at the summit, quietly gazing into the distance.

Clad in a flowing Dharma robe and bearing a sword at his waist, he appeared otherworldly in posture, yet his brows were knit with concern. Behind him stood his nephew, Si Tongyi, his most trusted aide.

Most of the Chi Family’s direct descendants, as well as the peak masters and guest cultivators, had all died here. The resulting phenomena had been utterly suppressed, leaving behind only devastation, as if nothing had ever occurred.

He had no need to feign sorrow or sigh in lamentation in front of his confidants. He simply stood in the night air, lost in silent contemplation.

His other companions had been sent off to search for Chi Zhiyan’s whereabouts, but the white-robed middle-aged man knew his fate full well in his heart, The Mahas and Purple Mansion cultivators of Jiangbei have dissipated together. The larger confrontation between North and South has vanished as well. Everything can now be calculated piece by piece. The soul lamps on Azure Pond Peak must have gone out in swaths like a storm passing through. There’s no way to hide it.

Every move Si Yuanli made in the limited time left would shape the fate of the Azure Pond Sect. The faces of each family head and each peak master flashed through his mind. Alone, facing the biting winds, he exhaled deeply.

After turning it over in his mind, something struck him. He turned quickly toward Si Tongyi. He flipped his hand over and produced a white jade command token.

He said with solemn urgency, “Take my seal and rush back to the sect tonight. Deliver a secret order to Li Yuanqin. Tell him to go to Moongaze Lake to see his father one last time. This must not be made public.”

“I fear it may already be too late...” Si Tongyi said thoughtfully,

But Si Yuanli shook his head. “Whether he makes it in time doesn’t matter. It’s just an excuse to send him back to the Li Family. Let them talk, and see what he’s made of.”

Si Tongyi rose at once and rode the wind southward at full speed. Only then did Si Yuanli relax slightly and return to his thoughts, looking for any missed details.

After a while, divine light surged before him. Si Yuanli looked up thoughtfully, as a familiar aged figure appeared. Joy lit his face and he felt a sense of relief as he bowed respectfully.

“Ancestor!”

Daoist Master Yuan Xiu swept his gaze over the ruined Mount Bianyan, his eyelid twitching. He said nothing, and merely flicked his sleeve. Si Yuanli’s surroundings instantly dimmed, he was now walking within the great void.

“Daoist Master... the Huai River Map guarded the riverbanks. Li Xuanfeng used the Monarch Calling Golden Talisman and died in fierce combat... We followed orders and used every hidden card the Daoist Master had left behind...”

Si Yuanli swiftly reported everything, only to see Si Boxiu standing silently, expressionless, hands clasped behind his back. There was no hint of praise on the old man’s face, only wordless stillness.




# Chapter 887: Condolences

Si Boxiu stood with his hands behind his back, seemingly lost in thought. The late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator said nothing, but Si Yuanli could read his expression. He was already harboring doubts, but a chill of dread surged through his heart.

Could it be...

Just as the chill set in, he noticed a look of amused interest appear on the elder’s face. The old man turned around and spoke, “Li Xuanfeng... though he hadn’t reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he was still a remarkable talent of his time. Yuan Su’s eye for talent has always been accurate.”

The words eased Si Yuanli’s mind. The old man fell into thought again, raising his brow to gaze northward as he mused, What a scheme. That boy Houfu must’ve had a hand in this. The Sword Gate and the aloof Hengzhu shouldn’t be involved... Xiao Chuting wouldn’t have the time either... who else... could it be Changxi? Would he dare?

It no longer mattered whose plan it was. Si Boxiu soon turned and said casually, “I saw Chi Buzi in Anhuai Heaven. He’s already at the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. He is cultivating in solitude, and truly the prized tree of the Chi Family.”

The color drained from Si Yuanli’s face. Before he could ask further, Si Boxiu shot him a glance and continued, “He’s focused solely on the path to immortality now. He said he’ll no longer involve himself in Azure Pond Sect matters, and has cut ties with the Chi Family.”

Si Yuanli relaxed instantly, now more confident in his own schemes. Forming a seal and casting a spell, he drew a small cauldron from his sleeve, along with a securely bundled scroll, and said solemnly, “This junior has obtained the item that Daoist Master requested.”

This was, of course, the bronze cauldron from the Great Ning Palace. With the constant battles inside the palace, there’d been no time to refine it. He’d had to flee while lugging it around. Now that he had the chance, he had refined it into a palm-sized cauldron.

Si Boxiu accepted it without fuss, squinting slightly as he said hoarsely, “When I return to the sect, say I’ve entered life-or-death seclusion to heal. Don’t respond to anything from the outside world.”

Si Yuanli understood immediately and nodded, then asked softly, “Ancestor... may I ask about Anhuai Heaven...”

“No need to ask.” Yuan Xiu cut him off and said in a soft voice, “From now on, if any talented youth cultivating True Essence appears under the Azure Pond Sect’s jurisdiction or within the Southern and Eastern seas, report to me immediately.”

“Yes!”

Si Yuanli responded, and at last, Si Boxiu’s gaze fell upon him. His voice softened slightly as he said, “You’re more sensible than those other uncles and cousins. From you downwards, Tongyi and Tongwen are all capable. In the past, I had to carry the burden alone, but now our Si Family should rise again. We can finally stretch our arms and legs.”

Si Yuanli understood what he meant, but one matter still weighed on his heart. Taking advantage of the elder’s good mood, he spoke softly, “It’s just that our family still has too few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of our own blood. I wonder if there’s any chance of bringing my elder brother back...”

The moment he mentioned his elder brother Si Yuanbai, Si Boxiu’s expression darkened, anger flashing across his face as he said coldly, “Him? He’s hopelessly rigid and soft-hearted, utterly blind to the situation. He listens too easily to others; if you bring him back, he’ll just oppose everything! Better to let him wander freely.”

“Please calm your anger, Daoist Master...”

“Calm down?” Si Boxiu’s face grew even darker, and he growled, “Where did he get the guts to reprimand Chi Wei in front of all the Daoist Masters? That rabid dog was desperate to extend his life, his eyes glowing green with greed, and even Yuan Su stepped aside for him! But your brother ran straight to Azure Pond Peak to hurl insults!

“If I hadn’t acted first and suppressed him beneath the tower, Chi Wei, who’s nearing the end of his lifespan, would’ve lashed out, disregarding my face and the younger generation. As it is, not even his bones can be found!”

Si Yuanli could only sigh. Si Boxiu glanced at him, then gradually eased his tone. “The Moon Glazed Tree grows on Azure Pond Peak. It's a spirit item that can assist in breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm. If you get the chance, take note of it... as for Chi Zhiyun, ignore him. If he breaks through too early, I’ll handle it.”

Break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!

Those words struck Si Yuanli like thunder. The allure of Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities was immense. A rush of heat surged to his head, as he struggled to believe what he’d heard.

Si Boxiu paid no further attention to what the junior might do next. With a flick of his sleeve, he sent him back to the mortal world, then continued drifting through the sky, lost in thought, Yuanli’s ruthless move suits the situation. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are all of one mind. Li Xuanfeng has already been used thoroughly. He protected Jiangnan and died at the right time. No need for me to intervene.

The younger generation is stirring up storms, so this is the perfect moment... as for Chi Zhiyun...

Si Boxiu let out a cold chuckle and said quietly, “The boy fears Buzi and is too impatient. Soon, Zipei will break through, and a dragon kin will swallow thunder... Heaven and earth’s spiritual aura shifts every decade. Mount Azure Pond is only five hundred kilometers from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. You want to break through to Purple Mansion Realm and attain Fire Virtue divine abilities? Then waste decade after decade trying in vain!”

The old man put away the talisman in his hand, his figure gradually fading into the great void, leaving behind only a faint murmur in the air. “Mount Changhuai dispatched several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to protect this Metallic Essence... there must be a scheme brewing. The immortal system of Wu State differs from Yue State. Four sects, nine esteemed families, and Mount Changhuai stands above them all. This makes it far easier to act as they please...”

————

Moongaze Lake.

The mourning rites lasted three days. Li Xuanfeng's storage pouch lay quietly on the table. Everyone, having busied themselves with the funeral, finally sat down together.

Li Xuanxuan only woke up after two days of drunken stupor. The Wanglin Blossom, brewed to prolong life and ease sorrow, had been specially prepared for him by Li Xuanfeng. Only with it had he been able to drink so freely. Its effects still lingered, leaving the old man somewhat dazed.

Li Xijun took the registry in hand, its pages densely packed with names. After reading it carefully, he sighed inwardly.

The Li Family had contributed more than any other in this struggle between north and south. From the chaos at Chengshui Tomb, the crushing defeat at Mount Yan Pass, to the battle at the riverbank, they had given everything, suffering grave losses.

The disasters at Chengshui Tomb and Mount Yan Pass had been completely unforeseen. All cultivators below Foundation Establishment Realm perished at Chengshui Tomb, while barely one in ten survived at Mount Yan Pass. As for the riverbank battle, fought just behind Moongaze Lake, the Li Family fought with the utmost valor and self-sacrifice.

Though most of their Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had survived, the prominent families, guest cultivators, and especially the Radiant Lure generation of the Li Family suffered unprecedented losses. White mourning cloths hung at every household.
𝐟𝚛𝕖𝚎𝕨𝗲𝐛𝚗𝐨𝐯𝐞𝕝.𝐜𝗼𝗺

Many skilled guest cultivators of the Li Family had headed north. Chen Donghe had been wounded in the riverbank battle, though not seriously. An Zheyan had lost an eye. Only Li Wen and Tian Zhongqing remained; nearly everyone else who went north perished.

The Radiant Lure generation was nearly wiped out. Only Li Minggong had made it back alive from Mount Yan Pass. Li Chengliao and Li Chenghuai had been defending the riverbank. Li Chenghui had been in the Eastern Sea. Lastly, there was also Li Chengdan, whose cultivation was lacking. Only these few remained out of the dozen Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators before.

Li Xijun looked through the list again, his heart heavy. When he looked up at Li Qinghong, he saw that she had already reviewed the registry. Seated at the head, her mood was clearly grim as well.

The restriction on Li Xuanfeng’s storage pouch had long been removed. Li Qinghong picked it up and looked toward Li Xuanxuan. The old man shook his head, so she could only rise and speak gently, “In accordance with the elder’s will, all belongings shall be confiscated.”

She opened the storage pouch and poured its contents out with a rustle. Clearly, Li Xuanfeng had made thorough preparations before heading north. Much of his wealth had already been left to Li Yuanqin. The items now laid out mostly came from the Great Ning Palace. They were brilliant, dazzling, and varied, but possessed a weathered, ancient aura.

Li Qinghong swept her spiritual sense across the table, immediately counting everything, and briefly froze.

Seventeen Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts, eleven Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items, four treasured panaceas, and seventy-five Qi Cultivation Realm spirit items!

There were plenty of spirit items, though none at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. After fighting his way through the Great Ning Palace, Li Xuanfeng’s collection of Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items alone far exceeded the Li Family’s reserves.

The Li Family had operated by the lake for over a century. Their stores were naturally full of Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit items and many Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts. But Foundation Establishment spirit items and treasured panaceas were rare, and they usually had fewer than fifty types of Qi Cultivation spirit items.

Setting aside the armor prepared for Li Zhouwei and various miscellaneous items, several objects placed at the center immediately drew everyone’s attention.

From left to right, they were a stack of golden talismans, a letter, an incense burner, a screen the length of an arm, and a drop of mercury.

Li Qinghong examined them closely. The golden talismans and the mercury drop were inscrutable in depth. The incense burner was a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact crafted with ancient techniques. It had not yet been refined and glowed a dull red; the base bore the seal character Sima.

She picked up the letter first and unfolded it. The letter was written on a kind of spiritual fabric, carelessly folded and pressed under the incense burner for who knows how many years. Deep impressions of the burner’s base remained.

The script danced across the page like dragons and was written in ancient seal characters, Chen Xuanli and Chen Xuanxiang have gone south into Yue and founded a sect called Lingyu Gate. The King of Yue holds them in high regard; they are not easy to deal with. Your esteemed family has long guarded the riverbank and must remain vigilant... The True Monarch has not responded in years; caution must come first in all matters.

The letter appeared to be from a cultivator of Ning State, addressed to the Sima Family. It was an old matter regarding Lingyu Gate. Li Qinghong read it carefully and thought to herself, So the Chen family of Lingyu Gate truly did migrate from Ning State. No wonder they gave their full support in the siege against Daoist Master Donghua. It was likely for the sake of the Ning's Li lineage.

The King of Yue held them in high regard... but the Chen Family is now destroyed, and the Yang Family is thin in numbers. Who knows when that old ancestor will achieve a breakthrough.

She passed the letter along for others to read and picked up the screen. It, too, had not been refined with mana and was now only the length of an arm. The painting on its surface was indistinct, and it lay quietly in her palm. The screen was also a dharma artifact made with ancient techniques.

But the screen had a mysterious luster, and Li Xuanfeng had placed it carefully in a corner. Clearly it was no ordinary item, and Li Qinghong gave it a few extra glances.

Both of these ancient dharma artifacts were extraordinary. Just refining them would take several months, so their full potential couldn’t be seen for now. Just as Li Qinghong was about to speak, an old man transformed from a white ape descended into the hall.

He spoke in a buzzing voice, “Message from the riverbank, the northern cultivators have retreated. The Azure Pond Sect's immortal envoy has reached the northern shore and is heading straight for Qingdu.”

Li Xizhi nodded and added aloud, “I’ve also received word. Mount Bianyan suffered a devastating defeat. They say the grand formation was breached, and everyone scattered. But eight or nine out of ten likely won’t survive.”

As the master of Azure Pond Peak, Li Xizhi was better informed. The others exchanged glances. Li Xijun lifted his head thoughtfully and said in a low voice, “If the carnage reached this level, there must be Purple Mansion Realm cultivator scheming involved. Great uncle predicted it well, the Chi Family’s bloated influence is now plain to see.”

Li Qinghong had personally taken part in the matter and knew the truth best of all. She even knew that Daoist Master Changxi of Profound Peak Gate had played a part. But such things were not for open discussion, so she only nodded slightly. Li Xijun followed suit, and the group rode the wind out of the grand formation together.

Li Xizhi still looked a bit downcast. The aunts and nieces were all dressed in white. A faint glow of white spirit boats appeared in the distance. Though they couldn’t compare to the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner, they were still decent immortal vessels.
𝕗𝗿𝕖𝐞𝐰𝗲𝕓𝐧𝕠𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝐨𝚖

It was rather ironic as the Dawn Cloudliner was a rare and extravagant weapon. But since the north-south conflict involved powerful cultivators, Chi Zhiyan was reluctant to use it. As a result, the Azure Pond Sect only used the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner to transport personnel, and the immortal vessel was still docked at Azure Pond Peak.

Si Yuanli’s presence was visibly diminished without the Dawn Cloudliner. Gone was the typical grandeur of the Azure Pond Sect, where the heavenly glow would arrive before the immortals themselves. The white cloud boat drifted in from afar and was only noticed when it reached the lake.

But Si Yuanli didn’t care. He sat in the cabin, somewhat lost in thought, still shaken by what he had learned, Purple Mansion... So the Moon Glazed Tree is a spirit item that helps one break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!

The Azure Pond Sect had many ways to assist breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. There was the Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill, Tonghua Powder, Essence Gathering Pill, and more.

Most were used by the direct descendants of the Chi, Si, Ning, and Tang Families. The Essence Gathering Pill was especially precious. Just swallowing it gave a five percent success rate, and if one refined an Immortal Foundation or a Foundation Establishment Realm demonic beast, the chances multiplied. If the Immortal Foundation even matched the user’s cultivation method, the success rate could rise to forty or fifty percent!

However, as a descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm lineage, Si Yuanli knew that ways to aid in breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm were rare. Pills? Somehow, after the cataclysms, all pills meant to assist in Purple Mansion Realm breakthroughs had lost effectiveness. Only a handful of pills developed post-cataclysm were useful, and they were exceedingly rare.

The only options left were cultivation methods and secret arts. The Si Family’s Wesang Scripture was a Purple Mansion Realm technique of the rare Wood Virtue lineage. Passed down through generations, it contained four secret arts. Mastering them could increase one’s breakthrough chances by twenty percent. It was an extremely rare advantage.

“Ning Wan’s cultivation method only has one secret art... even the Chi Family’s murky and weighty Dark Floating Compliant Cloud Sutra only contains four.”

These secret arts were painstakingly developed by their predecessors and weren’t necessarily tied to the grade of the technique. It largely depended on the prestige of one's ancestors. As such, the Si Family’s long-standing heritage gave them an edge over the Ning Family.

As for using spirit items to assist in Purple Mansion Realm breakthroughs, the process was mysterious and unreliable. Truthfully, most Purple Mansion Realm cultivators succeeded through sheer risk and resolve. But now, with this fruit in reach, how could his heart not pound with desire?

“My lord... we’ve arrived at Mount Qingdu!”

Si Yuanli was pulled back to reality. He adjusted his robes and rose, lifting the jade curtain of the cabin. His gaze had already sharpened, and was completely different from before.

Taking control of the Azure Pond Sect wasn’t just a matter for the Si Family, it was Si Yuanli’s own chance at the Purple Mansion Realm! Never had his resolve been so ironclad. He brushed the curtain aside, his face now sorrowful and eyes reddened as he stepped out to greet them.

Li Qinghong was personally waiting by the lake. Si Yuanli quickly saw that all the Li Family’s Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had arrived, showing him due respect. Si Yuanli truly felt some grief and regret over Li Xuanfeng’s death; there was no need for him to feign emotion. His expression was naturally sincere.

Brother Xuanfeng fought to the end to protect the millions of Jiangnan... It is a deep and sorrowful loss... thought Si Yuanli.

Si Yuanli landed on the peak and first glanced at Li Ximing. Though the man had abundant mana, there was nothing exceptional about him. His focus shifted to the graceful and poised Li Xizhi, quietly assessing, This one has the backing of both the Yang and Li Families, with deep cultivation and clear judgment. Chi Zhiyun favored him heavily back then, and I saw through it early on... Fortunately, Chi Zhiyan has already exhausted himself with foolish blunders.




# Chapter 889: Submission

Si Yuanli entered the mountain with a stern expression on his face and noticed that every family had sent people to the lake. However, aside from several obscure small families he had never heard of, only the Fei Family’s contingent was somewhat presentable.

However, the Fei Family members were being exceedingly humble, seemingly not having fared well in recent years. Si Yuanli sighed inwardly at the sight and didn’t spare them another glance.

Everyone bowed as a chorus of voices respectfully called out, "Greetings, Emissary!"

Under the watchful eyes of all, Li Xijun brought out the talisman and placed it flat on a jade plate so every clan could see it clearly. Li Qinghong received it first and said softly, "The Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman is here. We will return it to you first, Senior."

Si Yuanli sighed as he accepted the talisman, secretly inspecting it closely. He circulated his mana through it twice and confirmed it was genuine. He said apologetically, "Brother Xuanfeng stepped forward to preserve Jiangnan for my Azure Pond Sect. It is an unprecedented merit. Your family also suffered great losses of vital qi in this struggle; I have seen it all..."

His words were vague, but Li Qinghong shook her head and replied, "Before my second uncle perished, he said that Daoist Master Yuan Xiu saved him from Maha's hands, and prevented the traitor Tang from being offered to the Merciful One. He not only preserved the lord's life but also safeguarded our family's security. The favor is immense; fulfilling our duty is only right."

The two had not had much prior contact, and Li Qinghong had only spoken a single sentence when he had come to persuade them. Now that both had exchanged pleasantries, she feared Si Yuanli might say more about stepping forward.

So she lightly stepped aside and said softly, "Please."

Si Yuanli nodded, rode the clouds through the formation, glanced over Mount Qingdu, and said with a smile, "The immortal peak is serene, and isolated in the lake. It’s a fine place for cultivation."

Although Mount Qingdu was fairly decent among the peaks of Moongaze Lake, it was rather unimpressive in the eyes of a Purple Mansion Realm immortal descendant like Si Yuanli. He managed to force out a compliment before heading toward White Gauze Hall.

Everyone waited outside the hall as he went in to pay respects to Li Xuanfeng. When he came out, he wore a deeply sorrowful expression. A trusted aide of the Si Family stepped forward to support him, and the middle-aged man sighed, "The sect has suffered a major loss of vital qi, and now Xuanfeng is dead. The sect master is in seclusion, with no sign of when he’ll emerge. You and I held the demons at bay along the riverbanks, but we didn’t expect Chi Zhiyan and the others to vanish. Now we return with our people, yet we have no idea what to do next."

Si Yuanli’s time was indeed extremely limited; he could not afford to linger. As soon as the rites were complete, he immediately began to speak. The members of the Li Family all lowered their heads in silence, as if they hadn’t heard a thing.

Only Li Xizhi spoke softly, "You overthink things, my lord. Your achievements are clear to me and the other peak masters. With Master Yuan Xiu suppressing the sect, no petty man would dare stir trouble. Now that you return, all that remains is to reward merits and achievements..."

He exhaled and said solemnly, "As for matters of the upper sect and immortals, they should not be revealed before the noble clans. I ask that the Li Family be excused."
𝘧𝓇𝑒𝑒𝑤ℯ𝑏𝓃𝘰𝑣ℯ𝘭.𝘤ℴ𝘮

Li Xizhi’s words made Si Yuanli pause for a moment before he sighed. "You all stood with me defending the riverbank. We share the bond of comrades in arms... There’s no need for such formality..."

Li Xizhi, of course, refused and cupped his hands respectfully, "In times of sect unrest, you have returned triumphant. Though your prestige is well-earned, favoritism is inappropriate. We must still abide by the rules."

What a joke! The Li Family’s Foundation Establishment Realm strength was now ranked among the top families, and they had considerable achievements to their name. How could they possibly throw their entire family under Si Yuanli’s command just like that...?

Admittedly, the Li Family and Si Yuanli were naturally aligned in position, but the man had been on the lakeshore for less than fifteen minutes and hadn’t offered a single benefit. Li Xizhi had already shown enough goodwill and courtesy.

Si Yuanli was merely making a gesture; he had never expected others to pledge their entire households just because he spoke a few words. He walked out of the hall with Li Xizhi, saying warmly, "Xizhi, your cultivation has advanced swiftly. You once governed the marketplace and managed Green Pine Island, I’ve heard of your name long ago. It’s just a pity... alas... even Qingsui Peak has long voiced grievances on your behalf!"

Li Xizhi cupped his hands and replied, "Many thanks, my lord... But Qingsui Peak originally belonged to the Yuan Family. The sect had its reasons for arranging things as it did. The sect master compensated me with Changtian Peak, so consider it balanced."

"Oh?" Si Yuanli paused and glanced at Li Xizhi.

The elegant young man was composed as he said softly, "The Yuan Family, after all, is an ancient family with a long legacy, and has had ties with my family since the early days. In the end, it’s all about interests. There’s no need for conflict or enmity."

His words carried a subtle implication, stirring something in Si Yuanli’s heart. Stroking his beard, he thought to himself, It seems the Li and Yuan Families haven’t become completely hostile yet...

He’s right... How much favor has the Yuan Family really received from the Chi Family? They may lack standout figures, but the Mushroom Forest Plain is larger than an entire province. If we can draw them in along with the Li Family, that’s far better than making them enemies.

His eyes lit up, and he looked at Li Xizhi with newfound appreciation, thinking, A family that rose from such a harsh land within barely a century, with strict upbringing—of course they’d produce talented heirs... Good, good... this Li Xizhi will save me quite a bit of trouble!

Just as he was about to offer praise, a streak of light rapidly flew in from the distance. Only when it drew close did he see it was his own junior, Si Tongyi. The Li Family opened the formation to let him in. Si Tongyi landed beside him and stepped close, sending a whisper through a secret sound-transmission technique.

Si Tongyi’s lone arrival already made Si Yuanli’s expression shift slightly, but the words that followed made him turn grim, Li Yuanqin isn’t in Yi Mountain City... Chi Fubo has also vanished. Ning Hejing has mobilized all forces from Yuanxing Peak. I tried to fly over with the cloudliner, but he seized control of the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner...

If not for Yuanxing Peak being understaffed due to years of inactivity, I might not have been able to leave the Azure Pond Sect at all... I fear we can’t afford any more delay!

"Ning Hejing..." muttered Si Yuanli.

The Chi Family had six branches. The brothers Chi Zhiyan and Chi Zhiyun were born of Chi Wei’s main line and were Purple Mansion Realm immortal descendants. They were always considered prime candidates for the sect master position. Meanwhile, Chi Fubo, whom Li Yuanqin was close to, belonged to the secondary branch, which, while competent, was not as strong.

Only those two lines had ancestors who reached the Purple Mansion Realm. The other four were not worth fearing. However, the main branch had nearly been wiped out in the north. Si Yuanli’s face grew darker as he listened.

Standing beside him, Li Xizhi seemed to sense something and said softly, "Since your lordship has finished the rites, it’s unwise to linger. Allow me to accompany you back to the sect and report in."

"Very well." Si Yuanli let out a deep breath, not even sparing time to bid farewell to Li Qinghong and the others, and said gravely, "With Xuanfeng’s passing, his great merits must be honored. I will return to the sect and deliberate on it thoroughly."

Several of them boarded the cloudliner and activated it with mana. They left streaks of white mist in the sky as they sped southward under the gaze of the crowd. The other peak masters followed behind and soon disappeared into the distance.

Si Yuanli had departed in such haste that he stayed for less than fifteen minutes. Li Xijun watched the large group of cultivators depart, silent and contemplative as his fingers rested on his sword hilt.

Li Qinghong moved to face him, and the young man spoke in a cool voice, "Aunt, the men we sent to fetch Uncle Yuanqin will likely return empty-handed."

He had immediately deduced from Si Yuanli’s unceremonious departure that something had almost certainly gone wrong at the Azure Pond Sect. No matter how fast the Li family moved, they couldn’t outrun the Si Family, and the result would inevitably be failure.

"The Azure Pond Sect reacts quickly."

Li Qinghong did the math. Though the demonic smoke in Jiangbei was slowly dissipating, the jade talismans tied to the lives of their guest cultivators had not yet shattered. The Azure Pond Sect’s soul lamps might be far more refined, but couldn’t be much faster.

It would have taken ten days for Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators to travel from the riverbank to Mount Azure Pond with intermittent flying. An ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would need three days without rest, relying on pills to recover. Even the fastest escape spell user among the Li family, Li Qinghong, would still need a full day.

The message brought by the Si Family was at least a day old, meaning the Azure Pond Sect had taken action the day after, or even the same day, that Li Xuanfeng had slaughtered the Buddhist cultivators. In a world without transmission spells, that kind of speed was terrifying.

"Chi Zhiyun might have made arrangements." Li Xijun speculated briefly, then shook his head, "No matter what he planned, he couldn't have predicted things would deteriorate to this level... The last Purple Mansion Realm battle was at Moongaze Lake four hundred years ago."

The aunt and nephew returned to the peak, where Li Ximing was reading a letter. His brows had relaxed slightly. He placed the letter on the table and said, "Aunt, the Fei Family has arrived in full and is waiting respectfully at the riverside, requesting an audience."

"Hmm?"

Li Ximing’s words made Li Qinghong slightly raise an eyebrow. Li Ximing straightened his Daoist robe and met Li Xijun’s inquiring gaze, then nodded. "Almost certainly."

The three of them flew out together, and sure enough, they saw a densely packed crowd on the lakeshore. As the three descended from the sky, men and women alike lowered their heads and fell to their knees en masse with a rustle.

Li Qinghong landed at the front and saw an elderly man leading the group. His face was covered in ghastly bruises of a purplish hue, and his left hand was missing three fingers.

Upon seeing the trio, he bowed deeply and said respectfully, "Fei Tongyu of the Fei Family greets the three lords!"

Li Qinghong naturally recognized him from when she had trained in spear techniques at the Fei Family in her youth. Back then, Fei Tongyu had been elegant and refined. When she visited again after she had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he had already begun to show signs of age.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

Now, however, he looked startlingly horrific. Li Qinghong was taken aback but quickly understood the source of his injuries. Though he was indecisive, he had always been devoted to the family. Naturally, he wouldn’t have hidden behind the younger generation; he must have gone north himself.

Fei Tongyu bowed deeply, lifting his scar-covered hands high. He held up a jade plate that displayed a green seal and a storage pouch.

He said respectfully, "The Fei Family of Northern Shore Glacial Cloud, humbly prays for your grace and earnestly requests to become a subordinate household."

As Fei Tongyu knelt, the crowd behind him echoed his words loudly and in unison, "We humbly request to become a subordinate household!"

The shoreline erupted with thunderous voices, shaking the waters of the lake into turbulent waves. Members of other families looked up as three figures floated in the sky, Lightning flashed around the central figure, radiant brilliance to the left, and drifting frost and snow to the right.

Someone murmured softly, "Truly the bearing of an esteemed family."

"The Li Family's Foundation Establishment Realm strength has already surpassed the Jiang Family of old. This lake ought to bear the Li name now."

Within the mirror.

"Three strands of Metallic Essence; Mount Changhuai took one, Zipei took one, and one escaped."

The world remained calm, but a great battle raged on in Anhuai Heaven. Lu Jiangxian stood aside, watching everything clearly.

Mount Changhuai had dispatched four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. As the strongest faction, they rightfully took one portion. The three Buddhist cultivators and Mahas had tied each other up in battle, giving Zhelu a chance to seize it. But as Zhelu emerged from Anhuai Heaven, he was promptly ambushed by Zipei, who had been lying in wait.

Zhelu clearly could have escaped with the Metallic Essence, but Anhuai Heaven’s formation was designed to target Buddhist cultivators. Getting in was already troublesome, and getting out even worse. Zhelu was then besieged by the other two Mahas and, caught between advance and retreat, had no choice but to surrender the treasure.

The final portion of Metallic Essence became the most fiercely contested among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. However, through a twist of fate, it ended up in the hands of Daoist Master Chengyan of Changxiao Gate, who was only in the early Purple Mansion Realm.

Though he had stepped into the Purple Mansion Realm years ago, he had made no progress since, spending his days in seclusion cultivating a single divine ability. How could he dare hold onto this hot potato? There was no joy in his heart, only fear...

Though his family's Daoist Master Changxiao was formidable, he had not come to Anhuai Heaven. Chengyan himself was not from some prestigious immortal family. When he saw the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators closing in on him, he gritted his teeth and sent the Metallic Essence beyond Anhuai Heaven. He would rid himself of the hot potato, and hope that Changxiao might be waiting in the Outer Heavens.

The moment he did this, the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators began cursing aloud, and they were forced to rush to the Outer Heavens to fight for it. Everyone except for the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master Hengli of the Hengzhu Dao Gate, who turned back to chase after Chengyan, swarmed outward.

Someone even cursed bitterly, "This is a disaster!"

But Chengyan had calculated correctly, Changxiao was indeed waiting in the Outer Heavens. Overjoyed at the sight, he was about to unleash his divine ability when suddenly a black alms bowl flew across and blocked him.

The Metallic Essence moved with such incredible speed that Changxiao missed it by a hair’s breadth. Once the True Essence, the Metallic Essence left Anhuai Heaven, it began to transform. At first, it was just a treasure being pursued by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. After a few seconds, it expanded within the great void, turning into a radiant, shining golden stone.

Half of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators turned and fled immediately. The rest, either confident in their strength or clinging to hope, refused to give up. After another dozen seconds, the Metallic Essence transformed into a stone bird. It turned around and absorbed one early stage Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master. Already spent and drained of his divine powers, the Daoist Master was caught off guard and devoured in a single gulp.

And so, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators could only scatter in all directions, curses against Daoist Master Chengyan erupting from all sides. Meanwhile, the stone bird, having developed a taste for flesh, turned around, laughing wildly, to chase and devour more people. Fortunately, the creature was clearly unnatural. After licking its beak in lingering hunger, it soon vanished.

Lu Jiangxian thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle. Once he returned to the mirror world and fell into deep thought, he took out the Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence and pondered silently, If this thing were to descend into the world, it would surely be something terrifying... That Daoist Master Chengyan of Changxiao Gate probably won’t dare show his face for the next hundred years.

Standing among the clouds, he suddenly raised his head as if sensing something. The layered mists parted in the sky, and a sparkling stream of light flew toward him from afar, coming to rest before him.

The talisman seed glimmered faintly with golden light. He picked it up, finding the mana within it to be extremely thin. It was barely at Qi Cultivation Realm.

"Xuanfeng..."

Li Xuanfeng had expended nearly all his cultivation, leaving little behind. Yet in contrast, the talisman seed was filled with an incredibly dense and alluring store of fate, all tightly bound within it.

When Li Xuanfeng had taken the Human Pill, the talisman seed should have extracted all his cultivation and detached itself. But Lu Jiangxian had forcibly suppressed it. During the battle on the riverbank, when Li Xuanfeng drew on mana, it was Lu Jiangxian again who restrained the talisman seed, allowing him to accomplish his task and then retreat.

Upon Li Xuanfeng’s death, his fate should have dissipated with him. But talisman seeds had never followed reason. They wouldn’t yield what they didn’t want to, yet when taking, they took everything. It had consumed all his fate and brought it back into the mirror.

Lu Jiangxian silently gazed at the talisman seed, sighing inwardly, He had resolved to die long ago!

Li Xuanfeng had already made his resolution to die the moment he took the Human Pill. He had simply been waiting for the right moment. He simply wanted to take down a few more enemies before he fell.

"Taking Eighteen Master Monks with him... that fulfilled a hero’s ambition," muttered Lu Jiangxian.

He held the fate-rich talisman seed but did not absorb it into himself immediately. Instead, he hesitated.

There was no other reason. The mirror was currently stuck at this stage. Without a breakthrough into the Purple Mansion Realm and feedback from his divine ability, it would only slightly enhance the strength of his profound light at most.

"That would be far too wasteful," muttered Lu Jiangxian.




# Chapter 891: Scheme

Lu Jiangxian had read the memories of several major Buddhist cultivators and possessed dozens of Buddhist cultivation techniques, but he had never practiced them himself. His own cultivation experience came from the Li Family members after their pill condensation and had nothing to do with the Buddhist Dao.

As a result, Lu Jiangxian's understanding of fate was limited to the Five-Eyed technique. His old shortcut of shaping humanoid figures out of mana for cultivation had no effect when it came to fate. Mana could circulate freely, but how could fate be anchored to a mere clump of energy?

Lu Jiangxian did not yet feed the strand of fate into the mirror. Instead, he summoned the soul of Dangjiang, who still appeared dazed and disoriented, having been sealed ever since being drawn out of Buzi’s body.

"When the time is right, this fellow can be put to use. For now, I’ll keep this fate strand in reserve."

He looked up as he suddenly sensed something. The Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence was emitting a faint glow. A scene of a sea island covered in palaces and pavilions, with cultivators moving to and fro, slowly unfolded.

A stone gate on the island slowly closed. Inside the cave dwelling, a youth sat cross-legged, his body radiating bright light that illuminated the chamber in clear brilliance.

"Li Zhouwei is in seclusion, breaking through to Foundation Establishment Realm."

In the great void, Lu Jiangxian had seen how the Tianwu True Essence and Divine Fiend could turn into monstrous evils. Even without mutation, ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivators struggled to suppress the Metallic Essence. But the Metallic Essence in Li Zhouwei's body had been personally bound by Lu Jiangxian using high-grade immortal arts, so it caused little disturbance.

But Lu Jiangxian had also seen Li Zhouwei’s eldest son, Li Jiang’ao. Li Jiang’ao’s current condition was already considered mild, but it was in large part due to his constant maintenance and suppression...

"The Bright Yang lineage often produces many sons. The eldest tends to be fierce, and the second cruel. The ones most affected are always the first and second sons. If my calculations are right, the court politics of the Wei's Li lineage will be quite bloody. The battle between the legitimate heir and the second son won’t be a simple one, especially since both are born with divine anomalies."

Li Zhouwei’s current inherent rank was far from ordinary. According to Lu Jiangxian’s calculations, Li Jiang’ao might even transform into some monstrous entity like the Red-Eyed White Cicada or the Gold-Eyed White Qilin. That was why Lu Jiangxian had kept a close watch on him since his birth.

"Fortunately... whether due to the decline of Wei's Li lineage, or because Li Zhouwei’s fate was personally crafted by me, Li Jiang’ao is merely inhuman, nothing worse."

Lu Jiangxian had kept an eye on them for several months before slowly shifting his attention, Once he has more sons, the trouble will lessen. It’s merely a matter of temperament being affected. His cultivation progress could accelerate by several degrees with more wives and children.

As for reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, Li Zhouwei has learned a secret art and should have over a seventy percent chance. If he can obtain a Bright Yang spirit item, his chances will be even higher.

As his perspective broadened, Lu Jiangxian no longer concerned himself much with the Seven Dharma Forms of the Buddhist cultivators or the various immortal sects of Wu and Yue. His only worries now were Mount Luoxia and the Underworld, both Dao Embryo level powers within the mainland. Each move of a piece took years of deliberation, and he dared not act rashly.

The fact that these two Immortal Mansion level forces had yet to reveal their whereabouts only made them more fearsome.

Moongaze Lake.
𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝒆𝓵.𝓬𝓸𝒎

Li Qinghong stood upon lightning before the eyes of all, floating in the air while all members of the Fei Family kept their heads lowered. She descended lightly, her voice gentle yet loud enough to pierce the heavens.

“Fellow Daoist, what is the meaning of this? Please, rise quickly.”

Fei Tongyu naturally refused to rise, but violet lightning had already lifted him off the ground. Li Qinghong said softly, “My second uncle and your family’s forebears were close friends, while our families have been allies for generations. How did it come to this? Our elder perished guarding the riverbank, but gratitude is not meant to be repaid with the annexation of another’s family.”

She took a jade box from her storage pouch and handed it to Fei Tongyu, speaking gently, “This box contains Renewal Spirit Pills refined by Ximing. Please take good care of your health. Qingyi is still in seclusion in the Azure Pond Sect, preparing for her breakthrough. Her future holds great promise...”

The woman turned to the side and gave an order, “Xijun, have someone escort them back to the north shore.”

“Yes.” Li Xijun had already made preparations and helped Fei Tongyu descend. Only after Li Qinghong and Li Ximing landed on Mount Qingdu did the onlooking families finally avert their gaze and disperse.

Now standing atop the mountain, Li Ximing sighed and said, “Fei Qingyi hasn’t left seclusion for years... the Fei Family must truly be at the end of their rope.”

In recent years, the Li Family had grown ever more dominant, and the Fei Family’s tenuous hold on the northern shore had relied entirely on Fei Qingyi. But the woman had been in seclusion for years without a word. When Li Xuanfeng had slaughtered the Buddhist cultivators, the Fei Family could no longer hold on.

Li Qinghong replied, “Since he’s made such a public declaration, it won’t be long before he sends his direct descendants. Have Xijun begin making arrangements.”

Since the Azure Pond Sect was now in turmoil, it was indeed an opportune time to consolidate power over the lake. Fei Tongyu had clearly surrendered willingly, but the power gap between the Li Family and the Fei Family had grown enormous. The other esteemed families, especially the Si and Chi Families, would not see it the same way.

Such a grand and public display made the Li Family appear domineering and ambitious. Though Li Qinghong had formally refused Fei Tongyu’s submission, with the Li Family’s current strength and influence, whether or not the Fei Family became vassals was simply a matter of nodding their heads.

"Fei Qingyi is, after all, an uncertain variable."

Li Ximing stood with his arms crossed, tilting his head slightly as Li Xijun entered the hall. The younger man was striking in appearance, and his arrival through the drifting snow brought a sudden brightness to the great hall.

When he heard his elder brother’s words, Li Xijun casually remarked, "Fei Tongyu has improved quite a bit."

When Li Ximing looked over, the young man replied, "The unrest at Chengshui Tomb hasn’t been fully accounted for. Si Yuanli will surely settle accounts with the Tang Family to win popular support. Fei Qingyi is from Yuanwu Peak; whether she’s implicated or not is just a matter of a single word."

He had always seen clearly through political currents. Hugging his sword to his chest, he said softly, "He deliberately chose to make a move in full view of all, so everyone would see clearly—oh? The Fei Family now belongs to the Li Family! That precious daughter of theirs obviously has no ties to the Tang Family anymore."

Li Qinghong, knowing how calculative he always was, listened closely and nodded in agreement. "That was indeed a clever move. Even if I had refused, I would still have had to say a few polite words.

"Nothing comes without a price. The northern shore now belongs to us. The southern shore has spirit items, the east has spirit fields, and the north is rich in spirit ores. With this piece in place, our shortage of dharma artifacts can finally be resolved."

Li Xijun lifted his head, a trace of nostalgia in his expression, and replied, "Years ago, Uncle Ping asked me about our family. I answered, the Li family on the lake, with offices around the peaks. Now, forty years have passed, and the great lake has finally come into our hands."

Li Ximing lowered his brows slightly at these words, and Li Qinghong immediately added in a quiet voice, "Now only Daoist He on the western shore remains."

It was rather interesting, as Daoist He, a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, was rumored to have ties within Azure Pond Sect. He had never needed to pay tribute to the Azure Pond Sect. In the Li Family's hundred years along the lakeside, the man had never shown himself even once.

Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators lived no more than three hundred years, and he had been gone for over a hundred. Though long renowned, his lifespan was clearly running short.

After some thought, Li Qinghong replied, "I heard he was a close friend of someone within the sect back then, which is why no one on the lake dared provoke him. He’s always been preoccupied with his own affairs...”

Li Ximing replied, "Nowadays, aside from Daoist Master Yuan Xiu, who else counts as well-connected? If his old friend was among those Foundation Establishment Realm elders who once broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, they’ve likely passed away by now!"

Li Xijun nodded slightly, saying softly, "Why don’t we wait a few months, settle things at home, and then Aunt and I can pay him a visit together. In the meantime, I’ll write a letter and ask our elder brother about it."

"Mm." Li Qinghong responded softly, and Li Xijun took the opportunity to add quietly, "Speaking of this matter, the sect is complicated, and our elder brother doesn’t have anyone truly loyal at his side. I was thinking of sending Senior Wushao to assist him..."

Li Xijun always spoke with polish and logical clarity. Since Li Wushao had once pledged loyalty to Li Yuanjiao, and with Li Yuexiang now deceased, it was indeed proper for him to follow Li Xizhi.

Li Qinghong nodded and said, "His foundation is already solid. We can reward him with a treasured panacea for his recent contribution. Let him head to the Azure Pond Sect and use the opportunity to break through to the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm."

The Azure Pond Sect.

The immortal formations were brightly lit, while all the peaks were sealed off except for Yuanxing Peak, where people bustled about. The mountain was nearly entirely forged from golden iron, adorned with thousands of iron pillars linked by iron chains. It was a rather grim and intimidating view.

Yet in the main hall atop the peak, its master stood with a spear in hand, brow furrowed with deep anxiety.

Ning Hejing had received the news early. Chi Zhiyun had never truly trusted his brother Chi Zhiyan. While he didn’t believe Chi Zhiyan would recklessly squander all their forces, he feared that his subordinates might lie to him. So he had secretly placed informants in several locations.
𝘧𝓇ℯ𝑒𝓌𝑒𝑏𝓃𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝒸ℴ𝓂

When Li Xuanfeng crushed the Buddhist cultivators and the north fell silent, a specialized courier flew back from the riverbank. He had used talismans and all his mana to barely make it to the city’s market. Upon collapsing, a second messenger immediately took over. The relay labored nonstop day and night, until the message finally reached Ning Hejing by the next day.

"Killed all eighteen monks? Are you kidding me!?"

Ning Hejing’s entire attention was on Li Xuanfeng, his mind filled with that terrifying feat. He began to sense things had gone awry at Mount Bianyan. Initially, he thought nothing of it. Chi Zhiyan had a Purple Mansion Realm talisman, and could even traverse the great void. What could mere devil cultivators do to him? At worst, he would suffer a few casualties.

But Chi Zhiyun had left orders to seize control of the Heavenly Glow Cloudship, seal off all peaks, and summon all members of the Chi Family back to Azure Pond Peak. It felt like overkill, but Ning Hejing, afraid of punishment should Chi Zhiyun emerge from seclusion, went along with it.

Then came the second message. No word from Mount Bianyan, and Li Xuanfeng was dead. Ning Hejing felt some relief, but sensed something off. On the third morning, the soul lamps on Azure Pond Peak, once a sea of purple, snuffed out like candles in the wind. Only a few remained. Even Chi Zhiyan’s soul lamp had extinguished. Ning Hejing was stunned for a full half-minute.

"How is this possible!?"

He turned to check the green soul lamps on the other side; they were completely gone. Only a handful of cultivators who had stayed behind in the sect had survived.

Now seated in the grand hall, Ning Hejing felt cold to the bone. He sat silently at the head of the room, before a crowd of cultivators. Most of them were aged and speaking in wavering tones, their voices rising and falling in discord.

His heart burned with frustration, but he didn’t dare scold this group from the Chi Family. Instead, he restrained himself and asked quietly, "My lords, Si Yuanli must already be on his way back. Do any of you have thoughts on what we should do?"

Yet most of those below merely looked on coldly, keeping their distance. Ning Hejing took them all in, and though fury surged to his head, his expression did not change.

The core figures of the Chi Family’s first lineage had perished at Mount Bianyan. Those from that line who remained here had no voice in decision-making. The rest were from the second lineage, and harbored long-held resentment. Now they looked on with barely concealed schadenfreude.

Ning Hejing knew these pampered, idle old wastrels were no good. If they had any real ability, they wouldn’t have aged into obscurity without gaining a single post. But even he hadn’t expected them to be this foolish. His heart went cold, Si Yuanli’s actions have already doomed Chi Zhiyan. Why would he rush back now with any goodwill in mind? You all still bear the surname Chi; honor and disgrace are shared! How can you just stand by and watch!?

He was both furious and afraid, but fortunately, not all of the second lineage elders were useless. A few remained silent in deep thought, though these old foxes still held their tongues and merely waited in silence.

Scanning the hall, Ning Hejing noticed only two remained standing in front, both silent but visibly anxious. He recognized the one in front as Chi Fubo, the eldest direct descendant of the Chi Family's second lineage, a formidable figure.

Ning Hejing quickly spoke up, "Fubo! What’s your view on this?"

Chi Fubo’s expression was dark as he replied, "Uncle Hejing! Bianyan was a trap laid by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators! Anhuai Heaven was designed specifically to strike at our Chi Family!"

His words brought a hush over the hall. Chi Fubo was well-regarded among the second lineage, and most gave him due respect.

Ning Hejing could only sigh. "Of course I know! But Si Yuanli is nearly here, so how could I possibly refuse him at the gates? Once he enters the sect, with Daoist Master Buzi missing and Daoist Master Yuan Xiu absent, the Azure Pond Sect will be his to command!"

Ning Hejing, stationed on Yuanxing Peak, had once overseen Si Yuanbai. When Si Yuanli had visited multiple times, he had dismissed him as a nobody. With the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator’s ban in place, he had left him out in the cold. Now, if Si Yuanli took over sect affairs, he would surely place his own family in charge of Yuanxing Peak. Between personal enmity and political rivalry, Ning Hejing’s fate would be bleak.

Though Chi Buzi was merely missing, not confirmed dead, though Yuan Xiu had always been friendly toward the Chi Family, though Si Yuanli usually kept a low profile, Ning Hejing still didn’t trust him. Even if Si Yuanli didn’t dare act recklessly, Ning Hejing still had to push the issue for his own safety.

He quickly whispered to Chi Fubo, "Si Yuanli is a wolf with wild ambition. With the sect master in seclusion and the main seat vacant, he won’t let the chance slip by. If the Si Family takes over and the main family is weakened, both the Chi and Ning Families are sure to be pushed aside..."

By sheer luck, his warning struck a chord. But Chi Fubo was no fool; he was ambitious too. He responded quietly, "You’re right, Uncle Hejing... But what can we do now? He’s returning in triumph, and our forces are nearly gone. What can we even say?"

Their conversation left both men frowning, anxiety thick in their hearts. Ning Hejing said, "Daoist Buzi’s soul lamp is still lit! There are countless strange places in the world... Who’s to say it’s not some fate-distorting realm?"

After exchanging thoughts, both became increasingly unsettled by Si Yuanli’s rapid return. Chi Fubo immediately turned to gather a few senior members, clearing the great hall of the rest and leaving only trusted insiders.

After reviewing everything again, Chi Fubo exclaimed in alarm, "If Daoist Master Buzi is truly gone, the first lineage is finished, and the other families are full of resentment. If Daoist Master Yuan Xiu harbors any intention, how could the Azure Pond Sect possibly remain under the Chi Family!?"

"But Daoist Master Yuan Xiu is closest to our Chi family!" A white-haired elder nearby spoke softly. It was Chi Buhua, the eldest of the Chi Family’s second lineage, his face full of hesitation and disbelief.

His voice echoed through the hall, but as he spoke, even he began to doubt himself. To the others, it sounded almost mocking. Chi Fubo’s face darkened, his fists clenched pale.

A horrified Ning Hejing slowly lifted his head, his face cast in shadow as he rasped, "The heart of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator... who can truly fathom it?"




# Chapter 893: Uncle And Nephew

Chi Fubo felt a chill run through in his heart at those words. His gaze swept around and landed on the young man behind him, who was silent with his head lowered.

He asked, "Yuanqin! What do you think..."

The young man behind him had sharp, long eyebrows and slightly narrow eyes. His expression was gloomy, his pupils grayish-black, his cheeks gaunt, and his aura dark. He was dressed in luxurious robes. It was none other than Li Yuanqin, son of Li Xuanfeng.

Li Yuanqin appeared momentarily dazed, with only one thought echoing inside, He’s dead?! How is that possible?!

The news that Li Xuanfeng had slaughtered the entire host of Buddhist cultivators came first, shocking the Azure Pond Sect disciples so much they thought it was a false rumor. Naturally, Li Yuanqin became the center of attention, but he didn’t care. Every time a battle report about Li Xuanfeng came in, it was always like this. He had long grown used to it.

But when news of Li Xuanfeng’s death spread the next day, all the cultivators breathed a sigh of relief. Though Ning Hejing stayed behind closed doors, Li Yuanqin knew this dear uncle of his was overjoyed. Some members of the Chi Family even laughed aloud; Li Yuanqin staying secluded was already a sign of restraint.

Although Chi Fubo had come to offer his condolences immediately, even with reddened eyes, Li Yuanqin had known him for many years, so how could he not know this man’s true nature? Even if he was not gleeful, he was at least relieved.

Li Yuanqin showed no change in expression. In fact, his heart felt empty. His confusion outweighed his grief, He’s dead? Even he could die?

That hollowness left him restless and uneasy, but fortunately, he had always been reserved and deep-minded. No one could see the slightest trace on his face. He drank when it was time to drink, and laughed when it was time to laugh.

Now, he calmly watched everyone panic with cold eyes. Not even Chi Zhiyan’s death stirred any emotion in him. His mind was blank, and facing Chi Fubo’s question, he thought for a moment.

But Ning Hejing leapt to his feet. This uncle didn’t even recognize his own nephew at first. It was only upon hearing the name that he reacted.

He bristled, letting out a grunt as he rose from his seat, glaring coldly. What kind of mess has Chi Fubo gotten us into now?!

Ning Hejing certainly knew that Li Yuanqin was close to the Chi Family, but in his heart, he didn’t trust Li Yuanqin at all. His study of the Li Family was thorough, to the point he held Yuanqin in contempt, The Li Family are ruthless and suspicious, as well as domineering and cruel. Yet they are also loyal and fraternal, willing to die for each other. They are the most venomous wolves! Li Xuanfeng was one, and so is Li Yuanjiao...

The only thing he truly resented about Yuan Su was overusing Li Xuanfeng, along with the nauseating Ning Heyuan who followed him, shamelessly calling him brother-in-law. Now that Ning Heyuan was dead, well, he was still a fellow clansman, so there was nothing more to say. But when it came to his nephew Li Yuanqin, he had absolutely no trust.

As for Li Yuanqin? Don't even think about it! He’s obviously pretending! People like him are cruel and cunning by nature. They’re skilled in manipulating hearts. That boy is born wicked, how could anyone trust him?

Even if, by some stretch, Li Yuanqin was one of them, what right did he have to be here? To put it nicely, he was a nephew. But bluntly, he was Li-blooded filth! His very lineage was tainted; he shouldn’t even be allowed inside this hall!

The truth was, he was Li Xuanfeng’s orphan. Li Xuanfeng had achieved much on the surface, which made him difficult to touch. Otherwise, Ning Hejing would have taken him down long ago!

He could no longer bear the sight of Li Yuanqin in front of him and said coldly, "So it’s you! Your father’s achievements were so grand!"

The words were laced with malice, immediately snapping the youth to alertness. His gaze lingered on his uncle’s face for a beat before Ning Hejing snarled, "Get out at once!!"

"Hey..." Chi Fubo had seen firsthand what Li Yuanqin was capable of. He hurriedly held Ning Hejing back and tugged at Li Yuanqin’s sleeve.

The young man slowly lowered his head and said softly, "My lord... Si Yuanli held the riverbank, forcing my father to stay there and defend it. He wagered his life just to protect the great river... But Si Yuanli and the Si Family elites clearly had Purple Mansion Realm talismans and methods, yet refused to use them! They watched my father die without lifting a hand."

His words startled everyone. Li Yuanqin’s narrow eyes brimmed with tears as he cried and said, "Si Yuanli now treats the rewards issued along the riverbank as property of the Si Family, and is using them to win over the esteemed families. He’s clearly planning something big... With Daoist Master Yuan Xiu absent, he’s acting entirely on his own... We cannot allow the families to blindly follow his reckless commands..."

"This..." Ning Hejing’s expression froze on his face. He quickly ran the situation through in his mind, thinking, That’s right... The Si Family may be strong, but Yuan Xiu hasn’t shown himself. Without him, they’re just another group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... If we can unite the noble clans, perhaps they’re not so frightening after all...

Li Yuanqin carries weight in name, and the words will only have effect if they come from his mouth. He holds high seniority within the Li Family; his voice could be used to rally their forces...

Though Ning Hejing’s personal strength wasn’t extraordinary, he had managed Yuanxing Peak for many years. His gaze was sharp and his mind calculating; he wasn’t a simple man. How could he not grasp this point?

Though he was deeply unwilling, he could only keep silent for now and listen. Chi Fubo’s eyes were practically glowing, and he nodded repeatedly. "My lords, as long as Daoist Master Yuan Xiu doesn’t take action himself, what can Si Yuanli really do? Will he truly lead the Si Family’s elites into an all-out war against us?

"He just wants more power. We already hold the upper seats. So what if his reputation is at its apex right now? Must every peak master obey Si Yuanli?"

Li Yuanqin nodded but did not say much more. At this moment, any word of persuasion would be ill-timed. No one present was a fool, they would all come to their own conclusions.

Sure enough, an elder of the second lineage, Chi Zhihu, slowly showed signs of being moved. His voice was quietly pensive, "The first lineage’s forces are nearly spent, but no one among us in the second lineage holds truly high authority. There's only Hejing, and all he has is Yuanxing Peak... In the end, we’re just humble Daoists..."

Li Yuanqin bowed respectfully and said in a soft voice, "My lords... the sect master has already issued a command. It rests in Lord Hejing’s hands."

Li Yuanqin’s smooth and unhurried words echoed through the empty great hall. He had voiced what several of them were secretly thinking. The Chi Family members all looked visibly pleased, except for Ning Hejing, whose expression turned dark.

He raised a hand to halt them and said coldly, "Li Yuanqin, I don’t trust you."

Those few words echoed through the great hall. He narrowed his eyes slightly and spoke in a low voice, "You play the role well, but all things are driven by profit. What do you gain from this, hmm? Hatred for Li Xuanfeng? What a joke!"

He stepped down from the upper seat, expression icy and his tone even colder. "The discord between the first and second branches has long existed, but surely you played your part for this generation’s split to be so severe. You Li Family people are vicious, ruthless, treacherous, and cunning."

The man’s eyes were razor-sharp, and even glinted with killing intent. He walked right up to his nephew. He spoke coldly through gritted teeth, "A person like you is hard to deal with. I’m stationed far from the sect, so naturally I haven’t caught any of your misdeeds.

"But Chi Fuju being repeatedly punished, even drawing the sect master’s displeasure, that was your doing, wasn’t it? You’ve been sowing discord all these years, haven’t you?"




# Chapter 894: Returning To The Heart Of The Lake

The remark hadn’t caused any visible reaction from Li Yuanqin yet, but Chi Fubo’s expression had already changed. Shocked and suspicious, he urgently interrupted Ning Hejing, "Uncle Hejing, what are you saying?! Yuanqin is my close friend, how could you speak of him like that?!"

Several elders of the Chi Family’s second lineage standing nearby also looked displeased. Li Yuanqin’s ideas had consistently considered the interests of the second lineage, which had greatly satisfied them. But Ning Hejing had disrupted the harmonious atmosphere in the hall with just a few words.

Chi Zhihu’s dissatisfaction was written all over his face. He held back from acting out and simply glared at Ning Hejing, This bastard’s heart is entirely with the first lineage. All I did was mention appointing someone from our second lineage, and he acts like his own mother was murdered, spewing wild accusations...

A heavy silence filled the hall as Chi Fubo’s words faded, but Li Yuanqin quietly said, "I merely cultivated alongside Brother Fubo. The dispute between the two lineages has gone on for ages. Brother Fubo and I reside in Yi Mountain City, five thousand kilometers away; how could I possibly have the skill to sow discord? My lord flatters me too much."

"Yuanqin, there’s no need to say more." Chi Fubo stepped in to shield him. He was well aware that Li Yuanqin’s current identity and status were a crucial piece in this shifting situation. He had to be drawn in, so he said softly, "You step back. I’ll speak with him."

Ning Hejing’s expression was grim and his eyes darkened slightly as he stared coldly at Li Yuanqin.

Once Li Yuanqin had withdrawn, Chi Fubo let out a long sigh. "Uncle Hejing! Couldn’t this be discussed privately? Why go so far as to lay everything bare?!

"Yuanqin offers help out of both resentment and his ambition to control the Li Family. I’m hardly blind to his efforts at sowing discord. I use him while the tide allows it. Once he’s entangled too deeply, how can he back out easily? Sooner or later, he’ll be entirely ours. What’s wrong with that?"

He shook his head repeatedly, trying to persuade, "Uncle Hejing, you command Yuanxing and are used to acting decisively, but this is a crisis! How can you push allies away right now?"

Chi Fubo paused, seeing the other remain unmoved, and lowered his voice, "This is not the time for such arguments. Uncle Hejing, please quickly produce the sect master’s order to appoint the elders to the peaks, so the main family can be protected."

Ning Hejing’s eyes narrowed, making his pupils hard to see. He spoke in a deep voice, "The sect master ordered me to seal off the peaks. There were no residual instructions."

How could Chi Zhiyun have left behind any orders? He hadn’t even brought the sect master’s seal into the cave. He wasn’t a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, how far ahead could he predict? How could there possibly be any orders appointing members of the second lineage?

But how could Chi Fubo not know this? Whether or not Chi Zhiyun left a final order didn’t matter. Li Yuanqin’s so-called leftover decrees had always just been self-authored statements passed off as official...

But Ning Hejing had laid things out plainly. The refusal immediately soured Chi Fubo’s expression.

Ning Hejing’s tone remained somewhat gentle as he said, "The implications are too great. I dare not act rashly. There are several peak masters within the sect, trusted aides of the sect master, with both strength and integrity. Their merits over the years are sufficient, and promoting them now is not improper. I command Yuanxing Peak. You esteemed elders may assist from the side. If the situation shifts unfavorably, then we can reassess."

Chi Fubo’s gaze swept across the man’s face again and again. At last, he realized that the reason this person had summoned his group was to identify those loyal to the first lineage within the Chi Family. His heart filled with fury and cold derision.

"Yes," Chi Fubo answered, smoothing out his expression as he stepped back a few paces. Several of the uncles looked displeased, but what more could they say with Yuanxing Peak’s formation eyeing them like a tiger watching prey? They all dispersed, leaving only Ning Hejing behind.

Ning Hejing rubbed the center of his eyebrows, the shadow on his face lingering stubbornly. He summoned a trusted aide and said in a low voice, "I thought the second lineage could see the bigger picture and support the first lineage, but they’re all the same kind of people. Now they want me to only appoint members of the second lineage. If I do that, I will betray the sect master’s trust. I can no longer rely on them.

"Go invite the other peak masters."

While Ning Hejing made his arrangements, Chi Fubo exited the great hall. The Chi Family members all looked grim. Chi Zhihu said angrily, "I say he’s even more overbearing than Si Yuanli!"

Chi Fubo’s expression was dark as he griped, "Ning Hejing is a loyal hound of the first lineage. His mother was a legitimate daughter of the first lineage, so of course he won’t side with us. He’s extreme, ungrateful, and self-important. He won’t last long, but I only fear he’ll ruin everything first."

Chi Buxin looked aged, but his tone was the most decisive as he said softly, "Since when did the Ning Family get to meddle in Chi Family affairs? If not for his current control over Yuanxing Peak, we’d have killed him outright, no matter the chaos. Why should we care what he thinks?"

Li Yuanqin was waiting outside the hall and had caught most of the conversation in just a few lines. He said quietly, "If only there were an order from the sect master."

The others were waiting for him to speak. When they heard him, they awaited the next sentence. Chi Fubo asked softly, "Brother Yuanqin, are you saying..."

Li Yuanqin lifted his head slightly, looking at the spiritual smoke drifting through the immortal sects. He said calmly, "The sect master is in closed-door cultivation, seeking to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. By protocol, someone should inherit the sect master’s position."

Chi Fubo’s heart pounded with excitement, but reason still held him. He sighed. "But we are weak in numbers and have neither legitimacy nor public support. Without a formal decree, assuming the sect master’s seat on our own would be suicide with Ning Hejing standing in opposition. We’d just be handing a gift to Si Yuanli."

Li Yuanqin replied, "The sect master has no children, but Chi Zhiyan has many wives and concubines. He still has a legitimate son within the sect. Though he’s young, he can be jointly supported."

His expression didn’t change, and he quietly transmitted his next words to the others through a secret technique, "Lord Ning claims to act for the good of the main line. If a legitimate heir from the main line issues the order personally, how could he disobey? With the first lineage nearly gone, who else could that child possibly trust but you elders of the Chi Family?

"Even if the sect master emerges from seclusion, he’ll have no cause to complain. He may even reward you all..."

Chi Fubo and the others exchanged glances, entered a hall together, activated formations, and sealed the area. Chi Fubo spoke slowly, "But in the future..."

Li Yuanqin already knew what was on his mind. The first lineage of the Chi Family had finally stumbled, so of course they harbored thoughts of taking over. Wouldn’t doing this just hand it all back to the first lineage?

"First, preserve ourselves. Later, when power is in hand and our own people control Yuanxing Peak, we can watch the situation unfold slowly. If all major matters proceed smoothly..."

The youth’s voice was frighteningly calm, yet it made Chi Fubo’s eyes light up. The mana-lamp’s glow cast shadows over Li Yuanqin’s face as he said, "My lord, this child is in the Qi Cultivation Realm. He must break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, but... Foundation Establishment Realm is a life-or-death pass."

Moongaze Lake.
𝘧𝓇ℯ𝑒𝓌𝑒𝑏𝓃𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝒸ℴ𝓂

Cultivators moved across the lake. A white-robed man rode frost down onto a peak, a sword at his waist. Li Xijun ascended the steps, where two young men waited beside the hall.

One wore a heavy cloak, tall and broad-shouldered, with a spear strapped to his back and a commanding presence. His sharp, powerful gaze revealed him to be the former family head, Li Chengliao.

The other was slightly younger, sword at his waist. He was leaner in comparison, and clad in long robes. He stood beside Li Chengliao and was Li Chenghuai, son of Li Xizhi.

Li Zhouwei was still overseas, and the two brothers of the Radiant Lure generation had returned from the north to take charge of the family. Li Chengliao had once been the family head, so handling these matters came naturally to him.

Li Chenghuai was now at the seventh stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and was managing affairs in Mount Yue. Though he lacked his father’s charisma, he was a competent leader.

The two had come to pay respects to Li Xijun, both already grown men. Compared to Li Xijun, they seemed more like brothers than uncle and nephew.

After all, pills and spirit items nourish the body.

Li Xijun understood this well. In the generation of Li Tongya and Li Xuanfeng, they had hardly relied on pills or spirit items, relying solely on their own cultivation. Thus, they aged quickly. Li Tongya had reached Foundation Establishment Realm late and, by the age of seventy or eighty, looked like he was already in his fifties or sixties.

Things had clearly improved with Li Yuanjiao’s generation. By the time of Li Xijun’s generation, they already had the air of legitimate heirs of an esteemed family. All three of the Xi brothers looked no different in age from the younger juniors.

"Eighth uncle." Li Chengliao stepped forward, offered a bow, and handed over a letter, speaking softly, "News from Zongquan Island, it’s good news."

Though a senior family member had just passed, Li Chengliao called it good news. Yet there was no joy in his expression, only seriousness. Li Xijun gently took the letter and unfolded it, Zhouwei has broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm during his seclusion.

Li Zhouwei had taken a Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill and a Talisman Pill with him before setting out, so his breakthrough came as no surprise. Li Xijun nodded slightly and continued reading.

However, before his Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough, Li Zhouwei had written of several matters in his letter. All of them were good news.

The first was that Li Chenghui, who cultivated thunder arts, had already reached the eighth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. If the family sent him a pill, he could begin cultivating the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique and attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Li Qinghong’s Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, though from the grotto heaven of the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling, was essentially a technique for modifying spiritual qi. It wasn’t high-grade on its own; only the appended Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique was truly powerful.

Li Chenghui’s current cultivation technique, the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique, was an ancient method brought back from the Three Drums Wall of Green Pine Temple. It not only shortened his lifespan less than other methods, but it was also more profound than the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique. Its brilliance lay in forging a Dao foundation known as the Profound Thunderpool. He had already mastered the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique!

Li Xijun silently praised in his heart, Chenghui is still young, but his cultivation is progressing quickly, and his technique is solid. If he successfully forms his foundation and crosses the life-or-death barrier, he will surely be a prime candidate to serve as our family’s protector...

The news put him in an excellent mood. Reading further, he saw that the second piece of news was the birth of Li Zhouwei’s second son.

The second son is handsome, quiet, and cries little, though he has a large appetite. He shows no signs of anything extraordinary. He was no different from a mortal child.

Li Xijun felt a sense of relief reading that. Li Jiang’ao’s appearance was still vivid in his mind. The fact that there were no abnormalities was already the best news. He kept reading, Though the second son shows no signs of the extraordinary, Zhouwei bears a fated destiny. There’s fear that all his sons may be a Bright Yang heir, which is no trivial matter. I ask Great Uncle to consider carefully and, for now, not to include him in the family register.

Li Xijun immediately understood that Li Zhouwei was clearly still wary after Li Jiang’ao. Li Zhouwei was afraid that his second son, though human in appearance, might be a demonic being within. He was being extremely cautious.

He shall not be entered into the four lineages. He will be named Li Jiangqian. If Uncle has any reservations or considerations, please reply to me.

Li Xijun exhaled softly, put away the letter, and congratulated Li Chengliao, "Congratulations!"

Li Chengliao gave a solemn nod and said quietly, "A pity about Lady Xu..."

The incident with Li Jiang’ao had long been sealed away and known to only a handful. Li Chengliao only knew the woman had died suddenly; he didn’t know his eldest grandson had been confined on the mountain. So he finally breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing of Li Jiangqian’s birth.

"I had feared Lady An would die as well, and all the families would begin to gossip. Thankfully, Little Qian is well, I can now set my mind at ease."

Li Xijun nodded, dismissed the two, and turned into the great hall. His gaze swept across the table. He activated a spell to link with the grand formation, and immediately, radiant light shone forth as a jade box materialized before him.

This jade box had been acquired by Li Tongya. It was incredibly sturdy, marked with mysterious patterns, and capable of storing Purple Mansion Realm spirit items, though it had not been used in the household for quite some time.

He put away the jade box, rode the wind northward, and flew across most of Moongaze Lake. He stopped in the center of the lake when a large island came into view, shimmering with brilliance and echoing with sounds of thunder and fire. He could make out ruins, broken walls and shattered tiles amid the glow, the remnants of the former marketplace at the heart of Moongaze Lake.

A white ape stood upon the lake. Upon seeing him, it bowed. Towering in size and casting a large shadow, it said quietly, "My lord, you’ve arrived."

"Senior."

Though the Li Family didn’t fully understand Daoist He’s background and remained cautious for the moment, they certainly wouldn’t waste such a rare opportunity. Li Qinghong and Li Ximing had already entered the island at the heart of the lake.

Chen Taoping of Lingyu Gate perished when the marketplace had been destroyed, and the ancient formation had been shattered by the Deadly Thunder Formation Destroyer. This gave rise to a forbidden formation that had flickered over the lake for seventy years.

The forbidden formation was extremely difficult to break, but Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators could come and go freely. Thus cultivators of that realm took turns looting the treasures left in the marketplace. Now, the formation’s power had waned to the point where even some Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators could last briefly within. But the place had already been ransacked repeatedly, to the point where no one was willing to enter anymore.

Li Xijun landed on the island. As expected, the spiritual qi was rich. After a careful estimation, he thought, Just this spot alone already rivals our Mount Qingdu! If it’s a place where spiritual energy gathers, it might even compare to Mount Wu.

If not for the great trouble of entering the forbidden formation, and the fact that no additional formations could be set up within, making it highly unsafe, they would have long seized this place. However, it was too tasteless for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and too dangerous for Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators to stay long.

He was surrounded by ruined walls and overgrown grass. Sunken white bones had weathered into fragments beneath his feet. Li Xijun rode the wind to the center, where the ground was covered in formation patterns. Four pale stone pillars stood around a deep well.

A youth in golden robes stood between them, divining with his fingers while reading the runes on the stone pillars. When he saw Li Xijun, his eyes lit up, and he called out, "Brother Xijun, you’ve returned. Did you bring the item?"

Li Xijun nodded, stepped forward, and landed on the broken formation base. The deep well that served as the formation’s core was etched with arcane patterns. The water within had seemingly been drained, leaving only a gaping, black void.

Li Xijun had specifically returned to Mount Qingdu to retrieve this jade box.

"According to the family records, this jade box was retrieved from this very well by our great-grandfather..."

A box symbolized both defense and containment, and this deep well was the core of the formation. At first, Li Ximing believed it to be a symbolic object suppressing the formation’s center, much like the five kinds of spirit water within their own Mount Qingdu formation.

He asked, "If this is indeed the object that suppresses the formation’s core, it might help us break the formation."

But the white-robed youth examined it carefully, compared the ground patterns with those on the jade box, and shook his head, "No... this jade box doesn’t match the grand formation. It’s not an accessory of the formation’s core."

Li Xijun pondered for a moment, a trace of insight dawning in his heart, and replied, "It seems this mysterious well was dug precisely to guard and conceal this jade box..."




# Chapter 896: The Beginning Of Total Achievement

Li Xijun considered all this and remained cautious, but unfortunately, the jade box was completely empty inside. It had no grooves or fixed protrusions, and was simply a hollow container.

Before the two could discuss further, a bolt of lightning flashed down onto the island. When the purple light dispersed, it revealed a female cultivator in a feathered robe, holding a spear.

Her voice was gentle. "I’ve inspected the island. Including the surrounding islets and wetlands, it covers roughly fifty kilometers.

"That’s not small at all."

Although Moongaze Lake was famed as a one thousand five hundred kilometer wide lake and the largest in Yue State, it was no longer comparable to its ancient size. In the west, its narrow stretch reached Mount Xiping, and in the east, its tributaries extended into the Wilderness. The lake islets were all flat reed marshes. Even at its peak, the lake only spanned about five hundred kilometers. The island at the heart of the lake was already considered massive.

The lightning of this forbidden formation seemed harmless to Li Qinghong, instead gathering affectionately on her Duruo Spear as arcs of violet lightning danced. She said, "Have you managed to uncover anything from this forbidden formation?"

"Aunt."

Though Li Ximing was an alchemist, the Li Family’s heritage covered formations, pills, talismans, and tools. After a few days of study, he had found some clues and bowed in reply. "This grand formation doesn’t seem to be a creation of later generations. The patterns are ancient, and the four pillars within symbolize Merging Fire, Converging Water, Molten Fire, and Valley Water. Since all four remain intact, it retains great power."

Li Xijun picked up the thread of conversation. "This appears to be an ancient formation, and not one set by Chen Taoping. The Fei Family’s Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation on the lake is also ancient. They may share a common origin. I sent someone to the Fei Family to retrieve the formation core and personally went home to fetch this jade box."

Li Xijun explained its background in detail. Li Qinghong took the jade box and examined it. The white box shimmered in her slender hands, and a flash of purple lightning flickered over it. Before she could speak, a person and a white ape descended from the sky.

"Greetings, esteemed elders!"

The person and the ape were, of course, Fei Tongyu and the white ape. Fei Tongyu was not strong enough to enter the formation alone, so the white ape had waited for him outside.

Fei Tongyu had taken medicine and looked much better. As soon as he landed, he knelt and raised both hands, presenting a small flag. The small flag was colored dark yellow and black, its edges embroidered with dark silver patterns, and it emitted a misty, shadowy aura. It was quite beautiful.

He hid his two missing fingers behind the flag and bowed as he spoke respectfully, "The core of the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation, the Profound Boundless Flag, is here."

"You are too polite, senior." Li Xijun spoke politely, sidestepping to avoid the bow, and immediately helped him up, his expression warm.

Li Qinghong accepted the flag and responded gently, "Xijun is right. Brother Fei is one of our own; there’s no need for formality."

Fei Tongyu merely stood respectfully with his head lowered. Li Xijun took a closer look and remarked, "So the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation belongs to the category of Boundless Essence. That’s quite rare in the South."

The Boundless Essence qi appeared as a dark yellow hue. The one most knowledgeable about it among the Li Family was Li Xizhi. He had once crossed paths with Tuoba Chongyuan, a cultivator of Boundless Essence. Emperor Wu of Liang held the title of True Monarch Tiancheng of Boundless Essence, a true monarch of that very path.

Li Qinghong began speculating, If I’m not mistaken, the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation must’ve been established during the Liang dynasty. That would explain the use of Boundless Essence. Back then, the formation must have been quite formidable. Now that Liang is gone, I suspect it has lost over sixty percent of its power...

Even weakened, the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation had long been the strongest on the lake before the Li Family’s arrival. Ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators could not easily breach it, and the Fei Family had relied on this formation to endure for generations.

Sure enough, Fei Tongyu nodded respectfully and replied, "Replying to the elders, this formation was where our ancestors once resided. It dates back to the Great Liang era. When Great Ning cultivators attacked this place, it was cultivators from Ning State who guarded the river and set it up. Our family history does record its weakening."

Fei Tongyu paused slightly and lowered his head, "Though ancient, this formation has never failed in all these years. The only exception was when our old ancestor was slain. That man walked through the formation as if it didn’t exist. Neither the formation plate nor the flags responded. It was as if they respectfully let him leave."

Li Qinghong tilted her head slightly and met Li Xijun’s gaze. The young man appeared deep in thought, Cultivators of Ning State who guarded the river?

Li Xuanfeng’s relics had included a letter from the Great Ning Palace, written by a cultivator of Ning State to the Sima Family. It once mentioned, Your family has long stood guard along the riverbanks...

Could it be that this formation once belonged to the Sima Family?

Li Xijun suppressed his doubts, took the formation flag, and carefully compared it to the markings on the ground. After a while, he said, "It was likely crafted by the same hand."

Li Ximing exhaled slightly, shook his sleeves, and said, "That makes things much easier! If we have the core artifact as a reference and invite a Formation Master, a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators working together can break this formation. It’s just a forbidden formation now, so it’s not that difficult to deal with."

The three rose together. Li Xijun first looked at Fei Tongyu and said gently, "Senior, you may return for now. I still need to copy the patterns from the formation flag to break the formation. I’ll need to borrow it for another two or three days, and will return it afterward."

Fei Tongyu responded with a respectful bow and was escorted out by the white ape. Once he had left, the three of them exited the formation together. Li Ximing looked quite satisfied, thinking, That’s two birds with one stone. Now we also control the formation’s secrets. No matter what happens in the future, at least this grand formation won’t be able to cause much trouble.

Li Xijun nodded slightly. The formation markings just now did seem to come from one hand. Regardless of whether it was true, it was the right story in front of Fei Tongyu. He said softly, "There must be both power and sacrifice when drawing others into allegiance. Gaining the formation flag this way is far gentler than other methods. At least it doesn’t damage the dignity of the rest of the Fei Family, and it spares Fei Tongyu from being caught in too awkward a position."

"This kind of thing really is your specialty, Eighth Brother!" Li Ximing shook his head in admiration. Li Qinghong was still examining the jade box in her hand.

Li Xijun turned and said, "Make a copy of the patterns and send a portion to Brother Zhi as well. Let’s investigate in the sect for any connection. The Fei Family is a cautionary tale. These ancient formations, techniques, and dharma artifacts are indeed powerful, but if we don’t know who the original owner is, we may end up letting outsiders come and go as they please."

Now that they were speaking of ancient techniques and dharma artifacts, Li Ximing’s eyes lit up. He took something from his sleeve and tossed it into the air, where it spun and expanded, transforming into a man-sized incense burner.

The burner was entirely crimson-red, its three legs carved with beast faces. Its sides had an image of a three-eyed creature, neither wolf nor tiger, its four feet stepping on cloud smoke. It was vivid and lifelike, a depiction of the famed ancient Three-Eyed Mount Tiao Beast.

Only the base bore the word Sima, glowing faintly. After spending a long time refining it, Li Ximing had finally succeeded and was quite satisfied, This burner is called Cuoxiang. It is a Foundation Establishment Realm ancient dharma artifact, and different from most current dharma artifacts. It is not meant for combat.

Seeing the other two look over, Li Ximing began to explain, "This burner excels at nurturing fire and burning incense. It can not only preserve multiple spiritual flames but also suppress fire veins, transforming the malignant aura they emit into spiritual smoke. Such an effect is unheard of."

He formed a seal with his fingers, and a flame leaped from the burner, taking the shape of a bird. The Li Family’s sole spiritual flame, the Long Marching Fire Essence, had been stored within.

The Li Family’s Wutu Mountain had a fire vein of average strength. It was suitable for alchemy but somewhat lacking for refining artifacts. Fortunately, the Yu Family was well-established. Their Milin Mountain had two fire veins, one for alchemy and one for refining, both with long histories. This dharma artifact would certainly be of use.

Li Ximing’s talisman qi, the Valley Wind Leading Fire, was already capable of refining flames. After demonstrating the burner's fire-nurturing ability, he continued, "Even better, this burner has a Qi Nourishing function. It can store all kinds of spiritual qi without them interfering with one another. Most spiritual qi can be gently sustained inside, preventing it from dissipating over time."

This effect was truly impressive and made Li Xijun’s eyes light up.

The Li Family now had dozens of qi gathering methods, and each type of spiritual qi had different containment requirements. What’s more, each spiritual qi required a special jade vial, which added up over time. These vials had spatial properties but still couldn’t be stored in a storage pouch.

"Send it to the Jade Court..." Li Xijun murmured, then said softly, "No, better to send it to Milin. We can set up a new department there that’s solely responsible for qi gathering."

The Li Family was growing ever larger, and allowing the Jade Court Guards to centralize too much power was not ideal. Responsibilities needed to be distributed. Li Xijun had already begun laying the groundwork for a new system, intending to use the move to the lake islands as an opportunity to reform.

Li Qinghong understood his intentions. The woman reflected inwardly, Cuoxiang is a family treasure, and the painted screen isn’t far off in value. Pity the refinement process is so difficult. The mana I’ve poured into it has vanished without a trace... who knows when I’ll finish refining it.

Cuoxiang was in Li Ximing’s hands, while the painted screen was naturally in Li Qinghong’s. Neither had been fully refined yet. The Li Family still didn’t know anything about the golden talisman and mercury droplets, but Si Yuanli, who had accompanied Li Xuanfeng, most likely knew about it. Li Xizhi had already begun inquiring.

As the three descended onto the peak, they were met by Li Xuanxuan, who held a letter in his hand, his brow tightly furrowed. Li Xijun stepped forward and greeted respectfully, "My lord, this is..."

Li Xuanxuan simply handed over the letter, which Li Xijun began reading, Ning Hejing, Chi Fubo, and others, in accordance with the late sect master’s final immortal command, appointed Chi Zhiyan’s son, Chi Xuxiao, as sect master overnight... Promoted Chi Zhihu, Xia Yun, Ning Hede, and others to roles in the General Affairs Hall, Xieqi Peak, Immortal Tribute Office, and Cloudliner Office...

At midnight, Si Yuanli returned to Azure Pond Sect, admitting he failed to aid in time. Chi Xuxiao did not fault him and instead rewarded him generously...

Li Xijun read in silence. Li Ximing took the letter next, frowning as he spoke, "How did a Qi Cultivation Realm sect master suddenly appear?!"

The letter stated that Chi Xuxiao was only twelve years old and at the second stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. It had been over three hundred years since the Azure Pond Sect had a sect master of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Xuanxuan could only shake his head as he said, "All I can see is that Si Yuanli is in for a rough time. None of them seem to have good intentions toward him."

The group sat down in the main hall and the letter was passed around. Once it returned to Li Xijun, he read it twice again, then said quietly, "The Azure Pond Sect’s response was shockingly fast... but this move was unexpected..."

The white-robed young man rested a hand on his sword hilt, speaking in a low, calm voice, "They’ve gone and appointed another sect master. What are Ning Hejing and the Chi Family thinking..."

Most of the names in the letter were unfamiliar, save for a few recognizable ones and Chi Zhihu of the Chi Family’s second lineage. The rest were likely either remaining Chi loyalists or members of the Ning Family.

Li Xijun said, "In truth, since Chi Zhiyun hasn’t emerged from seclusion, there was no need to rush. They could have just promoted a few Chi Family and loyal members into key positions, drawn in the noble clans, and observed the situation calmly...

"Though many families are dissatisfied with the Chi Family, Chi Zhiyun is adept at winning people over. Most of the sect’s daoists still recognize the Chi Family. Doing this now only makes them look weak."

Of course, all of these moves by the Chi Family, the families, and the daoists assumed that the Daoist Master Yuan Xiu, Si Boxiu, was either missing or unwilling to interfere. If Si Boxiu chose to act, replacing Chi with Si at the Azure Pond Sect would be a matter of a single command.

Li Qinghong nodded and said softly, "Judging from Si Yuanli’s actions, at the very least, Yuan Xiu has no ulterior plans... otherwise, why would he enter the hall and admit guilt?"

Li Xijun took a moment to gather his thoughts, then said decisively, "Chi Zhiyun couldn’t possibly have left any true command behind. If he foresaw today, he wouldn’t have appointed a child. This so-called command is definitely forged.

"My humble guess is that there was some compromise between Ning Hejing and the Chi Family... maybe the Chi Family doesn’t trust Ning Hejing, and Ning Hejing fears being discarded once used. Many scenarios are possible. In any case, this appointment list or Chi Xuxiao himself is the result of that compromise..."

Everyone fell into thought. Li Xuanxuan studied the situation, quietly taking it as a lesson as he pondered the inter-lineage systems, then said, "No matter which family it happens to, the collapse of a main bloodline like this will take decades to recover from, especially since the Chi Family’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivators has gone missing..."

Li Qinghong raised her teacup and took a sip at the mention of the Chi Family’s missing Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, lowering her eyes to conceal her expression.

Li Xijun slightly raised an eyebrow and continued, "That’s true. The sect master has been appointed, and it does come with its advantages. It’s better than doing nothing. Now it’s up to Si Yuanli to worry about resolving the situation.

"In any case, the chaos at the Azure Pond Sect has already begun. Yuan Xiu’s faction is deeply entrenched and ambitious. The Chi and Ning faction may have the name, but their strength is inconsistent..."

Although the Li Family had long anticipated turmoil in the Azure Pond Sect, events don’t always unfold as expected. Who could say whether Si Boxiu would personally intervene? Who could predict whether Ning Hejing and the others would passively await their fate?

If the Si Family advanced with unstoppable momentum and seized control of the Azure Pond Sect under the leadership of a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, then how well would those uncontrollable esteemed families fare afterward under the eyes of the Si Family?

Whoever held that position, be they named Si or Chi, their stance would be the same. The only difference was that the Li Family rendered prior service, so the Si Family might show some leniency. But would they truly allow an entire lake region to fall wholly into the Li Family’s hands?

To most, the current situation seemed perfectly normal. Yet only Li Xijun quietly let out a breath of relief. Even his brows relaxed, his eyes grew bright, and he changed the topic, saying, "As for our Li Family."

The white-robed youth exhaled, his tone now far more relaxed as he spoke softly, "With the upper sect in chaos, factions at odds, offerings neglected, and the esteemed families left unchecked, we should seize this moment to fulfill our family’s century-old ambition!

"Devour the Great Lake, enter the island at the heart of the lake, become the head of a prefecture, seize spirit items, and pursue the Purple Mansion Realm..."

He paused. Clad in white as pure as snow, his voice turned sharp and resolute, each word ringing with force, "Complete the work of six generations!"




# Chapter 898: Chongming Profound Insight Screen

Lush vegetation flourished as mountain mist cascaded like waterfalls. Snow-white tendrils ghosted along the eaves, green hues forming the base, accented by swirls of dark yellow and black. The stone steps glistened, shrouded in a thin layer of white fog.

Tap.

A cloth boot stepped through the mist, revealing the intricate patterns etched into the stone steps. A man in a feathered robe wore white silk tied around his forehead. His bearing was already elegant, and iridescent light shimmered at the corners of his eyes, striking awe in all who beheld him.

The young man beside him followed half a step behind, slightly bowing with a respectful tone as he spoke softly, "Peak Master, Changtian Peak seems rather bare. Perhaps we could have some people arrange furnishings... it would help maintain appearances..."

"No need." The trailing end of Li Xizhi’s white silk fluttered in the wind. Behind him, flowing clouds painted a picturesque scene, and the immortal peak pierced the heavens like a sword. He turned his head slightly and said softly, "I appreciate the thought, but I have no need for such things. It feels more tranquil on Changtian Peak with fewer buildings."

Si Tongyi followed obediently. The two entered the hall together and took their seats in short order. The young man cupped his hands and said, "There was some dispute in the main hall regarding Lord Xuanfeng’s reward. Chi Zhihu claimed that a father’s blessing should pass to his son, and that it should go to Li Yuanqin. But my lord said that Lord Xuanfeng had instructed him to deliver the item to the Li Family instead..."

"Oh?" Li Xizhi gave a slight nod and asked, "What does Lord Ning think?"

"My lord’s view is... perhaps it’s best to set the matter aside for now. Since the spirit item cannot be easily divided, the Li Family’s tribute may be waived temporarily. We’ll summon a few of their disciples to train on the peak and grant them some dharma artifacts, then revisit the matter when Lord Zhiyun exits seclusion."

"Mm." Li Xizhi poured himself some tea but gave no response.

Si Tongyi quickly continued, "There’s no need to finalize things just yet. My lord will certainly do his best to advocate."

"Then I thank your lord sincerely." The first quiet struggle between the two sides had already played out in the main hall.

Li Xizhi said little, while Si Tongyi shifted the topic and spoke softly, "Now that Peak Master has returned, we should begin preparations for accepting disciples. You may visit the various prefectures under the Azure Pond Sect. If there are any suitable children below the mountain with sufficient innate ability, they can be brought into the peak."

Li Xizhi simply nodded and saw Si Tongyi out. Returning to the main hall, he took the letter from his sleeve and placed it on the table.

"Reward."

Li Xizhi didn’t give the reward much thought. It likely contained nothing truly useful. The Li Family’s real ambition was the Bright Yang spirit item of the Purple Mansion Realm, how could they place hope in a reward?

Neither Si Yuanli nor the Chi and Ning Families were blind. Li Ximing was already at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and cultivating the Bright Yang. If the Li Family started searching for a Purple Mansion Realm Bright Yang spirit item now, wouldn’t that be openly declaring their intention to break through into Purple Mansion Realm? They probably couldn’t even mention it aloud.

This pursuit must remain secret... as of now, only a few seniors like Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak Gate know of it...

He sat quietly in the hall for a while before Yang Xiao'er entered from the rear of the hall and sat obediently beside him. She was from the Yang Family and had nothing to worry about. Naturally, she was using all sixty years before attempting Foundation Establishment Realm. Now at fifty-eight, she was honing her cultivation for the breakthrough.

Though nearing sixty, Yang Xiao'er looked no older than thirty, thanks to the Yang Family’s exceptional pills and cultivation resources. As the couple murmured softly to each other, someone entered from outside the hall.

"Xizhi..."

This man had bright, glowing eyes and a powerful presence. His feathered robe was rich and dignified. He nodded to Li Xizhi with words of condolence, then greeted Yang Xiao'er, "Eleventh Sister."

Yang Ruizao of the Yang Family had followed Li Xuanfeng out of seclusion in the first battle at Mount Bianyan, slain several devil cultivators, and was severely wounded. Afterward, he had remained in the sect recuperating.

Li Xizhi exchanged a few casual words with him. Yang Ruizao offered praise and lament, with a touch of sincere emotion, and sighed. "It’s a pity I was seriously injured and couldn’t help guard the river. I failed to contribute my part..."

Then he shifted the topic and shook his head. "Snow fell heavily on the peak last night. The east wind blew, then the west wind followed. Who knows when it will end?"

Li Xizhi nodded and replied, "The snow on the peak is beautiful. And since there are no commoners below the mountain, the longer it lasts, the better."

Yang Ruizao chuckled in agreement, clearly pleased with the sentiment. He raised his cup toward Li Xizhi, and the two shared silent understanding. Then Li Xizhi spoke softly, "I invited you here today, Brother-in-law, because there’s something I need to inquire about."

He picked up the letter on the table and handed it to Yang Ruizao.

Yang Ruizao accepted it and examined it. When he saw that it was written by someone from the Li Family, he was immediately pleased. Seeing how Yang Xiao'er and Li Xizhi were so affectionate, he took this act as a sign of true kinship and thought to himself, Eleventh Sister married him as a political union... and yet they’ve grown so close. That’s rare indeed.

But after reading the contents, his expression turned strange. He paused for several moments before letting out a bitter laugh and said, "Xizhi... you’ve certainly asked the right person... This Daoist He’s real name is He Ting, and as for his close friend in the sect..."

Yang Ruizao continued to chuckle as he answered, "A flood washing into the Dragon King Temple, that friend of his is none other than our family’s ancestor!"

"This..." Li Xizhi was genuinely taken aback. He set the jade cup in his hand down on the table and immediately replied warmly, "This ancestor... could it be Ancestor Tianya?"

"Exactly!" replied Yang Ruizao.

Over a hundred years ago, Mount Yue had taken root in the wilderness along the riverbank. The Yang Family’s ancestor, Yang Tianya, led troops to suppress them, and while passing by Moongaze Lake, developed a connection with the Li Family’s forebear, Li Mutian.

He had been in seclusion for over fifty years. Though there was no confirmed news, judging by the timeline, he had likely already passed. Li Xizhi did the math, this He Ting was also nearing the end of his lifespan. The timeline matched perfectly.

Yang Ruizao said gently, "Daoist He is an artifact smith with considerable skill. His presence here is no coincidence...

"He holds a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact known as the Nine Gates Temple. But it doesn’t truly belong to him. It is the artifact of Tianque Zhenren from the Golden Feather Sect."

As a family with centuries of history, the Yang Family had once even held an exalted status. Naturally, they were well-informed about such matters. Yang Ruizao explained calmly, "Daoist Master Tianque wanted a Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact, but he had a notoriously bad temper and bore grudges against the likes of Yuanwu and Hengli. After much searching, Daoist He was the one who took up the task.

"He accepted He Ting’s nephew as a disciple. In return, He Ting used the remainder of his life to forge the Nine Gates Temple. This artifact is highly unusual. It required cooperation from forty-five scattered Dao lineages to cultivate and refine it over generations. Then He Ting used his own Dao foundation to nurture it for a century, allowing a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to produce a Purple Mansion Realm artifact embryo."

"No wonder!" Li Xizhi finally understood why so many small, scattered families existed under Daoist He’s rule on the western bank, untouched for years. They had been ignored by both the Golden Feather Sect and the Azure Pond Sect, with no tribute demanded.

So it was the work of Daoist Master Tianque. He hasn’t appeared for a century because he’s been refining the artifact embryo...

Li Xizhi furrowed his brow and asked, "And now, this artifact embryo..."

If that was the case, Daoist He would indeed be a troublesome figure. Only now did Li Xizhi raise the question, but Yang Ruizao simply chuckled, "Don’t worry! It was delivered to the Golden Feather Sect long ago!"

Li Xizhi realized the expected problem no longer existed. He secretly felt fortunate that his family still had some luck, and he expressed his thanks aloud, "So there’s such a backstory. That clears up many doubts for me... Thank you, Brother-in-law!"

"No need for such formality!" Yang Ruizao waved his hand broadly and grinned. "I saw Daoist He the year I was born. He held my brothers and me in his arms. I also visited him a few times afterward. He’s a very kind and reasonable elder. Let’s go to the lake together and speak with him in person!
𝕗𝐫𝚎𝗲𝘄𝐞𝕓𝐧𝕠𝘃𝕖𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝚖

"He’s always been a decent man, and now that he hasn’t much time left, he surely won’t turn down your family’s goodwill..."

He chuckled and added, "When the end comes, you can’t take anything with you. Helping his nephew befriend a major family for free? That’s a guaranteed win for him!"

Li Xizhi nodded gently and the two began chatting freely in the hall. Yang Ruizao was a man of action and said directly, "I’m always busy. Rather than picking a day, why not strike while the iron’s hot? Let’s head to the lake now and get this matter settled."

It was clear that Yang Ruizao feared a major shift might occur once he left the sect. He was determined to resolve this matter while things were still calm and free of conflict.

The sooner Moongaze Lake was unified, the better. Li Xizhi thought the same. The two nodded, but before they could speak further, someone came in to report, kneeling in the hall and speaking respectfully, "Reporting to the Peak Master, Fei Qingyi from Yuanwu Peak has come to pay a visit!"

Fei Qingyi has broken through?

Li Xizhi tilted his head slightly, catching the flicker of surprise in Yang Ruizao’s eyes. Even someone as well-informed as him hadn’t known of her breakthrough. Fei Qingyi must have come to pay respects the moment she exited seclusion.

Li Xizhi nodded, took a sip of tea, and spoke gently, "I have an honored guest visiting and will soon be departing for the south. If she has the time, she’s welcome to join us."

Moongaze Lake, Mount Qingdu.

Li Qinghong, clad in a simple white dress, was in the dimly lit main hall atop Mount Qingdu. Her Duruo Spear rested on a rack, and a mana lamp flickered softly with its pea-sized white glow casting gentle illumination.

Her cultivation had gradually approached perfection. After years of tempering her Immortal Foundation’s Thunder Pool, she was nearing her next advancement. Though there was still some room, the bottleneck wasn’t far off.

The Dao of thunder-element breakthroughs... is likely out of reach now.

Li Qinghong had always been a seeker of the Dao, and her innate talent was far from lacking. Now, at this point, she silently contemplated her options.

Other than that grotto heaven, only the Northern and Southern Seas are known to have Purple Mansion Realm thunder arts...

The Northern Sea was rich in Profound Thunder, with several Dao lineages of thunder arts, some of which were possibly tied to Celestial Thunder. The Southern Sea’s Miao Family was also likely of the Profound Thunder lineage. But neither were options she could lay claim to.

She had once encountered Shen Yanqing and Miao Quan in the Eastern Sea. They had mentioned the Profund Thunderstone in their conversation. Piecing the clues together now, it might well be a Celestial Thunder Purple Mansion Realm spirit item.

If Shen Yanqing holds the Profund Thunderstone, the Shen Family might possess Celestial Thunder techniques, but it may not necessarily be the Profound Thunderpool.

No matter how she turned it over in her mind, the Dao to the Purple Mansion Realm seemed increasingly out of reach. Her only chance lay in the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling’s grotto heaven, which had been swallowed by the dragon clan.

She let out a quiet sigh of relief, Good thing it was swallowed by the dragon clan. Otherwise, trouble would have come to us.

Her technique, the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique, belonged to the Dao lineage of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling. More than one person had recognized it. Miao Quan, members of the Xi Family... all could identify the spell.

If they could recognize it, then the real master of the Purple Smoke Gate had long taken notice. Her technique had been passed down from Lingyanzi... but there was no need to say more. Lingyanzi might think he had concealed it well, but he had likely been exposed from the beginning!

When I met with them back then, I’m fairly certain a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master was standing nearby, silently listening in. But the grotto heaven was given to the dragon clan, with Yuan Tuan and Yuan Chengdun as keys, so even if the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master brought us in, it would’ve been useless...

Only now did she truly realize the danger she’d been living with all these years, and she sighed inwardly, I’d best settle my family matters first!

She opened her eyes, violet light flickering within them. She turned her palm over and a miniature screen about the length of a forearm, dark in color and seemingly plain, except for the thick, flowing violet lightning that lent it a mysterious and extraordinary air, appeared in her hands.

After months of effort, Li Qinghong had finally finished refining this dharma artifact. A name slowly surfaced in her mind, Chongming Profound Insight Screen.

The more time she spent refining it, the more she realized how unusual this artifact truly was. Her expression was now solemn. She rose on thunder and flew through the clear night toward the side hall.

It was late, but Li Xijun was still practicing his swordsmanship. Since he had just broken through to Sword Essence, there was far too much to absorb. He didn’t want to waste even a moment. When he saw Li Qinghong enter, he sheathed his sword and asked in confusion, "Aunt?"

"I’ve finished refining the ancient dharma artifact," Li Qinghong answered crisply. She lightly tossed the Chongming Profound Insight Screen into the hall, releasing a wave of dark teal light. It slowly unfurled and revealed its true form.

Its frame was forged from deep green-black metallic stone, adorned with archaic patterns. There were eight panels in total, each glowing faintly with concealed light. The aunt and nephew gazed upon it together as the images on the panels lit up one by one.

The screen depicted a grand palace, its halls interconnected in a way that made the viewer dizzy. On the eighth panel, beyond the hall, dark winds and green pines created a celestial atmosphere. A flight of steps led to the gate, and a figure stood outside, seemingly listening intently with his ear turned.

He wore white robes, had a refined and respectful face, and a sword hung at his waist. A crescent-moon-shaped jade pendant dangled from the sword tassel. Inside the hall, a youth in green robes and black boots, holding a book, was lounging on the outermost seat. His posture was extremely casual. His face was blank and completely featureless.

Farther in stood a woman in purple, poised and upright. A spirit screen and a violet book lay on the desk before her. Her face was also blank, just like the next four figures behind her. Then came two men, one in red, the other in white. The red-robed man was taller and stood slightly ahead. The white-robed man bore a sword, while the red-robed one held a small halberd.

Closer to the front, just beneath the main seat, was a man in a hemp robe. He wore a command token at his waist. He looked entirely ordinary and unremarkable.

The foremost figure stood beside the main throne, his face likewise blank, his sword hanging loosely at his side. Li Xijun’s gaze moved past him, settling on the main seat.

A single golden circle was drawn upon the celestial seat.

There were seven people inside the hall, yet only the man standing outside had facial features. The clothing and dharma artifacts of the others were rendered in fine detail, but their faces were completely blank. It was eerie to behold.

"This must be Chongming Hall..."

He turned to look at Li Qinghong, only to see her staring at the white-robed figure beside the celestial seat. She said nothing, her grip on her spear turning pale from tension. Violet lightning surged around her.

"Aunt?"

Sensing something was wrong, Li Xijun called out to her twice and quickly stepped between her and the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, cutting off her view as he caught her gaze.

Faint comet-like stars flickered in Li Qinghong’s grey-black eyes. It was as though she had fallen into a sea of storm and darkness. She spoke slowly, "I think... I’ve seen that person before..."




# Chapter 900: Fei Qingyi

The formation in the grand hall shimmered faintly. Li Qinghong suddenly recalled the Falling Water Rising Storm years ago, when she had ridden lightning over the sea. A True Monarch of the Yue Cultivating Sect, Taiyue, had severed a celestial phenomenon with a single slash, causing countless comet-like stars to fall from the sky.

Back then, I couldn’t make out the True Monarch’s form. I could only see a blur of white light. Though the first disciple in the hall also has no visible face, there’s an uncanny sense of familiarity, thought Li Qinghong.

True Monarch Taiyue had attained Fruition, and beings of that level, once seen, could probably be recognized instantly even if only drawn roughly. After much thought, she swallowed her words and said softly, "He simply feels familiar."

Li Xijun wisely refrained from pressing further. After a moment of silent observation, he replied, "The hall in the painting should be Chongming Hall."

"Correct," replied Li Qinghong.

Though the Six Sons of Chongming were renowned, the painting depicted seven figures. Li Qinghong recalled that the Chunyi Dao Gate of the Eastern Sea also hailed from the Green Pine Dao lineage. She had once crossed swords with Xi Chang of the Chunyi Dao Gate, whose cultivation method was rooted in the principle of Taiyin. It was an encounter she remembered vividly.

"The one outside the hall should be the founder of the Chunyi Dao Gate."

The guardian-like figure outside the hall was most likely a member of the Xi Family. The crescent moon on the sword matched perfectly.

She explained her deduction in detail, and Li Xijun, gaining insight, nodded and said, "The Purple Essence Radiant Canopy, the guardian treasure of the Purple Smoke Gate, is famous. The senior in purple robes must be their founder. The one in red likely represents Hengzhu Dao Gate; the white-robed sword-bearer is from the Wanyu Sword Gate; the one in hemp robes must be from the Changhuai Sect; and the seated first disciple..."

Li Qinghong responded, "He's likely the one from Jiangbei."

The two counted and identified each figure except for the youth in green robes and black boots. Since they were on their turf, they knew better than to speak of him openly. Li Xijun carefully examined the image and soon spotted a few lines of text-like markings in the dark green pattern on the side.

Li Xijun naturally couldn’t make much sense of it, but Li Qinghong closed her eyes to concentrate. Drawing on her connection with ancient dharma artifact techniques, she soon deciphered the meaning, "These markings are the unique arcane seals of an ancient cultivator. They roughly mean...

"Jiang Bing, Chen Xuanli."

Li Qinghong explained, "The image on the screen was painted by the former and the artifact itself was crafted by the latter."

Li Xijun nodded thoughtfully, one hand on the sword at his waist, and said softly, "I heard the Chen Family hails from Jiangbei. Chen Taoping of the island at the heart of the lake is likely a descendant of Chen Xuanli. He once used the alias Zhang Cuotian and seems to have made a name for himself.

"Let’s try out this painted screen first."

Li Qinghong said no more and took to the skies with him on lightning. The night was deep. She unfurled her dharma artifact, and the Chongming Profound Insight Screen spun in the air. Mystical wind flowed across the screen as pines swayed. It cast a wave of dark azure light.

"This is Heavy Abyssal Gale, a technique of disruption, specifically meant to counter flying swords and dharma light."

Li Xijun nodded lightly and casually pulled out a golden leaf-shaped dharma artifact from his storage pouch. Though it was merely a low-grade Qi Cultivation Realm tool, he infused it with mana and sent it flying. Sure enough, it began to wobble in midair as it grew harder to control.

Li Xijun had never studied flying swords in depth, but the mana consumption was clearly genuine. He casually recalled the artifact and nodded., "It truly counters the Golden Tang Gate the most."

Now that Jiangbei had stabilized, the Golden Tang Gate had likely reopened its mountain gate. This immortal sect was famed for its use of flying sabers, flying swords, and dharma light, so they feared disruption techniques like this the most.

Li Qinghong changed the dharma seal with new hand seals. The Chongming Profound Insight Screen unfolded once more, releasing several strands of pale golden iridescence that lit up a nine meter radius around them.

She turned and said, "This is Perception Severance, an isolation technique that’s capable of blocking surveillance and obstructing spiritual sense."

This happened to be Li Xijun’s specialty. White mist surged from his eyes as he examined it carefully. After a full quarter of an hour, he nodded in praise and said, "It’s indeed remarkable. Even I can only glimpse a faint silhouette."

Li Xijun’s perception techniques were exceptionally powerful. Once he layered talisman qi atop his eye arts, he could pierce grand formations even at the Qi Cultivation Realm. If even he could only see a vague outline, it was unlikely that any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in Jiangnan could penetrate it.

Li Qinghong changed hand seals again. The eight-faced screen shuddered and formed a circle. All eight edges lit with mystical radiance, forming a bright light barrier that looked quite sturdy.

She explained, "This is Golden Dao, a defensive technique. The technique is vague in the text, but it appears quite solid."

Li Xijun nodded gently. The longsword at his waist leaped into the air, trailing frosty light as it landed in his palm. Naturally, it was the Li Family sword cultivator’s signature technique, Celestial Moon Slash.

Clang!

Li Xijun had formed his Sword Essence and wielded it with ease. In his hands, the Celestial Moon Slash held no trace of moonlight; it felt entirely like his own creation. The bright sword light intertwined with frost and snow, forming a curtain of falling snow that descended softly.

Li Qinghong let out a sound of admiration as the flurry of snow descended. At that moment, the eight edges of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen lit up in unison, and its radiant barrier began to rise. Both were taken aback.

"Huh?"

They saw the fifth screen quietly shift. The once-frozen radiance within the hall painting began to flow. Pages fluttered, white robes billowed, and a longsword gleamed. The sword-bearing man turned his blank, faceless head toward the falling snow.

The Chongming Profound Insight Screen released a wave of dark azure light. The sword light in Li Xijun’s hand suddenly dimmed, and the countless sword essences overhead silently faded. The snow froze midair, as if its spirit had been drained, and dropped to the ground.

Ding dang...

The sword essence struck the screen light and quickly dissipated, sending out ripples. The sword in Li Xijun’s hand twisted gracefully, raising a new flurry of frost and snow that fell like pine needles, producing a delicate, rustling sound as it descended.

"Threefold Moonlight!"

Three streaks of sword light, as pure and cold as frost, shot forth from his blade. They were bright, radiant, and nimble, circling each other once in midair. But before them stood a dharma artifact, not a person, it was a screen of light that revealed no weakness.

Buzz...

The dark azure hue of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen descended once more. The three streaks of sword qi faltered as if they were being suppressed, then smashed against the screen in unison, unleashing a crisp and resounding crack.

Crash!

This sword technique finally caused the Chongming Profound Insight Screen to tremble slightly. Its radiance dimmed a little, and the artifact grew heavier in Li Qinghong’s hands as her mana drained rapidly.

Li Xijun sheathed his sword mid-technique and exclaimed, "What a fine dharma artifact!"

The first two abilities of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen were impressive, but still within the realm of what modern dharma artifacts could achieve. They lacked the uniqueness of ancient technique artifacts. Though Li Xijun had praised it, he wasn’t yet astonished.

But this Golden Dao ability was the true core of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, and it truly gave both of them a major surprise.

Li Qinghong also showed signs of surprise but quickly regained her composure. When she saw someone flying toward them from below, she retracted the Chongming Profound Insight Screen and rapidly descended.

Li Xijun caught up on the wind and said solemnly, "When my sword struck that screen, at least twenty percent of its power had been blunted prior..."

As he ascended the mountain with Li Qinghong, he spoke with emotion, "Twenty percent! If this applies to all sword qi, then this treasure is truly extraordinary. And this is only one screen, there are seven figures on it. Just how many Dao lineages can it correspond to? This is a treasure capable of suppressing a family’s entire fate. It’s far beyond something like the treasure furnace, Cuoxiang..."

Li Qinghong nodded in disbelief as she said softly, "One of the Jiangnan Dao lineages was inherited from the Six Sons of Chongming, while the other was granted by the Moonlight Origin Mansion. If this treasure advances to Purple Mansion Realm, it could likely suppress several entire prefectures of Jiangnan!"

Aunt and nephew exchanged a glance and entered the mountain. The Chongming Profound Insight Screen unfurled, enveloping a nine meter radius around them. Li Xijun murmured, "This might be the only treasure in my family that rivals our ancestral heirloom. Now this is a true ancient dharma artifact. The Water Wall Pearl already requires someone of Water Mansion Dao mastery to use its full potential. With this artifact in hand, every Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator of the Jiangnan Dao lineages would stand two levels below."

His thoughts turned swiftly, as always, and he mused aloud, "They say Ning State has always had designs on Wu and Yue States. The friction has only escalated over time... This Chongming Profound Insight Screen clearly has a purpose! It was made for use against the Yue State, and it even holds specific suppressive power over sword cultivators..."

After some discussion, the aunt and nephew decided to leave the artifact with Li Qinghong. The woman said gently, "Let’s not jump to conclusions. In the future, we should test this Chongming Profound Insight Screen under different circumstances and see if all eight sides respond individually."

Li Xijun nodded, then reported recent household matters. Soon after, a guard outside the hall came forward to report that Li Chengliao had arrived.

Having once served as family head, he still wore his great cloak. Holding a swaddled infant in his arms, he stepped before the hall and said respectfully, "Eighth uncle, someone came from the sea. Jiangqian has returned."

Li Xijun stepped forward and received the infant. The child was calm and well-behaved, adorably quiet as his golden amber eyes immediately examined Li Xijun’s face.

Li Jiangqian was completely unlike his elder brother. He neither looked fierce nor bore golden scales, but was as quiet as an ordinary child.

After examining the child for a few moments, Li Xijun pinched the child’s cheeks and, seeing no sharp white fangs in his mouth, handed him back to Li Chengliao with instructions, "Raise him in the mountains for now. Keep a close eye on him and don’t let your guard down."

The Azure Pond Sect.

Li Xizhi and Yang Ruizao exited Changtian Peak together. Fei Qingyi was already waiting outside the formation. She wore a simple white robe, her long hair flowing behind her as she stood respectfully.

It had to be said that the Fei family was blessed with good looks. Fei Qingyi had bright eyes and pearly teeth. She carried herself with a natural grace that drew glances despite her simple white robe.
𝒻𝓇𝑒𝘦𝘸𝑒𝒷𝓃ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝘮

"Junior Qingyi greets the honored seniors!" Recognizing Li Xizhi at once, she quickly stepped forward to offer her greetings with proper courtesy.

Li Xizhi nodded in return and replied, "Congratulations, fellow Daoist! If Senior Tongyu knew, he would surely be overjoyed."

Fei Qingyi responded politely, "Our two families have shared good relations for generations. I’ve only just barely completed the cultivation of Ni Water Cold, and came right away to pay my respects. Thankfully I arrived in time, or my father would have scolded me for being negligent."

The Yang Family’s spirit boat was already docked at the green hills. She displayed utmost humility, smiling warmly from the beginning. The three of them interacted harmoniously, yet unbeknownst to them, the woman in white was inwardly full of relief:

Thank goodness I didn’t hesitate... I was barely half a quarter-hour away from missing them!

Fei Qingyi had rushed over at top speed the moment she had completed her breakthrough. She had just happened to catch Li Xizhi before he left. If she had delayed for a single round of meditation, she would have missed him, and would have been stuck in the sect alone!

If the main hall chose that moment to settle old scores with Tang Ni, and Li Xizhi wasn't around, with no word from Moongaze Lake, then she would have had no escape in heaven or on earth.

Just as the elegant and dignified man stepped onto the boat and Fei Qingyi’s sense of relief had yet to fade, Li Xizhi turned to her and said warmly, "The situation is complicated right now, and your identity is sensitive. It’s safer for you to leave the sect and come with me. We happen to be returning to the lake."

Fei Qingyi froze for a moment. So it wasn’t just good fortune and coincidence; this man had made arrangements to bring her out. Her emotions grew complicated, and she softly expressed her thanks.

Watching how he turned the situation around so smoothly with just one sentence, Yang Ruizao sighed inwardly and thought, To carry both the Qi and Xiao bloodlines alongside the Li Family... neither of those families are simple. And he’s clearly inherited the best of both their upbringings. Yuan Tuan really wasn’t exaggerating back then; he’s impressive.

As he thought further, Yang Ruizao suddenly realized just how extraordinary Li Xizhi’s background truly was. The Li Family side was obvious; not only was he from the Sword Immortal line, he was also the direct son of Li Yuanjiao.

The Xiao Family head, Xiao Guitu, was his maternal uncle. Xiao Yongling and Xiao Yuansi were also closely related to him by blood. Once he added his own Yang Family, Li Xizhi’s background was truly among the most distinguished.

Since Li Xizhi was one of their own, Yang Ruizao had no intention of exposing any of this. He simply tilted his head to look outside the boat and listened as Fei Qingyi replied softly, "Your esteemed family has prospered greatly these past few years. Our families were once very close, but my father has always been too proud to bow his head. He didn’t want your family to think the Fei Family were opportunists, so we never made a special effort to draw near. But we have always remembered your kindness, and waited for a chance to repay it in your time of need.

"I never expected it would be the Li Family once again who would come to our rescue... I, Qingyi, truly don’t know what to say..."

The Li Family exchanged letters frequently, so Li Xizhi naturally knew what kind of person Fei Tongyu was. He might have believed that Fei Tongxiao had once admired his aunt, but it was certainly not the case with Fei Tongyu.

He said gently, "My family understands. There’s no need for formal thanks."

Seeing how sensible Fei Qingyi was, Li Xizhi naturally asked, "How is Yuanwu Peak doing now?"

Fei Qingyi immediately answered, "The Yu Family fared a bit better, they were only fined some wealth. The Tang Family, however, was locked down within the peak and unable to leave. I happened to be in a cold spring in the mountains breaking through, so I wasn’t involved.

"As for those who were once close with the Yu Family, some still held resentment in past years. But now that Yuanwu Peak has been found guilty of major offenses, all of them have completely distanced themselves."

She understood what Li Xizhi wanted to hear and said softly, "Though many were once close to Yu Muxian over the years, only two truly acted out of vengeance. One died by the riverbank, and the other..."

Fei Qingyi smiled gently and continued, "He was a close friend of Yu Muxian, clearly understood the enmity, and was full of hatred. But when he nearly died guarding the river, Senior Qinghong saved him in a flash of lightning. She didn’t recognize such a minor figure and left immediately after, but he was deeply grateful and sought out her name.

"After returning to the sect, he reportedly grew quiet and no longer mentioned revenge."

Li Xizhi and Yang Ruizao exchanged a glance. Yang Ruizao chuckled and said, "Quite the character, that one."

But Li Xizhi was reminded of Quan Yi, who had once fought alongside him against Tuoba Chongyuan. He had brought Quan Yi’s mother into the mountain peak, an elderly woman in poor health who was bedridden all day.

If I get the chance, I’ll take in a youth of the Quan Family as my disciple, so they won’t have to rely on me forever, thought Li Xizhi.

After a bit more conversation, they arrived in the skies above Moongaze Lake. Li Qinghong and others came on lightning to greet them. Introductions were made, and Fei Qingyi’s eyes lit up when she looked at Li Qinghong, showing a clear desire to be close to her.

After all, female cultivators were rare in Jiangnan, and Li Qinghong was famous along the riverbank after saving many members of the Fei Family. She was straightforward, generous, and dashing—clearly someone easy to get along with, so Fei Qingyi naturally felt drawn to her.

Since Li Xizhi was racing against time on this trip, he didn’t linger. He sent Fei Qingyi home and led the others riding the wind toward the western shore.




# Chapter 902: Western Shore

The western shore was dotted with Daoist temples and cultivation families, and the population was quite large, yet the cultivators lived in pitiful conditions. There weren’t even enough Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators to count on two hands in this vast western shore region, let alone any Foundation Establishment Realm ones.

The Azure Pond Sect didn’t bother controlling Daoist He, but these small families had no such privileges. They had to offer tributes to both Daoist He and the Azure Pond Sect. After five hard years of cultivating their Spirit Paddies, they still couldn’t produce enough to meet both sides’ demands.

So they had no choice but to scrape together Spirit Stones using every means possible. This meant either risking their lives in Mount Dali, serving under the Li or Yu Families, or even crossing the lake into the Wilderness to become outlaws and send spoils back home.
𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝓌𝘦𝘣𝘯ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝑚

These heavy burdens left cultivators of the western shore with no time for cultivation at all. On the rare occasion someone reached the Qi Cultivation Realm, they were sent to Daoist He’s temple to forge dharma artifacts. Thus, for nearly two hundred years, not a single cultivator had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. In truth, there wasn’t anyone with the chance to try.

Thus, as Li Xizhi and his group traveled, what they saw was truly lifeless. Some cultivation families had only one cultivator, who had to go out and risk their life, while mortals managed the household.

However, the Li Family was no stranger to the struggles of the lower class, and Li Qinghong remarked, "At least the mortals here live quite well. Every family is eager to have cultivators, and Daoist He doesn’t demand blood food. He only hopes to raise more people and awaken more spiritual orifices, to gain another laborer."

Only Yang Ruizao, raised in privilege and comfort since childhood, looked closely and furrowed his brows, never relaxing them as he sighed, "Moongaze Lake is truly a desperate land that somehow keeps producing talent."

As they continued riding the wind toward Nine Gates Mountain on the western shore, an elderly cultivator flew out to greet them. Dressed in Daoist robes, he initially looked calm, but as he approached, his pupils widened suddenly, "Four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators?! And two of them are at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm?!

"This is bad! The Li Family has come to attack!"

His legs gave out, and he dropped into a full bow, trembling as he said, "Greetings, esteemed seniors!"

Since Yang Ruizao was mediating this time, he stepped forward and stated plainly, "No need for excessive courtesy. Just report to your Daoist master that Yang Ruizao is here to visit."

The old cultivator fled back into the formation, and a few dozen seconds later, a white-haired elder flew out. His face was long, and his eyes were sharp and bright.

He looked surprised as he called out, "The third son of the Yang Family? Now that’s a rare guest! What brings you to my place today?"

Yang Ruizao responded warmly and courteously, and the four entered together. Mount Jiumen was entirely crimson, with scorching air from the endlessly surging fire veins. They flew into the cave dwelling and took their seats one after another.

He Ting, being nearly three hundred years old, only needed a glance at their faces to guess most of Yang Ruizao’s purpose. He had the old Daoist serve tea, and Yang Ruizao began introductions, saying, "This is Li Xizhi, peak master of Changtian Peak..."

"I know! I know!" The old man responded cheerfully, "Your ancestor, Li Mutian, once joined Brother Tianya in suppressing Mount Yue. His bearing was extraordinary. Though I wasn’t part of that campaign, I heard Tianya praise his swordsmanship often..."

The Li Family members fell silent for a moment. Li Xizhi responded politely, and after a brief exchange with Yang Ruizao, He Ting chuckled. "At the time, Tianya had trouble refining the Yue Sealing Seal. I had him lead troops to suppress the rebellion, living and eating alongside the soldiers until he could complete the refinement. So in a way, I contributed to it too."

"Ancestor." Yang Ruizao began to speak, but He Ting waved his hand and replied hoarsely, "If you’re here to ask me to take action, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed."

He opened his Daoist robe to reveal an empty space beneath. He had been speaking with them all this time as nothing more than a head draped over a Dharma robe.

Yet He Ting looked utterly at ease and said gently, "In order to refine that spirit embryo for the Daoist Master, I completely dispersed my Dao foundation, and along with it, this entire body. The Daoist Master was gracious and gave me a spiritual pill, so this head can still last another three to five years."

The group fell silent. Yang Ruizao paused for three full seconds before saying, "This time, I also came to invite you, ancestor... to return to the Azure Pond Sect and see the elders and brothers one last time..."

"Of course!" He Ting smiled warmly and turned to the members of the Li Family, speaking kindly, "I have no children, and I was as close as a brother to Yang Tianya. I’ve long had this intention. As for this vast western shore and its hundreds of thousands of people, I now entrust them to your esteemed family!"

"Rest assured, Daoist!" Li Xizhi replied

He Ting called up the old Daoist again, saying softly, "This is my adopted son, He Jiumen[1]. He’s inherited a portion of my teachings and will henceforth serve under your esteemed family’s command."

He glanced around and sighed, "Nine Gates Mountain doesn’t have rich spiritual energy, nor are the formations impressive, it's only at the Qi Cultivation Realm. But the fire vein here carries the densest baleful aura in all of Moongaze Lake. It’s the only thing of true value.

"Let Yang Ruizao keep me company for a while. The rest of you may go on ahead."

The Li Family naturally had no objection and exited the mountain together. Li Xijun let out a quiet breath and said, "Now we owe the Yang Family a favor."

Walking atop a rainbow light, Li Xizhi nodded silently. As his eyes wandered over the thunder-wreathed forbidden formation at the lake’s heart, he suddenly recalled something and said, "I looked into the formation markings from the letter. I couldn’t find any record of them, but I did find the origin of those golden talismans."

"Oh?" The two turned to look immediately. Li Xizhi extended his hand, and Li Xijun promptly took out the stack of golden talismans, twelve in total, and passed them over.

Li Xizhi inspected them carefully as he explained, "Si Yuanli personally sent someone to explain. These are shamanic talismans from the Ancient Merging Dao, and it's divided into three types. There's Transformation, Concealment, and Blessing Arts."

Li Xizhi separated them into three piles and said, "In this stack, there are two Transformation, five Concealment, and five Blessing Arts talismans...

"It’s said the Transformation type allows you to take another’s form via blood, though Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators with perception arts can easily see through it, so it’s not very useful. The Concealment type can temporarily block divinations, which is quite valuable. As for the Blessing Arts, they’re complex. It's not something I can explain in a short time."

He pulled out a small booklet and handed it along with the talismans to Li Xijun, saying, "This was given to me by someone from the Si Family. Brother Xijun, you should take a look. You might find them useful, and they could prove quite effective."

Seeing Li Xijun nod, he continued, "As for the mercury drop, it seems to be a fairly high-grade Whole Pill Dao treasure. Cultivation methods of this type are usually difficult but powerful. I already sent a portion home, you could try letting one of the juniors cultivate with it."

Li Xijun took those words to heart. Then he saw Li Xizhi gazing at the distant lightning and asking, "Is the island at the heart of the lake ready?"

Li Xijun answered, "We sent people to search for Senior Liu Changdie. We checked several locations but still haven’t found him. Even the boys guarding his cave dwelling haven’t seen him. It’ll take time to track him down.

"Fortunately, we have some reference materials for the formation patterns, so dismantling the forbidden formation isn’t too difficult. I’ve already invited formation masters from various prefectures, and our family has many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Breaking the formation should take no more than half a year to a year."

# Chapter 903: Raging Thunder Quelled by Earth

Fei Qingyi rode the wind all the way. The lake rippled beneath her as cultivators wearing jade pendants at their waists passed through the scattered islets that dotted the waters. Flags fluttered on both shores. She looked up at the land before her.

There was Milin Prefecture, Jade Court, Glacial Clouds Peak, Huazhong, but all she saw was the word, Li. She hadn’t returned for decades. When she had left, the three families had agreed not to fight within the lake, an agreement personally established by Yuanwu Peak. And now, everything bore the Li surname.

Fei Qingyi only felt a faint chill on the lake breeze. As she made her way to the northern shore, the people who came to greet her didn’t recognize her, addressing her as milady one after another. She simply waited in silence for Fei Tongyu.

Soon, an old man approached. His face was weathered, eyes slightly bulging, fingers maimed, and one foot still bandaged and suspended. He was clearly not yet healed. From afar, he looked utterly wretched.

She had left home at the age of six. And so, much like the current Fei Family, the old man before her felt like a complete stranger.

Suppressing her tears, she followed her father into a small courtyard filled with plum blossoms and asked, "Why don’t I see any of the uncles?"

"They died by the river." Fei Tongyu replied dismissively, not the least bit sorrowful. A ferocious hatred blazed in his eyes, his mind entirely fixated on the sword-wielding enemy by the river. He asked urgently, "Have you confirmed it? That man is Si Yuanli! From the Si Family of the Azure Pond Sect!"

Fei Qingyi felt everything around her was unfamiliar, and the old man before her even more frighteningly so. She silently nodded, while Fei Tongyu grew visibly excited.

His hunched body straightened abruptly as he asked, "Yuan Xiu? How many members does the Si Family have? What’s their strength... their lineage?"

His questions came like a barrage of arrows. Fei Qingyi answered them one by one, a growing terror gripping her heart. Her delicate hand, hidden in her white robe, was clenched so tightly that it turned pale.

There were no questions about how she had walked on thin ice all these years within the sect. Her father Fei Tongyu was consumed entirely by hatred. Fei Qingyi had spent three years on Yuanwu Peak. She had seen Yuanwu grow increasingly deranged as his lifespan dwindled.

She gradually sensed the signs of downfall, but what could she say? The Fei Family dared not associate with the Li Family when Yu Muxian was alive. After Yu Muxian’s death came Tang Shedu, and when Tang Shedu left, there was still Yu Su. For years, the Fei Family had no contact with the Li Family, partly thanks to her own persuasion. But it was all for self-preservation, nothing more.

However, Fei Tongyu paid no mind to her daze. His questions grew increasingly reckless, forgetting the situation entirely, until he finally asked something that sent a chill down her spine. He asked urgently, "How much lifespan does Yuan Xiu have left?"

Fei Qingyi finally lowered her head, closed her eyes to hold back her tears, and replied softly, "Father, that’s the Si Family... do you not realize whose formation lies beneath our feet... don’t you have even a shred of caution?

"You’ve never been to the Azure Pond Sect, nor seen Purple Mansion Realm cultivators... you don’t understand the dread of the Chi and Si Families, nor what the Purple Mansion Realm truly means. Father, that is the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Her words stunned Fei Tongyu. He frowned and said, "Of course I know the formation isn’t right. But who in the Fei Family hasn’t raged in hatred all these years? If it really had any eavesdropping ability, we’d have been destroyed long ago. Besides, this courtyard has its own warding formation!"

Seeing that he completely ignored the second half of what she said, the woman wept as she said, "I’ve seen Tang Yuanwu; he was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. In their eyes, we’re not even ants; we’re tools, and objects. Father, what we think, he can perceive in a single thought. What he thinks, he can transform into what we believe. Father... that is the Purple Mansion Realm...

"Yuanwu isn’t even as formidable as Yuan Xiu. Lord Si is a late stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Fine, say you’ve stirred up hatred in the Fei Family, and in me—then what? The moment I re-enter the sect, maybe Si Yuanli won’t notice, but Lord Si will know instantly, and disaster will strike out of nowhere. It might even be the extermination of our family."

Fei Tongyu’s lips trembled. He snapped and said, "He, Si Boxiu, is so lofty, how could he ever probe the mind of a junior like you?"

Fei Qingyi took a deep breath. Her slightly reddened eyes stared at her father as she said, "But he would. If he couldn’t, he wouldn’t be worthy of the Purple Mansion Realm. That’s what’s terrifying."

Her voice rang through Fei Tongyu’s mind, freezing him where he stood.

Fei Qingyi had come here from the edge of death, with one foot still in the underworld. She no longer had the will to argue. Her eyes revealed her deep exhaustion, and her voice grew quieter, "Father, the deaths of our predecessors were already enough. It was the force of fate. The Jade True Immortal Foundation can be consumed by Shangyuan. He may not do it, but the other sects must still guard against it.

"If not the Si Family, then others... The Li Family is fearsome, yes, but have you ever considered how different the Yu Family’s Yu Mugao and Yu Muyuan are? Why did the Xiao Family and so many other forces behind the scenes all choose to side with the Li Family?

"It was because back then, all who cultivated Jade True were destined to die, whether it be the Lord, or Yu Yufeng. The tide of fate compelled them. You may be unhappy with our family’s decline, but from the moment True Monarch Shangyuan decided to break through to the Golden Core Realm..."

She paused for several seconds, then said heavily, "Whether it’s the Fei Family or the Yu Family, we’ve long been kicked off the table of power on the lake. Our decline was inevitable."

Fei Tongyu looked at her in disbelief, but Fei Qingyi didn’t even wait for him to speak. She hurriedly said, "Now the Si and Li Families are on good terms; they may even join forces in the future. If this matter reaches the Li Family, what will become of us? Li Qinghong is more lenient, but Li Xijun is ruthless and capable. How will he see our family then?"

Seeing her father sitting silently beside the jade table, saying nothing, she softened her voice, "Father... it’s enough... I truly think it’s enough... Please rest well, forget these matters, stop stirring trouble... Leave a breath of life for our family, will you?"

Snowflakes drifted down on Glacial Cloud Peak. Fei Tongyu stood like a broken statue, frozen in place. Fei Qingyi waited in silence. Only after half a cup of tea’s time did she rise and say softly, "Father, I will return to report."

Fei Tongyu remained motionless and unresponsive. The woman paused for half a step, then turned, brushing the snow from his shoulders one flake at a time. Only then did she rise on the wind and vanish toward the south.

***

Mount Qingdu.

Li Xizhi and Yang Ruizao were pressed for time. After a brief inspection of the lake's grand formation, they prepared to depart. Fei Qingyi had made a quick return from the Fei Family and now followed respectfully behind them.

She was strikingly beautiful, dressed in white robes. When a large boat revealed itself in the air and everyone gathered before it, Fei Qingyi bowed and said respectfully, "There is an item that originally belonged to your esteemed family, but long ago fell into the hands of Yuanwu Peak and has yet to be returned. It came into my possession by chance, and I have come today to return it to its rightful owner."

"Oh?" Li Xizhi nodded, while Yang Ruizao smiled and asked, "What item?"

Fei Qingyi lifted both hands, and a stream of white light emerged and coalesced into a jade mountain. It was no larger than a fist, exquisitely carved with cranes and ancient pines, all shrouded in mist. Its translucent glow radiated a brilliant jade luster that was truly eye-catching.

"Jade Smoke Mountain!"

All eyes fell upon it. Li Xizhi took it and examined it closely. There was a faint sword mark halfway up the Jade Smoke Mountain.

"As expected, that mark must have been left by the Celestial Moon Sword, Li Tongya?"

Yang Ruizao sighed, and Fei Qingyi replied softly, "Indeed. This item is forged from Supreme Radiant Profound Jade, incomparably durable and impervious to all forms of mana. Only a figure of his caliber could leave a mark on such a dharma artifact."

Li Qinghong couldn’t tear her eyes away from the sword scar. Fei Qingyi’s words were only half-true. Now that Jade True had been restored and the jade veins were thriving, the Jade Smoke Mountain was naturally immune to ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm mana. But back in the day, this dharma artifact would have been far less durable. There was no longer a way to verify how strong it truly was now.

The dharma artifact held special meaning for the Li Family, but Li Xizhi was in no rush to accept it. He turned to Li Xijun, and the white-robed young man immediately said softly, "This item was once borrowed by Yu Su, so this counts as its return. The Yu Family has since fractured among the outer branches, and only a few direct descendants remain. Most have already married into the Li Family, perhaps it’s best to store it here for now, for future generations."

Though the Yu Family’s downfall was closely tied to the Li Family, ultimately it had been carved up by various outside surnames, and their descendants no longer bore the Yu surname. Li Xijun had chosen a tactful way to put it as he received the Jade Smoke Mountain.

Fei Qingyi finally let out a breath of relief as Li Xizhi accepted it, and quietly settled into a corner of the flying boat. Yang Ruizao glanced at her with mild interest and exchanged a few polite words. The spirit boat started heading south, returning to the Azure Pond Sect.

The Li Family’s forces had already entered Nine Gates Peak, and the various households were being accounted for. Li Chengliao and the others would handle matters thoroughly, so there was no need for the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to make another trip. Li Xijun and his companions escorted the guests out of Moongaze Lake and turned with the spirit wind toward the central islet. Just then, An Siwei approached on a current of spirit wind, with several people following behind him, all bearing respectful expressions.

He said in a low voice, "My lord, the masters have all arrived."

Li Xijun did a mental count and said in surprise, "That quick?"

An Siwei nodded, stepped closer to Li Xijun, and said quietly, "We searched a few marketplaces for those capable of breaking forbidden formations. These few were found immediately, and they came eagerly and with utmost courtesy."

Li Xijun raised an eyebrow slightly and turned to look at the four formation masters. All of them were at the Qi Cultivation Realm, elderly, with unremarkable clothing and middling mana cultivation.

He inspected them with his ocular perception technique, seeing through them clearly. He only relaxed a little when he noted that none of them were using any illusion arts. When they noticed Li Xijun looking their way, the elderly men all bowed respectfully and said, "Greetings, my lord!"

The Formation Dao was as deep as the sea, and one of the most complex among the hundred arts of Immortal Cultivation. If a rogue cultivator had any achievements in it, it almost certainly meant they had no fate with the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Even among the great sects, formation masters rarely excelled in their cultivation realm. Not everyone could be like Wan Huaqian or Liu Changdie. Li Xijun didn’t belittle them for their realm and asked, "Have the masters already seen the formation?"

They all nodded, and one of them even looked visibly excited as he said softly, "To be able to crack such a forbidden ancient formation is a rare blessing for one such as Lin!"

This formation master Lin was the oldest among them, and clearly held the highest status. He followed half a step behind Li Xijun and respectfully said, "We are all cultivators from Yue State. We’ve long heard of this forbidden formation and are all lovers of the art. Years ago, we each came to study it, so we’re not unfamiliar with it. When we heard your esteemed family was going to unravel it, we were overjoyed!

"We discussed it briefly and concluded that this type of thunder-domain formation should be suppressed and broken using items of the Metal Virtue. The best would be to use both Geng Metal and Dui Metal, as these are rare spiritual items that can neutralize thunder."

"Oh?" Li Xijun raised an eyebrow, his gaze turning sharp as he asked, "Our family also has cultivators of the Thunder Dao, and we’ve only ever heard that Earth Virtue can suppress thunder. We’ve never heard that Geng Metal could do the same."

Formation Master Lin paused for a moment. Some things were unspoken secrets of his Dao lineage, but how could he afford to be vague when a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was asking?

He could only explain in a hushed tone, "There is a saying, 'Raging thunder is quenched by earth, remnant lightning falls to metal.' The forbidden formation is the remnant left after the main formation is broken, and thus belongs to residual lightning. This concept doesn’t exist in cultivation, but it does in formation theory."

Li Xijun silently memorized the phrase and thought to himself, Raging thunder is quenched by earth... No wonder! The dragon clan seeks to devour lightning, and it’s often said that Azure Manifestation is of Earth Virtue. Yuan Tuan and Yuan Chengdun both cultivated Azure Manifestation and were considered keys to unlocking the thunder arts grotto heaven. This might be connected.

But even though Azure Manifestation is Earth Virtue, it often gets entangled with blessing arts and shamanic arts... I still don’t understand why...

Since he was silently pondering, Master Lin assumed he was still listening and began his explanation, "To break this formation, one must use Metal Virtue tools, along with several Metal Virtue spiritual items, where half of them should be Geng Metal and half Dui Metal. These must be used together in the formation, and I’m afraid it will require several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators working in concert."

Li Xijun nodded inwardly and asked, "How many?"
𝓯𝓻𝓮𝙚𝙬𝓮𝙗𝒏𝙤𝒗𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝒐𝓶

Master Lin looked a little hesitant. After exchanging glances with the elders behind him, he said nervously, "It depends on the quality of the dharma artifacts and spiritual items used. If there are excellent Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts of Metal Virtue, the number can be reduced to six or eight. If the spiritual items are especially good, even four or five might suffice. But if none are available, then perhaps over ten would be needed..."

He quickly added, "It’s not that my skills are lacking but ancient forbidden formations are always difficult to resolve. If greater convenience is desired, one might have to seek a higher cultivator from a major sect..."

Li Xijun gently shook his head. "Of course I know that. If this formation were that easy to crack, the Yu Family would have broken it years ago and moved into the lake."

The others nodded repeatedly, and Master Lin reminded him, "This formation method comes from my Dao lineage and is designed specifically to break remnants of forbidden thunder formations. According to ancient texts, half of the Dui Metal used will be transmuted into Geng Metal. If your esteemed family has any particularly rare or important Dui Metal spiritual items, you must not use them carelessly."

Li Xijun naturally possessed quite a few spiritual items himself, most of them brought back by Li Xuanfeng. He had originally planned to borrow from a few friendly clans if they were insufficient.

But hearing this, he frowned and asked, "How many spiritual items are needed?"

Master Lin replied, "The more, the better. Two, four, six, or eight. Dui Metal and Geng Metal should be matched in pairs. That will suffice."

Li Xuanfeng had brought back Dui Metal type spiritual items like Zimu Profound Gold and Heartsway Gold. The household also had a Geng Metal item, Black Profound Gold. If they borrowed one more piece of Geng Metal, they could assemble four types.

They had enough Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of their own. There were already four at home, and more could be called upon. After calculating everything, he felt confident.

Yet the formation masters still looked somewhat uneasy. Clearly, it wasn’t the family’s connections they doubted. Master Lin hesitated a few times and thought inwardly, I’m afraid he’s underestimating what I meant by good dharma artifact. Ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm tools won’t suffice. It might embarrass him when the time comes...

Then he hesitated again, recalling the rumored celestial bow. It was said that the man cultivated Geng Metal. The Li Family likely possessed more treasures than outsiders imagined, so he stayed silent.

But Li Xijun was in no rush. A Metal Virtue weapon?

Across all of Jiangnan, aside from treasures held by major sects, what Geng Metal artifact could compare to the spirit bow, White Lightning? It had been empowered by Li Xuanfeng’s full cultivation and refined with the ancient shamanic tool Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman. It was a weapon that truly claimed the rightful position of Metal.

If the spirit bow, White Lightning, wasn’t enough, the Li Family still held another treasure. Though it had lost much of its former brilliance, its core remained something of exceptionally high inherent rank.

The Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token might be worth trying as well! thought Li Xijun.




# Chapter 905: Realization In Hindsight

The Li Family had always been highly efficient. Li Chenghuai had already prepared numerous spirit items and arrived with his entourage while Li Xijun walked along the edge of the island and listened to the formation masters’ explanations.

Unlike the robe style worn by the Xiyue generation, Li Chenghuai wore the pleated garments commonly seen among esteemed family scions. His dark-blue wide sleeves were embroidered with black leaf patterns, layered inside and out with an elegant finish. A white mourning robe was draped over it, and he clasped his hands in greeting with graceful decorum.

Li Chenghuai was not particularly handsome; as a youth, he had looked even more ordinary. Now in his thirties, his steady demeanor lent him a more agreeable presence. Having recently taken charge of the family’s affairs, he exuded youthful vigor and confidence.

"Eighth uncle!" Li Chenghuai said, "I’ve brought all the spirit items. A few clan members and allied families who are skilled in formations came along as well... perhaps they can lend a hand."

The spirit items he referred to clearly included more than just those Metal Virtue treasures, it also encompassed a large array of formation materials. Though they were not very valuable, organizing them still took effort.

Li Xijun nodded lightly and said, "The masters are all here, coordinate with them and discuss the plans together."

Li Chenghuai landed on the island and quickly began conversing with the others. Since arranging the formation wouldn’t be a quick task, Li Xijun handed the island’s affairs over to him and rode Chilling Snow northward toward Mount Qingdu.

Li Xuanxuan was engaged in casual conversation with the elderly cultivator He Jiumen within the great hall. Both elders had witnessed a century of transformation at Moongaze Lake, and once they started chatting, they found much in common.

These aged cultivators had a deep-seated fear of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. When He Jiumen saw Li Xijun enter from outside the hall, he immediately stood up in alarm, respectfully stepped aside, apologized twice, and hurriedly withdrew.

Only after seeing him retreat did Li Xuanxuan’s smile drop away. He stroked his beard. "Fellow Daoist He knows the western shore well. I was getting to know him better. If we send a few of our juniors to study under him, perhaps we can gain some skill in artifact forging too."

Li Xijun respectfully nodded and replied, "He’s eager to draw close to you, my lord. That’s understandable. If you’re inclined to build ties, it would indeed be a good thing."

He shifted the topic slightly, a trace of worry in his expression, and spoke softly, "Breaking the forbidden formation won’t be too difficult nor too costly. But the island at the heart of the lake still needs a new formation. That’s the real challenge.

"Leaving cost aside, with Elder Liu Changdie absent and no reliable master of our own, we don’t even have the opportunity to set up the formation!"

Li Xuanxuan furrowed his white brows. Both of them knew all too well that the grand formation on the island at the heart of the lake would become the foundation of their family’s future. If they were to enlist a sect or immortal family to set it up, it would mean placing their own safety in the hands of others.

The Li Family had seen such cases many times before. The Yu Family’s market had been breached by Jiang Heqian, and outsiders came and went freely through the Fei Family’s grand formation. These were all cautionary tales. The only person they could truly trust, Liu Changdie, had gone missing. This was undoubtedly a thorny matter.

Li Xijun spoke softly, "Besides, this island is far too large. Ordinary formation masters won’t be able to handle it. It will require a great deal of spirit items and likely won’t be completed in a short time."

Hearing the shift in his tone, Li Xuanxuan asked aloud, "What you mean is..."

Li Xijun replied, "Why not wait until the forbidden formation is lifted, then have several formation masters work together to set up a Qi Cultivation Realm formation first? That way, the island at the heart of the lake will be enclosed, and the entire lake can be integrated. As for the main formation itself, we can discuss it further in the future."

He shook his head lightly and murmured, "The disciple from Changxiao Gate doesn’t have much time left overseas. Brother Ming hasn’t said anything, but we really shouldn’t keep delaying. If we miss the timing, it would leave regrets."

Li Xuanxuan nodded heavily. After mulling it over and studying his expression, he asked tentatively, "Was Xizhi’s return this time rather warm?"

Li Xijun paused in surprise and replied, "How could you say that, my lord? Brother Zhi returned despite his busy schedule specifically to resolve the matter of the western shore. He didn’t dare linger and returned to the sect immediately, which is why he didn’t have time to pay his respects."

Li Xuanxuan sighed. The old man was still dwelling on the matter of Li Yuexiang. When he had sent her away earlier, he had sighed about failing to cherish one’s own siblings. Now there was no time for grief, but he still worried about the brothers’ relationship.

He advised gently, "You are different from Ximing and Xizhi. You bear the responsibility of watching over the family, so some sacrifices are inevitable. It’s best if they can understand that..."

Li Xijun hadn’t expected him to bring up Li Ximing. His hand strayed to the hilt of his sword. He drew it, and wiped the blade, shaking his head as he said, "There's not much meaning in your words, my lord. Uncle Yuanjiao told me long ago that managing a household is the same as bearing guilt. This matter was my fault; there’s no need to say more."

He sheathed his sword and took his leave to go find Li Ximing on the mountain. Li Xuanxuan remained where he was, lost in thought. Suddenly, he remembered his younger sister, put down the cup in his hand, and paced around the hall for most of the day, still steeped in regret.

***

In the blink of a few months, several auxiliary formations were set up on the island at the heart of the lake, faintly glowing amidst the reeds by the shore.

Li Chenghuai waited with his men by the lake. Soon, three streaks of dharma light descended from the sky; thunder, frost, and radiant light intertwined in a brilliant display. Li Chenghuai cupped his hands in greeting, while the elders behind him all dropped to their knees in unison.

"Welcome, my lord!"

Li Qinghong had become quite renowned by now. Her thunder had swept along the riverbanks, saving many cultivators. Many had witnessed her thunderous might with their own eyes, leading to her name being spread across many clans, with titles of all sorts flying everywhere.

The Si Family had keen eyes and were close to the Li Family, so they were happy to stir up attention. Thus, the Azure Pond Sect called her the Celestial Thunder Sparrow. But since Li Qinghong cultivated Celestial Thunder and also wielded a Profound Thunder dharma artifact, various families referred to her alternately as Profound Thunder or Celestial Thunder, which caused quite a bit of confusion.

Over the past half year, even the cultivators of the Azure Pond Sect, and Si Yuanli himself had begun using the title Celestial Thunder Sparrow in several public occasions. As a result, her name had become well known, and those present recognized her and treated her with even greater respect.

Formation Master Lin was the first to step forward and respectfully said, "The grand formation is ready. We humbly request the lord to bestow the treasure."

Li Qinghong nodded gently. Behind her, Li Xijun proffered a pale-white longbow and said solemnly, "This was used by one of our elders to guard the riverbanks. It is named White Lightning."

As soon as those words were spoken, Li Chenghuai quietly looked up. The others froze in place, then looked at White Lightning in shock and awe, thoughts running through their minds, So this is the famed White Lightning.

Li Xuanfeng had used it to slay eighteen Buddhist cultivators; it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call it the foremost bow in Jiangnan. Formation Master Lin quickly received it, the bow’s aura like blades across his face. He placed it into the formation and stepped back to observe.
𝕗𝐫𝚎𝗲𝘄𝐞𝕓𝐧𝕠𝘃𝕖𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝚖

Soon, golden energy surged atop the auxiliary formation, with thunder rolling within. Formation Master Lin let out a sigh as he said, "Congratulations, my lords. This artifact is exceptional. Dispersing the residual thunder within the formation will be effortless with the strength of just three of you! It’s only equivalent to the strength of four or five cultivators."

Li Xijun did the math in his head. Both Li Ximing and Li Qinghong were late stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators with profound cultivation. They certainly couldn’t be considered average Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

"Since White Lightning alone is sufficient, there’s no need to bring out the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token," muttered Li Xijun.

Though the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token had lost its miraculous properties, it was still an ancient spirit artifact made of rare material. If it could be kept hidden from public view, so much the better.

Li Xijun merely said, "Let’s begin, then."

Several streaks of brilliance shot out with a flick of his sleeve.

Zimu Profound Gold was roughly the size of a fist, its surface a luminous white and covered in dense patterns of dark-gold etchings. Heartsway Gold was slightly smaller, pale-golden in hue, with no particularly remarkable features.

The Black Profound Gold, made of Geng Metal, was a scattered patch of black. They were remnants from when Chimen Difu’s dharma artifact had exploded years ago. They had also borrowed Ritual Pearl Gold from Profound Peak Gate, which formed a tiny mound of gold grains no larger than rice.

Li Xijun sent the four spirit items to land at their respective formation nodes. Instantly, the central formation’s White Lightning flared brilliantly.

Formation Master Lin immediately rose with the wind. He brushed his storage pouch with practiced hands and revealed a sword at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He raised it high and flicked his finger hard against the sword’s spine.

Clang!

The sword trembled heavily as visible cracks ran down its length, but it didn’t break. Formation Master Lin looked momentarily awkward. He quickly lifted the sword and struck it three or four times against the dharma light at the edge of the formation. Only then did a crack ring out, and the sword split in two.

Formation Master Lin had already discussed this beforehand with Li Chenghuai, who stepped forward and explained with a wave of his sleeve, "This is a formation rite passed down through Master Lin’s dao lineage. It’s said to increase the chance of success."

Li Xijun nodded slightly, and the grand formation beneath his feet rumbled to life. Several streams of mana poured into the array’s core as dark clouds filled the sky.

Li Qinghong nodded as well as she said, "Interesting."

Sure enough, the forbidden formation began to flicker. The thunder within seemed to be drawn by some force and surged outward. White Lightning gleamed brilliantly and soared into the sky.

Li Qinghong continued to channel mana into the formation and watched as White Lightning devoured the thunder in the sky like a great whale drinking water. She murmured, "Residual thunder falling into metal... Perhaps it’s not a phenomenon exclusive to formations. If a skilled artifact smith were to forge a specialized dharma artifact, it wouldn’t be difficult. We should pay more attention to this in the future."

"I understand, senior." Li Xijun had already resolved to keep this firmly in mind. After all, their family possessed a Dao lineage in thunder arts, which was considered prominent even in Jiangnan. How could he not be concerned with such matters?

As the two exchanged words, the thunder in the sky had noticeably diminished. Empowered by the mana of all three, White Lightning inhaled with full force, digesting all the heavenly thunder. Meanwhile, the forbidden formation underground continued spewing thunder upward, but now it was clearly running dry.

After another fifteen minutes, the forbidden formation began drawing on the surrounding spiritual energy. The formation masters had anticipated this and simultaneously activated several auxiliary formations to lock down the surrounding energy, preventing it from being absorbed.

If this had still been the high-grade ancient formation of the past situated in a prime location, these few auxiliary formations wouldn’t have been able to seal off even a trace of spiritual energy. But it was now merely the remnant of a forbidden formation. Unable to draw energy, it began flickering weakly.

Boom!

Fifteen minutes later, the formation was finally exhausted. It let out a series of faint rumbles before slowly vanishing from the island at the heart of the lake, dissolving into countless arcs of lightning and mystic light that disappeared cleanly into the air.

A rich wave of spiritual energy erupted, leaving Li Chenghuai feeling refreshed and clear-minded. As he looked around he saw lush grass growing everywhere and, in the distance, four broken stone pillars still standing at the island’s core. The forbidden formation that had shrouded the island for nearly a century had finally dissipated.

"Congratulations, my lord."

Li Xijun let his hands drop as he exhaled slowly. After calculating, he realized he had expended half of his mana. When he checked on Li Ximing and his aunt Li Qinghong, both had steady auras. Li Qinghong had used up thirty percent, while Li Ximing had only consumed nearly twenty percent.

The two were far more advanced than him in cultivation, so Li Xijun wasn’t surprised. Li Ximing’s technique was of an even higher grade than either of theirs, making it easier for him to bear the load.

The three of them landed in front of the formation. Li Chenghuai had already retrieved the spirit items from the formation. As expected, the Black Profound Gold and Ritual Pearl Gold were not only unharmed but gleamed even more brilliantly, their quality seemingly improved.

As for the Heartsway Gold and Zimu Profound Gold, they had already vanished without a trace. Only the two other spirit items remained. Without even glancing at them, Li Qinghong accepted them and waited until the others had offered their words of blessing before speaking warmly, "Since you all are here, I’d like to trouble you to design a Qi Cultivation Realm formation for our family. One that covers the entire island will suffice. If you need anything, feel free to speak with Chenghuai."

Li Chenghuai stepped forward with a nod, and the few old men instantly beamed with joy.

The reward for breaking the forbidden remnant formation earlier had been modest, and yet several of them had competed to join in purely to hone their formation arts. But this new formation job was truly profitable, and since the island at the heart of the lake was so large, the profit they’d share was nothing small. Naturally, they accepted the task with utmost reverence.

Li Qinghong rode lightning back, landing alongside Li Xijun on Mount Qingdu. Only then did she flick her sleeve and release the two spirit items. One of the spirit items appeared fluid in form, so Li Qinghong’s mana formed it into a sphere the size of a head. It glowed like a miniature sun.

Li Ximing examined it for a while and said softly, "This seems to be Feathered Gold Liquid, a substance of the Geng Metal attribute. It disappeared many years ago. I was only able to recognize it thanks to the Gold Aura Profound Inquiry Technique."

Li Xijun usually didn’t have much time to read cultivation manuals, but he immediately understood. Li Xuanfeng’s storage pouch contained three ancient techniques. The first was Gold Aura Profound Inquiry Technique, the second was Meditative Chant, and the third was Clear Dew Origin Manual. Judging by the phrasing of these texts, they most likely came from the Three Drums Wall of Green Pine Grotto Heaven and could no longer be cultivated due to the disappearance of spiritual qi.

But the Gold Aura Profound Inquiry Technique required Feathered Gold Qi, which was refined from Feathered Gold Liquid. Now that they had obtained this substance, the technique could finally be cultivated!

Li Qinghong nodded slightly and mused aloud, "Having Metal, Fire, and Water attributes is sufficient for a technique suitable for core disciples. If it also includes Thunder, Frost, and Bright Yang, it becomes far less vulnerable to countering."

The other spirit item was only the size of a fingernail, and was gray-golden in color. It was also icy to the touch, and extremely tough. The three of them took turns examining it but failed to identify it. It was likely some ancient and extinct material.

Li Xijun stored both items away, looking thoughtful. He glanced at the other two and said quietly, "This whole matter has given me some ideas... We only converted Dui Metal into Geng Metal to dispel the residual thunder. But thinking further, if we can find more residual thunder, it could become a way to obtain spirit items that no longer exist in this world.

"These items are ancient secrets, so surely some sects still retain traces of their lore. There may be more methods of elemental conversion that could enable core disciples of immortal sects to cultivate ancient techniques long thought unusable due to spiritual qi's absence..."

Li Ximing immediately thought of something and was about to speak, but Li Xijun beat him to it, "Brother, do you remember the Yang Nourishing Technique?"

"Of course I do!" replied Li Ximing.

Li Yuanjiao had discovered that technique the first time he met Tu Longjian; it had been read from a jade slip on his person. It allowed the mutual transformation of spiritual flames. Their family had converted Profound Yang Li Fire into Long Marching Fire Essence through it, allowing their disciples to practice the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique!

Having heard this much, Li Ximing naturally understood. He said quietly, "We only ever used that technique once, and it’s been gathering dust at home ever since. But it’s likely a thousand times more valuable than we thought! Most Fire Virtue techniques that others can’t cultivate... may be nothing to us now."

Li Xijun nodded deeply in agreement. Li Ximing exhaled and lowered his eyes. "He truly is favored by the heavens... Even a random jade slip found on his body contains treasures that ordinary sects spend centuries chasing in vain... Fate, how profoundly unjust it is!"




# Chapter 907: Moongaze Li Family

Li Xijun had remained on the peak for several months as the formation on the lake gradually neared completion. He sat within the hall, reading the Law of the Sexagenary Cycle Sword Manual while Li Qinghong sat with her eyes closed in silent concentration. She was holding the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens in meditation.

She had long since refined these six silver command tokens. Their six streaks of silver radiance had merged into one, forming a misty silver halo in her palm. Thunder rumbled faintly within them, giving them an aura of profound mystery.

The Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens were excellent dharma artifacts, but they hailed from a bygone era, when spell arts still retained elements of formation techniques and shamanic arts. Li Qinghong had limited innate talent in either path, making her study of them quite arduous.

But she was never one to shy from difficulty. She simply held the token and focused her spirit.

On the other side, Li Ximing sipped from a teacup while flipping through a pill manual. Aside from one line of inheritance from the Xiao Family, he did not possess a truly distinguished pill dao legacy. His progress in the field had long since stagnated, and he was merely passing the time.

He had been summoned by Li Xijun early that morning. The date of ascending the island was nearing, and coincided with an ancestral rite, so it was a significant occasion that he could not possibly miss.

After a long moment of thought, Li Qinghong slowly opened her eyes and said softly, "Jun’er, have you invited their family to witness the ceremony?"

Li Xijun promptly replied, "The unification of Moongaze is a joyous event, but it should not be overly publicized. Of the Three Sects and Seven Gates, we only invited Senior Kong Tingyun from Profound Peak Gate, and sent envoys to Mount Yu and Xianyou. As for the Xiao Family, they’ve sealed their mountain, so we’re not sure if we can reach them."

He added in a quiet voice, "Inviting Senior Kong Tingyun serves two purposes. First, we can discuss the matter of the northern shore, and second, we can inquire about affairs in the Eastern Sea."

All three in the hall knew full well what affairs in the Eastern Sea referred to. It concerned the cultivators from Changxiao Gate, which was a source of much consternation for the Li Family. After all, they were Daoists of the immortal sect, and it was impossible to simply kill or rob them. No matter what, some form of negotiation would be necessary.

As he was speaking, a guard outside the hall reported that Li Chengliao had arrived to deliver his report.

"Let him in."

Li Xijun set down the jade slip in his hand as the man entered. Li Chengliao had already removed his heavy cloak. His pleated robes were also black and red, but in a darker shade. A sash was tied at his waist, and he wore a white outer robe. All in all, he looked quite neat and sharp.

Li Xijun had always been someone with a keen eye for detail. Just a few days ago, he had taken note of the indigo ceremonial robe worn by Li Chenghuai.

Now, seeing that Li Chengliao wore the same formal design, he relaxed his grip on the jade slip and said pleasantly, "It seems our family’s new fashion is these pleated ceremonial robes. They certainly have a refined air about them."

Li Chengliao had just finished paying respects to the three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the hall. He hadn't expected Li Xijun to take notice of such a detail, and broke out in a cold sweat.

He bowed and replied, "Uncle, the family has grown considerably in recent years, and with the many peaks and branches, the daily wearing of long robes, though elegant, lacks proper form. When we receive guests from the various esteemed families, especially from Jiangbei and beyond, they more often wear pleated garments, which are much more orderly than flowing robes..."

He offered repeated explanations, clearly uneasy.

It wasn’t that Li Xijun was overly strict; it was the Li Family’s own laws that were notoriously harsh. The family was known for oppressing its own branches and strictly disciplining the direct line. Even indulging in luxury could be considered a crime. The more closely related one was to the direct lineage, the more they were scrutinized. Over the years, many had fallen into the hands of the family chief’s court.

His father, Li Xicheng, had led by example. When he died, his last words were 'Our family has no excess wealth,' which had been recorded in the family’s history. Li Chengliao could not bear for Li Xijun to misunderstand and tarnish his father’s legacy.

"It’s fine." Li Xijun nodded. "Being orderly isn’t a bad thing. Draft a proper regulation for attire. Once that’s settled, it’ll save us a lot of trouble in the future."

He furrowed his brows inwardly. The family rules were indeed too strict, if even the family head Li Chengliao was this afraid. He added a word of caution, "Set a clear line in the family chief’s court as to how far the privileges of each branch’s disciples may go. We may be strict, but our kin should not be wronged without cause."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly in agreement beside them. Li Chengliao acknowledged the order and produced a jade slip, reporting, "The western shore has been fully reorganized. There are fifty-seven families in total, with fourteen Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, thirty-one small peaks and valleys, thirty-two towns, and more than six hundred and ten thousand people."

He placed the jade slip with the records on the desk and asked doubtfully, "The minerals on the western shore had all been sent away for artifact forging, leaving the region poor as barren land. We found very few spirit items; seven families didn’t even have a single one among them. Yet, we uncovered three hundred and eighty-seven cultivation manuals, with only seven being for Qi Cultivation Realm. The number of Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques exceeds the combined total of the other three shores!"

Li Xijun had already heard the inside story from Li Xizhi and wasn’t surprised. He nodded and said, "It was a remnant from the Golden Feather Sect. I’m aware of it."

Li Chengliao relaxed and continued, "Nine Gates Peak has average spiritual qi. Three other peaks are also usable. The western shore could support four prefectures to govern the various families."

Li Xijun examined the records closely. Aside from Nine Gates Peak, which specialized in artifact forging, only the six hundred thousand people and the three hundred cultivation manuals held any real value. The spirit fields there were scarce. Naturally, nothing of note was left.

After checking the time, he had Li Chengliao wait to the side and read through the jade slip carefully. Then, rising to his feet, he addressed Li Qinghong, "Aunt, after a hundred years, the four shores of the lake are now in our family's hands."

He declared loudly, "Our Li Family currently has nine hundred and seventeen Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, one hundred and eighty-five with various unrefined qi, thirty-one in the Qi Cultivation Realm, and six in Foundation Establishment Realm.

"The western shore’s four prefectures hold six hundred and ten thousand people. The southern shore, including Mount Yue and West Pool, has one million and two hundred thirty thousand people. Wutu, Lijing, and Huaqian prefectures together hold eight hundred and ten thousand people. The eastern forest’s vital qi has yet to recover, but still contains five hundred and ninety thousand people. Lastly, the northern mountainous region holds three hundred and twenty thousand people.

"A grand total of three million and five hundred sixty thousand people!"

Li Xijun added an explanation in a soft voice, "The forest has fertile plains, and is the most bountiful region around the lake. Though years of war have left its population sparse, with a few decades of cultivation, exceeding two million inhabitants won’t be a problem."

Li Qinghong finally showed a hint of joy and responded with a soft sound. Li Xijun handed her a jade slip and continued, "The prefecture and peak system has now been reorganized. We have five prefectures and one mountain in the Eastern Milin Prefecture; four prefectures under Nine Gates in the west; and five prefectures in the southern former lands. The Fei Family governs five peaks through two prefectures in the north, while Qingdu and Yuting each form their own independent units. In total, sixteen prefectures, two peaks, and one mountain are all accounted for."

He drew out a map from his sleeve, with Moongaze Lake roughly oval in the center and a slight dip in the south. The sixteen prefectures were neatly divided and labeled in fine script.

Li Qinghong studied the map for a while, her heart gradually settling. She glanced at the others present and asked softly, "Has the island at the heart of the lake been given a name?"

"Not yet." Li Xijun shook his head. He didn’t care much for naming and thought continuing to call it the island at the heart of the lake would be fine.

But Li Qinghong smiled gently and said warmly, "A name like this is not without weight."

Though her voice was gentle, her feathered robe and silver spear gave it a subtle authority. She said softly, "Our family has spent a hundred years on this lake. All four bloodlines have advanced one after another, giving their all. But it was two individuals who laid the foundation of our dominion. First, Uncle Xiangping, and later, my father.

"This island will eventually be reshaped by moving mountains, raising its geomantic lines to rise above the water. We might as well call it Pingya Island."

Li Xijun nodded lightly. At that moment, Li Chenghuai stepped forward to report, respectfully glancing at Li Chengliao before speaking, "The grand formation on the lake, the Pure Essence Harmonization Formation, has been established. I have sent the formation masters back, and the cost came to two hundred and twelve spirit stones."

An ordinary Qi Cultivation Realm formation typically cost a little over a hundred spirit stones, but the island was simply too vast, requiring over two hundred. Fortunately, the family had not paid tribute in recent years and had ample reserves. Even after funding this formation, they still had over two hundred spirit stones remaining.

Li Xijun nodded and had him wait to the side. After another fifteen minutes, An Siwei entered the hall and bowed, reporting respectfully, "The great boats are ready. All the branches are boarding from Lijing, Huaqian, and Huazhong, heading to the island."

After An Siwei finished speaking, Li Qinghong rose from the main seat and descended the steps slowly. "Go and invite the elders and lords. Moongaze is now unified, it’s time to ascend the island."

Lijing Town.

The lakeside dam bustled with activity as the great ship docked at the shore. Bathed in sunlight, it cast a wide shadow that enveloped the crowd below. Everyone on the ground looked up at it.

An old man stood before the ship, extending his one remaining arm. His aged face was relaxed as he watched the people boarding. Cultivators nearby were all busy seeing others off, but no one urged him.

It was only when everyone had boarded that a white-robed cultivator descended from the sky on a breeze. He carried a spear on his back, and his striking features made him stand out.

Landing on the ship’s prow, he cupped his hands toward the old man and greeted, "Elder Qiuyang!"

Li Qiuyang waved his one arm, signaling An Siwei not to fuss. He gave a slow smile and said in a hoarse voice, "Your father is due to return from the desert around now. It’s a good occasion for a reunion."

An Zheyan’s punishment hadn’t been severe. He had merely been sent to the desert, and the fine of spirit stones and spirit paddies had been burdensome but not crippling for the An Family. An Siwei nodded respectfully, clearly pleased.

The two spoke for a while before a few cultivators aboard the ship approached to greet them. They were originally there to report to An Siwei, but upon recognizing him, they became especially courteous.

"So it's the elder!"

Li Qiuyang stroked his beard with his single arm. Though he seldom spoke, his status was by no means low.

Each of Li Qiuyang’s wounds had a story. They were injuries from the market, strikes from devil cultivators, and scars from subduing demons. Every one of them was the result of loyal service to the family. He had lost his arm to Merging Fire while intercepting Xu Xiao. An Siwei understood all this well and stood respectfully at his side.

The sail rose, and the ship headed out onto the lake. Li Qiuyang stood up and looked over the railing. Three streaks of light flashed across the sky in succession.

He chuckled quietly and said, "I remember patrolling this lake with Uncle Tongya. Back then, the area was shrouded in thunder and fire. The Yu and Fei Families were at their peak, and both had Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators overseeing things. How mighty they seemed!

"Yu Mujian even dared to provoke Uncle Tongya publicly. The Yu Family only showed our family courtesy because of the Sword Immortal's face. Who would have imagined we’d see a day like this!"

The old man had seen much in his time and remembered every perilous moment along the way. Among all those boarding the island, he was unexpectedly the most emotional. When the great ship finally docked and he saw the lush grass and fertile land, he turned and laughed, "What a fine island this is!"

An Siwei dispatched attendants and followed him closely onto the island. Overhead, a woman in Xiang-style robes rode a golden mountain through the sky, leaving a trail of brilliance.
𝗳𝚛𝚎𝚎𝘄𝕖𝕓𝕟𝕠𝚟𝚎𝕝.𝗰𝕠𝐦

The old man said with a sigh, "There are several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the sky... Boy from the An Family, take a look and tell me who they are."

His aged eyes were sharp and he could instantly tell that the figures above were no ordinary cultivators. But An Siwei didn’t have the knowledge to identify them by family, so he said softly, "Our family only invited the Xiao Family and the Profound Peak Gate. As for those Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators' true identities, I too am unsure.

"Judging by her Xiang-style robes, that female cultivator might be from Profound Peak Gate."

Li Qiuyang let out a quiet oh of acknowledgment. When he saw a tall platform within the island, he shuffled over to its base. An elder in gray-blue robes rose on the wind to greet him. A sword hung at his waist, and he appeared silent and reserved.

"Donghe!" Li Qiuyang called out, and Chen Donghe nodded silently before leading him inside.

Just then, Li Xijun descended on drifting snow with two others in tow and greeted softly, "Honored elders."

Before he could finish, a middle-aged woman stepped forward from behind him and said quietly, with a trace of melancholy, "Father!"

Chen Donghe quickly raised his head to look and stood frozen for three full breaths before he murmured, "Qingxiao..."

The woman before him, now in the late stage of Qi Cultivation Realm, was none other than his daughter, Li Qingxiao. In his memory, she had still been a child, but now, she had passed fifty.

Father and daughter stood in a daze at their reunion. Li Qingxiao pursed her lips, and the young man behind her stepped forward. His eyes were bright and spirited, and his cultivation had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm.

He bowed and said respectfully, "Greetings, Grandfather. I am Muyun."

Chen Donghe didn’t recognize him at all, but he understood that this Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was Li Qingxiao’s son. He responded with a couple of dry, stiff words. Li Xijun stepped in with a few words to ease the mood and led the group up the ceremonial platform.

Li Qiuyang remained visibly emotional. As a clan elder of the Li Family, he naturally had a place of honor at the high platform during the ritual. Watching as two demonic creatures were dragged up in chains to await the ceremony, he thought to himself, This marks our first year on the island, our family traditions are continuing!

Li Qinghong stood atop the platform, observing the two creatures being dragged into place with a faint smile of satisfaction. Below her, Li Chengliao had just finished the ceremonial rites and was now lifting a jade blade.

As far as the ritual went, this year’s was not especially grand. Many of the Radiant Lure generation had fallen, and the children of the Crimson Palace generation had not yet come of age. As in past years, they had only procured a few Qi Cultivation Realm demonic beasts for the rite. It was considered a modest and proper offering.

The symbolism outweighs the substance this time.

It was her first time participating in the ritual as the most powerful figure in the Li Family, both in authority and cultivation. It hadn’t been as difficult as she imagined, perhaps even too simple, but her heart was far from light.

Watching the rites conclude, she quietly exhaled, Fortunately, today’s talisman pills did not form instantly. They condensed within the ritual mirror and must be sought before being granted. Otherwise, if Chengliao didn’t know the truth, the aftermath would’ve been difficult to manage.

She should have explained the situation to Chengliao. But only those who had received talisman seeds through the Immortal Mirror were immune to divine abilities. The Li Family had gradually entered the gaze of various Purple Mansion Realm sects. If Li Chengliao were to learn the full truth, it might stir unwanted trouble in the end.

The Xiao Family already had a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator back then, and Chi Buzi still dared to question Xiao Guitu with divine abilities. We must be even more cautious ourselves!

Having finished her role in the ceremony, she rose on a bolt of lightning and hovered over the island at the heart of the lake. Below, the northern shore lay covered in snow, with towering peaks while the west was densely populated with cultivators coming and going. The east held immortal mountains and vast fertile plains while the south was a lush jungle teeming with Mount Yue tribes. All these were visible in her gaze.

The azure waters rippled endlessly below her feet. Mist rose over the vast lake, reeds stretched in all directions, and white vapor poured over the landscape. Five hundred kilometers of lake and marsh lay before her eyes.

Li Qinghong thought to herself, This is Moongaze Lake, ours, the Li Family’s.

She stared intently for a while. Then, a streak of golden light flashed toward her. Kong Tingyun, clad in Xiang-style robes, descended from the sky. She first offered condolences before smiling and offering congratulations, "From now on, your esteemed family should rightly be called the Moongaze Li Family!"




# Chapter 909: Suzhu Reefs

Kong Tingyun had always worn traditional Xiang robes, but the color was now deeper and the material far more luxurious. Golden mountain patterns adorned the collar and sleeve edges, while the two shimmering fasteners were woven from brilliant gold and jade.

She was followed by a man and a woman, both at the Foundation Establishment Realm. They appeared quite young and were surveying the surroundings, glancing at Li Qinghong with a touch of reverence in their eyes.

The group flew across the great lake amid a strong morning breeze under clear skies. Li Qinghong led Kong Tingyun down into the hall, where Kong Tingyun dismissed her two attendants.

"Wait outside the mountain."

"As you command!"

The two bowed respectfully and retreated. Li Qinghong, having heard everything clearly and noticing Kong Tingyun's attire, offered her congratulations, "Congratulations, Sister, on taking charge of Profound Peak Gate and becoming the leader of your gate."

Kong Tingyun let out a soft laugh. Her lineage was not considered powerful within the gate, and she had reached this point solely by earning Chang Xi’s favor. It had not been easy, so she was naturally pleased. She returned the congratulations and entered the hall with Li Qinghong.

Li Xijun followed them in. Li Qinghong hadn’t yet said much, so Kong Tingyun resumed in her usual warm and intimate tone, "Qinghong, did you know... Mount Bianyan was broken open by deception? They invited a devil cultivator from the Southern Sea who has practiced this particular method for generations... His name is Yu Jiang.

"The Southern Sea is full of big islands like Lüfang and Songzhou, with very long names. He’s from Danjungwulo and practices the Shamanic Talisman Dao."

Li Qinghong immediately matched the name to the person in her memories and made a mental note. As Kong Tingyun shared a few updates, she gently interjected, "There’s one matter I’d like to trouble you with. We’ve talked about the Purple Mansion Realm spirit item before. Yu Fuzi from Changxiao Gate is still overseas. He has a complicated background, and his master Xun Yizi, Zhou Han, is said to be formidable as well. He entered seclusion years ago to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. The spirit item in his possession wouldn’t be given up easily. Are there any other leads?"

Kong Tingyun seemed to have anticipated the question. She paused briefly, then replied, "When the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven fell years ago, Chu Yi took most of the spirit items. The rest were scattered among various cultivators. The sects laid in wait and obtained many of them. They’ve used some for pill and artifact refinement, but not all. Perhaps some of these sects might be open to a trade."

Li Qinghong didn’t trust the other sects. The moment she asked around, rumors would likely spread far and wide, making things messy and difficult to contain. Naturally, she shook her head.

When it came to the Bright Yang spirit item, Kong Tingyun had first considered trading with the descendants of Wei's Li or Wei's Cui. But standing before her was someone from the Wei's Li line, so she had to change her approach and suggested instead, "Daoist Master Junjian also visited the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven back then. With his skills, he might just have obtained a Bright Yang spirit item. The Slaughter Jun Gate is still in ruins, so why not go ask him?"

Li Qinghong had met Tu Longjian right after the collapse of the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven and had already rifled through the man’s storage pouch. So she had to pin her hopes on Daoist Master Ji Yu having acquired something new.

She summoned the white ape, and just as she glanced at the old ape, Li Xijun spoke first, "Aunt... The Slaughter Jun Gate was only recently founded. We don’t know how deep their waters run. All sides will surely be probing them. If we can’t speak with the Daoist Master directly and rely on secondhand messages, the news might leak."

Kong Tingyun already had a good impression of this handsome young man and smiled. "Very cautious, he reminds me of an old acquaintance. But this isn’t difficult. Daoist Master Junjian will soon visit my Profound Peak Gate to engage in a Dao discussion with our elder. I can ask on your behalf."

Li Qinghong still didn’t hold much hope. Gritting her teeth, she asked, "Sister, you once mentioned that Yu Fuzi had some grudges with your gate. Could you tell me more about it?"

"This matter..." Kong Tingyun took a sip of tea as the golden mountain patterns on her Xiang robe shimmered in the sunlight. She continued solemnly, "This traces back to the Green Pine Grotto Heaven. Xun Yizi of Changxiao Gate, also known as Zhou Han, fought with Daoist Master Junjian over a portion of the Supreme Yin Moonlight before entering seclusion. But he was no match for the Daoist Master. He lost all face and failed to obtain the item.

"Furious and humiliated, he turned his sights on the Qiao Gold instead."

As she spoke, she paused, revealing a round golden bead in her palm and murmured, "But I seized it first. After failing repeatedly, he bore a lasting grudge and came to despise both me and the Profound Peak Gate.

"Later, a direct descendant of our sect, Kong Gusun, passed near their Eastern Sea outpost on Qingzhou Island and had a dispute with Yu Fuzi. They parted on bad terms, and he was killed before he was fifty kilometers away from the island."

When she reached this point, the woman seemed to lower her eyes. But she was quietly watching their reactions. When she saw Li Xijun listening calmly, lost in thought, while Li Qinghong simply nodded without the slightest unease, Kong Tingyun continued in a frank, gentle tone, "Gusun's branch and mine weren’t especially close, but he had always been respectful and obedient, so there was some sentiment. Causing Yu Fuzi a bit of trouble would be satisfying enough."

Li Qinghong understood her implication. The Bright Yang spirit item was something the Li Family had to obtain, but she wasn’t compelled to pursue Kong Tingyun’s grudge at all costs. By clarifying things in advance, they could avoid an awkward situation later.

So she replied, "I, Qinghong, understand."

Kong Tingyun chatted with her for a bit longer before taking her leave. "Daoist Master Junjian will arrive shortly. I can’t stay any longer, please forgive me."

Li Qinghong saw her off. When she returned to the hall, Li Ximing had already been brought up to speed.

She glanced at her two nephews and spoke softly, "Profound Peak Gate’s intentions are quite clear. Their relationship with Changxiao Gate is indeed poor, but not to the extent of assassinating such an important figure. Just leaking his whereabouts to us and lending a hand at the right moment would already be enough to disgust Changxiao Gate."

Kong Tingyun had indeed brought up Kong Gusun’s death, but he wasn’t a core figure in Profound Peak Gate, and even his backer Kong Yu had been down on his luck. They were no match for Yu Fuzi and his master’s standing within Changxiao Gate.

Li Qinghong let out a soft sigh. "He’s one of the most outstanding members of Changxiao Gate. Daoist Master Changxiao is well-known even within Purple Mansion Realm cultivators circles, and the other one, Daoist Master Chengyan, has been frequently seen in public. He cannot be killed."

Li Ximing, listening attentively from the side, said softly, "Aunt, at this point, our only option is to trade for it."

"He might not be willing to trade." Li Xijun replied while resting his hand on his sword, "Even if we do trade, we can’t do it under our family’s name. In short, the odds are slim... Fortunately, the dispute between Changxiao Gate and Hengzhu Dao Gate hasn’t ceased."

"My brother is right. At this point, we must attempt to trade." Li Ximing said softly, "Either we get it from Yu Fuzi himself, or we get it from Hengzhu Dao... Let’s head out first and scout the outer sea."

"Agreed." Li Qinghong nodded and said gently, "Let the white ape watch over the household. The rest of us will ride the wind together."

***

The waves of the Eastern Sea rolled endlessly as three streaks of light pierced through the skies, hidden by a few dharma clouds. Neither thunder nor frost manifested, only the wind carried them as they headed south.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

The Eastern Sea was roughly divided into three sections from north to south, the Unison Sea, the Shallow Sea, and the Scarlet Pristine Sea. The most prosperous region was the sea surrounding Splitreed Island, which bordered the mouth of Lake Xian.

Strictly speaking, it should have been called the Splitreed Sea. However, this area had once been home to the six most densely populated commanderies of Jiangnan before they sank beneath the waves. As a result, the sea was shallow and close to land, hence it was known as the Shallow Sea.

Beyond the Shallow Sea to the north lay the sparsely inhabited Far Sea to the east of the three seas. The Li Family trio looped around and flew southward, heading toward the boundary between the Scarlet Pristine Sea and the Shallow Sea.

"The Qingzhou Reefs!"

This is where the Qingzhou Reefs and the large island of Qingzhou Island which belonged to Changxiao Gate were located. The island resembled a long and narrow boat with multiple peaks and a myriad of scattered reefs around it. Cultivators passed to and fro, spirit boats rose and fell upon the waves, and various demonic beasts swam through the vibrant jade-red waters, creating a lively scene.

Li Ximing watched for a while and noticed a large boat sailing across the sea. It was filled with revelry, and he could hear the faint sounds of silk and bamboo instruments drifting across the water. Several shrimp and crab people stood around in robes, drinking and making merry.

There was no saying in the outer sea that all monsters had to be killed. In fact, the three seas were essentially the domain of the demonic creatures, governed by the dragon species. The demonic creatures on the boat wore robes and bowed with human-like decorum, while the female demons played the pipa and sang. It was no different from humans.

"How curious..." Li Ximing sighed in amazement

Beside him, Li Xijun spoke softly, "Golden Tang Gate’s Golden Sack Island and Profound Peak Gate’s Yuezhou Island lie about two thousand five hundred kilometers south from here. Hengzhu Dao’s Suzhu Reefs is just under five hundred kilometers to the east."

When he heard the name Suzhu Reefs, Li Ximing’s brows furrowed. He seemed to suddenly recall something and became momentarily dazed. Li Qinghong led the group across the sea, her eyes sweeping the densely scattered reefs below. Judging by the scale, the area was far from small.

"Just the islands alone is probably half a commandery in size. If we include the sea surrounding the reefs, it stretches endlessly!"

Li Ximing let out a sigh. He hadn’t been to the Eastern Sea many times and wasn’t familiar with the powers scattered across the waters. Only now did he realize he had underestimated how important the Eastern and Southern Seas were to the Three Sects and Seven Gates.

He glimpsed flashes of dharma light from a battle in the distance and murmured, "It truly is a different scene. We’ve seen many cultivators dueling with dharma arts along the way."

Li Qinghong had spent many years navigating the outer seas and was quite familiar with the situation, so she wasn’t surprised. She said softly, "The inland territories are the domains of the True Monarchs. Each sect’s clansmen live within their commandery, and both spirit veins and spiritual energy are incredibly precious, so they are too fragile for open warfare. Unless matters escalate to a full-blown war of extermination, no one would dare invade a sect stronghold. Most of the conflict between the Three Sects and Seven Gates unfolds here in the outer seas."

Li Ximing looked as if he had suddenly understood. Hands behind his back, he replied, "No wonder Changxiao Gate and Hengzhu Dao have been at odds for so long, yet there’s barely any news from inland. So they’ve been fighting it out at sea."

Li Xijun nodded. His white robe fluttered in the sea breeze, and he gently held his blue-white frosted longsword, Han Lin, in his arms. He said softly, "Changxiao Gate has risen rapidly in recent years, displaying something new every day. Hengzhu Dao Gate, by contrast, has a long history and deep foundations. Both gates’ territories lie among these scattered reefs... they’ve taken the best spots."

Even immortal sects followed a hierarchy, and that was on full display. Golden Tang Gate’s Golden Sack Island and Profound Peak Gate’s Yuezhou Island were far less impressive. They were not only smaller in size but also lacking in resources. To put it bluntly, they were little more than commercial towns.

The group passed over Qingzhou Reefs and descended toward Suzhu Reefs. Compared to Qingzhou, the islands here were more sparsely distributed but much larger. The rocks were a vivid red, seemingly imbued with the aura of departing flame.

The disk-shaped Suzhu Island lay at the center. The marketplace glowed brightly, not through modern formations but through the spontaneously formed scarlet runes, which resonated with the ambient spiritual energy.

Li Qinghong formed a spell seal, activating the Chongming Profound Insight Screen hidden in her sleeve. The screen unfurled, releasing a soft golden iridescence. The Perception Severance effect could only conceal a nine meter radius.

She turned slightly and said, "Three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators descending together draws too much attention. You two split up and scout the surroundings. One to the Qingzhou Reefs, the other to the Suzhu Reefs. Return after a few days."

Both men agreed. Li Qinghong deliberately dispersed her lightning aura and descended on the wind. The grand formation of Hengzhu Dao Gate quickly responded. The red rune flickered back into the island, and a cultivator from Hengzhu Dao Gate came out to receive her, likely having sensed her Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation.

Li Qinghong exchanged a few words with the cultivator and entered the formation. Meanwhile, Li Ximing appeared unsettled as he stared blankly ahead.

Li Xijun studied him for a moment and called out. Only then did Li Ximing respond with an explanation, "You’re meticulous, Brother Xijun. It’s better for you to head to Qingzhou Reefs. I’ll stay nearby and have a look around."

"Alright." Li Xijun nodded lightly and flew northward on his frost and snow aura. The other man remained in place. His fists were clenched within his Daoist robe as he hesitated for quite a while before eventually drifting southward.

Wisps of drifting clouds floated above, and the seawater shimmered in shades of jade and crimson. He frowned and clenched his jaw, glanced at the sky, then continued south for fifty kilometers until he finally spotted a few salt reefs exposed above the waves.

His heart thumped wildly as he flew another fifteen kilometers south. The gleaming white salt reefs became increasingly numerous, and Li Ximing pursed his lips and thought to himself, She once said her home brimmed with Li Fire and that the earth veins were particularly fierce, causing seawater to constantly steam from the reef hollows and leaving behind layer upon layer of salt frost... This must be the place."

Li Ximing landed silently on the largest salt reef. When he sent his spiritual sense out for a sweep, he immediately detected something amiss beneath a large boulder. There was a square-shaped crevice hidden beneath it. An ordinary cultivator wouldn’t have noticed anything, but with his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation, such a small trick wouldn’t deceive him.

He hurriedly fumbled about and retrieved a jade box from his storage pouch. It was elegant and finely crafted, gilded with threads of gold. When he lifted the lid, the sea breeze nearly blew away a small bundle of white paper inside.

Li Ximing instantly shielded the bundle with his mana and unfolded the stack. Each sheet held a portrait of his younger self, mostly cold and expressionless, standing alone in a courtyard. A few showed him seated with a woman on his lap, a pale blue orchid tucked in her hair.

He didn’t linger on the drawings. Instead, he took out the jade pendant that had been carefully wrapped, then swiftly packed the box away. When he held the pendant before the crevice, he saw that it fit perfectly into the hollow.

Just as he was about to channel his mana, Li Ximing suddenly came to a belated realization. He reached up to feel his chin and discovered a beard nearly two fingers long. He hadn’t even noticed it before.

"It’s already been over thirty years!"

He stared silently at the sea. The reflection looking back at him was unfamiliar. It was youthful at first glance, yet his aged eyes gave him away. The Daoist robe on his body lacked the lightness it once had.

Li Ximing quickly trimmed his beard and changed into a new set of robes. But after a second glance, he felt even more mismatched. He looked worse than before. Regret surged within him, Too deliberate!

He sighed. Mana surged in his hand as the stone reef before him slowly opened. Li Ximing slowly looked up. Inside the formation, the most eye-catching sight was a grand red plaque, its calligraphy vigorous and unrestrained.

Two words were written upon it, Meng Mansion.




# Chapter 911: Suzhu

Li Ximing pinched a thread of mana off and flicked his finger, lighting the mana lanterns on either side. Brilliant light spilled forth as he pushed open the vermillion doors. Spiritual qi surged toward him in a wave, whipping his robe into a flurry.

The space was dim, lit only by the faint glow of the active formation. The hall itself was square, no more than thirty meters across in either direction. Lanterns flared on the walls, revealing a few stone tables and chairs casually set about. Formation markings crisscrossed the floor in interwoven threads of red and black.
𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝕨𝕖𝗯𝚗𝚘𝕧𝕖𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝕞

The Meng family's fire vein, forged of bronze and inlaid with eight pieces of scarlet iron, was in the center, emanating a deep crimson glow. Li Ximing quickly spotted a spirit spring tucked into a corner. Its quality was quite poor, and it burbled forth with sluggish, bubbling water.

Ding-dong...

The clear spirit water resumed flowing along the carved channels in the ground, trickling into the quenching pool with a gentle tinkle. He estimated that it had likely been decades since anyone had set foot here. Yet the spirit spring had continued to emit spiritual qi, causing the energy to clog and the springhead to grow obstructed.

Having spent many years in alchemy, Li Ximing was very familiar with fire veins. He placed a hand on the bronze pedestal of the fire vein and, just as he expected, it was scalding hot.

This Meng family fire vein is indeed excellent; there’s even Li Fire mixed in. It’s truly a treasure for refining. Decades of accumulated Fiend Fire in the formation has nearly melted the pedestal.

Meng Mansion had been abandoned for decades. Li Ximing figured that had he come any later, the bronze pedestal might have melted entirely, unleashing a surge of Li Fire that would have devastated the entire cave residence.

When he saw that the Meng Mansion was utterly deserted, he thought to himself, Strange. She should have returned at least once... and yet, not even once?

Somehow, now that he was certain the Meng Mansion was empty, he felt an immediate sense of relief. His mood lightened, and his steps grew brisk. Li Ximing had always been quick to regain his composure and was adept at casting aside emotions. He promptly began to consider how best to handle the place.

"First, secure the fire vein."

One hand formed a seal while he reached for his waist with the other. A small vial, two fingers wide, leaped into the air. It was white-gold at the base and inscribed with intricate dark-silver patterns. It shimmered faintly in the light.

"Profound Patterned Bottle!"

This dharma artifact had long since been passed to Li Ximing, and he had refined it for some time. It converted his mana into Bright Yang mana, which gave off a bright and radiant glow. He formed a seal and activated the formation on the bronze pedestal. Almost immediately, a stream of black-red Fiend Fire burst forth.

This fiendish fire was laced with Li Fire and blazingly intense. It was far more vicious than normal. Yet several wisps of radiant light emerged from Li Ximing’s Profound Patterned Bottle. They descended through the air in hazy veils, like gossamer, and settled upon the Fiend Fire, instantly subduing it.

He had refined the Profound Patterned Bottle, and once infused with Bright Yang mana, the dharma artifact glowed brightly. It possessed two remarkable abilities. The first was Radiant Light, which could suppress evil, assist in flight, or dispel demons. It bore the typical characteristics of Bright Yang, decent in strength, though not especially powerful.

"Better than nothing."

That had always been the bottle's flaw. While its ability to adapt to various types of mana made it rather unique, its effects were somewhat akin to those of an Immortal Foundation and often lacked the raw strength to truly make up for any deficiencies.

Fortunately, its second ability was more intriguing. Known as Unified Qi, it could gather Radiant Light and fuse it with flames, storing the mixture within the bottle for refining. It could then be unleashed in a burst during battle. The longer it was refined, the more formidable it would become.

Its function resembled Li Qinghong’s method of storing Profound Lightning. The longer it was refined, the stronger it became. Unfortunately, once the Radiant Light and flame were fused together, they could never be separated again.

He had grown quite fond of the artifact and wasted no time putting it to use. Forming a seal, he quickly activated the technique. Radiant Light spiraled down, and drew the surging Fiend Fire, tinged with scattered traces of Li Fire, into a pillar of black and red flame that was streaked with glowing crimson sparks.

The Profound Patterned Bottle sought pure Li Fire, but the Fiend Fire was far too muddled. It was ordinarily difficult to refine. But it was effortless for Li Ximing. He gently curled his fingers of his free hand, activating the talisman qi Valley Wind Leading Fire within his body.

The black pillar of fire instantly shrank to fit into his palm. The crimson Li Fire peeled off and streamed into the bottle. In less than fifteen minutes, he had drained the formation of all its accumulated power.

The fire-controlling capability of Valley Wind Leading Fire had yet to show any limits. For most cultivators, this much Fiend Fire would have been overwhelming, but in his hands, it shrank to no more than the size of a fingertip. It would take a whole cart’s worth of ordinary qi bottles to contain it. Only the Cuoxiang artifact back home could manage it.

Left with no better option, Li Ximing simply held it in his hand. He glanced around carefully. Several stone chambers were protected by Meng Family formations. Though they were meaningless to him, barging in still felt inappropriate.

"This place isn’t bad. If time permits, I could return a few more times to extract Li Fire for artifact refinement," muttered Li Ximing.

He made a thorough circuit of the hall, which was pitch-black and empty. Snuffing out a few lanterns, he closed the doors behind him and sighed inwardly, I was born for the Purple Mansion Realm. If I fail, I die. The time is drawing near. I’ll return to make a final push in seclusion with a thirty percent chance of life and seventy of death. I had hoped to see her one last time, to make amends for the mistakes of my youth... but fate won’t allow it. There won’t be a chance.

Li Ximing strode out, rose from the bright salt reef, and gazed over the vast sea. Then he took off northward on his Radiant Light, sudden clarity blooming in his heart, "Talisman qi is a marvel unlike any other. It’s far more than a means of advancing one’s cultivation. If I study it with care, I’m sure I’ll gain much. My family has been famous in Jiangnan for generations and talisman qi has played a part in that.

"If I can cultivate divine abilities and avoid death, then it’s worth delving deeper here. But if I fail to reach the Purple Mansion Realm, then no research will matter."

He calmed himself and scouted southward for a while. Soon, Li Xijun came flying over from afar, riding the wind in haste. His white garments had frosted over, giving him a slightly travel-worn look. His longsword had only just returned to its scabbard, and a sharp sword intent still lingered around him.

Li Ximing immediately tensed and asked a single question. "What happened?"

"Nothing." Li Xijun looked a little embarrassed and gave a vague reply.

But Li Ximing wasn’t about to let it go. After repeated questioning, the young man finally hugged his sword to his chest and said helplessly, "I ran into a snake demon. She insisted I accompany her into the sea to be a guest in her palace. I refused several times. She couldn’t take the rejection and sent people after me. I had to fight my way out with my sword."

"Huh?" Li Ximing was genuinely stunned for a moment, then belatedly asked, "A female demon?"

"Yes." Li Xijun replied helplessly. It was rare for Li Ximing to see him like this, so he let out a couple of questioning hums.

But Li Xijun misunderstood his intent and shook his head. "Don’t worry. I held back and I didn’t hurt anyone. She seemed like someone with connections and didn’t dare make a real move. It was more like a game to her."

"Hahaha." Li Ximing laughed, amused to see him looking so awkward. He teased, "Brother Xijun, you really should stay away from the Eastern Sea. I fear one day, some dragon princess might snatch you away while you’re flying over the rippling Converging Water and take you to the Dragon Palace as her husband."

"Spare me your mockery, brother." Li Xijun shook his head, redirecting the conversation. A flash of pale light passed through his pupils as he noticed something amiss and asked, "Where did you go, Brother? Why is your entire body filled with fire energy?"

"Your perception technique grows sharper by the day." Li Ximing shook his head as he replied, "These Suzhu Reefs are teeming with Li Fire. I happened to find a fire vein infused with it and drew out some mixed Li Fire to refine my artifact."

His harvest had been fruitful, so he felt rather cheerful and continued, "It’s often said that the Profound Patterned Bottle overlaps with the wielder’s Immortal Foundation. But perhaps its creator specialized in Bright Yang and crafted it with that in mind. This ability to merge Radiant Light and flame into Unified Qi—it's quite ingenious! It fills a gap in my own cultivation."

He had mentioned it to Li Xijun before, so the white-robed youth already knew about his artifact’s function.

He caressed his sword as he commented casually, "Consider it a lucky surprise, at least something that complements your path. Though I doubt it was crafted with such precision. Bright Yang cultivators have all sorts of offensive means, from seizing celestial light to capturing flames, that it just happens to match. In someone else’s hands, it might not have been of much use. Fortunately, it suits you."

Li Ximing rolled his eyes. The two exchanged a glance and couldn’t help but chuckle before setting off together to survey the surrounding area.

Suzhu Island.

The Suzhu Island marketplace had a distinctly ancient charm, with most of its structures built in the style of pavilions. The island’s paths formed a dense network, all crafted from crimson stone that seemed neat and orderly at a glance. However, Li Qinghong, who had a discerning eye, took one careful look and surmised it was part of a formation.

"The roads resemble formation patterns, how interesting."

Li Qinghong descended onto a circular platform. She was accompanied by a cultivator from Hengzhu Dao Gate, robed in crimson with golden shamanic patterns embroidered along his sleeves. He gave her a careful look and immediately made his assessment, This person's attire is elegant and refined, yet quite archaic in style. Her dharma artifact appears to involve Profound Thunder. She’s either from a Northern Sea esteemed family or a direct descendant of an immortal sect.

He had been stationed here to receive guests for quite some time and had grown skilled at picking out Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. He stepped forward politely but confidently to greet her, "I am Bi Qiaoyu. May I ask where Fellow Daoist hails from?"

Li Qinghong paused. She realized the man before her was a sharp-looking, elderly cultivator. When she caught sight of the shrewd look he had about him, she swallowed the words 'Eastern Sea' that had been on her lips.

"I'm from the mainland," she said.

Hearing her soft, fluid and gentle tone, yet with well-separated syllables, Bi Qiaoyu immediately made his own judgment, Jiangnan. Likely from Northern Yue or Jiangbei.

He smiled at once and replied, "Since Fellow Daoist has graced us with your presence, I’d be glad to accompany you for a stroll if you're here to sightsee. If you’ve come for serious matters, there’s no need to crowd with the others. You can just discuss matters with me directly."

Li Qinghong lowered her eyes slightly and entered the formation alongside him. She found the place to be extremely orderly. Hengzhu Dao Gate’s vetting procedures were strict, and Bi Qiaoyu had a wealth of experience. She likely wouldn’t be able to hide much from him.

After all, I cultivate thunder arts; it's the least suited for disguise. My aura is hard to conceal... Fortunately, I let the other two arrive later, one after the other. They aren’t well-known, so they shouldn’t be recognized immediately.

Since she couldn’t fully hide her identity, it wasn’t convenient to inquire directly about the Bright Yang spirit item. Instead, she spoke gently, "I may be looking for some spirit items. Does your Dao Gate happen to have any rare treasures that could broaden my horizons?"

"Please!"

Her choice of words made Bi Qiaoyu let out a hoarse laugh. Saying nothing more, he led the way toward the island's center, flying past numerous pavilions until a grand vermillion palace came into view at the heart of Suzhu Island.
𝕗𝗿𝕖𝐞𝐰𝗲𝕓𝐧𝕠𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝐨𝚖

A cultivator from Hengzhu Dao Gate flew up the red steps ahead of them, bowed to the two, then stepped aside to stand behind Bi Qiaoyu.

His voice was carried by a thread of mana into the old man’s ear, "It’s been confirmed. Eight or nine out of ten, she's Li Qinghong of the Li Family from Moongaze Lake, cultivator of Celestial Thunder."

Bi Qiaoyu’s expression didn’t change. He continued leading Li Qinghon through the vermillion hall, bypassing the first floor and ascending onto the second. There, dozens of formation-marked doors lined the area.

He turned back and spoke softly, "These are all treasured panaceas and Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items. May I ask which type you’re looking for? Celestial Thunder, perhaps?"

Leaving her hands behind her back, Li Qinghong replied with a faint smile, "Do you happen to have any Purple Mansion Realm spirit items? My family owes a favor to a Daoist Master, and I doubt he’d care for anything less."

"That..." Bi Qiaoyu was genuinely stunned for a moment. In his nearly century-long tenure here, he had rarely seen anyone seeking Purple Mansion Realm spirit items. But Li Qinghong’s reasoning was sound, and he felt no suspicion.

He responded courteously, "That’s beyond this old man's authority. Please allow me to report to the Island Master. She will respond directly."

This meant summoning Island Master Bi Yuzhuang in person, which played right into Li Qinghong’s plans. She had heard of a past connection between Bi Yuzhuang and Li Xuanfeng in the Green Pine Grotto Heaven. While she didn’t know how deep that relationship ran, having any link was better than none.

And besides, for matters regarding Changxiao Gate... I’ll need someone with sufficient weight to negotiate.

"Of course." She answered warmly. The man behind Bi Qiaoyu immediately withdrew, and the two began ascending the stairs.

Naturally, Li Qinghong wouldn’t let the opportunity slip by. She asked in a seemingly casual tone, "On my way here, I saw some cultivators from the Immortal Dao engaged in fierce combat. Do you happen to know what’s going on?"

Though many liked to call Hengzhu Dao Gate part of the Immortal Gates, the Bi Family had never officially claimed that status. They only referred to themselves as part of the Immortal Dao.

Li Qinghong’s repeated use of the correct term pleased Bi Qiaoyu, and he inwardly affirmed, Someone this familiar with our terminology, she’s definitely from the Li family of Moongaze Lake.

He let out a long sigh and explained, "What else could it be? Our gate has long been at odds with Changxiao Gate. Years ago, Changxiao and our Daoist Master Hengli clashed over a cultivation opportunity. That battle was so fierce it nearly tore the sky apart. It only ceased after several other Daoist Masters intervened to mediate.

"Later, Jiangnan was reclassified as the Upper Evil Spirit Storage, leading to the rise of Earth Virtue devil cultivators. Daoist Master Chengyan happened to get lucky and successfully cultivated Wu Earth. Since Earth Virtue phenomena are notoriously hard to detect, he broke through in secret under Changxiao’s protection and killed several of our core disciples. Then, he was wounded by Daoist Master Hengxing. With old grudges and new, there’s no reconciling them now."

Li Qinghong silently memorized the detail about Daoist Master Chengyan cultivating Wu Earth. She furrowed her brow slightly; the conflict between the two reef territories in the Eastern Sea didn't seem all that intense.

She asked deliberately, "I see. And since Qingzhou and Suzhu are so close, it must be tense most days."

"Isn’t that the truth..." Though Bi Qiaoyu was an elder cultivator, the reason she’d asked about the spirit item related to Yu Fuzi was too indirect. He was far from being able to piece it together from just a few of Li Qinghong’s words. He sighed. "Exactly... I’m over two hundred now, far too old to care for more conflict. Wouldn’t a little harmony be nice? But the young and hot-blooded Yu Fuzi doesn’t think that way.

"Just half a year ago, he struck again in the Eastern Sea, quietly killing several of our disciples and even wiping out a spirit boat. The Island Master sent a few rogue cultivators to question him, but he shamelessly denied everything, then arrogantly drove them off!"

Bi Qiaoyu let out a breath, his voice tinged with anger as he continued, "He's just like his master, no good at all! Always so quick to take lives... and always targeting the younger generation with hidden attacks!"

Li Qinghong felt a subtle relief rise in her heart as she thought to herself, Good... the conflict between the two sides is indeed intense. I don’t know Island Master Bi Yuzhuang well, and persuading her would’ve been difficult. This way, I’ll save myself the trouble.

She waited in the hall until a female cultivator draped in a red robe landed before the palace. Her skin was fair and tender, and her features were distinct from those of Jiangnan. She had higher brows and larger eyes, while the bright red robe made her look all the more dazzling.

She wore pale moon-colored inner garments beneath her vibrant red robe, paired with golden bangles at her sleeves, further elevating her refined aura. Both eyes twinkled as she smiled and said, "I am Bi Yuzhuang. Greetings, fellow Daoist. Might you be from the Moongaze Li Family?"

"I am Li Qinghong of the Moongaze Li Family. Greetings, senior," Li Qinghong responded naturally. Beside her, Bi Qiaoyu clasped his hands and swiftly withdrew.

Bi Yuzhuang made a 'please' gesture, the golden bangles on her wrist jingling as she smiled and said, "You are too polite, Qinghong. Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng and I fought side by side at Green Pine Temple and share some camaraderie."

Bi Yuzhuang led her all the way to the highest crimson pavilion. It contained only a red-lacquered wooden table, upon which sat a jade vase with a few diagonally arranged white plum blossoms.

The two of them sat down. Bi Yuzhuang poured some tea and said gently, "Daoist Master Chang Yun of Jiangbei used the Golden Feather Sect’s favor to establish a gate in Chengshui Marsh and called it Chengyun Gate. He even claimed a territory for it. The Golden Tang Gate has also reopened its mountain gate and begun sending disciples down the mountain.

"The current sect leader of Chengyun Sect is Zhong Qian. He shares a deep friendship with Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng. Your family could consider sending someone to establish that connection."

Bi Yuzhuang finished steeping the tea, glanced at her, and smiled. "I worried that you’ve been away from the mainland too long and might not be up to date, so I thought I’d offer a word."

Li Qinghong quickly said she wouldn’t dare. Her heart warmed toward Bi Yuzhuang, and she silently thought, Hengzhu Dao is after all one of the most orthodox among the great Daos... and since they’re on friendly terms with my family, she should be trustworthy.

After a few casual exchanges, Bi Yuzhuang soon brought the conversation around to the topic at hand. "The Purple Mansion Realm spirit items you need on this island, Qinghong, are known best by me. Though the Eastern Sea now surges with thunder, if you're seeking items like Celestial Thunder Blossom or Cloud-Patterned Heavenly Lightning, my family can't retrieve them at the moment."

It was clear that the excuse Li Qinghong used—repaying a favor for a Purple Mansion Daoist Master—had fooled Bi Qiaoyu, but not Bi Yuzhuang, who was a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. She had been probed from her first words.

Fortunately, Li Qinghong had not come for her own cultivation path, and she replied gently, "Thank you for your concern, Senior. It doesn’t have to be Celestial Thunder. Are there any other Purple Mansion Realm spirit items available?"

"Hmm?" Bi Yuzhuang appeared slightly surprised. She raised an eyebrow as a thoughtful expression crossed her face, then casually said, "Items like Quetong Radiance or Sea-Treading Rainbow are mostly found among the Dragon Clan or in Mount Luoxia... Fortunately, my family does possess a Heaven-Guarding Rainbow, which fell during the Northern Sea’s Sky Fracture. It’s rather valuable."

Bi Yuzhuang had already read through the intelligence on the Li Family. She had originally intended to mention that her family also possessed a Purple Mansion Realm Cold Essence, but after recalling from the reports that Li Xijun was still far from the Purple Mansion Realm, she reconsidered. If she exposed Li Qinghong’s excuse too directly, the conversation might end, and she would gain nothing from it.

But Li Qinghong understood from her words that Bi Yuzhuang had clearly assumed her family intended to seize a Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough. She silently turned her teacup without replying.

Sensing something amiss, Bi Yuzhuang simply followed up smoothly and said, "We don’t have Bright Yang either. Only one Cold Essence, one Radiant Essence, and a piece of Azure Manifestation."

No Bright Yang either... Li Qinghong fell silent for a moment, her mind cycling through various ideas before she asked, "If one wished to trade for these spirit items, what would be the terms?"

Bi Yuzhuang lifted her chin slightly and said gently, "Rest assured, Qinghong. My family has always conducted ourselves uprightly and has no need for tricks... It’s just that Purple Mansion Realm spirit items are exceedingly rare. If a trade is to be made... considering your family’s situation, there are a few things that might be viable."

She sipped her tea and continued, "A Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact, ancient Purple Mansion Realm spirit items, cultivation methods from the Hengzhu Dao lineage of the Purple Mansion Realm, and..."

The woman raised her brow and lightly rested her jade-like fingers on the edge of the gold bangle on her other wrist as she tested, "Supreme Yin Moonlight!"

Li Qinghong held her breath, then showed a look of regret and replied with a hint of dejection, "The Immortal Dao still assumes that since our family occupies Moongaze Lake, we must have such a thing... Even if we once truly had a portion, those days are long gone."

Bi Yuzhuang looked a bit embarrassed as she quickly explained, "After all, someone did obtain it from the lake in the past. It’s recorded in the annals of many families. I merely asked in passing."

Li Qinghong did not wish to dwell on the subject and simply nodded in response, "I’ve taken note of your terms, Senior. If our family is able, we will certainly come to trade with the Immortal Dao."

Hengzhu Dao Gate lacking a Bright Yang spirit item was within expectations. Ultimately, Li Qinghong could only pin her hopes on Yu Fuzi. After carefully choosing her words, she asked, "I heard from Senior Qiaoyu that Yu Fuzi has become quite unruly..."

Bi Yuzhuang visibly frowned at the name. Gazing at the white plum blossoms in the vase, she said with some regret, "He’s indeed formidable. The conflict between my gate and Changxiao has lasted a long time. We once entrapped and killed Yunkongzi, but thinking back now, if we had known that Yu Fuzi would follow him, we would’ve spared that useless man’s life..."

There were too many blood debts between the two sides, so Bi Yuzhuang couldn’t go into detail. She simply recounted the general grievances between them.

Li Qinghong understood the situation and inwardly sighed with regret, Bi Yuzhuang’s struggle with Yu Fuzi hasn’t yet reached the point where she’s desperate. Our ties aren’t close enough for her to ask for my help directly either. Otherwise, she’d have offered far more in return.

So be it. Nothing in this world is ever truly perfect.

She let a troubled expression fall across her face as she said in a low voice, "To speak frankly, Senior... He possesses a treasure that is of great importance to my family..."

As soon as those words were spoken, Bi Yuzhuang's expression lit up. Her heart finally cleared, and she suddenly understood, So that’s how it is!

Now even her gaze turned fervent as she said in a low voice, "Your esteemed family means to..."

Li Qinghong sighed and probed, "This is the Eastern Sea, after all. Everything is much easier to handle here, only Daoist Master Changxiao is of concern..."

Bi Yuzhuang shook her head repeatedly and replied quickly, "Qinghong, there’s no need to worry! Our gate’s Daoist Master Shanzhu is far stronger than Chang Xiaozi. Moreover, Chang Xiaozi is not on good terms with Crimson Reef Island and rarely comes to the Eastern Sea. As for Changxiao Gate, they have very few Purple Mansion cultivators. Daoist Master Chengyan rarely leaves the mountain gate, so how could he possibly oversee everything?

"As long as we lure Wang Fu into the grand formation I’ve set and invite Daoist Master Hengxing to offer a blessing, it can all be covered up cleanly as long as no other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators steps in."

Her voice dropped slightly, but her eyes were sharp as she continued, "And even if Changxiao Gate finds out, so what? We’re merely hiring fellow Daoists to act. Your esteemed family has ties to Daoist Master Xiao, and this even nominally falls under the Azure Pond Sect's jurisdiction. What is there to fear? The person dies in the Eastern Sea, and the Eastern Sea has its own rules. Changxiao won’t dare to intervene!"

Li Qinghong understood that despite how nicely she phrased it, this would undoubtedly offend Changxiao Gate. But her family was already mentally prepared for this.

She answered softly, "You are right, Senior."

Delight danced across Bi Yuzhuang’s face. The two gates had schemed against each other for years and were well-acquainted. Moreover, the island masters on both sides were extremely strong and never strayed far from their islands, so it was hard to gain any advantage.

Her own forces stationed in the trading markets were limited and not of high quality. Even if she mobilized them for an ambush, there was no guarantee they could deal with Yu Fuzi. That old thing wouldn’t show himself if he saw a crowd lying in wait.

But Li Qinghong was a formidable combatant with violent and explosive lightning. She was also skilled in swift battles, and so an ideal candidate. So Bi Yuzhuang asked, "How many people can your esteemed family send?"

Li Qinghong replied quietly, "Aside from myself, Ximing is adept at suppression, and Xijun has refined his Sword Essence. The two complement each other and are quite formidable... If things don’t go smoothly, we can dispatch more."

"That’s enough." Bi Yuzhuang let out a heavy breath. Now, whether or not Daoist Master Chengyan of Changxiao Gate had returned to the sect, she felt she had enough control. She immediately replied, "Qinghong, go and make preparations. I will plan everything in detail!"

Li Qinghong rose from the table and took her leave. Bi Yuzhuang immediately summoned someone to escort her. The red-robed woman sipped several mouthfuls of tea and gradually gained clarity in her thoughts.

The Li Family has grown closer to Profound Peak Gate in recent years. Profound Peak Gate likely played a part in steering things, but this could be a good development... In that case, Kong Tingyun’s recent diplomatic easing with Changxiao Gate over Yuezhou Island wasn't a true compromise, but a ploy to lull Wang Fu into complacency...

Bi Yuzhuang had been troubled over the lack of powerful combatants, but now she had gained a direct descendant thunder cultivator of immortal sect pedigree, a late stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator with an Immortal Foundation focused on suppression, and a slightly lower-ranked sword sect descendant. And she herself was one of Hengzhu Dao Gate’s top Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators...

Unless you, Wang Fu, are the second coming of Li Xuanfeng... you will surely suffer this death calamity! Thought Bi Yuzhuang.

————

After settling down in the market district, Li Qinghong was soon approached by Li Xijun and Li Ximing. When the two entered the cave dwelling, Li Qinghong immediately motioned for them to stop and said softly, "This is someone else's cave dwelling. Best not to speak too much."

She flicked her sleeve and tossed out the Chongming Profound Insight Screen. The mystical screen unfurled, releasing several faint golden iridescent rays that enveloped a nine meter radius around them.

Only after the Perception Severance activated did Li Xijun speak in a low, steady voice, "Aunt, I went to Qingzhou Island. Yu Fuzi wasn’t there. I asked around and found that he’s been residing on Xifeng Island nearby. He's occupying an entire island for himself to cultivate in solitude.

"Wang Fu places great importance on family background and loves to boast. Ordinary rogue cultivators can’t even get an audience with him. If we want to purchase the spirit item, we’d likely have to announce our name to gain a meeting.

"He also has quite a foul temperament. From what I can gather, the families close to ours are all on bad terms with Changxiao Gate. He might name an outrageous price and humiliate us for nothing."

The longsword strapped to his back shifted as he said gravely, "We shouldn’t pin our hopes on that. Aligning with Hengzhu Dao Gate is the more reliable choice."

"I’ve heard the same." Li Qinghong appeared somewhat troubled and replied softly, "So long as our family contributes, Hengzhu Dao Gate has promised to cover for us. But it’s hard to be certain. If the situation turns against us... If Yu Fuzi lives, we simply fail to get the spirit item. But if he dies, we fail to obtain the item, and Changxiao Gate discovers our involvement, that would be the most disgraceful outcome."

She shook her head and said, "Our family has good relationships with several immortal gates; Daoist Master Xiao has received us personally; we still hold a favor with Daoist Master Junjian; and we’re quite close with the Si Family. A major incident is unlikely, but we must always prepare for the worst."

Li Qinghong hesitated for a moment, then said softly, "If Changxiao Gate acts overbearingly and insists on settling scores, and the Hengzhu Dao Gate's Daoist Masters cannot be relied upon; if Bi Yuzhuang proves to be two-faced and only seeking to deceive us; if Daoist Master Xiao refuses to intervene and Daoist Master Junjian is too newly advanced to Purple Mansion Realm to be respected by Changxiao... then, at that moment, if I must become the scapegoat, I’ll simply accept death. That would satisfy Changxiao Gate’s pride, and they’d have nothing more to say."

Though her words were softly spoken, they struck like thunder. Li Ximing abruptly raised his head, heart burning like fire.

Beside him, Li Xijun cupped his hands and first reassured Li Ximing, "It will never come to that. Hengzhu Dao Gate has stood on the righteous path for many years. They wouldn’t abandon their stance over something so small. Chang Xiaozi and Hengzhu Dao Gate have long contended in the Eastern Sea. At most, he’ll hold a grudge for losing a move, he wouldn’t go so far as to shatter a piece on the board."

He then continued, "In my view, as long as Hengzhu Dao Gate takes the lead, killing Yu Fuzi won’t be an issue. No need to worry. In fact, I have some good news to report..."

Seeing both Li Qinghong and Li Ximing turn to look at him, he explained, "I was previously worried the Radiant Sky Stone may no longer be on Yu Fuzi’s person! Even though Changxiao Gate is full of vitality and wouldn’t normally seize a junior’s possession, we’re talking about a Purple Mansion Realm spirit item! Couldn’t Chengyan and Changxiao have already taken or exchanged it long ago?

"And even if they haven’t taken it, Yu Fuzi may not be carrying it around. Wouldn’t storing it within the gate be much safer?"

His words struck both listeners like a jolt. Kong Tingyun had mentioned earlier that the item was on Yu Fuzi’s person. Though Yu Fuzi was known for his overbearing nature, what Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator wouldn't bow their head before a Purple Mansion Realm?

Li Ximing felt a headache coming on and said, "This complicates things..."

Li Xijun exhaled softly and replied, "Fortunately, Purple Mansion Realm spirit items aren’t easy to store. Not everyone possesses jade boxes like ours that can contain them before placing them into a storage pouch. Most jade boxes used for such items are like essence-collecting vessels and must be worn close to the body or kept within a formation."

Li Qinghong immediately caught on and gave a subtle nod. As expected, Li Xijun cupped his hands respectfully and said, "Please forgive me, Aunt. I acted without prior notice and used a treasure from the great void to investigate Xifeng Island."

Li Qinghong merely shook her head and said, "What's there to forgive? Don't keep your brother in suspense. Is it there or not?"

Li Xijun smiled gently and replied, "It is!"

Li Ximing immediately let out a breath of relief. His interest was piqued, and he quickly pressed for details.

The white-robed youth smiled and said, "I investigated the island. Wang Fu’s palace is filled with female companions, and is lively and bustling. The treasure is stored in a box made of black jade and placed right on the table in his hall."

"You’re sure you saw it clearly?" Li Ximing asked.

Li Xijun chuckled lightly, "Of course I saw it clearly. I’ve seen the Golden Yang Radiant Origin before. It cannot be seen through gold or iron, and if exposed to copper, water, or wood, it turns to smoke. That’s why it must be sealed in jade or stone boxes.

"There was a white stone the size of a pupil inside the black jade box. It was filled with celestial radiance, and interlaced with dazzlingly bright flames. Its aura belonged to the Bright Yang attribute, so it must be the Radiant Sky Stone!"

Li Ximing finally relaxed at the description. He glanced at the smile on Li Qinghong’s face and shook his head. "Then all is in place. Let’s just hope everything goes smoothly, and that it doesn’t turn for the worse."

Li Xijun nodded with a smile, but suspicion stirred in his heart. Ever cautious and prone to overthinking, he couldn’t help but wonder, There’s just one thing... Rationally, that item would be safest within the gate... So why bring it to the Eastern Sea? And why place it so openly on a table? Could he be using it for some spell cultivation?




# Chapter 915: A Joyous Occasion

Just as Li Xijun and the others were deep in discussion, the jade seal on the stone table shimmered faintly. It was a sign that someone had arrived outside the cave dwelling.

Li Qinghong activated a spell, causing the Chongming Profound Insight Screen to return to its original form. She stored it within her sleeve, opened the stone door, and saw Bi Yuzhuang enter with a smile.

Glancing at the Li brothers, she said, "Your esteemed family truly is brimming with talent!"

Li Xijun thanked her respectfully. Bi Yuzhuang made a few casual inquiries but clearly hadn’t come just for small talk. Her expression turned serious as she lowered her voice and said, "The affairs of Hengzhu Dao Gate have been arranged. If you’re free, allow me to explain."

She pulled out a maritime map from her sleeve and spread it out. "As defenders of these sea islands, we’re meant to remain stationed at the main island and make our presence known. But although Wang Fu is powerful, he is outrageously indulgent and lustful. Rather than guarding the main hall on Qingzhou Island, he relocated and constructed a grand palace on Xifeng Island. Only a few close confidants come and go, making his whereabouts difficult to track.

"Fortunately, he’s quite attentive to the reefs near Qingzhou Island. Despite his debauchery, he never skips his inspections of the reefs. He frequently sails with his favored concubines, often unclothed, seeking pleasure across the sea..."

Clearly familiar with the man, Bi Yuzhuang said softly, "Our gate possesses a dharma artifact called Flow Water Conch, forged from the body of a demonic creature that failed to ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm. While it lacks offensive power, it can manipulate water currents."

What a treasure!

Li Qinghong was quietly envious. Manipulating water currents was entirely different from mere water control. With this treasure, one could reach frightening speeds along the seafloor, as if they were riding the current itself.

"This artifact leaves no trace of mana. We’ll first stir the water currents to draw him north. Then, we’ll stage a battle between a demon general and a rogue cultivator, feigning a chase over a Lesser Yang spirit item. He certainly won’t miss such an event and will pursue them."

After hearing this, Li Qinghong paused to think, then replied, "I’ve heard he possesses a bell, a sword, and a pearl. The bell is called Morning Wu, capable of seizing the spirit; the sword, Level Beam, is a Lesser Yang treasure; and the pearl, Gathered Clarity, can perceive things near and far. We’ll need to be cautious."

Since the Li Family was also determined to seize the item, they naturally wanted nothing to go wrong. Li Xijun reminded softly, "Senior, Wang Fu is indeed formidable. It’s said he’s adept at reading others. Typical chase-and-deception tactics may not fool him."

Li Qinghong had learned this through hearsay, but Li Xijun had observed Wang Fu’s behavior firsthand. His reminder was deliberate. Bi Yuzhuang nodded and thought to herself, So the Li Family has studied the man this thoroughly... It seems they’ve long had designs on what Wang Fu possesses.

She smiled. "Naturally. To prevent him from seeing through the ruse, the rogue cultivator is being deliberately lured into the act. The demon general is a carefully selected fish demon, and that demonic creature knows nothing about the real plan."

A sly glint appeared in Bi Yuzhuang’s eyes as she quietly said, "Once he obtains the treasure and is pursued by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, he’ll surely flee to his demon den. We only need to adjust the currents so that his concubines' spirit boats head north. They’ll definitely run into each other along the way.

"Wang Fu is infamous and ruthless. When the fish demon sees him, he’ll realize he won’t make it back to the den. He’ll flee in the opposite direction from Qingzhou, hoping Wang Fu will worry about the main island and let him go."

She said softly, "That way, everything appears genuine. The more he observes, the more convincing it becomes. All we need to do is lie in ambush opposite of Qingzhou Island. My gate also has a dharma artifact called Tidal Veil, which excels at concealing movement and evading detection."

Li Qinghong reviewed Bi Yuzhuang’s plan once again and replied, "It can't have been easy selecting that fish demon. Sorry for the trouble, Senior."

Bi Yuzhuang let out a soft laugh and responded, "Don’t worry. This fish demon is clever enough and fast in water escape. Only one like that is worthy of being used as a chess piece. Ordinary weaklings wouldn’t be fit for the role."

After going over a few more details, she said, "Wait just a few days. On the day Wang Fu leaves the island, a few of my elders will bless your team with our sect’s blessing arts, it’ll give us greater assurance."

Li Ximing and Li Xijun stepped out of the cave dwelling. Outside, the pavilion towered high, and below it, the crowds bustled under warm, golden sunlight.

Li Xijun was still lost in thought, though none of it showed on his face. Li Ximing, however, was growing increasingly burdened in spirit. He glanced at his younger brother and asked, "Do you have anything planned for now, Xijun?"

"Nothing urgent," Li Xijun answered casually, shifting the sword on his back into his arms. His gaze swept across the faces of passersby on the street, and he said quietly, "Hengzhu Dao Gate does have a solid reputation. Judging by the attire in this market, there are more rogue and family-affiliated cultivators here than in Qingzhou Island’s market. No matter where the Three Sects and Seven Gates land, Purple Mansion Realm immortal families won’t be treated badly. You can’t tell much on the surface, but rogue cultivators are shrewd. They always know where safety lies."

Li Ximing followed Li Xijun’s gaze. Li Xijun softly advised, "Brother, there’s no need to worry. We’ll do our best. I’ll go inspect the island for now."

Holding his sword, he slipped out through the side of the pavilion and made his way through the market streets, pulling out a map as he went.

The waters surrounding Qingzhou and Hengzhu Reefs were vast. The closest islands were Golden Sack Island and Yuezhou Island, but further north, near the Shallow Sea, was Crimson Reef Island’s Yihuo Reef. Among the three gates, only Golden Tang Gate had good relations with Changxiao Gate, but Golden Tang Gate had shut its doors for years and lacked the strength to intervene at the moment.

It’s just... Wang Fu’s palace surprisingly houses people from Crimson Reef Island. I only hope this won’t cause trouble when the time comes.

Though Crimson Reef Island and Changxiao Gate were said to be sworn enemies, Li Xijun had used the Immortal Mirror to observe Wang Fu’s island and had clearly seen cultivators wearing Crimson Reef robes. It seemed the hostility between the two gates was only for show, and what dealings they had behind the scenes was anyone’s guess.

Hengzhu Dao Gate’s plan for dealing with Wang Fu was quite comprehensive, but Li Xijun’s mind was still filled with thoughts, When Wang Fu leaves the island, I must first visit Xifeng Island to confirm whether he has the spirit item on him.

————

Bi Yuzhuang was extremely efficient. Several cultivators arrived quickly, and the group exited the island via a small alley in the marketplace. After flying over the sea for a while, they saw Bi Yuzhuang appear out of thin air, dressed in her crimson robe.

She was clearly in high spirits, the bright smile at the corner of her eyes impossible to hide. It was obvious she had good news.

She nodded and said, "Qinghong!"

Bi Yuzhuang seemed to be holding a faint, mist-like veil in her hand, flickering in and out of sight. When she saw the group, she tossed the fabric into the air. One corner remained in her grasp, while the rest rapidly expanded, spreading out above everyone.

A layer of white mist formed beneath Li Qinghong’s feet, condensed from the dharma artifact. She felt as if she were standing on solid ground. There were three others under the cover of the veil, two in crimson robes, and one dressed in pleated garments of blue with green patterns.
𝗳𝐫𝚎𝗲𝚠𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝘃𝚎𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺

Bi Yuzhuang introduced them, "These two brothers are juniors from our gate. The elder is Feng Chong, the younger Feng Yu. They’ve studied spell arts since childhood and are highly skilled in spell arts. They’ve been training out at sea for years, so Changxiao Gate likely doesn’t know of them."

As she finished speaking, both brothers, handsome and well-mannered, responded respectfully. Since neither side was familiar and had no ties, there wasn’t much else to say.

Bi Yuzhuang then pointed to the man in blue and green and said delightedly, "This is Daoist Chen Xuanyu of the Yuyang Prefecture's Chen Family. His sword cultivation is extraordinary. But his family keeps a low profile and has never sent him out before. I happened to run into him, what a pleasant surprise!"

It was Li Qinghong’s first time seeing a cultivator from the Yuyang Prefecture's Chen Family of Yue State. Before the Xiao Family rose, the Chen Family had been Yue State’s only Purple Mansion Realm immortal family. They had always kept a low profile and were actually not far from her own family.

The southern shore of Moongaze Lake lay at the northern base of Mount Dali. Tongmo Prefecture lay across the mountain to its southern slopes, and it was previously known as ancient Yuyang Prefecture. It was where the Chen Family of Yuyang Prefecture had resided for generations.

Chen Xuanyu, wearing a Daoist crown, nodded politely to her. A black-sheathed dharma sword hung at his waist, matching quite well with his blue robes patterned in green. Yet instead of lingering on her face, his gaze drifted quickly and fixed itself on Li Xijun, refusing to move away.

The Yuyang Prefecture's Chen Family! So all these families really are only cordial on the surface.

Li Qinghong had never heard of any known conflict between the Yuyang Prefecture's Chen Family and any other family. She hadn’t expected them to be involved in something as serious as hunting down a direct descendant of Changxiao Gate! Moreover, this man made no attempt to hide it. It was likely that the feud between the Chen Family and Changxiao Gate was already common knowledge among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

She drew a quiet breath and returned the gesture with a cupped-fist salute, "Greetings, Daoist friend."

A bit more satisfaction appeared beneath her already radiant expression as Bi Yuzhuang smiled and said, "I hadn’t expected things to go so smoothly. Originally, with either Daoist Chen or Qinghong taking action, combined with the formation, I’d have had over seventy percent chance of keeping him here...

"But to think Daoist Chen happened to be passing through and agreed to assist, Wang Fu is truly facing a karmic tribulation, with nowhere left to run!"

Li Xijun didn’t believe a word of her 'passing through' story, but he did let out a breath of relief. Now that a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Chen Family was backing them, the risks of this mission had dropped significantly.

Bi Yuzhuang, however, beamed at the two and said gently, "Everything’s going so smoothly, we may not even need Ximing or Xijun anymore... Your esteemed family members could simply observe and return to oversee the family affairs. That would be just as valuable."

"Brother..."

Just as Li Xijun felt reassured and was about to continue, he was cut off by Li Ximing, who respectfully said, "Xijun’s cultivation is still lacking, it’s better to send him back. I, however, have some suppressive techniques. I’ll stay to lend a hand just in case. Letting that man escape would be a regrettable outcome."

Li Qinghong nodded and gave Li Xijun a few parting instructions. The white-robed youth took several moments to think it through and silently thought to himself, That’s just as well. I ought to inspect the island myself. If by chance he’s arrogant enough to leave the Purple Mansion Realm spirit item there, it might require further scheming. Coming and going again would be a waste of time. It’s better I watch it personally and eliminate the final thread of uncertainty.

In the end, he nodded and said, "Very well."

No sooner had he spoken than Chen Xuanyu finally opened his mouth. His tone was gentle, tinged with a hint of regret, "I’ve heard you’ve refined your Sword Essence, little friend. It’s my first time seeing a Dao of Frost and Snow Sword Essence in Jiangnan. As a descendant of a Sword Immortal, I had hoped we might spar and sit together to properly discuss swordsmanship."
𝓯𝓻𝒆𝙚𝒘𝓮𝙗𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝒍.𝙘𝓸𝙢

Ever since breaking through to Sword Essence, Li Xijun had yet to grasp even a thread of its elusive Sword Intent. When he heard that Chen Xuanyu’s sword Dao was astonishing, he too was eager to exchange insights.

He replied readily, "Rest assured, Senior! Once this matter is resolved, I’ll visit you in Tongmo Prefecture or the Eastern Sea!"

He bowed to each of them in turn and departed, riding a flurry of snow. Bi Yuzhuang turned to look at Li Qinghong and praised, "I see that his thoughts are meticulous and his sword Dao remarkably gifted. He truly has the bearing of a sword immortal, how delightful and praiseworthy."

Li Xijun’s appearance was flawless, and his attitude and thinking were both pleasing to elders. It was no wonder Bi Yuzhuang spoke so favorably. Her words brought Li Qinghong out of her silent pondering, and she quickly offered thanks.

"Seeing this youth, one can imagine the Celestial Moon Sword himself," Chen Xuanyu’s words were crisp and direct, a hint of admiration in his tone.

Bi Yuzhuang, standing beside Li Qinghong, leaned in and said softly, "As we previously discussed, Qinghong, you may choose one item from Wang Fu’s belongings first. The remaining items will be divided equally among the three parties."

She sent the Feng brothers into the sea to arrange the formation. The rest of the group sat cross-legged beneath the veil of the dharma artifact, quietly waiting.

————

Moongaze Lake.

The formation glowed snowy white on Pingya Island. Several cultivators were stationed on small islands across the lake, inspecting geomantic lines or managing demonic creatures. Occasionally, small formations flared to life, and spirit boats crisscrossed the water.

Li Chengliao descended to the lakeshore on the wind, his body brimming with condensed true essence. He had retrained in the Li Family’s most treasured Radiant Essence Scripture, and his radiant and dazzling essence gave him an aura of stern authority.

Beside him, Li Chenghuai practiced the third-grade Concealment and Obfuscation Sutra, steeped in the flavor of ancient methods. Unlike his elder brother, his aura was restrained and his cultivation difficult to gauge.

He had the option to study Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique in his Qi Cultivation Realm as well. Having read both, Li Chenghuai decided against it, as many of his siblings had already chosen the Fire Virtue. Preferring subtle, understated methods, he had opted for the latter.

Since the family's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had left for several months, the two brothers had reorganized the island’s affairs. They reappointed the Peak Manager, Peak Guardian, and Peak Overseer. Now, the Li Family operated smoothly again and even began to show traces of renewed vitality.

Most of the long-standing elders, old cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and those stuck at the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm died up north. Since those who sat at the top are all gone, it was only natural for the younger ones to rise up...

Li Chengliao had lived through it himself and understood it best. The Li Family was harsh toward its extended family, while the various peaks were relatively liberal, but the family lacked everything except people. There were never enough spirit fields or spiritual resources to go around. In that sense, this grim purge was almost a blessing.

But what Li Chengliao worried about was entirely different. He asked, "According to news from the sect... where is our granduncle now?"

Li Chenghuai did some quick calculations and replied, "He should be here soon, probably within fifteen minutes."

In the months since the Li Family’s Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had gone abroad, the Azure Pond Sect’s internal situation had been in constant turmoil. Though the Chi Family had stabilized their footing, Si Yuanli was not to be trifled with.

First came three straight days of reports from the Lingu Family about demonic disturbances in the Southern Sea. People needed to be sent there, while forces guarding the Eastern Sea also had to be rearranged. Yu Su’s former strongholds saw his trusted aides either fleeing or being recalled, leaving no one to use.

Si Yuanli then sent people to stir things up further, discouraging Chi Family cultivators from traveling to the Eastern Sea. Even those who did wouldn’t dare leave the island. As a result, the waters were going unguarded for far too long. At the same time, Si Yuanli lavishly praised Li Xuanfeng and accelerated plans to have Li Xizhi oversee Eastern Sea affairs.

To make matters worse, Ning Hejing occasionally held views contrary to the Chi Family’s, forcing Chi Fubo to compromise repeatedly, leaving him overwhelmed. After much deliberation from all sides, Li Yuanqin finally had the opportunity to return to the Li Family to offer his condolences.

Li Chengliao figured that the Si Family wanted to sow discord between Ning Hejing and Chi Fubo, since Chi Fubo believed the Li Family was still worth winning over. This was the one matter on which the two factions had miraculously agreed.

Thankfully, we still have an elder here.

If not for Li Xuanxuan remaining in the mountains, Li Chengliao truly didn’t know how to face Li Yuanqin. He had once caught a brief glimpse of him at Tujun Gate. It was an impression that remained vividly in his mind, and not a good one.

He waited at the edge of the island for a while. In the sky, the edge of a Dawn Cloudliner began to glow with Heavenly Glow.

Li Chenghuai sighed and said, "The lord has arrived."




# Chapter 917: By Coincidence

The lake waters rippled gently beneath the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner. Li Yuanqin stood at the prow of the vessel, hands clasped behind his back and white mist curling beneath his feet. He gazed quietly down at the cultivators moving below. His mourning robes fluttered lightly in the air, yet his expression remained calm and composed.

Ning Hemian stood quietly behind him, sorrow still lingering in her eyes. Her eyes swept across the faces of cultivators on either side, those of the Chi Family in green, and the Si Family’s confidants in white, all carefully observing Moongaze Lake.

Ning Hejing, unsurprisingly distrustful, had sent someone to accompany her. He was a junior with lower cultivation, who now stood quietly at the back with his head lowered.

Ning Hemian had always been sharp, but now she could no longer understand her elder brother. Ning Hejing was clearly aligned with the Chi Family’s second lineage, yet he still stubbornly and viciously defended the first lineage’s last fig leaf of dignity. The more she watched, the more unbearable it felt.

She thought, It’s just patching a broken window; what’s the point? Why risk everything for Chi Zhiyun with our family in such a state?

When she saw the growing silence among the Chi Family's second lineage cultivators, she only felt he was courting disaster. But since there was little affection left between them, she simply went along with it.

"My lord, we've arrived at Moongaze Lake." A cultivator behind Li Yuanqin reminded gently.

Li Yuanqin acknowledged the man with a nod, and seeing the cloudship gradually come to a halt, casually said, "Wait for Li Chengliao to come aboard."

His intent was clear, prompting the Chi Family cultivator in green to nod. The Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner came to rest over the lake, its radiance spreading across the sky and painting both lake and heavens in a wash of rainbow-colored light.

Seeing that no one from the Li Family had come down by windflight, someone was soon sent to invite them.

Soon, a white-robed man stood respectfully outside the ship. Li Yuanqin tilted his head, and the Chi Family member beside him quietly explained, "This man is from the An Family. The An Family are descended from the Jiang Family, and the Jiang Family were outer sect disciples of the Moonlight Mansion. The An family married into the Jiang Family's main branch, so their bloodline is among the purest on the lake."

Li Yuanqin understood at once. The Chi Family cultivator left the cloudliner and spoke kindly to An Siwei, who then withdrew. Shortly after, Li Chengliao arrived, riding the wind.

His tone was respectful, and his bearing impeccable. Bowing beside the cloudship, he said, "This junior greets granduncle and all attending emissaries."

Only then did Li Yuanqin give a small nod, step off the ship, and reply, "There have been countless immortal affairs tying me down and only today have I managed to break free. Chengliao, please take me to pay my respects..."

Li Chengliao quickly assessed the situation. The Chi Family simply wanted the attitude of a younger generation shown, while the Si Family preferred the appearance of harmony. So the two sides acted cordially and disembarked together.

Only then did Li Chengliao formally greet Ning Hemian, saying, "Greetings, my lady."

Grief clouded Ning Hemian’s expression. She had always stood as an equal beside Li Xuanfeng and was far easier to approach than the outwardly composed Li Yuanqin. Li Chengliao respectfully led the group into the central hall of the island, where White Lightning had already been laid out on the ritual table.

The white bow bore no dazzling golden glow, nor any radiant dharma light. It lay there quietly, yet none present could take their eyes off it. Li Yuanqin lowered his gaze solemnly; Ning Hemian’s eyes shimmered with tears; and greed filled the eyes of the others behind them.

Li Yuanqin stepped forward, performing the full rites, bowing three times and kowtowing nine times.

As the cultivators of Azure Pond Sect all turned toward him, Li Chengliao quickly picked up White Lightning from the altar and respectfully said, "My elder left clear instructions, this item is to be handed over to granduncle."

Li Yuanqin was visibly surprised, but maintained a mourning demeanor as he received White Lightning, replying, "My father’s bow is well-known in Jiangnan. There were even rumors from the Golden Feather Sect that it had caught the eye of a Daoist Master and might one day become a Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact. It is truly precious, how could I dare accept it?"

Had he not said anything, it would have been better, but with those words, Li Chengliao felt even less qualified to hold the bow. He repeated that he dared not disobey his elder’s command, and only after Li Yuanqin accepted it did he feel at ease.

But before he could say more, a Chi Family member nearby looked at him and asked suspiciously, "Why haven’t we seen..."

Li Chengliao knew exactly what he was about to ask, as none of his family's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had shown themselves. This matter wasn’t one to be revealed casually.

Fixing his gaze on Li Yuanqin, he said in a low voice, "Granduncle, our lord has long awaited your return. However, his old injuries have flared up again, leaving him bedridden. The other elders are each in secluded cultivation, and our grandaunt is away visiting friends. A meeting is unfortunately not possible at the moment."

As soon as these words left his mouth, even before the others could react, Si Tongyi’s eyes lit up with delight, What does this mean? This is an incredible favor to my Si Family! There’s no way they’re all in seclusion, it’s clear that they don’t want to see him! Excellent... Excellent...

Li Yuanqin glanced at him, but his expression showed no change. He merely nodded and said, "No wonder I haven’t seen the younger family members. What a pity."

The Chi Family cultivator in green looked grim and was about to speak, but Si Tongyi cut in first with a sigh, "Indeed, a pity. I also heard the new head of Profound Peak Gate has been appointed and Lady Qinghong went to offer her congratulations."

He quickly silenced the Chi Family’s response and followed up, "Since the timing isn’t ideal, there’s no need to impose further... White Lightning is far too valuable. Let’s send it back to the ship first, and we’ll discuss the rest later."

Si Tongyi was the first to end the visit. Though the Chi Family cultivator still looked angry and Ning Hemian frowned slightly, Li Yuanqin softly said, "White Lightning is important. Let us send it to the cloudliner together first."

Li Chengliao secretly sighed in relief. If things ended here, then it would still be framed as Li Xijun and the others simply being unwilling to meet him. If the Chi Family really kicked up a fuss, he wouldn’t be able to bring Li Xijun and the rest out at all. It would’ve been a disaster.

Moreover, if this incident escalated and word got out... and if anything happened to Yu Fuzi, anyone with ill intent would connect the dots...

He let out another breath as the group departed. As expected, Si Tongyi lingered at the back. Li Chengliao leaned in and whispered, "The elders are indeed in seclusion. Daoist friend, would you like to go up and visit them?"

"No need..." Si Tongyi replied cheerfully. The group then escorted White Lightning as they flew toward the heavens. Li Chengliao let out a quiet sigh and thought to himself, Why did the timing have to be so coincidental...? I can only muddle through it like this...

Eastern Sea, at the boundary of the Qingzhou scattered reefs.

A red vessel swayed atop the sea, filled with laughter and teasing. Pale, lotus-like arms stretched out over the edge, jade-like fingers gently tracing the water’s surface and sending ripples across it.

There were around forty to fifty women on board, all unclothed, each with distinct features and charming voices. Their snow-white bodies tangled together in a dazzling mass. At the center sat a burly man, clad only in an outer robe and laughing heartily.

Wang Fu held a beauty in one arm, his other hand hidden beneath his robe as he formed a spell seal. He smiled while gazing at the snowy, delicate skin before him, feeling greatly pleased as he thought, Good... This Radiant Sky Stone truly is a Bright Yang treasure. The Supplement Yin with Residual Yang Method really does draw out Residual Yang Vital Qi... With this, my cultivation has sped up significantly!

Now that I have this thing in hand, I truly don’t want to give it up... A Bright Yang treasure like this is a rare find these days.

As the spell seal in his hand circulated, the gazes of his concubines turned hazy. A wisp of red vapor drifted out from their mouths, landed in his palm, swirled briefly, and then returned to their mouths.

When the red vapor settled, all his concubines fell into an intoxicated daze. Wang Fu thought to himself, That monk was right, this indeed comes from the Undefeated King of Brightness's Dao lineage. When it comes to carnal allure, the mingling of Bright Yang and Veiled Yin is truly unmatched. Quite fascinating.

Though Wang Fu's hands were busy, his gaze remained clear. The cycling red vapor not only enhanced his cultivation but also seemed to make the bodies of his concubines even smoother and more delicate. He carefully moderated the spell to avoid harming them.

Suddenly, sensing something, he looked up. A pitch-black orb materialized before him, casting a dim glow. Shifting scenes appeared across its surface.

Wang Fu’s brows rose as he chuckled, "Yangyi Evening Bloom. Not bad, rare to see these days."

Despite realizing that the demonic creature held a Lesser Yang spirit item he needed, Wang Fu made no move. He quietly observed, studying the fish demon’s expression. It wasn’t fearful at all, on the contrary, it looked elated.

"It really does have some skill," muttered Wang Fu.

Wang Fu wanted to watch a while longer, but the foolish creature reverted to its original form, a dead-fish face slick with slime. Its eyes were as large as windows and occupied nearly his entire view.

"Damn you, stupid fish."

Wang Fu waved his hand, and a man descended from the sky, bowing in greeting. He was a guest cultivator of Changxiao Gate. Wang Fu, still stark naked, didn’t mind at all and casually said, "There’s a fish demon to the north. Go retrieve the item from it."

The man accepted the command and departed. Wang Fu continued to observe through the black orb. After a while, he let out an angry laugh and cursed, "Useless!"

That man was blindly heading north, not only failing to catch up to the fish demon, but even trailing behind the cultivator chasing it. He was floundering across the sea like a brainless hog.

Unable to contain his frustration, Wang Fu scooped up a concubine, stepped onto the waves, and soared away with the wind.

The other cultivators from Changxiao Gate hadn’t even reacted before Wang Fu vanished. The remaining few, seeing an opportunity, hurried to the boat to gawk at the concubines, whispering to each other with clicks of admiration.

————

North.

Wang Fu’s unexpected movements had caught many off guard, but in the end, he had indeed pursued the bait. Li Qinghong and the others quietly let out a breath of relief. After some mental calculations, the situation seemed even better than they had initially hoped.

Both the fish demon and the cultivator had been operating around the area for years. When they saw Wang Fu pursuing them, the cultivator turned and fled in panic, while the fish demon changed direction and sped north, moving much faster than before.

This was beyond everyone’s expectations. It was clear now that the creature had been holding back earlier and planning to harm the cultivator behind it. This only further convinced Wang Fu of its authenticity.

What surprised everyone most was that Wang Fu didn’t act swiftly, but instead wandered about at a leisurely pace, carefully observing the fish demon, as if suspecting it might have an unusual bloodline.

The group remained quietly hidden beneath the dharma artifact. As soon as Wang Fu stepped into the formation, the Feng brothers simultaneously formed hand seals, red light bursting from their palms as they shouted in unison, "Rise!"

Eight crimson beams of light instantly shot up from the sea, piercing into the sky. The group revealed their figures, each occupying a position, looking down at Wang Fu from above. The red spiritual barrier overhead quickly closed, then faded into transparency, concealing the entire area and returning the seascape to its tranquil state.

Within the formation, Li Qinghong narrowed her eyes slightly. Wang Fu was now clad in a white feathered robe. He had large eyes,a broad forehead, and exuded an aura of uprightness. At this moment, he showed no signs of panic, but wore a thoughtful expression. Only the woman in his arms was unclothed and terrified.

Wang Fu’s gaze swept over the group. When his eyes landed on Li Qinghong and Chen Xuanyu, his expression gradually darkened. His voice was firm as he said in a low tone, "She’s a minor cultivator in the Embryonic Breathing Realm. She has nothing to do with this matter. I ask that you spare her life."

The 'she' he referred to was the woman in his arms. Wang Fu’s first words weren’t of anger or panic, but a plea for the safety of his concubine.

But Bi Yuzhuang was not about to comply. A strange, petal-shaped trident halberd had already appeared in her hand like a ceremonial weapon, mana silently flowing into it as she spoke softly, deliberately stalling, "This matter is of great consequence. I dare not act carelessly."

The Feng brothers had already formed seals before she finished speaking. Their spells transformed into two waves of golden rain that fell from the sky. Wang Fu's body lit up with white light, his feathered robe rising to shield him.

But these two brothers' spells were unexpectedly formidable. Though the golden rain appeared ordinary, it was forged from numerous spirit items. The white light on Wang Fu’s body flickered, forcing him to raise a hand and cast a defensive spell.

Holding up the white light with one hand, Wang Fu looked down at the woman and said solemnly, "Lightning and fire hurt. Let me bear it instead."

The woman choked back tears as her form dispersed like drifting petals. Wang Fu shook blood from his hand, and a pale-white longsword materialized, its glow pulsing faintly.
𝐟𝚛𝕖𝚎𝕨𝗲𝐛𝚗𝐨𝐯𝐞𝕝.𝐜𝗼𝗺

Level Beam!

He bent the sword in midair and threw it out, where it transformed into a storm of pear blossom-like white shadows. Thousands of swords flew through the air, slashing through the golden rain.

Bi Yuzhuang had long anticipated his Level Beam. Her dharma artifact floated in her palm, layers of red light unfurling like petals as she shouted, "Freeze!"

The tens of thousands of white sword shadows in the sky halted in an instant, frozen midair like a snowstorm suspended over the sea. Their reflections cast countless beams of white light into the water below.

The sword shadows of Level Beam were clearly not mere illusions created through sword energy or intent. Each one was a real, tangible white blade, sharp and distinct, that filled the sky. Though they had been poised to slash or stab, they were now all completely frozen in place.

Clang!

Chen Xuanyu drew his sword and leaped into the air. He arced above the countless white sword shadows and he unleashed a streak of black sword energy that cut through the sea of blades, aiming straight for Wang Fu’s chest.

Wang Fu’s expression grew solemn as he shouted, "Come!"

Dong!

A large bronze bell appeared in front of him, trembling endlessly as if it had just suppressed something beneath it. Wang Fu had no time to feel relief and shot into the sky.

Dong!

The black sword rain fell like a waterfall, making it nearly impossible for Wang Fu to move. He finally formed a hand seal and chanted a spell. But the Feng brothers’ arts summoned a sky full of crimson clouds that pressed down toward him. His dharma artifact was once again restrained, leaving him no choice but to change his spell for defense.

A deadly tribulation...

After exchanging only a few moves, Wang Fu felt a chill settle in his heart. He believed himself stronger than Bi Yuzhuang by a margin, and although he had estimated that Chen Xuanyu was at least his equal, he had never faced him before.

If just the two of them could already force him into such danger, how could he withstand the siege of five?

The Feng brothers are understandable, but why is Li Qinghong here? What right does she have to kill me?

He had no idea what wrong he had committed to draw even the Li Family into this ambush. But Wang Fu no longer had time to question anyone. Above him, black clouds churned with rolling thunder and lightning. The female cultivator stood cloaked in violet lightning.

Six slender, elegant command tokens shimmered before her, their runes lighting up one by one. Rich silver-white lightning flowed across the tokens, blending with the violet thunder on Li Qinghong’s body and gradually illuminating Wang Fu’s face.

"When yang reaches stillness, six thunders are born!"




# Chapter 919: Chess Piece

Xifeng Island.

Li Xijun arrived on a flurry of snow. He flicked his sleeve lightly, and a golden shimmer flew out. The Profound Screen released several pale golden hues of illusion, enveloping a radius of three meters around him.

Wang Fu belonged to the Lesser Yang lineage and was not part of the Jiangnan Dao lineage. The Chongming Profound Insight Screen could hardly play a decisive role against him, and the siege on Wang Fu was already a sure thing. The Li Family had no intention of displaying this dharma artifact publicly, so Li Qinghong had handed it over to Li Xijun for safekeeping.

As Li Xijun flew past a small island next to Xifeng Island, he took out the dharma artifact and shrouded himself with it to avoid being spied upon. He calmed his breath and prayed in his heart, I, Li Xijun of the Li Family, humbly invoke the mirror of law—survey the hidden, explore the subtle, perceive the profound, illuminate all directions, capture ghosts and seek the divine...

Illusions immediately appeared before his eyes, and his field of vision grew. His spiritual sense expanded seemingly without limit, allowing overwhelming scenes to flood in. Li Xijun immersed himself in it and looked toward the island.

Always cautious, he had timed it precisely so that he could pass by the island without stopping his flight. His spirit wandered freely, clearly observing everything on the island.

The Artifact-Concealing Spirit-Suppressing Grand Formation of Xifeng Island was like air to him as his spiritual intent drifted in unhindered. His gaze pierced the main hall’s rooftop and settled within the vast interior.

The main pedestal at the front was empty. The spot where the pitch-black box had originally been was now bare. Li Xijun let out a breath of relief and searched around the island twice. Sure enough, there was no trace of the box.

I really was overthinking it.

Just as he exited the formation and was about to withdraw from the spirit-projection state, something in the corner of his eye caught his attention, and he suddenly froze.

Two cultivators, a man and a woman, were ascending from the island on flames. The dignified-looking man seemed quite strong, dressed in Crimson Reef Island attire. Meanwhile, the woman was a charming female cultivator, holding a slender command token in her hand.

Li Xijun silently watched, seeing her ornate sleeve emit a flash of radiant light under the mirror’s insight.

A pitch-black jade box lay nestled within it.

The Radiant Sky Stone!

He shifted his gaze to the female cultivator’s face. It was a face so familiar it made his skin crawl. He had seen this woman back when he was still in Qi Cultivation Realm.

Guo Hongyao! She’s from Crimson Reef Island!

A sudden realization struck Li Xijun, and a chill ran through his heart. He finally understood where his vague unease earlier had come from.

People from Crimson Reef Island appearing on Xifeng Island isn’t some secret collusion... it was Wang Fu who made private contact. He secretly sold the Radiant Sky Stone to Crimson Reef Island!

That item truly isn’t on the island anymore, but it’s not with Wang Fu either. It was taken by Guo Hongyao, exchanged by Crimson Reef Island!

He opened his eyes and silently rode the wind forward within the Chongming Profound Insight Screen. His expression was calm, and one hand had already reached for Han Lin, which radiated an icy gleam.

Guo Hongyao... Guo Hongyao... to just happen to switch out the Radiant Sky Stone at this moment. What a coincidence... what a calculation...

They just want to make all our efforts go to waste! Very well... Crimson Reef Island! Such plotting... they must have rushed over upon sensing our forces had moved out, timing it perfectly to retrieve the item.

Ximing never steps outside the family, and Crimson Reef Island shouldn’t even know our family has a cultivation method, yet they’ve still schemed against us to this extent!

His eyes shone like cold stars, exhaling white mist like frost.

A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator’s spiritual sense couldn’t penetrate formations, nor surpass dharma artifacts of this kind. Only by traversing the great void could they perceive anything. In theory, when paired with talisman seeds, the Chongming Profound Insight Screen would prevent any eavesdropping from Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Yet even while hiding within the artifact, he dared not show the slightest emotion.

The chill in his heart slowly faded as he pondered, No... it’s not Ximing... No matter how scheming Crimson Reef Island may be, they wouldn’t target Ximing. There’s no need to go to such lengths over him...

Li Xijun closed his eyes, afraid the cold light in his pupils might be seen. Then, realization dawned upon him, It’s the heir.

Crimson Reef Island has always favored recruiting those with fatal destinies. They must have numerous detection methods and surely noticed something unique about Zhouwei... and grew greedy.

Crimson Reef Island has likely been observing our family for years. They must believe we’ve been preparing for Zhouwei all this time! That explains everything! These repeated obstructions... they’ll likely target Zhouwei next!
𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝓌𝘦𝘣𝘯ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝑚

Images of those two from Crimson Reef Island surfaced in his mind. Li Xijun let out a quiet breath, calmly stood up, formed a hand seal, and stowed the projection screen into his sleeve before riding the wind forward.

Li Xijun wandered eastward and westward, flying aimlessly, but his thoughts grew ever clearer.

The image of Bi Yuzhuang’s face appeared before him again, her cheerful voice echoing once more in his ears, “Things went too smoothly, so we don’t actually need Ximing or Xijun... Your esteemed family member can just watch and return to oversee the family.

“I hadn’t expected Fellow Daoist Chen to be traveling here and to act so boldly... I just happened to bump into him, it was a delightful surprise...”

Her words now made Li Xijun all the more certain, there had definitely been Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' interference in this whole endeavor!

Then why did Chen Xuanyu suddenly appear?

If the Yuyang Prefecture's Chen Family was truly opposed to Changxiao Gate, then Chen Xuanyu and Bi Yuzhuang alone could have slain Wang Fu. Why didn’t they act earlier? Why wait specifically for Li Qinghong? Wouldn’t three of them be overkill?

Bi Yuzhuang had deliberately sent him back. Even if he hadn’t used the Immortal Mirror to detect anything, if he had flown at a normal pace, might he have run directly into Guo Hongyao and her companion?

Chen Xuanyu was sent later, not to ensure the killing of Wang Fu, but merely to allow Bi Yuzhuang to say that one sentence, 'Your esteemed family can just watch and return to oversee the family.’

Li Xijun’s eyes grew terrifyingly clear as his understanding deepened.

Chang Xiaozi’s stance is unclear; perhaps he can’t act easily. But it’s already evident that Profound Peak Gate’s Changxi is leveraging our family in his gambit. This is, at its core, a struggle between Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!

Crimson Reef Island’s reaction, or their countermove, must have been sudden, prompting them to retrieve the item at this precise moment. So Chen Xuanyu’s arrival is likewise the Chen Family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator or perhaps Hengxing’s countermeasure.

With talisman seeds protecting him, he did not fear Purple Mansion Realm cultivators prying into his thoughts. He flew forward with ease, his expression composed, And I, Li Xijun... am the piece that’s been swapped out. Behind me are Hengxing and the Chen Family’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivator... Daoist Master Yushui!

Guo Hongyao was once gravely injured by Tu Longjian. Who knows what her current strength is? As for the other one, I’ve never seen him, and I don’t know his strength... maybe they can’t defeat me. But Guo Hongyao hates me. It won’t take much to provoke her. That fool will definitely attack when she sees me!

The seawater below reflected frost and snow. In his heart, he thought, Whether this guess is right or not... we’ll find out soon enough!

Li Xijun rode the snow forward. After fifteen minutes, a faint itch stirred in his chest, and without realizing it, he had changed direction. A cold burst of energy surged from his qi sea, jolting him to awareness. His direction remained unchanged beneath his feet, and a cold smile rose in his heart.

Just as expected!




# Chapter 920: Autumn Moon’s Harmonious Echo

Flames surged beneath his feet as Guo Hongkang skimmed across the surface of the Eastern Sea, evaporating mist into the air. He was clearly anxious, his gaze sweeping back and forth over the sea.

The woman beside him was still frowning and complaining, but Guo Hongkang paid her no mind. He had grown familiar with her during their journey and knew it was best to simply ignore her.

I’ve long heard of Guo Hongyao’s name... she truly is someone who won’t listen to anyone, thought Guo Hongkang.

Guo Hongyao’s status was far nobler than his. Her father was a legitimate descendant of the Purple Mansion Realm, though her mother was a mortal, which made her somewhat unwelcome. Fortunately, her elder brothers doted on her. Truthfully speaking, Guo Hongkang’s cultivation resources for the year couldn’t match what she received in a single month.

Born above thousands, yet with the temperament of a spoiled noble daughter.

In Guo Hongkang’s eyes, Guo Hongyao had brought it all upon herself. First, she had flown into a wild temper and inexplicably broken off her engagement with Xi Chang of Chunyi Dao Gate. The man's grandfather had just emerged with divine powers and made him the sect’s young master, so everyone now looked at her with mocking eyes.
𝙛𝒓𝓮𝒆𝔀𝒆𝙗𝓷𝒐𝙫𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝓶

Then she managed several islands and completely ruined their businesses. When she was sent to the Li Family to investigate Xu Xiao, she suddenly drew her sword and pointed it at their young master’s throat!

So she had been ordered to return to the Eastern Sea. Guo Hongkang heard that Daoist Master Junjian had seized her Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact. The matter had then escalated up to Daoist Master Tianwan, who slapped her publicly and banished her from the island.

A Purple Mansion Realm immortal descendant, and beautiful too... if she doesn’t speak, everyone thinks she’s a fairy. But once she does, all pity her. A background others can only envy, yet she acts this foolishly—how can someone like this even exist!

Guo Hongkang’s own branch had long declined. He had dreamed many times of gaining just a little more resources, so watching her squander everything made him grit his teeth in resentment. To make matters worse, Daoist Master Junjian had now broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, and even her brothers no longer dared to protect her...

Where has elder brother gone...

Most of her complaints went in one ear and out the other, but this particular line struck Guo Hongkang’s heart and made him frown as well.

Guo Hongkang wasn’t particularly strong. Escorting a Purple Mansion Realm item like the Radiant Sky Stone would usually never be entrusted to just him and Guo Hongyao. The true leader of the mission was the capable Guo Hongjian; they were merely tagging along.

But for some reason, that morning, Guo Hongjian had left behind a talisman, exited the formation, and instructed the two of them to escort the item first. Then, he simply flew off!

Guo Hongkang instantly felt troubled. Worse still, he had Guo Hongyao beside him, someone who wouldn’t listen to reason. A vague sense of unease crept up inside him, Better not follow this madwoman... or we might end up suffering some unforeseen disaster...

Guo Hongyao, seeing that her companion was still not responding, didn’t show any anger. She simply thought this man had been this dull the whole trip and was probably one of those fools who buried themselves in spell studies. Her tone softened, and she looked toward the sea.

"Hm?"

She saw frost and snow sweeping in from the east. A striking young man in white, carrying a sword, walked upon the snow. Her eyes were instantly drawn to him. Guo Hongyao couldn’t help but take a second look, and then suddenly froze.

It's him!

A sudden, inexplicable fury rose in her heart, and the slight good mood she was in had vanished instantly. Gritting her teeth, she said coldly, "So it’s you. Quite fortunate of you to manage to break through even in that tiny family..."

Guo Hongkang was also captivated by the sword cultivator. The phrase 'what a handsome young man' had just reached his throat when he heard a metallic clang.

Guo Hongyao drew her crimson command token in fury and charged forward without a word.

"Ah?" Guo Hongkang rushed to block her and asked, "My lady, what are you..."

"Move!" Guo Hongyao sent her red skirt sweeping forward with a shout, forcing him to step back. The exchange drew the attention to the white-robed youth in the distance. His perception technique seemed remarkable.

Guo Hongyao had planned to approach quietly, but Guo Hongkang’s interference had alerted Li Xijun. Her fury instantly spilled over onto Guo Hongkang as she snapped, "I’ll deal with you later!"

Guo Hongkang dared not offend her. He stepped back in fright as Guo Hongyao raised her flaming token, surging Merging Fire rising with fury across her delicate face. She charged straight toward the snowy figure.

"Fellow Daoist, what is the meaning of this?!" The white-robed youth asked in surprise, strands of cold light forming in his hand to block her.

Guo Hongyao urged the Merging Fire forward and spat hatefully, "Li Xijun, you ruined my Crimson Reef affair that year... I spared your life for Azure Pond Sect’s sake... and you still dare to wander the Eastern Sea!"

Her words exploded in Guo Hongkang’s ears like thunder. He felt the breath leave his body as he exclaimed in shock, "He’s from the Moongaze Li Family!"

The Moongaze Li Family indeed lacked a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but anyone who asked would know that their in-law was Daoist Master Chuting, who had carved his path between the Three Sects and Seven Gates. Moreover, the immortal bow of Mount Bianyan had just fallen in battle for the Azure Pond Sect, and the Si Family patriarch had personally given them their rewards.

Their influence was peaking... and now she wanted to kill one of their direct descendant?

Guo Hongyao dared strike, but he did not, and had no reason to. He simply followed behind, and said with a bitter sigh, "My lady..."

Guo Hongyao ignored him completely. Though she was foolish, she was still a Crimson Reef direct descendant. The gray, ferocious Merging Fire in her hand was no ordinary spell to defend against.

Li Xijun practiced the Dao of Frost and Snow, which was naturally incompatible with fire. His mana and techniques were inferior. His spell, Slaughter Jun Kui Light, barely reached the lower threshold of major sects. The thread-like cold light evaporated before Merging Fire, which forced him to retreat several steps.

"Trifling tricks!"

Guo Hongyao rejoiced when she saw that his cultivation and mana were beneath hers, and that his Immortal Foundation was restrained by her Merging Fire. Stepping forward, her worries vanished, and she surged ahead with commanding flames.

Li Xijun exchanged a few spells with her and drew his sword to defend. His sword qi had some strength but could only split the fire briefly before fading.

Guo Hongyao pressed forward through the sword qi, sneering, "So this is all the sword immortal clans amount to!"

Li Xijun calmly retreated with his sword. When Guo Hongyao rose to give chase, the flustered Guo Hongkang panicked and shouted, "My lady, be careful of a trap! The spirit item... the spirit item!"

Guo Hongyao shot him an impatient glance, flung her sleeve, and tossed the pitch-black jade box into Guo Hongkang’s hands using her mana.

She flew forward, wreathed in flames, leaving behind only a sentence, "Keep it safe!"

Guo Hongkang hurried to catch it, checked it quickly, and finally breathed a sigh of relief. His heart, filled with dread, began to settle, Thank goodness... it probably wasn’t a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability! Otherwise, she wouldn’t have remembered to hand me the item... if she kills Li Xijun, the Li Family will hate me too...

Guo Hongyao surged forward on flames. Though the white-robed youth before her was lacking in cultivation, his escape light was surprisingly fast. Perhaps he had taken some spiritual pill, it would explain why she couldn’t catch up to him for the moment.

"Run... run!" She felt exhilarated as she rode fire all the way. Li Xijun traveled ahead on frost, deep in thought, She’s certainly no weakling. At the very least, this speed is beyond the norm.

Li Xijun had rushed ahead and, as expected, ran into the two of them, confirming his guess. Now, after flying dozens of kilometers, he noticed Guo Hongyao was still chasing relentlessly, drawing ever closer. He thought to himself, She seems to have been thrown off completely. It's not likely that she will be hiding any tricks...

He slowly reached for Han Lin at his waist. The frost under his feet began to dissipate, and his speed slowed as he let the scorching Merging Fire behind creep closer until its heat stung his back. Suddenly, Li Xijun spun around and drew his sword.

Clang!
𝙛𝒓𝓮𝙚𝔀𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝒐𝒎

A streak of white light flared above the sea. Han Lin’s blade was so fast that it blurred through the air. There was a flash of bright white frost emanating from his strike, like a gust of pine-laced winter wind and falling snow rushing straight forward.

Guo Hongyao was caught off guard, seeing only a handful of snow flying toward her. She couldn’t even tell whether it was sword light or dharma light. The piercing chill swept over her, and she blankly thought, A talisman?

The command token in Guo Hongyao’s hand was no ordinary item, and its instinct to protect its master acted faster than she could. The stored Merging Fire burst forth, drawing her mana into it and forming a gray wall of fire in front of her.

But she was only a meter away from Li Xijun. Even Chi Zhiyun and Li Chejing, both sword essence cultivators, maintained the distance of a meter in battle. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would retreat three meters before Shangyuan.

Yet Guo Hongyao stood only a meter from a sword cultivator who had formed sword essence. Han Lin could practically reach her hem. The hasty wall of Merging Fire was completely useless. Han Lin’s true blade sliced clean through it, cleaving it in half. Her eyes were filled with dazzling white snow, then she felt a chill on her neck.

Pffft!

Blood gushed from her neck as Guo Hongyao’s pupils dilated and her elegant neck was severed in a single stroke. Crimson blood sprayed along the sword for a moment before curling back and pouring into the wound.

Buzz!

The sword had come too quickly. The treasure on Guo Hongyao’s body hadn’t even reacted. Her head had already left her neck by the time the jade pearl protecting her body finally activated its mana to deflect the sword.

The shock and panic in Guo Hongyao’s eyes had yet to fade when Li Xijun’s sword technique reversed. Three strands of snowy light slipped out of the blade, drifting and gliding toward her.

The three nimble, cunning streaks of snow darted toward her Qihai, Shenyang, and Juque acupoints. Though Guo Hongyao’s head was still suspended midair, she managed to react, shoving her long command token forward to block.

She bit down on her lip, causing blood to stain silver teeth and then transform into gray fire that was carried forward with her breath. This gray fire was several times denser than before. Its aura was overwhelming as it surged toward the three streaks of sword light.

But the Threefold Moonlight was inherently agile and cunning. It deftly dodged the gray fire and clashed with her life-preserving protective light with a metallic ring. The sounds of shattering snow and ice rang out repeatedly, and the jade pearl at her neck flickered erratically.

"Thank goodness!"

In the end, it was Guo Hongyao’s lineage that saved her life. Sword Essence grade Threefold Moonlight could already destroy most spells, yet the life-saving treasure gifted to Crimson Reef Island’s direct descendants withstood it, and still had energy to spare.

Guo Hongyao finally had the chance to reattach her head. Frost and Merging Fire hissed into white steam where neck and body met. The gray fire spiraling from her token coiled around her neck, fixing her head in place.

"Damn it!"

Only now did Guo Hongyao belatedly realize her fortune as she realised that Li Xijun practiced Cold Essence. Had he used metal or earth techniques instead, she would never have had the chance to restore her head.

Hatred rose in her eyes. She reached quickly for the storage pouch at her waist, but a question suddenly rose in her mind, He gave me so much time to react... What is he doing?

Her spiritual sense was fully engaged in using gray fire to fend off the three sword-essence-like streaks, so she could only stare blankly with her eyes.

Snow blanketed the sea. Before her, the white-robed man held his sword at an angle. The slender, snow-like blade radiated blinding brilliance. Snowflakes drifted down from the sky, each striking her protective barrier with a crisp clang, like rain on tiles. The three streaks of sword light darted like fish in water, flickering in and out among the storm of snow and sword aura.

But she no longer had the strength to deal with the three streaks. Li Xijun’s sword had already fallen. Guo Hongyao’s trembling hand gripped a talisman, but her vision was pure white. She could see nothing, there was only an intense, and drifting whiteness.

Half the mana had already entered her talisman when a sword light erupted from her Shenyang Mansion, interrupting the mana flow. The half-activated talisman remained in her palm, faintly glowing.

She felt a chill pulse through her chest. The sounds around her shattered into fragments as the tip of Han Lin slid between her brows, freezing her so thoroughly that she trembled. Her consciousness started slowly fading away.

Blood flowed from her mouth and nose, but showed no sign of transforming into Merging Fire. It slid down her fair cheek as Li Xijun stood exactly a meter away, white robes fluttering. As her vision dimmed, Guo Hongyao suddenly realized where she had gone wrong.

I shouldn’t have hastily reattached my head... I should’ve fled first instead... thought Guo Hongyao.




# Chapter 922: Seizing The Prize

Guo Hongyao had only been gone for fifteen minutes, yet Guo Hongkang was already growing anxious where he stood. His once-settled mood turned uneasy. He flew northward for a kilometer or two but, fearing schemes or ambushes, dared not go farther.

"Perhaps Li Xijun has someone backing him. Guo Hongyao might act fierce against Li Xijun alone, but if she runs into that thunder cultivator Li Qinghong, she’s no match at all..." muttered Guo Hongkang.

He figured Guo Hongyao’s life shouldn’t be in danger. Although Guo Shentong had vanished for years and the east and west sides of Crimson Reef were now allies in name only, Guo Hongyao’s branch was still one of direct descendance. She should still carry plenty of life-saving treasures.

"I’ll wait a little longer... If there’s no word from her after an hour, she’s probably used some talisman to escape. I’m carrying something too important to just stand here."

Guo Hongkang waited quietly, one hand on his magic sword. He closed his eyes while his other hand lit up with red light, two fingers pressed on the Shenyang Mansion point between his brows. Using a spell, he extended his spiritual sense to its limit, yet he still couldn't sense anything.

He had no choice but to give up and open his eyes. In the hazy distance, he saw a reddish-gray glow. It was clearly the hue of Merging Fire. Alarmed, he quickly clutched the talisman Guo Hongjian had given him, thinking, She already used a talisman after just fifteen minutes? Li Xijun is only at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. His sword aura barely counts as strong, not overwhelming. Either he’s hiding his strength, or he has help.

Guo Hongkang immediately made a decision and began retreating silently. His original plan to wait an hour was instantly abandoned as he muttered, "I’ll give her fifteen more minutes!"

Guo Hongkang was one of the top talents among the collateral branches. He secretly cultivated many techniques and had a bright future. But even so, he didn’t dare offend Guo Hongyao, afraid this woman might go mad.

"If not for that, I wouldn’t care whether she lived or died!"

He waited anxiously for a few seconds until he finally spotted a streak of light flying toward him from the distance, swaying unsteadily. Its mana aura was so dim it was hard to discern, but it was faintly tinged with white mist.

"Hm?"

Guo Hongkang’s eyes narrowed as he looked closely. The figure collapsed headfirst onto the shore. Her protective mana completely dissipated, revealing a pale and delicate face. Who else could it be but Guo Hongyao?

Her flame token lay dim and stuck in the ground beside her. She was covered in blood, and her dharma robe was dulled, stained in a blend of gray-red and crimson. It was rather garish against the island backdrop.

Serves her right! Guo Hongkang felt a surge of satisfaction. He immediately connected her condition to the distant gray-red glow and chuckled inwardly, The fool must’ve suffered terribly. She used up all her hidden talismans just to stop the guy... If I hadn’t been here when she fled, she wouldn’t even have her life left!

He drifted on the wind toward her, still curious, I wonder what that white light was... maybe some top-grade escape treasure’s light trail.

Guo Hongkang slowly descended. On the island shore, Guo Hongyao had already swallowed several pills, her complexion visibly recovering. Guo Hongkang approached a few steps closer and saw a coldly gleaming sword lying under her robes, still stained with blood.

Realizing she had slain Li Xijun, he sighed and offered his congratulations, "Congratulations, my lady, on slaying your foe."

The Guo Hongyao before him appeared gravely injured, struggling to breathe, and gasped, "Come here!"

Startled by her shout, Guo Hongkang shivered and quickly stepped forward. He saw her clutching her waist, struggling to rise. Her delicate hand lifted the sword that gleamed like snow, and her face twisted in pain as she barked, "Take it already!"

Though inwardly scornful, Guo Hongkang maintained a respectful expression and quickly reached out to grab the sword’s sheath. But it sank heavily into his hand, and he looked up, puzzled.

It turned out Guo Hongyao hadn’t let go of the hilt. Her graceful hand held the sword as if she had drawn it countless times before. Her pale fingers were defined and elegant, even beautiful.

At that moment, Guo Hongkang’s gaze moved past her hand to land on Guo Hongyao’s face. Her expression was icy as frost, and her eyes brimmed with killing intent.

Guo Hongyao had always been beautiful, but the usual look of petulance and impulsive discontent was now gone. In its place was an untouchable solemnity, like standing amidst a snowstorm.

The chilling and imperious stillness made her look less like Guo Hongyao and more like that snow-clad Daoist Master Tianwan.

Clang!

Guo Hongkang was less than a meter away from Li Xijun, who had transformed into Guo Hongyao. He was holding Han Lin’s scabbard in his hand when all he saw was a flash of snowy white. A chilling light rose from his throat.

The moment Li Xijun drew his sword, Han Lin slashed clean through Guo Hongkang’s throat, severing his head in one swift strike. Snowflakes scattered like a storm.

Li Xijun didn’t know what relationship the two had, but he knew Guo Hongyao was irrational. A show of agony covered everything better than polite behavior; any inconsistencies in attitude would be excused under the pain she’d endured.

As expected, Guo Hongkang suspected nothing and followed Guo Hongyao to the grave. He was also decapitated by Li Xijun in one strike.

"You—!"

But Guo Hongkang was not Guo Hongyao. Shock barely flickered through his pupils before he acted, not to save himself, block the blow, nor retreat, but to activate the talisman in his hand.

Boom!

A blinding gray-red light burst out. The potent Merging Fire in his palm turned pure black. It was like a massive stone dropped into a lake as it splashed fire in all directions. The seawater around the island was instantly drawn away, and Merging Fire swirled wildly, creating a vast, hollow crater over the sea.

The Merging Fire talisman exploded right next to the two of them, engulfing both in an instant. Li Xijun’s body was flung backward, trailing a long streak of gray flame. Guo Hongkang’s head, already severed by Li Xijun, was blasted away by the Merging Fire.

Body and head flew in different directions. His eyes glowed red as his head spun midair, still muttering faintly. However, his body halted midair amidst the firelight. It calmly formed seals with his fingers to control the wind and deflect Merging Fire. Its robes billowed as it turned to chase after the head.

Guo Hongkang’s decision was unquestionably wise. The instant use of the talisman showed his composure and caution in crisis. Had he not kept it ready in hand, how would he have disrupted Li Xijun now?

Though his head was already gone, only few could take action in that moment of overwhelming fear. Yet he had triggered the talisman without hesitation. Had he hesitated by even a second, he would’ve followed Guo Hongyao and become another soul slain under Li Xijun’s sword.

Li Xijun swallowed blood and skidded to a halt in midair. Frosty mana burst from his Qihai acupoints to resist the Merging Fire clinging to him, but the flames still danced across his body. His vision was shrouded in gray haze; he could barely see.

"My eyes... they’re injured..."

The only way he could have taken such a powerful talisman blast at close range and only suffer injuries to his eyes and face was due to Guo Hongyao’s dharma robe. Though he hadn’t refined it, it was of the Merging Fire and could resist flames to some degree, allowing his body to rise with the fire rather than be incinerated.

His spiritual sense was still usable. Li Xijun spat out a mouthful of blood, letting the blood mist ignite and vanish into flame. Frost flared beneath his feet as he reversed his longsword and flicked out three streaks of sword light.

Guo Hongkang was the one who cast the spell and also cultivated Merging Fire, so by any measure, his injuries were lighter than Li Xijun’s. He had already retrieved his head, but the sword essence coating his neck was like a heavy frost, making it nearly impossible to reattach.

"Sword Essence! Li Xijun!"

Frightened, he fumbled for his pills, only to see three pale sword lights already drifting his way. Li Xijun had reverted to his original appearance, his eyes burned to ashen gray and red-gray Merging Fire still flickering over his body.

In that brief moment, Guo Hongkang understood that he needed time to heal the wound on his neck, and Li Xijun needed time to expel the notoriously sinister and difficult Merging Fire from his body. One of them had to die within the next dozen or so exchanges.

"Guo Hongyao... how is that possible?! It hasn’t even been fifteen minutes since she left, and she still died to him when she had to fly part of the way?!"

At this point, he already regarded Li Xijun’s swordsmanship as equivalent to that of a direct descendant from a sword sect. One hand released several talismans to defend, while the other summoned Merging Fire to form two beams of gray light as he cast a spell and shouted, "Strike!"

The two beams of gray light instantly shot across the sea at high speed. They didn’t even bother to intercept the sword light, they simply slammed straight into Li Xijun, erupting into clusters of gray fire around him.

Li Xijun showed no fear. A band of color flared from his sleeve as the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, which he had held back earlier to avoid exposing his identity, lit up beside him. The mysterious golden light of the screen enveloped him and firmly blocked the gray fire.

Crimson Reef Island did not belong to the Jiangnan Dao lineage, and none of the seven of Chongming Hall practiced the Merging Fire Dao. So the paintings on the screen didn’t activate, but the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, as an ancient-technique dharma artifact, was more than enough to block this spell.

On the other side, Li Xijun’s sword light likewise didn’t bother cutting through the flames, it simply headed straight for Guo Hongkang. The three agile, cunning sword streaks danced as they struck, shattering his protective shield.

"Thank goodness!"

Guo Hongkang watched the sword light in fear. The distance between him and Li Xijun wasn’t great, and since he believed this was the sword cultivator who killed Guo Hongyao in just a few moves, he thought he’d be sliced clean through. But now he exhaled in relief, even feeling a touch of delight as he thought, It must be the pain from the Merging Fire causing his sword technique to be off!

Such things weren’t rare, and the situation was all too familiar for Merging Fire cultivators like him. Once Merging Fire latched onto someone, it damaged treasures and harmed life itself. The longer it lingered, the deadlier it became. The pain was beyond what ordinary people could bear.

Now I’ve got a chance, thought Guo Hongkang.

Since his spell couldn’t stop his opponent, and as Li Xijun drew closer, Guo Hongkang, who had been preparing for a while, finally summoned a flying needle from his acupoint. It was gray-black, about a finger long, and unadorned, yet Guo Hongkang was overjoyed as he and shouted, "Go!"

Li Xijun had already drawn very close when he suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his Shenyang Mansion. His face twisted with both pain and cold. With a single thought, the azure light on the screen beside him flickered, casting a sheet of dark blue radiance around him.

Heavy Abyssal Gale!

The Heavy Abyssal Gale technique of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen was a suppression art, specifically meant to neutralize flying swords and dharma lights. It immediately seized the black needle in midair and slowly ground it to a halt. Although Li Xijun had blocked the needle, he still coughed up blood.

Pfft!

Even though the black needle had not struck him, it had still agitated the Merging Fire inside his body. The assault from within and without threw his insides into chaos. Forcing himself to stay conscious, Li Xijun activated Radiant Snow Pine Ridge, clearing pain and distraction from his mind. The blade in his hand lit up inch by inch as he advanced several steps.

"Damn it!" muttered Guo Hongkang.

When he saw the sword cultivator approach once more, rendering his treasured dharma artifact useless, Guo Hongkang panicked. The fire in his hand blazed, yet now he noticed that the sky was filled with heavy snow. Feather-like sword qi fell upon him, each like a blade piercing through his body, forcing a wretched scream from his throat.

Autumn Moon’s Harmonious Echo!

All Guo Hongkang felt was a shattering sound by his ears. The three streaks of sword qi vanished, while cold surged through his Shenyang Mansion. He had no Foundation Establishment Realm dharma robe to protect him, so his body was instantly reduced to minced flesh, dissolving midair into a rain of fire.

The black jade box tumbled downward, but Li Xijun seized it in midair. Merging Fire still throbbed painfully in his chest. He tucked the box into his robes and rode the wind, fleeing swiftly into the distance.

Though the Merging Fire was still active and he couldn’t use his perception arts for the moment, he had already made a sound deduction, This place is too close to Xifeng Island. Someone will surely come looking! I must leave immediately!

————

Profound Peak Gate.

Clouds swirled and music echoed on Yuexi Peak, the main summit of Profound Peak. The Daoist Master in the central seat wore plain robes, his white hair glistening like jade as it hung down.

He raised his brows and looked to the side, smiling, "Fellow Daoist Junjian?"

A black-clothed man sat at the guest seat nearby, brow slightly furrowed, with a trace of iciness in his elegant expression. He only looked up at the clouds atop the peak, and when the Daoist Master addressed him, he replied, "I certainly don’t have any Bright Yang spirit items..."

He nudged the white jade cup before him, raised his brows to glance at the senior Daoist Master Changxi, and said softly, "Changxiao was busy earlier cleaning up Chengyan’s mess... so he was severely restricted on all sides. He won’t act recklessly now. Although Yushui lacks a Life Divine Ability, both Daoist Masters Hengxing and Kuangyu have taken action... The two of them used Life Divine Abilities to shield everything, Changxiao won’t be able to divine it. This move can no longer be reversed."

Tu Longjian gently shook his head and replied, "The junior doesn’t seem so simple. Changxiao is a master of manipulating fate; it’s still too early to draw conclusions."

The young man raised his brows slightly, then turned to look at Changxi and said, "All of you seem happy to let things unfold this way. Crimson Reef Island also wants the Six Ding Merging Fire Token in my possession. Even Daoist Master Xiao has gone to the Northern Sea. Everyone keeps passing the matter around, until it’s forced to my doorstep, leaving me no choice but to go against Crimson Reef Island."

Daoist Master Changxi, with his head full of radiant white hair, spoke gently, "That’s how it is. Even if you don’t want to choose a side, they’ll force you to. If you wish to remain blameless, you must walk alone."

Tu Longjian stood, gazing calmly at the elder before him, and spoke softly, "Thank you for your guidance, senior. But this time, Crimson Reef Island made the first move. Either Tianwan did it intentionally, or her divine powers were lacking. Either way, reason is not on their side. I have no reason not to intervene."

You’re only willing to go because they’re in the wrong! Otherwise why would they have sent Guo Hongyao in the first place?

Daoist Master Changxi gave him a long, deep look and sighed. "The Li Family are clever people. Their deep push into the Eastern Sea may well rely on your favor. In this chaotic world, even cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm who wield divine powers will end up like Dong Hua if they act solely out of emotion and righteousness."

Tu Longjian laughed heartily as he played with an exquisite and charming small golden hammer that was no larger than a palm. As the great void opened before him, he stepped in, leaving only one sentence behind, "As long as my conscience is clear, that’s enough."




# Chapter 924: Blazing Merging Fire

Guo Hongjian had chased the Dawn Rayfish a long way but was still ultimately shaken off. By the time he returned on Merging Fire, even his escape light had dimmed and his mana was too depleted to keep going.

"What a pity. It's rare to encounter a Foundation Establishment Realm Dawn Rayfish. Creatures of the Heavenly Glow lineage are far too adept at fleeing and can even knock away dharma artifacts. Truly difficult to catch," muttered Guo Hongjian.

The emergence of the Dawn Rayfish was due to the great flood during the Northern Sea’s sky fracture. A Dawn Rayfish had taken the opportunity to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. The conditions for such spirit beasts to evolve were extremely stringent, making it a rare treasure. Guo Hongjian missing it only deepened his regret.

Though his cultivation technique was high grade, his Immortal Foundation, Heart-Flame Aspiration, was not known for vast reserves. But after swallowing two pills, his mana recovered significantly. The Cloudlight Profound Ring underfoot quivered slightly, accelerating his speed. Looking southward, he saw someone riding the wind in the distance.

They were obscured within a dharma artifact. Above him stood eight painting screens arranged in a cylinder, radiating a mysterious golden hue that enveloped him. It seemed like a tiny dot of dull gold on the horizon.

He clearly saw the grey-red Merging Fire flickering across the painting screens, refusing to extinguish no matter how much mana was poured into suppressing it. Guo Hongjian couldn’t help but laugh heartily in his heart, Merging Fire damages artifacts and harms the body. It can't be fully cleansed without several days of nurturing!

Since Merging Fire was not exclusive to the Crimson Reef Island, Guo Hongjian didn’t think too much of it. After flying a bit farther, he spotted a patch of grey clouds above Xifeng Island and several cultivators flitting through them like tiny black dots.

"Hmm?!"

Blazing Merging Fire streamed across the sky. Guo Hongjian came to a sudden halt, his pupils slowly widening.

If he still couldn’t understand at this point, he would be a true fool. His face twisted with murderous intent as he instantly turned around. The cloud ring beneath his feet burst into action as he drew out a grey-red fire token.

He charged back, teeth clenched, "Scoundrel, don’t you dare flee!"

"This man must have harmed Hongkang!"

He naturally didn’t believe his sister Guo Hongyao had died at the hands of this man. Considering the time he spent chasing the Dawn Rayfish, their departure from the island couldn’t have been more than two to four hours apart. At most, the anomaly in the sky meant one death, and that could only be Guo Hongkang.

Even so, Guo Hongjian’s fury was undiminished. Although Guo Hongkang wasn’t a blood relative, he was shrewd and resourceful. Guo Hongjian had always kept him close and often relied on his advice. It was utterly worthless for him to die here.

Rage surged through his chest. Flames rose beneath his feet as he stepped onto the cloud ring and sped forth. The man had already become a barely visible speck on the horizon, but Guo Hongjian had memorized his figure in that brief glance and calculated that his speed was now far inferior.

"Prepare to die!"

Guo Hongjian cultivated the Heart-Flame Aspiration, a technique with a slow escape spell. Thankfully, he had the aid of a dharma artifact. Though still slower than a Dawn Rayfish, he surpassed most others in speed. His vital qi surged, leaving a red-white trail in the air as he rapidly closed in on the golden gleam without a word.

As expected... I knew they wouldn’t let me off so easily, Li Xijun had already noticed his pursuer.

He could have used the Immortal Mirror to perceive the world and easily avoid the man. Guo Hongjian wouldn’t even have gotten close to his shadow. But Li Xijun was meticulous in his thinking. With the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators possibly involved, how could he dare arbitrarily change directions?

Rather than exposing anomalies that would draw the suspicion and silent attention of more Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, thus endangering his family, Li Xijun would rather take on more risk himself. At worst, his plan would fail. But the exposure of the Immortal Mirror could mean annihilation.

When he saw Guo Hongjian drawing near, Li Xijun’s spiritual sense immediately swept over the cloud ring under the man’s feet. It glowed brightly, releasing waves of white dharma light to support the middle-aged cultivator, causing Li Xijun to feel uneasy.

He observed closely for a moment, then his heart stirred. He formed a hand seal and activated the dharma artifact with his spiritual sense. A wave of dim cyan light flickered from the screen as he activated Heavy Abyssal Gale once again.

Buzz...

The sweeping cyan light swiftly locked onto the cloud ring under Guo Hongjian’s feet. It flickered, then the cloud aura dispersed as the dharma light shattered. It instantly reverted to its original form, no bigger than a ring, and was captured by the Chongming Profound Insight Screen.

"What!" Guo Hongjian was stunned and furious as he nearly fell out of the clouds. The fight hadn’t even begun, and he almost coughed up blood. His heart trembled, What kind of dharma artifact is that?! Ridiculous!

Guo Hongjian had just chased a Dawn Rayfish that specialized in knocking away dharma artifacts. He was well aware of many spells and tools that could achieve this. But there was a difference between knocking down an artifact and outright capturing someone's flight tool. This was unheard of!

And to do it so swiftly and cleanly! Since his artifact had been forcibly taken from him, his speed was greatly reduced. Guo Hongjian was no match for the person ahead. He was deeply shaken.

Meanwhile, Li Xijun understood immediately, Heavy Abyssal Gale mimics the gale of the Great Western Plains. Even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators can’t fly in that wind. It doesn’t just knock down dharma artifacts; it disrupts the dharma light that sustains them. Naturally, that includes the cloud ring’s dharma light. None of this artifact’s three effects are simple!

Guo Hongjian watched the distance widening again and felt a surge of greed, yet for a moment, he hesitated, Flying sword? Dharma light? But the distance is too short for spellcasting, and everything else might be knocked down by that ironclad artifact. Who on earth is this person?!

He ran through all the possibilities, realizing that as long as the one using that artifact was fast enough, it would be nearly impossible to counter. But as he hesitated for two seconds, the distance had widened significantly again.

His expression darkened. Pressing two fingers together, he drew out a wide sandalwood-red talisman, upon which was painted a vividly lifelike, scale-covered giant rat.

Guo Hongjian chanted, "Scorching wind, heed my command, shuttle and race as one with fire!"

Li Xijun listened quietly. He sensed the talisman between Guo Hongjian’s fingers release a puff of sandalwood-red wind through his spiritual sense. It transformed midair into a long-scaled crimson rat, howled once, then turned into a gust of red wind, lifting him from below and propelling him north at great speed.

This talisman was not ordinary. Called the Blazing Merging Fire Talisman, it was drawn by the sandalwood cloud rat, the spirit pet of Crimson Reef’s founding ancestor Guo Shentong. The Merging Fire spirit beast specialized in summoning a scorching wind. The talisman was originally crafted for a direct descendant’s escape, but driven by greed and fury, Guo Hongjian didn’t hesitate to use it for battle.

The sandalwood-red fire wind gathered in an instant, and he rapidly closed the gap. Lifting his long command token to his lips, he exhaled, his eyes turning grey-red as he spat out a gout of Merging Fire.

This flame was worlds apart from what Guo Hongkang had wielded. It was thicker, grander, and more scorching. It let out a strange cawing sound as the deep grey flame slammed against the screen with a thunderous boom.

Li Xijun was already injured and low on mana, so the blast nearly knocked him from the sky. Merging Fire blazed across the painting screens, devouring his mana like a whale swallowing water. Without mana support, the light of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen dimmed all at once.

Clang!

As Guo Hongjian controlled the flames, the screen's light suddenly split apart, bursting forth with a dazzling sword light and falling like frost and snow. He watched coldly as a strand of red gauze flew from his sleeve, fluttering and twisting as it entangled the sword light.

The red gauze let out a muffled boom, as though it had restrained a flood dragon. Whatever was within was struggling violently.

Guo Hongjian was surprised, and poured his mana into it as he asked, "Sword essence? Even sword essence is useless!"

He wasn’t like Guo Hongyao; he immediately saw that the person inside the dharma artifact was nearly out of mana. He didn’t even need to act further; just maintaining the fire for seven minutes would cause the man to fall into the sea.

"Lost in the east, gained in the west."

But Guo Hongjian had already grown greedy for this dharma artifact, so a swift and decisive victory was best. Forming a seal with his fingers, he cast his spell and Merging Fire surged. Taking advantage of the moment the man was entangled by the screen’s fire and couldn’t spare attention, Guo Hongjian rapidly gathered flames in his hand.

Though Li Xijun was in dire straits, he remained calm. His pale gray eyes betrayed no emotion. The Chongming Profound Insight Screen's glow had dimmed, and Han Lin had been sheathed and returned to his embrace.

He reached into his sleeve and took out a talisman. The sandalwood-red talisman was the size of a palm and bore the image of a lifelike, scale-covered rat with golden, gleaming eyes that were already brimming with mana.

The Blazing Merging Fire Talisman!

Li Xijun poured his remaining mana into it, mimicking the incantation word-for-word. His voice rang out clearly within the screen, "Scorching wind, heed my command. Shuttle back and forth, merge and charge with fire!"

The talisman released a puff of sandalwood-red wind that transformed mid-air into a long-scaled crimson rat. It let out a shrill cry, then reverted into sandalwood wind, lifting him from beneath and propelling him north at great speed.

Guo Hongjian, hearing that incantation, abruptly stopped his spell. He stared blankly at the vanishing gray-red glow in the distance, his mind completely blank.

"He... how can he have our family’s Blazing Merging Fire Talisman?"

The gray fire in his hands was still flowing as he stood stunned, turned his head to look back at the path he'd come, and muttered in confusion, "How does he know our family’s incantation?!"

Guo Hongjian turned his head back, but there was no trace of anyone left on the horizon. His expression was like a spilled jar of mixed as emotions twisted and transformed.

He exclaimed in shock, "That’s right! I chanted it just now!"

He pondered for a breath, then quickly understood. He took a deep breath, eyes glistening, and squeezed out a few words through clenched teeth, "My little sister... you murderer..."

But a troubling doubt slowly surfaced in Guo Hongjian’s mind amid his grief. It lingered endlessly and refused to disperse, "But even if he killed my little sister... our Crimson Reef Island's direct descendant's storage pouches aren’t so easily opened. Even with an Immortal Foundation specializing in such arts, it would take ten days to half a month! The curses and marking techniques within are also extremely advanced, why was he completely unaffected?

"It can’t be that my little sister took them out and gave them to him herself!"

————

Great void.

A ripple stirred in the pitch-black great void as a woman in a simple Daoist robe appeared, holding a parasol in her arms. Her black hair was pinned back by a hairpin, and her eyes gazed through the void, fixed on the manifest world.

"This..." She hesitated for a moment, then shook her head. "So that’s how it happened... Guo Hongyao... truly pathetic to the extreme."

A Daoist Master remained unseen beside her, but a deep, resonant voice echoed by her ear, "A sharp-minded youngster... and skilled in swordsmanship too."

The two of them could see clearly that the talisman that turned the tide had come from Guo Hongyao. The Guo Family’s storage pouches were notoriously difficult to open, but Guo Hongyao had held the talisman in her palm!

When facing mortal peril, Guo Hongyao’s first reaction had been to pull out this life-saving talisman exclusive to the direct descendants. She had only infused it with half her mana when Li Xijun struck with a sword technique and killed her. Thus, the talisman naturally fell into Li Xijun’s hands.

"And just then, Guo Hongjian happened to be casting spells nearby, so he heard the full incantation clearly..." Daoist Master Hengxing murmured. She extended a slender finger, calculated silently for a moment, and replied gently, "That dharma artifact, after all, was crafted with the ancient method and depicted six True Monarchs. Even if they all attained the Dao and their visages were wiped from the screen, it remains a variable. A slight miscalculation is to be expected."

Though calculations might not be off by a hair and miss by a mile, this small variable happened to collide with a crucial turning point in the conflict, and so slipped beyond her control. She still found it hard to believe and asked, "Isn’t it all just... too coincidental?"

Another Daoist Master revealed himself in the great void. He was an unremarkable gray-robed elder carrying a sword on his back. He kept his hands behind his back as he said thoughtfully, "Do you suspect... that he bears fate?"

The man gently shook his head as he continued, "I cannot divine, nor do I understand fate and destiny. But I vaguely recall one thing. Back then, he was the one who killed Xu Xiao, the one fated to inherit Merging Fire. Could that have had an effect?"

Daoist Master Hengxing pondered for a moment, then shook her head, "The Xu Xiao matter has no logic to it. If killing a fate bearer could grant their destiny, then would Changxiao, Guo Shentong, or Junjian still be alive?

"As for Li Xijun, everything he has done thus far aligned with the calculations. If he bore fate, he would’ve long deviated from the plan. The oversight of the painted screen was mine. Now that I’ve seen its mystery, I won’t err again next time."

The man nodded and asked, "What about Tu Longjian..."

"No harm." Daoist Master Hengxing nodded softly and answered, "Li Xijun’s heart is now shaken by Merging Fire. Just because Guo Hongjian failed to catch him red-handed doesn’t mean this matter is over. It merely means Fellow Daoist Tu Longjian must take the initiative. The necessary games must still be played."

The sword-bearing elder gently shook his head and sighed. "Junjian has an ancient spirit, but it is out of place in these times... As one who wields the sword, I often feel shame in my heart, which is why my sword intent remains unformed. If he had pursued the sword, perhaps he would already be a sword immortal by now."

Daoist Master Hengxing’s voice was gentle as she shook her head, "He has the spirit of chivalry, and such a spirit must be free. He roamed the Eastern Sea unchecked when he was in the Foundation Establishment Realm. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator’s divine abilities could not subdue him. Even the cultivators of the Three Sects could not stop him, so who could? That is the true wind of heroism and righteousness.

"But once he reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he could no longer act freely. A single word may save hundreds, yet on the other end, doom thousands. Who can truly act freely in this muddled world? Even Donghua could not..."

Daoist Master Hengxing pressed her lips together slightly and replied, "When I attained the Purple Mansion Realm, a senior once told me, 'for one who commands divine powers, the eyes are the weakest part of the entire body,' and this is the reason why."

"Oh?" The old man furrowed his brow slightly. He had never heard this saying. Most cultivators who attained the Purple Mansion Realm could even discard their entire body without hesitation, let alone their eyes, so he asked doubtfully, "Daoist friend, please enlighten me."

Daoist Master Hengxing spoke softly, "All people possess compassion. When they witness suffering, they feel pain. Thus, for one who wields divine powers, the eyes beneath their brows become weaker than any other part of their body."

The sword-bearing Daoist silently looked down and replied, "And so, we have the world as it is today."

The two gradually faded into the great void. The old man let out a sigh, his voice low as he said, "Let us see how he chooses to face it."




# Chapter 926: Chivalry

While Hengxing and her companion whispered within the great void, another section of the void glowed dimly with firelight. A black-robed youth sat cross-legged in the void, a small golden hammer in his palm. He looked up and nodded slightly.

The void then shimmered with biting frost and howling wind. A middle-aged woman stood quietly within, watching. Below, Li Xijun had already ridden off on the scorching wind. She shook her head and said with a faint smile, "Quite formidable."

Tu Longjian could not tell whether she was mocking Guo Hongyao or praising Li Xijun, and simply said in a low voice, "Greetings, Senior Tianwan."

"I’m unworthy of the title," Daoist Master Tianwan's tone was as cold as ice and snow. Frost trembled throughout the great void with each breath as she replied curtly.

She was Guo Shentong’s wife, and a direct descendant of the Golden Feather Sect. Years ago, she had eloped with Guo Shentong in the Douxuan Sky, led Crimson Reef Island to its peak, and laid the foundation of its present legacy. She was now the island’s only Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who appeared openly.

Tu Longjian’s voice was clear and earnest as he replied, "The Li Family harbors no hostility toward your island. It was only a necessary act of self-defense... Thankfully, Hongjian is unharmed. I ask for your understanding, Senior."

Now that Tu Longjian had spoken, Daoist Master Tianwan’s form was surrounded by swirling frost. She said coldly, "Guo Hongyao acted rashly and was slain by Li Xijun. Since Junjian owes the Li Family a favor, that matter can be overlooked for your sake. But he also killed Guo Hongkang and stole a treasured item. How do you propose we resolve that?"

Tu Longjian knew full well that Li Xijun’s slaying and looting was likely orchestrated by Hengzhu Dao Gate and was meant to force him down. Everyone watching, especially the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, surely understood this. Moreover, Hengzhu Dao Gate had acted under the guise of aiding the Li Family, which made it hard to denounce.

If he brought this up directly, he would be rejecting Hengzhu Dao Gate’s entire faction and siding with Crimson Reef Island, an Eastern Sea faction. How could he agree to that?
𝗳𝗿𝐞𝕖𝘄𝗲𝕓𝗻𝚘𝚟𝕖𝐥.𝚌𝕠𝕞

So he replied softly, "Your island acts with great force. In his panic, he may have overreacted..."

"Panic?" Tianwan was not willing to let it go. She shook her head and said, "Empty words, Daoist friend... I ask just one thing. You want to protect both Li Xijun’s life and the Radiant Sky Stone? There’s no such bargain in this world. Hand over the Six Ding Merging Fire Token, and we’ll let everything go. From that moment on, you’ll be an honored guest of Crimson Reef Island, and all matters between the Li Family and us will be cleanly severed. Perfect harmony for both sides."

Tianwan had deliberately sent Guo Hongyao and coordinated with Hengzhu Dao Gate—one stoking the fire, the other adding fuel—all for the sake of making this demand. How could Tu Longjian not see through it?

He looked calmly at Tianwan and finally replied, "The Six Ding Merging Fire Token is of great use to me. I cannot hand it over just yet, Senior."

Daoist Master Tianwan’s expression turned cold. Tu Longjian stood quietly facing her. She was a late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with four divine abilities, while he was only at the early-stage. Yet Tu Longjian showed no fear.

There was only one reason. If Tianwan made a move, Hengzhu Dao Gate, who had been fanning the flames all along, would surely take Tu Longjian’s side. And that was precisely the outcome Hengzhu Dao Gate had been waiting for.

Daoist Master Tianwan continued observing him carefully and spoke softly, "In the past, I sent Guo Hongyao to Moongaze Lake to investigate Xu Xiao, hoping to use his destiny to elevate that useless junior of mine. But unexpectedly... Xu Xiao was slain by some other Daoist ahead of us, and the entire plan was thrown into chaos. The Six Ding Merging Fire Token... ended up in your hands instead.

"Though the divine ability has been refined and the past can be forgiven, the Six Ding Merging Fire Token is an ancient spirit artifact. It is no trivial matter, and there’s no rush. Daoist friend, take your time to consider."

Although her tone was icy, her words were not forceful. Clearly, Crimson Reef Island’s current position was not entirely ironclad. This Daoist master, who cultivated the Cold Essence divine ability, had no intention of offending him outright.

But she still has something to rely on... thought Tu Longjian.

Tu Longjian paused slightly. His eyes, burning with hazy flame, peered through the great void into the manifest world. Li Xijun had flown several hundred kilometers but could no longer suppress his injuries. Merging Fire had attacked his heart, and he had collapsed on a distant island.

Daoist Master Tianwan also looked toward the manifest world and spoke gently, "Tu Longjian, my husband bore fate as well. People like you are born noble, with the strength to act righteously, and are always rewarded for your deeds. I’m curious, when ordinary people do good, are they ever repaid?"

Tu Longjian frowned and asked softly, "Senior, you mean..."

Daoist Master Tianwan looked at him quietly and said, "My divine ability tells me that two rogue cultivators will soon arrive at that island. They are from Jiangnan and were once favored by the Li Family. Let us both refrain from using divine abilities. Will those two save him?"

"This..." Tu Longjian ran the scenario through his mind several times. Tianwan’s approach was wild and unexpected, leaving him momentarily silent.

Logically, he practiced the Molten Fire Dao, and Tianwan the Cold Essence Dao, so neither of them were skilled in divination. Their divine abilities clashed within the great void. Since Li Xijun was directly below, any calculation was near impossible.

After long moment, he thought to himself, The Li Family is close to more Purple Mansion Realm cultivators than just me. Besides, I have support, there’s no need to fear her.

If these two remember past kindnesses and choose not to help, then I’ll still have the upper hand...

Having settled his thoughts, he nodded and said, "Then let us wait and see."

————

Eastern Sea.

The Falling Water Rising Storm lingered over the Eastern Sea year-round. A brief moment of clear skies had just passed, and now the skies darkened again as thunder rolled and fine drizzle veiled the air.

Li Xijun flew several hundred kilometers. Merging Fire had already pierced through his eyes, slowly suppressing the effects of the Radiant Snow Pine Ridge. It was only by sheer force of will that he managed to fly beyond the furthest island within the reach of the Qingzhou Reefs.

But when he reached that point the lingering dark force on his body suddenly seemed disrupted, then vanished. The taut string in Li Xijun’s heart snapped with a thud, and he plunged headfirst toward the sea.

Just before hitting the sea, he jolted awake. The ocean below belonged to the Dragon Clan, and teemed with shrimp soldiers and crab generals. In his current condition, falling into their hands would spell near-certain capture. He had no choice but to force himself to fly a little farther.

But there were no islands in sight. In his daze, he spotted a reef and struck it with a sleeveful of mana. A faint cracking sound followed, instantly freezing a block of solid ice upon it.

As he fell, he barely managed to fling out a talisman, enveloping himself in its protection. Li Xijun finally lost consciousness and collapsed with a splash onto the ice.

Rain veiled the world in mist, pattering rhythmically onto the ice.

After a short while, two streaks of flight light approached from the north, trailing faint black tails. Two rogue cultivators in Daoist robes rode the wind to the reef, circling twice before cautiously landing nearby.

One looked over seventy, hunched and stooped as he held a long wooden sword with a cold, stern expression. The other was broad and younger, wielding an axe in each hand. He was thick-browed and sharp-eyed as he warily scanned the area.

The cold-eyed elder glanced at the red-robed man collapsed on the ice and swallowed hard before whispering, "Fellow Daoist Rui, take a look at this..."

The brawny man surnamed Rui frowned and glanced sideways at the flame surrounding the red-robed man. He replied, "That's some intense flames. This cultivator looks seriously wounded and on the verge of death... Wait ten hours or so, and he’ll be in deep trouble."

The old elder swallowed again and murmured, "Fellow Daoist Rui, you have keen eyes. How can we let someone die before us? Let’s save him quickly."

The two exchanged glances and clearly saw the greed in each other’s eyes. The burly man surnamed Rui responded, "Don’t you see the light from that talisman on him? If we don’t deal with that first, how can we ‘save’ him?"

The old elder hesitated for a moment and muttered, "But the Clearing Art Talisman is so expensive... it’s a life-saving treasure. I only have three left..."

But when he was glared at by the burly man surnamed Rui, the elder had no choice but to pull out the talisman from his sleeve. He cast a spell, muttered incantations, and finally pinched off a wisp of blue-green light from his fingertips, commanding, "Go!"

The bluish light burst apart with a pop, but the shield on the man's body only dimmed slightly. The two were stunned and thought inwardly, What a treasure!

Neither of them could recognize the talisman’s type. They were startled when it hadn’t shattered, but the red-robed man remained motionless and their eyes lit up.

The cold-eyed elder said, "We’ve struck gold!"

They now knew the man before them had to be from a wealthy background. The elder hurriedly pulled out two more talismans and got another two from the burly man, drawing all four together into a single point on his fingertip.

Still uneasy, he exchanged a glance with his companion. The two simultaneously drew out their dharma artifacts, gathered their spell force, and shouted, "Break!"

The combined dharma light—everything they owned—slammed into the shield, creating a loud boom. The shield dimmed to the brink of collapse, yet still held. Terrified, they raised their dharma artifacts and started bashing it madly.

After a long struggle, both were panting heavily and their mana was nearly depleted. At last, the light shield shattered with a crack.

The elder, drenched in sweat, collapsed onto the ground and panted, "What a cursed disaster..."

The burly man swept the body with his spiritual sense, only for his hair to stand on end. He jumped back in place and cried out, "Damn it! Foundation Establishment Realm!"

He fled like he’d been stung by a scorpion. The elder froze for a moment, his legs shaking like leaves. He immediately leaped up into the air as the two fled north one after the other.

Sea wind brushed past. After seven minutes, the two returned sneakily, flying in and landing some distance away.

One said, "If he had even a sliver of strength, he could’ve killed us both with a breath."

Emboldened by their own logic, they moved forward again. Once they were nearby, the cold elder reached out his dharma artifact with a trembling hand, his sword shaking as though it would fall. It took two tries before he finally hooked the storage pouch.

He squinted and inspected the pouch closely. An image of a familiar large lake floated on its surface, stamped with a single large character, Li.

"The Qingdu Li Family!"

The two had been in the outer seas recently and were unaware the Li Family had unified Moongaze Lake. They were momentarily speechless as they glanced at each other.

The elder muttered a few words, then looked hesitantly at the burly man, "Back on the riverbank, it was Li Qinghong who saved us with thunder. The one in the sky with the bow was Li Xuanfeng... They did us a favor after all."

The burly man frowned, but the elder had already made up his mind. He said quietly, "Let’s carry him back to the lake. Would the Li Family treat us poorly for it?"

They flew in again, landing near the ice with more composure this time. The burly man surnamed Rui glanced over, then suddenly stopped in his tracks, his face turning fearful as he whispered, "You’ve forgotten what kind of technique we practice!"

The elder frowned in confusion and replied, "What’s the matter? Even beyond the Eastern Sea, there are people secretly cultivating devil techniques in Jiangnan..."

The burly man said fearfully, "You don’t understand! The Li Family is a righteous lineage, and they despise cannibal cultivators above all. We’ve practiced blood-devouring devil techniques and consumed over a hundred lives. How could their elders possibly spare us? You think we’ll get a reward for returning him? He’ll kill us with a single strike!"

The elder was shocked and frightened. After a moment of hesitation, he said, "Then... we can only leave him here... Let’s flee while we can!"

The burly man glanced at him secretly and said in a sorrowful voice, "We already broke his shield and touched his storage pouch. Do you think these families with countless immortal arts won’t notice? If he truly dies and we don’t help, they’ll never forgive us!"

"You—!" The cold elder suddenly felt caught between a rock and a hard place. He muttered, "What are we supposed to do now?"

Seeing his hesitation, the burly man grew greedy again and said through gritted teeth, "Why don’t we just steal his storage pouch and flee north? We can try our luck at Foundation Establishment Realm! Isn’t that a stroke of fortune..."

The elder was tempted. He weighed the storage pouch in his hand, torn with indecision. He murmured, "Fine! We’ll do it your way..."

The burly man stepped closer and examined Li Xijun’s face. After staring blankly for a moment, a chill ran down his spine. He muttered almost inaudibly, "Look at him, he's like a banished immortal. If he looked dim-witted, maybe it’d be fine, but someone this elegant must be a Li Family sword cultivator... who knows how divine his sword arts are..."

"What exactly are you trying to say?!" The elder, now truly uneasy, demanded.

The burly man only whispered, "He must have divine sword skills. Either way, we’re already offending the Li Family. Why not gamble it all on the Foundation Establishment Realm? We’re going to die someday anyway, better to kill him now and have one less threat later...

"Besides, the flames are already killing him. We just need to add two discreet sword thrusts and they’ll never tell how he died. As long as it looks like he was burned to death, they’ll assume it was done by someone who uses fire. But if he survives, he might just come after us for the storage pouch."

Despite being only half-literate in cultivation matters, the burly man made it sound so convincing that it completely bluffed his companion. The elder had always followed the burly man’s lead. Now confused and shaken, he could only watch as the man bent down and picked up the icy sword, hiding in the corner with a lowered head.

The burly man tried drawing the sword twice, but Han Lin refused to leave its sheath. Its cold radiance flared, slicing open his palm and causing blood to gush. He cried out and flung the sword away, clutching his palm with a furious glare.

"Damn it!"

He snatched the elder’s longsword and stabbed down at the man, but it was blocked by the Dharma robe’s fabric. The sword wouldn’t penetrate.

Though he had been full of bravado, his hands trembled as he cried out in panic, "What is this thing?!"

He stabbed three more times, but it was all in vain. Taking a deep breath, he searched the edges of the Dharma robe for a gap and drove the sword toward the youth’s abdomen.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

It felt like stabbing into cotton. The blade made no clear wound, only a series of scraping and grinding sounds as if something rock-solid lay beneath the flesh.

"Ah!" The elder beside him saw clearly the heart and lungs glowing red with a stony hue. The sight burned his eyes, and he leaped back like a startled toad, crying out, "Stone—his organs are made of red stone! Fellow Rui... let’s run! Forget the storage pouch... forget Foundation Establishment Realm!"

The burly man’s face turned red as if he was about to bleed, and he muttered, "Cowardly old man. So what if we die? Foundation Establishment Realm is glorious!"

He focused on the youth’s exposed neck, raised his sword, channeled mana into it, and swung with all his might, striking the youth’s throat.

Sparks flew through the air as the longsword got stuck at the throat. His hands trembled as it took him three tries to pull it out. He struck twice more before finally severing the youth’s head.

The sullen old man’s legs trembled as he stared blankly. The burly man surnamed Rui let out a breath of relief. When he was just about to put away his sword, he saw the severed head shift downward an inch on its own and reattach seamlessly to the body. The skin was smooth and flawless, showing no trace of a cut.

"Ah!"

A cold chill surged through his body. His legs gave way, and he collapsed onto the ground. His teeth chattered uncontrollably as the world spun around him. His eyes couldn’t leave the neck.

All color drained from the old man’s face, leaving him pale as a corpse. When he heard Rui’s teeth chatter, he stammered, "What... what is... going on?!"

"How... How would I know?!" Rui snarled. The old man inched away, his hand outside his robe shaking violently, lips trembling. Rui faltered, "I... I’ve never killed a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator before..."

But seeing that the youth had not awakened, the burly man gradually regained some courage and muttered, "What’s done is done... what’s done is done..."

He actually picked up the longsword again, measured the position, changed to a vertical grip, and struck the center of the brows three times until he split the head in two with a sharp clang.

"Are you trying to get yourself killed?!" The old man’s paper-white face regained a hint of color. Already hunched over, he leaped up like a startled toad and cried out in alarm, "You’re going to die! You’re going to die!"

The old man immediately rode the wind and sped northward, his escaping light tinged with streaks of red. He had clearly used a blood escape technique, as if something terrifying were chasing him.

His light bobbed erratically through the sky, accompanied by howling cries echoing through the heavens, "You’re going to die!"

The burly man surnamed Rui was nearly scared into wetting himself by those crazed shrieks. The severed head had somehow rejoined the body again.

Stars danced in his eyes as he stared at the handsome face before him and muttered, trembling, "It’s not like I haven’t practiced devil techniques... reattaching a head... what’s so strange about that..."

He tried to reassure himself, but knowing the Li Family was a righteous family made the scene before him even more terrifying. The burly man raised his sword for the third time and struck at the neck again.

It took Daoist Rui three slashes to open the neck again. This time, he was ready. He lunged forward, lifted the head, and moved it away from the neck, intending to toss it aside.

But then he froze. The head in his hand had its eyes open. Those pale grey pupils stared quietly at him. That handsome face, paired with those eyes, exuded an eerie sanctity. Despite the colorless hue, Daoist Rui clearly sensed an icy chill within them. His heart felt like it would shatter; his head felt like it had been plunged into icy water; and every part of him shivered from the cold.

The next moment, the youth spoke.

A burst of snow-white sword energy surged from his lips and teeth, transforming into countless blades of frost and snow that blasted forward. Daoist Rui’s scream caught in his throat, and he was obliterated from head to toe. Only swirling snowstorms remained, stirring waves across the sea.

Splash!

Two storage pouches fell to the ground and rolled twice. The head floated back to the body and fit perfectly onto the neck once more. The youth let out a breath, and only then did his pale grey eyes close.

————

Great void.

Tu Longjian had already sensed something was wrong when Daoist Rui entered the game. The situation had turned out completely contrary to expectations. Hengzhu Dao Gate clearly hadn’t made a move to assist. They had not even sent a single message.

Tianwan was not surprised. Tu Longjian’s gaze swept across a certain place in the manifest world, and he too came to understand.

"Changxiao!"

Changxiao, who had previously been delayed by Chengyan’s matter, had clearly been feigning ignorance all along. Now he suddenly struck at Wang Fu, going with the flow and tying up Hengzhu Dao Gate's cultivators.

With this, the Hengzhu Dao Gate could no longer pull Tu Longjian to their side. His only means of saving Li Xijun was to hand over the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. But after bungling the situation, Hengzhu Dao Gate, though they killed Wang Fu, had now made an enemy of Tu Longjian...

So Daoist Master Tianwan stood before him, holding the winning hand, waiting for Tu Longjian to yield the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. Yet Tu Longjian remained unmoved, and thus Li Xijun was beheaded three times.

But Tu Longjian remained calm, seemingly unconcerned. He didn’t even open his eyes to look at the scene in the manifest world. He only gazed quietly at his opponent, in stark contrast to his prior behavior.

Daoist Master Tianwan stared fixedly at him silently sitting in the void, seemingly in disbelief. She sighed deeply and said, "Junjian, you are truly patient and calculating."

Tu Longjian’s voice was calm and steady as he replied, "Senior flatters me. I owed the Li Family a favor. This Radiant Sky Stone repays it in full. From now on, we are even. The rest is none of my concern."

Daoist Master Tianwan glanced at the frost and snow on the sea, shook her head softly, and murmured, "Everyone calls you a chivalrous man, Tu Longjian, but in the end, this is all there is to it."

Having said that, she suddenly felt disinterested.

I had hoped to use the currency of favor to gain the Six Ding Merging Fire Token in a deal without cost. But who would’ve thought he’d be so cold when it came down to it. I’ll have to come up with another plan.

She sighed in regret. After waiting so long with nothing to show for it, and with Changxiao only able to buy limited time, dragging things out would only put her into a passive position. She glanced coldly at Tu Longjian, then vanished in the great void.

Tu Longjian revealed himself above the sea, looked down at Li Xijun, formed a hand seal, and commanded, "Scarlet Sparrow, bear fire and deliver my order."

A hazy flame flew from his sleeve, transforming into a huge sparrow the size of a tiger or leopard. It circled him once, then opened its beak and inhaled. The Radiant Sky Stone, the storage pouch, Li Xijun, and everything else on the sea surface all flew into its belly.

Tu Longjian said softly, "The Radiant Sky Stone is here. Now we’re even."

The bird took his words into its belly as well and rode the wind southward. Tu Longjian glanced around, aware that many were watching from the great void, then turned and left.

He returned all the way to his cave dwelling, where a young man in blue and white robes was already seated. He was handsome with slightly feminine features, and was examining the collection within the cave.

Tu Longjian showed no surprise as he said calmly, "Thank you, Senior Pu Yu."

This man was none other than Daoist Master Pu Yu, his long-time friend. Pu Yu took a seat by the jade table and said casually, "I’ve preserved the soul. After all, he hasn’t learned divine abilities and his name isn’t on the rolls, so he was easy to catch. A few old fellows have died. In all the mainland, I doubt anyone knows more about this than I do. They won’t be able to tell! But you... going to all this trouble, you really thought it through."

Tu Longjian’s handsome face revealed a wry smile as he replied, "There were too many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators watching. If I’d protected him directly, I’d never have peace with the Li Family from then on... It would only convince those scheming against me to go deal with the Li Family instead!

"Only now do I understand Daoist Master Xiao’s way. He wanted to protect, but couldn't be close. Know when to let go... or else you end up harming the very ones you try to help!"

He sighed softly and continued, "Now that’s settled. Li Xijun ‘died’ in front of them, and my debt to the Li Family is cleared. I no longer need to stand openly behind them. They also know now that trying to scheme against the Li Family won’t work on me... It’ll be much easier to maneuver things moving forward."

The black-robed youth shifted the topic and spoke solemnly, "Senior, you master Yin and Yang, life and death. As for Xijun... I leave it in your hands, Daoist Master!"




# Chapter 929: Mistake

Tu Longjian gave a respectful salute. Daoist Master Pu Yu merely sat silently at the table, smiling as he looked into his cup.

Tu Longjian pondered for a moment, then asked in a low voice, "Daoist Master, you are versed in the arts of Yin and Yang. What is the usual price for performing such a technique?

"Several of the necessary treasures are native to my Penglai. I can retrieve them easily. This spell isn’t costly to cast on someone at Foundation Establishment Realm, especially since he’s young and his cultivation is clear and pure... But this art is a closely guarded secret of our lineage and unknown to ordinary immortals.

"Let’s set the price aside for now. I have one question: if I could ask Junjian to resolve it for me?" Daoist Master Pu Yu looked at him, a probing light in his eyes, and said with a smile, "Using this art on a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator is extremely rare. After all, death means death. I dwell in Penglai and wander often. There would be no reason to make advance preparations... If one could prepare in advance, why would one need to die in the first place?"

He stood up, looked back at Tu Longjian, and said with deep meaning, "However, it makes no sense. As soon as you reached the Purple Mansion Realm, you visited my Penglai several times and even waited at the foot of the mountain for years just to see me. Your intention was clear. If we look at it from this angle..."

The smile slowly faded from Daoist Master Pu Yu’s handsome face as he said quietly, "Junjian, did you foresee today’s events the moment you broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm? Even with the great upheaval of Xu State’s civil war in between? That’s beyond calculation. Even a Maha would feel ashamed compared to such planning. Was it a dharma relic? Or the workings of someone else?"

Tu Longjian could only smile bitterly in his heart. He hadn’t prepared for years specifically for Li Xijun! Tu Longjian had worked to build ties with Daoist Master Pu Yu all this time solely for Guo Er, who was sealed inside the Six Ding Merging Fire Token!

Tu Longjian had been mentored by Guo Er for many years. Guo Er had once obtained treasures alongside Zhang Cuotian and others within the Green Pine Temple’s grotto heaven. Later, Tu Longjian had escaped danger thanks to a technique Guo Er left behind there. Since he owed him a great debt, Tu Longjian had always sought to find Guo Er a new body.

It was well known that Daoist Master Pu Yu of Penglai was a master in such arts, which was why Tu Longjian had visited him repeatedly. As for Li Xijun, his case was truly just a timely coincidence.

Tu Longjian replied, "If I merely wanted to sever ties with the Li Family, I wouldn’t need to go to such lengths... The matter with the Li Family is just a coincidence.

"In my youth, I was displaced and lost all my family and friends. Their bodies were scattered and vanished over time. Upon hearing that Senior possessed divine arts to govern Yin and Yang, and is close with Judge Yang, I thought to request your aid, to inquire of the Underworld where my kin’s remains lie..."

He did not bring up Guo Er directly. Instead, he voiced a matter that had long weighed on his heart and said softly, "Even if I can’t know where their bones fell, even if my father and kin ended up in someone’s belly or were turned into dharma artifacts, as long as I can know, I, Junjian, will repay the favor handsomely."

"I see." Daoist Master Pu Yu’s narrow eyes narrowed further as he looked at Tu Longjian thoughtfully. He turned his jade cup, and replied, "So it truly was a coincidence... Junjian, you have a kind heart. In longing for one lost friend, you’ve saved another. Such is fate."

He asked no more and responded, "Li Xuanfeng entrusted his orphan to me, since we once shared a fated connection. Though he is gone, he still barely counts as part of the Li Family. I’ll handle Li Xijun’s matter. Penglai happens to have recently grown a piece of Gaoxuan Bright Frost. I’ll carve out sixty percent and fashion a body for him."

Tu Longjian let out a breath of relief when he realized he wasn’t being threatened with the soul, and drew something from his sleeve. The command token was interwoven with red and black patterns.

A misty red glow formed from the Six Ding Merging Fire Token as he gave it a gentle tug. It was half gold and half silver as it hovered in his palm.

Inside the command token, Guo Er wailed in anguish, his cries shaking the heavens, but Tu Longjian pretended not to hear and said respectfully, "I cannot use Senior’s spiritual item without recompense. This Crimson Gold White Flame was something I obtained before attaining divine abilities. Please accept it as compensation."

Centuries ago, a great snowfall blanketed the Northern Sea, forming a five thousand kilometer snow mountain. Spiritual items of Cold Essence became abundant. But even among them, Gaoxuan Bright Frost was exceptional. At the same time, even if six-tenths were carved out for Li Xijun, it still wouldn’t surpass the Crimson Gold White Flame. Daoist Master Pu Yu understood it was meant to aid the ritual and accepted it with a smile.

The two exchanged a few casual words before Tu Longjian saw him off at the cave entrance. Returning to his desk, Tu Longjian sat down and brought two fingers to his lips, exhaling a puff of flame.

The flame quickly formed into a human shape and immediately wailed, "Tu Longjian! You—you—you! You used my treasure to curry favor—how unreasonable!"

Tu Longjian, rarely seeing him so flustered, was delighted inwardly, but kept a stern expression as he said quietly, "Senior, what are you saying? Do you know why I did this?"

Guo Er glared at him in frustration and replied, "Isn’t it just to repay your precious senior’s favor?"

"Not at all." Tu Longjian replied with a serious expression, "I must repay Senior Yuanjiao’s kindness. Yes, but this was also for your sake.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

"Think about it. Pu Yu is from Penglai. He is ambiguous in nature, neither righteous nor evil. When crafting an immortal body, who’s to say he won’t plant any hidden tricks? If you enter it unaware, wouldn’t you suffer terribly?"

Guo Er, who had been watching all along, had truly not considered this and paused in surprise. Tu Longjian said earnestly, "Once he finishes shaping the body, you too are skilled in this Dao. Though not as accomplished as the Daoist Master, with Li Xijun as precedent, you can inspect and take precautions."

Guo Er had no more words. He looked like he wanted to nod, but held back. After a long pause, he muttered gloomily, "Fine, fine, fine..."

On his end, Daoist Master Pu Yu left the Slaughter Jun Gate and made his way toward the Eastern Sea, traveling through the great void. As he formed seals and cast spells, the blue light in his hand transformed into a cyan sparrow that glided through the void. He silently calculated, Li Xijun... I should examine him thoroughly. This time, Tu Longjian invited me personally, and the timing checks out. There’s nothing suspicious. Even if someone backs him, they can’t fault me.

He gently pressed on the jade box within his sleeve, his heart stirred slightly, Li Xijun’s soul is unusual too. It's cold as snow, as if carrying a thread of fate. Those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators simply aren’t skilled enough to notice it.

In truth, Daoist Master Pu Yu had sensed it when holding the soul. It had resisted slightly when leaving the body, as if it had been tethered to something. These were classic signs of being entwined with fate.

Since Li Xijun was so unusual and the spirit item matched his Immortal Foundation, reshaping a body for him would not be difficult. Daoist Master Pu Yu then began to consider Tu Longjian’s request to find his kin.

His Penglai did indeed have close ties with the Underworld. Judge Yang was a frequent guest, so Tu Longjian’s request wasn’t hard to fulfill. Pu Yu only pondered, Judge Yang’s Nine-Layer Attribute Net is formidable. I’m not sure if that True Essence fell into his hands. Asking directly would be inappropriate; it's best to leave it alone.

A white ocean appeared below his feet, and a small mountain began to surface. Atop it stood a simple Daoist temple. Before even landing, Daoist Master Pu Yu called out, "Bring me the Gaoxuan Bright Frost!"

Eastern Sea.

Waves surged across the sea as hundreds upon thousands of sword shadows from Level Beam peppered the surface. The overcast clouds completely smothered the sun; towering waves crashed skyward; and the entire region was shrouded in mist.

The grand formation that had cloaked everything had been fully revealed. It radiated pulses of golden light as it fended off the dharma artifacts launched by those outside. A red-robed woman had a complicated expression as she activated a petal-shaped ritual implement and knocked down several incoming dharma artifacts.

At Bi Yuzhuang's side, the Feng brothers each wielded spell arts, blocking most of the incoming dharma light. The few that slipped through merely caused faint ripples on the formation's surface, doing little harm.

Yet Bi Yuzhuang felt deeply uneasy. Wang Fu had already been in dire straits, but as a direct disciple of Changxiao Gate, it made no sense for him to die within a few moves.

He had held out for fifty exchanges, and unleashed three talismans in a row. Bi Yuzhuang had even forced out the life-saving Purple Mansion Realm talisman that she had dispelled with a prearranged one of her own.

But now there was a growing crowd outside the formation; the cultivators of Qingzhou Workshop had arrived. Alarmed, Bi Yuzhuang had wanted to end the battle swiftly, but the formation suddenly trembled violently, on the verge of collapse.

"Not good..."

The formation in Bi Yuzhuang’s hands was a treasured item called Yellow Cotton, a formation plate of the Auspicious Essence Dao. It was considered outstanding even among Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. By rights, it should have easily lasted a while longer.

Yet the moment those cultivators arrived, the formation had begun to shake uncontrollably. Bi Yuzhuang quickly realized something was wrong. When she connected to the formation plate through spiritual sense, she took a closer look and saw eight cultivators outside each holding a golden, slightly illusory spike, while another held a jade talisman linking the eight.

"Engraved Golden Astral Profound Destroyer!"

Bi Yuzhuang instantly recognized the dharma artifacts’ origin. It was a treasure from the Golden Feather Sect, famed alongside Azure Pond Sect’s Deadly Thunder Formation Destroyer. Eight of them would be more than enough to trouble a Foundation Establishment Realm formation like hers!
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

This was disregarding the immense value of Yellow Cotton, which was a portable formation plate and nearly impossible to buy. If it were to be broken by these dharma artifacts, the loss would be devastating. It wouldn’t last nine hits against the Engraved Golden Astral Profound Destroyer, which was barely ten seconds of time.

Once the formation broke, not only would the cultivators pour in, but Wang Fu, with his storage pouch full of escape techniques, would immediately flee. Since Li Qinghong and others were secretly aiding her, even if Wang Fu escaped, Bi Yuzhuang could not let them expose their tracks.

She had no choice but to bring the Feng brothers out of the formation to confront the enemy and block the Engraved Golden Astral Profound Destroyer herself. She didn’t believe that this would let Wang Fu escape death, but the worry weighing on her heart remained—not for Wang Fu, but for her Daoist Master.

Why is the Engraved Golden Astral Profound Destroyer of the Golden Feather Sect here? How did they track us down... Changxiao Gate must have acted... this may ruin the Daoist Master’s plans...

She knew that once she left the formation, Daoist Master Hengxing would stay behind to guard it. Although she only understood part of her Daoist Master’s schemes, the circumstances clearly looked grim.

While she thought furiously from outside the formation, the battle within was nearing a conclusion.

Wang Fu’s robes fluttered wildly. His body was riddled with wounds, as lightning coursed over his skin. His bloodshot eyes reflected the crashing strikes outside the formation, yet there was not a trace of joy on his face.

Before him, Li Qinghong rode thunder, commanding lightning at her feet, while Chen Xuanyu held a pitch-black sword in his arms, his expression calm and unreadable.

"Fellow Daoist Li!" Wang Fu looked solemnly at Li Qinghong, his voice hoarse and expression even tinged with acceptance. A large bell trembled and flew forth from his side, blocking part of the surrounding sword qi. He gasped and asked, "I know full well I’ve become a discarded pawn. I presume my private ties with Minghui were exposed before the Daoist Master... He hates Jinlian, and so he wants me dead..."

As he spoke, a deeper thought seemed to flicker in his eyes. He said quietly, "I simply don’t understand what I have done to offend your esteemed family... to warrant being hunted down like this?"

Li Qinghong exhaled deeply and did not answer. One hand held her spear at an angle, while six silver-white command tokens circled the other.

Chen Xuanyu’s sword essence grew sharper, his voice low, "Pay him no heed. Be on guard for deception."

Seeing her silence, Wang Fu growled bitterly, "Changxiao Gate refused to find me a Purple Mansion Realm technique, and I did not resent him for it. But why wouldn’t they let me seek it myself? Lesser Yang is a Dao lineage of Great Liang. If I didn’t travel north to inquire, how else was I supposed to find my Dao?"

Li Qinghong found his words a little too deliberate. As she summoned silver lightning to crash thunderously down on Wang Fu’s great bell, she thought to herself, Though Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are powerful, they can’t observe what’s happening inside this formation unless they pierce the great void and enter. Even Changxiao Gate can neither hear nor see inside here.

She observed quietly. She let her spiritual sense run along the lightning pulses and eventually spotted a jade inside Wang Fu’s storage pouch flickering with dharma light. She silently made note of it.

Beside her, Chen Xuanyu gave him no more chances to speak. Sword light danced from his blade, falling like a rain of blades and pounding on the bell with thunderous booms. Lightning poured like rain, threatening to slice through Wang Fu’s body and forcing him to raise the bell once again for protection.

Cornered and out of options, Wang Fu could do little. Chen Xuanyu had anticipated his movements and flung a golden ring from his sleeve, which transformed into a flash of gold that struck down like lightning. With a deep clang, the bell’s radiance dimmed and its dharma light dispersed completely.

Wang Fu was just beginning to panic when he suddenly felt burning heat across his face, as though under the noonday sun. A brilliant white light seemed to emerge from nowhere into the sky and coalesced into a towering radiant gate.

The gate shimmered with radiant light as it crashed down with blinding speed. Caught mid-movement, Wang Fu had no time to react. He sighed inwardly, There was one more after all!

Li Ximing had been hiding within the clouds above Hengzhu Dao Gate as backup in case Wang Fu tried to flee. This strike had been long prepared, and was backed with immense power. The Radiant Origin Pass was of high grade and landed squarely upon Wang Fu.

Wang Fu’s internal mana was nearly spent. That single blow shattered all his techniques. Several dharma artifacts fell apart, and the Radiant Origin Pass impacted the sea, unleashing a thunderous blast.

Boom!

Li Ximing didn’t dare be careless and channeled all his power to suppress Wang Fu. Li Qinghong dispelled her lightning and descended with Chen Xuanyu. Most of Wang Fu’s body was pinned beneath the glowing barrier, unable to move, and what little mana he gathered was steadily dissolved by the Radiant Origin Pass. His head, exposed outside, remained completely still.

Naturally, the Li Family didn’t dare kill him themselves. The middle-aged man saw their hesitation and said softly, "I’ll do it."

Sword essence flowed along his blade as he ended Wang Fu’s life with one strike. Li Qinghong flicked her spear, hooking Wang Fu's storage pouch. Li Ximing withdrew his mana and retrieved Wang Fu’s corpse. Removing his robe, he drew a small silver-white box from the sleeve.

"Hm?"

But it wasn’t the right time to investigate. Suppressing his unease, he followed the others and slipped into the clouds. Above them, celestial anomalies slowly emerged, gales howled and demonic murmurs buzzed through the sky.




# Chapter 931: Exchange

Bi Yuzhuang’s Yellow Cotton reverted to its formation plate form and was tucked away into her red robe. She glanced at the corpse suspended mid-air. Wang Fu’s body was convulsing and twitching, blood gushing out in streams and transforming into multicolored worms that burrowed into the sea.

His body parts seemed to have wills of their own as they struggled in different directions. In the brief moment it took Bi Yuzhuang to put away the formation plate, his body had already torn into three pieces, each drifting west, north, and east.

Only then did she confirm he was truly dead. She immediately activated the talisman she had prepared, blocking the approaching dharma artifact, then signaled the Feng brothers, who swiftly flew off in different directions.

Taking advantage of the chaos, Bi Yuzhuang herself vanished into the clouds. The Changxiao Gate cultivators below were thrown into disarray. Some scattered in pursuit of Wang Fu’s remains, others split into two groups to chase the Feng brothers, while the rest stood bewildered, unsure what to do.

Bi Yuzhuang let out a quiet breath but stayed alert, aware that a Changxiao Gate cultivator might suddenly appear beside her. She sped southward with the Li Family group and Chen Xuanyu, crossing Tianzhu Island and landing once more on the main island of Suzhu.

They entered the small pavilion together. Only then did Bi Yuzhuang allow herself to relax, hiding her concern as she looked at Li Qinghong and asked gently, "Are any of you injured?"

"No."

Wang Fu had never been a combat-focused cultivator, unlike their side, which had a thunder cultivator and a sword cultivator. Bi Yuzhuang had exhausted his trump cards, and Li Ximing’s ambush struck true... Forget Wang Fu, even his master Zhou Han might’ve died on the spot under such an assault.

Li Qinghong simply took out the storage pouch. Li Ximing placed the small silver-white box onto the table. Wang Fu’s sword, bell, and pearl were now in Chen Xuanyu’s keeping. Their true forms were not large, yet each emitted an enchanting dharma glow as they were laid beside the table.

Bi Yuzhuang looked toward the aunt and nephew from the Li Family and said softly, "Please."

Li Qinghong glanced at the silver-white box, already having some idea of its contents. She showed no hint of disappointment as she gently took it and extended her spiritual sense into it.

An inch-long streak of radiant light swirled inside the box, flicking its tail like a white snake. It darted around the box and, upon encountering her spiritual sense, shrank in fright into a corner.

Unable to identify the item, Li Qinghong passed it to Bi Yuzhuang, motioning for her to examine it. Bi Yuzhuang frowned as she inspected it, then handed it to Chen Xuanyu, who said, "Looks like a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item from the Ancient Merging Dao lineage..."

A hint of desire flashed in Bi Yuzhuang’s eyes, but she refrained from speaking further, simply nodding politely and saying, "Most likely a Whole Pill Dao spirit item of the Purple Mansion Realm."

Li Qinghong let out a quiet sigh and placed the silver-white box to the side. After a brief moment, Bi Yuzhuang spoke, "There’s nothing more valuable on his person. The three dharma artifacts have been split among us. As for the storage pouch, it won’t be easy to open, it might take ten days or even half a month."

She pushed the box toward Li Qinghong, who rested her hand on it and, after a moment’s thought, said gently, "It seems this item is of little use to us for now. Best to leave it with your esteemed island. If any passing cultivators are interested, perhaps it can be exchanged for something our family actually needs."

Since the item had no great use to her family, Li Qinghong naturally didn’t want to bring it all the way back to the inland. Keeping it at home was also unwise, since it might cause trouble for no reason.

At the same time, the allure of a Purple Mansion Realm spirit item from the Ancient Merging Dao lineage to Hengzhu Dao Gate was obvious. As soon as Li Qinghong said that, Bi Yuzhuang’s delight nearly overflowed from her eyes.

She nodded repeatedly and replied, "May I ask what your esteemed family is seeking? I will do my utmost to locate it!"

Naturally, Bi Yuzhuang had no intention of handing it off to some passing cultivator; she clearly intended to claim it for Hengzhu Dao Gate herself. Li Qinghong, too, was pleased that only Hengzhu Dao Gate would know about it, and said calmly, "A Bright Yang spirit item."

Bi Yuzhuang nodded in agreement. Li Qinghong then gestured toward the three dharma artifacts and said softly, "Our family dares not hold onto these three dharma artifacts. Please entrust them to your gate, we hope to exchange them for others of similar value."

"Leave it to me," Bi Yuzhuang nodded in reply. Chen Xuanyu also spoke up, his voice steady, "Fellow Daoist Qinghong is wise. My Chen Family likewise can’t openly carry these items; let’s exchange them all together."

Having eliminated an enemy and gained the chance to obtain a coveted treasure, Bi Yuzhuang was in high spirits. She smiled as she said, "Very well."

Li Qinghong looked toward Li Ximing. The young man showed no sign of disappointment, only a hint of weariness in his gaze. She said gently, "Ximing, go ahead and choose a dharma artifact. I’d like to speak with the elder a bit longer."

Li Ximing immediately rose and left. Since she had said so, Chen Xuanyu naturally stood up as well. The dignified, sword-bearing middle-aged man said courteously, "I’ll go take a look too. It’d be better than making another trip later. Saves us some effort."

The two were led away by Hengzhu Dao Gate cultivators to view the treasury. After a moment of hesitation, Li Qinghong said softly, "Senior, does your esteemed family happen to have a Purple Mansion Realm inheritance of the Rainbow Mist Dao?"

"Rainbow Mist?" Bi Yuzhuang thought for a moment, then understood and replied, "That’s rare. It usually appears among the dragon clans or the Luoxia Upper Sect’s Dao lineage. Our Hengzhu Dao Gate does not possess it, but I can keep an eye out for you."

Li Qinghong shook her head and replied, "No need to go out of your way, just asking. But if any Bright Yang Dao lineage or items other than the Radiant Origin Pass appear, and it’s convenient, please send a letter to my lake estate. I’d like to stay informed. Ideally, it would be a Bright Yang spirit item."

"Alright." Bi Yuzhuang responded softly and said, "Qinghong, there’s no need to worry too much. Things often take unexpected turns."

Li Qinghong was already deep in thought. Hearing those words made her a little more uneasy. She no longer had the heart to continue chatting and stood to take her leave, but Bi Yuzhuang quickly said, "If you’ve chosen your dharma artifacts, Daoist Chen is also returning to Jiangnan. Traveling together with your companions would ensure everyone looks out for one another."

Li Qinghong naturally welcomed the idea and respectfully took her leave. Once she exited the quaint and elegant pavilion, she descended the stairs and noticed that Li Ximing had not gone to select any dharma artifacts. He was simply standing to the side, waiting.

"This is..."

Li Qinghong looked slightly puzzled. The young man’s face was thoughtful, and as mana surged around him, he transmitted his voice to her, "Aunt, if Bright Yang spirit items truly are that rare, perhaps we should consider trying the Rainbow Mist Dao Purple Mansion Realm technique... Brother Xizhi is already in the late Foundation Establishment Realm. His innate talent isn’t lacking, and his temperament is far steadier than mine..."

Li Ximing’s expression remained contemplative as he continued, "We could wait endlessly for a Bright Yang spirit item, which may only delay things further. That wouldn’t be ideal... As for advancing to the Purple Mansion Realm, the longer I hesitate, the more dangerous it becomes. Even if I fail, there’s still Minghuang. If the Rainbow Mist technique is good enough, we could let Brother Xizhi try it. It might open up a different path for him."

Li Qinghong pressed her lips together and looked at him, worry and unease in her apricot eyes. She shook her head and said, "I understand. For now, go choose a dharma artifact. We need to leave quickly. Given your eighth brother’s cautious nature, he’s surely gone ahead to investigate the island. If he finds out the spirit item wasn’t taken out, he’ll definitely make other plans.

"I... worry about your younger brother."




# Chapter 932: Penglai

Li Ximing entered the treasure vault alongside the red-robed disciples of Hengzhu Dao Gate. Chen Xuanyu walked ahead with him, while Li Qinghong quietly followed a step behind, somewhat lost in thought.

Though Hengzhu Dao Gate was considered orthodox, Li Qinghong dared not fully trust it. Still, whatever she needed to exchange, she could only go to Hengzhu Dao Gate and no other. There was no other reason; her family’s spirit item taken from Wang Fu belonged to the Ancient Merging Dao lineage and had already been revealed before the Hengzhu Dao Gate cultivators, who practiced the same Dao. There was no hiding it now. With Bi Yuzhuang’s desire plainly written on her face, Li Qinghong had no choice but to go along with the flow.

But when she thought more deeply, suspicion crept in, Could the Ancient Merging Dao spirit item Wang Fu brought out be part of Hengzhu Dao Gate’s plan? This journey was far too easy. Why did the Profound Peak Gate urge my family to make this trip? Surely, their motives lie elsewhere.

After this journey, Li Qinghong felt as though she had been led by the nose. Deep down, she already understood that what her family wanted and possessed had long been laid bare before all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

My family is not like the Xiao Family. We have no Xiao Xianyou laying a foundation for three hundred years, nor the scheming of Xiao Chuting. Ximing has cultivated Purple Mansion Realm secret techniques, but can the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators see it? If they can... hiding it is pointless.

Now, only one thought filled her heart, Whether my family can break through to the Purple Mansion Realm depends on whether the various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators will allow a cultivator surnamed Li among them. Even if it was allowed, it would be just a trial, the chance of success may still be pitifully low.

Even as she remained deep in thought, Li Ximing had already come to a stop up ahead.

A red-robed Daoist retrieved a small crimson-yellow flag from the spirit shield. It was embroidered with a red sparrow and had five rays of red light drawn around it. He introduced it, "This item was acquired by our Hengzhu Dao Gate from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven. It is called the Yang Li Red Sparrow Banner and possesses abilities to spew spiritual flames, dispel spell arts, vibrate with separation light, and impact spiritual sense.

"This treasure comes from a grotto heaven, so its materials are naturally excellent. Unfortunately, it was forged during the later years of the Dongli Sect and is not of ancient make. It's a few notches inferior in comparison."

When he saw that Li Ximing looked tempted, he reminded, "This dharma artifact’s flames are ferocious. It is best suited for cultivators of the Li Fire Dao. If your cultivation method clashes with it, you likely won’t be able to use it. Even if it is unrelated, the dharma artifact may burn the wielder... If the method isn’t of Li Fire, it’s best to at least be of Fire Virtue."

Chen Xuanyu glanced at it carefully, then softly said, "The Bright Yang Dao seizes light and captures flame. Its fire arts are just below the Five Fires. This piece would serve well in hand."

Though Chen Xuanyu had not seen Li Ximing act much earlier, he had already witnessed the power of the Radiant Origin Pass and now spoke kindly, "Ximing’s cultivation method excels at suppression. Li Fire can be used to refine items. Its incinerating power is just below True Flame, but it's more enduring and burns fiercer with time. It suits Ximing’s Immortal Foundation quite well."

Li Ximing nodded, set the item down, and continued browsing the vault. The three dharma artifacts from Wang Fu were all extraordinary. Naturally, Hengzhu Dao Gate would not bring out standard-issue dharma artifacts.

However, there was only one of the Bright Yang Dao among those currently displayed. This dharma artifact was a flask used to suppress enemies, and clearly too similar in effect to Li Ximing’s Immortal Foundation. There was also a powerful sword of the Cold Essence Dao, but since Li Xijun already had Han Lin, taking it would be redundant.

After careful consideration, Li Ximing still decided to take the Yang Li Red Sparrow Banner. Though it was a Li Fire dharma artifact, it came from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven of the Bright Yang Dao Lineage, and was thus suitable for Bright Yang practitioners as well.

Li Ximing turned to look at Li Qinghong. After she nodded, Chen Xuanyu took out a treasure pagoda and stored the artifact. He showed no joy, likely because his own arsenal was already complete. This item was probably destined as a reward for others.

The three of them took their dharma artifacts and went together to bid farewell to Bi Yuzhuang. The red-robed woman seemed to have received some news, and came forward with some hesitation, looking only at Chen Xuanyu as she softly said, "Fellow Daoist, please take this White Wan with you and help escort Qinghong and the other back to the Li Family. I leave the spirit veil in your care for now; someone from our Dao Gate will retrieve it later."

She revealed a swathe of white silk in her hand. It was clearly the concealment dharma artifact used earlier when ambushing Wang Fu. Chen Xuanyu did not ask further. He simply took the silk, bade her farewell, and departed with the two.

The red pavilion was suddenly quiet. Bi Yuzhuang sat down by the table, finally showing a trace of guilt. She let her head sink into her hands, unease creeping into her heart, Qinghong must think I sent Xijun away on purpose... harmed him... I was clearly helping her. How did it come to this?

She had a good impression of Li Qinghong. She had just praised Li Xijun, yet now found herself blamed for his death. Her heart was a tangled mess. When the red-robed Daoist stepped forward to report which dharma artifacts the two families had taken, she couldn't be bothered to listen and simply waved him away.

True, trading with an early Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator for a Purple Mansion Realm spirit item is an unbelievably good deal, but such things can’t be measured like that...

Bi Yuzhuang paced the room twice. That silver-white box still sat on the table. She gazed at it for a moment and silently thought, Let me hold onto it for her... If something happens in the future, this gives the elder a reason to lend a hand.

————

Penglai.

Penglai was said to be an immortal mountain above the Eastern Sea, appearing and disappearing at will. Most of the Three Sects and Seven Gates regarded it as a grotto heaven. Very few had ever set foot inside, and the cultivators within were scarce. There were only a scattered few dozen silhouettes across the vast white expanse.

The sky here was snow-white, with neither sun nor moon, yet quietly infused with radiant light. Mountain ranges undulated beneath the sea, which was itself white. Small islands dotted the water between the two vast white expanses.

Spirit fish swam within the sea, and reefs and spirit trees of all colors adorned the sea with vivid contrast. Two cultivators in ancient Daoist robes, their hair bound in ceremonial crowns, walked upon the water, chatting merrily.

A young man in white stood before them, hands clasped behind his back, curiously observing the scenery. Yet the two Penglai cultivators seemed not to notice him, walking straight toward him without hesitation.

The youth in white did not move aside; his form seemed illusory. The two Penglai cultivators passed straight through him as though he weren't there. He remained where he stood, gazing out at the sea as he sighed, "So this is Penglai..."

Lu Jiangxian had long been curious about this place. Strictly speaking, he had not truly entered it. He was watching a reflection within the mirror, a scene projected by the Immortal Mirror’s core, which, through talisman seeds planted in the great void, was channeling images back through the jade box that held Li Xijun’s soul.

Having been trapped inside the mirror for over a hundred years, Lu Jiangxian had endured immense psychological torment. Even watching these illusory visions returned from afar, he still conjured a physical form to walk through them—if only for a sliver of solace.

Though Li Xijun’s soul had left his body, the talisman seeds remained linked to him.

The people of the Li Family often believed that talisman seeds resided in the Qi Sea acupoint, for ever since they started cultivating, the small white seed could be sensed resting at the base of the Qi Sea. It was quite easy to recognize.

But as the one who had implanted them, Lu Jiangxian understood them more deeply. Once talisman seeds were introduced into the body, they did not just reside in the Qi Sea, but also within the Shengyang and Juque acupoints. If a Li Family member formed a divine ability, the talisman seeds could also be glimpsed within those two centers.

Rather than saying the talisman seeds were located in those three acupoints, it would be more accurate to say they could be visualized there through inner focus. That was why, though the Li Family had long feared others might detect the talisman seeds within the Qi Sea, in truth, even a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual sense probing the area would find it utterly empty.

Since Li Xijun's soul had been preserved and not dissipated, the talisman seeds naturally had not returned either. They remained linked to him, and once he obtained a new body and resumed cultivation, he would be able to see the talisman seeds within his Qi Sea once again.

Therefore, Lu Jiangxian had no concern that Li Xijun would fall into some prenatal confusion when his body was rebuilt, or that the cultivators of Penglai might uncover the secret. Even if they captured and interrogated Li Xijun’s soul, the talisman seeds would still function.

As for this round of Purple Mansion Realm contention, the gains are not insignificant. Lu Jiangxian followed the two Daoists, sorting through his thoughts, There seems to be little true resistance among the sects and factions toward the Li Family forming a Purple Mansion Realm. On the contrary, many appear willing to go along with the flow... After all, no existing Purple Mansion Realm cultivator bears a deep grudge against the Li Family. At most, it’s just the clashing of pawns, not a real conflict.

At worst, Changxiao Gate and Crimson Reef Island are somewhat unwilling, but it’s not to the extent of wanting to wipe them out...

After all, in the eyes of the Purple Mansion Realm elites, Li Ximing wasn’t particularly impressive. Giving him even a twenty percent chance was probably overstating it. In Lu Jiangxian’s opinion, more than half of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators thought the Li Family was currently just flailing. The one truly worth watching, Li Zhouwei, was still a long way off.

As Lu Jiangxian thought things over, the two Penglai cultivators ahead came to a halt. Two more figures descended from the Outer Heavens. The one in front wore the garb of a Penglai cultivator and was slightly older, with an air of immortality and Daoist grace.

He was followed by a youth wearing a Daoist crown, clad in gold-embroidered robes. His appearance was unremarkable, but a peachwood sword hung at his waist, and he had an enormous sword case strapped on his back.

It was luxurious and elegant, engraved with 128 cloud patterns. The case had sixteen sword slots that sealed sword qi within.

"Hmm?"

Lu Jiangxian trembled slightly in surprise. He actually recognized this person. It was the sword immortal Wang Xun of the Yinghua Wang Clan! This was the great-grandson of Xiaojin True Monarch of the Xiao Metal lineage, and the son of Daoist Master Yingyuan.

This youth had an impressive background. In his quest to witness the sword intents of the world, he had once visited the Li Family to observe Li Chejing’s sword intent, and had even left behind Wanglin Blossom seeds as compensation.

Now that his sword case had taken form outside his body, with all sixteen sword intents gathered, it was clear he had already cultivated a divine ability.

Though now honored as a Daoist Master, Wang Xun still retained a pure and lively spirit. His youthful charm was evident, and he was far more sociable than in the past. Smiling, he greeted the two Penglai cultivators, "Greetings, fellow Daoists."

"We dare not! We dare not!"

The two cultivators quickly stepped aside to avoid his bow, speaking in hushed tones, "This junior pays respects to the Daoist Master!"

"Eh." The middle-aged cultivator clearly didn’t care for such formalities. He stopped the greeting, waved the others away, and led Wang Xun back with a smile. "Fellow Wang, if I’m not mistaken, this is your first time visiting our Penglai Immortal Mountain."

Wang Xun nodded. The two descended directly down onto a barren mountaintop, upon which sat a dilapidated Daoist temple. It had a well out front, with a broken wooden bucket resting on the edge. It hardly resembled a place fit for a Daoist Master.

The middle-aged Daoist seemed entirely unbothered and pushed the door open. The two sat down in a side room within the courtyard, and started sipping tea. Lu Jiangxian casually sat on the threshold, his white robe embroidered with sun and moon motifs draping loosely as he listened with folded arms.

When the middle-aged cultivator took his seat, Wang Xun recalled some of the polite phrases he had memorized. He decided to start by praising the man's Dao lineage, and with a smile, glanced at the jade shelves on either side and said without thinking, "Fellow Daoist, your Dao Collection here is truly..."

He had only spoken halfway when the words caught in his throat. The jade shelves were completely bare. Where one would expect ancient books and jade slips, there was nothing but a single turtle shell.

Wang Xun stared in a daze. His compliment was stuck mid-sentence, and his rehearsed flattery now hung awkwardly in the air. Unsure what to say next, Lu Jiangxian glanced at him and silently thought, I thought the young Sword Immortal Wang had matured. Turns out he had simply memorized it all ahead of time.

Seeing his discomfort, the middle-aged Daoist quickly spoke up, "Just so you know, Fellow Daoist, here in Penglai Immortal Realm, we never keep books or slips on shelves. Our entire Dao lineage is stored within the Kongtong Immortal Text, preserved beneath the sea. If ever needed, we access it directly with spiritual sense."

Wang Xun let out a breath of relief and responded without hesitation, "To think such a treasure exists, this Immortal Realm truly lives up to its name."

His answer made the middle-aged Daoist pause, then smile and counter, "Do you know the reason behind it?"

"I’d be glad to hear it in detail!" Wang Xun was beginning to find his rhythm and replied cleanly.

The middle-aged Daoist chuckled. "This rule has been in place since the founding of Penglai Immortal Realm. It's been countless years and was established by an Immortal Lord, so no one has dared to violate it. The reason... is actually quite a curious tale."

He stroked his beard and began to recount slowly, "It is said that many immortals resided in Penglai in ancient times. Countless immortal arts and techniques abounded. Then, one such Immortal Lord named Chufu traveled the Nine Continents and encountered another Immortal Lord in the ancient Jin State.

"The two had a disagreement over their Dao lineages, and a quarrel broke out above the Jin River. As is often the case with immortals, their words held power, and the river began to flow backward, flooding a mortal army.

"The Immortal Lords themselves were unharmed, of course. But the Jin State’s army below was forced to retreat, altering a fate that was meant to be.

"As a result, both Immortal Lords were chastised by the Heavenly Dao, with endless roaring thunder. Chufu Immortal Lord had no choice but to return to Penglai... only to discover that the other Immortal Lord had secretly followed him. With his extraordinary auditory arts, he managed to overhear and read the entire Dao Collection of the grotto heaven!"

"What?" Wang Xun was stunned for a moment, and found it hard to believe, but upon reflection, it felt oddly reasonable. He replied, "After all, the arts of Immortal Lords are beyond measure."

The middle-aged Daoist sighed softly and answered, "Chufu only realized it afterward and flew into a rage. The two fought in the Outer Heavens, causing the Golden Crow[1] to shift from its place and the stars to veer from their courses... Several Immortal Lords came to watch the battle, and it disrupted the mortal realm's formation plates, making spiritual energy shift every three days...

"Though the two eventually reconciled and became friends, and the other Immortal Lord even gifted him a stele inscribed with immortal arts that was sunk into the sea, this tradition has been passed down ever since..."

He chuckled warmly, subtly revealing the depth of his Dao lineage, then glanced at the turtle shell on the jade shelf and smiled. "As for this turtle shell... After the two Immortal Lords became friends, Chufu took to placing a turtle shell on the shelf. He said the other Immortal Lord had practiced techniques for avoiding the Three Disasters and Nine Tribulations and for achieving immortality, and thus was overly cautious. The turtle shell was a gentle jab at his nature."

1. 金乌 (Jīn Wū), literally "Golden Crow," is a mythological creature in ancient Chinese legends, often symbolizing the sun. According to myth, there were originally ten Golden Crows residing in the Fusang tree in the eastern sea, each taking turns to fly across the sky and illuminate the world. However, one day all ten rose together, scorching the earth, and the archer Hou Yi shot down nine of them, leaving only one to represent the sun. In cultivation settings, “金乌离位” (the Golden Crow leaving its position) can metaphorically suggest a cosmic disturbance or imbalance in celestial order, often used to describe powerful battles or heavenly disruptions. ☜




# Chapter 934: Making Amends

"Oh." A hint of embarrassment rose in Lu Jiangxian, who had been crouching by the door, as he thought, So that's why... I’ve wandered all over Penglai for so long without seeing a single manual or jade slip. It was all sealed away with a Dharma relic.

He shook his sleeve and muttered, "Sticking to outdated rules! Stubborn tradition... What age are we even in? Are cultivation methods still such inconvenient things?"

After a moment's thought, Lu Jiangxian began to suspect that the one who fought with Immortal Lord Chufu might have been an Immortal Lord from the Green Pine Temple. After all, this so-called Heaven-hearing technique resembled divine sense in many ways, so it might indeed be linked to Green Pine Temple.

"A scholar’s borrowing... how could that be called stealing?"

He mocked himself under his breath, just for amusement, then shifted his position so that the turtle shell disappeared from view. Wang Xun had already begun speaking in a soft voice again, "There are records in my family showing that Immortal Lord Chufu attained the Dao in ancient times and was a true Immortal Lord of great power. Later, the Immortal Lord borrowed a Fruition Attainment of Manifest Earth from among the Five Earths, first borrowing then seeking, and drew out the Sixth Earth, Azure Manifestation, from emptiness. His merit was boundless, and my family’s True Monarch has always offered incense to honor him."

The middle-aged Daoist sighed and nodded, "Our predecessor was immeasurably powerful and meritorious. We juniors are ashamed by comparison."

Wang Xun merely looked up at the jade rack and muttered, "Elder Dianxing, since you say that the Immortal Lord is immortal and can avoid all Three Disasters and Nine Tribulations, perhaps he still exists in the world. This Immortal Realm truly is daring... Even if he has already become one with the Dao, the great void surely remembers him."

His words made Dianxing even more embarrassed, and he could only sigh, "Who wouldn’t agree? Otherwise, how could our Penglai end up in such a state, without sun or moon?"

It was true that Penglai had neither sun nor moon, but Wang Xun had seen many such grotto heavens before and hadn’t thought much of it at first. He nodded, and Dianxing continued, "This still depends on the turtle shell the Immortal Lord himself placed on the main peak. No one has ever dared move it. I reckon... if someone were to take it into the manifest world, it might cause the sun and moon to shine together and give birth to the light of duality in the great void... and that might just pierce the heavens again."

After their small talk ended, Wang Xun finally said, "I came this time with one more matter that I hope you can assist with, elder."

He spoke softly, "My father acquired a dose of Six Xin Harmonising Metal and promised to protect the Jiang Family.[1] The Wang Family has always honored its word. Our True Monarch hopes the Jiang descendants can sever their worldly ties and find a safe haven, so we won’t have to keep watching over them, nor fear unexpected events.

"But now it seems the branch of the Jiang Family that led the Yu Family to ruin has itself been exterminated. Just as the Jiang Family once split the Yu Family, so too have they been split. The other involved families have become mortals, while the loyal An Family has returned to its former standing. Justice is served, Jiang Heqian may now be freed."

Naturally, Wang Xun could not bow, so he simply cupped his hands in salute, "I ask that the Immortal Realm prepare a secluded place for him to dwell in peace."

Dianxing fell into thought. Meanwhile, Lu Jiangxian had already risen and was descending the stone steps, thinking to himself, Dianxing mentioned a stone wall in the sea with immortal arts engraved on it. It's likely similar to the immortal wall in Green Pine Temple. But I don’t know which of the Four Seas this is in, or if it even still exists. Once the Li Family attains Purple Mansion Realm, perhaps we can go searching.

Lu Jiangxian could now traverse the great void and search the seas, but the Eastern Sea was vast beyond compare. Moreover, Lu Jiangxian had never revealed his true form in the manifest world, so the effort would be considerable. The Li Family was at a critical juncture, and he couldn’t afford to look away. If Li Ximing failed his breakthrough, Lu Jiangxian would have to search on his own.

He walked across the sea and returned to Daoist Master Pu Yu’s temple. The young man was drawing dark gray water from a well and pouring it into a large cauldron, tapping the cauldron's side with one hand while calculating with his fingers.

The jade box lay at the bottom of the cauldron, radiating silver light beneath the rippling water. Its glow echoed the prismatic hues of Penglai’s secret techniques. Lu Jiangxian watched from the side, silently committing everything to memory.

Profound Peak Gate.

The main peak of Profound Peak Gate, Yuexi Peak, was shrouded in mist. Though not tall at first, the mountain had grown taller year by year, and now towered above the surrounding ranges like a crane among chickens.

Jade and stone littered the ground in the cave dwelling at the summit. Daoist Master Changxi sat cross-legged in the central seat, holding a small piece of jade in hand, eyes shut as though in cultivation.

After half an hour, the Daoist opened his eyes with a trace of helplessness. With a wave of his hand, the cave doors rumbled open, and the woman in embroidered robes who had been waiting outside stepped in and bowed respectfully, "Tingyun greets ancestor!"

Though she had waited outside for a long time before being admitted, she still knelt respectfully. It was Daoist Master Changxi who now showed a hint of helplessness and spoke softly, "Tingyun, what brings you here?"

Kong Tingyun replied respectfully, "I received word from Bi Yuzhuang that Wang Fu possessed an ancient Purple Mansion Realm spirit item, which has now fallen into the hands of the Hengzhu Dao Gate. The Li Family returned empty-handed. This left me puzzled, so I came to seek your audience."

Daoist Master Changxi remained silent, understanding Kong Tingyun’s true intent, but he was unsure how to respond. The embroidered-robed woman gently continued, "Long ago, ancestor, you placed pieces within the Li Family and instructed me to become acquainted with Li Yuanjiao. Back then I was ignorant and immature, but fortunately did not spoil the greater plan...

"As our ties grew deeper, I believed the two families could rely on each other. But the information we provided regarding the Radiant Sky Stone was flawed. Qinghong believed it to be the reward promised by our Profound Peak Gate after Azure Pond Sect’s flood... yet our gate turned around and exploited it again.

"I felt it would be difficult to offer the Li Family a proper explanation, so I came to seek your instruction."

With utmost respect, she said quietly, "I mean no disrespect, I only fear disrupting your grand design."

Daoist Master Changxi gave a light cough and finally spoke, his voice aged and weary, "I know your words have always been pleasant. There were many players involved in Wang Fu’s case. No one expected Tu Longjian to act as he did, which pushed the situation this far..."

Seeing Kong Tingyun still kneeling with head bowed, his tone shifted slightly, and he said hoarsely, "The Li Family must be given an explanation... I won’t sacrifice your rapport or dignity just to benefit Profound Peak Gate."

Kong Tingyun quickly responded in alarm, "Ancestor, you speak too heavily!"

Daoist Master Changxi shook his head and waved a hand. "That island in the lake she dwells on seems to be missing a formation? Choose a day to visit, and invite those veteran formation masters from Splitreed Island to craft one for her. Would that do?"

Kong Tingyun respectfully answered, "Formations are far too sensitive a matter, I fear it’s not the right gesture for mending relations."

Daoist Master Changxi frowned and said, "The Li Family is indeed cautious. Just go visit them and explain the matter. I have a Bright Yang spell here, once acquired by our Kong Family from Xu State. Giving it to them would suffice for now. As for what comes next, we’ll see then."

The woman in embroidered robes bowed low to the floor and softly said, "Tingyun obeys."

Daoist Master Changxi sighed lightly and instructed, "You’ve worked hard to gain this opportunity in the grotto heaven. Don’t exhaust yourself any further, wrap these matters up quickly. I’m getting old. If you enter closed-door cultivation soon, I can still watch over things for a while and offer some stability."

# Chapter 935: Orchid

Several months later, at Moongaze Lake.

Formation lights shimmered across the lake isles, reflected in the serene azure waters. Above the main continent, cultivators came and went. Streaks of light chased each other as they descended around the lake. An air of prosperity and bustle filled the scene.

A cloud veiled in white spiritual gauze silently drifted in from the east. As Chen Xuanyu came to a stop above the lake, Li Qinghong stepped forward and immediately expressed her thanks, "Thank you for all the trouble along the way, Senior."

"It’s nothing." Chen Xuanyu nodded, hand resting on his sword. The blue sash on his pleated robes fluttered in the wind, giving him an elegant air as he spoke lightly, "I merely circled Xifeng Island a few more times. It took little effort, and it's hardly worth calling trouble."

He seemed somewhat distracted, clasping his hands as he said, "I still need to make a trip to the Great Western Plains, so I won’t impose further."

Li Qinghong studied his expression carefully and replied gently, "This junior understands. If you will be staying long in the west and not in Tongmo Prefecture, I’ll send Xijun to visit you there instead."

Her words responded to an earlier invitation from Chen Xuanyu, spoken with good reason. Yet Li Qinghong noticed his gaze shift slightly before he nodded and replied, "Very well."

He swept his blue-and-white patterned sleeves, performed a parting salute, and rode his cloud westward. Li Qinghong silently watched him leave, her almond eyes lowering.

Throughout the journey, Li Ximing kept both hands tucked into his sleeves, seemingly feeling chilled. As he and Li Qinghong passed over Xifeng Island with Chen Xuanyu, they saw no sign of Li Xijun, but that didn’t mean they returned empty-handed.

Remnants of Merging Fire still blazed fiercely above Xifeng Island, with gray-red clouds churning in the sky. It was clearly an ominous sign. At the time, Chen Xuanyu had glanced twice, then said to the aunt and nephew, "I fear a Merging Fire cultivator has fallen."

Upon hearing those words, Li Ximing’s heart sank halfway to ice. As they traveled, he flew fifty kilometers with the wind, three times hesitating and looking back, finally asking, "Do either of you elders feel a chill in this place?"

Li Qinghong remained silent the entire time, offering no reply.

Li Ximing felt nothing but a bitter northern wind in the area. Li Qinghong had to call him twice before he came to his senses and followed along, floating all the way back to the island.

There, dressed in crimson-black robes, Li Chengliao stepped forward and greeted them respectfully, "Greetings to both elders."

Li Qinghong stepped into the hall, flipping her hand to store away her long spear. Li Ximing quietly followed and sat down to the side. Li Chengliao then recounted the matter regarding the visitors from Azure Pond Sect.

Li Yuanqin and the others had returned the bow and waited aboard the Dawn Cloudliner under the Heavenly Glow for some time, but never disembarked again. The remaining visitors, including Ning Hemian, had roamed the island for a few days before bidding farewell on their behalf. The cloudliner had then departed.

Li Qinghong gave a faint sigh and said, "You handled this matter well; there was little else to be done. Returning the bow will surely spark some debate, but it has nothing to do with our family. Just observe and leave it be. And what of Azure Pond?"

Li Chengliao promptly replied, "There’s unrest in both the Southern and Eastern Seas. It seems the Lingu Family is backing the Si Family, and they’re coming on strong. A few days ago, there was discussion to send Uncle Xizhi to the Eastern Sea."

Li Qinghong nodded. Since Li Xizhi hadn’t come to inquire at home, it likely meant the Li Family didn’t need to interfere. As for Li Chengliao, not seeing Li Xijun return left him faintly puzzled, but noticing the poor mood of the two before him, he dared not probe and only said softly, "In recent months, a fire sparrow has been circling above the lake, appearing and disappearing, seemingly searching for something. It moves with great speed, and we haven’t been able to catch it..."

"Has it harmed anyone?" Li Qinghong asked, and seeing Li Chengliao shake his head and gesture that the matter could wait, she dismissed him. Li Ximing immediately grew restless, excused himself, and sped off toward Mount Qingdu.

Li Qinghong waited in the hall for several seconds before Li Ximing rushed back, descending on radiant light and exhaling in relief, "Aunt! Xijun’s life jade is intact, only slightly dimmed!"

Seeing his spirits lift, Li Qinghong couldn’t bear to say more and only nodded lightly, thinking to herself, If someone at the Purple Mansion Realm interfered... then of course it wouldn’t shatter. Against such divine powers, these simple tricks are barely worth mentioning!

Li Ximing clearly understood this as well, but seeing that Li Qinghong showed no joy, he simply sat beside her. The Yang Li Red Sparrow Banner flipped back and forth in his sleeve. He took it out and began silently refining it.

After fifteen minutes, Li Qinghong suddenly looked up and saw a hazy red light rising into the sky. She scrutinized it for a second, then drew her spear, saying, "I fear it’s a Molten Fire demonic creature!"

The aunt and nephew rode the wind beyond the formation, and sure enough, standing outside was a fire sparrow as tall as a person. Its eyes gleamed with spirit as it examined the two. Its body was wreathed in hazy flames, each feather distinct. Yet its aura was murky and its strength unreadable.

Unlike ordinary sparrows, its neck was longer and more graceful, while its wings were slightly larger. Its eyes glowed gold-red, and the hazy firelight it gave off made the two feel a searing pain on their faces

Unclear of its origins yet sensing no hostility, Li Qinghong cupped her hands and said, "May I ask, fellow Daoist..."

Flames before the fire sparrow condensed into two ancient seal-script words, Slaughter Jun. It then spoke in human tongue, its voice high and sharp, "I come bearing the directive of Daoist Master Junjian, please receive the decree within the formation."

"Daoist Master Junjian?"

The two were stunned for a moment. Though they didn’t know what command Tu Longjian had issued, they dared not show any disrespect. Li Qinghong recognized the flame as indeed from the Molten Fire Dao, but they had never before received a directive from him and couldn’t tell if the fire sparrow was real or fake.

The grand formation on the island behind Li Qinghong was only at the Qi Cultivation Realm. It was meaningless as a defense against Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators like them. She wasn’t worried about anyone intruding, and the fire sparrow seemed proper enough, so she suppressed her unease and spoke softly, "Please."

"Very well!" Her gesture of trust softened the fire sparrow’s tone. It stopped in front of the island's main hall, flapped its wings to stop the pair from inviting it inside, and opened its beak to spit something out.

Thump.

Li Ximing’s face flickered with the glow of Molten Fire, its light casting shifting shadows across his cheeks. He heard a heavy plop as something landed before him, a pitch-black jade box that rolled once, and he instantly snatched it up.

His spiritual sense surged into it instantly, and he saw a thumb-sized white stone, radiating brilliant Radiant Light like mist and smoke. Within the whiteness ran intricate, luminous patterns. Daylight churned within the box like a swirl of bright white sunfire—just brushing it with his spiritual sense caused his Immortal Foundation to tremble.

Radiant Sky Stone!

The thing he had dreamed of day and night was finally in his hands. Li Ximing’s pupils widened and his face lit with joy as he looked up, only to see another dark shape spew forth from the fire sparrow’s beak.

It landed with a thud in front of him. It was a corpse, rigid and still as it lay face down.

The young man’s gaze fell on the corpse’s snow-white longsword. Li Ximing’s brows twitched violently, furrowing downward while his brow rose upward. He craned his neck back, his face blank with confusion.

He stood frozen, clutching the black jade box, then slowly bent down to grab the corpse’s collar and turned it over, studying the face. The man’s face was charred black almost to the bone, yet the remaining details of his cheeks and frame matched.

In his heart, Li Ximing thought, This must be Xijun.

He picked him up and noticed two slashes on Li Xijun’s neck. Clearly, he had been decapitated more than once.

Squinting, he heard the fire sparrow chirping rapidly, "...so he killed Guo Hongyao and Guo Hongkang to seize the spirit item... was then spotted by Guo Hongjian... fled heavily wounded and collapsed on a small island... was found by two rogue cultivators and beheaded... but he killed them right before dying..."

Li Ximing listened in a daze, his heart seething with hatred but with no one to direct it toward. Thoughts churned within him until he realized... he hated himself most of all.

He vaguely heard his aunt Li Qinghong choke out a thank you, and the fire sparrow opened its beak again, its voice resonating, "The Radiant Sky Stone is delivered. Our matters are now settled!"

The flames before him surged upward as the bird transformed into a streak of radiant fire and soared into the sky. Li Ximing remained numb and unaware. The corpse in his arms had only been held together by spellcraft. Now that the spell had faded, a burst of cold swept forth.

The chill raced from his neck to his face, and suddenly his arms felt empty. The solid weight vanished.

Clink, clatter

Red stones spilled to the ground. He reached out to grab them, but they had already tumbled down his robes and struck the floor. Looking down, he saw a full set of heart, lungs, spleen, and liver that were each crimson-red, stone-like in texture, smooth and glistening, lying on the stone tiles. A scent of pine wafted through the air as heavy snow began to fall all around.

The snow drifted down from the heavens, carrying waves of pine fragrance, settling softly upon his robes. Snow piled upon Li Ximing’s shoulders as rustling sounds filled his ears.

He thought, Of course... when he was on the brink of death, he took Earth-View Bloodstone to stay alive.

Li Ximing stared at the Bloodstone in the snow, struggling to reconcile the scattered red rocks with his dashing, elegant younger brother. Then he heard Li Qinghong’s voice beside him, "Ming’er, gather his things."

She took out a jade box and carefully picked up the organs one by one, placing them inside with crisp clinking sounds. Then she scooped two handfuls of pine-scented snow and gently sprinkled it over them, speaking softly, "I’ll take care of this—just gather the rest."

Only then did Li Ximing come to his senses. He gathered the remaining items and clutched them to his chest, soaring off the island atop Radiant Light. Glancing back, he saw snow blanketing the entire island. A cold wind rose from the forest, circled the sky three times as if reluctant to part, then drifted steadily eastward.

————

Li Ximing returned the items to his cave dwelling, then hurried back out, riding the wind to hover above the lake. He watched the snowfall until the sky began to brighten, then slowly made his way back inside.

Several items sat quietly on his desk. The most striking was the glinting Han Lin, but next to it lay the now-revealed ancient dharma artifact, the Chongming Profound Insight Screen. A pitch-black jade box rested on one side, while the dharma robes from Crimson Reef Island were piled to the other.

Li Ximing picked up the snow-white longsword and turned it over in his hands a few times before setting it aside. Then he reached for the storage pouch. Li Xijun’s storage pouch was plain white. Li Ximing, who also knew the Li Family’s secret techniques, easily broke the simple restriction Li Xijun had left in place.

His spiritual sense swept through it and found it nearly empty. There were only just a few neatly arranged spirit stones, some talismans, pills, and a handful of precious golden talismans of the Shamanic Dao, with one already used.

Aside from those, there was only a single, small jade box and nothing else.

"Is this the storage pouch of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator? He must’ve planned for this all along, and been willing to trade his life for that item! That’s why he left everything else behind!"

It felt like he’d been slapped across the face. The haze on his expression vanished, replaced by a grief so raw it surged to the surface. His eyes shut tight, as his jaw clenched.

It was a long while before he could collect himself. He coughed up two mouthfuls of blood that never touched the ground. They turned into Radiant Light midair and dissipated.

Li Ximing rested by the desk until the sun rose high. At last, he wiped his mouth and took out the sole jade box from the storage pouch. It was no bigger than a palm, ordinary in texture, and cold to the touch.

He had thought it might be a treasure plundered from Crimson Reef Island, but upon closer inspection, he realized the jade box was of Li Family make. It was a standard issue for their direct descendants, used to store dharma artifacts.

Thinking it over, Li Ximing couldn’t recall anything that Li Xijun would need to take out instead of leaving at home. He murmured, "Could it be... that he left something inside?"

Li Ximing placed the box on the table, set both hands on the edges, and gave a gentle tap. The lid popped open by itself.

He glanced inside, his pupils dilated suddenly, and he cried out, "You!"

His hands trembling, he slowly lifted the lid entirely. Inside, resting on white silk, lay a pale-blue, lapis-lantern orchid. It was a sight that was all too familiar, yet no matter how many times Li Ximing imagined the possibilities, this flower should never have appeared here!

This dharma artifact was an exquisitely crafted woman’s accessory. Each stamen glistened under sunlight, and every petal unfurled in graceful beauty. It was like a venomous scorpion, stinging him full-force in the face.

Li Ximing leaped to his feet, covering his eyes, shaking his head again and again like a drunken man as he stumbled backward three or four steps before collapsing onto the ground.

Crash!

The jade tables and stools clattered to the floor. The lapis orchid, like a vengeful ghost, fell from the desk and rolled a couple times before coming to a stop right before him.

Basking in the warm sunlight, the orchid still held the elegant charm of youth. It lay quietly on the floor, its petals glowing with golden hues and its shadow casting a blooming silhouette.

Li Ximing squinted at it, as his breathing grew hoarse. Memories flooded back; those strange little moments, Xijun’s frequent downcast eyes, and a bitter voice echoed in his ears.

You make your mess, and I’m the one who has to clean it up.

No wonder... no wonder... you... you didn’t let her go! Of course! A cautious man like you, how could you have let her go?! Xijun... you... you!

He slowly raised his head and let out a sound that was part wail, part sob, "You killed her!!"




# Chapter 937: Shifting Political Climate

Mount Qingdu.

Cold rain fell steadily. The newly budding lotuses by the lakeshore were hit by frost, drooping feebly and plunging into the water to turn muddied and gray.

Li Qinghong cradled a jade box as she ascended Mount Qingdu. She noticed the stone steps had grown increasingly mossy, but a clean path remained because Li Xuanxuan came here every few days. After walking a dozen steps, she saw rows of green stone steles standing tall.

Li Ximing was still nowhere in sight; she knew he wouldn’t be able to come for a while. Only Li Xuanxuan was there, dressed in a gray-blue robe with his sleeves rolled up, holding a stele as he squinted and carved.

When he saw Li Qinghong approaching, the old man asked, "Have the arrangements at the foot of the mountain been settled?"

"Yes. Xijun never married or had children, so there are no troublesome matters," replied Li Qinghong.

Li Xuanxuan blew the stone dust from his hand. The woman stood beside him and softly said, "Perhaps he felt guilty and forbade himself from taking a wife."

The old man turned the stele and set down the stone chisel in his hand, replying, "I’m getting on in years, so let me speak a little more. Qinghong, hear me out."

He sighed and continued, "Among the four Xi’s, Xijun was closest to me, and also the most ruthless. Killing the Meng Family was something he could do... He didn’t care if he bore guilt, or if he was harshly judged. He was willing to eliminate even himself for anything that hindered Ximing from attaining divine power.

"If he hadn’t been born into our family, he surely would have become a cunning and unpredictable figure of the Devil Dao."

Li Xuanxuan propped the stele upright and said hoarsely, "Yuanping told me long ago that Xicheng and Xijun were selfless and heartless to the point of making people uneasy. It was true after all."

Li Qinghong carefully set down the jade box and spoke softly, "Uncle, I’m not as skilled in strategy as my elder brother. This matter with Wang Fu ended up being someone else’s scheme. I..."

Li Xuanxuan waved his hand and replied in a hoarse voice, "You did your best. No need to blame yourself."

Li Qinghong stood silently for a moment, then descended the stone steps. She saw several of Li Xicheng’s children coming up the mountain to pay respects to their second uncle. They respectfully addressed her as 'My Lady’ when they saw her.

Li Qinghong hurried past them, rode a bolt of lightning across the sky, and paused on the island. Once she was inside the main hall on the island, seeing that there was still no sign of Li Ximing, she let out a deep sigh.

But Li Chengliao, who had been waiting for quite some time, stepped forward and said softly, "My Lady, a letter has arrived from Zongquan Island!"

As he handed her the letter, he spoke concisely, "There is news about Chenghui. A few days ago, he took the pills sent from home and broke through to the ninth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He said that he suddenly felt the urge to break through in the outer sea, where water descends and thunder rises, upon reaching the ninth stage, so he went into seclusion."

Li Qinghong’s brows furrowed slightly as she said, "This child made the decision on his own... The Azure Pond Sect’s reward hasn’t even been delivered yet. We could have still exchanged for a few Essence Gathering Pills. Why wouldn’t he say anything and just enter seclusion like that?"

Li Qinghong knew that spiritual energy could surge at times, and the opportunity for breakthrough could also arise suddenly. Yet she had spent many years on the island and knew that child well, so she still thought to herself, He probably feels he hasn’t contributed much to the family, while most of his siblings died in battle, so he can’t bring himself to speak up...

"Second is Master Monk Kongheng... he’s inquiring about Uncle Xijun." Li Xijun was Li Chengliao’s second uncle, so he was dressed in mourning garb. His eyes carried sorrow as he said softly, "Several months ago, the Master Monk suddenly swore to renounce attainment and coughed up three pints of blood. After much reflection, he believed it had something to do with Xijun but didn’t dare leave rashly. So he hurriedly finished writing this letter to inquire."

Li Qinghong unfolded the letter and saw that Kongheng had written, I once swore an oath to Xijun, owing him a debt I would repay even at the cost of my life. I believe such vows should not be made lightly. I fear Xijun is in trouble... that’s what caused me to cough blood... I beg Your Excellency to investigate with caution!

Li Qinghong silently put the letter away. She hadn’t involved Kongheng in the matter with Wang Fu, feeling like it was dishonorable to begin with. Even though Changxiao Gate opposed their family, she didn’t consider it a matter of righteousness.

The Li Family had never claimed to be overly virtuous. In today’s world, all they could do was treat the people well and avoid blood food. As for seizing spirit items from enemies, that they could do, but Kongheng could not.

He practiced the ancient Buddhist Dao, which emphasized a pure heart. Asking him to do such things, even if he agreed, could easily lead him off the right path. Kongheng had labored tirelessly, repaying the favor of achieving a breakthrough into Master Monk. He had served the family diligently for decades, and naturally Li Qinghong did not want him caught up in such matters.

She held the letter, uncertain how to respond, for a while before putting it away quietly with her lips tightly pressed. Then she saw Li Chenghuai rushing over on the wind.

Li Chenghuai had now reached the seventh stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. By rights, he could attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm with some pills, but he didn’t feel confident and kept delaying. After all, he was still far from sixty and planned to wait for the right pills.

He said quietly, "My Lady, a cultivator has come to the island. He’s from the Northern Sea, practices thunder arts, wears a long sword at the waist, and is dressed in silver-feather thunder robes. His aura is quite fearsome."

"He calls himself... Xi Zikang of the Northern Sea!"

————

Eastern Sea.

Splitreed Island lay north of the Crimson Reef Island sea region. Vast and expansive, its fire vein was especially vigorous. The Azure Pond Sect’s immortal peak stood at the island’s center and had once been guarded by Ning Wan. Thus, it was filled with pine and bamboo, and the forest breezes were tranquil and serene.

Si Tongyi, clad in a red feathered robe that shimmered with iridescent light, flew through the sky like a flaming phoenix and gently landed atop the peak. After a brief moment, a burst of rainbow light shot out from the summit and landed before him, transforming into a dignified man.

The man had a youthful appearance, and his face was like sculpted jade. His features were gentle yet grand, not overly soft. His eyes, however, brimmed with authority. He cast out two sleeves of Heavenly Glow with a flick and came to a steady halt.

"Greetings, Peak Master!"

Si Tongyi noticed how the rainbow mist came and went without a trace. He was inwardly startled, thinking, Li Xizhi’s cultivation has advanced again! Even my perception techniques can’t see through that escape light... The Rainbow Mist lies between water, fire, and yang, and with the Fruition Attainment of Luoxia manifesting in this era, he’s truly formidable now.

Li Xizhi nodded gently. Now that he was overseeing the Eastern Sea and had grown stronger, his age and stature lent him natural authority. All the cups and bowls on the table floated up with a light lift of his hand, and the tea in the jade pot began to boil on its own.

This technique used no visible mana, only a strand of rainbow light, displaying his masterful control of spell arts.

Si Tongyi’s guess was correct; Li Xizhi’s strength had once again increased. On one hand, he’d received rewards and taken treasured panaceas and pills, further perfecting his cultivation. On the other, it was due to his talisman qi, Rainbow Pierce Skyway.

This talisman qi had shown its might several times in pursuit and evasion as it dissolved others’ mana. More importantly, it could be continuously nurtured to preserve one’s life and enhance their spell arts. In his early years, Li Xizhi had focused on studying spells and hadn’t explored it deeply. But now, with his cultivation at its peak and the nurturing of his Immortal Foundation, its effects became more pronounced.

Each time he nourished his Immortal Foundation with talisman qi, the power of his spells would increase. Whether it was his escape spell, footwork technique, perception technique, or spell arts, they all advanced together.

He was far more effective than other cultivators, who painstakingly honed each skill individually or took targeted spirit herbs. His already strong escape spell and footwork techniques became more refined, while even his weaker offensive and defensive arts were now becoming presentable.

"Moreover, this talisman is said to be the icing on the cake. The more balanced and complete one's aura, the higher their position and the firmer their command, the more powerful the talisman qi becomes!"

At first, he thought the talisman qi’s boost was minimal. He thought that there would only be small progress after much nurturing. But now that he was overseeing the Eastern Sea, the golden light of the talisman qi in his body had grown dozens of times brighter. Gradually, he grasped its wonders, and his strength rose steadily.

Si Tongyi, seated beside him, became even more respectful and said softly, "This time I came to see you, Peak Master, regarding sect matters."

"Go on." Li Xizhi gave a slight nod. Though he was newly promoted to a high position, his conduct and demeanor were unlike someone who had been cloistered within the sect for years.

Si Tongyi, familiar with him, spoke frankly, "Three days ago, Daoist Master Buzi appeared in the Eastern Sea and fought with the Daoist Master of Crimson Reef Island. Rumor has it that even the reclusive... that is, Daoist Master Tanyun revealed himself. We can now confirm, the great demonic beast has indeed broken through. Crimson Reef Island now has at least two Daoist Masters."

Though he spoke in the name of the Azure Pond Sect, the worry in his eyes was clearly directed toward Chi Buzi, as he said softly, "According to many, for Daoist Master Buzi to cause even Daoist Master Tianwan to suffer losses, it would mean that he must have reached the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm!"

After saying this, he silently observed Li Xizhi. The man did pause for a moment, then relaxed his brows and sighed, "He truly lives up to being the Chi Family’s prized prodigy of the past, to have such cultivation speed..."

"Yes," Si Tongyi replied softly and lowered his head.

Li Xizhi asked in concern, "Has the elder given any instructions... or is there a plan?"

Si Tongyi hesitated. "Our Daoist Master has not appeared in a long time, and the family elder has been quite tolerant of the Chi Family. Some have grown increasingly emboldened. When they heard of Daoist Master Buzi’s appearance, the main hall atop Azure Pond Peak was filled with cheers."

Li Xizhi smiled and said, "Celebrating who?"

"Of course, celebrating the sect master!" Si Tongyi gave a knowing nod and answered, "Elder Ning Hejing was also overjoyed... As for Daoist Fubo, there’s been no news."
𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝚠𝚎𝚋𝗻𝗼𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝚘𝐦

The current sect master Chi Xuxiao was from the Chi Family’s proper first lineage main branch. Leaving aside the secluded Chi Zhiyun, Chi Buzi’s emergence now added immense authority to his standing. Meanwhile, Ning Hejing was overjoyed beyond measure.

Chi Fubo had better start worrying... thought Li Xizhi.

Li Xizhi poured himself some tea and asked, "How does the elder intend to respond?"

Si Tongyi replied softly, "The family elder released Xia Yun and brushed aside the matter of Ning Hede. He turned away all the complaining disciples and no longer received any visitors."

Xia Yun and Ning Hede were under Ning Hejing. Though both were capable, they lacked moral integrity. One diluted quality while managing Xieqi Peak, and the other embezzled from the Immortal Tribute Office. How could they outmaneuver Si Yuanli? So, one had been imprisoned and the other interrogated. The offensive had originally been aimed at Ning Hejing’s Yuanxing Peak, implying he was unfit for his post.

Now, all their efforts had gone to waste, and Si Yuanli had shut himself away in silence. With the Chi Family backed by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it seemed they had stabilized the situation.

Li Xizhi, however, was not surprised and nodded. "The elder has played a fine move, but the act must be carried through completely. Next, we must give up either the Eastern Sea or Southern Sea."

"Yes." Si Tongyi nodded but still looked concerned as he answered, "But the elder still worries about Daoist Master Buzi. There’s widespread panic within the sect. Most of them remained neutral, and even many Daoists close to our family have defected to the main peak..."

"No matter." Li Xizhi said softly, "This will only make Ning Hejing more confident. With a Daoist Master above him, he wouldn’t dare move against the elder no matter how emboldened he feels. But he’s headstrong and stubborn. He won’t be able to tolerate Chi Fubo and others still holding most of the power.

"Chi Fubo has likely abandoned his scheming and will back off. But the Chi Family behind him are no better than Ning Hejing. They won’t easily give up what’s already in their grasp. No matter what, they’re still Chi blood, and if pushed, they’ll bare their fangs all the same."

Si Tongyi gave a slight nod and said, "The elder thinks the same. He’s already planted agents within. I'm afraid you may need to endure some grievances later, Daoist."

Li Xizhi understood all too well that the Lingu Family of the Southern Sea had deep roots. No matter how stubborn Ning Hejing was, he wouldn’t be foolish enough to provoke the Lingu Family. Most likely, the burden would fall on him instead. He smiled and nodded. After a few more polite exchanges, Si Tongyi rode the wind and departed.

Li Xizhi sat quietly on the peak for a while, his expression gradually calming. As his mana circulated, he flew down the mountain with the help of the grand formation, landing beside the guards and saying, "Let her come up."

A few moments later, a graceful and airy woman arrived, her face bearing a hint of amusement. She wore a pale jade Daoist robe and was striking in appearance. She was none other than Lingu Lanying of the Lingu Family.

She took her seat again and said softly, "You arrived just in time. Lord Si certainly holds you in high regard, Xizhi."

Li Xizhi, stationed in the Eastern Sea, had actually known about Chi Buzi’s matter even before the rest of the sect, let alone Lingu Lanying sitting before him.

She let out a soft laugh and said, "So Daoist Master Yuan Xiu truly won’t show himself."

Daoist Master Yuan Xiu had yet to make an appearance. The two had previously suspected he might have been injured in a grotto heaven. But seeing how composed and decisive Si Yuanli was at the moment, it was clear Yuan Xiu was simply refusing to show himself.

"Daoist Master Buzi is truly still alive. It seems he has no lingering attachment to the Azure Pond Sect," said Li Xizhi.

Lingu Lanying nodded, and both of them understood the matter clearly in their hearts.

Though Yuan Xiu was confident Chi Buzi wouldn’t meddle in the Azure Pond Sect’s affairs, he still couldn’t predict the old man’s true thoughts. So he secluded himself and feigned death, leaving all matters to Si Yuanli.

If Buzi did return or had a change of heart, the old master only had to step in and say it was all done without his knowledge, and everything would blow over. As long as Yuan Xiu didn’t personally act to replace the sect master, it would never escalate to the point of disgracing both Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

Si Yuanli was a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Even if something went wrong, Yuan Xiu could protect him. But as for the rest of them...

We are mere political tools. If things really take a turn, we’ll be sacrificed to pacify the elder’s fury and preserve the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' face.

Lingu Lanying didn’t say it aloud, but she was clearly calculating. She merely said softly, "Now that Buzi has acted in the Eastern Sea, on the surface it seems like he’s offering the Chi Family a remedy. But looking from another angle... doesn’t it also prove he’s been wandering the Eastern Sea all along, without the slightest interest in what happened to the Azure Pond Sect?"

Li Xizhi nodded and replied gently, "Purple Mansion Realm cultivators never act without calculation. All we need to do is observe the power struggle within the sect."

Lingu Lanying chuckled and shook her head in reply. "Do we even need to think about it? Chi Zhiyun can see clearly that Ning Hejing is domineering by nature. He’s suited for enforcing law, but if he is made sect leader, he’ll drive out everyone who doesn’t align with him! How could he possibly outmaneuver Chi Fubo?"

She swallowed the name Li Yuanqin without letting it pass her lips.

But then she noticed the young man in front of her sip his tea and speak softly, "Let's offer help at the right time. After all, easing the sect master’s burden is our duty."




# Chapter 939: Owing Nothing

Li Qinghong waited in the hall for a while before Li Chenghuai arrived with a youth. The young man wore a silver-feather thunder robe whose collar was embroidered with purple patterns. A sword hung at his waist, and his eyes shone with piercing light.

He spotted Li Qinghong the moment he entered and clasped his hands in a formal salute. His voice was clear and his speech was crisp and decisive as he said aloud, "Xi Zikang, a thunder cultivator from the Northern Sea, greets you, fellow Daoist!"

Li Qinghong nodded slightly and replied softly, "I am Li Qinghong. Well met, fellow Daoist."

"I have long heard of your great name." Xi Zikang had his black hair tied back, with a faint purple mark on his fair forehead. He appeared youthful and gave off a bright aura. His age was unclear, but his gaze was pure as he spoke gently, "I reside in the Northern Sea and have heard of the Zhao-Yue conflict. As I journeyed south, I wished to first pay a visit to your esteemed family."

Li Qinghong didn’t know his background, but the youth was courteous, and as a thunder cultivator, he naturally didn’t give off any ill feelings. She nodded and said, "Our household has encountered some upheaval. I apologize if the reception is lacking..."

After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Xi Zikang considered his words before speaking in a steady voice, "My family has long resided in the Northern Sea, and have been cultivating the Profound Thunder Dao for over eight hundred years. We have some foundation but lack in Celestial Thunder arts. One of my purposes for this visit is to exchange for such arts with your esteemed family."

He had chosen a mild topic to open the discussion. Li Qinghong took a small sip of tea, feeling her thoughts settle. The Li Family had two Celestial Thunder arts, both derived from the Profound Thunderpool. One was the third-grade Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique; the other was an ancient method, the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique. Both started from third-grade, neither reaching fifth-grade. Li Qinghong had also cultivated them.

There’s nothing that can’t be offered in exchange, thought Li Qinghong.

Simply put, the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique wasn’t considered powerful by the current standards of the Li Family. While it was strong for a third-grade technique, it shortened one’s lifespan and cut off descendants. What truly held value were the three Profound Thunders, the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique.

Moreover... could someone travel thousands of kilometers just for one technique? My arts stem from the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling, so it’s not hard to guess. He’s probably here for the grotto heaven and is merely sounding things out.

Li Qinghong had always felt a faint gloom surrounding the Thundercloud Grotto Heaven. So she nodded courteously and replied, "Very well. Our family is also facing hard times, and your family’s thunder arts belong to the righteous Dao. As long as we agree on the price, there’s no issue in proceeding."

Xi Zikang smiled faintly and said softly, "I’d like to take a look at the opening scroll first."

Li Qinghong summoned someone to bring out the jade slip. The Li Family had long prepared recorded excerpts for the younger generation to choose from, so there was no need to transcribe anything anew. Xi Zikang waited a while, and when a crisp chime echoed at the front of the hall, Radiant Light shimmered as a young cultivator stepped inside.

The cultivator wore a white Daoist robe with a gray-golden inner layer. His features were upright and handsome. His eyes were slightly open, and celestial light flowed gently around him. He raised his brow and gave Li Qinghong a formal bow. Someone behind him brought in the jade slip.

"Li Ximing of the Moongaze Li Family."

Xi Zikang noticed his slightly hoarse voice, but his tone was calm, so he paid it no mind. He turned over the jade slip in his hand and read it. Surprise flickered across his brows as he said, "Profound Thunderpool? Is this your technique, fellow Daoist?"

Li Qinghong’s Immortal Foundation wasn’t a secret, so she simply acknowledged it. Xi Zikang hesitated and said, "To be honest, I’ve also heard of this Immortal Foundation... it belongs to the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling."

He raised his brows and looked at Li Qinghong, speaking gently, "This method is a substitute for Celestial Thunder’s Winter Thunderclap, but it’s called Profound Thunderpool. It seeks to reconcile with Profound Heaven, which was typical of the Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling Dao."

Li Qinghong listened attentively and replied thoughtfully, "Your esteemed family has a long heritage. Do you know why this Dao developed in such a way?"

"Ah!" Xi Zikang’s tone carried a hint of bitterness as he replied, "It’s not exactly a secret. Everyone from south to north knows the world has five virtues, and that there are Profound, Celestial and Origin thunders. Yet for generations, we thunder cultivators have never understood why there are five for water and fire, but only three for thunder?

"Even if that’s the way of heaven and earth, Profound and Celestial governs thunder, and Origin Thunder is also called Prime Magnetism. Logically, there should be a fourth thunder governing magnetism to complement the dualities of nature..."

Seeing Li Qinghong nod thoughtfully, Xi Zikang continued with a sigh, "So many predecessors have tried to prove it, suspecting that a Dao Fruit was lost at the beginning of creation. The Profound Thunderpool is one such attempt..."

"I see." Li Qinghong gradually understood, So it’s no coincidence that the two Profound Thunder items, Duruo and the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens, suit me so well. My Immortal Foundation itself is the result of many rounds of refinement...

She went over it once more in her head, then asked, "If this Dao truly exists, then there must be corresponding spirit items and demonic creatures birthed with the same Immortal Foundation. How could they not appear?"

Xi Zikang was momentarily speechless. Clearly, he did not have a solid grasp of such secrets and could only say, "I’ve only heard some rumors. In ancient times, Immortal Lords were everywhere. Those with supreme cultivation could transcend Fruition Attainment, borrowing from and hiding things within heaven and earth, thereby altering the world. Maybe one thunder was hidden away by an Immortal Lord long ago."

His tone was hesitant, clearly uncertain of the truth.

Li Qinghong nodded, and Xi Zikang added, "My family has an abundance of thunder-related items. If you have any needs, Qinghong, I can try requesting something from home."

Li Qinghong paused. At the moment, she couldn’t think of any spirit items her family lacked, so she said, "It’s better to exchange technique for technique. Your family has a deep foundation, do you have any Bright Yang Dao techniques?"

Xi Zikang was slightly surprised. After a moment of thought, he replied, "My family doesn’t have one, but we are under the Northern Sea’s Beihuan Sect. I can request a Foundation Establishment Realm technique from the upper sect. If I send a formal letter, there should be options to choose from."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing, who had been listening silently at the side, finally nodded. Li Qinghong’s eyes lit up as she thought to herself, So technique control in the Northern Sea is this relaxed? They can even request techniques from the Immortal Sect and resell them?!

She had also heard of the Beihuan Sect’s reputation and said gently, "Very well! In that case, since our family has some additional items, I hope we can exchange for a few more volumes."

"Well..." Xi Zikang hesitated and said softly, "These things aren’t really presentable... the techniques won’t be top-tier either... please don’t expect too much, Qinghong..."

When he saw that Li Qinghong and her nephew seemed confused, he shook his head awkwardly. It was clearly a private matter, so Li Qinghong refrained from pressing further. Xi Zikang then smiled and said, "Then let’s consider that matter settled! There’s one more thing, I’d like to ask if I may take a look at the dharma artifact in your possession."

Xi Zikang seemed aware that his request was excessive, and a deep look of apology showed on his face. Li Qinghong, however, didn’t seem angry. She immediately understood what he meant and asked, "The Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens?"

"Exactly!" Xi Zikang quickly said, "That item... holds great importance to my family. When it was first recovered from the ruins of Thundercloud Temple beneath the sea, one of my ancestors dueled the Azure Pond Sect’s Master Buzi. Both were in Foundation Establishment Realm then... he lost by a narrow margin and still regrets it to this day... I hope you might allow me to examine it briefly!"

Li Qinghong couldn’t quite gauge his true intent. Her priority was to obtain that cultivation technique first; all else could wait. So she replied softly, "You’re a newcomer here, and I must admit I still feel some caution. Let’s postpone this for now. Once our families have exchanged techniques and understand each other better, we can revisit the matter."

Xi Zikang could only sigh softly and nod in agreement. After a few more casual remarks, he prepared to take his leave.

Li Qinghong nodded at Li Ximing, signaling him to leave first. Only then did Xi Zikang rise and casually say, "It’s a bit of a coincidence. I, too, cultivate the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling. My Immortal Foundation is called Heaven’s Crying Spur. This trip, I’m heading south to Lake Xian, then turning east toward the Eastern Sea."

Li Qinghong sighed inwardly and asked, "What business takes you there?"

Xi Zikang shook his head with a smile and said, "You and I both cultivate with borrowed Dao lineages. Surely, you’ve had your own doubts, so why ask me? The dragon kin devour thunder, and such a prolonged Falling Water Rising Storm must mean unfinished business. My sect informed me long ago, so I traveled south voluntarily to spare the Dragon Monarch the trouble of dragging me down and harming my kin..."

Li Qinghong escorted him out all the way to the island’s edge. She saw thunder bloom beneath Xi Zikang’s feet as he turned and said softly, "It’s not all bad. There’s no need for them to kill us all. There may be benefits to come. When the time comes, I’ll seek you out, Qinghong. If we go together, at least we’ll have each other’s company."

Li Qinghong fell silent for a moment, watching him depart. Then she rode thunder back to the peak, where she happened to run into Li Ximing. He said softly, "Aunt... he seems to have an ulterior motive."

Li Qinghong had sensed the same. This man had shown no real urgency for the technique, and his request about the artifact seemed more like a pretext. It was perhaps just a way to build rapport. The information he later revealed likely mattered far more.

As for his final remarks before leaving, those were probably the real reason he had come. Li Qinghong understood this well and didn’t explain further. She only replied softly, "Don’t worry. Are you doing better?"

"You need not worry, Aunt." Li Ximing’s tone was gentle. He had shaved the beard he used to keep, and his body brimmed with Radiant Light. Li Qinghong had rarely heard such a tone from him, so she was slightly surprised. The young man cupped his hands and said softly, "Aunt, I’m going into seclusion for cultivation."

Li Qinghong responded with a quiet "Mm," and watched him ascend toward Mount Wu, where the spiritual energy was most abundant along the shoreline. The hall fell silent. The woman sat alone for a moment, then rose and returned to her dwelling.

————

On Pingya Island.

Morning light leaped over the distant mountains, spilling golden rays across the lake. Pingya Island was relatively flat, with connected isles, drifting white mist, and rows of pavilions and towers laid out in graceful order. It radiated the atmosphere of an immortal domain.

The grand hall at the island’s peak gleamed in the morning light. Li Chenghuai walked up the stairs one by one and entered. The carved flying beasts at the eaves had faintly red eyes and four bared teeth. It was a sign of vigorous fire veins. He calculated with his fingers and thought, Summer is near, today is an auspicious day. The Celestial Whirl generation is to receive teachings and breath arts... a well-chosen date.

With both Li Ximing and Li Qinghong in seclusion, time flowed like water. This was the Li Family’s first formal instruction ceremony since unifying Moongaze Lake. Li Chenghuai, master of Qingdu Peak, one of the two peaks among the sixteen prefectures, had arrived early, as expected.

Inside the main hall, someone had already arrived and stood with hands clasped behind his back, studying a map intently. He wore a deep red robe with golden embroidery and had discarded the heavy overrobe for summer. He looked clean-cut and decisive.
𝕗𝚛𝚎𝚎𝐰𝗲𝗯𝗻𝚘𝚟𝚎𝗹.𝕔𝐨𝕞

The design had been settled by the two brothers. Li Chenghuai naturally recognized this as the garb of the family head. Dark red with gold, it symbolized the family’s axis. His own robe was outer blue with inner white, the mark of Qingdu’s chief, representing the family's formal leadership.

The Li Family governed sixteen prefectures, two peaks, and one mountain. All peak chiefs of the sixteen prefectures wore red robes. The two peaks had distinct colors where, Qingdu, which represented the clan chief, was outer blue and inner white. Jade Court, which represented the enforcers, was pale with gray. It was visually clear at a glance.

As for the great mountain of Milin, it was too vast to be entrusted lightly. It remained vacant to this day, and the designated purple robes had yet to be used.

Li Chenghuai ascended several steps and saluted Li Chengliao, speaking softly, "Family Head, the Celestial Whirl generation and the younger members of the prominent families from the sixteen prefectures have all arrived outside the hall."

Most of the Li Family’s Celestial Whirl generation had now stepped onto the Dao of cultivation. The eldest, Li Zhoufang of the first lineage, was twenty-six and had reached the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Li Chengliao had met most of them and said plainly, "Let them enter."

Most of the Radiant Lure generation had attained cultivation, but many had died in battle in the north, leaving few heirs. As a result, the Celestial Whirl generation was not only small in number but there were even fewer among them with the innate ability to qualify for the main hall. When Li Chengliao looked over them, he saw fewer than ten.

"In all great families, it’s common to see sparse descendants and mutual adoption... It’s true. Once one attains cultivation, having children becomes harder, especially after Qi Cultivation Realm or Foundation Establishment Realm..."

It wasn’t entirely a bad thing. Li Chengliao had long observed that ties across three to five generations within the family often grew distant. But with adoptions, relations that had drifted apart were drawn close once more. The four branches had become notably more united.

He pondered quietly, Some great families endure for centuries. Adoption must be a crucial strategy for them...

He put his thoughts away as those below bowed. The one in the lead looked no older than sixteen and was also at the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Li Chenghuai nodded slightly, a smile forming on his face.

This youth was the only descendant of the seasonal branch: his eldest son, Li Zhouluo.

Li Zhouluo had gray eyes and long brows, with the poise of a young man. Dressed in black pleated robes, he spoke with confidence. Though Li Chenghuai himself was plain in looks, his wife, Madam Ding, was beautiful, and their son had inherited the best of both parents, appearing elegant and refined.

Li Chenghuai had never been fond of long seclusions, so Li Zhouluo had grown up to be well-mannered and courteous by his side. Watching from the side, his father felt a warm satisfaction.

If Father saw him, he’d surely be pleased, thought Li Chenghuai.

Last time his father, Li Xizhi, returned home, he hadn’t said a word to him. Li Chenghuai had long since grown used to it. Now in his thirties, he no longer minded and often forgot about him. Yet thinking of him now, he felt a faint daze, Father...

By his count, he had only seen his father a handful of times since childhood. The man rode mists and rainbows and was a prominent figure in the sect. But when Li Chenghuai thought of his father, it was mostly confusion.

I owe him nothing, and he owes me nothing. That’s all there is to it.

Standing atop the steps, gazing down at those in the grand hall, Li Chenghuai knew exactly where everything he had come from, and he also knew he hadn’t lost much. He never harbored resentment, but on rare occasions like this, when they came to mind, he quietly thought, I often forget them. They probably don’t often remember me either and that’s just how it is.
