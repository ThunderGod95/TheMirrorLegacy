# Chapter 1157: The Secret of the Sword Gate

Cheng Jiuwen, dressed in a simple Daoist robe, welcomed him at the entrance. His gaze lingered for a moment on the fading radiance of Bright Yang light that was slowly dissipating across the sky. He sighed inwardly. 'What a troubled time.'

---

Since the founding of the Great Song, the Sword Gate had always enjoyed a life of ease. Sword Intent itself held a unique status, transcending all other arts of cultivation. With deep foundations built upon years of accumulated strength and a long-held principle of worldly detachment, the Sword Gate's legacy was unmatched. In fact, among the entire Supreme Yang Daoist tradition of the Song kingdom, all the other sects combined could not compare to the Sword Gate alone.

But Cheng Jiuwen knew that this carefree existence was likely at its end.

Li Zhouwei paused on the mountain path, his eyes fixed on the great pine standing sentinel at the peak. He offered a slight bow.

"Greetings, Senior Heaven's Horn."

As the words left his lips, a gentle viridian light showered down from the pine's branches, and a warm, ancient voice echoed from the summit.

"Your Majesty is too kind. We are all family here."

Li Zhouwei's expression grew serious.

In his spiritual sense, the entire pine tree seemed to surge with life. A vast tide of divine power converged, its five 'Horn Wood' divine abilities already perfected. Ethereal threads of power reached out, communicating with the Great Void and soaring into the heavens.

'Just as I thought… this spirit cultivator perfected his divine abilities long ago. How long has it been? A hundred years? Three hundred? Five hundred?'

Li Zhouwei mused.

'Five arts brought to their absolute peak, and in the noble 'Horn Wood' path no less—the very symbol of growth within the Wood Virtue. A single one of his divine abilities could bring the dead back to life. If he could leave this sword peak, even though Horn Wood isn't suited for combat, he could still rout the entire host of northern cultivators single-handedly!'

When Li Ximing broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, he had come here. Li Mei had told him then that the senior had not spoken in fifty years. But time flowed like water; more than fifty years had passed since Li Ximing's own breakthrough, meaning this ancient being had been silent for a full century.

'Then again...' he thought, 'with Li Mei emerging from seclusion, the Sword Gate is not only at its strongest in a century, but he must also face that immortal cultivator from Donghua Heaven. He can't remain in seclusion any longer.'

He simply offered another bow.

"Senior is too kind."

The great pine swayed, its needles rustling as they shed cascades of pure light. The light gathered before Li Zhouwei, illuminating his face. He felt a warm spring breeze wash over him, and the faint Heavenly Glow on his features vanished. The wound on his face, deep enough to reveal bone, healed in an instant, leaving not a single scar.

"Many thanks, Senior!"

Li Zhouwei said, bowing his head. His voice was firm and resonant, but his mind was reeling.

'Such incredible divine power!'

Li Zhouwei's physical body was unique, far from that of an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator who could be easily mended. To heal his wounds, one needed a profound understanding of the Bright Yang Dao; anything less would be useless.

'Has this senior truly weathered so many ages that his attainments in the Bright Yang Dao are this high?' he wondered. 'Or is it that once the 'Horn Wood' divine ability is perfected, the art itself approaches the Dao, granting it the power to complete all other arts?'

---

Cheng Jiuwen had stood by respectfully the entire time, his head bowed. Seeing that Heaven's Horn offered no further reply, he finally gestured to a seat and quietly poured tea for King Wei.

"It's a rare honor to meet with you, Your Majesty," he said with a slight smile.

The young man in the dark robes stood tall and composed. Even with a great battle looming on the coast, not a trace of anxiety showed on his face.

"I must thank Senior Li Mei for granting me refuge all those years ago," he said.

Cheng Jiuwen shook his head.

"Your Majesty is too kind. Cheng Yan fell by your hand, which settles that karmic debt. As for the matter of sanctuary… whether my Martial Uncle had acted or not, I am certain you would have found a way to overcome the danger."

While the Daoist Master of the Sword Gate observed him, Li Zhouwei was taking his measure as well. The man had a long face and thick, severe eyebrows; there was nothing particularly remarkable about his appearance.

Among Purple Mansion cultivators, Cheng Jiuwen did not have a sterling reputation. For one, he was a loner who kept his distance from the other cultivators of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. For another, the moral schism within the Sword Gate was, in essence, a conflict over the future path of the entire lineagw. Nearly every cultivator sided with Li Mei, and they all knew that Cheng Jiuwen was the one backing the conservative elders, which did little to endear him to them.

Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"Facts are facts. The debt of gratitude remains."

Cheng Jiuwen fell silent for a moment. He understood that King Wei was waiting—waiting for his Martial Uncle, perhaps, or for the Grand General. They were at the heart of the storm, and the Sword Gate could not hope to escape it. Finally, he raised an eyebrow and offered a wry smile.

"Regarding the events in Ting Province, I should be the one congratulating you."

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"And I should see the Sword Tome."

Cheng Jiuwen sighed and bowed his head slightly in apology.

"I'm afraid Your Majesty will have to accompany me to Chenghua Hall for that. I have never managed to cultivate Sword Intent, and… I cannot even lift the Myriad Radiance Sword Tome!"

Li Zhouwei could see it clearly: this Daoist Master already possessed two divine abilities. His spirit was full, his qi overflowing, his aura deep and restrained. He was surely just a single step away from mastering his third.

'And yet, even he cannot lift it.'

Doubt bloomed in Li Zhouwei's mind. He rose and followed Cheng Jiuwen up a flight of green stone steps, soon arriving at the place all of Jiangnan's sword cultivators dreamed of: Chenghua Hall.

The hall was not as grand as he had imagined. Aside from the verdant green roof tiles, the entire structure was made of weathered wood, faded to uneven shades of grey. A few simple, round stools sat near the threshold. Stepping inside, he saw that the walls were covered in faded, colorful murals depicting scenes of slaying demons, vanquishing evil, and saving the common people. Rendered primarily in hues of cyan, black, and red, they exuded an air of ancient simplicity.

Cheng Jiuwen seemed lost in thought.

"Of the six lineages of Chongming—if we can still call it six—the Yue Cultivating Sect is the most widespread and, arguably, the most accomplished, having even produced a True Monarch. Yet the Sword Gate has never shone so brightly. Our own founder once lamented that among all the Chongming cultivators, he had the poorest grasp of the divine mysteries."

Li Zhouwei knew he was referring to Cheng Liuxing, the Myriad Radiance Sword Immortal and a disciple of that True Monarch.

Cheng Jiuwen lowered his eyes.

"It's no one's fault. Finding someone with supreme talent in the Way of the Sword who also possesses the aptitude for Dao cultivation is exceedingly rare."

He led Li Zhouwei deeper into the hall, where a tome bound in deep blue leather lay open on a pedestal. Its pages were a pale, creamy yellow, and the elegant characters on them were clear and bright.

"This is the sword intent of Daoist Master Xu Gui of Xuanzhou, from the Shu State." Cheng Jiuwen explained.

"He visited not long ago."

Li Zhouwei's gaze fell upon the characters. Above, in small, dark grey script, were two words:

【Repentance's End】

Below them, in a similar script:

【Awakened Pool】

And beside them, a dense block of tiny, fly-headed script read:

【The Sword of True Nature, Born from Great Repentance's First Awakening】.

Li Zhouwei had heard that a new Sword Immortal had appeared in Shu, known only as Daoist Master Xu; now he knew the man's full title. He nodded silently as Cheng Jiuwen picked up a jade rod as thin as a chopstick, infused it with his divine ability, and carefully used it to nudge the page.

He turned several pages before new words finally lit up on the tome:

【Falling Cassia】

【Azure Homeland】

Li Zhouwei shifted his gaze to the line of text beneath them:

【Azure Moon's Homecoming: The Sword of Ten Thousand Assembled Scales】!

He committed the name to memory, his golden eyes glinting.

"I have a question for you, senior," he said softly. "When exactly did the name of this Sword Intent appear in the tome?"

Li Zhouwei had come not only for himself but to lay the groundwork for Li Jiangchun's Sword Intent. Cheng Jiuwen looked surprised for a moment, but quickly recovered.

"When the young disciple from your clan arrived at the capital, he had an audience with the Emperor and performed a sword dance in the palace. The name appeared in the tome at that very moment."

A subtle wave of relief passed through Li Zhouwei.

"So it wasn't when he was on the lake?" he pressed.

Cheng Jiuwen lowered his eyes.

"Our predecessors learned from experience that the Sword Tome is blind to anything that occurs within a mystic realm or a grotto-heaven. Otherwise, it must be obscured by some great dharma power or divine ability. Although this book was written by a True Monarch, it is not a Dharma Treasure. And even if it were, there are places in this world beyond the reach of any Dharma Treasure…"

'If that's the case, then concealing it will be easy,' Li Zhouwei thought, his heart settling.

'As long as the Sword Intent is manifested on the lake—or better yet, within a grotto-heaven of my own making—the Sword Tome will never know…'

He smiled and nodded, but his eyes were fixed on the jade rod in Cheng Jiuwen's hand.

"My grand-uncle once told me this Sword Tome is a peculiar thing," he said in a low voice. "A mortal with Sword Intent can lift it with ease, but a Purple Mansion cultivator without it can barely move it. He said that back then, it was Senior Li Mei who retrieved it for him."

Though his words were simple, their implication was clear. When Li Ximing had visited the Sword Gate, Daoist Master Li Mei had personally fetched the tome and flipped through its pages without the slightest hint of difficulty. At the time, Li Ximing had simply assumed Li Mei's divine abilities were so powerful that he could ignore the tome's weight. But now, seeing Cheng Jiuwen—a master on the verge of his third divine ability—needing a Spiritual Artifact just to slowly turn one page at a time, how could he not be suspicious?

King Wei narrowed his eyes, a long-held doubt resurfacing.

'When the Sword Immortal King visited the lake, he mentioned four Sword Immortals in Jiangnan: True Monarch Shangyuan from that era, the old Sword Immortal of the Great Xiukui Monastery, and the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal of Qize… There should have been one more.'

---

Cheng Jiuwen heard the suspicion in his voice. After a long silence, he finally answered, his voice trembling.

"I will not hide the truth from you, Your Majesty. This matter… is the greatest tragedy of my Sword Gate."

The Daoist Master's voice was barely a whisper.

"My Martial Uncle… his name isn't Li Mei. He was born Cheng Xunzhi. He is a child of my Cheng clan—from the direct line."

"In the Way of the Sword, his talent was peerless. He grasped sword qi at the age of ten. My own martial grand-master doted on him, and the treasure he wielded was the heirloom, 'White Pear.' He comprehended the 'Controlling Bitterness' Sword Intent—'The Sword of Pure Yang Qi, Establishing Yang and Controlling Bitterness'—while still in the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

"As for his cultivation, he attained the Dao through the notoriously difficult 'Sovereign of Dui Edge' path. He mastered 'Unending Edge' and 'Palace of Retracted Killing' in less than a century. Before he was even three hundred years old, he was already on the verge of comprehending the Purple Mystery."

Cheng Jiuwen's voice was filled with a mixture of pride and sorrow.

"To be blunt, he was the greatest genius the Sword Gate has seen in centuries. His talent for both swordsmanship and cultivation surpassed even some of the Founder's own disciples. In the last thousand years, you could count on one hand the number of people who could have stood as his equal."

A shadow crossed his face.

"The Dui Metal path, while orthodox, suffers from interference when it mixes with Geng Metal. Of the remaining two divine abilities on that path, both are Life Divine Abilities. One is sealed by the Golden Oneness and forbidden to junior cultivators. But the final one… our Sword Gate possessed it."

His voice cracked.

"It was I who burdened him with sect affairs. It was Senior Heaven's Horn who met his questions with silence. He should have broken through to the Purple Mystery realm long ago… We were the ones who hid the sect's fourth divine ability from him!"

"He cannot be allowed to cultivate a Life Divine Ability!"

An icy chill crept into Li Zhouwei's expression.

"Why?" he asked, his voice low.

A look of anguish twisted Cheng Jiuwen's features.

"Years ago, a Daoist Master of our sect passed away. Though our Martial Grand-master had surpassed the Purple Mystery, he was nursing old injuries. My Martial Uncle was the pillar of our sect; we should have protected him. But we had a tradition… that disciples must descend the mountain to temper their character. He was sent to guard an island out at sea…"

"At the time, the Way of Great Desire and the Chunyi Dao Gate were fighting over a mystic realm. Tian Langzhi—the Maha of the Way of Great Desire—came south himself to confront Senior Yuanshang. But during the chaos, a stray beam of Buddhist light was diverted and struck the island."

Li Zhouwei frowned. He listened as Cheng Jiuwen, his eyes now red, walked slowly out of the hall.

"My Martial Uncle had attained Sword Intent at a young age," Cheng Jiuwen said, his voice thick with rage, "but only my master and grand-master knew of it. I don't know how that Maha from the Way of Great Desire divined it, but he hadn't come just to threaten the Chunyi Dao Gate. He came to destroy my uncle."

"That Buddhist light… it drives men mad. When Senior Yuanshang arrived, he found an island of our disciples, all slain by a single sword to the throat, and my Martial Uncle, raving like a demon. And Tian Langzhi—that shameless bastard—was preparing to forcibly convert my uncle and take him to the north!"

"Daoist Master Yuanshang fought with everything he had. When Tian Langzhi saw he could not capture my uncle, his intentions turned murderous. Daoist Master Yuanshang had to use several priceless spiritual treasures just to save him… but by the time he brought him back to the mountain, it was too late. His body was ravaged, yes, but far worse… his wife and child had been on that island. They died by his hand. Though his life was saved, his Dao heart was shattered."

By now, Cheng Jiuwen was standing beneath the massive, sky-blotting pine, tears streaming down his face as his lips trembled.

"He swore an oath to kill Tian Langzhi, but from that day on, he could no longer meditate without waking in terror. He couldn't even summon his Sword Intent. Master and Grand-master both knew that the Purple Mansion Realm was lost to him forever. With a Dao heart in that state, attempting a breakthrough would mean certain death."

Li Zhouwei was beginning to understand.

"And so," Cheng Jiuwen continued, his eyes downcast, "Grand-master begged Senior Heaven's Horn for help. He used a spiritual branch from the Profound Horn Treasured Tassel Pine itself to heal his physical wounds. Then, he requested the aid of Daoist Master Shang Miao and her disciple from the Yue Cultivating Sect. Using their sect's most powerful treasure, they erased that entire period from his memory."

He clenched his fists, finally revealing the Sword Gate's most painful secret.

"Changing his name to Li Mei was part of the deception. Erasing memories is not usually enough to bypass the boundless illusions one faces during a breakthrough. So they essentially remade his body, a process akin to reincarnation. He took Senior Heaven's Horn's surname, Li, relying on the profound amnesia of rebirth to bury the trauma deep within him…"

"But what can fool the illusions of a breakthrough cannot fool a Life Divine Ability! The divine ability he needs is called 'Mutual Oblivion,' also known as 'Position Follows Trust.' It aligns with the Mandate of Heaven, allowing one to make the people forget their toil and even death. If it can do that to others, imagine its effect on the self! Once that power becomes part of his very being, the truth will inevitably be unlocked!"

"And the method for that divine ability, the 'Trust in Heaven's Way Art,' is held by Senior Heaven's Horn!"

Li Zhouwei's gaze wavered as he listened to the Daoist Master's sobbing confession.

"That is why… that is why Senior Heaven's Horn has not dared to answer him for fifty years! It is why I have delayed finding a cultivation method for him, why I bury myself in seclusion year after year while he handles all worldly affairs! I was hoping to slow his cultivation, hoping he would never reach this point!"

His voice was choked with despair.

"But he was only delayed before the Purple Mystery for sixty years before breaking through effortlessly. This day was inevitable. My Martial Uncle sensed something was wrong. When he could not obtain a Dui Metal method, he found another path! And I've heard that this Geng Metal path… it, too, leads to a Life Divine Ability!"

The Daoist Master of the Cheng clan let out a ragged sigh.

"Everyone says that my Martial Uncle champions engagement with the world while I champion seclusion. They say I use the elders to oppose him… but how can they understand? Engagement, seclusion… do people like us truly have any say in the matter?! The world outside slanders the Cheng clan, and I'm seen as a stubborn hypocrite, a relic of the past. I, Cheng Jiuwen, do not care about such rumors. But a swordsman seeks only a clear and tranquil sword heart, and a Sword Immortal needs it more than anyone. If he regains his memories… how could he possibly bear it? He would march to the Way of Great Desire and demand a reckoning!"

The normally stoic man's face was ashen, his eyes filled with torment.

"You all see this as a great and joyous occasion for the Sword Gate. But the truth is… the truth is that I, Cheng Jiuwen, have dreaded the coming of this day more than anyone else in the world!"




# Chapter 1150: Present Departs Old

His voice echoed through the mountains, stirring the roiling wood-qi. The Daoist Master of the Cheng clan rose to his feet and said through gritted teeth,

"There's no turning back now. I see it clearly—the grand conflict between north and south requires a blade this sharp. As for where that cultivation art came from, and who provided it... I imagine Your Majesty already has an answer."

He took a step back and bowed low, his forehead touching the ground. He sighed.

"If the opportunity arises... I beg Your Majesty, for the sake of our past friendship... please lend him your aid!"

Li Zhouwei stood with his hands clasped behind him, murmuring,

"Sea of Desire... Maha Liangli... Tian Langzhi."

A heavy gloom settled over his heart as the pieces clicked into place.

He had once suspected that Lingmei, the Sword Immortal, was a kinsman. Though he now knew otherwise, he still remembered the debt of gratitude he owed the man. He also understood just how impossibly difficult it would be for the Sword Immortal to avenge such a blood feud in the current climate.

'The Way of Great Desire... they're at the height of their power. In the eyes of the Underworld, he is a fine sword indeed...'

He raised an eyebrow.

"And what is Tian Langzhi's background?"

Cheng Jiuwen heard him and lifted his head, his eyes slightly reddened. He spoke in a low voice.

"He began as an immortal cultivator, following the Jade True path and receiving the inheritance of the ancient Heavenly Lang Terrace Daoist Tradition. He was also skilled in the Way of the Sword before he defected to the Buddhists... Now... he has lived for at least seven lifetimes. It is highly likely he is already an eighth-reincarnation Maha!"

Li Zhouwei frowned.

An eighth-reincarnation Maha!

Within the Buddhist cultivation system, a ninth-reincarnation Maha could enter the Chandana Forest and take a seat beneath the various Dharma Masters, qualified to inherit their position at any moment. An eighth-reincarnation was already among the highest echelon of Buddhist combatants, suppressible only by a perfected divine ability!

It was impossible to know what state Lingmei would be in after his breakthrough, but trying to slay that monster with a newly formed fourth divine ability would be harder than ascending to the heavens. And that wasn't even considering the Peacock Sect at the height of its power backing him. A swordsman can only advance, never retreat, but with his heart-devil involved, the consequences could be catastrophic...

'No wonder Cheng Jiuwen doesn't dare let him break through...'

While Cheng Jiuwen's heart sank at the thought of Lingmei's certain doom, Li Zhouwei's mind latched onto two extremely sensitive Dao lineages.

'Geng and Dui!'

These two Dao lineages, the most volatile in the world, were not merely two paths of Metal Virtue. They were the exclusive domain of the master of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. Lingmei wasn't just a Sword Immortal; he was a Great Daoist Master with a very sensitive identity!

The heir to the late True Monarch Taiyu!

And True Monarch Taiyu's fall pointed directly to the True Monarch of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition!

A flicker of shock and cold light passed through his eyes. He asked softly, 

"Senior Lingmei... which Geng Metal divine ability does he cultivate?"

Cheng Jiuwen slowly shook his head, but the mountain wind carried three faint words to their ears.

"Present Departs Old."

The mountain wind blew cold, and a sudden silence fell between them. Cheng Jiuwen composed his sorrowful expression. Li Zhouwei turned, his golden eyes gazing down from above. He saw a gloomy wind swirl through the mountains, from which a man dressed in black materialized.

The man's features were plain, but a seal of office hung at his waist. His expression was complicated as he spoke in a strained voice,

"Greetings, Your Majesty."

Yang Ruiyi.

Clearly, the news of Li Zhouwei stopping at the Sword Gate with such fanfare had spread across the north and south almost instantly. How could Yang Ruiyi not know?

His complex gaze shifted slightly to the profound pine tree as he said in a low voice,

"Urgent matters call for flexibility. I did not intend to disturb Senior."

A gentle breeze seemed to rustle the pine's needles, but no words came. Only Cheng Jiuwen's expression was one of pure shock. He wasn't surprised by Yang Ruiyi's appearance; besides Ting Province, the Grand General had long held the authority to access the outer rings of several of the Song Kingdom's Purple Mansion grand arrays. No, it was the name of that divine ability!

'Present Departs Old'!

Cheng Jiuwen was a Dui Metal cultivator himself. Geng and Dui were closely related; how could he not recognize this divine ability? Shock and terror filled his heart, driving all other thoughts from his mind. He scrambled to his feet, murmuring,

"'World's Revolution'!"

His face was a mask of grief and elation. He gritted his teeth and demanded, 

"This... You were the one who taught him?!"

Compared to the complexity he'd shown before Li Zhouwei, Yang Ruiyi's face was a mask of calm. He stared at Cheng Jiuwen, his voice indifferent.

"It was inevitable, and it was Cheng Xunzhi's own choice. He is a dignified cultivator at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm; did you think he would have no inkling? When he wielded his sword and channeled his qi, his prowess was extraordinary, reaching a level that would have astonished even Duoling. Do you truly believe he harbored no suspicions?"

His gaze bore into Cheng Jiuwen.

"You know as well as I do. He studied that page on The Sword of Pure Yang Qi, Establishing Yang and Controlling Bitterness day and night. He pondered it endlessly and knew it by heart, yet he could never discover its owner... How could he not have been suspicious!"

"Therefore, it had to be 'Present Departs Old'."

Cheng Jiuwen stood frozen, his eyes filled with doubt as he stared blankly at Yang Ruiyi. The Grand General took a step forward and said with admiration,

"To cast aside the old and establish the new. Shangqing did the same all those years ago, willingly abandoning his status as a noble of Gu Prefecture for the sake of a new beginning. It suits him perfectly."

Cheng Jiuwen remained rooted to the spot, his gaze downcast. He seemed to have a thousand questions but could not voice a single one. He stood there for a long time, and the cold, elegant peak of Sword Gate Mountain fell silent once more.

Yang Ruiyi shifted his gaze, finally forced to meet that pair of golden eyes.

This King Wei, sitting so calmly on a mountain peak, was obviously not here for a leisurely stroll through the Sword Gate. His actions were a clear declaration, a move that had put the entire Yang clan in an impossible position.

In King Wei's situation, any other Daoist Master from Jiangnan would have no choice but to resent Qi Lanyan for the grand strategy, with no opportunity to question the decision. They wouldn't even sense anything amiss with the trade-offs made behind the scenes. But he was different.

Yang Ruiyi had considered that King Wei might be enraged. He had planned to compensate Ting Province after the great battle. He had even considered that Li Zhouwei might march his troops into the White River, trading one crisis for another... He'd even entertained the one-in-a-million chance that Li Zhouwei might sense something, refuse the order, and come to Shanji Prefecture to negotiate.

But Li Zhouwei had instead established his divine ability at the Sword Gate, a declaration to both north and south.

'He's putting on a show for Qi Lanyan.'

Qi Lanyan's goal was to exploit the painful fact that Ting Province had to be defended, coupled with the Underworld's desire to damage Bright Yang's interests, in order to deal Li Zhouwei a crippling blow.

But Li Zhouwei had tossed Ting Province aside like a piece of trash, ignoring all of the Yang clan's directives, and announced to the entire world that he was at the Sword Gate. With this, Qi Lanyan could only choose between Ting Province and Li Zhouwei!

And he, Yang Ruiyi, was facing the exact same choice!

The moment Li Zhouwei displayed his divine ability at the Sword Gate, Yang Ruiyi had no choice but to have him participate in the battle at Shanji. His tacit understanding with Qi Lanyan had its limits. If Li Zhouwei were to retreat to Ting Province now—a province unprotected by Martial Cultivation—then without him, Qi Lanyan's full-scale assault on Shanji would inevitably end in failure, or worse.

Yang Ruiyi raised his head, staring into those golden eyes. Their coldness was a clear warning.

'He doesn't care what becomes of Ting Province. He wants to be the one who decides where the war between north and south is fought. He wants to determine the future course of the entire conflict. He is forcing Guanhua and the Great Song to fight an unprecedented, no-holds-barred war at Baihai Creek!'

He let out a deep sigh. The subtle premonition he'd had was finally coming true—he just never imagined Li Zhouwei would tear off his docile facade so suddenly, bypassing him to put Qi Lanyan in checkmate. And he never thought it would happen so fast.

The Grand General of Song was weighed down by these thoughts, momentarily at a loss for words.

But as he stood there in silence, King Wei rose to his feet. His frame was not overly tall, but with his broad shoulders and trim waist, he cast a long shadow. In the dimness, only his golden eyes glittered.

"Grand General!"

The two words hung in the air, sharp and final, sending a chill deep into Yang Ruiyi's bones. He forced a smile and took a step forward, but the King of Wei wasn't looking at him. His gaze was fixed on the cup in his hand as he said coolly,

"It seems the only 'greater good' left is the one that requires sacrificing for my sake!"

Yang Ruiyi's heart jolted. Staring into those blazing golden eyes, his ominous premonition finally became reality.

'Qi Lanyan calculated the Underworld's interests perfectly. On the surface, he tossed the decision to my Yang clan, but in reality, he gave me no choice at all. What was that, if not a way to drive a wedge between us?'

Now, Li Zhouwei's display of power had thrown the problem right back at them on his clan's behalf. But could he, Yang Ruiyi, admit the Underworld had tacitly approved? Could he shift the blame to those great figures?

Though the cultivators of Jiangnan were oblivious, the two of them were no fools. As soon as Li Zhouwei understood the truth of the matter and refused to be a sacrificial lamb for the Underworld's interests, the facts would be laid bare. The one who had conspired with Qi Lanyan could only be him, Yang Ruiyi!

He took a deep breath, forcing himself to remain calm. There were no more excuses to be made. He said respectfully,

"I am willing to dispatch cultivators to defend Ting Province."

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes bored into him.

"Since the Grand General is so knowledgeable about the northern cultivators' forces," he said quietly, "I'm sure you can protect Ting Province well."

Yang Ruiyi lowered his head, understanding the unspoken threat. He fell silent.

Li Zhouwei watched him quietly.

He hadn't come to the Sword Gate alone without confidence!

By establishing his Bright Yang here, he was sending Qi Lanyan another message: regardless of whether the Yang clan had schemed against the Li clan before, with Bright Yang standing tall, a confrontation between them was now inevitable.

'Wang Ziya can't cross the river; he can only support Qi Lanyan from Jianghuai. Yang Ruiyi... he knows the northern deployments... but Qi Lanyan does not know the southern layout under the shroud of Exiled Qi.'

Once the Yang and Li clans had their confrontation, an attack on Ting Province became impossible for Qi Lanyan. Under these circumstances, the Great Song would never allow him to destroy the province. However many men he had at the White River, Yang Ruiyi would have just as many to counter them, perhaps even taking command personally. And with Li Zhouwei at Shanji, the undefended Baihai Creek would be free for the taking!

This was the complete opposite of Qi Lanyan's original goal. He would be better off fighting a major battle at Baihai Creek, where he might at least have a chance to target Li Zhouwei in the chaos!

'From this moment on, the only possible outcome is a great battle between Song and Zhao at Baihai Creek!'

Of course, even though Li Zhouwei had Qi Lanyan completely figured out, he couldn't bet everything on his opponent behaving as expected. He shifted his golden gaze and said,

"I will defend Lake Xian."

'This presents a difficult choice for Qi Lanyan, but for me, it's easy to handle. Yang Ruiyi isn't the only one who knows the northern situation. I have the Spirit Probe!'

By defending Lake Xian, Li Zhouwei would hold the geographical advantage, overlooking the entire tactical situation at Xuanmiao Temple from a superior position. Meanwhile, Li Jiangqian would guard the river, providing a view of the deployments at the White River, preventing the possibility of Qi Lanyan flying into a rage and trying to spite him out of sheer frustration.

With this double guarantee, he could even supervise Yang Ruiyi's deployments on the lake!

Yang Ruiyi understood. He knew Li Zhouwei wanted to constantly remind Qi Lanyan that he was on the eastern front. He clasped his hands in agreement.

"As Your Majesty wishes."

As the words fell, King Wei dissolved like smoke into flashes of radiance. Yang Ruiyi watched him go with a complicated expression, his gaze falling upon the shimmering surface of the lake to the north.

A brilliant Celestial Gate, covered in profound patterns, was rising majestically!

The sight made Yang Ruiyi close his eyes, his lips moving silently. He heard a soft thud and saw that Cheng Jiuwen had prostrated himself on the ground. With a complex gaze, he said in a low, earnest voice,

"The Sages of the Underworld write with the strokes of a dragon, bringing peace to the world. We minor cultivators can only obey, willing to be their treasured swords... We only hope... we only hope! That our sharp blades may one day return to their sheaths!"

This Daoist Master of the Sword Gate, usually so cold and stern, had sensed an extreme danger and did not hesitate to bow before him. At that moment, Yang Ruiyi was still immersed in his anxiety over the loss of control. As his eyes fell upon the man, he felt a surprising pang of pity, a sense of shared misfortune.

'Return to their sheaths... How many of us can? Me? Cheng Xunzhi? Li Zhouwei? Even... the Emperor?'

But the imperial descendant of the Yang clan, the direct heir of the Underworld, remained silent. He took a step back and vanished like mist, leaving Cheng Jiuwen to straighten up, still kneeling on the ground, his expression cold and sharp.

…

"Clang!"

A clear, bright chime echoed in the night sky. On the mountaintop, a Daoist quietly held a small bronze bell, his expression serene. In the distance, the Celestial Gate stood upon the lake's surface, its heavenly light reflecting in his pupils.

'A pity it's Lake Xian, and not Moongaze Lake.'

He gazed at the shimmering heavenly light, as if seeing past the hazy white veil to a pair of cold, golden eyes—eyes without a trace of hesitation or pity, casting aside the great lake that birthed and raised him, his fierce, ambitious gaze staring like a wolf or a tiger at the vast lands of Jianghuai.

A touch of wistfulness entered his expression, but he could see no hint of the divine ability's colors from the south. The disciple behind him stood silent for a long moment before asking timidly,

"Master... the reinforcements from the White River..."

Perhaps it was Wang Ziya sighing and shaking his head nearby, or perhaps Qi Lanyan's mindset had changed completely. He did not get angry. Instead, he said very calmly,

"Have them return for now."

Fan Kang, as if granted a great amnesty, hurried away. Wang Ziya stood with his hands behind his back and said softly,

"Such a fast reaction."

Qi Lanyan showed no regret. His gaze was calm as he said,

"He is Li Zhouwei."

Wang Ziya frowned.

"A pity..."

"No pity."

Qi Lanyan stared intently at the riverbank.

"I've said it before. If he's at Baiye Creek, I'll fight him at Baiye Creek. If he's at Baijiang Creek, I'll fight him at Baijiang Creek. Now that he's at Lake Xian, I'll fight him there all the same. It will be nothing more than a battle unseen in five hundred years. At least for now, I still have the upper hand."

"Besides..."

He suddenly smiled, the silk ribbon at his waist floating gently, gathering wisps of immortal light.

"This incident won't be without consequences. At the very least, it leaves a mark on the Underworld's attitude. Once is a precedent, and twice is a pattern. Once trust is broken, it can never be fully restored."

"He might not be ignorant of the Underworld's ill intentions," Wang Ziya said.

Hearing his Martial Uncle's words, Qi Lanyan replied,

"The key isn't that he understands. It's that the Underworld knows he understands. The Underworld was united in their stance on Li Qianyuan, but their attitude toward him is ambiguous. But for those great figures, suspicion is as good as guilt. The entire point is to make them suspicious."

Wang Ziya drew a sharp breath. He watched as Qi Lanyan straightened up, his eyes burning bright, fixed firmly on the myriad rays of heavenly light that shot into the sky from the lake's surface.

"As for now... we shall see who comes out on top."




# Chapter 1151: Dui Resides in Imperfection

In the distance, the lake’s surface shimmered, a wash of brilliant color. The divine ability, the Celestial Gate, had already stood for fifty-eight days. Its white bricks were immaculate, gleaming with a crystalline light, and its two white pillars plunged into the lake, while at its center, a bright light pulsed, shimmering and indistinct.

It was like a monument to eternal merit and imperial glory, a gate that had stood immutable since time began.

“I heard from those below that the waters of Lake Xian have dropped by another inch. The fish and Flood Dragons have gone into hiding, and all demonic things have fled.”

Gusts of cool wind swept across the summit of Profound Peak Gate. For the seventh time, the old man emerged from the hall to look. His slightly clouded eyes were wide, gazing tremulously at the spectacle on the lake. He turned back and asked, “A battle is inevitable, isn’t it?”

Nearby, Kong Xiaxiang, the Master of Profound Peak Gate, stood motionless. His face, once marked by frivolity and then despair, had settled into a hard-won maturity. Yet as he faced the profound and mysterious Celestial Gate, it still betrayed a tangible dread.

“Yes… they all say it is. Troops from the Li Clan’s Jade Court Guard have already been mobilized. They’re stationed at the foot of the mountain.”

The old man and the younger one fell silent.

Kong Guxi, a lost expression on his face, rose from his seat, completely at a loss. He looked closely at Kong Xiaxiang, saw the terror in his eyes, and then turned away. After hesitating several times, he spoke, his voice trembling.

“We have yet to repay their great kindness… how can we bear to draw our blades against them?”

Silence descended upon the mountain. Kong Xiaxiang did not know how to answer him. Then a gentle breeze swept past, and a woman in yellow-colored robes appeared. With a thud, Kong Guxi fell to his knees.

“My lady… Daoist Master!” he cried. “How can I possibly face the old Daoist Master in the great beyond!”

As he wept, his full head of silver hair trembled.

How could Kong Guxi not know what Profound Peak Gate had relied upon to survive until this day? But he knew with even greater clarity that without Daoist Master Zhaojing, Profound Peak Gate would have been crushed like an ant long ago.

For the longest time, the Kong Clan had rationalized the south’s designs on their Shanji lands, while Profound Peak Gate numbed itself with the need for self-preservation. But as the situation shifted time and again, culminating in the Celestial Gate rising from Lake Xian, their sole benefactor was about to become their sworn enemy. Kong Guxi’s heavily burdened heart finally shattered.

The old man knelt on the peak, weeping helplessly into his hands. Kong Tingyun looked down at him, her eyes clouded and her lips sealed.

Her breakthrough had pieced the fractured Profound Peak Gate back together and saved their Dao Lineage. Yet the sect remained like a sickly old man clinging to life; its new generation had yet to mature. More fatal still was the escalating conflict between north and south, which was slowly hoisting this frail old man up to the gallows.

She was an intelligent woman and had long since smelled the scent of danger. She could feel the thin cord around her neck pulling ever tighter, as if ready to snap her life away at any moment.

But the northern cultivators behind her—Guanhua, and even Qi Lanyan—did not care. The monk all those years ago had made it sound so simple: the key to breaking the deadlock lay in one's cultivation. If she, Kong Tingyun, truly possessed such talent, she should have broken through sooner, and Profound Peak Gate should never have suffered such a calamity!

Faced with the old man’s grief, Kong Tingyun could only offer silence. He wiped his tears and straightened up, as if afraid of troubling her further.

“I have considered this for so long but never dared to speak, for fear of disturbing the Daoist Master’s judgment. Not even ten thousand deaths could atone for it… Pay this old fool no mind.”

Kong Xiaxiang helped him to his feet and they retreated hastily. Just then, a bright light flared in the sky. From the Great Void, a divine ability parted the skies, and a procession of Daoist Masters descended upon galloping clouds.

The leader’s expression was calm. He wore a Daoist robe of white silk edged in gold, embroidered with profound patterns of black clouds. It was, of course, Qi Lanyan. But what truly captured her attention was the Daoist beside him, a man with a sharp gaze who was stroking his white beard.

Wang Ziya of the Numinous Treasure Order!

Her gaze lifted to meet his. As he descended from the clouds, Wang Ziya was also watching her. He listened as Qi Lanyan spoke quietly.

“This is Kong Tingyun, a descendant of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition.”

Hearing the word “descendant,” Wang Ziya’s heart stirred. “A descendant of our tradition, then,” he asked. “Under whom did she study?”

Kong Tingyun’s eyes flickered.

“My grandmaster was Luo Yuan, an in-name disciple of Great Daoist Master Lü Bai.”

“So, a successor from Lü Bai’s line!”

Wang Ziya clasped his hands politely.

“I am Wang Ziya of the Numinous Treasure Order. My grandmaster was Wu Ni, third on our Dao-path, and I studied under the True Monarch of Nurturing Life and Prosperous Treasures, Xu Xiang.”

A bitter taste filled Kong Tingyun’s mouth.

“Greetings, my lord,” she said in a low voice.

After so many years under the banner of the northern cultivators, how could she not have investigated the origins of her own Dao Lineage?

Her ancestor, Daoist Master Luo Yuan, had been merely an in-name disciple of Lü Bai. He lacked talent but possessed exceptional sword arts, which was how he had built his reputation. Daoist Master Changxi had placed their lineage under Luo Yuan’s name precisely because this ancient cultivator had roamed the world as a champion of justice before falling in battle, and had imparted his teachings so widely they were impossible to trace.

By contrast, the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao to which Qi Lanyan and Wei Xuanyin belonged, despite having been reduced to a mortal lineage, could be traced back to True Monarch Guanhua, a direct disciple of the Master of Comprehending Profoundity himself.

The Numinous Treasure successor before her was no less impressive. Who had not heard of the renowned True Monarch Xu Xiang?

Though Guanhua and Comprehending Profoundity now acknowledged Profound Peak Gate’s status, Kong Tingyun understood just how low that status was. Wang Ziya appeared unconcerned, but the moment she spoke Luo Yuan’s name, he had already dismissed her as someone who had barely managed to cling to a connection.

As a thousand thoughts raced through her mind, Wang Ziya was secretly filled with pity.

‘Martial Nephew Qi is cruel indeed. Introducing her as “a descendant of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition,” not “a direct successor.” A single word, yet the difference is as vast as heaven and earth! The descendant families of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition are spread across the north, but how many are ever acknowledged as true successors?’

While Qi Lanyan might bluff with others, he was extremely careful with his words around Wang Ziya. The Daoist stroked his beard, his expression complex, and said only,

“You’ve endured much, standing guard over this place.”

At his words, Qi Lanyan’s expression shifted slightly. Kong Tingyun offered a polite reply, but Wang Ziya waved his hand, his gaze turning south.

“It’s about time,” Qi Lanyan said softly. “Murong Yan!”

As his voice fell, a stout man appeared. His heart seethed with hatred and disgust, but he maintained a polite facade, offering a smile that did not reach his eyes.

“What instructions does Lord Qi have for me?”

Qi Lanyan beckoned him forward, then turned back and asked softly, “And where might Liangli Maha Zhelu be?”

The Great Void stirred, and a monk in a kasaya materialized. His eyes held a strange, malevolent light as he smiled.

“Does Lord Qi have some use for this humble monk?”

Qi Lanyan’s expression grew cold.

“The Celestial Gate on the lake is plain to see, but we must guard against his trickery. Should he use some deception, we might find ourselves striking at empty air. One of you is Maha Liangli, the other cultivates Valley Water. Enter the lake at once and test him.”

Zhelu’s eyes darted, his expression inscrutable. Qi Lanyan laughed.

“Your Void Dao’s treasure is still in his hands. If you don’t give it your all, you won’t get it back!”

Zhelu had been waiting for those very words. Hearing Qi Lanyan confirm the news, he was overjoyed. The handsome monk smiled and nodded. Qi Lanyan then turned to Murong Yan, a half-sincere smile on his face.

“Fellow Daoist Murong, in the battle today, I will honor you with the title of Guardian of the White Sea, to command our cultivators. Success will bring great merit. Failure will mean the loss of the entire White Sea…”

Murong Yan’s face changed. He was about to refuse when he looked up and saw the youth’s sinister gaze sweep over him. Qi Lanyan’s expression was calm as his lips buzzed, his words wrapped in a divine ability:

‘I have tolerated you for eighteen years, as has the Murong clan. How many more chances do you think you have? If the White Sea is lost, we will need a scapegoat, and I’ll make you the sacrificial offering!’

Shock and fury warred on Murong Yan’s face, but under Qi Lanyan’s icy stare, he remained silent.

‘You stubbornly refuse to take refuge in the Buddhist path. But when the time comes, I’ll have the Murong clan take your head back to bear the karma for losing Jianghuai. We’ll see then if they are willing to honor you as a golden statue to your “great compassion” that prevented you from slaying your enemies… and enthrone it in the Buddhist Lands!’

…

Boom!

A fierce wind howled and rain lashed down in sheets. Gloomy thunder cracked within the clouds, and a vivid silver-white light coalesced above the sword peak.

The peak had once been a place for cultivating Dui Metal. Its concentrated Metal Qi drew Profound Thunder, and even with the protection of Horn Wood, bolts of lightning still lingered, weaving through the air.

For fifty-eight days, Cheng Jiuwen had been kneeling quietly beneath the tree. The air was cold and clear despite the sudden, violent downpour, yet not a single drop disturbed the table before him. The tea in his cup was as placid as a mirror, reflecting his eyes.

His heart was filled with worry.

‘After all… it is the path of supplementing Dui with Geng!’

The Dao Lineage of the Sword Gate was the Taiyu Nurturing Essence Scripture, a grand Dao that was originally complete with all five metals. However, the final part, the Golden Aperture Heart, had long ago lost its qi, leaving it empty.

The lineage was, for all intents and purposes, complete. Yet the number of Sword Gate cultivators who reached the rank of Great Daoist Master was pitifully small. Apart from the patriarch Cheng Liuxing and his disciple, only one other in later generations, a certain Yanying, had reached that realm—but he was not of Dui Metal, nor was he a Sword Immortal. The Sword Gate had few divine abilities to begin with, and even less experience concerning the Purple Mystery.

Combining different types of divine abilities was the greatest taboo. Though Geng and Dui were often complementary, a moment of carelessness could easily affect one’s temperament and Dao-path. And that was to say nothing of the fact that Lingmei also had to contend with the Delusion of the Womb.

From the Underworld’s attitude, he knew his elder was destined for success, but those ghosts from the netherworld cared nothing for the consequences.

As if sensing his anxiety, the profound pine tree swayed, and a mellow voice resonated from within the thunder.

“The union of Geng and Dui, especially with the art of Present Departs Old, is no great cause for concern. Dui Metal thrives on imperfection; to seek completeness is to court failure. Since ancient times, those who became Great Daoist Masters using five paths of Dui Metal can be counted on one hand. Such a path deviates from the true nature of Dui Metal. It is not a good thing, nor can it lead to the Great Dao. Four parts Dui to one part Geng—that is the true path.”

“If he succeeds in cultivating this path, his Dui Metal will only become more powerful.”

The words flowed like water, allowing the Daoist Master to breathe a little easier. But then, the profound voice echoed once more.

“The True Monarch said: ‘Dui resides in the flawed and the broken. In a weapon, it is the edge. In people, the forgetting of one another. In the earth, defiance of the earth. In autumn, the failure to be autumn. In objects, the will to transform. In the self, the heart that kills… When form scatters, it becomes Ku, the vault. When it projects, it perishes and becomes Geng. When it receives, it conceals and becomes Kui, the Void. When it attains, it fills and becomes Qian, the Heavens.’”

His voice was like the tolling of a great temple bell, shaking the world. The autumn dew fell in sheets, landing as pearls that rolled with a tinkling sound. Like liquid mercury, it seeped into the ground, transmuting malefic qi into precious ore.

Cheng Jiuwen had been blind to what was right before him. Now, it was as if a divine revelation had washed over him, and he suddenly understood.

‘This lord is not just a great cultivator of the Horn Wood Dao with perfected divine abilities! He has listened to the True Monarch’s lectures and studied the Dao at his feet, making him akin to a direct disciple. His mastery of the Dui Metal Dao could be no less profound than his mastery of Horn Wood!’

As if in confirmation, the thunder in the heavens ceased. A desolate autumn wind rolled in, and the very atmosphere began to shift, a silent blessing for the one cultivating within the cave-manse.

“Qian is sublime and boundless, a fullness that matches the heavens. This is ‘harmony’ (Qi). In ancient times, Qian Metal was known as Harmonising Metal. Cultivators use the term ‘Metal’ to signify perfection in their practice, yet the true nature of Metal Virtue does not lean toward completeness. If one must force an association, Harmonising Metal is the more fitting term.”

The spirit pine had cultivated on this mountain for countless ages. Its tone was calm and gentle. First, it had created a phenomenon to aid Lingmei; now, it offered guidance to Cheng Jiuwen. The Daoist Master immediately grew calm, his eyes filled with gratitude.

“Many thanks for your guidance, my lord!”

But the changes were not over. The wondrous, profound sound became the final catalyst for completion. The roiling autumn dew intensified under the night sky, showing no signs of stopping.

All the winds of the world surged into the mountain, turning a pallid white. They drifted past like the waters of a great marsh, causing his robes to flutter. Faintly, he heard a shattering sound from within the stone door, and trickles of sand and dust poured from its fissures.

Creak.

The stone door opened.

Steady footsteps followed. A white-robed figure was slowly revealed, stepping out into the dense, rippling qi of Dui Metal, one step at a time.

Cheng Jiuwen heard not a single word as he slowly raised his head.

The man’s face was utterly serene, a stillness as profound and unnerving as an ancient well. His cheeks were gaunt, though his cheekbones were not prominent. Beneath two eyebrows as sharp as swords was a pair of luminous white, sword-like pupils.

Between his brows rested a single, soybean-sized mark of the purest black, devoid of edge or sharpness.

Under spiritual sense, the four Metal Virtue divine abilities behind this Great Daoist Master blazed like midday suns in the mortal realm, so bright and scorching they seared the eyes. This was the Sword Gate’s first Dui Metal Great Daoist Master in three hundred years: Cheng Xunzhi!

Dui Metal was a prominent Dao in this era, the path of slaughter and destruction, the very essence of Metal Virtue… and Cheng Xunzhi was also a Sword Immortal.

Even if his fourth divine ability was Geng Metal, and even if that divine ability was not yet perfected, for the Sword Gate, a figure of his caliber was second only to their founding patriarch, Cheng Liuxing.

‘Martial Uncle… he succeeded.’

Cheng Jiuwen felt not joy, but a sense of dread. He knelt lower, his eyes red as he choked out the words:

“Congratulations, Martial Uncle!”

The cry seemed to pull the Dui Metal Sword Immortal back to reality. As if waking from a long dream, he looked around, took a step, and appeared beneath the profound pine.

At some point, a golden-hued sword had been placed squarely on the table.

The blade was three chi and eight cun long, simple and unadorned. Its hilt was of pear wood, and the blade itself was snow-white, etched with faint, crack-like patterns of pale gold that resembled pear blossoms.

White Pear.

The sword trembled, emitting a low, weeping hum. As the Dui Metal Sword Immortal quietly lifted it, a piercing, high-pitched sword cry filled the heavens. Streaks of Sword Intent shot like light through the world and purified the cosmos.

“Martial Uncle!”

The sword cry faded. Cheng Jiuwen took a step forward, but the only sound on the mountain was the faint whisper of wind through the trees. After a long moment, a sharp, cold voice, like the grinding of metal, finally spoke,

“Senior, for fifty years you have not answered. I had assumed it was a malady of the Golden Oneness, the great bulwark between Geng and Dui.”

His words, hard as iron and stone, drifted into the dense canopy of pine needles, striking the emerald, white, and gold-tinged branches until they rustled. Cheng Xunzhi stood there for a long time, but he received no reply.

There was only silence.

Cheng Jiuwen knelt for a long while. When he finally looked up, the Dui Metal Sword Immortal was gone. The dense azure light that had enveloped the treetops had also vanished like smoke. Only the layers upon layers of pine needles still stubbornly swayed in the silent night.




# Chapter 1152: Upon the Lake

Light and shadow danced upon the water. Sima Yuanli arrived on the wind, drawing ever closer to the shimmering surface of the lake, clutching a gourd in one hand while untying a scroll from his waist with the other. A heavy sorrow filled his heart.

Sima Yuanli knew exactly why Yang Ruiyi had sent him.

'The Purple Smoke sect is a major power, dear to the True Martial lineage. With a Great Daoist Master hidden away, attempting a breakthrough, the lives of people like Tinglan and Wenqing are far too precious to risk.'

The situation was a landslide, an avalanche thundering toward an irreversible conclusion. In a bloody battle of this magnitude, cultivators like them—practitioners of Martial Cultivation or the Profound Arts, and even people like Lingu Lanying and Cheng Qian—were not meant for the front lines.

Beyond delivering the Huai River Map, he, Sima Yuanli, had at least one other inheritance to offer. Daoist Master Yuanxiu had been the grandmaster of talisman arts in the Yue State. To this day, he had barely used any of his talismans—a fact the Yang family had not failed to notice.

'How difficult…'

Bitterness filled his heart as he hurried onward. The Celestial Gate was now close. Beneath it, a man in ink-black robes sat cross-legged amidst the brilliant heavenly light. His long halberd stood planted in the churning water, utterly motionless.

Sima Yuanli came to a stop before him and lowered his gaze.

"King Wei!"

A severe glint on the water's surface wavered for a moment. The man in green robes produced a jet-black stone box from his sleeve. With his gaze lowered, he said:,

"I encountered a fellow Daoist, Lin, on my way here. He implored me to deliver this to you, King Wei."

Li Zhouwei inclined his head. Sima Yuanli opened the stone box, revealing a circular plate within. He held it up. Its surface was a sheet of gold, etched with runes in the eight cardinal directions encircling a dense ring of pale white incantations. At its very center, a brilliant golden light pulsed.

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!

This was one of the foundational artifacts of the Ning State, an heirloom of the Su Clan of Jiangbei. Though it was forged in a more recent era, its miraculous power was undeniable.

Years ago, Li Ximing had merely borrowed this compass and, with only the body of a divine ability practitioner, had injured Helian Wujiang, a master at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm. Now, in the presence of the White Qilin, the compass blazed with heat. It suddenly felt as heavy as a mountain, causing Sima Yuanli's hands to dip.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flickered. A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed the item was ownerless.

"After this battle, I will go and thank him personally."

Even an ownerless Spiritual Artifact normally required time to refine, but he merely took it with one hand and the compass instantly accepted him as its master. It sank into the space between his brows, transforming into a faint, golden sigil of the Sun-Surging Governing Stars that flowed with a dim, white light.

He narrowed his eyes slightly, a smile touching his lips as he felt the myriad wonders flood his mind.

'An excellent treasure!'

Sima Yuanli did not stop there. He immediately produced a porcelain bottle from his sleeve. Holding it in his palm, he hesitated for a long moment before speaking softly.

"Daoist Master Zhaojing was extremely concerned about you standing guard here, King Wei. He spent the last two days seeking treasures from various houses and finally came to me."

"When the Donghuo fell back then, it was handled by Senior Ning and Daoist Master Zhang. But the Emperor's body descended upon Yufu Prefecture, and my lord had a fortuitous encounter, obtaining a Treasure Pill of the Second Manifestation's Vast Yang. Today, I offer it to you, King Wei."

Li Zhouwei glanced down, his eyes already assessing the contents of the bottle.

"White Dew Blood?"

"The very same!"

Though Li Zhouwei was no alchemist, he could discern the spiritual materials used. Li Ximing had long ago prepared the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill and other medicines for him, but they were still a step below a treasure pill refined from such a potent spiritual substance.

"When I have the chance, I will repay Daoist Master Qinghu."

With Li Zhouwei's acceptance, Sima Yuanli finally took a step back. He presented the Huai River Map with both hands and declared in a solemn voice:

"King Wei, please take this map!"

At his words, the golden-eyed young man turned to look at him and smiled.

"Daoist Master, this is your only protective treasure. Giving it to me is one thing, but this battle is unlike any other. Are you prepared?"

Sima Yuanli answered respectfully, "The Emperor personally summoned me to the palace and bestowed upon me the Profound Water Stone of the Far Ridges!"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"And what are the Grand General's arrangements?"

Sima Yuanli replied, "The Grand General did not inform me. However, I heard he is personally attacking Shanji, and that Situ Huo and the others are already by the lake to provide support… As for that one…"

He trailed off, raising his head to look at the mountain peak towering in the east. He focused on a point where thunder rolled and autumn dew fell in sheets.

"It should be done."

The instant his words fell, myriad streaks of rose-colored light erupted into the sky, like a million dawns breaking at once. They pierced the clouds, and as the auspicious mists shifted, they revealed what lay beneath: ten million eyes!

The rosy light reflected in Li Zhouwei's eyes. A cold sneer formed on his lips as he abruptly took the scroll.

The instant the Spiritual Treasure left Sima Yuanli's hands, he felt a sudden emptiness and was stunned to find his connection to it had been completely severed!

A jolt went through him.

'He had already made allowances for me!'

"BOOM!"

The clouds in the sky converged with incredible speed as an immense golden body descended, its arrival heralded by a great tremor of Sanskrit chants.

"We exchanged blows too hastily a few months ago, and it was hardly satisfying. King Wei, please grant me your guidance!"

"DONG!"

Zhelu's thousand eyes moved as one. Darkness crawled up the sky, where a colossal setting sun hung at the edge of the world. A long halberd, like a golden comet, streaked across the heavens, trailing a long wake of white light as it descended to kill!

Zhelu's words were fearless, but at the sight of the halberd, his expression turned grave. He formed a seal with his hands, his thousand eyes wide, as the enormous golden mountain manifested once more.

But a sound rose from all the waters between heaven and earth. A sheet of azure light swept in, wrapping heavily around the golden mountain. Sima Yuanli's green gourd shone with a profound light as he went all-out, his expression grim!

Li Zhouwei, however, merely narrowed his eyes.

A ripple of gray was already spreading across his halberd. The familiar power of Valley Water gathered and swirled, blending all colors into a dim, heavy light.

'Sunless Deceit!'

Murong Yan!

The Zhelu in the sky was a preeminent figure among the northern Maha. In an ordinary fight, he alone could have contended with Li Zhouwei. That this was merely a probe, yet they still added Murong Yan to the assault, showed just how vicious Qi Lanyan's intentions were.

This divine ability of Valley Water warped the surrounding world, surging forth from within the dim domain of the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead.' The River-Wall Staff leaped from the Great Void, falling abruptly. The face on Murong Yan's grotesque skin-bag was twisted with savagery!

"CLANG!"

The two weapons collided. Valley Water clashed with Bright Yang, and the sheer force of the impact sent the River-Wall Staff flying high. Murong Yan's expression shifted.

This was not his first battle with Li Zhouwei… in fact, the very first clash in the war between North and South had been between them. But back then, he had held the advantage of strength. Things were different now!

Feeling the strain in his hands, he steeled himself and opened his mouth wide, just as he had done all those years ago. A pitch-black shadow, coiling like a serpent, pulsed within his maw as his mouth swelled grotesquely, rolling with demonic light.

But the golden eyes that watched him no longer held their former gravity. They were filled with cold mockery.

A sign of a solar eclipse flared to life between Li Zhouwei's brows. The profound, bottomless darkness did not obscure the sigil there; instead, it overlaid the white pattern of the Sun-Surging Governing Stars, causing it to erupt with an intense, new color.

The first to react was the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!

This compass had been forged during the fall of Wei and the rise of Ning. It followed the old Wei traditions while heralding the new era of Ning. Its power was rooted in the Sun-Surging Governing Stars, making it perfectly attuned to the fluctuations between positive and negative Bright Yang. Its primary aspect was 'Sun-Surging'—an incredibly profound art for enhancing the power of the Yang Cusp!

When Li Ximing had borrowed it, he could only activate one or two of its abilities, unable to enjoy the true blessings it conferred upon its master. But in Li Zhouwei's hands, the compass was like a tiger that had grown wings.

Emperor Qi's Light!

The distant setting sun suddenly began to rise again. An impossibly dense stream of black-gold light erupted from it at an unprecedented speed, coalescing into a torrential pillar of light that pierced the heavens as it descended!

Murong Yan had never anticipated such a turn of events. His pupils dilated as the black-gold radiance poured into his technique, causing his skin-bag to inflate at a visible rate.

The sun shone high overhead, and Murong Yan was paralyzed. But the King Wei of today was not the same Li Zhouwei who had once faced him with the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light technique. The lingering sun itself now commanded the Emperor Qi's Light, and his halberd, already a blur of motion, stabbed forward!

"CLANG!"

The Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions, rushing to the rescue, was frozen in place by a brilliant light. The golden halberd danced like a dragon, smashing through layer after layer of gray Valley Water before slamming into Murong Yan's body!

Streaks of black-gold patterns appeared on his swollen, ball-like torso. His Valley Water art, cultivated for nearly a century, was instantly overwhelmed. In just a few breaths, it detonated!

It was as if another sun had risen in the dark, sand-swept world. Murong Yan's first layer of skin shattered. The powerful new arms that had grown forth were bathed in heavenly light, and rivulets of gray blood streamed down his skin.

A direct scion of the Murong family, a cultivator at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, renowned for his 'Valley Water' technique's defensive and evasive properties, had his art shattered and was wounded in a single exchange!

He staggered back, but Li Zhouwei did not pursue. Instead, he spun his halberd back, hooking a golden spear that had shot out of the Great Void!

Sima Yuanli was nowhere near strong enough to block Zhelu; even his hasty defense was strained. The thousand-eyed Maha had already descended from the sky, pressing down on him.

The golden spear, struck by the halberd, flew high into the air. Zhelu had already conjured a vast rose-colored light to bear down on him. But the light washed over Li Zhouwei's face as if it were nothing. The glittering halberd blade tore through the radiance, its power magnified, and stabbed onward!

'As expected…'

Qi Lanyan had used this Liangli Maha's greed for treasures to drive him forward, but the cunning old master had not lost his head. On the contrary, he was on high alert.

'Is Qi Lanyan really so kindhearted? He sent Murong Yan and me here because he values our talent for escaping… What trump card is the South holding? Could this be fatal?'

His Buddhist arts specialized in void illusions, and his thousand eyes were designed for such techniques. Against Li Zhouwei, he was at an absolute disadvantage.

A single charge of 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' was enough to shatter his arts; its disruptive power was among the best of all divine abilities and had already nullified nearly half his Dao-Profundity. And now it was clear that the White Qilin's innate resistance to illusion arts was also terrifyingly high!

He had no choice but to clasp his hands together, locking the halberd in place. He endured the sharp pain and the sound of splintering bone that came from his palms as he broke his opponent's momentum. His golden lips moved.

"By my decree!"

A stream of golden powder flowed forth, suffused with the light of Dawn Qi. It whistled through the air and sprinkled across Li Zhouwei's face. The White Qilin's expression finally shifted, a flicker of pain crossing his features.

Zhelu's heart soared!

'His dharma body has its limits! My illusions are useless, but the Dawn Qi I spent so long preparing will be effective!'

But just as joy surged through him, he felt the light above dim. A brown pouch etched with profound patterns appeared in midair.

The pouch pulsed gently, and a powerful wind blew out. The wind was as gentle as a spring sunbeam, yet it drove away all traces of haze, instantly dispersing the Dawn Qi that lingered in the air. Zhelu's expression changed instantly.

"The Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch!"

"The Great Xiukui Monastery!"

The wind was like an illusion. Before it could dissipate, a cascade of brilliant light fell from the sky. It was a golden-white so dazzling and dense it seemed to solidify.

Supreme Yang Radiance!

The beam of light cut across the world, forcing the water on the lake to part like a gleaming golden sword. It fell at an impossible speed, slamming into Zhelu.

"Tssss…"

The light was like a virulent poison, searing through his blinking dharma eyes, burning through golden skin and jade-like flesh. Zhelu shrieked and scrambled back, his very soul on the verge of scattering!

It was the first time the Maha Liangli of the Way of Emptiness had ever lost his composure so completely!

The fame of this Supreme Yang light seemed to shake the very heavens, sending tremors through the Great Void. Layer upon layer of illusory colors intertwined as countless greedy eyes fell upon the brown, patterned pouch.

'The Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch…'

At the same time, Murong Yan looked up. A bell with profound patterns was swaying gently. A man in robes embroidered with shamanistic runes stepped out of the void. Black mist rose from his hands and lunged toward Murong Yan.

The newly ascended Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery, Lin Chensheng!

His appearance was a signal of profound importance. The Great Void fluctuated violently. Baleful winds surged up from the earth, and mountains of Baleful Qi rose and fell like waves, as if a grim ink wash painting had been unfurled over the landscape.

To the left stood a refined, middle-aged man holding a spell-sword, his gaze clear. To the right was a youth in heavy armor, his expression fierce, a shuo saber in one hand. A faint scar on his face stood out starkly under the heavenly light.

The two stood in the sky like twin, inexhaustible fonts of Baleful Qi, causing the very air to freeze and snow to begin falling.

The uncle and nephew, Helian Wujiang and Helian Wumeng!

As the sky-blotting Baleful Qi poured down, Helian Wujiang remained expressionless, his hand slowly tightening on his sword. He looked into the distance, where a man now stood among the mountains of Baleful Qi.

The man was eight-chi tall and wore golden boots, a gold-and-crimson saber slung across his back, his gaze sinister. He stood upon clouds as white as cotton, yet they moved with the nimble grace of serpents. His eyes were like a demon's, glowing with red light.

Helian Wujiang touched his throat. The scar, thin as a bloodline, had healed, but a chill remained lodged deep in his heart.

'Situ Huo…'

And in the clouds farther still, purple light and frigid qi were racing toward them, seemingly mingled with a faint golden aura. The Great Void to the north trembled without cease. An Imperial scion stood with halberd drawn while a Maha manifested its true form.

The light of divine abilities and the glow of Buddhist Lands wove together, merging into a patch of absolute darkness in the sky. The small lake had likely never borne the weight of so many Daoist Masters and Mahas. Pulled by their immense power, the earth veins and fire veins below began to shift, growing abnormally active as they pushed toward the surface.

A chill filled the heart of the ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom. His years on the northern frontier had given him vast experience. His gaze was now heavy, the refined air around him long gone, replaced by pure killing intent.

'I fear no one on Lake Xian will hold back today. Killing and surviving will depend on skill alone… and for every great power that falls, how many lesser families will rise on their remains?'




# Chapter 1161: Resonance

A torrent of Baleful Qi cascaded from the heavens. Amidst the gloom, the long halberd stood like a solitary, brilliant sun, impervious. Rose-hued light and plumes of baleful fire surged past it, unable to draw even an inch closer.

Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes swept across the sky like lightning. Through rising veils of Profound Qi and shifting curtains of Valley Water light, he identified one face after another.

Before Helian Wujiang, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and the early-stage Helian Wumeng stood Situ Huo, wielding a crimson-gold blade. Both Helian cultivators were wreathed in Baleful Qi. Not far from them, the two Purple Qi cultivators, Tinglan and Wenqing, darted forward to shield Murong Yan, painting the sky in shades of black and purple.

Sima Yuanli, perched atop a green gourd, used the Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch to force back the Maha Zhelu. As waves of Valley Water rolled forth, Ning Wan had already ensnared Nuzi of the Way of Great Desire. Lin Chensheng’s expression was grim, his gaze fixed on the clasped hands of Mingxiang as if facing a mortal foe.

Below, on the surface of the lake, one Holder of the Profound after another revealed themselves. The three scions of Bright Yang led the charge with fire, while newly advanced Holders of the Profound like Chen Wenyao and Sima Xunhui followed behind with their treasured artifacts. Sheets of fire and water rained down, riddling the compassionate Buddhist radiance with gaping holes.

‘I can’t tell what’s happening on the lake, but Shanji… Shilou Yingge should be holding the line!’

He watched in silence as Touba Ci landed beside Zhelu. He stared at Li Zhouwei from afar, his gaze complex. The arcane platform in his hand shone with a dazzling light—it was unmistakably the Spiritual Treasure suffused with Dawn Qi.

The waters of Lake Xian were already in turmoil. Suppressed by the weight of countless divine abilities, the lake’s surface receded in terror, exposing vast, shattered tracts of the lakebed. The shore crumbled at an alarming rate while the mouth of the river connecting it to the sea widened. The lake was on the verge of collapsing into the ocean!

The divine abilities crackling through the heavens hung in a tense, eerie stalemate.

‘If this battle breaks out, Lake Xian will be shattered, the very earth will sink, and the sea will pour inland. Sword Gate, Shanji, and Xuanmiao Temple will become nothing but broken islands!’

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze, waiting.

Then, in a flash, the water that had been crushed to the lakebed, even forced back into the subterranean veins, suddenly broke free. It surged upward with a deafening roar. Every inch of soil began to glow with a profound light, as if forged from pure steel.

The divine abilities illuminating the sky flared as one, and their wielders attacked in unison!

“BOOM!”

The first to scream was the Great Void itself.

Every divine ability pulsed with power, each claiming its own distinct territory in the sky. The Great Void fractured under the strain, splintering into a canvas of voids large and small.

A ray of golden light shot forth.

“Dong!”

The Supreme Yang radiance surrounding Zhelu had not yet fully dissipated when he felt something golden shatter before him. It was as if a dyer’s workshop had been overturned; a kaleidoscope of phantasmal colors exploded in his vision, leaving his eyes aching and sore. He was secretly horrified.

‘The Pure Yang Bracelets!’

Pitch-black darkness consumed the sky as King Wei leaped into the air. His golden halberd, like a sliver of solid gold clutched in his hand, descended with majestic force. The Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions was too far to intervene, but a figure in feathered robes appeared, fingers flashing through hand seals to summon the immense Profound Seal of Great Liang!

Li Zhouwei’s long halberd vibrated, a dense power gathering within its length, yet it emitted no light. Instead, the air lit up with the magnificent rivers and mountains of the Huai River Map!

The Touba clan’s treasured seal was renowned throughout the lands. Now, having gathered its power for so long, it was not something a single divine ability could withstand. But as the Spiritual Treasure came to life, it transformed into a radiant golden pass weaving through layers of crags and peaks. It intercepted the descending seal and bathed Li Zhouwei in a brilliant radiance.

The divine ability, Radiant Surge!

As a Spiritual Treasure, the Huai River Map possessed limitless power, and its first layer was the Radiant Surge!

This ability could only be activated by a Bright Yang cultivator. It resonated with the three Bright Yang divine abilities within Li Zhouwei, reinforcing his life-mandate and amplifying his dharma power. In fact, it conjured three Celestial Gates behind him!

The Celestial Gates, each a Radiant Pass, overlapped one another, their centers a hazy blur. They projected their light downward, straight toward Zhelu. The Maha, still reeling from the Pure Yang Bracelets, had no control over his body and no time to react. He took the full force of the blast.

He felt as though a great hammer had struck his face, leaving him paralyzed. The darkness blanketing the sky vanished in an instant. Li Zhouwei’s gaze was placid as his long halberd swept forward, arriving before Zhelu in a heartbeat.

Touba Ci’s expression shifted. He took a step forward, his eyes blazing with the color of Profound Yellow Qi as he unleashed his divine ability.

“Calamity of the Shrouded Sky!”

Li Zhouwei felt a chain of golden rings slam down before his eyes. A devastating power flooded his mind, only to be neutralized by a cool sensation as Profound Qi surged from his limbs.

His Sovereign's Perilous Tread, active during a charge, should have possessed the power to dispel such effects. But the divine ability of Profound Qi was endlessly variable. As Touba Ci’s fingers flew through a new seal, it unexpectedly resonated with the divine ability Substituted Hindrance, causing the power of Dawn Qi to manifest both inside and outside Li Zhouwei’s Dharma Body.

But Li Zhouwei was unmoved.

“Illuminating Sun and Moon!”

His absolute control over his Dharma Body, a product of his life-mandate being anchored in a single spiritual mansion, caused the erupting Dawn Qi to stagnate. The golden patterns of his Sovereign's Perilous Tread, however, flared brightly in response to being besieged. The tip of his halberd was already at Zhelu’s throat, while his other hand drew a golden axe.

Zhelu was truly a Maha of long-standing fame. The Pure Yang Bracelets had been charged for some time, and he could not break free in that brief moment. But thousands of his rose-colored eyes reacted in unison, flashing before him to form a white lotus as bright as a star.

Each of his thousand eyes possessed its own spiritual essence, entirely independent of his soul!

“BOOM!”

The long halberd slammed against the lotus, exploding in a shower of cyan and white light. The Maha, lost in the dazzling colors, was violently jolted back to awareness.

Zhelu had long since mastered various life-saving Dharma Arts, and this was one of his greatest trump cards. This wondrous lotus, formed from his eyes, had been crafted using a spiritual object of Manifestations Earth. The moment it shattered, it would, in turn, awaken him.

He didn't hesitate. A burst of pink light erupted as he shot several dozen zhang away, his face etched with lingering fear. He immediately reached out with his life-mandate, attempting to connect to the Buddhist Land.

Even with the Buddhist Land of the Way of Emptiness in decline, as a Maha, Zhelu could still borrow immense dharma power and divine abilities from it.

But his spiritual sense was met with emptiness. Darkness stretched out in every direction. He could only vaguely discern a nether palace of Exiled Qi, locked away in some unseen, abyssal place.

‘Exiled Qi!’

His expression changed drastically. His hands flew into a seal, preparing to summon a golden mountain.

But that short delay was all it took. The sky was already dark. King Wei’s gaze was glacial as he charged, halberd and golden axe in hand, his Campaign Cloak billowing behind him. He held two fingers before him, and a bright flame the size of a bean leaped into existence.

The Dawn Qi fire within his Dharma Body was unleashed, erupting with maximum force. He coughed up a spray of golden blood that fell directly onto the flame.

Southern Emperor's Profound Snare.

Instantly, Li-Light materialized, like rays of golden sun precipitating from clouds, and descended upon Zhelu’s Dharma Body.

Zhelu had faced this Dharma Art before and had a sense of what was coming. He never expected that what fell was not a net of golden light, but a surging wave of Li-Light that resembled a living flame.

The Li-Light was fire, yet not fire. It was more like a flickering ember, but its color was terrifying. It bored viciously toward his forehead.

Zhelu scented mortal danger. The color in the depths of his eyes shifted, his face a mask of terror. The thousands of eyes on his body swiveled in unison, casting a hazy purple light to try and hold the attack in place.

But this Bright Yang Li-Light was like a skiff in a tempest; no matter how the waves crashed, it could not be overturned. The purple light he had cultivated for years was utterly useless, allowing the attack to descend like a coiling dragon.

‘Ah?!’

The horror on his face instantly seeped into his very soul.

‘This is… Sovereign's Perilous Tread?!’

But his thoughts were swiftly extinguished. Pinpricks of Li-Light landed first on his golden forehead, then shot downward with terrifying speed and burrowed deep into his Dharma Body.

“BOOM!”

A colossal storm of Li Fire, wreathed in the Heavenly Light of Bright Yang, erupted across the sky. The terrifying blast caused nearly every cultivator to turn their heads, their hearts seized with shock.

‘How many exchanges has it even been?!’

When Li Zhouwei had first chosen this art, he had prized its affinity for life-mandate resonance. It could trap and kill, and its resource requirements were remarkably low. Furthermore, his own life-mandate was unique, and the two were mutually reinforcing.

In Li Zhouwei’s hands, the art bloomed with an entirely different splendor.

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, absorbed into his glabella, amplified his power. The Huai River Map strengthened his life-mandate. And most importantly, under the pressure of the siege, he had already resonated with the fate of the White Qilin!

If Li Jiangqian’s Talisman Qi art, Greedy Snare of Profound Li, was the result of greatly amplifying life-mandate resonance, then Li Zhouwei, by channeling the fate of the White Qilin, had boosted the power of his art from its very foundation. He had crossed the profound threshold and truly mastered the art, achieving its second stage: the murderous Li-Light!

This was precisely why he had chosen to charge while activating the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare! The Li-Light was an extension of his own life-mandate. With his advanced Dao-Profundity, forcing out his own essence blood forged an even deeper connection. And since he was already charging forward, the power of his Sovereign's Perilous Tread was layered directly onto the technique.

This was how he had caught Zhelu off guard.

As the wisp of Li-Light detonated, the Maha’s head was vaporized into dust. His empty neck was a ruin of shredded flesh from which flickered strings of brilliant Li Fire. Horrifying trails of Li Fire streamed down his golden body, searing molten, golden-red wounds into its surface.

The thousand eyes that had always been open now squeezed shut, weeping tears of light.

Li Zhouwei had only resonated with forty percent of the White Qilin’s fate, but the Li-Light strike had been completely unexpected, and for the first time, Zhelu’s very foundation was shaken.

Though the tremendous drain of the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare left Li Zhouwei’s face pale, the King of Wei was far from done. He rode the momentum of his Sovereign's Perilous Tread forward. The divine ability of his Crimson Severing Arrowhead moved with a profound weight, yet he was as nimble as one riding an immortal chariot, effortlessly dodging the descending Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform.

He drew his thick, dark-gold halberd. The qilin patterns on its surface seemed to leap to life as his killing intent flared.

It all happened in the blink of an eye. Only now did the phantasmal light of Bright Yang finally register in Touba Ci’s pupils. The heart of this descendant of Great Liang grew heavy. For the first time, he felt utterly powerless.

The Bright Yang path favored the exalted and disdained the lowly. This hadn’t been obvious when Li Zhouwei possessed only one or two divine abilities, nor was it so terrifying when he had just broken through to three. But now, wielding an array of Spiritual Treasures and Spiritual Artifacts, Touba Ci finally understood the oppressive suppression wielded by a high-ranking Bright Yang cultivator. For the first time, he felt a profound sense of defeat at the hands of a fellow mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

‘Give a Bright Yang cultivator the slightest advantage, and the situation becomes an avalanche!’

Touba Ci was lost in a daze for a moment.

‘The Bright Yang favors the Qilin. How can a mere mortal ever hope to compare?’

Seeing King Wei’s bright halberd, Zhelu’s headless body began to tremble violently. But the searing Li-Light still coursed through him, paralyzing his thousand eyes.

The Southern Emperor's Profound Snare was not just an art of slaughter, but also one of subjugation!

At this critical juncture, a length of purple silk shot through the air. It coiled around Zhelu’s waist and, with a sharp tug, pulled the Maha away.

Li Zhouwei’s reaction seemed even faster. The instant he saw the purple silk, the emblem on his glabella flared.

The Sun-Surging sigil grew incredibly complex. Its outer ring darkened, its inner profound patterns spun, and four points of golden light separated from it, forming an inverted constellation with the Upper Shining Star below and the Yang Extremity Star above.

The Apex of the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!

Just as the four glittering golden stars rose, a slender, silver baton struck the surface of a drum.

“Dong!”

Brilliant silver light exploded, streaking across the sky and shattering the four nascent stars. In the very next instant, it struck the spot where Li Zhouwei had just been, unleashing a thunderous storm that swept out in all directions.

The Profound Thunder was savage, imbued with the majestic might of the heavens. The faces of the assembled experts changed. The uncle and nephew duo of Helian Wujiang, who commanded the baleful winds, were especially horrified and scrambled to retreat. On the edge of the battlefield, Sima Yuanli was locked in a fierce contest of strength with Bashan; neither could dodge in time. They were sent flying, both coughing up blood.

The power of a single drumbeat was immense!

With his Spirit Probe active, Li Zhouwei reacted with incredible speed, avoiding the epicenter of the blast. He was knocked from the air, wreathed in silver light, and spat out a mouthful of crackling lightning.

As expected, a shimmering golden light emerged and bound him in place.

A youth appeared beside him, cold and aloof. He wore a tall crown and a robe of black clouds embroidered with profound patterns, his lips crimson and his features sharp.

Qi Lanyan!

The youth’s movements were swift and agile. He held a sword in one hand. It was about four chi long, plain and unadorned, with a simple, ancient design. It was a sword technique, and a red ribbon tied to its pommel fluttered in the electric air. An obscure incantation condensed around it.

“By the august position of Zhengxing Palace, I call upon water and fire, and channel them through Dui Metal.”

Droplets of water and fire dripped from the sword. A wave of Dui Metal energy surged forth, at its center a point of pure light as unyielding as metal. It shot toward Li Zhouwei’s glabella.

Before the light even arrived, a piercing sense of danger washed over him. Li Zhouwei’s pupils became pure gold as his gaze met Qi Lanyan’s.

Both were perfectly calm.

‘There is nothing left but to fight!’

His black robes suddenly blazed with light. Elegant yet imposing armor materialized over it, every golden pattern flaring at once.

“Primal Molt!”

A brilliant Yang Extremity light flared. The moment it pulsed across his armor, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing sigil on his glabella lit up in unison. Mutually amplified, they shattered the golden light binding him, and he vanished.

Qi Lanyan, however, was unperturbed. With a slight tremor of his other hand, the profound drum sounded again.

This peal was not as loud as the last, but it condensed into a bolt of tangible lightning that streaked after him. Li Zhouwei had just reappeared a short distance away when the lightning was upon him, seeking to bind him once more.

‘What a formidable Spiritual Treasure!’

Li Zhouwei seized the brief moment of respite. His eyes lit up, and a torrent of black flame erupted. The Celestial Gate appeared from thin air, descending from the heavens to meet the lightning and smash down upon Qi Lanyan!

“BOOM!”

The silver-white lightning detonated. Qi Lanyan’s footwork was a blur of profound, unpredictable steps—he was clearly prepared. With a flick of his sleeve, he produced a piece of white porcelain. Dawn Qi gushed from it, shining toward the Celestial Gate.

He coldly brandished his sword. As he raised it into the air and prepared to chant, an autumn wind brushed his face, and for a moment, it seemed as if crystalline motes were drifting past his eyes.

Qi Lanyan’s expression changed slightly.

“Drip.”

A single drop of autumn dew materialized from nothing, landing on the spine of his blade and sending out a ripple of cold.

The successor of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao felt a jolt in his heart. He silently gripped the jade talisman hidden in his sleeve and slowly raised his head. He found the world blanketed in black clouds. Not far off in the darkness, there was a glimmer of autumnal white.

It was the light of a sword.

And behind that light was a pair of bright white, sword-like pupils—a pair of long, sharp eyes, frigid and sharp enough to pierce him through.




# Chapter 1162: The Sword of Pear Blossoms

'Lingmei.'

'A Great Daoist Master of the Sword Gate, a Sword Immortal of Dui Metal.'

Of the Three Profoundities, Azure Profoundity was renowned for its Sword Intent. After years of strife between north and south, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition of Azure Profoundity had come to occupy Jiangnan, and in that time, sword immortals had become a common sight. From Hengzhu in the far south to the Yue Cultivating Sect in the far north, masters of the sword had emerged one after another.

The sword immortals who walked out of these Dao Lineages were formidable, their divine abilities and dharma power second to none. The one who had ascended to the realm of Jade True was beyond mention, but even the less talented sword immortal from the Great Xiukui Monastery had required a personal disciple of a True Monarch to suppress him.

The Sword Gate, however, was an anomaly. Though it boasted more sword immortals than any other sect in Jiangnan, it had precious few cultivators even at the Purple Mansion Realm.

Perhaps their reverence for the Dao had allowed this unique tradition to produce more sword immortals. But in turn, their unwavering adherence to Sword Intent placed even stricter moral demands on them. Everyone chased after Sword Intent, and the geniuses who emerged would foolishly seek it before pursuing divine abilities, wasting their prime years. This only exacerbated the decline in the number of powerful cultivators. Ever since Cheng Liuxing and his disciples had fallen, the light of the Sword Gate had dimmed drastically. Even the sudden appearance of a Great Daoist Master named Xing Ying years ago could not reverse their decline.

And a Dui Metal Sword Immortal at the level of a Great Daoist Master was rarer still.

No matter how prepared he was, the terrifying might that surged forth the instant that streak of autumn yellow appeared sent a chill down Qi Lanyan’s spine, and understanding dawned.

'This Dui Metal Sword Immortal’s power rivals anyone in Jiangnan or Jianghuai. He’s closing in on Lou Xing!'

That sword-like gaze flashed over him for only a moment, but Qi Lanyan felt a frigid wind tear at him. A blinding white light filled his vision. He barely had time to raise his sword, a single thought consuming his mind.

'So fast.'

It was often said that Upright Wood was as unyielding as metal. This technique-sword, which channeled the nature of Upright Wood, borrowed from both water and fire, and emulated the virtue of Metal, appeared unassuming. In truth, it was incredibly durable and sharp, no weaker than a typical spiritual sword. Qi Lanyan had used this very blade to outmaneuver countless opponents.

But his opponent today was also one of righteousness—the Dui Metal, the very essence of righteousness among all metals.

_Clang!_

The streak of white light flashed past in the blink of an eye, but it lacked the graceful elegance of the Celestial Moon Sword. Instead, it contained a vast, unshakable righteousness of pure yang.

_Boom!_

As the white light faded from Qi Lanyan’s pupils, a line of crimson had already appeared on his neck. It crept up to his chin in an instant, tracing a path past his lips before vanishing near the corner of his eye.

_Thump!_

As if countless leaves were drifting to the ground, the youth took a step back, his figure reappearing dozens of feet away. His pupils were wide. The bloodstain from a moment ago seemed like a phantom, yet his expression turned grim.

The technique-sword was still in his hand, but its luster was gone, now dull and lifeless. An inch-long, crack-like pattern of brilliant white now marred its surface.

A sudden dread seized the youth’s heart.

'Martial Uncle…'

Wang Ziya was right there in Xuanmiao Temple, yet he hadn’t made a move. His Martial Uncle’s mission was to contain the south; there was no reason for him to go back on his word. His failure to appear could only mean one thing.

'Exiled Qi!'

The dense black clouds blanketing the sky began to churn like a tempest. It was as if a great beast was trampling through the murky depths of a lake, stirring up monstrous waves. Faintly, one could even hear the tremors of the great hall of the Underworld.

'Yang Ruiyi… he definitely set a trap!'

His own sudden scheme had forced Yang Ruiyi’s hand, even driving a wedge between the Yang and Li families and making the great general take the blame. How could Yang Ruiyi not be furious? He was bound to plot against him.

A chill washed over Qi Lanyan’s mind. In the instant he retreated, he had already flicked his sleeve.

'Verdant Grove!'

A pale green illusion bloomed out from him, waves of trees and forests rippling into existence. A dense jungle crashed down, drowning the surrounding scenery. At last, he saw the source of the white light.

It was a profound sword, pure white from hilt to tip, adorned with faint golden patterns resembling pear blossoms on cracked ice.

And it was almost upon him.

Qi Lanyan’s face changed. A brilliant radiance erupted from his palms, two beads of ink-black energy materializing within them. He clapped his hands together before him, his words a desperate, hurried chant.

“Let Dharma reside in the Valley Water!”

An inky blackness instantly climbed his hands. His figure had just begun to rise and vanish when the sword light, like a falling star, smashed into the empty space where he had been, striking him from the air.

_Boom!_

A torrent of Valley Water cascaded in all directions, only to be cleaved in two by the impossibly sharp sword qi. The youth fell from the air once more, a trickle of blood at his lips. A vast Sword Intent coiled around him, carving countless tiny cuts across his face.

Yet Qi Lanyan showed no fear or anger. His expression relaxed. The purple silk sash tied at his waist was now clutched in his hand. It began to grow at an astonishing rate, becoming like layers of purple mist that finally locked onto the pear wood sword.

But in a flash, a cold, snow-white energy flowed down the blade.

'Present Departs Old.'

The pear wood sword vanished. Beneath the layers of purple silk, only a golden sword-mark remained, throbbing like a living thing. The sword itself had already withdrawn and was now aimed directly between Qi Lanyan’s brows.

'Present Departs Old.'

'What a masterful "Present Departs Old"!'

Qi Lanyan had no time to ponder how perfectly the Underworld had chosen this technique for Lingmei. The pear blossom sword was already thundering toward him. He had no choice but to tilt his head back, take a deep breath, and spit out a stream of azure light.

The moment this light appeared, the very heavens and earth seemed to change color. An endless wind rose, blowing from east to west in a brilliant display. The man’s figure rose with the wind, dissipating like smoke.

'Ushering Spring’s Dawn.'

This divine ability was completely different from his previous ones. It was less like wood and more like wind, a shifting, uneven azure that not only lifted Qi Lanyan’s body but also sent a tremor through the cultivators to the north, shrouding the area in a faint haze.

But the man in white only took a single step. His second divine ability flared to life, a field of autumn white like snow, drifting gently toward them.

The white appeared without warning, yet it felt entirely natural. It seemed to blanket the entire sky, yet it was also filled with infinite gaps. The gale that Qi Lanyan had become swirled and spun but could not escape. Instead, it was continuously torn apart within those razor-sharp voids, its power rapidly diminishing.

'Sovereign of Dui Edge!'

Qi Lanyan had clearly anticipated this divine ability. His face was like ice as a clear light enveloped him, and a profound aura that nothing could disturb rose from his body. He slipped free, and the profound drum finally rose into the air. In his hand, however, was a small, golden stick, which he slammed down hard upon the drum's surface. A golden ring of light rippled outward.

His vision was filled with Wu Light!

The autumn-hued world created by Sovereign of Dui Edge seemed to have met its nemesis. Like snow under a scorching sun, it melted away, viciously pushed back by the golden light. The divine ability was instantly broken. The sword-mark under the purple silk froze, and even the winds of spring stirred by Qi Lanyan’s Ushering Spring’s Dawn died down. The pear blossom sword retracted its edge and returned to its master's hand.

Across the whole of Lake Xian, all divine abilities stagnated, almost simultaneously fading. Even the Exiled Qi in the sky trembled, revealing a sliver of light from within.

This was the light of Wu Earth, hailed as Flawless.

Qi Lanyan, momentarily free, was overjoyed. He shot into the air, a small, white jade pearl already appearing in his palm. He was just about to chant an incantation when all the light before him dispersed, and from within the Wu Light, the tip of a halberd appeared.

Li Zhouwei!

'Touba Ci… that bastard!'

With the sword immortal intercepting him and Zhelu hiding in a corner of the battlefield to tie up loose ends, the one responsible for stopping Li Zhouwei was naturally Touba Ci. For Li Zhouwei to suddenly appear here could only mean that Touba Ci had failed.

Rage flared in the youth’s heart like a leaping flame. But nearby, Touba Ci was even more helpless, his heart filled with frustration.

'His Huai River Map is suppressing my Profound Seal. Without a way to restrain him, between his Crimson Severing Arrowhead and his Sovereign's Perilous Tread, if he was determined to break through, who could possibly stop him?'

The thought vanished in an instant. Touba Ci whipped his head around and saw a middle-aged man with a sword on his back standing before him. The man’s face was steady, and his body was protected by the same peerlessly sharp Dui Metal Qi as the sword immortal. Touba Ci raised an eyebrow in thought.

'Sword Gate… Cheng Jiuwen.'

Qi Lanyan, however, had no chance to show his anger. He could only watch as the halberd, shimmering with a whitish light, came at him. The King of Wei’s aura was overwhelming, his divine might limitless. For a moment, Qi Lanyan was frozen in place.

He had just used his ultimate trump card, the Flawless Wu Light of Subjugation!

'Was it Sovereign's Perilous Tread?'

Qi Lanyan’s mind went blank.

'How is that possible?'

Although Li Zhouwei was charging him with that very divine ability, and its power to return things to their proper course was certainly at work, Qi Lanyan knew full well that its might was not infinite. In this day and age, it was impossible for the Wu Light to be within its restorative range.

'Then… why?'

He had no time to think. The purple silk in his hands flew out, each end wrapping around one of his palms. The once-soft fabric now surged with a purple-gold light, becoming as hard as cast iron.

_Clang!_

But the long halberd, gleaming with a pearly white sheen, was deceptively light. It shattered against the iron-like silk as if it were glass. A more brilliant golden light, like a coiling dragon, shot past the silk and straight toward the space between Qi Lanyan’s brows.

While Cheng Xunzhi had been battling Qi Lanyan, Li Zhouwei had used Touba Ci to stack the Bright King technique on top of Grand Ascension. Now, empowered by this divine marvel, the power of First Strike was unleashed.

The energy of Binding Light, long since accumulated, coordinated with it, casting a white brilliance that locked Qi Lanyan in place.

This disciple of Guanhua had a profound Dao-Profundity and was covered in treasures, but the Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal had already pushed him to the brink. His divine abilities were in disarray and his senses were failing. He was utterly trapped.

A flicker of hesitation crossed his pupils as that familiar murderous intent of Dui Metal washed over him. He gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and connected with the jade talisman in his sleeve.

_Crack!_

His Daoist robes activated on their own to protect him, forming layer upon layer of barriers that cracked and splintered before the golden blade. The halberd’s advance slowed as if moving through thick mud, but it pushed forward relentlessly, finally piercing his brow.

But a light flared on the youth’s chest, revealing a cyan jade gemstone. The gem’s power activated, its nature incredibly close to Upright Wood, making his entire body as hard as metal and locking away all damage. Qi Lanyan’s body suddenly shattered, turning into a rolling gale of verdant wind. His heart seized with cold terror as the jade talisman in his sleeve broke, and the bright white light of Veiled Yin finally rose.

Cheng Xunzhi was appearing right behind him.

The sword immortal’s divine ability responded, transforming into a series of golden-white profound patterns that twisted and tangled, converging on a single point to form a shattered, diamond shape.

'Palace of Retracted Killing.'

Sixteen golden-white blades of varying sizes materialized, their sharp points and long edges spinning, all aimed at one spot. The gale of verdant wind was thrown into chaos, and all light grew heavy. The youth was immediately forced out of his wind form.

The pear blossom sword would give him no more time to react. The white-gold light on it intensified to its absolute peak.

'Unending Edge.'

The Sword of Pure Yang Qi, Establishing Yang and Controlling Bitterness!

With Li Zhouwei buying him time, the Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal, empowered by four divine abilities, had ample opportunity to unleash his Sword Intent. The entire world went dark, all color and light condensing onto that single blade. The light screen generated by the Guanhua disciple’s life-saving talisman instantly solidified, then, as if struck by something terrifying, it caved inward.

_Crack…_

White light scattered as the barrier shattered violently.

The Sword Intent still held power. The long blade tore through the air like a blade through silk. As light flashed, Qi Lanyan’s black Daoist robes flew, the colors seeming to shift wildly before the Sword Intent passed right through them.

The sword of Dui Metal had finally pierced the dharma body protected by a Spiritual Treasure.

_Pfft._

The color drained from Qi Lanyan’s face. His entire body was nearly sliced in two at the waist, held together by only a sliver of skin and flesh. The purple silk whipped around his waist with lightning speed. The sword immortal’s gaze was cold as he reversed his grip and slashed back.

This strike was as vast as mountains and rivers. It came crashing down, only to vanish into thin air right in front of Qi Lanyan.

The colors in the sky above had faded. The long-bearded Daoist Master retracted a green stone tablet now covered in sword marks. A hint of anger touched his usually placid eyes as he gave the gourd in his hand a slight shake.

In an instant, lightning fell and flames raged, erupting from nothing to encircle Qi Lanyan. Wang Ziya then turned the mouth of the gourd and said in a low voice,

“Fellow Daoist Cheng! This humble Daoist has been waiting for you for a long time!”

At his call, a heavy purple light poured from the gourd’s mouth, like a dim and hazy world. Cheng Xunzhi focused his gaze on it, his expression slowly turning grave.

In that brief moment, Qi Lanyan forced down the blood in his throat. The purple silk was already tied around his waist, wrapped several times and knotted tight. The unique power of Upright Wood responded, doing its best to contain the Sword Intent.

His hands did not stop. He held the technique-sword in one, while the other formed a two-fingered sword seal, pressing it against the blade’s spine.

“By my decree!”

The technique-sword flared with golden light, locking onto the long halberd flying out from the raging flames. Qi Lanyan’s face paled slightly as the deep halberd-wound between his brows began to rapidly close.

'Trying to suppress me while I'm down? Naive!'

The Dao Lineage he, Qi Lanyan, cultivated was Horn Wood, which excelled at healing. It wasn’t particularly renowned for combat, but as a divine ability of Wood Virtue, it made him the least susceptible to injury. The Upright Wood Spiritual Treasure on his chest contained its own wonders that complemented his arts. When wood flourishes, it becomes unyielding; his inner stores were indestructible.

The sword wound looked grievous, but his protective talisman from the Guanhua Daoist tradition and his enchanted robes had already nullified seventy to eighty percent of the damage. With the Spiritual Treasure on his person locking the wound, his injuries were not severe.

His only regret was that the Sword Intent was terrifying. The Marvelous Purple Silk of the Profound Immortal Treasure had to be used to suppress his injuries and could not be used for anything else.

There wasn't a trace of panic in his eyes, only calm and cold focus. He spun the technique-sword, and it stuck to the long halberd like a persistent specter. His voice was icy.

“The nuisance is finally gone… Your Highness.”

But no response came from the flames. The force behind the halberd grew more and more terrifying, making his technique-sword tremble. The protective lightning and fire Wang Ziya had summoned for him began to fade, revealing the scene on the other side.

The golden shaft of the halberd was held in a man’s hand. The raging black flames were reflected in Qi Lanyan’s eyes, making his pupils widen.

Behind Li Zhouwei were six arms of black flame, each holding a treasure.

One held a Gilt Treasure Plate with mysterious white markings, mirroring another that brandished a Divine Mace of Profound Thunder with a marvelous purple-gold blade, which flashed with heavenly light and rumbled with thunder. One grasped the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, gleaming with deep golden light, opposite another that clutched the Honored Banner of Ting Province, crimson-purple on a field of black, its presence heavy and solid, seeming to tower over the Great Void. One brandished the Pure Yang Bracelets of the Imperial Wei, facing another that held the Huai River Map of a once-loyal True Monarch. Brightness Culminating in Splendor, a magnificent Dao extremity.

The light in the Guanhua disciple’s eyes wavered. He heard Li Zhouwei’s voice—it was the first time he had ever heard the King of Wei speak. The tone was cold and magnetic.

“Fellow Daoist Qi.”

The sky had already grown dark, the setting sun crouching on the horizon like a monstrous beast. Two thick arms covered in white scales held the White-Forged Rekindled King halberd, its crescent blade having locked Qi Lanyan’s technique-sword in place.

The King of Wei’s armor was a sleek, smooth black-gold. His face was hidden by a helm, leaving only thick black flames and a pair of cold, golden eyes submerged in darkness.

“Do not be like Vast Cicada.”




# Chapter 1155: Turmoil in Jianghuai

Chengshui Marsh.

The sky was a brilliant canvas of sparse clouds above verdant mountains. The water's surface was a sheet of placid, clear ripples. To the south, a storm of change was brewing, but here, an unnerving tranquility reigned over the marsh. In a high pavilion, a cool breeze drifted through as two Daoist Masters, dressed in starkly different attire, sat opposite one another, engrossed in a game of Go over tea.

The man to the west was plain-featured, clad in a long white-feathered robe with a saber at his waist and a jade gourd by his side. The man to the east appeared remarkably young, his eyes bright and full of spirit, his collar fluttering in the breeze.

On the table, to his right, lay a single, pale purple talisman.

They played in silence for a time until, from the distant south, an aura of boundless golden qi seemed to rise. The man in the west looked up, his voice soft.

"A Dui Metal Great Daoist Master."

A faint smile touched the lips of the youth seated opposite him.

"Even in a grotto-heaven, there are few such masters!"

This statement carried a hidden weight, enough to make Daoist Master Changyun, the man in the west, rise to his feet. He turned, his gaze unreadable.

"That depends… on which grotto-heaven."

Yehui looked up, his expression calm.

"The Azure Revolution Heaven."

Changyun stared at him, unsurprised. He rested a hand on the table, his fingers closing around a white stone.

"Wei Xuanyin certainly holds you in high regard," he said coolly. "What brings you here this time? To monitor me? Or to restrain me?"

"Fellow Daoist Zhang, you misunderstand."

Yehui's gaze flickered as he offered praise.

"The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition's methods are as they have been for a millennium—a tapestry of light and shadow. Were it not for Lord Yao's personal warning, I fear even Lord Wei would have remained unaware."

The words could be taken as a compliment or a thinly veiled taunt. Zhang Yun arched an eyebrow, his eyes narrowing.

Perhaps others could not see it, but as a deep-cover agent for the Golden Feather Sect for many years, Changyun—or rather, Zhang Yun—felt it most keenly. From a strategic perspective, the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition's current gambit was not proceeding smoothly.

His True Monarch, a master strategist, had arranged for him to infiltrate Jianghuai long ago, hoping to claim a piece of the great game to come. For Zhang Yun, that piece was no ordinary prize—it was a strand of destiny itself.

The very destiny that would decide the fate of the north and south.

He, Zhang Yun, was originally groomed to become the master of Jianghuai's rogue cultivators, a powerful arm of the Great Zhao dynasty.

In the judgment of the Golden Feather cultivators, the northern power had always been reclusive; Guanhua had no reason to intervene. Even if they did, as long as Zhang Yun could consolidate the forces of Jianghuai in time, he would command a powerful voice in any negotiation.

Once True Qi fully manifested in the world and his work was done, he would rally his forces, declare for the Great Song, and use the immense karmic weight of swaying the entire realm's fate to fulfill his Daoist Tradition's mission of 'Revolution'. Such a feat would allow him to transcend the Purple Mystery realm and would be of immense benefit in his future Quest for Gold.

But during the Bright Yang incident, Zhang Yun had been outmaneuvered by the Buddhists and suffered significant injuries. This setback was manageable for the Golden Oneness, but the true disaster was the exposure of his trump cards, which cast suspicion upon his identity.

Perhaps that suspicion was what invited the plot against him in the first place. Regardless, the situation had spiraled downward. Guanhua intervened with overwhelming force, not only ruining his opportunity but repeatedly targeting and sidelining him.

If he could go south now, backstab the north, and join the Song, he might still snatch a few threads of destiny—a pittance, but better than nothing. Yet even in this dire state, Qi Lanyan was exceedingly wary of him. He would rather leave two of his mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators behind than fail to keep Zhang Yun under watch here at Watersign Ridge.

To ruin a cultivator's opportunity is tantamount to taking their life. The fact that this direct heir of the Zhang clan was still willing to sit and play Go with him was a gesture of immense respect toward the Guanhua Daoist Tradition.

Hearing Yehui's words, Zhang Yun dropped all pretence.

"I may not be able to kill Qi Lanyan," he said quietly, "but do you think I can't kill you?"

Yehui’s expression remained unchanged. 

"Fellow Daoist Zhang, you misunderstand. If this were truly the scheme of that True Monarch from a thousand years ago, would people like us ever have the chance to sit before you and address you as an equal?"

He smiled mysteriously.

"And that is precisely what makes it so terrifying."

Changyun's gaze froze for a fraction of a second. He raised his brows. Yehui continued with a smile,

"The Dui Metal has only recently been established, after all. When speaking of the Golden Core cultivators of the realm, your noble True Monarch may not be known for the purity of his attainment, but he can turn a peripheral advantage into a dominant position. Even a Dao Embryo is nothing before such mastery. Who would dare belittle his profound Dao-Profundity? Who would dare offend a direct heir of his clan?"

"Jianghuai will be lost, sooner or later. Who wouldn't offer the simple favor of helping matters along?"

A shift occurred in Zhang Yun's eyes. Yehui rose from his seat, smiling.

"When I left the monastery, Lord Wei gave me a specific instruction: 'Go to Chengyun as a guest.' The earnest goodwill in those words… every time I, Ziyu, reflect upon it, I am truly moved!"

Though his words were steeped in courtesy, Yehui's tone was utterly sincere. The tremor in his eyes was no act; it betrayed a deep, hidden dread.

He had believed his communications with the Li clan were flawless. Before his departure, Wei Xuanyin had been nothing but cordial, his voice gentle, showing no hint of anything amiss. For a moment, Bai Ziyu hadn't even questioned the phrase 'Go to Chengyun as a guest'…

But upon leaving the Profound Governance Pavilion, he saw that the normally bare, polished terrace now held a bronze cauldron.

Within the cauldron was a pool of Wall-Sinking Water.

In his life, Yehui had plotted against countless people, but this was the first time he had been frightened into a cold sweat.

What did it mean?

It meant this Daoist Master Wei knew his true purpose from start to finish. It meant that while appearing indifferent to the affairs of Jianghuai, he was, in fact, omniscient. He even knew what Yehui had hidden on his own mountain; he was perfectly aware of the tacit agreement with Li Zhouwei.

And yet, Yehui had met no resistance. He had walked out of the capital and traveled south without issue, even receiving the official task of keeping watch over Changyun.

Yehui's strategic mind was second to none. How could he fail to grasp the message from the Profound Governance Pavilion? It was because he understood that, even before reaching Jianghuai, even without knowing that Wang Ziya had emerged from seclusion, he had arrived at a crystal-clear conclusion.

'Jianghuai is lost. Qi Lanyan is going to retreat.'

'And the Golden Oneness is still the Golden Oneness, a branch of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition. Guanhua has played the fool for long enough, suppressing Zhang Yun without just cause. Now that Qi Lanyan is on the verge of offending the Yang clan, they can no longer afford to be so dismissive of the Golden Oneness!'

His understanding was absolute. Across from him, Changyun was no simple man either. Hearing just that one sentence, his thoughts cleared. He looked up, his tone inscrutable.

"Oh?"

Yehui took a sip of tea and lowered his head in silence. Under the watchful eyes of the two Daoist Masters, the purple talisman on the jade table stirred without a breeze. With a soft pop, it erupted in a flash of silver-white fire.

_Fwoosh…_

The flame bloomed and vanished as quickly as a night-blooming cereus. The pavilion was now empty, save for the faint ripples in the teacup, which quickly settled into stillness.

---

The icy voice echoed through the air, and a dark shadow fell over Qi Lanyan's features.

'Vast Cicada…'

He understood Li Zhouwei's meaning perfectly. The current stalemate, forcing a decisive battle between north and south, was not truly his doing. The real catalyst was Li Zhouwei—it was the death of Vast Cicada.

Li Zhouwei was comparing him to Vast Cicada because Vast Cicada, too, had every reason not to die. His backer was also a major figure, yet he had fallen. The only difference was that Qi Lanyan's backer was stronger. But if Vast Cicada could perish, why not Qi Lanyan?

His expression remained placid as he watched the golden light manifest between heaven and earth. He said nothing, merely tilting his head back as a jade-like gem on his person began to glow.

He, Qi Lanyan, was laden with treasures. The Drum of Annihilating Profound Thunder was borrowed from his Daoist Tradition; the Marvellous Purple Silk of the Profound Immortal Treasure belonged to Wei Xuanyin. But this 'Upright Wood' Spiritual Treasure was his own—a prize he had personally retrieved from the Qi clan estate upon achieving his divine ability.

A pale purple light swept out, accompanied by shifting, overlapping illusions of white. Thunderheads gathered at the zenith, then descended upon the lake like a waterfall, crashing toward the northern cultivators. At its epicentre, a power that had been gathering for some time—a threefold torrent of destruction—suddenly fell.

The triple-bolt attack was renowned for its blinding speed. Before any other technique could land, the Demonbane Cleaver Mace arrived, and an explosion of lightning slammed into the deep green light of the 'Upright Wood'.

_Dong!_

The Demonbane Cleaver Mace was a ritual artifact from Wanling Heaven. It rumbled against the surface of the thunder-resistant 'Upright Wood' Spiritual Treasure. But the lightning was merely a feint. From within the rolling thunder, a golden halberd shot forth.

'So fast…'

Qi Lanyan instantly reversed his grip on his spell-sword. There was no time to cast another art; the brilliant golden light had already converged and was crashing down.

_Dong!_

The pale gold radiance shattered. Empowered by the Huai River Map, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd's might was magnified. The 'Upright Wood' Spiritual Treasure, having just weathered the Sword Intent, saw its newly raised emerald screen of light instantly crumble.

Qi Lanyan seized the brief respite. Dark pearls materialized in his palms, which he pressed together before him, his incantation urgent.

"Let Dharma reside in the Valley Water!"

The power of the Valley Water surged, allowing him to escape by the narrowest of margins.

But his form had barely solidified when the golden weapon was already before his eyes.

The power of the Bright Yang was immense. Injured and having lost the upper hand, Qi Lanyan was forced onto the defensive. But he had learned from their prior exchange and knew the secrets of the halberd. His composure held firm. Releasing his sword, he struck the drum.

_BOOM!_

Silver-white lightning erupted with immediate effect. It not only blocked the golden assault but sent a current of energy flowing back, rooting Li Zhouwei to the spot.

Qi Lanyan felt no relief. He was about to form a hand seal to transform into wind when his expression froze and his head snapped down.

In that instant, as all things were held in stasis by the raging thunder, a long, sharp weapon had passed through the chaos like a phantom and pierced his chest.

The object was ten feet long, like a spear, with a perfectly smooth, unadorned surface.

Qi Lanyan recognized it instantly.

'The Descending Radiance Equal Edge!'

'An artifact of 'Wandering Metal'!'

He felt the divine ability within him shudder and dissipate.

The Descending Radiance Equal Edge was an unorthodox weapon. It lacked complex marvels, instead taking the 'Wandering Metal' philosophy—of untethered existence and avoidance of the mortal coil—to its absolute extreme. This was how it had slipped past the binding thunder. But for that same reason, its piercing strike did not cause severe disruption. With his level of Dao-Profundity, Qi Lanyan could have forced his divine ability to function.

The problem was… the Wandering Metal, upon entering his body, had touched upon and aggravated the old Sword Intent injury left by Cheng Xunzhi.

It was more than just his divine ability failing. Qi Lanyan's face went white. If not for the purple silk at his waist tightening protectively, the Daoist Master would have spat blood then and there.

His condition was critical. He had no time to spare. The Celestial Gate above was already descending, wreathed in violet flames. Against Li Zhouwei in his current state, backed by the suppressive power of the Huai River Map, Qi Lanyan dared not risk a direct confrontation.

The initiative he had fought so hard to gain was lost. He could only raise a hand and produce the white porcelain bottle once more. Dawn Qi surged forth, forming a dense sea of clouds to block the descending Celestial Gate.

A moment's delay, an eternity behind. In that brief instant, the sky plunged into darkness. The youth above, his eyes blazing, seemed to command an unnatural dusk to ascend as a massive pillar of black-gold light—piercing heaven and earth—smashed down upon Qi Lanyan.

_BOOM!_

The youth fell like a meteor, striking the vast, empty marsh. Li Zhouwei remained where he stood, black flames dancing around him, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass already responding.

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass was a unique artifact. Its power accumulated in advance. Whether held upright for attack or reversed for defence, it required only a brief connection with a divine ability to be used. However, it held only four charges. With each use, a ring of runes would dim. Once all four were expended, its casting time would increase dramatically.

He had used one charge in reverse to evade an attack earlier. Now, of the four astral sigils, three were gold and one was white. The Sun-Surging Governing Stars at the center of his brow spun, shifting from a defensive reversal to an offensive alignment.

High Radiance, upright—the light of annihilation!

_Dong!_

The beam of pure, brilliant light subsumed the Emperor Qi's Light and slammed into the earth.

Qi Lanyan was on his knees, caught in the blast. His entire body shimmered with golden light, his hands trembling as they braced against the ground.

Golden celestial light, like molten rock, streamed down his cheeks. The cyan gem on his chest smoked, as his 'Horn Wood' divine ability and the 'Upright Wood' marvel linked desperately, throwing up one defence after another.

Just as the light of annihilation began to fade and the youth slowly pushed himself up, the center of Li Zhouwei’s brow flashed once more.

Pushing his Dao-Profundity to the limit, he overloaded the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. A second golden-white beam of annihilation descended.

_BOOM!_

Qi Lanyan, who had just begun to rise, was slammed back to his knees. Before he could even muster a divine ability, a third beam followed without pause.

A vast radiance instantly consumed the world. Even the Crimson Severing Arrowhead quietly withdrew, revealing a lake surface interwoven with the chaotic energies of divine abilities.

_Tssss…_

The Sun-Surging Governing Stars between Li Zhouwei’s brows had faded to a pale white. His aura fluctuated wildly as he swallowed a mouthful of blood, his gaze like ice.

On the ground below, the Daoist robe on the youth’s upper body had been completely obliterated. His flesh had melted away, exposing jade-green organs and stark white bone. Under the lingering destructive light, his body was simultaneously dissolving and regenerating with furious speed, attempting to heal.

Horrified gazes fell upon him from all directions, but they all swept past his gruesome injuries to fixate on his hand.

In his palm, which the light of annihilation had stripped to the bone, flesh was rapidly regrowing. And held within it was a small, two-finger-wide object.

It was no more than three inches long, a fusion of cyan, blue, and purple hues that swirled together. It looked like a small twig broken from a tree, its tiny branches covered in dense, sesame-seed-sized cyan leaves.

In that instant, every divine ability between heaven and earth seemed to dim. All sound faded into the distance. Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes reflected a radiant, unified, multicolored light.

He vaguely heard someone shouting, their voice tight with fury, but it reached his ears as a mere whisper:

"The Crystalline Jade Branch!"




# Chapter 1156: A Fatal Turn

The small, ornate branch landed in a palm, sending tremors through the divine abilities of all present. The first to react was not Li Zhouwei, nor was it the cultivators of the North and South clashing across the land, but the one who stood high above the roiling Exiled Qi.

Wang Ziya!

The divine abilities of this great cultivator from grotto-heaven were consolidated and steady. It was only after his battle with the Dui Metal Sword Immortal before him grew heated that the auras of his various powers began to faintly emerge. The gourd in his hand effortlessly absorbed its surroundings, continuously sweeping the sky clean of golden qi.

It was obvious that this Spiritual Treasure, brought from grotto-heaven, had been prepared specifically for Cheng Xunzhi!

Because of this, Wang Ziya still had the capacity to observe the situation on the ground. But when he saw that ornate branch leap forth, the great cultivator’s expression changed drastically. A thick wave of fear washed over him, and he roared,

"Qi Lanyan! How dare you!"

What was the Crystalline Jade Branch?

Long ago, when Tongxuan Palace was founded, it accepted qi refiners from all corners of the world and proclaimed itself the very font of the Immortal Dao. Its three founding True Monarchs established the celestial palace and personally planted a spirit root. All the renowned Dao lineages of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition were present. In the end, they selected a disciple to manage their affairs in the mortal world; his surname was Shangguan, and his given name, Zidu.

For over a century, Shangguan Zidu presided over Tongxuan Palace as the three True Monarchs took turns preaching the Dao. Qi refiners from across the world flocked to listen. The spirit root, having absorbed so many profound truths, sought to attain a Metal nature. But alas, it fell just short. It perished on the spot, its entire body transforming into Wu Stone.

Shangguan Zidu summoned the patriarchs of the various lineages, divided the stone into seven pieces, and bestowed them upon the seven great Comprehending Profoundity branches of the era. From then on, whether those lineages split or merged, a piece of the stone would be passed down as a symbol of their shared heritage.

The piece in Qi Lanyan’s hand was the symbol of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao, a small branch from the original Guanhua Dao lineage.

Wang Ziya, of course, understood Wei Xuanyin's intentions. This artifact hadn’t been given to Qi Lanyan for battle. To hold it was to represent the honor of Guanhua; it was meant to save his life in a moment of crisis!

But that by no means implied the ancient Spiritual Treasure was weak. It had been refined and passed down by generations of Daoist Masters of Comprehending Profoundity for millennia. With that much effort, even a common stone could be refined into a Spiritual Treasure, to say nothing of an artifact with such a noble origin.

This was the source of his terror.

'He isn't a Wu Earth cultivator, but if he can unleash even a tenth of its power and kill or cripple this White Qilin, who will bear the fury of the great powers of the North and South? Guanhua? The Qi Clan?'

The last person caught off guard, Daoist Master Houfu, had been grazed by the light of the Crystalline Jade Branch and his body and soul were nearly obliterated. If not for his Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch, not even a speck of bone would have remained. Tinglan, though protected by a Spiritual Treasure of her own, had also been grievously wounded.

The Great Daoist Master was seized with panic and drew a azure stone artifact from his sleeve. The second person whose expression changed was Lin Chensheng of the Great Xiukui Monastery.

This Daoist Master could never forget how his elder had died before his very eyes. The fluctuations of Wu Earth from that small wooden box were seared into his soul. A chill crept over his body, and the vicious fires of hatred blazed in his eyes, stabbing toward Qi Lanyan like swords.

But the light came too quickly. Li Zhouwei was already at the point of exhaustion. The multicolored light in his eyes flared as he felt the world recede from him, only managing the faintest stir of his spiritual sense.

A purple talisman in his sleeve, long since saturated with dharma power, burst into flame of its own accord. The four golden characters of the Capital Immortals Great Dao flared to life, raising a vista of white mountains and purple waters before him. Spirits and deities rose up behind him, lending their power to the defense.

It was the purple-patterned talisman he had received from the Capital Immortals Dao all those years ago.

It wasn’t that the Li Clan had never acquired Purple Mansion Realm talismans, but the way of talismans had its inherent limitations. They required spiritual ink and special paper, which made them useful at lower cultivation levels. But as one’s cultivation rose, the resources became prohibitively expensive, and their cost-effectiveness plummeted.

By the Foundation Establishment Realm, their shortcomings were already apparent. At the Purple Mansion Realm, materials capable of channeling a divine ability were so costly that it was simply no longer practical. Settling for lesser materials meant a drastic drop in power. Aside from figures like Duanmu Kui or Si Boxiu, who were masters of the Shaman-Register Dao or hailed from lineages with unique inheritances, few Purple Mansion cultivators were willing to waste their efforts on talismans.

But in all fairness, the power of this talisman from Yehui was considerable. It was clearly a high-quality item obtained from grotto-heaven.

The Capital Guard divine ability it unleashed was no weaker than a defense mounted by Yehui himself. Yet as the multicolored light drifted forward, the purple waters evaporated, the white mountains crumbled, and the assembled deities bowed their heads.

It all scattered like dust on the wind.

The Heavenly Light in the sky dimmed, and the pitch-black manifestation that had cloaked the horizon vanished. The eyes that had always shone with a brilliant gold light snapped shut, and King Wei threw his head back.

"Splash!"

A soft sound broke the silence of the lake.

Wang Ziya’s face was grim. The azure stone in his hand was scalding hot and covered in thick, multicolored light, a web of cracks spreading across its surface. There was no regret in his eyes, only terror. He completely ignored the sword light racing toward his face, his gaze fixed anxiously on the youth above the water.

'I don't cultivate the Whole Pill. The divine ability of this Blade-Shifting Stone is limited... I'm afraid... I can't protect him!'

"Crack..."

A chorus of shattering sounds filled the air as the Primal Summit armor broke apart. There was no spectacular flash, no overwhelming aura. Under a dozen horrified gazes, Li Zhouwei tipped backward and fell like a falling star, crashing into the lake and sending up a colossal wave.

The battlefield fell silent. Divine abilities retracted. Every gaze, filled with shock and horror, moved like lightning to land on Qi Lanyan’s face.

The young man was still kneeling, the flesh of his face knitting itself back together at a visible rate. His eyes finally reappeared, staring south with an unwavering gaze.

Qi Lanyan’s eyes were suddenly crystal clear.

He struggled to his feet and took a step. A movement technique activated, carrying him several li in an instant. He rushed toward the lake and plunged into the water, where he finally saw the young king.

His ink-black armor was gone, replaced by a tattered, gold-patterned robe whose shredded fragments drifted in the current.

King Wei's entire upper body was bare, covered in a dense network of porcelain-like cracks. In several places, golden-white organs and bones were visible. Rivulets of blood, thick as mercury, floated in the water, coalescing into tiny golden spheres.

Qi Lanyan took a step forward, then froze.

The young man’s tightly shut eyes snapped open.

His face was a mask of colorful cracks, and his normally golden eyes were now swimming with a thick, multicolored light. His entire aura had changed, twisting into something demonic. Qi Lanyan felt the hair on his body stand on end. His throat constricted as a massive hand clamped down on him.

The man before him was trembling from head to toe, clearly enduring immense agony, yet his multicolored eyes were fixed on him, radiating an unnatural chill. Before Qi Lanyan could think, the fist fell.

Qi Lanyan’s Upright Wood Spiritual Treasure, no matter how profound, had long been dimmed by the Great Daoist Master’s Sword Intent and the three impacts from the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. It could not recover. The divine protection of Upright Wood that had enveloped him, once as unyielding as metal, had failed.

"BOOM!"

His fragile neck splintered with a series of sharp cracks. His face caved in as shimmering, elixir-like blood sprayed into the water. The face that had just finished healing shattered like porcelain under the blow.

'Ushering Spring’s Dawn'!

Qi Lanyan reacted in a flash, dissolving into verdant wind to retreat. Time seemed to resume across Lake Xian as divine abilities flared back to life with a deafening roar.

Before everyone’s eyes, the verdant wind rapidly reconverged several li away, forming Qi Lanyan’s headless body. But something else was faster: a seamless, ancient golden spear.

Descending Radiance Equal Edge!

Facing the approaching spear, Qi Lanyan froze for a heartbeat before realization dawned. Limitless fear flooded his heart. He recklessly cut off his divine ability and summoned a sword technique.

But dark clouds were already roiling overhead. Something had been lying in ambush, and now it revealed itself.

It was an object the size of a man’s arm, covered in purple-and-gold patterns and split into three flanges, upon which were carved majestic scenes of slaying demons. It was the Demonbane Cleaver Mace.

The mace had been gathering power in the clouds for some time, its range vast enough to cover half of Lake Xian, easily enveloping him. Now, it responded, and a bolt of lightning descended.

The bolt was neither silver nor purple, but an ethereal, weightless cyan. It seemed as light as a feather, yet it fell with the force of a mountain, striking Qi Lanyan squarely.

Compared to the triple thunderbolts from before, this attack was weak—weaker, even, than the storm that had covered a hundred-li radius. But as it struck the young man, it sent a tremor through his entire body, so violent that he couldn't even hold his sword.

The Demonbane Cleaver Mace’s Cloud-Patrol technique was designed for ambushes, accumulating power in the clouds to unleash a punitive thunderbolt. The Li Clan had rarely used it, but this specific bolt had a unique effect.

A direct hit inflicted overwhelming, unbearable pain.

It was a power normally used to punish disciples. By all rights, someone of Qi Lanyan’s skill should never have been struck head-on. But now, he was utterly spent and had no choice but to take the blow. In an instant, his powers scattered, and he nearly tumbled from the sky.

"Puchi..."

The Descending Radiance Equal Edge pierced through his chest.

Qi Lanyan’s headless form hung frozen in the air. A fist-sized hole ran clean through his torso, and a faint, dark-golden light pulsed around the wound, as if in response to some unseen call.

The heir of Guanhua was immobilized.

Qi Lanyan cultivated Horn Wood. When it came to suppressing injuries and healing wounds, his Dao lineage was among the best in the world. Losing a head or having his heart pierced was not, in fact, a grievous injury.

But his body began to tremble violently as a wave of intense pain and weakness flooded his mind. At his weakest moment, the Sword Intent wound at his waist had been triggered for a second time.

'He knows... that Wandering Metal is the most dangerous thing to me right now.'

Qi Lanyan knew it, too. Years of study within the Guanhua lineage and Wei Xuanyin’s personal tutelage had given him a perfect understanding of his own injuries.

'Wandering, though it consumes, does not exhaust the root. It is the metal of storing and nurturing, symbolized by a golden coffer or ore-rich earth.'

That was a direct quote from the Guanhua Dao Canon. Wandering Metal was a form of metal that nourished other things. The Dui Metal wound in his body was a latent form of Vault Metal.

'Nourished by Wandering Metal, the Vault Metal grows stronger. The injury... it becomes more severe. The first time I was hit by the Descending Radiance Equal Edge, that's what triggered the Sword Intent.'

But back then, he had two Spiritual Treasures suppressing it. Now, not only was he at the end of his rope, but he also lacked the protection of his Upright Wood Spiritual Treasure. In an instant, the Dui Metal Sword Intent flooded his entire body.

That was the fatal blow.

'Does he... understand the principle behind it? Probably not. But this White Qilin has taken lives amid chaos and bloodshed since he was a child. He knows how to seize an opportunity. That opening flashed by for an instant, but he never forgot it.'

That strike of Wandering Metal had dramatically reversed their roles. Bitterness filled Qi Lanyan’s heart as he struggled to turn and face the figure to the south.

King Wei stood in the air, a spectral presence. Spiderweb cracks of colored light covered his upper body and face, and his eyes blazed. He pointed his long halberd diagonally toward the ground, his arm trembling.

He, too, was a spent arrow.

Though his dharma body was on the verge of collapse, his Life Divine Ability kept Qi Lanyan’s mind clear. He remained silent, disbelieving. Only now did a sliver of doubt enter his mind.

'He was hit by the Crystalline Wu Earth calamity from the Crystalline Jade Branch... and he can still fight...'

Qi Lanyan’s headless body stood alone above the lake. Nourished and empowered, the raging Dui Metal Sword Intent spread from his waist through the rest of his body. But the tenacious life force granted by his Horn Wood divine ability and his profound Dao-Profundity were still fighting back, desperately trying to stabilize his body.

The injury was terrifying, but as long as a flicker of his Horn Wood power remained, a few moments were all he needed to pull himself back from the brink of collapse.

But the Huai River Map descended, and the golden halberd, blazing bright, tore through the air toward him.

In the sky, Wang Ziya, who had been fighting with ease, was now at a disadvantage because of his earlier intervention. He couldn't disengage, and the Blade-Shifting Stone in his hand was saturated with multicolored light, rendering it useless.

He could only sigh. Ignoring the Sword Intent before him once more, he turned his gourd. But in the next instant, the unassuming Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch appeared in the sky.

Lin Chensheng’s eyes were filled with hatred and bloody tears. He had forced his way out of his own fight long ago, ignoring his injuries to cross the battlefield. He had taken several hits and had blood in his mouth, his face pale as paper. But he formed a hand sign, and the Supreme Yang Radiance descended, blocking Wang Ziya’s path.

His eyes, full of bloody tears, stared across the sky at Wang Ziya, making the old man tremble. He didn't know how to respond; he had lost even the will to speak.

As for the other northern cultivators, some were tied down by their opponents, while others simply looked away. Most, however, just watched in silence.

Qi Lanyan had controlled Jianghuai for years, stirring up trouble. Had he only harmed one faction’s interests?

He had made far too many enemies. Even the roiling Exiled Qi was sealing off any chance of escape. He had made a single miscalculation and fallen into this predicament. Even though he only needed a few breaths for his Horn Wood power to save him and restore his fighting ability, not a single person on Lake Xian was willing to lift a finger.

'Do I have regrets? Impossible. Is this a failure? Not entirely.'

The headless body stood quietly, unconcerned, even as the Sword Intent at his waist climbed unstoppably up his torso. His aura was shattered by a Bright Yang Spiritual Treasure, and before the descending halberd, his body was as fragile as a shard of porcelain. Finally, it shattered.

The phenomenon of Horn Wood erupted toward the heavens.

His flesh sloughed off his body piece by piece, exploding into fine beads in the air that sprouted buds and became mulberry and catalpa saplings, scattering across the lake. His bones leaped out one after another—the smaller bones became dark swallows, the larger ones, wild geese, all crying mournfully as they fell and stirred the waves.

From his shattered body, an intense and undeniable verdant wind burst forth, nourishing all things with its endless life. It rose and fell, a wind in the sky and a branch on the earth. It scattered across the two shores, where mulberry and elm trees sprouted, and among them, the faint figures of common people could be seen, making their homes.

'A divine ability has fallen!'

Only then did a wisp of Wu Earth light appear.

The Crystalline Jade Branch!

The ancient treasure flared brightly, snatching the soul and True Spirit from the dim light. Its misty radiance swirled elegantly before it settled into a hand as pale as white jade.

A man had appeared from thin air. He wore a white robe, and his black hair cascaded down his back like a waterfall. His handsome face was gentle and serene in the gloom, brightening the desolate night.

The Grand Preceptor of the Zhao State.

'Wei Xuanyin.'




# Chapter 1157: Withdrawal

A torrent of violet light surged from the horizon as the verdant wind swept across the heavens. Its pure essence coalesced into ethereal currents that veiled the sun and sky, while its turbid dregs churned into abyssal gales that scoured all illumination away. The entire surface of the lake was not only severed from the Great Void, but even visibility was reduced to near zero.

Yet everyone on the lake knew exactly how this verdant wind had been born.

"Qi Lanyan… has fallen!"

Even though Qi Lanyan’s demise had been orchestrated by the assembled cultivators, their original intent was merely to see him grievously wounded. Many had never truly believed he would fall.

'He was a disciple of Comprehending Profoundity, an heir to the Guanhua Dao Lineage, the de facto commander of all northern powers in Jianghuai... The Immortal Dao followed his commands, and even the Buddhist cultivators had to show him deference!'

A figure of his stature should have had countless trump cards. Even if cornered, a powerful backer should have appeared to save him.

'To die just like that, right here on the lake!'

Only when the verdant wind erupted into the sky, drawing every gaze, did the reality sink in. A mixture of disbelieving horror and grim satisfaction reverberated through the crowd like the tolling of a great bell, shattering the northern cultivators' defensive line in an instant.

The conflict between north and south had been constant since the founding of the Great Song. Lost territory and injuries were common, but the fall of a true divine ability master or a Maha was an exceedingly rare event. The last major loss had been the death of Vast Cicada.

Even then, the death of Vast Cicada was attributed to a Dharma Master's miscalculation and the schemes of preeminent figures. Apart from that, not a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, not a single Maha, had been lost.

But today was different.

The battle on Lake Xian had reached a fever pitch. Cultivators from both sides knew there was no room for retreat; every trump card was on the table. With the fighting having reached this point, disengagement was nearly impossible. Now that Qi Lanyan had truly fallen, the opportunity to withdraw had vanished entirely.

Myriad divine abilities bloomed across the sky, their colors flickering and fading within the raging verdant wind.

Yet at the heart of the storm, where Qi Lanyan had perished, there was an oasis of perfect calm, a space seemingly isolated from the world where no divine ability could penetrate. A Great Daoist Master stood there silently upon the water's surface, clad in white robes and holding the Crystalline Jade Branch.

With his arrival, the oppressive darkness of the night sky began to brighten. A brilliant sunset blazed into existence, only to sink swiftly below the horizon, accompanied by visions of collapsing golden towers and scattered imperial armies. A scene of crisp winds, white snow, and an otherworldly immortal forest enveloped the two men, drawing them into what felt like a realm of profound yin, filled with drifting, peaceful mist.

Wherever this newcomer passed, the Bright Yang scattered, its crimson light dissipating, leaving only the tranquil, unified radiance of Veiled Yin.

The Domain of Non-Duality.

As this strange light fell, the Celestial Gate shimmering behind Li Zhouwei began to dim. The young man, however, showed no sign of faltering. The kaleidoscopic cracks crawling across his face shifted and flowed as his eyes remained fixed on the Grand Preceptor of the Zhao State.

'So, this is Wei Xuanyin.'

The man was tall, with handsome, gentle features. He wore a silver robe that shimmered like the feathers of a bird, dotted with motes of light like fireflies. He stood upon a roiling mass of dark white clouds that took on the shape of beasts, one hand held behind his back, his bearing as ethereal as an immortal's.

Li Zhouwei, who stood facing him, was covered in the multicolored fissures left by the Crystalline Jade Branch. Forget escaping; a single wisp of Veiled Yin light would be enough for him to follow Qi Lanyan into death.

But despite his grievous injuries, the King of Wei remained poised in the air, a faint, knowing smile gracing his lips as he regarded the Great Daoist Master.

'He doesn't dare act. Not Wang Ziya, not Qi Lanyan, and not the man before me now, Wei Xuanyin. Willing or not, their hands are tied.'

Because of this, Li Zhouwei had the presence of mind to study this contemporary Great Daoist Master, this paragon of the Veiled Yin Dao who had reached the Purple Mansion Realm. Yet, as he looked, a flicker of doubt crossed his features.

It wasn't that the man was too strong, or too weak.

It was that he was utterly different.

Li Zhouwei had encountered Veiled Yin cultivators before. Zong Chang, whom he had fought in Wanling Heaven, was a classic example of a Veiled Yin demonic cultivator. Her divine abilities had been sharp and insidious, pressing down on him like a treacherous courtier bent on his utter ruin.

This man, however, exuded an air of transcendent grace that felt nothing like Veiled Yin. If not for the unmistakable signature of his Dao Lineage, Li Zhouwei might have mistaken him for a practitioner of Lesser Yin.

Zong Chang had possessed an art called the Chamber of Doubt, a wicked technique that fostered suspicion between ruler and subject to sow chaos from within. It was born of immense malice toward the Bright Yang Dao Lineage. Li Zhouwei sensed that the divine ability Wei Xuanyin now wielded shared the same origin as the Chamber of Doubt, yet it possessed a completely different character.

Both sought to dissolve the Bright Yang and dismantle imperial authority, but the seething hatred, the desire for total annihilation, was gone. In its place was a righteous conviction, one that sought to benefit its own Path without being beholden to imperial favor.

'This... this is the true Guanhua Dao Lineage!'

The swirling verdant wind cordoned them off from the outside world. The successor of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao wore a placid expression as he, too, studied Li Zhouwei. There was no grief or anger in his eyes. His grip on the Crystalline Jade Branch was perfectly steady as he waved a sleeve, collecting the various Spiritual Artifacts and Spiritual Treasures left behind. A glimmer of relief even surfaced in his gaze.

'Thank the heavens… For the sake of the Crystalline Jade Branch, the Yang family must give us face. And the powers that be held no particular dislike for Martial Nephew Qi. Otherwise, the moment the Exiled Qi descended, his soul would have been utterly annihilated!'

Wei Xuanyin had seen all of Qi Lanyan's actions.

'The reason for his death wasn't just Li Zhouwei… it can also be attributed to the Yang Clan. His actions truly infuriated them. Yang Ruiyi… or rather, the influential figures in the Underworld who have vested interests with the Yang Clan, had come to despise him.'

Someone had evidently been guarding the Hall of Profound Spirit-Cleansing, delaying Wang Ziya for more than ten exchanges. This had left Qi Lanyan to face a Dui Metal Sword Immortal—who was also a Great Daoist Master—and King Wei, Li Zhouwei, completely unprepared, resulting in the terrifying sword wound that ultimately claimed his life. At the same time, the Exiled Qi in the sky had grown unprecedentedly dense, cutting off all avenues of escape and even barring Wei Xuanyin himself from intervening.

Wei Xuanyin had received word the instant Wang Ziya made his move at Baiye Creek and had rushed from the capital, intending to oversee the situation personally.

But his status was different, and the timing was exceptionally sensitive. He had barely entered the Baihai Creek region when an emissary from the Underworld appeared to intercept him. Their words were polite, but their stance was unyielding. The battle at Lake Xian had spiraled beyond even his predictions—he never imagined his martial nephew would be so decisive, so resolute in pushing the situation to such an extreme.

That Qi Lanyan’s soul had survived at all was, in Wei Xuanyin's eyes, a stroke of immense fortune.

His handsome eyes swept over Li Zhouwei.

The man’s body roiled with multicolored light, the first signs of the Wu Light disaster already emerging. Yet his face was as placid as water, only the knuckles of the hand gripping his halberd were white. In Wei Xuanyin's perception, however, the aura radiating from Li Zhouwei was a pillar of power that pierced the heavens, something the shimmering lights could never conceal.

His gaze was complicated. After a long moment, he spoke.

"Greetings, King Wei."

Li Zhouwei’s expression was unruffled.

"I have long heard of your great name, Daoist friend."

Wei Xuanyin’s gaze faltered for an instant. He let out a long breath.

"My martial nephew's karmic debts are paid. Bright Yang has claimed his body, and with it, peace comes to Jianghuai. The accounts are settled."

The colored light in the young man's eyes wavered, spilling down his cheeks and tracing crack-like black marks that his flesh quickly healed. His voice was calm and cold as he replied,

"Only Bright Yang's debt is settled."

Wei Xuanyin's expression shifted. His gaze grew complex as he realized just how many people Qi Lanyan had offended. The image of the newly ascended Daoist Master with the treasure pouch flashed through his mind. After a brief silence, he said,

"In the karmic tides of this world, much is beyond our control. More often than not, it ends in mutual destruction. So it is for you and Lanyan today."

Li Zhouwei did not reply.

The vast aura of Veiled Yin lingered between heaven and earth. Wei Xuanyin gave him one last, profound look before his form dissolved into streams of white qi, scattering like smoke. All the otherworldly radiance receded with him, retreating northward like the tide.

Li Zhouwei had already retrieved an item from his sleeve.

It was the size of a finger, as round as a Golden Core, and shone in his palm like a miniature sun. It was the Pill of the Second Manifestation's Vast Yang.

After swallowing the pill, the tension in his face eased slightly, but the colored fissures remained, and the dense, kaleidoscopic light in his eyes did not fade.

His dharma body was in a state of chaos.

The physical damage from the Crystalline Jade Branch was secondary. The true danger was the torrent of green, purple, and yellow light surging within him, weaving through every limb and bone.

The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth!

These three lights were not a profound energy or a remnant of some technique; they were a calamity of an extremely high order. It manifested ceaselessly, filling him inside and out, bringing with it the peril of a trapped mind and a confounded spirit, the tribulation of having his own divine abilities pierced and scattered.

The moment it struck, Li Zhouwei had lost all sight and sense of direction. His vision dissolved into chaos, and his spiritual sense felt as though it had sunk into a murky pool, heavy and inert. Only the thrum of his Talisman Seed had shocked him back to awareness.

Even so, his spiritual sense was still pitifully weak, its connection to the world almost severed. His eyes were dark and sightless. In the preceding moments, he had been reduced to fighting by sound alone.

As for his dharma body, the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth had all but consumed it. The unique power of having his life-mandate anchored in his Purple Mansion Realm allowed him to just barely command his divine abilities and react. But it was a world of difference from his prior state. Qi Lanyan had been right: Li Zhouwei was a spent force. He had never suffered an injury this severe in his entire cultivation journey.

Compared to this, the physical agony—like being flayed by knives, scorched by fire, and drowned in water—was a trivial matter. But Li Zhouwei could feel it keenly: the calamity was still intensifying, grinding against the divine power he was recovering through his Perilous Tread technique.

'The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth… how vicious.'

As the colors of Veiled Yin abruptly withdrew, Li Zhouwei finally heard the howl of the wind. The roiling verdant wind still raged across the sky, obscuring sight. The chaotic clashes of divine abilities were gradually dying down, replaced by the faint sounds of shouting and slaughter.

'It seems some people… didn't manage to retreat.'

His expression remained unchanged. He took out several spiritual medicines and pills, consuming them all, but they had little effect. Raising a hand, he produced another.

This pill was a deep violet, wreathed in an aura of Supreme Yin. It was small and delicate compared to the others—the Hundred-Night Heart-Glimpsing Elixir, which Li Ximing had once obtained from a mystic realm that fell from Wanling Heaven.

Its purpose was to dispel illusions and clarify the spiritual sense.

The moment it passed his lips, it dissolved into a current of Supreme Yin and Pure Qi, flowing downward to suppress the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth.

The elixir was a product of a grotto-heaven, after all, and possessed the power of Supreme Yin. It finally caused the raging calamity within him to recede. The colors in Li Zhouwei's eyes faded a fraction, and his spiritual sense could once again extend three yards from his body. His connection to his divine abilities strengthened. Yet, he felt little joy.

The reason was simple: the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth was self-perpetuating and constantly growing stronger. The effects of the Hundred-Night Heart-Glimpsing Elixir were finite and would not last.

'But it's enough to clean up the mess.'

Though he still could not see, he possessed the Spirit Probe. With a mere thought, the entire panorama of the lake appeared in his mind's eye.

The Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch hovered in the sky, its light pinning down a colossal golden body. The figure had six arms and six legs, and its various golden artifacts were shattered. Its neck was a mass of weeping faces. The treasure of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition clearly had a unique power that prevented the creature from taking its own life to escape.

It was Nuzi, the lapdog of the Peacock from the Way of Great Desire.

Li Zhouwei's expression held steady as his focus shifted. The remaining divine abilities on the lake were now concentrated in another area.

Beneath the barrage of techniques stood a middle-aged man.

He had handsome features, appearing to be in his late thirties or early forties, with a high-bridged nose and deep-set eyes. His former dashing air was gone. Disheveled and bare-chested, his lower body was mangled, and the sword in his hand was snapped in two. Blood trickled from his lips, but his expression remained grim and unyielding.

'The Ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom.'

'Helian Wujiang.'

---

Eastern Sea.

Mist drifted over the waves as a white-bearded old Daoist flew north on a gourd, his expression desolate. He lifted a sleeve, revealing two clean, smooth gashes in his supposedly vajra-indestructible robe.

'Those Sword Immortals are certainly skilled.'

Though his words were complimentary, his spirit was clearly flagging. As he traveled, he saw the white-robed Great Daoist Master approaching on beast-like clouds of white qi. Wang Ziya cupped his hands in a gesture of regret and sighed.

"It was my failure."

Wei Xuanyin looked up and shook his head.

"Disciple-brother, you did all you could. If it had been Touba Qiye, Yangfeng would have been annihilated, body and soul, without a trace remaining."

Wang Ziya replied, "There is no need to spare my feelings, junior brother. I’ve spent my life as a priest in a grotto-heaven. I can preach the scriptures and discuss the Daoist arts well enough, but I am ill-suited for wielding Spiritual Treasures to harm others. It is a pity for our martial nephew. For the next century or two, he can only live out his days peacefully as a mortal."

Wei Xuanyin smiled faintly.

"Perhaps this is for the best. His karmic slate is wiped clean, his tribulations are passed."

The Great Daoist Master paused, then lowered his gaze.

"When he first entered the grotto-heaven, he was not chosen and was cast aside by his clan. He held a grudge ever since. He never had the temperament to achieve the Great Dao. Now that he has passed through this trial of life and death, it is the perfect time for him to return to the grotto-heaven to cultivate. In a way, his wish has been granted."

"My master left a favor for me and prepared a profound medicine. I must trouble you, disciple-brother, to retrieve it so that he may be reincarnated."

Wang Ziya was stunned.

"You… that is the only one of its kind in the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao," he said in disbelief. "Since Martial Uncle left it for you, how can you part with it? What will you do? Such things are treasures even on the mountain…"

Wei Xuanyin gave a deep bow, placing the Crystalline Jade Branch in the other man's hands.

"I no longer have a use for it. It will serve as compensation for him. I entrust this to you, disciple-brother."

Wang Ziya was speechless for a long time. Just as he was about to argue further, the Great Daoist Master before him smiled.

"This is a good thing. It fulfills his destiny, and it fulfills mine. With the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao having suffered such a grievous blow, we have the perfect excuse to withdraw from Jianghuai and cease our interference with Bright Yang. Martial Nephew Qi has already paid with his life… and since he died acting on the will of that personage, there is even less that can be said."

Understanding dawned on Wang Ziya. He stared at the Crystalline Jade Branch in his hand and murmured,

"You planned this all along?"

Wei Xuanyin shook his head, a strange complexity in his voice.

"Yes," he said softly, "but it happened far sooner than I had planned."

Wang Ziya continued to stare at him, finding it hard to believe. Long after the Grand Preceptor of Zhao had bowed and vanished over the horizon, the face of Qi Lanyan suddenly appeared in his mind. In that moment, he finally understood the true reason his martial nephew had been willing to sacrifice everything to oppose Bright Yang.

'Was it to pave the way for Disciple-brother Wei? Yes, and no.'

'The Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao's position in Jianghuai was likely intended to obstruct Bright Yang from the start. If that were to come to pass, someone from Guanhua would have to step forward as the obstruction. If it wasn't Qi Lanyan, it would have to be Wei Xuanyin.'

'Qi Lanyan acted with such desperation, such blatant malice toward Bright Yang, to ensure both the south and the north understood his intentions. His true goal wasn't to hinder Bright Yang or achieve some grand result. It was to prove he was the sharper, more willing blade—and in doing so, to shield Wei Xuanyin from that fate.'




# Chapter 1158: Reclaiming Fate

Divine abilities roiled.

One by one, Daoist Masters stood above Lake Xian as the Great Void shuddered, refusing to settle. The formless power that shielded the earth veins had already faded. The lake water had been evaporated completely, leaving a thick crust of salt frost at its bottom. The pale azure light of Horn Wood mingled with the verdant wind that blanketed the surface, transforming it into what looked like a vast, fertile plain.

Some of these divine abilities blazed with light while others were dim and pallid, a constellation of uneven stars suspended in the air. At their very center stood an old man with a golden-red blade slung across his back. His face was slightly pale, yet it bore the faint trace of a smile.

Situ Huo was brimming with triumph.

He had entered this great battle expecting to get the short end of the stick, even secretly preparing to throw in his lot with the north. But then Lingmei had stepped forward, meaning he no longer had to face Wang Ziya's treasure—the very bane of Metal Virtue!

His opponents were the Helian uncle-nephew duo, and one of them, Helian Wumeng, was still mending his physical form with blood qi, having only just recovered from a grievous wound.

Pitting Metal Malice against Demonic Malice, further bolstered by the light of Martial Cultivation, he tore through their defenses. When he saw Qi Lanyan fall and the tides of battle turn, a new ambition sparked within him. He began to see the Helian uncle and nephew as trophies for the taking—he, Situ Huo, was here to earn his destiny, and the more divine abilities he slew, the better.

It was his all-out, reckless interception of the newly recovered Helian Wumeng that forced the ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom, Helian Wujiang, to make a sacrificial turn. This mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master had abandoned his own fight to cover his nephew's retreat, sealing his own fate on this battlefield.

But for Situ Huo, this was just one joy piled upon another.

‘What’s one Helian Wumeng compared to this? The man is not only a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master, he’s the ruler of a kingdom! The Helian family founded the Tiefu Kingdom and once controlled all of Monan. They still hold considerable sway. Though he keeps a low profile, the rewards for taking him down would be immense!’

Everyone had been wounded in this battle. Li Zhouwei’s state went without saying. Daoist Master Wenqing had been ambushed by the retreating Zhelu, her dharma body all but shattered. Ning Wan had only survived by relying on the Great Snow's Severing Edge. The only one to emerge and reap the spoils of their conflict was him.

And with Li Zhouwei gravely injured, Situ Huo was the only cultivator of consequence at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. As the Military Commissioner of Tangdao, responsibility fell to him. The upcoming reconquest of Jianghuai would fall under his command. How could he not be ecstatic? The joy in his eyes was plain to see as he chuckled.

"My apologies, Daoist Helian."

The remark was dripping with sarcasm. Helian Wujiang lifted his head, his gaze piercing through the swirling spectrum of powers to scan the faces around him, as if to commit each one to memory. His lips trembled as he spoke, his voice low.

"Situ Huo!"

The cry was fierce and sharp, reverberating with venom through the assembled powers. The other cultivators remained silent. Situ Huo’s eyes gleamed as he retorted,

"There is no shame in your capture at my hands, Daoist. But you have failed to cultivate immortal virtue. You have killed without number, and your crimes are too numerous to list. When you stand before the emperor of my dynasty, you will answer for them!"

His words were masterful, simultaneously highlighting his own great deed and issuing a threat, all but praying for the man to drop dead right there and then. Helian Wujiang let out a sneer, his gaze mocking the Blood-Omen Tower in Situ Huo’s hand. In the end, he let it go, his voice taking on a haunting quality.

"Situ Huo, the path of Martial Cultivation is easy to grasp but difficult to release. Your lifespan dwindles, and the day you take refuge with the Buddhists draws near. Do you truly believe the Yang Clan is unprepared for that?"

At these words, some cultivators turned away in silence, while others couldn't suppress a cold smirk. Situ Huo’s expression remained unchanged as he smiled.

"My loyalty to the emperor is as clear as the heavens. I'll not be swayed by the provocations of a dead man walking!"

The old man appeared calm, but the white-knuckled grip on his blade betrayed the fury in his heart. The smile on his face grew colder, but then he stiffened and whipped his head around.

At some point, a sword immortal in white had appeared beside the golden body held fast by the Supreme Yang radiance. His sword-sharp eyes were glacial. Beside him, Lin Chensheng’s eyes were tinged with red as he stood in attendance with the deference of a disciple.

Maha Nuzi’s face was a mask of terror.

"I am a trusted agent of the Peacock," he stammered. "Sword Immortal, spare my life, and the Way of Great Desire will reward you handsomely!"

His plea seemed to make the very heavens tremble. The sword immortal let out a furious laugh, and the Pear Blossom Sword in his hand hummed to life.

Heaven and earth turned white.

A razor-sharp wave of Dui Metal Qi sliced through the verdant wind, causing the golden body to shudder violently. The sword immortal's figure dissipated like smoke. Before Maha Nuzi could even utter a cry of pain, a surge of pink light and a cascade of sand and rock plummeted into the lake below.

Maha Nuzi of the Way of Great Desire had fallen.

None of the masters in the sky paid his death any mind, yet no one moved. Even Situ Huo waited in silence, watching as Sima Yuanli descended on the wind from amidst the maelstrom of dust and light. He stopped beside the young man at the lake's center and spoke with tentative reverence.

"The northern cultivators are broken. We await your command to deploy our forces, King Wei."

"Crack."

As Li Zhouwei moved, flakes of multicolored light fell from his body like cracking porcelain. He turned his head. That face, covered in a web of colorful fractures, swiveled toward Sima Yuanli, the iridescent light in his eyes blazing fiercely. Daoist Master Qinghu felt a chill creep into his heart as he raised his gaze, only to see the young man beside him suddenly stir.

He trod upon the Heavenly Light, walking step by step toward the horizon. Streaks of multicolored light trailed from his body like teardrops, drawing the shocked and bewildered gazes of all present.

Helian Wujiang snapped his head up as he heard a hoarse voice.

"I will grant you a swift end."

The words echoed as the long halberd spun back, descending with a crash under the watch of countless eyes.

‘He… can still attack!’

Helian Wujiang was utterly spent, having just endured a brutal siege. Yet he possessed both a Body Divine Ability and a Life Divine Ability. Short of the Yang Clan producing a treasure on par with the Crystalline Jade Branch, no matter how he was suppressed, he could always take his own life in an instant. Capturing him alive was a near-impossible task.

Forcing him to surrender was even more out of the question.

Unlike the unattached Buddhist and rogue cultivators, or the Touba and Murong clans who had powerful backers and the possibility of a prisoner exchange, Helian Wujiang was the paramount warrior of the Tiefu Kingdom. If he surrendered, the fate awaiting the entire Tiefu Xiongnu and the escaped Helian Wumeng was easy to imagine.

‘He chose to stay behind. He was already prepared to die.’

In that instant, every gaze converged on him. Even Helian Wujiang, his face grim beneath the roiling divine abilities, looked up. He understood that Li Zhouwei was offering him a final measure of dignity. He exhaled a long breath and met his fate.

His lips trembled. This was the man who had dominated Monan for a century, who had deftly guided the Helian family through crisis and revival, yet now he found he had no one to whom he could entrust his final words. Ultimately, he remained silent.

"BOOM!"

As the assembled masters held their breath, his Shengyang Acupoint imploded. His entire body erupted into a torrent of demonic light. A thick pillar of Baleful Qi shot skyward, blasting away all the divine abilities pressing down on it and painting the heavens with a vista of mountains and rivers made from the ink of Baleful Qi.

The Horn Wood divine ability had filled the sky for a mere dozen breaths before the Baleful Qi surged, overwhelming the verdant wind. On the same day, a second mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master had fallen.

"DONG!"

The sky turned a viscous, ink-green. Cold drops of baleful rain began to fall. A darkness so profound you couldn't see your own hand swept across the firmament, leaving the divine radiances of the masters standing like lonely sentinels.

Helian Wujiang had no real feud with the southern cultivators. In past conflicts, he had practiced restraint, taking care not to offend any single power. Now, in the silence, there was a certain sorrow for a fallen peer.

Situ Huo's face darkened. He lowered his eyes, saying nothing, seemingly lost in thought. Sima Yuanli quietly watched the cold rain, but he noticed that the King of Wei remained standing in mid-air, his back ramrod straight, showing no sign of retreat.

‘What else is he planning to do?’

The King of Wei crossed the celestial darkness, treading upon the light to land by the lakeshore. His voice was hoarse, but his words were steady and strong.

"Tinglan, Fangjing, Qinghu."

At his call, three figures stepped forward. Lin Chensheng acknowledged the order as the King of Wei continued,

"With Lake Xian conquered, the Jianghuai region is ours for the taking. You three will take the Holder of the Profound with you to Baiye Creek. Surround the mountain gate, but do not attack immediately. Drive off their divine abilities, then proceed to the White River to rescue the Moongaze forces and reinforce the Tangdao garrison."

"Yes."

The cultivators acknowledged. A smile touched Situ Huo's lips, but his expression froze as Li Zhouwei’s steady voice rang out again.

"Situ Huo and Cheng Jiuwen, you two…"

The young man paused, a cold smile forming on his lips.

"You will follow me to conquer Xuanmiao Temple and advance along the Baihai Creek."

A wave of shock rippled through the crowd.

‘For an ordinary cultivator struck by the Crystalline Jade Branch, it's a miracle to survive. They would be forced into seclusion for decades, and many perish unexpectedly in seclusion. He… he dares to press north while so gravely injured!’

Every cultivator's expression changed. Situ Huo was stunned into silence. But the pair of iridescent eyes stared straight at him, forcing him to swallow his words of disbelief.

"This subordinate obeys!"

A flicker of doubt had already been in his heart, and now, understanding dawned.

‘So… so he’s also trying to amass his own share of destiny! That’s why he’s insisting on heading north despite his wounds!’

Poised and unhurried, Li Zhouwei strode onto the Heavenly Light and headed north. The dark Crimson Severing Arrowhead flickered, shielding him from all sight. Only then did he discreetly swallow the blood that had risen in his throat, his complexion improving slightly.

His ability to endure this long was thanks to a great contributor—the Crimson Severing Arrowhead.

This ability to defer a tenth of his injuries proved equally effective against this tribulation, which meant the actual burden on his body was less than ninety percent. This Bright Yang divine ability was unexpectedly immune to Wu Earth. Just moments ago, while riding the arrowhead, he had slipped past the sweeping Wu Light that had pinned all the other divine abilities to the lake, causing Qi Lanyan’s plan to fail.

He keenly sensed the anomaly in this.

‘It is said that Wu Light is inescapable, that few can evade it and even fewer can suppress it. This miraculous power, which no one has ever spoken of… it could prove decisive in future battles!’

But now was not the time for such considerations. Feeling the success of the Sovereign's Perilous Tread and the feedback of dharma power from his Talisman Qi, Li Zhouwei made a quick calculation.

‘Three days!’

He had spent most of the battle fighting alone, so the resonance he felt from the White Qilin's destiny was faint, and the feedback from his technique was correspondingly weak. The greater aid came from the dharma power his Talisman Qi had absorbed by breaking through divine abilities and defeating his foes.

This power, working in concert with potent medicinal pills, was holding back the escalating tribulation within him and allowing his condition to stabilize. But within three days, both forces would be depleted. If he didn't enter seclusion to suppress the tribulation by then, he would be in grave danger.

‘Three days… to pacify the Jianghuai region.’

The multicolored light in his eyes was grim, but held no fear.

‘With Qi Lanyan dead, their control over Jianghuai is bound to collapse. The way forward is clear. Besides…’

The image of a purple talisman flashed in his mind. He raised an eyebrow, gazing into the distance.

‘The northern cultivators are not united. Defeated, they will scatter. And since Yehui was willing to conspire, there are surely other gains to be made!’

…

Moongaze Lake.

The colors in the sky had receded, vanishing over the northern horizon. Li Ximing shook his head, feeling a wave of dizziness. He coughed up a spray of golden blood that erupted into embers and vanished.

He looked up toward the east in shock. An intense shade of bruised-black stained the sky, a dreadful omen that filled him with alarm.

‘What is this?’

The distance between Lake Xian and Moongaze Lake spanned the entire Song State. To see such a cataclysmic sign so clearly, more than one Purple Mansion expert must have fallen.

‘Minghuang knows his limits. Qi Lanyan would not have dared to harm him…’

He had no time to ponder it further. To the west, the enemy forces were finally in retreat, their banners fading from view. He felt a sliver of relief.

"The assault from Western Shu was ferocious."

Li Zhouwei had correctly predicted a major battle at Moongaze Lake. But his departure had shifted the entire focus of the north-south conflict, and Qing Jifeng was making his move. The main invading force had unexpectedly been from Western Shu. Of the reinforcements he had expected, only Chen Yin had arrived to defend the river.

Li Muyan and Hongyan had arrived as planned, but one was still recovering from grave injuries, while the other's hands were tied; neither was a significant factor. But among the ominous clouds, there had been another.

His name was Shen Sou, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who possessed profound divine abilities.

Against the three of them, Li Ximing’s life had hung by a thread. If not for the Heavenly Nurture Urn holding them in check, he would have been grievously wounded, if not killed, long before they reached the Western Mountains.

Now, with the western forces suddenly withdrawing, he was injured but alive. Yet he felt not an ounce of relief.

‘Jiangqian is still guarding the river.’

Even if the north's focus was no longer on the west, the guardians they left at the White River would be formidable. Moreover, with Baiye Creek lost and the Tangdao garrison surrounded, the Mahas of the Way of Great Desire could march unopposed.

Li Jiangqian was stationed on the riverbank, from where he could watch the opposite shore. Before the battle started, Shilou Yingge and Gao Fangjing had been at Baijiang Creek, not to mention several of the Merciful Ones…

‘Shilou Yingge might not be willing to fight hard for Qi Lanyan, but the Way of Great Desire harbors ambitions. If they send someone south, their target would undoubtedly be Jiangqian!’

The fact that Li Jiangqian had not yet activated his distress talisman offered a small measure of comfort. With no time to waste, Li Ximing shot through the air, secretly activating an art.

[Spirit Probe]!

He had just left the Western Mountains, but already the scene at the churning river materialized in his mind's eye. The image that returned, however, sent a jolt through his heart.

The river surged, and divine abilities clashed overhead. A storm of Li Fire raged with abandon. There was no sign of Shilou Yingge or Gao Fangjing, nor any other northern reinforcements. The Way of Great Desire had not even sent a Maha. There were only two Merciful Ones, struggling desperately beneath the flames, pinned down and unable to advance or retreat.

The knot of anxiety in his chest finally loosened, only to be replaced by a wave of confusion. He rode the Heavenly Light, arriving at the northern bank in moments. Wary of an ambush, he stopped and cast his gaze further north, toward the White River.

Indeed, he saw blazing True Fire and the golden body of a Maha.

But far more eye-catching were the dozens of divine abilities flashing across the sky. A brilliant golden qi filled the heavens, and within it stood several Daoist Masters clad in gold. They stood firm against the searing heat of the True Fire, pressing the two masters of 'True Fire' at the center so hard they couldn't even raise their heads.

‘The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition!’

Everything clicked into place. In a flash of insight, Li Ximing understood.

‘It’s the Golden Feather Sect… They must have launched their northern assault long ago and already pushed into the Jianghuai region!’




# Chapter 1159: Taming the Tiger

A jolt went through Li Ximing. He swallowed a medicinal pill, and the joy in his heart quickly subsided as he rose upon the wind. He raised the wood-grained Spiritual Urn high, peered into its depths for a moment, and unleashed its divine ability.

Store and Combine.

In an instant, heavy layers of multicolored light poured from the urn, falling upon the two golden-bodied figures. Like a great whale drawing in the sea, it cared not for brilliant light, golden water, blessings from the Buddhist Land, or empowerment from the Daoist Tradition—it drained them all without a trace!

The two Merciful Ones, caught in the roiling Li Fire, were in utter agony. How could they withstand the divine power of such a Spiritual Treasure? Their expressions changed in unison.

‘Li Ximing is here!’

They didn’t even have time to exchange a glance. They immediately circulated their divine abilities, abandoning their protective light in a desperate attempt to return to the Buddhist Land!

To be fair, their skills were not lacking. One served beneath the Lotus Seat, while the other held the Seat of Developing Wisdom. Together, they could have held their own against most cultivators with a single divine ability. Even with reinforcements arriving, they should have had a chance to escape.

But they were no match for Li Jiangqian, who was protected by a Spiritual Treasure. The Southern Brightness Heart-Fire was simply too formidable!

This flame was a unique form of Li Fire whose power varied according to the user’s life-mandate. When first condensed, its might already surpassed Li Ximing’s Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame. After being further empowered by Talisman Qi, its strength had doubled. Only the exceedingly rare Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire in Li Ximing's possession could definitively suppress it.

This flame resonated with Li Jiangqian's own Li Fire ability, moving with his thoughts. It didn’t just burn in one spot. To make matters worse, the Merciful Ones’ weapons were of poor quality. After dozens of exchanges, their hands were slick with molten gold.

Forced to fight bare-handed for the remainder of the battle, they were left dizzy and disoriented by the heat.

In stark contrast to their humiliating struggle, Li Jiangqian grew more comfortable with every move. His eyes shone brightly as he nodded to himself in satisfaction.

It was, frankly, an embarrassing memory. Just after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, his first opponent had been Touba Ci, a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator and a dignified imperial descendant of the Great Liang. His ambition had been crushed, beaten so soundly he couldn't even retaliate. If Li Zhouwei hadn’t arrived in time, he would have been grievously wounded within a few rounds, leaving him with a bitter sense of failure.

But fighting these two, he finally understood the kind of opponent a cultivator of his level was meant to face. The feeling was exhilarating. The longer he fought, the more seamlessly he integrated his skills, his attacks growing ever more relentless.

‘Now _this_ is more like it!’

Seeing the two about to self-destruct to escape, Li Jiangqian reacted in a flash. The Li Fire Spiritual Treasure he had kept ready in the Great Void descended abruptly. Countless golden threads erupted from it, ignoring the Merciful One from the Lotus Seat and wrapping entirely around the one from the Seat of Developing Wisdom.

Li Ximing understood instantly. He circulated his divine ability, forming a hand seal and chanting an incantation.

“By my command!”

The Light of the Six Harmonies from his World’s Radiance ability cut across the Great Void and descended in an instant. The divine power to confine and dispel evil activated, causing the Merciful One to choke as his inner power seized up and dissipated.

In that brief moment, his companion exploded beside him.

But the resulting cloud of pink light offered no aid; it was immediately smothered by an impossibly thick layer of Li-Light. The vast power of Store and Combine constricted around him, snaring the Merciful One and leaving him no chance of escape.

Then, the bright white Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire poured down from above. The Merciful One let out a horrifying shriek, but he was pinned by the other Li Fire Spiritual Treasure, unable to move. Helpless as a small boat on a stormy sea, he was drawn into the urn.

“Grand-uncle… what an incredible ability!”

Li Jiangqian immediately rode a wave of Li Fire to draw closer. Li Ximing had aggravated his injuries again, and his face was a shade paler. After he coughed twice, the boyish attendant spirit appeared, taking the Spiritual Treasure from his master’s hand to suppress its power. Only then did Li Ximing manage a smile.

“It’s this Heavenly Nurture Urn that’s so powerful. Against Buddhist cultivators… especially these ones with little real substance… it truly strikes at their weakest point.”

Li Jiangqian finally noticed his grand-uncle’s condition.

“How are you?” he asked in a low voice.

Li Ximing waved a dismissive hand and briefly explained the situation to the west, but his gaze, fixed on the riverbank, was filled with dread. The clash of gold and fire was growing more intense by the second.

“Where is the venerable Daoist Master Chen?”

Li Jiangqian hesitated for a moment.

“He crossed the river.”

“He crossed the river!”

Li Ximing stared at the utter chaos unfolding on the White River.

“He shouldn’t have gotten involved!” he said under his breath.

Li Jiangqian silently shook his head.

“The Golden Feather cultivators didn’t arrive that early. Senior Chen Yin was in a fierce battle with Shilou Yingge and was already wounded when the chaos erupted behind them. The old senior didn’t know it was the Golden Feather Sect; he thought it was Liu Bai’s group retreating south from Tangdao Mountain. He told me to guard the bank while he went across to provide support.”

Li Ximing was stunned for a moment.

“Such courage,” he couldn’t help but remark.

Li Jiangqian just shook his head noncommittally, saying no more. As they watched with growing concern, the golden light to the north gained a decisive advantage. An intense chill swept through the air, causing countless shards of ice to form on the great river’s surface.

Just then, a streak of azure light shot across the Great Void, staggering to a stop before them. Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin, materialized. Li Ximing coughed again and stepped forward.

“Venerable senior… are you alright?”

The old man had a sword on his back. His face was grim, his aura severe, and blood stained his lips. His gaze softened only when it fell on Li Ximing.

“I’m fine…”

Even as he spoke, he coughed up more blood, which transformed into rolling flames and dissipated in mid-air. His Water Mansion arts were a match for True Fire, but his Dao-Profundity was clearly inferior to Shilou Yingge’s. All he said was,

“The Golden Feather cultivators are holding them back…”

Li Ximing’s heart settled somewhat. He saw Chen Yin pause, his expression growing complex as he looked at him.

“I saw several Daoist Masters from the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition,” he said hesitantly. “Among them was a Daoist Master Tianhuo. He asked me to relay a message to Zhaojing.”

“Please, speak.”

Surprise flickered across Li Ximing’s pale face as he turned to listen. Chen Yin’s voice was deep.

“He said… the favor from years ago… I repay it today to my friend, Daoist Master Zhaojing.”

---

Xuanmiao Temple.

Black clouds hung heavy over the mountains. Cold, dense raindrops pattered against the eaves. Disciples huddled together between the palace halls, shoving one another as they stared in dismay at the churning black-green miasma to the south.

“Something terrible has happened… out on the lake…”

“Where is everyone? Where are the elders?”

A great master had descended the mountain not long ago to pacify the region. The disciples had faith in the northern cultivators’ forces, but the celestial phenomena were too bizarre to ignore. They gathered and went to find Qi Lanyan’s disciple, but he was nowhere to be found.

“Where else could he have gone?”

“Who knows?”

The rain intensified, driven by the wind into the grand hall. It slicked the vermilion wooden beams with a cold sheen. The disciples looked up, and through the gloom, they finally saw it—a speck of white.

The next moment, that point of white had already streaked across the sky, radiating a brilliant Heavenly Light. It was the immense, domineering form of the Celestial Gate.

In an instant, the entire Xuanmiao Temple erupted into chaos. Despite the protection of the grand formation, the disciples felt as if they’d been pounced on by a starving tiger. They fell like scythed wheat, stumbling into one another and collapsing to the ground. An eerie silence fell, broken only by the chattering of teeth and the rustle of robes.

But the stream of light shot past without a second glance, continuing its northward flight until it vanished into the clouds. Only then did a burst of radiance explode, and a golden figure emerged from the Great Void, filling the air with a purple aura.

The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master from the White Ye Immortal Sect appeared, his voice booming.

“Greetings, King Wei! Yehui has come as promised!”

“Bai Ziyu!”

A voice like thunder, imbued with Buddhist might, rolled through the air. The golden figure in the sky condensed, revealing a Majestic Jeweled Visage. He wore a kasaya and held a jade pestle, and behind him, a vision of a great lotus bloomed and faded. It was Mingxiang of the Lotus Temple.

Yet he was a wretched sight. His jade-like face was a mask of humiliation. Though his kasaya glowed brightly, countless fine cracks spiderwebbed beneath the surface.

His voice was laced with disbelief and fury.

“After the defeat at Lake Xian, you dare to rebel so soon!”

The thunderous accusation seemed to kill the last glimmer of hope. The sky dimmed, the earth trembled, and from the ground, purple-black royal banners rose. Countless streams of light shot across the lake.

“The Song army is here!”

"Boom!"

Silver lightning erupted across the sky, filling the night with tens of thousands of electric lances that illuminated the mountains. Nearly half the candles in the great hall flickered out. The ancestral portraits hanging at the head of the hall swayed violently in the wind, their faces shifting in the flickering light, appearing grotesque and terrifying.

“Where is Lord Qi?” a trembling voice cried out from the mountainside. Before anyone could answer, a rain of multicolored light fell before the formation, accompanied by a wave of cheers. A man’s heroic voice echoed through the night:

“Qi Lanyan has been executed by King Wei! The Zhao army is defeated! Open the formation at once and welcome the king’s forces!”

"Boom!"

Silver lightning crawled across the heavens, illuminating the face of the man high above and making the colorful cracks on his skin appear even deeper. Li Zhouwei’s gaze swept past the Buddhist light entangled with purple water and fixed on a point beyond it.

Another stream of pink Buddhist light was tumbling within the purple torrent, struggling against a heavy, oppressive peak. It had finally broken free from Yehui’s divine ability.

It was Maha Zhelu of the Liangli rank, from the Way of Emptiness.

This Maha had been wounded by Li Zhouwei on the lake, but he had never imagined that Qi Lanyan would fall. He had immediately turned to launch a sneak attack on Wenqing of the Purple Smoke Gate. By the time the situation had turned, he was already retreating, only to be intercepted at Xuanmiao Temple by Yehui, along with Mingxiang.

Though Yehui often concealed his true strength, his divine abilities and Dao-Profundity were not to be underestimated. The three divine abilities of his Capital Guard Dao Lineage all possessed suppressive power, and his Western Heaven Plateau ability could sever the flow of spiritual energy and seal the Great Void. Having come with clear intent, blocking two wounded opponents for a short time should have been simple.

However, the Capital Guard arts were notoriously vulnerable to purification by brilliant light. Though Mingxiang’s Enlightened Artifact was shattered, his personal strength was largely intact. His desperate struggle tied up most of Yehui’s attention, allowing Zhelu to slip free.

“You have some nerve!”

Situ Huo, who had been stewing with regret over his stolen glory, saw his chance. His eyes lit up, the pattern of the Monarch’s Lost Sheep on his weapon flared, and he lunged with his golden-red saber to intercept the fleeing Maha.

In contrast, Cheng Jiuwen remained perfectly calm, standing quietly behind the Celestial Gate. He only occasionally glanced toward the northwest, his face etched with worry.

Li Zhouwei seemed to sense it. His eyes, swirling with color, shifted, but he did not move to stop the escape.

His condition had improved, but facing Zhelu now would be a severe strain. A Liangli-rank Maha fighting for his life, one who might even abandon his physical form to escape, was no less dangerous than one at full strength.

Instead, his gaze swept through the heavy purple qi and settled on Mingxiang.

The Maha from Lotus Temple was locked in a fierce struggle with Yehui. When he saw Li Zhouwei looking at him, his eyes flickered. Yehui, riding the purple torrent, glanced at Li Zhouwei and then toward the distant black-green miasma.

“King Wei!” he called out in a low voice.

A seed of doubt sprouted in Li Zhouwei’s mind.

‘Mingxiang is supposed to be guarding Shanji. The northern cultivators must have others stationed there as well… But Yang Ruiyi came here in person. Under the cover of his Exiled Qi, there’s no way Mingxiang could have escaped so easily!’

An image flashed in his mind: the Underworld Treasure Hall that had held off Wang Ziya for over a dozen exchanges at Lake Xian. He extended his spiritual sense with Spirit Probe, directing it toward the western region of Baiye.

He saw only a vast, tranquil expanse of Exiled Qi. There were no signs of a battle.

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouwei.

‘Shanji is protected by a sophisticated formation laid by the north; it’s a hard target to crack. Yang Ruiyi made a feint, merely trapping them with Exiled Qi while he interfered at Lake Xian. Once he saw the situation was stable, he immediately bypassed Shanji and entered Jianghuai to seize Baiye first!’

It was undoubtedly the correct strategic move. Shanji was a tough nut, but the Jianghuai region across the river was a ripe prize. With Guanhua gone, every major power coveted it. The Western Shu forces might have already pushed to the White River by now. If Yang Ruiyi had gotten bogged down at Shanji, he would have been ceding territory across the river.

With Xuanmiao Temple lost, Shanji was isolated and helpless—a fish on the chopping block. Just as Li Zhouwei had ordered his forces to bypass the White Ye Immortal Sect’s headquarters, Yang Ruiyi had bypassed Shanji to claim the lands on the other side.

‘And by doing so, he can also rally the forces I sent—Lin Chensheng and the others—to reinforce Tangdao Mountain.’

The Way of Great Desire would surely know of their crushing defeat at Lake Xian. With Jianghuai now masterless, the Baihai forces would have regrouped. Tian Langzhi would certainly join forces with Mount Dayang to press the attack on Tangdao Mountain and seize that critical bridgehead—and Yang Ruiyi would be there to contest it.

In an instant, Li Zhouwei had deduced the strategies of both the Yang Clan and the Way of Great Desire.

‘One move, with three more in mind. Jianghuai is already theirs for the taking. The Song state needs to hold it as a future springboard to the north, the final piece to control the entire region. The Western Shu need the White River and Tangdao Mountain to gain a foothold in Jianghuai. And Mount Dayang and the Seven Aspects need to reclaim their losses by taking that same fortress to control the region.’

‘The next great battle will be fought on Tangdao Mountain, the most important peak in all of Jianghuai.’

He had received word that Li Ximing was safe, and now his strategic thinking was clear. It was, at last, a piece of genuinely good news. With three major powers vying for control of Tangdao Mountain in the west, the remnants of the Baihai forces, the intercepted cultivators, and the Buddhist monks would have no capacity to resist him here.

The King of Wei retracted his Spirit Probe. With a final, faint glance, his figure soared into the air. He shot past Xuanmiao Temple, continuing north without pause, leaving only a fading whisper in the air:

“General Situ, I leave this place to you!”

Situ Huo couldn’t have been happier. He let out a hearty laugh and immediately accepted the command. A thick golden qi billowed up, sealing the sky.

The Heavenly Light streaked northward, crossing vast tracts of land until a new scene leaped into view.

A colossal demonic figure stood between heaven and earth. A long halberd radiating Profound Qi swept across the sky, crashing down upon a towering golden peak. There, a man in white robes, as small as an ant, calmly held a treasured saber.

Daoist Master Changyun had managed to intercept Touba Ci here.

But under the golden radiance, another Spiritual Treasure hovered in the air—an ivory-white ceremonial tablet, no longer than a hand. It cast a halo of light that seemed to shatter a celestial dam. A torrent of power emerged from the Great Void, a rolling wave of white qi flowing from north to south, isolating the space and blocking several other attacks.

Within that white qi stood a young man in a fluttering black robe, holding a spear. A vertical line was slowly forming on his brow. His spear was sharp, but he was at a disadvantage, suppressed by a Maha who had leaped from the streams of light.

At that moment, the Heavenly Light brightened. The Buddhist cultivators looked up to see the Celestial Gate descending as the sky darkened. The Maha’s head snapped up. Though his power was faint, undisguised hatred blazed in his eyes.

‘He’s here!’

This Maha was none other than Bashan.

He was a longtime confidant of Maha Nuzi and a talent born with immense strength. The Way of Great Desire had been reluctant to let him join the battle at Lake Xian, using an excuse to keep him in the rear, but Qi Lanyan had summoned him anyway. When the battle turned, Bashan was one of the first ordered to retreat. However, Daoist Master Changyun, intimately familiar with the northern forces’ deployment, had specifically intercepted and trapped him here.

Bashan had risen from an Arhat under Nuzi to the rank of Maha. His debt of gratitude to Nuzi was as heavy as a mountain. To him, the Way of Great Desire and the Buddhist Land were one. Though he had escaped and didn’t know the final details of what happened at the lake, he had learned of Nuzi’s fall.

Though a Buddhist, he was a man who remembered his debts. The hatred in his heart boiled over. Seeing the King of Wei cutting a path of destruction straight to him, he naturally pinned all his enmity on the king's head, his eyes nearly splitting with rage.

The Heavenly Light that had shielded the scene dissipated. Bashan froze for a second, stunned.

‘He’s grievously wounded and hasn’t recovered, yet he chased me all the way here. Could this be my chance for revenge?’

That was the power of the Crystalline Jade Branch!

Bashan was almost certain that the king’s divine abilities were just a bluff.

The next moment, he abandoned the man in black and strode across the Great Void. A mountain-like golden palm descended toward Li Zhouwei. Ignoring his own depleted body, he pushed his divine abilities and dharma power to their absolute limit, burning them as fuel for a raging golden fire.

To his utter delight, the young king only seemed to notice him when he was just a few dozen feet away, finally turning his head to look.

‘He’s been struck by a deep and terrible calamity!’

He was ecstatic. Li Zhouwei, however, remained impassive. The long halberd in his hand twitched, and the corner of his mouth curved into a slight smile.

‘I made it in time…’

Just as the golden palm was about to land, the darkness in the sky receded. The King of Wei simply vanished. The smile on Bashan’s face froze. A black boot materialized from the void and kicked squarely on the back of his massive golden head.

"Boom!"

The giant golden body hung in the air for a moment before plummeting to the earth like a meteor. He had barely stabilized himself when the mountains and rivers condensed from a Bright Yang Spiritual Treasure descended upon him. Pitch-black darkness once again crawled across the sky as a setting sun blazed to life.

Emperor Qi’s Light!

This Dharma Art, enhanced by numerous empowerments, had long ago surpassed its original limits. Even cast casually, its power was immense. Now, resonating with the Crimson Severing Arrowhead and Li Zhouwei’s own injuries, it had reached a new height.

A thick pillar of black-gold light descended from the heavens and struck Bashan, causing splashes of molten gold to fly from his body. He let out an earth-shattering roar.

“AOOOH!”

The young man stood coldly in the sky, the colorful cracks on his face flickering. Though he looked as if his body might shatter at any moment, his tone was calm, stating a simple fact.

“If I hadn’t needed to use your accumulated power that day, did you think a clown like you could have ever touched this king?”

The golden body below erupted in a wretched howl, but the King of Wei remained unmoved, his icy gaze filled with scorn. The stream of black-gold light in the sky intensified, and the screams of the Way of Great Desire’s rising star echoed across the heavens.

This only deepened his smile.

Two full breaths passed. The King of Wei’s ear twitched. His cracked face snapped around. The golden qi was vibrating violently as a huge, ferocious tiger leaped out. Its divine power was weak, but its savage aura remained undiminished.

At the same moment, Bashan, bathed in light, played his final card. Burning his divine abilities to their very dregs as the price for one last strike, he sacrificed his own life-mandate and lunged straight for Li Zhouwei.

But what greeted him was the dazzling Celestial Gate descending from above.

The sarcasm in Li Zhouwei’s eyes faded, replaced by a genuine smile.

“You finally came out.”

The mark on his brow glowed. He shifted to the side, and a large hand reached deep into the Great Void. As easily as pulling an object from a bag, he grabbed the black tiger by the scruff of its neck, halting its attack cold. With his other hand, he swung his black halberd level, and the flat of the weapon smashed into the tiger’s head.

Li Zhouwei was gravely injured, yes, but how much better could this man and beast possibly be after fleeing all the way from the lake?

"Crack!"

The tiger’s glazed, jewel-like eyes instantly shattered, blown apart by the force of the blow. A mournful cry escaped its throat, a sickening mixture of shattering teeth and cracking bone that echoed across the sky.

Li Zhouwei’s figure vanished.

Bashan’s eyes widened as a vertical sliver of golden light grew rapidly before him. The edge of the long halberd descended in silence and touched his face.

Splitting Light!

His sturdy head shattered before the Radiant Sun King’s Halberd. Next came the powerful dharma body he had spent centuries cultivating, along with its countless flashing, profound runes. Before the might of the Bright Yang, it was all crushed bit by bit, leaving not a single trace.

He was annihilated on the spot.

"Boom!"

A blinding golden light shot skyward, so intense it seemed to scorch the man’s black robes. But he simply brought two fingers together and casually wiped the blood from his halberd’s edge. He strolled through the storm of flying sand, lifted the limp, barely breathing black tiger, and fixed it with a gaze as cold as ten-thousand-year-old ice.

Golden tiger blood streamed down his arm, covering the colorful cracks in his skin. Every gaze that swept over him immediately retracted. Even Touba Ci, high in the sky, discreetly looked away, his heart pounding with shock.

‘That’s the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth… Even a Great Daoist Master who took that head-on would have to retreat and recuperate…’

‘He just killed Qi Lanyan while under the effects of the Crystalline Jade Branch… a proper disciple of Guanhua… How is he… acting as if nothing happened? He chased him for a thousand li and killed another Maha from the Way of Great Desire!’

‘This is what being afflicted by a calamity looks like? This is a body on the verge of collapse? He looks wounded, certainly, but it seems as if…’

The descendant of a True Monarch, a prince of the Great Liang’s imperial clan, looked on in a daze. He wasn’t sure if it was just his imagination, but a startling thought flashed through his mind:

‘His divine abilities have grown broader.’




# Chapter 1160: The Azure Step

A knot of doubt tightened in Touba Ci’s chest, but the flow of Profound Qi from his hands never wavered. He looked at Daoist Master Changyun, who stood holding a treasure saber, and exhaled slowly.

“Daoist Master Zhang,” he asked, “both you and I are scions of True Monarchs. There's no need for this. Why press me so relentlessly?”

A flicker of apprehension showed in his eyes.

Zhang Yun’s divine abilities and Dao-Profundity were considerable among those at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, making him a match for Touba Ci. Furthermore, Touba Ci’s Dao Lineage of Profound Qi was unpredictable by nature; he could hold his own against anyone for a time, so escaping should not have been difficult.

The problem was this Zhang Yun… The Spiritual Treasure in his hand, the Golden Scepter of Void's Dread, was terrifyingly potent. Its power to trap enemies was absolute, a clear sign that he had come well-prepared.

‘Li Zhouwei might still be able to fight, but his divine abilities and dharma power must be nearly spent… The real problem… is Cheng Jiuwen!’

The middle-aged man stood beside the Celestial Gate with his hand on his sword, guarding Li Zhouwei against any potential ambush. Touba Ci did not lower his guard.

‘The Sword Gate's foundations run deep. Even a cultivator at the initial stage of the Purple Mansion Realm is not to be underestimated!’

The Daoist Master of the Touba family had humbled himself, yet Daoist Master Changyun remained utterly without expression.

“The Touba clan is nothing but vassals who took a second name,” he said coolly. “If you count as a True Monarch’s descendant, then the chaotic battlefields of Jianghuai are teeming with them. You are nothing special.”

“If you wish to leave, you may. Shatter your Imperial Seal and be gone.”

The words struck Touba Ci like lightning, and his face contorted with rage.

Zhang Yun’s meaning was unmistakable: how could the Touba family—whose Great Liang dynasty had fallen and whose True Monarch had perished—dare compare themselves to the ascendant Zhang family as heirs of a True Monarch? The insult struck home, and Touba Ci ground his teeth.

“To think I'm being lectured by someone who changed his own name, hiding his true origins and feigning allegiance to another Daoist tradition!”

Zhang Yun’s eyes shifted, a flash of disbelief giving way to chilling amusement. He stared at him.

“Those are not words you are qualified to speak.”

Touba Ci met his gaze with a cold sneer, the bitter humiliation catching in his throat. He said no more. A surge of Profound Yellow Qi began to gather, and intricate, ink-dark patterns spread rapidly across his body as Profound Qi surged forth.

Zhang Yun was already in the air. He unleashed a wave of Metal Malice as his white umbrella unfurled, blocking the tide of incoming Profound Qi. Their gazes locked for a mere instant before another dazzling flash erupted nearby.

“BOOM!”

Another of the Merciful Ones had fallen.

Touba Ci broke away, the point between his brows glowing with brilliant light. He clenched his jaw and decisively activated the Imperial Seal suspended in the air. As faint, snow-white cracks spiderwebbed across it, the pale barrier of light finally trembled, and an overwhelming wave of Profound Qi engulfed the sky.

This Profound Qi was strange. It became fire upon contact with metal and turned to yin when it met yang. It was a vast, unstoppable tide that held back all the other cultivators. The ivory scepter floating in the air shuddered violently before its light died and it fell from the sky.

Seeing Touba Ci play his final card, Zhang Yun showed no intention of honoring his word. Instead, a broad smile touched his lips as he produced an ink-blue, narrow-necked vase with a wooden body and a golden base from his sleeve and aimed it skyward.

Though shrouded in the boundless Profound Yellow Qi, Touba Ci saw the movement clearly. His heart seized with dread.

“Zhang Yun… you!”

Zhang Yun’s expression was implacable. He activated the treasure, and in an instant, the entire expanse of Profound Qi began to flow like a river cascading from the heavens, funneling directly into the mouth of the vase.

More terrifying still, the spiritual artifacts he wore began to tremble violently, threatening to fly from his body. They seemed to be fighting his own divine abilities, trying to escape into the vase’s pull.

Shock and fury warred within Touba Ci. He finally recognized the inexplicable killing intent behind Zhang Yun’s smile. He braced his long halberd against the air, but the weapon’s shaft began to bend under the immense suction.

‘What enmity is there between us that he would go this far?’

It wasn’t that he couldn’t defeat this man, but his opponent’s goal was clearly to stall him. Cheng Jiuwen and Li Zhouwei were here now, but who would arrive next? What if it was that Sword Immortal from the Dui Metal lineage?

Worse, the man was holding his own treasures hostage. How could he possibly abandon them?

As the fury on Touba Ci’s face deepened, Zhang Yun’s smile only widened. But then, he felt the Great Void itself tremble as a figure materialized from thin air.

The man was dressed in black robes, his power immense, backed by the convergence of four distinct Profound Qi divine abilities. His lean, cold face was a mask of calm as his gaze fell upon Zhang Yun.

In that moment, the world fell silent. The cascading Profound Qi froze in place, and the trembling spiritual artifacts grew still. Zhang Yun’s expression remained unchanged as he smiled.

“So, the Great Daoist Master has arrived.”

It was Touba Qiye, come to his kinsman’s aid.

This direct heir of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition showed no fear. He simply glanced at the sky with a smirk.

“What is your intent, Great Daoist Master? In this situation, even if I were to kill him, you would have no grounds to blame me…”

Touba Qiye said nothing. He shot Zhang Yun a final, furious glare, then swept up his junior and vanished toward the north. Zhang Yun made no move to stop them, his gaze turning to ice as he watched them depart.

Though rescued, Touba Ci’s face was a mask of humiliation. He swallowed an elixir and spat through clenched teeth,

“I don’t know what madness possessed Zhang Yun. If not for your intervention, Your Excellency…”

Now within the Great Void, Touba Qiye’s expression was just as dark. He didn’t reply, instead turning to face the north and bowing deeply.

“Many thanks, Senior, for allowing us to pass.”

Only then did Touba Ci notice an old man standing nearby, stroking his beard, a gourd hanging at his side. The figure was utterly unmistakable: Wang Ziya of the Numinous Treasure Order.

Touba Ci had witnessed the man’s power before and was deeply shaken. Hearing that Wang Ziya had permitted their escape, he quickly bowed.

“This junior will forever remember Your Excellency’s kindness!”

“I wouldn’t dare claim such a thing.”

Wang Ziya’s smile was restrained, his expression unreadable.

“I have a mission yet to complete, so I lingered. I had no intention of interfering. You both speak too formally… However…”

His eyes narrowed with a probing light.

“It seems His Highness… is not always careful with his words.”

This was clearly the source of Touba Qiye’s grim mood. At Wang Ziya’s words, a fresh wave of fear washed over him. He raised his hand and struck his son viciously across the face. Touba Ci staggered, bowing his head in apology as the Great Daoist Master’s voice dripped with ice.

“What were you arguing with him about?”

His voice trembled with repressed rage.

“Changed his name, feigned allegiance to another Dao… How dare you speak such words! You hold Qi Lanyan in such contempt… but ask yourself, would he ever dare utter such a thing?”

Touba Ci, still reeling, frowned but remained silent. Touba Qiye took a deep breath and conjured a divine ability to shroud them.

“That eminence from the Golden Feather Sect commands the Geng-Dui, capable of transmuting the twin metals. To speak of changing one’s name to advance a Dao Lineage… you… you…”

Touba Ci froze. Touba Qiye’s voice dropped to a whisper, concealed by his power.

“Never mind the name change from long ago. After that eminence was reincarnated, why did he take the generational name ‘Tai’ and the title ‘Yuan’? To which sect does the name ‘Tai’ belong? Wishful thinking or not, he refers to the Master of the Supreme Yang as ‘Senior,’ not ‘Lord’!”

Touba Ci had meant only to mock Zhang Yun, never imagining his words would implicate such a legendary figure. He finally understood the coldness in Zhang Yun’s eyes. The revelation left him utterly dumbfounded.

“How… how can that be possible?”

What did this mean? The world knew the True Monarch’s title was Taiyuan, but Touba Ci would have died before connecting that name to the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition. Even if it was merely the True Monarch’s own aspiration, it was still the will of a being on that level.

“How can it be possible?”

Touba Qiye’s expression grew complicated. Wang Ziya, realizing that the younger man had truly misspoken from ignorance, shook his head with a faint smile.

“There is no crime in ignorance. That eminence is unlikely to take offense. But his great name and power are renowned even in the Heavens…”

The Touba father and son turned their gazes to him. The heir of the Numinous Treasure Order seemed lost in thought.

“As the saying goes…” he began, his voice distant.

“Let no one say a Monarch's path is a realm apart, for the legacies of the Three Profoundities gather under one roof. To seek the ultimate yin, one must race the moon; to achieve what the sun-chariot cannot, one must embrace the Crimson Virtue. The great clans came to the palace to listen to the teachings of Wu Earth, and even legendary figures have stood before the Golden Lock. He mastered all the immortal spell arts of a bygone age—and this morning, he has ascended the pavilion to pay respects at the Azure Step!”

Both men were lost in contemplation. With a final, parting gesture, Wang Ziya stepped into the Great Void and was gone.

Touba Qiye returned the salute. He waited until the last echo of the man’s voice had faded before flying onward in silence. Only when they were far from Jianghuai did the harsh lines on his face soften. He turned to his son, his voice filled with regret.

“There’s no telling how many great powers were watching Jianghuai just now. Fortunately… fortunately, you truly did not know.”

“It’s not your fault. Few know the truth these days. If I hadn’t followed the regent-king to the north and met a few of the direct descendants myself, I would be ignorant of these secrets as well.”

Touba Ci stood numbly, his mind racing. A chill crept through him.

“Was that why he wanted to kill me?”

Touba Qiye considered this for a moment.

“He likely guessed you had no death wish. Even he wouldn’t dare state these matters so openly. He was merely using your words as a pretext. Jianghuai is not the domain of the Great Zhao. Our family may have once ruled the Central Plains, but in the eyes of the Zhang family, we are nothing more than fallen outsiders. Killing you would earn him merit. Why wouldn’t he take the chance?”

Touba Ci felt his breath catch.

“For that alone?”

Touba Qiye gritted his teeth.

“That Zhang Yun isn’t even afraid of me! In his eyes, so long as the regent-king with his perfected divine abilities is not present, you are just another Helian Wujiang!”

The former hegemon of the Central Plains, the imperial line of Great Liang, had fallen so low. Touba Qiye’s face was grim, his blood running cold. Realizing that to continue this topic would only invite more danger, he changed the subject.

“Let’s put that aside for now…”

The Great Daoist Master’s tone shifted, now filled with a disbelief that bordered on the impossible.

“What in the world happened at Lake Xian? How could Qi Lanyan possibly be dead?”

At the mention of this, Touba Ci’s face twisted in a snarl.

“Qi Lanyan… utterly useless!”

He recounted the events at the lake. Touba Qiye’s expression shifted again and again as he listened. When he heard that King Wei had managed to fight back even while afflicted by the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth, he fell into a stunned silence.

“No wonder,” he murmured, his face pale with shock.

---

A rosy, dust-filled light pulsed across the sky as sandstorms raged below. Shards of glazed crystal rained down, kicking up violent gales across the ravaged earth.

Li Zhouwei drew back his halberd and swallowed the blood that rose in his throat. His fingers slowly clenched into a fist. Though his emotions churned like a stormy sea, his mind was a sea of ice as he murmured to himself:

‘He mastered all the immortal spell arts of a bygone age—and this morning, he has ascended the pavilion to pay respects at the Azure Step.’

The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth had robbed him of nearly all sensation. His spiritual sense was constricted to his immediate vicinity, leaving him functionally blind. But for that very reason, while feigning unawareness, he had kept his Spirit Probe active the entire time.

Nearly every word spoken between the Toubas and Wang Ziya had reached him. Though the two had been guarded in the Great Void, speaking more with their thoughts than their words, Li Zhouwei had connected the pieces almost instantly.

‘Golden Oneness… Highest Azure…’

‘Highest Azure practices in seclusion, while Golden Oneness resides openly in the mountains…’

‘Golden Oneness isn’t the mortal branch of Highest Azure; they are two parallel Dao-paths.’

He recalled something he had heard long ago, after returning from capturing the Demon King in the Western Sea:

‘The first disciple of Comprehending Profoundity, the clan that Highest Azure favors year after year, the Immortal Lord that Great Liang worships generation after generation…’

This all but confirmed the True Monarch’s origins. He was from the bloodline of a great power of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition, yet after his reincarnation, he had likely received guidance from a master of the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition—perhaps even becoming a disciple—and it almost certainly was not the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition.

And yet, such a figure still held the title ‘Taiyuan.’

Once that title was connected to Azure Profoundity, the hazy relationship between the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition and the powers of Luoxia Wu Light began to clear. The tight bond between the Golden Feather Sect and the cultivation world of the Yue State became undeniable.

‘No wonder this evergreen of Metal Virtue… holds such an exalted position among the True Monarchs of the world, and even within the Heavens themselves!’

His heart grew calm. He buried these thoughts deep within his consciousness and glanced down at the swirling sands with a hint of regret.

‘It’s a shame… Touba Ci shattered the Spiritual Treasure sealing the area, allowing the other Merciful Ones to escape. Otherwise… my gains would have been even greater.’

Still, what he had gained was by no means small. He had come here, despite his grave injuries, for the sake of immortal merit and to witness this very spectacle.

And, of course, for another important prize.

He turned his head, his vision swimming for a moment before he could focus. He confirmed that the great Profound Tiger was completely suppressed by the combined power of Audience with the Celestial Gate and the Huai River Map, pinned immobile under the vast Heavenly Light.

‘At least… I've secured this strand of Talisman Qi!’

His eyes, veiled by a film of colored light, stared downward for a long while before he finally looked up and turned. Only then did he realize that Daoist Master Changyun was standing before him.

Zhang Yun’s expression was complicated. His gaze swept over the grievous wounds covering Li Zhouwei’s body, and he looked up, his voice filled with awe.

“This humble servant, Changyun, greets King Wei.”

“Daoist Master,” Li Zhouwei replied, “you have upheld justice and helped us reclaim Jianghuai. You shall be rewarded for your service.”

Although the Zhang family did not possess a Crystalline Jade Branch, as a direct heir of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, Zhang Yun knew the horrors of the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth all too well. His thoughts were a tangled mess.

‘Qi Lanyan’s divine abilities were average, but he was a disciple of Guanhua. One blast from that Crystalline Jade Branch must have destroyed that powerful Eye Divine Ability of his. He looks strong on the outside, but he is likely hollowed out from the inside.’

This calamity would only burn hotter with time. It was a miracle that Li Zhouwei was still standing. Terrified that the king might suddenly collapse, Zhang Yun spoke with hesitation.

“I implore you, King Wei… withdraw your forces and recover!”

(End of Chapter)




# Chapter 1161: Jade Shattered

A storm of power swept through the heavens as a grayish-white brilliance gathered in the sky. From a supreme Buddhist Land, millions of golden and pink lights rained down, falling upon the mountain and illuminating every rock and stone across its slopes.

Towering golden figures stood at the forefront, their auras coalescing into celestial phenomena: heavenly beings anointing the earth, a rain of vibrant blossoms, blooming lotus ponds, and shimmering glazed light. Immeasurable sacred lands converged to hold aloft each of the Mahas.

At the very center, the dazzling light coalesced into a single figure. His face was like white jade, his aura noble and imposing. Behind him, it was as if Mount Sumeru itself was his bulwark, with the four continents suspended in the air. The twelve ordination scars on his scalp shone like pure gold.

He held a purple, circular mirror, large as a man's face, cupped in his hand. Responding to the will of the three Mahas, a torrent of iridescent light poured down from the Buddhist Land above, funneling into the mirror. It converged into a solid purple halo that seared the great formation below, making it tremble violently.

The man at the center was Tian Langzhi, the Liangli Maha of the Sea of Desire.

Flanking him stood two towering Dharma Bodies. One was a figure of heavy, reddish-gold, its feet trampling a mythical jackal—this was the sixth-reincarnation Dharma Protector Maha, Renshijia. The other was a black-skinned figure that reached for the heavens, clutching a profound earthen vessel—the sixth-reincarnation Earth-Governing Maha, Xiaodisa!

Every top-ranking Maha of the Way of Great Desire had followed Tian Langzhi to this very place.

The Maha holding the earthen vessel, his hands forming incantation seals, spoke with a grim expression.

"Nuzi has fallen at the lake," he said in a low voice.

Tian Langzhi's expression remained unchanged, as if the deceased was a complete stranger.

"His cultivation was insufficient," he said dismissively. "He died facing his tribulation. How pitiful. How respectable."

The Dharma Protector Maha, Renshijia, showed a flicker of concern.

"He followed the First Seat for many years. I fear... this will be difficult to explain."

At this, Xiaodisa swallowed whatever he was about to say. Tian Langzhi opened his eyes a fraction.

"Qi Lanyan sought him out to head south for one reason alone: his karmic tie to the Sparrow Carp Fish. It was a ploy to pin us down, to force our hand and make us send rescuers, thereby allowing them to tap into the divine power of the Great Desire..."

"How absurd. Now that the Sparrow Carp Fish has been reborn, that karmic bond was severed long ago. A pity about Bashan, though—he was a rare talent."

He spoke of pity, but his face held no trace of it. His eyes were fixed on the mountain of the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple below, as if his gaze could pierce through the hue of the Manifestations Earth to see the Jade True radiance hidden within. A look of keen anticipation and greed surfaced in their depths.

Watching the formation weaken bit by bit, Tian Langzhi's voice was low and deep.

"Daoist Friend Liu, must you continue this futile resistance?"

His voice echoed, seeping through the cracks in the formation as streaks of pink, glass-like light. The light shone down upon the forest, clashing with the Jade True radiance and sending up plumes of white smoke.

---

Atop the peak, a sword cultivator sat cross-legged, his face a painful, stark white. The Jade True light that normally enveloped him like a shroud of azure jade was shattered. The halo behind him was marred by dark fractures. His gaze was glacial as he stared unblinking at the sky.

During this great battle between the north and south at Lake Xian, the divine abilities had flared most intensely in the southeast. Yet the most dangerous front was not Ting Province, nor Baiye Creek, nor even Lake Xian itself. It was Tangdao Mountain.

Here, Liu Bai, the Protector-General of Jinghai, faced three Mahas from the Way of Great Desire.

He faced the terrifying pressure of an eighth-generation Maha, Tian Langzhi, leading the assault, flanked by two sixth-generation Mahas. An endless stream of Merciful Ones, both great and small, descended, all backed by the full might of the Buddhist Land of the Way of Great Desire.

The pressure on Tangdao Mountain was scarcely less than that at Lake Xian. Yet in stark contrast, the only defenders here were Liu Bai and the master and disciple from Overlook Peak.

Their only hope was the great formation enveloping the mountain.

This Great Ye Profound Exiled Spirit Formation had been personally established by Yang Ruiyi. Using the 'Bestowed Origin Transformation Manifestation Grand Marvelous Spirit Method', he had combined countless rare treasures with the unique celestial and terrestrial advantages of Jianghuai's highest peak. The formation drew upon the Manifestations Earth aspect of Earth Virtue, making it unparalleled among those at the Purple Mansion Realm.

To put it plainly, with Liu Bai defending it, not even an eighth-generation Maha like Tian Langzhi could hope to breach it quickly with his present might.

"Cough..."

The Jade True cultivator coughed up a spray of blood, a cold, ironic smile touching his lips.

"But it cannot withstand an assault so long in the making, so meticulously prepared."

The tide of battle had turned because of the purple mirror in Tian Langzhi's hand.

The divine ability of this artifact was strange and extraordinary. It bore no resemblance to a Buddhist treasure, yet it could channel the full brilliance of the Buddhist Land and even connect to the great sun in the heavens, gathering the esoteric power of the Supreme Yang.

While not designed to shatter formations, its searing power only intensified, producing an endless conflagration that was more effective than any siege weapon.

The artifact had forced Liu Bai and Xianyao out from the formation's protection multiple times in attempts to disrupt the attack. Each time, the combined assault of the three Mahas drove them back. On their last attempt... they had nearly been unable to return.

By now, if Liu Bai still failed to see the naked ambition of the Way of Great Desire, his two centuries of cultivation would have been a waste.

'Tian Langzhi was once a cultivator from the Central Plains... He inherited the Jade True lineage of the Heavenly Lang Terrace and reached the Purple Mansion Realm, but his progress halted at the precipice of the Purple Mystery. The techniques of the Heavenly Lang Terrace are exceptionally unorthodox, filled with extreme methods that damage one's character to extend one's life-mandate, or sacrifice one's life-mandate to nourish one's character. In the end, with his lifespan dwindling, he abandoned his path and converted to the Buddhist way...'

The Heavenly Lang Terrace was quite renowned. It was an ancient Daoist Tradition, far older than even Wanling Heaven, founded by True Monarch Chilang. His secular name was Liu Yubing, the very first bloodline ancestor revered by the royal house of the Chu State.

'When the Chu State fell, the legacies of the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion were lost to time. The Jade True Dao Lineage I cultivate was passed down through my clan, and it too can be traced back to the Heavenly Lang Terrace. How could I not know this!'

'He has been plotting this for a long time... biding his time, waiting for the war between north and south to escalate, for both sides to be too preoccupied to spare their Divided Aspect Bodies. Then he came, wielding the full power of the Way of Great Desire, utterly determined to convert me and claim my legacy!'

In his icy gaze, the great formation trembled ceaselessly as wisps of white energy drifted down from the divine ability. Liu Bai’s eyes shifted from the north back to the south, his gaze fixed on the gloomy Exiled Qi in the distance. He turned his head and said softly,

"Daoist Friend Lian."

At his words, an old man who had been desperately using his own divine ability to fend off the descending light turned to face him. This Daoist Master, who had reached the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm using a different Dao, was also at the end of his strength. Half his face was stripped away to stark white bone. His voice was filled with grief.

"Protector-General... We have no news from Lake Xian. We've been trapped for months, with no hope of reinforcement!"

A sharp cracking sound echoed through the mountains. An ironic smile touched Liu Bai's lips, but he didn't answer the old man. Instead, he said,

"I hear there is also a great battle at the White River. You two Daoist Masters should flee toward Baiye."

The faces of the old man and the youth beside him changed drastically. But the Daoist Master's expression was serene. With a flick of his wrist, he drew his sword, its chilling white edge pointed toward the heavens.

"BOOM!"

An infinite light of Manifestations Earth surged into the sky, finally blocking the purple radiance. The might of the Buddhist Land erupted, and a deafening Sanskrit chant filled the air.

"Daoist Friend Liu! The time for our fated connection has come!"

"DONG!"

Two golden bodies, one crimson and one jet-black, rose like mountains, enveloping the sky from left and right. The light at the center grew blindingly bright, traversing space and time to become a golden mountain that came crashing down.

Liu Bai's face was a mask of calm. The Jade True halo behind him soared into the air, unleashing a torrent of milky-white light that shot toward the heavens before violently disintegrating in the sea of clouds.

This jade wheel had been born in a grotto-heaven, its origins extraordinary. It had been nourished by spiritual energy for a thousand years before being gifted to Liu Bai by Li Ximing, becoming a Jade True Spiritual Artifact attuned to his divine ability. Now, as it shattered, it bloomed with a million points of white light, like a bright moon emerging from behind the clouds, pure and radiant.

The brilliant Jade True light pulsed, felt by heaven and earth. Even Tian Langzhi’s expression changed. He tried to evade, but an azure-white radiance coalesced beneath his golden form, trapping him like a narrow, treacherous cliff path, making it impossible to move.

It was as if Tian Langzhi and Liu Bai had vanished from the world, falling into another reality.

'Azure Jade Cliff.'

Tian Langzhi was all too familiar with this divine ability. As a cultivator of the Heavenly Lang Terrace Dao Lineage, 'Azure Jade Cliff' had been his trump card for over three hundred years. It forced an opponent onto a perilous cliffside path. While one could try to dodge, leaving the path—even being grazed by its edge—would exponentially amplify the power of any incoming attack, leaving no choice but to face it head-on.

In an instant, the curtains of brilliant light before him were violently torn asunder. The glare was so cold it made his face ache and brought tears to his eyes.

But he had no time to block the descending Jade True light. The entire sky seemed to sprout countless eyes, all fixed on the sword cultivator in the air. Seeing the furious blaze of his life-mandate erupting from his body, Tian Langzhi's face twisted in alarm.

"Stop him! Quickly!"

The moment he spoke, the face of the crimson Dharma Body, Renshijia, tore open from the brow downward. The inside was utterly hollow, containing nothing but a swirling mass of crimson light.

Liu Bai's gaze never left Tian Langzhi. The crimson light, hindered by the 'Azure Jade Cliff' technique, was already weakened. Then, something shot out from his sleeve.

It was a talisman, three inches long and a finger's breadth wide, forged of a deep, heavy crimson. On one side, profound patterns formed the character for 'Chu'. On the other, brilliant purple patterns formed two characters: 'Liu Yi'.

The moment the talisman appeared, the very colors of heaven and earth shifted. The characters flickered and pulsed with a crimson-gold light that swept away the incoming attack. Bathed in its glow, Renshijia's entire body erupted in Li Fire.

Ignoring his grievous wounds, Liu Bai shot forward, his sword drawn. The radiant light of his life-mandate blazed as he pointed his blade at Tian Langzhi. A vast sword light, merged with the radiance of the shattered Jade True artifact, slammed into the eighth-generation Maha in the sky.

"CRACK!"

A cry of pain echoed for a fleeting moment. The moon-like Jade True light receded like the tide. Tian Langzhi's jade-like face slowly came back into view, the cracks on its surface vanishing at an astonishing rate until it was once more perfect.

But a deep white line had appeared on his face. His hand clamped over his left eye, refusing to move. Wisps of white, smoke-like blood trickled from between his fingers, becoming a waterfall of white energy that rained down upon the mortal world.

Even though he had lived for eight generations, though Liu Bai was severely injured, though the Way of Great Desire was at its zenith, and though he was empowered by the full might of the Buddhist Land—faced with a strike born from Liu Bai sacrificing his own Spiritual Artifact, future, and life-mandate, Tian Langzhi had been wounded.

A cold voice bit through gritted teeth.

"Stubborn fool..."

A mountain-sized golden palm stretched across the sky, its lines like deep ravines. The five fingers closed, crushing the Jade True light within its grasp. It held firm as shards of jade and glazed light rained down.

The Protector-General's long hair flew wildly. He was but a speck of white light, clutched tightly in that giant hand. Yet his face was calm, utterly unconcerned as his divine ability and life-mandate burned away without restraint, forming a milky-white halo against the crushing pressure.

Suddenly, the world fell silent. Tian Langzhi's expression shifted, and he looked off into the distance.

Countless streams of black qi surged from the south like a tidal wave over a mountain, pushing a swaying, profound nether-palace across the sky.

Yang Ruiyi!

He had bypassed Shanji, conquered Baiye with lightning speed, and now he had arrived.

His appearance was a stone cast into a placid lake, sending out infinite ripples. All-consuming darkness instantly shrouded the sky. The jet-black Maha moved, raising its earthen vessel high and smashing it down.

"BOOM!"

The Great Void shuddered as if the world were ending. The Exiled Qi that had flooded the heavens stalled. Tian Langzhi’s voice was a mixture of shock and fury.

"Yang Ruiyi? You abandoned Shanji Prefecture!"

Though the distant scene was now reflected in his eyes, Liu Bai, trapped in the palm, remained calm. He reversed his grip on his sword, lifted his head slightly, and placed the blade against his own neck.

In that instant, a chill shot through Tian Langzhi's heart. His feigned rage vanished, replaced by genuine urgency. His voice, carried by his power, rushed into the palm.

"Daoist Friend Liu! It doesn't have to be this way!"

Liu Bai’s eyes held only irony. It was as if he hadn't even seen the rapidly approaching Yang Ruiyi, a sight his captor had deliberately let him witness. As his divine ability surged, Tian Langzhi's voice turned hateful.

"Liu Bai! Have you forgotten the blood debt of your ruined state and exterminated clan?"

The Daoist Master's expression finally flickered. Tian Langzhi's resentful voice, laced with power, echoed again.

"Whose family destroyed the Chu State? Whose family destroyed the Heavenly Mansions? When Xiao Ci usurped the throne, who served as his wings? The armies your Liu clan raised to restore the state—by whose hand did they fall? And who left you here to die, sending no aid for months?"

"Don't you hate them?"

His words were filled with rage, but they only served to calm Liu Bai's eyes. The sword cultivator raised an eyebrow, his gaze seeming to pierce the Great Void to some dark, hidden place. There, an old man in Daoist robes stood quietly.

The man had hair like snow, and a large gourd stood beside him. His gaze was gentle, tinged with pity. Across the veil of space and power, he watched Liu Bai silently, as if awaiting his answer.

In his hands, he held a scroll about three feet wide. It was not unrolled, but its exposed, light-azure, fish-scale-patterned surface emanated an elegant, profound light.

A small smile touched Liu Bai's handsome face, whether of irony or self-deprecation, it was impossible to tell. His sword finally moved. His jade-like skin split, and crimson beads of blood like jewels gushed forth, sliding down the hilt with a clear, melodic clinking.

"CLANG!"

Countless streams of sword qi erupted from his body, every last bit of his power and dharma force becoming fuel for the inferno. Amidst Tian Langzhi's furious roar, a dense, potent Jade True light shot into the heavens.

The light was a startling shade of bluish-white. His body exploded like a clap of thunder, shattering the sky into countless fragments of jade that rained down. In the heavens, celestial palaces and pavilions materialized. There were visions of colorful sleeves serving diligently, of fair hands offering jade. Then, the candles were extinguished, and the moon shone down upon a silver lamp.

A divine ability had fallen.

---

The two celestial phenomena over Lake Xian had not yet fully formed when this Jade True brilliance rose in the west. The streak of white light was gentle, yet it sent a shiver down the spine of all who saw it, a stark testament to the bloody nature of this war.

On the same day, another divine ability had been extinguished. The third mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had fallen.

The sky over Jianghuai had changed completely. The accumulated celestial phenomena had reached a boiling point. The Jade True light continued to rise like mist, piling up like snow in layer upon layer until even the Exiled Qi began to dissipate.

The sky full of Jade True light was reflected in the surging pupils of the man in black. This Grand General of the Song State, this agent of the Yang clan's interests, stood silent and motionless against the distant horizon.




# Chapter 1162: To Remain Whole

The sky churned with roiling energy, scattering clouds and vapor until the brilliant light dimmed to nothing. It merged with the shadows of the Exiled Qi, precipitating into a heavy, oppressive gloom.

The palm, blasted apart by the Jade True light, was filled with shattered jade. Amidst the fragments, the Chu State military tally still pulsed with a faint, crimson glow.

Yang Ruiyi’s black robes whipped about in the fierce wind, the sword at his waist a deep, somber shade. He parted his lips and spoke a single, cold name,

“Tian Langzhi…”

The eight-life Maha lowered his gaze to the shards of jade in his hand. A fury began to brew in his eyes—not the wild anger of frustration or the bitterness of regret, but an indignation steeped in shock and sudden, jarring comprehension.

Only when Yang Ruiyi’s voice echoed through the air did the Maha look up from his stupor. An irrepressible laugh burst from him as he said coldly,

“Grand General Yang, why the pretense? You raced a thousand li to shroud this place in Exiled Qi… for which sword? Do you think I don’t know?”

The words struck Yang Ruiyi like a physical blow, and the last shred of hesitation in his eyes gave way to resignation. He took a step forward, drew his sword, and commanded,

“Get out of Jianghuai.”

Tian Langzhi’s gaze was venomously cold. He raised an eyebrow and sneered,

“And if I refuse? What will you do? I’ll wait right here for Cheng Xunzhi. Does your Song Court dare to fight?”

Yang Ruiyi, already in a foul mood, actually laughed at the threat.

“You are welcome to take that gamble,” he said, his voice tight with fury. “If a war breaks out here and now, do you think my Yang clan won’t do everything to protect Cheng Xunzhi? Will you, an eight-life Maha, be able to preserve your own life? And can that master of yours bear the full wrath of the Underworld!”

Tian Langzhi’s lips trembled, his eyes flickering with uncertainty as if trying to gauge Yang Ruiyi’s resolve. The black-robed man’s expression grew increasingly grim, his eyes locked on Tian Langzhi.

“Why do you think the Golden Feather Sect is stationed at the White River right now?” he said in a low voice. “Tangdao Mountain is just over the ridge from there. Don’t be a fool.”

The statement landed like a thunderclap under the dark clouds, and a look of horror crossed Tian Langzhi’s face. He stumbled back a step, but before he could speak, a faint yet distinct cracking sound echoed from the heavens.

“Crack.”

Everyone’s expression changed in an instant as their gazes shot toward a single point.

A corner of the thick, ink-black Exiled Qi blanketing the sky had shattered. Like a ray of light piercing a sealed, dark room, a point of bright Dui Metal Sword Intent appeared in the fissure.

The edge of a sword, etched with a pattern of golden pear blossoms, thrust into view!

‘So fast!’

The world seemed to shake. Yang Ruiyi’s eyes flared with a mixture of shock and rage as roiling black qi began to flow into his hands. In the Great Void, the watching Daoist grew tense, his form suddenly materializing. He raised his hand, forming a seal with two fingers before his lips.

The moment he saw that figure, Tian Langzhi knew the situation had escalated. The hatred in his eyes vanished, replaced by urgency. He sprang into the air, gathered his two Dharma Protectors, and transformed into a streak of brilliant white Buddhist light, hastily descending into the Buddhist Land below.

A pair of sword-like pupils lit up in the oppressive darkness.

‘Damn that Tian Langzhi!’

Seeing the figure of the Dui Metal sword immortal emerge, Yang Ruiyi’s heart plunged into an icy abyss. Fortunately, the Buddhist light had already fled, disappearing over the horizon. The Great Daoist Master of the Sword Gate could only stand silently in the raging wind, his aura as cold as ice.

The iridescent light of Jade True descended from the heavens, bit by bit. Yang Ruiyi suppressed the chill in his heart and lowered his head.

“Senior Cheng…”

Cheng Xunzhi was silent. After a long moment, his voice, raspy and strained, finally came.

“Liu Bai has fallen.”

Yang Ruiyi’s voice was bleak.

“Tian Langzhi borrowed the Purple-Gold Scenery Ingot-Flint… even this grand formation couldn’t stop him…”

The sword immortal turned his head, his gaze lingering on Yang Ruiyi’s face for a moment. The brief pause felt like a blade scraping across Yang Ruiyi’s heart. Finally, Cheng Xunzhi spoke.

“I was delayed by Daoist Master Chunshuo of the Golden Feather Sect. I was a step too slow.”

His words seemed to be an explanation for the lingering Jade True qi in the air, and a statement of fact for Yang Ruiyi. He then began to walk, treading across the Exiled Qi and brilliant light in the sky. He collected the jade stones in a box and slowly vanished toward the southern horizon, eventually becoming a tiny speck of gold.

Only then did Yang Ruiyi slowly let out a breath. But an urgent cry suddenly rang out.

“Grand General… Grand General… I beg you, save him!”

Startled, Yang Ruiyi quickly turned to see Daoist Master Cheng Qian rushing forward. The tears in the young man’s eyes had not yet dried, but there was no time for grief.

“Please, Grand General, save my master!”

Yang Ruiyi’s gaze flickered. He turned to the other side, where Xianyao’s expression was ashen, like a mask of white porcelain shrouded in a faint, dark light. He was barely holding himself aloft in mid-air. Powerful divine abilities were pouring from his wounds while halos of multicolored light circled behind his head, making him look like a celestial being.

The sight was undoubtedly beautiful, but to the two Daoist Masters, it was terrifying.

“His six senses are collapsing from within, his spiritual essence bleeding into the world…”

The old Daoist Master was already nearing the end of his lifespan. After joining the Great Song, he had consumed numerous life-extending pills just to survive this long. A cultivator so close to his end was supposed to be in quiet seclusion. How could he possibly withstand such a high-intensity battle?
These were the signs of a lamp about to flicker out.

Yang Ruiyi hurriedly channeled black qi, tapping the old man’s face six times. The layer of dark light slowly dissipated. He then took out a medicinal pill and gave it to him. Xianyao coughed up a mouthful of black blood, and some color slowly returned to his face.

“Many thanks, Grand General!”

Yang Ruiyi stared at him for a moment before turning to Cheng Qian, his expression pained.

“Return to Overlook Peak at once and rest!”

This was tantamount to telling him to prepare for the end. Even though Cheng Qian had expected it, the words washed over him like a bucket of ice water, from his head to his toes. He stared blankly at Yang Ruiyi.

Yang Ruiyi’s mind was in turmoil, and he misinterpreted the look. He sent a message via his divine ability.

“After you have arranged the old master’s final affairs… you can return here to find me.”

Cheng Qian seemed to snap out of his daze. He averted his gaze, bowed, and without another word, supported the old Daoist Master as they began the long journey toward their sect’s gate in the Eastern Sea.

Yang Ruiyi watched his departing back, and the breath he had just swallowed caught in his chest again, feeling like a block of eternal ice that crushed the air from his lungs.

But what could he do?

‘Whether it’s Li Zhouwei, Cheng Xunzhi, Liu Bai, or Xianyao… of course this is all my fault… who else could be blamed?’

His lips were pale as he raised a hand with a complicated expression, watching the Jade True light stream through his fingers. He murmured to himself,

‘Was it really necessary… to eliminate a future threat… I could have just exhausted your life-mandate, severed your path to the Purple Mystery… I already reacted as fast as I could… I clearly made it in time…’

Liu Bai guarding this place was a tacit agreement between the Way of Great Desire and the Yang clan. The Way of Great Desire coveted him, and by having him defend the mountain alone, he could tie up all their forces at Tangdao Mountain, preventing them from interfering in the great war between the north and south. This was precisely why the slave Nuzi, forcefully summoned by Qi Lanyan, had fallen so easily without drawing any intervention from the Way of Great Desire!

Meanwhile, his own father was wary of this rapidly rising descendant of the Chu State and had long harbored a desire to suppress him. As the one tasked with carrying out the Yang clan’s interests, Yang Ruiyi was caught in an unimaginably contradictory and awkward position. He had, of course, thought of saving Liu Bai in time—even if his path to the Dao was lost, at least his life could be saved…

He had raced a thousand li to arrive before Cheng Xunzhi and prevent the situation from escalating, but he had also acted out of a sliver of selfish intent.

But the result had clearly been beyond his expectations.

His pupils dilated slightly. The final, mocking smile of the Jade True sword cultivator within the golden palm still lingered in his mind. Yang Ruiyi didn’t know what Tian Langzhi had said in the end, but he understood with deep certainty that the last surviving Daoist Master of the Chu-Liu line had probably understood everything long ago.

Yang Ruiyi stood rooted to the spot, a chill seeping into his limbs.

‘Better to be shattered jade than an intact tile.’

The Exiled Qi continued to roil and boil in the sky, seething with a thick, palpable fury. Yang Ruiyi squeezed his eyes shut, his heart aching.

‘Or perhaps… it was…’

…

“It was that he would rather fall on the spot than fail to rip off a corner of their feigned, whitewashed masks!”

“Cheng Qian was watching, Cheng Xunzhi was watching… and who knows, maybe even Li Zhouwei and that Emperor of the Great Song were watching too!”

The Great Void was a kaleidoscope of colors. The shock had still not faded from Wang Ziya’s eyes. He held the scroll painting, feeling an immense pressure in his heart. Beside him, a gentle white mist took the shape of a leaping beast, from which a voice emerged.

“Tian Langzhi helped him achieve it, too. Putting on a show, risking his life to delay them for that moment… his hatred for the south is no weaker than anyone else’s…”

“Truly disrespectful…” Wang Ziya’s tone was complex, but it didn’t sound like a reprimand. Wei Xuanyin retracted his light and sighed.

“Back when the Chu-Liu clan was destroyed, the Yang clan received orders to act as the mortal hand that pushed them to their doom. They left a branch in Southern Yue holding the military tally, which is how we have the Liu Bai of today. To the great powers, he wasn't worthy of notice, but for the Yang family, with the world in such utter chaos, they had to prevent future troubles.”

“After all, Liu Bai harbored a grudge.”

Wang Ziya’s gaze fell upon the scroll in his palm, his expression desolate.

“No wonder they sent me.”

His heart felt heavy.

“Yang Ruiyi can’t be feeling good either… this war has shaken the north and south. At least four mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have fallen… not to mention countless others of lesser rank… Who won? No one won. It seems to me this bloodshed was just exchanged for more bloodshed. Every family is weeping.”

“At least they have tears to shed.”

Wei Xuanyin, however, was already accustomed to such things, or perhaps he had long since seen the true nature of this war. He glanced at the scroll and asked,

“Is this the true form of the True Monarch of Nurturing Life and Prosperous Treasures?”

Wang Ziya nodded silently.

“Disciple-brother is truly learned!”

Wei Xuanyin shook his head.

“I know a thing or two about True Monarch Chilang’s affair of the ‘Son’s Oath’.”

It was an event from the distant past. Back then, True Monarch Chilang had not yet achieved the Dao. He lived under an assumed name, had traveled far from home, and had become a disciple under Xu Xiang. He was known for his unyielding temperament. True Monarch Xu Xiang was at odds with the Buddhists, so Chilang became a vanguard in suppressing them.

At that time, Tongxuan Palace was being established. True Monarch Xu Xiang moved to observe the ceremony, closing his six senses and erecting a pavilion with his bare hands. Chilang, finally free, returned home for the first time in fifty years. Unexpectedly, the ‘Tianwu Revered One’ was spreading his teachings in the mortal world and passed through his hometown. His young grandson, drawn by the excitement, went to the temple to pay respects to the Buddhists and was seen by Chilang upon his return. Chilang was incredulous, then enraged.

For years, he had stayed on the mountain under a false name, practicing cultivation to spare his family from the karmic consequences of his path. Yet, every year, he sent letters home, instructing his family’s descendants to diligently study Daoist methods and not stray onto the wrong path. But his family only knew he had gone to some mountain to cultivate; they didn’t know he had attained divine abilities and had never taken his words to heart. They had even invited a Master Monk into their home!

Chilang was furious. He seized the monk, only to find he was a mere mortal. He could only banish him. Believing his grandson was young and ignorant, and that his eldest son had been lax in his teachings, he cut off his son’s ears as punishment. Then he forced him to swear an oath before the ancestral patriarch’s statue.

‘The descendants of my line shall not follow their base nature, nor accept Buddhist teachings. They shall not dissect illusion, nor speak of ultimate truth. If any violate this oath, they shall be executed before the Treasured Earth.’

It was because of this oath that, whether during the spread of Buddhist law into the Central Plains or in later eras of karmic defilement, no one from the Chu-Liu lineage had ever turned to the Buddhist path.

Wang Ziya affirmed his words, saying softly, “My master went to Dongmu Heaven to see the lord and mentioned that my cultivation had stagnated, my qi circulation blocked. I had already sought emptiness to refine the Dao, switched to cultivating the Purple Gold, and entered this mortal world… then a disciple-brother spoke up…”

“He said he had calculated for a long time that a descendant of the Liu clan was about to enter the Buddhist Land. There should have been a reaction from the oath, but it was being blocked by Martial Cultivation. He suggested I bring the patriarch’s statue down to Jiangnan and show it to him face-to-face, to make him die by the oath.”

Wei Xuanyin hesitated a moment.

“If that was truly the case, from what I saw, the Way of Great Desire’s Buddhist Land was advancing with overwhelming momentum. If you hadn’t come, Daoist friend, there would have been a true summoning light…”

Wang Ziya’s voice was bitter.

“Indeed. I made sure he saw me, intending to extinguish that sliver of desire to join the Buddhists. To be selfish, it was because my Numinous Treasure Order was unwilling to lose face. On a personal level, I couldn’t bear to see him become a Buddhist and hoped he could retain some dignity… but he took his own life so decisively! Ai!”

A trace of admiration rose in Wei Xuanyin’s eyes. He then offered comfort,

“The situation now is beyond your control. Preserving the dignity of the Numinous Treasure Order is already fortunate. The matter with Vast Cicada crossed a line, and the powers that be wanted to retaliate. What has happened now is enough for the Yang family to swallow their loss and suffer in silence.”

Hearing this, Wang Ziya felt a measure of peace, though the image of the Jade True cultivator still occupied his mind. His gaze was complicated.

“In ancient times, Encompassing Profoundity was established separately, yet one could still temper their heart in the mortal world, and Divine Monarchs arose in droves. It wasn’t some special favor from the heavenly Dao… ‘There are no heroes in the grotto-heavens.’ Those words say it all!”

Wei Xuanyin had heard this saying before and was not surprised. He raised an eyebrow and said,

“In this world, one seeks the Quest for Gold to attain a position. Whether seeking or attaining, it’s nothing more than a manifestation, an aura. Once you hide away in a grotto-heaven, it’s all just about leisurely seeking immortality. What other kinds of manifestations can there be? I came from the mortal world, and I will prove my worth in the mortal world.”

Wang Ziya fell silent at his words. After a long pause, he said,

“That saying is not appropriate for these times.”

Wei Xuanyin also grew quiet. Seeing the slope of the Great Void grow steeper, Wang Ziya indicated his intent to leave.

“This tempering in the mortal world has brought me great enlightenment. Disciple-brother Wei… do you have further plans?”

Wei Xuanyin nodded, then paused.

“I’m going to Shanji.”

Wang Ziya froze, alarmed.

“That’s not a good idea!”

The man in white robes smiled.

“Since I’ve come to the Profound Governance Pavilion and seen the Zhaoyao Mountain lineage, she must call me senior. I can’t simply ignore this matter. I’ll wait in the mountains. If she has the will to leave the mortal world and return to the mountains, I will bring her back, even if it means offending the Yang family.”

Wang Ziya, who had been about to step away, immediately retracted his foot. He felt a headache coming on. It seemed every Daoist Master he had met since leaving the grotto-heaven was more shocking than the last.

‘Perhaps the mortal world is so treacherous that one must be shockingly unconventional to transcend it.’

But he had always been a good-natured person, just an old Daoist in a temple back in the grotto-heaven. Even knowing the other man was far more calculating than himself, he still tried to dissuade him.

“The matter in Shanji has dragged on for too long, and the Yang clan’s resentment runs deep. This isn’t like the incidents at Lake Xian or the siege of Tangdao Mountain, which were just the schemes of one or two underworld officials with the Yang surname… If this involves Yang Zhuo’s destiny, I estimate that even Judge Yang himself is paying attention!”

“Offending the Yang family is a small matter, but offending Judge Yang is a grave one. If you dare to probe into this… if you displease the lord…”

Wei Xuanyin lowered his hand.

“I see it differently.”

His expression was distant as he mused,

“I have observed that Yang Zhuo’s destiny bears a vicious aspect—wings beating, beak sharp and sinister, a figure bent and exiled, bearing injustice and harboring grievances… And while the Underworld in the south is notoriously ruthless, they are usually meticulous when employing someone, only casting them aside like worn-out shoes when they are no longer useful. It is rare to see them act with such disregard…”

“I fear they never intended to treat him as a monarch.”




# Chapter 1163: Father and Brothers in the Hall

The Imperial Palace of the Great Zhao, Jingzhao.

Dynasties had risen and fallen across the northern heavens, and this city, situated at the heart of the world, had served as the imperial capital for nearly all of them. In the time of the Zhou, it was known as Fenghao; to the Wei, it was Changyang. After the Qi burned the Wei palaces, they dared not occupy the city, establishing their capital in the east instead. It was not until the Liang dynasty that the Touba clan returned, re-establishing the imperial capital. When the Zhao Emperor Zhaowu took the throne, he simply occupied the Liang palace, and so it had remained through the generations.

Within the palace's labyrinthine walls, snow fell upon the golden halls. A winter crow perched on a crossbeam, its raucous caw echoing through the grand chamber. From the distant watchtower at the gate, the crack of a horsewhip split the air.

"A report..."

"A crushing defeat at Lake Xian! Daoist Master Qi has perished!"

"The pretender Song has seized... Jianghuai!"

The voice echoed from one pavilion to the next, relayed by a succession of purple-robed eunuchs, its message surging ever upward until it reached the great hall itself.

Inside the hall, magnificent golden pillars soared toward the ceiling, their bases carved with the images of suppressed Fenglin and Flood Dragons. The chamber should have been a scene of brilliant golden splendor, yet it was inexplicably dark, a gloom so profound one could not see their own hand.

Flanking the main hall were seven high-backed lotus pedestals, each supporting a towering, ornate pagoda. Intricate carvings of wondrous, sacred lotuses adorned the structures, while beneath them, various immortals and demons were depicted in states of subjugation. A flickering radiance at the peak of each pagoda was the only source of light in the oppressive dark.

But only six of the lotus pagodas were lit, and only five had monks seated in meditation below them. Some drank wine and tore at meat, while others chanted sutras with hands clasped. Beyond these towering structures, down the steps, stood the court officials, their heads bowed low. Their black ceremonial caps seemed to melt into the shadows on the floor.

On the main throne, the Emperor of the Great Zhao sat clad in magnificent robes, cutting a majestic figure. But his face was hidden behind layers of veiled curtains, and he remained utterly motionless. To his left and right were two small tables, occupied by a monk and a Daoist.

The eunuch's report traveled up the ranks until it reached the ears of the purple-robed Daoist Master. A soft laugh escaped her throat.

"Even the Profound Governance Pavilion miscalculates sometimes."

The monks below showed varied expressions. Seated on the emperor's other side, Jiang Toushou raised an eyebrow, his cold gaze sweeping over the monk from the Way of Great Desire who was still drinking and eating.

"Tian Langzhi is a master of his craft, isn't he!" he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "What, does he think the Numinous Treasure Order is full of dead men? He knew the man's surname was Liu, yet he still had to test the waters?"

Jiang Toushou had been schemed against and sold out by Tian Langzhi during the loss of the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, and the Maha had clearly not forgiven him. His eyes were full of ice and fury. The monk below, however, just chuckled.

"Oh? It seems you, my lord, think everyone in the Way of Great Desire is already dead. We knew Cheng Xunzhi had surpassed the Purple Mystery and that the Yang clan was protecting him. Who could our Way have sent south without risking life and limb? Had Lord Tian Langzhi gone himself, who knows what kind of earth-shattering battle would have erupted, completely derailing the situation in Jianghuai. Who would have shouldered the blame then? Was sacrificing a single subordinate not enough?"

"Since the Yang clan already laid the prize out for us, their stance was clear. What was the harm in testing the waters at Tangdao Mountain? If we had succeeded in converting him, the benefits would have been immense! The Numinous Treasure Order is just too petty, unwilling to lose even a shred of face!"

The monk's rhetoric was sharp, leaving Jiang Toushou speechless. The latter shot him a disgusted look.

"This was a catastrophic defeat. The Profound Governance Pavilion must be held accountable!"

At this declaration, no one, from Zong Chang on high to the monks below, would support him. Zong Chang even laughed.

"Accountable? Do you think Wei Xuanyin will even acknowledge you?"

The cultivators were disdainful, but the emperor on the throne dared not ignore the matter. After a moment of deliberation, he spoke.

"The south is rife with schemes. The Grand Preceptor is burdened with countless duties and cannot oversee everything... This should not be held against him..."

His voice was timid and hesitant. Jiang Toushou ignored him. Having made his position clear, he turned to the others below and said flatly,

"Since Jianghuai has been lost, the pretender Song's armies are now at Chengyun, pointing like a dagger at the central plains. We must select a person of high prestige to integrate the Immortal and Buddhist Daos and lead an expedition south to prevent a sudden northward advance."

A dead silence fell over the hall.

'Qi Lanyan, a master of his caliber, perished there in an instant. Who else would dare try to stop them?'

Seeing that no one responded, Jiang Toushou continued as if he had expected as much.

"The Valiant King, Gao Fu, has a reputation for virtue and has surpassed the Purple Mystery. He should be summoned. And the Lotus Temple, being adjacent to Chengyun, should also act... to mount a coordinated defense."

He had named two of the most unpopular choices, and the assembled cultivators immediately nodded in agreement. Only Mingmeng, the Maha seated beneath the pagoda glowing with lotus-pink light, looked up to object, but he was silenced before he could speak.

"As for the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain..."

This great mountain overlooked the Luoxia Plain, a position of undeniable strategic importance. The expressions of several monks shifted as Jiang Toushou continued,

"...the Way of Great Desire and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm will make arrangements to contain it... and the great clans of the Luoxia region... cannot simply stand by and watch."

He turned to Zong Chang.

"This will require your efforts, Lady Zong!"

Hearing that she would have to deal with the great clans, Zong Chang's expression soured. This was a task that should have fallen to Gongsun Bei, but with him seriously injured, the burden fell to her. Despite her reluctance, she could only give a curt nod of assent.

Only then did the pagoda of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm flicker faintly. The monk below it clasped his hands together.

"The Song State has also lost a number of powerful Daoist Masters. They have no energy for a continued fight. As long as we make a strong showing, they will not press north."

"But... that Wei scoundrel..."

The moment the name was spoken, the entire court fell silent. Each faction wore a complex expression, and for a moment, no one spoke. Only Mingmeng broke the silence with a dramatic, feigned sigh.

"Are we all still calling him the 'Wei scoundrel'? Wouldn't 'King Wei' be more appropriate?"

"My disciple-brother was just gravely injured, and now I'm being sent to face the enemy. Whose turn will it be next? A little courtesy wouldn't hurt!"

His words left the hall simmering with a mixture of anger and speechlessness. The emperor on the throne was at a loss, looking first to his left, then to his right. After a long moment, Jiang Toushou rose to his feet, his face a cold mask of fury.

"You... you people from the Lotus Temple have the least courtesy of all, and you dare lecture us!" he spat.

Mingmeng sighed.

"How can you call it a lecture? It's about King Wei..."

"It's the Wei scoundrel!"

Jiang Toushou's roar of fury cut him off, startling the emperor behind the curtains into a violent shudder. Mingmeng simply looked to the heavens and sighed again.

"Your determination to oppose the Bright Yang is truly admirable, my lord!"

Jiang Toushou had never intended to make an enemy of the Bright Yang! The accusation was like a bucket of ice water dumped over his head. His expression changed drastically.

"Slander!"

Mingmeng shrugged.

"Then let's just call him King Wei."

...

The darkness in the sky rapidly receded. On the ground below, dense formations of troops were arrayed. The surrounding mountain forest was stained with blood. A young man walked forward on a path of True Qi, his gaze complicated.

'The Baiye region has been devastated.'

The lands of the former Xu State, anciently known as Jianghuai, were now also called Sanjiang and Sanxi. The cataclysm at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter had ruined the White River. Now, after the Zhao and Song armies had contested the Baiye region three times, sixty to seventy percent of the population was gone. Ironically, the last territory to be recovered, Baihai, was the only one with a semblance of its former population.

'Jianghuai finally has a master... but the lands of my homeland are left in ruins.'

Li Jiangliang traveled through the air, moving swiftly until he reached a ravaged mountain peak. His two elder brothers were already there, seated amidst roiling torrents of water and fire. One was bandaging a wound on his waist, the other wiping blood from his sword. The scene was surprisingly harmonious.

While the other divine ability masters had been conquering various mountain strongholds, their two armies had entered Baiye. With the fall of Jianghuai, even the Mahas were struggling to survive, let alone the Merciful One. The enemy had fled completely, allowing them to sweep through unopposed.

In the battle of Lake Xian, not only had the two brothers avoided serious injury, they had each gained considerable merit relying on their command of water and fire. Having subsequently conquered numerous territories, they were now resting their troops, an air of justified pride about them.

"Elder brothers!"

Seeing Li Jiangliang, Li Jiangxia stood up with a smile.

"Fourth Brother must have good news!"

Li Jiangliang smiled back.

"Tangdao Mountain is secure!"

Both men were seasoned commanders and understood the strategic importance of the Tangdao Mountain pass. They both broke into smiles. But Li Jiangliang's brow was furrowed with worry.

"How are Father's injuries?"

The question made both of them pause. Li Jianglong chose his words carefully. 

"We heard King Wei slew another Maha at Chengyun. He should be fine."

Li Jiangliang let out a breath of relief. His brother then asked,

"Are there any orders from the palace?"

Li Jiangliang nodded to his two brothers, a pleased look on his face.

"Tangdao is secure, Baihai is pacified, and the regions of Chengyun and Baixiang have surrendered after witnessing King Wei's might. Only Shanji is putting up a desperate resistance. I have been ordered to have all divisions gather at Baihai to regroup and receive their assignments... By my calculations, Father should be arriving in Baihai soon as well. We can go together."

He paused for a moment before continuing in a solemn tone,

"Securing Jianghuai is the top priority. As for Shanji... the Grand General will return to take it personally."

Li Jianglong nodded in agreement. Shanji had been temporarily set aside by Yang Ruiyi for the sake of the bigger picture. Even if that weren't the case, as the supreme commander of the southern campaign, it was only right that he claim the most important victory. Still, a trace of regret crossed his face.

"It's a pity... the Shu army has occupied the White River. The Sanjiang region is no longer whole..."

Li Jiangliang offered a faint smile but said nothing, merely gesturing for them to proceed. The three of them rode their True Qi into the sky, heading toward Baihai. As they neared the Xuanmiao Temple, the Grand Emissary of the Profound, a man second only to one and above ten thousand in the Song court, finally raised an eyebrow.

"The Song State will reclaim the lands of our homeland. Our armies are at the peak of their strength, and the north is unable to interfere. The matter of the White River... we will negotiate if we can. If not... we will fight."

His eyes gleamed, his entire demeanor transformed.

His two elder brothers exchanged a look, their hands itching for a fight. Each lost in his own thoughts, they fell into a shared silence as the Xuanmiao Temple appeared before them.

The temple had once stood on a perilous cliff, but now it was a scene of utter devastation. The most striking sight was not the temple itself, but an enormous mountain landscape that seemed to have fallen from the sky, pinning a mountain-sized black tiger in the sea below. The beast's body was shattered, suppressed alive in the Baihai Creek, bound by heavy chains, unable to move.

Its four limbs were broken, its teeth smashed, and it had been dragged all the way from the north. Unable to live and unable to die, it was sunk in the Baihai Creek like a trophy displayed by King Wei.

The three brothers felt a mix of emotions as they descended from the sky. They were met by a man clad in copper armor, crackling with lightning and electricity. A large bronze bell was tied at his waist, and his face was split by a hearty grin.

"Welcome, my lords!"

The greeting startled all three of them. Li Jiangliang quickly stepped forward. 

"Clan Uncle... you are too kind!"

The man guarding the location was none other than Li Zhouda, and the armored soldiers covering the mountain were all troops from Ting Province.

Li Zhouda was clearly in high spirits. He laughed loudly.

"You have all grasped the Profound. You are either Founding Dukes or Emissaries of the Profound. You've earned the title of 'my lord.'"

After a few polite exchanges, they followed him up the mountain, passing through a temporary defensive array. The view opened up before them. The once-pristine white mountain gate lay in ruins amidst a field of rubble. The two brown characters for 'Xuanmiao' were smashed to pieces, ground under a pair of spiritual boots.

Situ Huo.

Sand filled the air, and the ground was littered with pink lotus petals. The battle at Xuanmiao Temple had raged for a long time, yet the old man stood there with his hands behind his back, his expression grim. Clearly, he had failed to capture the Turbid Emptiness Liangli Maha.

On the other side, a youth in blue robes was smiling as he spoke with a Daoist Master in white and gold robes. Although Li Ximing appeared composed, the faint pallor of his face and the way his eyes kept glancing south revealed his anxiety.

Seeing the three brothers, Li Ximing visibly relaxed and hurried forward.

"Have orders arrived?" he asked urgently.

Li Jiangliang quickly returned the courtesy.

"We have received the Emperor's orders. We request an audience with King Wei!"

"He just returned from Chengyun," Li Ximing said quickly. "He's resting in the main hall. His injuries are severe. You should deliver the orders as soon as possible."

A knot of anxiety tightened in Li Jiangliang's chest. He cast aside formalities and nodded, stepping forward. But he was representing the Song Emperor. Li Jiangxia and Li Jianglong reacted instantly. One stood to the side, while the other stepped forward to push open the doors for him.

The darkness in the hall was instantly dispelled by light.

This had been the main hall of the Xuanmiao Temple, filled with Dharma lamps of all sizes. Now, all of them were extinguished, leaving only their dark bronze posts standing in the gloom. A tattered gold-patterned black robe, shredded in battle, was draped over the high seat at the head of the hall, seeming to breathe with the faint stirrings of air.

For once, King Wei was dressed in white. His eyes were closed, his long eyebrows tightly knitted together. He was leaning against the left side of the throne, one hand supporting his forehead, the other resting at his side. His chest rose and fell with powerful, even breaths, as if he were asleep.

But the half of his face turned toward the hall entrance was covered in a dense network of fractured, multicolored lines that pulsed faintly with each breath. He looked like an old, ailing suanni, dozing in the midst of its pain.

The White Qilin, who was the center of attention wherever he went, now seemed to have faded into the fabric of the hall. The palpable aura of the Bright Yang's monarchical power, that ambitious force that always surrounded him, was gone. The hall was intensely quiet, filled with a profound sense of security.

But as Li Jiangliang's gaze fell upon this scene, he froze where he stood.

Amidst the tranquility and peace, standing silently on the steps below the throne like a ghost, was a man.

He was clad in crimson-gold Daoist robes, his black hair unbound and flowing freely, giving him a dashing, unrestrained air. His long eyebrows slanted up toward his temples, and his narrow eyes held a hint of wickedness that made his calm smile seem ruthless.

He was like a venomous snake, perfectly blended with the atmosphere of the great hall. Yet his eyes, the same brilliant gold as his robes, stared directly at them, devoid of emotion but tinged with a vicious crimson hue—the sole point of terror in this sea of tranquility.

Li Jiangliang knew who he was, of course. So did his two brothers behind him.

The powerfully built, dignified general in armor suddenly tightened his grip on the hilt of his saber, his expression rigid. The calm, gentle-faced commander in robes and feathers swiftly bowed his head, his eyes filled with disbelief.

'Elder Brother.'

In the dim hall, it felt as though only that crimson light was moving. The composure of a man who commanded the court and established the rites of the state was gone. The dominance of a man who pacified regions and rode roughshod over Baiye had vanished. The three Holders of the Profound lost their presence, reduced to their former selves. It was as if they were back in the golden hall on the lake, with this elder brother standing so naturally before their father, and them, standing below.

But things were vastly different now.

Before, Li Jiangqian had stood before their father, facing him, showing them only his back, a figure they could gaze upon freely. Now, with their father injured, Li Jiangqian had turned around. He stood guard by the bedside, his back to his father, standing squarely in the center, silently watching them.

This watchfulness, now without the oversight of Li Zhouwei, filled Li Jiangliang with an uncontrollable fear. The weaker their father behind his elder brother seemed, the more he blended into the hall's serenity, the stronger that fear became. It terrified Li Jiangliang, who had never known such self-doubt.

'What is happening?'

Even more unsettled were his two brothers behind him.

Third Brother Li Jiangxia's courage began to falter. The five fingers gripping his saber hilt tightened until his knuckles were white. Second Brother Li Jianglong shut his eyes tightly, as if trying to bury his head in his chest. This had nothing to do with bravery; neither brother would have bowed their head so easily even before a Great Daoist Master. But this moment was profoundly strange.

Li Jiangliang stood there, frozen, until the ailing suanni on the throne slowly opened its multicolored eyes.

"Cough..."

Li Jiangqian flicked his sleeves, turned, and knelt respectfully.

"Father... your sons are here."

As their elder brother turned away, the terrifying pressure that had filled the hall suddenly vanished. The past few moments felt like a dream. The sounds of wind and people returned, and only then did Li Jiangxia realize the hall hadn't been silent at all. His hand relaxed its grip on his saber.

King Wei's eyes were so full of color that it was impossible to read his expression. His voice was steady.

"Are there orders?"

Li Jiangliang stepped forward and said respectfully,

"There is a verbal edict. For the matter of Jianghuai, King Wei is to act at his own discretion. If you have the strength to spare, you may request the Ting Province army to surround Profound Peak to bolster our position. If your illness is severe, we hope King Wei will focus on recuperation and return to his duties as regent soon."

He paused slightly before kneeling on one knee and producing a gold and jade box from his sleeve.

"The Emperor heard that King Wei was afflicted by Wu Earth. Considering the difficulty of curing such a flaw, he has personally bestowed a piece of Chuchun Hanging Wood, in the hope that Your Highness recovers swiftly and may once again campaign against Zhao and Shu."

Clearly, the Song Emperor had kept his word, even granting him immense freedom and offering aid. This brought a measure of peace to Li Zhouwei's features. 

"Jianghuai is not yet pacified; I am unworthy of His Majesty's grace," he said politely. "For now, we await the Grand General's return to pacify Shanji together."

Li Jiangqian raised his sleeves and took the jade box from Li Jiangliang, presenting it to his father. Li Jiangliang then added,

"This son also has the edicts for the enfeoffment of the various surrendering ministers. Does Father wish to..."

Seeing King Wei wave a dismissive hand, Li Jiangqian nodded and stepped forward.

"Father is unwell. I shall oversee the ceremony in his stead."

Li Jiangliang nodded, as expected. This brought a slight smile to Li Jiangqian's face. But then his fourth brother looked up, hesitating for a moment.

"Congratulations, Elder Brother... on achieving your divine ability!"

Li Jiangqian's gaze lingered on his face for a moment before shifting to his other two brothers. They both clasped their hands in a salute. 

"Congratulations, Elder Brother!"

"Haha."

Li Jiangqian let out two short laughs without any further comment. He ushered them out and shut the hall doors firmly, leaving Li Zhouwei alone on the throne. The king closed his eyes once more.

A mysterious Daoist rhythm resonated in his heart.

Illuminating Sun and Moon!

The gains from this battle had been immense. He had been resting here for nearly half a day and was still caught in the dizzying, profound rhythm of the Dao. He had no choice but to keep his eyes closed.

'Qi Lanyan, a direct disciple of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao with three divine abilities... Helian Wujiang, the ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom, also with three divine abilities... just these two alone represent an unprecedented harvest. Compared to them, Bashan was merely a bonus.'

Although the power levels Chen Yin had outlined years ago were imprecise, with heaven-and-earth differences between each level that grew to absurd proportions later on, it could not diminish the sheer scale of his current gains.

His Dao-Profundity had long since crossed the Purple Mystery threshold—a chasm in the eyes of the world—and surpassed that of ordinary Great Daoist Masters. By Li Zhouwei's own estimation, he had far exceeded most of the cultivators on the lake. Figures like Touba Ci and Gongsun Bei were left far behind in his dust. Even based on his brief exchange in battle, a disciple from a major sect like Qi Lanyan was a notch below him.

At this level, the number of cultivators in Jiangnan whose Dao-Profundity surpassed his could be counted on one hand.

His peers would have to be Great Daoist Masters from Golden Core Dao Lineages like Changxiao or Chi Buzi, or perhaps figures from legacies like Penglai.

'So this is what it means to be a Great Daoist Master... but I've fought too few of them. I've never crossed swords with Chi Buzi or Changxiao, the examples Chen Yin gave me, and they wouldn't have remained stagnant. It's hard to gauge the gap between us...'

The immediate effect, however, was a significant increase in the power of his many spell arts and a more natural flow in the operation of his Spiritual Artifacts. And, of course—the divine abilities in his body.

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass at his brow glowed faintly. The light of the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' circulated with greater freedom and brilliance. A dark world manifested, but it did not expand, remaining tightly contained within three inches of his body. A setting sun, golden and crimson, hung behind him.

The suppression of the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' had become more effective and subtle. Li Zhouwei breathed a sigh of relief and slowly closed his eyes, sensing the profound Daoist rhythms continuously welling up in his mind. The world before him seemed to be slowly lifting a veil, becoming ever clearer. Yet when he looked within, the calamity inside his body appeared even more complex.

When Li Zhouwei had arrived, Li Ximing, hearing he was injured, had rushed over immediately. With Li Ximing's skill in the Dao of alchemy, he could devise a solution for most injuries as long as there was a breath of life left. But faced with this calamity, he was helpless.

Ultimately, it wasn't like an injury at all. It was more like a kind of resonance, a catastrophic fate that had descended upon his body, constantly generating destructive Wu Light, seemingly without end.

'A little over a day left.'

He had pacified the north and then rushed back here. As long as he could stabilize himself and suppress the calamity within his body, he could temporarily halt the increase in its power...

'In that case, I just need to suppress my injuries here and wait for Yang Ruiyi to set up the northern defense line and withdraw the army. There should be more than enough time...'

Li Zhouwei exhaled and opened the jade box. Looking at the gleaming piece of Horn Wood resting inside, he felt a strange emotion.

'Truly worthy of being called the Flawless Wu Earth. The tenacity of this calamity is ranked among the highest in the world. Even someone as esteemed as the Song Emperor has no perfect solution and can only choose the best of the lesser options, offering a piece of Horn Wood.'

But something was better than nothing. A spiritual item like Horn Wood was precious. It would have to be given to Li Ximing to maximize its effectiveness. He put it away for now and raised an eyebrow slightly, his gaze drifting toward the hall's window.

The colors in the distance were dim and heavy, but he could still see the jade-white radiance continuously falling, reflecting the multicolored light in his own eyes. King Wei's lips moved.

'Cut from the same cloth.'




# Chapter 1164: The Siege of the Mountain

The sky flickered with multicolored light before a tide of dark, heavy fog finally rolled in. One after another, divine abilities began to converge on Xuanmiao Temple. A young man in black robes took a step through the clouds and saw a woman in purple. "How is Wenqing?" he asked, his voice laced with anxiety.

Tinglan’s face was still pale.

"Her injuries are too severe," she said simply. "Her spiritual body was nearly destroyed, and her divine ability was damaged as well… She’s been sent back to the blessed lands to recover."

Lin Chensheng fell silent at the news. Tinglan quickly added,

"Fortunately, the Emperor sent someone with a spiritual treasure. It was rushed to the blessed lands, and her condition has stabilized. That's the only reason I dared to come."

On the surface, the Bureau of Immortal Rites was impartial, but every great family knew the truth: the Yang family's favoritism toward the Purple Smoke Gate was blatant. It far surpassed their regard for even the former high official, Sima Yuanli, to say nothing of anyone else. Both had been injured, yet Lingu Lanying was simply sent off to Linhai with no further word on her condition. For the Purple Smoke Gate, however, aid was dispatched without delay.

Seeing the oppressive black qi rising from the north, Lin Chensheng's voice dropped.

"Any other casualties?"

"Many were wounded… There was one, Si Xunhui, on the brink of death… but Lingu Lanying saved him. Sima Yuanli owes her a great debt."

Tinglan answered curtly as the sky rapidly grew dark. A bronze pavilion materialized in the heavens, from which they could hear a young man below reciting a decree:

"Daoist Master Changyun, for supporting order and quelling chaos, for the great merit of pacifying Baihai, shall retain his Daoist standing in Chengshui Marsh. He is granted an honorary position in the Bureau of Immortal Rites to watch over his ancestral lands. The rogue cultivator Bai Ziyu of the Capital Immortals Dao, for heeding the call of the Bright Yang and intercepting the two Buddhist factions, is hereby enfeoffed in Baiye as King Duyè, his glory to shine upon the Martial Cultivation Star."

"Protector-General Liu Bai fell in service to the state. His merit was high and his loyalty profound, and his deeds are remembered in the Emperor's heart. Let the finest of the Liu Clan's descendants enter the palace as Holders of the Profound and inherit the title of Protector-General, enfeoffed as a Duke… Daoist Master Xianyao, who defended his lands without fear of death, is granted a Spiritual Artifact and enfeoffed as the Military Commissioner of Baihai. His seat at Overlook Peak shall be registered with the Bureau of Immortal Rites."

"The Azure Pond and Purple Smoke sects, for their meritorious service in defending the nation, shall see all their Daoist Masters within the Bureau of Immortal Rites receive an advancement of one rank and be granted Spiritual Artifacts. The Xiukui Dao achieved a great victory at Linhai and served with merit at Lake Xian; their disciples shall be elevated to serve in the Purple and Gold Palace. As for the various kings and marquises within the realm, they are all to return to the Imperial Capital to report their accomplishments…"

Li Jiangliang, holding a golden scroll, briefly outlined the rewards for the various individuals and sects. A chorus of thanks rose from the divine abilities in the sky as he finished. But then, Yehui stepped forward and bowed deeply.

"The merit belongs to King Wei," he proclaimed. "For a sinner such as myself to receive this heavenly grace brings me to tears… I dare not accept the title of king… I only wish to serve within the Bureau of Immortal Rites, and for my disciples to enter the court and pledge their loyalty to Fengzhen, to repay the boundless grace of the True Qi!"

At his words, Li Jiangliang paused, raising an eyebrow toward the carriage shrouded in black, ominous qi. An ear twitched. He then rolled up the decree.

"Your will shall be conveyed to the palace, Daoist Master. We await the Emperor's sacred judgment!"

Yehui nodded politely, showing no hint of awkwardness. Still, the bronze carriage above remained silent. The masters waited a full breath before a man finally emerged.

This person wore a feathered robe with a diamond pattern, his cultivation at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, his divine ability profound and powerful. With a deep smile in his eyes, he bowed low.

"This subordinate has presumptuously received Heaven's grace and has something to offer in celebration of the Great Song."

The nether-carriage hummed, and Yang Ruiyi's calm voice drifted out.

"Speak, Daoist Master."

Daoist Master Changyun glanced around the assembly.

"Jianghuai is pacified, but Baijiang was stolen. The war has just ended, and our masters are weary; it is not the time for a conflict with the Western Shu. This humble one hails from the Eastern Sea, and Golden Oneness is an old friend. I am willing to travel to Shu myself and persuade the tribes of the Golden Feather. I will surely talk them into returning Baijiang as an offering, securing the territory without shedding a single drop of blood!"

His declaration was met with dead silence.

Several of the masters present were still unaware of Zhang Yun’s true identity and wore thoughtful expressions. Even those from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, who might have expected something like this, now frowned deeply.

Tinglan and Lin Chensheng exchanged a look, the surprise in their eyes mutual.

'Baijiang is the last strategic point controlling Jianghuai. Now that the Western Shu has it, they won't let go until they've squeezed every last drop of value from it. Why would they return it so easily?'

The masters remained silent. The man in the bronze hall, however, seemed unsurprised. His voice held a hint of feigned delight as he said,

"Then we shall trouble you, Daoist Master. If you succeed, it will be recorded as a great merit, and you shall enter the palace as a Holder of the Profound."

Daoist Master Changyun's expression remained unchanged. He nodded with a smile, then stepped into the Great Void and vanished. Yang Ruiyi immediately changed the subject, issuing new orders for the future.

"Yehui, Zhaojing, and Qiuhu will garrison the northern side of Baihai at Changhe Mountain, which will serve as the border of the Zhao-Song. They will keep watch over Chengyun. Situ Huo, Zhonggong, and Jiuwen will defend Tangdao Mountain. Sima Yuanli, Tinglan…"

He paused for a moment before continuing in a low, ghostly voice, "You two will lead the Holders of the Profound. Follow King Wei and me. We are going to break Shanji."

The Daoist Masters acknowledged their orders, and the divine abilities in the sky dispersed. The Celestial Gate in the sea began to move slowly. At last, King Wei descended from the great hall. Yang Ruiyi, from his nether-carriage, lifted the curtain.

"Please," he said politely.

The Celestial Gate swept up the remaining divine abilities. Li Ximing sighed and, along with Li Jiangqian, escorted their king southward. The other three sons, however, followed the nether-carriage.

"Jianglong," Yang Ruiyi called out, "how are your injuries? Come up and speak with me."

Clearly, Yang Ruiyi held a fondness for Li Jianglong, the man he had personally promoted, summoning him alone to ride with him. The young man immediately bowed and entered the carriage, finally coming face-to-face with the Grand General.

Yang Ruiyi’s aura was heavy, and there was little joy in his expression. He glanced at Li Jianglong and frowned.

"Why are you so distracted? How are your father’s injuries?"

"They are not severe at the moment," Li Jianglong replied, cupping his hands.

In truth, Li Jianglong's heart had not been calm since leaving the great hall. A seed of doubt had been planted, and his thoughts were so heavy that Yang Ruiyi had noticed. But it was a matter he could not speak of openly, so he could only shake his head in silence.

Yang Ruiyi didn't press him. After a long, deep look, he said abruptly,

"Now that Jianghuai is pacified, it is time for me to lay down my command."

The words, though spoken plainly, made the young man's head snap up. A tremor went through him. He lowered his gaze and replied,

"Grand General, you have just achieved a peerless victory. This is your moment of greatest triumph. The Northern Zhao are resentful, and the Western Shu watch us like tigers… We still need you to command the overall situation!"

Yang Ruiyi smiled. He sat to one side of the carriage and pushed the curtain aside, gazing at the Exiled Qi outside, so thick it seemed tangible. The weariness in his features deepened.

"I entered the court to serve as a general—the Grand General for the Pacification of Huai. Now… Jianghuai is subdued, the Sword Gate has submitted, and the two major cultivation paths have joined the court. The forces under my command are more than sufficient to hold Jianghuai. It is the perfect time to step away."

"There will be no major wars for the next few decades. It’s just enough time for me to get out and pass this Purple Mystery trial."

"Congratulations, General!"

Li Jianglong's face lit up with genuine surprise. Yang Ruiyi simply waved it away, a profound look in his eyes.

"Whether I succeed or not, my duty from now on will be to guard against the Western Shu. All of you will be reassigned to the Huai region, each under new command. You've served under me for many years, always with diligence and dedication, and you've endured your share of hardship…"

Li Jianglong quickly shook his head, about to speak, but the Grand General cut him off. Yang Ruiyi looked at him with a complex expression.

"I'm a soft-hearted man. Since you've been with me for so long, I ought to give you a bit of advice before we part… Your destiny is tied to the matter of the Bright Yang. If you cannot overcome this tribulation, you will surely die under the Heavenly Light. Only by passing through it can you hope for a new beginning."

Li Jianglong looked up, his golden eyes staring blankly. He seemed to have never expected any guidance from the great general of the Yang family. Yang Ruiyi, however, continued to gaze outside as the waves of Lake Xian slowly faded from view.

"I have met that older brother of yours. He is also not one to bend the knee."

He turned his head slightly, his voice dropping to a near whisper.

"It is best, of course, that your father remains. But if one day he is gone, you all must find your own path. The matter of the Bright Yang is one of a monarch and a father. And as the old saying goes, 'An elder brother is like a father'… You must consider this carefully… Certain things that happened in the Wei court back then… could happen now in King Wei's court."

His words were brutally clear. Li Jianglong lowered his head. The scene from the great hall still burned in his mind's eye. The stronger his father's cultivation grew, the closer he drew to the Bright Yang. Certain omens appeared on their own, prompting a dark question to form in Li Jianglong's heart.

'If one day Father perishes in his pursuit of the Bright Yang, and Li Jiangqian finds a powerful new patron—say, he joins the Buddhists—would he slaughter his own brothers to secure his own fate?'

The answer was terrifyingly clear. He bowed his head in acknowledgment. Before him, Yang Ruiyi said no more. He stared at the immortal peaks in the distance and let out a long breath.

"The Profound Peak Gate."

There was no trace of emotion in his eyes as he watched one divine ability after another flare into existence. Billowing purple qi and the dark, cyan light of the 'Upright Wood' illuminated the sky. The magnificent Celestial Gate officially descended at the foot of the mountain.

Yang Ruiyi lifted the curtain and stepped out. He looked at the profound mountain that had resisted his efforts for more than a decade, a place he had never managed to breach. With a light toss, a treasured cauldron flew from his hand. As it rose, millions of bolts of lightning from all sides crashed down in unison. There were no calls for surrender, no threats. Only his cold voice echoed through the air.

"Attack."

…

The Exiled Qi was as thick as ink, spilling over from the north to swallow the light of the sun and moon, plunging the world into a darkness so complete you couldn't see your own hand. One by one, lights flickered to life on the mountain, providing a final, fragile illumination.

A heavy silence hung before the highest cave-abode. A middle-aged man knelt on the stone steps, his face a mosaic of light and shadow in the faint lamplight, making him appear dazed.

Kong Xiaxiang remembered kneeling here before. It had been another dark and utterly silent night. The men from the Sacred Writ Gate had broken his teeth, and he had escaped under the cover of darkness to kneel in this very spot, trembling.

It was then that Daoist Master Zhaojing had happened to pass by. Kong Xiaxiang still remembered his words.

"Then kneel. Endure it, and you will no longer be afraid."

'Daoist Master Zhaojing.'

He looked up. There, beneath the Celestial Gate that pulsed with the light of divine abilities amidst the black fog, he saw the master in the pale golden Daoist robes. He looked exactly the same as all those years ago. Kong Xiaxiang was deeply grateful to him; it was just that the Kong family was no longer the one sheltered by the Bright Yang's divine ability.

He pressed his forehead to the ground once more, listening to the faint sounds from above.

An old man was crying.

Ever since the Profound Peak Gate had been restored, Kong Guxi had not cried. He had said that the years of wandering had drained his blood, that his tears could fill a cistern. Back then, Kong Xiaxiang had beaten his chest and promised,

"I will never let our ancestor cry again."

But now, in the pitch-black night, the old man was weeping again. These were not the tears of grief, shame, hatred, or regret from fifty-four years ago. It was a low, unconscious sobbing. The old man still felt he had failed—failed the Daoist Master who had given everything to protect the Profound Peak Gate, the man whose very bones had been lost on their lands.

His turbid, tear-filled eyes were downcast. A hot tear fell onto the golden casket in his hands, making it feel exceptionally cold. It contained Changxi's ceremonial robes, which should have been in the ancestral hall. But Kong Guxi had retrieved it during the night.

'The Yang family's hatred for me runs too deep,' he had thought, tears streaming down his face. 'When the Song army enters the mountain, they will surely desecrate my ancestral temple…'

He thought, 'I would rather die wearing these robes than allow them to be shamed by another!'

Outside, the clamor of divine abilities grew more terrifying, like the world's end, shaking the grand protective array until it groaned. Qi Lanyan's brilliant formation was only prolonging the inevitable, forcing everyone within to stew in a mixture of terror and despair.

"BOOM!"

A brilliant flash of lightning tore through the night, illuminating a woman's eyes. Kong Tingyun sat quietly before the cave-abode, watching the apocalyptic scene unfold in the heavens.

'Even Qi Lanyan has fallen.'

She gave a short, bitter laugh and poured herself a full cup of wine. She glanced at the weeping old man, then at the silent junior kneeling on the ground. She rose, drained her cup in one gulp, and said,

"We deserved this."

Her words were a hammer blow that shattered the last thread of composure in Kong Xiaxiang's heart. He had thought that after so many trials, he had become strong enough to face anything. But now, tears streamed down his face.

"This is not your fault, Daoist Master!"

Kong Tingyun shook her head, tear tracks marking her own beautiful face.

"The Song court has hated me for years. With the gate broken, I cannot hope to live. I only pray the Grand General has the virtue to spare others and punish only the leaders."

She removed a necklace and placed it in Kong Xiaxiang's hand.

"This was a gift from the Great Daoist Master of the Profound Governance Pavilion," she wept. "It is a precious Spiritual Artifact. I thought of the Daoist Master's old relic, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, which is still with Daoist Master Zhaojing. I tried many times to arrange an exchange, but because of the divide between north and south, I never even had the chance to meet him… It was not meant to be."

"Years ago, I knew my time was short. I wanted to use this to trade for a favor, to protect our descendants, but no one dared accept it. It has remained with me until today."

"Daoist Master Zhaojing has old ties to our Kong Clan. He might be able to persuade them to spare our disciples. Let him take them in… Take this, give it to one of the youngest disciples. If the chance arises, deliver it to Daoist Master Zhaojing and beg for his protection…"

Kong Xiaxiang was sobbing too hard to reply. He knew how slim the chances were of saving the Kong Clan. Kong Tingyun, however, showed little weakness. With a tone of regret, she said,

"My only regret is that the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains dies with me!"

"BOOM!"

A terrifying bolt of lightning slammed into the array. The massive impact shook the forest, and a silvery-white light bleached every corner of the mountain. Kong Guxi's face was deathly pale. He held up the golden casket and cried out,

"Daoist Master!"

Kong Tingyun gave him a gentle, tear-filled look. She took the casket from his hands and, stepping onto a trail of brownish-yellow light, ascended. She rose through the layers of clouds and fog, passed through the vibrant, multicolored array, and came to a stop before the raging lightning.

Instantly, the lightning ceased. The black fog froze. Heaven and Earth fell silent. Cold, hateful, pitiful, and sorrowful gazes all fell upon her.

Kong Tingyun said faintly, "I have come to die."




# Chapter 1165: Gehu Peak

The sky was black. The mountain gate of the Profound Peak Sect lay prostrate upon the earth like a colossal, dying beast. The fractured light of its protective arrays showered down, yet the sheer vastness of the black clouds overhead made the sprawling gate seem insignificant.

Above, a host of violet-robed figures stood arrayed like divine soldiers besieging a demonic citadel, their presence casting a grim shadow over all.

Kong Tingyun's gaze was serene as she scanned each one of them, feeling neither hatred nor resentment. Only when her eyes fell upon a Daoist in white-gold robes did a flicker of gratitude appear in their depths.

Li Ximing stood beneath the infinitely radiant Celestial Gate, his features etched with a somber melancholy. The young attendant beside him clutched an urn, not daring to speak. Sensing the gaze from the mountain below, the Daoist Master shifted his eyes toward Li Zhouwei.

King Wei sat enthroned in the center of the Celestial Gate, a burning, multicolored light in his eyes. He remained silent.

Thunder rolled at the zenith. From a dark palace in the clouds, the terrifying light of a divine ability pulsed. A figure addressed as the Great General held a golden scroll, his expression solemn. Yet, his voice was cold and detached, as if echoing from the Underworld itself.

"Our tradition commands the True Yang and inherits the imperial line. Our virtue is supreme. Where we pass, great clans are crowned as kings and the Immortal Dao basks in our light. Thus have the southern lands submitted, none daring to harbor thoughts of defiance."

"Only you, of the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains, illicitly occupy the former lands of Yue and collude with cultivators from the north. This general was dispatched with a host of mortals and cultivators to deliver this decree, hoping to minimize bloodshed. Yet the Kong Clan has grown ever more defiant and mad. Stubborn and unenlightened, you have thrice defied the divine tradition and repeatedly rejected the True Light of Martial Cultivation."

Yang Ruiyi had already stepped out from the main hall. He raised an eyebrow and declared in a frigid tone,

"Since Martial Cultivation will not be tamed, today, we bring slaughter."

His voice was ice. The roiling Exiled Qi in the sky parted, revealing a single point of white light. It belonged to an object with a narrow neck and a mouth, like a bottle yet not a bottle. It had an angular body and a pointed base, like an awl yet not an awl. Its entire form was a muddled white, as if crafted from ceramic. A strange light seemed to be contained within, spraying out streams of white mist that forced the Exiled Qi back, carving a perfect circle of empty space in the sky.

In an instant, heaven and earth were bleached of color. Everyone stared in shocked disbelief, even King Wei averting his gaze to focus on the artifact.

The object bore no markings or inscriptions, yet a name echoed in the minds of all who saw it.

"The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel!"

The woman—Kong Tingyun—also looked up. Her turquoise ritual robes whipped and billowed in the gale, her expression dazed. The clouds beneath her feet scattered rapidly as she stared blankly at the artifact.

'More than two hundred years of bitter cultivation, and I still couldn't escape this prison. All for it to end in death before this… thing!'

Before the overwhelming True Qi, she slowly closed her eyes.

But the howling wind lasted only a moment. The cataclysmic pain she anticipated never came. Instead, an uncanny silence fell, and a cool sensation washed over her.

Kong Tingyun opened her eyes.

Clouds surged up from below like pouncing beasts, shrouding the mountaintop. A man in white stood quietly before her. The pale light of his divine ability was so dense it seemed to solidify, forming luminous rings that hovered behind him.

His mere presence exuded a transcendent aura of Veiled Yin. His unbound black hair streamed high in the wind. The wooden pin that had once secured his crown was gone, now held in his hands clasped behind his back, where it pulsed with a faint, heroic white light.

Wei Xuanyin!

The moment this Great Daoist Master of the Guanhua Dao Lineage appeared, the divine abilities emanating from the south contracted, retreating in haste. Yang Ruiyi stared in disbelief. Li Ximing, however, looked as if he were facing a formidable enemy, his wary gaze fixed on the newcomer as he shielded the person behind him.

The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel still hung in the sky, unmoving. It drifted among the currents of True Qi, appearing exceptionally noble.

Kong Tingyun's mind raced. In the one-in-ten-thousand chance of survival she'd clung to, she had even imagined Wang Ziya might intervene. But she had never, ever considered it would be him. This Great Daoist Master, who always cultivated in seclusion within the Profound Governance Pavilion, had met her only once. She had long since put him out of her mind.

Yet, impossibly, Wei Xuanyin was here. The sight left Kong Tingyun bewildered.

'What possible use could he still have for me?'

But Kong Tingyun was not the only one in disbelief. Every gaze in the sky shifted. Yang Ruiyi's expression darkened at an unprecedented rate, his lips trembling as the shock and fury in his heart reached a boiling point.

'How did he get in? Was he hiding here all along? What kind of concealment art could possibly evade the senses of the Hall of Profound Spirit-Cleansing! His Dao-Profundity in the Veiled Yin... it must have reached perfection!'

'But... how could he dare?'

The thought consumed him. Yang Ruiyi had never dreamed Wei Xuanyin would interfere. In his eyes, Wei Xuanyin's actions were even more insane than Qi Lanyan's had been.

'This is the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel!'

The Vessel was one of three imperial artifacts of True Qi, and the one in the sky was the very foundation of the Song State. It had never been used in previous conflicts, not because it lacked power or prestige, but precisely because it was too precious! All three artifacts were linked to the life-mandate of the Song Emperor. Just as the Emperor himself had to endlessly accumulate his power and could never afford defeat, once the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel was unleashed, it could not be allowed to fail!

'Wei Xuanyin must have timed his appearance a half-step early... he knew that once this artifact descended, there would be no turning back!'

Even so, an uncontrollable rage surged through Yang Ruiyi at the thought of him meddling in the affairs of Shanji.

'What is he trying to accomplish? Isn't it enough? He knows full well the northern cultivators can't get another inch of land from Jiangnan, yet he insists on maintaining this farce just to spite my Yang Clan?!'

But for all his fury, he found he could not bring himself to act rashly.

Wei Xuanyin was the current Dao Lord of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao and the master of the Profound Governance Pavilion. Since the Middle Ages, the Guanhua Dao Lineage had been in decline, which paradoxically made him all the more valuable.

'More importantly... he is held in high regard by certain powers.'

Yang Ruiyi finally managed to swallow his anger.

"Fellow Daoist Wei," he said lightly, "aren't you overstepping your bounds?"

His words dissipated in the air. Wei Xuanyin did not turn to look at Kong Tingyun. Instead, he scanned the host of enemies surrounding him, showing no trace of alarm.

"Tingyun once paid her respects at Profound Governance. She is, after all, of the direct lineage of Comprehending Profoundity. Ultimately, it was my Profound Governance that used her to interfere in the south's affairs. Today... I cannot simply stand by and watch her die."

His statement was worlds apart from Qi Lanyan's previous claim of her being a 'descendant of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition.' It made Yang Ruiyi realize his intentions were hostile. Anger seethed within him as he said softly,

"Direct lineage? Didn't one of them just fall over Lake Xian?"

Wei Xuanyin's expression grew complicated.

"Bright Yang was his tribulation. He has passed it."

Yang Ruiyi didn't dwell on the cryptic reply, assuming it was just some empty rhetoric borrowed from the Northern Buddhists. His grip tightened on the small cauldron in his hand. Wei Xuanyin turned his head slightly and spoke to Kong Tingyun, his voice gentle.

"Tingyun, the fate of the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains is exhausted. What was borrowed must now be returned. But you are one of my disciples, and I cannot watch you throw your life away. Renounce this mortal inheritance, and I will take you back to Profound Governance."

Hearing this, Kong Tingyun froze in disbelief. She raised her head to meet Wei Xuanyin's clear, placid eyes, and understanding bloomed within her.

'The powerful name our ancestor used to bluff his way... it was exactly what the north needed at the time. Our relationship with Profound Governance was one of mutual convenience... we were never truly acknowledged, and we certainly couldn't withstand the Yang Clan's wrath...'

'But whether out of pity or for the sake of appearances, he, Wei Xuanyin, treated me as a true descendant of the Comprehending Profoundity lineage. That was the only reason the Zhaoyao Mountain genealogy was ever brought out... The other figures from that lineage who deigned to speak with me later only did so out of respect for him.'

Her last shred of doubt shattered.

'It seems... he didn't act because he still has a use for me...'

Kong Tingyun had her epiphany. But there were no fools present; every onlooker grew pensive. Yang Ruiyi was stunned, more than half of his anger vanishing in an instant. His cold eyes stared straight at Kong Tingyun, his intention unmistakable.

'Then let's see if he can truly protect you!'

Under the intense scrutiny of all, Kong Tingyun's eyes began to well with tears. She lowered her gaze slightly and saw the old elder standing on the mountaintop. He was on his knees, his face a mask of laughter and tears, nodding at her insistently, urging her to escape.

But Kong Tingyun understood everything now.

When she'd had her breakthrough, her master, Daoist Master Changxi, had already been dead for years. But the stories had reached her one by one. She knew her elder had done everything in his power for her—from faking the identities of two Purple Mansion Realm candidates to sacrificing Kong Haiying, from securing a future bloodline to seeking aid from the Li Clan... no one could have done more.

She vaguely remembered Changxi pressing the Roaming Pass Treasured Earth into her hands and personally leading her into seclusion within the earth veins of Baihai Creek. His aged eyes had been filled with hope as he entrusted her with his legacy.

"The Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains is my life's work. The revival of the Kong Clan... rests solely on you!"

Kong Tingyun's face had been streaked with tears then, but she had no idea what intricate and ruthless schemes her elder was still plotting.

To help her break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Changxi had borrowed the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain, a treasure of Bound Earth, from the Sword Gate. He intended for it to resonate with the Treasured Earth she possessed, completing the final step of her ascension!

A 'treasure' is that which is stored away. 'Treasured Earth' is earth that receives and holds potential, allowing it to nurture all life. Kong Tingyun had hidden herself deep within the earth veins, brewing her divine ability in perfect concert with the concept of Treasured Earth. But... it hadn't been enough.

According to the information she had gathered, Daoist Master Changxi must have spent years painstakingly embedding the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain into his own Shengyang Acupoint. He concealed it as a second manifestation of Treasured Earth, merging it with his own body. He carved countless runes into his Dharma Body so that, at the moment of his death, he could operate the Spiritual Artifact with his last ounce of strength!

Daoist Master Changxi... he had practically been blown apart from the inside by the Spiritual Artifact's power!

Every time she recalled this, Kong Tingyun could not stop herself from weeping.

The spectacle of his death had served as a cover, concealing the cataclysmic tremors of the Spiritual Artifact's activation. The true form of the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain was hidden beneath that illusion of quaking Bound Earth. His Dharma Body, meticulously prepared over decades, had contained the artifact's mountain-like true form, hiding it beneath Gehu Peak. This was the third manifestation of Treasured Earth!

And Daoist Master Sumian, without a moment's rest, had immediately set up formations on the mountain to mask any lingering anomalies. Over a long period, the entirety of Daoist Master Changxi's life's cultivation was converted into the fuel for Kong Tingyun's breakthrough.

To put it bluntly, her path—the divine ability of triple-layered, concealed earth—from the Roaming Pass Treasured Earth to the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain, had been painstakingly paved for her by him. He had spent countless years poring over ancient texts and formulating his grand design.

'Yes... he wasn't a good man... He once held wicked intentions, attempting to refine humans into pills. Fu Yuezi was even meant to be one of his ingredients, but a warning from a powerful figure made him abandon that path forever... Yet his schemes, his arrangements... they were second to none in this age. He simply lacked a true path to walk!'

'Hardship is a lake, and this peak separates us from it... That was once my master's proud boast, made in his prime when he achieved his divine ability and befriended Senior Sumian. In the end... his words came true.'

Her expression was desolate and cold. Stepping forward into the tense atmosphere, she walked to stand before the Great Daoist Master. Under the watchful eyes of all, her slender hands closed around the hilt of her sword and drew the blade.

"Shhhnnk!"

With a twist of her wrist, she pressed the cold steel against her own neck.

'Daoist Master... I... cannot leave.'

The Kong Clan, the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains... it was all Kong Yanxi's life's work, entrusted to her. If she fled, she would save herself, but what of her disciples? What of her sect?

Wei Xuanyin had been perfectly clear:

"Renounce this mortal inheritance, and I will take you back to Profound Governance."

Just a mortal inheritance!

As powerful as this Great Daoist Master was, saving her alone would be his absolute limit. The Profound Peak Gate, left behind, would surely face the unstoppable wrath of the Great Song. And it wouldn't just be the Profound Peak Gate, but the entire Kong Clan! Everyone on the mountain, young and old, even Kong Gumo cultivating in seclusion overseas—all would be annihilated by the Yang Clan's fury.

And so, she raised her sword.

The act was like a thunderclap. Shocked and complex gazes fell upon her. The glint of the blade, the familiar posture—it was like a dagger twisting in Yang Ruiyi's eyes, melting their icy coldness and replacing it with a painful throb.

The thunder ceased. The cold of the Veiled Yin deepened. Li Ximing's expression was fraught with emotion; he seemed to want to speak but held his tongue. The grand, terrible momentum of the moment had reached its apex. All light seemed to converge on her face as she parted her lips.

"My crimes are immense. I offer my head to appease your wrath. May the Celestial Dynasty show mercy and cherish life. The Kong Clan is innocent! The Kong Clan... is innocent..."

Her words shook the heavens. The roiling white mist in the sky rapidly receded. The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel seemed to acknowledge her sacrifice; its profound True Qi flowed back into the vessel before it vanished behind the veil of Exiled Qi.

Yang Ruiyi closed his eyes. The powerful figures arrayed in the sky lowered their gazes. Even Wei Xuanyin looked up, his composure shattered by the sword. His eyes held no pity, no surprise—only a profound and sorrowful respect.

"BOOM!"

A deafening thunderclap echoed as silver light flooded the land. Reflected on the edge of her blade was the old man, kneeling and weeping on the ground. But his shadow was instantly washed away by a boundless radiance of Bound Earth that erupted from her.

The Bound Earth collapsed. The profound mountain crumbled. Kong Tingyun's life force poured out of her like light. Her delicate face fractured, and multicolored light burst from the tips of her hair as her features aged beyond recognition. The golden case at her waist vibrated, its lid sliding open. A wild gust of wind brutally ripped the pale Daoist robe from within, letting it unfurl in the reflection of her fading, gray eyes.

In the last embers of her life, Kong Tingyun willed the disintegrating light of Bound Earth to part around the white robe. She let it tumble and fly, a free and graceful thing, into the boundless forest, where it became a single speck of white in the oppressive dark.

The erupting light of Bound Earth solidified into stone, piling up as the land itself fell apart. In the darkness, the earth trembled and new mountains surged upward. A sudden, thick fog billowed out, spreading from the ruins all the way to the edge of the Exiled Qi.

The Profound Peak Sect was no more.




# Chapter 1166: A Lonely End

The Exiled Qi churned ceaselessly in the sky. Amidst the mountains, the colors grew faint, sinking into an absolute darkness. Without the protection of the great array, the mysterious power of the Exiled Qi had already submerged the forest, cutting off all spiritual sense.

An icy chill crept through Kong Xiaxiang's limbs. He numbly raised his head and staggered up from the ground, feeling as if his heart was submerged in freezing water. He couldn't breathe, his head spun, and the world around him was an impenetrable smear of ink.

He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and squinted, trying to make sense of the gloom. After a long moment, he spotted a touch of white—two withered, haggard eyes set in a lifeless face.

"Old Sect Master... Grand-uncle..."

"The Daoist Master... the Daoist Master has taken his own life."

Kong Xiaxiang shifted on his knees. The old man was still sitting stiffly beneath a tree, his head resting against the trunk, revealing an ancient, wrinkled neck. He had sliced it more than halfway open himself, exposing the grayish-white of his trachea and bloodless flesh.

The sword that had belonged to the previous sect master had long since slipped from his grasp and lay plunged into the earth beside him. His legs were buried limply in the mud, his hands splayed at his sides. He cut a grotesque figure, like a tree stump rotten from the roots up.

"...Old Ancestor... you too..."

Sobbing, Kong Xiaxiang shuffled closer and fumbled to sit by the old man's side. He cupped the man's face in his hands, pressing his palm against the wound in his throat. Only then did a flicker of life return to those two dull eyes as they fixed on him.

"Old Ancestor..."

Tears streaming down his face, Kong Xiaxiang gently channeled his dharma power into the old man's body. But Kong Guxi only stared straight at him. A dirt-caked hand rose and rested softly on the younger man's face, his ancient lips moving twice.

Kong Xiaxiang couldn't hear. He lowered his head, bringing his ear right to the old man's mouth, and finally caught the hoarse, slurred words.

"The Kong... the Kong Clan..."

Though indistinct, the two words were colder than ice. The first sect master of the revived Profound Peak Gate trembled, tears flowing freely as he answered, 

"Old Ancestor... I understand... Just hold on a little longer. It's for the Kong Clan... It's for the Kong Clan..."

He felt the old man before him give the faintest shake of his head. A wisp of icy, residual breath, as fine as a silk thread, brushed against Kong Xiaxiang's cheek.

"A happy... occasion. Don't... don't cry..."

A cold blade seemed to pierce Kong Xiaxiang's lungs. He shivered, his teeth chattering. He raised a hand woodenly and wiped away his tears.

"This junior... won't cry anymore..."

His response seemed to spark one last struggle in the man in his arms. Kong Guxi's eyelids shot open, revealing a flash of panic. Though he was at death's door, his hand suddenly clenched Kong Xiaxiang's collar. Compared to his strength in the Wilderness all those years ago, this grip was faint, yet it felt so heavy that Kong Xiaxiang couldn't breathe. He could only stare, stunned.

Kong Guxi groaned. The wound on his neck tore wider, and a broken stream of air hissed from his windpipe. He summoned every last ounce of strength in his body and forced a single, agonizing word from between his teeth.

"Smile."

The word seemed to drain the last of the old man's energy. His eyes rapidly grew dim. Kong Xiaxiang watched him fall slowly backward until his head struck the tree with a hollow thud. His desiccated pupils dilated, staring unseeingly at the sky behind Kong Xiaxiang, his eyes refusing to close even in death.

A dead, dark silence still hung over the mountain.

The middle-aged man remained kneeling like a statue, staring into the old man's unblinking eyes. An eternity seemed to pass, or perhaps only an instant. Then, with a start, he released his hold and scrambled back a few inches before slowly turning his head.

The pavilion behind him had long since collapsed under the weight of the celestial phenomenon, now just a field of ruins in the oppressive gloom. Trees, blasted by the fallout from the fallen divine ability, were uprooted and scattered across the ground. One raised a branch high, pointing toward the heavens.

A white Daoist robe was snagged on its tip.

"Sect Master... Sect Master!"

Kong Xiaxiang's wails echoed through the mountains, as mournful and sharp as a wild ghost haunting a lonely grave. He wept and laughed in turn, clutching the old man's body tightly, watching as it slowly crumbled to dust in his hands.

The lightning had vanished from the sky. A light patter of rain began to fall, swiftly escalating into a torrential downpour. The storm snatched the white robe from the branch and swept it away into the boundless, ink-black heavens, leaving only the relentless rain to wash away the endless suffering from his body in the darkness.

---

The Exiled Qi in the sky gradually receded, the radiance of the Veiled Yin long since gone. High above, Tinglan stared at the gates of Profound Peak, her expression complex. She remained silent.

Truthfully, her relationship with Profound Peak was not a good one. The grudges between them were convoluted and difficult to resolve. Yet, watching that Daoist Master take her own life in midair, she felt a tightness in her chest that left her unable to speak.

The heavens, filled with divine abilities, and the earth, covered in armies, stood silent. Rain streamed over their armor. Before the great bronze hall, the man stood in silence for a long time.

Yang Ruiyi's heart was a maelstrom of emotions.

Anger? It had scattered when the heavens and earth changed color. Hatred? There was only the bitter frustration of an effort wasted. There was even... a sliver of pity. He felt as though he had punched a wad of cotton; the result was hollow, oppressive.

Beneath that oppression lay a fog of confusion.

'What are the higher-ups thinking?'

He, Yang Ruiyi, hadn't known Wei Xuanyin was here, but it was impossible that his superiors were unaware. And yet, they had allowed one of the enemy's most powerful figures to infiltrate the area... to what end?

'To injure Wei Xuanyin and damage his Dao path? Was it necessary to take such a risk? Could it be... they actually intended to kill him!'

He knew that if Kong Tingyun hadn't taken her own life, Shanji would now be a raging battlefield. Whether Wei Xuanyin could have escaped unscathed was uncertain, but it would have been tantamount to gambling with the Song Emperor's prestige and authority.

Yang Ruiyi didn't doubt their willingness to take risks, but he couldn't see any conceivable benefit that would justify such a gamble. This was the root of his unease. Even though Kong Tingyun's suicide had resolved the crisis, a lingering fear remained.

'Could the Northern Daoist Tradition have wanted to use our hands to eliminate Wei Xuanyin? But he's one of the few remaining pillars of the Guanhua Daoist Tradition!'

He had no time to ponder his doubts further; they sank deep into his heart. Yang Ruiyi's lips parted slightly.

"The Kong Clan."

"The Kong Clan is innocent."

The Heavenly Light shone brightly as King Wei, standing amidst the fading divine abilities, finally spoke. The four words prompted a nod from Yang Ruiyi, who quietly declared,

"The chief culprit is dead. The Kong Clan's disciples will not be pursued."

The statement echoed through the air, but no answer came. Darkness shrouded the silent gates of Profound Peak, from which the faint sound of muffled sobs could be heard. After a long while, Sima Yuanli stepped forward as if waking from a dream and said respectfully,

"The Celestial Dynasty is virtuous and does not blame the common folk... Great General..."

Yang Ruiyi gave him a hurried wave and turned to the others, his voice tinged with weariness.

"This battle has been long. You are all exhausted. Return to your posts..."

Only when his gaze fell upon Li Zhouwei did some color return to his eyes. He gestured for him to approach and said with gravity,

"In this great battle, King Wei's contributions were monumental!"

Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"The highest merit belongs to the Sword Immortal."

Yang Ruiyi offered a strained smile and lifted a sleeve.

"King Wei is too modest... Without you, Qi Lanyan could not have been slain. I must now return with the imperial decree and report to the Emperor to request rewards for Ting Province."

His words carried a congratulatory tone, but Li Zhouwei merely offered polite pleasantries in return. Yang Ruiyi didn't dare linger.

"King Wei is injured and should not travel... I will escort you back to Ting Province."

The young man didn't move. The multicolored light in his eyes burned brightly as he replied,

"This king appreciates the Great General's sentiment, but matters in Jianghuai are not yet settled and still require your attention. There is no need for an escort."

Yang Ruiyi could only nod grimly as Li Zhouwei continued,

"Though the Kong Clan has cut ties with Profound Peak, they carry a heavy burden of infamy. The past wars also took a toll on many southern disciples. The Kong Clan has old ties with my lake and often resides in Shanji. I fear they will require protection."

Profound Peak Gate had offended the Yang family too grievously. Even with the Daoist Master's suicidal sacrifice, much animosity remained. Anyone else would never have dared to make such a request. But coming from King Wei, it made Yang Ruiyi sigh in explanation, "The Emperor is a man of broad virtue and great grace. His recalling of the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel is a sign of his approval..."

Li Zhouwei nodded. The three from Ting Province took their leave, soaring away on cascading waves of Heavenly Light. They soon arrived back at the lake, where the vast, purple-gold array, now somewhat dimmer, materialized in the distance.

Though they had won, Li Ximing's mood was foul. On the one hand, Li Zhouwei's injuries were worsening; on the other, there was the fall of Kong Tingyun. Whether considering the friendship between their two families or the personal bonds spanning three generations, he was filled with sorrow.

He lamented, "I had wanted to go down and gather them at the lake, but I fear Moongaze Lake will be anything but peaceful from now on... It would only bring harm to their family..."

Li Zhouwei's eyes were shut tight, the aura of calamity still clinging to his face, etching a subtle trace of pain between his brows. He said,

"I will write a formal request to the Song Emperor for a minor title. It would be best to relocate the Kong Clan further south, away from the conflicts of the shore, so they can maintain a low profile and avoid attracting another disaster."

Seeing his condition, Li Ximing could not dwell on other matters. He quickly turned his head.

"Jiangqian... go to the Eastern Sea..."

He trailed off, a sudden sense of danger making him hesitate. He immediately changed his mind.

"Don't leave the Song State. First, make a trip to Jianghuai and find old Daoist Master Shanbai. Ask him for his counsel... However, this calamity is beyond what ordinary people can handle, so he will likely be powerless. On your way back, visit the Sword Gate and see if you can ask for advice from Senior Heaven's Horn!"

Li Jiangqian immediately clasped his hands.

"This junior will leave at once!"

He had emerged from the great war between north and south almost unscathed. Igniting his Li Fire, he shot northward in a blur of motion. Li Zhouwei did not stop him. He landed within the inner array and hurried into the main hall. Only then did he take a step forward and laboriously cough up a mouthful of blood.

Before the blood could touch the ground, it dissolved into smoke in an interweaving of Wu Light and Heavenly Glow.

He sat in the main seat and shook his head.

"I fear this injury will not be easily resolved."

He then took a jade box from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing.

"The Song Emperor provided a piece of Chuchun Hanging Wood. I must trouble Grand-uncle to prepare it as medicine. I see you are also injured. Horn Wood excels at healing, so you should take some as well."

Li Ximing simply shook his head.

"I have my Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body. After many years of cultivation, it has reached a state of mastery. These wounds are superficial and will heal easily..."

Li Zhouwei didn't press the matter. He lifted his sleeve slightly and produced three items.

One was a demonic blade, little more than an inch long, shaped like an exquisite dagger of gold and iron. Another was a long whip that coiled like a serpent, thick with Baleful Qi and freezing to the touch. The last item, a Dao sword, had a weaker sense of Baleful Qi; its mystical patterns spoke of an orthodox immortal lineage, but its blade was shattered in two, rendering it useless.

Bound by Bright Yang light, these were the relics of Helian Wujiang.

With the fall of the Daoist Master from the Tiefu Kingdom, nearly all of his Spiritual Artifacts had fallen into Li Zhouwei's hands. The others were either unwilling or did not dare to contest his claim, so they never even brought it up. It was a complete windfall. Helian Wujiang's storage pouch had shattered upon his death, its contents scattering into the Great Void like a celestial scattering flowers, destined for some fortunate soul at some unknown time and place.

But those items were secondary. Even the few Enlightened Artifacts they had acquired were sufficient compensation. These three Spiritual Artifacts were the true prize, enough to fully equip a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master.

Li Zhouwei hadn't expected to be able to finish Helian Wujiang, so these gains were a pleasant surprise. Looking at the precious artifacts in his hand, his expression softened, and he said with a smile,

"Of the three, the blade is the most exceptional, the sword is slightly inferior, and the spiritual whip is merely a handy weapon. I do not cultivate Baleful Qi, so it feels too light in my hand, but the materials are excellent."

The Helian family, after all, had deep foundations. Helian Wujiang had died suddenly while covering the retreat, losing three Spiritual Artifacts at once. Li Ximing, who had been frowning this whole time, finally showed a hint of delight and produced a long-necked bottle from his own robes.

"Gongsun Bei's Night Supplanting Bottle is here as well!"

He set the bottle down and then brought out the Heavenly Nurture Urn, holding it aloft with his divine ability. From its dark mouth, strands of golden light struggled to escape, seeking a Buddhist Land. On their way from Baihai Creek, Li Ximing had successfully captured the black tiger.

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly, his expression turning serious.

"With these four Spiritual Artifacts, whether we trade them or melt them down to be reforged, it's enough to arm Jiangqian. And this black tiger... is enough for Que'Wan to receive her investiture. By my calculations, even if achieving the Whole Pill proves difficult, she should be emerging from seclusion soon."

Li Ximing breathed a sigh of relief.

"The gains have been immense... but at the cost of your injury..."

Li Zhouwei shook his head. The colors in his eyes flickered, his mind clearly elsewhere.

"It's hard to say if our gains were great... but we certainly witnessed a good show. We're finally no longer being led by the nose. They were forced into a head-on confrontation, and just as I thought... only when the situation spins out of their control do they reveal more of their secrets..."

"Five Daoist Masters fell in a single battle. The overt and covert struggles between the north and south are truly insidious."

Li Ximing's gaze was fraught with worry. He listened as Li Zhouwei coughed twice, then smiled.

"It was always said that the Heavenly Glow nurtured the Buddhists, but now we know that's not the whole story. As it turns out, the Yang Clan did not want Cheng Xunzhi to die, yet the Way of Great Desire still obeyed them. Otherwise, how could Tangdao Mountain have fallen so easily? From this perspective, Tangdao Mountain never needed to be defended. As long as Jianghuai was reclaimed and the Sword Immortal arrived, the Way of Great Desire would have had to retreat unless they wanted mutual destruction!"

His tone turned to ice.

"I once thought Liu Bai was a pawn the Yang Clan sacrificed to appease the Way of Great Desire, forcing him to join the Buddhists. Now, it seems the machinations behind it... run far deeper..."

A shock went through Li Ximing. "You mean... Liu Bai was... intentionally sacrificed?"

"Whether he was or not, the Mahas and the Merciful One are watching. At the very least, we can ask Cheng Qian about the situation at the time."

The King of Wei spoke coldly.

"I've long known the south was up to no good, and now I've seen the depths of their shadowy tactics... They are truly cold-blooded and without gratitude, shameless in their depravity. Compared to them, Luoxia almost seems to have a sense of dignity!"




# Chapter 1167: Beyond the Three Realms

When Li Zhouwei finished his explanation of the cause and effect, including the matter of the Sword Gate, the Daoist Master at his side saw his expression flicker several times before he let out a heavy sigh.

"So that's how it was… I'd always assumed we couldn't rely on anyone from the north or south, but I was still waiting for them to show their hand. Now I see it's just as I feared."

Li Zhouwei pinched the bridge of his nose to ease the throbbing pain.

"Then there are the Dragon-kin," he said. "Two-faced and full of schemes. We can ignore them for now. The priority is to heal… the sooner I recover, the better."

He set the matter aside and changed the subject.

"There are two other things… I'm still in possession of the Great Xiukui Monastery's Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass and the Sima Family's Spiritual Treasure, the Huai River Map. One can amplify the Yang Cusp, the other can preserve one's life essence. Both are indispensable for suppressing my injuries. I'll need to borrow them for more than just a year or two, so I'll need you, Grand-uncle, to make the arrangements."

"Of course!"

They wouldn't bring it up, but their family had to make things right. Li Ximing nodded emphatically. Li Zhouwei paused, then added a reminder.

"During the battle, Sima Yuanli also produced a Pill of the Second Manifestation's Vast Yang. Though the man is agreeable but lacks fortitude, his mind full of distractions, it was a gesture to curry favor, and it cost him a fortune. We shouldn't remain in his debt…"

After all, that very pill was still glowing with a Bright Yang radiance within his sea of qi, a scorching sun continuously feeding him divine ability and dharma power. After the reminder, he steered the conversation back with a hint of a smile.

"As for the Great Xiukui Monastery, once I've healed, I will pay them a personal visit. The treasure that surprised me most in this battle was, without a doubt, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!"

This was no exaggeration. Although the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass wasn't a decisive factor in the battle, the wondrous profundity it displayed throughout the fight was top-tier.

"For escape, it can sow chaos among the stars. For offense, it unleashes the killing power of High Radiance. Without any need for incantations or spells, it has four charges that can be used at a moment's notice. Even after they're exhausted, it simply reverts to a normal Spiritual Artifact, requiring hand seals and incantations."

"And on top of that… it has the divine effect of aiding one in reaching the Yang Cusp!"

Even though Li Ximing had never witnessed the compass display its divine might, his expression was one of deep approval. He had borrowed the Spiritual Artifact years ago and retained a vivid impression, even making a quiet, regretful comparison when he had traded for the Radiant Sun King's Halberd.

He spoke now, "I suggested a trade for it back then, but Senior Kui Qi declined on the grounds that it was a registered, sect-guarding treasure. Now that the Great Xiukui Monastery is in decline, a trade might not be out of the question. We'll just have to ensure they don't come out of it short."

"If a trade is impossible, so be it. The debt of gratitude we owe them comes first. The Xiukui are of the righteous path; we won't put the Lin clan in a difficult position."

The decline of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had sent shockwaves through the land, and the Li clan benefited greatly from the resulting turmoil—particularly from the state of the Great Xiukui Monastery. Furthermore, the deaths of two Xiukui Daoist Masters had shaken Jiangnan to its core.

From the cultivators of the Song State to the Yang clan, and even the lofty Song Emperor himself, all treated Lin Chensheng with a newfound respect, and Li Zhouwei was no exception.

Li Ximing nodded gravely.

"Besides that mystic tiger, there is still a Merciful One inside this Heavenly Nurture Urn. It cannot be left unguarded. I will take it out."

Saying no more, he collected the three Spiritual Artifacts and took his leave with haste, leaving Li Zhouwei standing alone in the hall. After a moment's hesitation, he finally formed an incantation seal.

That light, ethereal, cloud-riding sense of weightlessness washed over him once more. Darkness first filled his vision, followed by an explosion of light!

A cool, moon-like white jade pavilion emerged before him. The sight of the sun and moon sharing the sky was framed by the window lattice, and a familiar, perfectly balanced aura of yin and yang washed over him.

Li Zhouwei slowly opened his eyes.

The multicolored light in his eyes pulsed, its hues deepening. The fissure-like marks on his face lit up in succession, catching him by surprise.

'This calamity…'

The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth that had been plaguing his body flickered, seeming to have lost its target in a state of confusion. It gradually dimmed, and its ever-intensifying power slowed dramatically!

'Hmm?'

The deep furrow in Li Zhouwei's brow relaxed, a hint of joy in his eyes. He quickly closed them again, concentrating his senses.

'Is it being neutralized? …No, that's not it…'

The affliction was twofold. One part was the injuries sustained from direct hits in the great battle. The other was the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth, which caused an ever-denser Wu Light to well up from within him. This made it impossible to spare the focus to recover; in fact, his injuries were steadily worsening.

But the moment he entered this place, the calamity showed a distinct hesitation. If before it had been like a great sun in the sky, its light beating down unimpeded, now it was as if he had taken shelter under the eaves, avoiding a good portion of its force.

Not only that, but in his senses, the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth wasn't just suppressed; the gushing torrent of Wu Light was actively receding at an accelerating rate!

This filled Li Zhouwei with shock and elation, and his heart hammered in his chest.

'What is the principle behind the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth? How does it function… and just how potent is the divine ability of this Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance?'

All manner of theories flashed through his mind. The next instant, Li Zhouwei formed another incantation seal. The world around him faded like an illusion, and he was back in the great hall in Ting Province.

Just as he expected, the moment he left the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, a brilliant, mysterious glow pulsed into being, and the stinging pain of the calamity flared in response. The weakening Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth roared back to life, its power growing rapidly.

'The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth… a calamity…'

Understanding dawned in his eyes. He manifested once more within the Heaven, watching the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth slowly weaken inside him. He let out a long breath, rising to his feet and beginning to pace.

'It must be some kind of resonance. When the Crystalline Jade Branch struck me, it was as if I was branded with a mark—a focal point for the affliction, so to speak. That's the source of this unending Wu Light. It originates from the Spiritual Treasure… no, that's not all… Is it a Rank Designation or a Dharma Treasure?'

"No… it can't be either of those."

The multicolored light in his eyes slowly faded.

"The Azure Insight Origin Mirror is on the lake! Neither a Rank Designation nor a Dharma Treasure can reach this place. It must be… a profound power that attunes to the Wu Earth Fruition Attainment itself!"

"The Azure Insight Origin Mirror cannot sever the link to the Fruition Attainments that form the foundation of Heaven and Earth… otherwise it would be impossible to gather 'Pit Water's' River-Center Clear Qi or 'Pristine Water's' Grotto-Spring Clear Qi on Moongaze Lake…"

"And what severs the link to the Wu Earth Fruition Attainment isn't merely the fact that the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance is a grotto-heaven!"

The Crystalline Jade Branch had been infamous since primordial times. Countless high-level cultivators throughout history had been struck by the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth. In the old days, grotto-heavens in the Great Void were plentiful. Surely a dignified cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm could enter one to recuperate?

"It's because the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance is on a higher level than the Azure Insight Origin Mirror. It exists outside the three realms of the mortal world, the Great Void, and the grotto-heavens—realms both tangible and intangible. It is not bound by the Five Virtues! To be conservative, it is, at the very least, beyond the influence of Wu Earth!"

"If cultivators of old had practiced here, they could likely have avoided the three calamities and nine tribulations, free from the jurisdiction of Heaven-Governing Thunder, worldly disasters, and the Underworld's registry, and walked the Great Dao in perfect freedom."

"If I…"

He let out a long, slow breath, quickly suppressing the impulse.

"No… since this place is outside the Fruition Attainments, not only is the Quest for Gold impossible here, but one cannot even connect to the Great Void through the Shengyang Acupoint when breaking through with a divine ability. One must eventually return to the mortal world, exposed to the gaze of every True Monarch. Besides, a life of idle detachment is not the Dao of Bright Yang…"

Li Zhouwei quickly cast aside these distracting thoughts, calming his mind to take stock of the situation. He felt the pressure on him lighten considerably.

"With this advantage, at least I won't have to constantly fight the calamity while inside this grotto-heaven. I only need to wait for it to recede, then I can eradicate the accumulated Wu Light and focus entirely on healing… Once I've recovered, even cultivation will not be a problem!"

"And Grand-uncle can take his time searching for a way to remove the source of the affliction. Without the interference of this dense Wu Light, uprooting it will be much easier. And in the worst-case scenario, even if the taint can't be removed, facing it at my full strength versus fighting it while crippled are two completely different things!"

His mind at ease, he immediately sat down cross-legged. Torrents of divine ability surged through him, dissolving the Wu Light and healing his wounds. Shafts of Heavenly Light converged upon him, illuminating his face in a brilliant radiance.

…

Li Ximing rode the wind out of the hall and casually crushed a jade talisman to summon Guo Nanwu. As he did, he found Ting Province already abuzz with celebration, decorated from end to end and filled with a festive air. A quick glance revealed that the various Daoist Traditions of the Song State had all come to offer their congratulations.

Not only had the smaller traditions sent representatives, but even the Sima and Lingu clans, who had just retreated from the war between north and south, had sent people. Even the Purple Smoke and Cheng clans were represented. Most came under the pretext of celebrating Daoist Master Changli's breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, while discreetly trading the latest news.

'King Wei slew Qi Lanyan, the direct heir of the Comprehending Profoundity lineage who ruled Jianghuai!'

'A great victory! The three Holders of the Profound from the noble houses have pacified Jianghuai together…'

News of the breakthrough of Li Jiangqian, King Wei's eldest son, had spread far and wide, but the glory of slaying Qi Lanyan in battle was truly immense. Even to the Li family, it sounded almost unbelievable. One joyous event followed another, and the entire island was filled with a fervent atmosphere. The two guards standing watch before the main hall bowed low, and even they wore smiles when they raised their heads.

Seeing this, much of the gloom weighing on Li Ximing's heart lifted. He paused for a moment, just as Li Jiangzong entered, dressed in celebratory red. Li Ximing asked,

"What are the losses?"

"Daoist Master, we have won a great victory in the south. Casualties on the lake were minimal, and we lost only a few Qi Refining disciples taking Xuanmiao. The enemy prostrated themselves in surrender. Uncle Zhouda has already sent a letter back, asking for your guidance…"

The fighting in this war was ferocious, and the primary casualties had been among those of the Purple Mansion Realm. Li Ximing's greatest fear had been losing one of his own direct heirs in some unforeseen incident. He managed a small smile as he listened to Li Jiangzong's report.

"Our kinsman reports that the spiritual treasuries at Xuanmiao Temple have been secured by Gongsun Bofan, Daoist Miaoshui, and Dharma Protector Ding respectively. They have all fallen into our hands. As for now… do we wait for the Great Song to send someone for the handover, or…"

He left the rest unsaid, but Li Ximing understood perfectly. He nodded.

"Take it all! Don't leave them a single copper!"

Helian Wujiang's three Spiritual Artifacts falling into their hands was a clear signal of the Yang clan's attitude. Regarding Li Zhouwei appearing at the Sword Gate and shattering the tacit truce between north and south, Yang Ruiyi was clearly making a gesture of apology. And with their own family on the verge of establishing a mystic realm, they were in desperate need of resources. Li Ximing felt no need to be polite.

'This is nothing! The rewards from the Song Imperial Court are the real prize!'

Li Jiangzong's eyes lit up, and he nodded eagerly. Li Ximing raised a hand, adding a word of caution.

"It's good that Xuanmiao Temple is under our control. Ransack it as you please, but do not touch their Ancestral Hall. And that painting especially—it's best if you don't even look at it."

After all, Xuanmiao Temple still operated under the banner of Xu Xiang. And who knew if the Great Daoist Master of the Numinous Treasure Order had already departed. If one of their own did something insulting and was struck dead by a single wisp of his aura, Li Ximing could only swallow the bitter pill in silence.

Li Jiangzong quickly agreed, his face full of anticipation. "Elder Brother has reached the Purple Mansion Realm and refined a divine ability. He is one who has transcended the illusory to grasp the real. For three generations now, our family has produced such figures, making us the foremost of the Great Song's clans. The celebratory banquet… I wonder when it should be arranged?"

Li Ximing could tell at once that an elder had coached him. He had been on edge for days, and the formal words left him in a daze. He mused internally,

'That's right. Three generations who have refined divine abilities. Our family clawed its way up from nothing to reach the pinnacle of Jiangnan's great houses. It's only right that we burn incense, pray for good fortune, and report our success to the ancestors…'

'The higher you climb, the clearer you see the figures at the summit, and the more you realize how small you are.'

But he wasn't worried. Instead, his expression softened slightly as he smiled.

"Wait a little longer. There's still Wan'er. It's not too late for a joint celebration."

Li Jiangzong understood at once and nodded expectantly. Before he could say more, a ray of clear light streaked through the air and landed before the hall.

A young man's deep, steady voice rang out.

"Congratulations, Senior! Congratulations, King Wei!"

Li Ximing smiled and nodded, glancing at the junior beside him. Li Jiangzong tactfully withdrew. Li Ximing's expression immediately changed, and he sighed.

"The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth is the true menace. Nanwu, can you ask Qusi for me?"

Guo Nanwu nodded, his face serious.

"That is precisely why I have come!"

Li Ximing was instantly overjoyed and hurried forward to listen as Guo Nanwu spoke gravely.

"The Great Daoist Master has been following matters on the mainland. He heard what happened to King Wei and learned of the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth. He privately detests Qi Lanyan's viciousness and knows that this calamity cannot be left to fester—the longer it lingers, the more terrifying it becomes. Concerned that certain parties might hope to see King Wei delayed by it, he sent me here specifically."

Li Ximing nodded again and again.

"I am deeply moved by the Great Daoist Master's concern. This timely aid is like sweet dew on a parched day!"

Guo Nanwu continued, "The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth is a calamity. While my Great Daoist Master does not have a solution himself, he knows where one can be found… The most supreme methods and miraculous pills for evading calamities are all found with the Azure Step. Even the mighty Underworld cannot compare in this art!"

Guo Nanwu's words were polite, but Li Ximing's trust in the south was at an all-time low. He didn't for a second believe the Underworld couldn't solve the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth; they simply lacked the incentive. He couldn't be bothered to argue the point. He'd never imagined that the lineage most skilled in this art was not some distant power, but one so close at hand. Joy bloomed in his chest.

"The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition?! I'll go visit them right now!"

Hearing this, Guo Nanwu looked hesitant and stopped him.

"The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is indeed of the Azure Profoundity orthodoxy. However, according to what my Qusi knows, that eminence within their ranks does not specialize in evading calamities. What teachings exist on the matter are held by a few of their True Monarchs and are not typically passed down…"

"According to the Great Daoist Master, among the distant orthodoxies, the Dantai of the Nine Mounds or the Han clan of Chang Prefecture would be your best options. Closer to home… you could either approach the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, or… follow the path of Supreme Yin and seek out Chunyi."

Sudden realization dawned on Li Ximing's face, but a strange feeling stirred in his heart. He muttered to himself,

'The path of Supreme Yin? Seek out Chunyi?'




# Chapter 1168: Suspicions

"The Chunyi Dao Gate?"

Amidst the drifting clouds of the mountain, a man in a crimson robe stood beneath a tree. The heart-fire beneath the gold-trimmed garment burned with the true nature of Li Fire, while a profound light surged beside him, from which a gentle voice emerged.

"That's right. The way of Supreme Yin, after all, belongs to Azure Profoundity. Cultivators below the Azure Step called it the First Treasury. It is a treasury of both Daoist canon and of concealment. Thus, it's known as the great Immortal Dao for evading disaster and calamity."

The profound pine spoke eloquently, its knowledge vast and its Dao-Profundity unfathomable.

"Among the Three Profoundities, the Dao of Azure Profoundity is lofty and solitary, yet all flock to it. Every cultivator who emerges from its tradition is a hero among mortals. While their selection process is notoriously strict, another reason is that disaster and calamity cannot bind them... Even the Demonic Ancestor's inheritance, the Profound Crimson Demonic Legacy, contains profound arts of evasion."

"But it is precisely because this tradition cannot be restrained by calamity, in defiance of the Heavenly Dao, that the disciples of Azure Profoundity have always been few. In ancient times, they vanished from the mortal realm entirely. Even a True Monarch of the Encompassing Profoundity, seeking to save a life, had to journey all the way to the Huan family in the Northern Sea just to have them extend an invitation on his behalf."

The voice's tone shifted.

"However, the master of Azure Profoundity has many traditions under him; even the Great Sage addresses him as 'Master.' In the present age, Azure Profoundity has numerous traditions that engage with the world. There are four direct lineages: two that study the arts of worldly manifestation, and two that study the ways of concealment. One who ascended through Supreme Yin is known as Changtang. The Nine Mounds Daoist tradition can be traced back to one of his ancient lineages... You could also ask the Great Daoist Master of the Dantai family."

"If you don't wish to pursue those two avenues, the Two Rites of the Three Shamans and Two Rites might offer a solution. However, one has sealed its mountain gate, and the other is ethereal and without a trace—neither is easy to find."

The one wreathed in Li Fire was none other than Li Jiangqian. He had traveled a long way to find the rogue cultivator, Daoist Master Shanbai, only to learn that the man had already departed for the Purple Smoke Gate to help the injured Daoist Master Wenqing heal her Dharma body. His journey was for naught.

Fortunately, his family hadn't placed much hope in Shanbai to begin with. Without pausing, Li Jiangqian made his way to the Sword Gate, where he had the unexpected fortune of meeting this senior, Heaven's Horn.

Li Jiangqian returned the gesture of respect, his mind working. He raised his brow and asked,

"Dare I ask, Senior... the Green Pine Temple's Supreme Yang Daoist tradition—to what Dao does it trace its origins?"

As soon as he spoke, the winds above the Sword Gate gradually fell silent. The profound pine rustled, then stilled for a moment before answering.

"My Supreme Yang Daoist tradition traces its origins back to the Dao of Azure Profoundity, spreading the radiance of Yin and Yang to the world below. Before the Lord attained the Dao, he cultivated in the Mystic Realm of Manifesting Splendor and resided in Gonghua Heaven. The tradition was passed down by the Mysterious Monarch Changjing."

"In terms of seniority, he was of the same generation as the True Monarch who founded the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition, and he later assumed the primary seat of Supreme Yang."

Li Jiangqian sensed the finality in his tone and didn't press further. He frowned.

"If that's the case... why did Chunyi..."

The mountain winds began to flow once more, and shafts of clear light filtered down. Heaven's Horn continued,

"Supreme Yin inherently possesses methods for averting disaster; that is one reason. Secondly, during their cultivation at Green Pine Temple, the six lords each had their own unique comprehensions. Ancestral Master Chunyi alone obtained only a single Supreme Yin cultivation method. The Lord thus dispatched him to Jiangnan, where he entered Donghua Heaven and cultivated in seclusion within an Immortal Mansion for several years, which is how he achieved his gains."

Li Jiangqian pondered this for a moment, and the doubt in his mind dissolved into understanding.

‘Mysterious Monarch Changjing…’

In all his years of cultivation, he had only ever seen the title "Mysterious Monarch" in one text.

The Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record.

It was the very art Li Jiangchun practiced day in and day out.

He said no more, merely committing the name to memory. Cherishing his life, he knew better than to ask further. He looked up and said,

"I see. Thank you, Senior, for your guidance!"

The profound pine rustled but offered no further reply. Li Jiangqian rose, bowed his thanks, and departed. He walked out from the mountains and vanished into the Great Void.

Yet the winds within the mountains continued to surge. The emerald needles of the profound pine flickered, as if suppressing a rolling Metal Malice. Vaguely, a drifting golden mist began to rise, and from it, a figure in white robes stepped forth.

It was the Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal—Cheng Xunzhi.

This sword immortal, who had played a decisive role in the conflict between north and south, had not gone to the Song court to pay his respects, nor had he concerned himself with the Yang Clan. Once the great war subsided, he had simply returned to his mountain gate and had remained seated in meditation until this very day.

His expression was placid, but within his sword-like eyes, the essence of Dui Metal roiled, emanating a soul-shaking pressure. From the sky, a continuous rain of Horn Wood radiance fell like a gentle spring shower, ceaselessly dissolving the sword malice that threatened to erupt from his body.

"A blood descendant of Bright Yang..."

"A pitiful soul..." Heaven's Horn replied gravely.

Cheng Xunzhi then said, "Master told me to take Senior's surname, so I am surnamed Li. My name is Li Mei, a descendant of the Wei-Li line—I do not know his intention in this."

His voice was like a golden wind, scraping against the branches and making them rustle. The profound pine explained,

"Before the Lord attained the Dao, while he was still tempering himself in the world, he met a Daoist. They drank and spoke with great cheer. Using their cups as tallies, they played a drinking game. When they tallied the pairs at the end, the Daoist still owed the Lord one cup. So, he took a fruit from his sleeve and gifted it to the Lord."

"The Lord brought the fruit back to the mountain and planted it upon the peak, and it grew to become the Heaven's Horn of today. Because that Daoist was surnamed Li and called himself a descendant of the Wei-Li, Heaven's Horn took Li as its surname."

A flicker of emotion crossed Cheng Xunzhi's face. He nodded.

"No wonder there is a bond between us."

His voice was like the grinding of metal, causing the Horn Wood radiance above to grow thicker. Meanwhile, the colors of the heavens were in constant flux. In the western sky, the golden qi rapidly receded, gradually revealing the sky's natural hue.

"They have yielded White River."

Cheng Xunzhi stood, gazing at the fading gold, a hint of doubt in his expression.

"Why... why would Golden Feather intervene to stop me?"

His sharp eyes swept across the mountainside, the sheer force of his gaze pressing the grass and trees low to the ground. As the Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal slowly narrowed his eyes, a soft rustling sound filled the air.

‘He cultivates Dui Metal and also wields the divine ability Present Departs Old… Is He not afraid?’

The profound pine swayed slightly and fell silent as well, knowing full well what he was referring to.

The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition had always regarded the Daos of Dui and Geng as their private domain, absolutely forbidding others from trespassing upon them. Yet, both Daos were notoriously mutable, meaning they had to guard against every cultivator in the world who practiced them.

Cheng Xunzhi was a prodigious talent, a true master in this field. He was taught by the profound pine, who had been a disciple of the Dui Metal True Monarch of old, and was even considered the True Monarch's successor. His chances of ascending to the golden position were not small. If he, Cheng Xunzhi, were to become a True Monarch, what would his stance toward Golden Oneness be?

This was the very fear that plagued the Sword Gate and Cheng Jiuwen, though they dared not speak it aloud. Even Cheng Xunzhi himself, before awakening to his past life, had believed it was the wariness of Golden Oneness that had barred his path to advancement.

Even when he became a Great Daoist Master and journeyed to Tangdao Mountain, he was intercepted by cultivators of the Golden Feather Sect. He had been fully prepared to be surrounded and killed on the spot, an act that could have easily ignited a war between Golden Feather and the Underworld.

But nothing happened.

Daoist Master Chunshuo had merely blocked his path for a moment before gently letting him pass. The meaning behind that single act was worlds apart from what he had expected.

Tian Langzhi of Tangdao Mountain was a Liangli of the Way of Great Desire; the Dharma Master backing him would never give him up. If Cheng Xunzhi had truly clashed with him, the probability of his own demise would have been exceedingly high. It was Daoist Master Chunshuo's timely delay that prevented a full-blown battle at Tangdao.

‘They don't want to eliminate me... they actually want to protect me!’

‘For what reason? For the sake of the Underworld's grand scheme? How could the petty affairs of the Yang family possibly compel True Monarch Taiyuan to risk the theft of Geng Metal just to protect me? Never mind whether the Yang family has that much influence, who in this world could stop that True Monarch from taking what he desires?’

This sword immortal was a genius the likes of which the Sword Gate had not seen in a century, yet he was far from stubborn. He was a reformer with a remarkably clear mind, and in an instant, suspicion about the entire arrangement bloomed.

‘What if the ones who wanted to protect me... were Golden Feather all along?’

A chaotic hue of gold and white churned in his gaze.

‘It should have been… during the great war between north and south, Tangdao Mountain should have fallen early. After Liu Bai had been dead for a very long time... only then would the Underworld have had me retake Tangdao... leaving no flaw in the plan.’

‘It was Li Zhouwei's unexpected stand at Lake Xian, defending it to the death, and the swiftness with which Qi Lanyan was slain. These events prevented the northern and southern fronts from tying me down, allowing me to head north ahead of schedule. Tian Langzhi's subsequent actions crossed a line and shattered the tacit understanding among the factions of the Underworld, forcing Chunshuo's hand... and arousing my suspicions.’

‘Could it be that this whole affair... was a scheme by the northern powers, like Tian Langzhi, targeting Golden Feather?’

The light in his eyes wavered. The Pear Blossom Spiritual Sword in his hand remained perfectly still amidst the swirling Metal Malice.

‘Golden Feather…’

---

Li Jiangqian traveled far from the Sword Gate, his mind racing.

‘Thankfully, the Chunyi Dao Gate is near the coast!’

He was a very cautious man. Though he had many friends, his enemies were far more numerous, terrifyingly so—especially the Way of Great Desire and Changxiao.

‘A journey all the way to the Eastern Sea would be fraught with peril. But the Chunyi Dao Gate is near Fenkuai. The path is well-traveled, under the eyes and ears of the world, so no one should be able to intercept me. If a fight were to break out, the entire nation would bear witness.’

Li Zhouwei's injuries could not wait. Without further hesitation, he stepped into the Great Void, preparing to soar eastward. Suddenly, his divine ability flared. He raised his brows and looked to the west.

His own Daoist Master was approaching, accompanied by Guo Nanwu.

Guo Nanwu had spent a considerable amount of time with the Li family and had long been acquainted with the young man before him. Seeing Li Jiangqian now, his eyes were filled with admiration. He cupped his hands.

"Congratulations, Daoist Friend Changli!"

Li Jiangqian let out a calm laugh.

"So it is Senior Nanwu."

Li Jiangqian's golden eyes stared at him, making Guo Nanwu feel slightly unnerved. He quickly turned to Li Ximing.

"Elder, your timing is perfect. Jiangqian was just preparing to leave for Chunyi."

"Indeed," Li Ximing said, his gaze much calmer now, holding a hint of joy.

When Guo Nanwu had so seriously suggested Chunyi, Li Ximing hadn't known whether to laugh or cry.

‘If I weren't trying to conceal my family's wealth, when it comes to Supreme Yin spiritual qi, this Chunyi Dao Gate would be left speechless before me! To think I would have to seek help from across the sea…’

Beyond the joy, the suggestion was a moment of sudden enlightenment. Li Ximing's heart pounded as he remembered something else.

‘That Supreme Yin treasured pill!’

Years ago, upon his return from the Nine Mounds, Li Ximing had used a Shade-Cleansing Qi Pill from his dantian and a Supreme Yin Moon Orchid to refine three great pills.

He had consumed one himself and sent another to the Chunyi Gate, leaving just one in his possession. But with one key insight, a hundred doors open. In Li Ximing's view, he might not even need to use it.

‘This treasured pill was once the pinnacle of my alchemy, but I have since advanced further. While I may not have such a fortuitous opportunity again, my family has an abundance of Supreme Yin qi!’

In the family's early days, the main body of the Immortal Mirror had caused frequent phenomena, producing many high-grade Supreme Yin spiritual items. They had lacked proper preservation methods back then; for generations, from Li Xuanxuan to Li Yuanjiao, their best method was the jade box from Pingya Island, which had saved one precious portion.

‘This can be used. Even after it’s gone, within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, Supreme Yin qi erupts from beneath the pavilion. Although slightly inferior, it is all of extremely high grade. It is merely a matter of harmonizing the life-mandate. As long as we are willing to invest the spiritual resources, we can almost certainly refine another batch!’

‘Furthermore, the original pill was infused with a trace of Lesser Yin and Pure Qi from the Shade-Cleansing Spiritual Pool, containing a rare sliver of cold moon spiritual qi. Zhouwei's condition isn't critical right now. It would be best to save this pill for Jiangchun…’

Before departing, he had specifically visited the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance and learned of its wondrous ability to isolate Wu Earth. His mind was already whirring with calculations.

‘I once considered trading with Chunyi for their Supreme Yin pill formula, but my intentions were too obvious, and the exchange failed. Now… now is the perfect opportunity!’

Back then, he didn't have the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance and would have had to hide far out at sea just to dare refine a Supreme Yin pill. Now, with all the necessary conditions aligned, it was incredibly convenient. 

His heart burned with excitement. This thought settled him, and greatly relieved, he set off toward the Eastern Sea. Guo Nanwu, meanwhile, continued to size up Li Jiangqian.

"Daoist Friend... to cultivate the true nature of Li Fire is quite rare. As a descendant of Bright Yang, the two are mutually reinforcing. Your future is boundless. It is only a pity that in today's Jiangnan, there is not much Li Fire left."

Li Jiangqian smiled and replied, "The Central Plains has plenty."

Guo Nanwu was taken aback for a moment. He gave him an odd look, then said with praise, "A prince, through and through!"

Li Ximing listened with his hands clasped behind his back as they traveled north. As the undulating mountain gate of their destination appeared before them, he spoke.

"The Nine Mounds is simply too far. With the turmoil on the lake and powerful enemies lurking in the shadows, I cannot travel so far myself. I will have to trouble you, Nanwu..."

The Chunyi Dao Gate, after all, lacked the prestigious history of the Nine Mounds. Li Ximing had been preparing for both possibilities from the start. Seeing Guo Nanwu nod his assent, he smiled.

"Nanwu, please wait a moment."

He flipped his hand, and Helian Wujiang's Dao sword appeared. The two broken pieces of the intricately patterned blade lay in his palm, the fractured surfaces gleaming brightly. Guo Nanwu's eyelids twitched.

"The Profound-Name Dao-Malice Sword..." he sighed. "So, Helian Wujiang has fallen."

Li Ximing hadn't expected him to recognize the artifact. He nodded.

Guo Nanwu's expression turned serious.

"My ancestors also wandered the Central Plains. This item has a long history. It was originally a seal bestowed by the Great Qi. After the Qi dynasty fell, an ancestor of the Helian family, Helian Bo, swiftly melted the seal down and extracted the Profound-Name Dao-Malice within to forge this sword."

"This substance is now extinct. It is the very source of this sword's power."

Since his family had no use for malice qi, Li Ximing had long intended to reforge it. It wasn't just the sword he planned to get rid of; he had no intention of keeping the other saber and whip either. If he had already refined them and understood their secrets, he would have sent them along as well. 

Hearing Guo Nanwu's explanation gave him a better idea. He smiled.

"This was once a fine spiritual artifact, but it was broken in two before it fell into my family's hands. I'll ask you, Nanwu, to take it to Qusi on your way and have the two Daoist Masters there take a look for me. Have them extract its essence..."

Guo Nanwu agreed, took the broken sword, and departed. Li Jiangqian watched him go before turning back with a smile.

"Please wait a moment, Grand-Uncle. I will go down and pay my respects to the gate."




# Chapter 1169: The Path of Li Fire

The spiritual peak of the Chunyi Dao Gate had once been Seajade Peak, a celestial mountain of rare beauty, its entire body like lustrous, brilliant jade. But when Daoist Master Yuanshang sought his breakthrough, he had shattered the peak, and with it, the paradisiacal landscape vanished.

Now, with the passage of time, the half that remained on the island had become a mere hill known as the Jade Terrace. The other half, submerged in the sea, revealed only a speck of white upon the surface like a small reef, wreathed in ethereal mist. The palaces and courts that once stood there now lay on the seabed, a ruin called the Broken Scepter.

As Li Jiangqian descended, riding a current of Li Fire, a figure emerged from the mists of the Jade Terrace, borne upon the wind. He was a man of refined and striking features, his robes embroidered with patterns of waves and crescent moons, a belt of subdued silver jade cinched at his waist. Catching sight of Li Jiangqian’s golden eyes, he spoke with caution.

"May I ask which fellow Daoist has graced us with their presence?"

Li Jiangqian smiled.

"Greetings, Senior. I am Changli of Ting Province. I have come with my elder to seek guidance on the Immortal Dao."

The young Daoist Master was momentarily taken aback, but then he saw a shaft of Heavenly Light descend. Li Ximing stepped forth from the Great Void, prompting the young man to quickly cup his hands in a formal salute.

"So, it is a guest from Ting Province!"

Li Ximing returned the gesture with a smile, his eyes brightening.

"It has been long since we parted at Chunyi. To see you again, your bearing has changed completely. Congratulations, my friend."

The man before them, Che Hong, had impressively become a cultivator of two divine abilities.

"Please, come inside!"

A clear look of pleasure was on Che Hong's face. With a polite smile, he led the two men in. He paused to dispatch a subordinate, murmuring a quiet instruction.

'Go to Dushan Island and invite Senior Ji'an. Tell him… his path to the Dao has arrived!'

The Chunyi disciple departed at once. The three of them landed upon the ethereal Jade Terrace. The pavilions were otherworldly, devoid of any mortal air, and disciples on either side bowed respectfully as they passed. The atmosphere was one of profound tranquility.

Li Ximing nodded to himself, understanding that the Chunyi Dao Gate was gradually emerging from the shadow of Daoist Master Yuanshang's fall. As they took their seats on a high platform, Che Hong spoke graciously.

"My sect and your esteemed clan share a certain destiny. Before I had accomplished my divine abilities, I even crossed hands with the master of the Thunder Pool… You, Daoist Master… you must be King Wei’s eldest son!"

Li Jiangqian smiled.

"I am."

Che Hong was not yet fully aware of the current political landscape; he had only made inquiries about the Li Fire of the great lake years ago. Having just emerged from seclusion, he recognized Li Jiangqian at a glance. After a few pleasantries, Li Ximing’s expression turned serious.

"We have come today because King Wei has been struck by a terrible calamity. We wish to trade for pill formulas and techniques to avert this disaster and cleanse his karma."

In an urgent tone, he briefly explained the sequence of events. Che Hong's expression shifted several times as he listened. He hesitated for a few moments before replying,

"The methods of the Supreme Yin are exceedingly precious and would normally require the personal approval of our Dao Gate’s master. However, your noble clan originates from the Ning-Li and was close to our ancestors, the Xi clan. Our Dao Lineages are also aligned, and this is a matter of great urgency… I shall not stand on ceremony."

He continued gravely,

"My Dao Lineage does possess secret arts for dispelling calamities for others. It is called the Wondrous Art of Night's Serene Dominion, and it is typically performed using the Supreme Yin divine abilities Bestowal of Profound Peal and the Woven Jade Radiance Chapter."

At the mention of these names, the two members of the Li family kept their composure, but their hearts skipped a beat. Che Hong, not noticing, glanced at their faces and said with some embarrassment,

"Unfortunately, our Dao Gate’s master cultivates three divine abilities, and he happens to lack these two…"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"Since the goal is to dispel a calamity, can the Wondrous Art of Night's Serene Dominion be performed by the Hengzhu Dao?"

Che Hong nodded.

"Of course. There are even a few other specific lineages that can achieve it. The 'Immortal Without Flaw' of Wu Earth, the 'Peace Through Concealment' of Molten Fire, and even the Pristine Water lineage… they have a concoction called 'Purging Dew,' which would also be a perfect remedy. But none of the Daoist Masters of my lineage possess these divine abilities…"

Hearing this, Li Ximing mentally discarded the idea of using a technique. Hengzhu had sealed its gates. Even if he had the heaven-defying power to find Chi Buzi, how could he possibly convince the Chunyi Dao Gate to hand over their secret arts to that infamous green-eyed ghost? They would likely attack each other on sight.

Yet, a flicker of secret delight sparked within him. He adopted a troubled expression and sighed.

"It seems we can only seek a solution through pill formulas."

Claiming to be a Supreme Yin lineage yet being unable to use its arts to help others was clearly a source of embarrassment for Che Hong. He nodded quickly.

"That can be arranged. My sect possesses the 'Cold Night Woven Jade Pill Scripture,' which records many profound and wondrous methods for concocting Supreme Yin pills. Within it is a section on Calamity-Averting Pill Arts. I am certain it will satisfy you, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing's own progress in alchemy had hit a bottleneck. The very name of this scripture made his heart itch with curiosity; he wished he could borrow the entire volume. But he knew it must be one of their foundational texts and couldn't bring himself to ask.

"Then I must trouble you, my friend," he said instead.

Che Hong immediately sent someone to fetch the scripture. Before he could say more, a streak of fiery red Li-Light descended, leaping and flaring as it landed on the Jade Terrace. The light quickly receded, revealing an old man.

He appeared quite advanced in years, dressed in red robes. He was not tall, but with a stout build and a round face, he looked solid and sturdy. His expression was an odd mixture of joy and anxiety. He bowed to each of the three men.

"Greetings to the three of you."

Straightening up, he turned to Che Hong with a smile.

"Brother Xi Chang! Thank you for your trouble!"

Che Hong gave a strange nod, but Li Jiangqian narrowed his eyes. 'He's also a Li Fire cultivator at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, yet he addresses a junior like Che Hong as 'brother'!'

Li Jiangqian smiled.

"Greetings, old senior."

"I don't deserve the honor…" The old Daoist Master shook his head hastily.

"Your noble clan is of imperial descent, your status is revered. Please do not flatter me. My surname is Wu, and my Daoist name is Ji'an. I am but a minor cultivator from a Daoist tradition of Beyond the Profound. My tradition is not mainstream, and my bloodline holds no prestige… I could never accept such an honor!"

Li Ximing had met his share of rogue cultivators, but never one so direct. He accepted the humble address and asked,

"Old Daoist Master, you are here for…?"

Ji'an sighed.

"I was originally a cultivator from the Northern Sea, but I came to reside in the Eastern Sea due to the shifts in the world's Spiritual Qi. I heard long ago of your clan's great Dao of Li Fire… I wished to trade for it, but I dared not get involved in the affairs of the Three Profoundities, so I sought the help of the Chunyi Dao Gate…"

"Later," he continued, "a Grotto-Heaven named Parting River Heaven appeared in the Northern Sea. A few friends invited me to explore it, and I thought that I lacked anything of sufficient value to trade with your clan. So I went. I gained much, but I was also injured and had to find a place to hide and recuperate… I missed many important events…"

Seeing the man's demeanor, Li Ximing already had a guess. He smiled.

"The Great Parting Scripture?"

"Precisely!" Ji'an's smile was polite, his eyes filled with hope. "The orthodox nature of Li Fire, two life-mandates, two arts, one body. This old man has already mastered the Grasp of Ninefold Heaven, Burning Annihilation, and Concordant Conquest, each one learned through a trial of life and death. I am but one step away from attempting the Purple Mystery… My hopes rest on the Great Parting Scripture!"

Before either of the Li clansmen could respond, Ji'an produced an object from his sleeve. It was a crimson-gold Daoist hairpin, the length of a finger and the thickness of a chopstick, with a sharp tip radiating a potent, fiery baleful aura.

He first laid it in his palm for them to inspect, then held it between two fingers. With a light flick, it transformed on the spot into a long spear covered in Dao patterns. The weapon was one zhang and two chi long, with a nine-cun, four-edged, prism-shaped spearhead. Dark red Dao patterns covered its surface, and a roiling, baleful Li-Light pulsed within it like magma deep within the earth, its glow shifting between light and shadow.

Ji'an glanced over and caught the look of astonishment in Li Ximing’s eyes. He smiled.

"This is the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear!"

Li Jiangqian slowly turned his head, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"Old Daoist Master, you have certainly come prepared."

Seeing no reaction from him, Ji'an grew anxious and began to explain,

"This artifact came from Parting River Heaven. It is a relic of the ancient Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. You must understand, the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion itself was a creation of the Encompassing Profoundity, which shows their mastery of Li Fire. This weapon has a long and storied history; it is by no means ordinary!"

Li Ximing said, "Do you mean to say this is a Spiritual Treasure?"

Ji'an paused, realizing the two before him were connoisseurs of fine things. He answered with some embarrassment,

"It doesn't quite reach that level. Parting River Heaven was sealed much later than Wanling Heaven… Although its quality is exceptionally high, it cannot be considered a creation from before the great celestial shift. It cannot compare to the Spiritual Treasures from the direct lineages of the Three Profoundities, let alone treasures like the Crystalline Jade Branch that serve as the foundation of an entire Dao lineage…"

Li Ximing observed the spear for a moment, making a quick assessment.

'Its quality is close to the Demonbane Cleaver Mace, but it is perfectly aligned with the Li Fire Dao, allowing its power to be fully unleashed. It should be at least on par with the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, though still inferior to the Huai River Map.'

The power of most Spiritual Artifacts was intrinsically tied to their compatibility with a cultivator's Dao-path. The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger that Li Ximing had since set aside was barely a mid-grade Spiritual Artifact, and its mismatched lineage was a great pity. Even a weapon as powerful as the Demonbane Cleaver Mace was merely a handy tool for him, since he did not cultivate Profound Thunder.

'I should find an opportunity to trade it,' he thought.

While Li Ximing was lost in his thoughts, Li Jiangqian eyed the artifact and deliberately feigned disinterest.

"I have heard of a Grotto-Heaven that fell in the Northern Sea. So it was Parting River Heaven. What Dao lineage did it belong to? And why did it fall?"

Ji'an took a shallow breath, choosing his words carefully.

"I do not fully understand the intricacies myself. I only heard talk of the Heavenly Element and the Wanling Daoist tradition… In short, they used these legacies of the Encompassing Profoundity to open another of their Grotto-Heavens… But this time was different. There were many cultivators still inside. Some geniuses were selected and taken away, while others were resettled. As for the Daoist tradition—it was called the Profound Si Daoist tradition."

He quickly looked up, changing the subject and speaking with sincerity.

"I am willing to trade this weapon for the Great Parting Scripture and the Spiritual Qi to cultivate it. I hope your noble clan will help me complete my Dao!"

Li Jiangqian shook his head with a smile.

"Senior, perhaps you are unaware. This cultivation method of mine is of primordial origin, no ordinary art. It is powerful enough to serve as the ultimate treasure of an immortal sect. Once mastered, a single breath of heart-fire can rival the full might of the Purple Mansion Realm. It is beyond comparison with common techniques."

'No wonder his aura is so extraordinary!' Ji'an thought, his expression one of profound shock. His private speculation had just been confirmed. He looked up, not with alarm, but with delight.

"That is even better!"

He was decisive. Swallowing his reluctance, he said with a pained expression,

"Since Your Highness has brought up Li Fire, I happen to be nurturing a special flame at my mountain gate. I will fetch it for you!"

At this, Li Ximing’s heart began to pound with excitement. Li Jiangqian, however, wore an inscrutable look and sighed.

"I understand your sincerity, old master. But my clan is situated between the north and south. This technique is our foundation. If I were to share it carelessly, I fear it might one day be turned against me."

He saw the situation with perfect clarity. For Ji'an, going to Parting River Heaven was, on the surface, a quest for treasures to trade. In truth, he had almost certainly heard a rumor of finding the complete Dao lineage there. Having failed, he was now seeking the next best thing. That was why he hadn't approached the Li family sooner—if he had found the scripture in the Grotto-Heaven, he would have had no need of them.

But this meant one thing: the Dao lineage of the 'Great Parting Scripture' was so rare it couldn't even be found in a lost Grotto-Heaven.

'It is also known as the Art of Gazing Upon and Describing the Sun, after all,' Li Jiangqian mused. 'It carries a trace of the Supreme Yang.'

Logically, the value Ji'an offered was by no means low. But this was no fair trade. If the Li clan was willing to be ruthless, they held his entire future in their hands. This technique was a rare commodity that could be leveraged to make him do anything. Its true value was inestimable.

Ji'an understood this as well. At Li Jiangqian’s slight pause, a smile bloomed on the old man’s face.

"The Chunyi Dao Gate can vouch for me! I will never bring harm to Your Highness! And I swear never to pass this on to outsiders or bequeath it to my descendants!"

"And… and… I have heard that Daoist Master Zhaojing possesses a formidable Li-Light art, and that King Wei has an induction art that is also of the orthodox Li Fire nature. My own Dao lineage is incomplete, and I would be very interested in trading for those as well… If you are willing to part with the major and minor techniques and their legacies, this old man will not be stingy."

At these words, Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow, a smile touching his eyes.

'A clever response. It preserves some dignity.'

Did Ji'an truly want more techniques? He was already ancient and about to attempt his fourth divine ability upon reaching the Purple Mystery. He had long since mastered all the arts he needed; it was too late to learn new ones. And since he wouldn't pass them on, what was the point? It was simply a way to sweeten the deal, to put more on the table—useful or not—so the Li clan wouldn't look so greedy, and he wouldn't look so desperate. It allowed both sides to save face.

Although the old Daoist Master’s attitude was deferential, he had survived as a rogue cultivator for centuries and possessed an orthodox Li Fire. His skills were undoubtedly profound. The Li family could not afford to make an enemy of him. Li Jiangqian feigned hesitation, sighing and shaking his head. Taking the cue, Li Ximing gritted his teeth and said,

"Very well… so long as you can produce something of equal value, I will agree to the exchange!"

Ji'an's eyes lit up. He felt no sense of loss at all.

"Spoken like a true imperial descendant! This grace of completing my Dao… I shall never forget it for as long as I live!"

He hastily retrieved a box from his sleeve and opened it with great care. Nestled within the ornate jade box was a small, red apricot, the size of a fingernail. It seemed to pulse like a tiny, dancing flame, delicate and alluring, and was surrounded by faint, multicolored halos of light.

The moment it appeared, a profound shift occurred within Li Jiangqian. The Talisman Qi in his body reacted, and a subtle yet deep hunger washed over him, lingering in his mind. The life-mandate induction fire in his core flared and pulsed, threatening to surge forth at any moment.

'What a magnificent spiritual treasure!'

This visceral hunger caused his expression to waver. Ji'an, however, looked on with an expression of deep, heart-wrenching pain.

"This is called a Parting Si Apricot Fruit. I suffered grievous injuries in the Grotto-Heaven just to obtain it!"

"A Profound Si Treasure Apricot tree grew in that Grotto-Heaven," he explained. "It was like a living font of Li Fire, and its heat warped the very fabric of the Grotto-Heaven. Of the fruits upon it… the large ones were ancient, while the smaller ones were newly grown. There were three large, eighteen medium, and thirty-six small in total. The largest one was the size of a man’s fist!"

Li Jiangqian’s eyes fixed on him.

"Who took it?"

Ji'an sighed in resignation.

"People from the Feather-Shedding Land arrived. A great personage took the Profound Si Treasure Apricot tree itself. But before leaving, as a gesture of fairness, a highness from beneath the Tree of One Heart shook the tree three times. Nine fruits the width of two fingers fell, along with twenty-two that were finger-sized. The slaughter that ensued… it blotted out the sun and made rivers of blood flow."

"My abilities are limited. I was close enough to seize the initial advantage and snatched three of the small ones, but I was forced to give one up while being pursued. I escaped with two. Fearing I would be ambushed on my way back to the Eastern Sea, I found a place to enter seclusion."

He let out another long, quiet sigh.

"My breakthrough to the Purple Mystery depends on this one spiritual apricot. I offer one today, first as payment for completing my Dao lineage, and second…"

At this point, he rose from his seat and bowed low, startling Li Ximing, who quickly moved to avoid the gesture. The old man spoke with sincere humility.

"Li Fire is ill-suited for alchemy. I must ask Daoist Master Zhaojing to refine this fruit into a pill for me!"




# Chapter 1170: Intercalary Yin

When Li Ximing heard this, he finally understood. He praised the idea internally.

'So that's the plan. He wants to resolve everything at once, without having to petition two different families.'

Ji'an’s plan was, in a word, perfect. Li Ximing’s mastery of the pill Dao was renowned not only on the mainland but throughout the Eastern Sea as well, placing him among the foremost alchemists in the world. Furthermore, the Li Fire and Bright Yang lineages were closely related. Since Li Fire cultivators could not refine pills themselves, who better to turn to than a Bright Yang master like him?

He smiled and asked, “Senior, do you have a pill formula on hand?”

Apprehension still lingered in Ji'an’s eyes. He pressed his hands together and said,

“I have a few, but they are merely scattered formulas, none of which are worthy of such a spiritual fruit… In my view, its medicinal properties must not be broken apart. They must be fused into a single Mystic Pill!”

Li Ximing had expected as much. Li Jiangqian, however, began to laugh.

“So, Daoist Master, you’ve traded a fire and an instrument for one of our family's cultivation arts, and now you wish to trade the Parting Si Apricot Fruit for our Dao Lineage. But whether it’s the life-mandate induction art or the Li-Light wondrous method, how could they be worth only a single spiritual object? The life-mandate induction art, in particular, is noble and profound. For an elder senior such as yourself seeking to transcend the Purple Mystery, it would be an invaluable reference.”

Li Jiangqian still felt the offer was insufficient, but his words were pleasant, prompting Ji'an to reconsider. The newly ascended Daoist Master continued,

“How about this, my family will keep the Li-Light wondrous method for ourselves and provide you only with the life-mandate induction art. This will satisfy our desire to keep something of our Dao Lineage private.”

Ji'an didn’t particularly care how many techniques he received in the exchange, so he breathed a sigh of relief and agreed. But just as the young man before him relented on one point, he immediately seized upon another.

“Pill refinement, however, is a different matter entirely. There are the monarch, minister, assistant, and envoy ingredients—countless spiritual resources that you will still need to provide. Not to mention, since this will be a great pill, the labor will be even more taxing on my family’s elder…”

Li Jiangqian’s words were veiled, but he was alluding to a common practice in alchemy—a refiner would typically keep one or two pills from a successful batch. Since this was to be a single, unique Mystic Pill, there would be no extras to take.

At his advanced age, Ji'an naturally understood the implication. His eyes burned brightly, and rather than being alarmed, he seemed almost pleased.

“If you can truly forge a Mystic Pill, I will certainly not be stingy with my gratitude!”

A faint smile touched Li Jiangqian’s lips.

“There’s an old saying: a well-fed guard is a loyal guard. Since you’ve given me the Parting Si Apricot Fruit, there will be many times in the future when we will need your experience. A favor is a favor, but this should also put your mind at ease.”

Ji'an looked up, a hint of surprise in his eyes. He glanced at Li Jiangqian, marveling inwardly as he understood the young man’s meaning.

If they truly wanted to be unscrupulous, the Li family could easily tamper with the pill. They could secretly refine the spiritual fruit into a mother-son pill, keeping the smaller one for themselves and using the larger one to deceive him. Forging all the spiritual ingredients into a single pill was incredibly difficult; splitting them into two would actually be easier.

If their methods were flawless, he would never know the difference. With Li Ximing’s superb alchemy skills and a host of supplementary ingredients, Ji'an likely wouldn’t even be able to tell the difference after consuming it.

Li Ximing himself hadn’t even considered such a scheme, but Li Jiangqian had been the Family Head for a long time. He was well-versed in all the dirty tricks exchanged between rogue cultivators and clans. He handled the situation with practiced ease, pointing out the potential for deceit with a smile.

Ji'an feared entanglement with karma in Jiangnan and likely wouldn’t be able to personally oversee the pill’s creation. He would rather the other party ask for more upfront than have the single remaining chance in his life ruined by their greed. Hearing Li Jiangqian address this suspicion directly, and also hint at using him as a reference for a future breakthrough to the Purple Mystery, all of Ji'an’s doubts vanished.

“With how your clan conducts its affairs… I can be completely at ease!” he praised.

Li Jiangqian smiled without a word. Though he had only just reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he needed no grand oaths. He had already gained the upper hand in their negotiation. Ji'an stroked his beard and nodded, willingly conceding.

“I have also spoken plainly with His Highness. I will naturally be the one to find the supplementary ingredients for this furnace… I have already made some preparations. It may well empty my life’s savings, but even though I have lived this long in vain, I still have some connections. I should be able to gather two or three sets of the spiritual resources to offer as payment.”

Li Jiangqian lowered his gaze slightly, calculating how much more he could squeeze from the old man. Li Ximing, however, was observing Che Hong’s attitude. He put down his cup and sent a telepathic message.

'The grand formation west of Ting Province must be established, and it requires spiritual resources. We might as well agree. It can be considered giving face to the Chunyi Dao Gate… After all, if he transcends the Purple Mystery, he’ll be a Great Daoist Master.'

After this quiet persuasion from Li Ximing, Li Jiangqian put on a show of sighing deeply. He looked at Ji'an and said,

“Since we share the same Dao Lineage, I will treat you as a fellow sect member. There will be much I need to ask of you in the future… Please allow me to impose upon you then!”

Hearing that the Li family had agreed, Ji'an was overjoyed. He thanked them twice before his expression turned serious.

“From now on, I will be a guest at Chunyi. Changli, feel free to seek me out whenever you wish!”

With an agreement reached, the old man’s face broke into a wide smile, the wrinkles crinkling with joy. He placed the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear on its box and pushed them both forward.

“My spiritual fires were originally stored at my old sect on Mount Pai'er. Who would have thought that while I was away, the spiritual atmosphere in Cang Province shifted, causing a great flood that damaged two of my spiritual fires. It has taken until today for them to recover!”

The old man did not leave immediately. Li Jiangqian chuckled, then produced a blank jade slip. His spiritual sense converged within it, and strands of Li-Light gathered upon its surface, turning it as red as fire. He handed it to Ji'an.

“Please.”

Ji'an nodded repeatedly, accepting it with both hands. He closed his eyes and began to read with ravenous intensity. After a long moment, his eyes filled with shock. He let out a long breath and sighed,

“Truly wondrous! Truly wondrous…”

He had only heard Li Jiangqian claim it was comparable to the ultimate treasures of an immortal sect and had assumed it was an exaggeration. He never imagined that every word would be so exquisite, far surpassing his own former techniques. Joy filled Ji'an’s heart.

'Good… There wasn’t a single false word…'

As his spiritual sense withdrew, the Li Fire clinging to the jade slip began to flare, shattering the slip into pieces. In a slight daze, Ji'an stepped into the Great Void, leaving a single sentence hanging over the Jade Terrace.

“Please wait a moment!”

As the old man hurried away, Che Hong finally spoke.

“Many thanks to both Daoist Masters for making this possible!”

He was already holding a jade slip. He presented it to Li Ximing with a solemn expression.

“These are three types of disaster-averting pill formulas from the Cold Night Woven Jade Pill Scripture that can be refined by outsiders. Please, Daoist Master, take a look!”

Che Hong hadn’t even stated his request, which put Li Ximing in an awkward position. He felt he couldn’t accept it, but couldn’t refuse it either.

"It would be improper to take your esteemed sect’s precious methods for nothing…” he said politely.

Che Hong’s expression was one of resignation.

“You’re too kind, Daoist Master. While this pill scripture is indeed precious, in the past several hundred years, it has been used for refinement no more than ten times. Even fewer cultivators have come to borrow it… Please, read it first… we can discuss compensation later.”

Li Ximing had no choice but to accept the jade slip and close his eyes to read.

The three pills were the Azure Step Flawless Pill, which used Yin-Leap Qi as its monarch herb; the Mystic Shore Spirit-Guiding Pill, which used Shore Ya Moon Treasure as its monarch herb; and the Yin Solemn Treasure Body Powder, which used Deep Night Solemn Qi as its monarch herb.

Not only had he never heard of these monarch herbs, but the various techniques and keys within the formulas were exceedingly difficult. Taking the easiest of them, the Yin Solemn Treasure Body Powder, as an example, its difficulty was on par with the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill of years past.

Seeing Li Ximing deep in thought, Che Hong sighed.

“In this day and age, it’s difficult enough to find a single Supreme Yang or Supreme Yin spiritual resource, let alone the specific ones required by these formulas!”

Li Ximing opened his eyes, his expression complicated.

“Is there no other way?” he asked tentatively.

Che Hong paused, choosing his words carefully.

“You should be aware of the Clear Yin Womb Herb… This item has the wondrous ability to generate all things. Its lower-body aspects form Valley Water, while its upper aspects form Supreme Yin. My sect possesses a secret art called the Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method, which can transform it into one of these three spiritual items for you!”

Although he said this, he didn't hold out much hope. If it weren't for the fact that Ting Province was backed by the fox clan, making it highly likely that Supreme Yin spiritual items remained, he wouldn’t have even brought it up. He could have just told Li Ximing the names of the monarch herbs and let him retreat in the face of such difficulty.

As expected, a troubled look appeared on Li Ximing’s face. Li Jiangqian, who had been listening all this time, felt a stir in his heart.

'The Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method, a transmuting art…'

As his eyes filled with contemplation, Li Ximing had already made up his mind. He cupped his hands and said,

“I will inquire about these spiritual items… but your esteemed sect has studied the Supreme Yin for many years. Do you have any spiritual items or resources that could serve as substitutes?”

Che Hong hesitated.

“Yes, our sect does have access to a few sources of Supreme Yin resources, as well as several types of spiritual qi. However, we have none in our vaults at present. I can try to find some for you…”

Li Ximing had previously obtained Nightshade Spirit Grass from the Chunyi Dao Gate, which he had sent to the Qusi long ago when forging the halberd for Li Zhouwei. He also needed several Supreme Yin resources as assistant ingredients. With the favor from Ji'an, he felt at ease accepting the offer and fell silent, pondering.

Li Jiangqian waited a moment. Seeing that the two had finished their discussion, he tentatively asked,

“The Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method… to think such a wondrous art exists, capable of such simple transmutation. When I look upon the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, it is like gazing up at a great mountain!”

Although the Supreme Yang had lost its luster in the current age, Che Hong still smiled and nodded at the compliment.

“The ancient era was filled with countless wondrous arts and techniques. To obtain even a fraction of one is to possess incredible power. It is a pity our sect only obtained this single art. I have heard that there is a corresponding art in the Immortal Mansion called the Elucidating Transformation Na Yuan Intercalary Method. It can harmonize all waters, allowing one type of water virtue to transform into another… The wonders within are beyond words!”

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian felt a jolt. Even Li Ximing, who had only caught fragments of the conversation, looked up. A strange feeling bloomed in both their hearts.

'To change one type of water virtue into another… this is…'

'The Intercalary Sun Art?!'

The Li family ancestor had obtained that art from Daoist Master Junjian. It was a wondrous technique for converting one type of fire virtue into another, and they had benefited from it immensely over the years, giving them many paths of retreat. As their family climbed step by step to the pinnacle, they came to realize just how terrifying the art was. Now, hearing of such a similar technique, how could they not feel a sense of dissonance?

'In that case, the art in the Immortal Mansion is… its counterpart, the Intercalary Yin Art?'

A tempest of thoughts raged in Li Jiangqian’s mind. He put on a look of amazement and asked,

“Such an immortal art actually exists! Could you elaborate on it?”

Che Hong paused for a second but found nothing strange in the request. What cultivator with divine abilities wouldn’t stop to ask about such an immortal art? He organized his thoughts and said,

“Its origins can no longer be traced, but it is said to be a secret art passed down within the ancient Three Profoundities. It’s unknown which of the Profound Heads first passed it down, but it spread through exchanges between their Dao Lineages…”

He chuckled, then added pointedly,

“Of course, this 'spread' was only among the direct lineages of the Three Profoundities. They used it to convert spiritual items and practice special techniques. Some say it contains the great Dao of intercalation and surplus; others say it holds the wondrous art of weaving jade and concentrating radiance. Even… True Monarch Chilang of the Heavenly Lang Terrace once revealed during a sermon that it ‘contains the Dao of derivation and the power of transmutation. To master eighty or ninety percent of it is to shed the shell of immortal or god and enter the gate of the true beginning.’”

Li Ximing was silent for a long time before he murmured,

“Shed the shell of immortal or god… Cultivators in this age flock to nothing more than becoming an immortal, attaining the Dao, and taking a golden position. Is being an immortal or a god still not enough?”

Accustomed to reading ancient texts, Che Hong hadn't found it strange. But now that Li Ximing pointed it out, he too was taken aback. He chewed on the words for a moment before replying,

“In the ancient era, the concepts of intercalation and surplus were complete. What they called 'immortals and gods' were likely more than a single step away from the absolute peak.”

Li Jiangqian silently committed this to memory, but he was more focused on the practical applications of the Intercalary Yin Art and the Intercalary Sun Art. 

“You mentioned that this immortal art contains the great Dao of intercalation and surplus… I wonder whose theory that was, and which True Monarch achieved it?” he asked quietly.

Che Hong smiled.

“That can be considered a doctrine of my Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. As for achievements, they are countless. A famous example… would be the True Monarch with the Daoist name Chongli. He established the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion, which was the backer of the Chu State. Later, a descendant from the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion, with the Daoist name Nan Zhao, tried to walk his old path. Unfortunately, he failed just short of success…”

'Nan Zhao…'

Realization dawned instantly in Li Ximing’s mind.

The name was not unfamiliar. It belonged to the original owner of the Spiritual Treasure in Li Jiangqian’s hands, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument. His secular name was Lu, and he had even left behind the Southern Li Ingestion Method within the treasure.

'His last words are within the Spiritual Treasure. He wished to turn the tide, to ascend to an auxiliary position of Li Fire to save the dire situation of the Encompassing Profoundity. It’s a pity he ultimately fell, leaving behind only a name and a single, regretful sentence passed down to this day…'

He merely felt a sense of melancholy, but Li Jiangqian seemed to have grasped something crucial. He silently clutched the Spiritual Treasure in his sleeve, which resembled a Golden Core, his expression deeply thoughtful.

'The position of Li Fire has a master. Without seeking the path of surplus or intercalation, one cannot forge a Golden Core!'

'With the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion’s legacy—the Southern Li Ingestion Method and the Intercalary Sun Art—in my hands, I already have the qualifications to investigate further. This is my opportunity… and it is very likely… the path I must walk in the future!'

He was lost in thought, but in a mere moment, the old man clad in crimson Li Fire robes had returned, stepping out of the Great Void and striding closer, his face beaming with joy.

“Daoist Masters! Please, look!”

In his palm rested a small incense burner. It was made of brass, depicting phoenixes vying for flames and inscribed with profound Daoist patterns. Inside, black sand was piled high. Though it was no bigger than his palm, the grains were fine and numerous, as if an entire black desert had been shrunk into the burner.

As he channeled his divine ability, a thumb-sized Li Fire bloomed within the censer. It was a unique, jade-like brownish-yellow, covered in dense, intricate patterns that gave it an exquisitely refined appearance.

Ji'an smiled.

“This is the Vast Desert Li Flame. I obtained it from the Feather-Shedding Land. It possesses an endlessly generating flame and an aura of boundless immensity. It cannot be used for alchemy or artifact refinement, but it holds a magnificent and righteous intent of both envelopment and destruction. In this day and age, it is truly a rare sight!”

“This flame is one of the few that does not fear Earth Virtue. So long as there is a flaw in an Earth Virtue, this flame will have a chance to surge forth. It is especially effective at suppressing the Manifestations Earth aspect of Earth Virtue!”




# Chapter 1170: Grand Mound

"The Vast Desert Li Flame…"

When it came to the Dao of spiritual flames, Li Ximing was a true master. The moment the Vast Desert Li Flame appeared, he sensed its unique and marvelous properties.

'It actually has a hint of smoke and sand… how rare!'

A spiritual flame from the Purple Mansion Realm was a treasure anywhere. His eyes burned with desire, and he wished he could refine it on the spot with his Talisman Qi to test its power. For now, he suppressed the urge, drawing out only a single wisp of its fiery aura to inspect.

Li Jiangqian also examined it for a moment and found his impression of it quite favorable. However, noticing that their host didn't mention its might, he smiled.

"Since it has been blended with other Daos, I imagine its power, as a flame of orthodox nature, must be a notch weaker."

Ji'an immediately extended two fingers and lightly tapped the incense burner. A peculiar, jade-like, brownish-yellow flame leaped out, erupting into a conflagration that swept across the heavens. Above the sky of the Jade Terrace, it manifested a vast desert.

Within this desert, fierce flames blazed. Li-Light formed its sands, casting a pale, ochre hue. Baleful Fire Qi became its mist, glowing with the light of brown jade. As he poured more of his dharma power and divine abilities into it, the desert expanded relentlessly, casting an immense shadow upon the ground below.

For a moment, the world shook. The white-robed disciples of the Chunyi Dao Gate raised their heads one after another, staring in terror and awe at the Li Fire desert in the sky, which pulsed with an overwhelming aura of destruction.

Che Hong shook his head, moving with a hint of resignation to calm his disciples. Ji'an, however, chuckled.

"To say it's weaker isn't quite right. I obtained this flame when I was first making my name. For a time, I relied on it to leave the Feather-Shedding Land and travel the world. I've nurtured it for many years. If not for that great flood in Cang Province that shattered its spiritual concept and turned my meticulous nurturing methods into a hindrance, this flame's quality would be exceptional."

He paused briefly, and then, fearing the two might read too much into his words, quickly offered a guarantee.

"Even so, its foundation is solid. Among Li Fires, its power is middle-tier, but its true strength lies in its vastness, like a desert. With this marvelous aspect amplifying it, it can hold its own in the upper-middle tier against any foe."

Li Ximing had been watching intently and now had a good measure of it.

'It's probably comparable to the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame.'

He had acquired the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame many years ago. In terms of raw power, it was actually a fraction weaker than this Vast Desert Li Flame. After all, the strength of the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame lay in its innate spirituality, which could neither be increased nor diminished.

"Excellent!"

The Li Fire in the sky poured back down, condensing in Ji'an's hand and returning to a finger-sized, jade-like flame. A flicker of excitement finally crossed Li Jiangqian's face. He stood, accepted it gently, and smiled.

"My thanks, Senior! The Spiritual Qi from the Great Parting Scripture is the Bright Parting Blazing Essence. I will have it sent to the Chunyi Dao Gate as soon as I return to the lake!"

Ji'an laughed heartily.

"It's no trouble," he said politely. "A day or two makes no difference."

With this great matter concluded, both host and guests were pleased. As Ji'an's elixir was not yet complete, he was inclined to foster goodwill and remained by their side. Li Ximing, however, was already preparing to leave. His true purpose revealed at last, he adopted a thoughtful expression, looked toward Che Hong, and sighed.

"The Clear Yin Womb Herb is exceedingly rare, and many other Supreme Yin spiritual items depend on fortune. I may have some leads, but I fear my ignorance will lead to me being deceived. Perhaps… I could consult the illustrated records and secret archives of your Daoist tradition."

He didn't give Che Hong a chance to refuse, adding immediately,

"I am willing to offer other scriptures in exchange!"

With the need for spiritual resources so pressing at the moment, Li Ximing had become more frugal. He drew a jade slip from his sleeve, one that recorded the outlines of several of his clan's cultivation arts, and pressed it into Che Hong's hand.

The Li Clan's current Daoist repository was both profound and extensive. The Daoist Master had intended to refuse, but a quick glance at the slip brought a look of shock to his eyes. The words caught in his throat.

"If I don't accept this," he said awkwardly, "I'm afraid you won't be at ease, fellow Daoist."

"It is always better to have reciprocity," Li Ximing said, giving him an easy way out.

Che Hong feigned a conflicted expression.

"An elder of my family once had a fortuitous encounter and obtained a fine treasure. The technique, the Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise, would be of great use to our Dao…"

The Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise was a method for nurturing spiritual artifacts that Li Zhouwei had obtained from a grotto-heaven. But the Li Clan simply lacked the resources and capacity to refine such a treasured vase, and so the art had gone unused. Li Ximing hadn't even considered that Che Hong would be interested in it.

"I will transcribe a copy for you at once!" he said magnanimously.

The treatise seemed to be of immense value in Che Hong's eyes. He thanked him profusely, a hint of indebtedness in his expression, but then he gave another awkward smile.

"Actually… my family has also been searching for the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture for many years. We always assumed it was in the hands of the Golden Feather Sect and never thought to ask…"

"Oh?" Li Ximing paused, then realization dawned.

"Of course… your clan's expertise in the Daos of the Water Mansion and Pit Water is also quite profound."

Che Hong's hesitation grew more apparent. He glanced at Ji'an and smiled.

"I will see the two Daoist Masters out."

His meaning was clear to all three of them; he had something private to say. Although Ji'an was curious, the sheer joy of securing his path forward made him disinclined to meddle. He smiled, cupped his hands in farewell, and departed in a flash of flame.

Once the old man was gone, Che Hong stopped walking. He looked up, his expression grave.

"Daoist Master, what do you know of the Chen Clan of Lingyu? Has that scripture already reached Daoist Master Xiao?"

'Xiao Chuting…'

When Li Ximing had gone to Cang Province to offer his congratulations all those years ago, the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture had been hidden within the gift box of spiritual items. It had, of course, been given to Daoist Master Xiao long ago. His expression hardened.

"I'm not familiar with them…"

Seeing that he only gave half an answer, Che Hong understood that Li Ximing was still on guard. He didn't find it strange and simply gave a wry smile.

"This is not something I should be discussing, but a few days ago… I heard a piece of news. A certain Daoist Master Su successfully forged his divine ability, broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, and was granted an audience with the Emperor of Shu. This will not be a secret for much longer, which is why I dared to ask you for the scripture."

'Daoist Master Su? Su Yan!'

Li Ximing's heart jolted.

He was no stranger to that name. It was through the Golden Feather Sect's mediation back then that the Li Clan had handed over the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture to complete that man's Dao lineage. In return, they had earned a favor—a favor that resulted in the Golden Feather Sect, despite pressure from the Shu Court, bypassing Ting Province. That was the only reason Moongaze Lake had been spared from greater losses, and why Li Ximing himself had escaped with only minor injuries.

Daoist Master Tianhuo's words, 'The favor from back then is repaid to fellow Daoist Zhaojing today,' referred to exactly this!

'That junior has reached the Purple Mansion Realm… Considering the time, and with the full backing of a Golden Core Dao lineage and an ancient inheritance, it's not surprising…'

Li Ximing looked up thoughtfully. Che Hong, observing his expression, said hesitantly,

"The Chen Clan's origins can be traced back to the ancient True Monarch of Encompassing Profoundity, to the bloodline of the ancient Grand Mound Kingdom. The Great River and Grand Mound Scripture was the foundational art of the Chen Clan back then. They even established a mystic realm with it, located in the former Grand Mound Kingdom, in what is now Badger Prefecture, north of Luoxia."

"For generations, the descendants of the Chen Clan have been trying to return to their ancestral land. Chen Xuanli once reached the realm of Great Daoist Master and intended to go to Badger Prefecture to reopen the mystic realm, but due to obstruction from many sides, he failed…"

Li Ximing's expression shifted slightly.

"Obstruction from many sides?"

Che Hong spoke evasively.

"The complexities are not for a junior cultivator like me to speak of. In short, the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture is tied to this fortuitous opportunity. This opportunity originally belonged to the Chen Clan, but the Su Clan intermarried with them for many years in ancient times and thus also has a claim…"

Li Jiangqian was lost in thought, but Che Hong's expression grew complicated.

"During the Ning State era, the great clans frequently intermarried. My Xi Clan originated from Gaoping Prefecture, but over the years, we also became entangled by blood with the Chen Clan. By rights, we also have a claim. Our Daoist tradition even possesses three volumes on 'Pit Water,' which Daoist Master Xiao himself once came to trade for."

"But after Chen Xuanli, a Great Daoist Master, was forced to his death, our Xi Clan ancestors sensed something was amiss. Fearing we would be seen as having ambitions, we didn't even dare to cultivate the 'Pit Water' arts! Only now, seeing that Daoist Master Su has reached the Purple Mansion Realm, have we dared to entertain the thought of completing a viable path for a future Great Daoist Master of our own!"

Li Ximing finally understood. He frowned.

"Then what does any of this… have to do with Daoist Master Xiao?"

Che Hong gave a bitter laugh.

"The Chen Clan of Lingyu had two great loyal vassal clans. The first was named Xiao, the second Quan. Initially, they did not intermarry. But as the Chen Clan declined, they were forced to rely on outsiders, and internal marriages began. The mother of that Xiao Clan's Xiao Jinzhou was from the direct line of the Chen Clan!"

A shiver went down Li Ximing's spine.

"Does Senior Xiao also have a claim to this opportunity?" he asked.

Che Hong lowered his voice and used a secret art to transmit his words.

'He should have… but now he doesn't… He played the Golden Feather Sect and the Azure Pond against each other perfectly. His methods are so brilliant that even the Daoist Masters of the Golden Feather Sect can't scheme against him. He's on the verge of becoming a Great Daoist Master himself. Who would be able to take anything from his hands?'

'If that weren't the case, why would they need Su Yan? The Golden Feather Sect is deliberately holding him back. If he obtains this scripture, he'll just end up as a second Chen Xuanli! My clan's Great Daoist Master once estimated that Daoist Master Xiao is also waiting—waiting for someone to open that place for him…'

Li Ximing had never imagined such a complex web of connections. He was stunned.

'Doesn't that mean… he'll be going up against the Golden Feather Sect?!'

Unlike the blatant power of Luoxia and the Underworld, the terror of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition was a silent, pervasive thing that all feared. Forget a Great Daoist Master who was practically a rogue cultivator… even a descendant of a Golden Core clan would feel a tremor of fear before the Zhang family!

'I knew his path of seeking the Dao would be difficult, but I never imagined it would be _this_ difficult!'

Though his heart was reeling, he only said,

"Since that is the case, I will certainly help Chunyi. If you require any spiritual resources for alchemy later, I will have to trouble you, Daoist Master."

Che Hong naturally nodded in agreement and had the disciples waiting below see them out. As Li Ximing stepped into the Great Void, his heart was still in turmoil.

'So it's true… it wasn't just about letting Su Yan seize all the opportunities in Wanling Heaven… No wonder the Golden Feather Sect was so persistent for centuries. No wonder that favor was so great!'

'During the Ning State era, the great clans intermarried. Was the Xi Clan the only one? Could the Ning Li Clan have shared blood ties as well? If my ancestors hadn't been killed, if they had truly reached the Purple Mansion Realm and opened the Daoist repository, they might have been absorbed by the Golden Feather Sect…'

'And Daoist Master Xiao… was he really only after the way of the sword immortals back then? …Perhaps he had the foresight to see all this…'

His thoughts were a tangled mess. After a long period of contemplation, they finally returned to Moongaze Lake and landed within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Li Jiangqian, meanwhile, was holding the flame, his mind wandering. Even though he cultivated the Great Parting Scripture, he lacked Li Ximing's ability to refine it in an instant. Golden patterns were slowly crawling over the flame, bit by bit subduing it.

'The Daoist Tradition of Encompassing Profoundity…'

Lost in their own thoughts, the two soon arrived and took their seats. Li Jiangqian glanced around but didn't see Li Zhouwei. Figuring he was likely in the pavilion below where the Supreme Yin Qi was denser, he asked, "Are Father's injuries still serious?"

Li Ximing shook his head. "They're not a problem for now, but it would be best to eradicate them completely."

Reassured by his words, Li Jiangqian placed both the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear and the Parting Si Apricot Fruit on the jade table. "I leave them to your discretion, Grand-Uncle," he said respectfully.

"My, how polite you've become." Li Ximing casually pushed them back toward him. His expression turned serious. "The Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear is straightforward, but what are your plans for the Parting Si Apricot Fruit?"

Li Jiangqian explained, "My Great Parting Scripture has a 'Heart Mansion' that is exceptionally good at containing spiritual plants and items. Unlike others who would waste its essence by consuming it directly, my method is no worse than refining it into an elixir…"

At this, Li Ximing smiled and shook his head. "Alchemy is not a simple matter of harvesting essence. With the right one or two complementary spiritual resources, you can bring out twelve-tenths of its benefits! It should still be refined into an elixir."

But Li Jiangqian's tone shifted as he reminded him, "Grand-Uncle, my Greedy Snare of Profound Li is an art that devours the life-mandate. Its nature is to kill and destroy the Dao. I must consume the spiritual fruit directly to achieve the greatest effect. If it is refined into an elixir… it will only have the effects of an elixir."

"I see!" Li Ximing replied, a thoughtful look on his face. "So you will consume it directly now?"

"Indeed!"

Li Jiangqian lifted the lid of the jade box, revealing the perfectly round, lustrous apricot that looked like a supreme treasure. His throat moved as he swallowed, and he said softly, "Refining a great elixir requires no small amount of time and effort. It will take Ji'an years to complete his. If he were to refine one for me as well, who knows how many more years it would take. Once I've finished refining the Vast Desert Li Flame, I will enter seclusion to consume the Parting Si Apricot Fruit. There is no need to trouble the elders."

Li Ximing nodded in agreement. Li Jiangqian then searched his robes and took out a box from his sleeve. "Back then, the elders took my spiritual phenomenon and tasked me with refining resources from it, telling me to keep them for myself," he said seriously. "Now, with expenses rising everywhere for the elders, I will no longer keep this to myself!"

Inside the box was a shimmering, golden Li-water, burning with a transparent flame. Though there was only a thin layer and the quantity was small, its quality was not low. It even gave off the faint scent of a spiritual extract.

Li Ximing did not stand on ceremony and accepted it silently. Seeing Li Jiangqian sit cross-legged in the pavilion, he rose to his feet. Suppressing the injury in his lungs, he coughed twice.

In truth, Li Ximing had also been grievously injured in the great battle. His condition had only improved after his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body took a portion of the damage. Having dragged it out for this long, he was inevitably feeling some discomfort.

But he didn't rush to heal himself. With a shake of his sleeve, he produced a small statue. The object grew with the wind, its skin becoming smooth and warm, its expression thoughtful, as if it were a living person. The nameplate at its waist, inscribed with 'Li Gufeng,' swayed gently, emitting a faint glow.

Li Ximing studied it for a moment, then made a quick calculation with his fingers. A smile of eager anticipation spread across his face. He brought two fingers together, drew out the Light of the Six Harmonies from his divine ability, and tapped the spot between the brow of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body. After placing several jade slips in its lap, he finally sat down cross-legged to heal his injuries.

As he gradually entered a state of meditation, the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, in a rather unsettling manner, slowly opened its eyes. Its gaze was blank, yet it already possessed a spark of spiritual life. It stiffly raised its hands and, incredibly, began to read and ponder!

It was being controlled by a sliver of Li Ximing's consciousness.

The Surrogate Body Ascension Art had elevated the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body to a state where it could avert disaster and ward off calamities. Combined with the World's Radiance, it was already formidable. The recent enhancement from Sealing the Life-Mandate had finally caused a quantitative change to become a qualitative one, pushing it over a critical threshold.

'Although controlling it while my main body is active makes it a bit sluggish, and it's far from the seamless, effortless nature of Tinglan's Path-Crossing Warrant, which could fool even a Purple Mansion cultivator, it still represents a monumental leap!'

Seeing Tinglan's warrant and her ambulatory body all those years ago had filled him with envy. Now, after so long, he had finally realized a part of that dream. While his main body remained motionless, healing, his spirit-split pulled its lips into a stiff smile and began to study the alchemy texts.
