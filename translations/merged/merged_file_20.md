# Chapter 999: Crossing the River

Milin Prefecture.

Li Suining emerged from his chamber. He waited a moment, then saw a man with ordinary features descend on the wind, flanked by two others. They seemed to be discussing something, and he could faintly catch a few fragments:

"The Pu family has produced a genius. Has the Dharma Protector heard...?"

"Indeed... already in the mountains. I saw him some time ago..."

Li Suining waited quietly by the palace. When the three of them reached the hall entrance, the man in the center glanced at him. His brow furrowed, but he quickly recognized the youth, stopping in his tracks and turning around.

"Suining?"

Li Suining bowed immediately. "This junior greets you, Elder Uncle!"

The man before him was Li Zhoufang, the eldest of the Li family's Zhou generation. He was gradually emerging from the shadow of his uncles' and brothers' deaths and had now become an elder himself. Stroking his beard, he stared at Li Suining, genuinely perplexed.

"Is that really you, Suining? You've truly changed..."

Li Suining's heart tightened.

'This Elder Uncle wasn't highly regarded by the senior-most elders. In his early years, he and Second Uncle Li Zhouyang were busy handling affairs in the shadows. After Li Zhouyang fell, Elder Uncle Li Zhoufang remained a pillar of support for the various disciples. He is extremely popular among the juniors on the island... and behind him, naturally, is the Old Master, Li Xuanxuan.'

'Because of this, Li Zhoufang remembered every single child. He had definitely met me before!'

Now that Li Suining's demeanor was so different, Li Zhoufang was naturally astonished. However, the middle-aged man's heart was filled with affection. He immediately dismissed his two subordinates and laughed.

"You're grown up! Completely different from before!"

Li Suining smiled and said respectfully, "I have reached the fifth level of Embyronic Breathing and came to pay my respects to you immediately, my lord."

"I heard! You've brought honor to the Eastern Residence! The Daoist Master values you; you must not disappoint him!"

Li Zhoufang shooed the two men away and eagerly pulled him into the courtyard. After some cheerful small talk about recent events, he quickly got to the point.

"So, what is it?"

Li Zhoufang had helped many clansmen and always knew that when the younger generation sought him out, they needed something. He didn't mind and asked directly.

Li Suining's eyes reddened. He lowered his voice. "It is about my father... He perished in the Wilderness incident. I have always kept it in my heart, but I do not know the culprit... Before my mother passed, she mentioned that Guest Retainer Ding and the Third Young Master gave him much support. I came today, first, to see you, my lord, and second... to ask about the culprit... I harbor thoughts of revenge."

Li Zhoufang froze. His face flushed, and his eyes immediately grew moist.

His own blood brothers had fallen in the Wilderness. The incident had even sent him into a spiral of depression. How could he not feel sorrow and anger hearing this?!

Li Suining's words had struck his deepest pain. He stood up abruptly and paced back and forth in the room twice, his eyes closed and brows furrowed. He sighed.

"Good child!"

Those two words made Li Suining lower his head, a pang of guilt stirring within him for using the man's grief.

Truthfully, the turmoil in the Wilderness was almost insignificant among the Li family's greater vendettas. The senior elders barely paid it any mind. Even for Li Suining, who had lost his father... first, it was impossible to find the specific culprit amidst the chaos, and second, he had never even met his father and had more important, urgent matters to attend to. He wasn't obsessed with it...

But for Li Zhoufang, whose brothers and nephews had all died in the recent conflicts, it was a raw, bloody hatred!

Seeing that he was the only one in the entire Li family who seemed to care, this Elder Uncle surely felt bitter, even if he never spoke of it. Hearing Li Suining's words now, he was deeply moved.

He turned his head, his voice heavy.

"My cultivation isn't high, but thankfully I've earned some merit over the years and co-managed the Wilderness with Guest Retainer Ding. I will absolutely summon him for you! I will help you get answers!"

Li Suining's heart eased. He knew the matter was settled.

He had sought out Li Zhoufang for two reasons. First, this uncle would definitely help him. Second, and more importantly, was Li Zhoufang's status.

'It's not that I couldn't see Ding Weizeng. But given my cultivation level and the people I have access to, even if I could, it would nine times out of ten be by going to the Wilderness front lines to request an audience. That would have the completely opposite meaning. I wouldn't be able to save anyone and would end up trapping myself instead.'

'But Elder Uncle, despite his low cultivation, is the eldest son of the direct line of the Yuandu generation and the eldest son of the Zhou generation. He also presides over the Wilderness's political affairs. Both his position and his status give him the standing to summon Guest Retainer Ding!'

'Even if Li Zhoufang really could drop everything and fly to the Wilderness front, I had a way to convince him otherwise. After all, many from the direct lineage perished in the Wilderness. Li Zhoufang is only at the Qi Refining level; the riverbank is not a safe place.'

Now that the matter was arranged, he offered a sincere thanks. Li Zhoufang just waved his hand, dismissed an attendant, and whispered:

"Guest Retainer Ding is an upright man. This matter has a whiff of currying favor, so we can't say I'm summoning him just for you. Remember: I have official business to discuss with him, and your matter just happens to coincide..."

Li Zhoufang had managed affairs by the lake for many years; he naturally knew how to handle things. Li Suining wasn't slow-witted either and nodded in understanding. But then the middle-aged man sighed.

"Times by the lake are probably difficult. They don't know how to live properly. Don't hold it against them, and get along well with Suikuan..."

"Yes!"

Li Suining had expected him to say something like this.

'This was the difference between Li Zhoufang and Li Xuanxuan. No matter how worthless his descendants or brothers were, Li Zhoufang always had a soft spot, thinking, _"He is my kinsman, after all."_ But the Old Master would truly curse and beat them. For the same offense in my past life, when the Old Master got the full story, he didn't just try to smooth things over by telling me "don't hold it against them."'

'But Li Zhoufang had always been this way. He had been taught by Li Chengjiao to be utterly selfless. No matter how soft-hearted he was, he was still far better than that beast who defected to the Buddhists!'

At this thought, Li Suining's breathing quickened, a trembling anger rising from deep within him.

'Li Chengpan...'

He was extremely wary. Buddhist cultivators had a keen karmic sense. Even though the other party's cultivation should be low right now, he quickly suppressed the thought. He waited anxiously, his mind inevitably wandering.

'It's almost noon... This shouldn't be...'

With the experience of his past life, Li Suining knew that countless mighty figures were watching Moongaze Lake like tigers. He didn't dare act out of line or speak his thoughts aloud. He could only do his best within his capabilities. He felt agitated, distractedly acknowledging his uncle's words, when he suddenly heard a sound.

"Om!"

A flash of crimson-gold light descended from the sky, and a man materialized inside the pavilion.

The man had a noble, martial appearance, with eyes as sharp as blades. He unconsciously radiated a killing aura, a blatant, deadly prestige. He wore a dazzling red armor, and two short clubs were fastened at his waist, faintly pulsing with artifact light.

Merely by standing there without a word, he projected the fierce, imposing bearing of a great general. He glanced down, his voice gruff and low.

"Young Master, you were looking for me?"

Li Zhoufang smiled. "Indeed! Apologies for troubling you to make this trip, Guest Retainer!"

'This is the Palace-Yang Tiger!'

Li Suining's heart pounded, a mix of joy and shock. He desperately suppressed his overflowing delight.

'I really... I really made it in time!'

He had never met Ding Weizeng in his past life. After all, Ding Weizeng had been burned to death by the Merging Fire while Li Suining was still in Embyronic Breathing. He had only heard that the family once had this Palace-Yang Tiger... a highly capable subordinate of the Daoist Master, and his loss was a great regret.

Now, seeing him with his own eyes, he was filled with boundless elation.

'He truly is a fierce general... and I really saved him!'

His euphoria was indescribable. His passionate desire to change his past life had always been shadowed by a lingering fear that fate was immutable. Now that it had truly happened, he had confirmed his ability to change the future. It almost felt like a dream.

This boiling, complex joy was impossible for others to understand. Li Suining just kept his head down, feeling the wave of heat from the artifact light washing over him. His heart burned, and a lump formed in his throat.

'Guest Retainer Ding is the first, but he absolutely will not be the last!'

Ding Weizeng, however, turned those blade-like eyes on him, a hint of suspicion in his gaze.

The 'Palace-Yang Tiger' Dao foundation involved striking opponents with one's gaze; it was a Dao Lineage with profound attainments in ocular techniques. The pressure from his stare was immense. Seeing the youth bow his head was no surprise. He asked, "Is this about the families on the east bank?"

Li Zhoufang began to explain the details. Li Suining, however, kept his head lowered, his gaze drifting to the afternoon sun outside the window, counting down the seconds.

'Three... two... one...'

As he finished the mental countdown, his tension peaked. A breeze swept in. Ding Weizeng looked up abruptly, his expression fierce, and stared at the horizon. In that instant, a terrifying wave of Merging Fire erupted from the north, engulfing the world. The entire sky turned a sickly, ashen black!

"Not good!"

The man didn't hesitate for a second. Ignoring Li Zhoufang's shocked and bewildered expression, he stood up, his body flaring with crimson light, and transformed into a streak of light, rocketing into the sky.

'He dodged the initial Merging Fire and the ambush... He's probably just going to take a look. He should be safe...'

Li Suining also stood, forcing himself not to chase after him. His face showed shock, but his eyes held hope as he slowly raised his head.

Over the lake to the west, a blazing Heavenly Light was rising, stirring the rolling, multicolored clouds and rapidly pushing back the sky's ashen-black. A dull, majestic pressure spread rapidly.

'The Daoist Master is making his move!'

...

"Moongaze Lake..."

Karmic fire surged through the sky, swirling like black fog. Numerous golden bodies materialized, casting multicolored light across the heavens.

The horse-headed, dark-eyed Maha stood in the air, its lotus throne gleaming. The golden body looked up toward the nearby lake, and a Buddhist hymn echoed:

"Nu Xiao!"

The nun at his side rose and bowed respectfully. She saw Taixi say placidly:

"Go and test the waters."

'Damn you, why don't you go yourself? You want me to fight the White Qilin?'

The nun rose with a smile, her face a mask of serene peace. Her delicate features shone like porcelain. Though she was cursing him furiously in her heart, she could not defy the order. She cautiously rode the wind forward.

Nu Xiao was truly unlucky. She possessed some karmic affinity and was the Merciful One of the Sparrow Carp Fish, making her a strong contender to be his disciple. Her status was not low. Despite several failures, she had relied on this connection to remain secure.

She had recommended Antelope Trample, thinking to earn some merit. But Antelope Trample had crushed all rivals and won the Sparrow Carp Fish's favor, rendering her own value obsolete. Her previous failures suddenly became glaring. Unsurprisingly, with Taixi short on manpower, she was immediately dispatched.

She wasn't even part of his faction; how could she get a good assignment? It was only because Taixi wasn't her direct superior and didn't control her fate that she dared to curse him internally. But cursing was all she could do... She had no power to resist and flew forward, trembling with fear.

She had just crossed the river when she saw an intricate, bright-white Celestial Gate erect itself from the multicolored clouds, shining down countless beams of Heavenly Light. She was so frightened she immediately recoiled. But then she saw a man in white-gold robes sitting atop the Celestial Gate, and she froze.

It was Li Ximing!

"Hah!"

Her back immediately straightened, her brows relaxed, and she revealed a newfound ease. She smiled.

"So, it was Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

How could she, Nu Xiao, not know Li Ximing's true strength? They had just crossed blows years ago when vying for Bai Yinzi. Li Ximing was indeed skilled at suppressing a Merciful One, and his Radiant Sun King's Halberd was formidable. But she hadn't come alone!

'Moreover... when the Radiant Sun King's Halberd sees the White Qilin, will it even obey him? The White Qilin is tyrannical; it never spits out what it swallows. Would it have left him with the Pure Yang Bracelets?'

It wasn't just Nu Xiao who felt confident. The other Merciful Ones behind her also let out silent sighs of relief. Even Taixi, whose eyes had been clouded with uncertainty, grinned. But the old fox was still cautious.

'Li Ximing is nothing, but the White Qilin is most likely still on the lake. The Lord took his forces to the Wilderness. If the White Qilin hits me with those bracelets and I get injured, it's not worth it... Shilou Yingge used an injury as an excuse to return... but from his report, those Pure Yang Bracelets are still potent.'

Li Ximing just stared at them coldly, a scalding fury boiling inside him.

'Good... attacking the lake without a single word... If I hadn't delayed my departure for the West Curtain Sea, Zhouwei would probably be the only one guarding the lake!'

These few were already trouble, and there were even more powerful auras in the Wilderness. The peace between north and south had been torn apart like paper. The north's first move was a killing gambit, an overwhelming disparity in force. A mix of lingering fear and rage twisted inside him, making his gaze even colder.

He didn't relax in the slightest. The Heavenly Light at his brow flashed, and a perfectly round, crimson-red pearl, like a Golden Core, materialized before his forehead. It was encircled by five golden threads, and fiery birds circled it, emitting a misty, multicolored light.

The Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument!

A torrential wave of Li-Light surged from it. Dazzling and chaotic, the crimson light, trailing intersecting, multicolored rays, instantly drowned the sky, pulling all three Merciful Ones and the one Maha into its domain!

The chaotic Li-Light shot everywhere, shattering all spiritual sense in an instant and pinning Nu Xiao, who had been in the lead. But then, radiance burst forth from within, as if carving out a new Buddhist Land. A solemn Sanskrit voice boomed:

"Vile heretics! A parlor trick!"

Taixi's figure had vanished from the lotus seat. A thick golden light enveloped him, the glorious radiance driving back the chaotic colors, revealing the Maha's golden body. His eyes flashed, having already locked onto Li Ximing's position!

But the Daoist Master in white-gold robes showed no sign of retreat. He stood silently, his eyes slightly closed, hands pressed together at his chest. Three blazing lights flashed into existence beside him.

On his left, an apricot-red Li Fire burned brightly, flowing and surging, containing a balanced and profound qi. On his right, a True Fire—white within, golden without, etched with red and black patterns—blazed, unleashing the profound mysteries of artifact refinement. Both were Purple Mansion spiritual fires.

But what truly made the Maha's pupils widen was the brilliant, blazing light auras they flanked: a near-invisible, pale gray flame, radiating a terrifying, baleful aura!

'That's... the Merging Fire of the Supreme Yang Dao!'

Incomprehension flooded Taixi's eyes. His mind went blank for an instant.

'Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm? A Purple Mansion cultivator with one divine ability... and _three_ Purple Mansion spiritual fires?'

But the raging flames were already reflected in his eyes. The three spiritual fires, as docile as lambs in the man's control, wove together without interfering with one another. At a terrifying speed, they plummeted down, straight for his face!

# Chapter 1000: Karmic Fire

'...'

Taixi knew Li Ximing had consumed many treasures from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. He also knew Li Zhouwei had reaped a fortune in the grotto-heaven. That explained his mild jealousy when the Spiritual Treasure appeared. But three Spiritual Fires? He had never imagined such a thing.

'This is just too extravagant!'

Jealousy and hatred warred in his heart, but seeing the three Spiritual Fires merging so harmoniously, their aura terrifyingly potent, his vigilance spiked. His posturing vanished. He activated his Golden Body, and the overbearing, radiant power of his Buddhist Land divine ability immediately contracted, flowing back into his Dharma Body. He took a single step back, eyes flashing, and summoned a bowl from the Great Void.

The bowl was deep purple, rimmed in metallic black. Its opening was a pitch-dark void, utterly devoid of light, like an endless abyss. This was the infamous Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl!

While Taixi's seniority in the Way of Emptiness wasn't deep, he had spent many years refining this one exceptional treasure. He had begun the process long before joining the Buddhists, and its greatest strength was suppressing and absorbing elements like water and fire.

But just then, the brilliant light of the three merged Spiritual Fires suddenly split. The Li Fire leaped out, detonating prematurely before the Treasured Artifact. It erupted into a storm of raging, apricot-red flames that surged directly into the bowl.

It was the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame.

Among all types of Li Fire, the Red Pheasant is the most sentient. The Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame possesses the power to disrupt and pacify profound energies. This Li Fire took the vanguard, surging forth and coiling around the bowl, managing to pin down the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl for a crucial moment. In that instant, the other two Spiritual Fires crisscrossed and shot past it, speeding toward Taixi!

'This...'

Taixi was already channeling his divine art when he saw this. His face darkened, and he stared, stunned in disbelief.

'‘It... it just split apart? Just like that?’'

Li Ximing's counter to the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl looked effortless, but Taixi himself was a student of fire arts! The principles involved were terrifyingly profound.

'‘To effortlessly merge Spiritual Fires into one, then just as easily split them apart and control them individually with no interference... this is absurd...’'

He had to understand, Li Ximing was simultaneously controlling True Fire, Li Fire, and Merging Fire!

These were three distinct Spiritual Fires, each one more tyrannical and fierce than the last! Harmony between different Spiritual Fires was practically unheard of. A Daoist Master's spiritual sense was finite, limiting the number of Spiritual Artifacts or Spiritual Fires they could control. How could anyone withstand such internal conflict? Even a Daoist Master cultivating the path of Fire Virtue could, at best, handle two or three Spiritual Fires from the same Dao Lineage in actual combat!

Taixi understood this difficulty perfectly. When he was refining the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl, he had no Spiritual Fire. He had to spend five full years blending True Conjoined Triple Fire within the bowl just to produce a single wisp of flame. It was so pathetic that, despite his thick skin, he had been too embarrassed to give it a name, simply calling it 'karmic fire.'

'‘Li Ximing isn't even a Fire Virtue cultivator! At best, his Li Fire has some affinity with Bright Yang. Three Purple Mansion Realm-level flames from different Dao Lineages, merging and splitting at will... how is that possible? Even Gao Fu could hardly do better!’'

But now, his Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl—which was meant to counter fire arts—was itself being countered. He had no choice but to shoot blinding, resplendent light from his eyes. A stream of white light instantly leaped forward to meet it. It was Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

Li Ximing's Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was not on par with Li Zhouwei's, but he had still practiced it for decades. It formed a solid barrier against the resplendent light. In that same instant, the flickering Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire leaped out once more, a flash of bright golden-red that shattered the golden light emanating from the lotus seat beneath him.

Taixi pressed his palms together, urgently recalling his dharma artifact. But there was no response from the Great Void.

'‘What?’'

Li Ximing's gaze was glacial. The five layers of golden silk around the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument in his hand had vanished. Far in the distance, within the roaming Li-Light, the Profound Snare activated, locking tightly onto the Treasured Artifact. Taixi instantly lost contact with the treasure lamp he had kept hidden for protection!

The Maha's expression changed drastically as a searing white light filled his vision.

"Boom!"

A white light so bright it was agonizing—the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire—slammed down, exploding against Taixi's arm. A formless, pale-grey flame shot skyward, driving back the Li-Light, incinerating the iridescent clouds, and forcing all other light to recede.

"Rooar..."

The intense white light faded, revealing the Maha roaring in agony. The arm he had raised to block had turned a searing, incandescent white. The Merging Fire blazed, melting his golden skin to reveal a cross-section of flesh that looked like jade and polished glaze.

His Golden Body was splattered with innumerable sparks of the Merging Fire. These bright motes of flame danced like stars, clinging to him like a tenacious plague. They pulsed, spreading rings of grey fire that swirled around the bright contact points, and these points were steadily growing brighter!

Taixi was caught completely off guard and had suffered a grievous blow. The pain was excruciating. His gaze was a vortex of infinite hatred and terror, yet his lips twisted in a jealous sneer as he hissed:

'‘Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire!’'

The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire was renowned among all Merging Fires. It was said to burn the life-mandate itself and reveal ultimate radiance. It possessed the aspect of "feeding on power" and the ability to smelt even metal. This wasn't just talk. Once it landed on a body, it would spawn this pale-grey 'Flame-Following Merging Fire'!

If this 'Flame-Following Merging Fire' was left unchecked, it would feed on the victim's dharma power and divine abilities. Once nourished, it would allow the root flames of the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire to spread further. It was an utterly vicious cycle. The fire should have been easy to recognize, but he had never dreamed Li Ximing would possess such a treasure!

'‘The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire... how could it be the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire? That's something Li Ximing couldn't afford even if he sold himself!’'

The other two Spiritual Fires were gone; this was the power of the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire alone, yet it had still burned him severely. His pupils dilated from the agonizing pain until the glazed, jewel-like irises consumed his entire eyes. The lotus seat beneath his feet shot backward as waves of resplendent light surged up his body, desperately trying to suppress the injuries before the flames spread further.

'‘I’m here doing the Way of Great Desire's dirty work, and they just sit back and watch me get wounded... Outrageous!’'

The ponderous, furious intent in his heart spread outward, infusing his resplendent light. This wave of anger washed over the three Merciful Ones, who were intentionally holding back within the Li-Light. A chill shot through them, and they cursed their luck.

Nu Xiao, having no backing, felt it most bitterly and seethed:

'‘We’re being blocked by the Li-Light; it’s perfectly normal to take some time! It’s not like we’re slacking off... Li Ximing’s divine ability is Audience with the Celestial Gate. If he really has reinforcements, whoever charges in first will die fastest. Having an excuse to delay is the smart play! ...Who the hell could have predicted that you, a third-life Maha, would get wounded in just a few exchanges?!’'

Cursing inwardly, the three Merciful Ones, drenched in cold sweat, finally burst out of the Li-Light. Led by Nu Xiao, the strongest among them, they launched several beams of resplendent light. But the death throes of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition all those years ago had not been in vain. Taixi’s retinue of Merciful Ones had been decimated. The three remaining today were mediocre at best. Forget attaining the Golden Lotus Seat; even Nu Xiao, the strongest, was only at the Developing Wisdom level.

Li Ximing's figure drifted up within the Li-Light. His Audience with the Celestial Gate, held in reserve until now, was waiting for this exact moment. He unleashed it without hesitation, suppressing Nu Xiao. The Spiritual Treasure floating between his brows flared, and the immense drain of power made his face go white.

Swarm of Light!

The Spiritual Treasure’s power to suppress different Dao paths activated. The other two Merciful Ones, who had split wide to avoid being caught by a single divine ability, froze in mid-air. Li Ximing's fourth divine art, Double Radiance, flared. A red light swept out, resonating with the Li-Light. In coordination with the Swarm of Light, it locked both of them in place.

'‘A Spiritual Treasure is a Spiritual Treasure, after all!’'

The two Merciful Ones were completely pinned, their hearts seizing.

Behind them, Taixi finally breathed a sigh of relief. He momentarily stabilized his Dharma Body, the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl hovering over him to absorb and suppress the rampant spiritual flames. With a vicious grunt, he finally tore an object free from the Li-Light.

It was the treasure lamp, which had been completely immobilized by the Profound Snare!

This treasure lamp, which he had only just acquired, had been pinned in the Li-Light by a single divine art for more than ten exchanges. If he hadn't personally freed it, Taixi suspected it might have remained trapped for the entire battle. The power of his opponent's Spiritual Treasure was one thing, but this lamp's performance left Taixi so disappointed he almost laughed in fury. Silently, he blew on the wick, and the lamp flared, casting its resplendent light.

This resplendent light, at least, was mystical and shockingly fast. Li Ximing was already overextended, channeling multiple divine arts to lock down several opponents. His dharma power and divine abilities were strained to the limit. The lamp's sudden pull nearly caused the spell arts in his hands to dissipate. He was a beat too slow. The Sun's Resonant Parting Light flaring around him failed to block the beam, and his defenses were instantly extinguished!

'‘A mistake...’'

Li Ximing felt his chest tighten as searing, fiery light bored into his heart. Fortunately, his reflexes were sharp. The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron instantly appeared at his side. A rolling, blue-green light poured from it like water, absorbing the beams of resplendent light.

He coughed twice. His gaze dropped, and with the aid of the Immortal Artifact, he perceived another Golden Body still watching from the Great Void. He wasn't surprised in the slightest. Sneering inwardly, he gathered his focus. Under the protection of the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, he closed his eyes, and all the radiance from his body converged. The golden-red True Fire flashed beside him, then shot into his Sea of Qi.

Taixi had just formed another Dharma Art of resplendent light, but the Merging Fire coursing through him caused it to falter. Before he could recover, the wide-area Swarm of Light finally reached him. It descended along with a ripple of mountain-and-river patterns, striking his hands and shattering the Dharma Art completely.

He had no time for anger; a sudden, intense feeling of danger spiked in his heart. A talisman had appeared in mid-air. It was covered in complex, glowing sigils, its brilliant colors coalescing into a profound light that poured down!

The Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman!

Li Ximing was floating above the lake. His Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman had long since linked with Moongaze Lake. Thanks to the power of the Yue State's greatest lake, its might was nothing to scoff at. Because the connection was long-established, it activated instantly, striking Taixi across the distance. It exploded in a shower of shattered light, anchoring him to the physical world and preventing his escape.

'‘He has another killing move!’'

Taixi was a veteran; how could he not see his opponent's intent? But the treasured ring he had spent years refining had been lost at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter while binding Li Zhouwei, only to be interrupted and lost due to Suiguan's sudden arrival. This new lamp was a poor substitute, and now it was even being suppressed by the enemy's Profound Cauldron. All he could do was glare, his divine abilities trembling, and roar in fury:

'‘Nuzi!’'

Li Ximing’s eyes snapped open again. His hands, which had been forming seals in front of him, pushed forward, revealing an object.

It was no larger than a thumb—a single point of iridescent gold, densely covered in runes. It spun and danced with fluid agility. The dim, heavy red light of its past was gone, replaced by a bright, soaring radiance.

Great Parting's Golden Radiance!

In the past five years, Li Ximing had cultivated diligently, condensing this spell art. He had already achieved the ninth strand of Red Radiance. Now, by recalling the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, he had added the final, most difficult strand. Ten strands converged, transforming into the Golden Radiance!

The iridescent gold light blazed, and the Great Void resonated. The six-armed, four-legged Golden Body finally appeared. Maha Nuzi descended amid a swell of celestial music. A golden bell shield manifested, blocking the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman for Taixi. Another of his hands projected a beam of light to defend as his majestic voice boomed:

"Benefactor... lay down your butcher's knife!"

But the instant his divine light descended, a purple-gold radiance erupted from the dim Li-Light. Thirty-two beams of spiritual light, long lying in wait, merged into one. They formed a massive pillar of light that slammed down onto Maha Nuzi.

The Buddhists had advanced deep over the lake, placing themselves squarely within the range of the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array!

Nuzi froze, his face bathed in purple light. His expression changed.

'‘Good!’'

Taixi was overjoyed. He didn't care one whit what happened to Nuzi. Seizing the moment the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman was blocked, he turned to flee, leaving the golden Great Parting's Radiance to speed toward Nuzi.

"Dong!"

A manifested Treasured Artifact vibrated and was swatted aside by the radiance. Nuzi had only recently become a Maha; he certainly didn't possess a treasure on par with the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl. He had just neutralized the array's purple light when the golden radiance was already upon him. Alarmed, he could only shift his body halfway and brace for impact.

"Boom..."

Resplendent light shattered and Li Fire dissipated. The light of Audience with the Celestial Gate still flickered, but there was a sharp cracking sound. Nuzi Maha snapped his head up, blood trickling from the nose of his Golden Body as he coughed up fragments of Li Fire.

"Pfft!"

All six arms and four legs of Nuzi Maha's Golden Body erupted with Li Fire, engulfing him in a bright conflagration. He instantly stabilized himself and began fighting the flames, but his burning eyes filled with a mix of ferocity and joy.

'‘The foundation of that Dharma Art is shaking... its power is greatly reduced. His dharma power and divine abilities must be exhausted!’'

'‘He used Taixi's miscalculation to force back the Way of Emptiness... but that was his limit!’'

His mood shifted rapidly from grim to gleeful, and then to sharp malice. But just as a new radiance began to shine from his body, he heard a sound from the Great Void and an explosive roar:

"Tonsured donkey!"

'‘Someone's coming!’'

He was shocked. He no longer dared to speak of "laying down butcher's knives," nor did he dare harbor any malicious thoughts. With visible regret, he shot into the sky, riding a beam of light northward.

A streak of light sped toward them, materializing over the lake to reveal a man in blue-green robes with a sword strapped to his back. He had just arrived. He landed on the lake's surface, coming to a stop beside Li Ximing.

It was Si Yuanli.

The blue-robed man was exceptionally sharp. Seeing the Buddhists retreat, he paused only for a moment. He tossed a scroll from his waist, which instantly manifested countless golden lights. Without even revealing its true form, the scroll’s power gently pressed down on the flickering, collapsing light of Audience with the Celestial Gate. It not only pinned the Merciful Ones beneath it but also allowed Li Ximing to let out a long, ragged sigh of relief.

'‘A pity...’'

Li Ximing's face was still pale. He regretfully caught the returning radiance. The golden light immediately shattered into several strands of red light, which fell back into his hand, their brilliance diminished.

He extinguished the lamp's fire burning on his chest, feeling only a scorching heat in his mouth as his divine abilities dimmed.

'‘At the last moment... my divine abilities and dharma power couldn't sustain the Great Parting's Radiance...’'

In that brief exchange, Li Ximing had simultaneously wielded Spiritual Fires, Spiritual Artifacts, a spirit embryo, and a spirit array. Both the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire were incredibly taxing on his mind, divine abilities, and dharma power, to say nothing of the Great Parting's Radiance.

Even with his Purple Mansion Realm cultivation and his divine abilities recovering at high speed, his aura was still unstable, his chest tight. When that lamplight had struck him, he had nearly blacked out.

'‘This won't do... I must be more meticulous in the future. My use of Spiritual Artifacts was full of errors, and I made too many mistakes in this fight... Quality over quantity, that's the truth...’'

He had no time to dwell on it. He immediately turned to Si Yuanli and asked urgently:

"What is going on?"

This Daoist Master Qinghu's expression was grim. The attack from the north had been sudden. If Li Ximing didn't know the cause, how could he? He could only raise his head, look ominously toward the Karmic Fire in the east, and reply:

"I fear they've come for the Azure Pond!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow, a bit of color finally returning to his face. Watching the Karmic Fire flow in the east, he silently activated the Immortal Mirror. He glimpsed a Heavenly Light speeding through the conflagration. Only then did he relax, just slightly. He cast a cold smile at the still-trembling light of his Audience with the Celestial Gate.

"I doubt it!"

---

In the Wilderness, the sky was a bruised, dark grey. Karmic Fire surged as the clouds roiled. The mountain forests had been burned to black ash, exposing the bare rock beneath. Plumes of black smoke rose from the ground, only to ignite into flames in the air.

The Karmic Fire in the sky gathered, spinning into a vortex that descended. Mixed within it were azure-purple wings and crimson down. On the mountaintop, the fire coalesced into a handsome monk. His eyes were pale red, and a red silk sash was tied at his waist.

He narrowed his eyes, plucking a wisp of spinning grey flame from his sleeve. It was tightly entwined with a ring of intersecting golden light. With a casual flick of his finger, the monk shattered the golden ring.

"Om..."

As the golden light shattered, a violent resonance echoed through the air, like the cracking of a great bell or the splitting of a drumhead. It sent the surrounding Karmic Fire into disarray. Sparrow Carp Fish raised an eyebrow, then leisurely folded his sleeves.

"The Pure Yang Bracelets... they really were something."

A rustling sound came from the Great Void. The horse-faced man—Taixi—stepped out and landed on the mountain. The flames of radiance on his body were suppressed beneath his robes, but they still pulsed faintly. Sparrow Carp Fish turned and regarded him with cold eyes.

That single glance made Taixi's heart pound. He quickly bowed in salute, lowering his head.

"Your Excellency..."

A smile spread across Sparrow Carp Fish's face. "Taixi Dashi," he said, his tone full of amusement. "How did you end up returning in such a sorry state? And where is Nu Xiao?"

He chuckled. "You're truly regressing. It seems sending you to the war in the south was a mistake. All those three lifetimes of cultivation, wasted... You fought a mere Daoist Master with one divine ability and managed to get your own Dharma Body wounded."

Taixi was a Maha of the Way of Emptiness; Sparrow Carp Fish was a Maha of the Way of Great Desire. They were technically peers. But Sparrow Carp Fish had reincarnated six times, while the Maha of his own Way of Emptiness, Liangli, had only been propped up by the other's Dao Lineage. What status could he possibly claim? He replied, his voice a mix of embarrassment and helplessness:

"He possesses three Spiritual Fires and a Li Fire Spiritual Treasure... The items he carries are worth more than my life! He was also backed by that Great Purple Mansion Formation... He's difficult to handle. Besides, he’s the one who escaped from Changxiao all those years ago."

"As for Nu Xiao... she couldn't get away in time. She was trapped under his divine ability..."

Sparrow Carp Fish knew the Way of Emptiness was dirt-poor and that its leader, Liangli, was a miser. He had originally sent Taixi and Nuzi just to run interference, to keep the White Qilin from making trouble. He never expected them to fail so completely. Letting the White Qilin rampage in the Wilderness was bad enough, but they had also lost personnel. Scornfully, he said:

"Changxiao? That Yan fellow was just putting on a show for the mountains and seas! So what if it was him? Is the Upper Rite Dao Lineage known for being skilled in combat?"

"The two or three who came out of the Zhao Palace back then were all famous. You've really opened my eyes, Taixi Dashi."

Taixi seethed, but he was helpless. Buddhist Dao cultivation placed little value on personal ability; it was all about bloodline, background, luck, and position. The Maha of the Way of Emptiness, Liangli, was solely focused on cultivating Xuwang and was secretly wary of him. It was an impossible situation. Unable to air his own grievances, he could only pretend not to hear the sarcasm and sighed.

"It was all because of that Merging Fire! I didn't know he possessed such advanced fire arts."

He loosened his robes, and the flames of radiance immediately flared up. Sparrow Carp Fish's gaze dropped, his interest piqued.

"Oh? Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire?"

Taixi nodded and sighed. "I must trouble Your Excellency!"

This Maha was famously shameless. When he first arrived, he'd had the nerve to call him 'Daoist Friend.' Now that he needed a favor, it was 'Your Excellency.' Sparrow Carp Fish, though a Maha himself, despised such people. He sneered, shook his head, and parted his lips.

In that instant, a sharp beak distorted his features, tearing through his face and pulling flesh with it like molten fire. Flames surged as the bright, sharp beak opened in a silent shriek.

The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire on Taixi's body leaped and danced, then, drawn by the suction, streamed into the beak and vanished. In an instant, it was gone. Sparrow Carp Fish's handsome face returned, his eyes glinting with greed. "Go and stand guard in the north," he said dismissively.

Though some flames still licked at Taixi's body, the worst was gone. He breathed an internal sigh of relief, agreed joyfully, and vanished into the Great Void under the other's dark gaze.

Sparrow Carp Fish retracted his gaze. The great hall behind him had been burned to its foundations, surrounded by surging Karmic Fire. He sat on the master's throne, which was slowly melting, and smiled.

"Daoist Friend Qi!"

A young man stepped out of the Great Void, hands clasped behind his back, looking utterly unbothered.

"Your reincarnation speed is impressive, Daoist Friend."

The young man wore black robes with profound patterns over white, gold-trimmed garments. The woman behind him wore simple, profound-patterned robes of teal. Her features were fair and her temperament exceptional. It was Kong Tingyun.

Her expression was calm. She lowered her gaze, sweeping it over the mountain range below. She recognized it easily. This mountain belonged to her family—or at least, it once had.

The Kong Clan must have moved it here when they took refuge in the Wilderness. It had been left with the Li family ever since and never reclaimed. Even the ruined foundations... they still bore the style of the Profound Peak Gate.

And now, she stood upon it as an enemy.

"Congratulations, Daoist Friend. Your destiny has arrived."

Qi Lanyan smiled, raising an eyebrow. "If the Sea of Desire's Maha Liangli weren't constrained, he surely would have led the charge himself. To think a simple oath from all those years ago would lead to this, allowing you to advance yet again."

Sparrow Carp Fish smiled faintly, unsure if this was a probe. He just gripped the armrest of his throne and asked:

"I must also congratulate Daoist Friend Qi. Just when you need people, the Chengshui Tomb first produces a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert, and now another has broken through. There is even news from overseas... It seems your position is becoming quite stable."

He was naturally speaking of the Chengyun Gate in Jiangbei. But Qi Lanyan took two steps onto the Wu Earth-patterned ground, lowering his head to inspect the designs as he spoke casually:

"That branch... no need to pay them any mind. They aren't one of us, deep down. They caused quite a bit of trouble earlier, displeasing several people. After all, they are used to plotting against others; they rarely find themselves on the receiving end."

"It just forced the master of our Chengyun Gate to use inferior methods to advance prematurely. His path forward is now severed. His hopes in this life are gone. He can only ride this wave and see what arrangements await him in his next life."

Sparrow Carp Fish laughed. "That one is always making radical changes. I doubt he has only one pawn in play."

"Correct." Qi Lanyan narrowed his eyes and said leisurely, "There is also our Senior Tiandong. Aside from Tianyuan, he is the eldest of the 'Tian' generation. He isn't like Tianhuo, who had poor talent and was lucky just to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. And he isn't like Tianwan, who was hopelessly stubborn. He is the hidden piece. Now... where is he?"

Sparrow Carp Fish's expression turned grim, his pupils locking onto Qi Lanyan. "If you could divine that, Daoist Friend, you wouldn't need to come down here to do this sort of work. And the noble Daoist Shanqing wouldn't have been sitting in the golden seat for so long."

Qi Lanyan didn't get angry. He just chuckled, shook his head, and turned, making an inviting gesture.

"Someone has to do it... Please!"




# Chapter 1001: The Cost

The Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array shone in the sky, gathering purple radiance. A Daoist Master in white-gold robes sat atop the Celestial Gate, deep in thought.

Si Yuanli pressed the scroll in his hand onto the gate. He remained silent, yet streams of golden light flowed like water from the seams of the scroll, covering the Celestial Gate and making it even more resplendent.

'The Huai River Map actually holds such divine power.'

These Merciful Ones were always cautious. With the situation having escalated to this point—trapped beneath the Audience with the Celestial Gate—Nu Xiao had still not taken her own life, nor had she uttered a single plea for mercy. This was, of course, due to the divine workings of the Huai River Map.

This golden, divine power flowed out, complementing the Audience with the Celestial Gate. It even sealed the Great Void, locking the entire Audience with the Celestial Gate into a state of stillness and isolating it from the outside world. Only the poor wretch remained suppressed beneath the Audience with the Celestial Gate, unable to escape or die...

'As expected of a Spiritual Treasure inscribed by a True Monarch all those years ago. Though that esteemed one has long since fallen, its power remains mysterious and unfathomable...'

Li Ximing looked up slightly and saw a Heavenly Light from the horizon rapidly approaching. It scattered dozens of people, who were all thrown into the formation in a single breath. The Heavenly Light then coalesced into a figure, which was none other than Li Zhouwei.

When Si Yuanli saw those golden eyes, he felt his own eyes burn. He lowered his gaze and said, "Greetings... Fellow Daoist!"

At that moment, the golden-eyed youth still had gray flames burning fiercely on him, sending up wisps of pale white smoke. Li Ximing took one look, then immediately lifted his head and exclaimed in shock, "Small Peacock Karma?!"

The karma fire on Li Zhouwei's body was precisely the Small Peacock Karma he had seen all those years ago in the Nine Mounds Dao Lineage of the Peacock Sea!

Those four words caused Si Yuanli to waver slightly. He asked in doubt, "The Peacock has come as well...?"

However, this was not the time for idle talk. Li Ximing reached into his sleeve, but Si Yuanli was one step ahead. He plucked a gourd from the Great Void, and a stream of pale gray Valley Water flowed out, landing in his palm. The middle-aged man stroked his beard and said, "The Azure Radiance Pure Essence... is perfect for fire wounds!"

The skirmish Li Zhouwei had on the eastern side was not intense, and his injuries were not severe; they would have only taken a month or two to heal. But since Si Yuanli had produced the spiritual water, he did not stand on ceremony. Using the Azure Radiance Pure Essence to cleanse his fire wounds, he nodded and said, "Thank you, Senior."

"You're too kind... I should be thanking you..."

Although his gains in the grotto-heaven had been swept clean by someone surnamed Chi, Li Zhouwei had, after all, offered his assistance. Si Yuanli felt he owed him a debt of gratitude, but the timing was poor. He only mentioned it briefly, then saw Li Zhouwei say thoughtfully, "Azure-purple Yuse, red pupils, golden beak. It must be a Peacock, then."

The Peacock clan was not unfamiliar to Li Ximing. He frowned and said, "Let's not talk about that for now. There's still a creature beneath the divine ability that needs to be dealt with first."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow in surprise, a look of elation immediately crossing his face. He asked, "You managed to capture a Merciful One?"

"Thanks to Fellow Daoist Si."

Li Ximing gave a cold laugh. He asked Si Yuanli to stand guard above the divine ability and, along with Li Zhouwei, transformed into light and descended, reappearing beneath the Audience with the Celestial Gate.

Here, the radiance was dazzling and a wave of heat washed over them. Fierce purple flames leapt and danced, and a suppressive and erosive power permeated the air. It swirled around the central pillar of light, emitting a grating, grinding sound.

Standing in the very center was an old Buddhist nun. Her glass-like face was covered in cracks from her violent struggle, and her arms showed signs of being shattered. She looked quite horrifying, having clearly struggled for a long time. But with Li Ximing and the Huai River Map suppressing her together, how could she possibly break free?

Seeing the two Daoist Masters appear before her and realizing that no one from the north would bother with her, she immediately bent her body, her face streaming with tears, and bowed, "Greetings, esteemed sirs... this humble cultivator..."

Li Zhouwei acted as if he hadn't heard her. He took a step forward, raised his hand, and seized her throat in a flash of lightning. His other hand smashed against her face with a deafening "CRACK!"

The woman's words came to an abrupt halt. With a sound of breaking glass, dense powder fell away. Her head immediately caved in and was smashed to pieces, leaving only an open and closing mouth. Multicolored glass-like gems rolled across her body, which were instantly incinerated by the flames. Li Zhouwei lifted her up and asked casually, "I ask you, why did the Way of Great Desire march south?"

Nu Xiao's vision went black from the punch, and she nearly passed out. While her eyes were full of stars, she dared not show any dissatisfaction. She trembled and said, "Your Highness... Your Highness... this lowly one is of humble status and only knows... that this division... is meant to attack Simin!"

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes and asked, "What forces are there? And how many people are coming from behind?"

Nu Xiao didn't dare to reassemble her face. She just kept her lips and teeth moving, flashing a fawning smile. "The Way of Emptiness has always been subservient. The most important thing is the Way of Great Desire's involvement. This matter was decided when the esteemed Suiguan exterminated the fiends and purged Jiangbei..."

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei asked, "The millions of people from Jiangbei?"

"How astute, esteemed sir!"

Li Ximing's heart froze. He saw the Merciful One grovel and say, "Esteemed sir... Although those above have not spoken, those of us who cultivate the wicked path can tell... The millions from Jiangbei not only serve to influence Wanling Heaven, but they also represent a major karmic event. Whoever contributed these millions would be the first to ride the wave of the next era's great changes... This is a huge opportunity... and those involved will most likely not be able to escape!"

Many of Li Zhouwei's conjectures seemed to be confirmed. He stared at her with cold eyes and said faintly, "There are also a few instigators of this great destiny, am I wrong?"

Nu Xiao quickly nodded, cowering as she spoke. "That is correct... Both the esteemed Sir Si and Your Highness have taken on a major karmic debt... As has that Daoist Master Ning... Even a few others who were on the sidelines have become entangled to some extent."

Li Ximing's heart was chilled. Li Zhouwei finally stood up and said coldly, "So it is!"

When Wanling Heaven descended all those years ago, the Way of Great Desire provided the personnel, and the Zhao Palace sent a divine ability and the Stargazing Bronze Sparrow. Suiguan could have directly made his move, so why did he have to bring that painting with him?

Li Zhouwei had always thought that Suiguan could not cross the river at will and needed to use him as a cover. But now that a consensus had been reached between north and south, how could the inability to cross the river have been an obstacle? And why bother to deliberately create a cover...? It wasn't just about the two sides needing a mutual understanding to turn a blind eye; there was a deeper purpose at play!

"You, esteemed sir, were one of the sources for the talisman. What was that painting? It was a talisman!"

'A talisman that could unleash Suiguan's divine ability!'

It was the Azure Pond that had forged the karmic ties. This talisman was drawn by Si Yuanli of the Azure Pond, used by Li Zhouwei, and was the very trump card the Azure Pond Sect Master Ning Wan used to order the attack on the Wilderness... This esteemed Sir Pristine Water used the pretext of a single talisman to deceive karma with a divine ability and conceal Suiguan, while all the karmic debt was then divided among everyone else...

'Did this esteemed Sir Pristine Water not want to be stained by karma? It's more than that...'

Li Zhouwei looked up and said in a low voice, "Since all of these cultivators have incurred such major karma, if they want to survive the coming great tide... they can only submit to the Yang Clan and stand against the North. This is essentially selling out the Azure Pond and the Yue State... selling them to the Yang Clan!"

Li Zhouwei was already irreconcilably opposed to the North; this was just one more layer of karma, cutting off his kinsmen's path of retreat. But for Ning Wan, Si Yuanli, and even the Yuyang Chen Clan... once this matter was settled, they would essentially have no way out!

Fleeing overseas? Carrying the karmic debt of crossing the river to kill millions of the Way of Great Desire and hindering the great tide of the North and South, how could a few cultivators—either early-stage Purple Mansion Realm or burdened with family—escape the Liangli of the Way of Great Desire and the venomous hands of the Maha? If they couldn't stand with the Yang Clan, from the Daoist Masters themselves to their many descendants, they would be seen as nothing but prized morsels in the eyes of their enemies... They might be fine for a time, but their lives would eventually be claimed!

The decline of the Li Clan from their former status as an Imperial Clan served as a precedent! Si Yuanli thought he would always have a place in the great tide, but he didn't realize he had already been irrevocably tied to the Yang Clan's chariot!

Li Ximing's face was grim. But when the Merciful One saw their reaction, she was already trembling in fear. Li Zhouwei's tone changed, and he asked coldly, "I ask you... the Seven Dao have been fighting my clan for years. Are there any people they have converted, high-level cultivators who possess the bloodline of the former Imperial Clan, or figures with major karmic ties to the Li Clan?!"

Nu Xiao froze for a moment. How could she not know? She was the very one responsible! Her heart was filled with a sudden surge of dread, and she hesitated for an instant. But then, a torrent of bright flames descended from the heavens and landed on her body.

"Sizzle!"

The pain from the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire swiftly swept through her mind. Her Dharma-body's divine ability was suppressed once more, and the bright flames quickly spread across her form. Nu Xiao's eyes were filled with fear. She cried out in pain, "Esteemed sirs... esteemed sirs... The number of people from the Seven Forms with major karmic ties to the Imperial Clan is countless! How could I possibly list them all! As for a high-level cultivator who possesses the bloodline of the former Imperial Clan... there is one, there is one! Please withdraw your divine ability!"

Li Zhouwei had already let go, causing her to fall into the light with a splash. Feeling her Dharma-body slowly crumble, Nu Xiao no longer cared about anything else. She bowed and said, "There is one in the Great Adoration Dharma Realm! He is called Li Jieyi, with the title 'Vast Cicada'... He is also a highly sought-after and important figure... As for the converted, the one who was converted..."

Li Ximing's expression darkened slightly, and he let the flames die down a bit. The golden-eyed youth, meanwhile, stepped forward, pressed his boot onto her throat, and said quietly, "Continue."

Nu Xiao knew that her end was truly at hand. The ones she hated the most were not the two in front of her, but Taixi, who had abandoned her here, and Antelope Trample, who had taken her position. Her lips trembled with hatred, but at that moment, she spoke with a strange composure. Weeping and laughing at the same time, she said, "There is a person called Antelope Trample... Having attacked and taken the Wilderness with the wicked path, he should have become a Merciful One by now. He is highly valued by the esteemed ones. While others seek to kill the Imperial Clan, he is here to convert the Imperial Clan. This time, he is the one who gained the most benefits, apart from the Esteemed Sir Peacock. And he will only get more in the future."

Li Ximing's pupils dilated. He looked at her in disbelief. Li Zhouwei lowered his head, his golden eyes staring coldly at her. With one hand resting on his knee, he pressed his foot down more firmly. "What is his mortal name, and who converted him?"

As soon as these words were spoken, Nu Xiao knew her end was truly at hand. Her eyes filled with a searing hatred, and she no longer showed any fear. A look of mockery appeared on her face as she thought with hate, 'You won't give me a way out... Fine... fine...'

She even managed a smile. "It was this old woman! As for his mortal name? Listen well, it's Li Chenghao! We hadn't even used our divine abilities, and he willingly submitted to the Buddhists. He devoured another person named Li Chengpan and used his own brother as a weapon!"

As the words left her mouth, she felt a sense of vindictive pleasure. 'The Imperial Clan is arrogant! I'll make you praise the descendant of the one who submitted to the Buddhists and blame that wretch who would rather die than surrender! When you see Antelope Trample, you will be filled with unbearable regret for your irredeemable mistake!'

The shrill, vindictive laughter had yet to escape her throat when the youth's face before her became covered in golden scales and mystical patterns. The cold rage in his eyes was like a deep abyss, a seething blade.

"CRACK!"

In just an instant, her entire upper body was smashed into multicolored light by the brilliant radiance. The bright flames boiled, a white light flickered, and glass-like fragments shattered.

Under the suppression of the Audience with the Celestial Gate and the seal of the Huai River Map, Nu Xiao's body and soul were utterly destroyed and vanished into thin air. The surging Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire consumed her body completely, leaving not a single fragment of glass or a single piece of flower or leaf behind.

"Clink..."

The Lotus Throne had reverted to its original form, a palm-sized pink object that fell onto the light and wobbled slightly. Li Ximing swept his sleeve and collected it, his teeth clenched.

"So there really was something... if you hadn't asked that extra question..."

The patterns on Li Zhouwei's face gradually faded. Without a word, he flew out with his granduncle, and they saw the middle-aged man on the Audience with the Celestial Gate looking chagrined. He had no desire to speak either and simply cupped his hands in a salute toward the two of them.

The Huai River Map isolated the sounds from inside and outside. But as the owner of the Spiritual Treasure, Si Yuanli had heard everything crystal clear. His heart was filled with a chilling mixture of fear and hatred, and his mood was even worse than theirs.

'No wonder... I always felt there was something wrong with that painting... So this was the reason!'

'The Old Ancestor... the Old Ancestor said to preserve ourselves on the mainland... He must have had a premonition!'

The three of them exchanged a glance. Li Ximing silently gestured for them to go up the mountain to talk. Si Yuanli forced a smile, waved his hand in refusal, and said in a low voice, "She mentioned the Esteemed Sir Peacock. The person from the Wilderness is definitely the Sparrow Carp Fish. He's a Peacock."

Li Ximing's mind was preoccupied, but he answered casually, "I've seen one or two before... but none had such great prestige... I've heard that the Peacock is the mount of the Revered One. This one is probably quite noble. What is his strength like?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "We didn't actually fight. We just had a brief standoff with our divine abilities. I only rescued some people from the Merciful Ones... It's a shame for the various clans of the Wilderness. When the karma fire fell, who knows how many people died? And now, there's no telling how to handle the aftermath!"

On the surface, the Wilderness was a land without a master, but with the weakening of the Sacred Writ and the Kong Clan on several occasions, the disappearance of Capital immortals, and the departure of the Xiao Clan, it had actually fallen under the control of Moongaze, governed by Milin. Milin issued cultivation methods, and the Wilderness, in turn, continuously supplied spiritual resources and talents to the lake.

The influence of the Li Clan had spread into the Wilderness long ago. When Li Ximing achieved the Purple Mansion Realm and took Funan, the Wilderness, along with Funan and Guyan, became a buffer zone for the Li Clan. Now, the last of these areas was lost. This was not only a loss of manpower and territory but also represented a shrinking of their maneuvering space.

The bad news came one after another, leaving the two with little enthusiasm. Si Yuanli looked hesitant and spoke, "More than just noble, the Sparrow Carp Fish is also considered a descendant of a Dharma Master-level being. I know of him. He first cultivated the Merging Fire. His cultivation method was special; as soon as he became a Great Daoist Master, he submitted to the Buddhists. By virtue of his bloodline karma, he instantly became a Maha. His cultivation is terrifyingly fast. He is already in his sixth lifetime. Although his power is still not as great as when he was a Great Daoist Master... he is still very fearsome."

"This time, his march south is probably to use the grand scheme of the North and South to overcome the hurdle of his seventh lifetime and regain the power of his previous lives..."

Si Yuanli had connections in the North, so his information was more current. With so much information now at his disposal, he began to make deductions: "Conflicts between the North and South rarely cross the Wilderness to reach Quanwu, let alone go even farther south. I think... his attack on Simin will definitely be a swift and decisive affair that can't afford a single mistake... That's why he isn't provoking your esteemed clan."

While the Li Clan had lost the Wilderness, it was clear that the other side didn't want to get involved in the Bright Yang's affairs and create an unforeseen variable. But Si Yuanli was in a terrible position! Now that he knew about the karma of the Way of Great Desire, and they intended to march to his sect's gates, how could he not break out in a cold sweat?

"He's very likely coming for the Yang Clan... but what if he's not? That esteemed Sir Yang has been in secluded cultivation for many years, and no one knows when he will emerge. The timing is a coincidence... but one must always be prepared. Who knows who will end up on the platter?"

He hesitated again and again, and then a glimmer of hope suddenly rose in his heart. 'The Nine Mounds... yes... the Nine Mounds... they have always been close with the Peacock. Even if I can't meet a Great Daoist Master right now... in a situation like this, those seniors should at least give me some guidance...'

He couldn't sit still any longer. He hastily bade farewell to the two of them, rose on the wind, and disappeared from sight.

Li Ximing watched him leave. Li Zhouwei said in a low voice, "It would be better for him to stay at the lake... Perhaps he has some connections or a trump card!"

The two of them stood in the Great Void for a while. The gray flames in the east were still spreading. Li Ximing sighed inwardly, feeling both hatred and pain.

'How could it be Chenghao?!'

While Li Chenghao was rigid, he was also bold in his words and actions, and fiercely loyal. In the past, to protect Li Chengpan, he had dared to stand against Li Zhouluo, yet when Li Zhouming needed him, he could put aside personal feelings and bow his head. His entire family was a family of martyrs! It could be said that he was one of the most well-known examples of stubborn loyalty among the recent generations... He had mentored many young people and was even an uncle to Li Zhouyang and Li Zhoufang.

He had fallen in the North. Li Zhouwei had even written "Great desire is emptiness; this enmity must be avenged" to Li Zhouyang. The news that he had submitted to the Buddhists was enough to bring shame upon more than half of the Li Clan...

Li Ximing's only consolation was that Li Zhouwei had been cautious, making a vow of revenge instead of bestowing a posthumous title. He tentatively said, "It's a good thing you were so careful..."

Li Zhouwei, however, shook his head. His gaze was icy as he said in a low voice,

"This matter must never be allowed to reach the clan!"

Li Ximing let out a breath and nodded, saying with some bitterness, "Chenghao's entire family was lost for the clan's sake, and he has no descendants... He did adopt a child, but it seems that child will not amount to anything. How can we possibly punish him for this? We'll just have to deal with things as they come."

"But as for Chengpan's descendant... should we offer more protection..."

Li Zhouwei heard these words, but he seemed to have some reservations. He thought for a moment and said, "There's no rush. The more important thing is to keep a close eye on him. There's no telling what kind of destiny scheme the North might have in mind."

The two of them reached a consensus and then descended in silence.

The cultivators at Moongaze Lake were huddled inside the formation, at a loss. A crowd of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators stood in the great hall, whispering to each other. When they saw the two Heavenly Lights appear, the solemn atmosphere immediately eased, and both rows of people knelt down with a rustle.

Li Ximing glanced around, silently counting the number of people. He realized that it was rare for so many of the clan to be gathered together. With the great turmoil at hand, it felt as though the overture had just begun and the great curtain was about to be drawn back, a sense of fate hanging in the air.

The people of the four lineages were arranged on either side. Li Zhouming and Li Minggong stood beside the elder, while Li Zhouda and Li Zhouluo were opposite them. Farther back, Li Jianglong, Jiangxia, and Jiangzong sat opposite each other, taking their seats according to their ranks.

Some were rakish and elegant, others dignified and generous; some were scowling, while others were fiery and boisterous. Each one had a refined appearance and a distinct bearing; there was hardly a common person among them. Li Ximing's worries had not yet subsided, and for a moment he felt a sense of daze.

'In a scene like this all those years ago, great-uncle Xuanfeng would have been seated, and I would have been on the side, awaiting orders. An esteemed one would have granted three truncheons to the clan in preparation for the unexpected. At that time, Zhouwei was still an infant. But today, it is the two of us who are in charge of the clan's affairs.'

He was silent for a moment. No one below dared to speak. Only a man in crimson armor happened to come up from outside the hall. He knelt on the steps and said respectfully, "Greetings to the two Daoist Masters."

In an instant, the cheers shook the heavens. Whether they were dandies or court guards, all bowed respectfully. The elders on the side also stood up and all turned their faces toward him, assuming a posture of respectful listening.

Li Ximing glanced at Li Zhouwei, who was standing beside him. He noticed that his junior had already stepped down one level and turned around, standing toward the seat of honor behind him that faced south from the north. Those golden eyes, which were originally so fierce, were now as calm as still water, quietly watching him.

---

On the Island.

While the great hall high above was respectful and solemn, the pavilions between the profound pillars were noisy and chaotic. A crowd of men and women whispered to each other, full of anxiety and unease. The middle-aged man stood in the pavilion, worried and nervous. "Eastern Residence... has Suikuan from the Eastern Residence arrived?"

Hearing this, Li Suikuan, who was standing nearby, answered. Li Zhoufang took a careful look at him and memorized his appearance. The middle-aged man then immediately went to ask the other children.

'The wind and clouds are clear...'

Li Suining stood by the window, carefully observing the scenery outside. He saw the brilliant Heavenly Light and nothing else out of the ordinary. His expression was calm, yet a sense of doubt rose in his heart. 'In my previous life, there should have been two showers of glass flowers that almost covered the entire great lake. That was when two Merciful Ones were suppressed by King Wei's divine ability and executed by ax and halberd...'

But the situation now was completely different. No matter how he looked, aside from the radiance that had burst forth earlier and a few specks of glass, he could no longer see the brilliant spectacle from his previous life.

'There was no glass flower rain... Perhaps the Buddhist cultivators' losses this time weren't as tragic as in my previous life.'

As he was thinking this, always feeling that it wasn't a good thing, he saw a person descend from the air in a hurry, their face full of joy. The person bowed on the steps and reported to Li Zhoufang, "Esteemed sir... esteemed sir... The two Daoist Masters have appeared in the hall!"

This one shout caused the pavilions to fall silent. From Li Zhoufang, who was in charge of the affairs there, to the white-armored guards standing outside the pavilions, they all let out a collective sigh of relief. The oppressive atmosphere suddenly disappeared. Li Suining's heart shook. 'So it was Daoist Master Zhaojing who guarded the lake this time!'

Li Zhoufang exhaled, a smile appearing on his face, but he still raised his eyebrows with a solemn expression and asked, "What are the casualties?"

The man bowed and said respectfully with a hint of dejection, "Reporting, esteemed sir. The esteemed sirs stationed on the shore and those responsible for patrolling the banks and capturing demonic cultivators were all killed by the karma fire... There were seven Qi Refining and twenty-one Embryonic Breathing cultivators stationed there, and six Qi Refining cultivators on patrol... Dharma Protector An Xuanxin didn't lead a team out, but the karma fire landed directly on the garrison... and he too perished..."

Li Zhoufang let out a heavy sigh. He motioned for the man to leave and didn't speak for a time. Li Suining, meanwhile, turned his head, his expression complex.

Clearly, although An Xuanxin had not gone out due to Ding Weizeng's departure, the karma fire that fell from the North was targeted. Even staying on the mountain peaks by the shore would not have saved his life.

'Having the Guest Retainer Ding leave was already doing my best. If both of them had escaped because of me, it would definitely arouse suspicion. My death would be one thing, but if the Daoist Master and King Wei were exposed to the eyes of the mighty cultivators, they cannot deviate from their fate without great consequence.'

'King Wei said that the ones who truly anticipate attaining the Bright Yang Fruition are not from Mount Luoxia... but my Li Clan... The change in the Bright Yang Fruition is an eventuality for Mount Luoxia, but for my clan, it is our only opportunity—whether we use this matter to seek refuge with a faction or to achieve Bright Yang, this is the only thing my clan has going for it.'

'The current situation is unclear. I don't know what kind of reaction altering all this would bring. If I don't speak to the two Daoist Masters, at worst, I will die when the time comes. But if two Daoist Masters who can influence the entire situation were to know... whether they believe me or not... it would be irreversible. The chain reaction would very likely be noticed by the esteemed ones, who would immediately crush the variable in its cradle and cause Moongaze Lake to be wiped out prematurely! In the future, when the event occurs, King Wei might not even get a chance to vie for Bright Yang!'

And so, Li Suining resolutely chose the former between Ding Weizeng and An Xuanxin. Even though he had made similar choices a few times in his previous life, his heart remained chillingly rational. 'No one owes anyone anything. I am only striving for a single sliver of a chance at survival. Anyone can be the price, even me.'

# Chapter 1002: Divine Sequence

A solemn stillness filled the great hall. Li Ximing listened silently to the report from below. At his side, Ding Weizeng spoke, his voice low and heavy with grief.

"Daoist Master," he began, "for the past two years, Xuanxin has been by my side, guarding the riverbank. He fought back the demonic cultivators and hunted down subversive Buddhist cultivators. His contributions were immense...

"Today, I received an order from Young Master Zhoufang to report to the Milin. I left him waiting alone on the mountain... I never imagined he would be struck by the karmic fire."

Below the dais, Li Jiangxia kept his gaze lowered. A young man in white robes, adorned with jade, stepped out from behind him. He was handsome, but his face was slick with tears. He fell to his knees beside Ding Weizeng and spoke through his sobs, his voice respectful.

"My younger brother died serving Moongaze Lake. He has honored the trust of our fathers!"

The An family's bloodline was known to be exceptional. This was An Xuantong, An Xuanxin's older brother, who had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm at nearly the same time. He had served Li Jiangxia for many years and was the Third Young Master's most capable aide.

As for the Third Young Master himself, normally known for his hearty and forthright demeanor, his face was now dark, his eyes filled with sorrow.

Li Jiangxia had managed the Wilderness for many years. The karmic fire had burned it all to cinders, and his losses were catastrophic. Whether it was the trusted aides he had personally promoted or the network of support built by his mother's family, everything was wiped out in a single stroke.

His only stroke of luck was this: Li Jiangxia had worried his second brother would reassign his core followers while he was in seclusion. So, apart from An Xuanxin, who was with Ding Weizeng, his other key subordinates like An Xuantong and Wan Qi had already returned to the mountain to enter seclusion. They had been spared from the Wilderness disaster. If not for that, Li Jiangxia would truly have no one left to command.

By the same token, the loss for Li Jiangxia's maternal clan, the An family, was even more devastating. It wasn't just the death of their new generational talent, An Xuanxin. Forty percent of the An family's entire network of retainers and allies had been stationed in the Wilderness. Now, they were nothing but ash. If An Siwei hadn't taken a large group to the Eastern Sea, the situation would be even more calamitous.

An Xuantong's heart felt like it was bleeding. He remained kneeling, his head bowed to the floor.

While Li Ximing didn't often concern himself with the clan's internal appointments, the political undercurrents here were obvious. If Li Jiangxia and the An family hadn't held such significant power in the Wilderness, his own confidant, Ding Weizeng, wouldn't have been stationed there. Nor would Li Zhouwei have arranged for Li Jiangliang to train under Cui Jueyin, who oversaw Milin. The Daoist Master knew exactly which faction had been hit the hardest. He sighed softly.

"You may rise."

The two men quickly rose. Li Ximing surveyed the hall.

"This fire in the east will not burn for long. For now, wait patiently. No one is to leave..."

He closed his eyes for a moment in thought.

"Weizeng... you said it was Zhoufang who summoned you to Milin? Where is Zhoufang?"

At his side, Li Minggong stepped forward and said respectfully: "When the turmoil began, Hall Guards were dispatched to secure the peaks and retrieve the cultivators from the various islands. He is currently taking inventory of the direct-line disciples from each branch. I will fetch him."

"That won't be necessary."

Li Ximing, however, recalled something. Years ago, during another disaster in the Wilderness, the brothers Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang had been stationed there. They should have been caught in the slaughter, but Li Zhoufang had a last-minute mishap that delayed his departure, allowing him to escape...

'That child has some real fortune about him... If not for him, Weizeng would most likely be dead as well.'

He pushed the thought aside, filing it away in his mind, and said softly:

"Although the great formation over the lake is now active and its purple light protects us, we cannot lower our guard. Everyone is to remain on the island. Send more scouts out to gather information."

"Yes."

Li Jianglong stepped forward and answered respectfully. Li Ximing then turned his head to Li Jiangzong.

"Jiangzong, you may take your medicine and enter seclusion. Great turmoil is coming. If you do not break through now, you may not find such a favorable spiritual environment again."

"Yes!"

After Li Jiangzong affirmed, Li Ximing's gaze shifted to Li Zhouda. He was surprised to find the young man's cultivation was solid, his Thunder Pool dense, and he possessed a notable presence. Li Ximing nodded in approval.

"The same applies to you. Once you are past the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, stabilize your cultivation for two years, then come find me on the mountain."

Li Zhouda had been unremarkable in his youth; no one had expected him to possess such prowess. Li Ximing was pleasantly surprised. Reaching the Purple Mansion Realm was clearly unrealistic for him, but there was no need to be frugal. A single Talisman Pill could elevate Li Zhouda to the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm, adding another capable fighter to their ranks.

He settled the affairs for each of them, bestowing dharma artifacts and medicinal pills as needed, and then dismissed the assembly. Only Li Xuanxuan remained. At last, Li Zhouwei spoke.

"Demon King Qingyan from the West Sea sent word, inviting you to visit, Grand-uncle. Given the current situation..."

Li Ximing simply shook his head. "I was already hesitant. Now, it is impossible to leave."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "While you were away in the Eastern Sea, Grand-uncle, Daoist Master Zhong Qian of Chengshui Marsh broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm."

"Zhong Qian..."

Li Ximing's brows shot up, but he quickly shook his head with a trace of regret. He watched as Li Zhouwei turned to Li Xuanxuan and offered, after a moment's hesitation:

"Our family has a deep connection with him, but Chengyun has sided with the North. The future is... difficult to say. Back then, Azure Pond ordered our ancestor to use him to enter the grotto-heaven, yet he ended up helping our ancestor inside the Great Ning Palace. I remember our elder mentioned this to me... Perhaps he didn't know he was being used when he was at the Foundation Establishment Realm. But now that he's at the Purple Mansion Realm and allied against the South, he must be aware of the truth."

"Now that we stand on opposing sides, I fear our past relationship is meaningless. We may even face each other in battle. I have already repaid the favor we owed him with a gift of spiritual resources, clearing the debt. This way... if we must fight, there will be nothing outstanding between us."

Li Xuanxuan could only nod and sigh. Li Ximing looked at him, but decided against mentioning the matter of the "conversion," saying only:

"I went to the Eastern Sea, but I only managed to retrieve a single [Neck Feather]. Firstly, [Wall-Sinking Water] was exceptionally scarce. Secondly, the Eastern Sea itself is in turmoil. That Daoist Master Miao of Thunder-Hearing Island is in open conflict with the Southern Songzhou Luoshe, and chaos has broken out in several other areas. Many of the major markets have closed."

He shook his head, lamenting, "It is truly an age of great chaos. I asked Senior Liu about Daoist Traditions related to formations, and I swallowed my pride to request an inheritance in the Dao of Formations from him. Fortunately, Senior Liu is as generous as ever and did not disappoint. He immediately brought out what I asked for."

"According to him, one of the foremost is the 'Vault-Beam Silver' path from his 'Vault Metal' tradition. While the art is profound, it's unsuitable for cultivation—even if one wished to, the necessary qi no longer exists. However, he did have a copy of the precious [Sacred Scroll of the Star Court], which belongs to the 'Dwelling in the Southern Balance' path of the Heaven–Governing Dao."

"As for the other Daoist Traditions that aid in formations, there are two more from the Heaven–Governing: 'Celestial-Awakening Ear' and 'Divine Sequence.' There is also 'Attaining Brightness' from the Upper Rite tradition, and the Wandering Metal path, though its lineage is now severed. And of course, one of the Wu Earth paths... but those are far beyond our reach."

Li Ximing set down his cup. His divine ability rippled faintly as he gave an order.

"Have Suining come up."

The attendant outside the hall hurried away. Li Xuanxuan's expression turned serious.

"Minghuang! I've asked around! This child's ability to comprehend formations just by reading is in no way inferior to your own talent in the Dao of Alchemy back in the day. He is an exceptionally rare genius!"

Li Zhouwei looked thoughtful, but Li Ximing just laughed.

"We are all family here, Grand-uncle, no need to spare my 'face.' Do I have the talent to create pills just by reading a book? He achieved this while struggling by the lake. Even Ning Wan was only his equal back in her day. If not for this, I would never have made a special trip to the Eastern Sea just for him!"

Before long, someone arrived. He paid his respects outside the great hall, his voice trembling with barely contained excitement:

"Junior Suining pays his respects to the two Daoist Masters!"

"Enter."

Li Ximing inclined his head slightly.

The young man pushed open the door and entered. He glimpsed the Heavenly Light from beyond, but dared not raise his head. He walked to the foot of the dais and kowtowed again, pressing his forehead to the cool floor. Only when he was close did he hear an old man's kind voice.

"Rise."

Li Suining felt a light touch on his arm. The old man had risen and was helping him up. Li Suining finally raised his eyes and saw the elder before him, dressed in ink-blue robes. His hair was gray, but his eyes were sharp and full of spirit as he smiled down at him.

In his past life, Li Suining hadn't met him many times. But at every meeting, the old man had always helped him up, and he would feel the weight of pills and resources slipped into his sleeve. Later, Li Xuanxuan's health had failed, and he rarely made public appearances. Suining had only heard that he returned to Lijing the day before he passed. Li Suining had been away and never saw him a final time.

"A fine child, truly rare!"

"Mm."

That sound was gentle yet profound. It came from Li Ximing on the dais, and Li Suining immediately turned his head.

Radiance rippled through the hall. Blinding Heavenly Light spilled from behind the main throne, silhouetting the Daoist Master who sat there, dressed in white and gold. A brilliant light shone from his brow, making him appear like a god.

Standing beside him was a tall young man in opulent black and gold robes, turned partially away. His powerful, steady hands held a teapot, pouring a stream of clear tea into a cup with a soft, trickling sound.

Li Suining hadn't seen him in so many years. His heart trembled, and he was so overcome with emotion he wanted to weep. He quickly lowered his gaze.

'King Wei!'

The young man before him was the White Qilin Among Men, the warlord who had carved a bloody path from Jiangbei to the lands of Dai. He was the only King-Marquis in the world who could force the great powers of both North and South to retreat, a man truly worthy of being an emperor...

But all those titles were not what moved Li Suining so deeply. The Li family of that era had grown accustomed to it; accustomed to this King Wei suppressing the North and South, forcing the Zhi Xuan, Feng Wu, and Zheng Huai clans to bow their heads. They were accustomed to his invincibility... until the day the news reached Moongaze Lake that the Second Manifestation had appeared over the Wei capital, and the Supreme Yang had lost its light. On that day, the spirit of the entire Li family broke. A terror unlike any before seized them. Even the clan factions, who had been arguing red-faced with each other, were utterly lost, weeping and clinging to one another in despair that night...

How could Li Suining, who had lived through those three sunless days, not be shaken? He prostrated on the floor, a new fear rising in his heart.

'Can I really hide anything from him?'

Drip.

The tea filled the cup seventy percent. The young man set down the pot. His golden eyes turned, flashing with faint surprise. He took a single step forward, his gaze landing on Suining, but he did not speak.

Li Ximing had met Suining earliest and was more familiar with him. He nodded with a smile, retrieving a stone box from his sleeve. With a wave, the box opened, revealing three jade slips. He placed them gently on the table, his expression turning serious.

"I went to the Eastern Sea and procured three cultivation arts for the family."

"The first is the Art of the Star Court, obtained from Daoist Master Yuanbian. It leads to the 'Profound Dipper's Balance' achievement, known in ancient times as 'Dwelling in the Southern Balance.' It allows one to calculate positions, arrange forces, and shift spiritual energies. It is said to be immensely beneficial for controlling formation flags."

Hearing this, Li Suining knew his previous guess had been correct. It was all clear now.

'The Art of the Golden Tablet was sent from the Eastern Sea! In this life, because the Daoist Master went personally, they avoided the dangers of my past life and definitely retrieved the complete [Sacred Scroll of the Star Court]. The Art of the Star Court must be the Qi Refining portion of that scroll!'

He breathed a sigh of relief, but a new surge of joy and doubt immediately followed.

'Three arts? That's one more than in my past life?'

The Daoist Master before him continued calmly:

"This second art, also from Daoist Master Yuanbian, is called the Great Void Revolution Art. It leads to the 'Divine Sequence.' It allows one to calculate profound orders, shift the tides of worldly affairs, and even serves as a divine office."

'...Calculate profound orders, shift the tides of worldly affairs, and serve as a divine office...'

Those words made Li Suining freeze. An impulse rose from deep within him, making his skin crawl and his heart pound.

"Finally... there is the 'Attaining Brightness' path from the Upper Rite tradition. The art is decent, and the Spiritual Qi it requires is easy to gather, but it would take a year or two... It can alter terrain and spiritual veins to form arrays. And then there is the Art of the Watchful Awakening Star, an ancient art already in the clan's vault. It allows one to perceive the words of others, but unfortunately, its grade is not high."

Li Ximing looked at him with a smile, as if asking for his choice, but also as if posing the question to the old man and Li Zhouwei.

"You must choose carefully!"

Li Zhouwei's gaze swept over the slips, his thoughts clear.

'Since Grand-uncle brought them out, he must have consulted the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. There must be follow-up Dao Lineages for these arts available for trade. Otherwise, he would never let this child cultivate a mere third-grade art...'

The three of them pondered, but Li Suining, kneeling below, had heard Li Ximing's words clearly. He analyzed them, his mind racing at full speed.

'In my past life, time was short. Just delivering the art was enough. It was sufficient for the next generation; it wasn't meant for me...'

'But now, the Daoist Master went himself, so he brought back two extra arts. These two... perhaps they are even more helpful to the Dao of Formations, or perhaps they are better suited for Moongaze Lake's current situation. But it most likely means that even Daoist Master Yuanbian doesn't have the follow-up paths for them...'

But for him, Li Suining, did the follow-up path even matter? He knew his own cultivation speed. Although he had wasted a lot of time in his past life, by the day he was forced to flee to the Southern Borderlands, he was still only at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. Even if he truly had the chance to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm in this life, amidst all this turmoil... could he really enter seclusion with a clear conscience?

Even if he succeeded, it would help the situation, but it would still be insignificant. Where would he rank in the wider world? But if he failed, the entire clan would inevitably slide back into the abyss of his past life!

He didn't hesitate. He instantly gave up on the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court—which was actually a fifth-grade art with a higher potential future—and raised his head, his eyes burning with conviction.

"Daoist Master, we are in an age of upheaval! This junior wishes to cultivate the Great Void Revolution Art. With a greater ability to calculate and predict, I can better contribute to the clan!"

Li Ximing smiled and glanced at the young man beside him. Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod.

"Good."

Li Ximing said warmly, "Have your grand-uncle take you into the inner formation to prepare for seclusion."

"Yes!"

Li Suining's eyes were slightly red. He gave a deep bow to all three figures and respectfully retreated from the hall. Not until his shadow had vanished down the profound steps did the old man speak in praise.

"Remarkable!"

Li Ximing chuckled and stood up. He took a jet-black jade slip from his sleeve and handed it to Li Xuanxuan.

"This is Senior Liu's [Sutra of Profound Iteration]. It is the culmination of his life's work in the Dao of Formations—unfathomably profound and extremely precious. I'll entrust it to you, Grand-uncle. Give it to the child when he emerges from seclusion."

The complete inheritance from a Purple Mansion Realm formation master was priceless. Li Xuanxuan hurriedly stood to receive it, tucking it away with extreme care. Li Zhouwei, meanwhile, casually stepped down from the dais.

"[Sacred Scroll of the Star Court]... We'll hold onto it, then."

The young man and his grand-uncle shared a look of perfect understanding. He heard Li Ximing's voice transmit via divine ability:

'The scroll in the vault that resonates with the Great Void Revolution Art is called the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence. Go and exchange it for him.'

(End of Chapter)




# Chapter 1003: Harmony and Accord

'The Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence...'

The radiance of the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance interlaced as pure qi swirled within the High Firmament Pavilion. Li Zhouwei stood inside, arms crossed, meticulously reading the cultivation manual as his mind began to race.

He had seen quite a few "Sacred Scrolls" in the Li family's possession. The Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity, the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court, and even the Manual of the Daoist Profound Succession that Liu Changdie had mentioned in passing—they were all of the same category.

Most of them recorded a vast number of spell arts and esoteric techniques. Having read so many, Li Zhouwei sensed a familiar thread connecting them. This was especially true for the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence and the Art of the Star Court. Their format was identical; they clearly originated from the same source.

Now that he thought about it, even the Sacred Scroll of the Qilin's Radiant Sun bore a faint resemblance. He fell silent for a long moment, his heart pounding.

'There's something more here... These scrolls seem to originate from a single Daoist Tradition. Even the most distinct one, the Sacred Scroll of the Qilin's Radiant Sun, shares commonalities. At the very least, they must be branches of the same ancient Daoist Tradition, one that has fractured and changed over the millennia. They are what the major sects would call a single "Dao-path"... They all carry the flavor of having evolved from a common root.'

In the current era, the order of the Prefectures had collapsed, making it impossible to trace the origins of many things. But in antiquity, these systems had strict names. For example, Changhuai and Cultivation Transcendence both emerged from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Although they didn't call themselves Supreme Yang, if one were to be precise, they could be considered part of the same Dao-path.

These "Sacred Scrolls" were quite different from the "Classics" the Li family had obtained in the past. They clearly belonged to another system entirely. The only exception was the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity. Despite being a Sacred Scroll, its many spell arts lacked that strong, shared lineage.

'The Heaven–Governing is explicitly from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition... Sacred Scrolls... Heaven-Governing... sacrifice... it's also a divine office...'

'Daoist Master Xiang Chun said that in ancient times, there were Immortal Lords, Divine Monarchs, Imperial Monarchs, and True Monarchs... They all shared that "Divine" character. The collapse of worship and the divine offices today... it's the same pattern.'

He raised an eyebrow slightly.

'In that case... the Ancient Wei State, the source of the Sacred Scroll of the Qilin's Radiant Sun, must have had deep ties to the Encompassing Profoundity as well...'

Li Zhouwei reined in his thoughts and took a quick look. His Immortal Merits had increased from 329 to 364. Li Ximing's battle had added thirty-five.

'In the Grotto-Heaven, I fought the Merciful One and severely wounded Helian Wujiang, who cultivated demonic arts, and only earned thirty-one points. But killing Nu Xiao gave me thirty-five. Their strengths aren't even comparable. It seems killing Buddhist cultivators is more lucrative... the reward in Immortal Merits is higher.'

'Next time, even if I can't secure a kill, I must destroy their Dharma body. Simply suppressing them in a fight yields far too few Immortal Merits...'

He examined the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence. It was complete up to the sixth rank, containing a rich and comprehensive inheritance. It cost 189 merits. If he exchanged for it, he would have 175 remaining.

'I have so many spell arts already. Grand-Uncle hasn't even mastered the dozen or so he possesses. And he's busy with his own cultivation. I won't need this for at least thirty or forty years... and what I have left will be more than enough.'

When he had exchanged for the Emperor Qi's Light, he had been stingy, deliberating endlessly. Now, he didn't hesitate at all. He casually made the exchange and strode out of the pavilion.

He walked right into Li Ximing, who was holding out a pill.

The pill swirled with black and gold, its colors vibrant, stirring up waves of spiritual qi. However, the perfect balance of Yin and Yang within the Grotto-Heaven suppressed these fluctuations, preventing them from spreading. Li Ximing spoke with a serious expression,

"Now that your wounds are healed and the situation outside is unstable, this is the perfect time to use the Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill for your cultivation. This pill can open a Profound Palace within your body, allowing you to cultivate slowly. Its medicinal power won't dissipate easily, which is ideal for a situation where you might be interrupted to fight at any moment."

"After you've finished using it, the residual power can even be used to fill a divine ability. It's also suitable for bestowing upon the younger generation to protect themselves!"

...

Simin Prefecture.

Simin Prefecture was the foundation of the Azure Pond Sect. It was densely populated and home to numerous clans. For hundreds of years, while the Yue State had seen more chaos than peace, Simin, as the Azure Pond's base, had remained stable and free of turmoil. As far as the eye could see, roofs interconnected and pavilions rose in tiers.

In the main hall on the heights, a man in bright white feathered robes was looking down in contemplation. He was carefully examining an official's robe draped over the desk.

"The decorative borders... let's stick with the five-colored true jade pattern. The main body of the robe will use the four-convergence Ruyi Scepter cloud pattern... As for the emblem..."

He frowned slightly,

"What does the Great Zhao use?"

The minor officials before him quickly looked up and replied in low voices,

"They use the Kui beast, with a foundation of wood and stone patterns..."

Li Jiangliang's gaze shifted to the side, landing on a smiling woman. He saw Yang Tianyou raise an eyebrow.

"Use intertwined serpents, water-and-fire, and the great python."

The subordinates on both sides immediately agreed, saying respectfully,

"We will have it illustrated at once and present it to you, my lords, for your approval."

Li Jiangliang nodded slightly. The group departed, carrying the robes as if they were priceless treasures. Yang Tianyou turned and gazed out the window, commenting idly,

"Simin is prosperous, after all."

Even though the chaos of the past few years had been rampant, and a terrible battle had been fought right outside Simin, the prefecture itself had remained relatively peaceful. Li Jiangliang stepped forward, still finding it hard to believe,

"The Azure Pond Sect... just handed over Simin like that?"

When Yang Zhuo had led Li Jiangliang and the others to Simin's gates, the Azure Pond Sect was already in internal chaos. Only Qin Xian's faction had been there to defend the prefecture. That man, Qin, had sensed what was coming, but he had no choice but to ride the wind and mount a defense.

Qin Xian came from a humble background. He was an opportunist who had clawed his way to his current position. Despite his mediocre dao lineage, he had enjoyed many benefits. Even the peak lords of the Azure Pond might not have been able to defeat him easily.

But before Yang Zhuo, he didn't last a single exchange. The "Nine-Bend Pacifier Trident" hadn't even fallen before six types of water and fire descended on him in sequence. Qin Xian was annihilated, body and soul, before he could even make a sound. The only Sect Master in the Azure Pond Sect's history to rise from common origins had died violently in front of everyone.

The remaining forces dissolved into chaos. Led by Qin Xian's son, Qin Lianfu, the cultivators were about to flee when a direct descendant of the Si family under Yang Zhuo's command stepped forward and shouted. No matter how much Qin's faction disbelieved it, they bowed their heads and surrendered. Rewards were immediately distributed.

And so, Simin Prefecture, which the Azure Pond Sect had cultivated for six hundred years, fell in less than an hour. The forces on both sides "joyfully welcomed the king's army." The various cultivators, led by the Deng family, knelt and wept. The Deng Family Head cried his heart out, counting on his fingers as he listed every grievance, detailing how the Azure Pond Sect had persecuted the Dengs for centuries and which of his relatives had been murdered.

Li Jiangliang found it rather difficult to watch. He knew the Deng family's background. If they truly harbored such hatred, they wouldn't have remained "quiet as chickens" during the Chi family's rebellion. They were just seizing an opportunity for profit.

But Yang Zhuo needed him. He granted the Dengs three towns and, according to future arrangements, a founding martial peerage, "Attendant of the Primal Hall," a minor, sixth-rank title.

"Qin Lianfu, Si Xunlong, Zheng Shuyan, Li Quantao, Quan Yuduan... all of them received fiefdoms. Once the state is founded, they will all be ranked among the martial peerage. How many more noble clans will this create..."

Li Jiangliang sighed softly. The woman turned back to him, her voice gentle.

"Is that not a good thing?"

"It's not that it's bad... The Yue State has suffered too many disasters. There are vast tracts of barren land and scores of displaced people. Without local clans, we don't have enough people to defend these territories... But... but this is too much. And there's no need to grant them land."

Li Jiangliang looked hesitant. He lowered his voice.

"I understand that His Lordship wants to avoid excessive bloodshed, but for the entire Azure Pond Sect, only the arch-villain Qin Xian died... In a single day, seventy-one fiefs were granted in Simin. This prefecture alone will, by decree, have seventy-one great and small noble families after the founding..."

"I just feel it's wrong. I fear... the harm it will cause..."

Yang Tianyou lowered her gaze, concealing the emotion in her eyes, and cut him off.

"Brother has his considerations."

"It is not yet time for us to raise the great banner. The Azure Pond Sect's rule is effectively over, it's true. If we were to completely topple this behemoth, we could indeed seize all of the Yue State's territory. But what about the territories in the Eastern Sea and the Southern Sea? As long as that banner isn't officially raised, those territories will be carved up by the other great families, who will simply pretend not to notice."

"This is also why Brother stopped at the foot of Azure Pond Mountain. If he hadn't, this affair might have cost the life of a divine ability cultivator! We need this behemoth to hang on, to use benefits as bait. Only then can we rope in the entire Azure Pond Sect. The Si family is on our side now... Azure Pond Mountain still has the Immortal Order to communicate with the two seas, which is the only way to barely maintain control over those overseas territories. After all... even the mountain itself is now under our control. Brother had Si Tongyi establish the 'Bureau of Immortal Rites' to maintain the Azure Pond's registers, keeping a tight grip on these people and lands."

"A few days ago, there was turmoil on the Azure Pond Sect's islands in the Eastern Sea. If not for the Si family's Daoist Master Qinghu and the Azure Pond's own Daoist Master Ning taking action, those islands would have been divided up amidst this drastic change. It would be much harder to extend our reach overseas in the future."

She sighed.

"We are not of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Whatever overseas territories we can legitimately inherit, we must take. We have almost no way to expand further. By the same token, once a territory is lost, it is nearly impossible to reclaim."

But this didn't seem to be the answer Li Jiangliang was looking for. It wasn't that he didn't understand this reasoning. He just hesitated,

"My concern is for the common people. If we truly let noble clans spread across the mainland, what chance will commoners ever have to rise? Besides, if these people are being rewarded so handsomely, what about the Immortal Clans?"

"Do they have a chance to rise today? What about Qin Xian?" Yang Tianyou's expression was calm as she smiled.

"As for the Immortal Clans... they will be enfeoffed as Kings!"

Li Jiangliang was silent for a moment, then asked,

"Have the titles been decided?"

Yang Tianyou looked intrigued and covered her mouth with a smile.

"It's still early... But does your family's title even need to be discussed?"

A tremor went through Li Jiangliang's heart. He actually felt a sliver of comfort. He muttered to himself,

'His Lordship said the position of King brings great benefits. Besides, being known as a King-Marquis will give my family status when they go out. I suppose this is one way I can contribute to the clan.'

Although, given Yang Zhuo's attitude toward the noble clans, his family would likely have received a King-Marquis title even without his involvement. But he had the merit of aiding the new sovereign; at least he could secure more territory for his family. After pondering this, he changed the subject, his tone worried.

"I heard the karmic fire has crossed the Wilderness and already reached Lixia. His Lordship has been in seclusion for a long time. Is there any news?"

At the mention of the karmic fire, Yang Tianyou showed no worry, only a faint smile.

"That is the Sparrow Carp Fish. You don't need to worry about him. He is here to be reincarnated. When the Sparrow Carp Fish reaches the gates of Simin Prefecture, you will naturally be able to see Brother."

Li Jiangliang seemed lost in thought. He was about to speak when a person rushed up the steps, bowing.

"My Lord! A secret letter from Lord Chen!"

Li Jiangliang was interrupted. He turned, took the letter, and scanned it. His expression turned slightly strange.

"Linhai is experiencing a celestial phenomenon. A wind of shamanic curses and owl feathers, the air filled with ghostly wails and spectral shrieks..."

He looked at Yang Tianyou.

"Does this mean success or failure?"

When it came to matters of divine ability, the Yang family—or rather, the Underworld—naturally understood them best. Yang Tianyou nodded, her expression serious.

"The old Sword Immortal poured everything into training them. How many people from the Lingu family have been sacrificed already? First Lingu Yi and Lingu Dan, then Lingu Rao. How many spiritual items? How many precious pills? They finally produced one Lingu Lanying, and they even had to beg our family for help. Which other family has such resources? Only the Lingu family! Of course it was a success!"

"Others may not know... but we know perfectly well. Besides Lingu Lanying, there are two others in seclusion, acting as backups, though their chances of breaking through are slim. They've practically sacrificed all of the Lingu family's geniuses... Sword Immortal Lou Xing was truly ruthless!"

Li Jiangliang sighed in admiration, then shook his head.

"You're wrong to say that. This is a matter of profound righteousness, not ruthlessness. If the Lingu family hadn't been so useless, one of their Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would have entered the stage long ago."

"It's not too late now," Yang Tianyou remarked.

Li Jiangliang nodded.

"It has been difficult for the senior, given his sincere intentions. Now that Lingu Lanying has emerged, Linhai Prefecture is saved. Even if the Great Xiukui Monastery seals its mountain, the Lingu family can protect the mortal Lin Clan and their many branches... It also allows the Great Xiukui Monastery to stay out of the conflict... A brilliant move, truly."

Yang Tianyou lamented,

"Brilliant, yes. But also supremely merciless. To protect the integrity of the Great Xiukui Monastery, he refused to speak a single word of truth to Houfu or Kui Qi. He was willing to let Qin Ling block Xueyang with her life, all for a sliver of a chance. It just shows how unyielding his sword-heart truly is..."

Li Jiangliang could only sigh again in respect. He then saw his wife smile.

"In any case, your family has benefited greatly. Your uncle's peerage has already been discussed in the hall. Several people are deliberating, but it will be at least a third-rank title, enfeoffed in Lixia. As for yours..."

The "uncle" she spoke of was naturally Li Zhouluo. The Li family had not been deeply involved in this turmoil; the only ones to receive titles were Li Jiangliang and Li Zhouluo.

Li Jiangliang shook his head.

"You don't need to think about me. A nominal title is enough. I have no desire for a fiefdom."

A smile appeared on his face, his eyes filled with longing and hope.

"When His Lordship's work is complete, when Jiangnan is stable, and the people have homes and sustenance, I will resign from my worldly duties. I'll take you back to the lake, find a small pavilion on the island, and spend my days proofreading Daoist scriptures and organizing traditions. In my leisure time, I'll just steer a boat on the lake, warm some wine, and sleep."

Yang Tianyou turned her head away, unable to meet his gaze. She forced a smile.

"A man of your talent... hand-picked by Brother as a gentleman capable of governing the state. How could you be satisfied with just a small pavilion?"

Li Jiangliang chuckled, his eyes still fixed on the scroll in his hand. He shook his head and sighed.

"You don't understand. My elder brothers are the real talents. A mediocre person like me... even on the island, I'd only be fit to manage a small pavilion."

His voice was gentle, his brow relaxed in a smile.

"When the time comes, I'll show you the lake scenery from Moongaze."

Yang Tianyou answered with a low hum, still not daring to look at him.

The smile that always graced the face of this proud daughter of the Yang family, this scion of a Golden Core bloodline, faded. She feigned composure, staring out the window, but the slender hand resting on the sill tightened, then relaxed. She closed her beautiful eyes, pressing her lips together as a sudden, sharp pain bloomed in her heart.

'Oh, you...'




# Chapter 1004: Mountain of Desire

Dawn broke, suffusing the world with brilliant radiance.

The splendor of the Supreme Yang touched the lakeshore. Bright lanterns lined a long avenue, and a wide, sea-patterned staircase descended to its end. Cultivators came and went, while carriages and swift horses traversed the road.

"Clop, clop, clop..."

The sound of hooves drew near, revealing a young man on horseback. He wore white robes, his cuffs embroidered with the rippling pattern of a crescent moon on a lake. His attire was not opulent, but his bearing was noble. A silk pouch hung from his waist. He reined in his horse, stopping before a massive gate.

This gate, known as Changxi Gate, was the entrance to Milin Prefecture. It stood twelve _zhang_ high, its seventy-two ridges gleaming with radiance, and it was covered in intricate carvings.

The Milin Mountains were the most renowned immortal mountains in the entire Moongaze Lake region. A market town lay at their feet. Though small and suffering from years of turmoil, the Changxi Gate, as the market's portal, connected the north and south and was of critical importance.

Li Suining reined in his horse. Just then, a caravan was passing under the gate. Upon seeing him, they immediately halted. An old man with the distinct features of the Eastern Yue people climbed down from a carriage. The rest of the caravan moved aside as he bowed respectfully.

"Greetings, Lord!"

The Eastern Yue had never held high status in the Yue State, and the lake region was no exception. Although this old man was a Qi Refining cultivator, which certainly meant he held a high position among his people, he still dared not block the path upon seeing Li Suining's robes. Unsure if the young man's surname was Li, he avoided calling him 'Young Master' and settled on 'Lord'.

A century of assimilation had left them little different from the other folk of the lake, save for being slightly hairier and having typical features. Li Suining simply asked, "Which Guest Retainer do you serve?"

The man was advanced in years, yet he knelt, planting his pale hands on the ground. He smiled deferentially.

"I wouldn't dare claim such a title, Lord! This lowly one is merely a guard, serving under the Jade Court. I am of the Eastern Yue people. I was fortunate enough to serve under the banner of the Grand Concord of Radiance and later followed the orders of Lord Minggong. My humble name is Du Dou."

Li Suining was taken aback for a moment. "Ah, so you served under my grand-uncle. You are being far too polite. Please, rise."

Li Suining actually had a decent impression of the Eastern Yue. Even now, many Eastern Yue practiced shamanistic traditions, and the one they worshipped was the Grand Concord of Radiance—who was, in fact, his own family's King Wei.

This wasn't hard to understand. First, when King Wei was young, his destiny was not yet concealed. His actions as the White Qilin overshadowed his personal identity, and his conquest of the Eastern Yue had seared the intense radiance of the Bright Yang into their memory. Second, it was a way for the Eastern Yue nobles to boast and elevate their own status.

But there were two sides to every coin. After Tingzhou fell, this group of Eastern Yue continued their worship in secret, refusing to change despite repeated warnings. The other surrendered clans couldn't cover for them forever. Eventually, the Shu General Ni Zan tore down their illicit temples and erected a skull mound from their remains.

"Guard, when you go up the mountain, please pass a message to my Eldest Grand-Uncle. Tell him Li Suining has finished his family visit and is waiting at the foot of the mountain to return to the lake with him!"

At this, the old man looked up, slightly stunned. He studied Li Suining closely for a second, then nodded respectfully, accepted the task, and departed.

'That spirit medicine the clan gave me worked wonders... To think I broke through to the sixth level of Embyronic Breathing in just half a month...'

Li Suining was now at the peak of the Embyronic Breathing realm. This cultivation speed was far faster than he had anticipated, and his mood soared.

'At this rate, by the time the Yang Clan establishes their state... my cultivation will be at the second or third level of Qi Refining. At the very least, I'll be able to fly, hold my own against minor cultivators, and construct some basic formations.'

He waited at the foot of the mountain for a short while before a streak of light shot toward him. It was Li Zhoufang!

The middle-aged man stroked his beard with a smile. Behind him followed a boy in simple robes, his head bowed. The old Eastern Yue man trailed at the very back. The three of them landed before the Changxi Gate, walked the nine paces to pass through it, and only then did Li Zhoufang laugh.

"Suining, you certainly got here quickly!"

'Li Chengzai sees I'm doing well now, so he forces a smile for me. I can't be bothered to humor him... Of course I came quickly! If I'd stayed to exchange even a few more pleasantries, he would have started asking to borrow cultivation resources!'

Li Suining sighed inwardly, merely smiling without a word. Li Zhoufang understood immediately and changed the subject, gesturing to the boy behind him. His face lit up with a pleased and surprised expression.

"Come! Meet this young man... This is the Pu Clan's genius, named Pu Xinya."

He then said with a serious expression, "The Pu Clan has a respectable heritage. I met with their family and inquired carefully. Pu Xinya is a rare talent, the likes of which they haven't seen in generations. This is truly a blessing for Moongaze, another stroke of good fortune!"

He then turned back to the boy, smiling. "Pu Xinya, this is Suining, our family's own once-in-a-century genius of the Dao of Formations. You should seek his guidance often!"

The boy bowed and said quickly, "Greetings, Young Master!"

Li Suining suppressed a smile and nodded. "No need for such formalities."

Pu Xinya had been his closest friend in his previous life; he knew him well. While his talent in the Dao of Formations was outstanding, his talent for cultivation was even more frightening. His cultivation speed had once kept pace with his own, and Li Suining had only managed to pull ahead after switching to a superior cultivation method. At this moment, that talent just hadn't yet been revealed.

Having spent so much time with him in his past life, Li Suining understood that Pu Xinya possessed both arrogance and ambition. He also carried that peculiar mindset of the lesser clans around the lake: envying the main family while simultaneously craving independence.

Later, this attitude had been discovered by the Old Lord. He was sent to Simin to manage a shop for two years. After seeing how the world truly worked, he returned much more subdued, understanding that beyond Moongaze Lake, the Pu Clan was nothing but a snack for the wolves. There was no other path than to climb higher within the Moongaze Lake hierarchy.

Right now, however, he was still full of pride. Li Suining didn't say much to him, turning instead to Li Zhoufang with a frown.

"Grand-Uncle, what is the situation with the Buddhist cultivators?"

"Hah! Who knows what that Way of Great Desire is plotting!"

At the mention of the Buddhist cultivators, Li Zhoufang's smile vanished, replaced by a grave expression.

"That Maha came through the Wilderness and arrived in Lixia Prefecture some days ago. There was no great slaughter, he didn't even enter the prefectural city. He just dispersed his Merciful Ones into the hills to establish their own temples. They preach their doctrines, sending followers down to spread their teachings. The common people are being swayed. They're all watching from the city, and many have already secretly changed into the robes of Buddhist cultivators..."

He sighed heavily.

"Worse, they've raised twelve great mountains outside the prefecture and planted what they call the 'Great Virtue Golden Lotus'. A hundred silver streams flow down from these mountains. When the common folk leave the city, they remove their shoes, roll up their trousers, and wade into the water. They instantly experience all kinds of bliss, forgetting their parents and siblings. We sent more than ten of our people to investigate. Five never returned."

"Jiangzong has given up on it. They're just pushing nearby rogue cultivators to scout from a distance. Word is, the mountains outside Lixia Prefecture have already transformed into 'Mountains of Desire.' Men and women lie together, naked, indulging in debauchery all night, completely lost to it..."

"Those few families there, the Wu and Lu clans... they've met with utter disaster. It's almost a blessing they were conquered before; many of their younger generation were conscripted by the Yang Clan, so at least some of their bloodline will survive."

The middle-aged man sighed. "Now... we hear the Way of Great Desire has passed this area and is heading south. We don't know what will happen next."

Li Suining sighed as he listened. In his past life, he had been in secluded cultivation and held a low status, so he hadn't known much about this incident as it happened. But he knew plenty about its aftermath. He silently confirmed the details in his mind.

'The Way of Great Desire... I heard they split from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm in ancient times. Although they also preach a Buddhist Land in the mortal world, their methods are vastly different. They proclaim: "A world without suffering _is_ the Buddhist Land." They don't require their followers to endure hardship to enter it; one must simply enjoy pleasure from birth until reincarnation. That 'Great Virtue Golden Lotus' absorbs all grief and pain. Down there, there is truly not a single trace of suffering...'

'What's even more absurd is that among the Seven Dao, the Way of Great Desire's population burns out the fastest, yet they are also the most fertile. Since all pain is taken away by the 'Great Virtue Golden Lotus', giving birth to a child is seen as bringing another soul into the world to enjoy bliss. It's an act of great merit. Everyone scrambles to do it, to the point they all wish they were women.'

But no matter how ridiculous it all was, he knew in his heart that once the Way of Great Desire left, this populace would become an unholy mess of debts that could never be settled.

'This disaster ravaged the entire northern Yue State. If the Song Emperor had tried to uproot the 'Great Virtue Golden Lotus', millions of people would have had their lifespans drastically cut, none living more than ten years. No wonder he had to seal the mountains and ban the rites, first cutting off the thing's influence, then issuing new Classics and spending years to slowly, meticulously untangle the hearts of the people.'

He thought it over carefully, calculating in his mind. 'By the time I came out of seclusion in my past life, this turmoil was more or less over. The family didn't suffer any major losses, so this matter shouldn't affect us. My priority is to see the Old Master.'

He stood within Li Zhoufang's transporting wind, and they quickly descended onto the island. But he saw the older man shake his head and smile.

"Let's not talk about that. You're running all over the island, how can you not have someone to run errands? What's more, you have to study the Dao of Formations, making your time even more precious. I have someone here—you've just met him, in fact. Let him serve you and handle your trivial tasks."

"The family has rules, of course. An attendant's cultivation usually can't be higher than the direct descendant's. But you're about to enter Qi Refining anyway, so it's not too soon!"

Seeing Du Dou prostrate himself on the ground and begin to kowtow in alarm, Li Suining frowned and was about to refuse, but then he heard Li Zhoufang's voice transmission:

'Just accept him. This was arranged by Aunt Minggong. Uncle Chengzai has no sense of propriety, and that crowd at the Eastern Residence is even more shameless. Du Dou has the Old Master's orders; he can block them for you. Otherwise, you'd have to refuse every one of them personally, which would damage your relationships with relatives.'

'She is very busy and couldn't wait for you, so she entrusted this matter to me.'

Li Suining's expression was complicated. He hadn't risen this quickly in his past life, so the benefits weren't as great, and Li Chengzai hadn't been able to bring himself to beg. Things were clearly different now. He had no choice but to cup his fists.

"Thank you, Grand-Uncle!"

With Du Dou leading the way, Li Zhoufang didn't need to escort him any further. Li Suining proceeded to a pavilion higher up the mountain. His gaze swept casually over the pavilion's rooms, but then his pupils contracted slightly.

A man in grey robes was hurrying up the steps. He reached the pavilion, knocked on a door with some trepidation, and only then stepped inside.

'Fourth Grand-Uncle...'

This man was precisely his Fourth Grand-Uncle, Li Zhouluo!

Li Suining's heart clenched.

'Was Fourth Grand-Uncle on the lake in my past life?'

This Fourth Grand-Uncle, Li Zhouluo, was no ordinary figure. He had been heavily favored by the Song Emperor. From the day the emperor ascended the throne, he was made Governor of the Capital. As the Li family declined, his position only grew higher. After King Wei died, Li Zhouluo, as King Wei's brother, was not ennobled, but he was at one point appointed Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, constantly attending His Majesty's side. His honor and favor were immense.

If this same Fourth Grand-Uncle Li Zhouluo hadn't repeatedly pleaded for mercy on the Li family's behalf, Li Suining wouldn't know what to feel facing him now. But even so, his emotions were incredibly complex.

'Perhaps... after Uncle Jiangchun died, this grand-uncle had no grandson left under his line. And since he was already the Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, attending the emperor, he was elevated to such a high position...'

Li Zhouluo's branch of the family played an extremely strange role in the grand scheme of things. Their elder, Li Xizhi of the "Four Xis," had made a move during the Changhe Rebellion. His Rainbow Glow technique had shocked the north and south, but he had vanished immediately after the great battle, never to be seen again.

And Li Zhouluo's father, Li Chenghuai, was someone he had only ever heard of but never met! Li Suining had never even considered this elder back then. The entire family had simply gotten used to the fact that he was wandering abroad and was never seen. Thinking back on it now, it was all too bizarre.

But it was undeniable that this Fourth Grand-Uncle had benefited greatly from King Wei and his own grandfather. When he was appointed Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, the imperial edict had contained, after all, this very sentence,

"His father and brother served with utmost sincerity, purging evil to bring peace to the prefectures."

'This Fourth Grand-Uncle... he must have a clue...'

His gaze darkened. He was roused from his thoughts by the courtyard guard in front of him, who blocked his path.

"The Old Master is currently meeting with someone. Please wait a moment, Young Master."

...

Inside the pavilion, the lamplight was dim. The old man, Li Xuanxuan, set down the scroll in his hand. He peered at the grey-robed man kneeling in the hall, seeming to recognize him with a start. He quickly raised his brows and descended from his seat to help him up.

Li Zhouluo was both flattered and uneasy. He allowed the old man to pull him to a seat at the side. Li Xuanxuan did not return to the main seat, but sat down close beside him. He grasped his hand and asked, "How are things now?"

When Li Zhouluo had returned to the lake all those years ago, he had been accompanying Li Jiangchun. Later, when the Azure Pond issued its summons, he had escorted Pang Yunqing back to Simin. Rushing back to the lake now was clearly a risk. He lowered his head, looking somewhat lost.

"I don't know what the situation is. The Azure Pond suddenly collapsed. Yunqing was assigned to a position in the mountains. I was worried about the clan, so I came back to check."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head, his voice aged. "Your grandfather left for Mount Duan fifteen or sixteen years ago. We had news for the first few years, but the letters became fewer. His last reply, five years ago, said he was entering seclusion to verify his Dao Lineage. We've had no news since... Has your grandmother written to you? Is there any word of your father?"

Li Zhouluo was at a loss for words. He left his seat and bowed. "She... she has sent a few letters. They just told me to cultivate diligently. And... grandmother's family offered me cultivation resources, but I declined them all. A few relatives from her side have sought me out occasionally, but only to offer some guidance on cultivation..."

Li Xuanxuan nodded. Li Zhouluo continued respectfully, "However, I received news from the south. That... Lord Yang... has granted me one or two territories. The location is excellent, in Simin..."

"This junior was thinking, it would be perfect to give to the family as a foothold. We could open a small market there, and it would count as extending our reach further south."

Li Xuanxuan drew his gaze back from him, took a sip of tea, and replied, "That's not right of you. Lord Yang bestowed that upon _you_. How can you just push it onto the clan? Besides Jiangliang, who serves directly under Lord Yang, no one else in the family has received such an honor. You must cherish it."

Li Zhouluo didn't know how to respond. Li Xuanxuan leaned in and asked in a low voice, "Is there any news from the south? How are we to deal with this surging karmic fire?"

Li Zhouluo immediately rose from the floor, his expression grave. "That Sparrow Carp Fish is about to reach Simin. No matter what, one of the great lords _must_ be making a move! The rumors in Simin are flying. In this junior's opinion, the Sparrow Carp Fish won't be rampant for much longer!"

"The family just needs to be careful. The moment the Sparrow Carp Fish retreats from Simin, we must seize the opportunity to reclaim our territory."

"Oh?"

The old man raised an eyebrow, studied him for a moment, and then smiled. "Is that what the Yang Clan intends?"

# Chapter 1005: Righteous Nature

The old man asked the question but did not look at him. He simply picked up the other cup of tea that had already been poured on the desk and gestured for Li Zhouluo to take it. 

"Sit and talk."

Li Zhouluo had been at a loss for words, and this gave him a welcome moment to breathe and think. He took the opportunity to rise, accept the tea, and sit down again beside the old man.

"I don't know either..." he sighed. "I went to Simin, and a great personage came to see me. He told me to call him... to call him Grand-uncle... His name is Yang Ruiyi."

Li Xuanxuan's expression tightened slightly. He calculated inwardly:

'Yang Ruiyi... Rui-generation... That would make him a brother-generation to Yang Xiao'er.'

His expression cleared into one of understanding. He nodded with a smile and asked, "What level of high-level cultivator is he? How have I never met him?"

Li Zhouluo looked hesitant. "This junior can't be certain... His profound quality has a hint of Father's 'Untraceable Presence'. He just stands there, without the slightest aura, like a mortal..."

Li Xuanxuan sighed internally as he listened to him continue.

"He told me a few things and pointed out the situation in the north to me... The territory in the Wilderness. If our family still wants it, we should occupy it as soon as possible. After all, Profound Peak is watching from the side..."

"If our family doesn't occupy it, someone else will come to guard it."

Li Xuanxuan set down his cup, his expression turning serious. "The Yang Clan wants to take charge of Yue State's affairs. How will the various sects and gates be handled?"

Li Zhouluo shook his head. "You would probably have to ask Jiangliang about that. He is highly regarded by that great personage and is very clear on these matters. I was able to claim some kinship, but I don't count as one of his court."

"I only heard one thing..."

Li Xuanxuan raised an eyebrow, listening as the junior continued, "Some days ago, that grand-uncle of mine visited both the Snow Wings Gate and the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate. He even went more than once to arrange many affairs. At the very least, those two gates... should be fine."

The old man said with surprise, "The Snow Wings Gate has sealed its mountain for many years. They actually have a connection to the Yang Clan?"

Li Zhouluo's face was grave. "This junior does not know for certain. But I heard that a former master of the Snow Wings Gate was called Daoist Master Guan Xu, and it seems... he was very close to the Yang Clan."

"Oh?"

Li Xuanxuan mulled this over for a moment before raising his head, asking with some hesitation, "Yuanqin... how is he? Is there any chance he will return?"

Li Zhouluo had clearly inquired about this beforehand and had his answer ready. He replied naturally, "All those cultivators from Azure Pond—not a single name on the roster or a single soul lamp was spared. Si Tongyi handed every last one of them over to be recorded by the Bureau of Immortal Rites. That elder is among them, but he has not yet come out of seclusion. He is still locked away on Azure Pond Mountain."

Li Xuanxuan had expected this. He raised an eyebrow. "Do you know what arrangements Li Quantao has... in Simin?"

Li Zhouluo paused, clearly surprised by the abrupt change in topic. He quickly answered, "I have seen him! Perhaps because both the Sima Family and Jiangliang recommended him, he is also highly regarded. He had a personal audience with the great personage, and I heard they spoke privately in the great hall for a long time. The territory he received is said to be one of the very best!"

Li Xuanxuan sighed inwardly and asked no more on that subject. Instead, he inquired about Zhouluo's cultivation and daily life. After they had chatted for some time, he finally sighed again.

"You... since you have this kinship, and the Yang Clan has sought you out... what are your arrangements now?"

This question made Li Zhouluo stand up in a hurry. He lowered his voice.

"This junior has no divided loyalties... It's just... I heard from that grand-uncle that a certain great personage wishes to protect this branch of the family that married into the Yang Clan... That's why I was granted territory in Simin. I have no desire to stay long with the Yang Clan, which is why I hurried back."

A trace of melancholy crossed his features. "The Lake is my lineage. The Yang Clan, no matter what, is only my grandmother's clan. I feel an an affinity for them, but it's hard to give them my heart. We are different, after all. What sense is there in taking up residence in Simin!"

Li Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment, then nodded.

"Sometimes, these things are not up to us. For now, cultivate here at the Lake and wait to see how things change."

Li Zhouluo nodded grimly. He gave a slight bow and was preparing to leave the pavilion when Li Xuanxuan suddenly asked:

"Linhai Prefecture... was it a breakthrough or a death?"

"Reporting to the elder, it was a breakthrough... Lingu Lanying!"

The junior replied, carefully closed the door, and silently withdrew.

Only then did motes of Heavenly Light descend, coalescing on the seat opposite. A man in white-gold Daoist robes materialized, having clearly been sitting there for a long time. Beside him stood another man in black-gold robes. They were, in fact, the two Daoist Masters of the Lake.

"Ming'er..."

Li Xuanxuan rose as Li Ximing spoke, his voice thoughtful. "Being granted territory in Simin... The Yang Clan intends to keep him there to be ordered around."

"Indeed..." The old man frowned, looking deeply troubled. "It's not just Zhouluo. Quantao has also been given an important position... And although Yuanqin is well-hidden and hasn't emerged from seclusion, he will likely be unable to avoid it in the future. The people from the south are watching very closely."

Li Zhouwei paced the hall, his own thoughts troubled. He raised an eyebrow.

"Lingu Lanying... So the old sword immortal foresaw this! The Lin Clan won't be needing anyone else to worry about them."

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully. The hall fell silent for a moment. Then, Li Zhouwei looked up and said in a low voice, "The Sparrow Carp Fish truly was ordered to go south..."

The other two looked at him. The gold-eyed youth's expression was shadowed.

"Even if he is one of the Three Dao Armors, a reincarnation of True Monarch Tianwu's Metallic Essence, he probably doesn't have the right to ascend to Fruition Attainment step-by-step through cultivation alone. Since everyone under heaven wishes to hasten this matter, it's only natural that everyone would want to help him."

"The divine mystery is bright within, a fierce might overflows without. Righteous nature halts depravity, benevolent authority is boundless. Slaying demons and fiends, upholding martial arts to preserve truth..."

Li Zhouwei raised his brow.

"Righteous nature halts depravity. If the Way of Great Desire doesn't come south, what depravity is there to halt? This matter doesn't require the Underworld or the great Yang personage to manage it at all. The north will naturally give him the opportunity to 'halt depravity'!"

...

### Quanwu Mountain

Quanwu Mountain was the northern barrier of Simin Prefecture, the number one prefecture in the heartland of Yue State. Although it was a mountain forest with no shortage of Demon beasts, it had always been the private garden of immortal cultivators. Fortunately, the Azure Pond Sect, which had exploited Quanwu Mountain most ruthlessly, had been in decline for decades, allowing the local Demon beasts to regain some vitality.

But now, this lush, jungle-covered mountain was shrouded in gray light, appearing dim and colorless. Karmic fires circled in the air, casting down countless streams of black light.

"Awoooo...!"

Howls of misery rose and fell throughout the mountains. The demon generals who usually eked out an existence here had clearly become fish on the Buddhist cultivators' chopping block. One after another, rays of brilliant light fell through the karmic fire, subjugating them one by one.

_Crack..._

The colors at the base of the mountain ridge dimmed. A giant crow was shrinking within a halo of light, tucking in its wings and transforming into a dark-faced man. He looked terrified, calling out in a low voice, "Daoist Yuan? Daoist Yuan!"

An old man scrambled over, his dharma power turbid. He was merely an impure cultivator, ancient beyond belief, and his eyes were frantic with anxiety.

"This... the heavens have changed!"

The Demon beast's expression twisted. He gritted his teeth. "Yuan Huzhong, aren't you from some Yuan family? How could you have no news of such a massive event! How do we escape now!"

"What Yuan family... Hah!"

At the mention of the Yuan family, the old man, Yuan Huzhong, raised his eyebrows but didn't dare say more. He looked down at the many points of light in the mountain ridges below, terrified.

"It's the Buddhist cultivators... They're attacking! There are at least twenty thousand of them in the forest! There's no hiding!"

"Save yourself!" the Demon beast cursed, but he didn't dare ride the wind and fly. He spat viciously, "At least you're not a Demon beast. You won't attract much attention. Take the mountain paths out of here; you have a good chance of survival!"

But the old man shook his head.

Yuan Huzhong had been passing through this place in his youth when he saved the common people from a Demon beast. He had stayed to protect them ever since, guarding them for over one hundred and thirty years without wavering. Now, his lifespan was nearly spent. What desire did he have to cling to life? Even as his lips trembled with fear, he whispered,

"They are Buddhist cultivators, not demonic cultivators. I will stay and try to reason with them, ask them... Perhaps there will be a good outcome..."

Before his voice had faded, a sound came from the mountains. Someone was stumbling through the woods. It frightened Yuan Huzhong so much he spun around, only to see children walking out from all over the forest.

"You... you..."

Yuan Huzhong had poured his life's blood into these common people. He naturally recognized these children from the village below. He knew every one of them; he could even name their parents. He became instantly tense, hurrying forward and hissing, "I told you to lock your doors and not come out! What are you doing up the mountain? Hurry back, now!"

The children were only three to five years old, walking with difficulty through the pitch-black forest. Their faces were different, but they all wore the exact same, vacant, blissful smile. They trudged numbly up the mountain, gradually passing the man and the demon.

Yuan Huzhong was stunned, at a loss. He instinctively grabbed two of them, but he couldn't stop the tide. More and more children were walking up the mountain. Cold sweat beaded on his brow. Then, he heard a _thud_ from behind.

The Demon beast, Daoist Wu, had already fallen to his knees, prostrating respectfully, not daring to move.

Yuan Huzhong looked in the direction the demon was bowing. Only then did he realize that, at some unknown time, a monk had appeared in the forest. He was tall, with extremely narrow, pale red eyes. A green silk sash was tied at his waist, glowing faintly.

The monk stood silently in the shadows of the woods, staring straight at him.

_Thud!_

Yuan Huzhong had never been a brave man. A chill shot through his body, and his legs gave out. He immediately fell to his knees, stammering, "My... my lord!"

The monk took a step forward, watching him quietly. The sound of his cloth shoes snapping twigs echoed in the forest. Yuan Huzhong trembled.

"My lord... they are just children... please, show mercy..."

"It is precisely because they are children that this is good..."

The monk smiled, stopping on the mountainside. His voice was faint.

"The world is full of stubborn ignorance. They eat flesh and sleep in skins, ignorant of the fundamental law, cultivating sin as their social order... People are born without sin. But once they enter the social order, once they tread the Red Dust, the masters oppress others, and the slaves become their accomplices. Even the most persecuted tenant farmer has a wife and child to oppress when he returns home. This is the degenerate root of your mortal world."

"Common people must endure all kinds of suffering to wash away their sins before they have the karmic reward to enter the Mountains of Desire. These children are ignorant. They have not yet fallen into the worldly bonds. They have no sin on them. By going up the mountain, they will enter the fundamental law. Beneath the Golden Lotus, all people are equal, studying the Classics, in bliss and without suffering... Is that not better than staying in this mountain?"

He raised his hand and pointed at Yuan Huzhong, smiling. "Let them go up the mountain. This is their blessing, and it is also your merit."

Yuan Huzhong was sweating profusely. He vaguely understood that the monk wanted to take these children into the Buddhist Land. He whispered, "I'm afraid... I'm afraid they must choose for themselves..."

The monk's expression gradually cooled. "This is the kind, Compassionate way... Since a child is born without sin, why let them enter the Red Dust to create bad karma, to be blinded by the social order, only to wait for karmic destiny to awaken and atone? That would be _our_ sin, the sin of us cultivators! Is it not better to directly enter the Buddhist Land my teachings offer on earth?"

Yuan Huzhong watched his lips move, and his own pupils began to fog with confusion. But the monk smiled. "You say you want them to choose for themselves... but in reality... does your social order give them any room to choose? Yet you see nothing wrong with it. It is clear the poison of this world's order runs so deep that people can no longer tell the difference!"

"Since you want them to choose, I will give you a chance. The common people below are entangled in sin and still have a lifetime of suffering to endure. I cannot interfere. I will only let them go. You will bring these children up the mountain with you."

He smiled. "If, after seeing my Buddhist Land on earth, you still feel it is wrong, I will let you all leave!"

He raised his hand, and a speck of golden light shook from his sleeve. The small mountain beneath his feet suddenly swelled. The peak erupted in ten thousand rays of light, and countless golden flowers bloomed. A thousand silvery streams of water fell from the sky, flowing down the mountain ranges as wondrous music began to play.

"You are a truly good man. I used my spell arts to observe the four borders, and there is no one more suited to the path of my Buddhist Land on earth. One hundred and thirty years of merit, born from your true heart, one hundred and thirty years of service... You formed a karmic bond with my Dao long ago!"

Yuan Huzhong's gaze toward the surrounding children was still gentle and kind, but his face now held a look of sudden, profound realization. He murmured, "I understand..."

And so, amid the brilliant light, a massive, mountain-sized golden body emerged from the blazing fire, guiding him upward, submerging him in a dense golden radiance.

The Sparrow Carp Fish stood on the ground, smiling. The six-armed, four-legged golden body descended from the sky, shrinking to the size of a normal person beside him. It was Nuzi Maha, his expression deeply respectful.

"Congratulations, my lord!"

The Sparrow Carp Fish nodded with a smile, listening to Nuzi's envious tone.

"Is he a descendant of the Dams-Goat Temple Palace?"

"Correct!" The Sparrow Carp Fish's eyes narrowed slightly, a look of triumph on his face. "Although his cultivation is not high, he is considered part of the direct lineage. What's rare is his outstanding merit. He is an excellent fit for my Dao!"

Nuzi sighed endlessly.

"The orthodox heir of [The Buddhists' Celestial Participant of the Dams]... a status that would grant a seat on Mount Dayang... and he possesses such great merit. He must be a formidable figure. My lord's karmic fortune and methods... we cannot even begin to fathom them! We can only admire and revere!"

"[The Buddhists' Celestial Participant of the Dams]... Truly a great power."

A trace of emotion flickered in the Sparrow Carp Fish's eyes. He heard Nuzi shake his head and say, "He was, after all, the master of [Celestial Enlightenment Su Xikong]. It is precisely because of him... that [Celestial Enlightenment] had the possibility of attaining his position. And he was a Dao Embryo disciple... His karma... only someone of your lord's status, combined with the current situation, could possibly dare to touch it..."

The greatest hidden objective of this trip was now in his grasp. The Sparrow Carp Fish clasped his hands behind his back, looking completely satisfied. "Tell me," he said lightly, "is his karmic affinity better... or is Vast Cicada's?"

Nuzi only offered flattery. "My lord, Vast Cicada is merely of the Wei-Li bloodline. He only seized an early advantage in cultivation and achieved his Dao a bit sooner. Give it time, and he will inevitably be crushed under this one's foot..."

The monk laughed at this. He raised his chin slightly.

"Let's go. Time to experience the power of the great Yang personage."

# Chapter 1006: Stopping Lust

Sparrow Carp Fish was full of ambition, but the Maha Nuzi at his side began to worry.

"My lord, you must be careful..."

Maha Nuzi had always been a Merciful One under Sparrow Carp Fish's command. Back in the day, by relying on Sparrow Carp Fish and the power behind him, not only did Maha Nuzi receive excellent assistance, but ordinary people also didn't dare to offend him. His status was far higher than that of a typical Merciful One; he had enjoyed a life of luxury and did not want to lose it easily. Seeing the current situation, he spoke with deep concern.

"Achieving this matter is crucial, but this isn't something that can be openly discussed. It all depends on a spark of understanding; there are no clear agreements. If that great personage truly intends to kill, it will be difficult to handle."

"Even if you can escape... you will lose a century of your physical body."

On the surface, Sparrow Carp Fish's journey south seemed impressive, but Maha Nuzi knew in his heart that this was a major undertaking filled with both danger and opportunity. It might also be a conspiracy woven by several factions to cut off another arm of the Peacock Clan. For so many years, the great personages of the Peacock Clan had not responded, and the other Peacocks had repeatedly hit dead ends, causing them to become extremely wary.

Even if Yang Zhuo had only just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, his essence was Tianwu's Metallic Essence. The three suits of armor he used in the past had caused the north to suffer immense losses, and the memory of that still lingered, causing them to flinch. It was no wonder Maha Nuzi was worried, yet Sparrow Carp Fish simply shook his head and laughed.

From his sleeve, he took out a small porcelain bowl, only half the size of a palm. It rested quietly in his hand, its clear water rippling, stirring up waves.

"This is..."

Maha Nuzi's expression froze the moment he saw it. He blinked in disbelief.

The spiritual energy in the bowl was so resplendent it seemed to be solidifying, faintly shaking the Great Void itself. It was clearly Purple Mansion-grade spiritual water, and a full six portions of Purple Mansion-grade Valley Water!

"Heavenly One, Praise Cliff, Azure Ember, White Ewe, Returning Creek, and Matriarch."

These six portions of Valley Water complemented each other and seemed to be mixed with other substances of extremely rich spiritual energy, carrying a powerful lifeforce. The dense Valley Water was on the verge of spilling out of the small bowl, transforming into a rolling gray wind.

"This!"

Even though Maha Nuzi had some status in the north, his pockets were still empty. Forget about spiritual water or fire, his only Purple Mansion-grade spiritual item was tucked away at the bottom of his storage. He had never seen so much spiritual water and was momentarily entranced.

The monk smiled and said, "You are mistaken. This is not a question of whether or not to kill. The so-called 'stopping lust with righteousness' is not just a saying. Once they step out of the prefecture, they must die, to have their spirit and form extinguished and never be reborn."

Maha Nuzi was speechless, staring blankly at him. The monk narrowed his eyes slightly and laughed.

"It is precisely for this reason that this matter can only be done by my Way of Great Desire, and only by me. It is because the Peacock Clan has obtained the symbol of Black-Eyed Desire, and because my Way of Great Desire possesses the Great Virtue Golden Lotus..."

"You think I don't know? Not a single person in the north has good intentions. They all advised me to go to the south to gain the prestige of a Demon, but in reality, they all hoped I would go there to die. Even our own Great Desire Liangli — there was never a moment he didn't fear me!"

Maha Nuzi didn't know why he brought this up; he only felt his scalp prickle. He listened as the monk in front of him chuckled.

"But I have been waiting for this day. They think I am personally putting myself in danger, but that is not the case. The Great Virtue Golden Lotus planted by Quanwu has been blessed by a great personage. My main body is sitting in the Buddhist Land, on the Great Virtue Golden Lotus. I am only going down the mountain with the Small Peacock Karma and its karmic root, walking step by step until I reach outside the prefecture."

"This karmic root will become the guest for that stopping lust with righteousness! To become the Demon that is suppressed and eliminated, to achieve a great karma unseen in a thousand years!"

Maha Nuzi was struck with a jolt of alarm. He turned slightly and said, his face drained of color, "Karmic root? My lord, you want to cut off your Peacock karmic root?! This... this..."

Maha Nuzi looked down, his expression one of shock, as he watched Sparrow Carp Fish sit atop the mountain peak and slowly drink the spiritual water from the bowl. The Great Virtue Golden Lotus enveloped him, emitting waves of radiant light. He spoke quietly.

"Back then, my clan's Great Zhizhan returned to the Buddhists, enlightened by a great personage. From then on, our Merging Fire diverged, but he was, after all, the son of the Yuwu bird. The Yuwu bird was once the master of all fires, with boundless divine might, and still retained a piece of karma."

"He cultivated for many years but was still unable to advance further. He then asked the Great Buddhists, and only then did he learn that a Yuwu karmic root remained within him. If the karmic root was not removed, he would forever be trapped by Merging Fire and unable to advance further."

"That great personage in the sea removed his karmic root. Now, I am the first among the Peacocks, and I too shall remove it to achieve my Dao."

He lifted his head, his face rapidly aging. Dense wrinkles crawled across his face, solidifying him into a mere shell. From his chest and abdomen, a fire sprang forth, grand and continuous, like thousands of small serpents slithering through the air. In a moment, it enveloped the entire mountain range. It then condensed before him, landing and forming a monk.

This new monk was vibrant and full of energy, with a wicked smile. He stood quietly in the air, while the body of Sparrow Carp Fish behind him was torn open, revealing dry, pale organs. His skin and flesh crumbled, turning into a skeleton, silent and lifeless.

Maha Nuzi felt his scalp tingle, still reeling from the sheer ambition. His mind was blank.

'Using my karmic root to occupy the position of True Qi's guest...'

That True Qi stops lust with righteousness was a well-known fact. That great personage certainly needed a devil, but once this devil entered the game, he would stand as the opposite side of that great personage. Even as a devil, his destiny and status would be that of an immeasurable Celestial Demon!

Such profound karma was enough to drive any Buddhist cultivator mad!

The Way of Great Desire descended upon them, precisely to act as this devil, to escort Sparrow Carp Fish on his journey before that True Qi and solidify his claim as a Demon. But this was not without danger. Even with the Great Virtue Golden Lotus, which could contain a True Spirit, already planted before the Simin gates, there was no guarantee that the Underworld did not possess the 'Exiled Qi'!

The way of the 'Exiled Qi' brought ignorance and doom. If that great personage had a powerful artifact of the 'Exiled Qi,' a single glance could still kill him!

Even if he succeeded—having entered the guest position of the Tianwu Demon-slayer, becoming the very devil to be suppressed and eliminated, and then successfully escaping—it would be a great position and destiny... but also an extremely dangerous one. Who knew when that great personage might need one more step to succeed? Would this devil be pushed out to complete the unfinished task, filling the Dao of another?

'One must remember, the whole world is pushing this matter. Those great personages can't wait any longer. The Seven Prime Ministers may look glorious, but how much say do they have from such a height? If such a situation arises, no matter how high Sparrow Carp Fish's destiny is, he would still have to go!'

Sparrow Carp Fish was right. The Way of Great Desire could calmly travel south precisely because the Great Virtue Golden Lotus allowed for a confident attempt. But the other factions that gave way were watching with cold eyes... just waiting for the future to push him into a well!

Even the Great Desire Maha Liangli, who supported Sparrow Carp Fish, now seemed to be wary of his immense strength and the Peacock clan's backing, wishing he would die in the south.

Yet Sparrow Carp Fish's move was so brilliant and bold that ordinary people wouldn't even dare to imagine it. He dared to let the Metallic Essence of Tianwu remove his karmic root for him, adding status and destiny to his name!

In this way, he would collect all the status and destiny, while having little of the negative consequences from this great karma. 'The devil is my karmic root,' he was essentially saying, 'and it has been thoroughly purged. The more powerful you are at stopping lust with righteousness, does that not mean my true body is even more full of radiance?'

'He actually planned something like this!'

And now that things had progressed to this point, with the Great Virtue Golden Lotus already planted on the mountain and all the conditions met, the entire world was pushing for this event to happen... Maha Nuzi pondered carefully and was momentarily lost in a daze. He finally understood why Sparrow Carp Fish had sneered when he mentioned Vast Cicada.

'He's right. This is a great karma unseen in a thousand years. If this scheme succeeds... not only will it succeed, but what are Vast Cicada and Beigu? They can't even hold a candle to it. It will also pave an incredibly radiant path for him to remain in a high position...'

If Yuan Huzhong joining the Buddhists and cultivating to the rank of Maha allowed him to have a say at the Great Yang Mountain Dharma Assembly, then once Sparrow Carp Fish succeeded, it was highly possible that in a few hundred years, he would be a great figure, sitting on a high platform to teach the Dao!

'Would a matter of this magnitude not have a great personage pushing it from behind? If there were no great personage's signal, where would he have gotten six portions of Valley Water under Liangli's nose?'

In that instant, Maha Nuzi felt a chill in his heart, and his mind became crystal clear.

'Did that great personage truly not respond? The Peacock Sea's secret stash was plundered, and several Peacocks died one after another; how could this have happened without reason? It must have been a secret test by a great personage...'

'The fact that the great personage never responded was precisely to let the Peacocks be gradually plotted against, waiting for Sparrow Carp Fish to enter the game and make today's events possible!'

A profound coldness filled his heart, and he silently lowered his head.

'Such a long-standing plot, a great personage must have gotten wind of it beforehand... Who warned him? Who wants to create more division among the Seven Prime Ministers? Is it from above or below?'

But the wicked monk in front of him had already shaken out his sleeves. Without even looking at Maha Nuzi, he stepped forward. In just a few strides, he turned into a yellow dot at the foot of the mountain and gradually disappeared into the distance.

He walked across the earth as if taking ordinary steps, but he was covering great distances in a single bound. He moved south at an astonishing speed. Wherever he passed, music swelled, and the ground, whether muddy or barren, bloomed with lotus flowers. Wild beasts knelt in reverence, and pools of water glistened with light, like a Buddhist Land on earth.

...

Simin Prefecture.

Thick gray fire rose into the sky, and raucous music played, drifting lightly into the prefecture. The great hall, however, was extremely quiet, with only the faint twinkling of lanterns.

The main seat at the head of the hall was empty, but the sides were filled with young talents from various families. They sat according to their rank, either with their heads bowed, sipping tea, or in silent contemplation. The only sound was the occasional clinking of porcelain cups.

Most of them were not nervous, waiting patiently. Only Li Jiangliang's brow remained tightly furrowed as he stared at the map on his table. From time to time, a subordinate would come forward to hand him a message, allowing him to trace the black route of the Buddhist cultivators.

'Past Quanwu... one movement could affect tens of thousands, or even more...'

Li Jiangliang held up his teacup, appearing somewhat anxious. He raised his eyebrows and glanced around.

He had been tasked with formulating rituals and had not been in the hall for a long time. The people standing in this great hall had changed quite a bit, yet they were all, as was natural, descendants of the Immortal Clan or the Purple Mansion Realm.

As he was thinking, he heard a commotion. A middle-aged man in a coarse robe entered from outside the hall. His hair was half-white, and his face was stern. A gourd was tied to his waist. As soon as he stepped into the hall, several people went forward to congratulate him.

"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Lingu! Congratulations!"

"To have a divine ability... it truly shocks the four directions..."

Li Jiangliang knew who he was: Lingu Lie of the Lingu family. He had originally been an unvalued clan elder who wandered the world, but now he was the Family Head.

The Lingu family's talent pool was absolutely withering at the moment. In the past, they had many at the Foundation Establishment Realm. If there was even a shred of opportunity, they would immediately go into seclusion in Linhai Prefecture. Those talented individuals with ability had all fallen, and so Lingu Lie, a clan elder who only broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm at nearly a hundred years old, had to be called back to the clan to shoulder this great responsibility.

The moment Lingu Lanying succeeded, he instantly became a sought-after figure. A crowd of people came forward to flatter him, but Lingu Lie took a moment to look at Li Jiangliang, bowing to him from a distance.

Li Jiangliang smiled in acknowledgment. Lingu Lie immediately moved closer, laughing.

"Greetings, Lord Li!"

"Senior, you are too kind!"

Li Jiangliang had no choice but to set aside what he was doing and respond with a gentle voice. Lingu Lie said with emotion,

"I have some ties with your clan. The Daoist Master from my family back then also fought alongside your clan. He was a true peer of Daoist Master Zhaojing and felt a great kinship. He asked me to visit you!"

Li Jiangliang smiled and said, "With the Buddhist cultivators moving south, a great war is about to break out. The congratulatory gifts from each family may be delayed... Since we are both in the hall, I will offer my congratulations in advance!"

Just as the man was about to bring up old stories, he paused slightly. Li Jiangliang also dropped his smile, sensing something.

"Bang... bang bang..."

The water in the teacups on the table began to boil for no reason, making the lids hum. Layers of overlapping water and fire appeared everywhere, and a faint rustling sound of scales could be heard. Li Jiangliang reacted quickly, rising abruptly and rushing out of the great hall.

He saw white cranes circling in the sky, with layers of water and fire sparkling like stars. This summoned streaks of falling immortal light. Li Jiangliang simply turned around and looked at the other cultivators who were still bewildered inside the hall.

"Come down and greet the great personage."

The group hurried down from the hall. Led by Li Jiangliang, they all bowed in unison. Their feathered robes and splendid garments spread out across the ground, reflecting the light of the water and fire in the sky, shining brilliantly.

"Rumble!"

Azure, blue, and indigo water and fire intertwined with black, red, and yellow-brown colors in the air. Countless white cranes descended from the heavens, dissolving the endless karmic fire that poured down, illuminating the prefecture in a blaze of light.

Li Jiangliang lifted his head slightly, only to find a pair of black boots standing before him.

His heart skipped a beat. He slowly raised his head, his gaze sweeping over the man's beautifully patterned black robe, finally resting on his face.

It was an extremely ordinary, unremarkable face.

But it was this plain face that made one's mind go blank, unable to recall any of his features. The aura on his body showed no fluctuations whatsoever, as if he were a mortal.

Li Jiangliang could tell that this man's attire was similar to his wife Yang Tanyou's. He lowered his eyes slightly and found that the people around him were completely unsurprised by his appearance, as if they had not noticed him. Only then did he rise and say,

"Greetings, senior."

The man in front of him nodded slightly and smiled.

"You are the son of Bright Yang."

Li Jiangliang bowed and said,

"My father is Daoist Master Minghuang."

The man nodded in satisfaction and said softly,

"I would like to ask you to tell the Daoist Master in the lake... just say that Yang Ruiyi of the Yang clan of Simin asks the Daoist Master on the lake to come to Simin to discuss a great matter."

Li Jiangliang hesitated for a moment. The man from the Yang clan smiled, looked at him deeply, and added,

"Daoist Master Guanxuan, Yang Tianya, is also in Simin. He has been waiting for your clan for a long time and wants to catch up with the descendants of an old friend."




# Chapter 1007: Yuanbai

The world was a canvas of gray.

Sheets and layers of Merging Fire rained from the sky, burning with a fluctuating brilliance. A man clad in platinum armor and a snow-white feathered robe stood suspended in the air, True Qi coiling around him. He wielded a gleaming golden tang, a weapon upon which lightning, water, and fire intertwined with a soft, incessant crackle.

He had sharp, dark eyes and handsome features. Poised in the air, he was like the sole point of radiance in the surrounding darkness.

Beneath his feet, a massive, ink-black cauldron was pressed into the ground, slowly suppressing the surging karmic flames below. Though thousands of venomous, fiery tendrils lashed out from the periphery, attempting to overturn it, the cauldron held them firmly in place, unmoving.

Trapped beneath it, the Sparrow Carp Fish had already been reduced to a vortex of karmic fire, yet it still struggled, sending ripples through the air, unable to push the great cauldron away.

‘Sparrow Carp Fish… a sixth-generation Maha…’

The Great Void churned in chaos, with no corner of peace. Yet, within the tumult, a point of azure light remained fixed, observing quietly.

It was Si Yuanli.

He had been standing in the Great Void for some time, silently watching the peacock descendant struggle beneath the cauldron. He felt nothing but a serene coldness.

‘The Way of Great Desire planted the Great Virtue Golden Lotus outside the prefecture for a reason… The whole world knows this. For that peacock to act so brazenly, it must have had something to rely on. But with this treasure revealed, what hope of survival does it have?’

Si Yuanli, of course, recognized the ink-black cauldron. It was one of the founding ritual vessels of the King of Yue State, a Spiritual Treasure of the Exiled Qi class—the Guzhou Cauldron.

It was precisely its connection to Exiled Qi that made Si Yuanli fear that the man below him would never be able to return to the north.

The path of Exiled Qi had been severed for a long time. Many in the Purple Mansion Realm lived their entire lives without ever seeing an Exiled Qi spiritual object, let alone a Spiritual Artifact or Spiritual Treasure. The Guzhou Cauldron had most likely come from the Underworld, serving as material evidence of Yue State’s ties to it.

With the King of Yue's disappearance, the Guzhou Cauldron had vanished as well. To see it now, right before his eyes… if he weren't already bowing to another’s power, Si Yuanli might have laughed aloud.

‘They acted so recklessly back then, and now they're parading their might. All that's missing is for Judge Yang to come out and give a few pointers!’

He forced a sycophantic smile, but fearing his thoughts might be perceived, he pushed them aside. He watched as the gray flames were suppressed, inch by inch, while shrill roars echoed and the Great Void roiled ever more violently. A pang of envy struck him.

‘The water and fire of True Qi are truly formidable… Back then, Tinglan commanded respect from all cultivators with just a portion of the Immeasurable Water and Fire. But for this man, it is one of his six aspects. He’s a natural incarnation of Metallic Essence. How enviable!’

The path of True Qi cultivation emphasized preserving truth through martial prowess, culminating in the birth of six types of water and fire. But the man before him, Yang Zhuo, was a reincarnation of Metallic Essence itself. He didn’t need to perfect his divine ability to summon the six forms of water and fire. Although their power and form were slightly diminished, it was still a jaw-dropping feat.

Si Yuanli waited a moment longer for the Spiritual Treasure to settle firmly on the ground before stepping out. He materialized amidst the chaotic water and fire, bowed slightly, and spoke with reverence.

"Yue State noble, Sima Yuanli… on behalf of the Sima Family, I congratulate you, my lord, on achieving your divine ability!"

Truth be told, Si Yuanli was certainly no match for him, to say nothing of the chasm in their status. No matter how many schemes churned in his heart, he was not one who couldn't bow his head. His face was a mask of submission, his posture so low it was unlike that of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

The man in the sky lowered his gaze, the interwoven water and fire around him receding as his brilliant aura finally subsided.

"So it is Daoist Master Qinghu," he said casually.

"This past year… I've troubled you."

"I wouldn't dare… I wouldn't dare!"

He was, of course, referring to how Si Yuanli had voluntarily defended his overseas territory from incursions while he was in seclusion. Si Yuanli was overwhelmed by the acknowledgement, bowing deeply. "Our family once served Great Ning as an adjunct of Tianwu, a noble house of the Celestial Dynasty. To return to Tianwu's banner today… we are moved to tears…"

His words clearly pleased the man in the Great Void. They not only flattered him but also highlighted Si Yuanli’s unique status. Even Yang Zhuo lowered his gaze and praised him.

"Back then, all the noble houses assisted Tianwu. Cause and effect have run their course. Today, you must all return to the fold and restore the glory of the former dynasty."

Si Yuanli bowed low, his heart soaring with joy. He knew his position was secure. He immediately moved forward to escort him back to the prefecture, but then he heard Yang Zhuo laugh.

"Daoist Master Si, have you ever considered being enfeoffed as a king?"

A tremor went through Si Yuanli.

‘He asked… I knew he would ask!’

Ever since the Way of Great Desire had moved south, Si Yuanli had been uneasy. He had made inquiries through various channels, relying on connections left by his predecessors, and had finally managed to contact the Nine Mounds in the Peacock Sea.

But after several pleas, the Nine Mounds, finally tired of his persistence, gave him but a single reply:

‘The Sima are subjects of Tianwu.’

It was this very sentence that prompted him to introduce himself as from the Sima Family and to answer Yang Zhuo’s question without a hint of hesitation.

"The Sima are subjects of Tianwu," he declared firmly, "and only subjects!"

His words made even Yang Zhuo pause. He gave Si Yuanli a second, appraising look before smiling and striding forward.

"You're quite astute," he said softly.

Si Yuanli bowed his head and followed him into the prefecture as a tidal wave of cheers erupted from the surroundings.

The reincarnated figure of Metallic Essence maintained his smile and remarked offhandedly, "Daoist Master Chen is a senior, after all. It seems I'll have to pay him a visit."

Si Yuanli was no fool. With the guidance from the Nine Mounds and various other confirmations, he understood the situation perfectly.

‘Just now, when Simin was in turmoil, plenty of people were observing from the Great Void. Senior Chen Yin must have been watching, but he quietly withdrew…’

Yang Zhuo’s divine ability was shielded by the Exiled Qi of the Guzhou Cauldron, obscuring him from view. Naturally, there was no crowd of well-wishers. Only Si Yuanli, who had pledged allegiance early, was able to witness the event up close. It was normal for Chen Yin to retreat when he couldn't get a clear picture. And while Yang Zhuo’s words held no blame, Si Yuanli felt a surge of relief.

‘The Chen Clan… others may not know, but how could the Underworld not? The Chen Clan held immense power in the last years of Ning State. The so-called Yushui Chen Clan is just a branch that came down from Ning State, but from an earlier time, not descendants of the Chen Xuanli brothers… Chen Yin’s best move… would have been to wait outside the prefecture for my lord!’

Though he thought this, a chilling, delayed fear crept into his heart.
‘Of the great noble families of Ning State back then, aside from the Li and Jiang clans who governed regions and were too difficult to control due to their unique backgrounds, all the others were either regional overlords in Jiangnan or famous far and wide. Even the weakest among them had their tracks exposed and were brought into the fold long ago… This was all prepared in advance.’

‘The ice is three feet thick—not the result of a single cold day…’

---

## Gardenia Scenery Mountain

The Heavenly Light was brilliant, and gardenia petals danced in the air amidst a swirl of multicolored light. A Daoist sat before a white jade table, his expression calm as he held a jade slip pressed against the tabletop.

Across from him sat an old man with a kind face and a sword on his back. He looked perfectly ordinary; if not for the resplendent divine ability coalescing around him, one might mistake him for a commoner.

The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators sat in silence. It was clear they had been this way for some time.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing…"

The swordsman was, of course, Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin.

The Yuyang Chen Clan had always been on good terms with Moongaze, and their shared connection to the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition had brought them even closer. When Li Zhouwei had aided him during the chaos at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, their bond had deepened further.

Thus, when the karmic fire fell upon Simin and the water and fire blazed, Daoist Master Yushui found himself without his Supreme Yang backing. He had made his way straight to Gardenia Scenery Mountain, where he now sat, sighing with profound unease.

Li Ximing remained silent for a moment before lowering his gaze and asking, "How are things in Simin?"

"It’s shielded by Exiled Qi, so I couldn't see clearly. But… I'm afraid the Sparrow Carp Fish's rampage is over."

Chen Yin nodded, a touch of melancholy in his voice. "My junior has already sent word. I imagine you know as well, Daoist friend… From here on, it will likely be about establishing a state. Perhaps they mean to rebuild the great Yue!"

Li Ximing sighed internally. Finally finding an opportunity, he said gravely, "Since things have come to this, there are a few matters I must ask you about, Senior, and a few things I must share."

Chen Yin nodded.

Li Ximing frowned. "Yue State… was the Underworld's Yue State. Everyone knew this back then. Why did it fall to its current state?"

This question had been buried in Li Ximing’s heart for a long time. For ages, the Three Sects and Seven Gates had suppressed this information, burying these events in history, turning them into a taboo…

Li Ximing had never intended to pry, but with the rise of the Yang family and the talk of rebuilding a state, the history of the old Yue State had become critically important.

Chen Yin was not surprised by the question. He nodded slightly and sighed.

"Regarding this matter… the Chen Clan's records are limited. The story of Jiangnan must begin with the great Chu State…"

"In those years, Chu State was in chaos. The imperial clan turned on itself, reaching a point where there were five emperors in ten years. Finally, a powerful minister, Xiao Ci, usurped the entire Jiangnan region from Chu and established the great Wu State. At that time, the Yang family were merely subjects of Wu."

His expression was complicated. "It's shameful to admit… but my Yuyang Chen Clan… also received favors from Wu State back then. That’s how we got our start, with a prefecture of our own in Jiangnan…"

"But the world is unpredictable. Even a man as powerful as Xiao Ci, a master of conspiracy and strategy, was only a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Though he seized the throne during Chu’s chaos, he had no foundation to lean on. He soon repeated the same mistakes, and Wu State collapsed as well. Rebel armies rose up everywhere, and only then did the Yang family take the stage."

"The Xiao-Wu forces retreated into Wu State, while the Yang-Yue quickly established their own state. Their first capital was Guzhou, which is now the Jingchuan prefecture of Sword Gate. That is how the Guzhou Cauldron became famous!"

He added thoughtfully, "I suspect… that treasure has reappeared and is in that lord's hands."

Li Ximing nodded.

The old man continued, "Though Yang-Yue and Xiao-Wu are now shadows of their former selves, and they played very different roles, they shared one thing in common. People speak of Emperor Wei and Emperor Chu, but Wu and Yue had only kings!"

"Xiao Ci usurped the throne and called himself emperor, but who in later generations recognized him? Never mind the supremely dominant Emperor Wei; Emperor Liang, Emperor Chu, even Shi Chang of the great Qi, who could only lament his state’s decline—that man was a True Monarch. How could Xiao Ci, a mere Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, claim the title of emperor?"

He paused, collecting his thoughts. "And the King of Yue was even more straightforward. He started his uprising in Yue Province, swept through most of Jiangnan, and was on the verge of breaking through to the True Monarch realm when he vanished overnight. His heirs inherited the enterprise but couldn't unify the state. They tried several times to grant their father a posthumous imperial title, but they were blocked by the great noble families. In the end, he was left to call himself king, all alone."

"The great noble families…"

Li Ximing looked puzzled. Chen Yin understood immediately.

"The King of Yue vanished too suddenly. The entire state hadn't been pacified yet, and there were hardly any members of the imperial clan. The noble families of the time were numerous and powerful, most of them able to govern their own lands autonomously. The Yue royal clan was powerless to control them and had to rule jointly, gradually losing power, though they retained a shred of dignity."

"Later, the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition began to establish its lineages and sects. As the Immortal Mansions went into seclusion, the old prohibitions were broken one by one, and the last bit of decency for the Yue imperial descendants was stripped away. Their rule became nominal. The original noble families became sects, like Hongxue, Wuzhu Gate, and Li Chi… Even those that didn't become sects mostly secured important positions within them, their surnames prominent."

"But… Wuzhu Gate and the others have long since been buried in the dust of history, with no trace left!"

He sounded wistful. "The survival of Yue State can be credited to the protection of their ancestors, but its rise and fall… that is a matter for their descendants."

He was being polite, but his inner thoughts were far less charitable.

‘If it weren't for the borrowed might of the Underworld, they would have followed Wu State into oblivion long ago… How could they have dragged things out for so long, ending up in this pathetic, half-dead state…’

Though he didn't speak his thoughts aloud, the implication was clear. Li Ximing took note and pondered for a long time. Before he could ask another question, Chen Yin’s expression turned grim.

"Daoist friend, don't just look at Yue State. Wu State is no different. It's also in turmoil. That light of True Qi… I hear he's another major figure, one who has the great families of Wu State crying bitter tears."

Li Ximing sipped his tea as the old man narrowed his eyes. "My family is close to Wu State, so we hear more news. Given the current situation in the world, which Purple Mansion Realm cultivator can't feel that something is amiss? Even the most unlucky ones have learned their lesson after a setback or two. Wu State's stability is just around the corner!"

He lowered his voice. "Of the three portions of True Qi from Anhuai Heaven back then, one was obtained by Changhuai, and another fell into Zipei's hands. If the last one was corrupted into a demonic form, it must be the one the Yang family possesses."

The old man's meaning was exceptionally clear. He gritted his teeth. "There was a reason Qing Tangyin started cultivating True Qi so early, focusing on the Tianwu Daoist Tradition. He was learning to refine the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel on one hand and the True Adherence and Abstruse Strategy Whip on the other, and then he had to learn the Martial Seal of Authority and Karma… He made a mess of all of them… I thought he was just fumbling around, but it turns out it was all just a rehearsal!"

Li Ximing keenly detected the emotional shift and vaguely sensed that the relationship between the Chen Clan and Changhuai wasn't good. Chen Yin just shook his head.

"Two of the three paths have emerged. The turmoil here is likely not over yet. If you receive any news, I hope your esteemed clan will inform me…"

In his eyes, at least, no matter how great the karmic ties of the Li family were, as long as Li Zhouwei did not meet an untimely end, Moongaze Lake was destined for a period of glory. And regardless of the fall that might follow that glory, the Li family was safe until it arrived.

He spoke out of ignorance, but his words made things clearer for Li Ximing.

Where was the final portion of True Qi?

His own aunt had already explained it! It was in the hands of the Dragon-kin, prepared for one of their own seeking the True Dao… Whether the Dragon Monarchs would even allow it to be reincarnated was uncertain. And even if they did, it would be a True Qi dragon of the sea!

Li Ximing remained silent, raising his cup to signal the end of the visit. He personally escorted the Daoist Master out. As he returned, he saw Li Zhouwei materialize on the mountain, his expression grave. "A letter has arrived from Jiangliang," he said in a low voice.

"Hmm?"

Li Ximing felt a flicker of doubt, and a vague sense of foreboding washed over him. Li Zhouwei glanced at a nearby courtyard guard, and the two of them sat down on the mountainside. Li Zhouwei produced a letter.

As Li Ximing watched him place it on the table, his eyes fell upon the name, and his expression instantly froze.

‘Yang… Tianya…’

He met Li Zhouwei’s solemn gaze, knowing this was bad. "Go and invite the old master here!" he said grimly.

The name Yang Tianya was not famous in Jiangnan. In fact, he was only a rumor from a century ago, and few of the younger generation knew of him. But the Li family could never, ever forget him.

‘Back then… our family received the Talisman Seed. To hide the fact that all the elders had aptitude… we pretended our ancestor, Li Mutian, was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator…’

The lie had protected the Li family for a time, but a Foundation Establishment cultivator having so many children also raised suspicion. It wasn't until Li Zhouwei was born, and the family was branded with the name Bright Yang Wei-Li, that their origins were finally explained away.

But as ancestor Li Mutian’s direct superior at the time, Yang Tianya had even seemed to acknowledge his existence as a Foundation Establishment cultivator—an utter absurdity!

"Descendant of an old friend…"

Those four simple words carried a weight of killing intent that could not be underestimated. Whether it was mockery or a threat, it made Li Ximming’s brows furrow deeply.

Only when the old master had arrived and taken the small letter did Li Zhouwei speak, his voice low and heavy.

"Yang Tianya must know the truth… These four words are intentional. We have to go to Simin prefecture!"

Li Xuanxuan read the letter over and over, his lips turning slightly pale. Li Ximing frowned. "Since he is already in the Purple Mansion Realm, he must have a perfect memory. If our ancestor never caught his eye, we might still have some room to maneuver. But if he saw him clearly back then, this will not be easy to resolve."

"No matter what, the fact that our ancestor had four sons, at least three of whom had spiritual aptitude, cannot be erased! Even if he really were a Foundation Establishment cultivator, that in itself is a natural loophole…"

His expression grew intense. "The four elders of the four branches were close in age, born almost one after another… Logically, an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator could not have such offspring. Only someone who was both of Bright Yang Wei descent and at Foundation Establishment… might have a chance."

He thought for a few seconds. "Remember… even with a perfect memory, he wouldn't remember tens of thousands of names. He couldn't possibly match our ancestor among thousands of mortals. As long as he never met our ancestor, we can claim he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator from elsewhere who faked his identity… and falsely registered under Yang Tianya’s name…"

Li Xuanxuan was silent for a moment before he finally spoke. "Yang Tianya definitely met him. Not only did he meet him, he could even… call him by name."

Li Ximing’s heart stopped. Both Daoist Masters turned to look at him. The old man’s voice was haunting.

"When I was young… I had the good fortune to meet our ancestor. He told me about the Guli Dao conscription. He held a minor officer's post at the time."

The old man’s face was filled with a dawning horror. "He said: 'General Yang was strict with the army, but he ate and lived with us as equals, like family. He personally taught us the Yue military's battle tactics'."

Li Xuanxuan's pupils dilated, his voice trembling slightly. "Now, of course, we know… Yang Tianya was just using the army of ten thousand to refine a weapon… If so! If so! Why would he, a dignified Foundation Establishment cultivator, a descendant of the Yue imperial line, eat and live with mortals as equals, like family…"

"He did it on purpose. He was the first to notice our family, to notice the Wei-Li bloodline within us. Earlier than anyone… earlier than anyone…"

Li Xuanxuan's words were heavy with meaning, sending a chill down Li Ximing's spine. He set down his cup. "Which means… he had already met our ancestor. And he even… intentionally let our ancestor return, to Moongaze Lake."

"And that's why… he vouched for our family for no reason…"

Li Zhouwei's face was grim as he picked up the thread. "So from that moment on, the Underworld's plans were already in motion. It wasn't Peak Master Yuan Tuan who sought us out on Qingsui Peak; it was Diyun Peak that came looking for her. Or at least, it’s possible Diyun Peak intentionally guided her to our door…"

"The exposure of our Wei-Li bloodline… was also within the Yang family's expectations."

Li Ximing was about to speak, but Li Zhouwei's expression grew darker. "If the union of the Wei-Li and Yang bloodlines was orchestrated by the Underworld, then I have a question—a seamless union would require a Li to first enter the Azure Pond Sect. In that case, was it truly a coincidence that the Qingsui Peak cultivator at the time, Si Yuanbai, just happened to be passing by?"

His words made a cold sweat break out on Li Ximing's back. Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes. "If getting a family elder into the sect was the first objective, then the Sword Immortal revealing his talent and obtaining the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance was likely outside their expectations, forcing them to abandon their plan…"

"But what about Si Yuanbai?"

Li Zhouwei's tone turned icy. "He vanished without reason from Azure Pond, with only a vague message about 'fleeing to the west.' He's been gone for over a hundred years, with no trace. No one can find him… Even Si Yuanli has completely forgotten about him… Could there be a reason for that?"

Li Ximing's face remained impassive, but his mind was in turmoil, a tide of cold dread rising within him.

Si Yuanbai.

He was no stranger to the name. Si Yuanbai was, in a sense, his grand-master. His disappearance was a constant sorrow for Xiao Yuansi, something he should have been preoccupied with. But now that it was mentioned, a sudden doubt leaped into his mind.

‘If Master was always thinking about Si Yuanbai… even if Daoist Master Xiao didn't care… back when I reached the Purple Mansion Realm and personally went to the lake to meet him, we spoke for a long time. He should have asked me then…’

‘But he didn't.’

When had Xiao Yuansi remembered Si Yuanbai?

In Cangzhou.

Xiao Yuansi's exact words were: ‘These past years, one matter has repeatedly come to mind.’

‘That was during his time in Cangzhou… In Jiangnan, he wouldn't remember him. Even if he did, the thought would pass fleetingly, without investigation. Only after leaving Jiangnan and reaching Cangzhou in the Northern Sea did he become thoughtful… did he remember to ask me about my grand-master's whereabouts.’

The aged face of Xiao Chuting suddenly appeared in his mind's eye, his weary voice echoing in his ears once more:

‘Be cautious in making friends and offering protection.’

‘Is this something we can truly investigate?’

The whole of Gardenia Scenery Mountain was deathly quiet, the white blossoms dancing in the wind. Li Zhouwei's voice grew lower, more ghostly.

"If that's the case, since they noticed the Wei-Li bloodline so early, wouldn't it be perfectly logical to send a few Underworld emissaries—or not even them, just a couple of cultivators—to keep an eye on us?"




# Chapter 1008: Yang Tianya

A hush fell over the room after Li Zhouwei spoke. Li Ximing, restless with anxiety, rose to his feet. He hesitated, pacing for a moment, but ultimately decided against mentioning the matter concerning Xiao Yuansi.

Li Xuanxuan furrowed his brow. “At the very least… no consequences have manifested yet.”

“Whatever the truth of the matter, we must be mentally prepared,” Li Zhouwei said. “Regarding the Ancestor’s affairs, and the events of a century ago—no matter how much they know, we must be on our guard.”

Li Ximing nodded and offered his own counsel. “The situation in the north… their message is quite clear. Luoxia doesn’t particularly care about us; they’ll use us if we’re useful, and discard us if we’re not. Since the Underworld is a power on the same level as Luoxia, their decision-making in this regard might be quite similar…”

Li Zhouwei studied both of their expressions carefully before looking away and nodding in silent agreement.

“Furthermore,” the old man said, his voice deep and resonant, “we were born because of our lord’s will, and we shall die for it. The entanglement with the Bright Yang Dao is not without reason.”

The “lord” he spoke of could have been Luoxia or the Underworld, or it could have referred to the Wei-Li heritage. But Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing both knew exactly who he meant.

From their beginnings at Moongaze Lake, no matter which faction they sided with, the Li family’s true backing had never changed. Others might be ignorant, but the three of them understood with perfect clarity that a great “lord” stood behind their clan.

Yet, facing one of the most powerful forces in the world—the Underworld, a behemoth that rivaled Luoxia and held sway over the entire south—Li Ximing felt his confidence waver. Unlike their dealings with Luoxia, their family had risen step by step, right under the Underworld’s watchful eyes.

The three men lapsed into silence. Just as Li Ximing was about to get up, Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze.

“Granduncle should remain at home and focus on his cultivation. This time… allow me to meet with them.”

### Simin Prefecture

The sky was clear and bright.

Sunlight streamed into the pavilion, illuminating the fine dust in the air. A woman with a refined appearance, dressed in black robes, hurried up the stairs. She paused at the door to straighten her clothes before stepping inside.

_Creak._

The room’s furnishings were stark and simple. A dark wooden chair sat in the center, a cup of hot tea steaming upon the table beside it. An old man, sleeves folded, occupied the main seat, engrossed in a scroll.

Though advanced in age, he possessed a formidable, broad-shouldered build. His imposing aura was palpable, even with his eyes downcast. He was like a sleeping tiger; one look was enough to inspire awe and fear.

The woman bowed low. “Junior Tianyou greets the Ancestor!”

This was none other than Li Jiangliang’s wife, Yang Tianyou, an imperial descendant of the Yang Clan.

“Rise.”

The old man’s gaze remained fixed on the black-covered scroll in his hands, its faint golden characters shimmering in the sunlight. His voice was deep and heavy.

“Tianyou… where is your husband?”

Yang Tianyou lowered her head respectfully. “He is in the prefecture, overseeing the rites for the founding of the new state.”

The old man chuckled softly. “I have observed that boy. He is not of the Bright Yang Dao. Born a son of nobility, yet he shows compassion for the common folk. That is hardly the way of the great clans, nor is it a path to self-preservation.”

Yang Tianyou kept her eyes lowered. The elder finally shifted his gaze to her.

“Tell me,” he said with a smile, “the Ning State had endured for a long time. The Great Ning is close, while the Wei-Li are distant. The Li and Jiang families have been joined by marriage for generations, which is how a figure like Li Jiangqun, favored by the Supreme Yin, came to be. What connection do they truly have with the Bright Yang Dao anymore? In my view, you operatives are far too cautious. A mere trace of a bloodline, and you insist on keeping it under constant watch.”

Yang Tianyou dropped to her knees, her heart seized with fear. “Ancestor… this junior believes that caution is never a mistake. Eliminating future troubles is always for the best.”

The old man finally looked away, his smile vanishing. He set the scroll down.

“Oh?”

His voice was calm, but it made Yang Tianyou tremble. “Ancestor,” she whispered,

“Qingyu Qian and Lord Xuan'an, after all, control an immortal formation and wield the Moon Laurel’s Transmuting Radiance, and they are protected by an Immortal Artifact. The chaos now is already great enough. Once things stabilize, they should be eradicated together to prevent any unforeseen complications!”

The elder sighed. “Your considerations have merit. But if something happens to Xuan'an, that fox demon won't have much time left to cause trouble. What good does their constant scheming do? How many times has this been now?”

“Xuan'an is no Zhang Yuanyu, nor is he Su Xikong. Even those two had to align with the greater situation to achieve their ambitions. What can a cornered rat hiding in a prefecture hope to accomplish, no matter how clever his schemes? He once believed himself a master puppeteer, but the one pulling the strings was never him; it was Senior Yingze.”

“Tang Shu has his eyes on him. Whatever tricks he has, the moment he appears on the list, he will be cast into the Underworld and vanish without a trace. What is the point?”

Yang Tianyou quickly bowed her head in agreement. “This junior understands. When the Prefecture Lord was first reincarnated, he carried the air of one who could command the world, but that aura belonged to Lord Yingze. Afterward… all his pawns, from Duanmu Kui to Li Jiangqun, were exercises in futility. Qingyu Qian is timid and indecisive. He made three attempts, stooping so low as to target minor cultivators and mortals, and each time his plans backfired spectacularly. It’s laughable.”

“Without a great lord’s support, Qingyu Qian is powerless, even with his lake. He thought he had succeeded, but he never knew that a certain lord lost the Sun Seeker Ring, which ended up at the lake, drawing the attention of the Bright Yang Dao. Now they can never wash themselves clean of the association. That group of Ning-Li descendants is now seen as the orthodox lineage of the Wei-Li, and in the end, the world will demand their deaths! He has lost everything!”

She spoke with a slight laugh, all the while cautiously observing the old man.

“Now that the Heaven–Governing Rank Designation has been relegated to the Underworld, they are trapped in their own small world, utterly useless. It’s best to eliminate them sooner rather than later. What if that fox demon backing Qingyu Qian actually succeeds in its breakthrough?”

“Hmm…”

As Yang Tianyou fell silent, the old man spoke casually. “You are naive. The Sun Seeker Ring may well have been a ploy by the fox. We should not underestimate them, but some cuts must be made with a gentle blade. Even if the fox succeeds, so what? We would simply no longer covet their possessions and would welcome her to the table to share the spoils. They have no desire for their monarch to return, either.”

“For us, Luoxia and the Dragon-kin are what truly matter. Once the grand situation is settled, these minor issues can be dealt with all at once. After all… there is still one loose end, hiding in the Southern Sea…”

He smiled, looking at Yang Tianyou with renewed interest. “There is no need to probe me further. You state your position with such conviction. Are you truly certain you hold no desire to preserve even a fraction of that bloodline?”

“This junior would never dare to have divided loyalties!” Yang Tianyou exclaimed in terror.

The old man withdrew his gaze. “Across the entire world, perhaps only my Yang family and Judge Jiang have both the motive and the means to protect them… but we can only ensure their deaths are dignified, not that they live. We can protect the individuals, but not their lineage.”

His tone grew colder. “Qingyu Qian’s little lake is Judge Tang’s affair, outside our jurisdiction. We will use them as we see fit. If the pieces can be played, they will be. If not, they will be discarded. What truly matters is the success or failure of our enterprise in the Great Song. The Ten Halls are watching. If we fail, there will be consequences for us all.”

Yang Tianyou kowtowed repeatedly, cold sweat beading on her brow. Suddenly, the door creaked open and a man entered.

He had an ordinary, unremarkable face and was dressed in black robes. It was Yang Ruiyi of the Yang Clan.

The Daoist Master entered the pavilion and saw Yang Tianyou kneeling on the floor. A flicker of pain crossed his eyes, but he moved swiftly, kneeling beside her without hesitation.

“Ancestor! Someone from the lake has arrived!”

“Oh?” The old man took a sip of tea. “Is it the White Qilin or that Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?”

“It is the White Qilin,” Yang Ruiyi replied respectfully.

A hint of doubt crossed the young man’s face, but the elder merely waved a hand.

“It’s a rare occasion for him to visit the mortal realm. Let him come up.”

Only then did Yang Ruiyi dare to rise. He helped Yang Tianyou to her feet, whispering for her to go downstairs, and then stood respectfully by the old man’s side. The elder stood up, vacating the main seat.

“Sit.”

Yang Ruiyi was momentarily flustered. “Junior… Junior…”

“I said, sit.”

The old man gave the order casually and seated himself in a secondary chair by the window, his gaze fixed on the scenery outside. He waited in silence. A few breaths later, the sound of steady footsteps approached.

_Creak._

The door opened again. Yang Ruiyi’s expression was once again calm as he looked up and smiled. “White Qilin has arrived.”

The pair of golden eyes were particularly striking within the pavilion. Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. “From the Moongaze Li Clan, Minghuang, Li Zhouwei.”

Yang Ruiyi stood and returned the courtesy with a smile. “From the Simin Yang Clan, Lutao, Yang Ruiyi. Please.”

Li Zhouwei smiled and nodded, a faint golden light glinting in his eyes.

‘Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, with a profound cultivation base…’

He followed the other man’s lead and took a seat, his eyes turning to meet the gaze of the old man by the window.

The elder’s gaze was calm yet powerful, tinged with a scrutinizing quality as he watched him in silence.

Li Zhouwei’s smile remained unchanged, though he allowed a perfectly measured hint of confusion to show on his face. “And this is…”

Yang Ruiyi quickly rose. “This is my clan’s Ancestor, of the ‘Tian’ generation. His name is Ya, and his Daoist title is Guanxuan!”

A look of sudden understanding dawned on Li Zhouwei’s face. He spoke with neither arrogance nor humility. “So it is Senior Guanxuan!”

‘Yang Tianya…’

The name the Li family had pondered for so long belonged to the man now before him. A ripple went through Li Zhouwei’s heart, a tension that pulled it taut. The first thing to react was, surprisingly, the Great Fissure Golden Pupils he had long since cast to the back of his mind, which now warned him that this person was different.

He looked straight ahead, but a chill was slowly spreading through his heart.

It wasn’t because of the man’s placid demeanor, nor was it due to his own anxiety about the coming conversation. It was because when Li Zhouwei raised his eyes and connected his spiritual sense to the Immortal Artifact, the scene before him abruptly changed.

The sun was still bright, but the table and chair were empty.

There was no old man, no Yang Tianya—only a vacant seat.

Li Zhouwei’s expression remained composed as he stared at the spot. A wave of dizziness washed over him. The world around him flickered, an illusion on the verge of shattering. A single point of blackness descended upon the chair, instantly consuming his vision.

Within this darkness, tides rose and fell in a cycle of life, death, and silent annihilation. All things faded into nameless oblivion, losing their unique essence. Countless shadows sank into its depths, and from the void, a mesmerizing weariness was born.

A cool, clear sensation rushed into his mind, pulling him back from the brink. In that instant of clarity, a single thought dominated his mind:

‘Is he truly Yang Tianya?’

Forcibly suppressing the terror in his heart, Li Zhouwei averted his gaze and said respectfully, “I have long heard of your great name.”

Yang Tianya’s expression was serene. He nodded, his eyes seeming to peer directly into Li Zhouwei’s own. His smile became more genuine, yet tinged with regret. “Remarkable… truly remarkable…”

Li Zhouwei collected himself and returned the gesture. Yang Tianya watched him casually. “Daoist Minghuang, I have heard all about how your esteemed clan has ascended to the status of an Immortal Clan! My congratulations, though they come late.”

Li Zhouwei smiled, but the other man gave him no chance to speak, continuing in a leisurely tone, “I also remember when your clan’s ancestor first made a name for himself in the army. Later, I heard your family was seeking to leverage its position, so I offered some assistance.”

At these words, realization struck Li Zhouwei.

‘Leverage its position, offered some assistance.’

Yang Tianya definitely knew about his ancestor, Li Mutian.

Li Zhouwei sighed, affecting a troubled expression. “In the early days… my clan was beset by endless slaughter and persecution at the foot of our mountain. We were too weak then, living in daily fear of disaster. Our ancestor was but a mortal, yet he somehow caught your lordship’s attention. Relying on this fateful connection, he falsely claimed to be at the Foundation Establishment Realm to protect the clan. This junior is eternally grateful…”

He replied smoothly, expressing his gratitude while deftly shifting the focus back to the other party. But Yang Tianya simply lowered his head and sipped his tea.

“A descendant of a noble immortal cultivator, appearing in the army,” he mused. 

“How could one not take notice?”

He was speaking the truth, of course, but he was also concealing half of it, deliberately omitting which family’s descendant he meant. He looked up with a smile, but his eyes were intently focused on Li Zhouwei, as if probing his emotions. “Pure Qi is the source of all Qi and the foundation from which all spirits are born. The basis of cultivation lies in one’s spiritual aptitude. Moongaze Lake was once a place where spiritual energy was severed, devoid of any sign of Pure Qi, making it naturally difficult for spiritual aptitude to manifest. Your family’s rise coincided with the spiritual meridian’s revival. In truth, it was a matter of natural course!”

Uncertain how much of this was genuine, Li Zhouwei sighed. “This foundation lies in our bloodline, but without senior’s help, our ancestor would have had nothing to build upon! He often spoke of you before he passed, lamenting that he did not know your whereabouts. Otherwise, he would have brought his sons to express their gratitude in person. That would have been a fine thing…”

“To gain three from four… also a rare feat.” Having said this, Yang Tianya offered no further response, simply smiling as he drank his tea.

Li Zhouwei turned his attention to Yang Ruiyi and offered a congratulatory remark. “Congratulations!”

Yang Ruiyi was already smiling. “My Yang clan has been blessed with a True Qi Qilin-child. Things are going smoothly, a truly joyous occasion… However… it hardly compares to your renowned reputation, Daoist. There is still much we must rely on you for.”

Li Zhouwei took a sip of tea, appearing quite at ease. “You are too kind, Daoist,” he said, shaking his head. “Your esteemed clan has hidden its strength so deeply; this junior is truly impressed! As for relying on me, I am unworthy of such a thing!”

After the hollow pleasantries were exchanged, Yang Ruiyi chuckled. “My clan has had a few fortuitous encounters, but we are nothing compared to the likes of the Profound Governance Pavilion. Our power is weak. How could you be unworthy? In the future, we will have matters to work on together, so we should communicate more often.”

Li Zhouwei understood immediately.

‘So they don’t have absolute authority. Not only that, but they are lacking by a considerable margin… It seems the one valued by the Underworld is that Judge Yang, not the entire Yang family!’

Yang Ruiyi’s words were tactful. Saying they were “nothing compared to the Profound Governance Pavilion” was a veiled way of stating their position. The Yang Clan was analogous to the Profound Governance Pavilion; just as the Pavilion represented Luoxia’s will, the Yang Clan was merely an agent upholding the Underworld’s interests.

On the surface, this seemed standard, but the implications of this admission were significant.

‘People often say the Profound Governance Pavilion is Luoxia’s dog. A dog is still a dog. It can throw its weight around at the foot of the mountain, but it has no place at the summit. It can be ordered about at will but can never truly be a part of Luoxia… If the Yang Clan corresponds to the Profound Governance Pavilion, then that is not a comfortable position to be in!’

‘This is exactly why the Yue State fell into such a state back then!’

‘Besides the Profound Governance Pavilion, Luoxia also has the Seven Ministers. So, what other families serve the Underworld?’




# Chapter 1009: The Honored Position

‘I fear this is related to the old provincial boundaries…’

Li Ximing recalled when he first achieved the Purple Mansion Realm. The envoys who had visited him on the lake were Zhang Gui and Wang Long. The most distinguished purple-gold book they carried recorded their title: Envoy of the Five Directions for the Two Provinces of Jiao and Yang.

‘Zhang Gui and Wang Long must be Judge Yang’s men.’

He once had his doubts, but the matter had since become clear. When Li Ximing had his breakthrough, the Azure Pond was already in rapid decline. The Yang Clan, knowing the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition was fated to wane, must have worried that an unchecked Li Clan would eventually harm their interests.

By having those two envoys deliver the news that the Yang Clan also possessed a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Judge Yang accomplished two things. First, he stabilized the relationship between their families. Second, he preempted any potential future conflicts.

Beyond that, after a century in Jiangnan, the Li Clan had gathered a significant amount of intelligence. Another name was invariably linked to this Judge, Yang Jinxin.

The Zhenan Department.

According to hushed rumors, Judge Yang was the master of the Zhenan Department, responsible for handling the strange phenomena and residual Metallic Essence left behind when Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan fell. In the words of the rumors, he ‘presided over all matters of Metallic Essence related to divine abilities.’

‘I have no idea what rank a Department holds within the Underworld’s hierarchy, or what role it plays… but one thing is certain: it is a position of real power. Jiangnan is nothing more than a piece on their board.’

Regardless, the Yang Clan was far from a simple power. They certainly could not be described as ‘weak.’

“Your noble clan is descended from emperors, the most preeminent in all of Jiangnan. We could never hope to match you. And now, with the matter of seeking the truth… Daoist Friend, you are far too modest…”

Yang Ruiyi let out a hearty laugh before his expression turned serious. “To call us imperial descendants is an overstatement. There are few who could claim such a title in your presence, Daoist Friend.”

He spoke with genuine sincerity. Whatever Li Zhouwei’s current circumstances, given time, he was destined to become one of the world’s foremost masters of divine abilities. With Qilin blood flowing through his veins, no one could claim to be an imperial scion before him—unless, perhaps, the Zhaowu Emperor were resurrected, or the Zhao Son of Heaven in the imperial palace received a special blessing from the Fuqi Clan.

After the exchange of pleasantries, the old man who had been sitting quietly by the window vanished. Both Yang Ruiyi and Li Zhouwei heaved a deep, inward sigh of relief. The tense, rigid atmosphere immediately softened.

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, seizing the opportunity to ask thoughtfully, “I have heard… that the esteemed personage backing your clan is a figure from the Zhenan Department. I wonder, what kind of celestial department might that be?”

Yang Ruiyi’s attention had clearly been fixed on the old man. Despite being the host, he had been even more nervous than Li Zhouwei, terrified of misspeaking. With the old man gone, he seemed to come back to life. His tone relaxed as he leaned back in the host’s seat and smiled.

“My lord’s official post is not here, but in the Celestial Hall. Positions in the Hall are often titular, without active duties. He holds his post in the department concurrently as his active assignment, which is why the world has a name to call him by.”

He lifted his chin slightly and added casually, “After all, the Hall exists in the abyssal depths of the Underworld. One doesn’t typically use those Underworld titles.”

The terrifying image of the old man’s true form was seared into Li Zhouwei’s memory, though he dared not dwell on it. He simply nodded in understanding. Yang Ruiyi, however, said no more on the topic, offering only a perfunctory explanation. “The Zhenan Department has a long history. It was once responsible for this entire region. In these times of lapsed discipline, many departments have faded into obscurity, and their duties have been streamlined and absorbed by the Zhenan Department. Whether it’s the Northern River Department or the Ridge Pass Department, none can match the authority of Zhenan…”

Li Zhouwei could tell his words were insincere and that he was holding something back, so he simply remarked, “Truly a great figure of the Underworld!”

Yang Ruiyi smiled and swiftly changed the subject. “Since the White Qilin has graced us with his presence, I won’t waste time with pleasantries. The higher-ups value you greatly, Daoist Friend. They call you the nation’s greatest pillar. Your clan has also shown admirable prudence, which has earned their favor… The most important matter today is to settle this affair.”

Li Zhouwei looked at him, waiting.

Yang Ruiyi sighed. “If, for the sake of the Underworld, you are willing to lend your strength to our dynasty… the Yang Clan will naturally offer compensation!”

Li Zhouwei took a sip of tea, the answer already clear in his mind. “You want us to become subjects?”

For a moment, Yang Ruiyi was silent.

This was no simple matter. For the Chen Clan or the Lingu clan, bowing to the Yang Clan was inevitable; they had no standing to negotiate. The Li Clan was in a similar position. The compensation Yang Ruiyi mentioned was for Li Zhouwei personally.

Li Zhouwei cultivated the Bright Yang, an unyielding Daoist Tradition. This was less of a concern for ordinary practitioners, but as a favored son of the Bright Yang, his destiny was extraordinary. Since his birth, the Li Clan had forgone his given name, calling him ‘Young Lord’ and permitting him to abstain from bowing and kneeling, all to preserve the integrity of his fate.

Now, with his mind set on attaining Fruition, to serve another as a subject, while seemingly trivial, would undoubtedly hinder his attempt to reach that state.

‘Li Zhouwei is, after all, a child of the Bright Yang. Even if he swallows his pride while in a subordinate position, his ambition will remain. He will certainly seize the opportunity presented by the world’s current state to strive for Fruition Attainment.’

To sever another’s path in cultivation was an offense that created blood feuds. Obstructing someone’s pursuit of the golden core or placing stumbling blocks on their path to Fruition Attainment was an act that bred immense hatred. How could Yang Ruiyi not be cautious?

‘What’s more, my clan stands to gain from this.’

The same principle applied to Yang Zhuo’s faction. Li Zhouwei’s status and destiny were unique. If he were to bow to Yang Zhuo, it would not only be a great boon to the new dynasty the Yangs were establishing, but it would also elevate Yang Zhuo’s own destiny.

Aware of these concerns, Yang Ruiyi carefully watched his expression. But Li Zhouwei remained silent, his golden eyes fixed on him, seemingly waiting for him to continue.

Their gazes met for only a brief moment before Yang Ruiyi smiled and explained,

“The White Qilin need not worry. We will fully support your endeavor to reach the True Monarch realm. This matter is not so severe… We will do everything in our power to minimize the impact.”

“After all… the new dynasty will not govern harshly. The Chen and Lingu Clans are to be vassal lords. They will be granted titles of nobility and retain their county lands as fiefdoms. Though they must obey our summons, their fiefs will remain self-governing. And for the Li Clan… the terms will be even more lenient.”

He beamed. “We will do our utmost to preserve your status and ensure the White Qilin is satisfied!”

Li Zhouwei was not surprised. In truth, neither the Yang Clan nor the Li Clan was. This matter was non-negotiable. The fact that three generations of Li clansmen—Li Xizhi, Zhouluo, and Li Jiangliang—had been drawn into this scheme was a clear signal.

‘The Li Clan must be a part of the Yang Clan’s grand design. The subtle protection and aid they offered my predecessors were calculated moves, each with a price tag. Whether the price is fair or not, whether the Li Clan is willing or not, the time has come to pay.’

His words also revealed another truth: the Underworld’s position on Li Qianyuan was similar to Luoxia’s. A dead, or at least half-dead, Li Qianyuan was what the Underworld wished to see. Hence the offer of ‘full support.’

‘This is why Luoxia has never cared. The Li Clan exists within the Underworld’s domain, so even if Luoxia did nothing, the Underworld would naturally keep watch… They are in no rush to break my destiny… in fact, they seem intent on helping me fulfill it.’

‘The attitude of the world’s foremost powers… this final piece of the puzzle has fallen into place. This father of mine, this Monarch of Bright Yang… has united Luoxia and the Underworld against him, with the Dragon-kin reluctantly playing along…’

He remembered when Qingyu Qian had invited him to the mountains and personally explained the Wei-Li affair, saying that Li Qianyuan had irreconcilable conflicts with half of the world’s Daoist Traditions. Looking back now, ‘half’ seemed a conservative estimate beyond measure. Perhaps the remaining traditions weren’t in irreconcilable conflict, but they surely did not wish to see him succeed…

Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes watched him quietly. “The Li Clan is indebted to the honorable predecessors of the celestial authorities,” he said softly. “We will naturally do our part.”

Yang Ruiyi smiled faintly. “There is one other matter… concerning the Great Virtue Golden Lotus.”

“The Great Virtue Golden Lotus…” Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. “Has Lord Yang not retaken Quanwu? Is this something he cannot resolve?”

A trace of helplessness crossed Yang Ruiyi’s face. “The Great Virtue Golden Lotus itself is not the problem. The trouble lies with the countless cultivators and commoners affected by it, who are spread throughout Lixia and Quanwu. If the lotuses are destroyed, I fear a million corpses will pave the ground.”

Li Zhouwei was inwardly skeptical but feigned a look of sudden realization, nodding slowly as Yang Ruiyi continued, shaking his head. “Fortunately, my lord is a being of divine birth and has miraculous methods at his disposal. The gentlest and most convenient solution is to seal the Great Virtue Golden Lotus and neutralize its influence. It will dissipate on its own within eight or ten years.”

“We have all the lotuses under observation, except for… two of them in the Wilderness. Those are proving difficult to handle.”

Li Zhouwei understood immediately. Yang Ruiyi was talking about the _Great Virtue Golden Lotus_, but he was really talking about the handover and division of the Wilderness. He set down his cup. “What is your clan’s position on this?”

Yang Ruiyi said simply, “My lord’s intention… is for the Wilderness to remain in our hands for the time being. Once everything is settled, it will be delivered to your clan through other means.”

The personnel losses in the Wilderness had been far less than anticipated, but the _Great Virtue Golden Lotus_ had already poisoned the land. Furthermore, it was an artifact from the Buddhist Land and was difficult to deal with. If the Li Clan took it now, they would have no way to handle it for some time. Entrusting it to the Yang Clan would save them a great deal of trouble.

‘“Other means” can only mean enfeoffment or a royal grant…’

Li Zhouwei nodded. “We will have to trouble your clan, then.”

Yang Ruiyi smiled. “It is no trouble at all. I should be the one thanking your clan for your trust.”

With the major issues settled, Li Zhouwei’s expression finally turned serious.

“My clan still has two members to consider… one is my younger clan-brother, Zhouluo, who received a reward from your lord. The other is my elder, Li Yuanqin, who cultivates at the Azure Pond… How does your clan intend to handle them?”

Li Xuanxuan had long pondered this, and now that Li Zhouwei was face-to-face with Yang Ruiyi, he had to ask for details.

Yang Ruiyi gave him a surprised look, his smile vanishing. “Zhouluo… has Yang blood, after all. He will be safe with our Yang Clan, and we need not worry about anyone using him to manipulate relations between our two families. This is what is best for him, and for both of us.”

Li Zhouwei gave him a heavy look. Yang Ruiyi added with a smile, “But… there’s no need to settle it here. Once the new dynasty is established, he will have the freedom to choose. We need only wait.”

He seemed very confident as he met Li Zhouwei’s gaze. “As for Li Yuanqin… the Ning Clan will be garrisoning Yi Mountain City and the Southern Borderlands on my lord’s behalf. This is Ning Wan’s reward. If the Li Clan truly has need of him, you need only ask the Ning Clan. I am certain Ning Wan will not refuse.”

“However…” He chuckled. “In my view… now that a branch of your family has finally made its way out, it might be a good thing for them not to return to the lake.”

Li Zhouwei watched him thoughtfully. ‘A reward… so Ning Wan still has leverage…’

Since both men were acting in the interests of their respective clans, there was little more to discuss. Yang Ruiyi raised his teacup, signaling the end of the meeting.

“Daoist Friend, you need only wait. It will be a matter of a few years. On the day the stars appear in the heavens, shining without cease, turning night into day—that will be the day the Feng Wu nation is founded. Golden chariots and jade carriages will come to the lake to confer upon you an honored position!”

With that, he personally rose from his seat to see the golden-eyed young man out, taking a step forward to push open the pavilion door himself.

_Creak._

The gentle morning light spilled into the room, illuminating the stone steps one by one. A cool wind blew, but a figure was already waiting outside.

The man was handsome, with flashing golden eyes. He wore a long robe with a swirling cloud pattern, covered by a brocade robe with motifs of paired beasts—a remarkably elegant attire that gave him the air of a scholar-general.

The moment the door opened, he bowed deeply. “Greetings, my lord… Greetings… Father!”

Li Zhouwei stood at the entrance, bathed in the brilliant sunlight, his hands clasped behind his back. Yang Ruiyi’s laughter echoed outside the pavilion. “The Fourth Young Master’s immortal merits are outstanding. My lord has mentioned him often. Truly, like father, like son!”

Li Jiangliang remained bowed before the pavilion, his expression unmoved by the praise. He waited cautiously until he heard his father’s voice. “Daoist Friend, you flatter him.”

With a complex feeling in his heart, Li Jiangliang lifted his head slightly and moved to the side, seeing only two sets of robes appear before him. The man in black smiled. “I will not intrude any longer.”

His figure vanished in an instant, wiped clean from existence as if he had never been there, leaving only the golden-eyed young man standing silently in his place. Li Jiangliang raised his gaze a few more inches. “Father.”

“Walk with me.”

“Yes.”

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and began to stroll along the corridor connecting the pavilions. Li Jiangliang followed in his footsteps.

“What are your duties in the court?” Li Zhouwei asked. “What position do you hold?”

Li Jiangliang answered quickly, “Your son is currently formulating the rites for the new dynasty. Once the great affair is settled, I expect to be managing matters of the people’s livelihood.”

Li Zhouwei stopped and turned to study him for a moment. “You are quite different from your brothers. Cui Jueyin taught you for over a decade, and you took it all to heart. You have not disgraced our family’s teachings.”

Li Jiangliang had never expected such words from his father. He was stunned for a moment, and only after a few silent breaths did it sink in. “Father… Thank you, Father.”

Li Zhouwei turned to look at the clouds beyond the corridor, resting a hand on the white stone railing. “That day, when your eldest brother returned from the Mushroom Forest Plains, I heard what you said,” he stated calmly. “You said you would rather die than touch a single thing belonging to the family…”

Li Jiangliang stood beside him, a complicated expression on his face as he looked into his father’s golden eyes.

But his father’s tone softened. “In truth, you know it doesn’t matter whether you use the family’s power or not. The day you are truly helpless and must use it, it will be an unavoidable necessity. There is no need for such a venomous oath…”

Li Jiangliang lowered his gaze and suddenly fell to his knees. But Li Zhouwei’s voice grew distant, fading until it echoed only in his mind.

‘Staying by the Yang Clan’s side may offer you more opportunities.’

# Chapter 1010: Profound Incense

Heavenly Light flickered over Gardenia Scenery Mountain. A Daoist Master in platinum-white robes sat at the head of the table amidst billowing white flowers. Opposite him, a middle-aged man in azure robes sat in silence, his hand resting on his cup.

"Daoist Friend Qinghu, you seem to be in high spirits."

Li Ximing, occupying the host's seat, watched him with a smile, though he sighed inwardly.

'A far cry from the man who fled Moongaze in such a hurry not long ago. He’s so calm and composed now. He must have secured the backing of the Underworld.'

It was quite the coincidence. Si Yuanli had arrived here less than an hour after Li Zhouwei departed from Moongaze Lake. Li Ximing simply waited for him to speak first.

Si Yuanli returned the smile, clearly in a good mood, though his tone was self-deprecating.

"You’re too kind, Zhaojing. It’s not that I’m at ease, it’s that I don’t even have a sect gate to return to. With nowhere else to go, I thought I’d take a stroll by the lake…"

His words made Li Ximing set down his cup. "A sect gate?" he chuckled. "Why would you be worried about that? Your skills are impressive, my friend."

Si Yuanli’s sect had always been the Azure Pond Sect; where else could it be? By claiming to have no sect gate, he was hinting that he had already pledged allegiance to the Yang Clan and would not have to enter the Pristine Merging Owl Pool!

This was clearly good news, and Li Ximing’s playful jab was exactly what Si Yuanli wanted to hear. He stroked his beard and laughed.

"I'll take that as a blessing… As for my skills…"

He let out a soft sigh.

"This has nothing to do with skill. It is an inheritance from my predecessors. Every sip, every peck—it was all fated long ago."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"And what of Daoist Friend Ning Wan?"

At the mention of Ning Wan, a flash of admiration crossed Si Yuanli’s face.

"She has found her own path as well. Senior Yuansu made arrangements for her. While it may not guarantee her survival, if she can hold on until the day the new dynasty is established, her crisis will immediately be resolved…"

Li Ximing was a little surprised but also relieved. Si Yuanli then changed the subject with a smile.

"I saw Si Xunhui a few days ago and asked about his situation. Now that Jiangnan is gradually being pacified, he intends to return to the Yue State to serve. I was wondering… what are the arrangements for Li Queyi?"

It was a natural course of action. The Si family was short on talent, and while Si Tongyi was capable, his innate aptitude was lacking. Si Xunhui was their only truly outstanding figure; his noble birth and the fact that his master's wife was from the Yang family meant there was no reason for him not to return.

The Li family, however, was in a different position. Li Ximing currently had a good relationship with Kuang Yu and intended to grow closer to the circle of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the southeastern seas. Furthermore, the Li family's standing was not the same as the Si family's. He had no intention of calling her back.

"That boy Si Xunhui has profound fortune. His return is a good thing, of course," Li Ximing sighed. "But Queyi is highly regarded by Kuang Yu. There isn't really a place for her if she comes back. We elders shouldn't put her in a difficult position."

Si Yuanli understood perfectly.

'‘Not making things difficult for _her_?’ he thought. ‘More like not making things difficult for _you_, Zhaojing.’'

He nodded.

"Although they'll have to live apart, it’s for the best if they each have their own path of development. The Yang Clan bestows its grace far and wide, paying particular attention to the southern and eastern seas. There will be opportunities for them to connect in the future."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing smiled.

"And how are they showing this favor?"

Si Yuanli paused, running through the details in his mind. Concluding it wasn't a great secret, he shook his head and said:

"It concerns Shitang… The Azure Pond Sect has been left a sliver of hope. The reason it hasn't been forced to close is because of Shitang. Once Daoist Master Zhusheng’s matter is settled, the Southern Sea is bound to see some changes."

The mention of Daoist Master Zhusheng of the Southern Sea made everything click for Li Ximing. During the conflict over the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, Daoist Master Suiguan had specifically asked Ning Wan to lure him to Jiangbei to get him deeply involved. Once the Underworld secured this powerful figure, the matter of Shitang would be much easier to handle!

Li Ximing nodded, his expression unchanged, but Si Yuanli was inwardly celebrating.

'Good thing I was decisive and settled Si Xunhui’s future early on. I can be much more open about things now. Once news from Simin Prefecture gets out, Chen Yin will definitely come seeking connections.'

'And the Li family has always been strict about its bloodline. They're obviously holding on to Li Queyi. If they have to choose a significant figure from their clan for a marriage alliance, they might have to marry a daughter to a son of Bright Yang… That will be a real headache for him!'

Li Zhouwei was impressive, but his future was uncertain. Marrying a daughter to a son of Bright Yang might not be a blessing. At this thought, Si Yuanli felt a surge of satisfaction and smiled.

"The new dynasty is about to be established, and with it, a new political order… This dynasty will be founded on True Qi… and the path of True Qi enhances one's cultivation and empowers divine abilities. Securing a few official positions for the younger generation would likely be of great benefit to their practice!"

"What are your thoughts on this, my friend?"

Li Ximing understood his meaning perfectly, but while he was interested, he wasn't overly enthusiastic.

'The core disciples of my family all possess a Talisman Seed. Firstly, there's no need to send them into the court. Secondly, I don't know what the consequences would be. At most, I might send three or five talented disciples who haven't received a Talisman Seed to Simin to try their luck.'

He deliberately avoided taking the bait and chuckled.

"We all have our own circumstances. We're one family, after all. With harmony among us Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, there can be no major disputes among those below."

Si Yuanli shook his head with a sigh.

"You can't be so sure. We’re all friendly now, but who knows what the future holds? Even if the Purple Mansion Realm masters are harmonious, it's not unheard of for the younger generation to compete for their own interests…"

"It's just a shame my clan's descendants are so disappointing. We sent so many of our children in, but in the end, only Tongyi managed to contribute, and only because of his connections in the immortal sect… I can’t compare to you… But if there’s a need for assistance in the future, I may have to ask for your help…"

Li Ximing had no desire to get entangled in the Si family’s affairs. With Li Zhouwei not yet back, he couldn't even gauge his own family's standing in the new dynasty. He just shook his head and sighed.

"That’s hard to say… Jiangliang is not one to think of family. Given the current situation, who would he dare to side with? He’s the only one from my family who went, so we don't have much influence. I can’t really ask anything of him now."

"Besides…"

He smiled and retorted:

"Aren't all his subordinates your people?"

Si Yuanli gave an awkward laugh and quickly changed the subject.

"I came here this time… with another matter to ask you about…"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow as Si Yuanli continued with a smile.

"An elder in my family has an old friend named Ping Yan who cultivates on Yinzhou Island. Recently, he received a request. I hear it came from a dignitary at the Lotus Temple, who asked me to act as a go-between to trade for a treasure from your esteemed clan."

Li Ximing was somewhat surprised, but a hint of delight emerged. He asked:

"Could it be Great Master Minghui?"

That Minghui was as fickle as the weather. The Lotus Temple was also the Buddhist lineage most deeply entangled with immortal cultivators, having acted as a broker in several collaborations between the two factions. Li Ximing had met him once before, regarding a trade for several Enlightened Artifacts the Li family had seized.

But later, as the conflict between north and south intensified, the Chengyun Gate—their only link to Minghui—was relocated deep into the northern territories, and they lost contact. He never expected the monk to be resourceful enough to find his way to Si Yuanli.

As expected, Si Yuanli nodded with a smile.

"Precisely! I imagine you already anticipated this!"

Li Ximing nodded slightly, but his expression grew contemplative.

"I heard that Yinzhou Island is the heartland of the Dragon-kin. Daoist Master Ping Yan must have close ties with them. How is it that he's able to connect with Buddhist cultivators?"

The Dragon-kin had a tense relationship with Luoxia and were not on good terms with the Seven Phases either. The Buddhists often converted demon beasts, which frequently offended the Dragon-kin. Some even coveted the descendants of the Demon Monarch… which earned them the Dragons' utter loathing.

Li Ximing’s question was not surprising to Si Yuanli, who smiled and explained:

"The Dragon-kin are domineering, it’s true, but they still need someone to mediate for them. Some things can't be solved with brute force but can be achieved through diplomacy. Daoist Master Ping Yan cultivates on Yinzhou Island and has a wide network of friends, with connections to all sorts of paths."

A hint of wistfulness, even envy, colored his tone.

"Riding the coattails of the Dragons' might, that senior has made a fortune…"

Li Ximing now understood the situation, but his distrust of Buddhist cultivators remained. He paused for a moment, then frowned.

"Did this Merciful One mention anything specific?"

Si Yuanli quickly replied:

"That I cannot say… It's not appropriate for me to be the middleman here. I am only relaying the message. I've heard that Daoist Master Minghuang has a friendship with a certain Dragon Prince. It shouldn't be difficult to find the right person to arrange this matter!"

His caution was not unfounded. Li Ximing agreed. Only then did Si Yuanli smile, take a jade box from his sleeve, and place it gently on the table.

"I heard you have a Rising Warmth Stone in your possession?"

Li Ximing nodded.

When Wanling Heaven manifested back then, the Li family disciples who entered had reaped a significant harvest. Aside from a few pills, they had obtained the Heart-Taste Baleful Qi of Merging Fire and the Rising Warmth Stone of Blazing Fire.

Si Yuanli smiled.

"Blazing Fire can pacify dampness and dispel rain, rectifying Upright Wood Qi. I wish to cultivate a divine ability called 'Journeying North.' Blazing Fire's ability to pacify dampness and dispel rain is of great benefit. The master of the Tree of One Heart is also in the north, so it would be highly advantageous. Thus, I would like to borrow your Rising Warmth Stone."

Traces of the Blazing Fire lineage were rare. Si Yuanli, true to his family's deep-seated knowledge, understood it well. Li Ximing nodded in silent approval.

"That is correct. Blazing Fire resides in the north, which aligns perfectly with Journeying North. You have a profound grasp of Daoist calculations."

Si Yuanli laughed heartily and pushed the jade box forward.

"The item you mentioned last time… the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill!"

Li Ximing’s eyes lit up. He took the box and opened it. Inside, a wondrous light glowed, guiding one's divine abilities with the marvel of blossoming True Qi. He smiled.

"Aren't I taking advantage of you?"

Both the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill and the Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill were spirit pills famed throughout the world from the ancient Four Secret Dao Lineages. However, the former enhanced divine abilities, making it slightly more valuable. But Si Yuanli demurred.

"You are too kind."

He took the Rising Warmth Stone from Li Ximing's hand and examined it with satisfaction. After taking a small sip of tea, he prepared to stand and take his leave.

"About that matter of the spirit incense…"

"Oh!"

Li Zhouwei had obtained eight golden-veined profound incenses from a grotto-heaven but didn't know their use. Li Ximing had asked Si Yuanli to inquire about them long ago. Now that there was news, he looked up with great interest as Si Yuanli spoke with a smile.

"I asked around for you, and in the end, the only news came from the Peacock Sea! The great personage there has a set as well, though slightly different from yours. It’s called the 'Four Secret Terraces Profound Incense'."

His expression turned serious.

"The Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition, which styles itself Heaven–Governing, often manages incense offerings and rituals. While these things are not common, traces of them can still be found. Your set should have its own name within the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition, but the root is the same. It is a profound incense condensed from incense fire."

"Condensed from incense fire?"

A strange feeling stirred in Li Ximing's heart, but he maintained a thoughtful expression and sighed.

"The way of incense fire is no longer prominent, and the path of ritual has fallen into disuse. They are now mere ceremonies to mourn our predecessors. Does it still have any use?"

"It does!"

Si Yuanli’s tone was firm.

"An ordinary person would have no use for it, but don't forget the north. Don't underestimate this small item. In the eyes of the monks, it's a precious treasure—priceless and unobtainable even with spirit resources!"

Li Ximing nodded, and Si Yuanli smiled.

"Furthermore… some ancient incense-fire artifacts, or some lost secret arts, or a certain lineage of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition… they can all make use of this. The more complete a set from a single source, the better. If you have enough, say one or two hundred sticks, you could even use it to bribe the officials of the netherworld."

He smiled mysteriously.

"Matters of the netherworld can never be neglected… but that doesn't mean they can't be."

The "netherworld" he spoke of was, of course, the Underworld.

Reincarnation was difficult for cultivators. But in theory, if a person's divine abilities were perfected, all five methods were complete, and they had the ability to condense Metallic Essence, the threshold for reincarnation would be significantly lowered. The main consideration then became the Underworld—after all, it encroached upon their interests.

Jiang Boqing, who had caused such a stir in the Yue State back then, was a man of extremely high Dao-Profundity. He had bribed the Underworld and lived freely in Yue State for a time, but was eventually executed due to his connection with the Immortal Scripture.

'Incense fire…'

After pondering for a moment, Li Ximing rose to see him out, remarking casually with a smile:

"One or two hundred sticks? I'm afraid you could empty out all of Wanling Heaven and not find a hundred, let alone a complete set…"

Si Yuanli, who knew a fair bit about Wanling Heaven, nodded in agreement.

'Each ritual site has eight sticks at most, and many were lost in the chaos… having two or three in hand… could be useful for a trade.'

Li Ximing walked him all the way out. Upon returning to the mountain, he opened the jade box again. Seeing the True Qi brimming within and the interplay of multicolored light, he felt a stir in his heart.

'Spirit pills that can help perfect a divine ability are rare. It’s a pity this is for someone from the Southern Sea. Otherwise, with this pill, I would have had a great chance of achieving 'World's Radiance'!'

His first attempt at cultivating 'World's Radiance' had failed. Fortunately, the Li family was lavish in its spending on enhancing divine abilities, providing a full supply of pills every year. Now that he had formed his immortal foundation, he was just waiting to slowly bring it to perfection.

"There's also that 'Upper Shaman' spirit embryo, which I've had for more than ten years. But more important is the spirit armor. I must press for an answer on that."

Refining a spirit embryo was a troublesome task; ten or twenty years was the norm. The Li family, with the Viewing Pavilion's refining methods and their willingness to spare no expense, was much faster. He immediately sent a messenger to Qize.

He settled back into his seat and closed his eyes to cultivate. After only a moment, a brilliant light flashed and converged on the mountain, revealing a youth with golden eyes.

"Minghuang!"

Li Ximing, who had been waiting anxiously, hurried down to meet him.

"How did it go?"

Li Zhouwei smiled at him reassuringly.

"Things are not so bad… Grand-uncle, please rest assured!"

Those words were all Li Ximing needed to feel at ease. He pulled him to sit at the table and sighed.

"Si Yuanli was here earlier. He was beating around the bush, trying to get our family to promise to help him… I suspect… the Yang Clan gave them a good offer. Ours should be more valuable…"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"A kingship."

A shadow of deep thought seemed to flicker in his eyes. He briefly recounted his discussion with the Yang Clan, omitting many details, and then walked with Li Ximing towards the center of the island, sighing softly.

"The Senior from the Celestial Office holds our ancestor in high regard, lamenting that of four, three were obtained—a rare feat indeed!"

# Chapter 1011: The White Qilin

Within the secret formation, shifting colors pulsed and overlapped. A hazy purple light filled the Celestial Hall, making the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda shine with extraordinary brilliance. Li Ximing listened intently until the words ended, then fell silent.

"The new dynasty has granted the rank of king to all the Immortal Clans, but these are empty titles. Only our family holds both the name and the substance. It is settled—you must ascend to the Bright Yang throne."

The young man with golden eyes stood with his hands clasped behind his back, pacing the hall. His thoughts were inscrutable. After a long wait, Li Ximing’s somber voice broke the silence.

"The Underworld also wants you to seek this path... Is there any room for refusal?"

Li Zhouwei looked at him, his expression as cold as ice. "Attaining it is now inevitable," he said softly.

Li Ximing nodded, a flicker of agitation crossing his face. He paced a few steps, his brow furrowed, before replying.

"I don't care what kind of figure Li Qianyuan was! Even if I know nothing of ancient history, our dao lineage is here now, and that should give us some right to speak! You're to seek the Bright Yang... Fine... They want you to seek it, so they grant you a kingdom... a kingdom of a single lake! In ancient times, that wouldn't even be considered a large fiefdom!"

Li Ximing was usually a calm man. Even when pursued and gravely injured years ago, he had only managed a wry smile before finding a place to heal. He never spoke of it. But after holding it in for so long, now in a place of safety, he could no longer contain his frustration. He seemed almost feral as he spoke through gritted teeth, "The Wei Emperor... That was the Wei Emperor, a figure who ranked among the top True Monarchs, an Imperial Monarch! In terms of national fortune, his was the number one celestial dynasty of the north. In Dao-Profundity, he was a man approaching the Dao Embryo. And in status, he shattered kingdoms and destroyed sects, setting the principles for the mortal realm that kept the Bright Yang's gaze fixed for a thousand years..."

"If you were given a celestial dynasty, half the world, then I'd have faith you might succeed! But now... a kingdom of a lake is one thing, but they also demand you declare yourself a subject! They want a son to replace the father—what a joke! They demand you bow to True Qi, so what right would you have to look up to Li Qianyuan? How is that any different from sending you to your death?"

"From the very beginning! From the very beginning, they have never given you a path to survival!"

The Daoist had clearly lost his composure. "I understand, of course," he seethed, "that you achieving Bright Yang is our best option. But why have we been desperately seeking an escape route? Because it's utterly impossible... Luoxia is confident, the whole world is confident..."

"And now this. Not a single escape route left. Since you've decided to strive for Bright Yang, how will you deal with the Dragon-kin?! Are the Dragon-kin to be trifled with? The Qunyi Archipelago is in the Eastern Sea!"

His divine ability flared with his rage, and every lamp in the Celestial Hall went dark. The purple glow from outside dimmed, and all light vanished. In the darkness, only a pair of golden eyes faintly gleamed. The pupils had transformed into golden-white rings, staring at the floor, their usual tranquility replaced by a deep, ruthless venom.

"Grand-uncle, do not dwell on it."

His voice, however, was unnervingly calm, a distorted tone echoing in the air.

"They want me to seek Fruition Attainment, so they must guide me step-by-step toward the perfection of my divine ability. Let them see our family's grievance for now. I am a pawn, yes, but once I achieve the Great Accomplishment of Bright Yang, the meaning of this pawn will be entirely different."

Li Ximing started to speak, then stopped. The light in the Celestial Hall flickered, bright one moment and dim the next. The White Qilin continued as if talking to himself.

"I will endure for another decade or two. Once my divine ability is perfected, I will have my own ways of influencing the situation. But for now, I must gather my strength. I cannot be injured, my cultivation cannot stagnate. I must shatter mountains and raze temples, slaughter Buddhists and butcher demons. Only by bowing to True Qi first will I have the backing to nourish my Talisman Qi with a sea of blood and the chance to accumulate power..."

"When I achieve the Great Accomplishment of Bright Yang, even if I lash out and take a bite or two out of him, he will have to endure it unless he sends a True Monarch after me... Even if I am to die seeking the Bright Yang, I will make him feel the pain of my fangs before I fall..."

"Besides..."

For the first time, he revealed his innermost thoughts. His eyes, now like golden-white rings, turned to Li Ximing, sending a chill down his spine.

"Submitting today does not mean I will submit forever. The ropes from the heavens are not unbreakable. If one day I turn on him, shatter his five fingers, and ruin this grand game, even the Bright Yang will have no choice but to look at me in a new light."

The words were like a bucket of cold water, extinguishing the flames of anger in the Daoist's heart. He was stunned, seemingly at a loss.

'Then... what will be the price?'

In truth, Li Ximing had regretted his words the moment they left his mouth. Seeing the distant, unguarded look in his junior's eyes, the unease in his heart grew heavier.

Li Zhouwei had shown little emotion since childhood. In contrast, Li Jiangqian's darkness and venom were easier to read on the surface. But when all the light had faded, that unintentional glance was like a handful of needles piercing Li Ximing's eyes. It suddenly reminded him of something.

Years ago, in the Wilderness with Tianwan, Li Zhouwei had worn that same expression. The words still echoed in his ears:

'To die for me, is that not as it should be?'

His lapse in attention caused the eyes to immediately retract their emotion. The White Qilin ascended the steps, one by one, his voice low. "As for today's matter... I have pondered it for a long time."

"The way of True Qi is righteous and restrains promiscuity; its benevolence and might are boundless. But what if there is a Daoist Tradition, an orthodox immortal cultivation lineage with a path of righteous Upper Rite, whose master has vanished and secretly sided with the north? If it fails to restrain promiscuity and its violence is not benevolent, would that not be a predicament?"

"This place is barely a hundred miles from where that lord began his rise. It is precisely because of this predicament that when he swept through the Yue State, he conveniently missed this one spot. It is a situation that requires a change."

The royal battle-axe hanging inverted at his waist shimmered. "That lord is currently stabilizing the situation, restraining promiscuity, and pursuing the Way of Great Desire, abolishing profane shrines from one land to the next as he presses north. The Way of Great Desire will suffer losses, but the lord's hands will also be tied... Perhaps I should help him."

"And avenge our flight east across the sea."

Li Ximing's eyebrows shot up. He looked at him in disbelief as the White Qilin continued, "Daoist Master Qinghu came to our gate with purpose. We might as well ask him if Helin Prefecture, the mountains of Changxiao, are to his liking."

A small, ironic smile touched his lips. "But... Grand-uncle, why don't you guess whether Daoist Master Qinghu has gone far? Or might he be waiting nearby in the Great Void?"

The pieces clicked into place for the Daoist. He stood up, listening to the young man's somber words. "Our family has no other path... Grand-uncle... our hands cannot remain clean. If we lack the will to control the grand tide of events, we can only be dominated by it..."

Those golden-white, ring-like eyes still gleamed. The White Qilin smiled faintly, revealing sharp, fine teeth.

"You also know... when the great lord made the Bright Yang turn its gaze upon me, it was not so a White Qilin could have a pointless reincarnation."

---

The stone chamber was thick with spiritual energy. The faint white glow from a lampstand spilled onto the meditation couch, illuminating an overturned, empty jade vial beside it. The youth exhaled a soft white breath and his eyes snapped open.

A dharma power completely different from his previous life flowed through his body. He raised an eyebrow, savoring the sensation.

The Great Void Revolution Art had achieved the Divine Sequence. It was clearly of the Heaven–Governing dao lineage, possessing the same domineering aura of 'I am the Heavenly Law' as Encompassing Profoundity. Although his immortal foundation was not yet established and its effects were subtle, the means were already there.

'The Great Void Revolution Art forms a 'void core' in my sea of qi. With daily nourishment, it can supplement my dharma power in battle... A pity I haven't reached the Foundation Establishment Realm yet; its wonders are limited...'

Li Suining gently raised his hand. A pale silver glow of dharma power bloomed in his palm and then subsided as he waved his arm. From his sleeve, he produced twelve formation flags, purple with star-like specks!

The twelve Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags converged and scattered in the air, their colors shifting as they descended. At one moment they took the form of rain clouds, unleashing thunder; the next, they became iron chains stretching across the sky, sealing off spiritual energy.

The flags shifted through thirty-two different formations, each one overlapping the last before returning to his sleeve. After running through the formations most familiar from his past life, Li Suining's eyes shone with understanding.

'My previous life was also of the Heaven–Governing lineage, which has a natural affinity for thunder. But compared to the Profound Dipper's Balance, this life's Divine Sequence is clearly much closer to the way of Profound Thunder!'

'However, in terms of sealing teleportation and drawing upon the Great Void for transformations, it's more versatile. I fear it might conflict with the path of Cultivation Transcendence...'

As a formations master, his sensitivity to the nuances of dao lineages was the highest among all crafters. Coupled with his high Dao-Profundity in the Heaven–Governing path and Daoist Master Yuanbian's Sutra of Profound Iteration, this perception was not difficult for him.

All of this was within his expectations. What truly surprised and delighted Li Suining was something else.

'In terms of dharma power quality, this Great Void Revolution Art... is in no way inferior to the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court from my past life! And it's far superior to the Art of the Golden Tablet that I practiced before I switched cultivation paths!'

An ordinary Qi Refining cultivator would never have noticed this. But having practiced both techniques across two lifetimes, his understanding was profound. He lowered his head, lost in thought, a deep joy welling within him.

"Even though the Great Void Revolution Art has no clear path forward, its quality is exceptional..."

This was undoubtedly excellent news. He no longer held any hope of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, but the more brilliantly he performed during the Foundation Establishment Realm, the more he would be valued. The stronger he was, the more he could change!

Beaming, he scanned his cavern-residence, gathered his belongings, and swept open the stone door with a flick of his sleeve. He strode out into the blinding sunlight, his mind already racing.

'The Way of Great Desire came down from the Wilderness... I wonder if the Daoist Master was injured, and how he is now... Injuries at the Purple Mansion Realm level are always kept secret. I can't ask, and I wouldn't find out even if I did...'

He looked up and saw a white-haired old man sitting cross-legged, guarding the entrance to his residence. It was Du Dou, a servant sent by the family.

Seeing Li Suining, Du Dou was overjoyed and rose to congratulate him. The youth smiled and stopped him, in no mood for celebration, and eagerly asked about family matters.

"How long was I in seclusion?"

Du Dou bowed hastily. "Reporting to Young Master, only six months."

Li Suining's thoughts stirred.

He was, after all, a cultivator of two lifetimes. The process was familiar and came naturally. Taking the pills, perfecting six cycles of Embyronic Breathing, and adjusting his qi had not taken much time. He breathed a sigh of relief.

'It's still early. Perhaps the Song Emperor has only just reached the Wilderness... and the karma-fire hasn't caused too many deaths yet... But the signs are all there. The great chaos is about to begin...'

The founding of the Great Song dynasty and the sweeping of the Yue lands involved more than just a few divine ability duels. It was just that the losses weren't catastrophic, so it didn't draw much attention. He had been in seclusion in his past life and didn't know much about it. Thinking back now, he mused:

'One battle subdued all four corners. Crimson Reef Island and Changxiao Gate were both battered. On the northern front our family was defending, Changxiao Gate's mainland territory was even breached by the Chen family. After all... they needed to offer a token of allegiance, and the enmity between the Chen family and Changxiao ran so deep...'

He narrowed his eyes, his heart sinking. 'And then there's Daoist Master Hansui. The master of Changxiao stationed him in Zhulu for many years. The mainland was just a burden, and in the end, it only added fuel to the fire...'

Lost in thought, Li Suining descended from the tower. As he reached the bottom of a pavilion and was about to go up, he suddenly raised his head and looked closely, noticing the master of the house was not present. Only then did he ask, 

"Strange... is the old master on the island?"

"This subordinate does not know..."

Du Dou's status was low; such information was indeed beyond him. Li Suining instructed, "Old Du, my breakthrough is complete. I should report to the old master. Go and ask around for me, find out when he is available, so I may pay my respects!"

Du Dou hurried off. Having sent him away, Li Suining made his way through the island, soon arriving at a quiet and peaceful place. The grass was fragrant and lush, a waterfall thundered nearby, and the sound of a sword's hum could be heard. As Li Suining walked deeper, he felt a sharp aura wash over him. Fearing he might be hurt by it, he called out urgently, "Youngest Uncle! Suining is here!"

Instantly, a great clanging sound erupted. The sword qi that had been weaving like moonlight above the waterfall plummeted, converging like a downpour toward the center of the lake. It materialized into a dharma sword shimmering with lunar brilliance and landed in the hand of a white-robed youth.

"Clang!"

The longsword slid into its sheath. Li Jiangchun raised his eyebrows in mild surprise, then smiled at him. "Congratulations, Suining!"

Li Suining took a step back and bowed. "Excellent swordsmanship, Youngest Uncle!" he said with a smile.

The white-robed man descended on the wind, landing before him. He shook his head and laughed. "Come..."

The two were taking their seats at a stone table by the lake when Li Jiangchun suddenly looked up at the sky. Beams of escaping light flashed one after another. He frowned. "Strange... why is there so much movement today..."

How could Li Suining not be sensitive to this? He raised his eyes, and his heart skipped a beat. A Heart-Piercing chill washed over him. He was about to stand when a sheet of apricot-red flame descended from the sky, landing abruptly by the lake's edge with a searing glow!

As the flame touched the ground, a wave of intense heat blasted them, forcing Li Suining to shield his eyes. He saw the Li Fire coalesce and manifest, transforming into a young man in crimson robes.

The man was handsome and slender. His eyes were filled with a grave, cold aura. Those golden eyes were piercingly bright. Merely by standing there, his peak Foundation Establishment Realm aura settled the entire lake, and the oppressive might of Li Fire spread out.

Li Suining stared, bewildered and stunned. 'Daoist Master Changli?'

He realized in an instant—the Li Jiangqian before him was still at the Foundation Establishment Realm!

'Something's happened!'

As expected, Li Jiangchun immediately grasped the gravity of the situation. He stood up, questioning, "Brother?!"

A flicker of agitation and doubt flashed in Li Jiangqian's eyes. He glanced at the two of them and said in a low voice, "No more talk. Follow me into the inner formation immediately!"

Li Jiangchun didn't hesitate. He immediately took Li Suining and flew up on the wind. The three of them stood upon the Li Fire and shot away in an instant. The golden-eyed man's lips curled into a slight smile as he spoke in a low voice, "Today, Father is leading men south from the lake to take revenge on Changxiao. The Daoist Master remains on the island and has ordered a travel ban, with all direct descendants to enter the formation."

His gaze turned venomous, his tone thick with killing intent. "Changxiao Gate acted in secret, forcing away the Daoist Master, forcing our grand-uncle to his death, and forcing Father to draw his sword to protect himself. Today... we will avenge the pursuit and slaughter on the river."

The overwhelming news exploded in his ears. Li Suining lowered his head, a vague suspicion in his mind instantly confirmed. A chill settled deep within him. 

'This is bad... this is very bad... It's just as I feared!'

'Indeed, influencing a battle at the Purple Mansion Realm level was bound to cause problems... It's happened sooner... The Daoist Master's escape from the West Sea has hastened the fall of Changxiao... Not only has it been hastened... but... it's our family making the move! It's actually our family making the move!!'

# Chapter 1012: The Soldiers Arrive

Li Suining’s heart sank, but he was wary of Li Jiangqian’s sharp, cold, and calculating nature. He dared not let his true feelings show, forcing a look of pleasant surprise. The white-robed swordsman beside them, however, let his own joy fade.

"How come we never heard?" he murmured. "To think it was enough to disturb Brother's seclusion."

Li Jiangqian folded his hands into his sleeves and gave a slight nod. "For a matter of this magnitude, of course."

Li Jiangchun understood at once. He stepped aside, gesturing for Li Suining to come forward. "Brother, this is Suining, a rare formation prodigy from my branch of the family. The Daoist Master met him personally and granted him a new cultivation method and Dao Lineage."

A faint smile touched the lips of the man in the crimson robe. "I have been in seclusion for so long. I had no idea the family had produced such a talent. It is a pleasure to finally meet you."

Joy still glimmering in his eyes, Li Suining responded with utmost respect, bowing formally. Then, feigning concern, he tentatively asked, "It’s just… a while ago, the Wilderness was consumed by karmic fire, and a battle between Purple Mansion Realm experts erupted over the lake. I wonder if this will affect the grand plan…"

Li Jiangqian waved a dismissive hand. "It is of no consequence. Just a couple of misguided Merciful Ones who threw their lives away in a futile struggle against the Daoist Master."

Hearing this, Li Suining immediately nodded in admiration. He hoped Li Jiangqian would elaborate, so he held his tongue.

He watched as Li Jiangqian narrowed his eyes. "The situation was urgent. The cultivators stationed on the lake were mobilized, leaving it undefended. The Daoist Master summoned me from seclusion merely to stand guard… As for the suddenness of it all… it wasn't entirely unexpected. Father has just returned from Simin."

The statement was veiled, a nuance Li Jiangchun naturally grasped. But Li Suining was no ordinary young man; he, too, understood its profound meaning.

'King Wei… so he went to Simin.'

The movements of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator were a closely guarded secret. At that time, he had only been at the Embyronic Breathing stage, so it was normal for him to be unaware. As he mulled it over, a golden light began to dawn on the horizon.

The light was as vast as a palace, yet long, narrow, and magnificent. Its upper decks were crowded with pavilions, manned by a dense formation of soldiers in white armor. It was a massive, pale-gold longship!

The great ship, Quhe!

This dharma vessel was the Li family's oldest flying ship, forged long ago by the Nine Gates of He from the western shore. Back then, the family's artifact-forging techniques were still crude, and the great ship could not change its size. But fortune and misfortune are two sides of the same coin. Since transforming it was not a consideration, subsequent modifications simply made it larger and larger. It usually rested at the bottom of the lake, its existence known to few.

Now, as it soared into the air, it resembled a high palatial platform gliding through the sky. A turbulent wave of air billowed in its wake as countless streaks of light, too numerous to count, swarmed around it like a protective cloud. The convoy ascended high into the heavens, and with a ripple of formation arrays, vanished from sight as it headed east.

'The Jade Court Guard has departed…'

Li Suining’s pupils reflected the dense, star-like shower of escaping light, and a flicker of pride ignited in his gaze.

'The Jade Court Guard… the precursor to the twenty-one divisions of Tingzhou and the royal soldiers of Zhao's King Wei. Now, they are about to strike for the first time. Let Wu and Yue hear the name of my family's Jade Court Guard…'

Li Suining could state without reservation that with the decline of the Zhao State's royal court, the number of powers in the world willing to spend a century building a proper military unit—to systematically supply a true orthodox army for a hundred years—could be counted on one hand. Even the great houses of the northern desert, hardened by constant warfare, were still plagued by the wildness of their tribal clans. When it came to unwavering discipline, none could compare to his family's Jade Court Guard!

This was a surprise attack led by their elite. Once King Wei established his kingdom, these elites could form the core of a new army. Only the soldiers of the northern kings of Dai and Bolie might compare, and even then, after a decade of bloodshed on the battlefield, it was likely that even the northern royal troops would have to give them a wide berth.

'Guest Retainer Ding is still alive. In the future, with the Palace-Yang Tiger and the Mystic Iron Thunder as vanguard generals and Third Uncle commanding the battle formations… hmph… even the state of Yan will have a headache.'

He watched the ship disappear over the horizon. From the lake's edge, two smaller, silver-white vessels rose into the air, following in its wake. They weren't nearly as large. These were acquired later from the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter; they could resize at will and were of high quality, but couldn't carry many people and served a supporting role.

Finally, as the last glimmers of light vanished, he averted his gaze and followed Li Jiangqian down into the inner array. A grand hall, shimmering beneath a violet-gold barrier, materialized before them.

Here, purple light swirled in a dazzling display of color. The ground beneath their feet was a solid, brownish-gold. Li Suining had spent much of his past life cultivating in this place, and a wave of familiarity washed over him.

'The architecture is more or less the same… most of it was already built by this time…'

The three of them landed in the highest hall, where they saw a man pacing anxiously before the entrance. He was dressed simply, with a kind and honest face. Upon seeing Li Jiangqian, he produced a letter from his sleeve.

He glanced around, noting that everyone present was permitted within the inner array. He offered a quick bow and spoke directly. "I bring a message from the Qunyi Archipelago!"

Li Jiangqian took the letter as An Siwei continued, his voice laced with unease.

"It's from Daoist Master Yuanbian… We've heard that the White Victory Dao has interfered in the affairs of Poluoduo. They pursued them all the way from the Western Sea to the Suopo Kingdom, gravely injuring the Great Suopo King, Demon King Fuxun, and nearly slaying Demon King Qingyan…"

"Fortunately, the Demon Kings of Poluoduo, each fearing for their own life, rose up in a chaotic uproar. A majority of them attacked together, forcing the cultivators of the White Victory Dao to retreat… But… it all happened so suddenly. Demon King Qingyan held on for several months, but his injuries are worsening. Demon King Fuxun wishes to invite Daoist Master Yuanbian to assist them!"

Li Jiangqian's expression shifted slightly. He took the letter and read it carefully, then slapped it into his palm and looked up with a cold smile.

"What convenient timing!"

This was clearly not good news. The Li family could afford to leave Deer Weeds Island in the archipelago unattended largely because of Daoist Master Yuanbian, who was stationed there year-round. While his departure wouldn't guarantee disaster for the island, its security would be drastically reduced.

Li Jiangqian’s face darkened. "What were Daoist Master Yuanbian's instructions, and how long ago did this happen?"

An Siwei looked somewhat embarrassed. "This letter was written immediately," he said respectfully. "It was first received by a patrol cultivator, who then reported it up the chain. I saw it midway and rushed back to the family at once. At that point, we had not yet located our own Daoist Master, so I haven't heard Daoist Master Yuanbian's decision… The Qunyi Archipelago is simply too far. Although the Daoist Master usually doesn't leave for long, the second letter must still be on its way…"

Li Jiangqian paced a few steps, lost in thought.

'Poluoduo… the White Victory Dao… This letter must have been sent before we made our move… What kind of scheme is this…'

He looked up. "What did our Daoist Master say?"

An Siwei quickly replied, "I have reported it. The Daoist Master… said the Qunyi Archipelago… is not urgent."

Li Jiangqian paced with his hands behind his back, understanding the unwavering resolve of the two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. There was a Purple Mansion Realm grand formation beneath the Qunyi Archipelago. As soon as Daoist Master Yuanbian left, Li Que'wan would certainly lead everyone to take shelter within it. Once the formation was sealed, as long as the people were safe, other losses were a secondary concern.

He waved An Siwei away. Several more cultivators entered the array to deliver reports, their low voices echoing through the great hall. Standing by, Li Suining felt a wave of clarity wash over him.

'The White Victory Dao interfered in Poluoduo, chasing them from the Western Sea to the Suopo Kingdom… If our Daoist Master had been in the West Sea, he would be trapped in this conflict right now!'

'In a battle of that scale, there was an eighty to ninety percent chance the Daoist Master was injured in my past life. That's why he didn't emerge for so long after returning to the lake… he was recuperating the entire time… which meant neither of our Daoist Masters could easily be deployed!'

That Emperor Song, Yang Zhuo, intended to march north. The forces of the Way of Great Desire had not yet withdrawn, and the north was watching like a hungry tiger. Moreover, he had heard that a certain Maha Taixi was currently guarding the Wilderness, and that old monster had always been an enemy of their family… How could he simply stand by and watch?

If they were delayed too long by the Purple Mansion Realm expert and the grand formation at Changxiao Gate, there was no telling what chaos might erupt over the lake. If the Daoist Master was seriously injured as he had been in the previous life, or if he hadn't even returned in time, the moment the Way of Great Desire made a move, the situation would have spiraled out of control.

'That's why… even when the perfect opportunity arose in my past life, King Wei could only keep his forces stationed at the lake, unable to act… But now, the Daoist Master is unharmed. He can deter Maha Taixi. And with the Master of Karmic Fire gone and the main forces of the Way of Great Desire not yet arrived, he can even hold off most of their strength with the help of the formation…'

After all, the Way of Great Desire was ultimately a step below Compassion in strength, and Maha Liangli was unable to head south. Compared to the overwhelming might Compassion had displayed when it acted, the current posturing of the Way of Great Desire was mere child's play.

He sorted through the timeline in his mind, his heart steadying. He realized the course of events was not bad at all.

'Changxiao Gate is a liability now. That Great Daoist Master of theirs will definitely not show himself. If we can swallow this leading power among the seven gates, the Foundation Establishment Realm and Qi Refining resources we gain will be an immense fortune…'

Standing to the side, Li Suining gazed at Li Jiangqian's tall, slender back. A sense of calm settled over him, and a feeling of security finally took root. He took a step back, a flicker of hope blooming in his chest.

### Helin Prefecture

The Helin Mountains were a famous range. Though not particularly dense with spiritual energy, they were vast and deep, with overlapping peaks and ridges. They stood beside a wide plain, facing the Quanwu Mountains to the east, and together they supplied the Yue State with the vast majority of its low-grade spiritual resources.

Between these two mountain ranges lay a vast plain, bordering the Mushroom Forest Plains to the north and Tongmo to the west. This endless fertile land was divided into two Prefectures: Helin and Cangwu.

Helin Prefecture was situated at the foot of the Helin Mountains. It was a place of long history, backed by a mountain forest with very few Demon beasts and located deep in the heartland, seldom troubled by conflict. The Prefecture's market district was enormous, built right next to the sect gates.

At this moment, the market was ablaze with lights. In its center stood a tall, magnificent platform covered in dense formation patterns. The uppermost pavilion was a work of art, from which loud, decadent music drifted in every direction. Courtesans moved between the banquet tables, pouring wine with ingratiating smiles.

Seated at the main table high above was a Daoist. He was fair-skinned with a wispy black mustache that gave him a shrewd look. He had his legs crossed and was shaking his head to the music, utterly at ease. His pale hand swayed gently with the rhythm, yet not a single drop of wine spilled from his cup.

After a while, a fawning laugh broke the air. An old man, holding a cup, approached the platform and knelt before the Daoist’s seat. He raised the cup over his head respectfully. "Lord Zhuang! This lowly one was able to keep his worthless life… all thanks to you, my lord… Please allow me to offer you a toast!"

The so-called Lord Zhuang above showed little expression. He glanced down his nose at the old man and said languidly, "Back then… when Situ Mo came to the Helin Mountains, he left you, you old coot, behind as a liaison. It was a good way to sell out the Situ family's overseas interests for his own gain… I never thought… it would end up saving your pathetic life."

The old man bowed hurriedly. "Indeed… indeed…" he said mournfully. "It's just a pity about what happened on the lake…"

The words made Lord Zhuang’s face change. He shot out a foot, kicking the old man viciously under the chin. The man flew into the air, flipped over, and crashed to the ground with a thud, coughing up blood.

'Damn it all, you might not value your life, but I value mine!'

Of course, he knew what the old man meant. In fact, that was precisely why he had saved him.

Changxiao Gate had been founded as an orthodox sect. The Dao Lineage of its founder, Changxiao, was pure, established upon True Qi, Purple Qi, and Cold Qi, supplemented by Lesser Yin and Lesser Yang. Its foundation was exceptionally sound. The Great Daoist Master's personal disciples even inherited a secret and powerful righteous path, the Encompassing Profoundity Dao.

And yet, for the past decade, the atmosphere in such an orthodox sect had grown increasingly strange. The Great Daoist Master Changxiao, the sect's founder, had been missing for years, leaving Daoist Master Cheng Yan in charge.

But the scandal surrounding Cheng Yan was so widely known that even outsiders had heard of it, let alone the members of Changxiao Gate themselves. In the years since Changxiao’s disappearance, the Daoist Master’s wife had gradually overstepped her bounds, and Cheng Yan’s doting indulgence knew no limits. The sect had lost its former purity from the very roots up.

The current sect master was Baibizi. This old cultivator had once participated in the siege against the White Qilin! When that same White Qilin later achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, he was half-envious and half-terrified, and he began promoting the Li family's enemies at every turn. The reason he, Daoist Zhuang, was able to return from overseas and take charge of such a large market was precisely because he had also been a participant that day!

Unlike Baibizi, after the initial few months of terror, Daoist Zhuang had gradually calmed down. He made inquiries and learned that Purple Mansion Realm experts had resolved their mortal karmic ties. Since he hadn't been killed on the day of the breakthrough, and with a Great Daoist Master backing his sect, he would likely be safe unless he personally provoked the other party.

So he had been biding his time in the market, a cold observer waiting for the day the lake erupted into chaos against the Buddhist cultivators. He gathered underlings who were at odds with the Li family—remnants of the Song family, old cultivators from the Situ clan—and sent them all to the sect.

'The sect is full of their enemies. It's better than me being their only enemy! If the Great Daoist Master ever decides to make a move, at least I'll have more accomplices!'

With Cheng Yan in seclusion, and with the daily efforts of these few, it was no wonder the atmosphere in Changxiao Gate had soured. Though they cultivated a brilliant and orthodox path, the sect was a far cry from the open-minded and nurturing environment it had been a century ago!

But what did he, Daoist Zhuang, care? Anyone who truly cared about Changxiao Gate was burned to death above Lake Xian by the White Qilin that day, their white cranes falling from the sky, their bodies left without a proper corpse!

He was smiling faintly to himself when he suddenly felt something. He looked down sharply and noticed the silver formation patterns beneath the main table begin to glow. He raised an eyebrow, propped his crossed feet up on the table, and leaned back lazily in his grand seat. "Which merchant caravan is flying so high again!" he said carelessly. "Fine them heavily!"

"Oh!"

A white-robed cultivator from the side hurried over. His face was flushed, clearly quite drunk, and his movements were clumsy. He activated his dharma power, affecting the grand formation. Holding a jug of wine, he apologized, "My apologies… my apologies! At this hour, it should be the shipment of Cypress Heart Fruit I'm responsible for… I'll open the formation myself for inspection. I apologize for disturbing you, my lords… Think of it as enjoying the scenery… I'll drink this cup in apology… no… three cups!"

With a red-faced, apologetic smile, he placed his hand on the formation disk. As his dharma power flowed into it, the magnificent, purple-and-azure eaves above them began to fade. Wisps of profound energy coalesced between the eaves, dissolving all obstructions and revealing the sky outside the hall.

The crowd in the pavilion raised their heads to admire the night view. Daoist Zhuang’s disdainful expression was still frozen on his face, but his pupils, now fixed on the sky, dilated in an instant. They reflected the colossal golden ship that spanned the night, its towering, multi-storied decks, and the endless streaks of light that filled the heavens.

The terrifying vista hung frozen in the night sky. Countless figures looked down upon them, their gazes cold or contemptuous, as if they had been waiting for a long time.

The banquet fell silent. So quiet one could hear a pin drop. Everyone's mind went blank. Yet, a single, grating laugh cut through the stillness.

"My mistake… my mistake… My apologies… Is it not enough that I apologize…"

The cultivator who had stepped forward was drunk. He didn't even look up, just kept drinking and muttering to himself. Finally, overcome by the wine, he collapsed backward onto his knees. The bronze jug in his hand clattered to the floor, splashing wine everywhere.

The stunned crowd continued to stare at the sky.

Streaks of immortal light swirled like a halo around the vessel. Cultivators clad in feathered robes or scaled armor shone with varied brilliance, like a heavenly army. Near and far, they flanked the colossal ship, their postures deferential. Every single gaze was fixed upon the pavilion on the main deck, frozen on the face of a young man leaning casually against a lustrous violet-gold railing.

A pair of cold, golden eyes.

Golden eyes with pupils like white-gold rings.

Li Zhouwei [Early-Stage Purple Mansion Realm]

Li Jiangqian (Great Parting Scripture) [Peak Foundation Establishment Realm] [Direct Descendant of the Second Branch]




# Chapter 1013: Trouble

Daoist Zhuang’s pupils froze.

He knew who the figure in the sky was. That face—the one that had haunted his meditations a thousand times over, filling him with a terror so deep it shattered his focus—was more familiar to him than to almost anyone else in the Changxiao Gate.

Li Zhouwei.

Years ago, when he and his disciple-brothers had surrounded and tried to kill him on the lake, Zhuang had not only studied that face up close but had wounded him with spell arts, coveted his treasures, and hurled curses at him… Tallying up his sins, he had earned death a hundred times over.

With a soft thud, the old man below the main seat sank to his knees. His gaze remained fixed, unable to look away. Even with the scene unfolding before him, his mind was a chaotic blur.

'What… what is happening…'

From Daoist Zhuang, the man the Changxiao Gate had tasked with guarding this place, down to the members of minor families and their relatives at the banquet, no one had ever imagined such a scene. The thought of the White Qilin appearing before their gates had never crossed their minds; even seeing it now felt impossible.

'The White Qilin? What is he doing here? Visiting a friend? A friend… in the Changxiao Gate? What?'

Their confusion was understandable. The Changxiao Gate had known peace for too long, and the unwritten rule of restraint within Yue State had held for ages. For centuries, conflicts had been fought by proxy overseas; how often did a battle ever reach a sect’s very gates? Even when it did, it was only after all its Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had been annihilated!

What a joke! The Changxiao Gate had a living Great Daoist Master!

Though no one said it aloud, in this era where the Azure Pond was in decline and the Supreme Yang had lost its brilliance, the Changxiao Gate, for all its claims of being the foremost immortal sect, truly had no equal in the current Yue State.

'Then… what is this? If he isn't here to visit a friend…'

The night was silent, the lamplight soft. Wine trickled across a tabletop, reflecting the phantasmal colors in the sky. The sound of each drop was jarringly loud, and in an instant, everyone lowered their heads, their eyes turning to Daoist Zhuang at the head of the hall.

'Then he must be here for revenge.'

Daoist Zhuang’s eyes were vacant. His body went limp, slumping into the main seat like a statue, his neck rigid. His pupils dilated to their limits, all expression vanishing from his face, leaving only despair.

The divine ability in the sky gave them little time to think.

It all happened too fast to react. Daoist Zhuang’s legs were still jelly when the night sky dissolved into an endless expanse of white. It flooded their vision, so blinding they couldn't see their own hands before their faces. There was only white.

With a deafening roar, the formation overhead shattered like an eggshell, annihilated by the white light. The light continued to descend, yet it felt like a gentle breeze, brushing past everyone’s faces without causing the slightest harm.

The entire pavilion beneath their feet shuddered, and all its inscribed patterns went dark. Everyone on the platform broke out in a cold sweat. Whether they wet themselves or cried out in fear, they were all frozen in place, unharmed but bound by the surging radiance, unable to move.

The great formation, lauded as endlessly profound and one of the best among those of the Foundation Establishment Realm, was a complete joke before this divine ability. The Heavenly Light in the sky was like a colossal beast that had merely breathed, and the formation on the ground had been swept away. It had even held back its strength, for fear of crushing the entire marketplace to dust.

Only then did the youth in the sky shift his gaze slightly, his eyes falling upon the Daoist on the ground. It was the look of a god peering down from an immense distance.

The next instant, the searing Heavenly Light surged into Daoist Zhuang’s seven orifices. He didn't last a second. His body, cultivated for years and tempered by Li Fire, suddenly swelled and, without warning, exploded.

A violent boom echoed out.

Blazing Li Fire erupted as his blood ignited into a roaring inferno. The fiery gore splattered outwards, raining down on the terrified guests. A chorus of muffled cries went up as people felt a spreading dampness beneath their robes. They could only tremble where they stood, too afraid to look up.

A massive flying vessel descended from the heavens. Armored soldiers disembarked, rushing into the marketplace and cutting down all who stood in their way. The sound of running feet filled the air, but the cultivators on the pavilion dared not move, held fast by the shimmering white light.

The white light surged upward, pinning them in place. The countless streams of light that had rained down now flowed back into the sky, converging on a single point. Dragon banners and phoenix chariots emerged, and swirling multicolored clouds enveloped the entire Helin Prefecture. The winds churned, revealing the barest glimpse of a colossal structure.

It was a Celestial Gate, covered in profound patterns, so vast it blotted out the sky.

---

The Changxiao Gate.

The mountains were majestic, dotted with countless palaces. White mist billowed and danced, rising from the peaks. Before the highest Profound Palace, two white vases shimmered, spewing forth a dense spiritual energy that cascaded down the steps. But down in the golden palaces of the Changxiao Gate proper, chaos reigned.

Cultivators in flowing white robes with gold trim darted about. Banners of cloud and rainbow whipped erratically in the wind. Elders and Guest Retainers flew between the peaks, their faces masks of terror and rage. Cries echoed everywhere.

"Sect Master!"

The sect master’s ornate robes looked even more distinguished under the multicolored light, but the old man himself was trembling, his face a canvas of fear. He stood frozen on the mountain peak, surrounded by kneeling cultivators who all stared up at him.

"Sect Master!"

The group of cultivators surrounded him, their faces flushed with anger, their voices a clamorous din.

"The Li clan… they're nothing but a family governed by demonic heresies! To think one of them reached the Purple Mansion Realm… and now he dares provoke our glorious righteous path!"

"The audacity! What does he take the Changxiao Gate for? We are the Dao Lineage of a Great Daoist Master! How dare he act so presumptuously!"

"We implore the Sect Master to ask the Daoist Master to emerge from his seclusion and subdue this demonic fiend!"

Rage was etched on every face but one. The white-templed sect master was utterly distraught, his pupils wide and unfocused. His attention wasn't on their words at all; his hands and feet were ice-cold, and he trembled uncontrollably.

'The Li family has brought an army… they can't have come all this way just to destroy a marketplace!'

His gaze was fixed on the dense swarm of light trails in the sky, and a deeply ominous premonition took root in his heart. He could sense the multicolored clouds rising higher. The immense divine ability was being pushed to its absolute limit, visible across the entire plain. Wherever the multicolored clouds spread, cultivator and mortal alike looked up in terror. The eyes of millions were fixed on the sky, filled with nothing but profound unease and dread.

"What is he doing?"

Before the eyes of millions, the Celestial Gate plummeted downward. Wreathed in roaring purple flames and Heavenly Light, it smashed into the magnificent, palace-studded mountain of the Changxiao Gate!

As the divine ability descended, an overwhelming suppressive force washed over them. The timid cultivators who had been watching from the periphery instantly lost control of their light trails and tumbled from the sky like a meteor shower, their white light falling like rain.

The entire Changxiao Gate was enveloped in multicolored light. A brilliant silver radiance flared across the sky as the sect’s protective formation activated on its own!

Celestial Harmony Grand Spirit Formation!

Profound patterns materialized from the Great Void, weaving together to form the array that enveloped the mountain. But before its light could reach its peak brightness, the Celestial Gate slammed into it.

A deafening clang reverberated through the entire mountain range. Disciples were thrown off balance, tumbling down the slopes. Panic finally set in, and they flew about like headless flies amidst the endless clamor as a blinding white light spread across the great formation…

The white-templed sect master collapsed to the ground, his heart frozen. The angry shouts around him died instantly, replaced by whispers of disbelief.

"He… he means to destroy the Changxiao Gate! How is this possible…"

"Where is the Great Daoist Master?!"

The white-templed one’s mind went blank. As sect master, he knew the Great Daoist Master of Changxiao’s true disposition, which only deepened his terror.

'Forget the Great Daoist Master, I don't even know where the other Daoist Masters are… And even if they were here… could they possibly win against the combined might of the White Qilin and Zhaojing?!'

Another thunderous impact. The forests swayed and the mountains trembled. Spiritual energy churned violently. The white-templed one slowly climbed back to his feet. He glanced around and saw fear on the faces of the surrounding cultivators.

Looking out from the sect gates, the sky was nothing but a blinding white light. Within that light stood the towering Celestial Gate, from which descended an endless torrent of purple flames, burning everything to ash.

There was nothing else.

"Daoist Master… Daoist Master…" The white-templed one stared at the light outside the formation, his face slick with cold sweat. He fumbled inside his sleeve but couldn't seem to find anything.

He had already crushed the jade talisman Cheng Yan had given him. He had to know! Even if he didn't, how could a Daoist Master not notice such a world-shaking commotion?

The white-templed one stood rooted to the spot, staring blankly at the horizon. Suddenly, the clamor around him ceased. At the same moment, the old man’s eyes widened in shock.

Within the boundless white light, the lone Celestial Gate had changed. A young man now stood beneath it, a halberd in his hand, his gaze fixed coldly upon them.

He had long brows and cold eyes, and his aura was utterly transformed. The long hair he once tied up now flowed freely, stirred by the churning divine ability that swirled around him. The towering, radiant Celestial Gate at his back framed him like a Monarch.

In the past, with his gaze lowered, he had been steady, calm, and impassive. Now, with his head raised, he was entirely different—ferocious and menacing, his eyes gleaming with a golden light so demonic it seemed ready to devour someone whole.

Those golden eyes seemed to pierce through the great formation’s veil, gazing down upon everything without hindrance. This terrifyingly direct and palpable connection—as if he were staring face-to-face with a Purple Mansion Realm expert—made the white-templed one's heart skip a beat. A surge of heat rose in his chest, and he nearly vomited blood in panic.

It wasn't just the sect master. The moment the White Qilin of the mortal world appeared in the sky, all curses and shouts on the mountain fell silent. The man’s presence seemed to drain the courage from everyone, replacing it with a rising panic. No matter which corner of the sect they hid in, every cultivator felt the same strange mix of terror and intimacy.

'It feels… it feels like he’s looking right at me…'

They stared at the sky, mesmerized and unable to resist.

A soft thud broke the whisper of the mountain wind as someone fell to their knees. The sound was like a spark landing in dry tinder, setting off a chain reaction. One after another, the sounds of kneeling echoed across the peaks. More and more disciples fell, prostrating themselves in terror. Those with higher cultivation levels fared better, but the weaker ones were already kowtowing. A strange atmosphere began to spread.

The white-templed sect master forced his eyes shut, feeling the defenses in his mind on the verge of collapse.

'Impossible… The formation even isolates us from the Great Void! How can his divine ability penetrate a Purple Mansion Realm-grade formation… How can it affect them through the formation…'

He had personally experienced the White Qilin's power back then, but the pressure he felt now was on an entirely different level.

'Daoist Master… where are you?!'

Under that gaze, every second felt like a year. As his hands and feet trembled, a brilliant brown light finally shone forth, blanketing the mountain gate and revealing endless profound radiances.

A man in brown robes appeared, standing silently on the solitary peak. His expression was grim and unsettled as he stared at the Heavenly Light outside, clearly agitated.

It was Daoist Master Cheng Yan!

In contrast, the white-templed one let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding. He collapsed to his knees and cried out.

"Daoist Master!"

Whatever Cheng Yan was thinking at that moment, his appearance meant a glimmer of hope for the sect master. His greatest fear was that the Daoist Master wasn't in the sect at all, that some deal had been struck to sell them out. That would have truly left him with no path to heaven and no gate to the earth!

His cry was filled with immense relief, but Cheng Yan had no time for him. Forget the disciples and elders—even Cheng Yan himself was filled with shock and suspicion!

'What… the hell?'

'For no reason at all… to show such killing intent… Are the other sects just going to ignore this? Changxiao told me my Dao was brilliant, that all I had to do was wait for the Yang family to recruit me… That Lord Yang was perfectly courteous. What is this Li family thinking, going mad like this?!'

He was both furious and bewildered, but the Li family had real power. Without Changxiao's help, he figured he would struggle just to fight Li Zhouwei, let alone with Li Ximing added to the mix… Most importantly, for the Li family to attack with such confidence, they must have some kind of ace up their sleeve!

The Daoist Master scanned his surroundings, his face as dark as the bottom of a pot. With a heavy flick of his sleeve, a wave of Wu Earth radiance erupted across the mountain, knocking over the elders and disciples who had been standing there.

The strange atmosphere on the mountain instantly eased, but no one dared to speak. They silently picked themselves up. Cheng Yan, meanwhile, extended his senses and felt his heart sink.

'The Audience with the Celestial Gate is right outside… that suppressive divine ability has always been disgusting. There's no way to slip away unnoticed…'

His expression grew uglier as the great formation beneath his feet continued to shudder. Cheng Yan looked up and saw the man beneath the Celestial Gate raise his eyes slightly and speak.

"Cheng Yan."

The voice was calm, yet it resonated with the divine ability, carrying through the formation. Daoist Master Cheng Yan's expression shifted, and for a moment, he dared not meet the gaze, slowly looking away.

But those words snapped the last taut nerve in the white-templed one’s mind. The old man staggered back as if stricken, collapsing to the ground. His lips trembled as he shrieked in horror.

"He can see us! He can see us!"

His shrill cry echoed through the mountains, sowing panic. The low-level cultivators who had just managed to get back on their feet were cut down like a field of wheat, bending over and collapsing. The weak-willed among them even began to kowtow again.

In truth, Daoist Master Cheng Yan knew better than anyone in the sect just how terrifying the man in the sky, wreathed in Bright Yang, truly was. This was the figure that even Shilou Yingge couldn't capture! The sect master’s scream sent a chill down his spine.

He forced himself to remain calm and looked up. Through the radiance, he saw the long halberd rise, pointing at the mountains below. Its tip was sharp and dazzling. The young man issued his command.

"Come out of the formation and accept your execution. I will spare your disciples."

Cheng Yan never expected such a blunt ultimatum. It was a complete loss of face. Though a knot of fear tightened in his stomach, his expression remained as placid as an ancient well, his eyes cold and severe. Before he could speak, he saw Li Zhouwei's palm begin to glow even brighter. A sliver of silver-white brilliance leaped from it.

This sliver of light was incredibly dense, sometimes scattering, sometimes coalescing. It darted about his palm like a playful carp, yet its movements stirred up dazzling arcs of lightning that pulsed with a destructive aura.

Understanding finally dawned on Cheng Yan, and his face went deathly pale. With his Purple Mansion Realm vision, he could clearly see what that silver light was.

It looked like a single sliver, but it was actually a dense swarm of thousands upon thousands of sesame-seed-sized silver-white sparks of lightning. The number was impossible to estimate, and each tiny spark that manifested was in truth a silver-white, sword-shaped wedge of lightning!

The young man’s voice, thoughtful and even tinged with a faint smile, echoed from all directions and entered his ears:

"As for breaking the formation to kill you… Minghuang doesn't mind the trouble. The only trouble is that you, fellow Daoist, will perish and turn to soil."

"When that happens, the Wu Earth will fall upon your mountain gate. The casualties will be countless, and it would be a shame to defile your spirit veins."




# Chapter 1014: Before the Formation

A flash of silver reflected in his eyes, and a deep chill settled in Cheng Yan’s heart.

'The Stormshatter Wedges.'

The Azure Pond Sect’s Stormshatter Wedges!

This treasure originated from the path of Encompassing Profoundity, a thunder-aspected artifact of the Dharma path. Within that single silver glint lay one thousand eight hundred and twenty-one individual wedges. Just ten of them could shatter an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm formation. All of them, gathered together… it was one of the few treasures in Jiangnan capable of rapidly dismantling a Purple Mansion Realm formation!

Changxiao had obtained his Dao Lineage from a Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven in the Eastern Sea. As the first Purple Mansion Realm cultivator raised by the Changxiao Gate, Cheng Yan knew more about this artifact than most disciples of the Azure Pond Sect itself.

But beyond the power of the Stormshatter Wedges, the implications they carried sent an even colder dread through him.

'They wouldn't have just fallen into his hands. The Azure Pond Sect must not only approve of this, but they must be offering their full support! Ning Wan is useless now, so it must be that man Si… that Si wants me dead, too…'

'And behind the Azure Pond Sect… it’s most likely the Yang Clan…'

'This shouldn't be happening… it absolutely shouldn't…'

But in the space of a single thought, the silver light in Li Zhouwei’s palm had already scattered into a sky full of flowing streams. Each stream materialized into a silver-white, handleless, diamond-shaped blade over three feet long, covered in profound patterns of lightning.

Rumbling thunder crackled and arced between them. The sky became a starfield of silver points, densely packed yet orderly, spreading to every corner of the heavens. It was like a vast, suffocating net, descending with crushing weight.

Every eye in the sect turned to Cheng Yan, but the Daoist Master had no more time for contemplation. No matter how the situation had changed, he could not stand by and watch the Stormshatter Wedges destroy their great formation!

"Voom…"

A dense brilliance of Wu Earth finally erupted, its power shaking every corner of the mountain. The light twisted and coiled as it rose, transforming in a breath into a colossal umbrella that soared into the sky. It was a tapestry of brown and yellow, interwoven with patterns of gold and green, blotting out the sun and blocking every last streak of thunder and light.

"BOOM!"

The silver-white lightning flowed uselessly across the umbrella’s canopy, rapidly ground away and shattered by the Wu Earth brilliance. With light and thunder held at bay, the Changxiao Gate was plunged into darkness. Cheng Yan’s voice boomed like thunder, echoing through the night sky.

"Li Zhouwei! By unleashing such demonic slaughter… where do you place the True Qi of the righteous path!"

But the profound Bright Yang Celestial Gate, hanging above the light and thunder, did not waver in the slightest. The golden-eyed young man took a step forward. The space between his brows blazed, and the Bright Yang radiance from within the Celestial Gate surged up his robes.

"Changxiao pledged allegiance to the north, and you, Cheng Yan, are a lecher and a degenerate. How dare you speak of True Qi? I did not come today for the sake of True Qi! Nor do I intend to uphold any universal radiance. Instead…"

He bared his teeth in a grin, his eyes cold.

"I have come to avenge Lake Xian."

Before his words faded, a brilliant radiance erupted. Cheng Yan’s body flickered with the glow of Wu Earth. Not daring to be careless, he crossed his hands before his chest and summoned a pearl.

The Wu Earth spirit embryo, the Wu Bloom Pearl!

The Wu Earth brilliance was incredibly dense, like the unfathomable depths of the solid earth itself. It received the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, causing ripples of deep purple fire to flare across its surface.

"Rumble…"

The Wu Earth brilliance trembled but stood firm against the Bright Yang, showing no fear. Its light, however, was rapidly diminishing. A flicker of joy rose in Cheng Yan, but then a spark of Supreme Yang flared within the hidden light. The two radiances resonated, and the spirit embryo in his hand suddenly became searingly hot!

He poured his divine ability into the spirit embryo with all his might while searching for an opening. He saw that the Audience with the Celestial Gate in the sky remained motionless, locked firmly onto him, and that Li Zhouwei himself was merely employing a simple spell art from his brow.

Cheng Yan had, after all, been a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for over sixty years. Even if his talent was somewhat lacking compared to the geniuses of his generation, his methods were seasoned and ruthless. He showed no sign of retreat. He snapped his head up, shaking loose a speck of brilliance.

Wu Earth divine ability, Immortal Without Flaw!

This speck of brilliance, a fusion of divine ability and spell art, seemed ordinary but carried a different quality. The Daoist Master’s expression shifted, turning grim, but he was supremely confident in his power.

'Such arrogance… Even if I haven’t progressed in recent years, do you really think you can defeat me so casually!'

The brilliance expanded at an incredible rate, pulsing in the air as if breathing. Within it, a seven-colored light merged into a profound unity of white, transforming into a torrent of Heavenly Glow. But Cheng Yan felt a searing heat on his face. He raised his brows slightly and realized the young man was already upon him!

"Voom…"

A sharp, brilliant halberd descended. Strands of tangled white radiance fell like ropes, carrying the power of the Sun's Resonant Parting Art, flaring and dying amidst the brilliance. Cheng Yan’s voice was like ice.

"Bright Yang… even Bright Yang must bow before Wu Earth!"

His Art-Suppressing, Light-Quelling Wu Brilliance had been exceedingly difficult to cultivate. Combined with his Wu Earth divine ability, Immortal Without Flaw, it was built around the supreme concept of Wu Earth Flawlessness—perfect for subjugating all arts and buying him time to maneuver! The moment he neutralized the tangled hidden light, he would immediately flee into the Great Void!
'Even if you are a White Qilin, you possess only two divine abilities! How can you possibly spare the attention to stop me while dealing with my Wu Brilliance!'

But the words had barely left his mouth when a golden light leaped from the halberd, creating a second, identical golden halberd that bypassed the clash and stabbed directly at Cheng Yan’s face!

Cheng Yan was no Buddhist cultivator; he had no intention of underestimating this strike. He was forced to manifest his divine ability to block the Bright Yang. In that slight pause, the radiance between the golden-eyed youth’s brows swiftly turned to darkness, revealing the sign of a solar eclipse.

Emperor Qi’s Light!

From the eclipse sigil, countless streams of light emerged, black at their tips and golden at their tails. They were like nimble, venomous snakes, carving graceful arcs through the air and kicking up a furious storm of dharma power.

The spell art was so potent it sent a wave of heat across Cheng Yan’s face, leaving him with a lingering fear.

'What a terrifying spell art! Good thing my Wu Brilliance is already in place!'

And just as he expected, as the thousands of black-and-gold streams stretched out, the ethereal, immortal-aspected brilliance swelled in response. It became like the solid, unshakable earth, swallowing every last ray of light without exception!

Cheng Yan finally broke free and stepped into the pitch-black of the Great Void. Just as a sliver of doubt rose in his mind, he felt a sudden chill from above. He snapped his gaze upward.

Hanging in the Great Void was a Purple-Gold Thunder Mace. Lightning flashed across its surface, which was covered in dense, profound patterns—engravings for slaying demons and dispelling evil. A purple-gold light shone down, unleashing a sea of thunder!

Cheng Yan’s Protective Spirit Umbrella was still down on the mountain. Caught completely off guard, he was instantly trapped in the lightning sea, unable to maneuver. But the Purple-Gold Thunder Mace wasn't finished. Its light grew ever more brilliant as it unleashed a massive thunderbolt.

"BOOM!"

Cheng Yan’s Wu Bloom Pearl immediately shot up, meeting the thunderbolt head-on and exploding into a shower of brown light.

Thanks to the principle of Wu Earth quelling thunder, even a surprise attack of this magnitude only caused his face to pale. But the heavens seemed enraged. Thunderbolts descended one after another, nose to tail, each one thicker than the last, hammering him until he was overwhelmed.

Yet amidst the intersecting lightning, Cheng Yan’s expression changed. His divine ability, Immortal Without Flaw, though not a Life Divine Ability, was exceptionally wondrous. It sent him a dark premonition, a sudden, dreadful understanding.

'Not good!'

Sure enough, patches of radiance began to appear in the Great Void, revealing the form of the Celestial Gate. He could no longer be bothered with the lightning; he immediately leaped from the Great Void back into the physical world!

But while Cheng Yan had been momentarily trapped, the solar eclipse sigil in the physical world had not paused for an instant. The darkness within it had deepened, and the streams of light emerging from it had split from one to two, and two to four. They moved like demon gods from the Nine Nethers, unfurling their full might to blanket the entire sky.

The speck of Wu Brilliance, truly worthy of its flawless nature, was not outdone. It expanded in sync, becoming a hazy, benevolent brown-yellow fog that sheltered all living things. But it was a river without a source. Its last dregs of divine ability and dharma power were wrung dry in an instant, and it collapsed with a deafening roar.

"BOOM!"

The countless black-and-gold streams that had been bound within it erupted forth, blotting out the sky as they swarmed through the air. Cheng Yan, who had just finished maneuvering, was instantly forced out of hiding, his face a mask of shock—he had only just managed to form a single spell art!

'His words… they weren't just talk…'

A sense of crisis unlike anything he had ever felt washed over the Daoist Master. Between his own life and the Changxiao Gate, he chose the former without a moment’s hesitation.

The spirit umbrella protecting the mountain from the Stormshatter Wedges vanished in an instant, reappearing in his palm. He immediately opened it, and it swayed under the assault of Emperor Qi’s Light like a lone lotus leaf in a downpour.

Cheng Yan showed no signs of panic. Even though everything had exceeded his predictions, he had already tossed another Spiritual Artifact into the Great Void to resist the lightning. A pale white talisman appeared before him as he simultaneously unleashed the spell art in his hands.

'The Form-Dissolving Mind-Shift Talisman!'

He had no intention of getting entangled with this White Qilin. Li Ximing and Si Yuanli had yet to appear; if the situation changed, it would almost certainly be a fatal development!

The talisman combined with his spell art and instantly released a boundless radiance. Before the talisman even fully activated, hazy clouds of mist were already rushing out, attempting to freeze every divine ability and spell art in place.

'By my decree!'

With the protective layer of his spell art gone, the demonic scene of the solar eclipse and Emperor Qi's Light was finally revealed to all the disciples of Changxiao Gate. The sky was no longer obstructed. A faint smile touched Li Zhouwei’s lips as an object materialized before him.

It was round like a Golden Core, wrapped in countless golden threads, and as red as flame. It pulsed with the glow of Li Fire. It was the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument.

Swarm of Light!

An immensely vast suppressive force instantly spread across the area. Cheng Yan’s Form-Dissolving Mind-Shift Talisman activated in the nick of time. His divine ability circulated, not only cleverly evading the sky full of light streams but also transforming him into a scattering of Wu Earth brilliance.

He left behind only an endless, disorienting mist that spread through the air, meant to interfere with Li Zhouwei’s judgment.

Li Zhouwei’s expression, however, did not change much. He allowed the Wu Earth brilliance to flow past him. His own divine ability remained unshaken, hanging high in the air, ready to strike, preventing any long-distance escape.

Only his golden eyes brightened slightly. He turned his head and stared coldly to his left.

"A joke."

Cheng Yan’s spell art was decent, but back then, even Helian Wumeng’s Thousand-Hundred Body had failed to deceive his golden eyes. What was a mediocre talisman in comparison?

Cheng Yan had been searching for an escape route when that sudden gaze locked onto him, making his blood run cold. But it was too late! He had made several mistakes in that single instant… and even though he wasn't seriously injured, even though he might have had other options, the combination of those errors was fatal.

Beneath the radiant Celestial Gate, there was suddenly no one there.

Sovereign’s Perilous Tread.

The young man’s face arrived before Cheng Yan almost at the same instant he turned, so close he could see his reflection. Complex, scale-like golden patterns were mirrored in Cheng Yan’s pupils. The Daoist Master only felt his throat tighten as an iron hand clamped down on it, a suffocating sense of danger flooding his mind.

'Damn it!'

A powerful, wrenching force slammed into him. Before the stunned eyes of his entire sect, the Daoist Master of Changxiao Gate had his divine ability shattered. He was lifted by one hand and held high in the air!

Cheng Yan had calculated a thousand possibilities, wracked his brain, but he had never imagined this. The moment he activated a spell art and a Purple Mansion Realm talisman should have been his safest… how could he suddenly be captured! But no matter how much he failed to understand, his heart was filled with nothing but icy despair.

His connection to his Spiritual Artifact, the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, had been severed!

Not only that, but the instant his opponent’s hand closed around his neck, a sharp, piercing pain shot through his mind, and his vision went black.

The eyes of the young man before him were a sea of pure radiance, and the light between his brows had become tangible. Cheng Yan awoke as if from a dream, but it was far too late. His divine abilities were still surging toward his neck in a desperate struggle. Under the suppression of the Bright Yang divine ability and the Swarm of Light, his head tore itself free from his neck without hesitation!

Back then, Helian Wumeng, whose Dharma Body was formidable and who excelled at close-quarters combat, had only managed to escape in a sorry state after Li Zhouwei had locked his throat. Cheng Yan had some skill in spell arts, but how powerful could his Dharma Body be?
What’s more… Li Zhouwei was no longer the same man he once was. He had now mastered Sovereign’s Perilous Tread!

Cheng Yan's head had just taken flight when another large hand clamped down on the back of his skull. Dazzling Heavenly Light transformed into an endless tide of white, pouring in through his eyes, nose, and ears, accompanied by a sharp, grating sound like scraping metal.

"BOOM!"

The head let out a miserable roar. Searing Heavenly Light erupted from Cheng Yan’s wide-open mouth. His body, still trapped in Li Zhouwei’s grip, forcibly snapped in half at the chest and, powered by his divine ability, tried to fly into the Great Void!

But Li Zhouwei merely squeezed the head lightly, not even bothering to look back.

What met Cheng Yan’s fleeing torso was the massive Celestial Gate emerging from the Great Void. Its two enormous white pillars slammed down with a roar, wreathed in roiling purple flames. They crushed him back into the physical world, shattering all his Wu Earth brilliance and pinning him firmly in mid-air.

A pale white scroll hung from the top of the Celestial Gate, tied with a thin golden thread. It swayed gently, still rolled up, yet it bound the entire gate together, turning it into an immovable object.

"Rumble…"

The endless white light continued to pour from the head. All its flesh and blood were incinerated, leaving only a jade-like, brown-yellow skull. Its jaw trembled, emitting a low plea.

"My lord… my lord…"

The young man smiled.

"You’re too polite, fellow Daoist. It seems you weren’t carrying the Yongjing Profound Ring after all. We waited and waited, but it was all for nothing."

He casually tossed the skull to the base of the Celestial Gate, took a step forward, and let his gaze drift down to the mountain sect below.

'Making three Spiritual Treasures move, having the Stormshatter Wedges respond, and me killing you personally… if you have a next life, this will be something worth bragging about.'

But the entire Changxiao mountain sect had become a sea of dead silence. Tens of thousands of people stood on the mountain, yet the only sound was the rustling of wind through the forest. This silence spread from the peak all the way to the base. Not a single person dared to ride the winds. Not a single person dared to look up.

Countless cultivators lowered their heads in terror, standing rooted to the ground, a single thought echoing in their minds:

'How long did that take? A mighty Daoist Master… a venerable master of divine abilities… how long did that even take?'

# Chapter 1015: Soul Refining

A crisp, clear chime shattered the profound silence, echoing across the sky. A speck of gold emerged from the Great Void, blossoming in mid-air into a small umbrella woven from brown and yellow light. Spiritual Qi converged upon its surface, which was adorned with intricate patterns of gold and green, as it floated gently in the air.

It was Cheng Yan’s Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella.

The Spiritual Artifact’s radiant surface was now tightly bound by layers of golden threads, constricting every rib and strut. It struggled, but the bonds held fast, making escape impossible.

This was the most sublime divine ability of the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument: Profound Mystery. It could stealthily lock down an opponent's Spiritual Artifact, and with clever timing, it could have the devastating effect of severing a limb in the heat of battle.

Spiritual Treasures possessed a spirit of their own. The moment Cheng Yan was suppressed, the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella had been recalled.

Li Zhouwei’s gaze, however, remained fixed on the mountain below. Within his golden eyes, black flames seemed to dance, growing more intense with every disciple of the Changxiao Gate who bowed their head in submission.

He raised his halberd, its bright tip pointing toward the immortal mountain beneath his feet.

As he did, the rumbling of thunder began to build. One thousand, eight hundred and twenty-one silver, handleless, diamond-shaped blades materialized, filling the sky. As the halberd’s point shifted, the thunderous patterns on the blades flared with a brilliant light.

“Open the formation. I will only execute the ringleader.”

His voice was calm, yet it struck the mountain like a clap of thunder, draining the color from the faces of the assembled cultivators. The white-templed elder broke out in a cold sweat. Around him, some disciples wept silently while others murmured with downcast eyes, but no one dared to speak out.

In fact, a great many of them rose to their feet, their previous righteous indignation vanished. Averting their gaze from their old sect master, they pleaded in low voices, “Sect Master, open the formation…”

‘Our own Daoist Master has been suppressed and his Spiritual Artifact has been seized!’ they thought. ‘Once those Stormshatter Wedges break through, the entire sect will be sealed. We might not even be able to escape!’

The white-templed elder understood this perfectly well. He glanced around, his heart seized by terror.

It wasn't just Cheng Yan who had recognized the Stormshatter Wedges; the senior cultivators of Changxiao Gate saw them clearly as well. The Azure Pond Sect had to be pulling the strings from behind the scenes. Now, with Changxiao gone and Cheng Yan defeated, disaster was upon them.

Yet, at this critical moment, the white-templed elder stood his ground. Head lowered, he grit his teeth and declared, “The Great Daoist Master must have a hidden card!”

_Boom!_

The one thousand, eight hundred and twenty-one silver blades descended with brutal force.

Unlike the shimmering collision of spiritual energy during the Audience with the Celestial Gate, the Stormshatter Wedges slammed into the formation and locked on tight. Silvery-white tendrils of light spread across the barrier as violent lightning erupted, shaking the very foundations of the mountains.

“Sect Master!”

Desperate pleas rang out, but the white-templed elder remained unmoved, his expression one of unnatural steeliness.

‘If he enters the formation, I will surely die!’

The lightning at the formation’s edge grew thicker, resonating with the mountain’s natural Primordial Magnetism. Dead leaves began to float, and robes clung together as unrest swept through the crowd.

The white-templed elder roared, “The Great Daoist Master has not returned! How can the sect surrender?!”

But the Changxiao Gate was never his to command alone. The various peak masters vied for influence, each with their own agenda. They had only followed him because he was appointed by the Daoist Master. Now that their Daoist Master was trapped under another’s divine ability, what weight did his words carry?

Despite his thunderous shouts, the expressions of those around him remained unchanged. The mountain grew dark again as the lightning storm danced across the formation’s glow. Amidst the chaos, two figures exchanged a subtle glance and cried out, “We honor the Sect Master’s immortal decree!”

The white-templed elder’s face changed, but several hands grabbed his arms. The crowd surged, pushing him toward the main hall. Someone even sobbed, “Sect Master, your sacrifice is noble! Your family… the hundred souls of your clan… we will ensure the Daoist Master protects them! Please, rest assured!”

---

In the sky above, the brilliant white Celestial Gate blazed against the darkness, wreathed in roiling, colorful clouds. Beneath it, the brown and yellow divine ability struggled desperately, yet it could not budge the gate an inch. Each impact merely caused a bright white scroll hanging on the gate to sway gently, absorbing the force.

Li Zhouwei stood beneath his divine ability, the entire mountain sect below now blanketed in silver lightning. He waited quietly, forming a mudra over his heart and casually breathing wisps of black flame.

The small umbrella—brown and yellow, interwoven with gold and green—lay in his palm, pulsing with the glow of Wu Earth. Li Zhouwei weighed it for a moment, his assessment already complete.

‘As Spiritual Artifacts go, this is mid-tier,’ he mused. ‘It would be more potent in the hands of a Wu Earth cultivator. The Bright Yang Dao is not compatible with Wu Earth, so in my hands, it’s even weaker than a normal cultivator would find it. About on par with the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger.’

‘What a shame this fellow is another pauper. That spirit embryo is surely unusable. The only thing of value is this Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella. At least it has some trade value…’

As he pondered, he raised an eyebrow and spoke.

“Daoist Friend Qinghu.”

Only then did a middle-aged man materialize beside him. Dressed in a green scholar's robe with long sleeves, a gourd tied to his waist and a sword on his back, he appeared somewhat reserved. He quickly bowed. “Congratulations… congratulations, Your Highness!”

Si Yuanli had witnessed the entire battle. Though he had been prepared to intervene, he knew Cheng Yan wouldn’t last long. Still, his heart pounded with fear—Cheng Yan had been defeated far too quickly.

One had to remember that Cheng Yan cultivated Wu Earth. That dao lineage was renowned for its impenetrability, a reputation earned through the hard-fought victories of its practitioners. It gave them a unique advantage against immortal cultivators.

Even if Cheng Yan was incompetent, he was still a Wu Earth Purple Mansion Realm expert practicing Immortal Without Flaw. And though his was not the orthodox northern lineage—most Eastern Sea traditions were tainted by the demonic path—he was not someone an ordinary person could easily defeat.

‘He fell too easily… If the White Qilin wanted to kill me one day, how long would it take?’

A chill went through him. As he hesitated, preparing to speak, Li Zhouwei looked at him and raised an eyebrow. “Please.”

Si Yuanli hastily pushed his thoughts aside and nodded in understanding. In a flash, both their figures shifted, reappearing beneath the Celestial Gate.

The heat under the gate was immense, with violet flames surging violently. The headless body, its flesh gleaming like crystal, knelt within the inferno, clutching a brownish-yellow skull to its chest. It seemed oblivious as the purple flames licked across its dharma-body.

A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator’s vitality was incredibly tenacious, and Cheng Yan’s cultivation of the noble Wu Earth dao lineage only enhanced it. But brought so low, all he could do was struggle against the oppressive, grinding power of the Audience with the Celestial Gate.

“My lord… my lords!”

Cheng Yan’s headless body prostrated, revealing pinkish muscle and a section of gleaming white windpipe. His spirit was utterly broken. Filled with terror, he pleaded, “Your Highness… Changxiao was behind everything! I am but one man with a single divine ability. What power could I possibly have before a Great Daoist Master like him?!”

Li Zhouwei acted as if he hadn't heard. He reached into the flames and plucked out a bulging, golden storage pouch.

‘Since Changxiao left the immortal gate, he must have been prepared to sacrifice this place. There can’t be many Purple Mansion Realm treasures left in the Changxiao Gate… anything of value would be in Cheng Yan’s storage pouch.’

According to their prior agreement, its contents were to be split with Si Yuanli. Li Zhouwei tossed it forward, had Cheng Yan release the seal on it, and then with a flick of his finger, sent it soaring. Bound by Heavenly Light, it hung beside the scroll on the Celestial Gate, a clear sign that he had not touched it.

Cheng Yan had no mind for such things. After a brief pause, his voice filled with the rage and hatred of regret. “Changxiao… Changxiao… I was loyal to him, risking my life at every turn… He deceived me! He used me as a pledge of allegiance… Me, the entire Changxiao Gate, we were nothing but tools for him to declare his stance!”

Cheng Yan had been kept in the dark by Changxiao, fed a stream of false information. He hadn’t realized the truth even when the enemy was at his gates. But a short time under this divine ability had been enough for him to connect all the dots.

‘Changxiao… Changxiao has already chosen the north…’

But no matter how his hatred for Changxiao burned like the Eastern Sea, he could not afford to dwell on it. He spoke in a low, submissive tone.

“I have long since seen the error of my ways. Now that I have fallen into your hands… I beg only for my life!”

“My cultivation may not be high… but I am in the Purple Mansion Realm… I have no ambitions. I am willing to guard a territory for you, my lord… willing to be your dog, to serve you hand and foot…”

He humbled himself completely, not daring to reattach his head. The headless body knelt, its shoulders thudding against the divine ability’s barrier as he begged for his life.

“Heh…” Si Yuanli watched quietly and let out a cold laugh.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him with a smile. “Has Daoist Friend Qinghu come to plead for him?”

Si Yuanli shook his head, his voice tinged with melancholy. “It just reminds me… of a story from my clan’s history.”

“Oh?”

Li Zhouwei shot him a look. Si Yuanli smiled. “Once, in the Chu State… there was a sect called the Auxiliary Profound Gate. They took in a rogue Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the south, a Daoist Master Xiang Xiao, who also served to guard their territory. Unfortunately… the old Daoist Master of the Auxiliary Profound Gate fell in a great battle, and the sect found itself with a new master… His bloodline was completely extinguished…”

“This Auxiliary Profound Gate was also in Helin. Daoist Master Xiang Xiao had many descendants, which is why the noble families of Helin have such fine bloodlines! They’ve produced so many geniuses.”

His words were so blatant, a direct insinuation of Cheng Yan's origins, that the headless body lifted itself. The skull in its arms, enduring the humiliation, spoke in a low, obsequious voice, “My lord jests.”

“Then he must be killed,” Li Zhouwei said with a smile, but his tone was resolute.

Cheng Yan grit his teeth and finally cursed, “Sima Yuanli! Your family stole the Azure Pond from the Chi family, yet you dare speak of usurpation!”

Si Yuanli sneered. “The truth behind the Azure Pond is not something to be discussed lightly. But your affair of killing your brother-in-law and sleeping with your sister is quite well-known! And you took such good care of those bastard children, didn’t you, Daoist Friend Cheng Yan?”

Si Yuanli’s family history of usurpation was a known fact he didn't fear people mentioning, but Cheng Yan’s own deeds were far more disgraceful. The accusation struck him dumb. He trembled within the divine ability, his chest filled with rage, unable to raise or lower his head.

But Si Yuanli wasn't finished. He laughed. “You are a man without sense. If not for your incestuous affair and your demonic Earth Virtue practices, I believe my lord might have spared you. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator is hard to create but easy to kill. Having one serve the court is always a benefit!”

His words made Li Zhouwei’s eyes narrow slightly. Cheng Yan’s heart sank completely. The headless body trembled against the ground, and a grim voice emerged, “You… one from a northern aristocratic clan that has survived four dynasties, the other a descendant of the imperial clan, beloved of the Bright Yang. My ancestors were bound by the ethics your ancestors established, where every move was a transgression. Yet when brothers of the Bright Yang kill each other, when noble families treat lives like grass, your ethics turn a blind eye. Today… your Li Family purges the righteous, your Sima Family usurps without consequence. It’s only because one of you is named Li and the other is named Sima. How is that any different from the past?”

“I am a man of humble origins, doomed by your so-called ethics. What is there to say?”

Si Yuanli laughed loudly. “It seems I was right. In your eyes, your incestuous acts were the most righteous of all.”

Flesh began to grow back on Cheng Yan’s skull. His eyes blazed as he spat through clenched teeth, “Righteous? I have my own divine ability; I will not listen to your ethics! Sima Yuanli, you listen to me! You are nothing but a child. Do not think for a moment that this is a victory for the world’s ethics or morals. I die because of the political situation, not because of morality! Stop waving your moral banner! What good is your Sima Family?!”

Si Yuanli’s expression turned grim. He gave him a cool, detached look. But Li Zhouwei placed a hand on his shoulder and smiled. “Daoist Friend Qinghu, don’t push him to his death. I need to keep him alive to see if I can find Changxiao’s whereabouts.”

At these words, Si Yuanli paused, frowning in silence. Cheng Yan’s gaze turned icy. “Changxiao is cold and heartless. Why would he care about me?” he sneered.

Li Zhouwei replied calmly, “I have my ways.”

Two streams of divine ability shot out. Si Yuanli still looked confused. Li Zhouwei glanced at him, sighed inwardly, and said, “Daoist friend, you truly are a meticulous planner.”

Si Yuanli looked slightly awkward and shook his head. Li Zhouwei unfastened the dark gold halberd from his waist. “My dao lineage has no affinity for Wu Earth, and even less use for it. If you truly need it, Daoist friend, there’s no harm in leaving this fortune here. However… I want the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella.”

Even if Li Zhouwei hadn’t said anything, the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella was almost certainly his. By phrasing it this way, he was doing Si Yuanli a favor. Si Yuanli nodded repeatedly, showing no embarrassment at being found out. “Then I will trouble you, Daoist friend!”

The golden-eyed youth raised the halberd, glancing at the divine ability under his feet. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd, after many years, blazed brightly once more. Its intricate patterns trembled and then erupted with light.

Splitting Light!

The Celestial Gate abruptly lifted, releasing an endless, brilliant radiance. A massive, mountain-sized golden brilliance burst through the clouds, trailing a rainbow torrent as it crashed down. Cheng Yan’s horrified and enraged voice instantly ripped through the night sky. “Li Zhouwei… you!”

But his long-weakened Wu Earth radiance was fragile before this dazzling light. The halberd’s light paused for a mere instant before shattering it completely.

_BOOM!_

An even vaster radiance erupted from within the roiling thunderstorm. A powerful aura surged skyward, instantly dispelling the dark clouds and revealing a stunning Heavenly Glow that covered a thousand miles.

Countless streams of black light converged at a single point, rapidly spreading across the sky. A thick mist unfurled below, with heavenly light above and fog below. From between them, specks of black earth rained down.

On the ground, the Baleful Earth resonated. The earth roared, splitting open with deep abysses from which hidden baleful energies surged forth, mingling with stone, fire, and earth as they spread across the land.

The black flames in Li Zhouwei’s eyes grew more intense. The light from the Radiant Sun King's Halberd in his hand pulsed, brightening and dimming as if breathing in excitement.

‘The earth element shattered. Above, it formed mist and heavenly light; below, springs of baleful energy… Cheng Yan is finished.’

Si Yuanli looked on with his head lowered, unsurprised.

He and Li Zhouwei had discussed this earlier. As a figure of the new dynasty, Si Yuanli couldn't act rashly. Even lending a Spiritual Treasure was a risk. He had only agreed because of his clan’s excellent relationship with the Li Family in recent years, and his desire for this immortal mountain.

Si Yuanli’s earlier provocations were no mere squabble; they were entirely deliberate. He wanted Cheng Yan to die here and now, so the essence of his Wu Earth cultivation would descend upon this place, adding to the glory of his future mountain sect. Li Zhouwei naturally saw through his scheme. With both of them present and several Spiritual Treasures suppressing the area, Cheng Yan couldn’t have caused much trouble even if he had tried to commit suicide. But while his suicide would be a small matter, Li Zhouwei couldn’t afford to lose him.

He had come here with the intent to shatter this mountain and destroy this sect, all to cultivate his Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts. The Changxiao Gate, though not ancient, had a deep foundation and a resounding reputation—it was the perfect nourishment. With this tempering, the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts would become more than just a minor technique.

His entire plan was designed so the world would witness him capture Cheng Yan alive, then execute him before his own sect gate. The execution and the mountain’s destruction had to overlap. If Cheng Yan killed himself, where would the spectacle be? It was for this very reason that he had to placate Cheng Yan first, only to kill him personally.

‘Besides… since he was said to use demonic methods, perhaps killing him will grant me some immortal merit…’

Li Zhouwei stood amidst the rolling Heavenly Glow, watching the baleful energy roil through the mountains and the beasts flee in terror, a different thought taking root in his mind.

He knew he would have to face Wu Earth cultivators sooner or later, and his fight with Cheng Yan had been an invaluable observation. The gains were immense.

‘Wu Earth truly is flawless. Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light fared better, but my Emperor Qi's Light, being an auxiliary Bright Yang art, was significantly weakened when it struck the Wu Earth… the suppression was even more severe!’

He had sensed it the moment the enemy used his divine ability to block Emperor Qi's Light. He had immediately become vigilant, but understood the importance of timing. He had poured his dharma power in recklessly to overwhelm the opposing divine ability. It was fortunate that Cheng Yan’s courage had already failed him… otherwise, if the fight had dragged on, Emperor Qi's Light might not have been able to overcome his Wu Earth.

‘The Wei Emperor has been assailed for so many years… the Bright Yang has definitely been damaged. But since he hasn’t completely fallen from his position, the damage is internal and not yet externally visible… This deficit is especially apparent in the auxiliary arts. The day he is truly pulled down… both the primary and auxiliary arts will be suppressed by the Wu Earth’s Heavenly Glow.’

As he was thinking, he felt the spiritual energy in the world fluctuate, accompanied by a faint, distant boom. The black flames within him surged, and he knew that the Changxiao Gate below could hold out no longer. As expected, he heard Si Yuanli exclaim, “Eh?”

He glanced over, raised his hand, and the Stormshatter Wedges transformed back into streaks of silver light, returning to his palm. Si Yuanli offered his congratulations. “Congratulations, Your Highness!”

“And congratulations to you, Daoist friend.”

Li Zhouwei closed his eyes for a moment, not hurrying to descend. Black flames billowed from his body as he exhaled deeply, feeling the feedback from the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts. He held up the Grand Ascension, his halberd, and gave it a gentle toss.

The long halberd hovered above the sect gate, spewing jets of black flame. Only then did he pass through the Great Void and descend slowly into the Changxiao Gate’s domain.

The violent lightning storm receded, and the silver brilliance over Mount Changxiao finally faded, revealing the spiritually rich immortal mountain. The once colorful, elegant immortal pavilions and halls seemed to be coated in a layer of gray dust. Cultivators cowered on their knees between buildings and on stairways, not daring to move. Others took to the air, attempting to flee, while still others raised their dharma artifacts to fight the Li Family cultivators descending from the sky.

The four gleaming golden characters for "Changxiao of the Western Rite" on the jade gate at the mountain’s base were now dull and lifeless. The golden-eyed youth paused before the gate, and roiling black flames instantly erupted from thin air, sweeping up the stairs.

He walked up the mountain step by step. Where he passed, Heavenly Light blazed and black flames surged. The trees were unharmed, but the pavilions collapsed one by one. The cultivators who were still resisting were engulfed by the black flames, which clung to them like talismans before they exploded with a deafening boom.

Rows of warriors in white armor marched in, moving methodically through the various pavilions and terraces, rounding up the ashen-faced and bewildered members of the Changxiao Gate. The only sounds on the mountain were the clash of armor and soft weeping.

By the time the youth reached the summit, the entire sect was in ruins and had been pacified. A torrent of invisible black flame shot into the sky. Li Minggong stood silently at his side, casting a cold gaze upon the people gathered on the peak.

“We pay our respects to you, my lord!”

The summit was still in chaos, but the Changxiao Gate cultivators who had opened the formation had already established preliminary control. The white-templed elder was held down by two peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, forced to kneel at his feet. A man in black robes beside them didn’t dare to look at him, shuffling forward on his knees and saying respectfully, “My lord… the sect master of the Changxiao Gate, this white-templed elder, is here!”

Li Zhouwei’s gaze fell upon him, recognizing the old man at once. He scanned the surroundings, but before he could speak, the man in black robes raised an eyebrow and ordered his men to push open the doors of the great hall behind them. “The white-templed elder’s mortal family… is in the Prefecture. His disciples who cultivated on the mountain are all here!”

Inside the hall, five cultivators were bound, their six senses sealed. They lay on the floor like corpses and were dragged forward and thrown to the ground.

“Helin Prefecture has already surrendered to the righteous path! He has clan members in the Prefecture as well. Please, my lord, give us a chance to identify them all, so that we may hunt them down and ensure the wicked are brought to justice!”

At these words, the white-templed elder began to sob and looked up with furious eyes, meeting the golden gaze directly. Before he could utter a curse, black flames erupted from his ears and nose. He writhed on the ground, his body emitting plumes of black smoke, but a divine ability kept him alive, denying him even the release of death.

In an instant, his horrific screams filled the mountain. The crowd lowered their heads in terror. The crackling of the flames seemed to grow louder as the Daoist Master said calmly, “There are others.”

When he was besieged at Lake Xian, there were six of them. Yunan Zi was slain by him, the Daoist from the Zhuang clan was killed by his gaze in the market just now, and the white-templed elder was here. That left three more.

But the man in black robes was prepared. Another old man was immediately dragged from the crowd and thrown down before him. Not daring to look up, the man in black said quickly, “My lord, there were three others that day. One was killed overseas, and another perished while attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Only this old fool remains, having made no progress… still clinging to life here!”

The old man’s eyes were filled with despair. Before he could speak, the Daoist Master before him gently parted his lips and blew out a breath of purple flame, incinerating the old man to ash. Only then did the Daoist Master step past the screaming white-templed elder and look at Li Minggong, his voice somewhat hoarse.

“That day, I borrowed an ancestor’s treasured sword. The sword was drawn, yet it could not kill. It was a great disrespect. Take this man back to the lake and execute him before the sword to appease our ancestor’s spirit.”

“Yes!” Li Minggong bowed, a hint of joy touching her lips. Her eyes still held a look of disbelieving horror, and she too did not dare to look directly at him.

Li Zhouwei then turned his gaze to the man in black robes.

The man immediately began to kowtow, tears streaming down his face. “My lord… my lord… my name is Wu Fan, a native of Jingchuan… I was brought here to cultivate as a child. I have heard of your mighty reputation!”

He raised his hands, presenting a grayish-white token, about a foot long and carved with swirling clouds. He cried out, “This is the secret command token of the Changxiao Gate’s sect master… a treasure of the lineage, presented to you, my lord!”

He was terrified, yet his chest swelled with greedy delight. He felt the token leave his palm. When no sound followed for a long moment, he cautiously raised his head.

The man before him stood amidst surging black flames. It might have been an illusion, but the lord seemed taller than when he had arrived. He stood like a colossus, his face covered in golden patterns looking down. Wu Fan, prostrate on the ground, felt as though he couldn't even reach the man’s knee.

Those golden eyes narrowed, the black flames within them raging. The claw-like hand slowly tightened, and a powder-like silver light trickled from between his fingers. His shadow fell over everyone.

“Where are the sect’s spiritual and Daoist treasuries?”




# Chapter 1016: The Two Rites

The veil-like silver light drifted down, and Wu Fan's gaze lowered as if scalded. The dread in his heart expanded rapidly, and he began kowtowing with a frantic thump-thump-thump, his voice trembling with fear.

"Reporting… reporting, my lord… the twenty-seven peaks of the Changxiao Gate's Classic Treasury have been seized by the Immortal Clan's heavenly soldiers. This lowly one did not dare to take control. The remaining… the remaining seven vaults and six storerooms are under the Daoist Masters' direct management and are located at the base of the formation."

"As for the twelve remaining Spiritual Vaults, their keys were originally held by the Immortal Peaks… but… but…"

Wu Fan raised his eyebrows slightly, as if unsure whether he should speak, a look of fear and difficulty on his face. However, the Li Zhouwei before him had already stepped inside, reaching the highest point of the mountain gate, the Immortal Hall.

On either side, a white jade Treasured Vase was placed. Six great columns were arranged in a single line, adorned with a series of folding screens, all inscribed with golden characters. At the very top was a mystical Daoist painting, with a silver-patterned background. In the center was a faceless man in golden robes, gently holding a Treasured Vase.

'Though it's not a Spiritual Artifact or a dharma artifact, the materials used are of very high quality. Having hung for so long, it's gained a bit of divine charm… but it's a pity it was painted by the Changxiao himelf and isn't a true ancient heirloom. Its usefulness is limited.'

Above this painting, a golden plaque was inscribed with four large characters: Upper Rite Celestial Empyrean.

Li Zhouwei was very familiar with these four characters. Back when he was in the Wanling Heaven, he once visited Clear Rite Peak, where he saw these exact same four characters!

When he saw the words "Changxiao of the Western Rite" at the base of the mountain, he had already suspected they were part of the same Daoist Tradition. Now, it was confirmed beyond a doubt. The four characters at the foot of the mountain were likely the name of the tradition that Changxiao had established for itself, an offshoot of the Upper Rite Celestial Empyrean.

Seeing Li Zhouwei pause here, Wu Fan hurried forward, only to be stopped by Li Minggong's outstretched hand. The woman bowed slightly, took a step forward, and removed the painting from the beam, placing it carefully inside a jade box.

The moment the Daoist painting was put into the jade box, the entire Immortal Hall lost its luster. The flowing, radiant mystic columns and Treasured Vases all dimmed. The great hall, which had been bright with its own light, was now only illuminated by the lamps.

Outside the hall, faint sobs could be heard, but Wu Fan paid them no mind. He whispered in a low voice:

"The Lady of the Inner Quarters, Guiqin, has handled the sect's affairs for many years. She likes to inquire about the vaults and borrows the keys to keep them safe. The old geezer with the white hair, to curry favor with the Daoist Master and keep his position, feigned ignorance… All matters concerning the Spiritual Vaults passed through the Lady's peak… We… we truly do not know!"

He had seized the sect carelessly from the old geezer, and despite having some ability, he had waited for the Li family to invade the peaks. By then, he could no longer manage the sect's affairs. More fatally, he truly did not dare to provoke the Lady Guiqin.

The Daoist Master Cheng Yan in the sky seemed to be done for, but who knew what methods a Daoist Master might have to escape? Would there really be a life-and-death struggle between Daoist Masters? If Cheng Yan were to suddenly reappear after a while and surrender to the lake, having meddled with a Daoist Master's inner circle, would he still have a life to live?

"The Lady of the Inner Quarters…"

His words caused a stir among the crowd, who clearly held some resentment, though they usually dared not express it. Li Zhouwei glanced at him, then at Li Minggong. The woman nodded and whispered:

"This woman has been confined to a side peak by us."

Only then did Li Zhouwei look at Wu Fan and say, "Follow."

The man straightened up, letting out a long sigh of relief. His confidence returned. He sidled forward, and in a single step, all three of them appeared at the palace on the side peak. Wu Fan, with his head bowed and eyes lowered, began to answer:

"Reporting, my lord, the Lady of the Inner Quarters' surname is Ma. She is Daoist Master Cheng Yan's biological older sister. She has a son and a daughter of her own, though she's raised many foster sons. Her biological son died in the Eastern Sea, and the others work within the sect. The remaining daughter serves at her side… they're all in the same place…"

The palace gates creaked open, revealing a hall filled with large and small, multicolored silks, gently swaying in the breeze. It was a beautiful place, yet it was filled with mournful wailing.

Amidst the flying silks, two women were embracing and weeping before the hall. One had a round face and elegant eyebrows, was draped in white silk, and had skin as white as snow, arousing a feeling of pitiful sympathy in all who saw her. However, having cultivated Cold Qi, she also possessed a noble air of untouchable dignity. Her expression was full of grief, her eyes glistening with tears.

In her arms, she held a girl, small and lovely, with a rosy face and a golden robe. Her pale red lips were tightly pursed, and her eyes were fixed on the steps below. She barely turned her head when she heard the sound from the front of the hall, but she did not dare to look up.

Wu Fan felt a burst of satisfaction. In the past, this mother and daughter had stomped all over him, and he hadn't dared to resist. Now they had fallen to this. He followed Li Minggong inside and roared,

"Where are the Spiritual Keys!"

The Lady Guiqin looked up with hatred, her tear-filled eyes staring at him without a word. She possessed a naturally aloof elegance. Li Minggong was a beauty of the first order, but she couldn't replicate the mother and daughter's charming, delicate frowns, and for a moment, she was outshone.

Wu Fan, eager to please, didn't care about pitying her. He kicked the woman on the shoulder, making her grunt in pain. But the Lady Guiqin still wouldn't speak. Wu Fan immediately drew his sword, and for a time, shouts, curses, and the thudding of blows filled the air, mingled with endless weeping.

Li Minggong couldn't stand it any longer. She casually swept the man aside and stood to the side. Li Zhouwei stepped forward, bent slightly, and pinched the woman's chin, forcing her to look up and meet his eyes.

When the Lady Guiqin met his golden pupils, she was suddenly stunned. The intense hatred in her eyes melted like ice and snow, transforming in an instant into a soaring, bewildered joy. She hurriedly turned over, spread her legs, and exposed her throat, a sweet, humming laugh escaping her lips.

"My lord… my lord… the Spiritual Keys are in the secret formation beneath the host's seat… my lord…"

This scene sent a shiver of alarm through Wu Fan. A powerful dread surged within him, and he fought the urge for his legs to turn to jelly. Unsure of the lord's thoughts, he knelt beside the woman, wanting to help her up.

But the instant her words fell, the hand that had been holding her chin suddenly left. The Lady Guiqin's head detached from her neck, floating lightly upwards without a single drop of blood. It then rolled neatly into his hand.

The sweet red lips were still opening and closing, her gaze seductive. The cross-section of her neck was smooth and clean, as if cut by an extremely sharp dharma artifact. The man held the head in a daze. The small girl who had been facing him simultaneously fell backward, her head rolling down and coming to rest by his knees.

The man was speechless for a moment, kneeling on the ground in a stupor. The fear in his heart reached its peak. He suddenly realized that a smiling man in a green robe had appeared beside him at some point. The man gently patted his shoulder.

"Get up."

Wu Fan stood up, trembling. The green-robed man smiled at Li Zhouwei, as if explaining.

"They are, after all, of the Purple Mansion Realm bloodline. Let them have a proper end."

Wu Fan belatedly realized the truth: 'This Daoist Master was here the whole time. My mortal eyes simply couldn't see him.'

Li Zhouwei didn't care. If he weren't worried about revealing the Immortal Mirror, he wouldn't have bothered asking the Lady Guiqin anything… Seeing that Si Yuanli wanted to use this Wu Fan, using both threats and persuasion, he was too lazy to go through the trouble.

'How to deal with the Changxiao Gate and its remnants is Si Yuanli's business. He has no one under him, and Wu Fan is clearly useful.'

He flipped his hand and took out the Spiritual Keys from under the host's seat, tossing them to Li Minggong. He nodded to Si Yuanli, and the two of them vanished together, leaving Li Minggong standing alone.

"My lord…"

Wu Fan quickly turned, asking respectfully. Li Minggong shook her head. Several cultivators strode in from outside the great hall. A tall young man with a golden gaze and a long saber at his waist led the way, stopping in the hall and greeting Li Minggong.

The woman's gaze swept over him.

"I'll leave this to you."

Just by looking at his golden pupils, Wu Fan knew he was of noble and extraordinary standing. He hurried forward and said with a fawning smile:

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

---

Inside a deep cave-dwelling within the mountain, the light flickered. Silver formation patterns covered the walls. The two Daoist Masters walked in and stopped before the formation. Si Yuanli looked up, and as he took out a talisman from his sleeve, he used his other hand to lightly pinch and draw out a sliver of silver light.

It was the Stormshatter Wedges.

He smiled casually and said, "Since the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella has been given to my fellow Daoist, I will take the Wu Bloom Pearl… a senior of mine happens to have a use for it."

Si Yuanli clearly had some methods. Logically, with the two Daoist Masters not yet returned, the people of the sect should only be able to open the outer formation. Yet, even as he spoke, he was already slowly unlocking the inner formation.

The Changxiao were not cultivators of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, and they did not have the custom of setting up inner formations within palaces. The formation was not large, with the seven vaults and six storerooms separated and stored, appearing extremely organized.

Si Yuanli, however, laughed.

"Old Man Changxiao is too cunning; he wouldn't leave anything good for you or me. Let's check Cheng Yan's vault."

Li Zhouwei nodded and lightly beckoned. A golden stream of light already returned from the Great Void and landed in his palm. It was a scroll with a storage bag attached.

He casually patted it, and the contents of the storage bag poured out with a clatter, instantly covering the cave-dwelling with layers of spiritual objects, gleaming with light. There were hardly any spiritual stones to be seen.

Li Zhouwei swept his gaze over them, then lightly beckoned again. Seven streams of light separated from the rest, arranging themselves in a line on the table. The dense jade slips remained on the ground—these would be opened by the cultivators of the Changxiao Gate.

He then used his palm as a blade, sliding it left and right, and seemingly casually, he divided the remaining two piles of spiritual objects.

Of the seven streams of light, three were jade bottles filled with spiritual pills. Li Zhouwei himself was not lacking in such items, so he looked at the remaining four. When he opened one of the jade boxes, the first thing that caught his eye was a pale white, mystic-veined round stone.

Si Yuanli glanced at it and laughed.

"It's something from the Anhuai Heaven. This fellow had quite a few gains back then. This is the 'True Qi' spiritual resource, the Crane-Embrace Stone. Its best use is for lower-level cultivators to nurture it in their Sea of Qi to aid in their practice. It can also greatly increase their speed when riding the wind, allowing cultivators with average talent to stand out among their peers. It's useless for us to consume it… though it could be used to adorn a pair of spiritual boots."

The remaining three items were a scroll and two spiritual resources. One was a 'True Qi' resource, the Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf, a good treasure for healing injuries. It was a deep green color, and its leaves were covered with dense, stone-like patterns. It had already taken root in the jade box and was silently breathing. Unfortunately, one branch had already been plucked, leaving only two. The medicinal properties were subtly draining away.

Si Yuanli looked on in pained regret and cursed.

"What a beast! He couldn't refine pills himself, and he wouldn't find someone to do it, so what's the use of just eating it raw?… At least he knew to use a jade box to store it, or it would have dissipated long ago."

Li Zhouwei carefully examined it and found some Bright Yang Qi on it. He figured the man had consumed it while under his own divine ability, and so he let it go. However, the last spiritual resource was a 'Dawn Qi', half-gold and half-white like water. Si Yuanli immediately took notice and laughed.

"The 'Bright Yang', as one of the three Yangs, controls Li Fire and does not favor 'Dawn Qi'. On the contrary, Upright Wood finds it useful… How about you give this to me? I'll give you the Crane-Embrace Stone, and the Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf can be handed over to fellow Daoist Zhaojing for pill-refining."

"Fine."

When Li Zhouwei had asked Si Yuanli for his help, they had agreed to split Cheng Yan's belongings equally. The matter was settled easily. Li Zhouwei picked up the scroll and found that it was locked by a secret preservation art, making it difficult to open. It was quite a novelty, and he couldn't help but look at it a few more times. Si Yuanli also raised his eyebrows.

"It's an ancient item, using a secret preservation method that's even more troublesome than a jade slip's lock. If you can't open this thing… it'll just turn into a blank scroll."

"Oh? A secret preservation method? Since you can break formations, do you have a way to open it?"

Li Zhouwei paid careful attention, listening as Si Yuanli sighed.

"I won't hide anything. My ancestors had some methods and cultivated the 'Renewing Wood' Dao. They left behind some means to break formations, but this thing has a 'Binding Lock' mark on it. You'd need to find a 'Vault Metal' cultivator. Where can you find such a person these days?"

Li Zhouwei knew about 'Vault Metal' cultivators, but he raised an eyebrow, deliberately trying to probe his background. He asked, "I wonder how powerful this dao lineage is?"

Si Yuanli didn't think too much and lamented.

"I only know one thing: the Xie family has a treasure called the Profound-Tracking River-gazing Stone. It belongs to the 'Vault Metal' Dao. Inside it, there is an extremely rare Metallic Essence, the 'Hidden Uncarved Daoist Vault Essence', which is the 'Vault Metal' metallic essence. It may not be one-of-a-kind in the world, but even the great lords have very few of them."

Li Zhouwei was deep in thought and was about to speak when he suddenly looked up.

"_Crack…_"

With a crisp sound, one of the seven vaults and six storerooms of the Changxiao Gate was revealed. A great rush of white vapor poured out. In the very center was a Treasured Vase, clearly displaying the colorful radiance of a treasure. Si Yuanli asked:

"My lord, are you interested in the 'Upper Rite' dao?"

Li Zhouwei replied, "My fellow Daoist, please take a look."

Si Yuanli smiled amiably and glanced at the jade bottle, replying, "It should be an 'Upper Rite' spiritual object, used for collecting Qi."

"The 'Upper Rite' belongs to the Twelve Qi. Among them, it's known for being 'late to prosper, early to vanish, suspended and isolated.' There was once a ruling Imperial scion of the Great Zhou who obtained the Golden Core through this and thus flourished. Later, this lord's whereabouts became a mystery, and the 'Upper Rite' Dao also faded. The difficulty of this Dao… is actually in its spiritual objects."

"My Daoist Tradition mentioned that nearly ninety percent of the spiritual qi of the 'Upper Rite' needs to be gathered through a specific spiritual object. This is commonly known as the 'Spirit-Enclosing Method'. Usually, by securing this set of special spiritual objects, a dao lineage can be established. When the world changes or the spiritual objects are lost, the lineage withers."

Li Zhouwei immediately understood. He had once obtained the Essence-Gathering Profound Origin Art in the Wanling Heaven, which used the spiritual object Mystic Banquet Nectar to gather Qi.

And he himself had a 'Attaining Brightness' from the 'Upper Rite' that his grand-uncle had obtained from Daoist Master Yuanbian. The Qi-gathering method used Daoist Master Yuanbian's spiritual object, the 'Luminous-Empyrean Scroll-Cloud'. Naturally, this spiritual object would not be given to him. Liu Changdie had not specifically gone to collect it, but had it collected by his own people in the Qunyi Archipelago and then sent to him.

He was lost in thought, but Si Yuanli sighed.

"There are actually many such traditions, but none are as demanding as this 'Upper Rite' Dao, which requires ninety percent of its spiritual objects. For example, 'True Fire' often needs a spiritual flame to gather Qi, but the difficulty of this Dao lies in being 'suspended and isolated.' It doesn't connect well with others, and there are no particularly close traditions. If you want to configure its spiritual objects… without some special methods, it is incredibly difficult. Moreover, with the 'floating nature of the Heavenly Empyrean,' these spiritual objects are not easy to preserve, which is why they have fallen to this state."

He said with a serious expression, "There's actually a corresponding Dao. My Daoist Tradition isn't very clear on it, but based on the correspondence, it's called the 'Lower Rite'. I heard it was taken over by the Underworld long ago, so it's not just rare; it's only slightly better than 'Exiled Qi'!"

He was deliberately trying to curry favor, and Li Zhouwei was quite pleased, nodding his head.

'The Twelve Qi seem to be complete…'

Li Zhouwei's thoughts raced. He considered, 'Que'Wan's Houshenshu once mentioned that she could modulate the Qi of the Two Rites. Does she mean the two Upper and Lower Rites of the Twelve Qi? If so, the relationship between 'Whole Pill' and Encompassing Profoundity is not shallow either!'

The Underworld is an obvious Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition. That means the Upper and Lower Rites are both Encompassing Profoundity positions. But why did the Underworld, an Encompassing Profoundity tradition, push for the fall of the Wanling Heaven and not care at all?

This was a profound matter that Li Zhouwei would pay close attention to. Si Yuanli had already taken out the jade bottle and asked, "The 'Upper Rite' dao lineage must still be on the Changxiao. I think he was afraid of alerting Cheng Yan and deliberately left one or two spiritual resources here to collect Qi… My fellow Daoist, do you know the use of this thing?"

# Chapter 1017: The Sima Family

Si Yuanli presented the jade bottle to Li Zhouwei. The golden-eyed young man peered inside, observing a clear, brownish-yellow vapor that churned and roiled as if struggling to break free.

Li Zhouwei had once obtained the Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise in Wanling Heaven, a text that detailed methods for refining treasured vases. It had stringent requirements for spiritual resources of the Upper Rite, so the material was not difficult for him to recognize. He raised an eyebrow.

“This is Radiant Spirit-Vessel. Though it’s called a spiritual resource, it isn’t exactly pure. It’s a refined essence created by blending several Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources, and it must be stored in a vessel like this. It can sharpen the mind and maintain peak spiritual states, making it useful for practicing spell arts. There are two portions here… As for whether one can harvest its qi, that depends on their Daoist tradition.”

This was clearly not the answer Si Yuanli had been hoping for. His gaze fell, a flicker of disappointment replaced by a hint of suspicion.

‘He’s so familiar with this, yet just a moment ago he was asking me about the ways of the Upper Rite? He was probably testing me!’

He forced a smile and said aloud, “So, fellow Daoist, you also have some inheritance from an Upper Rite dao lineage. My shallow insights must have seemed like a joke to you.”

Li Zhouwei casually put the spiritual resource away, his eyes carefully scanning the cave-dwelling.

“Every family's dao lineage is different,” he said nonchalantly.

“I've only read a treatise or two, so I can recognize a few things. It can't compare to the comprehensive inheritance of a noble family like yours.”

He was speaking the truth, though whether Si Yuanli believed him was another matter. As they spoke, the sound of another formation shattering echoed, followed by a surge of roiling white mist. The space behind it was empty, save for flashes of crackling lightning. Si Yuanli had to raise a divine ability to dissolve the lingering restrictions.

“The Stormshatter Wedges are too violent for breaking formations,” he explained, a bit embarrassed.

“They’re fast, but they often leave behind residual restrictions that require extra work.”

The place was proving to be quite troublesome. Liu Changdie was unwilling to come to the mainland, making it difficult to find someone to handle this. Si Yuanli’s willingness to put in the effort saved Li Zhouwei considerable time. As Li Zhouwei took a seat to the side, Li Minggong strode in.

“Reporting to the Daoist Master,” she said in a low voice, “the Changxiao Gate has been secured. All the dao lineages have been gathered, their protections broken one by one, and moved into the cave-dwelling. The various spiritual items have been stored on the flying vessel. Everything is in order!”

The Li family’s efficiency was impressive, and with Wu Fan guiding them, Changxiao Gate’s resources were plundered in short order.

Li Zhouwei nodded. “Let Daoist Master Qinghu hear this as well.”

Li Minggong continued her report. “The Changxiao Gate possessed three Purple Mansion Realm dao lineages, all of them fourth-grade. They are the Vast Mountain on Earth Classic, which cultivates Wu Earth and leads to Immortal Without Flaw; the Responding Stone Glazed Light Classic, which cultivates True Qi and the ‘Stone-Embracing Slumber’ foundation; and the Cold Snow Lonely Peak Classic, which cultivates Cold Qi and the ‘Snow on the Pine’ foundation.”

“There are also two fourth-grade spell arts. The first is the Mountain-Offering Stone-Splitting Art, an offensive technique for Wu Earth. The second is the Cold Light Scenery-Proclaiming Formula, a Cold Qi spell art.”

She raised her hand, five golden jade slips resting in her palm. “The remaining dozen or so texts are still sealed. We are interrogating prisoners for the method to open them, but according to our cultivators’ observations, none of them appear to be Purple Mansion Realm grade. I fear the harvest from them will be meager.”

Si Yuanli listened with a sense of wonder. A fourth-grade spell art would be a prize for the direct lineage of an ordinary Purple Mansion Realm family. But for the Li family, cultivation methods and spell arts were hardly rare. Li Zhouwei was visibly disappointed.

“It seems we won’t find any Upper Rite Daoist traditions among these peaks,” he said with a frown. “Changxiao had fifth-grade, perhaps even sixth-grade Dharma Arts, but he clearly never passed them down to his disciples. No wonder Changxiao Gate had such a grand reputation but so few astonishing talents… There was only Wang Fu… and the path he cultivated was a dead end.”

Si Yuanli arched an eyebrow and smiled. “How could they compare to the closeness of a noble family? A so-called sect is a messy affair of tangled relations and crafty associates. Even a master with the best intentions has to hold something back to keep his disciples respectful, to say nothing of a cruel and cunning man like Changxiao.”

“There will always be flaws. The problem lies with people, that’s all.”

Li Zhouwei shook his head. Li Minggong waited for their conversation to pause before speaking again.

“Si Xunhui has arrived on the mountain with his men.”

This mountain was to be handed over to the Sima Family; the delay had been an intentional gesture to give the Li family time to collect the spoils. Li Zhouwei immediately looked at Li Minggong.

“Bind all of Cheng Yan’s relatives, associates, and disciples. Let him watch as they are dealt with.”

With a formidable enemy looming in the north, the Li family could not linger. His words were a clear signal to transfer control of the mountain. Li Minggong nodded and withdrew. Si Yuanli smiled faintly as another crash echoed through the air. This time, it seemed a critical point had been breached. The already fragile inner formation began to tremble violently, threatening to collapse at any moment.

Si Yuanli quickly retrieved an item from his robes. It was a palm-sized piece of greenish-blue spirit wood. He pressed it into the formation, and the violent shaking instantly ceased. With a delicate flick of his finger, the contents within flowed out like water and arranged themselves neatly on the table.

Silver and white objects lay scattered, their profound patterns shimmering: one scroll, one jade slip, one jade box, two talismans, and four jade bottles.

Only then did Li Zhouwei nod in satisfaction. “Thank you for your trouble, fellow Daoist!” he said with a smile.

“It was no trouble at all!” Si Yuanli replied, but he seemed to want to say more, ultimately just shaking his head with a smile. Li Zhouwei paid him no mind, his gaze sweeping over the scroll.

The scroll was silver-white, its texture and form vastly different from the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll he had seen before, clearly an ancient artifact. He gave it a light shake, and it unrolled to reveal six large, silver characters:

Tome of Subjugating the Murky Mountain

A quick scan told Li Zhouwei it was a Wu Earth technique and the source of Cheng Yan’s Art-Suppressing, Light-Quelling Wu Brilliance. That brilliant light had been exceptionally powerful, likely fifth-grade, so its origins were indeed extraordinary.

‘Cheng Yan didn't have this on him, so I don't have to split it with Si Yuanli...’

The jade slip, of course, could not be opened, which was a persistent headache. The two talismans were the same Form-Dissolving Mind-Shift Talismans Cheng Yan had used before. Of the four pills in the bottles, only one Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill was noteworthy; the other three were Wu Earth pills and would be difficult to sell.

The jade box contained a piece of Bound Heart-Ice, a spiritual resource of the Cold Qi path. It wasn't priceless, but it was exceedingly rare and could be used to quell inner demons and dispel fire poison. If submerged in a spring, it could produce Unfallen Rain Cold Water, a Foundation Establishment Realm resource. It was arguably the most valuable item among the lot.

He collected everything, making a quick assessment.

‘It really was picked clean, but at least Cheng Yan wasn't completely destitute…’

Beside him, Si Yuanli looked utterly dejected. “Cheng Yan used a treasure called the Yongjing Profound Ring… it wasn't on him during the fight, and I had hoped it might be in his treasury. In the end, it seems Changxiao took it. There was also a Heart-Cultivating Celestial Instrument Stone, a treasure that can be used to refine a second body. That’s missing as well…”

Now Li Zhouwei understood what he had been searching for. He chuckled and shook his head, his gaze falling upon the piece of green wood holding the inner formation stable. “And this is…?”

The mountain was being given to Si Yuanli, but Li Zhouwei had not been generous enough to include the Purple Mansion Realm grand formation. He wouldn’t give him the chance to tamper with it. The question was direct.

“The core of this Purple Mansion grand formation is hidden deep within,” Si Yuanli explained, shaking his head. “Without the owner’s command token, we can’t touch it. I shattered the inner arrays and used this Displacing Mulberry Wood to deceive the formation core. Otherwise, the entire system would have destabilized.”

Li Zhouwei smiled faintly. “It seems this formation won’t be so easy to acquire.”

This Purple Mansion grand formation was valuable, even better than the one over their own lake. Yet, the Li family had no intention of using it. For one, they simply lacked the energy to go through such a massive undertaking again. Secondly… this was Changxiao’s grand formation. Who would dare to use it without worry? Without a complete and total overhaul, no one would feel safe cultivating within it. And after such a modification, who knew how much of its power would remain?

‘If our family’s grand formation by the lake ever needs replacing… we would build a new one ourselves, dismantle the old one, and then move this one over… what difference would it make?’

Si Yuanli had reached the same conclusion. Although Upper Rite didn’t conflict with Upright Wood, his family was wealthy. Rather than waste materials on risky modifications, it was far more reassuring and comfortable to build his own. Hearing Li Zhouwei’s words, he grasped the implication immediately.

“I will dismantle it for you, fellow Daoist!”

A Purple Mansion grand formation required immense resources and effort to create. Even with the formation core from Profound Peak, the Li family had spent a fortune in spiritual materials back then. Li Zhouwei nodded and stepped outside with him.

“I will leave some men here,” he said softly. “You may command them as you see fit. However, the formation core is precious. Once the disassembly is complete, I must trouble you to deliver it to us!”

Si Yuanli would be using this mountain gate himself, so he didn’t mind the extra work. He nodded with a smile. For once, Li Zhouwei returned his smile warmly before his gaze shifted.

“Now that you have a mountain gate to call your own, the Sima Family’s prospects will surely change.”

Si Yuanli began forming a Dharma Art, seemingly adjusting the outer formation. Streams of white mist flowed past, but the sky above remained clear. Unconcerned, he continued manipulating the spell art.

“Back on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, I asked fellow Daoist Zhaojing about a mountain gate,” he said in a low voice. “It was merely a preliminary step. I was waiting for the dust to settle before approaching you and the Chen Clan.”

“I had assumed the Li Clan would remain protective of its territory by the lake and wouldn’t take the lead in external affairs… I never imagined Your Highness would be so decisive. Crossing the Mushroom Forest Plains overnight to slay Cheng Yan… it must have caused an uproar in Wu and Yue.”

While capturing the Changxiao Gate was cause for celebration, and Si Yuanli was genuinely pleased, he also had many regrets. The affair had been too sudden for the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. It wasn't just Cheng Yan who was caught off guard; Si Yuanli was as well.

Changxiao Gate was always going to be made an example of. According to Si Yuanli’s plan, once the larger situation had stabilized, the Sima Family would have taken the lead, uniting the Chen and Li clans to annihilate Changxiao.

In that scenario, it would have been Si Yuanli who conquered Changxiao. The mountain gate would have been his by right. If the Purple Mansion grand formation could be preserved, even better. The remaining spiritual treasures would have been generously divided between the other two families, fostering goodwill.

Although the outcome was the same, the one who took the lead was different, which put Si Yuanli in an awkward position. The Li Clan had indeed promised him the mountain gate, but they would never give him a magnificent Purple Mansion grand formation for free!

Therefore, when the Li family had urgently sought him out, Si Yuanli had been utterly shocked. Who could have predicted such an aggressive move? After the initial shock came hesitation, and in that moment, he understood the stakes. No matter what schemes he might devise, with the two families now appearing as close as fire, how could he possibly refuse? And even if he had refused, would that have stopped Li Zhouwei? At worst, Cheng Yan might have escaped. Once Changxiao Gate fell, Si Yuanli would have been left with nothing—not the mountain gate, not a single benefit.

And if he had somehow acquired the mountain gate later, with Cheng Yan having escaped, what would he do with all the disciples left behind? Kill them or spare them?

Sometimes, a shift in circumstance, a simple matter of who acts first, determines who is the host and who is the guest. That single difference had cost him a Purple Mansion grand formation—enough to keep an ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator busy for decades. Even for someone as ridiculously wealthy as Si Yuanli, the loss was a painful sting.

Yet his thoughts ran deep, and his demeanor had remained perfectly natural from start to finish. He had only requested an even split of Changxiao’s wealth. But the regret in his heart compelled him to ask these questions.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him, his expression noncommittal. He answered candidly, “The Li Clan seeks vengeance, and so do I. The Li Clan seeks self-preservation, but I seek the Dao. He was right about one thing: if not my family, it would have been another. It was just his misfortune that it was me.”

Si Yuanli fell silent, pondering the weight of Li Zhouwei’s words and how the Sima Family should position itself in the future. After a long moment, he looked up.

‘The great tree that is the White Qilin has grown strong enough to offer shelter. Though it may fall one day, for now, it stands firm.’

That was a problem for the Li Clan to worry about. Si Yuanli would not concern himself with it. He would simply take one step at a time, looking ever upward.

The faint, dripping sound of blood reached his ears. Si Yuanli put a hand to his waist, untied his green outer robe, and draped it over his arm. The golden tassels dangled, revealing the snow-white inner shirt beneath.

“My house should be established as a clan.”

Daoist Master Qinghu, Sima Yuanli, let out a breath from deep within his chest, his expression undergoing a distinct transformation.

Li Zhouwei gave him a second look, his gaze drifting absently toward the ground beneath his feet. “On my way here, I noticed that the rice in Helin Prefecture is half-ripe,” he said softly. “The disturbance to the earth veins has altered the soil’s fertility. The harvests for the next few years will be uncertain. I cannot interfere in the prefecture’s affairs, but this matter is ultimately my responsibility. My family will deliver grain; I must trouble your clan to see to its distribution.”

The golden-eyed young man lowered his gaze, the murderous aura that had clung to his brow dissipating.

“When Changxiao was here, they never went hungry. Now that I am leaving, I cannot leave them to famine.”

The tone of the conversation was no longer that of the Azure Pond Immortal Sect; it was a dialogue between two Immortal Clans. Sima Yuanli, a man of exceptional perception, raised an eyebrow.

‘A warning… or a reminder?’

But his face was all smiles as he replied earnestly, “We will handle this matter perfectly, down to the last detail!”

The two Daoist Masters stood in the light. Sima Xunhui had already led his men up the mountain. He was a handsome man to begin with, and clad in spiritual armor, he cut a truly imposing figure. Behind him was the triumphant Wu Fan. They bowed together to Sima Yuanli and Li Zhouwei.

“To the two Daoist Masters,” Sima Xunhui declared respectfully, “the divine ability has fallen! The peak lords have answered the call of radiance and joined together to eradicate the evil Dao! All have performed meritoriously. The mountain gate is now peaceful and compliant, a picture of clarity and order!”

“Excellent!” Sima Yuanli stroked his beard, his eyes slightly red. He closed them, trembling faintly.

Below the steps, the young man’s eyebrow twitched. He announced in a clear voice, “This junior congratulates the Daoist Master!”

The golden threshold of the cave-dwelling shone brilliantly, made even brighter by the divine abilities of the two men. In the mountain forest, blood dripped from the leaves, spreading into small, dark red pools on the ground.

Several pale white, cloud-patterned Daoist robes lay discarded in the woods, hastily shed by their former owners. They were twisted into mangled heaps in the bloody mire, stained and mottled. A jade crown lay upturned beside them, filled to the brim with blood.

Throughout the mountain, cultivators knelt in the spreading pools of gore. Wu Fan’s deferential voice rang out, echoing across the peaks.

“This subordinate congratulates the Daoist Master!”

# Chapter 1018: Countermeasures

The moon was a brilliant, clear disc, its bright light flowing over the bronze steps. In the clouds, the eighteen hundred long stairs appeared solemn and cold. Below the vast immortal platform with its eight gates, people stood in small groups, conversing in low voices.

A Daoist Master in robes of midnight blue ambled up the steps. His face was round and his eyes were sharp, but his expression was unreadable. He walked all the way to the highest point before finally running into someone.

The man was a monk, with a fair, clean-shaven face and an imposing aura, a dot of gold lacquer gracing the space between his brows. He was descending the steps and came to a halt directly in front of the Daoist Master, blocking his path. With his palms pressed together, he smiled.

"Daoist Bai! It has been a long time."

The young man in the midnight blue robes was none other than Bai Ziyu, Daoist Master Yehui. He swept a placid gaze over the monk and replied, "So it is Daoist Vast Cicada."

Yehui had never been one to be trifled with. Seeing the man standing squarely in his way, he let a smile touch his lips.

"Why have you come to study Buddhism in the Profound Governance Pavilion? It seems the cushions in the dharma-realm are not as comfortable as the stone tiles of this pavilion, which have you pacing about day after day."

His words were pure sarcasm, veiled insults that struck precisely at a sore spot.

The Profound Governance Pavilion was the Great Zhao's center of command for immortal cultivators. Its predecessor was the Great Liang's Seeking the Purple Pavilion. Although the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch had fallen, the Dao Lineage of the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect remained. That particular Demon Monarch had despised Buddhist cultivators; any who entered the Seeking the Purple Pavilion, regardless of their cultivation level, were forced to stand. Yet, other cultivators, no matter how weak, were at least given a cushion to sit on.

The Profound Governance Pavilion had kept this rule. Even though Vast Cicada was a Maha, he still had to stand when he met Wei Xuanyin...

The face of Maha Vast Cicada immediately darkened. But Yehui wasn't finished with him.

"I see the Sparrow Carp Fish has gained some great benefit," he said casually. 

"You share his fame for no good reason, and now you can't stand it anymore, can you?"

Vast Cicada shot him a cold look. "What kind of pure Dao Lineage is mine? How can it be compared to that demonic fiend? The White Qilin possesses radiance, but the Peacock..."

Yehui cut him off with a laugh. "The Peacock? The Peacock's ancestor was the Yuwu bird, a Great Sage in its own right. If you were Li Zhouwei... I would have no choice but to nod at your words. But what are you!"

That sentence tore away all pretense of civility. The emotion on Vast Cicada's face quickly smoothed over into a calm mask. "Your words are far from pure, Daoist," he said faintly. "You should be careful."

Seeing that he had truly angered the man, Yehui didn't provoke him further, merely offering a cold, silent smirk.

Vast Cicada was, after all, the most prominent and fastest-progressing Maha in the Great Adoration Dharma Realm in the last century. His own Capital Guard Dao Lineage was ill-suited for fighting a Maha; if it came to blows, he was truly no match. Yehui sighed inwardly.

‘The Capital Guard Dao Lineage is indeed wide open, but it has far too many vulnerabilities... A pity. For someone like me with no background, once I received this lineage, I had no choice but to walk this road no one else is willing to take.’

In the span of that thought, Vast Cicada had already departed with a flick of his sleeve. Yehui scoffed, took two steps up, and passed under the gleaming plaque of the Profound Governance Pavilion. As he entered, his eyes fell upon a large, bright silver cauldron in the center of the courtyard.

A man stood beside the grand hall, clad in a silvery, feather-like robe. His eyes were long and narrow, and his five fair fingers rested on the cauldron's edge, gently stirring the shimmering water within. Seeing Yehui approach, he turned his head and smiled.

"Ziyu, you've arrived."

Yehui hurriedly bowed with a smile and stood to the side. Wei Xuanyin chuckled and shook his head.

"Arguing with the Buddhist cultivators again. I've told you before, your Capital Guard has ties to the Radiant Qi. If something major were to happen, you could always side with the Buddhists... You are burning your bridges."

Regardless of the power dynamics in the north, Wei Xuanyin had always treated Yehui well. Bai Ziyu simply shook his head.

"I have no desire to ferry him to salvation, so he should not try to ferry me."

Whether it was an act or a genuine sentiment, Wei Xuanyin’s eyes showed a flicker of admiration for the backbone it took to say such a thing. Yehui quickly changed the subject, his tone turning serious.

"The Changxiao Gate has been annihilated, and Cheng Yan has fallen. Li Zhouwei also injured Shilou Yingge in the grotto-heaven, and that fellow didn't even bother to feign his duties any longer, fleeing straight back to the lands of Qi... Li Zhouwei has an increasing number of Spiritual Treasures now, and the typical three divine abilities are no longer enough to suppress him... Although we have four mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stationed here, we fear the Buddhist front is now vulnerable with the Sparrow Carp Fish gone. I have come on Lord Qi's orders to request your arrangements."

"The Sparrow Carp Fish."

Wei Xuanyin's expression became somewhat complex upon hearing the name. "They still underestimated the one behind him," he said. "He is, after all, a descendant of a Great Sage. He cannot be compared to the likes of Riju Yuezhu, but he can stand shoulder to shoulder with Weiming Weixi. As for those like Dongfang Tianye, they are fit only to be his stepping stones."

He was clearly aware of Li Zhouwei's situation well before Yehui, but his face still held a trace of lament. He shook his head.

"Li Zhouwei is different from the rest, which isn't strange. As for his growing number of Spiritual Treasures, that's even less surprising. Fate favors him. With a single breakthrough, the number of spiritual items in the Li Clan's hands was bound to multiply."

Although Wei Xuanyin cultivated the Veiled Yin, he was far calmer than Zong Chang. There was no malice in his tone as he asked softly, "Were the casualties high?"

Yehui shook his head, a matter he knew well. "The Li Clan's rule is strict. There were very few casualties, limited only to the Changxiao Gate."

Wei Xuanyin nodded. "The Bright Yang Dao revolves around the principle of 'I am the Monarch-Father.' He has his own logic for acting as such. He demands absolute loyalty and selflessness from his subordinates, isolating them from personal gain and self-interest. The Monarch-Father's authority reigns supreme, giving rise to loyalty and filial piety devoid of selfishness... Back then, Gongsun Yang and Qu Yi were cultivating in the mountains, but they were still dragged out by Emperor Wei to serve him loyally. It is the same principle."

"And this so-called selflessness ultimately serves the Monarch-Father's most tyrannical private desires... But at the very least... at least the common people are useful to the Monarch-Father's conquests, which makes things slightly better."

Bai Ziyu nodded along, though the last sentence made him frown inwardly. Hailing from the Eastern Sea, he found it difficult to grasp Wei Xuanyin's meaning.

‘What use is that? He is in charge of the Profound Governance Pavilion. Can he really say something that sounds like a subtle approval of the Bright Yang Dao?’

He prudently remained silent. Wei Xuanyin, however, stopped abruptly and began to ponder.

"As for Cheng Yan..."

"Emperor Wei's influence in suppressing the world cannot be erased. The Undefeated King of Brightness was a blood descendant, but the Metallic Essence he obtained was not Emperor Wei's. At best, he as a fake White Qilin. Yet with his divine abilities, he could make the Helian clan cry monster. When fighting a Bright Yang practitioner, if you can suppress them, they are easy to handle. But if they suppress you, it's nearly impossible to turn the tables, save for a few specific Dao Lineages. Cheng Yan's death was not unjust..."

"Even if he had escaped to the Eastern Sea, he would have met his end there. It's no wonder Changxiao didn't save him."

Yehui frowned slightly. "What do you mean by that?"

Wei Xuanyin smiled. "Everyone at the top knows about what happened in the grotto-heaven back then. Ping Yan of Yinzhou Island, the Purple Mansion Realm expert who works for the Dragon-kin, was once given a promise. If he could obtain that True Qi, the Dragon-kin would grant him a great opportunity."

"Though Ping Yan knew his chances were slim, he made careful preparations. To his surprise, his fortune was deep, and he actually encountered that True Qi—only for Cheng Yan to ruin it all. That is a grudge deeper than the murder of one's own parents!"

Yehui silently took this in, then asked, "Then, what about Changxiao..."

Wei Xuanyin stirred the water, watching as white runes floated to the surface. 

"The Yang family presented him with such a golden opportunity," he said faintly. 

"The Upper Rite was practically a match made in heaven for him, yet he refused to cooperate. If he truly had his sights set on Fruition Attainment, he would have joined forces with the Yang family long ago to help them gain leverage at court..."

"His leaning towards our side shows he isn't seeking Fruition Attainment. He already has an enemy related to attaining True Qi and intends to achieve his Dao in the Zhao court. He was considering slaughtering the Deer Weeds before he left, clearing out the area and destroying the Li Clan's foundation in the Eastern Sea..."

"Oh?" Yehui's brows furrowed. "Did he make a move?"

Wei Xuanyin smiled. "He waited in the Qunyi Archipelago for a while, but there were thunderstorms day after day. I believe Dongfang Heyun kept him occupied with tea, dragging things out until the Changxiao Gate was destroyed... The Dragon-kin have meddled again."

"They certainly have the gall to stoop so low!"

Seeing Changxiao's misfortune, Yehui couldn't help but feel a sense of schadenfreude.

"With Li Qinghong achieving her Dao through lightning, the Dragon-kin have a convenient excuse," he praised.

"You're mistaken." Wei Xuanyin shook his head. "It's not that simple. Li Qinghong's situation was an accident. I suspect someone was protecting her, but she holds little sway. Do you think the Dragon-kin are benevolent? The world thought they would be the first to kill Li Zhouwei. Though they have spared his life for now, it's a hollow gesture. The condition is that as long as the powers on the mountain do not protect him, the Dragon-kin will not make the first move."

"The dragons of the Eastern Sea do not harm him because they know that pushing him into the hands of the North will force someone to test the mountain's reaction... They are merely watching from the Eastern Sea, observing how much room the North has to maneuver and how much control the mountain still has over the entire northern region."

His expression was placid. "This is a dress rehearsal," he stated. "To see how many people harbor their own ambitions. On the day the heavens truly erupt in conflict... how many variables will arise in the North without the suppression of a great power from the mountain?"

"As for the Qunyi Archipelago... its preservation is thanks to Liu Changdie."

Wei Xuanyin smiled with keen interest, his gaze still fixed on the characters gradually forming in the cauldron.

"I think that fellow has figured it out by now. Before, no one bothered him because those key Encompassing Profoundity Grotto-Heavens still needed people, still needed variables. Now that the greater situation is settled, no one likes variables, so his position has become precarious."

"On the contrary, he has more freedom overseas. Firstly, several positions the Dragon-kin require are related to Encompassing Profoundity, so protecting him is undoubtedly a good thing. Secondly... the Dragon-kin are also in a passive position now. With a variable in their hands, who knows when they might turn the tables and seize the initiative."

Wei Xuanyin's expression turned serious. "Do not underestimate Changxiao. He also factored in the variable of Liu Changdie. Whether through secret scheming or a direct agreement with the White Victory Dao, his timing was impeccable. At that moment, trouble was brewing in the Western Sea. If Liu Changdie had been forced to move, the Qunyi Archipelago would not have been saved either."

Sudden understanding dawned on Yehui. He lowered his head in thought before turning the conversation back. "But if that's the case, our arrangements in Jiangbei..."

Wei Xuanyin waved a hand dismissively, scattering the profound script on the water's surface. "Gongsun Bei is in Jiangbei with a Spiritual Treasure in hand. You have nothing to fear. As for the Buddhist cultivators, I will have a word with them..."

Seeing his nonchalance, Yehui took the opportunity to test his own idea. "I have also seen that White Qilin," he ventured. "It does not seem particularly demonic."

Wei Xuanyin turned to face him, his expression slowly growing grave. "Have you heard of the Sovereign's Perilous Tread?" he asked in a low voice. "To counter the demonic nature of a Bright Yang practitioner, you must consider the Bright Yang divine abilities. Of that, there is no mistake."

"As his divine abilities grow and he fully aligns with the Bright Yang, he cannot be judged by common sense. To deal with him, you must constrain him, hold him, and obstruct him at every turn before he can act. If you let him catch his breath and charge, the Sovereign's Perilous Tread will be unleashed. Unless I personally intervene, no restrictions will work. There will simply be another Cheng Yan."

He spoke in a haunting tone, "I will remind them. If the Buddhists underestimate him, they will bear the consequences themselves."

### Moongaze Lake

The sky was bright, the lake's surface shimmering. Streaks of pale white light zipped across the heavens as cultivators rode the wind in an orderly procession. A pillar of purple and gold reached from the earth to the sky, a magnificent immortal spectacle.

Li Suining stood quietly in a high pavilion, looking up with raised eyebrows.

‘King Wei has returned...’

Waves of clouds parted in the sky, revealing a colossal golden ship that moved like a great beast through the heavy sea of clouds. It unfurled itself under the sun's light, its deck lined with figures in impeccable jade armor. From its divine temples and crimson palaces, tier upon tier and room upon room, a magnificent brilliance shone forth.

He stared at the massive golden vessel. Beside him, an old man stood silently, his gaze filled with reverence as he looked to the sky. Li Suining let out a heavy breath, his voice tinged with disbelief.

"Elder Du... Did Daoist Master Cheng Yan... truly fall at Changxiao?"

Du Dou quickly bowed. "This servant only heard it from His Lordship's own lips, so I cannot vouch for its truth. But that is the news that came... The cultivators who were present said that in Helin Prefecture... the sky was filled with earth and rock, and the roads were buried under several feet of debris, blacker than ink! Baleful energy was erupting from the ground, and the soil was so saturated with it that you couldn't even squeeze it into a ball... If anyone walked on it, they would sink right in, and they'd fall ill after climbing out..."

"We old fellows were gossiping, and we thought it over... This must be what the death of a Daoist Master looks like."

Li Suining's own Dao-Profundity was not low. He nodded as he listened, already eighty to ninety percent convinced.

"He was truly slain!"

In his past life, the Chen family had made a move, and while the Changxiao Gate was still destroyed, Cheng Yan had either been warned or had some method to escape. He vanished without a trace, whether to the Eastern Sea or with Changxiao, never to be heard from again.

This dissonance between his past and present lives filled him with emotion, and he sighed.

"The clans of Helin would record it thus: 'In the late spring of the fifth month, the Celestial Gate's radiance suppressed the nine heavens. Suddenly, mountains collapsed and the earth split, raining down a torrent of rock and soil. Baleful energy erupted from the ground. When one looked out, the roads were buried under feet of dark earth, slippery as grease... Thus it was known that Cheng Yan had been executed.'"

Du Dou only half-understood, but it didn't matter. He simply tucked his hands into his sleeves and said respectfully, "The young master's words are absolutely right."

Just as he finished his flattery, a clear, calm voice drifted through the pavilion.

"The young master is in quite a poetic mood."

Li Suining whipped his head around to see a man standing in the pavilion. He was dressed in black, with wide, long eyebrows and slightly narrow eyes that revealed gray-black pupils, a fierce glint in their depths.

He stared intently into Li Suining's eyes, his own gray-black ones filled with a probing, evaluative light. He smiled faintly and spoke in a low voice.

"I am Chen Yang. I have the humble honor of serving the Daoist Master. I have been in seclusion for a time... I imagine the young master does not recognize me..."

Li Suining's gaze held a strange light as it lingered on the man's gray-black eyes, then slowly traced down his form before he replied.

"So it is Guest Retainer Chen. I have long heard of your great name... We are both of Qingdu blood. Senior, there is no need for such formality!"




# Chapter 1019: Ten Thousand Chariots

Chen Yang...

Li Suining lowered his gaze and cupped his hands, his expression serene. Hearing his words, a smile bloomed on Chen Yang's face.

"Young Master speaks truly," he said, nodding. "This bond cannot be erased. In the past, whenever a distinguished figure arrived on the island, I would always pay my respects. My recent seclusion has made me remiss in my duties. Please, do not take offense."

Li Suining's words were so perfectly crafted that Chen Yang couldn't help but smile. The 'Qingdu bloodline' was a concept that Chen Yang and others had quietly promoted. It referred to the few families who had first intermarried with the main house and remained close for generations, their ancestors all having been under the jurisdiction of the Qingdu Clan Arbiter. The most prominent among them were the Chen, Liu, Tian, and Ren families.

Drawing such a line served two purposes. First, it fostered a deeper sense of integration with the primary clan name. Second, it was a move against the rising stars, factions like the Funan Sect of the Ding Clan, the Western Shore He Clan Faction, the entire Nanzhang lineage, and the Huayu Sect of the An Clan. These factions were powerful in their own right, whether through their large numbers of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, their control over artifact refinement, or their sheer population of cultivators.

The title 'Qingdu bloodline' created a clear class distinction from these up-and-comers. It was a status the four Lijing families had always championed, while other cultivators remained silent. How could Chen Yang not be pleased by Li Suining's open acknowledgment? His eyes overflowed with mirth as he looked at him.

Li Suining understood the situation perfectly. In his past life, Nantanchen had argued with Jinguang, and Jinguang had retorted with a single, devastating line: 'I am of the Qingdu blood! How could I be ordered about by a remnant of a forgotten bloodline?' The accusation had struck a nerve, exposing Nantanchen's painstakingly crafted identity as a descendant of the Tian Clan. He had harbored a grudge ever since, and the conflict between the factions had escalated dramatically.

Though that event had not yet occurred in this timeline, Li Suining knew exactly where Chen Yang's pride lay. His flattery hit its mark, and Chen Yang nodded repeatedly, his face a mask of righteousness as he declared, "If you face any difficulties in the future, you have but to come to me!"

Li Suining didn't believe a word of it, but he smiled warmly. "Guest Retainer Chen is too kind."

This Guest Retainer Chen, the future General Chen, had actually met a decent end. When King Wei sought gold, the two princes fell in the north, vanishing without a trace. It wasn't until Li Zhouming rallied forces to the Southern Borderlands that fragments of news emerged.

Less than a tenth of King Wei's old guard survived. General Chen had gathered the remnants and defected to the Zhao Court, where he was held in high regard. Because the blood of the Wei-Li flowed in his veins—though the Bright Yang was not from his paternal line, and he cultivated Pit Water—he was accepted.

'Veiled Yin and Pit Water are compatible,' Li Suining mused. 'And he was a fallen scion of the Bright Yang who defected to the Zhao. At that time... he became a rather useful figure.'

This Guest Retainer Chen was a master of diplomacy, navigating complex relationships with ease. He had secured a minor official post under the Profound Governance Pavilion. Though he wasn't a major power player, his skill allowed him to maintain close ties with the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. After that, news of him became scarce. Even up to the day of his own death, Li Suining had never heard of him again.

'Chen Yang... ultimately carries half of my Li Clan's blood. Finding his way to the Zhao Court... naturally afforded him a good position.'

This was all in the future, after the Li Clan's decline. When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter. Li Suining didn't dwell on it, but his past life's experience told him this man was exceptionally cunning.

'He is, after all, one of the few outstanding figures from the Lijing faction. He was given great responsibility back then, earning considerable merit. His talent is first-rate even among the cultivators of the Lake today, and his words could reach the ear of King Wei... If I could get closer to him... it would be a great help to my future plans.'

Thus, he maintained his smile.

"Senior was in seclusion a few days ago, but I saw the phenomena in the south. The river boomed, and everyone was watching. Jinguang's cultivation has certainly become profound!"

"Hahahaha!"

Jinguang breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, and Chen Yang himself advancing to the late stage after taking a pill, had elevated the Chen family's power to a new level. This was a joyous occasion. Chen Yang laughed heartily and clapped Li Suining's shoulder, his expression turning serious.

"The Daoist Master has returned. I must go report and express my gratitude, so I cannot linger. When you have free time from your formation studies, feel free to visit me on the main island. Jinguang and the others... have all heard of your great name!"

After another round of pleasantries, the two parted ways. Chen Yang exited the pavilion. As he stepped out, the smile on his face slowly faded. A young man approached from the corridor, bowing his head.

"Father!"

Chen Yang gave a silent nod, his eyes narrowing slightly.

'A formidable one... I hear his skill in the Dao of formations is exceptional. In the future, he'll be a figure like Li Que'wan, someone who can ascend the mountain. The signs are already there. He's worth trying to win over...'

He paused for a moment in the gallery, his gaze sweeping unintentionally across the golden vessel in the sky. A flicker of hazy, stirring ambition flashed in his eyes.

'The destruction of Changxiao is proof of our power. In the shifting tides, the mountain's leeway... is enough for us to claim a divine ability...'

'Opportunity... where does it lie?'

The golden vessel glided across the sky as Chen Yang and his son vanished from sight. Li Suining withdrew his gaze and descended the steps one by one.

Billowing waves of energy made his robes flutter. Streams of light were landing one after another on the island. The golden vessel came to a halt, the grand formation within it glowing brightly as it slowly opened.

As Li Suining was admiring the sight, a middle-aged man with an honest face hurried over. He reached Li Suining, his expression one of extreme excitement.

"Suining!" he called out.

Li Suining instinctively looked up. Zhoufang had already grabbed his hand and was pulling him forward, whispering conspiratorially, "Come!"

The elder's hand was warm, and his face was flushed with excitement. He led him all the way to the front of the vessel, presented a token, and entered through a small side door. Only then did he let go, a wide grin on his face.

"Look!"

Countless points of pure white light glittered in their eyes. As far as the eye could see were seemingly endless stacks of white jade boxes, piled neatly, filling the entire cabin.

Li Suining was momentarily speechless, slowly looking around. Carts loaded with spiritual resources were flying out from the vessel's hold, forming a long, unbroken dragon in the air. The storage compartments on both sides opened with a roar. Spiritual rice, as vast as the sands, cascaded down like a golden waterfall, rapidly piling up in a jade pool before their stunned eyes.

The two of them were but tiny specks of light amidst this deluge of spiritual rice, frozen in astonishment inside the vessel.

A look of immense pride washed over Zhoufang's face. He said, his voice thick with emotion, "There's still more in the secret vaults of the Changxiao Gate! The family has already secured it. This is just the first shipment back!"

Li Suining's gaze swept over the hoard, his shock gradually turning to joy as he listened to the man continue.

"The wealth Changxiao accumulated over six generations... it's more than we could ever use!"

Zhoufang was not exaggerating. Li Suining's perspective was even broader than his; if this was true, these resources were enough for every descendant of the Li Clan to live in luxury for a century. Even during the great wars between north and south that were to come, there were few opportunities to completely annihilate an entire sect and claim all its wealth for oneself!

Li Suining had anticipated this, and his shock quickly morphed into delight. He turned to look at his elder, who had picked up two scattered jade boxes from the floor. He opened them gently, admiring the spiritual resources within.

"Look... this quality..." he sighed.

Li Suining looked on with him, unsure if Zhoufang intended to take a few portions for himself or point out a specific treasure. But the middle-aged man turned back, took his hand again, his eyes suddenly reddening.

"Suining," he said, his voice hoarse. "From now on, whether it's the Eastern Residence or the Western Residence, none of our kinsmen by the lake will ever have to suffer again!"

## Inner Array

The grand hall was dimly lit. Li Ximing stood with his hands tucked into his sleeves. Beside him, Li Jiangqian was slightly bowed, waiting in attendance. After a moment, a young man with golden eyes descended on a beam of light.

Li Jiangqian immediately prostrated himself. "Greetings, Father! Congratulations on vanquishing your southern foe, slaying a divine ability cultivator, and returning in great victory!"

When Li Zhouwei landed in the hall, the entire space seemed to brighten. His golden eyes shifted slightly toward Li Jiangqian.

"Rise."

"Yes, Father," Li Jiangqian replied respectfully, straightening up slightly. His gaze flashed imperceptibly over the inverted Radiant Sun King's Halberd at his father's waist, his expression and eyes betraying nothing as he lowered his back even further.

The light in the hall brightened and dimmed with him. The gold of his eyes was identical to the deep gold of the halberd, seemingly without a single impurity. He kept his gaze respectfully fixed on the floor.

Li Zhouwei took his seat. "How is your cultivation?"

Li Jiangqian glanced at him briefly before answering, "Your son has already refined Double Fire and Heavenly Apricot. I have begun work on the third stage of the Li Fire secret method, Setting the Snare."

"Heavenly Apricot..." Li Zhouwei pinched his fingers together in a quick calculation, a hint of surprise in his voice. "You mastered Heavenly Apricot much faster than expected. Did you have some assistance?"

Li Jiangqian nodded calmly. "Heavenly Apricot is closely related to the Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun, which provided a boost. Coupled with my own small measure of Dao-Profundity, I was fortunate enough to succeed."

His expression turned slightly regretful. "I was quite pleased after mastering this art, but when I began the third stage, Setting the Snare, the difficulty increased by several levels. I fear it will not be a matter of two or three years. And the final stage, True Flame, is said to be the most difficult of all."

Li Ximing looked impressed and offered some comforting words. "This cannot be rushed, but it must be mastered. Not everyone is like your father. If you can master these two secret methods in ten or fifteen years, you will already be blessed by great fortune."

"Yes!"

Li Jiangqian bowed. Li Ximing then took a jade box from his sleeve and opened it for him to see. Inside lay a round, golden stone.

"You need not worry about spiritual resources," Li Ximing said with a smile.

"Your father has already found the Li Fire spiritual item you need. Though we don't recognize its name, it is undoubtedly a Li Fire treasure!"

Overjoyed, Li Jiangqian took a step forward and fell to his knees. "I can never repay the immense kindness of you two elders!" he said in a low, heavy voice.

Li Ximing gave him a smiling glance and raised an eyebrow. "Will you take it now?"

It was a bona fide Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item. Even for the Li Clan, fresh off plundering a grotto-heaven, they likely had no more than five such treasures. The sight of it made Li Jiangqian's heart surge. "I ask only that the elders keep it for me. This junior will enter seclusion at once!" he kowtowed.

The allure of a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability was enough to make one risk life and limb. With such a treasure right before him, even a man as composed as him could not contain his excitement. After a deep bow, he hurriedly excused himself from the hall.

Li Zhouwei watched him go, seemingly lost in thought. Li Ximing cleared his throat and asked, "Did you truly kill him?"

"He's dead."

A trace of astonishment flickered in Li Ximing's eyes. "What did you gain?"

Li Zhouwei smiled faintly. He raised his left hand, forming a sword seal with two fingers. A small, searing wisp of black flame appeared at his fingertips.

The flame was somewhat ethereal, grey on the outside and black within. As it rose, the atmosphere in the hall shifted. The clang of armored soldiers and the clash of steel filled the air, and a wave of heat washed over them.

"This is..." Li Ximing's pupils constricted. "The Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts?!"

Realization dawned on him, and he slapped the table. "By slaughtering Cheng Yan, this art has benefited immensely!"

Li Zhouwei looked at the dark flame on his fingertip with a pleased smile. "Precisely! This art is a Profound Qi technique of the Great Liang, and it is also a primordial demonic cultivation method of old. One uses life-souls to refine a weapon and achieve a Dharma Body. I never had the chance to annihilate a sect before. Although the family did its best to create opportunities for me, I had only barely met the minimum requirements to use this art."

"After all my careful planning, the affair with the Changxiao Gate has finally provided the greatest possible boost to my Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts. I have crossed the threshold and gained an umbral soul, laying the foundation for the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body!"

Li Ximing listened intently as Li Zhouwei continued, "Annihilating a sect enhances the maximum power of the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body, but I still need to nourish and maintain the umbral soul myself. I can either slaughter countless people and feed it with a sea of blood, or I can use the vast spiritual resources from the destroyed sect to cultivate... The two paths are different and will lead to different marvels."

Li Ximing clicked his tongue. "Are you going to use the resources from Changxiao Gate?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "The Dharma Body has only just formed its foundation and doesn't require much for now. I will not touch those resources. Only the massive stores of spirit rice are difficult to preserve, so I will take some to sate the Dharma Body's hunger and restore some of its power. There will be plenty of opportunities for great battles in the future."

His expression grew serious, tinged with regret. "It's a pity Cheng Yan was so pathetic. The Illuminating Sun and Moon requires an opponent of equal standing. Even though he died by my hand, it was less beneficial than if Shilou Yingge had been merely injured... My battle with Helian Wujiang and Shilou Yingge brought my Dao-Profundity close to Helian Wujiang's level. Cheng Yan proved to be utterly useless. What a waste!"

Li Ximing's expression was a bit strange. He nodded silently.

'...Actually... Cheng Yan cultivated for many years. And from the sounds of his Tome of Subjugating the Murky Mountain... his Dao-Profundity was probably higher than mine...'

As he pondered this, Li Zhouwei changed the subject. With a flick of his sleeve, several jade boxes shrouded in Heavenly Light landed on the table. The multicolored light dissipated, revealing the spiritual items within. Li Ximing glanced over them and smiled.

"Changxiao left quite a few things behind."

Li Zhouwei looked up and handed the round, Golden Core-like Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument back to him.

"Let the elders decide what to do with the Crane-Embrace Stone. The family is currently lacking life-restoring miracle pills. Please refine this Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf for emergencies."

"Alright!"

Li Ximing agreed, taking two scrolls with profound patterns and several jade slips from him.

"The Mountain-Offering Stone-Splitting Art is of little use," Li Zhouwei continued. "The Tome of Subjugating the Murky Mountain has even stricter requirements. The Cold Light Scenery-Proclaiming Formula can be given to Jiangchun. The other Purple Mansion Realm cultivation methods are not very useful to our family, but at least we can trade them openly. Store them in the family treasury. As for this scroll, it needs to be opened by Vault Metal. We'll need Senior Liu to handle it."

His gaze fell upon a treasured vase.

"As for this Radiant Spirit-Vessel... I ask that you consume it, uncle."

"Hmm?"

Li Ximing was taken aback. Their family possessed the Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise, so he knew exactly how to use this resource. Consuming it directly to cultivate spell arts was a bit of a luxury. "This..."

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "I know you're thinking of the Six Harmonies Treasure Vase. It is indeed a fine item, but our family neither cultivates the Upper Rite, nor is the Bright Yang particularly compatible with it. Why waste so much time and energy refining a vase? Grasping for too much, you'll end up with nothing. The Spiritual Treasures you and I possess are already enough to study for a hundred years!"

"The value of a spiritual resource isn't in its extravagance, but in its suitability. Consuming this spiritual essence to cultivate will elevate your spell arts to a new level. That is the better way to use it!"

Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then slowly nodded. "You have a point... My Great Parting's White Brilliance can barely manifest a golden brilliance, and it's unlikely to see major improvement anytime soon. So, it's not worth using it there. But for Tread on Flames and Emperor Qi's Light, it could be very useful."

"As for the Wu Earth spiritual artifact..."

"I will ask Kuang Yu and the others to search the four seas for an Wu Earth Daoist Master. The Mountain-Offering Stone-Splitting Art, the Tome of Subjugating the Murky Mountain, and the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella are more than enough to establish a new Dao Lineage. Someone is bound to be tempted."

With the matter settled, Li Zhouwei slowly turned around. "Changxiao Gate controlled an entire Prefecture for hundreds of years. All of its resources now belong to our family. Uncle, care to guess... how much there is?"

Li Ximing paused for a moment, then chuckled. "Judging by the needs of a Foundation Establishment cultivator... I'd guess over a hundred treasure medicines and dharma artifacts?"

The golden-eyed young man shook his head. "The golden vessel has only brought back one or two-tenths of it. It will take ten days to half a month to move everything. The dharma artifacts we've acquired are enough to arm ten Jade Courts. The resources, even if used extravagantly, are enough for our entire clan to live in luxury for a century!"

Li Zhouwei grinned. "And there is also an Upper Rite array disk!"

This was the greatest prize from their southern campaign, something Li Ximing certainly hadn't forgotten. He nodded with a smile. "A Daoist Master with an established sect wouldn't use it, but we can find some masters who are trying to establish themselves in the outer seas. They lack resources but have plenty of time to modify the formation. If all else fails, we can entrust it to Senior Liu. He can handle both selling and repairing it. One family's gain can feed two!"

As they spoke of this, Li Zhouwei's expression grew solemn. "Is there any news from the Qunyi Archipelago?"

Li Ximing's smile vanished. "News from the Western Sea arrived first. The White Victory Dao made a move... something has happened to Fuxun and Qingyan. Senior Liu also received the news... but he has always been cautious. He suspects someone is trying to lure him out, so he's staying put at the Qunyi Archipelago and has only ordered the Demon King Fuxun to temporarily retreat to the Eastern Sea."

Li Zhouwei paced for a moment, then met Li Ximing's gaze.

Li Ximing shook his head. "The timing is too coincidental..."

Li Zhouwei nodded decisively.

"The White Victory Dao has deep ties to the Profound Governance Pavilion," Li Ximing mused. "After all, they were both once connected to the Lesser Yang... Could this be a scheme from the north?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head slightly and rubbed his brow. "It doesn't seem like it. Wei Xuanyin wouldn't go to such lengths. And for what purpose?"

He suddenly stopped. "I need to go see that Dragon Crown Prince."

Despite the destruction of Changxiao, neither man felt at ease. They fell silent, then rose and entered the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Li Zhouwei stood in the pavilion, contemplating the celestial view. After watching him for a few moments, Li Ximing suddenly spoke.

"In the days you were away at Changxiao, I have been pondering your words..."

A complex look crossed Li Zhouwei's face as he listened.

"In truth," Li Ximing continued, raising an eyebrow, "the moment you were born into this world, the family should have understood. Nothing falls from the sky for free; everything has a purpose. You were right. The great one did not send you on this journey for nothing. The so-called act of reincarnation has always been a delusion."

Their eyes met.

"Our Wei-Li clan, my cultivation of Bright Yang, it was all in preparation for you," Li Ximing stated calmly. "For a minor noble house to rise to prominence in a mere hundred years, it needs a backer. You are our backer. Without you, the powers of the Lake would have crushed us long ago. The conflicts between north and south would not have repeatedly halted at our shores."

"Now, you have no choice but to contend."

Li Ximing paused, his expression growing tranquil.

"The family has no path of retreat. We must fight. Whatever the cost... be it myself, or Moongaze Lake... perhaps we can trade it all for a chance at radiance. Let us try."

Li Zhouwei turned his head, his golden eyes deep and dark. "Thank you, granduncle."

Li Ximing smiled faintly, then his expression turned serious.

"However... there is one matter that must be put on the agenda."

Seeing Li Zhouwei raise an eyebrow, Li Ximing said gravely, "The Dao lineage."

"Bright Yang Dao's Audience with the Celestial Gate and Sovereign's Perilous Tread are complete. What remains are Imperial Observation of the Origin, Crimson Severing Arrowhead, and World's Radiance."

"The day you perfect Sovereign's Perilous Tread should be soon. Whether it's Imperial Observation of the Origin or Crimson Severing Arrowhead, gathering the necessary qi will take three to five years. Although we have ample time, we must begin preparations."

Li Ximing paused briefly. "I have checked the pavilion. We have methods for both Imperial Observation of the Origin and Crimson Severing Arrowhead. Minghuang is watching over them. Which path will you cultivate first?"

"Good."

His words sent the golden-eyed young man into deep thought. He paced the hall before they walked into the pavilion together. The jade-like stone platform still glowed faintly, with black wooden slips resting upon it.

Li Zhouwei gently brushed a slip, and silver text materialized. He murmured.

"For Imperial Observation of the Origin, there is the Scripture of the Bright Mountain's Surging Waves. It is undoubtedly an ancient and supreme method, very likely a technique passed down from the Wei Imperial Palace."

"For Crimson Severing Arrowhead, there are two options. The first is the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light, and the second is the Dharma Scripture of the Distant Crimson Guardian General..."

His expression turned serious, and he shook his head. "All three are shrouded in gray. We must seek them out one by one. For now, we can only choose one..."

"Crimson Severing Arrowhead is a method of attack, using the weight of ten thousand chariots to sweep away all obstacles. Imperial Observation of the Origin is an orthodox divine ability of a monarch ruling his subjects, issuing clear edicts. Both would be of great assistance."

Li Zhouwei lowered his voice. "In truth, the orthodox imperial path of Imperial Observation of the Origin is not necessarily more powerful, but its benefit to the Bright Yang is certainly greater. Otherwise, the Wei court would not have locked this art away in the palace, using the Eternal Brightness Steps as a replacement for the outside world..."

His tone shifted. "But from a cultivation standpoint, the Bright Yang is a dao of ascending step-by-step through clear ranks. For a Bright Yang Monarch who has trod the path of peril and reached the state of enlightenment and regret, Crimson Severing Arrowhead is clearly more suitable as the third divine ability. A grand and orthodox art like Imperial Observation of the Origin would be better suited for the fourth or fifth slot."

He studied the silver text carefully. Li Ximing looked concerned. "I have only one worry. Both Crimson Severing Arrowhead and Imperial Observation of the Origin are lineages that have been lost for a long time. Crimson Severing Arrowhead is more common; it can be found in the Eastern Fire lineage. But Imperial Observation of the Origin is a secret treasure of the Wei Kingdom. It will inevitably draw unwanted attention... Crimson Severing Arrowhead is the safer choice."

Li Zhouwei nodded. He raised his hand, the gold in his eyes deepening.

"The Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light."




# Chapter 1020: Rainbow Glow

'The Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light.'

Li Ximing's eyes swept over the title, and he remarked with approval, "It is more suitable. While both techniques are based on the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, leaving their true grade indiscernible, the Wei-Li heritage is clear. The Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light is obviously more orthodox than the Dharma Scripture of the Distant Crimson Guardian General!"

Li Zhouwei nodded. "Moreover, the cost in Immortal Merits for such techniques is always fixed. The Imperial Codex requires two hundred and twenty, whereas the Dharma Scripture needs only one hundred and eighty-one. The difference is substantial."

"It's just that..." he continued, calculating, "after exchanging for the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence, I was left with one hundred and seventy-five merits. Wiping out that sect and killing Cheng Yan earned me another fifty-seven... for a total of two hundred and thirty-two..."

Li Ximing considered this for a moment, then replied with a touch of wistfulness, "There isn't much left over, is there?"

A faint smile touched Li Zhouwei's lips. "It's a good thing to be able to use them. The real waste would be possessing a mountain of secret manuals and techniques but lacking the means to acquire them. As for Immortal Merits, we will earn more in time."

He raised a hand, drawing three sticks of incense from his sleeve, but then paused. "Though I possess a body of divine abilities, I must not neglect the proper rites. I shall first burn incense and bathe before seeking this heavenly audience."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up with understanding. "Good!"

As they descended from the upper chamber of the pavilion, Li Zhouwei put away the incense and adopted a serious tone. "How far has Lord Yang's campaign progressed?"

Li Ximing, who had clearly been monitoring the situation from the lake, answered in a low voice, "He has already pushed past Lixia!"

They sat down at a stone table, and two moon-white, spherical lanterns on either side immediately lit up. Li Ximing continued, "The Way of Great Desire spread south with abandon, investing considerable effort. Their golden lotuses looked otherworldly, and they even elevated local commoners into the Buddhist faith. Yet, their front collapsed with surprising ease, forcing them back north and leaving behind a trail of followers. These converts were fervent but few, making them quick to eliminate."

"However, I heard some news..." His expression turned somber. "It is said those mountains are now filled with children, steeped in some kind of silver water, corrupted to their very roots. And that Lord Yang, unwilling to resort to slaughter, is sealing these 'lotuses' one by one and sending the children down the mountains to be fostered. This does not bode well."

Li Zhouwei fell silent, pondering this. "That is a matter for the Yang family," he finally said. "For now, Changxiao has been pacified, Si Yuanli is on board, and the mainland is temporarily secure. With this Daoist Master's True Qi pressing into the Wilderness, the northern powers won't dare to start a major conflict at this moment. Our home is enjoying a rare period of safety... I need to make a trip to the Eastern Sea."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing looked as if he wanted to say something but held his tongue as the young man explained, "One must always act with the utmost caution. Although I have the Imperial Codex, I need a proper pretext for its appearance. I will visit the descendants of the Cui clan, ask them some questions to clarify matters, and retrieve those few Bright Yang cultivation arts that belonged to their family."

A flicker of concern crossed Li Ximing's face, but he gave a heavy nod.

Li Zhouwei, however, simply brushed his sleeve, appearing unconcerned.

"Uncle-Grandfather, rest assured, I will not make things difficult for them, nor will I take their arts for free. They will be compensated for whatever I receive."

He lifted his gaze, his golden eyes darkening slightly. "I've also met Yangya. He doesn't strike me as a man of great character, so there's no telling what he might be plotting in secret. This trip will also be a chance to support Cui Jueyin. If Yangya dares to mistreat him, I will not let it slide."

This statement had Li Ximing nodding in vigorous agreement. "Jueyin has served diligently for so many years. This is no longer about the Cui family or the Li family."

"Furthermore..." Li Zhouwei mused, "it would be best if I could meet a dragon. If not, it's no great loss... In that case, I will head to Yinzhou Island and dispose of the Buddhist cultivators' artifacts I have on hand."

Li Ximing thought for a moment. "If that's your plan, you might as well dispose of all this other miscellaneous stuff. I was thinking about this earlier."

He produced the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman, his expression serious. "I already have more than enough Spiritual Artifacts; I can't even make full use of a single Spiritual Treasure. The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron and Sichuan are more than enough for me to handle. Take this talisman and see what you can get for it... If you can trade it for something useful, great. If not, Kuang Yu is scheduled to visit the lake soon. I'll just entrust it to her."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. This was the second time he had heard Kuang Yu's name.

"Uncle-Grandfather," he said, a note of amusement in his voice, "you and this Daoist Master have been getting quite close lately!"

Li Ximing, however, seemed to see nothing unusual about it. He shook his head.

"It's merely a matter of mutual benefit! With the Supreme Yang's light having faded, people like her are gathering together for warmth. Whether it's my Dao lineage or my alchemy skills, I am, after all, useful to them."

Li Zhouwei's brow lifted, a smile touching his lips, "And how is Uncle-Grandfather's 'World's Radiance' coming along?"

An embarrassed smile appeared on Li Ximing's face.

"The first attempt was a failure..." he admitted regretfully.

"I have another three to five years... I can try again then."

Li Zhouwei looked slightly exasperated but still spoke with great solemnity. "I am not blaming you, Uncle-Grandfather. Everyone knows how difficult divine abilities are. If I didn't have a bit of fate on my side, I too would face repeated failures. But time is short. We don't know when the new dynasty will be established or what turmoil will follow. We cannot afford any more delays."

"The family's resources are now plentiful, and our need for Wall-Sinking Water from the Qunyi Archipelago has lessened. You can set aside alchemy for now and focus on advancing your spell arts and mastering your divine ability."

He looked at him directly. "If you do not succeed this next time, I will have to seek out Sima Yuanli. No matter the cost, I will trade for that Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill."

Hearing Li Zhouwei speak so bluntly, Li Ximing's embarrassment vanished. He nodded repeatedly, vowing, "There aren't many pills that need refining anyway. Go, and don't worry about things at home... There is just one thing I must trouble you with."

As Li Zhouwei looked at him questioningly, Li Ximing took two items from his sleeve.

One was a translucent jade vial that emitted a faint white mist, with profound patterns swirling upon its surface. It was the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill! The other item was even more mystical: a short blade with an ivory edge and a jade hilt, its surface covered in ghostly patterns that resembled a bestiary of demonic creatures, glowing with a purple light.

Li Ximing smiled. "While you were away, Dingyang Zi came to see me. This spirit embryo for an Upper Shaman, the Gleaming Edge, has been completed."

"Such speed... Dingyang Zi is truly skilled!" Li Zhouwei nodded, impressed, but then a hint of suspicion entered his voice. "He draws a significant amount of spiritual resources from our family every year to craft this item, yet he works this fast. Perhaps it's some rapid-completion method from the path of Comprehending Profoundity..."

His golden eyes scanned the Gleaming Edge, and his words trailed off. He frowned.

"A fine treasure."

Li Ximing looked at him, puzzled, as Li Zhouwei stared intently at the ivory blade. "Is... is this a spiritual object from the Treasured Earth?"

Nearly everyone who saw the Gleaming Edge would praise it, but Li Ximing had never paid it much mind; it was, after all, only a spirit embryo. But then he heard Li Zhouwei look up and say,

"I have heard that the sign of the Treasured Earth is the Grief Elephant. Where it sleeps, the ground swells into hills known as the Treasure Mound Hills. For a hundred miles around, if it does not rain between the hills when a man and woman marry, pregnancy cannot proceed. She will toil with a swollen belly, unable to give birth... In ancient times, it was a great demon."

He lowered his gaze. "This must be the ivory of a Demon beast related to the Grief Elephant, like a peacock is to its kind. But it's strange... why would such a precious material be used to make a mere spirit embryo?"

Hearing how bizarre this Demon beast was, Li Ximing felt a pang of unease.

"Ultimately, it is a secret of another's Dao lineage. It's best we don't pry. When you have a moment, just hand it over to Jiao Zhongzi."

Only then did Li Zhouwei rise, agreeing to the task. He summoned a bright light and flew off to change his clothes and bathe.

Li Ximing remained standing silently in the pavilion. He stood there for a long while before finally letting out a deep sigh and sitting down cross-legged on the spot.

An unknown amount of time passed before the golden-eyed young man reappeared, standing silently at the top of the stairs. He walked through the long corridor where white mist drifted, ascending step by step to the highest meditation chamber in the High Firmament Pavilion.

The black wooden slip still rested in the groove on the stone dais. His hand swept lightly over it, and a pale, silvery illusion rippled outwards like water.

The silver words that condensed were not the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light. They were six different words.

Rainbow Glow Cloud-Riding Technique.

But these large, silvery words flickered for only an instant before dissipating. A cascade of spell arts and Dao lineages flowed down from top to bottom, appearing one after another in a vast torrent.

'Glimmering Cloudfall Art... Seven-Hued Cloud Seal... Aiding Light Escape Art... Vast Cloud Mystic Art...'

The dense list of Heavenly Glow Dao arts passed before his eyes, but none of them could hold his attention for even a moment. Instead, his gaze slowly lowered.

He remained silent, the face of his uncle-grandfather, Li Ximing, suddenly appearing in his mind. His uncle-grandfather must have discovered this even earlier than he did, yet he had remained perfectly composed, as if nothing was wrong.

'They're all spell arts, with no Dao Lineage.'

'Not a single one.'

---

Hetian Sea.

Mount Duan.

Colorful clouds drifted among the peaks, which shimmered with a radiant glow. At the summit, streams of light intertwined. A streak of rainbow-colored light flew in, landing atop the mountain. It paused for a moment, then flared and shot forward once more.

At the foot of the mountain, groups of Demon beasts roamed. A Daoist nun in a simple gray robe was treading on the wind when she saw a dark streak of light shuttle toward her. It landed on the sea but would not set foot on the mountain, maintaining a distance as it transformed into a middle-aged man.

As the man revealed his form, the Daoist nun looked up, her gaze lingering on him for an extra moment.

"So, the Daoist Master has arrived," she said coolly.

The middle-aged man looked slightly awkward. He glanced down at her and replied, 

"I was on my way to the Peacock Sea and, passing through Hetian, came to see you, sister."

"You are too kind, Daoist Master," the nun replied perfunctorily, her expression far from welcoming. "Now that you have seen me, are there any instructions?"

The man's face was a mask of complex emotions. "Xiao'er, I understand the bitterness in your heart, but we are still family. I haven't seen you in decades... Must you be like this?"

The Daoist nun was none other than Yang Xiao'er! And the man standing opposite her was the Yang family's Daoist Master, Yang Ruiyi, whom Li Zhouwei had met in Simin Prefecture.

Hearing Yang Ruiyi's words, Yang Xiao'er's icy demeanor finally softened slightly. Before she could speak, Yang Ruiyi produced a tiny, pocket-sized pavilion from his sleeve.

The pavilion had nine corners, with one table and four chairs inside. He tossed it lightly into the air, and an inky blackness immediately descended, pulling the two of them inside to stand face to face.

Yang Ruiyi sighed deeply, turned to the side, and clasped his hands behind his back. "Believe it or not... I never thought things with you... would end up like this. When Father arranged it back then, he never imagined it would become part of a grander Bright Yang scheme..."

Yang Xiao'er said nothing. Yang Ruiyi frowned, his tone growing more urgent. 

"The Fox Clan is insignificant. Not just to us, but even to someone like Tang Pan, they are a trivial matter. Why would we go to such great lengths for them! I..."

The Daoist nun before him cut him off. "It seems the matter of Li Jiangliang wasn't considered such a great length either," Yang Xiao'er said flatly.

Yang Ruiyi faltered.

"Just listen to me..." he pleaded, raising his brow.

"The Jiangliang affair happened after the greater situation between the north and south was already decided. We needed the White Qilin, and the Li family needed a token of trust from us. That's why it happened... It was a decision made at a much higher level and cannot be conflated with Father's arrangements..."

A shadow of melancholy crossed his face. "Father only has a few children. You were born with poor aptitude and no spiritual apertures, so he went to great lengths to acquire the Treasured Qi of the Grand Pure Spirit Palace just to help open them for you... But that item's power is limited; it cannot grant a divine ability... Father only ever wanted you to be safe..."

Yang Ruiyi's expression dimmed. "Later, when the Ning-Li bloodline emerged, Father was in charge. He already had ties to the Ning-Li and saw that Li Xizhi was a good man, so he sent you to the mountains to see if a match could be made... He never expected you to fall in love at first sight... Father was very pleased at the time, saying it was fate bringing our two families together..."

"After all... after all, it's the Ning-Li. What's the harm in preserving a branch or two!"

Yang Xiao'er's expression slowly began to change, but she remained silent, listening to her brother's sigh.

"Back then, we gave no thought to Bright Yang at all!" he lamented, then suddenly looked up.

"You have to understand, the White Qilin's descent only happened after Chenghuai was born. If we had known sooner, I would never... I would never have let him be named Li!"

Yang Xiao'er's voice was flat. "You put it so well, brother. Whether it's me or my child, the higher-ups don't care. It is precisely because they don't care that all this trouble started."

She took a step forward, a trace of sorrow on her plain face. "I am no fool. Brother, you don't need to make excuses for Father... Father... I will call him that, for now..."

"He valued my husband because of his good standing with the Ning-Li. He only wanted to use our Yang family bloodline to protect that one or two branches. But there was a deeper fear behind it... The Anhuai and Wanling Grotto-heavens, wasn't it?"

Yang Ruiyi lowered his head as his sister's soft voice continued, "Father ultimately acted out of personal feelings, wanting only to preserve a bloodline for a rainy day. He never wanted my husband to achieve greatness and attract attention, which would bring down the wrath of those above, ensuring no one could be saved. In his heart, he hoped my husband would remain mediocre, or perhaps die in the process of breaking through, so long as the bloodline was passed on."

"But how could the Ning-Li bloodline produce a simple man? A sword immortal had already emerged, and that sword immortal was even my husband's clan elder... The Anhuai and Wanling Grotto-heavens were bound to open sooner or later. As a descendant of the Ning-Li, who knows what fated opportunities he might encounter?"

"So, you all discreetly pointed him down a dead end, hoping he would go no further. You even deliberately kept him away from those two grotto-heavens, ensuring he couldn't possibly stumble upon them... How very cautious..."

She smiled gently, a mix of pride and sorrow on her face. "But my husband is no ordinary man. Even walking the dead-end road of Rainbow Glow, his Dao-Profundity grows day by day. Seeing this, Father has begun to feel afraid again, hasn't he?"

Yang Xiao'er raised her eyes, looking directly at the Daoist Master.

"Brother, am I right?"




# Chapter 1021: Brother-in-Law

Confronted with the question, Yang Ruiyi was silent for a long time. He clasped his hands behind his back and paced the pavilion, as if the words were too difficult to speak. After a heavy silence, Yang Xiao’er spoke first.

“I knew nothing about any of this before. Even when you told me about the Rainbow Glow opportunity on Mount Duan, I kept my mouth shut. I quietly accepted it, arranging for him to come here…”

“He sits on this mountain day after day, never taking a single step beyond its borders. And now, you’ve come to find me again. What else must I do?”

Her words filled Yang Ruiyi with sorrow. Visibly moved, he said, “If… if you resent Father for your current situation, it’s not right. Choosing a Dao lineage for him was meant to protect him. This entire marriage, from beginning to end, was all for the sake of you and Xizhi.”

“Even now, Father has made concessions for you. A place on Mount Duan… is not so easily obtained!”

Yang Xiao’er lowered her head, a faint smile on her lips. “What are you talking about? I chose this path myself. If I had to do it all over again, I would still go to Qingsui Peak. As for resenting Father…”

She shook her head. “There’s nothing to resent. Since he has entered the shadow world and now oversees the affairs of the Underworld’s deceased, he is merely a shade wearing a familiar face. Just like… just like the Great Ancestor. The moment he achieved his divine ability… he became someone we couldn’t even look upon.”

At his sister’s mention of the Underworld, Yang Ruiyi fell silent. He seemed unable to find a rebuttal, or perhaps, in his heart, he agreed. When she brought up Yang Tianya, a genuine shock flickered in his eyes. He lowered his gaze.

“We must not speak of such things. It is a great blessing that the Great Ancestor reached the Purple Mansion Realm, attaining a rank befitting an Exalted One. Were it not for the strenuous efforts of both him and the Exalted One, how could Father have come to oversee the dead? How could our family have received such a magnificent opportunity?”

He picked up a cup, and his ordinary face took on a noble, radiant sheen. He glanced at Yang Xiao’er.

“A few days ago, the Exalted One came from the Underworld and met with the White Qilin before returning swiftly. The immortal words spoken were few… Tianyou was fortunate enough to overhear a couple of sentences. She and I have been agonizing over their meaning ever since…”

This news was clearly momentous. Yang Xiao’er’s eyebrows shot up, her expression turning grave. “Is… is that in accordance with the rules? Why so soon?”

Yang Ruiyi gave a bitter smile. “You have to understand, this is a figure who once shared wine and conversation with True Monarch Cui. After the fall of Wei, his station in the Underworld has only risen. He can now ascend the steps to the Celestial Hall and participate in discussing the affairs of the dead. Who would dare say anything if he makes a brief visit to the mortal world, so long as he doesn't act?”

“Even Judge Jiang… must now bow his head to Him.”

A mix of worry and joy on her face, Yang Xiao’er paced the pavilion once. “What did Tianyou say?”

Yang Ruiyi’s expression was grim. “First: Save the man, not his line. Save the dead, not the living.”

Yang Xiao’er was momentarily speechless, a thoughtful look on her face. She lowered her head. “That’s not entirely unexpected.”

Yang Ruiyi paused before continuing. “Second… it concerns the situation in the north. This isn’t the place to discuss it in detail, so I can only say this… a great storm is brewing. With Father gone, I cannot watch over everything constantly. The Yang Clan will not restrain your husband, but if he leaves Mount Duan, the consequences will be severe. He will have to bear them himself.”

Yang Xiao’er’s head snapped up. She remained silent for a long moment. Yang Ruiyi met her gaze, his own open and honest.

“Xiao’er… you are my only sister,” he said with great solemnity. “This is the most your brother can do for you.”

But Yang Xiao’er had been deceived too many times. As if judging the truth of his words, she suddenly asked, “The Exalted One was willing to speak of such things with Tianyou?”

Yang Ruiyi shook his head. “Bright Yang is Bright Yang, after all. The Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate had its own connections to the Underworld in the past. It’s just that…”

He paused, choosing his words carefully. “When Great Ancestor Wei ascended as Monarch, he no longer trod in the Underworld or concerned himself with the affairs of the dead. Those matters were all handled by High Radiance. Thus, the Exalted One had frequent dealings with True Monarch Cui… there is a bond between them. That’s why Father was able to support the Ning-Li clan, and why the Exalted One turned a blind eye… and why he was willing to say a few extra words to Tianyou.”

With her last doubt dispelled, Yang Xiao’er gave a slight bow. “Many thanks, Daoist Master!”

Yang Ruiyi’s breath hitched. He looked at her deeply, his voice taking on a pleading tone.

“Xiao’er, your brother's opportunity and tribulation lie in these coming years. In terms of Dao-Profundity and strategy, I am no match for Father. Even he failed, so what chance do I have? I have cultivated a Dharma Body since I was young, but in the end, I am just a general… If I perish seeking the gold, then as you said, the one who arrives in the shadow world will no longer be me…”

“We are brother and sister, yet the days we have left to meet are numbered… and I may never hear you call me brother again.”

Tears welled in Yang Xiao’er’s eyes, but she smiled. “Then you will have to visit Mount Duan a few more times.”

Leaving a silent Yang Ruiyi in the pavilion, she turned and departed, riding the wind down the mountain path. Her face had already regained its usual calm. She ascended from a side trail, arriving at a small peak.

The peak was remote and rugged, lacking any magnificent palaces or grand structures. There was only a small pond, a simple thatched hut by its edge, a stone table, and a few stone chairs.

A middle-aged man in a straw cloak, his sleeves rolled up, was washing a sword by the pond. His back was to her, his emotions unreadable. The hand that held the sword was exceptionally steady, without the slightest tremor.

The sound of the water was pleasant. The snow-white blade rippled in the pond, casting shifting patches of white light onto his face and reflecting a pair of grey-black eyes, their sharpness concealed.

Hearing footsteps, the man looked up, revealing a gentle, refined, and scholarly face. A smile touched the corners of his eyes as he raised his brows.

“Xiao’er.”

“Husband!”

Yang Xiao’er’s expression instantly brightened. Her smiling eyes glanced at the cold steel glinting in the water. “Finished with your sword so early today?”

Li Xizhi helped her sit down. “It’s not so early,” he said softly. “Fellow Daoist Xishe didn’t come today. I practiced two sets of forms on my own before putting my sword away. I saw you arriving just as I finished.”

His wife smiled. “Xishe is certainly diligent. He even brought some cultivation resources over a few days ago. They weren’t exceptionally valuable, but for him, they were treasures. It shows his sincerity.”

Li Xizhi chuckled. He took a cloth from his sleeve and began to wipe the gleaming blade. “He is a man infatuated with the sword. He doesn't have ulterior motives. He simply knows he can learn from me and test his skills against the sword arts of the Chunyi Dao Gate.”

“I’m not afraid of him learning a thing or two,” he continued. “Since I’m confined to the mountain and cannot go out, it would be a good thing if I could earn a bit of goodwill from him, perhaps to help our family’s younger generation, or those few disappointing disciples of mine.”

The man looked up, his gaze gentle. “You went out?”

Yang Xiao’er fell quiet for a moment before sighing. “An older brother came to visit.”

“Oh?”

Li Xizhi stood up, rolling down his sleeves. A hint of curiosity touched his face.

“If your brother came to visit, why leave him standing outside? You should have invited him in for a cup of tea.”

He raised an eyebrow. “An older brother… not Ruizao? I don’t believe you’ve mentioned another.”

Yang Xiao’er rarely spoke of the Yang family. Even regarding Yang Ruizao, the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from Azure Pond, she always seemed indifferent. News from the Yangs was rare, so Li Xizhi was quite interested.

But she looked a little awkward and shook her head. “He… I’m not very familiar with him. He was just passing by. We exchanged a few words, but he was in a hurry to attend to his duties and couldn't stay…”

Li Xizhi nodded, his eyes closing for a fraction of a second. He didn't press the matter. 

“What a pity,” he said with a smile.

He returned to the stone table and poured a cup of tea, asking casually, “Any news of the children?”

Yang Xiao’er smiled faintly. “Chenghuai is out gaining experience with my clansmen. My family has a deep foundation in the way of the Upper Shaman. However, that path must be paired with his Untraceable Presence, so it’s best he doesn’t draw attention to himself or seek fame. You needn't worry, husband.”

“As for Zhouluo…” She took the tea from her husband’s hand with a smile. “With your family’s young lord watching over him, he won’t suffer any disadvantages in Yue State! That brother of mine has secured many benefits for him, from Dao lineages and cultivation arts to spiritual items. Everything has been prepared.”

“That is quite a lot of trouble for your brother.” Li Xizhi raised an eyebrow, offering a gentle reminder, “But resources alone are not enough. Zhouluo’s innate talent is not high. The matter of his divine ability is still something to be considered carefully…”

It was sound advice, and Yang Xiao’er understood it well.

“Rest assured,” she said with a smile. “This opportunity was prepared specifically for him. With them watching, we can take it one day at a time… even if it takes fifty or a hundred years, they will wait until everything is perfect before he attempts to attain his divine ability.”

“Good!”

Li Xizhi’s expression was relaxed. He turned with a natural grace, his back to his wife, and hung the treasured sword within the hut. His grey-black eyes, their sharpness veiled, seemed to see through all worldly matters, brimming with tranquility.

“You’ve worked hard,” the man said softly.

---

Lotus Temple.

The temple was ablaze with lanterns, a scene of shimmering gold and jade. Hazy white mist cascaded like waterfalls down the steps and through the windows. In the great pool at the center, milky white liquid rippled, exuding a faint bloody smell.

A group of young, beautiful, bare-chested women knelt by the pool. Amidst the scent of oils and incense, they pressed their hands to their chests, adding their own contributions to the milk pool. A man lay within the churning liquid, completely naked, a wicked look on his face as he breathed out in leisurely fashion.

Suddenly, a robed monk appeared, cautiously kneeling at the foot of the steps. 

“My lord… my lord… someone from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm is here!”

The young man in the pool snapped his eyes open, his gaze filled with ice.

This was not good news. No wonder the monk was trembling, frozen to the steps, not daring to breathe.

But the youth had no mind to deal with him. He rose languidly from the pool. 

“Let him come up.”

The sound of footsteps echoed as a plainly dressed monk ascended the stairs. He stopped before the great pool, his brow furrowing at the debauched scene.

The youth merely lifted his eyelids, legs splashing casually in the pool, exposing himself brazenly. He sneered,

“So, it’s Maha Fachang…”

He smiled faintly. “It seems the dharma-realm is quite lenient. I heard you were thoroughly condemned on Mount Dayang, yet you’ve received no punishment at all. And you have the leisure to grace my humble abode.”

Fachang found the sight of the man’s appendage pointed directly at him extremely unsettling, but he possessed an excellent temperament and was foremost in the cultivation of the mind. He pressed his palms together—out of sight, out of mind.

“I have come to invite the Maha to head south!”

Hearing this, the youth’s face contorted in disbelief before he burst into loud laughter.

“Is this a joke? The great, merciful Maha Fachang, the Maha Fachang who occupies Jiangbei without stirring up the slightest conflict… is inviting me to go south! Are you no longer afraid of creating negative karma?”

Fachang kept his hands together, his expression serene, unmoved by the laughter. 

“I have heard that a new dynasty is poised to rise in the south and the riverbank is fraught with danger. Yet Peacock has left for his own selfish desires… News came from Mount Dayang, ordering my dharma-realm to find one or two Mahas to go and stand guard.”

“Among the Seven Aspects, Discipline is silent, Wrath has fallen into decline, and Evil Desire, Emptiness, and Compassion are all in collusion. Besides my dharma-realm, only the Way of Joyful Bliss… has less of a penchant for slaughter.”

“I have also heard that for the past hundred years, you have allowed the people to live in peace, rarely engaging in killing. Though you indulge in pleasure, there is goodness and beauty in your rule, and the people adore you. After much thought, I concluded that you were the most suitable choice…”

These words seemed to carry some hidden insult. The youth’s face flushed. With a great splash, he stood up from the milk pool.

“Bullshit! What I cultivate in this life is the Body of Vile Terror and Shameless Defiance! Who the hell are you calling… who are you calling indulgent! Who are you calling someone who rarely kills and is well-loved!”

He glanced around, his anger flaring. He stepped out of the pool, dripping milk everywhere, and kicked one of the Merciful Ones beside him. “You dog slave! Do you adore me?”

The Merciful One trembled in fear. It was true that Jinlian had killed less in recent years, but that was only towards the common people under his rule. The ranks of the Way of Joyful Bliss were packed to the brim, with legions of monks waiting for a position. He wouldn't care about the death of one or two Merciful Ones; he had certainly killed plenty of his own subordinates!

The man could only shake his head rapidly. Then he met the youth’s wicked eyes and, as if realizing something, began to nod. After two nods, he started shaking his head again, utterly lost. He dropped to his knees and began kowtowing frantically.

“Who the hell are you kowtowing to!”

Jinlian sent him flying with a kick, and the Merciful One’s head flew several meters away, rolling down the steps with a series of thuds. Still not satisfied, Jinlian fumed. Fachang, watching the man’s appendage sway with his every movement, finally could not bear it any longer.

“Fellow Daoist!” he sighed.

Jinlian lowered his leg. The headless Merciful One scrambled up, picked up a cloth, and began to wipe his master’s body. The expression on Jinlian’s face abruptly vanished, replaced by a cold mask.

“You people have really planned this well. You insist on dragging my Way of Joyful Bliss into this? It seems I have been cultivating for too long, and you have all forgotten what I am capable of… You dare ask me to go south? If I slaughter my way through Jiangbei until heads roll like stones, I wonder on whose shoulders that karma will fall!”

Fachang’s face was calm. “No matter who I ask, the karma will fall upon me… But I do not cultivate to avoid danger or seek advantage. By taking on this task, I can choose someone who will cause less slaughter. No matter how much karma I bear, if the people of Jiangbei can be spared, one less death is one less death. That is what truly matters.”

His words stopped Jinlian in his tracks. The youth stared at him, dumbfounded. 

“To think there is such a stubborn monk like you in this world! You’re determined to ruin your own Dao-Profundity!”

Fachang’s expression did not change. He said nothing. Just then, another monk ascended the steps. His body shone with a golden light, his skin as translucent as jade. He smiled brightly and bowed.

“Greetings, Master, and Senior Fachang!”

Fachang turned and glanced at him. “And who might this be?”

The monk looked up, a benevolent smile on his face. “This humble monk is Minghui! I have the honor of being my master’s attendant Maha… It is a pleasure to meet you!”

# Chapter 1022: A Difficult Position

Fachang’s expression was initially one of doubt, but then he saw Minghui smile.

“Senior may not recognize me, but I have certainly heard of you. I was also present at the Great Yang Mountain Dharma Assembly, watching from the foot of the stairs… I remember you well!”

His words were undoubtedly a little tactless. After all, Fachang had gone to Mount Dayang to be reprimanded. Minghui’s claim to have been watching from below meant he had witnessed the full extent of Fachang’s disgrace. Yet, Fachang merely sighed.

“I’ve made a fool of myself in front of you, Minghui.”

Minghui laughed. “A fool? Senior is too kind, but I wouldn’t call it that! After you came down from the mountain without a word and went to the foot of the dais, I was the next one to go up. The great one rewarded me with a slap that nearly took my head off. It was a blow to my body, but a sting to my master’s heart!”

Fachang was suddenly at a loss for words. He was good-natured, but not a fool. He understood the hidden meaning perfectly.

‘A slap to you, Minghui, was a slap to Jinlian's face.’

Although the Way of Joyful Bliss was nominally under the command of Mount Dayang, they were the most rebellious faction in private. They didn't dare to disobey openly, but they were no strangers to shirking their duties and playing tricks. The problem was, the Way of Joyful Bliss was too influential. Unless they made a fundamental error, Mount Dayang had no real way to deal with them. Slapping a disciple’s face was little more than a helpless act of venting.

From his tone, Fachang knew that the Way of Joyful Bliss was still resentful toward Mount Dayang, and it was precisely this streak of cunning defiance that he needed.

But he couldn’t speak rashly. The eminent masters of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm had been actively involved in Mount Dayang’s affairs for years, hoping to use its influence to restrain the Seven Phases and realize their vision of a paradise on earth. They not only relied heavily on Mount Dayang but were themselves part of its heritage. So, for the moment, he remained silent.

Minghui glanced at him, understanding that the stubborn monk still held some respect for Mount Dayang. He adjusted his sleeves and smiled.

“Please, let’s speak inside!”

‘Finally, someone with a brain at Lotus Temple…’

Having stood there awkwardly for what felt like an eternity, Fachang nodded quickly. He took two steps forward, but when he saw Jinlian swaggering over, he could no longer contain himself. He turned, pressed his palms together, and pleaded,

“Your Eminence, please put away your Dharma Treasure!”

Jinlian’s eyes widened, his mouth opening as if to curse. Minghui, looking embarrassed, stepped between them to block their line of sight.

“Please, don’t be offended, don’t be offended…” he said, smiling.

As he spoke, he pulled a golden kasaya from his sleeve. With a gentle flick, he draped it over Jinlian, tying a knot at his chest that covered the offending object.

“Please!” he said again.

Fachang’s expression softened considerably. He moved past them and ascended the golden steps behind the main hall. Jinlian sneered from behind him.

“Fachang! You are caught up in superficial appearances! In my Dao, I view a person as I would a white skeleton. With further contemplation, they are nothing more than the five virtues and twelve streams of qi. The sacred teachings speak of Glazed Contemplation. If you cannot let go of a bit of nakedness, how can you ever let go of the world?”

Fachang took another step forward and, with his palms pressed together, replied,

“It is precisely because I cannot let go of the world.”

Jinlian laughed.

“Those who cannot let go cannot take hold. Those who cannot take hold cannot save. Those who cannot let go of the world wish to control it. And when masters all seek to control… they inevitably fall into endless conflict. What then becomes of the world? Only those who can let go of the world can transmit the sacred teachings and let the people be responsible for themselves. Fachang! It is this inability to let go that all cultivators dislike.”

A smile touched the lips of this Maha, who seemed more like a bandit lord. For a fleeting moment, his eyes grew brighter, filled with a touch of radiance, and he exuded the divine air of the master of Lotus Temple. Fachang simply turned his head away and did not respond.

Minghui wasn’t a student of doctrine, but he knew how much trouble his master could be. His heart pounded in his chest.

Years ago, after Jinlian’s first visit to Mount Dayang, he had barely set foot back in Lotus Temple before spouting utter heresy. He had called the Great Adoration Dharma Realm the “Great Landlord Realm” and the Way of Great Desire the “Lesser Landlord Realm”—as if they were the twisted heirs of the great landlord's side branch, just waiting for the landlord to die.

The Way of Emptiness was the Way of the Headless and Brainless, and the Way of Discipline was the Way of the Selfish and Mute. As for Wrath, it bred fools, and Compassion harbored mongrels. All others were “heretical paths that greatly deceive the masses.”

At the time, Minghui had hastily added, “Only our Way of Joyful Bliss is truly radiant!”

But Jinlian had only spat back, “Pah! Neither joyful nor blissful. It is the Way of Vicious Suffering!”

With this precedent, Minghui truly feared his master would call them the “Great Landlord Realm” to Fachang’s face. He quickly interjected to smooth things over, gesturing for Fachang to sit.

“How does Senior plan to proceed?” he asked, cutting off any further discussion.

Fachang pressed his palms together. “I need to borrow two Maha. If that’s not possible, one will do. But I will need many more Merciful Ones. After all, the Lotus Temple’s Dao lineage is prosperous, with abundant incense offerings… you are not lacking in that department.”

Minghui nodded and glanced at his master. Jinlian was looking back at him, a silent understanding passing between them.

‘Going south… this is definitely about confronting the one by the lake…’

This was a deeply troublesome matter, and Lotus Temple had suffered for it before. Minghui’s heart hammered in his chest with an unspoken anxiety. Jinlian, however, watched Fachang with a heavy gaze.

“So, Fachang is determined to have me go south,” he said, his voice low.

Fachang frowned. “With all due respect, this is a fine opportunity for a Maha, and it will greatly aid in the refinement of your Dharma Body. What… what is the meaning of this, Daoist friend?”

Minghui’s heart skipped a beat. Jinlian, his expression unchanged, sneered. “I need no help. I can achieve it on my own. But if I am injured, all my previous efforts might be wasted. Lotus Temple has stayed out of this matter for the sake of stability…”

Fachang grew even more confused. “Naturally, I would prefer not to trouble Your Eminence to act personally,” he said quietly, “but why are the other Maha of your esteemed Dao… or rather, why is this Maha Minghui, not tempted?”

Minghui cursed inwardly, but his face was a mask of sorrow. “I cannot bear to see the devastation of living creatures!”

“Ah?”

The word caught in Fachang’s throat. He paused, a look of sudden realization dawning on him.

“If you have any requests, Daoist friend, please state them freely!”

Master and disciple fell silent in unison. Fachang gritted his teeth. “If you two Great Masters are willing to act on my behalf and go south to reduce the coming slaughter, I am willing to offer you the Dharma Realm’s Triple-Venerable Purple Aura Fruit!”

Minghui’s brow furrowed, but the moment the words were out, Jinlian slapped the table. He spread his legs wide, rested his hands on his knees, and grinned.

“Now that’s more like it!”

“Then it is settled… I will not disturb you any longer!”

Fachang let out a breath of relief. Finally, he wouldn’t have to look at the man anymore. He rose to his feet at once, so eager to leave before Jinlian could say anything else that he didn’t spare another word. He stepped into the Great Void and vanished.

For a time, only the master and disciple remained in the vast, empty golden hall. Minghui opened his mouth to speak, but stopped when he saw Jinlian rise, his smile gone, his expression as cold as ice.

“This matter could not be refused. It is, after all, a good thing. The conflict between north and south was postponed once already. To refuse again would certainly arouse suspicion. We simply had to raise the price before agreeing.”

Their concerns were the same. Minghui lowered his voice. “This is all my fault for implicating you, Master!”

Years ago, he had caused a disaster. Jinlian had merely glanced at his dharma artifact and brought a great calamity upon himself. Not only was his painstakingly cultivated Immaculate Body of the Buddhas shattered, but even his soul had been damaged. It took him a full century to recover, which indirectly cost him an opportunity during the north-south conflict and delayed Minghui’s own ascension to the rank of Maha until now. Yet, neither of them felt a shred of resentment.

The reason was simple: the methods of that great figure were too terrifying. Although Jinlian was not physically in the Buddhist Land, he was still under the watchful eye of a mighty power. He had dared to peek so brazenly only because a trace of his True Spirit was anchored in the Buddhist Land, with a Dharma Master as his guarantor! Any disturbance from his prying would surely have alerted the Dharma Master. If all was well, he could have claimed the prize for himself!

But even though his True Spirit was anchored in the Buddhist Land, he was grievously injured, and none of the other cultivators noticed a thing! Even when Hongshan Maha Liangli saw Jinlian in person, he only lamented his failure to cultivate the Immaculate Body. And this terrifying power was unleashed merely from viewing Minghui’s severed arm within the dharma artifact!

‘It was either the Underworld or another True Monarch. If it was the Underworld, they could have simply annihilated Minghui, or made it so that no one could divine anything about him, as they did in the past… Why act like this?’

Although neither knew what Jinlian had truly experienced or what kind of technique had afflicted his soul, they had long since identified the suspect as being on the level of a True Monarch—and one who possessed great power but could not reveal it in the outside world!

Later, when the Li family’s Bright Yang manifested, Minghui reported it at once. Initially, without a second thought, they had locked their sights on that Monarch Father, the Wei Emperor, Li Qianyuan.

‘It fits perfectly…’

But upon deeper reflection, Jinlian felt something was wrong.

‘The heavenly might of Wu Earth is so immense, how could there be such a flaw? If Li Qianyuan possessed such power, why would he stand by and watch Luoxia inflict such harm?’

The Bright Yang Dao was a lineage where the strong grew stronger and the weak grew weaker. Its situation was plain for all to see—it was an orthodoxy of extreme defiance. If Li Qianyuan still possessed such ability, it meant he was in excellent condition, powerful enough to slap a Dharma Master twice without anyone daring to object. Why go through all this trouble?

Furthermore, no matter how divine that person’s abilities were, the northern cultivators’ reverence for Luoxia was real. They couldn’t believe Luoxia had miscalculated. Thus, the two shifted their suspicion to the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition.

‘It must be a True Monarch from the Encompassing Profoundity Dao… one who cannot show himself at present… or who is plotting something. Since there is turmoil between north and south, perhaps this is when they intend to use us!’

Jinlian didn’t dare say more. He only whispered, “Now is not the time to speak of this. I had intended to walk a straight path to radiance, but my cultivation has run into problems these past years. My soul is afflicted, and my progress has stalled. I had no choice but to secretly practice a body-splitting art, dividing my soul to conceal my injuries…”

“I’ve managed to cover it up for now, but I cannot leave the Buddhist Land. I still require a large amount of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, so I can’t be of much help. I’ll have your disciple-brother go with you. He is ignorant of these matters… you must look after him in all things… and try not to make it look too obvious…”

Minghui nodded vigorously, a bitter taste in his mouth.

‘If I weren’t afraid of arousing suspicion, I would never go south. Even if I did, and Li Zhouwei slapped my face, I would say, ‘Thank you, thank you.’ If he tried to kill me with his halberd… I would bare my chest to receive it! But now… I can only watch how the situation develops…’

Before he could speak, his expression changed abruptly. He pulled a shining jade talisman from his sleeve. The patterns on its surface shifted rapidly before it shattered with a sharp crack, turning into white sand that trickled through his fingers.

He raised his head, trembling with apprehension, and looked at Jinlian. 

“There’s… there’s news from Yinzhou Island!”

“Yinzhou Island?”

Maha Jinlian froze for a second, then reacted almost instantly.

‘The channel we established through others… the trade deal with the Li family… there’s been a development!’

The two monks shot to their feet, their eyes meeting. A numbing premonition surged through them both.

‘Could it be… that the great one… intends to use us now!’

---

Eastern Sea.

A storm was brewing, the winds howling fiercely.

On the island, golden light shimmered and dharma radiances intertwined. A few cultivators patrolled between the islets as waves crashed on either side. Midway, they spotted a figure.

He had the refined air of a scholar, dressed in a simple white robe. He flew through the air with an elegant yet urgent posture. The driving rain beat against his protective light, making it gleam brilliantly.

It was Cui Jueyin.

The direct descendant of the Cui family had returned home years ago, and his cultivation had grown ever more profound. Perhaps due to some secret art he practiced, his eyes shone with a piercing light.

But his usually steady brows were now knitted with anxiety. The escaping light beneath his feet sped up, and soon he was riding the wind down toward the sea. The water below was dark and murky, as if countless flood dragons were slithering through its depths.

In the distance, Chongzhou Island was visible. Its shores were lined with Cui family cultivators, and various altars and treasure halls had been erected in a solemn display. Before he could even land, a middle-aged man rode the wind up to meet him, his face a mask of misery.

“Second Brother!” he sighed.

Cui Jueyin nodded silently, following the man’s gaze toward the horizon. Clouds were gathering, morphing into the dim glow of Converging Water, like cascading waterfalls of interwoven light.

The middle-aged man whispered, “Second Brother… what are we to do? You… you always have a way…”

Hearing this, Cui Jueyin let out a heavy sigh.

He wasn’t wrong. When Li Ximing came to the island all those years ago, Cui Xianye had been genuinely terrified. The disciple he sent, Cui Jueyin, though not the most talented, was the most adept at handling matters. It wasn’t a matter of loyalty; he was simply afraid an ignorant disciple would offend Li Ximing and bring disaster upon the island.

And Cui Jueyin, having served for decades in a key position at Moongaze Lake, had seen his share of schemes and betrayals. He was a world apart from the sheltered disciples of Chongzhou Island. Shaking his head gently, he replied, 

“Juechen, since the visitors are from the sea, what other way is there? We can only be respectful and serve them well.”

Just as he finished speaking, the sea below began to churn violently. A muffled roar echoed as the water bulged upward like a hill. A colossal creature broke the surface, sending up a tremendous splash.

A dark shadow instantly enveloped the entire shoreline. As the waves rolled back, two dark, massive shapes were revealed—it was a beast the size of a mountain, covered in scales.

As light reflected off its scales, the entire coast fell silent, the water shimmering. Cui Jueyin silently stepped aside. Cui Juechen, looking rather timid, took a step forward, bowed low, and said respectfully, “This humble cultivator, Cui Juechen of the Chongzhou Cui Clan, greets the envoy!”

A long, droning sound emanated from the beast’s mouth, kicking up a spray of white foam. Then, a cold, arrogant voice barked from its back.

“Who are you! Where is Cui Xianye!”

A cold sweat broke out on Cui Juechen’s brow. Before he could answer, the giant beast before him let out a ferocious roar. A green fish descended from the sky, riding the water. It had a pair of scaly wings under its gills, and its huge fish eyes glared at him with clear displeasure.

“How dare you be slow in a matter concerning the Flood Dragon Palace! Such audacity!” it sneered.

The overbearing declaration sent a stir through the Cui family members, who began to whisper among themselves. Cui Jueyin also frowned inwardly.

‘I heard that when this Dharma Protector came in previous years, he was always very polite… A few days ago when we sent a report to the Flood Dragon Palace, he refused to see us. Now he arrives so aggressively. It’s clear his attitude has soured… Could it be that he finds the bribe insufficient… and wants to raise the price on the spot…’

This was his first time meeting this particular sea patroller. He’d heard the demon was transferred from the south, originally a minor demon who had somehow gained favor and risen rapidly through the ranks. Now, he was notoriously difficult to serve.

The Cui family had, after all, once offered a spiritual item to the Eastern Wanderer. For years, they had held a certain standing among the Dragon-kin. When several of their respected elders had died after failing to break through, the Dragon Palace had even sent representatives.

But without a Purple Mansion Realm expert, all past glory was fleeting. Their standing declined day by day. The previous sea patroller was already discourteous, and now a minor demon transferred from some forgotten corner had the post and could throw his weight around with the Cui family!

“Patroller Hui… Patroller Hui, you misunderstand!”

Cui Juechen had already been given a hard time by him in the sea and was clearly on edge. His body trembled as he dropped to the ground in a full bow, crying out,

“Grandfather… he failed in his breakthrough attempt and perished last year!”

He had clearly reached the same conclusion as his brother. He took out several storage bags from his sleeve, offered them up with both hands, and said respectfully,

“We are deeply remorseful for our late report. These spiritual resources… are an apology to Your Excellency!”

The green fish-like demon sneered and, in a flash, snatched the storage bags from his hands. But his expression remained ugly. He clutched the bags tightly and said coldly,

“An apology? Do you think your grandfather here came to this post just to hear you apologize? I showed you some decency because of your family’s connection to the lake, but it seems I’ve given you too many smiles. You’ve grown insolent!”

His face was hideous, and beads of slime dripped from it. He tucked the storage bags into his sleeve, his tone dripping with sarcasm.

“Well, well… who dares to give me a hard time… Daoist Master Yangya… what a temper he has!”

---

Thank you for all the blessings! I’m very grateful!

Wishing everyone good health and great fortune!




# Chapter 1023: Zhaoyuan

The Demon beast’s words were blunt, directly scolding the Cui family’s Daoist Master. This caused the faces of all the cultivators present to change. They exchanged glances and lowered their heads. Cui Juechen, kneeling at the front, remained frozen, not daring to make a sound.

Beside him, Cui Jueyin was even more stunned, a wave of bitterness washing over his heart.

'So that's how it is... so that's how it is...'

But the Demon beast stood with its head held high, a cold smile on its face.

The sea patrollers were Dragon-kin, with positions of varying ranks. Most were just putting on airs, borrowing the might of their superiors, and wouldn't normally dare to offend someone with a divine ability. Daoist Master Yangya, however, was an exception.

Back then, when the Cui clan established itself in the Eastern Sea, they faced the real danger of annihilation. The Cui Family Head at the time had urgently sought help from the Flood Dragon Palace, offering a Radiant Profound Origin to solve the Dragon King's pressing problem. Only then did they gain a firm foothold in the Eastern Sea. From that day forward, the Cui family relied on the Dragon-kin. Though they weren't official subordinates, they were subordinates in practice.

The Cui clan had risen from under the Dragon-kin's protection and had been based in the Eastern Sea for years. Logically, after achieving a divine ability, he should have paid a visit to the palace. But he had holed up in the Western Sea, ignoring his obligations... Still, his branch of the family was based in the Western Sea, which gave him a plausible excuse, so he hadn't been given much trouble.

If Daoist Master Yangya were present, this Demon beast wouldn't dare utter a word of ridicule... But everyone understood that while the Dragon King might not care, there were others in the sea who were displeased. Yangya had always avoided meeting with envoys of the Dragon-kin. Thus, the Demon beast's scolding was delivered with righteous confidence, knowing it had backing.

What could Cui Juechen do? His words carried little weight. He could neither argue with the Demon beast nor push the blame onto Daoist Master Yangya. All he could do was knock his head on the ground repeatedly.

“The divine ability's arrangements… we truly do not know. We only know that my second brother… his cultivation has reached a bottleneck and he has a chance to break through to the divine ability realm. He retrieved resources from the lake… I believe the two Daoist Masters must have given their consent… I hope the Sea Patroller will consider my second brother's situation and spare us!”

As soon as he said this, the cultivators on both sides fell to their knees. The Sea Patroller Huiyao's face hardened as he snarled,

“Are you implying… that I am making things difficult for you out of personal bias!”

“We wouldn't dare…”

Cries rose from all around. The giant beast on the sea roared again, sending water splashing everywhere, instantly silencing the clamor. The Sea Patroller Huiyao flicked his sleeve, saying with waning interest,

“Enough, enough… Tell that second brother of yours to come out and speak with me!”

As if granted a pardon, he quickly retreated. Cui Jueyin stepped forward, bowed, and said respectfully,

“Cui Jueyin, disciple of the Chongzhou Cui clan, greets you, my lord!”

“Oh!”

The Demon beast's cold expression vanished, replaced by a warm, eager smile.

“So it's you! Goodness! Why call me 'my lord'? You flatter me too much!”

The Demon beast's abrupt switch from arrogance to deference was startling. Even Cui Jueyin lost his composure for a moment, allowing himself to be led forward in a daze as the creature chuckled,

“You… you… what's all this 'Chongzhou' and 'Cui clan' nonsense? This place can't contain you! If I were you, I'd swagger around and act like the master of this place. I wouldn't call myself 'Cui Jueyin of the Chongzhou Cui clan.' I'd call myself 'Envoy Cui Jueyin, under the command of the Qilin'! Wouldn't that be impressive!”

Cui Jueyin didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but he maintained a meek expression, replying,

“I couldn't possibly… I couldn't possibly…”

“Of course you could!”

The Demon beast was utterly shameless. It pulled him by the hand to walk inside, but suddenly noticed the surroundings had fallen silent. All the Cui family members had raised their heads, staring intently into the distance.

“Hey!”

The Sea Patroller Huiyao's temper flared, and he was about to start scolding again when his ears twitched. He realized that even the sound of the waves had ceased. The world around them seemed to brighten, and the very sand on the beach glowed with a golden light.

This made his heart skip a beat,

'Heavens… don't tell me Yangya is back!'

To be caught acting tough by the master of the house… Huiyao was suddenly mortified, his heart pounding. It didn't matter if Yangya would dare to bear the consequences of killing him; if a fight broke out, he would surely be the one to die!

Trembling with fear, he turned his head and saw a brilliant radiance within the dark, gloomy clouds. A man with golden eyes, dressed in a long robe with sleeves embroidered with gold patterns, was stepping out of the Great Void, standing silently amidst the clouds.

Those golden eyes swept over them casually, seeming to freeze the very air on the beach. Huiyao's mind went blank. He heard the young man beside him take a step forward, drop to his knees with a thud, and say in a trembling voice,

“Jueyin pays his respects to Your Highness!”

His voice was slightly hoarse, filled with excitement and bewilderment. The young man in the clouds looked down, his gaze softening slightly,

“Jueyin.”

_Thump!_

The next to kneel was the Sea Patroller. His fish-like face contorted, and his eyes were fixed on the ground as he cried out,

“Huiyao… Huiyao pays his respects to Your Highness!”

This Demon was none other than Huiyao! He had once served in the Southern Sea, responsible for managing the offerings for the Li family's overseas base, Zongquan Island… He was an old acquaintance of the Li family!

A dazzling Heavenly Light descended, and Li Zhouwei was already before them. He recognized him at a glance, a hint of surprise in his voice,

“Huiyao? You've certainly made progress!”

The Demon beast pressed its head to the ground, not moving an inch, displaying extreme humility,

“Your Highness's radiance is brilliant, a splendor of ten thousand glories. A sliver of it graced this humble Demon, bringing me good fortune ever since. To be able to patrol the seas in such a prosperous place… this lowly one is eternally grateful… I heard that Daoist Master Yangya was being insolent, and I was just questioning them about it…”

He spoke with such righteousness that the Cui family members who heard him were shaken, finally realizing who stood before them.

'So it's this Highness...'

Li Zhouwei shook his head with a laugh. The massive Demon beast in the sea had already vanished, transforming into a middle-aged man who walked over cautiously and bowed in silence.

Huiyao didn't dare to get up. With his face still pressed to the ground, he forced a wide smile and made the introduction,

“This… this is General Zhanlin… he has also had the honor of meeting Your Highness before… He is a good friend of Ying Hebai. They once performed a martial arts display for Your Highnesses, a connection from long ago…”

“A Treasure-Scaled Ferry-Beast.”

Li Zhouwei nodded for him to rise and raised an eyebrow,

“Ying Hebai… how is he now?”

This Ying Hebai was the Northern Brocade River King, once a river Demon from Jiangbei. He had offered some small help in the past but had withdrawn after the incident with Li Qianyuan and vanished without a trace.

Huiyao seemed to sigh with emotion, replying,

“He is also of noble descent, but I heard he has a relative, perhaps an older sister or some other elder, who served under the Xu Water Demon King… For some reason, she fell out of favor, and after some jealous dispute, she was captured by the Demon King… and thrown in prison.”

“When Ying Hebai returned from Jiangbei, he had already lost most of his power and authority, no longer deserving of the title 'King'. He tried day after day to rescue his relative, which displeased the Demon King… He has fallen on very hard times!”

Li Zhouwei listened for a moment. Cui Jueyin, gritting his teeth silently, raised his head and said,

“Reporting to Your Highness… this subordinate also knows of him. When Guest Retainer Ding was trapped in Jiangbei, it was he who saved him…”

“I see.”

Li Zhouwei nodded and asked,

“His Highness Dingjiao… is there any news of him?”

At these words, Huiyao, who had just stood up, knelt down again, his face beaming,

“The Crown Prince has achieved a divine ability!”

“Oh?”

A smile touched Li Zhouwei's lips.

“That is truly wonderful news! When is the celebratory banquet? I should prepare a gift and offer my congratulations!”

“There was supposed to be a banquet…”

Huiyao's expression turned serious, and he lowered his voice,

“But recently, a major event has occurred in the sea. An elder of the Dragon-kin has had a joyous occasion… and no one is exempt, not even His Highness. The banquet has been postponed. His Highness… His Highness set off a day ago to offer his congratulations…”

'A day ago...'

Li Zhouwei felt a flicker of gravity, but his expression remained natural. He expressed his regret, then glanced around and said,

“I won't disturb your patrol then.”

“Your Highness is too kind!”

Huiyao chuckled, replying,

“Since Your Highness is here, this lowly one would never dream of disturbing your mood. What is there left to patrol…”

Since meeting the Li clan on Zongquan, Huiyao's official career had been smooth sailing. His clan's standing in the sea had improved significantly, for which he was naturally grateful. He bowed deeply and said respectfully,

“Please, Your Highness, go ahead!”

Li Zhouwei paid the two Demon beasts little mind. He nodded and began walking toward the island's interior. The people on both sides hastily moved aside. Cui Juechen, watching this, was terrified. He scrambled forward on his hands and knees and kowtowed beside him,

“My lord… let this lowly one serve you!”

These Dragon-kin Demon beasts were notoriously arrogant. Who else could he be, to command such reverence from a Dragon-kin Sea Patroller, to possess such a dazzling divine ability, and to be addressed as 'Your Highness' by Cui Jueyin?

He scrambled up from the ground, not even bothering to straighten his sleeves, and led Li Zhouwei forward with a stooped back. They walked all the way to the golden Celestial Hall at the highest point, where he invited the lord to take the central seat and waited on him respectfully.

Just then, an old man with a full head of white hair came up the steps, sat down beside him, and said respectfully,

“This humble cultivator, Cui Changyan, greets the Daoist Master.”

This must be the elder currently in charge of the island. Cui Jueyin immediately stood up to serve tea. Li Zhouwei turned his head and asked him,

“Jueyin, Yangya told you to return and focus on your cultivation, yet you are still out here, running errands.”

As soon as these words were spoken, the Cui family members on both sides broke out in a cold sweat. Given this man's divine ability and his relationship with the Dragon-kin… if he were displeased, Chongzhou would suffer immensely!
Fortunately, Cui Jueyin quickly bowed and replied,

“The seas have been restless recently. It happened to coincide with me coming out of seclusion, so I came to help stand guard…”

This made Li Zhouwei put down his cup. He raised an eyebrow and looked at Cui Changyan. The old man quickly averted his gaze, looking down without a word, his forehead beaded with sweat.

Li Zhouwei said nothing. His golden eyes stared at the old man, who felt as if he were being scorched by a blazing sun. His heart pounded with guilt, and beads of sweat trickled down the wrinkles on his face. His tightly pursed, aged lips began to tremble, on the verge of speaking.

“Your Highness!”

But Cui Jueyin took a step forward. The white-robed young man dropped to his knees with a thud, holding a bowl of clear tea above his head as he pleaded,

“Your Highness, please have some tea!”

The golden-eyed young man paused. He finally shifted his gaze away from the elder, gave Cui Jueyin a deep look, took the tea from his hands, and sipped it lightly.

“I came this time… for one, to see you.”

“And two… to meet the descendants of the Wei.”

The hall fell silent, the only sound his calm voice,

“Let us speak of the old empire.”

He raised his cup and listened as the old man let out a deep sigh,

“Reporting to Your Highness… my Cui clan… has seven main branches. My Chongzhou Cui clan descends from the third branch. Our ancestors were originally one family with the Dongli Cui clan, but their branch was more noble and once produced a True Monarch… During Wei's time, our branch focused on cultivation and often managed affairs in the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate…”

“Later, Emperor Gong of Wei wished to find Penglai and sent our ancestors out on treasure ships… but they searched for years without success. We settled in Chongzhou and continued to look for clues… But then great chaos erupted on the mainland, causing the Great Void to shatter and spiritual energy to fluctuate wildly… We lost contact and had no one to give us orders, so we made our home on the island.”

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, asking,

“The Great Void shattered… how did it shatter?”

A look of horror appeared on Cui Changyan's face. He replied,

“The books describe this event with only four words, but the story passed down was this… It was said that spiritual energy gathered but would not disperse, becoming chaotic and disordered, like a thousand ribbons of light scattered across heaven and earth. In the sea, there were streaks and bands of it—some condensed into mist, others were completely devoid of spiritual energy…”

Li Zhouwei understood immediately. The Great Void was fundamentally based on spiritual energy. If a place had no spiritual energy, the Great Void would not exist there, and one could not find a point in the Great Void to descend to that location. If the spiritual energy in the physical world had truly condensed into ribbons, the Great Void would have been fragmented into countless pieces…

He pondered for a moment and asked,

"Which of the Three Profoundities does the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate belong to? How many True Monarchs were there, and how did they fare during Wei's fall?"

Cui Changyan gritted his teeth, replying,

“According to the mainland's classification, it should belong to the Encompassing Profoundity of the Three Profoundities, but this classification isn't entirely accurate…”

His tone held a hint of pride,

“Bright Yang was the Emperor, his title Guanyuan. He sacrificed at the grand temple and opened the Qian Palace. With the beat of war drums, he subjugated the world's transcendent factions and abolished thirty-two hundred sects—True Daoist cultivators had their crowns removed and their wings clipped; the demon child of Qinling Temple was slain and his head hung high; the evil cults of the sacred mountains were bound and brought to Wei; the small shamanic states were overthrown and their people captured… The guilty were executed, the worthy were assimilated. The innocent were taken in and incorporated into the Zhaoyuan Estate, all for the sake of the world…”

“The Zhaoyuan Estate resided in the Wei Huang Heaven. It did not belong to any single Daoist Tradition; it was the law estate of the Daoist Tradition for the entire Wei dynasty!”

Li Zhouwei lifted his chin, his gaze changing slightly,

“So, it was a tradition unto itself.”

After finishing the last word, Cui Changyan fell from that magnificent past back to the bleak reality. The fire in his eyes vanished as he said in a low voice,

“As for a True Monarch… I have only heard of one… His Daoist title is unknown, but he never entered the imperial court.”

“Never entered the imperial court.”

Now that was interesting. It immediately caught Li Zhouwei's attention.

Wei practiced the law of an immortal kingdom. All official positions, great and small, were imbued with power. Even a mortal without any cultivation would gain a measure of it upon receiving a post, and the highest offices came with a divine ability… Not entering the imperial court most likely meant this True Monarch had achieved his cultivation on his own!

He gently set down his cup. He suddenly sensed something, and looking up, a curious smile spread across his face.

In an instant, the entire island began to shake. A brilliant radiance appeared in the sky, and the rolling dark clouds immediately receded, revealing floating, colorful clouds and countless rays of Heavenly Light!

This Heavenly Light was not overbearing or intense, but soft as fluff, like a waterfall cascading down through layers of clouds. It drifted down onto the rooftops and draped over the window curtains like a countless white rain, flowing among the palaces.

A clamor erupted across the island. Cui Jueyin was still young and didn't know what this phenomenon signified. He looked up, bewildered. Cui Changyan's face, however, turned deathly pale.

The old man had witnessed this spectacle of the changing Bright Yang countless times. His father, his brothers, one after another had fallen. Now that the phenomenon had appeared again, the color drained from his face. He sat frozen in his seat, terrified, and looked at Li Zhouwei with a pleading gaze.

But he saw the golden-eyed young man shake his head with amusement, saying calmly,

“Congratulations!”

Shock filled Cui Jueyin's eyes. An explosion of ecstatic joy erupted on Cui Changyan's face. He stood up from his seat as if in a dream, looking from Cui Jueyin to Li Zhouwei. The joy transformed into boundless shock, making his lips tremble, unable to speak.

He fell to his knees with a thud and began to kowtow, as if completely drained of strength. He wept,

“I never knew Your Highness was such a figure!”

Li Zhouwei [Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm]

Cui Jueyin 'Eternal Brightness Steps' [Peak Foundation Establishment Realm] [Chongzhou Cui Clan]




# Chapter 1024: Dongli

The skies over Chongzhou churned with clouds of interwoven color. A mottled stone gate trembled, shedding fine streams of dust.

"Divine ability refined!"

An endless sea of the Great Void emerged in his spiritual sense, and Cui Changfu felt tears welling in his eyes.

'How many years has it been? How many long years! My Cui clan has lived under another's roof... year after year, we've had to tread carefully, catering to the whims of those with divine abilities. We even had to respectfully welcome any Demon beast that happened to pass by...'

'Now, at least within our own prefecture, there's finally a divine ability in charge... No longer will we have to borrow Daoist Master Yangya's prestige day after day, only to be scorned by him!'

The old man closed his eyes. Like every newly ascended cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm, he marveled at the sensation of the Great Void, just as the ancient texts described. Overcome with ecstasy, he took a step forward and entered it.

Cui Changfu's figure materialized from the brilliant Heavenly Light in an instant. He gazed at the radiant phenomena in the sky, a spectacle caused by his own breakthrough, and felt a surge of pride. He stopped before the golden steps of the great hall, only to find the area before the Celestial Hall empty, as if everyone had been dismissed long ago.

"Hm?"

Doubt and unease stirred in his heart. He placed a hand on the hall's door and pushed it gently.

"Creeaak..."

The heavy sound echoed through the great hall. Cui Changfu stepped forward, and the first person he saw was his own clan brother, Cui Changyan.

When Cui Changfu had entered seclusion, he was prepared to die. He had entrusted the clan's affairs to Cui Xianye, with the elderly Cui Changyan to assist. Yet now, this same old man was seated in a subordinate position, while a young man stood respectfully on the other side, a step higher than him.

'That must be the second brother from the Jue generation...'

Cui Changfu remembered Cui Jueyin clearly. Years ago, he had recognized the boy's intelligence and instructed Cui Xianye to nurture his talents. Though decades had passed, he still recognized him at a glance.

And there, at the far end of the bright hall, another young man occupied the master's seat. He appeared relaxed and casual, the gold-embroidered cuffs of his sleeves draping over the armrest, revealing a strong wrist that held a teacup with perfect stability.

His features were imposing, almost fierce, cast in shifting light and shadow by the Heavenly Light filtering in from the side of the hall. A pair of golden eyes stared across the vast space, meeting the gaze of the newly ascended Daoist Master.

Cui Changfu's mind went blank. The man was sitting casually, yet the reflection in his pupils was a dazzling fusion of brilliant Heavenly Light and the potent colors of a divine ability, a swirling expanse of gold and white.

'A Purple Mansion Realm expert!'

'A Purple Mansion Realm expert of the Bright Yang Dao!'

At the side, tears streamed down Cui Changyan's aged face as he watched from across the hall, but he didn't dare speak first. Cui Jueyin stepped down and moved aside, careful not to obstruct the view between the two Daoist Masters.

_Clink..._

A porcelain cup was set gently on the table, the crisp sound echoing in the hall. The young man nodded. "Congratulations, fellow Daoist."

Logically, even if Cui Changfu had only been at the Foundation Establishment Realm a moment before, his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm made him the master of this place. If another Purple Mansion expert came to visit and had taken the host's seat, they should have greeted him with a smile and graciously offered it back. But the young man before him made no move to rise, instead calmly inviting him in—a clear breach of etiquette.

Yet Cui Changfu felt not the slightest displeasure. Instead, he stared at those golden eyes, his heart pounding with fear, his mind illuminated by a single thought: 'The White Qilin has come...'

In every respect, Li Zhouwei had the right to that seat. Cui Changfu showed no sign of being offended. He bowed naturally and said in a weary voice, "Cui Changfu of Chongzhou greets Your Highness!"

He walked forward several paces until he stood before the young man's seat, gathered the hem of his robes, and bowed deeply.

"Forgive me for not welcoming you from afar, Your Highness!"

"Rise."

The golden-eyed young man gestured for him to take a seat to the side, his expression unruffled. He smiled and said, "Years ago, a Daoist Master from my family visited your clan and took a liking to Cui Jueyin. He brought him back for careful training. I never imagined your Daoist Master Yangya would call him back. I had some business out at sea today, so I decided to stop by and see him."

The words struck the old man like a clap of thunder. At his age, how could Cui Changfu fail to understand the implication? His world felt like it was collapsing.

'Cui Yushan! You took our Dao Lineage, demanded our spirit items, and spirited away our talented youth... and even that wasn't enough! Now you want to use my clan as a sacrifice to ensure your own safety! You... you!'

Whether the Cui clan wanted to sever ties or not, how much autonomy could they possibly have under the Dragon-kin? Daoist Master Yangya clearly didn't care if Chongzhou lived or died!

Rage surged through him. He gritted his teeth and spat, "That Yangya... he thinks only of himself, only of his Western Sea Cui clan! He has used every means possible to strip Chongzhou of its resources! I could say nothing about the Dao Lineage, the geniuses, the spirit items... we didn't dare utter a word of complaint. When outsiders asked, I had to smile and claim he was one of our own Daoist Masters... But when others asked him, he acted as if he'd never even heard of Chongzhou... and now he chooses to interfere!"

Cui Changfu lowered his head, his jaw clenched tight. He sighed. "To be perfectly honest, when Your Highness's elder came to the island back then... asking about Bright Yang spirit items, my clan couldn't produce a single one!"

Perhaps it was because their statuses had been so disparate before that Yangya’s actions had seemed acceptable. But now, as a Purple Mansion Realm master in his own right, many of those same actions felt utterly detestable. The fury on Cui Changfu's face was so genuine that Cui Changyan, standing nearby, froze in stunned confusion.

'So this is what my brother has been thinking all along... He was the one enduring the humiliation, bearing the burden. We were the ones who were too shortsighted...'

Cui Changyan then picked up the thread. "Later, when Daoist Master Zhaojing came to Chongzhou and also inquired about spirit items and resources, our clan had nothing to offer... for that very reason!"

"Everything was given to the Dragon King early on. Any scraps that remained were taken by Daoist Master Yangya in the name of 'safekeeping'... There is nothing left on the island!"

Li Zhouwei listened without surprise. He had met Yangya in the Grotto-Heaven and knew what kind of person he was. Instead of responding directly, he changed the subject.

"The matter of the Wei restoration demonstrated your clan's loyalty. But tell me... what is your connection to the Dongli Sect?"

Cui Changfu held his tea and remained silent. Cui Changyan, however, answered without hesitation. "The Dongli Sect was founded by two masters of the Cui clan, from the Dongli and Donghuo branches. The Sect Master's given name is Mu... This master... once cultivated in an Immortal Estate and later became the Grand Tutor in the imperial court. His status was... unparalleled in the dynasty!"

"Hm?"

Li Zhouwei murmured, "Cui Mu?!"

The Li clan was very familiar with that name. The first cultivation manual they ever obtained, the _Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art_, was written by this very cultivator! The work was attributed to the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate... meaning he wrote it before leaving seclusion to serve the court!

And the _Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art_ was a gift from the mirror!

For over a century, this was the first trace they had found of a Bright Yang method bestowed by the mirror! Li Zhouwei's focus sharpened, his guard instantly raised.

He frowned slightly and asked, "But that can't be right. If the Dongli Sect Master was a figure from the Wei era, how could he have survived for so long to become the master of the Dongli Sect? Was he a True Monarch?"

"What was Cui Mu's cultivation level?"

At this, Cui Changyan glanced hesitantly at his clan brother. Cui Changfu spoke up.

"If Your Highness must ask... then before the fall of the dynasty, he held the false rank of a True Monarch. After its fall, he was merely a Daoist Master."

Li Zhouwei's head tilted up slightly, his pupils dilating. He had heard descriptions from the Dragon-kin and understood what the man meant.

"The methods of an Immortal Dynasty... can they sustain a True Monarch?!"

Cui Changfu hesitated for a moment before shaking his head. "The Sect Master was a once-in-a-century genius of our Cui clan. He was selected to cultivate in the estate, and by the time he entered the imperial court, he had already perfected his divine ability."

"The Great Wei Celestial Dynasty, at its peak, had two positions of power. They differed with each emperor... but their functions were similar. During the reign of Emperor Gong of Wei, they were the 'Cardinal Minister of Culture and Order' and the 'Phoenix Marshal of Conquest and Exorcism'. When one of these positions was bestowed, they granted a 'false golden rank'. The Cardinal Minister held this power for domestic governance, while the Phoenix Marshal wielded it for external campaigns. Both possessed the might of a True Monarch..."

Li Zhouwei listened, frowning, as Cui Changfu continued. "The last Cardinal Minister of the Great Wei was the Sect Master. It was because he once possessed the might of a True Monarch that he was granted an extended lifespan, allowing him to move to the Yue State and establish a new sect."

"These two positions were prestigious, but they came with many cumbersome restrictions. Not only did one have to perfect their divine ability before even attempting to ascend to the role, but once the position was accepted, their path of cultivation was severed. There was no longer any chance to truly become a True Monarch. Their very life-mandate was bound to the fate of the nation..."

"When the Great Wei collapsed, the one holding the rank of Phoenix Marshal perished in Mobei. Although the Sect Master survived by relying on the Cui clan's bloodline oaths and his own Dao-Profundity, and was left with some esoteric abilities beyond the peak of the divine ability realm, his vital energy was grievously wounded. His existence became a living death, unable to walk the world freely, and in a fight, he was no match for a peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator."

A bitter look appeared on Cui Changfu's old face. "We only learned of this later... When the Dongli Sect was founded, his divine might seemed boundless. The world believed he had risen from the ashes, stronger than before, and had attained a high position within Bright Yang Dao..."

Li Zhouwei's expression was noncommittal.

'Who knows how much of that was just empty reputation? It might have been a deliberate ploy by the northern powers—letting him rise, only to strike three times and ensnare all those still loyal to the Wei-Li. A convenient way to prepare for their later efforts to 'shepherd' the Bright Yang...'

Cui Changfu continued in a somber tone, "Now, the Dongli Sect has fallen, and all that history has turned to dust. After all, people only pay attention to Grotto-Heavens that have yet to fall, or to lineages that still have value to be exploited..."

Li Zhouwei asked, "How did this master fall?"

Cui Changfu's expression turned grave. "We have no detailed records... but the elders of Chongzhou, by cross-referencing numerous texts from the old Wei, came to a conclusion. This master... likely succumbed to grievous injuries that never healed, eventually passing away in meditation."

He sighed. "The Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven produced many talents, but at the time, its relationship with the various sea-based Daoist traditions was tense, so much so that they were on the verge of attacking our mountain gate. The Sect Master's continued absence only emboldened these overseas traditions... while another Supreme Yang Daoist tradition established itself in Jiangnan, growing its power. We were beset by enemies from within and without."

"It was at this time that the Daoist Master Donghuo, who had been guarding the seas, fell near the Suzhù Reefs. He cultivated the path of Li Fire, and his divine abilities were astounding, having reached the peak of that realm... The celestial phenomenon at the time of his death was world-shaking. The nearby sea boiled, and endless Baleful Fire Qi rained down... To this day, that area is still saturated with potent Li Fire, creating countless salt reefs."

"Once the Daoist Master Donghuo fell, the Dongli Sect's precarious situation became untenable. The cultivators stationed in Chongzhou were all recalled, and the few ancestors my clan had sent over perished one after another. We never heard from them again..."

After listening to the tale, Li Zhouwei remarked with some emotion, "Your clan has guarded the Eastern Sea for many years. It has not been easy!"

Cui Changyan misinterpreted his meaning and hurriedly added, "The Chongzhou branch originally hailed from Zhaoyuan. But when the calamity befell the nation, we lost contact with the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate. Wei Huang Heaven was sealed... even the Wei cultivators on the mainland couldn't be reached, so naturally, our connection was severed..."

"Later... when the Qi... when the Qi rebels founded their dynasty and brought chaos to the north, it wasn't that we couldn't go back... we didn't dare!"

Li Zhouwei took a sip of tea, a hint of doubt in his eyes. "Tell me about the time before and after the Qi dynasty."

Cui Changyan paused, about to speak, but Cui Changfu cleared his throat. "He is only at the Foundation Establishment Realm; it is not his place to speak of ancient history. Allow me to explain it to Your Highness..."

He sighed. "The Qi Emperor, Qiji Tanluo, had the court name Shi Chang. He was born in Mobei and served as a general under the Wei. He was a skilled horseman and archer, fierce and adept in battle. When our clan's ancestor pacified Mobei, Lord Shi's contributions were outstanding, and he was enfeoffed as the General of the Pacified North... for a time, he was stationed to guard Hetao."

"At that time, the Helian family... was just a small Xiongnu tribe. It was because he promoted the Helian ancestor, Helian Bo, while guarding Hetao that the later Tiefu royal clan came to be."

Cui Changfu glanced at Li Zhouwei's expression, hesitating for a long moment before continuing. "Back then... an ancestor of my clan served in the same encampment as him. He appeared exceedingly obedient and humble. Because the commanding general was also named Cui, he deliberately tried to curry favor with my ancestor. Whenever a carriage departed, he would hold the whip and attend to it. Sometimes, when addressing my ancestor... he would even call himself a slave..."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, surprised. "And which ancestor was this?"

Cui Changfu looked slightly embarrassed, but his expression was also one of nostalgic realization at how things change. "He was of no renown... never even broke through to the divine ability realm... The man who once held the whip and called himself a slave became an emperor. It truly shows how unpredictable the world can be!"

Li Zhouwei was silent.

Cui Changfu quickly continued, "Because of this connection, my clan knows a few things... At that time... a young man often visited his tent. His cultivation was not high, merely Foundation Establishment Realm, but he had a refined and elegant bearing. He was known as Daoist Shanqing."

"Later, when the Qi founded their empire, he became the nation's Grand Preceptor. His cultivation reached the very pinnacle of the divine ability realm. He vanished when the Great Qi collapsed and was never seen again..."

"Daoist Shanqing..."

Li Zhouwei mulled this over as Cui Changfu continued, "Indeed... That man's methods were terrifying!"

A look of hatred crossed the old man's face. "The old empire's supervision of its prefectures was extremely strict. Not only were powers divided, but there were also immortal masters from the Immortal Estates assigned to oversee the regions. Although the Bright Yang lost its luster for a day and the officials and armies faltered, the large number of cultivators stationed throughout the land by the Immortal Estates quickly took command. They used their power to suppress the uprisings, and the situation was already beginning to stabilize..."

"But this Daoist Shanqing drove the common people like cattle, breaking through three mountain passes to open up Guanlong. He gathered the people of Wei, only for the Qi Emperor to have them buried alive. After breaching the palace, he rounded up the members of the Li clan and used spell arts to block out the Heavenly Light, allowing the Qi Emperor to humiliate the Bright Yang at his leisure... The imperial descendants died like livestock or were cooked in cauldrons, their tragic cries shaking the heavens."

"Even though he used spell arts to hide it, the Bright Yang is ultimately a Dao that manifests in the world. Whenever a great personage perished, the sky would inevitably brighten for three breaths—brightening and darkening, darkening and brightening, an uncountable number of times..."

Li Zhouwei listened intently, his cup frozen in mid-air. Suddenly, he asked, "What dao did this Grand Preceptor cultivate?"

Cui Changfu whispered, "Dui Metal!"

Cui Changfu [Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm]




# Chapter 1025: The Mountain's Might

'Shanqing… Shanqing…'

A subtle change flickered across Li Zhouwei’s expression. He watched the old man before him, who stood with his head bowed in silence, and pressed further.

"Did he really just vanish? A figure like that, whose divine abilities were already perfected… how could he disappear so suddenly? If he had achieved a new Fruition Attainment, the heavens and earth would have shifted. The entire world would have known."

His words carried a probing edge. Cui Changfu sat stunned for a moment before leaving his seat, closing the Celestial Hall doors, and then returning to the steps, his posture uncertain.

"Your Highness is correct," he answered, his voice fraught with hesitation. "The ancient records speak of the signs for the attainment of Dui Metal, and the conditions for failure: 'There should be an early autumn, the migration of armored soldiers, a gathering of merchants, and joy throughout the world.' But… if someone did succeed, who would be able to record it? To announce it to the world for all to see, to allow it to be written down… that would require the heart of a truly sincere venerable one. Such figures are few and far between…"

Even though the ancient texts recorded no such success, his words clearly implied that the Daoist Shanqing had indeed achieved his goal and retired from the world.

'Dui Metal!'

Li Zhouwei fell silent.

Dui Metal was no obscure Dao. The Golden Feather Sect, a renowned Immortal sect that controlled a vast territory in the Yue State, was the orthodox sect of what was known as the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. The True Monarch of the Golden Feather Sect who now walked the world had always been called the master of the Dui Metal Fruition Attainment!

'If that unfathomable Grand Preceptor truly achieved the Dao back then, and if not for the intercalary affair, he would almost certainly have been the one to claim the Dui Metal seat!'

He keenly grasped the old man's implication.

'True Monarch Taiyuan of the Golden Feather Sect… is also an enemy of Bright Yang… he cannot be trusted. If we were to revive Li Qianyuan, he would likely be the first to leap out and stop us!'

Whether this information was accurate remained to be seen; for now, it was only the Cui family's side of the story. Li Zhouwei sensed the old man was still hiding many secrets he dared not speak. His expression turned solemn as he, for the first time, asked with complete candor:

"I have one question. The Wei-Li… are they truly part of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition or not!"

Though a mountain of evidence in his heart already pointed to the answer, he needed to hear it stated plainly. The old man stared at him for a long moment before replying.

"The Wei-Li are to Encompassing Profoundity as the Great Ning Palace is to Encompassing Profoundity. If Your Highness must have an answer… then the answer is—yes!"

Li Zhouwei held his gaze, then suddenly shifted topics.

"I'm interested to hear… any ancient tales you know of Dui Metal."

Cui Changfu hastily shook his head. Though he knew exactly what Li Zhouwei was asking, he demurred.

"I dare not speak of Dui Metal, but this old one has heard some stories about Metal Virtue… Does Your Highness know of the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring?"

How could he not? When it came to familiarity with the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring, few in the mainland could compare to his own family. His own grandaunt had been transformed into a spirit by this very Dao, and to this day could not take a single step out of the Lie Sea!

He gave a slow nod. Cui Changfu's voice turned wistful.

"The Profound Thunder is based in the Northern Sea and is often called the Northern Palace Divine Thunder, but few know of the other three seas… In truth, to suppress demonic cultivators back then, the Thunder Palace established thunder Dao lineages in all four seas."

"But after the Thunder Palace was destroyed, the Profound Thunder lineage suffered a devastating blow. Most of its branches sought shelter under other Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Traditions. Among them, the Eastern Sea lineage was second only to the Northern Sea's. The first disciple of the Dams-Goat Temple Palace entered the sea to defend it and rebuild order, establishing the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring. When the Motongse Palace of the Milin Mountains Daoist Tradition emerged, they entered the Southern Sea, consolidated the thunder Dao there, and kept the name Motongse Palace… Only the Western Sea's thunder Dao was already weak; when the Northern Sea collapsed, it was annihilated the very same day, vanishing without a trace."

Cui Changfu paused, hesitating before continuing.

"And behind this Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring, there was also a great figure… His venerable title was Xu Fang of the Heavenly Thunder's Cry. He was the last venerable one to ascend the Thunder Throne, tasked with defending the Eastern Sea. He acted with great discretion and lived until the era when the Supreme Yang powers contended for their thrones…"

"It was his protection that preserved the last fragment of the Profound Thunder Daoist Tradition."

Li Zhouwei listened intently. Cui Changfu’s tone suddenly dropped.

"But when the Great Liang fell, the world descended into chaos. The Fuqi clan rose in the north, and the era of Cultivation Transcendence began… The Liang fell and the Zhao rose, and the world was pacified. But that venerable one suddenly vanished without a trace. The Thundercloud Temple, the foundation of the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring—then known as Thundercloud Divine Island—sank into the sea and was never seen again."

"In the same year, the Motongse Palace ascended in broad daylight. Eighteen islands rose from the Southern Sea, and the era of the thunder Dao's twilight finally came to an end."

Cui Changfu looked up at Li Zhouwei.

"From that moment on, the power of Dui Metal began to extinguish the remnant thunder."

'So… that's when the remnant lightning fell to the Metal virtue…'

Understanding dawned in Li Zhouwei’s mind.

'It was most likely the True Monarch of Dui Metal who made these moves… He orchestrated the rise and fall of the Qi Emperor, and he was the one who eradicated the remnant lightning.'

He recalled when Zhang Duanyan had come to the Li family to deliver the immortal decree. She had clearly and explicitly referred to Luoxia as their Upper Sect, confirming the subordinate relationship between Luoxia and the Golden Feather Sect. And since that Daoist Master Zhang was a Comprehending Profoundity figure, the matter became crystal clear.

'The reason the Daoist Shanqing was able to drive the common people like cattle was likely because he was backed by the Dao of Sheji, which opposed the Thunder Palace. Whether it was an alliance or a transaction, he probably borrowed the power of Sheji during that great upheaval, and eradicating the remnant lightning was his repayment…'

'But if that's the case, why has the Dao of Sheji never been seen?'

He pondered this for a long time before asking, "Did the Motongse Palace have any descendants? Ascending in broad daylight sounds like a sign that one's ascension has blessed all those connected to them, not like a tragic end."

Seeing his questions delve deeper, Cui Changfu grew increasingly anxious. Fortunately, this place was under the jurisdiction of the Dragon-kin, who already had poor relations with the Thunder Palace and Luoxia, so the topic was permissible. Not daring to refuse an answer, he gritted his teeth and spoke.

"The master of the Motongse Palace… was an incredible figure. He was once the premier Dao Child of the Southern Township Daoist Tradition. At the time, the Four Southern Secrets had already declined, and he was hailed as the immortal talent who would revive the Southern Township…"

"But once that Daoist Tradition reached the Southern Sea, it formally broke away from the Milin Daoist Tradition… It no longer revered Encompassing Profoundity, instead achieving the Dao through paths like Profound Qi, Upper Shaman, and Body of Kui… It was a mix of Immortal and Buddhist paths, calling itself the Motong Daoist Tradition."

"A mix of Immortal and Buddhist paths again?" Li Zhouwei asked with a frown.

This wasn't the first time he had heard of this. Legend had it that the master of the Dams-Goat Temple Palace had fallen due to combining Immortal and Buddhist ways. The Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring was based in the Thundercloud Temple, and now the Motongse Palace had also mixed the two. For this to happen repeatedly suggested a reason far from simple.

At Li Zhouwei’s question, Cui Changfu's expression dimmed.

"It's… difficult to say. The roots of this go back to more ancient times, for reasons unknown. But at the very least, two of the three most famous Daoist Traditions of Encompassing Profoundity have unclear ties to Buddhist cultivators. Only the Northern Palace thunder Dao has maintained a clearer boundary."

Cui Changfu sighed in sorrow.

"To us of the later generations, it seems like no good thing. It was bad enough that Su Xikong attained the Radiant Qi, but the Body of Kui, which also belonged to the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition, was passed down again and again until it finally ended up in the hands of Buddhist cultivators…"

He paused, as if belatedly realizing something.

"Does Your Highness know of the Body of Kui? Very few Daoist Traditions in the world know of it today…"

Li Zhouwei, of course, knew of this dao lineage of the Zhao Emperor. He nodded for him to continue. Cui Changfu immediately apologized and went on.

"The Motongse Palace did leave a legacy… Over half of the major Daoist Traditions in the Southern Sea inherited something from them… such as the Southern Songzhou Luoshe and the Great Konghai Temple… The Southern Sea Daoist Traditions forming their own distinct system originates from this."

These were familiar names. Li Zhouwei's heart steadied as he listened to Cui Changfu continue through gritted teeth.

"There are things I didn't dare say in the past, but it matters little now. To speak frankly… my family also has a long history. Your Highness… have you heard of the Miao Family of Thunder-Hearing Island? They have an ancestor named Miao Dushan, rumored to be a genius who combined the thunder Dao with the demonic Dao."

Li Zhouwei’s eyes narrowed. Cui Changfu sneered.

"I've heard rumors that this Miao Dushan is not so impressive. The world is full of geniuses, but none are that talented! How could a young man possibly merge the thunder Dao with the utterly incompatible demonic Dao? If he truly possessed such Dao-Profundity, he'd be sitting on a Golden Core throne by now, and we'd all be addressing him as 'Your Excellency'. Why would he be repeatedly thwarted in the mainland?!"

"The word among our families is that he obtained some secret art that inspired him, and from it, he derived his own path. He has some genius, yes, but not enough to defy all logic."

Li Zhouwei's eyes narrowed further.

"You mean to say… he obtained a profound Daoist Tradition from the Motongse Palace, and not daring to reveal it, he used it as a foundation to write the arts of Thunder Island?"

Cui Changfu fell into a grim silence, a clear admission.

The story of the Motongse Palace and the scandal of Thunder-Hearing Island were unremarkable when considered separately. But linked together… the implication was extraordinary.

If Miao Dushan truly obtained an ancient inheritance and used it to create a method for demonic thunder cultivation, and if that inheritance came from the Motongse Palace… what did that mean? Inheritances are never passed down without reason. The Dao Child of Motongse Palace was clearly from an Encompassing Profoundity background, yet he broke ties with them, ascended in broad daylight, and became a True Monarch… It was likely all connected to this demonic thunder cultivation method!

A shock went through Li Zhouwei.

'It's likely that this former Dao Child… if not outright defecting to Comprehending Profoundity, at least betrayed the Thunder Palace. He used any means necessary to achieve the Dao, and in doing so, carved out a path completely contrary to the brilliant might of heavenly power… From then on, a path of demonic thunder cultivation existed. The Miao Family and Miao Dushan were simply following a road that had already been paved!'

Cui Changfu stood with his head bowed, but Li Zhouwei understood his meaning perfectly.

'This figure was likely aligned with Comprehending Profoundity, which means… the true power of Luoxia might extend from the mainland all the way to the Southern Sea… another Golden Core-level force to contend with…'

'The might of Comprehending Profoundity is truly terrifying… No wonder the Dragon-kin, despite their dominance, have never controlled the Southern Sea as openly as they do the Eastern Sea, their authority there existing in name only… No wonder the Dragon-kin, who treat noble clans like slaves and wield their divine abilities like weapons, are confined to the Eastern Sea!'

'The fear of the Cui clan… it all stems from this.'

He remained silent for a long time. Cui Changfu spoke in a low voice.

"As for what happened after that, my family's records are unclear. After all, with our Purple Mansion Realm cultivators falling one after another, we lost the qualifications to know of matters at a higher level."

Li Zhouwei nodded and took a sip of tea.

"The Cui clan has not had it easy over the years. I came here this time not to ask for spiritual items or resources. Firstly, I came to ask about this history. Secondly, I wish to exchange for your clan's cultivation arts."

Cui Changfu was clearly prepared for this. He nodded silently.

"Our clan's inheritance comes from the Wei-Li and the Dongli Sect. It was originally taken from the palace and the army. To return it to its rightful owner is only natural. It isn't ours to begin with, so we wouldn't dare ask for an exchange."

Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes swept over him. "You will not be shortchanged. Accept what is given."

"Furthermore," he added, a slight smile gracing his lips. His golden eyes seemed to glow, and the aura of his entire face shifted from fierce to majestic.

"If your family refuses any payment, you'll only worry about following in the footsteps of your predecessors."

No matter how respectful Cui Changfu appeared, he couldn't escape that fear. At Li Zhouwei's words, he was rendered speechless. He opened his mouth to speak but could form no reply.

Li Zhouwei was bound by the fate of Bright Yang, but his constant emphasis on the terror of Comprehending Profoundity revealed his own deep-seated fear of Luoxia. Li Zhouwei's words struck right at his vulnerability.

'If I truly give him my all, on the day he falls, when the powers on the mountain come to settle scores, will any Dragon King be there to protect my clan? Which great lord could possibly save us?'

'And taking a step back, even if the mountain doesn't settle scores, if he truly shakes the foundation of Bright Yang, won't the Dragon-kin settle scores themselves?!'

From Cui Changfu's perspective, Li Zhouwei's offer was a lifeline. He felt an impulse to refuse, but the words wouldn't come. He could only turn his head and call out in a pained voice, "Jueyin, go and bring everything for His Highness."

Cui Changfu's choice of messenger was brilliant. Cui Jueyin was practically a member of the Li family. By not giving any prior instructions and simply sending him, he was signaling that he would bring out everything the clan possessed, proving that nothing was held back.

Cui Jueyin, who had listened to the entire exchange with a calm expression, retreated from the hall. Cui Changfu then rose, bowed deeply, and said in a choked voice, "Thank you… Your Highness!"

"Sit down. No need for all the bowing."

Li Zhouwei waved a hand, his gaze fixed on him.

"I have never blamed your Cui family. Situated in Chongzhou, with the fate of a million clansmen on your shoulders, decisions are not made by one person alone. As for Daoist Master Yangya… I have met him in the Grotto-Heaven. You have now achieved your own success, and Chongzhou has its own master. You no longer need to be constrained by him."

"Your Highness!"

Cui Changfu didn't know how to respond. Fortunately, Cui Jueyin returned quickly. He bowed before the steps and presented three gleaming jade slips and a stone talisman.

Cui Changfu hurriedly turned, holding one sleeve with one hand while presenting the items with the other in a gesture of extreme humility.

"This is the Audience Jade Talisman, the key to my Chongzhou Cui clan's inheritance. It records the Upper Mansion Audience Scripture, the treasured foundation of our family. It is a high fifth-grade art, containing three secret methods… for achieving Audience with the Celestial Gate! It was passed down from the Immortal Mansion of old."

"Because of this, the talisman is of exceptionally high quality, crafted from the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual material known as Flawless Body Jade. It's a top-tier Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, incorruptible and indestructible, with its divine light concealed within. Should our clan ever face annihilation, a junior could carry it out without attracting notice for possessing a great treasure, thus preventing its loss…"

Li Zhouwei glanced at it but was skeptical of its stated purpose. He shook his head.

"Your family's understanding of this inheritance is flawed… This isn't an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact. It's a degenerated spirit embryo. Now that you have attained a divine ability, it would be best if you had a secret method to refine it. If not, you could spend thirty to fifty years refining it, and it could serve as a protective Dharma Treasure."

Cui Changfu was stunned. He never imagined his family's heirloom had such a function. Overjoyed, he thanked him profusely, took the item in his hands, and said respectfully, "I wish to offer this item to Your Highness!"

Li Zhouwei simply shook his head. If Li Ximing didn't have Sichuan, this item might have been suitable for his family, but now it was redundant. He pushed it back and simply read the Upper Mansion Audience Scripture.

'It is indeed Audience with the Celestial Gate, but different from my family's version… It lacks some of the imperial majesty and the killing intent of a border pass that the Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art possesses. It has more of the ethereal style of the Immortal Dao, suited for cultivation in an Immortal Mansion…'

'As for these secret methods…'

Li Zhouwei frowned as he read, but a hint of satisfaction grew in his heart.

'Regardless, it's three secret methods. I can leave them in the family for the younger cultivators to study. It will be a fine addition.'

This could be used by the younger generation for reference. In the future, descendants with a suitable disposition would be better served by cultivating this art. Li Zhouwei casually tossed the jade talisman back into his hands. Cui Changfu immediately pointed to another jade slip.

"This one is the fourth-grade Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass."

Cui Jueyin immediately raised an eyebrow. "Daoist Master Zhaojing has already taken a copy of this in exchange for a favor to our clan!"

Cui Changfu paused, then nodded and moved his hand. "The remaining two… one is the Bright Origin Contemplating Fire Scripture, left by Daoist Master Yangya the last time he returned to the island. He traded for it from another cultivator. Its origin is the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven… However… it is of the Eternal Brightness Steps path, not the Imperial Observation of the Origin."

Li Zhouwei calmly took it and glanced through it.

'What a coincidence. My family has a copy as well, though only the Foundation Establishment Realm portion. It was a gift from the Profound Peak Gate back in the day… and it came from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven.'

He raised an eyebrow.

"It seems Yangya didn't take from you for free. He left something behind after all… Looks like he didn't want to be too indebted to you!"

"Yes… yes…"

The words were blunt but accurate. Cui Changfu looked embarrassed. He glanced at Li Zhouwei's face and continued his introduction.

"The various paths of Bright Yang, whether high-grade or low, all share the same root. The only differences are in their divine abilities and the strength of their dharma power. But the Imperial Observation of the Origin is unique. The Eternal Brightness Steps path was derived by many past sages from the 'Memorial on the Completion of Rites at Mount Taishi in the Northern Lands', personally written by High Radiance True Monarch. Their foundations are fundamentally different."

Li Zhouwei was very familiar with this concept. The 'Courtyard Guard' art he had first obtained was the same. It seemed to be from the same source, but in reality, it was worlds apart, even possessing the ability to command its lesser counterparts.

'I see. It's possible the 'Courtyard Guard' was also derived from some dharma text written by the original master of Jade True…'

Cui Changfu took a step forward.

"This last one is a secret art of our family, called the Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence. It is an art from the Immortal Mansions, left behind by a senior who once piloted a Treasure Ship. It was a technique he was borrowing to study. When trouble arose in his state, he rushed back, but fearing the art would be lost, he left it with our ancestor…"

Li Zhouwei's interest was finally piqued. He took the item and read it carefully.

"Hmm?" he murmured.

"The Art of the Sleeve Residence?"

"Precisely!" Cui Changfu’s face showed a hint of envy.

"This is an ancient cultivation method, a divine path practiced by those who follow the way of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature. One can cultivate a residence within one's sleeve to store treasures, eliminating the need for a storage pouch. With advanced cultivation, one can even draw living creatures into the sleeve with a flick of the wrist."

"The art even describes that if one reaches the level of its creator, a flick of the sleeve could collect an opponent's spell arts, dharma light, or even spiritual fire and water!"

Li Zhouwei began to read, impressed. He read for more than ten breaths, but still couldn't see the end.

'It's just like those other arts for ingesting qi… astonishingly difficult. I fear an ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator couldn't even read it through, let alone master it… Even a Great Daoist Master would struggle!'

'But its value is immense. It's in the same category as the Great Void-walking technique of those northern Grotto-Heaven cultivators—something you can only hope to encounter by chance, priceless and unobtainable!'

However, possessing Talisman Qi, Li Zhouwei was not intimidated by the difficulty. He spent some time memorizing it before nodding.

"I won't take advantage of you just because you've newly reached the Purple Mansion Realm. This is a rare and valuable item."

Cui Changfu quickly replied, "Your Highness is mistaken. Even if this item remained in my family for one or two hundred years, not a single person would be able to even begin learning it. We have had so many Purple Mansion Realm ancestors, yet none have succeeded! Since we cannot use it, it can't be considered a valuable item!"

"Your point is valid, but that doesn't erase its intrinsic value," Li Zhouwei said, shaking his head.

"Back when my family had just produced a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, my grand-uncle was also in a tight spot and owed a favor. I assume your family can't and dares not use this anyway, so I won't hold you to it."

With a flick of his wrist, he produced a jade box from his sleeve and placed it in Cui Changfu's hands, gesturing for him to open it.

Cui Changfu hesitated before opening the box. A wave of Bright Yang Qi rushed out. On a soft, white brocade cushion rested three wondrous spirit pills covered in shimmering scales, their brilliant light dazzling his eyes.

'Purple Mansion Realm spirit pills! Purple Mansion Realm spirit pills of the Bright Yang Dao!'

Cui Changfu had no idea of their true value, but Li Ximing's alchemy was superb. The wondrous fluctuations emanating from them made him covetous. A mix of shock and joy filled his heart, and he quickly said in alarm, "I absolutely cannot accept this!"

"Say no more!" Li Zhouwei waved his hand and produced another jade box, his expression serious. "My grand-uncle's favor is worth far more than three spirit pills. I have only one condition: one of these three pills must be given to Jueyin to help him break through to the Purple Mansion Realm."

Cui Changfu's expression turned solemn. He raised his hands in a salute and said earnestly, "To be honest, Jueyin is the one in our family with the greatest hope of breaking through. Even if Your Highness hadn't mentioned it, I would have certainly reserved two of these three pills for the younger generation, and one of them would have been for Jueyin!"

Li Zhouwei nodded and passed the box over.

"There is also a cultivation art here, the Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra. It's a fifth-grade Geng Metal art. Gathering the required qi might be a bit troublesome for you—you'll need to find famous mountains or gold mines… but it's one of the simplest to practice. You should be able to find what you need on some of the larger islands… Cultivating an art from another Dao will give you more options."

Li Zhouwei had many Purple Mansion Realm cultivation arts, but they were either inconvenient to share, having been traded from others, or the qi was too difficult to gather even for the Li family. Only this one had been obtained from another source, was easy to cultivate, and was already known to several parties, so its secrets were few. It was perfect for him.

An easily cultivated Purple Mansion Realm art was enough to be the foundational treasure of an entire sect! Moreover, it was high-grade and could fill a gap in the family's arts. Cui Changfu was stunned, then overcome with ecstatic joy. He couldn't help but reach out and take it, clutching it like a priceless treasure. But Li Zhouwei wasn't finished. He produced a jade talisman shimmering with immortal light.

"This is the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman, a Spiritual Artifact of the Capital Guard! It's best used with a famous river or a large island, which makes it suitable for you here in Chongzhou. This is in exchange for your Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence and the Bright Origin Contemplating Fire Scripture."

As he spoke, profound patterns on the talisman lit up in response, casting a brilliant radiance across the old man's face.

'A Spiritual Artifact?!'

'This is a Spiritual Artifact!'

Chongzhou was not without Spiritual Artifacts, but theirs had been lost with the Treasure Ship in the mainland. Only a mediocre protective treasure had remained, and that too was lost during the destruction of the Dongli Sect… They hadn't seen such a treasure in years! With this in hand, once he refined the spirit embryo and consumed the spirit pills, he could immediately secure his footing in the early stage of the Purple Mansion Realm!

'His Highness is so magnanimous! This is the bearing of an imperial scion!'

Cui Changfu was already dazed by the string of treasures. He clutched the cultivation art like a holy relic, but his eyes were glued to the Spiritual Artifact, his heart pounding. His lips trembled, unable to form words of refusal.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes, however, weren't on him. He was looking at Cui Jueyin with a faint smile, sighing inwardly.

'After this, Jueyin will surely command the greatest respect… His talent, intellect, and methods are all top-tier, and he serves under me often. He has a high chance of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm. When that day comes, this Spiritual Artifact will ultimately end up in his hands…'

His gaze lowered, and a private smile touched his lips.

'A fitting legacy to leave behind.'




# Chapter 1026: Nantanchen

Gardenia Scenery Mountain was perpetually covered in a sea of white blossoms. Whenever the wind rose, they would cascade from the mountainside like a waterfall, scattering across the surrounding forests and dotting the landscape with specks of white.

Li Suining arrived on the wind, his silver light flashing. A man in crimson armor stood waiting on the mountain, his dharma power exceptionally deep. His tiger-like eyes were bright and piercing, his presence majestic. It was Ding Weizeng.

"Senior Ding!"

He had clearly been waiting for some time. Seeing Li Suining, he nodded and spoke politely, "The young master has arrived. Please, follow me up the mountain."

Ding Weizeng was Daoist Master Zhaojing’s confidant and had always represented the Daoist Master’s will on the island. His politeness toward Li Suining wasn't born of familiarity, but rather from the fact that Daoist Master Zhaojing had personally promoted Li Suining, creating a sense of closeness.

Beside Ding Weizeng stood a long-bearded old man who appeared ancient. His cultivation was not low, but his features were somewhat shifty and weaselly. Upon seeing Li Suining, he hastily clasped his hands in greeting.

"Nanzhang Ku pays his respects to the young master!"

A strange feeling washed over Li Suining, but he maintained a courteous expression and returned the gesture. "Greetings, Guest Retainer."

This so-called Nanzhang Ku was, in truth, Situ Ku of the former Golden Tang Gate. After the Buddhist cultivators annihilated the Situ family, their bloodline and Dao lineage were carved up by the various powers. The branch that fell into the Li family’s hands was sent to the Eastern Yue territory and merged into what was now the Seven Lineages of Nanzhang. They had all adopted the Nanzhang surname, and he had long since ceased to be called Situ.

Li Suining had rarely heard of Nanzhang Ku. After all, the man had a disgraceful past and had only survived thanks to Ding Weizeng. He had always kept a low profile. In the previous life, Ding Weizeng had perished early—perhaps this man had also fallen in some forgotten battle.

Standing behind Situ Ku was a middle-aged man with sharp, rugged features. His clothes were ordinary, yet they couldn't conceal his keen aura. His eyes lit up when he saw Li Suining.

'Nantanchen!'

Understanding dawned on him in an instant. 'The Daoist Master came out of seclusion to meet with the younger generation. Nantanchen is a genius, and he’s already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm… and he’s an alchemist. It’s only natural he’d be summoned for an audience. So we’ve run into each other here!'

'No wonder Guest Retainer Ding came personally.'

The Nanzhang remnant lineage had finally produced its first Foundation Establishment cultivator after so many years. It was a momentous achievement, one the Daoist Master would surely want to witness. At this moment, Nantanchen had not yet been granted his new name and was still called Nanzhang Chen. Li Suining simply bowed to him with a smile.

"This senior has a truly impressive bearing."

Nanzhang Chen was a talent, but more importantly, he had been born at the right time. In the last life, neither Li Suining nor Pu Xinya had lacked talent, but they had both reached the Foundation Establishment Realm a step too late. Their impact on the grand course of history paled in comparison to figures like Nanzhang Chen and Jinguang.

This life would be different, but it was still essential to build connections with these key individuals. Though Nanzhang Chen's origins were less than savory, he had died a warrior's death in the end. The He family, who held such a high station at the time, hadn't they just surrendered in the end? Li Suining didn't hold grudges from his past life, but he couldn't help but feel a certain fondness for the man, and his smile was exceptionally warm.

This left Nanzhang Chen feeling overwhelmed. Although he was at the Foundation Establishment Realm, his background made him an outcast in the lake region, unloved and uncared for. The only person he could rely on was Nanzhang Ku, whose own problems were even more troublesome. He had heard that a genius from the main lineage would be ascending the mountain with him and had braced himself for arrogance. This reception was a complete surprise, and he waved his hands in dismissal.

"You praise me too highly, my lord."

Ding Weizeng watched them with a smile. Nanzhang Ku remained at the foot of the mountain as the other three began their ascent.

The mountain path was an ocean of white blossoms piled high on the bright jade steps. Li Suining was composed, but Nanzhang Chen grew visibly tense, his jaw clenched tight. He kept his head bowed the entire way, not daring to look up.

He knelt rigidly before the steps of the summit and called out, "This junior cultivator pays his respects to the Daoist Master!"

The mountaintop was devoid of luxury. A simple table held only a tall white jade teacup and a long-necked white porcelain vase with a glazed pattern, their elegant simplicity complementing each other perfectly.

The Daoist Master was engrossed in a jade slip. He raised the cup, took a sip, and set it aside.

Within the cup, a multicolored light shimmered. A clear, brownish-yellow aura undulated within, surging toward the heavens before converging back into the small porcelain vessel, as if drawing all the colors of the mountain peak into itself. Faint, majestic sounds of chanting scriptures echoed in the air.

With a soft _clink_, the Daoist Master placed the lid on the cup, and all the phenomena vanished, leaving only the tranquil Heavenly Light flowing across the mountain.

This item was none other than the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual extract, Radiant Spirit-Vessel's Glow. Consuming it could aid in the practice of spell arts!

With the Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise in his possession, Li Ximing naturally knew how to use it. One had to maintain the luminance of either the Supreme Yang or the Supreme Yin, ensure a stable spiritual atmosphere, and then brew the extract with a pot of gentle Valley Water, sipping it slowly as it steeped.

The Radiant Spirit-Vessel's Glow was no larger than a quail's egg when dropped into the cup. As the spiritual water was poured in, it began to tumble gently. Li Ximing had steeped it with three pots over half a month, and the extract had only shrunk by a tiny fraction.

Yet in that short time, his practice of spell arts had been a whirlwind of inspiration. Activating and applying his techniques felt more effortless than ever. His Tread on Flames technique, which had been stagnant for years, was now showing signs of loosening, as if a breakthrough was imminent.

'Of course, I specifically set aside time to rest, but the effect of this item cannot be understated… It’s about three to five times my normal cultivation speed. For techniques like Tread on Flames, which is already boosted by the Valley Wind Guide-Fire, the result is terrifying—it can reach nearly ten times the normal speed!'

'What a treasure. It seems it will last for a year, maybe a year and a half… I can use it slowly. On other days, I just need to maintain it with Valley Water.'

If he spent that year and a half entirely on Tread on Flames, it would be equivalent to ten full years of dedicated practice—more than enough to use the technique with ease and hold his own in most fights.

He was in a good mood. After slowly absorbing the last wisp of the Radiant Spirit-Vessel's Glow from his Shengyang Acupoint, he set down the jade slip and finally turned his attention to the three visitors.

"Suining, you've reached Qi Refining!"

Li Ximing nodded with a smile, raising an eyebrow to silence Li Suining’s impending words of gratitude. He then looked to Ding Weizeng.

"Is this the genius from the Nanzhang lineage?"

Ding Weizeng quickly nodded and replied respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, yes!"

He gestured and began the introduction. "He was raised solely by his mother and took her surname, Nanzhang. His mother's family has been close with the Ye clan for generations, so they are quite intimate. It is a rare blessing that they produced a genius such as him."

The Nanzhang bloodline was mixed, containing not only a large portion of Eastern Yue blood but also descendants of old lake clans, numerous outer branches of the former Yu family, and finally, the Situ family. Over the years, the Li clan had intentionally diluted the bloodlines, disrupted ancestral ties, and sent many distant relatives bearing the Ye surname to intermarry. The bloodline was actually quite good now, with no clear lines of patriarchal descent to trace. But the perception of others was not so easily erased. The stigma of being a "remnant clan" was still an unpleasant label.

Li Ximing glanced at the young man with interest. "And he can perform alchemy?"

"Yes!" Nanzhang Chen quickly kowtowed and answered.

Li Ximing gave him another look. "Rare."

There were quite a few people in the lake region who could perform alchemy; even the Li family's direct line had produced one later on. The rarity was not in his ability to practice alchemy, but in possessing alchemical talent without sacrificing cultivation talent. The handful of other Alchemists on the lake were all stuck at either the Embyronic Breathing or Qi Refining realms, making them largely useless.

Li Suining knelt silently to the side, feeling no surprise.

In his previous life, Nantanchen had been the one to take charge of all alchemy in the lake region. Though he failed to gain the trust of King Wei, he received several Classics from Daoist Master Zhaojing. While not an official disciple, he held a status akin to one. His talent was beyond doubt.

Just as expected, Li Ximing's interest was piqued. He began to test him. "What pills have you refined?"

Nanzhang Chen raised his head slightly, his voice steady. "I attempted a trial in the lake region a few days ago. Lord Ding gave me the formula for the Three Perfection Breakthrough Pill. This humble one was incompetent and only produced a single pill from one furnace."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow and looked at Ding Weizeng. The Dharma Protector clasped his hands, presented a jade bottle in his palm, and answered, "I was watching at his side. It was his first time refining it."

Li Ximing didn't take the bottle. A sweep of his spiritual sense was enough. The joy in his heart solidified, and he sighed inwardly. 'Rare indeed! Although he can't compare to me in my youth, this is still first-rate talent!'

Li Ximing possessed Talisman Qi, which allowed him to ignore all difficulties related to fire control, making alchemy far easier for him. The benefits had compounded all the way to the Purple Mansion Realm, becoming more significant with each major realm. It was this ability that had allowed him to single-handedly supply the entire Li family back then, and it was why he could still refine pills with ease as a Purple Mansion cultivator, achieving what others could not.

Nanzhang Chen had no Talisman Qi, yet he had managed to produce a pill on his very first attempt with the advanced Three Perfection Breakthrough Pill. Although the result was just one pill, it was a testament to his exceptional talent. Li Ximing smiled. "Who is his father?"

Nanzhang Chen looked slightly embarrassed. Ding Weizeng spoke up. "He is said to be… from Eastern Yue… the seed left behind by a certain profligate son of the Tian family in Eastern Mountain Yue…"

"Oh?"

The Tian family had been active in Eastern Yue for many years, so such an occurrence wasn't surprising. Li Ximing sat up straighter, his gaze sharp. "Said to be?"

That single phrase sent a shiver down Nanzhang Chen's spine, causing him to bow lower. Even Li Suining felt a tremor of fear. Fortunately, Ding Weizeng immediately responded in a low voice. "This subordinate investigated personally. The matter is true; his father did indeed come from the Tian family. However… I privately asked the Tian Family Head… he refuses to acknowledge him."

Nanzhang Chen was, after all, a Foundation Establishment cultivator. While the Tian family currently lacked a pillar of support, they certainly didn't want one appearing out of thin air to usurp their position. Li Ximing chuckled. "Then let him stay in Nanzhang. There's no need to go back. It's excellent to establish one's own surname. If a few more people like you emerge, Nanzhang's future will be bright indeed. The many surnames of Nanzhang have achieved a profound unity; I will permit you to establish a new surname for yourself."

Nantanchen had waited and waited. Though he hadn't hoped to return to the Tian family, he had feared being classified as a member of the Eastern Yue. He prostrated himself in thanks. Li Ximing casually tossed an alchemy book into his hands and instructed, "Master all the formulas in here. In the future, the responsibility for the lake region’s pills… may very well fall upon your shoulders!"

Overjoyed, Nantanchen took his leave. Li Ximing's tone softened considerably as he turned to Li Suining. "How is your progress with your cultivation technique? You have also read Daoist Master Yuanbian's formation scrolls. What are your thoughts?"

Li Suining answered respectfully, "The Daoist Master's learning is as vast as heaven and earth. This junior can only burn the midnight oil and strive to advance! As for the cultivation technique… its profoundness is beyond my imagination. My cultivation speed… I believe it to be quite slow."

"Although the technique is difficult, you must practice it diligently." Li Ximing rubbed his temples and shook his head with a wry smile. What Li Suining had received was the Qi Refining chapter of the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence; of course its profundity was beyond imagination. He continued casually, "I will be using a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource for my cultivation. It has the effect of aiding spell arts, and when I use it, its efficacy will permeate the mountain, leaving behind some of its mystical properties. You and your brothers… and your elders should all come here to cultivate for a time."

"But the main reason I summoned you concerns the Dao of formations. Daoist Master Yuanbian is bound by certain karmic ties and cannot accept you as a disciple, but studying in his manor is permissible. However, it would require you to leave the lake region and travel to the Eastern Sea."

"The timing isn't right at present. Wait until I have finished with this spiritual item. Let all of you share in its benefits. In a year or so, you can depart."

The words were spoken calmly, but they struck Li Suining like a thunderbolt, leaving his mind blank. 'Go to the Eastern Sea? If I go to the Eastern Sea, how can I monitor the situation of the world? How can I give my secret warnings?!'

A dreadful realization seized him. 'I absolutely cannot go to the Eastern Sea!'

But the Daoist Master’s words, while framed as a reward, were a command. How could he refuse? His mind raced. He immediately dropped to his knees, his voice filled with shame. "The Daoist Master has shown such consideration for this junior, and I am deeply humbled. However… in cultivating my technique this year, I have become keenly aware of my own lack of talent… far inferior to my uncles. Whether it is cultivation or the Dao of formations, if I am to repay the clan… I must first reach the Foundation Establishment Realm."

He lowered his head, his voice cracking. "This opportunity to study was obtained through a debt the Daoist Master owes… This junior does not wish to be half-hearted, waste the chance, and bring shame upon the Daoist Master’s name. I only hope to first achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm here on the lake before considering matters overseas!"

Li Ximing studied him for a long moment, then nodded slightly. 'That's fine too. The Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence is indeed too difficult. It has frightened the child.'

Thus, he said, "Your parents have passed away, and your ancestral line is thin. It is indeed not suitable for you to travel far. You should stay and produce an heir first… to give your parents a proper accounting! I will have the old master find a suitable match for you."

Out of the wolf's den and into the tiger's maw. This time, Li Suining could not refuse. Mortified, he could only grit his teeth and agree. Just then, Li Ximing's expression changed slightly. He looked up. "All of you, leave!"

He raised his sleeve, sweeping the two of them down to the foot of the mountain. A peal of laughter rang out from beyond the mountain's protective formation. 

"Daoist friend Zhaojing! I have come to offer my congratulations!"

Li Ximing didn't have time to reply. He quickly put away the Radiant Spirit-Vessel's Glow from the table and replaced it with ordinary tea. Only then did he call out with a smile, "So it is Daoist friend Sima who has graced me with his presence! Please, come in and we shall speak!"

He stepped out of the formation, only to see three figures standing in the Great Void.

The leader was a man in white robes with a sword at his waist—Sima Yuanli, without a doubt. He held a box in his hands, a smile on his face.

Standing some distance from him was a woman in a light cyan Daoist robe. Her features were gentle, her figure tall and slender. A smile touched her lips, and two strings of blue and white jadeite beads were tied at her waist, accentuating her narrow waistline. She offered a salute and said softly, "Daoist friend Zhaojing!"

"Daoist Master Kuang Yu, what a surprise."

Li Ximing’s surprise was genuine. He looked more closely and saw another person standing behind her.

This man did not look old. His hair was neatly tied in a topknot, his clothes were immaculate, and his expression was placid, giving him an air of great composure. He raised his hand in a formal greeting. "Greetings, Senior!"

Truthfully, this was the first time Li Ximing had been called "Senior" by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. He found it rather comical. Setting aside his confusion for the moment, he smiled. "And this is…?"

Kuang Yu pushed the man forward and said seriously, "This is Daoist Master Nanwu. His Daoist title is not often used these days. Our friends in the Eastern Sea all call him Daoist Master Guo. You may address him as such… we are all family here!"

"Oh?"

To be referred to by one's surname rather than a Daoist title usually implied a prestigious origin. The reputation of the Guo family of Crimson Reef Island was immense, and with Kuang Yu’s mention of the Eastern Sea, Li Ximing immediately became vigilant. He asked, half-convinced and half-skeptical, "The Guo family… Daoist friend, are you…?"

At his words, the newly met Daoist Master Nanwu shook his head repeatedly, a hint of disdain in his expression as he replied with a smile, "I would never dare to cultivate Merging Fire!"




# Chapter 1027: Nanwu

His reply was clever, subtly revealing his stance and drawing a laugh from the other three. Sima Yuanli simply pulled Li Ximing aside and sighed.

"Daoist Friend Guo is just spooked... He suffered quite a loss because of a Merging Fire in his youth. The whole affair gave him a massive headache, and now he turns pale at the mere mention of it!"

"Well, Guo Shentong's divine ability is quite famous, after all," Li Ximing replied with a smile.

Sima Yuanli lamented, "It wasn't just him. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's Merging Fire once brought disaster upon his family, taking many of their members. He eventually had to sell it for the spiritual resources he needed to break through. Only then did things slowly begin to improve for them..."

"It's good that he doesn't cultivate a Merging Fire! As long as he avoids it..."

Sima Yuanli tapped his temple playfully.

"There's a story there!"

Li Ximing chuckled, but then he was suddenly reminded that his own most powerful art, the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire, was also a type of Merging Fire. 'If it weren't for the Valley Wind Guide-Fire and the Talisman Seed, I'd be affected too,' he thought, and steered the conversation away from the awkward topic.

Kuang Yu, perhaps not well acquainted with Sima Yuanli, only offered a slight, tight-lipped smile. Li Ximing, however, nodded in deep agreement. "This way, please!" he said.

Playing the part of the host, he led the three up the mountain, stopping at the summit. Sima Yuanli then made the introductions.

"Daoist Friend Guo hails from the Eastern Sea. He is a rogue cultivator, though his ancestors were from a prestigious line—the renowned Yongzhou Guo Clan. They fled to the outer seas during the fall of the Great Liang, and their name faded into obscurity..."

Daoist Master Nanwu nodded slightly and took over, smiling. "Daoist Friend Qinghu, you flatter me. But when it comes to noble lineage, how could I possibly compare to a descendant of an emperor? To do so would only invite Senior Zhaojing's ridicule."

He let out a soft sigh. "Back then, my ancestor was gravely injured and dared not show his face, so he took refuge in the outer seas, where he met a swift end. The Spiritual Qi in the outer seas is thin, and within a century, my family had fallen into extreme decline, relying solely on the island formed from our ancestor's body to continue our cultivation..."

"Before he passed, he entrusted his treasures to a certain Daoist Master, asking him to look after our family. It was to prevent us from being destroyed for the very treasures we possessed. That Daoist Master cared for my family for a hundred years before perishing in a calamity, and we heard no more from him... Our family's fortunes declined even further, to the point where we could no longer even defend our island."

"If not for the old master from Mount Qusi passing through the outer seas a century ago and discovering me by chance... if he hadn't brought me away from the outer seas, and if I hadn't had a bit of luck myself, I would never have found the path I am on today!"

He sounded deeply moved, but Li Ximing understood the underlying message. This introduction first mentioned the Great Liang to establish his origins, then brought up Mount Qusi to hint at his network—the line of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the Southeastern Sea under Kuang Yu.

It also cleared up one of Li Ximing’s questions. For a family to be harmed by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's Merging Fire, the "many members" lost must have been in the Foundation Establishment Realm. The ancestor likely used the Merging Fire forcefully to save his clan from disaster. Such arts damaged one's nature and lifespan, so a tragic death would be a natural outcome.

Li Ximing lowered his hands and sighed. "It hasn't been easy..."

Kuang Yu nodded slightly. "The Guo family has endured much hardship these years... Returning from the outer seas, they urgently need vast spiritual resources and a Purple Mansion Realm formation to protect the clan... which aligns with your expectations, Daoist friend!"

"That's why, upon receiving news from Zhaojing, I immediately thought of Daoist Master Guo. I asked him in detail, and unexpectedly, he already knows Qinghu. On the way to Helin to inspect the formation, we came here directly."

Li Ximing nodded in understanding. Sima Yuanli wasted no time and retrieved an object from his sleeve.

It was a profound scroll, adorned with intricate, multicolored patterns and tied with a golden spiritual cord. Placing it before Li Ximing, he sighed.

"These past few days, the formation masters in my clan have been painstakingly piecing together the diagram for this formation. We also gained some clues from a few Changxiao formation cultivators. We've managed to restore about fifty or sixty percent of it."

Sima Yuanli's gesture was considerate, giving face to both sides. Li Ximing nodded with a smile as Sima Yuanli stroked his beard and continued,

"This is the Celestial Harmony Grand Spirit Formation, crafted by Changxiao. When he emerged from the grotto-heaven back then, he was laden with treasures and was never stingy in their use. The formation plate's foundation is made of 'White Ying Remote Gold,' with its patterns inscribed using 'Long He Bright Star.' It was refined from these two Purple Mansion Realm spiritual materials, along with various other resources. This formation plate alone is priceless and virtually unobtainable on the market!"

"Once established, this spiritual formation is somewhat lacking in defense and has few offensive capabilities. However, for assisting cultivation, gathering Spiritual Qi, nurturing life, and establishing a Dao lineage for passing down teachings, it is of the highest caliber—a treasure of the first rank!"

As his voice fell, he revealed an object in his palm and smiled. "This is the formation plate!"

The object was palm-sized, an octagon with eight corners, and gleamed a uniform, pale blue-white. Runes as fine as ox hair were inscribed upon its surface. Though it shone as bright and white as snow, it cast a shimmering golden hue as Sima Yuanli moved his hand.

"My family has a decent heritage, so we managed to retrieve this item safely with minimal damage. At most, some of its Spiritual Qi was depleted. Once a new grand formation is established, it can be nurtured for a year or two to fully recover!"

"The only issue... is that we obtained this by breaking the original formation. I am not well-versed in formations and have merely used a spell art to contain it. I'll need to find someone who understands formations, and I will go with them to install it."

Daoist Master Guo's eyes lit up at these words, and he nodded discreetly. Li Ximing calmly accepted the plate. A distinct coolness spread through his palm as it settled in his hand.

It was truly a treasure of the Purple Mansion Realm. The plate itself was small and exquisite, yet it radiated the multicolored light characteristic of a Purple Mansion-level divine ability. Once he looked at it, he couldn't tear his eyes away. Holding it, he was even more reluctant to let go. Even if he had no use for it himself, he wished he could keep it just to study its craftsmanship.

Beside him, Daoist Master Guo's gaze was even more fixed. Li Ximing smiled at him and asked, "Daoist Friend Guo... your cultivation path is..."

The man quickly looked up and said politely, "Senior, there is no need to be so formal. I am Guo Nanwu; please feel free to call me Nanwu... My Guo family cultivates the paths of Valley Water and Lesser Yang, supplemented by a Dao of Fire Virtue. I myself reached my current realm through the Lesser Yang Dao..."

"Now that is rare!"

Li Ximing realized this was the first time he'd met a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Lesser Yang Dao. But his reaction was swift; his surprise was quickly followed by suspicion.

'Lesser Yang... it's not entirely out of the blue. He said his family was from the Great Liang, which had the infamous Lesser Yang Demon Monarch. Combining that with his ancestor's story of fleeing into exile, it's highly likely his ancestor was a high-ranking minister of the Liang Emperor and a cultivator of the Lesser Yang Dao!'

And what did that imply? The Great Liang's Lesser Yang Dao lineage originated from the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect, colloquially known as the Viewing Pavilion faction! And who was in charge of the Viewing Pavilion faction today? Wei Xuanyin! And who did he work for? Luoxia!

This was the advantage of understanding the web of Daoist traditions. Even if the chance of him being from the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect was slim, Li Ximing immediately began to probe. He nodded. "That's not so unusual... the Lesser Yang Dao. Is it from the Viewing Pavilion's Daoist Tradition?"

As soon as he spoke, Sima Yuanli, who had been about to speak, closed his mouth and sipped his tea in silence. Guo Nanwu, however, just smiled. "We couldn't possibly claim a connection to the Viewing Pavilion's Daoist Tradition. In truth, Valley Water is my family's primary cultivation path. The Lesser Yang Dao was something an ancestor traded for... It's just that, unexpectedly, our efforts with Valley Water have repeatedly failed, while the Lesser Yang path has borne fruit."

His expression grew more wistful as he continued.

"I know you're referring to the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect... Back in the day, those cultivators were lofty and unreachable. But now... their orthodox lineage has been completely severed. They're nothing more than a group of lackeys running errands for the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao."

Li Ximing was slightly surprised, but Sima Yuanli coughed, signaling that the topic should be dropped. Li Ximing could only set down his cup and nod silently.

'That makes sense... For one, if his family had been from the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect, they wouldn't have been hunted down to their current state. And secondly... even if Wei Xuanyin wanted to stir up trouble, this isn't his style... He wouldn't need to involve himself in such a suspicious affair. He'd find a descendant of the Bright Yang lineage, or at the very least, someone with a cleaner background...'

Guo Nanwu seemed a bit awkward and quickly added, "Nanwu understands that this item is precious. I have brought a spiritual object in trade."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing looked up with interest. Guo Nanwu took a box from his robes, opened it, and revealed a flash of pure, bright color within.

He spoke softly, "Senior, please take a look!"

Li Ximing's spiritual sense swept over it. He perceived a brilliant golden qi surging and roiling within the box, suppressed by the divine ability sealing its surface. The concentrated color at the very bottom shone with a pure, clear light, marking it unmistakably as a spiritual object of Metal Virtue.

This made Li Ximing narrow his eyes. "Dui Metal?" he asked.

"Indeed!" Guo Nanwu's expression was solemn. "This item has no name, but it is a type of Metal Malice, a Dui Metal spiritual object. I had the old Daoist Master examine it, and he said it is more exalted than ordinary Purple Mansion spiritual materials!"

"Exalted?"

The choice of words struck Li Ximing as odd. He fell into contemplative silence. Sima Yuanli, however, frowned with a mix of belief and doubt.

"It looks like 'Long Yue Variable Gold'... yet it has an added hint of radiance..."

"Daoist Friend Qinghu has sharp eyes!" Guo Nanwu shook his head and sighed.

"Years ago, while my family was cultivating in the outer seas, the Great Void trembled. A golden star fell from the sky, its long rainbow tail sweeping past the moon as it neared the horizon. The phenomenon threw the landscape into chaos, cloaking everything in a dense mist. Although my ancestor was heavily injured, he had no choice but to reveal himself."

"He saw several points of golden light plunge into the sea. Being so close, he took advantage of the opportunity and secretly retrieved them. After repeated study, he also concluded that it was 'Long Yue Variable Gold'."

"Later, when the old Daoist Master Diyan came to our aid, I wished to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. I offered this spiritual object as thanks, hoping to trade it and a 'Miuwei Merging Fire' for a 'Three Sects Glory Yang Stone'. The old master accepted the Merging Fire, but he returned the 'Long Yue Variable Gold'."

Guo Nanwu's gaze was complex.

"The old master said it was 'A gift from the White Lightning, the metal of a bygone year,' and firmly refused to take it. He also instructed us not to let it come into contact with any other Dui Metal, lest it undergo a transformation... and so we have kept it safe to this day."

"After I achieved my divine ability, I visited the old master at his sect to ask about this matter, but he remained tight-lipped. When I asked about its special properties, he would only say that it possessed a trace of the Supreme Yang's might... I was always curious, but now, after searching through all my clan's possessions, this is the only thing worthy of offering!"

Li Ximing carefully appraised it, his own divine ability resonating with the object.

"It does indeed possess the might of the First Manifestation," he confirmed.

This gave Li Ximing something to consider. His own Emperor Qi's Light, which he was refining in a chamber within Juque Palace, required spiritual objects of Supreme Yang, Lightning, and Light Malice as its primary components. This item contained the power of Supreme Yang and was also a Metal Malice. If he obtained it and couldn't sell it right away, he could use it to cultivate the spell art. It should be of great use.

He wasn't thinking of using it for himself, but rather to enhance Li Zhouwei's spell arts. Otherwise, he would have been quite unwilling to trade for a Dui Metal item!

Guo Nanwu nodded repeatedly. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"This item is indeed precious. However, the Celestial Harmony Grand Spirit Formation plate uses 'White Ying Remote Gold' as its base and 'Long He Bright Star' for its patterns. Both are supreme Purple Mansion spiritual materials. This single piece of Dui Metal, I'm afraid, is not enough."

Guo Nanwu hesitated, opening his mouth as if to offer a cultivation technique. But it was an ancestral matter, and he hadn't discussed it with the clan on his island; he couldn't just offer it up. Kuang Yu, however, raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"That's not all. To construct the formation, you'll need a vast amount of spiritual resources, which you will inevitably have to source from the mainland. And techniques of the Upper Rite are exceptionally rare. Now that Daoist Friend Minghuang has conquered Changxiao, these things will not be easy to come by!"

Guo Nanwu clearly trusted her judgement. He considered her words and nodded. Kuang Yu spoke softly.

"How about this... I've calculated the time. The Guo family is small. Even working at full capacity, building this formation will take ten to twenty years. It's a long-term project..."

She turned to Li Ximing, her tone amicable.

"Why don't we let him take the Celestial Harmony Grand Spirit Formation first, so the Guo family can establish themselves on their island in the Southern Sea? Meanwhile, Daoist Friend Zhaojing here needs someone to help with matters in the outer seas. For a period of twenty to thirty years, the Li family can supply some basic spiritual materials, and in return, Nanwu can act on Moongaze's behalf in the Southern Sea. He can lend a hand with tasks that are within his means and unrelated to the conflict between the north and south. It would be a form of mutual support..."

Kuang Yu smiled. "And there's no need to worry. Once the grand formation is complete, if it turns out there was truly no trouble for Nanwu these thirty years, he can add one or two more spiritual resources for you, depending on the situation."

Her expression turned serious. "With myself and Mount Qusi mediating this, you have a guarantee! If things truly don't work out... he can only offer some cultivation techniques to compensate you..."

This proposal was completely unexpected, causing Li Ximing to turn his head in surprise as he considered it.

'She has a point...'

The matter with Qingyan was still unresolved, and Li Ximing still had contacts with several Demon Kings from Poluoduo. He could trade for pills and spiritual resources, but it was inconvenient to have junior cultivators transport such things back and forth. Unable to leave himself, he could only sit idly on his mountain...

Even his trade with the Southern Songzhou Luoshe and his meeting with the person on Yinzhou Island were things he should have handled personally. But with numerous threats looming and Moongaze Lake needing protection, he couldn't leave in a timely manner. He finally had Liu Changdie, but he had to be stationed at the Qunyi Archipelago! These tasks had piled up for so long that Li Zhouwei had been forced to act as an errand boy on his last trip out.

'If I had someone like him... on the surface, he'd only need to maintain a friendly relationship with my family, visiting occasionally or sending a letter. The most valuable and confidential items would be out of the question, but for handling these pills, spiritual resources, and other ordinary goods... he would be very useful...'

As for the one or two extra spiritual resources, Li Ximing didn't covet them at all. He understood that Kuang Yu genuinely hoped the cultivators of Yue State would grow closer to her faction. But what truly made his heart race was something else entirely!

Both Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan were already showing promise of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. When they did, another critical matter would arise—the Azure Talisman!

'When the time comes, if we can find a Demon beast in the outer seas with no significant background, we could pool our strength... it might be possible... and even if a Demon beast with no backing is hard to find, having another Purple Mansion Realm-level combatant is always a good thing!'

'The only pity is... the Southern Sea doesn't offer many benefits for my family... and it wouldn't be right to drag him into the conflict between north and south.'

He pondered for a long while, with no intention of asking for their family's cultivation techniques. He smiled.

"We can certainly establish a friendly relationship. Since we've agreed on thirty years, we will be friends from now on. There's no need to be so rigid about the terms, and I would feel embarrassed to accept more spiritual resources from you!"

"This..." Guo Nanwu was taken aback and felt a bit uneasy. He quickly bowed in return.

"Senior Zhaojing..."

Li Ximing shook his head, rising with a smile.

"There's no need for such formalities!"

He picked up the formation plate and placed it in Guo Nanwu's hands.

"Since it's decided, let's not keep Daoist Friend Qinghu waiting any longer. Please, make the trip at once!"

The formation plate felt cool to the touch, but Guo Nanwu held it as if it were a scorching treasure. He let out a long, deep sigh of relief. "Junior will remember this kindness!"

He raised his eyes to look at Kuang Yu but was slightly surprised to see she had moved to stand by Li Ximing's side. The woman smiled radiantly.

"Congratulations! Daoist Friend Zhaojing and I still have some minor matters to discuss... so I won't accompany you back. Fairy Ning is at Xinyu. You can go look for her directly!"

(End of Chapter)




# Chapter 1028: The Demon Lair

Guo Nanwu bowed and departed with Sima Yuanli, vanishing into the Great Void. Li Ximing, still a bit surprised, invited Kuang Yu to sit at the table. He poured her some tea and asked, "Daoist friend, what was that about?"

Kuang Yu shook her head with a faint smile.

"With the Daoist Master from the Sima Family present, there were things I couldn't say," she replied. "After all, he is close with the Dantai, and we have no real rapport. It's best to be cautious."

She accepted the tea with a graceful lift of her hand, smiling as if completely unconcerned about Li Ximing's own relationship with the Sima Family.

"He now calls himself a Sima, so he must bear the Sima Family's karma. Furthermore, old senior Yuanxiu has already built a network for him in the Southern and Eastern Seas. If the Yue State intends to exert influence over the two seas, both he and Daoist Master Zhusheng will be unavoidable. They… will have much to deal with then!"

"By then," Li Ximing mused aloud, "one will be called Daoist Master Sima, the other Protector-General Liu."

He wasn't surprised to hear the name of Daoist Master Zhusheng. He sighed, and Kuang Yu continued,

"I couldn't speak freely before, but I need to be clear with you about this. The Guo family did indeed leave during the end of the Liang, that's true. But the chaotic final years of the Liang dynasty lasted over three hundred years. The central plains fractured into one hundred and twenty-seven states, and the Guo clan was actually one of the feudal lords. Their state was called Yong."

"Feudal lords?"

Li Ximing paused, his expression growing complex. "I had heard that a thousand years ago, the Jie barbarians poured through the passes in the north, leading to an era of many rival states. I just never realized it lasted for three centuries…"

"A centipede with a hundred legs may die, but it won't topple over," Kuang Yu said softly. "The Great Liang was a colossus, after all. Its control over the north was lost after the Emperor of Liang drowned and the military governors rebelled, but its authority lingered. Each governor used the imperial name as their seal of legitimacy, clinging to a dying power. We call this era 'Liang's Fall and Zhao's Rise.' It began with military revolts that shattered the emperor's authority, followed by the Jie barbarian invasion which truly destroyed the Great Liang. Only then could the Zhao dynasty rise… and it all began the day the Emperor of Liang drowned."

A strange look crossed Li Ximing’s face. He had already heard about the emperor's drowning from Kongheng.

"The Great Liang modeled itself after the Great Wei. The Emperor of Liang, no matter what, would have been a high-level cultivator… Drowning? Does this imply… Water Virtue?"

A flicker of fear touched Kuang Yu's features.

"That is something beyond our knowledge. There was no radiance of Water Virtue to be seen. Instead, a comet blazed across the sky, marking the return of Cultivation Transcendence to its place. The Great Liang'sDepartment of Celestial Oversight collapsed—this was the very day the curtain rose on the chaotic end of the dynasty. It was also at this time that travel through the Great Void experienced a surge in speed, and formation plates became widespread…"

'Cultivation Transcendence returning to its place…'

Li Ximing lowered his gaze and sipped his tea, hiding his astonishment. A quick mental calculation told him that this True Monarch had held their position for over a thousand years.

Kuang Yu clearly dared not discuss True Monarch Taiyue further. She forced a smile and changed the subject.

"The king of Yong was named Guo Wusi. He was killed by Qi Wang, the ancestor of the Qi family. Their withdrawal from the mainland signaled the Guo family's complete exit from the stage of that chaotic era. You need not worry about his ties to the north. Don't trouble him with these matters; he has no thoughts of revenge. He wouldn't dare touch that past now!"

'True Monarch Taiyue… is deeply connected to the fall of the Great Liang,' Li Ximing thought.

'She dares to hint at True Monarch Taiyue, yet she avoids talking about the drowning and won't mention that Water Virtue… It's highly likely one of the three great families was involved.'

He nodded silently, lost in thought.

Looking up, he said, "I have one more question. Since that Daoist Master recognized the peculiarity of the Long Yue Variable Gold, would he be willing to share what he knows?"

Kuang Yu sighed. "There's no great secret to it. Nanwu asked about it when he achieved the Purple Mansion Realm. He simply dislikes the Sima Family, which is why he refused to speak. That was him being tactful, considering he wants to sever his family's past karma but also needs something from them."

The woman took a sip of tea. "This item has an aura of radiance and is a 'variable gold.' Naturally, it's inextricably linked to that Lord Taiyu from long ago!"

Li Ximing fell silent for a moment before asking, "To speak frankly, I have some understanding of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Things here… don’t add up. The Fruition Attainment of Dui Metal has only ever been a singular seat. I’ve never heard of splitting it into past and present eras. If it was divided, then why? For what purpose?"

Kuang Yu seemed anxious. After a long pause, she finally said,

"Let me put it this way, Daoist friend. The one who sits upon the golden mountain in the great desert is an evergreen tree of Metal Virtue, an insurmountable peak. Throughout history, there have certainly been figures more powerful than him, and he has met them all. But a figure like him, one who could reshape the world itself, is rare indeed…"

"Perhaps his path to becoming a Monarch may not compare to the Empty Attestation mighty ones of antiquity, but it surpasses more than sixty percent of all other True Monarchs. Even the Fruition Attainment was renamed because of him… which naturally created this distinction between past and present!"

She was piling on the praise, but the more she did, the more unsettled Li Ximing became.

'No matter how much she praises this person, the alteration to Dui Metal can't be erased. This isn't praise at all; every word is an accusation!'

A knot formed in Li Ximing’s stomach.

"I have heard of their prowess," he managed to say.

Kuang Yu shook her head, seemingly breathless. His expression clearly told her he didn't grasp the full story.

"This Long Yue Variable Gold is the 'past's gold.' The best way to handle it is to refine and polish it into a small mirror, which can be used to reflect light-based baleful qi. This is what the old Daoist Master said himself, and he spent his entire life forging artifacts. His advice is worth heeding."

"As for other uses…" Kuang Yu paused, a peculiar look on her face. "Giving it to the Golden Feather or the Sword Gate would both be viable options… but doing so would deeply offend the other party."

Li Ximing silently pressed his hand on the jade box, deep in thought. After a long while, he asked, "May I ask the name of the Fruition Attainment?"

Kuang Yu was quiet at first, but soon replied, "When I was studying the Dao at Hengzhu, I read an ancient book, the Five Lectures on Dui Metal. It contained some errors. It recorded the Dao of Dui Metal as 'the Dao of the White Lightning Dui Metal of Shen-You,' claiming it was the orthodox position of Shen-You metal."

"The orthodox position."

Li Ximing seemed dazed, murmuring to himself, "'The orthodox position of Shen-You metal… I was asked to wield the metal… the very Dui Metal of this orthodox position…'"

"Daoist friend Zhaojing?" Kuang Yu raised an eyebrow.

Li Ximing shook his head with a small laugh. "It just reminded me of a treasure from the Sima Family."

Kuang Yu nodded.

"Aside from Nanwu's affairs, I have some good news for you. A few years ago, you asked me to find Cold Cloud Heart-Iron. I have news. Daoist Master Xuanyi came across some by chance, and I've brought it for you."

She placed a silver iron box on the table. A layer of frost condensed on its surface, from which flowed a thick white mist. Within the mist lay a palm-sized piece of cold iron, pulsing with a soft white light.

Li Ximing’s eyes lit up.

"What would you like in return?"

The woman hesitated, looking at him for a moment before straightening her posture.

"I once heard that Daoist friend Xuanyi possessed a piece of Shangxiang Silver. My Dao requires it, and I hoped to trade for it… but the matter is… somewhat inappropriate."

"Shangxiang Silver has long since vanished, while spiritual resources of Cold Qi are still relatively common. I would be taking advantage of you."

Li Ximing smiled. "You've put so much thought into Queyi's cultivation methods, and I've seen how you've cared for her all these years. There is no need to be so formal!"

Li Queyi had been cultivating on her island, and the advanced technique she now practiced was thanks to Kuang Yu's efforts. Though she had never mentioned it, Li Ximing had kept it in his heart, unwilling to let himself owe her a favor. He took out the requested treasure and placed it in her hand.

"In fact," he said earnestly, "I feel this is still not enough."

"I am fond of the child," Kuang Yu said, smiling and shaking her head. "It wasn't to earn a favor from your family."

Li Ximing didn't seem convinced, but he let it pass. He escorted her out of the mountain, pressing the Cold Cloud Heart-Iron back into her hands.

"Then please have Nanwu make a trip to deliver this to Dingyang Zi," he said with a smile.

"And while he's there, have him ask for me… how is the progress on that suit of armor for my family?"

"Of course!" Kuang Yu bowed.

"When your esteemed family receives its good news, we will certainly come to offer our congratulations!"

Li Ximing knew she was referring to his enfeoffment as a king. He shook his head with a sigh and returned to the mountain, thinking to himself:

'I'll consolidate my immortal foundation for another year, then attempt to master World's Radiance.'

---

Hetian Sea, Yinzhou Island.

Yinzhou Island was vast, with rolling mountain ranges steeped in a grim, bloody aura. White bones littered the mountain paths, and Demon beasts were everywhere. It was a world apart, yet it was a frequent stop for those with divine abilities or wreathed in Buddhist light, who traversed the Great Void to land upon its shores.

The water at the island's edge shimmered blue and white. In the Great Void, lotus flowers bloomed, and a golden-robed monk materialized. The rippling light of the sea danced across his head.

His face was as placid as still water, his bearing extraordinary. With a flicker, he transformed into a black-haired Daoist with a long beard and landed in the mountains. Immediately, a green-scaled beast bounded over a peak, slammed the long spear in its hand into the ground, and demanded, "Are you Great Master Minghui?"

Minghui Maha's expression was calm.

"I have come at the invitation of Ping Yan," he said evenly.

"Please lead the way, Demon General."

The green-scaled beast gestured for him to follow.

"Hurry up. Don't keep the Great King waiting."

Anywhere else, upon encountering such a Demon beast, Maha Minghui would have certainly subjugated it as a mount. How could he allow it to speak to him in such a way? But this time was different. Not only did he feel no anger, he even quickened his pace.

'That devil Ping Yan, honestly! He didn't even give me a timely warning… Does he not realize it takes time for me to travel from the mainland?'

At the mountain's peak stood a pavilion. Two figures sat within: one old, one young. The old man had a sallow face and drooping eyebrows, his white beard drifting as he stroked it and spoke. The young man, clad in a long robe with gold-embroidered sleeves, nodded as he listened.

The moment Minghui stepped onto the summit, his eyes fell upon the young man, and he felt his vision burn. Looking closer, he saw a blazing aura of light surrounding the man, a sign that his destiny had reached its zenith. On his neck, scales faintly emerged, traced with white patterns. A chill ran down Minghui's spine.

'So this is the big shot.'

"Minghui of the Lotus Temple, greetings to you two Daoist friends!"

Li Zhouwei looked up at the sound, his gaze falling upon the Daoist. With a flash of his golden eyes, he saw through the disguise to the monk beneath. He heard Ping Yan chuckle.

"Please!"

The monk took his seat, first adjusting his sleeves.

"Daoist friend has achieved the Purple Mansion Realm," he said in congratulation.

"I heard the news even in the north. On behalf of Moongaze, I offer my felicitations!"

Li Zhouwei held no goodwill for Buddhist cultivators. If not for the fact that the Lotus Temple had always maintained close ties with immortal cultivators, and that Minghui was the only one who could handle the items in his possession, he would not be inclined to sit and talk with one. He merely replied,

"You're too kind."

As Li Zhouwei had journeyed across Yinzhou Island, a deep sense of wrongness had settled upon him.

This place, known to outsiders as a celestial mountain on a celestial island, was in reality overrun with rampant Demon beasts. The ground was littered with white bones, feasts were made of piled meat and rice, and pools were filled with crimson blood. A ceaseless stream of human resources from across the Hetian Sea was funneled to this island, allowing the mountain's inhabitants to feast to their hearts' content. Grinning and laughing, their bellies full of food and wine, they would depart the island to patrol the seas as ordered, already looking back with longing.

This scenery was hidden in the forests and tucked away in palaces, but he saw it all with perfect clarity.

'Whether it was Huiyao, a few other Demon beasts, or even the high-ranking figures of the Dragon-kin, they were surely sitting among them, feasting on flesh and drinking blood.'

The title "Dragon-kin's Shepherding of the Seas" was not just for show. Even a family like the Cuis had to obediently hand over spiritual items. They were high-level enough not to have to offer up their own kin for the demons to devour, but the Dragon-kin were not so courteous to the other cultivators of the Eastern Sea!

'Over the years… the white bones on Yinzhou Island could be piled into mountains, enough to pave the sea floor and form reefs.'

And the “Daoist” Ping Yan was no Daoist. Lowering his gaze, a single glance pierced him: beneath the skin-bag lay only bleached bone, reshaped into a skeletal frame. His robe concealed roiling demonic vapor and blood light.

The Daoist before him now was no Daoist at all, but a portly monk. The radiance of the Way of Joyful Bliss shone from his body, but the Way of Joyful Bliss was no righteous path. This mountain of Ping Yan's, this great island of the Dragon-kin—to call it a den of demons and devils would be no exaggeration at all.

'This is the true face of the Hornless Dragon lineage.'

His face remained a mask of cold indifference. Minghui, not at all awkward, smiled and took a seat to the side. Only then did Ping Yan speak, his voice deep and resonant, like that of a highly accomplished cultivator.

"Apologies for keeping you waiting, Great King!"

But in the reflection of Li Zhouwei's golden eyes, it was merely a skull opening and closing. Without a word, Li Zhouwei reached into his sleeve and produced a clattering cascade of golden artifacts—rings, kasayas, cups, lotus thrones—that piled up on the ground, radiating a brilliant light.

Minghui stood up in astonishment, his eyes scanning each item. But Ping Yan’s gaze was fixed on Li Zhouwei.

"Great King, your arrival from so far away was quite unexpected. My mountain is a humble place; I fear we have been poor hosts."

"It's of no concern," Li Zhouwei said, shaking his head.

Ping Yan’s eyes flickered. He could feel the surging aura of Bright Yang Qi, which made his demonic cultivation technique slightly uncomfortable. A dark color swirled in his pupils.

"Great King… I have heard… that you possess a treasure called the Pure Yang, a gift from the White Dragon Crown Prince. Is this true?"

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, his gaze suddenly turning sharp as a blade.

"Indeed. What business is it of yours, Daoist friend Ping Yan?"

"Hoh." Ping Yan lifted an eyebrow and smiled, the expression looking stiff on his sallow face.

"Some days ago," he said in a low voice, "there was a great banquet in the sea. A demon brought up this matter, challenging the Crown Prince and provoking the great anger of the Dragon King of Beihai Sea. Although I was not present, I received several instructions… A certain lord from the Black Dragon shrine… would also like to meet the Great King!"

Li Zhouwei’s gaze was probing, sweeping over Ping Yan's face as he tried to determine which Dragon King he served. But before he could answer, he heard the faint sound of soft footsteps.

Li Zhouwei's body relaxed further. Leaning against the table, he said casually,

"Be my guest."

But before the words had even left his mouth, a cold wind whipped through the pavilion, and a man in black was standing just outside it.

The man was tall, his face as if carved by a knife and axe—fierce and powerful. His expression was savage and cold. Two locks of black hair fell across his pristine forehead, fluttering gently in the wind. A long saber was tied at his waist, its scabbard made of white bone and adorned with jewels, rolling with a deep demonic qi.

The man bared his teeth in a cold smile. Bristles began to emerge from his neck, releasing a torrent of demonic qi into the air that formed a black, baleful wind swirling around his body.

"Guangfou, of the Black Dragon shrine."

Li Zhouwei raised his eyes to meet the man's gaze. The dragon eyes were brimming with churning demonic qi and killing intent, which instantly triggered a cold, wary smile in his heart.

'Good… He truly wants to kill me.'

Ping Yan was already bowing respectfully, having left his seat. Minghui was terrified, looking back and forth in a panic, sweat beading on his forehead. Only the golden-eyed young man remained standing calmly in the pavilion.

"Minghuang. Li Zhouwei." he said coldly.




# Chapter 1029: Who is the Bright Yang?

The pavilion fell silent. Maha Minghui shot to his feet, not daring to remain seated. He stood aside, his mind already a torrent of curses.

‘What is that fiend Ping Yan thinking, causing all this trouble! Everyone knows this man is a close friend of the White Dragon Crown Prince... and there's no love lost between the various branches of the Dragon-kin... Is Ping Yan trying to get himself killed!’

Ping Yan didn't belong to any particular branch on Yinzhou Island, but even if this stunt managed to please the Black Dragon Guangfou, how could Dingjiao possibly let him off easy? It was utterly foolish!

Though a storm of curses raged in Maha Minghui's heart, and a thousand hesitations plagued him, he kept his mouth shut and stood silently.

It wasn't for lack of courage. High as Maha Minghui's status was, he too dared not offend the Dragon-kin, especially here on Yinzhou Island. If a Dragon-kin slapped him to death, Jinlian would have no recourse—would Mount Dayang stand up for him? Impossible! They'd be more likely to applaud his demise and punish Jinlian for the trouble.

The monk, thoroughly intimidated, simply stood with his head bowed. Yet his heart was restless, and he could only mutter to himself.

‘It’s not that I dare not help, but my position is unclear. I fear I might ruin the lord's important affairs!’

As these thoughts raced through his mind, Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes slowly brightened. He felt the thick killing intent rolling off the Dragon Demon and his gaze turned icy. He watched quietly as the Dragon Demon stepped into the pavilion garden, stopping nearby.

Master Ping Yan, that fiend who had been in the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm for years, pressed his forehead to the ground, not daring to look up.

Though the Dragon Demon Guangfou had taken human form, his body was immense. His massive shadow fell over the garden, making the entire pavilion feel cramped and oppressive. The roiling demonic energy from his breath condensed, flowing past him on both sides like a current of water.

"Li Zhouwei..."

His voice was somewhat hoarse, his tone flat.

"So you are the immortal cultivator who has been usurping the White Qilin's name. Where are the Pure Yang Bracelets?"

The moment he spoke, a chill shot through Maha Minghui's heart.

‘He's... refusing to acknowledge the reality of the Bright Yang.’

This was an extremely dangerous signal!

The Dragon-kin had deep ties to the Wei-Li, a relationship once so intimate that the Dragon-kin's eldest princess, the Zhaohe Dragon Princess, entered the Wei palace to cultivate. The Dragon King Beihai himself had followed Dongfang into the palace, addressing Emperor Gong of Wei as an uncle.

No matter how desperately the Dragon-kin wanted to prevent Luoxia from shaking the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment, they couldn't afford to lose face by acting against a descendant of the White Qilin unless absolutely necessary! Yet, they couldn't just sit by and watch Li Zhouwei grow stronger. The only crude and direct way to eliminate him was simple—just refuse to acknowledge him as the White Qilin!

If Li Zhouwei had no connection to him, Maha Minghui would have been thrilled to see the situation escalate. But his heart was already pounding with uncertainty. He maintained a false calm, but his decision was made in an instant.

‘I could intervene for him, even if it means destroying this manifested body... but I have no grounds to stand on!’

As a thousand hesitations warred in his mind, the golden-eyed youth above raised an eyebrow. Mysterious golden patterns surfaced on his neck as he spoke coolly, 

"I wonder, Dragon King, do you despise the Bright Yang of Wei-Li, or are you simply blind? Fate has decreed this. Can you not see what is so plainly manifest, that you must resort to such taunts?"

The youth had already risen from his seat. He met the chilling gaze in Guangfou’s cyan-black eyes as a golden light condensed in his hand, forming a bright white halberd section by section. A surge of multicolored light erupted from behind him.

The halberd was already braced before him. A torrent of demonic energy submerged the entire mountain range, and the Dragon Demon’s figure seemed to magnify infinitely within the black mist. Guangfou’s cold laughter spread with the darkness across the sky, plunging the mountains into pitch black. All that remained were a pair of luminous golden eyes shining in the dark and a single, icy statement.

"The Pure Yang Bracelets? I'll let the Dragon King have his fill."

Guangfou’s laughter rolled like thunder, cold and tinged with the Dragon Demon's strange hoarseness.

"Such audacity!"

A crescent-shaped halberd hung in the air. The black energy in the sky cascaded down like a waterfall, a massive, brilliant saber aura pressing down like a mountain upon the halberd, forcing it to slam into the ground and erupt in a dazzling flash of golden light.

This Dragon King had no regard for propriety; the saber and demonic energy at his waist had clearly been brewing for some time!

"BOOM!"

The brilliant golden light exploded, striking like a massive, heavy hammer. It pierced through the mountain, driving deep into the earth. At the same time, all the black energy lifted from the mountain, soaring into the sky and transforming into a colossal dragon of clouds coiling in the heavens. As Guangfou sheathed his saber, the cloud dragon let out an earth-shattering roar.

The surging demonic energy forced Maha Minghui back three steps, a chill filling his heart.

‘They're actually fighting! A Dragon King with two divine abilities...’

Dragons, masters of the Eastern Sea, descendants of Dao Embryos and Great Sages—an unblemished, direct bloodline. They were the noblest of Demon beasts in the current world!

Throughout history, there have only been a few Great Sages among the Demon beasts. The bloodline of the Yuwu bird was nearly extinct. Even the peacocks, not considered a pure lineage, earned the utmost respect of all cultivators by siding with the Buddhist path. And these were nothing compared to the Dragons!

And what kind of Demon beast was Guangfou? A noble Dragon Prince from the Black Dragon branch. Even with only two divine abilities, he was enough to leave Maha Minghui helpless. Forget his divine abilities... the Spiritual Treasures he carried were more than enough to ensure his utter demise here!

In the brief moment it took to think this, a brilliant gold light shot up from the ground, becoming a golden meteor that tore through the sky with a powerful shockwave.

"ROAR!"

But the black-robed Demon King in the sky merely opened his mouth. Vicious scales and long, sharp fangs appeared as he spat out a beam of pure black flame, as thick as a mountain peak!

"Huala..."

The golden radiance was instantly swallowed, but the roiling, multicolored clouds continued to gather in the sky. Guangfou’s dragon eyes grew brighter, and a hint of a smile crossed his savage face.

‘Sovereign's Perilous Tread...’

He suddenly raised his hand, blocking in front of him, and caught something with a fierce grasp. A crack of thunder sounded as he intercepted an incoming fist.

Li Zhouwei had emerged from the flames, his golden eyes blazing, now just inches away.

The radiant struggle of dharma power and divine ability flared between their palms. The flames from Guangfou’s mouth instantly ceased, his face returning to its majestic, domineering appearance. Behind him, the colossal dragon formed from his divine ability and dharma power raised its head high and once again spat fire!
Demonic flames, thick with demonic energy, poured down. The patterns on Li Zhouwei's face grew brighter. His Bright Yang dharma power and Illuminating Sun and Moon technique worked in unison, refining all the demonic energy before him. Yet the surging power of the divine ability still washed over his face, threatening to melt his manifested body.

"Despise the Bright Yang of Wei-Li?"

Guangfou stared at him with his cyan-black eyes and sneered, his voice hoarse. 

"When Emperor Gong was on the throne, my grandfather visited the palace three times. Li Guangheng was my father's sworn brother. The Pure Yang Bracelets were personally retrieved by my family. When the Wei-Li rose and fell, my father was the only one willing to stand up for them, and for it, his dragon tendons were ripped out and he perished. To this day, Dragon-Trapping Ridge in the lands of Long is a grotto-heaven of the Chen Kingdom... And you want to talk to me about the Wei-Li?"

"Who despises the Bright Yang of Wei-Li? Is it Dingjiao, or is it me? Li Zhouwei... you'd better think carefully."

The Dragon Demon's words were heavy with meaning. His black pupils gave Li Zhouwei a warning look before he cracked a smile, demonic energy snaking from his nostrils.

"Are you the Bright Yang of Wei-Li... or is the Wei Emperor the Bright Yang of Wei-Li?"

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes slightly, a smile also appearing on his face. The spot between his brows brightened rapidly as Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light poured out, neutralizing all the demonic flames. A low, roar-like laugh rumbled from the young man's throat.

"You talk of the Wei-Li? Today, the Heavenly Glow shepherds the Wei Emperor, and the rising sun's chains bind the Qilin. What is there to talk about! If you truly had a way to save the Wei Emperor, there would be no need for me to be here today!"

The radiance between his brows swiftly transformed into a bottomless darkness. A torrent of Emperor Qi's Light surged forth, and countless streams of gold and black light blotted out the sky, suppressing all the demonic energy. At the same time, the White Qilin's cold voice rang out:

"Who is the Bright Yang of Wei-Li? Hierarchy is Bright Yang, and for a son to slay his father is also Bright Yang. The Wei Emperor holds the seat of honor, but does he possess any honor today? The mandate of Bright Yang has descended upon me, to occupy the position of opposition, to slay the Monarch-Father, to seize authority. I stand at the Yang Cusp. If I am favored by the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment and defy the Emperor, then upon my ascension, I am the Bright Yang!"

He burst into laughter, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

"If I truly become this Bright Yang of Wei-Li, will you eliminate me, or will you aid me?!"

The demonic energy in Guangfou's eyes surged. He was momentarily speechless, the muscles on his face twitching. His skin tore open as black, horn-like ridges grew out, and two long, horned whiskers sprouted from the corners of his lips, unfurling in the demonic flames.

Li Zhouwei's words were not without reason. A son honoring his father is Bright Yang; a son slaying his father is also Bright Yang. Guangfou claimed to defend the Bright Yang of Wei-Li and wanted to kill him to help Li Qianyuan. But Li Qianyuan, though seated upon the Fruition Attainment, was an emperor without a empire. He could no longer be the Bright Yang Monarch-Father!

And though Li Zhouwei was below the Fruition Attainment, for a uniquely sovereign Fruition Attainment like Bright Yang to favor someone outside it could only mean one thing—it wanted him to slay his father.

If Li Zhouwei obeyed the will of the Fruition Attainment, he would perfectly embody the inverted, rebellious position of the Bright Yang—the Yang Cusp. He would be the one to represent the Bright Yang!

Black, mist-like energy churned in Guangfou's eyes. His body, which had already begun to transform during their exchange, continued to shift. His large hands became massive, savage demon claws, scattering demonic flames.

The clouds in the sky thickened, revealing glimpses of scales and claws, long horns, and sharp white fangs. Deep black dragon eyes, like pools of water in the mist, blotted out the sky.

A pitch-black fog enveloped everything. Guangfou's dragon head, savage and immense, slowly lowered toward the tiny speck of golden light. The Dragon King's voice held a mix of amusement and madness.

"Do you dare ascend the throne?!"

Li Zhouwei stood amidst the infinite darkness. He raised his halberd, aiming it directly at Guangfou's true form. Black flames surged from his body, the long blade gleaming with a blindingly cold light. He smiled calmly.

"I am capable of slaying a Monarch."

---

The black clouds in the sky dispersed like mist. Guangfou was gone. In his place stood a powerfully built, gray-haired man, his eyes glowing with a deep red light. Patches of grayish-white fur were visible in the gaps of his armor. He stood with his hands behind his back, as imposing as a mountain.

Behind this man stood another figure, clad in armor that shimmered with a faint blue light. His face was hidden beneath a helmet, his features obscured.

Li Zhouwei relaxed his grip, and the halberd vanished from his palm. He cupped his fist in greeting.

"Greetings, Dragon King Beihai."

Dongfang Lieyun's gaze was dark as he stared into the distance. "The White Qilin is too polite."

He looked directly into Li Zhouwei's eyes.

"I have not managed Yinzhou Island well and have made a fool of myself before the White Qilin. Fortunately, I was nearby in the sea. I heard the qilin's cry and the dragon's roar and rushed over from the Beihai Sea. I am not too late."

"More eyes are turning this way. Let us head into the mountains first."

Dongfang Lieyun's expression was ugly, as if he had lost a great deal of face. He simply led Li Zhouwei deeper into the island. Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal and descended on a beam of light, sneering inwardly.

‘Right on time.’

Master Ping Yan's spirit mountain had been flattened. The earth and rock had crumbled, pavilions had collapsed, revealing the stark white bones within the mountain's core. A sea of crimson blood gushed out, pooling on the ground. A swarm of Demon beasts had gathered like flies at the mountain's edge, greedily drinking the blood, refusing to leave even when driven away by Ping Yan's disciples.

Master Ping Yan was kneeling firmly amidst the ruins. Maha Minghui stood respectfully to one side, his head bowed, trying to shrink into a corner in the hope that the Dragon King wouldn't notice him. Dongfang Lieyun indeed didn't spare him a single glance. Instead, he stared coldly at Ping Yan.

"Useless."

The fiend didn't dare breathe, remaining prostrated on the ground. "Greetings, Beihai Dragon King! Greetings, Xu Water Demon King!"

Dongfang Lieyun didn't utter a word in reply. He strode past him, and the Xu Water Demon King behind him also remained silent. They led Li Zhouwei through a golden palace and a golden hall, deep into the island, until they reached a palace as massive as a mountain.

The Dragon-kin were just as they always were. The main seat in the hall was as large as a house. Dongfang Lieyun sat down, his expression cold, and said gravely,

"You've seen a joke."

Li Zhouwei shook his head, his tone flat.

"I learned a great deal from my exchange with the Dragon Prince."

His golden eyes were calm, showing no sign of anger or offense, but they held a cold glint. He showed no fear, even before this Dragon King, and instead asked,

"I wonder about the origin of these Pure Yang Bracelets. To think they would cause trouble for the Crown Prince!"

Dongfang Lieyun's strange, red-glowing eyes stared at him.

"Back then, the Wei Emperor bestowed three sets of bracelets. One was the Pure Yang Bracelets, which you now possess, given to his younger brother, Li Guangheng. The second was the Everlasting Peace, given to Touba Changming. The third was the Exalted Harmony, given to Shilou Chongyang of the Gao family."

"Bracelets were originally used during the Zhou dynasty to bind slaves, locked around the wrist. They are not a good omen. Bestowing them upon a subject was a way to ensure they would pacify a region without fleeing or betraying..."

"The Touba and Shilou families are major tribes on the border, leaders of the Sixteen Tribes of the Eastern Hu. Giving them these bracelets was naturally a way to ensure they would obediently guard Wei's borders and not entertain any other ideas, promising them great rewards in return."

Dongfang Lieyun smiled.

"Giving them to Li Guangheng... carried a similar meaning."

Li Zhouwei's expression tightened slightly. He remained silent.

‘So, it was a warning to me...’

If the Wei Emperor used them to warn his subjects and kin, what did it mean for the Dragon-kin to gift them to him now! The implication was all too clear.

Dongfang Lieyun, however, appeared perfectly calm as he watched him.

"Dingjiao has also achieved a divine ability now. Unfortunately, an old ancestor in the sea is celebrating a birthday, so he could not come to meet you, which is a great pity. He told me personally that your affairs were to be left for him to arrange."

"You can consider it a gesture of concern."

Dongfang Lieyun's expression was placid. Li Zhouwei cupped his fist in thanks and smiled casually.

"That's right. After all, the Crown Prince's subordinates are all in Zhulu. If I need to prepare for my own funeral, I will certainly need their help. It's just that with the great chaos just beginning, my family is short-handed, so it hasn't been put on the agenda."

The Dragon King's expression was unreadable. He leaned back in his great seat and said softly,

"That's no matter. You don't need to worry about Guangfou's faction. They can't change anything; they can only cause you some justifiable trouble here. There's no rush. At the very least, wait until you have three divine abilities before proceeding..."

He shook his head.

"Dingjiao's Life Divine Ability is not yet complete, making this matter very inconvenient. But he insists on handling it personally, so we will wait for him for a few years. It also gives you time to free up your hands!"

Li Zhouwei nodded. He took a box from his sleeve. Inside, shimmering with a myriad of enchanting colors, lay a piece of water-gold.

"This is Sinking Savage Aged Gold, a spiritual object from the Purple Mansion Realm of the Converging Water. It came from a grotto-heaven and is quite rare. Since the Crown Prince has achieved a divine ability, please accept this humble gift. The item may be small, but the sentiment is deep."

Dongfang Lieyun reached out, pinched the jade box between his nails, and tucked it into his robes.

"I thank the White Qilin on his behalf," he said casually.

The Dragon-kin would certainly look down on such a small item. To put it bluntly, it wasn't even enough to fill the gaps between their teeth. Li Zhouwei's gesture was purely one of sentiment. He turned his gaze to the general at the side.

"Are you the Xu Water Demon King?"

The general was startled for a moment, then bowed his head respectfully.

"Reporting to the great king, this subordinate is Lu Xu, humbly serving as king in Xu Water."

This general, a dignified mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast, could have swaggered through more than ninety percent of the lands as an overlord. Yet he stood so deferentially behind Dongfang Lieyun, and his attitude toward Li Zhouwei was as respectful as a minor demon's. A thought stirred in Li Zhouwei's mind.

‘Although Demon beasts are sometimes weaker than humans in combat, and occasionally even a notch below Buddhist cultivators, they have long lifespans, and those with good bloodlines break through with ease. With generations of accumulation, the power of the Dragon-kin beneath the Eastern Sea... is truly unfathomable.’

His expression remained calm as he smiled.

"Years ago, there was a White Brocade River King who saved one of my most capable generals. He has been wanting to repay the favor all these years but has had no news of him. I heard recently that he is now under the Demon King's command. If there is an opportunity, perhaps the two could meet."

The Xu Water Demon King lowered his head slightly.

"This humble demon understands."

Seeing that he understood immediately, Li Zhouwei rose and bowed.

"Since I have already fought on Yinzhou Island, I fear others may have noticed and will take the opportunity to invade my lake while it is undefended. I shall not impose any longer!"

Dongfang Lieyun nodded. Seated on his throne, he watched him depart, his dragon eyes filled with a cold light as if pondering something deeply.

‘Li Zhouwei... now that he has a divine ability, his bearing has changed. I fear he has ambition... I just hope he doesn't cause any trouble for me when the time comes!’

His gaze grew colder, and the atmosphere in the great hall became stagnant. After a long time, he finally spoke coldly,

"Xu Water!"

The general at his side bowed his head.

"Your subject is here."

"Make a trip to the Lie Sea."

---

Li Zhouwei left the palace and returned to Master Ping Yan's mountain gate. He found that the collapsed mountain had been piled back together, though the pavilions and buildings were still under construction. The fiend hurried to greet him on the mountainside, a fawning smile on his face.

"My deepest apologies for the offense. Please do not take it to heart..."

Li Zhouwei's mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, and he had no patience for him. With a flick of his sleeve, he asked,

"Where is Minghui?"

Ping Yan quickly replied,

"The battle between the two great kings scared the living daylights out of him. When he saw you being led away by the Dragon King, he fled outside at once. He said he would wait for you outside the island."

Seeing him point the way, Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. He rode the wind up from the demon's lair, finally leaving the gloomy, blood-soaked demon island.

As he flew outward, he soon spotted the monk waiting in the sky on an auspicious cloud. He had already reverted to his true form, surrounded by a pile of golden artifacts, eagerly looking out for him.

The moment Li Zhouwei appeared, he eagerly flew over on his cloud, bowed limply, and quickly smiled.

"Great King... Your prowess is truly divine! That was a noble Dragon Prince, yet you fought him to a standstill..."

The shock had been too great for him. Even with his eloquent tongue, he was at a loss for words. But Li Zhouwei knew the truth.

‘Neither of us used any Spiritual Artifacts or Spiritual Treasures. We didn't even use our divine abilities. It was just a brief exchange. If we had truly fought, given the immense size of his dragon body and the depth of his dharma power, he could have pulled out three to five Spiritual Treasures at once. How could I have fought that...’

This was a case of flattery falling flat. However, since their cultivation levels were similar, Li Zhouwei just saw it as mutual praise and couldn't be bothered to listen. He said:

"The items you promised my great-uncle back then, how much of it have you managed to retrieve today?"

The question made Maha Minghui smile nervously.

"I have it prepared... all prepared!"

He flipped his sleeve and took out a crystal-clear, glazed bead. Placing it in his palm, he smiled.

"Great King, take a look!"

Li Zhouwei frowned and looked at it for a moment. He felt rays of golden light piercing his eyes, all refracting into a glazed luminescence that could confuse the mind. He asked:

"What is this?"

Maha Minghui smiled.

"Following your request, fellow Daoist, I sought out many people. First, I needed to trade for a spirit fire, and second, for some Spiritual Artifacts... but I couldn't make a big fuss about it, so I asked around quietly, here and there, and managed to find something good."

"This is Blazing Fire. I've heard it can ward off cold and draw out baleful energy... It's sealed within this glazed bead and has been refined through various transformations. It can be considered an Enlightened Artifact. As for its name... I'm not entirely sure."

Just one look, and Li Zhouwei knew something was wrong. He frowned.

What had he given Maha Minghui? Some golden artifacts confiscated from the Merciful One. At most, the golden ring taken from Maha Taixi and the kasaya robe from earlier held some value... But what was this in Minghui's hand?

Buddhist cultivators were already poor in good items, let alone an Enlightened Artifact painstakingly forged from a Purple Mansion Realm spirit fire? This Enlightened Artifact would be extremely valuable in the north. If it had the status of a Spiritual Treasure, then the items he had given were at best a spirit embryo or a Spiritual Artifact...

‘Who trades like this! This is almost like my family trading away the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument for trinkets like the Reveal River, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, and the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman... Aren't you getting ripped off!’

Although the two couldn't be considered perfectly equal—this bead was far inferior to the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument—the analogy was very close. It made Li Zhouwei frown, and he immediately became wary.

"Maha is quite the businessman!" he said coldly.

The remark left Maha Minghui speechless. He looked at him with an awkward expression.

"Great King, please let me explain..."

He gave another awkward smile and continued,

"I received news from Mount Dayang. In a few days, they are sending me south to be stationed in Jiangbei..."

He stopped there, but Li Zhouwei's face showed understanding. Maha Minghui said ingratiatingly,

"As you know, fellow Daoist, my Lotus Temple has always been close to immortal cultivators and has never had any intention of heading south. Because of this, our relationship with the other paths has become increasingly tense in recent years. For Mount Dayang to send my disciple-brothers and me south this time, we will surely be the vanguard... They might even send us to the lake!"

The monk rubbed his bald head and smiled.

"I beg the Great King to show mercy..."

Li Zhouwei felt a bit troubled. He shook his head.

"In the heat of battle, divine abilities have no eyes. How can there be mercy? It's either you kill me, or I kill you. If I show you mercy, who will show my family mercy? What's more..."

His golden eyes narrowed as he stared at him intently.

"Anyone who dares to run rampant on my lake will certainly have to leave something behind. Either their manifested body and golden artifacts, or their life-mandate."

Minghui's heart pounded as he listened. He had made up the part about being sent to the lake, but on second thought, was it really something his fellow disciples wouldn't do? He said awkwardly,

"I understand! I understand!"

His eyes darted around, and he smiled.

"Since the great one has sold the golden artifacts to me, I will go back, melt them down, sell them, and then forge a new one. I will absolutely not let the great one break his rules. When the time comes, you can just take it! Bundle it together with the golden artifacts from those fellow disciples, ah, fellow practitioners, and then sell them back to me... Wouldn't that be the best of both worlds!"

Li Zhouwei's expression was strange as he heard this. He sized up the monk carefully and smiled.

"What if I want a life-mandate?"

"Eh!"

Minghui chuckled.

"What's so difficult about that? I certainly won't be the only one coming! Fellow Daoist, just focus on those... those from the Way of Great Desire, the Way of Compassion, and that... that what's-it-called Earth... the Great Adoration Dharma Realm! Just beat them up. You can take as many life-mandates as you want!"

"As for me... hehe, just let your elder fight with me. I guarantee I won't hurt him!"

Li Zhouwei's mouth twitched. He sized him up while pondering, his expression growing stranger. Finally, he said,

"I wouldn't be so sure. I don't think you can beat him."




# Chapter 1030: No Distinction Between Black and White

"Oh…"

Li Zhouwei's words caught him off guard, lodging in his throat. For a long moment, Minghui was speechless, managing only an awkward, formal bow.

"My apologies for the offense!"

He raised his eyebrows, still feeling his performance lacked sufficient greed. With a thick-skinned grin, he added,

"And… and also the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood that Fellow Daoist Zhaojing promised me all those years ago…"

Only then did Li Zhouwei feel he truly looked the part of a monk. He mulled it over.

'Right… there's that Daoist Master Yan in the Eastern Sea. If Uncle achieves World's Radiance, getting the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood back is just a matter of time.'

Seeing how wealthy the monk was, however, sparked an idea.

'The north has been occupied by Buddhist cultivators for many years. A vast number of Immortal Dao treasures have fallen into their hands, most of which they can't even use… just as our Treasured Artifacts have little value in the south. Exchanging spiritual resources from the north could be a very profitable path.'

'The Lotus Temple is playing both sides, dissatisfied with both Mount Dayang and the Viewing Pavilion. Whether their discontent is genuine or just a facade, their words can't be trusted. But this channel for offloading Enlightened Artifacts cannot be severed.'

Though he didn't trust the Lotus Temple, he knew he'd be dealing with many more Buddhist items in the future. This thought brought a measure of tolerance. He took the treasures from Minghui's hands and replied, "My uncle has already received news. He won't keep you waiting long. I'll pass your message along… however…"

He looked up. "I wonder just how many spiritual resources the Maha, or rather, the Lotus Temple, has available for trade."

Minghui paused, then nodded eagerly. "My master has a fondness for collecting Immortal Dao treasures. He has… quite a few…"

Li Zhouwei considered this. "I need something that can aid in breaking through a divine ability."

Minghui racked his brain, fumbling in his sleeve for some time before finally producing a small box. He hesitated.

"Has the great master heard of… the Supreme Concealed Origin?"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"You have impressive connections!" he said, a note of suspicion in his voice.

Minghui shook his head repeatedly, pressing his palms together.

"It is rumored that Mount Dayang possesses the Supreme Concealed Origin. This item resonates with the Immortal Pure Qi, and when catalyzed within a Grotto-Heaven, it produces a unique spiritual qi called the 'Soul-Listening Purple Intent Qi'."

"This substance is beneficial to the Immortal Dao. While it doesn't significantly increase one's cultivation base and is difficult to use in alchemy, it does have some effect in augmenting divine abilities. My master left behind a good deal of it. When I achieved the rank of Maha, he gave me a portion to aid my practice, instructing me that the north and south are originally one Dao, and that constant contemplation would surely yield benefits…"

A pained expression flickered across his face as he opened the jade box.

"Please, have a look, great master!"

As Li Zhouwei lifted the lid, he saw layers of purple intent sealed within the box by dharma power. The moment his spiritual sense swept over it, he felt his divine abilities stir. His golden eyes flashed.

"Is this… Purple Qi?"

Minghui smiled.

"Precisely! Purple Qi is one aspect of the Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence. It is intimately connected to the Immortal Dao and perfectly suits your needs, Fellow Daoist!"

Li Zhouwei examined it for a moment longer before nodding. "Excellent."

The monk beamed.

"I lack my master's talent," Minghui said with a nod. "My research into this has been fruitless. I would rather trade it for some more practical spiritual resources. I'll melt them down with these golden artifacts and forge a fine treasure—many of your wondrous items are useless to me. Something more direct would be best… something indestructible, or that can traverse the Great Void. Those are the kinds of abilities I can certainly put to use!"

Li Zhouwei thought for a moment. "The Crane-Embrace Stone… would that be of use to you? It can be used to embellish a dharma artifact, granting it the ability to travel through space. It belongs to the way of True Qi and is compatible with all Daos."

Minghui had never actually heard of this Crane-Embrace Stone, but hearing it had the power of spatial travel was enough to know it wouldn't be a wasted trade. He was secretly relieved, but on the surface, he feigned a sudden realization and smiled.

"That's exactly what I need!"

Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement.

Unfortunately, the Crane-Embrace Stone was still with Li Ximing and couldn't be retrieved immediately. They agreed to have it delivered later. Li Zhouwei reached into his sleeve, sighing internally.

'Of the items I gained in the Grotto-Heaven, aside from the Li Fire resources, almost everything has been spent. Even of the things I got from Mount Changxiao, only the Bound Heart-Ice is worth mentioning… In the end, it's never enough!'

The Blazing Fire in Minghui's possession had come from the north and been refined by Buddhist cultivators. Now, it had passed from Minghui's hands to Li Ximing's with what seemed like a lack of caution. The Blazing Fire wasn't something their family needed, but fortunately, they possessed the Intercalary Sun Art. Although it had little to do with Blazing Fire, they could experiment. At the very least, they had to erase any traces of Buddhist refinement.

'For Uncle, this is a trivial matter.'

Minghui was, after all, one of the Northern Buddhists. Li Zhouwei saw no reason to prolong their conversation. He summoned the wind and departed, heading west.

Minghui lowered his hands. Despite having given away a treasure, he showed little regret. He wiped his hands on his kasaya, tucked the pile of golden artifacts into his sleeve, and began to ponder.

'That's only enough for thirty percent of the spiritual fire. I wonder how much Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood I'll get.'

His master's soul had encountered a problem, which had once shattered his cultivation path. In the years since, he had risen from the ashes, switching to another Dao. He had made rapid progress in his spell arts, achieving great things in both the Immortal and Buddhist paths. The matter of his soul was no longer so urgent.

Minghui felt a knot of anxiety.

'None of the affairs this man is involved in are simple… Just standing on the sidelines is a risk to one's life. Now he's gone and fought a Dragon Prince. How am I supposed to navigate this mess!'

'Forget it, forget it… I'll go back and ask my master. I'll just repeat their words exactly and let him analyze them. Perhaps he'll see something I don't. That White Qilin is already getting suspicious. I can't be so lavish next time… I need to act greedier…'

He dismissed his auspicious cloud, and with a push of his foot, transformed into a streak of brilliant golden light, vanishing into the Great Void.

---

An unknown amount of time passed before the mist over the sea began to thicken. Thunder rumbled ceaselessly in the sky. Layer upon layer of black clouds stacked high, as if some colossal creature were swimming through the air.

Demonic clouds billowed within the dense fog. The black-robed man still stood against the horizon, hands clasped behind his back. A swirl of violet-black energy churned in his eyes, his expression complex.

'Dragon King Beihai… Dongfang You has been dead for many years… He is the master of the White Dragon lineage now.'

Despite having just fought a major battle with Li Zhouwei and being hastily driven away by Dongfang Lieyun, Guangfou's gaze was perfectly calm. He stared silently to the west until a soft voice spoke beside him.

"Well?"

The cold, murderous intent was gone from the demon dragon's eyes, replaced by clear suspicion. "Their guess is a safe one, but I don't believe Luoxia would do such a thing."

"Oh?" The voice beside him gained a hint of emotion. "You think them incapable?"

Guangfou shook his head.

"They are capable, but they wouldn't do it right under the nose of the Underworld. It would be pointless and would violate Luoxia's principles. Or rather—Luoxia would disdain to do so."

The voice paused. "Even if it means allowing a new master to ascend to the throne of Bright Yang?"

Waves of demonic qi rippled from the demon dragon's sleeves. He raised his eyes to the heavens, his gaze fixed on the distant sun half-submerged in a sea of clouds.

"Whether he can ascend is hard to say," he said flatly.

"But they won't be afraid. When the Jade True Monarch ascended, did you see any fear in the heavens? On the contrary, they celebrated for the world, for the Heavenly Glow. They celebrated that the old Jade True master would never return."

"And with his departure, the world gained a measure of peace."

---

In the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

The clouds swirled with iridescent light. Li Ximing slowly awoke from his meditation, and the Heavenly Light within the pavilion instantly dimmed.

He rose and lifted a hand. A few specks of golden light emerged from his fingertips, circled his wrist, and returned. The Daoist Master, dressed in white-gold robes, looked up slightly.

"My World's Radiance is complete!"

Cultivating this World's Radiance Immortal Foundation had cost him more than just a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual pill—it was a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill from the Bright Yang Dao. Not to mention the immense time and effort!

'No wonder people resort to seizing another's Immortal Foundation… This cultivation session required not only a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual pill and a Golden Core-level Grotto-Heaven and Blessed Land, but I also had the boost from Talisman Qi! Without it, my speed would have been three or four times slower. How long would it have taken then!'

He sighed inwardly.

'Even after all that, the chance of failure was still high. If I lacked the proper cultivation art or got stuck at the immortal threshold, I could at least go out and make arrangements, which would be somewhat relaxing. But to have a divine ability right in front of me and be unable to grasp it… it is truly a trial of the mind.'

Li Ximing took a step forward, leaving the Grotto-Heaven and appearing within the inner array. With another step, he was in the midst of Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

The mountain was bathed in shimmering Heavenly Light. A young man stood under a gardenia tree, lost in thought. Seeing Li Ximing appear, Li Zhouwei turned and clasped his hands.

"Uncle!"

Li Ximing smiled. "You've returned quickly!"

"It's been almost half a year." Li Zhouwei's expression was somewhat grim. He shook his head. "I fought a Dragon Prince on Yinzhou Island. My whereabouts have been exposed, so I didn't have time to go to the Southern Sea. I had to rush back. The only consolation is that the matter with Minghui was resolved, so it wasn't a completely wasted trip."

"What?!"

A jolt of shock went through Li Ximing. "A Dragon Prince? Dingjiao? How did things escalate to that point!"

Li Zhouwei paced as he recounted the events on Yinzhou Island, his voice heavy.

"I had long suspected that Guangfou couldn't kill me, but the moment Dongfang Lieyun appeared, I could finally breathe easy. Now, I have met with both the Underworld and Luoxia. More importantly, the Yang clan offered me a kingship. I, Li Zhouwei, am now an open piece on the chessboard. The Dragon-kin are unlikely to remove me rashly."

"Perhaps if I had refused the Yang clan's offer that day, there might have been a slim chance I would have died on Yinzhou Island. If someone were to make a move, it would likely have been the White Dragon."

Li Ximing was stunned. "The White Dragon? Dingjiao? But… wasn't he friendly toward you?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head silently.

"Not him. Dragon King Beihai. Dingjiao was just following orders. Back then, he was only in the Foundation Establishment Realm; his perspective was completely different."

In truth, Li Zhouwei never believed there was any real conflict between the various lineages of the Dragon-kin. They might have different stances, but their ultimate goal was the same.

"Uncle, the different lineages' attitudes toward me simply represent the various considerations of the Dragon-kin…" Li Zhouwei's voice dropped.

"When it comes to me, the Dragon-kin are conflicted, both emotionally and strategically. Of course they don't want me to accelerate the fall of Bright Yang… but that doesn't mean they feel any particular closeness to Li Qianyuan. As I said during our fight, if the Dragon-kin truly had the ability and the desire to save Bright Yang, why would I, Li Zhouwei, even exist today?"

"The very fact that I exist, that a White Qilin can come and go from the Dragon Palace, proves that at their core, there must be a faction among the Dragon-kin that wants Li Qianyuan dead!"

He enunciated each word carefully. "As long as the throne has a master, who is to say who cannot sit upon it?"

Li Ximing met his gaze, and understanding dawned.

The contradictory stance of the Dragon-kin pointed to another possibility—they also wanted him to seek the proof of Bright Yang, but the result of attaining that Fruition Attainment must be his ascension! A True Monarch friendly to the Dragon-kin would be a great help to their own path to truth!

'You, Li Zhouwei, either don't seek proof, or if you do, you must succeed!'

Li Ximing opened his mouth to speak but stopped as Li Zhouwei gave a sardonic laugh.

"As for the reincarnation through Metallic Essence? I don't know if you believe it, Uncle, but I certainly don't."

How could he, Li Zhouwei, command such respect? Why would the Dragon-kin help him? Because he was Bright Yang. But since he had reincarnated to cultivate another path, why would they still help him? If he could bring them no benefit, why would the Dragon-kin show such compassion as to expend a portion of Metallic Essence for his reincarnation? Were they short one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?!

'By retracting one's essence, one can form a golden rainbow. If becoming an immortal requires the Dao, how could they let you attain it so easily!'

As a ploy of the Luoxia immortals, the play's demons mocking the mountain was not just Luoxia guessing at the Dragon-kin's tone; it was a biting satire of their methods!

From the very beginning, the reincarnation through Metallic Essence was likely just a ploy to placate him and send him to his death!

'This is precisely why the Dragon-kin seem so hesitant. It has nothing to do with any lingering affection for the Wei-Li clan. What a joke. The mighty Dragon-kin, remembering some old sentiment for a Wei-Li descendant? Preposterous!'

This meant that the so-called reincarnation proposed by the White Dragon lineage, led by Dongfang Lieyun, was meaningless. The Dragon-kin either couldn't do it, or didn't want to! They were merely playing it safe, not believing he could succeed, and wanting him to not challenge the Fruition Attainment, but to die quietly!

That was why Guangfou had sneered during their battle, saying things like,

"Who despises the Wei-Li Bright Yang? Is it Dingjiao, or is it me? Li Zhouwei… have you thought it through?"

So, was Guangfou as friendly to the Wei state as he claimed? No! He was not friendly to Li Qianyuan, but to the _position_ of Wei-Li Bright Yang. He would support whoever could sit on that throne. This was the true will of the Dragon-kin—they would rather have a new Bright Yang True Monarch to support them than a half-dead Li Qianyuan! That was the will that drove Guangfou to act!

And the aggressive Black Dragon lineage didn't fully trust him either. Guangfou was just testing the waters, deliberately provoking him to see if he possessed the rebellious heart—and the ability—to seize the throne!

In that exchange, the rebellious heart was even more important than the ability.

But the White Dragon lineage was watching from the sidelines like a tiger. Li Zhouwei was ninety percent certain that Dragon King Beihai was playing it safe, desperately hoping he would serve his purpose by drawing the north's attention, run his course in the world, and then quietly perish!

That was why Dongfang Lieyun had specifically pointed out the meaning of the Pure Yang Bracelets!

Li Ximing stared into his nephew's golden eyes. After a long silence, he said, 

"They have you trapped… caught in the middle. Not a single one of them has a clear stance…"

Li Zhouwei slowly closed his eyes.

"A clear stance… whether to kill me or to fully support me, both come at a price. Both would invite countermeasures from the other two groups. It's not that they can't afford the price. They are waiting."

"If I am truly worthless, they will plot my demise. If I am truly a rebellious Bright Yang, one who could ascend to the Monarch's throne, I may not be as domineering as High Radiance in his prime, ruling his subjects through righteousness. Instead, I would be like the reverse of the Yang Cusp, feigning loyalty while plotting dissent, using cunning to defy one's Monarch. How could I fear the stalemate between two lineages?"

Li Ximing watched him quietly, watched as his junior revealed a chilling smile.

"They… are worried I'm not wicked enough!"

Li Ximing [Early-Stage Purple Mansion Realm] [Purple Mansion Realm Alchemist] [Direct Descendant of the Elder Branch]




# Chapter 1031: The Unfading Glory

The Heavenly Light bathed everything.

Li Ximing stood listening in the mountains for a long while without a word, hearing Li Zhouwei’s low voice continue.

"This affair is far from over. With the new dynasty established, the conflict between north and south will only intensify. The pressure on Dongfang Lieyun's side will mount, and he will need to be placated… As for the Dragon-kin… in the end, not only can they not be trusted, we may even find ourselves on opposing sides."

Finally hearing these words, a trace of helplessness flashed across Li Ximing's face.

"Does our Li Clan… truly have no place to even breathe under the Dragon-kin?"

Li Zhouwei turned his head slightly, his gaze shifting from the other man's face to the cup on the table. He shook his head.

"That's not entirely true. Success would solve everything, of course. But if we fail, the main heirs will have to be cut off. Que'Wan and the other branches, however, could still survive, just like the Cui Clan of Chongzhou."

Seeing Li Ximing’s flicker of doubt, Li Zhouwei explained, "This is why I chose to send Que'Wan away… instead of Jiangqian. She does not have the golden eyes. If we arrange things properly, and if there is even the slightest chance she might seek a Whole Pill in the future, there is profit to be made. A place for her in the Qunyi Archipelago is not impossible."

He stressed his next words, his tone heavy with conviction.

"After all, the thunder of the Lie Sea cannot be moved! I have met the Lady… she is held in extremely high regard by the Dragon-kin!"

This string of revelations gave Li Ximing pause. He considered it carefully for a time and saw the logic in it. With a sigh, he nodded.

"I can only hope that our aunt’s words carry weight before the Dragon Monarch."

"It's the Golden Feather Sect that will likely cause trouble in the future!"

Li Zhouwei didn't dwell on it, instead recounting his experiences in Chongzhou and presenting the Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence to Li Ximing. Before Li Ximing could examine it, he suddenly frowned and asked,

"I've heard of the great prestige of that lord from the Golden Feather Sect. If he truly rose from the bones of the fallen Wei… he certainly wouldn't want to see the Wei Emperor cling to life. He might even have designs on you… as for whether he would help…"

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "One cannot overestimate that lord’s schemes. Who knows if the Golden Feather Sect's actions toward our family over the years have just been them placing their pieces on the board. As for your assertion that he rose from the ashes of the Wei… I don't think that's quite right. From the descriptions of his age, it seems more likely he was already in a position of power. The fall of the Great Wei was merely a ritual he used to legitimize his name."

"A ritual to legitimize his name…"

The bluntness of the statement silenced Li Ximing. He looked at his junior’s blazing eyes, his heart pounding.

'He means… the Geng-Dui shift…'

If a True Hornless Dragon could possess a technique like Refining Pristine Water into Converging Water, then it was highly probable that the Geng-Dui shift was caused by this True Monarch Taiyuan. A shift of such magnitude, affecting nearly all of the popular Geng-Dui spiritual materials of the current age, was a testament to the True Monarch’s profound influence on the world and his mastery over Fruition Attainment!

'The Geng-Dui shift… logically, there should be two figures involved. If this one is Dui, the other is likely Geng… I can't even imagine what era such a person would be from…'

He dared not say more and quickly changed the subject.

"You're right. Tianhuo still owes me a favor, though I can't tell if that was intentional. The more I think about it, the more it looks like a convenient excuse for him to act on our family's behalf… The attitudes of these exalted figures… the signs were there all along."

The younger man let the topic drop and smiled.

"But now, I have some good news."

Li Zhouwei retrieved a box from his sleeve and placed it on the table.

"This is Soul-Listening Purple Intent Qi."

Li Ximing lowered his gaze and saw the hazy purple qi swirling in dense layers within the box.

"I obtained this from Minghui," Li Zhouwei said.

"It can aid in achieving a breakthrough with a divine ability. I prepared it especially for you, Uncle… I estimate it's not much different from a Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill. Since you've come out of seclusion, your immortal foundation must be complete. This is the perfect time to consume it."

"This…"

Li Ximing was momentarily stunned. He picked it up to inspect it, frowning.

"This is a wonderful item, but I wonder if it can be used together with the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill. They should be combined to help you break through to the Purple Mystery stage…"

Li Zhouwei shook his head with a smile. "If the situation allows, it would be best if the immortal threshold of Purple Mystery holds me back for a while. I need more time to plan. I have no use for these things. You should take it, Uncle. Your breakthrough is what truly matters."

"I have no hope of reaching Purple Mystery anymore!" Li Ximing sighed.

"I understand your meaning, but we must watch how the situation between the two sides develops. If they conspire to bring slaughter upon the lake, and you don't break through, people will surely die."

Li Zhouwei fell silent. He watched his uncle put the spiritual item away before continuing,

"We had already agreed on an exchange. I never expected that right after I returned to the lake, a certain Daoist Master Liaoluo from Mount Qusi would arrive. The Crane-Embrace Stone was in the clan treasury, so I took the Soul-Listening Purple Intent Qi and had him deliver the stone."

With a flip of his hand, he produced a lustrous pearl. It shimmered with a golden, glass-like radiance that carried a mesmerizing power. After letting Li Ximing have a good look, the young man grinned.

"Now this is a real treasure!"

"Hm?"

Li Ximing's eyebrows shot up in astonishment.

"Blazing Fire?"

As a master of fire control, Li Ximing’s face lit up with delight. He used his spiritual sense to examine the pearl, only speaking after a long moment.

"It looks like Radiant Crimson Fiendfire. It's a derivative of Blazing Fire that has lost its harmonious essence. It's born from Earth Fire Baleful Qi—a killing flame that seizes heat, making it an excellent spiritual fire for combat. It’s quite valuable… but the Buddhist cultivators have tampered with it, adding this dazzling, disorienting aura, which has ruined its purity."

He grew suspicious.

"Minghui gave this to you? He must want something!"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"First, there's the matter of your Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, Uncle. Second, he wants protection for his physical body when he heads south. But he doesn't seem honest. He’s still plotting something."

This prompted the Daoist to rise and pace around the mountain clearing. He couldn't bear to part with the spiritual fire in his hand.

"Nothing good comes for free," he said seriously.

"He definitely has an ulterior motive. This whole affair with the Crane-Embrace Stone might be part of his scheme."

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"The Lotus Temple has kept to itself for so many years; they must have a plan. I've already considered it. We can't keep the Radiant Crimson Fiendfire… I'll first try the Intercalary Sun Art on it. If that doesn't work, I'll have to find a fire-virtue cultivator or two to trade it with."

Li Ximing nodded in deep agreement. He channeled a wisp of his divine ability, pinching out a tiny glimmer of flame from it. Holding it on his fingertip, he performed a quick divination. After a moment, he shook his head with some hesitation.

"The Intercalary Sun Art is primarily based on the True Conjoined Triple Fire, while Radiant Crimson Fiendfire is a type of Blazing Fire. My divination… despite the interference from the Buddhist cultivator's aura, is probably accurate enough—it doesn't seem to be something that can be handled with mere spell arts…"

He retracted his divine ability, musing, "We could have asked Daoist Master Junjian about this. He cultivates fire-virtue and has many treasures, making him the most suitable person. But I've inquired several times; he's been seeking the Dao in the Feather-Shedding Land for years and hasn't returned south… Thinking about it now, he probably wants to avoid getting dragged into the mess in Yue State."

"Now that Guo Nanwu is here, we could ask him to inquire about Poluoduo's Spirit Sparrow, Huo Yang…"

Li Ximing hesitated, then shook his head. "It’s a pity… The Buddhist cultivators modified it with their strange arts, turning it into this bizarre hybrid. If we want to change it back, we'd have to pour more spiritual resources into it. The best course of action would be to negotiate and have them take it back to refine and purify it themselves."

While he was lost in thought, Li Zhouwei asked a sharp question.

"Guo Nanwu?"

Li Zhouwei frowned as he listened to Li Ximing explain the situation, the news causing the golden-eyed man to stand up and ponder for a long time.

"So that's why the Daoist Master from Mount Qusi was so enthusiastic…"

He finally looked up after a while, a smile playing on his lips.

"A good scheme. Quite audacious."

Li Ximing shook his head with a helpless expression as he heard Li Zhouwei continue with a laugh,

"Our family is bound to have advantages in the future. They, on the other hand, have lost the Supreme Yang Radiance and are in an awkward position. They need to survive this chaotic era. Their old master certainly has a keen eye, but they will have to remain conservative for these thirty years."

"Even if I, Li Zhouwei, die while failing to attain a higher station, my ambition will last longer than a mere thirty years."

"Do you think I don't know that?" Li Ximing replied. "Kuang Yu explained it to me long ago. Their old master doesn't have much time left. This alliance is mutually beneficial. My agreement with Guo Nanwu today was a matter of necessity for both sides… At the very least, it will save us a lot of trouble."

"As for the thirty years… it's just a probe to test the waters."

Li Zhouwei nodded discreetly, then smiled.

"That's perfect. I rushed back and haven't had time to go to Southern Songzhou Luoshe. If this person is trustworthy, we can have him handle it along the way."

Li Ximing's expression turned serious.

"There is also the matter of Qingyan… but while Mount Qusi may be trustworthy, Guo Nanwu isn't necessarily so. We have no influence in the Southern Sea and no way to watch over his clan. Besides… he is a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. If he decides to cast aside all face, he could escape and hide anywhere in the world. How would we ever find him again? Let's entrust him with small matters first, to test his character."

Seeing that Li Ximing had a clear plan, Li Zhouwei relaxed. But then Li Ximing shook his head.

"There is one thing that has been bothering me… Back when I cultivated a secret art, I was able to draw upon the revelations from the Spiritual Treasure, the Huai River Map, which was of great benefit… So today, when Jiangqian was cultivating, I brought over the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument."

A look of puzzlement crossed his face.

"But… the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument offered almost no assistance to his cultivation…"

Li Zhouwei had completed his own secret art cultivation in one go and had never considered the role of Spiritual Treasures. Now, however, his Dao-Profundity was considerable.

He thought for a moment and replied, "I have also seen that Spiritual Treasure. The Huai River Map is no ordinary item. It wasn't originally a top-grade treasure, but it bears the calligraphy of High Radiance True Monarch, which grants it its profound mystery…"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He feigned a grin through gritted teeth. 

"Sooner or later, I'm going to get my hands on that thing!"

Li Zhouwei laughed and shook his head before asking, "Have you looked into the matter of the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light, Uncle?"

"That is a priority. It cannot be forgotten!"

Li Ximing smiled.

"The Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light… the scrolls state that one must gather the 'Qi of Condescending Radiance.' This requires a place steeped in the aura of a clan's venerable authority or an emperor's might. It could be a place of noble defeat, where spears lie broken in the sand, or a Celestial Hall where a mandate was received to cleanse a deep-seated grudge. Then, ten thousand armored men must pay homage, and with the aid of the Bright Yang heavens, it would still take half a year to gather a single wisp."

This gave Li Zhouwei pause. He frowned. "It requires such an ordeal?"

Li Ximing's expression, however, was peculiar. "Not necessarily. I've used my divine ability to investigate and have sent men to each location. Here at our grand Moongaze Lake, there are no less than four mountains and Celestial Halls that qualify. Even… even the north shore has one."

Li Zhouwei nodded at once. "That makes sense… Moongaze Lake is drenched in a century of blood and tears. It has earned that right."

Li Ximing, lost in his thoughts, continued, "After weighing the options, I decided the imperial qi would be stronger than the others. The Grand Jue Court was the seat of generations of kings; it is nobler and more convenient than the other locations. So, I have begun gathering the qi there."

"By my calculations, it will take no more than three or four years."

Li Zhouwei was in no hurry. His cultivation speed was astonishingly fast, and he had only recently mastered Sovereign's Perilous Tread. Pushing too hard and forging one divine ability after another would be too much even for him. He simply nodded.

"Thank you for your trouble, Uncle."

A complex look appeared on Li Ximing’s face.

"Actually… the Meichi Mountain behind our ancestral land… that could also be used. But it was never a treasure ground, and its qi is somewhat stagnant. Gathering it there would likely not be smooth."

"That place… it is where Lord Tongya, the ancestor of the Second Branch… fell. It was my second uncle who received the mandate…"

This silenced Li Zhouwei for a moment.

"Minghuang has sworn to kill Can Lufu," he stated flatly.

"Ai!"

Ever since the breakthrough at Changxiao, Li Ximing's mind had been troubled. The matter of the Dragon-kin had frayed his nerves, and now this single sentence made him choke up with emotion.

"This… this situation, when will it end? It feels like we are thriving in a raging fire, yet there are gods watching from above, making things difficult at every turn. And you, my boy, you are burdened with thoughts of the Demon King in the Southern Borderlands…"

Li Zhouwei silently shook his head.

"Uncle… that's not the right way to see it. Even if I, Zhouwei, am swept up in the tides of the world, the grudges of our ancestors must be avenged! If I find myself powerless, I will face death with resolve. This vengeance will then be left for future generations to carry out."

His words seemed to comfort Li Ximing, who took them as a promise. He sighed softly, his expression even more melancholic. Shaking off the sentiment, he stood and put away the Soul-Listening Purple Intent Qi.

"I will go into meditation now. The success of my divine ability rests on this! I cannot afford to be complacent."

Li Zhouwei nodded and saw him off. Only then did he stand alone amidst a cascade of falling flower petals, a sudden silence enveloping him.

The golden-eyed young man clasped his hands behind his back and paced, his gaze turning to ice.

'In the past, I felt the my sons could not survive, so I refused them be entered into the clan registry. But now… I fear the entire clan could be annihilated in an instant!'

He gently extended a hand. His sleeves, embroidered with golden patterns, shimmered in the Heavenly Light as a few gardenia petals drifted into his palm.

'Uncle… there will be no future generations left to carry out this vengeance. I will kill Can Lufu because everything I bear, everything I hold to, must end with me. What I, Zhouwei, am fighting for is not the past, nor the present, nor for three or ten generations, but for a glory that will not fade for ten thousand generations.'

'It's been nearly two thousand years… The Bright Yang Dao is unstable, locked in a feud with the powers above. It's a Dao that Mount Luoxia has invested almost two millennia of effort into. It cannot tolerate another shred of instability.'

'I don't believe that Mount Luoxia and the Dragon-kin have no plans for Bright Yang. I don't believe the Dragon Palace and the powers above lack their own grand cultivators of the Bright Yang Dao. There is no turning back on this path. The father has fallen. If the son does not take his seat, someone else will. Even if they can't hold it securely, they will sit at its edge, waiting with ambition. Whether others can take the seat or not, as long as they still desire it, is there any hope of survival for the son?'

'After all…'

He murmured to himself with a self-deprecating smile, "As long as the throne is occupied, does it matter by whom?"

_Rustle…_

A gentle breeze swept through the mountains, carrying away the white flowers from his palm. The young man had already vanished, leaving only the swirling petals and the utter stillness of the immortal mountain under the Heavenly Light. Slowly, the great formation sealed itself, freezing everything in the past.

Within the mountains, the Heavenly Light was silent. But to the east, the clouds roiled without cease, coalescing into alternating forms of intertwined serpents, water, and fire. The glow of Merging Fire grew dimmer and dimmer, soon driven back to the north.




# Chapter 1032: The Dynasty is Named Song

## Simin Prefecture

The night was thick, but a faint, milky whiteness was already bleeding into the edges of the sky. In the pre-dawn gloom, the moon offered no light, leaving the stars to burn brightly, awaiting the rising sun.

The Celestial Hall's gates were sealed. Yellow brocade hung from the railings, and the green locks were etched with profound patterns that seemed to glow in the shadows. Soldiers clad in blue-black armor stood motionless before the steps. The entire palace was steeped in an unnerving silence, broken only by the occasional cry of a crane echoing between the roof beams.

A gentle breeze rustled the hanging brocade, stirring the air. Above the main entrance, a black plaque bore characters of gold that cast a burnished, yellow light into the darkness.

[Palace of Revering Martial Arts]

In the sky above, hundreds, even thousands, of white cranes circled the great hall in a unified, silent vortex. Their wings blotted out the stars. Now and then, one would drift down to land on a palace eave or beside the stairs, folding its wings and tucking in its legs to feign sleep.

Before the hall, banners like long serpents rippled in the wind. Courtyard paths, fashioned to look like intertwined serpents of water and fire, led inward. The vast, dark-red plaza was lit by lantern stands placed every ten paces, and between them knelt a multitude of cultivators. All were dressed in identical uniforms, their heads bowed to touch the ground, perfectly still.

A hundred yards out from the hall, a set of nine steps led down to a lower, broader terrace. Here knelt men and women, young and old, all clad in simple blue-black robes. They were arranged in corresponding positions to the cultivators above, yin facing yang, a mirror image of their elders. They were the descendants of the bloodlines.

Despite the thousands of cultivators kneeling in silent vigil, the palace remained profoundly quiet. As the first light of dawn began to creep up the walls of the Celestial Hall, it illuminated two figures standing near the highest point.

One was a man, his chest puffed out and his brow held high with a confident air. He wore green robes, a sealed scroll hanging from one side of his belt and a golden talisman from the other. He cradled a sword in his arms.

Facing him stood a woman dressed in a simple white robe. She held a wooden box decorated with blue-black profound patterns. Her expression was calm and serene, but the box in her arms trembled with an unnatural energy, as if something was trapped within. From time to time, jets of intertwined water and fire would erupt from it, only to slide harmlessly down her fair white arms, leaving not a single mark.

Nine steps higher, standing beside the main hall, was another man. He was tall and slender, with captivating golden eyes that made his handsome features all the more striking. He wore layers of white and patterned silk beneath a black, straight-collared robe accented with white designs. Crane feathers adorned his shoulders, making his posture seem exceptionally upright.

It was Li Jiangliang.

His expression was solemn and grave. He waited as the stars shimmered in their final moments before fading, but his patience was wearing thin. Finally, he could wait no longer. He bowed from the steps and spoke in a reverent tone.

“May Your Majesty ascend the throne, ride the transformation of water and fire, command the sign of the intertwined serpents, and rightly face the south. The people of the four seas will be endlessly fortunate.”

He waited for a moment. An official emerged from the side of the hall, listened for instructions from within, and then announced respectfully, “Lord Li, you may enter.”

A flicker of surprise crossed Li Jiangliang’s face. He offered a bow and entered through a side hall.

Inside, a flight of eighteen steps, each a deep, foreboding red, led upward. A waterfall of purple energy cascaded down, carrying with it a refreshing and profound sensation.

At the top of the stairs was a side door, black with golden patterns. Pushing it open, Li Jiangliang was met with the thick, cloying scent of sandalwood. The chamber was filled with a dense fog of incense, and through the haze, he could make out several white figures.

They were women—naked, hairless, their bodies perfectly smooth. Their faces were round and their skin was pale. Some held treasured robes of blue-gold, others held blue-black sashes. They stood or knelt in various poses, as motionless as statues.

The women were arranged in a staggered formation at varying heights. Behind the main immortal seat, carvings of dragons and phoenixes adorned the wall, flanked by paintings of two Flood Dragons whose bodies stretched out like giant pythons.

Beside the seat stood a young man in a simple white robe, his long hair unbound, his back turned to the entrance.

Li Jiangliang dared not raise his eyes. He took a step back and knelt at the threshold.

“Your Majesty’s benevolence embraces all living things, and your Dao illuminates the world,” he intoned, his voice trembling slightly. “This servant’s mortal body is filthy and unworthy. I dare not ascend to the Feng Wu Immortal Hall. I can only prostrate myself before the steps and await the immortal command.”

His voice echoed in the hall. A clear, cold voice, like ice, answered from above.

“Enter.”

Li Jiangliang had no choice but to rise and cross the threshold. The moment his foot touched the floor, he felt a sharp crunching sound. Beneath a layer of white qi, the entire floor was covered in a crystalline layer of crystallized brine mixed with frost.

Suppressing his shock, Li Jiangliang walked slowly forward until he was ten paces from the man. He stopped just before the statue-like women and bowed again.

“This servant is here.”

The man on the dais turned and descended the steps. With his movement, a purple mist materialized and white frost condensed in the air. His face was defined by short eyes, dark pupils, and exquisitely shaped brows. He fixed his gaze on Li Jiangliang.

“You there.”

Li Jiangliang, after a brief apology, immediately took the blue-black inner robe from one of the women’s hands and draped it over him. Yang Zhuo watched him silently, then spoke.

“Years ago, when We were traveling, We intervened on behalf of a few minor cultivators whose provisions had been stolen. It was then that We met you on your journey south, and so our friendship began… Thinking back on it now, it all seems so vivid.”

He smiled faintly, raising an eyebrow. “Did you ever suspect… that any of it was part of a larger plan?”

At the mention of this, Li Jiangliang lowered his gaze. “Your Majesty… this servant saw no plan. I saw only a chance to entrust my life’s ambition to a worthy cause—a chance to rise above the petty squabbles of my clan and gain the power to save the common people. That was enough for me.”

“Save the common people…”

Yang Zhuo stared at him, his lips moving slightly as if to say more, but he held his tongue. His expression became unreadable. “You have been my companion since childhood and are wed to my sister. You stand above all other officials. You deserve a share of the credit for today’s victory.”

Li Jiangliang would not dare accept such praise. He bowed deeply. “Your Majesty is the lord of ten thousand chariots, your rule mandated by Heaven. Your destiny is fixed. It is not something this servant can claim credit for. I can only serve before the throne and obey your every command.”

Yang Zhuo continued to stare at him. “That is not true. Without you, the Great Song today would have far fewer citizens and far more useless officials lining their own pockets. Though We became Emperor without achieving the Golden Core, Our power is nonetheless immense. You deserve to share in this glory.”

“I am bathed in Your Majesty’s grace.”

Yang Zhuo’s gaze shifted. “Among the kings, King Wei is the most esteemed. He contended for the fortune of the north and south and pacified the sects of the Huai River region. The various heirs must be rewarded. Which emissary should We send for his enfeoffment today?”

Li Jiangliang, now holding a white silk inner garment with a black collar and blue trim, began to dress him. “To avoid any appearance of favoritism, this servant dares not answer.”

Yang Zhuo glanced at him. “It would be awkward for you to go. We shall send Daoist Master Ning instead.”

Li Jiangliang simply assented and added the next layer of ceremonial robes. He listened as the man, a reincarnation of True Qi and a figure of unimaginable nobility, spoke again.

“In the Lixia region, when the poison of the Way of Great Desire was rampant, it was Our command that not a single person be killed. The cultivators all followed this order. Only you advised me not to let the remnants of that path flow into the prefecture. The loyal and the disloyal—the difference is clear.”

Li Jiangliang hesitated for a moment. Instead of reaching for the next sash, he knelt on the floor and said in a low voice, “This servant is ignorant and does not understand. Since Your Majesty has the power to cleanse all corruption, why not use your divine ability to resolve the situation at once? Why not eliminate the karmic evil of the Golden Lotus, rather than allowing its followers to enter the prefecture? I fear that in the future, a heretical cult will rise again in Lixia, and it will take a hundred years to restore peace.”

Yang Zhuo’s eyes were fixed on him.

“What is changed is changed. The karmic evil of the Golden Lotus now resides within them. It is as if they have been reading those scriptures for years. Even if the influence of the Great Desire recedes, their minds have still been corrupted. If a man sees a ghost, even if We command the ghost to leave, We cannot restore his mind to a state of never having seen it—not unless We were to tamper with his very soul.”

He continued, “True faith must come from the heart. If others wish to believe in the Buddhists, and you use your divine power to change their minds, you are no different from the Buddhist cultivators themselves.”

“To change the world with one’s own heart is the Dao of the Wei Emperor and the Sheji, not the way of Tianwu. When the Way of Great Desire poisoned them, the people of Lixia had no freedom not to believe. Now, under Our rule, they will have the freedom not to believe in me. Since the Way of Great Desire is gone, We want them to choose for themselves.”

Li Jiangliang could only lower his head. “This servant was reckless.”

He remained kneeling and picked up a pair of white jade boots with profound patterns. As Yang Zhuo lifted his foot, he said, “With the new dynasty established, your father holds the north, but Jiaozhi cannot be neglected. We must appoint a protector-general. Since Liu Bai is in the Purple Mansion Realm and holds the Chu State military tally, you will go to Jiaozhi and deliver the order for him to assume command.”

“As for the name of the protectorate…”

He paused. Li Jiangliang spoke respectfully, “We have discussed it. Since Jiaozhi overlooks Shitang and is responsible for pacifying the sea, under the Song dynasty, it could be called ‘Jinghai’—Pacifying the Sea.”

The words made Yang Zhuo’s pupils constrict slightly. He frowned. “Ignorant… The character ‘Jing’ for pacify is not good. It violates the naming taboo of a revered one. Replace it with the character for ‘quiet.’ Suppress it with tranquility, and it shall be settled and eternally peaceful. We shall call it the ‘Jinghai Protectorate’—the Protectorate of the Tranquil Sea.”

“Yes!”

Li Jiangliang dared not ask which revered one’s taboo had been broken. He quickly agreed, kneeling firmly as he raised the imperial crown—round in the front, square in the back, with twelve tassels of five colors—and bowed his head as low as it would go.

He was, of course, not qualified to place the crown upon Yang Zhuo’s head.

But the man about to be enthroned as the Song Emperor held the crown without moving, staring at it.

“The imperial mandate… originated with the Wei,” he said coldly.

“This crown is a copy of theirs. Round in the front and square in the back to represent the pivot of Heaven and Earth, the ultimate Yang. Twelve tassels of five colors to represent the five virtues and twelve forms of qi. The Qi and Liang dynasties were mere imitators. One claimed ‘Dawn Qi,’ the other ‘Profound Qi,’ yet each was but a single strand of the twelve, and still they wore this crown.”

“Now, ‘True Qi’ has attained the Dao. Why, then, are we still copying the Wei system?”

A chill went through Li Jiangliang’s heart.

This coronation ceremony was not his own invention; he had coordinated every detail with Yang Tianyou, and the plans could be traced all the way back to Yang Ruiyi. Yang Zhuo’s question was not necessarily aimed at him.

But even if it wasn’t, he still had to answer.

“Replying to Your Majesty, the Imperial Monarch was above worldly affairs and ruled through inaction. Though Ning followed Wei's calendar, it was established by all houses, That is why the five-colored, twelve-tasseled crown was used. Now that True Qi has been re-established, it is proper to follow the old system.”

“Imperial Monarch,” Yang Zhuo repeated, raising an eyebrow.

“Cultivators value the word ‘True.’ We seize the fortune of Heaven and Earth and take it as our truth. The Tianwu became an emperor by achieving Truth, not the other way around. Is that why He was often called a True Monarch? Is the matter of an imperial mandate not… superfluous?”

Cold sweat began to bead on Li Jiangliang’s brow. He could only say, “It is for the peace of the world!”

“Hahahahaha!”

Yang Zhuo placed the crown on his own head. Li Jiangliang fell prostrate beside him, feeling an immense wave of cloudy qi emanate from the new emperor as he strode forward from the white mist.

The Song Emperor paused at the doors of the hall. Placing a hand on the massive gate, he spoke, his voice calm. “You all call him the Imperial Monarch, but you don’t realize he sought Truth, not an empire. His talk of ‘curbing indulgence with righteous nature’ was the work of his predecessors. His ‘infinite benevolence’… who knows who it was for, but it certainly wasn’t for the common people. If the people had mattered more to him than his search for Truth, would he have ever left this world?”

Li Jiangliang did not know how to respond. He could only watch as the emperor strode out of the hall. A roar of acclamation rose from outside, and the air roiled with water and fire. The sky was a vibrant, shimmering canvas of teal and indigo, filled with countless streams of profound light.

Countless multi-colored serpents dropped from the sky, slithering and climbing up the pristine white steps. The purple mist before Li Jiangliang’s eyes grew thicker, and he felt the cold, slick bodies of snakes coiling around his arms, slithering past him from all directions.

Strangely, he felt no joy in his heart, only a profound sense of confusion and a bizarre feeling of disbelief.

Was this cold, calculating emperor truly the same heroic warrior with whom he had shared wine and conversation while escorting that convoy south all those years ago?

‘If pacifying the Yue State and founding a dynasty was never your goal back then, how did such a grand situation come to be? The Yang Zhuo of the past would never have said such things… Your Majesty… what is your ultimate goal?’

Outside, the ceremonial bells and cauldrons chimed in unison. An official chanted the rites, seemingly bestowing honors. Li Jiangliang could faintly hear the words as he knelt in the hall. The white mist around him was rapidly dissipating, revealing the female forms, still frozen in their poses.

Their bodies had already petrified into a jade-like substance, an immaculate stone, yet their skin still held a pinkish, lifelike luster and gave off a faint scent of peaches. Their eyes were bright and seemed to be on the verge of movement.

He rose slightly, his head still bowed toward the emperor, and naturally slipped out a side exit to kneel outside.

Dong!

A profound bell toll echoed. As the officials kowtowed, thousands of white cranes descended from the sky. They soared over the heads of the kneeling cultivators, their wings beating the air, and landed on the lower terrace among the tens of thousands of descendants.

The cranes were enormous, and they brought with them a gale of wind and roiling currents of water and fire. Yet the kneeling men and women seemed not to notice as the great birds landed, one by one, on the lantern posts beside them.

Dong!

With another kowtow, the massive cranes standing among the crowd lifted one leg. As the bells and cauldrons sounded, they spread their vast wings, covering the men and women on either side of them. The fit was perfect, seamless, until the entire lower terrace was nothing but an endless sea of white.

This white merged with the white of the sky, momentarily dazzling Li Jiangliang and forcing him to lower his head again.

“The Mandate of Heaven has descended upon the martial cultivators. A nation was won between the rivers to quell chaos and aid the people, enduring for many years… When the age of the Tianwu passed, the world nearly fell into ruin… This year, water and fire were overturned, and destiny came to rest in my body. Following the immortal decree, We shall cultivate the martial path once more… Entrusted by the myriad people, We establish a nation and ennoble its lords, fulfilling the hopes of every house, founding a state, and ruling as Emperor…”

The magnificent, immortal voice resounded through the air as endless streams of water and fire roiled across the heavens. Yang Zhuo took a step forward.

“The dynasty shall be named Song,” he declared, his voice calm and clear.

Dong!

Li Jiangliang looked up again. It was the darkest hour before dawn. The moon was gone, the sun not yet risen, but a single star, bright as the sun itself, suddenly blazed forth, illuminating the world like a divine eye of the profound heavens gazing down upon the earth.

The light was blinding, yet it brought tears to Li Jiangliang’s eyes.

The Martial Cultivation Star was shining!

Om…

In an instant, Heaven and Earth were filled with light. A tremor ran through the Great Void. Intertwined currents of water and fire swept across the world. Throughout Jiangnan, every cultivator looked up at the sky, their faces pale with shock and fear.

‘The celestial phenomena have changed!’

In the Great Void, the reaction was even more pronounced. Streaks of light appeared in the silent, empty darkness. Powerful beings performed divinations with their fingers or sank into deep thought, their brows furrowed in silence.

‘The spiritual aura has shifted…’

But below, in the palace, there was only awe and trepidation. Even the Daoist Masters waiting before the hall had their heads bowed in silence. Suddenly, a clear voice rang out from the side, filled with reverence and solemnity.

“The Ning Clan…”

“...presents to Your Majesty a pair of dragon tendons!”




# Chapter 1033: Becoming Immortal

The spring breeze swept across Moongaze Lake, carrying with it the fresh scent of rain. A young man in white robes, a sword hanging from his waist, descended with the wind, a pensive look on his face.

‘Spring has returned,’ he thought. ‘By my calculations, it’s time I went to see my younger uncle.’

Time had flown by. Li Suining was now at the fifth level of Qi Refining, his ability to ride the wind and manipulate light drawing envious stares from those around him.

‘At this time in my past life… I was still in seclusion, struggling just to reach Qi Refining!’

On the surface, Li Suining was a student pursuing the Dao. In reality, he was unlike any other member of the Li Clan’s direct line. He paid no attention to array Daos, esoteric lore, secret methods, or movement techniques. For years, he had focused on only one thing—cultivation.

There was no need for anything else. He had already mastered those subjects in his previous life. As a former Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator and one of the last pillars of the Li Clan, his Dao-Profundity surpassed that of almost everyone on the lake.

His cultivation progress was even more terrifying. With the experience of his past life, he advanced at an astonishing rate. He was now just a step away from the sixth level of Qi Refining, the Illusory Core within him growing brighter with each passing day, eagerly anticipating the formation of his Immortal Foundation.

Having reached the Foundation Establishment Realm with the Li Clan in his past life, he knew well that once he crossed the next two hurdles and reached the seventh level of Qi Refining, the clan's spiritual pills and wondrous medicines could propel him straight to the ninth, right to the threshold of the next realm.

‘I’m only twenty this year. If I take that step, I could very well reach the ninth level of Qi Refining around the age of twenty-two… That’s far too conspicuous!’

The clan's two Daoist Masters were one thing, but King Wei was in a league of his own. A Foundation Establishment cultivator in his early twenties was a rarity seen only once in many years. Daoist Master Zhaojing had reached the realm at thirty-two or thirty-three, which meant he would have been at the ninth level of Qi Refining around twenty-eight or twenty-nine.

And so, Li Suining decided to rein himself in. He would linger at the sixth level for a while, using the time to reconnect with certain figures on the lake, leveraging his memories to forge relationships ahead of time.

Lost in thought, Li Suining suddenly halted mid-flight. He looked into the distance and saw a man in a conical straw hat rowing a small boat through the spring rain.

He took one look, and his expression grew complicated.

‘So… So Fifth Grand-Uncle is here.’

Since his rebirth, Li Suining had actually seen Li Zhouming once before, during the entrance ceremony for the island. Li Zhouming had made a brief appearance, but his restless nature got the better of him, and he left after hearing only the opening words.

Li Suining had been preoccupied with finding a cultivation manual. Later, he met with Li Jiangchun, but by then, Li Xuanxuan had sent Li Zhouming into seclusion as punishment for watching plays all night, so they missed the chance to meet properly.

After returning to the mountains, he found that the Daoist Master was consuming a spiritual treasure. He should have been diligently cultivating on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, but he waited and waited for Li Ximing, only to run into King Wei several times instead. The delay had lasted until today.

He never would have guessed that Li Zhouwei had also sent Li Ximing into seclusion. He simply assumed that the movements of Daoist Masters were unpredictable. In any case, with the dense spiritual energy on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, his cultivation hadn't been hindered in the slightest.

Anxiety fluttered in his chest as he flew closer through the rain. He saw the so-called Fifth Young Master wielding a crudely whittled stick, apparently trying to spear fish. The man noticed him, raised an eyebrow, and grinned.

"What a handsome young man!"

‘…This…’

‘Is this really Fifth Grand-Uncle?’

Li Suining knew his grand-uncle had a history of scandalous behavior in his youth, so much so that he had once spoken ill of his own ancestor, Li Xixuan. But in his previous life, Suining had very little interaction with him on the lake. Seeing this dignified Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator spearfishing was utterly bizarre.

"This junior is Suining…" he said.

"Heh."

The man lifted his wooden stick, seeming to study Suining's expression. He plucked a fish from its tip and laughed. "As if I wouldn't know! Come on in, have a seat!"

Li Suining looked at his noble air and playful smile. How could this be the same man as the pale, immortal-foundation-damaged Family Head from his past life? Still, accustomed to obeying his orders, he instinctively landed on the boat.

Li Zhouming swept aside the curtain, and a wave of warm air rushed out. Inside, a copper stove burned with red-hot coals. A young woman sat within, holding a pipa, her head bowed in waiting.

"This…"

Startled, Li Suining pulled back the foot he was about to step inside with and stared blankly at Li Zhouming.

Li Zhouming’s expression was wistful as he shook his head. "She comes from a humble background, displaced and homeless. I happened to run into her. It's a chilly spring, so I'm letting her warm up."

"..."

Li Suining wanted to speak but stopped himself.

‘That’s a bit hard to believe… Grand-Uncle.’

Li Zhouming, however, seemed completely oblivious. He hung the fish on a hook, turned back, and grinned.

"Don't mind her. She's a poor child; she wouldn't know how to play something so elegant. She came aboard empty-handed, and I'm a vain man who likes to feign culture, so I had her hold a pipa for decoration."

Li Suining didn't know what to say. His throat felt dry. He watched the man for a moment before taking a seat at the edge of the cabin. As Li Zhouming poured wine, his mind drifted.

The last time he had drunk wine, it had been with Li Zhouda. That grand-uncle of his had been a man of fiery temperament and cruel methods, with the blood of countless people on his hands. When Wang Quwan led his army south to battle the Song, Li Suining had held a farewell toast for him, watching as he marched off with heroic resolve, only to fall in battle on the northern bank.

_Gurgle…_

The clear, fragrant wine was poured. Li Zhouming raised the cup to his own lips, took a sip, and then poured a cup for Suining. Li Suining watched silently as Li Zhouming let out a soft, slightly sheepish laugh.

"It's a good thing I ran into you today. Anyone else… I couldn't be bothered… It's just… just…"

He refilled the cup. "Let's make sure our Lady Xia doesn't find out about this…"

Only then did Li Suining recall that his grand-uncle was henpecked. On the lake, Li Zhouming could never win an argument against his wife. Things were different in the Southern Borderlands, where Xia Shouyu had softened into a capable and supportive partner. But by then, no one was in the mood to joke with her anymore, and those peaceful times hadn't lasted long.

Li Zhouming just looked at him, smiling. "I've met your younger brother. He's incredibly clever. His great-grandfather… that Li Chengzai, doesn't understand a thing. I dislike him immensely, so I can only make things difficult for the boy!"

The man’s words were sharp. Li Suining was taken aback and quickly replied, "The East Residence has its faults, and the elders may be foolish… but you can't blame the younger generation…"

He couldn't bear the thought of Li Suikuan suffering. In his past life, his brother had been plagued by melancholy because of their ancestors’ deeds. He would not see that happen again. He gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, 

"The matters of the East Residence's ancestors are not my brother's burden alone…"

Li Zhouming continued to watch him quietly, a smile playing on his lips as he drank, his gaze never wavering.

"I said I'd make things difficult for him, not that I'd torment him. You're far too protective."

It was then that Li Suining had a sudden epiphany. He was accustomed to the decisive and ruthless Li Zhouming of his past life, the one who suppressed rebellions with an iron fist. He had forgotten that the man before him was, at this moment, nothing more than a profligate dandy on the lake. Even if he were displeased, why would he waste his time tormenting a junior?

The delayed realization brought a wry, relieved smile to his lips. He apologized profusely, but Li Zhouming just laughed and praised him, though a hint of confusion lingered in his eyes as he joked,

"Some people on the lake are afraid of me, but you're the first in the direct line… What's there to fear about a useless person like me!"

Just as Li Suining was about to say more, his vision filled with a blinding golden light. Dizziness washed over him. His True Qi churned violently, he felt the faint trickle of blood in his nose, and the Illusory Core in his sea of qi bobbed up and down, resonating with some unseen force.

Li Zhouming was already on his feet and out of the cabin. Forcing down his discomfort, Li Suining stumbled out after him and looked up at the sky.

In the middle of the heavens, a brilliant radiance bloomed as a dazzling star suddenly rose!

‘The Martial Cultivation Star… The Song Emperor has ascended the throne! That’s right, it was around this time. But I was in seclusion back then, and my cultivation method wasn't so sensitive to the Great Void…’

That familiar sense of powerlessness, as if being watched by gods and immortals, surged through him, making him clench his jaw. He had replayed this scene in his mind a thousand times over the years, never able to forget the events that followed.

‘Can the Great Song be trusted? The alliance between the Li and Yang clans, how much friendship is truly there?’

Yang Zhuo and the Yang Clan cannot be equated. Yang Zhuo was merely Yang Zhuo of the Yang Clan, never rising above equal status even in the end. The Li Clan, however, _was_ King Wei's Li Clan. Any alliance or conflict between the two clans was ultimately a matter between the Yang Clan and King Wei.

‘The Underworld is using my family, and they could just as well be using Yang Zhuo. With the immortal methods of that entity in the Underworld, even if a True Monarch Tianwu were to appear, it would be difficult to escape His grasp. But to the Underworld, Yang Zhuo is more reliable than King Wei, no matter how you look at it.’

And that was why, even after the Li Clan was defeated and had retreated to the Southern Borderlands, even after Li Zhouming fell in battle and was transformed by the Pristine Water, Yang Zhuo remained the emperor. Right up to the day Li Suining himself died, he never learned the final fate of that emperor and his virtuous crown prince.

One thing was certain: the relationship between the Great Song Emperor and King Wei was poor, even cold. Publicly, there were countless rewards and titles bestowed, but the two sovereigns met only a handful of times.

‘The Great Song… for my family, it is both a pillar of support and a chain…’

He could only take a shallow breath, turning his gaze toward the lake surface to mask the storm of emotions within him.

"The Era of Conquest, Peace, and Martial Glory... is upon us."

---

Towering mountains pierced the heavens, wreathed in light clouds and flowing streams of purple qi. Palaces and pavilions rose in tiers among them.

At the highest point, the Purple Terrace glowed with a brilliant, golden light. A waterfall of purple qi swirled and coalesced, forming the figure of a woman in purple robes.

She appeared young, as if she had only recently achieved her divine ability. Her gaze, fixed on the horizon, was filled with anxiety. After a moment of hesitation, she thought:

‘The moon sets and the sun rises. The moment just before the dawn.’

She stared intently, the reflection of a tiny point of white light in the sky captured in her pupils. After a long silence and much deliberation, she finally drew a purple talisman from her sleeve. Holding it between two fingers, she waved it gently and stepped into a world of purple light.

This Blessed Land's Mystic Realm was saturated with a dense, boundless purple mist. Within the haze, there was only a jade throne and a small platform. As the Daoist Master took two steps forward, a figure in autumn-yellow robes was revealed.

It was a woman, kneeling in the purple qi. She had delicate green markings at the corners of her eyes, and her beautiful face was tinged with weariness. Her hands were clasped before her chest as she silently circulated a divine ability.

It was Daoist Master Tinglan.

Hearing the footsteps, the woman turned her head slightly.

"Wenqing?" she asked.

The purple-robed Daoist Master knelt beside her, positioning herself a respectful step behind.

"A bright star in daylight, a shift in the spiritual aura," she said in a low voice.

"According to the ancient texts, this is the Vast Profound Suspended Void… That star… must be the Martial Cultivation Star."

Daoist Master Tinglan was silent for a moment before she let out two soft coughs, a faint flush rising to her cheeks.

"It's not surprising, but it shows their impatience!"

Daoist Master Wenqing lowered her head, her voice laced with growing unease.

"I wonder… I wonder where the Great Daoist Master is… In this situation, we truly need a—"

Before she could finish, Tinglan shook her head, cutting her off. She covered her lips with her hand and swallowed a pill, causing puffs of white mist to swirl around her.

"Behind this Immortal Throne, there's an inscription from the Patriarch. Do you know of it?"

Wenqing paused, then nodded. Tinglan’s voice was hauntingly soft as she recited: 

"‘Cultivate the truth to attain immortality, be neither impatient nor boastful, seek the ultimate state of Purple Qi, and sleep embracing the Valley Water.’"

Wenqing looked up as a pale smile touched Tinglan's lips. "After returning from the north… I finally understood, and now it's clearer than ever. The so-called 'Cultivate the truth to attain immortality'—this 'truth' doesn't refer to the truth of the Dao, but to True Qi. And 'attaining immortality' isn't about reaching the Golden Throne, but about attaining the Immortal Origin—it refers to our Dao's 'Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence'."

She coughed again and looked up. "Only after mastering the 'Tianwu True Qi' is the path to 'Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi' opened… Martial Uncle… Martial Uncle is sleeping, embracing the Valley Water, just waiting for that day…"

Wenqing stared at her, dumbfounded, as Tinglan lowered her gaze.

"Therefore, be not impatient… therefore, be not boastful!"

A sliver of hope died in Wenqing’s heart.

"Then what do we…" she managed to ask.

Tinglan was already standing.

"According to the Daoist treatises of the various sects," she said faintly, "the two Qis of Tianxiu (Heavenly Cultivation) and Tianwu (Heavenly Martial) should revere the 'Taihua Classic'. The Classic says: 'Tianwu balances yin and yang on the left, Tianxiu governs light and dark on the right.' It not only balances yin and yang but also exists within them. When the two stand together, Tianxiu is yin, and Tianwu is yang."

She turned her gaze to the younger Daoist Master and coughed.

"It's unavoidable. Tianxiu and Tianwu are closely related. True Qi favors my cultivation. Now that Tianwu is ascendant in the world, holding the position of honor, our Purple Smoke Blessed Land can no longer afford to be ignorant of the times."

Wenqing’s eyes shot up in alarm, the gravity of the situation finally dawning on her. She rose from the ground, her brow furrowed.

"How can this be!"

"We've already surrendered all of Jiangnan. Isn't… isn't that enough? Must we dissolve the sect and submit to the Yang Clan's authority? How is that any different from the sect's destruction!"

With such a grave matter at stake, the purple-robed Daoist Master could listen no more. A look of grim resolve settled on her face.

"Our Dao is the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition! Even if we are to be destroyed, it must be with the sect's gates shattered and its Daoist Masters dead! We will never disgrace our ancestors!"

Putting aside the fact that the Purple Smoke Gate was controlled by the Kan and Wen families, the pride of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition—its ancient lineages, its sacred arts, its numerous disciples—would never allow Daoist Master Wenqing to yield.

But Tinglan shook her head, her tone placating. "‘True Qi’ is not ‘Bright Yang.’ It has no reason to drag you out from the mountains to demand loyalty and filial piety. Besides, the 'Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence' is a free and unfettered within the Immortal Dao. Our Purple Smoke Gate itself is a symbol of good fortune. They want an immortal sect; they won't have us destroyed."

"Tianwu and Tianxiu are kin; they won't destroy us without reason. It will just be a matter of opening our gates and respecting the Monarch's decree. The Tianwu are extremely tolerant of the Immortal Dao. Have you not seen the Wanling Upper Sect?"

Wenqing slowly let out a breath of relief, though she still looked utterly lost. Tinglan’s gaze, however, was filled with a hollow coldness.

‘And with this… the dignity of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is preserved?’

Wenqing knew it as well. She closed her eyes tightly and knelt on the ground for a long time, murmuring,

"My… my Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition… We gave them Jiangnan… and it still wasn't enough. Now they demand our submission."

Tinglan shook her head, her voice low and her gaze growing colder. She helped Wenqing to her feet.

"One Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition after another… Haven't you heard? The Supreme Yang Radiance is no more. Everything is achieved through submission. The Sima Clan, the Li Clan, the Chen Clan… none of them ever thought anything of it. In fact, they were ecstatic for the chance to submit…"

"Ultimately, you've all been standing on high for too long, fond of distributing spiritual resources to display the nobility of the Supreme Yang. You've forgotten how to bend your knees."

A faint flush crossed the face of the woman in autumn-yellow robes. She stabilized the divine ability within her body and said quietly,

"He knelt to me last year; this year, I bow to him in return. Even one as noble as the son of a True Hornless Dragon can be slain by the Profound Snare! If even a True Monarch cannot escape his fate, what is there to resent about being spared from death today, with our whole sect granted amnesty?!"

# Chapter 1034: King Wei

The landscape was breathtaking, with vibrant clouds drifting lazily across the sky.

Figures milled about on the high platform between the islands. A Daoist Master sat in the main seat, while the cultivators of the Li Clan stood in their designated places, dressed in formal, ornate robes. They had shed their usual long gowns with water and moon patterns at the cuffs, put away their weapons, and unfastened the jade talismans from their waists.

In the distance, celestial clouds gathered and swelled, and a speck of golden light emerged, racing toward them. Li Suining focused his gaze. At the forefront of the procession were two jade horses, each carrying a man in golden armor. A long banner, inscribed with profound patterns, was strapped to each rider's back. In their hands, they held black flags embroidered with the character for 'Song' in white thread.

Trailing them were more than a dozen grand conveyances of golden light and profound jade, exuding an air of majestic power. Triple-eaved parasols of azure and white shielded them, while crimson banners trimmed in black fluttered in the wind. A retinue holding various ceremonial weapons—banners, parasols, halberds, and spears—flanked the procession, shimmering with multicolored light that represented the elements of wind, rain, thunder, lightning, water, fire, wood, and earth.

Li Suining lowered his gaze slightly and noticed Li Zhouda, who stood one position ahead of him, scowling. The burly man was clearly uncomfortable in the restrictive formal wear, which barely covered the bronze bell at his waist. He muttered under his breath, "What a grand display."

Li Suining knew Li Zhouda's fiery temper well. He didn't think much of the Song Emperor, and he certainly didn't believe some outsider had the right to bestow a kingship upon one of their own. This wasn't just an internal sentiment; in his past life, Li Zhouda had voiced it openly in private. Today, his displeasure with the ostentatious arrival was plain to see.

Fortunately, there were those present who could keep him in check. A single glare from Li Xuanxuan was enough to make the hot-headed man fall silent. Li Suining then turned his attention to the other side.

Li Zhouming stood further ahead, already some distance away. He was tilting his head back, gazing at the sky with a drowsy expression. He only seemed to snap out of his stupor when the lifelike jade horses reached the platform and a beauty in white disembarked from one of the carriages. His eyes immediately followed her, stealing glances.

'Daoist Master Ning…'

Li Suining quickly lowered his head. Li Xuanxuan had already stepped forward, even before Li Zhouwei, to greet the envoy.

"Greetings, Your Excellency!" he said respectfully.

The old man’s demeanor was as deferential as it had been a century ago when the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner had descended, and its aloof, green-robed messenger had appeared.

But as Li Xuanxuan spoke, a storm of complex emotions churned within Li Suining. He peeked around, observing the reactions. His younger uncle, Li Jiangchun, had turned his face toward the island’s edge. The disciples around him wore varied expressions. Li Minggong maintained a polite, accompanying smile, while Li Zhouming’s smile had faded. Li Zhouda didn't even look up, staring at the ground as if trying to bore a hole through it.

Ning Wan, her own expression complicated, accepted a shimmering white Immortal Edict from an attendant. She held it with both hands but didn't unroll it. Instead, she bowed her head slightly and presented it to Li Zhouwei, who had stepped forward to receive it.

"By the Mandate of the True Emperor," she began, her voice soft, "in recognition of the Li Clan of a former age, a celestial branch of the Bright Yang, a noble line that has endured hardship... Minghuang has defended Jianghuai and Ting Province, serving as a pillar of strength... It is fitting he be granted land and title to establish his house. Thus, we hereby enfeoff you as King Wei, with the authority to command campaigns beyond the borders..."

Her elegant brow furrowed, and her heart pounded in her chest. After a long moment, she saw the young man before her give a customary bow in acceptance.

"I have long served in the remote frontiers and am humbled by this immense grace," he replied. "Though I may find it difficult to repay such an honor, I vow to serve with unwavering loyalty and diligence."

His voice was calm yet powerful, resonating across the entire platform. In an instant, a wave of motion swept through the crowd as everyone dropped to their knees—the Song soldiers who had arrived on celestial light and the members of the Li Clan alike. In unison, they proclaimed: "We pay our respects to King Wei!"

The cry echoed to the heavens. A faint light flared within the golden pupils beneath Li Zhouwei's brows. The brilliance of his aura roiled, and his presence fluctuated wildly, as if some immense divine ability within him was being suppressed, yet still fighting to break free.

Li Zhouwei merely stood there, but Ning Wan felt the Immortal Edict in her hands suddenly grow dim and incredibly heavy, nearly slipping from her grasp. She instinctively channeled her own divine ability to hold it.

_Crack!_

The rollers at either end of the edict emitted a strained, cracking sound, threatening to shatter at any moment. The light flowing from it became searing hot, burning a patch of Bright Yang purple fire onto her fair skin. A sharp, piercing cicada-like drone erupted to her right.

"Hm?"

The flame and the sound vanished as quickly as they had appeared, a fleeting illusion before her eyes and ears. The moment Li Zhouwei took the edict from her, all the strange phenomena ceased. The scroll was merely a bit dimmer than before.

Once in the new King Wei's hands, the Immortal Edict seemed to gain some form of acknowledgment. It began to pulse once more with the brilliance of True Qi, lying placidly in his grasp.

'But how can someone in the Purple Mansion Realm experience hallucinations?' Ning Wan suppressed her shock and avoided looking too closely. Flustered, she turned to help Li Xuanxuan up, an awkward gesture to cover her unease. Glancing at Li Zhouwei, she said in a low voice, "There is no need for further ceremony. Please, let us speak inside..."

Li Zhouwei turned slightly to the side. "After you."

Ning Wan signaled to her retinue. Celestial luan birds descended one after another, landing softly on the platform. She dismissed her attendants and followed Li Zhouwei toward the rear hall, a wistful look on her face.

The Ning Wan of today was different from the woman who had emerged from seclusion years ago—cold as autumn, pure as snow, and seemingly untouched by the world. Years spent aiding a tyrant and walking the line between life and death had added a touch of melancholy to her aura. Yet, with her dark brows gently knitted, she was still a breathtaking beauty.

Li Zhouwei gestured for her to take a seat and said softly, "Congratulations, Senior."

Ning Wan couldn't decipher the full meaning behind his congratulations. She could only let out a faint sigh. "You are too kind, King Wei."

Li Zhouwei set down his cup. "And how should I address the envoy?"

Ning Wan’s expression turned serious. "I am no envoy. I am merely the Sect Master of Azure Pond Sect and a Daoist Master of the Song's Bureau of Immortal Rites."

She paused, then retrieved a command token from her sleeve. One side was engraved with the character for 'Song,' the other with 'Azure Pond,' both glowing with True Qi.

"The Emperor values the Immortal Dao above all. The Azure Pond Sect is still permitted to practice its teachings and cultivate in the mountains... I am both the Sect Master of Azure Pond and a Daoist Master in the Bureau of Immortal Rites. The two roles do not conflict."

She tilted her head. "Please have Chen Wenyao come forward."

A moment later, a young man entered the hall carrying a tray. He knelt at the threshold before proceeding forward on his knees, stopping before the two of them. He then knelt again, raising the golden tray above his head.

"King Wei, please look," Ning Wan said gently.

On the tray, beneath a veil of white light, lay a neatly folded feather cloak. Each individual feather was distinct, perfectly uniform in length and color. The tip of every feather held a hint of pale purple, and under the Heavenly Light, they revealed dense, intricate patterns of a rare, dark gold.

Merely resting on the table, the cloak radiated a mystical True Qi that washed over them in profound waves.

Ning Wan's expression was solemn as she announced, "This is a gift from the imperial family: the Campaign Cloak of King Wei. The base is woven from the great treasure of True Qi, the Divine Light Brocade, using Heavenly Li Crimson Gold for thread. It is adorned with one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two long feathers from the Purple Mi-Oriole, a beast of Purple Qi. It was crafted with a vast amount of spiritual resources."

She continued, "The Divine Light Brocade is renowned for being indestructible and for its light, which can dim but never be extinguished. This cloak has been enhanced with numerous wondrous arts. Unless it is utterly obliterated in a single blow, it will repair itself over time! It is a blessing, that King Wei may remain unharmed through a hundred battles and advance even further in his cultivation!"

Her tone grew more emphatic. "This is the most revered cloak among all the kings, second only to that of the Emperor himself!"

Regardless of its practical effects, the spiritual materials used were undoubtedly among the most precious. Furthermore, the sheer amount of Divine Light Brocade used was astounding—enough to craft three or four other Spiritual Artifacts!

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flickered, his gaze fixed on the cloak. He reached out, the texture smooth and delicate beneath his fingers.

"I shall present a memorial to express my gratitude," he nodded.

As he spoke, the cloak trembled of its own accord. A fine, feather-like flame rose from it, as if seeking to bond with him, but he pressed it down, holding it still.

"In the dao of True Qi," Ning Wan explained, "prestige is not determined by tokens or immortal thrones, but by feather adornments. Among these, the cloak is the most venerated. This Campaign Cloak of King Wei shall serve as your symbol of office. With it, you may come and go as you please, and you shall not be required to announce your name when greeting the Emperor."

The woman raised a delicate hand and produced a small banner from within the cloak's folds. It was no bigger than her palm, its base a deep purple with black and gold patterns, embroidered with the words: 'King Wei of the Great Song.'

"This," Ning Wan said, "is King Wei's Banner of Martial Governance in Ting Province. When planted in the Great Void, it can pacify the region's elemental disasters, evil demons, and savage tribes. It gathers the world's True Qi, which will greatly benefit your disciples' cultivation."

Li Zhouwei picked up the Spiritual Artifact and inspected it. Its wonders were far less impressive than the cloak's. Its primary functions were to manage spiritual veins, nurture a region's spiritual energy, and provide some measure of protection.

'The only noteworthy feature is its ability to be planted in the Great Void... When the army is on the move, raising this banner from afar would allow one to sense any Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who descend or attempt to spy on them.'

It was clearly an artifact forged for conquering the north. Li Zhouwei took a sip of his tea, quickly grasping the Song court's intentions. He asked casually,

"What matters does the Bureau of Immortal Rites oversee? And which houses are involved?"

"The Song court has Three Palaces and Six Bureaus," Ning Wan replied in a low voice.

"The Six Departments are now established to govern the court, but the Three Palaces remain dormant... It is said the highest among them will be the Purple and Gold Palace, which will have only a few members. Those who enter will receive immense benefits."

"As for the Bureau of Immortal Rites... it doesn't manage much. Its main purpose is to regulate the sects, but there aren't many sects left to speak of in Yue State now. It's mainly Azure Pond, the Snow Wings Sect, the Myriad Radiance Sect... and various smaller temples and monasteries..."

"The Myriad Radiance Sect?" Li Zhouwei inquired.

"Yang Ruiyi... has gone to Sword Gate," Ning Wan explained. "Sword Gate will have its inner disciples and Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators continue their seclusion. The outer sect, however, will gather at the Sword-Lifting Ferry, preserving the foundation of Sword Gate while also accepting the Bureau's direction."

"If I may add... the Sword-Lifting Ferry is filled with disciples from the Cheng Clan... many have already journeyed south. I believe they intend to seek official positions."

Her expression grew complicated.

"It's difficult to say! Sword Gate built its reputation on virtue. The Cheng Clan has always advocated for that virtue, preaching seclusion and ignoring the affairs of Jiangnan. Now, seeking office and governing a region has also become 'virtuous.' It seems... the Cheng Clan was the one least willing to follow its own rules."

Though Ning Wan had said she shouldn't add more, she was now one of the few in the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition who dared to speak so openly. Her expression calmed, and she sighed.

"It is a pity for Senior Lingmei... The elders of Sword Gate agreed to hand over Jingchuan Prefecture so easily because their ancient virtues did not endorse worldly governance. I wonder what he would think now, seeing so many Cheng Clan disciples emerge from the mountains."

Li Zhouwei had received a great kindness from Lingmei, a debt he had yet to repay. He had nothing to add on the matter and simply nodded in silence. Ning Wan paused for a moment before deftly changing the subject.

"His Majesty holds you in the highest regard, King Wei, considering you his right hand. I came today for two reasons: first, to perform the enfeoffment ceremony, and second, to discuss your fief."

"With the establishment of the new dynasty, the lands of Yue have been divided into six provinces and thirty-two prefectures. They are: Ting Province of Moongaze Lake, Xun Province of the Mushroom Forest Plains, He Province of the Cangwu Forests, Heng Province of the Eastern Hengzhu Plains, Min Province of the Simin Reeds River, and Li Province of the Lixia Mountains."

"The former territories of the Snow Wings, Purple Smoke, Myriad Radiance, and Xiukui sects have been designated as prefectures but not provinces... There are twelve such prefectures, most of which retain their old names."

The woman blinked.

"After all... most of those names were decided by the former King of Yue. Following the old system now, any changes made were simply to restore their original names."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. "How have the prefectures been divided?"

Ning Wan answered without much thought. "The Great Song has enfeoffed three kings. First is King Wei of the Li Clan, second is King of Yuyang of the Chen Clan, and third is King of Nanjia of the Lingu Clan... The other titles... are not worth mentioning!"

She hesitated for a second. "Actually, there is one other domain, called the Protectorate of the Tranquil Sea. It's in the old lands of Shahuan, overlooking Shitang, and is guarded by Protector Liu."

The "Protector Liu" she spoke of was, of course, Daoist Master Zhusheng. This made Li Zhouwei raise his brows and set down his cup.

'It's not surprising. Suiguan arranged this long ago... After all, this Daoist Master Zhusheng is also of imperial descent, a successor of the Chu State. Even the Xiao-Wu orthodoxy comes from Chu. They couldn't let him go. Combined with the strategic importance of Shitang... this domain was inevitable.'

'As for people like Sima Yuanli and Yang Ruiyi, they are the Great Song's true inner circle. Naturally, they wouldn't be considered for a kingship.'

Ning Wan glanced at him and continued, "Of the six provinces, only Ting Province has a king, and it belongs to you, Wei. The territory was demarcated by your own Li Jiangliang. The other kings receive only a single prefecture; their domains cannot be called provinces..."

"For the nobility in Ting Province, the difference isn't great. But the Chen Clan's fiefdom has been reduced the most drastically, by more than half, leaving them with just a prefecture city... The Lingu Clan fared better... losing only ten or twenty percent of their land."

"As for the rest... most of the prefectures in Min Province are state-owned, with a few small fiefs... I've seen the enfeoffment map. Past the Quanwu Mountains, it's a completely different picture... Numerous houses stand side-by-side, the land littered with so many minor nobles you probably couldn't count them all."

Li Zhouwei listened, then glanced at the map she handed him. He understood immediately.

'The "provinces" are under the Great Song's direct control, formed from the core territories of the old Azure Pond, Hengzhu, and Changxiao sects, including places like Manor Peak at Moongaze. The lands beyond are governed much like how the Li Clan managed the Wilderness...'

'The difference is that the former Yue State is vast. The twelve prefecture cities remain under the Great Song's control, with officials they appoint and dismiss. Outside those cities, they can freely grant land to noble families, encouraging them to develop the frontiers... The sheer number of them is staggering...'

He gave the overall map a cursory glance before focusing his attention on Ting Province. He found its area to be quite substantial.

'The northern border extends all the way to the banks of the great river, and the southern border rests against the mountains, so nothing has changed there. The eastern and western borders, however, start from the traditional eastern shore... stretch past the Western Mountains that served as the border between Wu and Yue, and even encompass a small slice of the great desert...'

The territory of Ting Province as defined by the Song court was larger, not smaller, than the Li Clan's current domain. The only real loss was the Wilderness, which had been re-designated as Jiangjuan Prefecture to the west and Baoshan Prefecture to the east.

'They only took the Wilderness.'

The Wilderness was not a desirable place at the moment, having been ravaged by the Way of Great Desire. The actual loss was minimal, though it complicated things for the many subordinate families whose roots were still there.

Li Zhouwei nodded, his gaze lingering on the very top of the map.

The black, curved line depicting the surging river connected to Lake Xian. Below the lake was Shanji Prefecture. This prefecture, lost for many years, was now specially marked as belonging to the Great Song.

Seeing Li Zhouwei's focused stare, Ning Wan followed his line of sight and understood at once.

'That's the nail planted by the Profound Governance Pavilion. The Song Emperor can't ignore it. A great war is inevitable...'




# Chapter 1035: Changes in the Northwest

‘But today… I am not in a position to speak of such things!’

Ning Wan paused. Across from her, Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, rising from his seat to pace the floor.

"I've heard," he began, "that Daoist Master Ning presented a dragon's tendon to the Song Emperor."

A sorrowful look slowly clouded Ning Wan's features. "That is correct," she replied.

Li Zhouwei spun around. "Which dragon scion was it?" he demanded.

A dragon's tendon was one of the rarest treasures in the world. Forget using one; merely possessing such a thing was enough to send a chill down a man's spine.

Every member of the Dragon-kin was accounted for, and the disappearance of any one of them would be known instantly. Ning Wan's act was not just a declaration of loyalty to the Song Emperor; it was a resounding slap in the face to the Dragon-kin before the eyes of the entire world. It was an unprecedented act, at least in this era.

This wasn't just her affair. It would have a profound impact on the relationship between the Underworld and the Dragon-kin.

Ning Wan let out a long breath. "Dongfang Ai, of the White Dragon lineage."

Li Zhouwei’s voice dropped to a low murmur. "How did you come by it?"

She shook her head, her voice trembling slightly.

"It was left behind by the Daoist Master… Someone advised me on its nature and how to use it to ensure my survival."

The woman lifted her head, her soft yet resolute gaze meeting his.

"This treasure was what the Emperor wanted," she said, her teeth clenched. "If I didn't give it to him… someone else would have come to take it! What choice did I have? Only by burning my bridges could I find a sliver of hope. From this day forward, the Ning clan can never again sail the seas. Our fortunes are now bound to the Great Song, to rise and fall together!"

Li Zhouwei stared at her, his expression grim. He wasn't surprised by her decision, but he was astonished that Daoist Master Yuansu was at the center of it. A flicker of disbelief colored his eyes.

‘Daoist Master Yuansu… just Daoist Master Yuansu? Even if he possesses a Spiritual Treasure, he's still just a cultivator with a single divine ability. Don't the dragons have Spiritual Treasures of their own? How could he possibly slay a dragon?’

‘And even if he could, why provoke the Dragon-kin? Why push the Ning clan into such a desperate corner? Even if he foresaw this day, there was no need for such a dangerous gamble!’

Li Zhouwei remained unconvinced.

"What Dao did Dongfang Ai cultivate?" he asked quietly.

Ning Wan closed her eyes. "True Qi!"

The answer made Li Zhouwei slowly straighten up. He turned back to the window and posed his final question.

"How will the dragon tendon be used?"

Ning Wan glanced at him.

"Tianwu possessed three Dharma Treasures," she explained.

"The first was the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel, the second was the True Adherence and Abstruse Strategy Whip, and the third was the Martial Seal of Authority and Karma."

"Of these, the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel was a Rank Designation and has long since been shattered. The Martial Seal of Authority and Karma and the True Adherence and Abstruse Strategy Whip were both inherited from his father, the King of Jiangling. They were once mortal items, but ascended with the Emperor to the realms beyond."

Her voice was haunting.

"The Martial Seal of Authority and Karma… the imperial lineage prepared it long ago. They began refining it when the King of Yue first conquered the lands, and it has now reached the pinnacle of Spiritual Artifacts. As for the True Adherence and Abstruse Strategy Whip…"

She met Li Zhouwei's gaze and stated flatly,

"It must be reforged upon the Emperor's ascension. For that, this dragon tendon is required."

Li Zhouwei didn't flinch.

"Was this all calculated by Senior Yuansu?" he asked calmly.

Ning Wan's pupils dilated slightly, a flicker of panic in her eyes. She kept her head down, staring at the teacup before her.

"Perhaps," she murmured, "he received guidance from someone of an even higher station."

Li Zhouwei fell silent for a moment, his gaze drifting past the window frame to the heavens beyond. Billowing clouds and crackling lightning were gathering on the horizon, roiling and surging over the immutable peaks of the Western Mountains before unleashing a torrential downpour.

Through the heavy rain, faint streaks of pale light could be seen zipping through the air-likely escape lights. As the storm clouds blotted out the sky, Li Zhouwei drew his gaze back inside. Ning Wan remained with her head bowed, cradling her cup in silence.

In the span of a few breaths, a burly, bear-chested man in bronze armor landed before the hall. He dropped to one knee with a clang, his breathing heavy.

"Your Majesty! Guyan Temple was besieged and has fallen! The enemy is advancing and has almost reached the Western Mountains!"

Li Zhouwei, his back to the soldier, did not reply. Instead, he slowly looked down at the desk where the resplendent Campaign Cloak of King Wei, with its brilliant, well-defined feathers, lay folded next to a profound banner of violet-blue and black-gold brocade. In the dimming light, their glow seemed all the more piercing.

Ning Wan rose to her feet, lifted the jade tray holding the cloak, and bowed. 

"King Wei… please!"

Li Zhouwei snatched the cloak, giving her one last, deep look without a word. With his other hand, he picked up the violet-blue and black-gold banner and gave it a light shake.

Swish…

In an instant, the banner unfurled into a massive azure and violet standard. A radiant qilin pattern shimmered upon it, majestic and inviolable. Li Zhouwei grasped the pure black staff and struck it against the ground with a resounding clang.

Without a second glance, he handed the royal standard to Zhouda, draped the Campaign Cloak over his shoulders, and strode out of the hall, leaving behind a single, calm, and powerful command:

"March on Guyan."

---

Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain.

The Golden Hall shone with a glassy, lustrous light. Rows of lotus thrones descended in tiers, surrounded by a forest of golden statues of all sizes, each holding a different golden instrument.

The highest thrones glowed most brilliantly, occupied by several Buddhist cultivators of varying appearances. They avoided each other's gazes, their mutual wariness palpable.

At the very top, a figure sat cloaked in a simple gray robe, a violet, multicolored light flowing around him. His face was a disturbing sight, covered in a dense cluster of small, dark eyes on his forehead and cheeks, all darting about observantly.

This was Maha Zhelu of Turbid Emptiness, a Liangli of the Way of Emptiness.

The Way of Emptiness ultimately lacked a deep foundation. Though Zhelu held the noble rank of Liangli, he had only reached the threshold of the sixth life. His Dao lineage held little prestige, and the high-ranking monks seated around him refused to meet his gaze. But with so many eyes roving across his face, it was impossible for them to avoid his stare completely. Several Mahas nearly twisted their necks trying to look away.

In the middle of the hall, a pale pink Golden Lotus Seat was in bloom. Maha Minghui was propped up on one hand, feigning a nap while his narrowed eyes scanned the assembly.

‘How the times have changed…’ he thought. ‘The landlords and magnates are holding a meeting and have put Compassion’s dog in the seat of honor.’

With the founding of the Great Song, Jiangnan had become a tough nut to crack. Since Buddhist cultivators had always bullied the weak and feared the strong, the Mahas of Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain were all looking for a way out. Only Minghui, who knew the score, feigned sleep.

After a moment of observation, Zhelu's gaze turned cold. He pressed his palms together.

"Everyone… since word has come from the north, we should proceed south."

The hall was silent. Zhelu waited for a long while before finally asking,

"Why is everyone so quiet?"

A nearby Golden Lotus Seat stirred. The six-armed, four-legged Maha Nuzi looked up. Though his cultivation was far below Zhelu's, his background as a confidant of the Peacock from the Great Desire afforded him considerable status.

"I wonder why Immortal Envoy Qi suddenly changed his mind and sent Gongsun Bei over," he said calmly.

"It seems an unnecessary complication. Now our own people are in an awkward position, unsure whether to go or stay…"

Wary of Nuzi’s connections, Zhelu put on a smile. "That is… difficult to speak on. Immortal Master Qi recently took a disciple on Xiaoshi Mountain. He treasures the boy immensely. After bringing him up the mountain, he suddenly started issuing new orders, rerouting several of the southern contingents and specifically pulling Gongsun Bei from his assignment to bring a treasure to the lake."

"A disciple? Isn't Xiaoshi Mountain within our Buddhist Land?" Nuzi frowned in confusion.

"Heh," Zhelu said softly. "The boy was originally from Jiangbei. After the turmoil, he became a novice monk under our jurisdiction. We never knew he possessed such talent that the Profound Governance Pavilion would accept him as a disciple!"

Though his words were neutral, his tone was laced with sourness. To be taken in by Qi Lanyan, who was willing to break rules for him, the boy must have been extraordinary. He could have achieved great things within the Buddhist Land. It was an irksome loss, but Zhelu dared not show his true feelings.

Nuzi’s frown deepened, still puzzled.

He prided himself on his understanding of the Profound Governance Pavilion. Those Daoists were insufferably arrogant and had always looked down on Buddhist cultivators. They placed great importance on karma and disliked cultivators who converted to Buddhism, showing even more disdain for those who wavered between the two paths. Why would they ever accept a novice monk?

‘Something is wrong here… but there's no need for me to dig deeper. Lord Peacock is in seclusion, and when he emerges, he'll be an undeniable powerhouse. Why should I wade into these muddy waters? I'll just protect myself and enjoy the benefits.’

His silence left Zhelu without an ally, and the other cultivators simply exchanged glances, unwilling to speak.

Finally, with a rustle, someone stood up. It was a man with a long, horse-like face and a stern expression: Maha Taixi, from Zhelu’s own Way of Emptiness, rising to support his leader.

"The Shanji Prefecture is a vital location. My strength is limited, so I cannot afford any delays. I will advance from the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter and attack the Wilderness!"

Minghui chuckled darkly and suddenly spoke up. "Taixi Dashi… why not go to Moongaze Lake? You seem to hold quite a grudge against it!"

‘…’

Taixi’s expression froze, rage flashing in his eyes, but he suppressed it.

"My abilities are lacking, far inferior to my esteemed colleagues," he said coolly.

"I am not worthy of such a great responsibility. Besides… General Gongsun will lead his forces to Moongaze Lake. My foundation is of the Veiled Yin. If I were strong, it would be one thing, but in my current weakened state, I would be at a great disadvantage against the Bright Yang. Does the Lotus Temple, with all its study of Daoist law, not even understand such a basic principle?"

He paused, then added with a sneer, "It seems the lack of milk at the banquet has soured Minghui Dashi's mood!"

"Heh!"

Minghui knew exactly who the jibe was aimed at. An insult to Jinlian was an insult to him. His anger flared, and he shot up from his seat. 

"What nonsense!" he laughed coldly. "Just because Gongsun Bei is going, the Buddhist cultivators are no longer needed? Since the Way of Emptiness is presiding, you must send someone to show your sincerity. If you won't show filial respect to the Liangli, do you expect his esteemed personage to go to the lake himself? And who would manage the other fronts then?"

His words were vicious and sharp. Maha Taixi erupted in fury.

"Give you an inch and you take a mile! Don't think I don't know what you're plotting! You just want us to test the White Qilin for you. If you're so determined to serve, why don't you go yourself!"

Minghui roared with laughter, his gaze resolute, his face radiating an aura of righteous dignity. He kicked his lotus throne aside, leaped into the center of the hall, struck a heroic pose, and thundered,

"And why would I not go?!"

The declaration was earth-shattering, like the grand entrance of a hero from an opera. It left Taixi stunned, his mind a complete blank.

‘Huh? What kind of game is this?!’

The other high-ranking cultivators all turned to stare, utterly bewildered.

But Minghui was far from finished. He beat his chest and proclaimed,

"On the previous southern campaigns, my Lotus Temple was unable to participate due to other matters… Now, to show our utmost sincerity and our willingness to die in service of the Dao of Mount Dayang, we wish to lead the vanguard! To spread the fundamental laws of our sacred Dao and save all living beings from the fires of suffering!"

He spoke with righteous tears welling in his eyes.

"I only ask for the Liangli's blessing!" he gritted out.

Most of those present knew what sort of character he was, making the performance utterly bizarre. No one knew what to say. Only Luejin, the Merciful One from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, bowed his head slightly, a look of genuine emotion on his face.

‘This Master Minghui is truly a good man… Master was right to trust him! Of all the areas along the coast, Moongaze Lake has the largest population. A single battle there could cost a hundred thousand lives, yet he braves the danger himself…’

‘The Lotus Temple… despite its reputation for hedonistic monks and barking-dog masters, it produces disciples who are truly devoted to good… There is merit to the Lotus Temple after all…’

Zhelu was just as dumbfounded. The eyes covering his face stared fixedly at Minghui, unable to discern his true intentions. Even more shocked was Mingxiang, Minghui's fellow Maha from the Lotus Temple. His broad face was a mask of horror.

‘My Lotus Temple? Me?’

‘What is my junior brother doing?! Did I agree to this?’

He had every right to be afraid. This was an official war between north and south. There was no need for pretense; Immortals and Buddhists alike could enter the fray. That man Qi planned to make his move while the Great Song was still finding its footing. With Gongsun Bei bringing a Spiritual Treasure, King Wei was sure to fight to the death. No one wanted to be on the receiving end of the White Qilin's wrath—after all, Nu Xiao hadn't even managed to reincarnate successfully.

Yet, before they left, his own master had specifically instructed him to follow his junior brother's lead in all things. He could only force himself to remain calm as Zhelu, who had also maintained his composure, narrowed his eyes and spoke in a low voice.

"It is rare to see such devotion from Minghui Dashi. In that case, I will trouble you to select your men."

The moment the words were spoken, Taixi snapped out of his shock. A chill ran down his spine as he saw Minghui turn to him with a solemn expression.

"All matters must follow the Liangli's direction. Ultimately, we need a pillar of our Way of Emptiness. I must trouble Maha Taixi to accompany us south."

Zhelu said nothing, merely turning his gaze upon Taixi. The multitude of eyes on his face swiveled, and Taixi immediately understood. A venomous thought filled his mind.

‘How vicious…’

‘He's determined to drag me into this… Fine… Fine… The Li clan and I are mortal enemies. If Li Zhouwei counterattacks… the blame will surely fall on me! I don't even know how I offended this beast!’

But he had no way out. Gritting his teeth, he stepped down from his throne and bowed to his Liangli.

"I will obey your sacred command!"

Minghui ignored Taixi's murderous glare and scanned the assembly. He spotted a few likely candidates among the cultivators—one dressed in crimson astride a red tiger, another with extra eyes on his face, both from the Way of Emptiness. He pointed them all out, continuing until Zhelu's expression began to shift, at which point he abruptly stopped and smiled.

"Many thanks for the Liangli's approval!"

A smile creased Zhelu's face, the wrinkles bunching up around his many eyelids in a terrifying display.

"General Gongsun and his men have brought the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform," he said coldly. "They intend to see that qilin fall. Taixi Dashi, you are leading a sizable force. If you fail to suppress the qilin and bring back some of its bloodline this time, be prepared for an inquiry from Mount Dayang!"

# Chapter 1036: The General of Shu

The Guyan Great Desert.

A torrential downpour turned the world into a quagmire. On a hidden path, a convoy of carriages raced through the mud. Cries of mourning filled the air, and within one carriage rested a black lacquered coffin, surrounded by cultivators with bowed, weeping heads. The scene was one of grim solemnity. At the head of the procession, a man in white robes seemed utterly lost, his spirit adrift.

He only snapped back to reality when a cultivator approached him.

"Where are we?" he asked, his gaze distant.

The man offered a reassuring reply.

"Rest easy, Clan Head. The lands are in chaos, swarming with refugees. But our convoy is swift. We will cross the desert in less than a day."

Zhuang Pingye nodded numbly, his expression vacant.

The turmoil in the Wu State had been brewing for some time. The Zhuang family had heard the rumors but never considered leaving. This was the heartland of the Golden Feather Sect! How could the chaos of the world possibly reach this deep into their territory? How could it sweep across the entire desert? Besides, their own Old Master, Zhuang Cheng, was out on the frontier, helping the Golden Feather Sect quell the unrest. What could possibly go wrong?

He had been traveling south while his wife, Li Xinghan, was in seclusion. Hiding his identity, he had been indulging himself at a familiar marketplace when the news struck him like a thunderbolt: an army had invaded the desert. At the same time, a message arrived that his father was gravely ill. In that instant, all else was forgotten. He had raced home in a panic.

When he arrived, Zhuang Cheng was lying on his deathbed. The old Daoist, a rogue cultivator who had made his name in the desert with his talisman swords, had made few major mistakes in a life full of minor ones. In his later years, he had guided the Zhuang family to its zenith. But the war had left him mortally wounded, and he had exhausted the last of his strength just to make it home.

Ignoring his son, Zhuang Cheng’s first act was to summon Li Xinghan from her seclusion. Together, they assessed the dire situation. Realizing the gravity of it all, the Old Master didn’t even wait for a reply from Moongaze Lake. He made the last, and wisest, decision of his life.

‘Flee… Flee now!’

The Zhuang clan was a major power in the desert, a Foundation Establishment Realm family with a long and storied history. They had even managed to curry favor with Moongaze Lake, making them an untouchable force in their Prefecture. Yet now, they abandoned everything. They didn’t even dare to fly. Instead, they loaded their clan members and spiritual treasures onto a dozen carriages and stole out of the city under the cover of night, heading east.

Old Master Zhuang Cheng was not yet dead, but he feared the celestial phenomena his death would cause might attract unwanted attention. He had them seal him within the coffin to await his end while the others fled without stopping.

Even now, a chilling cold gripped Zhuang Pingye’s limbs. He entered the carriage to find his wife still beside the coffin, channeling her dharma power into it.

"Shouldn't you rest for a while?" he asked, his voice trembling with concern.

Li Xinghan shook her head.

Her features had matured, and her years managing the household had given her a sharp, capable air. But at this moment, her mind was troubled.

‘I never thought the Golden Feather Sect’s transition would be so violent… a full-blown slaughter. It completely upended our family’s calculations…’

The Zhuang family had been largely ignorant of the changes sweeping through the Wu State, but Li Xinghan had her own sources. She knew the Golden Feather Sect was likely to be absorbed into the new dynasty. Since the Zhuang family was sworn to the Golden Feather Sect, Moongaze Lake had refrained from interfering. But no one had expected the army from the west to unleash such unrestrained carnage, butchering their way across the land.

She sighed inwardly, looking at her disheveled husband in silence.

She wasn’t blind to his affairs. She knew that when Zhuang Pingye had come to Moongaze Lake, it hadn’t been for love at first sight. Whether he was keeping a mistress or simply seeking pleasure, he was at least smart enough to be discreet and spare her any public humiliation. For years, they had maintained a relationship of mutual, if distant, respect.

It had bothered her at first, but she had grown accustomed to it. Between managing clan affairs and her own sword practice, she had little time to spare. Besides, trying to change a man’s nature would likely have caused nothing but chaos and resentment.

‘My first love is the sword,’ she thought. ‘I have no right to demand he love me most of all.’

But now, their world had been turned upside down. Perhaps realizing that his future depended entirely on the mercy of his wife’s family, Zhuang Pingye’s voice was exceptionally gentle. The proud composure that had always defined him was gone, replaced by a nervous fear that she might decide to settle old scores.

This newfound vulnerability stirred a flicker of pity in Li Xinghan. The image of the Old Master clutching her hand, his eyes streaming with tears as he begged her to protect his family, was still vivid in her mind.

"You don't have to be afraid," she said, waving a hand dismissively. "The Old Master was able to drag his wounded body all the way back from the front lines. He must have used a divine ability to do so. The Golden Oneness Upper Sect couldn't possibly be unaware of this. They are likely bound by some agreement that prevents them from intervening directly, but they are surely offering support from the shadows."

Zhuang Pingye was a sharp man; he understood immediately. A wave of relief washed over him, though his eyes remained fixed on her. Li Xinghan, however, was gazing out the window. Her expression shifted as she saw the distant signs of a great battle.

"We just passed Guyan Temple!"

"What?" Zhuang Pingye was horrified. "You mean… an army from the west must have taken a shortcut to get here ahead of us."

"Either they mean to trap the desert's cultivators and prevent them from fleeing to the lake," Li Xinghan deduced, "or they're trying to stop the lake from taking advantage of the chaos to seize the desert for themselves!" She nodded. 

"My guess is they fear word has already reached the lake. They want to launch a surprise attack and try to capture the Western Mountains!"

The husband and wife sat in silence as the rain grew heavier, drowning out the sound of the horses' hooves. Their path remained strangely clear, almost unnaturally so. Then, just as suddenly as it began, the storm seemed to halt. A figure landed soundlessly before their carriage.

A powerful voice boomed,

"Subordinate Ding Weizeng, acting under the orders of King Wei, has come to escort you, my lady!"

‘King Wei…’

Li Xinghan was slightly surprised, but she recognized Ding Weizeng. Zhuang Pingye saw her nod, and the tension drained from his body. He let out a long sigh, his eyes shifting uncertainly toward his wife.

"We are grateful, Guest Retainer Ding," Li Xinghan said politely.

The carriage curtain was lifted, letting in a spray of cold rain. Zhuang Pingye put on a smile and greeted the Guest Retainer before quickly placing his hands on the coffin. He knocked gently. There was no response, only a silent, profound cold.

Li Xinghan turned away, shedding a single tear for the old man. As Zhuang Pingye bowed to Ding Weizeng, his mind went blank. His left hand rested on the coffin, trembling slightly. An emptiness hollowed out his chest. His father, the Old Master who had lived a life of prestige, had passed away somewhere along this desperate journey, dying silently in his coffin, consumed by worry.

---

At Guyan Temple, the downpour was relentless. Gray-black mud washed over the collapsed city walls, revealing fragments of ancient, broken stone. Thunder rolled across the heavens, shaking the very foundations of the earth.

On one side of the desert, ranks of silver-armored soldiers stood in perfect formation. Azure banners, emblazoned with a golden 【Shu】 character, snapped in the wind. Above them, celestial chariots with wheels thirty feet high stood arrayed amongst the clouds, an imposing and majestic sight.

On the other side, colorful clouds swirled, but the forces were far sparser. Li Zhouwei stood within the clouds, dressed in a simple black robe with gold-trimmed sleeves, a Campaign Cloak draped over his shoulders. Beside him, a bronze-skinned giant held a great, purple-hued banner embroidered with a qilin, standing firm within the roiling Heavenly Light.

At the foot of a mountain, several cultivators huddled together in the torrential rain, supporting one another, a picture of misery.

Guyan Temple had been built upon the ancient city walls. Its strategic location had earned it the favor of the Li clan, and it had long been their loyal vassal. Though its importance had waned after the walls fell, it remained a vital bridgehead to the desert. The few Guyan Temple cultivators who remained were all natives of the western shore. Now, supported by the Li clan’s men, they wept in each other's arms.

‘Great Shu…’

The azure banners were a clear declaration. The Xiao-Wu, who had seized their mandate from the state of Chu, had been utterly crushed, their last vestiges of power stamped out. The Shu army still radiated a thick, bloody killing intent, a testament to the brutal path they had carved to get here.

‘This faction has a far more potent thirst for blood,’ Li Zhouwei mused.

His presence in the sky, however, seemed to agitate the soldiers standing in the blood-soaked mud below. A flicker of light rippled through their ranks, and a figure emerged, riding the wind to lead a detachment forward.

The man came to a halt in the sky, revealing himself. He stopped at a respectful distance and clasped his hands in a formal salute. "This humble one is Ni Hongyan of the Ni clan, Founding Earl of the Qi Pavilion of Great Shu and Military Commissioner of the Desert Pacification Army. I greet you, Your Excellency!"

‘Daoist Master Ni Hongyan…’

Li Zhouwei had heard of him. The Ni clan had long been the Sword Gate’s most trusted aides, managing the lands of Shu on their behalf. This Daoist Master Hongyan had achieved his divine ability long ago and had always been a staunch supporter of the Supreme Yang Dao. But now, with the changing tides of power, he had clearly thrown his lot in with the Shu kingdom and received a significant post for his troubles—even if he was stationed out here in Guyan.

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. "Minghuang, King Wei of the Great Song."

A hint of unease crossed Daoist Master Hongyan’s face. He forced a smile. "So it is King Wei. For Your Majesty to cross the mountains and bring your forces here… might there be some urgent matter to discuss?"

The young man chuckled, his hands clasped behind his back. "The people in that temple belong to my Moongaze Lake. And yet you say it is I who has brought forces here?"

Daoist Master Hongyan took a half-step back. He opened his mouth to speak, but the proximity to Li Zhouwei made him wary. He lowered his voice. "Allow me to report to the Grand General."

Before he could turn, another man shot through the air, his silver armor glinting magnificently. He stopped beside Hongyan, his brow furrowed.

"Military Commissioner, why do you hesitate?"

Li Zhouwei watched him with a cold gaze. The man returned the stare without flinching, his eyes locking directly onto Li Zhouwei’s.

"And who might this be?" he demanded.

The question put Daoist Master Hongyan in an awkward position. He stepped forward again, ignoring the newcomer and addressing Li Zhouwei in a placating tone.

"King Wei… this is Lord Li Muyan, a Meritorious Official of the Black Tortoise Spiritual Wing."

Li Zhouwei remained impassive, not deigning to give Li Muyan a second glance. The man hadn't possessed a divine ability for long. Some unknown boon must have been granted to him, giving him a deceptively impressive aura that hinted at some hidden power.

What truly drew Li Zhouwei’s attention was the glittering silver chariot in the distance. There had to be someone else there.

‘I wonder… is it the Shu Emperor, or some other highness?’

There was still no news from the Golden Feather Sect. If things had gone as expected, they should have joined forces with Mount Changhuai. One was of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, the other from the Changhuai Immortal Mountain—their combined strength would be terrifying.

Behind him, Li Zhouda’s expression turned icy with surprise.

‘The Tanshan Li Clan…’

Li Muyan, of course, knew exactly who Li Zhouwei was. He simply put on a cold face and said dismissively,

"King Wei? I am acting on the Grand General's orders to conquer the Western Mountains. I know of no King Wei."

At these words, Li Zhouwei’s eyebrows shot up, and his golden eyes swept over the man.

The Western Mountains were a range devoid of spiritual energy that served as a natural border. Their peaks were so treacherous and high that even cultivators of lower realms could not cross them. They were easy to defend and hard to attack; a single powerful cultivator with a defensive array was all that was needed to hold them. If they fell into enemy hands, that enemy would hold the high ground, creating an insurmountable threat that would rob Moongaze Lake of all peace.

Whether Shu was truly determined to take the Western Mountains was debatable, but Moongaze Lake absolutely could not afford to lose them.

Daoist Master Hongyan’s face fell, and he sighed internally.

‘He really is spoiling for a fight…’

But since Li Muyan had spoken, there was nothing more for him to say. Hongyan silently took a step back, positioning himself behind Li Muyan.

The golden-eyed young man before them, however, let out a cold laugh. His words shot out, forcing Li Muyan's retort back down his throat.

"Li Muyan… the Tanshan Li Clan may not recognize a King of Wei, but do you recognize an Emperor of Wei?"

Li Muyan had not expected such a response. His expression darkened.

"What is this nonsense! My Tanshan Li Clan hails from Jiangnan! We have no connection whatsoever to the north! What talk is this of a Wei Emperor?" he snarled.

But in the blink of an eye, the young man vanished.

Daoist Master Hongyan’s face contorted in alarm as a brilliant light instantly coalesced around him. He felt a searing Heavenly Light wash over him. Li Zhouwei reappeared in mid-air, his hand thrust forward, clenching a point of golden light. As he swung, the light extended like liquid mercury, forming a crescent-bladed halberd. The weapon’s chilling edge leaped forth like a deadly stinger.

His voice boomed like thunder, cold and majestic.

"Your pathetic lies betray you!"

Li Muyan gritted his teeth. His silver armor blazed as his divine abilities converged. A storm of lightning instantly gathered from the heavens, surging into his armor. A golden radiance erupted from between his brows, casting a brilliant sheen.

Li Zhouwei’s halberd descended like a mountain, yet it moved with an ethereal grace. It found a gap in the thunder and golden light, stabbing straight down. A flicker of contempt crossed Li Zhouwei’s face.

_BOOM!_

A torrent of golden lightning erupted, but a brownish-green umbrella suddenly appeared, spinning open. It unfurled a canopy of earthen brown, completely and utterly smothering the golden light.

The Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, using Wu Earth to counter lightning.

His lightning was effortlessly blocked, but the deadly point of the halberd could not be ignored. Li Muyan’s mouth opened in a sharp cry. "Hah!"

In an instant, a ripple of silver lightning burst from his body, exploding into a web of chains that coiled around the halberd, bringing its advance to a sudden halt.

At the same time, Daoist Master Hongyan unleashed his own Spiritual Artifact. A hazy, churning flame snaked up his arm and coalesced into a fiery spear, which he immediately launched at Li Zhouwei’s face.

Seeing this, Li Muyan allowed himself a cold smirk. But to his shock, the halberd, entangled in lightning, gave a slight twist. A brilliant golden light exploded outwards, stunning him for a fraction of a second and nearly allowing the Grand Ascension to break free.

Li Muyan immediately grew cautious.

‘Daoist Master Hongyan has cultivated two divine abilities to perfection over many years. And while I may be newly ascended, I have the blessing of the Martial Inquiry’s light, which makes me formidable. Still, this man is favored by destiny; I must be careful.’

He poured more of his dharma power and divine ability into the chains, desperately trying to hold the halberd in place. But Li Zhouwei held the weapon with one hand, his posture as relaxed as if he were on a leisurely stroll. Without giving his two opponents so much as a glance, he raised his other hand. Ten streaks of violet-white lightning crashed down from the sky, all striking the flame spear.

_BOOM!_

Billowing black smoke rose as a purple-gold lightning mace materialized within the vortex of dark clouds above. Its golden sheen was so brilliant it made Li Muyan’s expression change.

‘What a fine treasure… to think it was wasted in the hands of Bright Yang! But this is not enough… That man Qing is watching from the back. I need to force out more of his true power!’

He grit his teeth and sneered, "You dare mention the Wei Emperor? You ignorant whelp. How dare you hope that my Tanshan clan shares a lineage with you Wei fiends!"

The words hit like a thunderclap, but the first to react was Daoist Master Hongyan. He gasped, his heart sinking.

‘He’ll say anything… Does he truly have that much faith in Qing?’

This remark finally made Li Zhouwei focus his full attention on Li Muyan’s face. An expression of cold disgust mixed with anger appeared.

"I will grant you your wish."

In a single thought, the golden-eyed young man’s brows furrowed. An overwhelming, irresistible force shattered the divine ability, sending silver fragments flying. Li Muyan staggered forward as his power buckled. A muffled explosion echoed in his ears.

_CLANG!_

For a terrifying second, his vision blurred. Golden light flashed before his eyes, and a deafening buzz filled his ears. The entire world fractured into a kaleidoscope of blue, white, purple, and yellow shards. There was only noise, and the cold, wet sensation of something trickling from his nose.

‘…’

His consciousness plunged into an abyss for a moment before clawing its way back from the depths. He snapped back to clarity with a jolt of pure terror. The world swam back into focus.

But the roiling thunderclouds, Daoist Master Hongyan—everything was gone. Above him was a Celestial Gate, as bright as a mountain peak. All he could see in every direction was an endless expanse of black and gold, pierced by a single point of light.

It was the ice-cold face of Li Zhouwei.

The young man seemed both infinitely distant and terrifyingly close.

In that same instant, he realized what the endless darkness enveloping him was. It wasn't a divine ability or a spiritual artifact, not an array or a spectral veil. It was a dense, unending torrent of dark golden light.

Emperor Qi's Light.

The flood of this divine ability poured down on him, leaving him as helpless as a lone boat in a raging sea, struggling and unable to move. From the sky above, a massive, mountain-like halberd slowly descended, radiating a terrifying pressure that stole his breath.

‘The Radiant Sun King's Halberd!’

Li Muyan could no longer afford to care about his dignity. His eyes widened in horror.

"Grand General!"

_BOOM!_

The wind and rain outside suddenly ceased. A stream of gray energy shot down from the sky like a bolt of lightning, transforming into a massive hand. It had clearly been gathering power for some time. It brutally swiped aside the outer layer of Emperor Qi's Light and clamped down hard.

A cold shout echoed from the sky.

"Li Zhouwei!"

_DONG!!_

The Radiant Sun King's Halberd struck something seemingly indestructible. A cloud of golden dust exploded from its blade, raining down like glittering powder. A gray pearl shot out, tumbling awkwardly through the air. Unable to control its trajectory, it plummeted like a meteor and slammed into the ground with a deafening crash.

A direct hit from the halberd would have left Li Muyan hovering between life and death; even survival would have meant a decade of secluded healing. Now, having been saved, he was still drenched in a cold sweat. Seizing the moment when Emperor Qi's Light was shattered, he shed the remaining streams of light from his body and prepared to flee.

But the black-robed young man had already vanished.

The gray energy in the sky solidified, revealing a youth with refined features and a simple, unadorned Daoist robe. His face was exceptionally grim. One of his hands was hidden behind his back, clearly in pain, while the other made a grasping motion in the air.

_CLANG!_

A metallic ringing vibrated through everyone's ears. The western army stumbled in disarray. A golden bracelet flashed in the air for an instant before disappearing again.

But in that same instant, the bright blade of a halberd appeared reflected in the pupils of Li Muyan on the opposite side. He desperately drew all his divine abilities into his body, simultaneously activating his True Qi and expelling a stream of white vapor from his nose.

"Bestow!"

But the enemy's Spiritual Artifact was simply too fast!

_BANG!_

The gray pearl had only just hit the ground. Caught completely off guard, Li Muyan took the full force of the halberd strike. Before his white vapor could even fully form, it was violently dispersed. Like a falling star, he was blasted from the sky and crashed into the western battle formation. An explosion of lightning and fire erupted. The earth cracked, the mountains shook, and the rain stopped completely.
The youth who had emerged from the gray energy looked utterly livid. He stared coldly at Li Zhouwei and took a step forward, drawing upon the gray energy until it loomed like a mountain.

The two faced off in the sky for a tense moment. The silver-armored general finally climbed out from a pile of bodies, coughing violently and spitting up black blood that pulsed with purple flames. He had barely found his footing when his face contorted in horror.

Almost simultaneously, the youth confronting Li Zhouwei showed a look of shocked fury. He erupted. "King Wei, what incredible nerve!"

_CLANG!_

The reply came not from Li Zhouwei, but from a heaven-shaking metallic sound. Something abruptly pierced through the Great Void right in front of Li Muyan.

It was a golden spear, ten feet long, utterly smooth and unadorned.
The Descending Radiance Equal Edge!

This was an item Li Zhouwei had obtained from a grotto-heaven. He had never had a chance to use it. It was forged from 'Wandering Metal,' an element that existed outside of cause and effect, making it free and untraceable, impossible to detect or predict.

_Pfft!_

The golden spear, having waited for the perfect moment, flashed like lightning. It pierced straight through Li Muyan’s chest and vanished, drawing a muffled grunt. He stumbled back several steps, spitting up more blood. The gray energy in the sky roared, incandescent with rage.

"Li Zhouwei!"

The spear had not struck him, but the humiliation was greater than any physical blow. It had pierced straight through his pride. Qing Jifang, a noble scion of an immortal sect, a man who considered himself superior to almost anyone he met, had never suffered such a loss of face.

He exploded in a furious rage, and the gray energy blotted out the sky. Qing Jifang sneered. "Fine… A fine King Wei… You dare show such disrespect to my Changhuai Dao Lineage? We'll see who will be left with no face at the end of this!"

The gray pearl leaped from the ground and flew into his hand. The churning gray energy boiled over, surging around Li Zhouwei's body. But Li Zhouwei's expression was strange. He was staring intently at the hand Qing Jifang kept hidden behind his back.

‘As expected of the son of a Great Daoist Master of Changhuai. To take a Splitting Light strike from the Radiant Sun King's Halberd head-on with his physical body… Even with his powerful physique, superior spell arts, and time to prepare… he must have lost at least four fingers. And he hasn't even made a sound!’

Seeing Li Zhouwei staring at his hidden hand, Qing Jifang understood instantly. It was the ultimate insult, adding fuel to the fire. His four fingers were hanging on by mere threads of flesh, and the potent Bright Yang divine ability was still spreading through the wounds. He didn't dare bring his hand out. He gritted his teeth in fury.

‘Li Muyan and Ni Hongyan… one got carried away by his own act and underestimated the enemy, the other was a useless coward, stunned like a wooden chicken… He was completely dazed by a single Spiritual Treasure! If even one of them had been a competent Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, why would I have needed to block that halberd myself!’

Qing Jifang’s techniques were profound, his background noble, his treasures numerous. In a proper fight, there was no way such a clumsy Spiritual Artifact could have ever touched him! He was confident he had a hundred ways to wound Li Zhouwei right here and now, yet he was the one who had to suffer such a humiliating blow.

‘Go ahead and laugh, Li Zhouwei… When you suffer your defeat in the north, we'll see who in Moongaze Lake is left smiling!’




# Chapter 1037: The Killing Intent of Martial Cultivation

In the Great Void, dense layers of Metal Malice swirled through the dim light and shadows. A Daoist Master, clad in a robe of golden stone and flying sand, stood bathed in radiance. He took a few steps and stopped, a smile playing on his lips as he gazed down into the mortal realm. Beside him, a woman waited, her body turned slightly toward him.

"My lord… will they fight?"

"They won't."

Daoist Master Tianhuo shook his head with a smile.

"Qing Jifang gains nothing by winning, and he'd only lose face if he lost. There's friction between the two nations, but it's nowhere near the point where a King-Marquis would resort to arms. From start to finish, this has been nothing more than Tanshan trying to curry favor."

Seeing the woman nod in understanding, he pointed a hand beyond the Great Void toward the grand confrontation between the two nations and chuckled.

"But his actions still reek of the same old habits. You know, some people are just stingy to their core. Even if they're reincarnated, reborn into a new life with no memory of the last, they can never shake that miserliness. He's completely unwilling to suffer even the smallest loss, which just makes him seem petty."

The woman clearly knew he was mocking Qing Tangyin. She lowered her gaze and said,

"True Qi was never Mount Changhuai's business to begin with. That master of theirs secludes himself in a remote corner, cut off from all Spiritual Qi, a recluse high above the world. He's on the same path as the Wandering Metal cultivators, isn't that a conflict with the path of worldly engagement? The Taihua Classic says: 'The Heavenly Throne cannot be forced; Karmic Affinity is more precious than divine ability.' Ha! It takes a thousand years for Wu Earth to even drive out the Bright Yang!"

This kind of critical commentary wasn't her place to make. Daoist Master Tianhuo knew she admired that Wandering Metal True Monarch from the north and held a dim view of Mount Changhuai. He spoke in a low, somber tone,

"I've heard that among the various lineages of the Supreme Yang, the Xingbo line was originally preeminent. Yet now, the highest cultivation level belongs to that lord from Mount Changhuai... If he weren't bound by his position, he could very well be aiming for the Dao Embryo. Who could have predicted it?"

The woman fell silent, having understood the warning. Daoist Master Tianhuo waited a while, watching as the gray mist on the horizon gradually receded before finally manifesting himself. He came to a stop amidst the ethereal white fog of the mountainside, looked toward the man in black, and said with a smile, 

"Greetings, King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei had actually noticed him long ago. Having just forced Qing Jifang back, he showed no surprise at all. He simply clasped his hands and said,

"My thanks, Daoist Master!"

Daoist Master Tianhuo understood he was referring to the matter with the Zhuang Clan. Shaking his head with a slight laugh, he followed behind the King-Marquis with his hands clasped behind his back. His bearing was transcendent as he walked along the clouds in the sky. An immortal and a king—they made for a rather complementary pair.

"This is Duanyan!"

The noble immortal scion of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition gestured toward Zhang Duanyan. The woman immediately gave a slight curtsy and smiled.

"Greetings, King Wei!"

Golden Feather had always operated quietly; their successes and failures were all decided within their grotto-heaven. How many years had it been? This celestial maiden had already reached the Purple Mansion Realm.

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod.

Daoist Master Tianhuo spoke politely, "I was planning to visit Ting Province anyway, so I just took this opportunity to come over... Might I ask... where is Fellow Daoist Zhaojing?"

"My grand-uncle is still in seclusion... I'm afraid he won't be able to meet you."

After that long battle to the west, Li Ximing still hadn't shown himself. The claim of seclusion was most likely true, which made Daoist Master Tianhuo's gaze shift slightly.

'What poor timing...'

He thought this to himself, but his words didn't stop. He said mockingly, "Qing Jifang is quite a character. Back during the affair with the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel, I always thought he and his father were just putting on a show. Now, seeing this blatantly idiotic display, even I can't tell if he's genuinely stupid or just pretending."

Daoist Master Tianhuo and Qing Jifang didn't get along, so Li Zhouwei took his taunts as mere pleasantries. Inwardly, however, he was carefully assessing the situation.

'Qing Jifang's strength is not to be underestimated... He has many treasures, his spell arts are extremely powerful, and he took a direct hit from the Radiant Sun King's Halberd without flinching... To completely suppress him, I'd need to be at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm with three divine abilities.'

'And if a real fight breaks out, even if I could hold him off, the other cultivators on the lake would be in grave danger...'

While Daoist Master Tianhuo continued his mockery, Zhang Duanyan smiled faintly, bowed, and said,

"He was born from a spiritual creature, after all, and has roots in the Radiant Profound Origin..."

Daoist Master Tianhuo remained noncommittal.

"Duanyan, that's a superficial way of looking at it. Qing Tangyin may be a miser, but his Dao-Profundity and schemes are not shallow. Back then, he used the Radiant Profound Origin to conceive a son, balanced it with Veiled Yin, and tried to achieve a state of harmony between yin and yang. His initial plan was to have Qing Jifang cultivate True Qi... but alas... what kind of person dares to meddle with the balance of yin and yang? Many have foolishly tried to achieve that balance in their offspring throughout history, and the results are never good... Too much Bright Yang leads to tyranny and cruelty; too much Veiled Yin leads to ugliness and cowardice. Qing Jifang is actually one of the better outcomes!"

His words gave Li Zhouwei pause, as if they sparked some association in his mind. He fell into a thoughtful silence. Daoist Master Tianhuo smiled.

"The moment the boy was born, Qing Tangyin knew it was a dead end. So, banking on his son's decent talent, he rushed him off to cultivate the Qingyi Profound Earth Daoist Tradition, to be used as a pawn by the mountain sect..."

Li Zhouwei nodded and asked probingly, "So now Mount Changhuai and the Golden Oneness are also serving a nation."

Daoist Master Tianhuo's smile slowly faded, revealing a hint of helplessness. He sighed softly and replied,

"The affairs of immortals are simply about cultivating in accordance with the times, observing the celestial calculus, and following the transformations of the Golden Position. You can't speak of serving one or another; we can only say we are following the trend!"

His words were pleasant, but Li Zhouwei knew they weren't sincere. The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition was hardly a group of reclusive cultivators. A day would come when the world would be the one following the transformations of the Golden Oneness and the momentum of the Highest Azure!

Still, Li Zhouwei replied, "The Daoist Master is absolutely right. The current changes in the Golden Position are unfolding between Shu and Song. Zhao and Yan are established in the north, and they are not the type to sit idle and do nothing. I have received the Song Emperor's decree; I wonder how many chances I will have to chat and laugh with you, Daoist Master, in the Western Mountains."

Though Li Zhouwei's words were veiled, Daoist Master Tianhuo was not the flamboyant libertine he appeared to be on the surface; he understood the question perfectly.

'What role is your Golden Feather playing in the Shu Court?'

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes were bright as he awaited his answer.

Wu and Yue were once comparable, but now they were worlds apart. To put it bluntly, the Great Song's current strength was truly pathetic. Unless the Emperor himself took action, Mount Changhuai alone was more than enough to keep the entire Song nation overwhelmed...

Daoist Master Tianhuo saw it all with perfect clarity:

'Sima Yuanli is short-sighted and overly cautious. He can be an aide, but not a pillar of support. Ning Wan is weak-willed and soft-hearted, unfit for important tasks... The Song Court has no true heroes.'

'And beyond the Song Court... Lingu has poor foundations but received heaven-defying resources, yet only produced a three-foot sprout—a laughingstock. Chen Yin defends Yuyang, but his heart is willing while his strength is weak. Sword Gate is selfish and keeps its doors closed. Although Purple Smoke obeys orders, with one sick and one young, how can they amount to anything?'

'Li Zhouwei is the empire's Treasured Artifact, but his edge has yet to be honed, and he's burdened by a killing calamity. Although Liu Bai is the Azure Jade Immortal Blade, he harbors resentment and is stuck guarding the Southern Sea. The depths of Yang Ruiyi are still unknown, but if he cannot cross the Purple Mystery, he'll be a Purple Mansion Realm mid-stage at best, just like Li Zhouwei...'

'All of them combined are barely a match for Mount Changhuai and the Nine Clans. If my Golden Feather were to enter the fray, the Song Court's border defenses would be a joke... And that's not even counting the north! The north covets Li Zhouwei even more!'

'This isn't just a problem for the Great Song dynasty. The Song has the Underworld behind it, so they can ultimately maintain control. But his Moongaze Lake is right on the river... He has no choice but to worry!'

Daoist Master Tianhuo had calculated everything perfectly, but he hesitated before answering. After a long pause, he finally said,

"The great desert has been pacified, and the immortal mountains are sealed. Many pacification departments have been set up in Golden Oneness's old lands.. The cultivators of my Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition are in seclusion and have no intention of interfering in worldly affairs. Only Daoist Master Tianque has descended to Qize. At the very least... we will have many more years to meet like this!"

Li Zhouwei understood immediately and pondered for a moment.

'So True Monarch Taiyuan has indeed joined forces with Mount Changhuai. But it will still be some time before Golden Feather enters the picture. The two sides won't come to real blows anytime soon. But in the end, a confrontation is inevitable.'

Golden Feather's goodwill may have been born of self-interest, but it was openly displayed. Li Zhouwei considered this for a long time, then suddenly raised his eyebrows and said,

"War between north and south, east and west, is imminent... The number of Purple Mansion Realm experts making a move will be the most in a century. Martial Cultivation's radiance is one thing, but the Northern Buddhists may not be the same. If the conflict between north and south reaches a point where rules are disregarded, I fear the first to be slaughtered will be those in the Foundation Establishment Realm."

Daoist Master Tianhuo shook his head. "The Martial Cultivation Star is watching from above. With your wondrous golden pupils, King Wei, have you observed anything?"

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei paused before replying, "When I observe that star, I only feel a knotted convergence of destiny and a brilliant golden light, but nothing more."

Daoist Master Tianhuo said gravely, "This star is no ordinary celestial body. It was not born for the Song, nor will it perish for the Shu. It is a manifestation of Tianwu's killing intent, and all lands illuminated by True Qi fall under its jurisdiction. As long as the Shengyang Acupoint has not been pushed into the Great Void, one is subject to this star's scrutiny and protection. Ordinary people cannot even look upon it. As you are King Wei and blessed by destiny, you are naturally immune to its taboos."

"But when ordinary cultivators gaze upon this star, they only find it dazzlingly bright, as if a raging fire is burning their hearts. It is the same for the Buddhist cultivators of the north; they feel as if swords are pointed at their backs, watched by Martial Cultivation, its power infinite... Charging through army formations is the way of martial cultivation and is not affected. But if any Merciful One were to brandish their butcher's knife and slaughter officials under this star's gaze, fate would surely come to collect its due."

"The accumulation of too much killing intent will cause the light of Martial Cultivation to descend and claim a life. In the end, some decorum must be observed."

This was the first time Li Zhouwei had heard of such a wonder, and he nodded silently. Daoist Master Tianhuo sighed.

"But that's just how it's said... If a powerful expert truly wanted to bully the weak, killing a hundred or a thousand mortals and a cultivator or two, while troublesome, wouldn't result in any major consequences... A war between nations is a war between nations. If someone truly decides to cast aside all face, how could a self-acting killing intent possibly stop them..."

His words carried a subtle reminder. Li Zhouwei acknowledged it. Daoist Master Tianhuo then changed the subject.

"But the young lords can rest assured... As the legitimate sons of King Wei, they will surely receive the full attention of Martial Cultivation. As long as they don't achieve a divine ability, their fates are protected by the Martial Cultivation Star. At most, they'll need to be wary of being besieged by Master Monks, but they won't be forcefully converted by a high-level cultivator."

Li Zhouwei was lost in thought.

'If that's the case... Jianglong and Jiangxia should be fine. Jiangqian is about to attempt his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. But Jiangchun and Que'Wan have Talisman Seeds in them; they might not be subject to this star's jurisdiction. I wonder how they appear to the outside world...'

Although he possessed a wondrous ability, he still lacked a Life Divine Ability and couldn't see things as clearly as these people. After a long silence, he finally let out a quiet breath and said politely,

"My lake has rarely seen such peaceful times. If the Daoist Master finds himself with some leisure, you are welcome to come and visit."

Daoist Master Tianhuo raised his eyebrows and looked at him intently, his expression serious.

"The world is in turmoil, with tides rising and falling. But there is no great conflict in the matters of cultivation. King Wei, you may as well invite a friend or two to discuss the border defenses. The Golden Oneness's position is sensitive, after all. The Western Mountains is as far as we can come."

He stopped abruptly, having reached the edge of the mountain. "Forgive me for not crossing the border; I cannot see you off further," he said with a smile. 

"Having seen King Wei's current bearing... this trip has already been a fruitful one."

Li Zhouwei retracted his gaze, exchanged a few more pleasantries, and waited until the two had stepped into the Great Void and departed. Only then did the smile on his face slowly fade.

'The tides rising and falling... border defenses...'

He turned back with some urgency and commanded, "Zhouda."

Li Zhouda and his men were waiting on the mountain. Hearing the call, the man quickly strode forward, bowed before him, and said respectfully, "Your Majesty!"

Li Zhouwei paced, his gaze fixed on the white mist and the cold, rainy mountain pass.

"The Shu soldiers have retreated and won't be back for a while. The Spiritual Qi in the Western Mountains is weak. Have Miaoshui lead a contingent of troops to the Guyan Temple at the foot of the mountain and repair the formations as planned."

"Yes, sir!"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow.

"Have Xinghan and the members of the Zhuang Clan been brought back?"

"They have been brought into the mountains..."

Li Zhouda replied, and listened as his older brother gave an urgent order: 

"You... have the two of them stay at Guyan and assist Miaoshui... The Zhuang Clan is still useful. Have Zhuang Pingye find some rogue cultivators at the foot of the mountain and establish a foothold."

Recognizing the unusual urgency in his tone, Li Zhouda hurried off. Li Zhouwei frowned and strode down the mountain at a casual pace. His two sons stood on the path, silent.

Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia were both at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. One wore a magnificent crown and crimson robes, the other possessed a handsome and commanding presence. They stood far apart from each other. Seeing Li Zhouwei descend step by step, Li Jianglong, who now managed the clan's affairs, took a direct step forward and said respectfully, "Father."

Li Zhouwei's expression was grave.

"Write two memorials for me. The first is a reply to the Song Emperor, expressing our loyalty. The second is to commend the Zhuang Clan for their meritorious service in defending the nation, stating that Zhuang Cheng is devoted to the Song... Request that the Song Court bestow a noble title upon the Zhuang Clan, with their fief in the great desert, so that he may guard the border."

Li Jianglong was exceptionally clever and understood immediately. Guyan Temple was at the border between the two nations, a hot potato. If the Song Emperor were to issue this decree, it would be equivalent to dispatching a portion of the Great Song's forces to garrison Guyan, which would invisibly relieve the pressure on the lake. He nodded at once, then hesitated.

"Since the Song Court has made our lake a kingdom, they see us as a buffer... This decree... might not be easy to obtain."

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"This is the first official petition from Ting Province. It's reasonable and well-founded, so the Song Court cannot refuse it, but they can delay... This is merely a test to see what the Song Emperor's intentions are toward our lake... If he truly holds some goodwill, he will have no choice but to dispatch these troops."

Li Jianglong nodded immediately.

Li Zhouwei continued, "Once you've handled this, immediately lead Chen Yang, Qu Bushi, and Li Zhoufang to the Milin Mountains. Activate the grand formation and communicate with the cultivators on the eastern shore, telling them to be ready to retreat into the mountains at any time."

Li Jianglong's expression changed instantly. He bowed slightly and hurried down the mountain. Only then did Li Zhouwei turn to look at Li Jiangxia.

Of all the brothers, this young man was the tallest and had the most imposing features. Having later trained in movement techniques and donned a suit of armor, he stood like a mountain, his expression unchanging. He said in a deep voice, "Father!"

Li Zhouwei's gaze fell upon him, his expression solemn.

"In the past, I was unwilling to let you two brothers exert yourselves because the conflict between north and south hinges primarily on destiny. I couldn't be sure some greedy senior wouldn't bully the weak. But now, we are defending the shores of our lake, and this is a national war... The north shore is yours to command. Ding Weizeng and the others will all be under your authority!"

Li Jiangxia clasped his hands solemnly and immediately went down to prepare. Li Zhouwei paced back and forth, hesitating.

'When I visited the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance a few days ago, my grand-uncle was at a critical juncture. With the help of numerous treasures, his chances of a breakthrough are quite high... If I were to forcibly call him out now, not only would all his previous efforts be wasted, but he might even be injured...'

He closed his eyes and pondered for a moment before giving an order: "Go and invite Daoist Master Sima to the lake for a discussion!"




# Chapter 1038: The Killing Formation

The river's waters churned.

Along the banks, a sea of yellow-robed monks covered the muddy flats. Several squads of red-armored cavalry thundered past, kicking up arcs of mud and water. Their long whips cracked through the air, sending the monks on either side scattering in panic.

The soldiers reined in their mounts at the base of a high platform, flanked by two golden statues. One was crimson-bodied and astride a fierce tiger; the other, with a serene face and five eyes, watched them pass with a loose, indifferent posture. The Five-Eyed Merciful One sat motionless, his expression blank.

‘That damnable Minghui!’

Five-Eyed had spent many years cultivating in the north. The incident on the lake years ago felt like a dream, yet it was a nightmare that had kept him on edge ever since. He had done everything in his power to avoid assignments that would take him south, and as a result, his strength was far better preserved than that of Chiluo on the other side. But today, a deep unease—a gnawing dread—had taken root in his heart.

‘This is a disaster! I have to go to the lake again!’

He had no grand ambitions; all he desired was a life of peace and luxury. He wanted nothing to do with these life-or-death confrontations. He raised his eyes and saw Chiluo looking utterly relaxed, which made his anger flare.

“Fool!” he spat.

Chiluo lowered his gaze to look at him, a cold sneer on his face.

“What’s this? Has Daoist brother Five-Eyed become so frightened? There are great benefits to be had in this southern campaign. With the masters leading the charge, even if we can’t slaughter the martial cultivators, what’s wrong with crushing Li Zhouwei’s prestige and seizing a few Immortal Dao artifacts? It’s all good business, isn’t it?”

Five-Eyed shot him a sideways glance.

“A hundred years of cultivation, and all you’ve cultivated is unspeakable foolishness. When have opportunities like that ever fallen to us? You think that by crushing the White Qilin’s prestige, you’ll advance further in the Buddhist Land? That Maha Nuzi… did he rise to his position by crushing someone’s prestige? And Xuwang, who now sits above you—whose prestige did he have to crush?”

The open contempt in Five-Eyed’s eyes made Chiluo frown in silence. He and this man had long been at odds, but after several major battles where Five-Eyed had managed to stay detached and navigate the chaos with ease, he couldn’t help but respect the old senior’s skill—one who had survived since the era of the Great Liang.

‘In the Buddhist Land, having a powerful backer is what truly matters… Without one, you shouldn’t be throwing your life away on the front lines…’

As he was frowning in thought, a disturbance drew his attention. A fierce wind swept across the high platform, and a man descended upon it. The armor he wore shimmered with a divine glow, and he held a short-handled crimson axe. A scar on his face writhed as he spoke.

“Great Monk Minghui!”

Five-Eyed’s eyelids twitched. He then saw the very man he had been cursing, Minghui, arriving on a ray of light. His face was fair, round, and plump, like that of an enlightened master. The Maha beside him, dressed in similar attire, was older and taller, and stood frowning without a word.

Minghui returned the greeting with a smile.

“Greetings, General Gongsun…”

This man was none other than Gongsun Bei.

The general seemed amicable enough, offering a nod. But Minghui pressed forward.

“I hear the general has a treasure in his possession. With a great battle imminent, it would be best to discuss it with us… lest we act in ignorance when the time comes and jeopardize the mission!”

Gongsun Bei stroked his beard, finding the reasoning sound. He nodded.

“Very well!”

In an instant, nearly every eye was fixed on Gongsun Bei. The general held his crimson axe in one hand and raised the other, a small platform materializing in his palm.

The platform was a pale yellow, as if condensed from the qi of earth and stone. It was no larger than his palm, yet it was exquisitely detailed with iron chains, railings, and a towering central structure, all adorned with clouds of various sizes. Looking closely, one could just make out two small, three-pronged halberds planted in the circular dais at its center, every single etching on them perfectly clear.

Gongsun Bei sighed.

“This is the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform, bestowed upon me by the Profound Governance Pavilion for this occasion. It is a Spiritual Treasure of the highest order, impervious to water, fire, light, electricity, wind, sand, clouds, and smoke. Once unleashed, it fills the sky with a million rays of Dawn Qi while the Treasure Platform remains on the ground, creating a formation to trap and slaughter our foes.”

“When its spiritual mechanism is pushed to its absolute limit, the short halberds on the platform will leap forth and fall like thunderbolts, powerful enough to shatter a man’s skull and obliterate his senses.”

Gongsun Bei’s expression turned serious.

“I have tested this item. It consumes dharma power like a river, and an ordinary person could not sustain it. Its might is truly terrifying!”

“This…” Minghui’s heart began to pound.

“Are there any restrictions or weaknesses?” he asked.

Gongsun Bei fell silent for a moment before answering vaguely,

“Ah, Dawn Qi… you know how it is. Just try to use less Profound Qi and Pristine Water, and you’ll be fine. I doubt our Daoist friend possesses the kind of immortal techniques that could counter it anyway.”

Five-Eyed watched with growing anxiety. He didn’t know that on the platform, Minghui’s mind was racing just as fast.

‘I don’t know what Qi Lanyan is thinking, raising such a massive force!’

‘According to the orders from the north, a Buddhist cultivator was supposed to lead a force through the Wilderness to attack Lixia. I already had my disciple-brother accept that mission… It was a way to minimize casualties while still appeasing the Great Adoration Dharma Realm’s request…’

He and his disciple-brother, Mingxiang, had it all planned out. Mingxiang would proceed south and cause a stir in Lixia Prefecture, ready to retreat north at a moment’s notice, staying clear of the affairs at the lake no matter what.

‘According to the master’s assessment, Li Ximing’s divine abilities can easily handle me. If I bring these two Merciful Ones along to delay him for a moment, the master will have to face the combined assault of Gongsun Bei and Taixi… But although this treasure is formidable, he also has a Spiritual Treasure of his own. He should be able to hold on…’

‘Besides, reinforcements from the south are supposed to be on their way…’

With his arrangements secretly in place, he appeared to be in high spirits. 

“Look at this weather,” he said leisurely. “A fine day for a battle!”

The horse-faced Maha next to him, however, was ugly and sullen-eyed, and ignored him completely.

“Maha seems to be in good spirits.”

Gongsun Bei, the general from Zhao State, gave Minghui a perfunctory reply and turned his attention to Taixi.

“Great Monk,” he said in a low voice, “you have been away from the palace for many years, stationed in the south. Several of the great families speak of you… They miss you dearly and are waiting for your return to the palace to pay you a collective visit.”

Taixi had once cultivated in the imperial court of Zhao and was clearly more familiar with its noble houses. He had a relationship with Gongsun Bei, who was the head of the court’s aristocratic faction, and would not slight him. He shook his head.

“The matter on the lake will be trouble for the general.”

Minghui turned his head away with a faint sneer, while Gongsun Bei’s voice grew solemn.

“It is no trouble. I came south today under the command of a revered immortal. I have made my own preparations. The Great Monk need not worry.”

This seemed to put Taixi at ease, but it sent a chill down Minghui’s spine.

‘Qi Lanyan and the noble houses have reached some kind of consensus. What other schemes have they prepared?’

But before he could take another step, a ripple went through the Great Void. A Dharma Body, pure white as snow, materialized and descended upon the platform, revealing a middle-aged monk with a stern expression. A retinue of Merciful Ones followed behind him.

“I am Yanbai,” the monk said, paying his respects. “Greetings, esteemed masters!”

Minghui was deeply shaken. He looked up at the newcomer, while Gongsun Bei showed a hint of surprise.

“Great Monk Yanbai? What is the meaning of this?”

The middle-aged monk pressed his palms together.

“By order of Mount Dayang,” he stated calmly, “I am here to take over the campaign in the Wilderness from Mingxiang. I have already been to the Xuanmiao Temple to report my duties to Qi Lanyan—he said that Great Monk Mingxiang need not report back, but should instead join the assault on Moongaze Lake.”

“...”

At these words, Minghui fell silent for a moment. Down below, Five-Eyed’s scalp went numb.

‘So now it’s the First-Generation Minghui, the Third-Generation Taixi, and the Fourth-Generation Mingxiang, plus the crucial mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Gongsun Bei… Why did this person have to show up? Damn it all!’

An extreme unease gripped Five-Eyed. Each of them under the Golden Lotus Seat was capable of tying down a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with a divine ability. Minghui and Taixi were no ordinary figures, and Mingxiang was said to be on par with a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. If it were just the Buddhist cultivators, he might have held onto a sliver of hope, but the inclusion of Gongsun Bei was a game-changer. It was as good as having three mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm experts, and the general even possessed a Spiritual Treasure specifically designed to counter the Bright Yang!

He didn’t care what happened to the White Qilin; what he feared was that the master’s backup plan would require his sacrifice!

‘Even if I were to turn on them and fight back… it wouldn’t change the overall situation much… I’d probably just be throwing my life-mandate away for nothing. That bastard Qi is really overdoing it!’

‘The Lotus Temple is truly unreliable, but this is strange… Qi Lanyan is a mountain-dwelling Daoist hermit who abstains from worldly affairs. His previous arrangements for the southern campaign were a joke. How does he suddenly have such cunning? It’s like he’s seen a ghost!’

While Five-Eyed desperately racked his brain for a countermeasure, Minghui’s face showed a look of sudden realization, though his heart had plummeted.

“We have long since arranged the manpower for our assault on Moongaze Lake,” he said with a smile. “We are moved by Daoist brother Qi’s concern, but I fear we may not have enough men to spare for other tasks!”

Yanbai had a poor opinion of Taixi, but because of a private agreement between their two Ways to minimize harm to mortals, he held some goodwill toward Minghui. He didn’t let it show, however, and his reply was blunt. Pressing his palms together, he said coolly,

“It is not concern. After hearing the report from the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple, Qi Lanyan stated plainly that the Lotus Temple is prone to treachery and cannot be relied upon. He was worried that Daoist brother Mingxiang’s true priority was self-preservation, and that he would only feign compliance.”

At this, Minghui’s expression darkened, and Mingxiang’s face hardened.

In truth, Qi Lanyan’s guess was spot on. The two disciple-brothers had indeed been planning to muddle through. But to have it exposed so nakedly was a deep humiliation. Minghui couldn’t even blame the man before him for his directness. His curses were all for one person.

‘Qi Lanyan… Qi Lanyan—that son of a bitch, Qi Lanyan!’

He turned it over and over in his mind but simply could not understand. As someone of higher standing, his suspicions took a different angle.

‘What madness has possessed Qi Lanyan? His Profound Governance Pavilion serves the mountain… but surely the mountain doesn’t wish for Li Zhouwei’s death? Impossible! They certainly want this master to continue on his path, to attempt to challenge for Fruition Attainment. For you, Qi Lanyan, to suddenly insist on killing or wounding him… how could that possibly serve the mountain’s interests?!’

Minghui felt as though his head would split, but the answer remained elusive.

All the cultivators had their motives. Why was Gongsun Bei, a cultivator of the Zhao State imperial court, so enthusiastic about this southern campaign? Why was he so meticulously prepared? It was because he cultivated Dawn Qi. Just as Dawn Qi had once destroyed the Bright Yang in ages past, he stood to benefit. Furthermore, he sought favor with the Buddhists, making him even more interested in striking down the Bright Yang…

If one or two Eighth or Ninth-Generation Buddhist cultivators wanted to kill Li Zhouwei, he could fully understand their desire to seize his destiny. But why was Qi Lanyan getting involved? Everyone knew that Wei Xuanyin had always followed the mountain’s orders, using the Bright Yang to bait out the movements of the various Buddhist sects!

‘Something must have changed his mind…’

Beside him, Taixi began to laugh with schadenfreude, assuming that his rival’s scheme against him had failed. He strolled about leisurely with his hands behind his back, throwing out occasional sarcastic remarks, but Minghui had no mind to pay him any attention.

Yanbai’s arrival had completely shattered Minghui’s plans. None of the cultivators present were blind; Mingxiang’s addition would create an overwhelming advantage in the battle. No matter how much they tried to hold back, it would be difficult to control the outcome now. Worse, Mingxiang had no idea what was truly at stake. Once the fighting grew intense, he would surely not hold back!

The addition of Mingxiang greatly pleased Gongsun Bei. He gave the two disciple-brothers a friendly nod and wasted no time.

“I ask you all to lead the charge,” he declared. “I will remain in the Great Void with my treasure, ready to seize the advantage in a single strike and suppress this fiend!”

Mingxiang clasped his hands in agreement and, taking the lead, soared into the air on the wind, a hint of eagerness in his posture. Minghui felt his head throbbing, his heart filled with a growing terror.

‘And what’s more… once Yanbai finishes in Lixia, or if he’s forced to retreat from the south, it’s highly likely he’ll come to the lake to provide support…’

---

_Dong! Dong! Dong…_

The resounding beat of war drums echoed across the river. Countless battle cries soared into the sky. A man in black robes stood on the shore, gazing into the distance at the massive, mountain-like Dharma Bodies that drifted, ethereal and indistinct, within the clouds and mist.

Brilliant, shimmering light cascaded down through the white vapor, making the battle cries below seem all the more insignificant. From within the mist, a colossal being extended its limbs and revealed a sacred, radiant golden head. Its great mouth moved.

“Mingxiang of the Lotus Temple, I greet you, Benefactor!”

The voice caused the light in the heavens to fall, a cascade of overlapping colors. The black-robed man’s expression was grave as he stood with his hands behind his back, the killing intent in his eyes deepening.

_BOOM!_

Two golden palms descended from the sky, only to be bound by surging, silk-like threads of Bright Yang light. Li Zhouwei stretched out a hand, and as rolling purple flames spread, he drew forth a halberd!

In the next instant, a familiar alms bowl appeared, and the same purple-black radiance bloomed once more as karma fire billowed from within. Li Zhouwei’s gaze turned to ice.

“Taixi…”

Taixi met his eyes directly, flinched instinctively for a second, then reacted with a surge of fury. The divine ability in his hands flared brighter as he bellowed a curse.

“Beast! You still dare to resist!”

A massive umbrella of turquoise and yellow unfurled from behind Li Zhouwei, the radiance of the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella deflecting every lick of karma fire. With a twist of his halberd, he spun around. With a clang, he parried a golden sword that had emerged from the Great Void.

_BOOM!_

Mingxiang’s golden artifact had been gathering power for some time, and their clash was evenly matched for a moment. As rolling purple fire billowed out, two more golden figures materialized on either side of Li Zhouwei. One rode a crimson tiger, the other had five eyes upon his body—both were horrifying to behold. One seized the shaft of his halberd, while the other used a mystical art to lock down its tail.

Feeling the immobilizing force on his weapon, Li Zhouwei knew at once that both were from under the Golden Lotus Seat!

At that moment, the sky far above ripped open. Minghui, who had been biding his time, appeared. He held a mirror high above his head, and a thick beam of multicolored light shot down, aimed directly at Li Zhouwei’s brow!

Li Zhouwei showed not a hint of panic. His large hand gripping the halberd tightened with explosive force. Golden patterns rippled across his arm, causing the expressions of the two Merciful Ones on either side to change at once. But his gaze pierced through the countless layers of dust and smoke, locking onto Minghui’s eyes.

That single glance sent a chill of cold sweat down Minghui’s back, but a savage grin still spread across his face.

Yet before he could utter a single taunt, before Taixi’s cry of “Beast! You still dare to resist!” had even faded from the sky, another voice, amplified by a divine ability, followed on its heels. It continued the sentiment, its cold and venomous tone spreading through the Great Void.

“With all of us cultivators gathered today, how could we possibly allow you to run rampant!”

It was the Five-Eyed Merciful One!

The sound of this divine ability overjoyed Minghui. He even found it a bit strange, but he let out a guttural, rolling laugh.

“Precisely! With both Immortals and Buddhists present, you are destined to fall here at the lake!”

As the words left his mouth, Five-Eyed silently swallowed. In the Great Void, Gongsun Bei’s expression soured. He looked from Taixi to Five-Eyed, then to Minghui, his brow furrowed as if he wanted to speak but couldn’t find the words.

‘These people are too arrogant… not a single one of them is reliable! There was absolutely no need to say that.’

_BOOM!_

A brilliant light flashed in the Great Void. Grand Ascension swept out, first knocking Five-Eyed aside. Then, with a flick of the halberd, Li Zhouwei angled it to block the cascading multicolored light!

He braced himself against the Buddhist light—immensely powerful but extremely diffuse—his gaze icy. Without a sound, he broke his stare with Minghui. His Immortal Mirror had already swept violently through the Great Void, discovering Gongsun Bei lying in wait, ready to strike!

‘Golden Feather wasn't warning me for no reason… What a grand formation.’




# Chapter 1039: Each Harbors Ulterior Motives

The curses raining down from the zenith grew louder and more furious with each passing moment. Li Zhouwei saw the crisis reflected in Minghui’s blazing eyes. He swung his halberd back, bracing it against the golden artifact descending from Chiluo, and a sudden realization dawned in his mind.

‘Mingxiang and Minghui are both from the Lotus Temple. If this man can be trusted, the threat from him is lessened. That general from the Zhao State is the real trouble.’

He surged upward, his divine ability activating as a tremendous flood of dharma power poured into his Spiritual Artifact. The Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, which had been wavering behind him in a halo of fire, snapped back into position. With a series of grinding creaks, it intercepted the barrage of lights, its own azure-yellow radiance dimming for a moment.

The respite was fleeting. In that single instant, Li Zhouwei had already mounted the Heavenly Light and charged, his halberd aimed directly at Taixi’s smug, horse-like face.

Taixi was a man who cherished his life-mandate above all else. Aware of the danger, he had been on guard from the start. Even from a great distance, the sight of that gleaming, cold edge made his heart sink. He gritted his teeth and hastily recalled the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl. Forming a seal with his hands, his lips buzzed as he incanted a spell.

"Edict!”

A brilliant flash of color materialized in his hand—a shimmering golden radiance that let out a piercing shriek as it tore through the air, diving like a hawk.

Taixi had not been idle these past years. Though the Enlightened Artifact he had painstakingly planned to forge was lost in the catastrophe at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, setting him back decades, he had managed to salvage his efforts and refine this single ray of brilliant, golden light.

Unleashing it now, the ray multiplied in the air, transforming into a thousand dazzling streams of color that swarmed toward Li Zhouwei. They struck his Dharma Body with a cacophony of sharp impacts, erupting in showers of violet flames.

“Hah!”

But as Li Zhouwei’s Heavenly Light ascended, a furious fire ignited in Minghui’s eyes. His gaze shifted. The multicolored light that had been relentlessly pounding the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, nearly bringing the Spiritual Artifact to its breaking point, now redirected without hesitation toward Li Zhouwei himself.

From each of Minghui's shoulders, a new head emerged, each with exquisite features and wide, staring eyes. They chanted in unison. One conjured a disorienting, decadent rain, while the other unleashed a bewildering, layered glow. The multicolored light intensified, cascading down with overwhelming force to suppress the Heavenly Light.

Yet, as this pressure bore down, flooding the world with brilliant color, an even more potent radiance surged from below:

_Sovereign's Perilous Tread_!

When charging, _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ possessed the power to cut through chaos and restore order. Minghui’s three spell arts, each profound in its own right, inadvertently struck a point of mystical resonance. The golden patterns on Li Zhouwei's face blazed, and his eyes shone with sudden clarity.

Being besieged by multiple opponents was only helping his fate-sense, causing the power of _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ to escalate rapidly.

The golden glimmers that had been squirming across his Dharma Body were violently thrown off. In that same instant, the Grand Ascension Halberd’s edge screamed through the air and arrived directly before Taixi’s face.

The horse-faced Maha’s pupils reflected the roiling fury of the attack. His mind was a tempest, a landslide, a tsunami.

‘Ming… hui…’

He was loath to admit his own spell arts were ineffective, but Minghui’s attack had triggered _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_. The ability to restore order had undeniably elevated his opponent’s mystical power to a higher level. It looked like a mistake, but the malicious intent behind it was as clear as day.

The Lotus Temple was proficient in Daoist methods, far more familiar with the Immortal Dao than any of the Seven Phases. To claim Minghui was unaware of the Bright Yang’s profound qualities would be utter nonsense. But infighting was rampant among Buddhist cultivators, and there was nothing he could do about it—especially not with a halberd inches from his face. There was no time to think.

Taixi, after all, was not without skill. With a grim clenching of his jaw, he spat something out from his mouth.

The object was a pristine, jade-like white. It was a skull carved from jadeite, its eye sockets deep and empty. A storm of violet lightning crackled within its jaws as it shot forward, clamping down on the halberd’s cold edge with a deafening clang.

The Grand Ascension flared with brilliance. The _Attachment_ technique activated, and a phantom-like image of the bright halberd leaped through the air, striking Taixi’s horse-head like a bolt of lightning.

“Boom!”

Heavenly Light and violet flames exploded. The massive golden body stumbled back several steps, nearly falling. The halberd instantly pulled back, only to be caught again by roiling crimson flames that appeared from nowhere, hooking onto its crescent blade and halting its movement.

“Clang!”

Beside Li Zhouwei, the light suddenly intensified. An emerald vajra scepter, engraved with Sanskrit, had silently appeared at some point. Concealed amidst the dazzling Treasure Light, it dropped without a sound.

It was a strike from Mingxiang, the cultivator with the highest cultivation in the vicinity.

Mingxiang had, of course, seen the conflict between his disciple-brother and Taixi with perfect clarity. Though he didn’t know the reason for their animosity, his loyalty was to his own. He could have intervened to block the halberd, putting Li Zhouwei in an even more precarious position. Instead, Mingxiang had deliberately waited until after Taixi took the hit before making his move, and he had chosen a lethal, offensive strike.

But the very appearance of this emerald vajra scepter made Minghui’s expression change. ‘Not good,’ he thought.

Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes flashed; he too saw it clearly. The object seemed unremarkable, yet it brought a grave look to his face. He twisted his body to dodge, simultaneously using his halberd to block while once again activating the _Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light_ on his brow.

“Hummm!”

After years of cultivation, the power of _Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light_ was gradually approaching its theoretical limit. It bathed the world in a terrifying, brilliant light. Yet Mingxiang, seated cross-legged in the sky, simply raised his hands. With his left palm facing up near his chin and his right palm facing down over his waist, he canted his body slightly and chanted:

“Three receptions, three poisons, the cardinal bonds submit. You burn your own roots of virtue; the saints offer no salvation.”

In that moment, a light from the Buddhist Land shone down, like specks of sweet dew. The _Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light_ was met with a thousand points of resistance, its glow diminishing and scattering in five directions. Bathed in the Bright Yang’s radiance, the vajra scepter broke free. After only a slight pause, it continued its descent, trailing a kaleidoscopic afterimage as it crashed down with a deafening clang.

‘His Dao-Profundity is truly high. The Lotus Temple’s mastery of both Immortal and Buddhist arts is no empty boast! And this golden artifact is likely just as formidable!’

Witnessing this exchange, Li Zhouwei was secretly stunned. He raised his halberd high, left with no choice but to meet the vajra scepter head-on.

“Clang!”

A shower of sparks erupted from the Grand Ascension’s bright, curved blade. The shaft of the halberd bent dramatically, as if bearing the weight of a colossal mountain. Countless sutras materialized on the vajra scepter, projecting phantom images in all directions.

‘A seal!’

The vajra scepter was clearly designed to suppress dharma artifacts. Its power, long accumulated, was terrifying. But at the same time, the golden patterns on Li Zhouwei’s face flared, and the color of his eyes shifted from dark gold to pure, molten gold.

_Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ responded.

As the number of his attackers suddenly increased, the blessing of the White Qilin’s fate-sense surged, amplifying _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_. The power of his Dharma Body divine ability skyrocketed, reaching one hundred and fifty percent of its normal capacity. A brilliant Heavenly Light ignited all over his body.

Li Zhouwei’s charge had been crushed by the vajra scepter before it could even begin. But now, holding the Grand Ascension in just one hand, he raised his other with lightning speed. In a sweeping motion, he snatched the golden pearl that the Five-Eyed had sent flying toward him. The piercing radiance stopped dead, barely an inch from his face, before being violently crushed.

“Screee…”

The golden pearl, still possessing a spirit of its own, creaked and groaned in his palm, struggling desperately to escape. Li Zhouwei showed no triumph, his expression only growing colder.

“Boom!”

Meanwhile, dark clouds roiled in the sky. A bolt of purple lightning descended, narrowly striking down a hidden ray of light that Taixi had concealed, causing Minghui to sigh inaudibly with relief.

‘He came prepared, too…’

Li Zhouwei had yet to use his most crucial Spiritual Treasure or _Audience with the Celestial Gate_. He had clearly understood Minghui’s hint and was still preparing to deal with Gongsun Bei. The problem was, Li Ximing was nowhere to be seen, and the cultivators from the Song Court had not arrived. These other cultivators were not to be trifled with.

Just as expected, no sooner had Li Zhouwei dealt with Mingxiang on his left than Chiluo reappeared, sword in hand and radiating killing intent. He brought his blade down in a furious chop. The Mahas were all ruthless opponents. Even with his powerful Dharma Body, Li Zhouwei found himself pinned in the air by their combined spell arts and golden artifacts.

Chiluo’s crimson-gold sword slashed down. But the divine ability within Li Zhouwei was still boiling. His immense dharma power and extraordinary Dao-Profundity all surged toward a single point. _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ activated, and somehow, through the overlapping layers of multicolored light, he managed to recall the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, raising it just in time to block.

“Clank!”

What they heard was a sharp, clear ring of metal on metal, as if something golden had been struck. The air hummed, and for a moment, the vision of every Buddhist cultivator swam.

“Pfft!”

It was the sound of Chiluo coughing up blood.

The Five-Eyed’s scalp tingled.

‘The Pure Yang Bracelets have appeared!’ he thought in horror.

Chiluo, facing the attack head-on, had never imagined that Li Zhouwei, who had been locked down by their combined assault, would erupt with such explosive force after only a few exchanges. The power of his divine ability was absurd. A chill shot through him, and the world before his eyes shattered into a million confusing pieces. His head felt like it was about to split open.

Li Zhouwei had already let go of the golden pearl. The Grand Ascension halberd snapped straight, unleashing a blast of shattered Heavenly Light. His powerful hand was now empty. He allowed Mingxiang to suppress his Spiritual Artifact, ignored the pearl as it shone with boundless brilliance, and surged forward in an all-out offensive, his hand reaching for Chiluo’s neck.

In that split second, only the Five-Eyed’s golden pearl was close enough to potentially intervene.

But the Merciful One’s eyes lowered slightly. He did not move to propel the pearl. Nor did he dare do nothing at all. Instead, a greedy light flared in his eyes. With a flick of his thumb against his knuckle, his body dissolved into light and reformed beside the golden pearl, using their connection to teleport. He clapped his palms together and aimed straight for the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, which was now isolated and powerless in the air, seeking to seize it amidst the chaos.

But the light on Li Zhouwei’s brow had already turned to darkness. For one brilliant instant, countless streams of black-gold light erupted, drowning out all other colors in the vicinity.

_Emperor Qi's Light_!

“Aaargh!”

The first to scream was, naturally, Chiluo. Struck by the Pure Yang Bracelets, his senses were in disarray, the world spinning around him. Nearby, Minghui was quietly slacking off, having released his pressure on the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella. The Five-Eyed, blinded by greed, was right behind him, trying to snatch the umbrella. Not a single person came to Chiluo’s aid.

A powerful hand clamped down on Chiluo’s neck. The black-gold light swept down from his face, and in an instant, his crimson head was mottled with countless cracks. As the hand tightened its grip, the sound of shattering glass filled the air.

“Crack!”

Chiluo’s glass-like eye was the first to go, embedded and crushed by Li Zhouwei's thumb. The hand gripping his face seemed to expand rapidly, its knuckles growing thick, its claws sharp. Countless sinister scales sprouted from the skin, tripling its power in an instant.

“BOOM!”

The Spiritual Treasure had already shredded his spirit, and now Emperor Qi's Light poured into him. _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ was operating at one hundred and fifty percent of its power. Even though Chiluo was a subordinate of the Golden Lotus Seat, his Dharma Body tempered for centuries, his head was now as fragile as any common glasswork. It exploded with a deafening bang.

“Sshhh…”

A shower of sand and glass-like fragments rained down from the sky. A Buddhist cultivator’s Dharma Body had no weak points. Chiluo’s headless body burned with a bright flame, but his entire being, down to his very bones, was riddled with the Yang Cusp power left by _Emperor Qi's Light_. His hands were still pushing against Li Zhouwei’s arm. The Merciful One was filled with a towering rage and horror, but he could only feel his Dharma Body breaking apart.

The Five-Eyed was scared out of his wits. But having already put on a show of greed, he didn't dare drop what he was holding. He could only suppress the umbrella and retreat as fast as he could, his mind reeling in terror.

‘Heavens! That’s horrifying!’

He fled for his life, his mind utterly shaken by King Wei’s decisive brutality, muttering incoherently.

‘The Buddhist Lord be… bah… the Immortal Lord be praised… we’re on the same side… same side!’

Li Zhouwei, however, had no time to spare for him. The moment he crushed Chiluo’s Dharma Body, he spun around without a shred of hesitation. Chiluo was riddled with Emperor Qi's Light, his Dharma Body ruined, but it had not come without a cost. Li Zhouwei had let go of the Grand Ascension, and the weapon was now suppressed by the emerald vajra scepter. The halberd’s tail quivered, tugged by his divine ability, constantly trying to break free, but the radiant pressure only tightened. He had no time to breathe. A single moment of relaxation would mean forfeiting the advantage he had fought so hard to win.

He activated _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ again, deflecting Taixi’s spell arts one by one, and finally managed to grab the tail of the halberd. But Mingxiang was the strongest Maha present. His reaction was just as fast. He hadn’t spared so much as a glance for the fallen Chiluo; his sights were clearly set on the Grand Ascension. He would never give Li Zhouwei the chance to reclaim it. The emerald light rapidly converged, and in the end, Li Zhouwei was a fraction of a second too slow. A jade-green glow stained the halberd, rendering it almost completely immobile.

Watching this unfold, Minghui wanted to cry his heart out. Tears of despair streamed down his face.

‘Disciple-brother… oh, disciple-brother! Do you not understand the concept of holding back? You’re going to get Master and me killed!’

But he couldn’t blame Mingxiang. The master and disciple duo hadn’t dared tell him the truth about what happened on the lake. They had concocted a story about wearing down the other Buddhist cultivators with the goal of making a profit. Naturally, Mingxiang was now focused on making a huge profit. How could he possibly let the Grand Ascension go?

A flicker of regret crossed Li Zhouwei’s eyes, but he wasn’t entirely surprised. Bracing himself against the spell arts of the Five-Eyed and Minghui, he put all his strength into one arm, his golden eyes blazing as he stared intently at the emerald vajra scepter.

“Pfft!”

No matter how much the two of them held back, a direct hit was still a direct hit. A flush of red rose to Li Zhouwei’s face as the dharma power inside him precariously completed its circulation. The golden phantom appeared once more, slamming viciously into the scepter.

“Clang!”

As powerful as the emerald vajra scepter was, it was no match for the Pure Yang Bracelets. It let out a mournful cry, as if it had been slapped hard, and flew high into the air. The emerald light pinning the halberd, deprived of its source, quickly faded. But just then, a figure materialized from the air, holding a purple bowl. He had been waiting for this moment. He swooped down and trapped the Spiritual Treasure just as its momentum died.

It was Taixi.

This man had converted from an Immortal to a Buddhist cultivator. He was utterly cunning and understood Immortal cultivators better than most. He had timed this moment perfectly. Pouring all his dharma power into the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl in his hands, his spiritual sense frantically broadcast into the Great Void.

‘General Gongsun, now is the perfect time!’

Seeing this scene, Minghui’s heart sank. A terrible premonition struck him with the force of a physical blow.

‘Li Ximing still hasn’t made a move?… Could it be… he’s not here?’

# Chapter 1040: A Desperate Gambit

The thought surfaced, sudden and persistent, unsettling him. But what truly struck Minghui speechless was his own disciple-brother, Mingxiang…

The Vajra Scepter had already been sent flying, and the Grand Ascension was about to be lost. Yet, Mingxiang merely frowned, forming a hand seal before his lips.

"By the sacred stork's profound mystery, golden cicada, fly!"

'My dearest disciple-brother... I'm begging you, stop! That thing cannot be allowed to fly!'

Minghui was frantic, his eyebrows practically singed with anxiety. But despite the turmoil in his heart, he couldn't just stand by and watch. Steeling himself, he had to add fuel to the fire. The radiance in his hands converged, and mid-motion, he summoned a stream of light shaped like a lotus blossom, which cascaded gracefully downward.

As the light fell, the entire sky filled with a pale pink luminescence, as hazy as a fine mist. It evoked a disorienting sensation of drunken dreams and blissful oblivion, a feeling of forgetting one's very home.

The illusion was secondary. The true purpose was the jade-like dew that fell from the Great Void, striking Li Zhouwei's dharma body drop by drop and raising puffs of white smoke.

Minghui's grasp of the battle was, after all, sharp. He knew that Li Zhouwei didn't care about taking damage right now; his real fear was being delayed by another spell art or Enlightened Artifact, forcing him back onto the defensive. While the spell art he had just unleashed was insidiously corrosive to the dharma body—a perfectly valid tactic—it did nothing to hinder his opponent's next move.

As expected, Li Zhouwei paid it no mind. He tightened his grip on the halberd's shaft and struck its butt with his palm, causing the jade-green light coating the Grand Ascension to shatter like icicles. Before the fragments could even scatter, the long halberd spun back into his grasp.

"CLANG!"

A thunderous roar shook the river below into a frenzy and made the assembled cultivators gasp. The entire shaft of the Grand Ascension hummed and trembled, having just plucked something from the Great Void.

The object was tiny, no bigger than a finger, yet it was a fearsome, threatening thing: a small, golden cicada. It was caught on the halberd's crescent blade, its iridescent wings releasing a fog of imprisoning power. The Grand Ascension bent taut once more under the heavy impact.

'No weaker than that Vajra Scepter!'

At this stage of the fight, Li Zhouwei's assessment was clear. Chiluo was heavily wounded and had fled. The Five-Eyed was focused on self-preservation and was no longer a threat. Minghui had already been in contact with him. The greatest danger was Mingxiang.

'His cultivation is the highest, and he has yet to use any powerful spell arts. But the two Enlightened Artifacts in his possession are specifically designed to counter Mahas and cultivators who excel at Body Divine Abilities... He strikes like a ghost in the middle of this siege... making him even harder to deal with!'

If not for his golden pupils, Li Zhouwei would never have been able to intercept the swiftly darting golden cicada.

But at that very moment, a sandstorm erupted between heaven and earth. A boundless, pale yellow dawn light descended from above. An endless expanse of gold materialized beneath Li Zhouwei's feet, forcing him to look up. His golden eyes swept around, seeing nothing but white light. In an instant, he made his decision. The Grand Ascension flipped, releasing the golden cicada.

"VMMMM!"

The Campaign Cloak behind him billowed up, wrapping around his chest like a living creature. The golden light was instantly enveloped, and despite the Grand Ascension having already dissipated much of the force, the cloak still emitted the dull sound of tearing silk.

Seizing the opening, Li Zhouwei spun around again, only to be met by a descending jadeite skull wreathed in violet lightning.

'Taixi…'

The man was using all his strength to suppress the Spiritual Treasure in his hands. He was trying to protect the golden artifact while preventing the Pure Yang Bracelets from escaping. His face had gone pale, but he was willing to pay any price to free up a hand and obstruct him for even a moment.

A battle of divine abilities could turn in the blink of an eye. This single moment of obstruction was all it would take to block his last sliver of room to maneuver, allowing the illusory platform beneath his feet to blaze with radiance and solidify.

Despite Li Zhouwei's profound cultivation, he was winded and his chest felt tight after weathering the relentless siege. Although the purple-gold thunder mace still hung unused in the sky, the Five-Eyed's spell art was about to descend, sealing off the heavens completely. Li Zhouwei could no longer access it. Left with no choice, he acted on instinct, the space between his brows flaring as he hastily deployed Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light.

"Vmmm…"

A brilliant light shot through the sky. Fortunately, he had practiced Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light for many years and had perfected it. Even when used in a rush, it instantly submerged the golden artifact, barely managing to pin it in place before him.

Yet, at such a perfect opportunity, the swirling sandstorm seemed held at bay by some unseen force, having no effect whatsoever. This stunned nearly all the Buddhist cultivators. Minghui and Taixi alike were bewildered.

Strange expressions now colored the faces of the cultivators. The most anxious among them wasn't Mingxiang, but Taixi—the horse-faced Maha was facing his mortal enemy. His face darkened as he cursed inwardly.

'What is Gongsun Bei doing?!'

He, Taixi, was giving his all, using his own body to suppress the Spiritual Treasure, his dharma power draining at a terrifying rate. Yet the dawn light between heaven and earth flashed again and again, the sands blew and blew, but the iridescent radiance just wouldn't descend!

Though all of this happened in the space of one or two breaths, in a battle of divine abilities, opportunities are fleeting. That slight delay was all it took; the chance to maneuver that Taixi had sealed off for Li Zhouwei had reappeared.

What was Gongsun Bei doing?

Li Zhouwei knew perfectly well. There was another object in the Great Void—the King Wei's Banner of Martial Governance in Ting Province, which he had acquired not long ago.

While the banner wasn't exceptionally powerful, it was an imperial standard bestowed by a emperor and possessed a certain unique quality. It had been standing silently in the Great Void, but now it sensed the threat and released surging waves of True Qi, an intertwining of water and fire that blocked Gongsun Bei's path.

Even though its primary function wasn't defense, and it was far inferior to a Spiritual Treasure, it couldn't withstand more than a few fierce attacks from the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm general. But by reflecting the Martial Cultivation Star in the sky, it was enough to delay him for an instant.

"SHRRIIIP…"

The sound from the Great Void was deafening. The bright light of True Qi flickered and rapidly shattered. A crimson battle-axe, shimmering with the light of sand and smoke, manifested its true form and clove through the radiance like a thunderbolt. The profound banner, with its violet-blue background and black-gold patterns, dimmed and fell listlessly back into the Great Void.

The general in gleaming armor finally appeared, his expression cold and solemn. He held the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform level in one hand and casually hefted the axe in the other. The scar on his face twisted as he stared down grimly.

'That profound banner resonates with the stars; it has some interesting properties. A silent ambush is no longer possible! I shouldn't move the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform rashly, lest I alert the prey and give him time to prepare... I'll pin him down first, then capture him in one fell swoop!'

Gongsun Bei had cultivated in the Zhao State for many years and had a profound understanding of the Buddhist cultivators' capacity for causing trouble. He wasn't surprised or even particularly disappointed. The conditions for using the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform weren't strict. If a surprise attack failed, it failed. He, Gongsun Bei, was more than enough to restrain Li Zhouwei on his own.

The general wasted no words. His five fingers spread, and the crimson axe vanished. He raised one hand to his chest, formed a seal, and pushed forward.

'Unending Dawnfire!'

A thick wave of dust and explosive light swept down, blanketing the entire battlefield. Faintly, it held the brilliance of a rising sun, a cold, deadly light that shone indiscriminately upon every cultivator present.

But Li Zhouwei's figure moved faster than the iridescent light. He had already broken through the obstacles, charging upward with his long halberd aimed directly at Taixi.

The horse-headed Maha's expression changed. As his opponent broke free, the Enlightened Artifacts in his hands suddenly became much harder to suppress. His heart sank into a bottomless abyss, but what added fuel to the fire was the dense azure light that now blazed in the sky.

"Who dares trespass on the soil of Song!"

A man in azure robes appeared, majestic and imposing. A scroll was tied to his waist, and a sword was strapped to his back. He strode forward on surging waves of Upright Wood light: Sima Yuanli!

This Daoist Master had clearly received news in advance and had just arrived. He didn't even have time to stop. His gaze swept the scene, and a look of apprehension appeared on his face. When he perceived the disturbance in the Great Void and Gongsun Bei's aggressive aura, the knot in his brow tightened.

'Just now, passing through Lixia, I saw Buddhist cultivators coming and going, their presence shaking the heavens. This is trouble…'

He was already on high alert, considering how to avoid getting entangled in this mess. But the opponent's divine ability had already struck. Sima Yuanli felt a searing heat on his face as his azure robes burst into flames.

'A Dawn Qi divine ability… Unending Dawnfire!'

Sima Yuanli recognized it clearly, which only confirmed the attacker's identity. And thanks to his family's legacy, he knew quite a bit about this particular art.

'Unending Dawnfire is the ancient 'Blazing Return'... It was originally established alongside the Three Yangs. But ever since the great powers deliberately inverted the Bright Yang, it has lost its blazing nature and now generates its own light!'

Seeing Gongsun Bei charge straight for Li Zhouwei, Sima Yuanli knew he had to intervene, no matter how little he understood the situation. He immediately retracted his own divine ability and raised an azure-green gourd: the Azure Grace Profound Gourd!

This treasure had been passed down through his family for generations. It was versatile, capable of manipulating both water and fire, and had a wide range of applications. The moment it was brought out, it performed a miracle.

He lifted the profound gourd, and yin and yang shifted. A grey, illusory light poured from its mouth as the Azure Radiance Pure Essence refined within was unleashed. It summoned a heaven-spanning torrent of dharma-water that first washed away Minghui's wondrous lotus rain before surging toward Gongsun Bei, cutting him off.

This scene did not escape Mingxiang's notice, causing him to frown in silence. Minghui, on the other hand, had a flash of brilliance in his eyes. If he didn't have to maintain his composure, he would have burst into tears of joy.

'You from the Sima Family… can't you ride the damn wind, or were you born without legs? What took you so long?'

'Sima Jun was late for the desert campaign, and you're late too? Dammit... it must be a family tradition! You nearly got your grandpa killed!'

Curses aside, Minghui had been saved from the brink. He found Sima Yuanli's presence quite welcome. On his face, however, he put on the classic greedy expression of a Buddhist cultivator, eyeing the Azure Radiance Pure Essence as he jeered.

"The Sima clan… showing their faces again today, are they!"

"CLANG!"

The resounding crash shook the heavens and scattered the clouds. While Minghui was enjoying his newfound freedom and putting on an act, the expression on Taixi's face had completely shattered. The Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl in his hands had reached its limit. Struck fiercely from within by the Pure Yang Bracelets, it was sent flying high into the air.

The Pure Yang Bracelets didn't have many offensive abilities. The first was Solar Bind, which could unleash a disorienting light to confuse the spiritual sense and vision. Even someone with a Life Divine Ability would be stunned for a moment. The second was Exalted Might, a simple strike whose power was linked to the number of the owner's Bright Yang divine abilities. The force was immense; even if one's golden body wasn't shattered, they would be knocked to the ground, temporarily immobilized.

This corroborated what Dongfang Lieyun had said about its origins. Furthermore, due to its unique material, the Spiritual Treasure possessed an innate quality of coming and going without a trace, its speed surpassing most other Spiritual Artifacts.

The Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl was airborne for only an instant, but the space beneath it was already empty. As Li Zhouwei's long halberd swept forward, the golden bracelets were already clasped around his own densely tattooed wrist.

'Gongsun Bei!'

Taixi roared in his heart, but as he met those blazing golden eyes, all his anger instantly turned to ice. He understood his opponent's predicament, and the resolve within it.

'Li Ximing isn't here. Sima Yuanli's arrival is helpful, but not by much. Gongsun Bei's position is exposed, but he holds a Spiritual Treasure and possesses three Dawn Qi divine abilities, making him extremely deadly. This entire assault was aimed at killing him. Based on the current situation, Mingxiang is a direct disciple of Jinlian from the Lotus Temple; his skills are profound. Even if Sima Yuanli, with his many treasures, can hold off Minghui, myself, and the Five-Eyed simultaneously, Li Zhouwei's chances against a combined attack from Gongsun Bei and Mingxiang are slim to none!'

'He needs to destroy my dharma body first, or at least wound me... only then might he have a chance to hold on in the fight to come. It's just like how he accepted a defensive position just to take out Chiluo first!'

His realization didn't come too late, but the thunder descending from afar had already pinned the jadeite skull in its original position. Before the man's long halberd even arrived, the radiance between his own brows had turned to darkness.

Emperor Qi's Light!

The Maha's glazed eyes reflected a deep color, mirroring the man at the other end of the bright halberd. The arms gripping the weapon were no longer covered by flowing, black robes with gold patterns, but by menacing armor with dark, gilded patterns.

Li Zhouwei, clad in armor and cloak, thrust his halberd forward!

The simple black robes were gone, replaced by a suit of sleek, black-and-gold armor. Every scale, etched with profound patterns, rippled with complex, flowing golden light, as if it were breathing. The pauldrons on his shoulders were a dark gold, emitting a dazzling, divine glow.

The vambraces were elegantly simple, marked only with the faint outline of a lunging qilin. Their smooth, dark-gold surface reflected on his hands, the light flowing down the halberd's shaft and scattering.

Outside the armor, the Campaign Cloak fluttered gently, making his shoulders seem broader. The tip of every Yuse feather was tinged with a faint purple, and its dark-gold patterns perfectly complemented the scales on his armor, creating a unified whole.

All the iridescent light poured into the long halberd. Li Zhouwei's eyes turned an almost brilliant, golden-white. Behind him, Gongsun Bei's Dawn Qi divine ability, Unending Dawnfire, descended, erupting in bursts of Dawn Qi flames on his Campaign Cloak. The Bright Yang radiance on him dimmed and flared, yet the young man seemed completely unaware.

At this moment, with Gongsun Bei's appearance, the power of Sovereign's Perilous Tread finally reached its peak, perfectly aligning with his fate and boosting his power by a terrifying ninety percent!

In an instant, a black-and-gold radiance submerged Taixi, plunging him into an endless darkness. But in the zenith above, a glorious scene of light had unfolded. A gleaming white Celestial Gate had risen.

Dragon banners and phoenix chariots danced and circled, a riot of color. Countless figures in golden armor floated in the sky, a stark contrast to the darkness enveloping him. But as the brilliant halberd descended, this expanse of light began to rapidly press in on the infinite darkness, falling toward Taixi's head.

'So, it was waiting here for me all along!'




# Chapter 1041: The Battle Ends

Audience with the Celestial Gate descended from the heavens, wreathed in roiling, iridescent flames. The Maha’s face was a mask of terror. Gritting his teeth, his body swelled rapidly in mid-air as he thrust his golden palms upward, forced to meet the attack head-on.

“Clang!”

The divine ability was undeniably cumbersome, but the moment it struck, an overwhelming suppressive force washed over him. His hands seemed to melt, sinking under the weight as an inferno of vibrant flames engulfed his body.

He was completely immobilized.

His golden form, as massive as a mountain, flickered and dimmed within the black-gold radiance of the Emperor Qi's Light. At this critical juncture, two more arms sprouted from Taixi’s back, clasping together before his chest to reveal a soft, pink luminescence glowing between his palms.

This pink light bloomed like a lotus flower, revealing countless silver specks within, like the flower’s stamens.

The Secret Art of Defiant Rebirth!

The Way of Emptiness was, after all, one of the Seven Phases. Even though the Daoist Tradition had collapsed when its ancient Dharma Master attempted to advance further, only to succumb violently to his own ego, and the entire Kosa Temple Sect had perished with him, their esoteric arts and secret texts had survived through the ages. Taixi, having cultivated for many years, had naturally picked up a technique or two.

As the lotus blossomed, the immense repulsive force it generated was completely neutralized by Sovereign's Perilous Tread. Yet, another stream of light erupted from its center, surging forward like a torrential river.

But Li Zhouwei was prepared. His old suit of armor, the Primal Summit Armor, had been reforged by Dingyang Zi into a true Spiritual Artifact. The process had been long and costly, and Li Zhouwei had kept it in reserve for this very moment. How could he possibly allow Taixi to cast another spell?

The black-gold armor instantly erupted with boundless, colorful flames. Surging umbral fire coiled around his body, making him appear several times larger as a baleful, demonic light gathered upon the tip of his halberd.

Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body!

The searing light of Profound Qi, imbued with a power that sundered all Dharma Arts, instantly diminished the lotus’s glow by a third. In the next moment, the golden, profound markings on the armor itself flared to life!

‘Divine Art: Pivotal Radiance.’

Illusions swarmed around Taixi. A brilliant, setting sun appeared in a vast and desolate landscape filled with the cries of battle. A searing crimson light materialized from nothingness, descending wrapped in the splendor of the Emperor Qi's Light and crashing down upon the lotus!

Taixi’s expression changed drastically. He urgently tried to recall the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl, but the shadow of karmic fire flickered into existence. A golden afterimage had already returned—the Pure Yang Bracelets descended, smashing violently against the bowl!

Without Taixi’s support, how could the mere demon-pacifying bowl possibly contend with the Pure Yang Bracelets? It was sent flying with a mournful wail.

Taixi was already struggling to fend off the Emperor Qi's Light with the bowl. The brutal impact sent a shock through their spiritual connection, and he let out a muffled grunt. Straining to maintain the spell in his hands, he was caught off guard and could no longer block the crimson light. The magnificent lotus instantly shattered with a deafening blast.

“Crack!”

The sound of shattering glass echoed as the halberd, like a venomous serpent, plunged into the chest of Taixi’s golden Dharma Body.

“BOOM!”

A cloud of lotus-pink dust and radiant, glazed light erupted from the wound, only to be instantly incinerated by the surging umbral flames. Taixi’s two hands snapped together, clamping down on the Grand Ascension.

But the long halberd wavered, held by no one!

Taixi’s eyes shot open. The Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body had already coalesced in the air above into a six-armed demon. The Profound Yellow Qi, differentiated from the Profound Qi, flooded the space around it as its six arms merged into one, gripping a massive battle-axe.

The axe was a deep, heavy brown-gold, its surface etched with a gleaming qilin pattern. Its bright white blade radiated an aura of terrifying, absolute sharpness.

It was the Radiant Sun King's Halberd!

“Clang!”

A jade skull, having finally arrived from its journey through the Great Void, appeared in front of the axe to block it. It lasted only long enough to produce a sound like shattering glass. The light paused for a bare instant before continuing its descent unimpeded.

Audience with the Celestial Gate trembled violently. For a moment, the sky above the entire lake shore blazed with light. Intense Heavenly Light flooded every corner, and the cultivators locked in combat high above were struck blind. Their flying dharma artifacts shuddered and began to plummet from the sky like dumplings dropped into a pot.

Taixi’s colossal body shattered. The enormous axe blade clove through him from his left shoulder to his ribs, splitting him clean in two. Boiling white steam rose from the ground as the massive golden form fell from the sky, crashing uncontrollably by the riverbank.

But Audience with the Celestial Gate was still pressing down!

High above, the Maha Mingxiang lowered his gaze slightly, his hands forming a seal.

‘Disciple-brother should be satisfied now.’

Though everything had happened in a flash, Mingxiang was not powerless to intervene. But why should he, the esteemed second disciple-brother of the Lotus Temple's Way of Joyful Bliss, save a Maha from the Way of Emptiness? Especially one who clearly harbored a deep enmity for his own junior.

While he didn't step in, he hadn't been idle. He had timed everything perfectly. A brilliant radiance gathered at his fingertips, and with a gentle flick, it shot forth.

On the other side of the battlefield, the churning river waters were violently parted. The general, Gongsun Bei, also wielded an axe. He cleaved through a gourd that blocked his path and rode the wind to press his attack, his brow etched with killing intent. His gaze was fixed unwaveringly on the Radiant Sun King's Halberd in Li Zhouwei’s hand.

A cyan jade bottle engraved with dazzling patterns suddenly fell from the sky. Gongsun Bei raised two fingers to the space between his eyebrows, focusing his dharma power to project a ray of clear light.

‘Plea to Supplant the Night.’

Bathed in this radiance, the jade bottle underwent a wondrous transformation. Seizing the moment when Li Zhouwei was fully committed to his assault, it tipped over, and a single, emerald-green droplet, like liquid jade, fell from its mouth.

“Drip!”

The moment the bead fell, a gloomy, sunless wind began to blow. The very air grew chaotic as a chilling rain fell, altering the flow of ambient qi. The Heavenly Light that had saturated the riverbank was suddenly suppressed and weakened, as if the remnants of night had been crossed, transforming it into a tranquil, blue-green light of the Lesser Yang that settled upon the land.

The overwhelming splendor of Audience with the Celestial Gate dimmed. The phantoms of phoenixes and luan birds vanished, and the golden-armored celestial soldiers and generals collapsed into dust. Li Zhouwei had already withdrawn his halberd and turned. Facing the incoming divine ability, he took a step forward to meet it, but instead staggered back as if drunk, coughing up a mouthful of blood.

“Cough, cough…”

A brilliant, lotus-shaped light clung stubbornly to the space between his eyebrows. Mingxiang’s expression grew grave. He exerted his power as if trying to restrain a ferocious beast, his usually calm face flushing slightly as his composure broke for the first time.

This gave Gongsun Bei the opening he needed. He strode forward, his red axe held high, and brought it down in a vicious arc!

Even at this point, Li Zhouwei refused to lift Audience with the Celestial Gate.

Taixi had been cleaved in two and his Dharma Body was shattered, but his spiritual consciousness, anchored to his ruined form by the Secret Art of Defiant Rebirth, refused to let his True Spirit return to the Buddhist Land. His heart was consumed by such extreme hatred that he would not yield!

‘He schemed against me… he just had to scheme against me! So many hidden trump cards… with a single axe! Just a single axe!’

His mind was a whirlwind of terror and madness.

‘You destroyed my Dharma Body, so I’ll be damned if I let you get off easy!’

The Secret Art of Defiant Rebirth was the ultimate life-saving technique of the Way of Emptiness. It used one’s connection to fate to preserve the spiritual consciousness and True Spirit within a cultivator’s remains, allowing one to survive a calamity and later be reborn from the corpse, a miraculous method that saved the immense cost of reincarnation. But Taixi knew that none of his supposed allies in the sky wished him well. Otherwise, how could he have ended up in this state? Who would bother to look after his remains?

Since reincarnation was no longer an option, his thoughts turned even more malicious.

‘I’ll detonate my remains with a sacred art and cripple your divine ability!’

Yet, the instant this thought formed, a profound terror arose within his True Spirit. A faint vision flickered before him: the stars in the sky were gazing down at him with cold indifference. He finally understood.

‘The battle is taking place by the river, which is teeming with mortals and low-level cultivators. There was a reason Li Zhouwei suppressed me here… He was waiting for me to self-destruct! He wanted me to harm countless innocent lives so the Star of Martial Cultivation would descend to punish me!’

The dawning fear, however, could not extinguish the venom in his heart. Believing he had seen through his opponent’s plan, Taixi felt a wave of smug satisfaction and watched with cold eyes.

‘He definitely doesn't know I have the Secret Art of Defiant Rebirth. Mingxiang and Gongsun Bei are fighting, so he absolutely has to recall Audience with the Celestial Gate! When he does, whether I choose to harm him or save myself will be entirely up to me!’

As the remnant on the ground spun his webs of intrigue, Li Zhouwei simply endured his discomfort and began forming hand seals. The light between his brows surged like a flood, only to be swiftly cut apart by the red axe, which was wreathed in the protection of the Dawn Qi divine ability. It bought him only a single instant.

He had no idea what Taixi was plotting on the ground. To him, under the scrutiny of the Immortal Artifact, the situation was perfectly clear. The man still refused to abandon his physical shell. Perhaps he had simply grown tired of living and was waiting for death.

Whatever his opponent's scheme, Li Zhouwei had only one response.

In that same moment, Sima Yuanli, who was being besieged by two Buddhist cultivators, heard a sharp and commanding voice ring in his ear.

“Daoist friend Sima! Lend me the Huai River Map!”

Upon hearing the call, the middle-aged man in green robes had a flash of understanding. His expression hardened as he reached for the Spiritual Treasure at his waist and untied it.

The movement was subtle, but how could the Buddhist cultivators under the effects of the divine ability not notice? Taixi, still clinging to his ruined body, was jolted to his senses. His mind reeled as if the heavens were falling.

‘Oh, hell! Damn it all to hell!’

Wait? What was there to wait for?

If he waited any longer, he would truly be dead!

The cautionary tale of Nu Xiao was fresh in his mind. Taixi was scared out of his wits. To hell with revenge, to hell with everything else! He couldn't even detonate his own body. All thoughts of enmity were but floating clouds in the face of annihilation. He decisively released the Secret Art of Defiant Rebirth, allowing his True Spirit to return to the Buddhist Land!

But in that exact, fleeting moment—in that split second—Sima Yuanli hesitated.

He paused for the briefest of instances. The scroll at his waist finally flew up, transforming into a colossal city wall that stretched across the sky. It shone with a thousand brilliant lights as it moved to intercept the jade bottle.

By then, however, Taixi’s mangled corpse had already collapsed. His point of True Spirit flashed through the Great Void like a reflection in a mirror before vanishing softly into the infinite darkness. On the other side, the battle-hardened Gongsun Bei would not grant his opponent a moment of hesitation. He strode forward, completely abandoning the jade bottle in the sky, and shoved the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform forward—a weapon he had held in reserve until now. Instantly, the entire battlefield was flooded with rolling waves of Dawn Qi!

Li Zhouwei’s face remained calm, but inwardly, he sighed heavily.

‘Sima Yuanli! Your mind is too clouded with trivialities… You’ve ruined my great plan!’

Li Zhouwei’s shout had carried several meanings, and he had guessed eight or nine-tenths of Sima Yuanli’s thoughts. The Huai River Map was an object of immense importance. If it fell into Li Zhouwei’s hands, even if only borrowed, its connection through the threads of fate could make its true ownership… uncertain.

Li Zhouwei had no intention of stealing it, but the situation on the field was deteriorating rapidly. Even with Taixi gone, their side was at a disadvantage. Gongsun Bei possessed a treasure that suppressed enemies with Dawn Qi. Even if Li Zhouwei managed to escape, he would have to pay a steep price. A Spiritual Treasure like the Huai River Map would make the perfect sacrifice to ensure his getaway.

If Sima Yuanli had retained control of the map, he would not have been stingy, using it to retreat at a moment's notice. But when combined with the potential for a power struggle against the Bright Yang Dao, Sima Yuanli had hesitated. In the end, he chose to use the Huai River Map to defend against the Spiritual Artifact and aid Li Zhouwei.

This could loosely be interpreted as “lending the Huai River Map,” but it undoubtedly caused the battlefield situation to worsen.

‘Sima Yuanli isn't normally an indecisive man. If he were, he wouldn't have rushed here without even stopping to rest, ignoring the Song court’s decree… He lacks true boldness. Too much petty thinking…’

‘Well, at least I managed to scare Taixi away. That’s one less thing to worry about!’

Fighting off a wave of intense dizziness, Li Zhouwei felt a pang of regret but did not waste energy on blame. He forced himself backward, raising the Grand Ascension to defend. Axe and halberd clashed. A brilliant light flared, only to be swiftly extinguished.

Gongsun Bei was no common foe. Li Zhouwei was still contending with Mingxiang’s pressure and now lacked support. He had raised his halberd in haste, with the enemy holding a clear advantage. In the end, he could not parry the blow. The red axe swept the Grand Ascension aside and struck him square in the chest.

The first thing to flare up was the surging umbral flame. The dense Profound Qi of the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body produced an unexpectedly miraculous effect, neutralizing the bulk of the divine ability’s radiant power. Only then did the light of the armor itself shine forth.

This suit of Primal Summit Armor had been utterly transformed. Its second divine art, the one that came after ‘Pivotal Radiance,’ activated, causing his entire body to flash with the light of the Yang Cusp.

‘Primal Molt!’

Li Zhouwei’s face flushed a deep crimson as he coughed up another mouthful of blood. The Yang Cusp light on his armor flickered, but it had greatly mitigated the force of the divine ability. Moreover, he rode the burst of light to propel himself away, throwing the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform into disarray. For a moment, it couldn't lock onto his position.

‘You think you can run?’

Gongsun Bei was already prepared. He once again touched two fingers to the space between his eyebrows. The cold, clear light of ‘Plea to Supplant the Night’ shone down again, instantly and completely dissipating the layers of Yang Cusp light around Li Zhouwei.

But in the instant ‘Primal Molt’ had activated, Li Zhouwei was already charging forward. In concert with the immediately responding Sovereign's Perilous Tread, he shattered all the restraints around him and shot directly toward Mingxiang!

Mingxiang raised a hand to intercept him, but his heart suddenly stirred, as if he were listening to a distant voice. The mudra his hands were forming naturally shifted. The monk raised an eyebrow, his gaze shifting to the distant, calm-faced Gongsun Bei, who had just shaken a talisman from his sleeve.

Talisman of the Pacified Frontier and Boundless Night!

An overwhelming torrent of cold light poured down, but it wasn't aimed at Li Zhouwei. Instead, it swarmed into the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform, causing it to shine with infinite brilliance. It locked onto Li Zhouwei from afar and descended upon him.

For a moment, the sky was ablaze with light. The pale golden platform enveloped the heavens. Two short halberds soared out from it like a pair of wild geese, moving with a deceptive speed that was both slow and fast. At the very edge of the platform, they finally intercepted the long halberd.

“Clang!”

Li Zhouwei gripped his weapon tightly, watching as the sky was rapidly sealed by Dawn Qi. He finally let out a long breath. The Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body swelled, transforming into a ferocious, jet-black demon wreathed in raging umbral flames. Pushing back against the heavy golden chains raining down from above, his voice echoed, deep and resonant:

“The Northern Cultivators and Northern Buddhists have truly gone to great lengths. This king shall see for himself just how capable General Gongsun truly is!”

Gongsun Bei’s gaze was cool and calm. “It is my mission,” he said in a low voice. “I have no choice but to be meticulous.”

The platform in the sky became a uniform color as a pale yellow light screen enveloped all Heavenly Light. Gongsun Bei and Li Zhouwei were both submerged within it. Mingxiang sighed under his breath and rode his lotus platform into the light screen as well, after which all color and sound vanished completely.

Sima Yuanli saw it all happen, and a sense of dread filled his heart. Fearing the worst, he redoubled his attacks, unleashing his treasures with even greater ferocity. Yet Minghui and Five-Eyed were both clearly distracted. He was somehow pressing them both back single-handedly, putting them in constant peril.

As the Huai River Map slammed down, Five-Eyed was finally jolted back to his senses. The profound umbrella he had been suppressing with all his might was suddenly loosened. A rope had materialized from nowhere and bound it. With a sharp tug, the umbrella was ripped from his grasp.

As he pulled the treasure in, Sima Yuanli was drenched in cold sweat, his heart pounding with relief.

‘Just making up for my earlier blunder…’

Unexpectedly, the Merciful One’s face twisted in rage, but inwardly, he too felt a wave of relief. He began to wail and cry to the heavens.

‘Immortal Venerable above… I didn't do it on purpose!’

Just then, at that precise moment, streaks of white qi shot across the sky. A golden Dharma Body, glowing with pure white light, descended from the heavens, bringing with it a blinding radiance that drew the gaze of every person present. They all felt a collective jolt of shock.

This Maha arrived riding the wind, his expression solemn and majestic, his tone as cold as ice.

“Fellow Daoists, Yanbai has come to assist!”

But as this Maha from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm surveyed the scene, he saw Five-Eyed gritting his teeth at Sima Yuanli while Minghui chanted sutras with his head bowed, his fists clenched tight. They were all completely absorbed in their own affairs, as if they had no time to spare him a glance. A strange feeling crept into Yanbai’s heart.

‘How odd,’ he thought to himself. ‘Why is the atmosphere here so bizarre…’




# Chapter 1042: The Scourge of War

Clouds churned in the sky as Sanskrit chants flowed through the air. Rainbow lotuses bloomed amidst an interplay of radiant light, and the vague, colossal shape of a gilded form shifted within the haze, casting an immense shadow upon the earth.

A violent gale swept across the land. A man in blue robes, his chest pierced by a golden spear, tumbled through the chaotic winds. Behind him, a Master Monk closed in fast, his wild laughter echoing through the air.

The man coughed up blood, his heart turning to ice.

‘It’s not just the ferry crossing… The entire riverbank is swarming with Buddhist cultivators…’

Chen Jinxi had been tasked with defending the riverbank alongside Li Minggong, but the sheer number of Master Monks pressing south had already made their stand a desperate struggle. Then, halfway through the battle, a contingent of Zhao State soldiers had charged in from the flank. Clad in iron armor with the unmistakable ruggedness of the great desert, these soldiers were incredibly strong. Most were at the Qi Refining level, led by Foundation Establishment cultivators. They had deliberately bypassed the positions held by Li Minggong and Ding Weizeng to break through the side—they had even used an array-breaking talisman.

The ferry crossings were lightly defended to begin with, relying entirely on the swift support of Foundation Establishment masters. The moment the flanks were breached, the line collapsed. Seeing the crossings to her left and right fall, Li Minggong knew the situation was hopeless and ordered a full retreat.

Chen Jinxi was no fool; in fact, he was quite clever. He understood the disparity in strength between the northern and southern forces and had been cautious throughout his flight. But he never could have anticipated a gilded form plummeting from the sky as he retreated. A divine ability like that might mean little to a true master, but when it crashed to the ground, it was no different from a falling mountain—and it could crush people to death. Chen Jinxi barely escaped being flattened, but the faint connection he had with the White Ape instantly shattered. He lost sight of Li Minggong and was hounded relentlessly westward.

He hadn't been a Foundation Establishment cultivator for long. How could he possibly fend off the focused attention of several Master Monks? He had fled for dozens of miles, but his body was already riddled with wounds from their golden artifacts. Blood poured from his mouth as he looked up in despair.

‘Where did the others retreat to? Don’t tell me the fighting has reached the lake…’

Below, the din of battle was deafening. The clash of golden arms and spiritual iron was a constant ring, and where the two armies met, flesh and blood flew. Just as Chen Jinxi gave in to despair, his eyes caught a flicker of movement. In the distance, a man in bronze armor stood in a pool of blood, a battle-axe in each hand. The blades, stained with gore, pulsed with a dense, crackling lightning.

‘Li Zhouda!’

It didn't matter that this tempestuous direct descendant of the Li family, the one in charge of Qingdu's affairs, had offended countless outsiders. It didn't matter how many times he had forced the Chen Clan to bow their heads. The moment Chen Jinxi saw him, tears streamed down his face.

‘Finally, a friendly face! He’s carrying powerful treasures! He can definitely save me!’

A low hum resonated as a blood-escape art rapidly consumed his vitality. Chen Jinxi felt his vision swim, his breath catching in his throat. As the scene came into focus, his heart leaped.

Li Zhouda was trapped. Golden hooks had sunk into his axes, their thick chains held taut by a Master Monk on either side, locking his weapons in place. Yet the man seemed unconcerned. A bronze bell hovered above his head, crackling with responsive lightning as if warding something off. With a powerful contraction of his muscles, he expelled an arrow from his chest and glared fiercely at the enemy before him.

Li Zhouda always fought on the front lines. He was no stranger to such injuries; they had honed his combat skills and forged his formidable physique. He raised his axes high, pulling the two Master Monks off-balance, and brought them crashing down.

_BOOM!_

A wave of thunder erupted. But Chen Jinxi had no time to celebrate. A chilling presence was closing in from behind, and his heart seized with terror.

“My lord, save me!” he shrieked.

The sudden cry made Li Zhouda snap his head up. The fierce warrior’s expression shifted instantly to one of shock and alarm.

Without a second thought, the burly man roared and leaped into the air, directing the thunder bell above him to shield the approaching Chen Jinxi.

But he was a fraction of a second too late. The instant Chen Jinxi’s plea left his lips, a figure appeared before him. Clad in silver-white armor and holding a blood-red axe high, the newcomer stared at him with a look of cruel amusement.

‘Peak Foundation Establishment…’

In the next moment, the bloody axe fell. Chen Jinxi's face, which bore a strong resemblance to Chen Yang's, twisted into a mask of pure horror. His skull split open with a sickening crack. Illuminated by the thick glow of Dawn Qi, his brain matter splattered outwards. The ghastly scene was accompanied by a harsh grinding sound and the splash of fluid.

“Urk!”

A horrifying scream escaped from what was left of Chen Jinxi’s tongue as his left hand scrambled to grab the right half of his bisected body. A brilliant, pale-yellow light burst forth from the clean-cut cross-section of his torso.

_SPLAT!_

A torrent of black blood rained down, drenching Li Zhouda from head to toe. The warrior coughed twice as another golden artifact slammed him back to the ground. Fighting the urge to collapse, he spat out a mouthful of clotted blood and wiped a hand across his breastplate.

In his blood-soaked palm lay two shattered white teeth. Their texture was slowly turning gray, rapidly transforming into river stones with the passage of time.

Li Zhouda stared blankly. Though he and Chen Jinxi had never been close, his eyes burned with rage. A sharp voice cut through his daze.

“My lord, it’s time to go!”

A pillar of Pit Water light shot into the sky, shredding a tattered robe into a storm of ash. The sudden brightness illuminated the grim face of Li Jiangxia nearby. The tall young master stood majestically among the cultivators, drenched in blood, his expression dark as he tossed a severed head to the ground.

He was here as reinforcement.

The bald head rolled across the dirt, its eyes still wide open, staring greedily at Li Zhouda. Finally letting go of his twin axes, Li Zhouda threw out a talisman and rose into the air on a gust of wind.

Li Jiangxia supported him, casting a cold glance back. The axe-wielding Gongsun cultivator paid the escaping men no mind, instead pointing at the brain matter on the ground and boasting to his comrades.

Li Zhouda coughed up more blood but remained silent. As Li Jiangxia turned, a group of cultivators rushed to assist them.

“Uncle… take this medicine, quickly!”

They fell back into the formation, and Li Jiangxia released the burly man. A woman at his side immediately draped a cloak over his shoulders.

Although Li Jiangxia had no sons, nor any woman he deemed worthy of being his wife, his household was filled with female relatives. Several now crowded around him, their faces etched with concern. He waved them away, his gaze fixed on a high-platform Spiritual Treasure hanging in the sky.

The battle had become a river of blood. The number of monks and Master Monks from the north who had fallen here was beyond counting. Li Jiangxia himself had slain three Master Monks, but the Buddhist cultivators fought without fear of death, and demonic cultivators exploited every opening. The tide of the battle was slowly turning against them.

The shadow of the gilded form in the sky passed over him. A jade ring in his sleeve, which had gone dark, lit up once more. Li Jiangxia’s heart sank.

‘Only the western ferry, defended by Guest Retainer Ding, is still holding… The arrays at the other five crossings have been shattered. I can’t let the Guest Retainer keep fighting there… If his rear is cut off, he’ll be trapped…’

The young master lifted his sleeve and tapped the jade ring. The last point of light on it dimmed. Soon after, a commotion erupted from the west as the ground began to tremble. Ding Weizeng was fighting his way back.

Their forces on the lake had already suffered heavy losses. With several crossings falling at once, demonic cultivators had poured deep into the northern bank at multiple points. Li Jiangxia estimated that in the worst-hit areas, the enemy had already torn through more than half of the northern shore.

‘Father is trapped by that Spiritual Treasure… If this battle drags on, we’re doomed…’

His heart heavy, he activated the dharma artifact in his hand, unleashing a burst of Bright Yang light that forced a group of Master Monks back. His golden eyes were frigid. A sudden thought struck him.

‘There’s trouble in the Wilderness, too… The Song Court’s army could already be in Lixia Prefecture…’

“Young Master!”

As he was contemplating, a figure rode the wind from the south and landed before him. His face was stern as he bowed his head.

“Nantanchen pays his respects to the Young Master…”

Nantanchen bowed low. Li Jiangxia, though not well acquainted with him, knew he was stationed on the eastern bank. He raised an eyebrow.

“What of the Milin Mountains?!”

Nantanchen spoke quickly. “The Buddhist cultivators crossed the Wilderness and are attacking Lixia, so there wasn't much pressure on the eastern bank. Our commander was gathering intelligence and ordered us to reinforce the river first!”

Li Jiangxia’s heart stirred. His guess had been right. He scanned the cultivators behind Nantanchen and his eyes suddenly fell upon a familiar, observant youth. He frowned.

“Suining… what are you doing here!”

Li Suining stepped forward, his expression grave. “Demonic cultivators have repeatedly slipped onto the lake. The elders know the situation on the northern bank is dire. Brother Suihuan has received orders to prepare the disciples to defend the shore. I came ahead to report to you, my lord.”

Li Jiangxia was momentarily speechless, then shook his head. “It hasn't come to that… The key is King Wei. From the sounds in the sky, I think Gongsun Bei has arrived!”

Li Suining’s face remained calm, but as he stared at the massive Spiritual Artifact that blotted out the sky, his eyes reflected the rolling glow of Dawn Qi, and his mind was in turmoil.

‘Dawn Qi,’ he thought. ‘It really is him!’

‘Gongsun Bei… During the founding war, he was supposed to be guarding Shanji. Why is he at the lake? And since when was there a massive Spiritual Treasure that could suppress the heavens?’

As the colossal gilded form shifted overhead, its shadow once again enveloped them. A deep sense of foreboding washed over Li Suining.

‘In my past life, no demonic cultivators ever made it onto the lake. The riverbank was in peril, but our forces never let the Buddhist cultivators cross the river. This means… it was the Zhao State army brought by Gongsun Bei that changed the situation.’

‘How is that possible? Gongsun Bei acts on orders from the Zhao Court and the Profound Governance Pavilion… Why would those orders change overnight?’

All Li Suining had changed was the fate of Ding Weizeng. No matter how hard he wracked his brain, he couldn’t understand why a figure as significant as Gongsun Bei—a Zhao State general with a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability—would suddenly appear at the lake. A cold dread filled his heart. Li Jiangxia, lost in his own thoughts, finally spoke.

“Fine… You all will go to the Milin Mountains for me! Guest Retainer Sun is busy treating Elder White Ape and can’t be spared. Take my uncle back with you to recuperate!”

Li Jiangxia was well aware of who Li Suining was. On a battlefield where fortunes could turn in an instant, even Foundation Establishment cultivators could be surrounded and killed, to say nothing of those at the Qi Refining level. He pulled the younger man closer, his tone serious.

“The northern bank is dense with forests and has little farmland. Even if the Buddhist cultivators scorch it a few times, the loss won't be great. But if our lines break, Foundation Establishment cultivators can still escape, while any lower-level cultivators on defense will be completely wiped out. Whether it’s the Milin Mountains or the lake, we cannot send any more troops here!”

The cultivators were stunned to hear how dire the situation had become. Li Jiangxia, however, was unfazed.

“The defense of the Milin Mountains is paramount. Tell Li Jianglong to hold his position. I was observing the battle in the sky just now and saw a Maha retreating from Lixia. It's highly likely the Song army has reached the prefecture. Make this clear to Li Jianglong—if an opportunity arises, he can boldly lead his troops out from the eastern bank and cut off the Zhao soldiers’ retreat!”

Li Suining was shocked. He couldn't believe Li Jiangxia still possessed such an aggressive spirit in such a desperate situation. He stared at him for a moment. A cold smile touched Li Jiangxia’s lips.

“Just deliver the message. If Li Jianglong proves incompetent, he can't blame me for it.”

Li Suining hurriedly bowed and helped Li Zhouda to his feet. Only then did he truly notice that the man was covered from head to toe in bloody wounds. Shards of glittering golden artifacts were still embedded in what was left of his armor.

“…Grand-uncle Zhouda!”

Li Zhouda shook his head, his face a grim mask. Bathed in a cold sweat, Li Suining turned and rode Nantanchen's magical wind south. His heart pounded in his chest. As the Milin Mountains rose before them, Nantanchen descended swiftly. A young man in black robes was pacing anxiously among the trees.

He had handsome eyes, sharp brows, and intense golden pupils. His bearing was first-class. It was his fourth brother, Li Suihuan.

If Li Suining possessed a kind of gloomy coldness, then Li Suihuan was the perfect embodiment of the grace of the Purple Mansion Realm's direct lineage. His golden eyes were bright, his stride powerful. Even in his anxiety, he maintained an air of composure—not the overbearing pride of a typical noble house, but the ethereal aura of one with the blood of a divine ability.

Though he was the eldest son of Second Uncle Li Jianglong, this fourth brother’s personality was more akin to Third Uncle Li Jiangxia’s. He strode towards them, and though he said nothing, the gravity in his nimble eyes spoke volumes.

Before Li Suining could speak, Li Suihuan rushed to take Li Zhouda from him. He gasped at the man's condition and said in a low voice, “Brother, you’re too late. Cries of battle have erupted in the south. Our forces were defeated and are retreating. Father has already led his men into the fray!”

The words Li Suining had been about to say died in his throat. He paced frantically for a few steps, then noticed his hands were wet. Just from supporting Li Zhouda for a moment, they were now completely covered in blood.

“The young masters are no ordinary men. As long as King Wei is safe, this situation is still manageable,” Li Zhouda said, his voice hoarse. His beard was matted with blood, but he paid it no mind. He took a few steps forward, looking towards a middle-aged man sitting in a nearby pavilion.

This man was also clad in armor. He had gray eyes and long eyebrows, and his face was pale—he was clearly badly injured. It was Chen Yang.

Seeing Li Zhouda looking at him, Chen Yang could no longer pretend not to notice. He rose quickly and said respectfully, “Greetings…”

“Don’t force yourself!” Li Zhouda coughed. His expression was complex, but his tone was cold and disdainful. “Guest Retainer Chen, you’ve disliked me for a long time. Just say it. You always act more respectful than anyone. Isn't that utterly hypocritical!”

Chen Yang was stunned speechless by the outburst. Li Zhouda let out a ragged breath, finally unclenching his fist and showing his blood-soaked palm to the other man.

In his broad palm lay two shattered teeth.

“But your Jinxi… I couldn't save him. I failed you…”

Chen Yang’s brow furrowed and his eyes narrowed. He looked away for a moment, then his gaze snapped back. His lips moved, but no sound came out. He took two steps back and collapsed into a sitting position within the pavilion.

The head of the Chen Clan, a man renowned for his deep scheming, contemplated for a long moment. At last, he seemed like nothing more than a father. He frowned.

“Is this all?”

Li Zhouda stood there anxiously, regretting not having a jade box to preserve them. His voice was stiff.

“This is all.”

# Chapter 1043: The Order of Yin and Yang

The sky was bleak, and a gray wind churned the air. A purple-black jade pearl ascended into the heavens, casting a cascading torrent of light down upon the Purple Light Blessed Land. A colossal, ferocious ghost hung suspended in the sky, pulling a massive chariot behind it.

Before the carriage stood a man in black robes, his expression as cold as ice. The Martial Cultivation Star shone down from above, its radiance draping him in a celestial mantle of True Qi, making him appear like a god descended to the mortal realm.

A tapestry of divine abilities crisscrossed the sky. The woman in flowing robes withdrew her Spiritual Artifact, a faint blush returning to her pale cheeks as she glanced toward the Daoist Master on the other side.

'It… it should be time to stop, shouldn't it?'

Nearby, a young Daoist Master stood in serene silence. He was draped in a long, white, luminous gauze over Daoist robes patterned with black clouds on a white, gold-trimmed background. With rosy lips and a fair complexion, he simply watched Yang Ruiyi in the sky, his expression unreadable.

He kept one hand tucked inside his sleeve, patting it gently.

'Come back,' he thought. 'The matter of Moongaze Lake can wait for another day.'

Beside him, Kong Tingyun remained oblivious to the undercurrents. Her eyes darted between Helian Wujiang and Murong Yan, who flanked her, their killing intent churning like a tide. She noted that these two outsiders were also silent, quietly waiting to see how the situation would unfold. Only the enormous golden Dharma Body in the sky continued to unleash a thousand-eyed radiance, holding back the surging black clouds.

'Wielding the light of Martial Cultivation, Yang Ruiyi is practically the equal of a Great Daoist Master with four divine abilities here on Song court soil… A Great Daoist Master from a relict clan of the Underworld is likely beyond our ability to defeat.'

The great battle had left devastation in its wake. Kong Tingyun didn't even need to look to know that the Profound Peak Gate, which had only just begun to recover, had surely suffered grievous losses. Yet she had no say in the matter, nor was there any possibility of avoiding this conflict.

'If the Song court wants to rule from across the river, they will never let the Profound Peak Gate go. And if the Profound Governance Pavilion wants to legitimately suppress the southern powers, they will absolutely never let me go…'

Kong Tingyun knew that her own Daoist Master Changxi had done his best, but frankly, the situation had only grown worse under her watch. A self-deprecating thought surfaced in her mind.

'Right now, I may be walking on a mountain of blades, but at least there is a path. The day the north and south finally stop fighting, when the Profound Governance Pavilion's forces return to Jizhong and no longer pay any mind to Jiangbei… that is the day I will truly have something to fear!'

She waited for what felt like an eternity before Qi Lanyan, standing beside her, finally spoke with a beaming smile.

"Judge Yang’s methods are truly impressive, living up to his reputation. To be able to command the Martial Cultivation Star so soon after establishing a state—we are indebted to you for making this trip, Lord Yang."

Poised atop the ghost chariot, Yang Ruiyi’s gaze was laced with contempt. He let out a cold laugh.

"Wei Xuanyin is the anointed lord of the Profound Governance. If he were here, he might have the right to speak such words. But you? Your Qi family are nothing but two-faced vassals of the Yan and Zhao. You, Qi Lanyan, are just some minor cultivator from Yan Mountain. If you hadn't latched onto the Profound Governance, you’d be just another Gongsun Bei. What qualifications do you have to comment on the methods of the great figures of my Underworld?"

He continued in a flat tone, "The Lord of Luoxia may be ascendant in matters of the Immortal Dao for now, but don’t forget whose family head just died. To speak so recklessly of the departed… are you determined to leave your family no path of retreat?"

The rebuke was perfectly timed, the threat precisely delivered. The smile on Qi Lanyan's face slowly faded, his fury simmering beneath a surface he could not break. He clenched his jaw and said nothing more. Watching this, Murong Yan felt a chill creep into his heart. He slowly adjusted the grip on his staff and sighed internally.

'This Yang Ruiyi is no easy mark. The Underworld has always maintained an aloof detachment. When have they ever resorted to such open threats? He’s left that fellow Qi with no way to save face…'

The fleshy cheeks of the Murong direct-line heir trembled as his eyes narrowed to slits.

'Perhaps the Yang family's status has risen considerably because of this True Qi matter…'

Qi Lanyan offered no further words. With a flick of his sleeve, he departed, and the contingent of northern cultivators retreated with him. Yang Ruiyi remained standing on the ghost chariot. Immediately, a sword cultivator rode the winds to the carriage, bowed, and said,

"Thank you for your aid, my lord!"

Yang Ruiyi glanced at him, his form already vanishing, leaving only a faint echo of his voice.

"Qi Lanyan still wants to drag this out. The real problem is in Ting Province. Daoist Master, guard this place. I am going to reinforce King Wei at once."

Nearby, Ning Wan descended hastily on the wind, her face a little pale. She nodded at his words, breathing a silent sigh of relief. Yang Ruiyi, meanwhile, stepped into the Great Void. The menacing ghost chariot swept forward, and in an instant, the vista before him transformed into the blood-soaked surface of a great river.

The entire riverbank was a sea of crimson. Under the setting sun, the sand and gravel gleamed with a dark, crystalline red. Skeletons and shattered swords carpeted the shore. Several mountain peaks had collapsed, revealing the blackish-brown rock beneath.

The massive, intricately-patterned wreckage of a golden Dharma Body lay fallen on the bank like a range of rolling hills, its lifeless eyes staring blankly at the sky.

Directly in front of where the golden figure had knelt, a Celestial Gate that seemed to span the heavens stood upon the earth. Its pure, crystalline radiance no longer shimmered; instead, it was spattered with blood and pockmarked with craters. Amidst the carnage of the battlefield, it resembled an ancient city watchtower, projecting an even greater sense of majesty.

'Ting Province has suffered greatly.'

If the battle in the Shanji was a strategic game between the northern and southern immortal aristocracies, a clash that ended once a point was made, then the slaughter on the northern bank was a true, no-holds-barred fight to the death, where blood flowed for a thousand miles. The menacing ghost chariot, hanging in the twilight sky, seemed perversely at home in this scene.

Yang Ruiyi sighed inwardly and descended.

A young man stood leaning on a halberd held in one hand. The qilin patterns on his black-and-gold armor had dimmed, the surface scarred with countless silvery-white slash marks. The Campaign Cloak at his back was riddled with tears, fluttering gently in the wind.

Li Zhouwei looked up. His golden eyes were as sharp as ever, but a massive scar ran from his forehead, down the bridge of his nose, and all the way to his chin, revealing bone through which a multicolored light flowed. The Dawn Qi at the wound's edge was being rapidly expelled from his body, the flesh slowly knitting itself back together.

By the time Yang Ruiyi descended with his divine ability, King Wei was in the process of unstrapping a vambrace covered in silvery slash marks, revealing a skeletal arm of pure white bone—one he had clearly just reattached.

Yang Ruiyi, who had been so imperious before the northern cultivators, now found himself at an awkward loss for words. Fortunately, Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"My thanks, Lord Yang."

Yang Ruiyi looked at him intently, then shook his head.

"What happened in Ting Province was a miscalculation on the part of my Song court…"

The imperial general unfastened his own cloak and draped it over the young man’s shoulders. The pieces of azure light on the cloak immediately brightened, shedding the brilliance of Horn Wood. Yang Ruiyi then produced a jade box from his sleeve and said in a low, serious voice,

"You are too gravely injured… Take this first!"

Li Zhouwei reached out and took it. Just by its weight, he knew what was inside.

'Golden Branch of the Late Tassel… a nigh-extinct resource of Horn Wood…'

The Golden Branch of the Late Tassel was a treasure of Horn Wood. Though classified as a resource, its rarity was comparable to a spiritual object. It was best consumed whole and was a miraculous item capable of reviving the dead and regenerating flesh. Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and replied,

"Thank you for your concern, my lord, but I have already taken medicine."

The Dawn Qi Spiritual Treasure in Gongsun Bei’s hands had been truly formidable. Under the suppression of its spirit platform, Li Zhouwei’s divine abilities had been greatly diminished, and his dharma power consumption had multiplied. The two short halberds that accompanied the platform were especially insidious, capable of piercing his Bright Yang divine abilities and moving with blinding speed.

Even with his Immortal Mirror to scout for them, he had been facing both Mingxiang and Gongsun Bei. He was often aware of the weapon but lacked the spare capacity to react. Not only was the artifact immensely powerful, but a single strike would unleash a torrent of Dawnlight that spread through the body like venomous snakes.

Fortunately, his Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body could dissolve the Dawnlight. Li Zhouwei had used it to suppress the affliction with a massive amount of dharma power… but that made it even harder to fend off the siege, trapping him in a vicious cycle. If not for the Talisman Qi, Illuminating Sun and Moon, sensing his fate and providing a ceaseless supply of dharma power, he would have fallen long ago.

'My own reserves of dharma power and divine abilities are already beyond the norm, and I only survived by the skin of my teeth with the aid of Illuminating Sun and Moon. If any other mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Bright Yang cultivator had been suppressed here, they would already be dead, with no hope of escape!'

Even though Li Zhouwei had endured, his body was now a chaotic mess. The Dawnlight poison flowed through every inch of his physical form, and he could only suppress it through sheer force of dharma power, preventing him from sparing any effort to heal his wounds.

The damage Dawn Qi inflicted on a Bright Yang foundation was terrifying. Li Zhouwei's injuries were severe, the kind that truly harmed his core, yet he was not anxious.

The reason was simple. With the retreat of the enemy cultivators, the wonder of Sovereign's Perilous Tread was reawakening at a slow but steady pace.

It was the effect of having successfully tread through peril!

'It would have been one thing in a one-on-one duel. But being besieged by a host of cultivators has pushed my White Qilin's Destiny to its absolute limit, ninety percent to completion, and has also triggered my Sovereign's Perilous Tread… a truly wondrous confluence!'

The awakening of Sovereign's Perilous Tread was also providing feedback with an additional ninety percent effectiveness. But even more important was the Talisman Qi, Illuminating Sun and Moon!

With his life-mandate bound to one of his inner mansions, the seemingly fatal injuries were first greatly mitigated. Then, in response to the battle trigger 'Break Divine Abilities, Defeat Demons and Buddhists,' which resonated with his White Qilin's Destiny, his Shengyang Acupoint began to surge with an endless tide of dharma power.

Right now, his Shengyang Mansion was roiling with dharma power, his divine abilities brilliant and full. He had merely sealed it away. While the Dawn Qi poison was anathema to Bright Yang, as long as the critical issue of dharma power was resolved, and with the pills he had on hand, recovery would not be difficult.

However, these miraculous effects were either sealed or suppressed by him, making them unnoticeable. They were also the result of his White Qilin's Destiny, which was outside the normal scope of Sovereign's Perilous Tread. Yang Ruiyi was clearly unaware of any of this, which left him feeling both embarrassed and vexed.

'We just enfeoffed him as King Wei, and the moment he steps out the door, he gets grievously wounded defending his lands, injuring his very foundation… This is nothing short of throwing my Yang family’s face on the ground and stomping on it!'

'And this will be even harder to explain to my little sister…'

His gaze turned grim.

'Qi Lanyan… Wei Xuanyin… I would have thought that the Profound Governance Pavilion, being a subordinate of Luoxia, would refrain from being the first to agitate against Bright Yang, even if the world has turned against it… Their methods are utterly shameless!'

Now that Yang Zhuo was the Song Emperor, there were many things Yang Ruiyi could not control and could only pretend not to see. But Qi Lanyan's actions had undoubtedly earned his deep dissatisfaction. He narrowed his eyes.

'Just you wait.'

Fortunately, Li Zhouwei did not let the awkwardness linger. He casually dismissed his divine ability and raised a hand to wipe his face. All his injuries and abnormalities vanished, and he once again looked every bit the majestic and imposing figure.

"Please."

**The Great Zhao.**

The light of the bright moon cast a silvery sheen across the sea. A man in white stood with his hands behind his back on a dark sea cliff, saying nothing.

After a moment, a spectral phantom drifted through the mountains, flickering in the ravines before solidifying into the form of a woman. She was dressed in men's clothing and clutched a wine jug. She knelt softly among the rocks, and a swarm of insects and snakes spilled out from under her robes, creating a chorus of faint rustling.

A low chuckle escaped her throat.

"What fine spirits you are in, Grand Preceptor, enjoying the moon all by yourself."

Wei Xuanyin turned his head and looked down at her.

"What business does Attendant Zong have with me?" he asked coolly.

This woman was none other than Zong Chang.

Both were famous figures with unique statuses. One was the Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhao, who practiced Veiled Yin through the orthodox Immortal Dao. The other was a power-mongering court attendant who cultivated Veiled Yin through heretical, unorthodox methods. One high, one low, yet they maintained a strangely amicable relationship.

Zong Chang squinted, took a drink of wine, and said languidly, "I just received word of a great battle between the north and south. I hear many people died on the riverbank… With such a wonderful event, my lord received news and didn't even think to share a piece of it with me? If I had been there, things would only have gone better, not worse…"

Wei Xuanyin sighed and shook his head. He recognized the sarcasm in her words but didn't respond. Zong Chang then asked abruptly,

"Was Qi Lanyan acting on your orders? To so deliberately target Bright Yang… taking the lead for all the great families. He is quite bold."

Wei Xuanyin replied impassively,

"I do not know whose handiwork that was. You are mistaken, fellow Daoist."

Though they both practiced Veiled Yin, they walked completely different paths. Wei Xuanyin felt no particular animosity toward her, but Zong Chang harbored a deep jealousy for him. Her eyes shifted as she replied,

"You and I both cultivate Veiled Yin. On this matter, our interests should align. Why must you deceive me?"

Wei Xuanyin watched her in silence for a long moment before speaking.

"The path of the Wei-Li is glorious, and the Imperial Monarch is worthy of admiration. But he greatly elevated the Human Dao, which runs contrary to the Immortal Dao. Since his time, the balance between Veiled Yin and Bright Yang has shifted. You say our interests align, but I do not believe that is entirely true."

Standing under the moonlight, the man's features appeared androgynous.

"I intend to uphold the orthodoxy of Veiled Yin, to achieve the merit of restoring the harmony of yin and yang, and to rebuild the Daoist work destroyed by Li Qianyuan… If I were to ascend by destroying Bright Yang, I would inevitably be transformed by a hundred evils and walk a demonic path. That is not my intention. You need not ask again."

Zong Chang laughed coldly.

"What grand ambitions you have. You think you can attain the Fruition of Veiled Yin on your own power? To achieve it through righteous and honorable means, without stooping to the station born of yin and yang reversed, of order overthrown? For that, you would need the ability!"

She smiled.

"The world awaits the descent of Bright Yang. Whether the White Qilin succeeds or fails, the great masters above are not overly concerned and have tacitly permitted their wagers. But the various Dharma Masters, the great clans, and the immortal sects all have their own stances. Since those on high have not given a command, it is every man for himself."

"I don't care about your orthodoxy or whether you have the ability. I ask you this: if Li Zhouwei masters all his divine abilities, strives for Fruition Attainment, and replaces the Bright Yang Imperial Monarch, heralding the revival of Bright Yang… it is hard to say whether the great masters could tolerate it… but could you, Wei Xuanyin, tolerate it?!"

"If the great revival of Bright Yang truly comes to pass, with Bright Yang ascendant and Veiled Yin in disarray, things will inevitably return to how they were in the Wei State of old. Veiled Yin will be debased, becoming the very demonic path you speak of. And your True Spirit, Wei Xuanyin, resides in a man's body. Do you think Li Zhouwei would spare you? What talk is there of yin-yang harmony? What possibility of a breakthrough? It would be suicide! Do I really need to remind you of this?"

The woman remained kneeling on the ground, drinking by herself as she smiled.

"If those on high were managing things, it would be a different story. But they clearly are not. And you are an ambitious man who seeks that station. Could you truly allow someone so unstable, someone who could destroy your every chance of ascension, to continue on his path?"

"And now… now Qi Lanyan has been scheming and probing, showing his intent to destroy Bright Yang. He is acting on your behalf, risking his very life to do so. You, Wei Xuanyin, hold a high position in the Profound Governance, and your Dao-Profundity is terrifyingly deep. If you tell me you knew nothing of this, I refuse to believe it!"

# Chapter 1044: Immortals and Buddhists

Zong Chang’s words echoed in the night. Wei Xuanyin, his white robes fluttering in the breeze, watched her quietly and spoke in a low voice.

“Since you’ve brought up my disciple-nephew Qi… there’s no need to sound me out.”

“Qi Lanyan is indeed my disciple-nephew and a cultivator of the Profound Governance Pavilion, but he is also the head of the Qi family. What he does and how he does it are his own affairs. You know that Li Zhouwei’s hands are tied by his position in the Bright Yang, but how many people on either side of this river are truly their own masters? Everyone is trying to forge their own path. Where is there room for so much freedom?”

“I only learned of his arrangements on the riverbank a moment before you did.”

The Grand Preceptor of the Zhao State took a step forward, his expression finally showing a trace of complexity. His words were laden with meaning.

“He has found his own destined opportunity and wishes to change things. Perhaps he even thinks he is helping me. But from our perspective… what we seek is of such immense value that success means everything and failure means annihilation. The myriad threads of cause and effect are rooted in ourselves alone, unswayed by external forces.”

“And as for Li Zhouwei…”

His expression was solemn as he continued calmly, “He will eventually reach the same step as me, perhaps even seeking the metallic essence a step faster. I know, of course, that he is doomed. But the workings of heaven value that single thread of variance. If there is even the slightest possibility… that he truly succeeds under the watchful eyes of all and brings radiance to the world, then that is his skill. That is his Dao. I would congratulate him on attaining his rightful fruit and, admitting my loss, hold not a shred of resentment.”

Zong Chang stared at him coldly, her lips parting as if to speak, but she remained silent. Wei Xuanyin shook his head with a faint smile.

“You are cultivating the Veiled Yin, while I am seeking the Dao—that is the difference between us. The Dao I seek is one of yin and yang in harmony, of peace throughout the world. It would be better if Li Zhouwei attained his Dao. In fact, never mind Li Zhouwei; even if Li Qianyuan himself were resurrected, I would still pursue my path.”

The mountain fell silent. Wei Xuanyin took another step, his gaze fixed on Zong Chang.

“Fellow Daoist Zong, the Dao of the Veiled Yin is a mothering path; it should not bring ruin to living beings. I understand you wish to convert to the Buddhist cultivators, but their way is one of great indulgence. It feigns the release of desire, but in truth, it clutches the greatest desire of all to its heart. If you join them, you will be nothing more than a weapon in another’s hand…”

“Better to cultivate the righteous path of the Immortal Dao. Perhaps there is still a chance for redemption.”

Zong Chang gave him a stunned look, then laughed with a hint of contempt.

“Wei Xuanyin, don’t you hold that immortal-seeking heart of yours a little too high? Do you think everyone was born into a great sect as you were? That we all practiced at Profound Governance, poring over the great Daoist Classics and enjoying boundless resources? Every word you speak today drips with freedom, but the very ground you stand on is built upon the bones and blood of the great families, common folk, and minor sects of Jizhong, who have been exploited by your Viewing Pavilion faction for a thousand years. We both hail from the State of Chen. Who do you think you can fool with that stench of yours?”

“Back then, I was just a minor cultivator in the Long region, hoping only for my family to live in peace. But every river-mulberry flower I grew was bought from me at a pittance by your people, who threw their weight around and bullied us. I had no choice but to leave my home. With nowhere left to turn, I killed for blood just to survive, and that is how I clawed my way to where I am today. If not for my master’s guidance, I would have been just another demonic cultivator in Long, living on borrowed time. When you cultivators of the Viewing Pavilion speak so grandly of seeking immortality, do you think I, Zong Chang, remain silent because I do not desire it?”

“And now you have the gall to lecture me. I bring ruin to living beings? Could it be because the seats of the righteous path have been occupied by you for a thousand years? Occupied so firmly, so impenetrably! The world turns to the Buddhists and the demons precisely because of the incompetence of your so-called righteous path, your so-called Immortal Dao!”

The woman’s face was like ice. She tossed aside the wine flask in her hand, her feigned demeanor vanishing. She rose to her feet and cursed,

“Wei Xuanyin! If you fail to attain your Dao, how will you ever show your face again?! All that will be left of the Viewing Pavilion are wine-sacks and rice-bags… the likes of Qi Lanyan and Yin Baiyue, who will do nothing but lord over others for a mere five hundred years! What good is that to this world?”

With a final, sharp flick of her sleeve, she stormed away, leaving a faint demonic wind lingering in the air. A desolate expression fell over Wei Xuanyin as he stood alone on the mountain, watching the moonlight spill across his robes.

He gathered all the light, drawing it into his sleeves. An unknown time passed before his figure, too, disappeared into the night.

---

Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain.

Temples stood in dense groves, their multicolored light forming a gentle mist. At the base of the mountain, the long flight of stairs was silent and deserted, shimmering with a glazed, colorful sheen. Two monks, one tall and one short, were making their way up the steps.

Maha Minghui wore a strange expression, his hands tucked into his sleeves. He smacked his lips, a bitter taste filling his mouth.

‘What a damn mess…’

Beside him, Mingxiang stood a full head taller. His jade-like face glowed with a faint crimson light. He rubbed his cheek as if in pain and looked at his disciple-brother’s distracted state, shaking his head with a chuckle.

“Minghui… look at your disciple-brother. I took a halberd strike from Li Zhouwei, and my cheek is still burning with Bright Yang. But you’re perfectly fine! Safe and sound.”

Minghui turned to look at him, a flicker of exasperation in his heart.

‘Why didn’t he just run you through…’

Despite his thoughts, Minghui simply shook his head and asked, “How is the White Qilin? I saw his injuries were not light.”

Mingxiang stroked his chin. “Far from it…”

A look of alarm crept into his eyes as he continued, “My three guardian treasures were refined in the incense burner for over three hundred years. My master said that these three items are no ordinary Enlightened Artifacts. Combined with my cultivation and spell arts, even an average mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would be no match for me… Yet he resisted them with ease. Even suppressed by that Li Fire Spiritual Treasure, the strength of his Dharma Body was clear to see.”

Mingxiang seemed regretful. “Somehow, he learned a Dharma Body from the Touba family. It looked familiar… The Touba hold three of the Twelve Dharma Bodies of Demonic Contemplation. It must be a variation of one of them.”

“That Dharma Body can suppress Dawn Qi. Otherwise, how could a treasure as renowned as the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform, which even Li Shu died beneath, only manage to inflict him with a body full of Dawn Qi?”

As Mingxiang sighed with great feeling, Minghui’s heart ached as if he had suffered a great loss. But Mingxiang just laughed and sent a telepathic message,

“Didn’t I handle it well? I even got revenge for you against Taixi… He’s not having a good time right now! It’s just a shame I couldn’t snatch a Spiritual Artifact or two back…”

“This outcome is for the best. Though the White Qilin was cornered and forced to endure our attacks, he wasn’t pushed to fight to the death. Taixi took the brunt of the losses… We, on the other hand, are doing just fine.”

Minghui pressed his palms together, crying ‘what a sin’ in his heart. They took a few more steps and saw the monk Yanbai descending the mountain. He nodded to the pair and said in a low voice,

“Thank you for your hard work!”

Feeling a pang of guilt, Minghui nodded silently. In truth, with the Martial Cultivation Star shining brightly and the troops storming the banks being from the Way of Great Desire, he had had little impact on the casualties of either side. But he had a thick skin and felt no shame, returning the greeting with a smile.

Yanbai, however, added casually, “The great one in the hall just saw me to ask about the situation on the lake shore. Now it is your turn, fellow Daoist. Please.”

Hearing this, Minghui’s eyes flew open, his mind instantly clearing.

‘A great one? Someone has arrived? And they want to question me?’

He was startled and alarmed, but managed a strained smile.

“Thank you for informing me, Great Monk…”

Yanbai’s face was expressionless.

“They are all watching you. Go on in.”

A cold sweat broke out on Minghui’s brow. Beside him, Mingxiang’s eyes sharpened.

“Which great one?” he demanded in a low voice. “And why would they need to see my disciple-brother?”

Without another word, Yanbai turned and walked away. Minghui had no choice but to push his disciple-brother aside.

“Fortunately,” he said with a wry smile, “this won’t involve you.”

He then strode forward, passing through a corridor shimmering with brilliant light. Pushing open a pair of massive golden doors, he was met with a breathtaking sight. Golden pillars soared to the heavens, the ceiling was a canvas of radiant light, and the floor was as clear as crystal. In the center of the hall sat a large bronze cauldron. Flanking it were countless Dharma Bodies of all sizes, arrayed in various poses. Densely packed, they were organized by rank and status, their sizes reflecting their power, stretching from the entrance all the way to the main seat at the far end.

The solemnity of the occasion was clearly far greater than when Zhelu had presided. The golden figure on the highest throne was immense, touching the sky, its form seeming to dissolve into the heavens. Its massive hand was raised high, like a small mountain, the jade-white lines of its palm as distinct as ravines.

On a slightly lower seat to one side, however, sat the only normal-sized figure upon a tall golden lotus. He held a bowl in his hands, studying it intently as if no one else existed.

‘They’ve connected to the Buddhist Land… Jiang Toushou is here too. This is trouble…’

With just a single glance, Minghui dropped to his knees with a thud and kowtowed.

“Minghui pays his respects to the great virtuous ones!”

The hall was utterly silent, save for the gurgling sound from the bronze cauldron. After what felt like an eternity, the colossal golden figure stirred, its voice booming through the chamber.

“Jiang Toushou… this is Minghui.”

Minghui knew full well that the one seated on the main throne was the master of the Sea of Desire and the Way of Great Desire, Tian Langzhi, also known as Maha Liangli. His scheme against Taixi had been subtle, but there was no way a being like this wouldn’t know!

He couldn't help but raise his eyes slightly. He saw that the bronze cauldron before him was filled with boiling oil, and a person was thrashing within it, their skin split and flesh raw, white smoke rising from their body.

‘Five-Eyed.’

The one in the cauldron was none other than the Five-Eyed Merciful One!

This was no ordinary pot. Once inside, all divine abilities were sealed, rendering one a mere mortal unable to use spell arts for protection. The pain of being deep-fried was bone-deep. The sight made Minghui’s eyelids twitch.

‘He slacked off too… but I have my master and the Way of Joyful Bliss as my backing. No matter what, there has to be a trial… But Zhelu is incompetent. How could he possibly protect him? Of course he’d end up in the boiling oil!’

As Minghui pondered this, the man in the sky spoke again, his tone indifferent.

“You’re too polite, Liangli. I know of him.”

Tian Langzhi laughed, his voice flat.

"The battle went poorly… Not only did we fail to secure any benefits, but we also lost the Maha of the Way of Emptiness. From what I hear of the situation, it seems Maha Minghui held a grudge against him and secretly plotted his demise.”

“I have long heard that the disciples of that one from the Lotus Temple are all unusually close to the Immortal cultivators. They were reprimanded for it at Mount Dayang, and it seems nothing has changed. The Lotus Temple is ineffective.”

At these words, Jiang Toushou raised his eyebrows, looking down from his great height.

“Mingxiang, at least, tried his best. This Minghui… he is famously reckless. He should have been punished at Mount Dayang, barred from returning… or even executed to embarrass Jinlian. But now that he holds the rank of Maha, he is a significant figure in the Way of Joyful Bliss. It wouldn’t be proper to execute him.”

Minghui listened with a mixture of fear and confusion, not daring to overthink it. Panic began to set in.

‘What is going on? Why are they talking about beating and killing!’

What they said wasn't wrong. He, Minghui, had shirked his duties countless times. And while the Way of Emptiness was now jointly controlled, the losses hadn't truly damaged the foundation of the Way of Great Desire. Why were they being so severe?

‘This doesn’t feel like a punishment for slacking off. It feels more like I ruined someone’s grand plan… Qi Lanyan… his sudden transfer of manpower must have had a reason. It seems many people had schemes centered on this Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, and I’ve somehow damaged someone’s interests…’

But Tian Langzhi did not appreciate Jiang Toushou’s words and fell silent. The emissary from Mount Dayang smiled, his voice dropping to a whisper that only the two of them could hear.

“Liangli… have you heard about the Liao River? Of the disciples from back then… only one remains. After winding his way across the world, he has actually returned to the Liao River.”

Tian Langzhi’s expression changed, turning cold and sharp.

“Him? With a fate that precludes him from becoming a Dharma Master, how did he manage to walk right into a trap?”

Jiang Toushou shook his head grimly.

“It’s a long story… That fool who was the manifestation of Wrath… ran off to find him and was used to calculate the state of the Wrath Dharma Master. My lord also went to take part in the planning. That person… should be gone.”

“And since he’s gone, things are different. My lord and the one from the Murong family acted together and have temporarily fixed the location of the Buddhist Land. Now, it is a matter of who this heaven-sent opportunity will fall to…”

Tian Langzhi’s heart pounded. At the same time, realization dawned. “No wonder… I suspect the great one from my Dao is also busy with this matter. Otherwise, why would he let Peacock… alas!”

Jiang Toushou pursed his lips noncommittally.

“There are several candidates right now. The consensus among the great ones is… the Wrath position has been vacant for a long time, and the matter must be handled discreetly. But whoever we send in must be capable… I, for one, still think Yaosa Chengmi is worth a try…”

Tian Langzhi immediately understood.

“At the next Dharma Assembly, I will certainly recommend him.”

Jiang Toushou smiled and shook his head, continuing smoothly,

“It was precisely that fool’s actions that caused a great change in the successor of the Liao River. Now, not only is the Way of Discipline protecting him, but the Great Adoration Dharma Realm also values him greatly. Two of their leaders personally went to the Liao River, stirring up the entire situation…”

“Think about it. How many things are in motion right now? Gao Fu seems to have found his opportunity and has entered seclusion. The Purple Mystery has held him back for so many years, but he’s finally broken through. The power of the Qi region will rise again… and his relationship with our Daos is not good…”

“The Dragon-kin are in conflict with Compassion over the Hetian affair. Although Compassion has been powerful these past years, they still fear the Dragon-kin. The Great Adoration Dharma Realm is in a precarious position, and without the help of the Way of Joyful Bliss, things will be difficult going forward…”

Tian Langzhi shook his head slightly, a faint anger in his eyes. He replied in the same low voice,

“We need people at a time like this, but do we really need him? Gongsun Bei is inclined to side with us. I went to great lengths to persuade Qi Lanyan, and now this mess has made everything uncertain. How am I supposed to explain this to them!”

Jiang Toushou’s gaze was icy. “Qi Lanyan isn’t worried, so why are you, Liangli? If you want to kill the White Qilin, how can you do it without one or two great ones to suppress him? Right now, all the great ones are occupied elsewhere. This prize is so rich, you mustn’t go offending people carelessly!”

Hearing this, Tian Langzhi finally fell silent. Jiang Toushou placated him,

“It’s not that he can’t be killed. At worst, it’s just another fight with Jinlian… but Mingxiang is a diligent one. If the Way of Joyful Bliss throws down their responsibilities in protest, we will be the ones to suffer.”

Tian Langzhi closed his eyes for a long time, then suddenly sighed.

“If the mountain doesn’t intervene in this, what happens once will happen again. News of today’s events will surely reach the ears of every Dao. When they all send their people, won’t we have just been a stepping stone for them? I’m afraid we’ll have exhausted ourselves for nothing… only for another family to reap the benefits!”

His gaze was frigid as he lamented,

“Believe me, once the Murong family finishes with their business, even they will come south. With their strength, if they cannot convert Li Zhouwei, do you think they cannot convert the likes of Li Jiangqian?”




# Chapter 1045: The Qilin's Son

Tian Langzhi’s words hung in the air, giving Jiang Toushou pause. The envoy from Mount Dayang seemed deeply wary of the Way of Compassion. Jiang Toushou lowered his gaze again to the bronze bowl in his hands, and Tian Langzhi decided to strike while the iron was hot.

"Head of House, think about it. Is it not so? Did Qi Lanyan acquiesce, or even offer support, because he owes us some great favor? Of course not. It must be because he harbors the same ambitions in his own heart. Since that's the case, what does it matter who he cooperates with? Why should he be bound to us alone?"

"None of the other lords can spare a hand… This opportunity has presented itself, but when the time comes, who can say which side will be able to act first? As long as the Head of House gives the order, I am not afraid of offending anyone."

Tian Langzhi’s eyes narrowed as he lowered his voice. "As for Minghui, Gongsun Bei has his reservations about him, and Qi Lanyan utterly detests Jinlian. He wasn't present for the battle, yet he told me twice that the Lotus Temple is useless, that the disciple-brothers Minghui and Mingxiang would not give their all."

"Today, Minghui proved his incompetence. And I believe Mingxiang was holding back as well. Since the Lotus Temple refuses to contribute its strength, why should we show them any mercy?"

Jiang Toushou mulled this over for a long time before a faint smile touched his lips. "Liangli, your considerations are astute. I will inquire about this matter when I return."

"As for Minghui," he continued, "we'll hold this failure over his head and find ways to use him. The next time we attack the south or defend against the Great Song, we'll throw him right in Yang Ruiyi's path. Yang Ruiyi wields Exiled Qi; that will force his hand. He’ll have no choice but to fight with everything he has."

"If they can't defeat him and end up crippled or killed by the Yang Clan, it will serve as a fitting explanation for Jinlian. And if he flees without fighting, we'll have cause to capture him… and punish him for his crimes in the name of Mount Dayang."

---

High in the sky, the two golden figures fell silent. Below, Minghui’s heart sank like a stone. Jiang Toushou had always been at odds with his Way of Joyful Bliss; nothing good could come of this. As expected, the man in the sky spoke, a cold smile on his face.

"Minghui, your senses are impure, and your heart is filled with greed and malice. You should be severely punished. However, considering the many good deeds of the Way of Joyful Bliss, the diligence of your disciple-brother, and the high prestige of your master, we shall merely record this transgression. You and your disciple-brother are ordered to guard the riverbank."

The smile vanished from his face, replaced by a chilling indifference. "If you fail again… the mountain will have to punish you severely."

If they had ordered him thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil or a sea of fire, Minghui might have felt a sense of relief. But this light sentence terrified him.

'My master, highly respected? Everyone knows what a terrible reputation he has! This is a plot to kill me!'

The Five-Eyed creature sizzled and popped as it tumbled in the boiling oil. Minghui could only kowtow, crying out, "I have failed you, my lords! I am consumed by guilt! I beg only for punishment to be inflicted upon my body… as a show of my sincerity!"

But how could the two possibly let him off? After a few more hollow words of praise, they were about to dismiss him lightly when Minghui burst into tears.

"The two virtuous masters are willing to show me mercy, but I cannot forgive myself! If you allow me to walk out of this place unharmed… I will cripple my own Dharma Body to show my gratitude!"

His words made Jiang Toushou’s gaze turn to ice. "You refuse to strive for betterment and seek only to avoid battle. I can personally escort you to Mount Dayang and explain this matter before all the Buddhists. Let's see what you have to say for yourself then."

On any other day, Minghui might have actually gone with him. Anything was better than living under the constant shadow of their schemes. But he thought of the matters at the riverbank. If he were gone, his disciple-brother Mingxiang was bound to make a mistake, and furthermore, he would lose the chance to prove his loyalty to that _other_ master. Finally, he stifled his wails and retreated sullenly.

The moment he stepped out of the great hall, his expression darkened. His disciple-brother, Mingxiang, was waiting for him on the steps. With a grave look, Minghui sent a transmission, "The situation has changed. Someone from Mount Dayang is here… it’s Jiang Toushou. We can’t get away. I fear our lives are in danger!"

Mingxiang frowned, shaking his head as he transmitted back, "I regret ever agreeing to that fellow from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm!"

Minghui’s face was grim. "This has nothing to do with him… This isn't something we could have resolved by agreeing or disagreeing. Given the situation today, even if we hadn't promised Fachang anything, Jiang Toushou would have come, and we would have been summoned all the same. The conflict between the north and south has shifted. Qi Lanyan has made the first move to upset the balance, and the greed of the various Daoist traditions for the Li Clan’s territory can no longer be suppressed!"

Having spent more time in the mortal world, Minghui had more experience than his disciple-brother, who spent his years in closed-door cultivation. He quickly pieced together the situation. Mingxiang’s expression changed as he looked at his junior with new gravity.

"The most urgent task," Minghui said, his tone serious, "is to inform our master. I must return at once. He will soon order me to depart for my post… We cannot delay!"

---

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain, brilliant light pulsed through the peaks. A man in black robes frowned, looking at Li Zhouwei. "King Wei, perhaps you should take your medicine first."

"It's nothing," Li Zhouwei said, shaking his head. He gestured for the man to sit beside him. Sima Yuanli, who had followed them all the way with an indescribably awkward expression, also stopped and bowed with a sigh.

"I… I was foolish and incompetent, allowing King Wei to fall into such danger… It is a grievous sin! I should be punished!"

Sima Yuanli had been regretting his actions for some time. This was not the era of the Azure Pond Sect; what influence did the Sima Family have left? He didn't dare hold a grudge against the Li family, and he certainly couldn't afford for Li Zhouwei to hold one against him.

'White Cicada is vengeful over the smallest slight, and while White Qilin might be better, he's no saint either! Today, my rescue was delayed, yet he still escaped. In the future, during the great war between north and south, what if he has his own 'delayed rescue'? I wouldn't stand a chance!'

He knew he couldn't just brush this off. He had to address it directly. He hurriedly took out the Azure Grace Profound Gourd to heal Li Zhouwei while lamenting, "King Wei must believe me!"

A wave of bitterness washed over him. He remembered the old days, when Li Ximing was in seclusion seeking death and he, Sima Yuanli, presided over the Azure Pond Sect. Back then, he had spoken of Li Zhouwei with casual disdain—a cornered man with death written all over him. Now, he was the subordinate one. He had hesitated for just a moment to lend his treasure, and now he had to beg for mercy, respectfully addressing him as King Wei. The world had changed, and people with it. Half-genuine tears of sorrow welled in Sima Yuanli’s eyes. "We are family by marriage. Seeing King Wei so gravely injured fills me with shame."

Li Zhouwei, however, did not blame him. He waved a hand dismissively. "The Huai River Map is a precious treasure. It was my fault for requesting it so rashly. Daoist Master, please don't trouble yourself over it."

Sima Yuanli nodded repeatedly. Nearby, Yang Ruiyi watched the exchange with amusement, his mind racing. 'This Daoist Master Sima is a far cry from Si Boxiu… I can't believe Si Boxiu was comfortable letting him run things on the mainland. Hah… his only saving grace is his decent talent, a notch above Ning Wan's.'

Once their conversation ended, Yang Ruiyi spoke up. "With the west in turmoil and the Northern Zhao watching like a tiger, this disaster on the lake has truly shaken the people's hearts. As for His Majesty's side… I will go and inquire, and I will be sure to report everything on King Wei's behalf."

Li Zhouwei remained impassive, forcing a smile. "General, your timely reinforcements were a great blessing to us on the lake. The Buddhist cultivators will not let Ting Province go. This is only the beginning."

Yang Ruiyi shook his head with a slight sigh. "Qi Lanyan will not get away with what happened today for free." He smoothed his sleeve. "I wonder where fellow Daoist Zhaojing is? With King Wei injured, I'm afraid Ting Province cannot do without him."

Li Zhouwei’s expression was perfectly calm. "My elder is in seclusion at a critical juncture of his breakthrough. It's impossible to say what year or month he might see progress. I dare not disturb him, for fear of causing all his previous efforts to be in vain."

'By my calculations, it should be about time…' Yang Ruiyi thought. Li Ximing couldn't possibly sit still with Li Zhouwei injured like this. He did a quick calculation and was ninety percent convinced. "Since that is the case, I should dispatch a Daoist Master to the Wilderness to guard the border, so that King Wei can recuperate properly. I wonder… does King Wei have anyone in mind?"

Li Zhouwei glanced at Sima Yuanli beside him and said seriously, "Fellow Daoist Sima is a good candidate, but if the north has ill intentions, he may not even be able to protect himself. We must ask the King of Yuyang to make a trip."

Hearing him bring up Chen Yin, Sima Yuanli secretly breathed a sigh of relief and nodded. "The King of Yuyang has reached the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, which is no small feat. His strength has grown considerably, and he is very reliable… He is also acquainted with Daoist Master Cheng, which would make coordinating reinforcements convenient."

At the mention of Daoist Master Cheng, Li Zhouwei’s expression subtly tightened. But Yang Ruiyi simply said coolly, "Indeed. The two Daoist Masters of the Sword Gate have parted on bad terms, and Lingmei is in seclusion. You won't have to worry about him being uncooperative."

Sima Yuanli fell silent, swallowing hard. The atmosphere grew heavy. Fortunately, the clouds outside the mountain began to churn, and another Daoist Master arrived, descending gracefully upon a divine ability.

The Daoist Master was a strikingly beautiful woman dressed in pale green robes, her waterfall of black hair cascading down her back. With a gentle smile, she gave a slight bow. "Reporting to the Grand General, Lingu Lanying has returned to give her report."

Yang Ruiyi glanced at her, a hint of a smile on his face. He noticed a man standing beside her among the clouds. Though his features were not exceptional, his armor was battered and he was covered in dust, as if he had just come from a battlefield. A lingering killing intent still smoldered in his golden eyes, giving him a formidable air.

Li Zhouwei set down the cup in his hand, a ripple of emotion in his eyes. This man was none other than his own legitimate son and heir, the one publicly known as the Second Young Master, Li Jianglong!

Li Jianglong faced the crowd, his expression unchanging, and bowed. "Greetings, Father! Greetings, esteemed Daoist Masters!"

Lingu Lanying smiled and looked at him as well. "So this is King Wei. It is truly a case of 'a tiger father will not have a dog son.' The Second Young Master won a great victory over the Buddhist cultivators in the Wilderness, joined forces with the Song army, and intercepted the defeated northern forces for us… His military achievements are outstanding!"

"Oh?" Yang Ruiyi’s interest was piqued. He observed the young man closely.

Lingu Lanying continued her praise. "The Zhao army was crossing the river when the Young Master shattered their formation, throwing them into chaos. Over ten thousand were killed or injured, and large numbers of Zhao troops were forced to remain in the Wilderness. We even captured two direct descendants of the Gongsun family… With the Young Master's surprise attack, our victory was magnified more than tenfold!"

"I was late to arrive, but I brought him back with me!" she finished, her smile polite, seemingly filled with nothing but goodwill.

Yang Ruiyi took the opportunity to pull Li Jianglong over, asking his age and marital status before smiling. "But we can't forget your younger brother… Li Jiangxia, was it? He deserves great credit for the Li family's bloody stand. Though his contribution was not as prominent as yours, it cannot be ignored."

The Grand General turned back to Li Zhouwei and sighed. "I was just thinking about who should lead the troops in the Wilderness, but I forgot that King Wei's sons are all outstanding talents. It's perfect for him to manage this matter. Why don't I take him back with me to ask the Monarch for a title? It would be a fitting reward for him!"

Having said this, the man gave no one a chance to speak. He stood up, a smile on his face, and swept his gaze over the three of them. "Have any of you heard of… the Law of the Celestial Dynasty?"

Lingu Lanying paused, shaking her head with some hesitation. Sima Yuanli nodded awkwardly.

Yang Ruiyi smiled. "The Law of the Celestial Dynasty was first created by Emperor Wei, derived from the ancient methods of incense offerings and mountain supervision. He was a peerless genius, favored by the Bright Yang, and he pushed this art to its absolute pinnacle. After the Wei-Li dynasty was destroyed, the Buddhist cultivators learned it and used it to complete the final piece of their Buddhist Land's cultivation path. The rise of Maha and the Merciful One was also thanks to this law."

"And while my Song Court does not follow the way of the Celestial Dynasty, we are similarly favored by the heavens. Thus, we have the Martial Cultivation Star shining upon us, blessing all our officials. His Majesty the Monarch built the Purple and Gold Hall in the imperial capital precisely to gather the light of Martial Cultivation and wield its profound methods."

Hearing this, Sima Yuanli looked up thoughtfully, a glimmer of shock appearing in his pupils.

Yang Ruiyi raised his head, his expression solemn. "Those who enter the Purple and Gold Hall receive the protection of Tianxiu and Tianwu. Their spiritual sense is cleared, and their destiny, weapons, and Dharma Body are elevated. It is of immense help for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm in the future. Diligent practice of martial cultivation and profound arts is what it means to be a Holder of the Profound."

He moved his lips slightly, and his ordinary face suddenly took on an ethereal quality. "And a Holder of the Profound… when on a campaign for the Emperor, may borrow a Tianwu divine ability."

As soon as these words were spoken, Lingu Lanying’s eyebrows shot up. A storm was raging in her heart. 'No wonder… no wonder he brought up the Celestial Dynasty. No wonder he mentioned Maha and the Merciful One!'

The Wei-Li's Law of the Celestial Dynasty was simple: to hold an office was to hold power. Whether you were a mortal with no cultivation or a minor cultivator, once you held an official position, you gained a corresponding level of power. This "Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace" was an imitation of the Wei-Li system!

'No wonder the Song Court isn't the least bit worried about the northern border! No wonder the Cheng Clan's attitude changed so drastically after entering the palace, sending their disciples into the prefectures. Even with Maha and the Merciful One pressing down on them, he has a way to counter it and defend this border!'

'With an offer like this, which family wouldn't flock to serve the Song Court? Even if a few Daoist Masters harbor no goodwill towards the court, what about their disciples? Who wouldn't want the blessing of Tianwu? Who wouldn't want to possess a divine ability!'

'Once you've tasted the power of a divine ability, who would be willing to go back to being ordinary! As long as those who enter the palace desire and cannot let go of this official position, do they belong to the Song Court or to their own families? This is cutting the ground from under their feet… These are the true methods of the Underworld!'

Yang Ruiyi's casual words had unleashed a tidal wave in her heart. Sima Yuanli was also speechless, his hand gripping the table so tightly his knuckles were white. The entire mountainside fell silent, with only the whistling of the wind.

Yang Ruiyi turned his head and smiled. "What does King Wei think?"

Li Zhouwei remained composed. He lowered his gaze to look at his son.

Li Jianglong had always been exceptionally obedient. He had the Chen Clan's blood in him; his features were not as striking as Li Jiangxia's and he resembled his father less, but he was far more compliant. He had few confidants of his own, and in his years managing the family's affairs on the island, all matters, large and small, passed through his hands without any sign of favoritism.

But now, this ever-obedient child knelt respectfully on the ground, silent, his head bowed. His golden eyes were fixed on the floor, leaving his father with only a view of his profile.

In that instant, the line of his brow on that profile softened, taking on a familiar look that made Li Zhouwei's gaze freeze and his lips part slightly.

Perhaps it was the pain from his injuries. In the end, King Wei did not speak. He let out a breath and then forced a smile.

"Second Young Master, express your gratitude."




# Chapter 1046: Variables in the Path of Cultivation

Li Zhouwei’s words reached Li Jianglong, who looked up and replied, “Thank you for your high regard, my lord. With turmoil stirring in both the north and south, it is my good fortune to be able to alleviate the burdens of my royal father, of Ting Province, and of the Song Court…”

Yang Ruiyi listened with a smile and shook his head, helping the young man to his feet. He then turned to Li Zhouwei, his expression growing serious.

“King Wei is injured and should not be disturbed,” he said. “However, the matter of the Song Court is of great importance. The Emperor holds you in high esteem and sent me personally to discuss the affairs of the Purple and Gold Palace… I was concerned that if you were to enter seclusion to heal… a celestial decree from the court would arrive and disturb you yet again.”

“His Majesty is most considerate. Ting Province is deeply grateful for his favor.”

Li Zhouwei offered a polite reply, then glanced at Li Jianglong, who stood quietly to the side. He nodded. “When you go to the Imperial Capital… you can see your brother as well.”

Li Jianglong’s eyebrows rose.

“Yes, Father,” he replied respectfully, saying nothing more.

Since Yang Ruiyi did not intend to stay long, Sima Yuanli and the others prepared to return and report on their mission. After they all took their leave, the mountain peak fell silent, with only the soft whisper of the wind remaining.

Li Zhouwei remained seated at the table, lost in quiet contemplation. After a while, a subordinate came up the mountain to report that the old master had arrived to see him.

“Show him up.”

Li Xuanxuan, who usually wore ink-blue robes, was now dressed in white with a simple cloak. He hurried up the mountain path, his expression hesitant as he saw Li Zhouwei.

“Daoist Master,” he asked, “how are your injuries?”

Whether it was Li Ximing or Li Zhouwei, Li Xuanxuan rarely used their given names, almost always addressing them as Daoist Master first. Li Zhouwei smiled faintly.

“It’s nothing serious.”

Moongaze Lake had suffered heavy casualties, and Li Zhouwei’s prolonged absence had left people unsettled. His injuries were a highly sensitive topic, and only Li Xuanxuan was in a position to come and ask directly. After listening to Li Zhouwei gravely recount his conversation with Yang Ruiyi, the old man finally sat down at the table, his face a mask of shock.

“A Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace…”

Everything Yang Ruiyi had said was a heavy blow, one destined to unleash a tempest across the Yue State, upend the existing order, and draw out countless ambitious souls. After hearing the full account, the old man offered an explanation of his own.

“If the Song Court truly possesses the ability to bestow such titles, granting a divine empowerment like that of the Merciful One, I fear ninety-nine percent of cultivators would be unable to resist the temptation.”

Li Zhouwei closed his eyes, his voice thoughtful. “Yang Ruiyi’s meaning was quite clear. The matter of the Purple and Gold Palace is already decided. He was showing me respect by bringing it to the mountain to discuss with me in advance.”

The old man considered this as Li Zhouwei continued.

“If he had kept this from me and waited until I was in seclusion, with no one here to make decisions, he could simply issue a decree granting titles to Jiangxia and Jianglong and summoning them to Simin. We would have no room to maneuver. He wasn't worried they wouldn't go; he was worried about making things too ugly.”

Although Li Zhouwei had not spent every day with his sons, he knew the temperament of those with the golden eyes. No matter how their personalities differed, they were all naturally ambitious and power-hungry. The title from the Purple and Gold Palace was too prestigious to refuse. Once the order was given, Li Jiangxia and Li Jianglong would surely go.

“He specifically mentioned Jiangxia. If nothing changes, a position will be waiting for him sooner or later.”

His golden eyes glinted.

“With them gone, the lake will be easier to guard.”

Faced with Li Zhouwei, Li Ximing was often silent. But the old man, Li Xuanxuan, seemed more at ease than Daoist Master Zhaojing. 

He sighed.

“Minghuang… Moongaze Lake is too shallow to hold them. You alone are already constrained, unable to move freely. How could it possibly contain all those brothers, especially with a father such as you?”

“I understand.”

Li Zhouwei’s expression was calm, the flicker of hopeful disappointment having long since vanished, replaced by a cold clarity. 

“Both Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia possess an independent streak. They despise being restrained. It is only my divine ability that keeps them in check, forcing them to suppress their friction as if they were in a cage.”

He spoke quietly.

“Emperor Gong of Wei had a reputation for benevolence, yet he still couldn't avoid subjugating his own brother, gifting him a bracelet as one would a slave. The descendants of the Bright Yang are bound to resent one another. They cannot coexist peacefully under their father's rule. The more powerful the Sovereign Father, the more they will feel compelled to fight to the death.”

“It’s not obvious now, but once they attain their own divine abilities, I won't be able to suppress them any longer. They are bound to cause trouble. Perhaps this matter with the Song Court is a good thing—let them go and make their own way.”

The higher Li Zhouwei’s Dao-Profundity grew, the deeper his understanding of the Bright Yang became. His words left the old man speechless. But Li Zhouwei’s expression turned grim.

“Especially Qian’er… He harbors resentment for his two younger brothers as well. If he didn't cultivate the Li Fire, their relationship would have already been irreconcilable. There can only be one Sovereign Father, and his descendants will scheme to be his only true son. Only then can they hope to one day replace him. The bright golden eyes… they all represent the same ambition.”

“To supplant and replace.”

He set down his cup.

“I am the same,” he whispered.

Li Xuanxuan’s lips parted several times, but no words came out. He was silent for a long moment, suddenly understanding why Li Zhouwei had been reluctant years ago to let Li Jianglong and the others be officially entered into the Li Clan’s generational records. Anxiously, he pushed his cup forward.

“Jiangqian… Jiangqian should be better!”

Li Zhouwei knew what the old man meant.

“He believes himself to be unique, that I have only one true son and the others are false,” he said quietly. “Otherwise… he wouldn't be the way he is today. But the root of his nature, the core of his heart—that cannot be erased.”

The two sat in silence for a time before Li Zhouwei changed the subject.

“What of the casualties by the lake?”

Li Xuanxuan let out a long sigh.

“The losses were tragic, but not enough to shake our foundation.”

The old man’s voice was low.

“This time was different from the attacks a few years ago. Most of the fallen were at the Embryonic Breathing stage or were mortal soldiers. The Buddhist cultivators and the Zhao army from the north were more interested in people. They either took them captive or killed them on the spot to harvest their blood. We only lost a dozen or so at the Qi Refining level, and about thirty with mixed Qi. Four at the Foundation Establishment Realm fell… two of them were men from the Song Court stationed in the Wilderness.”

“Of the remaining two, one was a rogue cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm who was training by our lake on the north shore. The other loss was more significant: Chen Yang’s own son, the eldest of the Chen Clan’s direct line, Chen Jinxi.”

“As for the heavily wounded, Qu Bushi and White Ape have been saved. Zhouda is able to walk again. Ding Weizeng and Li Minggong suffered only minor injuries…”

Li Zhouwei raised his eyebrows in surprise.

“Chen Jinxi…”

The Chen Clan’s prestige rested solely on Chen Yang. Chen Jinxi had been their great hope, and his death was a crippling blow to their strength. For Moongaze Lake, however, as long as the core family members were alive, their foundation remained unshaken.

He nodded. “The Chen Clan will need to be appeased. With Li Jianglong leaving the island, the family will need a pillar of strength. Do you have anyone in mind, old master?”

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard, pondering.

“By my calculations, Jiangzong should be coming out of seclusion soon. But the north shore is drenched in blood, and the turmoil in the family cannot wait… We’ll need Li Minggong to hold things together temporarily. Zhouming can be reckless, but his wife Shouyu is capable. Let Chen Yang and Jiangxia assist them.”

In truth, even if Jiangzong were already out of seclusion, he would still need to consult Li Minggong in a situation like this, so it made little difference. Li Zhouwei understood and nodded.

“My injuries prevent me from dividing my attention with family matters. I must ask you, old master, to guide them.”

He closed his eyes for a moment. The profound rhythm of the Dao was still flowing through his spiritual sense, seeming to resonate with something in the Great Void, further solidifying his Dao-Profundity.

He raised a hand and produced a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill. He dropped it into a teapot, tapped it lightly with a fingertip, and intoned an incantation:

“Give rise to the three yang, bring forth the light of spring. Let the Heart-Sutra blend with the medicine, to purify Qi and nourish the spirit.”

The clear tea in the pot instantly transformed. The generative power of the Bright Yang descended, coalescing into a pure white medicinal liquid. Li Zhouwei passed the pot to the old man.

“This brew is a concentration of the Bright Yang’s life-giving force. Within a day, it can regenerate limbs and restore Qi and blood. Take it down and distribute it among them. Have Sun Bai administer it according to the severity of their injuries. If any of the medicine’s power remains, it can be vented through intercourse. But they must not consume more than a single mouthful, or they risk the danger of their vital essence draining away.”

After this great battle, especially with the deaths of Taixi and Chiluo providing him feedback, Li Zhouwei’s Dao-Profundity, which had been just short of a breakthrough, finally took that crucial step. He had now surpassed the likes of Helian Wujiang and stood second only to the Great Daoist Masters!

‘My Dao-Profundity is already comparable to a Purple Mansion cultivator of average talent who has spent their entire life in diligent study. I even have some ability to make my words become law through intent! Back then, my great-uncle needed to find Sumian to heal Ding Weizeng, but now, I have no such need!’

He could now manifest all sorts of wondrous items imbued with the nature of the Bright Yang, though they would only last for a day at most. As his Dao-Profundity grew, the power of his divine abilities had subtly increased, and his healing and Qi circulation had become more efficient.

Beyond that, the speed at which he could master spell arts had risen dramatically, and he could faintly touch upon a much higher threshold of understanding.

‘If I advance one more step, reaching the realm beyond the Purple Mystery, where my divine abilities are truly my own—perhaps even the level of Chi Buzi or Changxiao—every move I make will be as powerful as a common third or fourth-grade Dharma Art. With careful study, I could even write my own third-grade arts. Only techniques of the fifth or sixth grade would be worth my time to cultivate…’

Though a third-grade Dharma Art might not seem high-level, it was a clear dividing line. The Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was born from the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature. Its cultivation methods and Dharma Arts all had ancient origins, most of them modified from older Daoist Traditions by later generations. Some arts were even used without any modification at all. For modern cultivators, their very foundation was built upon the work of their predecessors, a structured path designed to lower the barrier to entry. How could they possibly forge a new way? Writing one's own methods and arts was astonishingly difficult. A third-grade art was already an incredible achievement. People like Chi Buzi and Changxiao were all candidates for pursuing the Golden Core realm!

As Li Zhouwei made this assessment, his mind cleared.

‘Only cultivators with the Dao-Profundity and comprehension of Chi Buzi or Changxiao would be qualified to practice the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature from childhood. And even then, nine times out of ten, they wouldn’t achieve as much as they would with the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao.’

‘It’s a pity that the Illuminating Sun and Moon technique requires me to vanquish divine ability masters and defeat demonic Buddhists, and I let Mingxiang and Gongsun Bei escape… But no matter. A day will come when they cannot run.’

As he pondered this, he gave his instructions. Li Xuanxuan, naturally prioritizing his recovery above all else, did not linger and hurried back down the mountain. Li Zhouwei saw him off with a final reminder.

“When I enter seclusion, place Jiangxia on the eastern shore. If any envoys from the Song Court arrive, let him make his own decisions. He need not report to the clan.”

The old man scurried away. Li Zhouwei then activated his divine ability, his eyes flaring with sudden light. A torrential wave of dharma power surged through him as roiling umbral flames ignited, suppressing the Dawn Qi within his body. Strands of Pure Qi began to emerge, repairing his wounds.

The battle had brought an unexpected boon.

‘The Profound Qi truly is effective at dispelling Dawn Qi. It helped me a great deal… Perhaps it’s because the Great Qi, the source of the Dawn Qi, was destroyed by the Great Liang, and the Profound Qi is from the Great Liang’s Daoist Tradition…’

He frowned, deep in thought.

‘It seems the origins of the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts are far from simple. It must be a secret art of the Touba Family. If it’s so precious, how did it fall into the hands of a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator in my grandfather’s domain back then… and how did it happen to be the perfect method for suppressing Dawn Qi?’

Li Zhouwei did not believe in coincidences. Since he had obtained it in the Eastern Sea, the most likely culprits were the Dragon-kin. But he had been just a newborn at the time. The only power that could have reacted so quickly… was the Underworld.

But these matters were no longer important. With the help of the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body, his Perilous Tread ability resonated with his Talisman Qi, and when amplified by the Profound Vastness Art, Li Zhouwei was confident he could shorten his healing time to less than a year. If he also used the spiritual resources from Yang Ruiyi, he could likely be fully recovered in just over six months.

The damage to his Primal Summit Armour was also of no concern. The armour was forged from the Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough and possessed a miraculous ability to escape, which had been locked down by the Dawn Qi platform. It also had self-healing properties; he just needed to toss it into the baleful spring on Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

And though he hadn’t focused on cultivating his Sovereign's Perilous Tread these past two years, it had neared perfection on its own, growing stronger with each danger he overcame, his deepening connection to the White Qilin’s fate, and the rise of his Dao-Profundity and Talisman Qi!

“Give me a year or so, and not only will I have healed all my injuries, I can begin cultivating the Crimson Severing Arrowhead!”

The recent battle had instilled in him a profound sense of crisis. Li Zhouwei had come to a grim realization:

‘With Luoxia watching from the sidelines, the pressure from the north is only going to grow. This ferocious siege was likely just a probe. If I can't achieve a breakthrough in my divine abilities soon, the lake will become a river of blood!’

Although the Illuminating Sun and Moon technique was incredibly potent, there was a world of difference between slaying an opponent, merely suppressing them, or even being suppressed yourself. Li Zhouwei had gained little advantage against Mingxiang and Gongsun Bei this time. His cultivation would certainly continue to rise until he perfected his divine abilities, but the outcome of his Dao-Profundity would be completely different if the Buddhist cultivators calculated his strength and escaped every single time, versus if he managed to kill some of them in each major battle. The difference in the end would be as vast as heaven and earth!

‘With Luoxia refusing to intervene, the northern Buddhist cultivators will do everything they can to shorten my time to rest and cultivate… This last battle showed that they will never underestimate my strength. I must make them miscalculate… only then can I secure a kill.’

‘If that's the case, then according to the Song Emperor’s—or rather, the Northern Buddhists'—predictions, I should need five to ten years to heal. If I can break through to the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm in that time, I’m certain to gain the upper hand in the next major conflict. A victory, a kill, would further advance Illuminating Sun and Moon, allowing me to quietly accumulate enough Dao-Profundity… to increase my chances of pursuing the Golden Core.’

‘And both Jiangqian and Que'Wan have Talisman Seeds; their breakthrough times will be unexpected. If they both succeed, it will buy us more breathing room… If my great-uncle can advance further, to the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm… or if any of the talented juniors can reach the Purple Mansion… these are all variables…’

With a flick of his finger, he summoned a golden storage pouch from a nearby pillar. A waterfall of spirit rice poured out, vanishing into the demonic flames that blazed around him, continuously feeding his Dharma Body.

In that instant, he lowered his gaze, a different thought taking shape.

‘Luoxia’s refusal to participate is, in itself, a form of participation. It forces me to increase my cultivation level faster, which in turn shortens my preparation time… The north will not fear me until I become a Great Daoist Master. But the moment I do, I might have to face an eighth or even ninth-reincarnation Maha, or even masters who have perfected their divine abilities, like Changxiao and Wei Xuanyin! They want me to ascend to the throne in perfect form.’

Happy New Year, everyone!




# Chapter 1047: The Riddle of the Water Mansion

The sea surged, and colossal waves clawed at the sky.

**BOOM!**

Purple lightning webbed the horizon as dark clouds, driven by chaotic winds, swept across the sky. The spiritual energy above the ocean roiled in turmoil, forcing the few streaks of light that had been soaring through the air to descend and take refuge on the water's surface.

A dense, cyan light churned upon the waves, resembling a colossal beast with hunched shoulders and a curved back. It cast a fine, jade-green shimmer across the water. From the heavens, a gigantic treasured cauldron materialized, pinning the light to the surface of the sea.

The cyan light finally solidified, revealing a colossal Profound Giant Turtle with a green shell. Two horns sprouted from its head, its claws and fangs were wickedly sharp, and its back was encrusted with countless white corals and jewels that dripped with the light of the Water Mansion.

Its jade-green eyes, as vast as temple doors, snapped open, revealing a fierce and glacial gaze. As its massive maw parted, its rows of sharp, bone-white teeth glinted ominously.

"You Daoist Master... you are truly insatiable!"

The treasured cauldron at the zenith trembled. From the surging cascade of Pristine Water, a figure in azure robes materialized, pausing in the sky with the ease of a leisurely stroll. He smiled faintly.

"Great King, aren't you being a bit unreasonable?" he said. "I only seek a single item, and I'm prepared to negotiate a fair trade. How could you call that insatiable?"

The green-backed turtle withdrew its massive form, plummeting from the sky and transforming into a sturdy, broad-faced old man clad in thick scale armor. He shot the robed figure a cold, sarcastic glance.

"If you came to negotiate, then why trap me with a Spiritual Artifact formation? Does sealing off every escape route seem like a gesture of good faith?"

Chi Buzi lowered his hands, cupping a string of dark green beads in his palm. With a gentle caress, they scattered a clear light that coalesced into a table before him. Only then did he speak, a smile playing on his lips.

"You spend most of your time in the deep sea, Great King. A single slumber could last for years, even decades. It wasn't easy to find an opportunity to speak with you. I couldn't possibly have you stand around while we talk. Consider this Spiritual Treasure formation a temporary hall of audience, erected so that I would not be a discourteous host."

The old man, the transformed Demon King, was struck speechless. After a moment's pause, he replied, "I have truly underestimated your shamelessness, Chi Buzi."

He was a Demon King who had cultivated for countless years and had long since surpassed the realm of Purple Mystery. With his extraordinary bloodline, he had no reason to fear this younger cultivator. However, a battle between them would be nothing short of cataclysmic. He had survived for so long by maintaining a low profile and had no desire for such a commotion now.

Chi Buzi smiled, seemingly aware of the Demon King's thoughts. Unperturbed, he sat at the table, produced a flask of wine from his sleeve, and said, "I have long heard of Senior Zeng Zan's esteemed reputation. Attainment in the Water Mansion Dao is rare. Tell me, Great King... how confident are you of your chances?"

Zeng Zan stared at him.

"It is not as if you are unaware of my situation, fellow Daoist Chi," he said flatly. "For one such as myself, the path of cultivation is fraught with difficulty. I hold little hope for a breakthrough in this life. My only recourse is to strive for a Dao Body in my next incarnation, and seek a higher station then."

Chi Buzi understood perfectly what he meant. Reincarnation into a human body would allow him to cultivate through the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao or the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature. He clapped his hands. "A sound plan, fellow Daoist. But have you considered seeking an Auxiliary Position, or perhaps an Intercalary Position?"

The two of them were hardly close. For Chi Buzi to raise such a topic unprompted meant he had a hidden agenda. The question was not for Zeng Zan's benefit, but a reflection of his own ambition. Zeng Zan fixed him with a stare.

"Are you seeking an Intercalary Position, fellow Daoist Chi, or an Auxiliary one?"

Chi Buzi took a sip of wine, his gaze unwavering. He made no attempt to conceal his intentions.

"I cultivate the Pristine Water Dao," he said plainly. "And I have sought you out, a true master of the Water Mansion Dao. My purpose should be obvious. The connection between our paths is clear as day."

Zeng Zan's eyes narrowed, his expression deceptively calm.

"Oh? So you have designs on the Water Mansion Dao?"

Both men were cultivators on the level of a Great Daoist Master. This was a dangerously sensitive topic. If Chi Buzi were to stake a claim on the Water Mansion Dao, their positions would inevitably clash, a conflict that could easily escalate into a battle to the death.

Chi Buzi stared at him, then raised an eyebrow. "Senior, you have witnessed ages come and go. You cannot possibly be ignorant of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. There is no need for these games."

Zeng Zan knew that Chi Buzi possessed four divine abilities. With the truth laid bare, he dropped the pretense. 

"You command four divine abilities," he said, a curious light in his eyes. 

"The Pristine Water Dao is already claimed. The volatile nature of the Pit path makes it impassable. That leaves the Daos of Converging Water, Water Mansion, and Valley Water. Why are you so fixated on mine?"

The old Demon King chuckled.

"If you are so averse to reincarnation, then fine. But the Converging Water Dao favors an Intercalary Position. To reject that path seems irrational. Is it that you do not trust the Dragon-kin?"

'Reincarnation?' Chi Buzi scoffed inwardly.

He knew exactly how petty that person was. A failsafe had been planted in his very soul. He was being given this chance to achieve his Dao only because he remained useful. If he were to reincarnate, what value would he have left? A swift death on the spot would be a mercy.

Zeng Zan, whose Dao-Profundity surpassed even Chi Buzi's after ages of cultivation, naturally understood that the Valley Water Dao was the path of reincarnation. Since Chi Buzi had rejected that option, only two choices remained.

Chi Buzi's face darkened. He watched the Demon King in silence for a moment before speaking.

"The Converging Water Dao may favor an Intercalary Position, but in the last millennium, countless cultivators have tried and failed to claim it. The conflict between the Pristine Water and Converging Water Daos is terrifyingly deep. I suspect... it is connected to the Dragon-kin's pursuit of becoming True Dragons."

"Oh?" Zeng Zan's expression shifted subtly.

"Perhaps your predecessors simply lacked the necessary Dao-Profundity. If you were to master the Converging Water Dao and break free from the Pristine Water Dao's influence, you would naturally be aligned with the Dragon-kin. When the time comes for them to achieve their ultimate form, why would they refuse another powerful ally? They would surely aid you."

"You believe the master of the Pristine Water Dao will never let you go. Without the support of the Dragon-kin, your chances of success would be even more remote!"

But Chi Buzi's eyes were sharp and clear, his conviction unshaken. His expression turned chillingly cold.

"The True Hornless Dragon was a Great Sage. How could he not know that one being cannot hold two Fruition Attainments? His fall was no accident. A great terror lies within the convergence of the Pristine and Converging Water Daos. That path clearly favors an Intercalary Position, and the Hornless Dragon lineage is vast, yet it remains limited to a single Fruition Attainment. This is by design. If I were to blindly interfere, I would be courting death. And in an era such as this? To pursue that Intercalary Position at this critical juncture would, in the eyes of the Dragon Monarch, mark me as not an ally, but a fool or a saboteur."

Zeng Zan stared at him for a long moment before nodding slowly.

"Impressive."

A cold smile touched Chi Buzi's lips.

"But if I pursue an Intercalary Position within the Water Mansion Dao, is there any reason the Dragon-kin could not support me? In this grand game, the Converging Water path is a death trap. Water Mansion is my only chance at survival."

Though his tone was firm, his eyes remained fixed on Zeng Zan's face as the old Demon King contemplated his words. Finally, Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow.

"I know you only consider reincarnation because you cannot attain the Auxiliary Position. In those years, Dongfang Ai... no, the Hornless Dragon lineage, orchestrated the loss of the Water Mansion's Vast Ocean. The Auxiliary Position has been sealed ever since. When the last True Monarch holding that position finally perished, the world's lakes and marshes withered overnight... Your plan to reincarnate is for the same goal as mine: to claim the Intercalary Position of the Water Mansion Dao."

"And if someone like me were to secure that Intercalary Position first, would I not be the perfect tool to test the Dragon Monarch's intentions on your behalf?"

Zeng Zan continued to stare. Chi Buzi said calmly,

"Lakes and marshes nurture the waters; they are complementary forces. If I succeed, how could a noble scion of the Water Mansion Dao, such as yourself, be left without a place to stand?"

Zeng Zan hesitated. "But the Dragon Monarch's relationship with the Water Mansion Dao..."

The man in cyan robes took a step forward.

"I know the Dragon Monarch does not wish to see the Water Mansion Dao grow strong," he said flatly. "An Intercalary Position might be tolerable, but by claiming it, I reveal my ambition—and potential—to seize a full Fruition Attainment. On any normal day, he would rather sacrifice me than allow the Water Mansion Dao to flourish. But today is not a normal day."

His eyes gleamed with insight.

"Today, the Dragon-kin are pursuing their ultimate goal: the Dao of the True Dragons! If they fail, the world will be thrown into upheaval. They might not even have the strength to hold the Eastern Sea, let alone spare any attention for the Water Mansion. They would surely lose control of it. In that chaos, I, at least, would be an asset they helped create, one with shared interests and a karmic link."

"And if they succeed?" A faint smile. "Then they have even less reason to worry about me. The Converging Water Dao would no longer be synonymous with the Dragon-kin. What would it matter then if the Water Mansion thrived? They would be a realm above. I would naturally fall in line, and my ambitions would become irrelevant."

The man gathered his sleeves.

"This is also why I am certain you will pursue the Water Mansion Dao in your next life. You have remained at your current stage precisely to avoid provoking the Dragon Monarch, waiting for this grand situation to resolve before making your move."

Zeng Zan watched him for a long time.

"You have calculated everything so clearly," he said in a low voice. "You understand that my own opportunity will come only after the Dragon-kin have made their move. Aren't you afraid that my own ambition will grow? That I will come to resent you for taking the first step and seizing the opportunity that should have been mine?"

Zeng Zan's tone had shifted, but Chi Buzi simply laughed.

"Of course not. The Profound Giant Turtle clan was betrayed so horribly back then. As a descendant, Senior, you live in fear. Who knows if the Dragon-kin would even permit you to ascend? From any angle you look at it, I am a far more suitable candidate."

He took another step forward, the depths of his eyes unreadable, and smiled. 

"I came here today to make one thing clear, Senior. I must achieve my Dao first. Only then will your own opportunity arise."

Zeng Zan stared, his resolve wavering.

'He... he might actually have a chance!'

The old Demon King's voice was hollow.

"What do you want?"

A light flared in Chi Buzi's eyes. His gaze shifted from Zeng Zan's face to his forehead.

"I want your horns."

The old demon was silent. Chi Buzi's voice, however, burned with ambition.

"I am currently cultivating the Morning Cold Rain of the Water Mansion Dao. It is similar to the Clear Dusk Rain, derived from an ancient, isolated text. It is a perfect method for harmonizing the Daos of Pristine Water and Water Mansion. My only problem is my lack of affinity for the Water Mansion Dao itself, which makes my progress painfully slow."

"But if I had your horns... I could grind them into a draught to be consumed annually. It would not only enhance my divine ability and dharma power, but through your bloodline as a descendant of the Profound Giant Turtle, it would grant me a greater affinity for the Water Mansion Dao."

The naked greed in his eyes was impossible to miss. Zeng Zan looked up, his gaze intense.

"I do not begrudge you a pair of old horns," he said softly. "But you, Chi Buzi, have always treated life as worthless. You are faithless, greedy, and malicious. You claim you will help me after you achieve your Dao. How could I possibly believe you?"

Chi Buzi looked momentarily stunned, then his handsome face twisted into a mask of derision as he burst out laughing.

"A promise from me? Of course you wouldn't believe it! Your assessment is perfectly correct. It is indeed uncertain whether I would help you. But Senior! If you don't help me, I will certainly retaliate after I achieve my Dao!"

He shrugged, the last vestiges of his transcendent aura vanishing completely. 

A cruel smile played on his lips.

"Or perhaps... I will simply take them myself!"

Zeng Zan stared at him, a strange feeling rising in his heart.

'Chi Wei was a villain, but he had his moments of integrity... This junior, however, is something else. He acts with brazen confidence, yet he despises morality and is utterly unscrupulous. He is a true monster, one who revels in his own evil!'

The two stood in silent opposition above the sea. The thunder overhead grew louder, a dense web of purple lightning covering the sky. Drawn by the power of Heavy Murk, the roiling clouds cascaded downward like a waterfall.

**BOOM!**

A towering wave crashed back into the ocean with a world-shaking roar. The light from the treasured cauldron abruptly receded. In Chi Buzi's hand, a pair of dark horns had appeared.

In their true form, the horns were as large as mountains, but they had been shrunk by divine ability to the size of two short swords. He held them easily in one hand. Mystical patterns, like ripples on a lake, flowed across their surface, emitting a faint white halo. They were clearly a treasure of profound power.

But Chi Buzi's attention was not on the horns. His eyes were fixed on Zeng Zan, probing his condition. The great cyan cauldron still hung in the sky, and the aura of Heavy Murk radiated a deadly pressure.

The young man stared at the old Demon King, a curious expression on his face—part concern, part something far more calculating.

"Senior..." he said softly. "Are you alright?"

'Losing his horns would surely leave the old turtle weakened. And why settle for two horns when I could have the entire creature? As for everything I just said... what does it matter if it was true or false?'

But Zeng Zan's expression was serene.

"These are the horns I shed when I broke through to the realm of Purple Mystery."

"Oh."

With that single word, all the celestial phenomena vanished. Chi Buzi showed no sign of embarrassment at his scheme being foiled. Instead, he clicked his tongue, a look of mild disappointment on his face. Clasping his hands behind his back, he held the horns and smiled.

"I have the utmost respect for you, Senior. Please don't take my little jest to heart."

Despite his words, the treasured cauldron in the sky showed no signs of being withdrawn.

Zeng Zan remained expressionless. He leaped into the air, his form blurring and expanding, transforming back into the mountain-sized, green-backed Profound Giant Turtle. He let out a deafening roar as his _true_ pair of cyan horns blazed into view, radiating the vast light of the Water Mansion.

**BOOM!**

Only after seeing this new pair of horns with his own eyes did Chi Buzi reluctantly dismiss his Spiritual Treasure. With a flick of his sleeve, he reappeared a short distance away, effortlessly dodging the lingering wisps of white light.

"Take care, Senior!" he called out politely.

With a thunderous crash of waves, the colossal turtle vanished from the sky. Chi Buzi brushed his sleeves, dispelling the lingering traces of Water Mansion energy that clung to him.

"He's lived too long," he sighed with regret. "A difficult one to fool..."

He brought the two horns before him, examining them closely. There was no joy in his expression, no satisfaction at having obtained a key treasure—only a cold, condescending scrutiny.

The wind and rain around him ceased in an instant. The confident swagger and brazen arrogance he had displayed while discussing the Water Mansion Daoist Tradition vanished like a phantom. Chi Buzi's gaze lifted from the horns in his hand and settled on the now-calm surface of the water.

In the distance, a silver-robed figure stood upon the waves.

His face was as handsome as carved jade, with sharp eyebrows angled toward his temples, a high-bridged nose, and a noble brow. A pair of long, silver horns grew from his head, and his pale blue eyes were fixed on the horizon.

Behind him, a behemoth as vast as a mountain range floated low in the water, its back bearing a sprawling complex of palaces. Chi Buzi's expression grew grave.

'A Dragon King...'

He had suspected the Dragon-kin were watching him. His expression remained unchanged as he activated a divine ability, reappearing ten paces from the massive beast. He noted that no other Demon Kings came forward to intercept him; this member of the Hornless Dragon lineage seemed to be alone, still admiring the distant scenery.

Chi Buzi narrowed his eyes.

'What immense prestige... An ordinary Dragon King would not travel with such a colossal mount. This must be a crown prince, or perhaps one who serves the Dragon Monarch directly...'

A sense of caution filled him. He moved forward slowly and bowed.

"This humble cultivator pays his respects to the Dragon King!"

The silver-robed young man did not turn his head. He simply raised a hand, gesturing for silence, his gaze fixed on the horizon with keen interest.

Unsure what this dragon was planning, Chi Buzi bowed slightly and followed his line of sight. He narrowed his eyes, and his dharma power instantly brought the hazy, distant scene into sharp focus.

'That's... Merging Fire...'

# Chapter 1048: Crushed

"Dragon King…"

Chi Buzi watched the distant chase for a moment but quickly lost interest. It was just a few minor cultivators squabbling. He turned his attention back to the great dragon beside him.

With a single step, the creature of the Hornless Dragon lineage summoned a table and chairs of jade-white emerald from the surface of the water. A flagon of spirit wine rested silently on the tabletop. The Demon beast sat and gestured with a smile.

"Please."

Chi Buzi took his seat with composure. The Demon beast’s smile remained.

"At a banquet today, the Monarchs were discussing how the Undefeated King of Brightness gave birth to all manner of evils. The elders in my clan performed divinations and concluded that such a thing could only happen because the monarch-father was unwell, his yang energy stagnating. This piqued my curiosity, so I made a special trip to see for myself."

He raised his cup and nodded to the Great Daoist Master before turning his gaze to the horizon.

"I never thought I would run into you, Master," he said coolly. "Why don't we watch together? Once this little drama concludes, we can speak properly."

A flicker of interest appeared in Chi Buzi’s venomous eyes. He smiled.

"This humble cultivator is at your service."

---

The sea and sky were a brilliant, clear blue.

The storm had subsided as quickly as it had appeared, leaving the heavens bright and sunny. Li Jiangnian set the two cultivators he held onto the ground and retracted his true essence.

"The winds here are fierce and the waters are teeming with Demon beasts," he said softly.

"You two are only of mixed-qi. You must be more careful next time; you won't always be lucky enough to run into me."

The two men immediately dropped to their knees, weeping with a thousand thanks.

"Honorable elder… we will never forget this for as long as we live! You saved our lives!"

They had been traveling through the sea when they were suddenly caught in a demonic squall. They owed their survival entirely to his intervention. Who would have thought such a kind soul existed in the Eastern Sea? Their gratitude was boundless, a testament to their incredible fortune.

Li Jiangnian stood where he was, basking in the warmth of their tearful thanks. A pleasant sense of satisfaction washed over him.

He knew they weren't good men. As a scion of an Immortal Clan, he could tell at a glance that they regularly consumed blood-food. But then, how many cultivators in the Eastern Sea didn't? It made no difference to him. All he cared about were these few words of genuine, heartfelt gratitude.

When their thanks had run dry, Li Jiangnian adopted a lofty posture and spoke gently,

"I have saved you today, so you must no longer consume blood-food. Focus on performing good deeds and accumulating merit. Your virtue will surely be rewarded."

The two men on the ground exchanged a peculiar look, but they quickly agreed, 

"Yes, yes, of course." 

They watched the masked young master ride the wind and soar away before they began to whisper animatedly.

"Was that… the Jade Young Master from the reef isles?"

The other man nodded with conviction. "It had to be him. That kind of talk about not partaking of the mortal world… sounds exactly like something he'd say. We’re lucky, brother. We got out of that with our lives. I hear he’s generous, kind-hearted, and easy to get along with. With this connection… maybe we can get a spot under his command and sip some of the meat broth…"

His companion’s eyes lit up, but his expression remained a bit strange.

"His behavior is bizarre, though… No blood-food, performing good deeds… Does that sound like a cultivator from the Eastern Sea? He talks about good being rewarded, but the real reward is the wealth he has to share. All the people he helps end up clinging to him, praising him like he's their own father…"

"That's enough!"

The words sent a chill down his companion's spine. He grabbed his friend's arm, his face pale.

"We’re too badly injured," he whispered urgently. "I've never been to this island, but it looks inhabited. Let's find the locals and get a few households' worth of blood-food to recover."

While the two demonic cultivators schemed, the renowned Jade Young Master was already humming a tune as he soared through the sky, feeling utterly pleased with himself.

In truth, Li Jiangnian was a coward. In his early days, he had been terrified of leaving home, certain he would be murdered. But when he finally ventured out, he discovered that no one recognized him. He lacked the golden eyes, the aura of Bright Yang dharma power, and the dignified bearing of his clan. Even if he claimed to be the son of King Wei, no one would believe him.

Coming to the Eastern Sea all these years ago had been an immense relief. He fashioned a mask for himself and lived a life of leisure. The islanders all respected him. For the first few years, Li Que'wan would still force him to practice his spell arts, but then his older sister went into seclusion to cultivate a secret technique. Finally, no one was left to control him!

Only then did he truly taste the wonderful life of an immortal scion. A single call brought a hundred responses; no one dared to defy him. Though he was timid and still mindful of the rules from his life back at the lake, never daring to parade around the island with a large entourage, he was clever. Under the guise of training, he traveled far and wide, helping rogue cultivators and collecting their fawning praise.

Sometimes, when he was in a foul mood and his hands itched for action, he would seek out islands with weak defenses. Relying on his superior strength, he would pretend he was about to launch a massacre to eradicate demonic cultivators. He would wait until the cultivators who consumed blood-food kowtowed desperately, crippling their own cultivation, and then, after savoring their pleas and flattery, he would depart magnanimously. Even if word of his actions spread, he was seen as a paragon of righteousness. He had even earned the title of the Jade Young Master.

Compared to this, his old life by the lake had been nothing but misery!
Though he occasionally felt a pang of guilt, aware of his own ugly thoughts, the feeling of absolute power was more intoxicating than any brothel or gambling den. He would quickly cast the regrets aside. Now, as he rode the wind contentedly, he squinted and saw a fierce streak of Merging Fire in the distance.

"Hm?"

Li Jiangnian narrowed his eyes. As he channeled his true essence, the form within the Merging Fire became clear, startling him.

'A cultivator…'

The man was ferocious, his face covered in brutish muscle. He wore a black daoist robe, and his expression was savage. In his hand, he held a circular dharma artifact that pulsed with the thick light of Merging Fire.

Fleeing before the fire was a silver streak of escaping light. Within it was a young woman with delicate eyebrows and red lips. Her cheeks were slightly full, making her exceptionally pretty. Her dharma robes were gone, leaving her in a thin white shift that revealed a graceful and alluring figure.

But she was clearly injured. Her face was as pale as paper, and blood stained her lips, giving her a pitiful, heart-wrenching appearance. She gasped for breath.

'This should be the right direction… Deer Weeds Island…'

Guo Gemei’s heart was pounding with terror.

Her family needed to repair their Great Purple Mansion Formation and was short on materials. The younger generation, under their parents' orders, had taken spirit items to various market cities to make purchases. It shouldn't have been a life-threatening task; she had done it more than once. But somehow… after a few minor disputes with this man, he now wanted to kill her!

She knew he was a cultivator from Crimson Reef Island, and she knew her own clan had always warned her that those from Crimson Reef were not to be trifled with. She had swallowed her pride and held her tongue. She never imagined that a single retort would earn her a death sentence!

'The Moongaze Li Clan is an ally of my family, and I've rested on Deer Weeds before… If I can just make it there… someone will save me!'

She fought desperately for her life, but Li Jiangnian, watching from above, paused and understood the situation at once.

'So, a chase between two minor cultivators…'

Neither of them was very powerful. Li Jiangnian observed them coldly for a few moments and recognized the man's attire.

'Merging Fire… he's from Crimson Reef Island. My family has never been on good terms with them. And today, he just so happens to fall into my hands.'

He immediately soared into the air. Spreading his five fingers, he summoned the rolling winds. A jade-like color crept over his body, transforming into a dazzling suit of jade armor. His stooped figure was completely hidden beneath this immortal foundation, giving him the sudden appearance of a handsome and heroic figure, as elegant as a jade tree in the wind.

_Jade Court General_!

With a thought, a jade spear materialized in his palm. Li Jiangnian raised his arm and threw it with all his might.

_Voom…_

The jade spear shot forward like an arrow of light, arriving in an instant. The brutish man was only at the Qi Refining realm; how could he possibly withstand such an attack? He had no time to react. He looked down abruptly to see the spear had pierced through his chest, leaving nothing but an empty cavity.

He couldn't utter a single word. A futile spurt of blood escaped his lips before he exploded into countless flames in mid-air, raining down from the sky. Guo Gemei was already at her limit. The sudden turn of events left her both terrified and overjoyed. But then, a vast wave of Jade True light swept over her. She coughed up a mouthful of blood, the magical wind beneath her feet faltered, and she began to plummet.

In a flash, an arm that seemed forged from solid jade caught her. Overwhelmed with fear, Guo Gemei could only cry out, "Thank you, Senior!"

A gentle, youthful voice replied,

"There is no need for thanks. Crimson Reef Island and my Deer Weeds have long been enemies. It was merely a small effort!"

"Deer Weeds?!"

Guo Gemei now understood why he had helped her. A wave of shock and joy washed over her, followed by a strange fluttering in her heart. Hearing that soft, young voice, a blush rose to her cheeks. She pursed her red lips, her own voice becoming delicate.

"So you are the Young Master of the immortal isle!"

Her words sent a rush of heat to the back of Li Jiangnian’s head. Guo Gemei was truly beautiful. As she lay softly in his arms, the smooth, snow-white skin of her neck was exposed, forcing him to swallow hard.

The Jade True shockwave had, of course, been deliberate. He wanted her to fall right into his embrace—wasn't that how it always happened in the storybooks?

Guo Gemei was a few years older than him and saw through his ploy. She smiled knowingly, and Li Jiangnian immediately blushed. But his mind raced, and he quickly averted his gaze, feigning awkwardness.

"My apologies… Miss. My family is very strict. I have been cultivating alone for over thirty years… and have given little thought to the propriety between men and women…"

'A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator at thirty!'

As Li Jiangnian shifted, Guo Gemei instinctively wrapped her arm around his. She knit her brows and let out a few soft hums.

"It hurts…"

Li Jiangnian immediately raised his hand and said with a serious expression, 

"Let me heal your injuries."

With a slightly trembling hand, he placed his palm on her neck. A surge of Jade True dharma power flowed into her, causing her face to flush an even deeper red. However, while the _Jade Court General_ ability was powerful, it possessed no healing properties; in fact, it could even hinder recovery. Li Jiangnian was unskilled in this area to begin with, and he was afraid of hurting her. He focused his full attention on the task, cold sweat beading beneath his mask.

Guo Gemei, however, was oblivious. The mask completely hid the man's face. How could she know that this Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was struggling with her minor injuries? The cool, jade-like touch lingered on her neck, making her blush deepen.

His dharma power surged through her limbs, a distinctly sensitive feeling. And the external manifestation of the _Jade Court General_ was that of a mighty, heroic, and dashing immortal general. For a moment, Guo Gemei's heart was thrown into turmoil.

'The disciples from the Southern Sea that Father found for me… how could any of them compare to a young master from an Immortal Clan? And one so tall and powerful…'

In that moment, as if guided by fate, she raised her hand. Her slender, jade-like fingers touched the man's mask. She stared at him intently, causing Li Jiangnian to freeze. He looked back at her, dumbfounded, his heart pounding as he lost himself in the moment.

It wasn't that Li Jiangnian had never been with a woman. Though his family was strict, after coming to the Eastern Sea, plenty of women had thrown themselves at him. But he was born ugly, and he was an extremely sensitive person. He saw the revulsion in their eyes, which always left him feeling dejected and resentful.

'This is too perfect… to have a woman look at me with such tenderness. It should stay this way forever…'

He had always thought that gaining the world's approval was his life's greatest dream. But seeing the look in her eyes, that desire was met with a strange, more extreme form of satisfaction. It left him trembling, lost in a daze from which he could not escape.

Then, he felt a coolness on his face.

Guo Gemei, her heart filled with amorous feelings, had removed his mask.

The woman's affectionate pupils dilated to their absolute limit. The lingering tenderness had not yet faded. She took a deep breath, a swallowing motion freezing halfway down her throat before being suppressed. Her expression twisted into a look of disgust so profound it was horrifying.

If his father Li Zhouwei’s allure was an unearned gift from the heavens, an effect of his Metallic Essence that made people naturally fall for him, then Li Jiangnian’s ugliness was, in a way, just as powerful. Even though the Jade True power was adept at transformation, and he had spent the first half of his life trying to change his appearance, the result was still an innate, uncontrollable ugliness that repulsed people on sight—and in this moment, he had no time to use any artifice to conceal it.

This very ugliness had made Li Jiangnian an expert in reading expressions. His swollen, narrow eyes easily caught her look of barely suppressed nausea. The man's face twitched, twisting the lingering smile on his lips into a chaotic mess.

It made him even uglier, yet a sliver of hope remained in his eyes.

Guo Gemei desperately tore her gaze away. A strained smile appeared on her deathly pale face. Her hands, now hard as stone, pushed against his chest. Her once-soft body went rigid.

"Young Master," she said woodenly, "I am fine now."

He had been through this a hundred, a thousand times before. But this time, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. When this perfect moment shattered into a million pieces, what rose from the depths of his heart was not sorrow or dejection, but a terrifying, electrifying storm of rage.

'Bitch!! Bitch, bitch, bitch!'

His pupils, patterned with the texture of jade, instantly turned bloodshot. The hand that had rested on her tender neck as gently as a lover's suddenly clenched. Her delicate flesh, like tofu, burst between his fingers, splattering everywhere.

A look of stunned horror was frozen on Guo Gemei's face as her head flew high into the air. Her lovely chest and graceful body exploded, reduced to an unrecognizable paste in the furious cultivator's grasp, unleashing a rain of blood!

In the space of a breath, she had been crushed to smithereens by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.

The splattered blood coated his Jade True form. The blood-soaked immortal cultivator held her lone head in his hands and let out a hysterical roar.

"How could you?! How could you! I saved you… I saved you! You were supposed to love me, you bitch!"

The flesh on the severed head disintegrated into ash amidst his roars, splattering across his face and hair in a mess of red and white. All that remained was a delicate, pretty skull, the pale-white ligaments contracting, reflected in his eyes.

Li Jiangnian froze.

He frowned distractedly, as if trying to identify what he was holding. In an instant, the skull felt like a red-hot branding iron, and he dropped it as if struck by lightning.

"..."

Li Jiangnian staggered back a few steps in mid-air, a chill seeping into his very bones. He stumbled onto a reef below, landing like a bewildered pelican, standing numbly in the water.

"Bitch…"

In a daze, he hurriedly looked down and began to wash his hands with trembling fingers in the seawater that came up to his waist. He scrubbed for a long time, but the bloodstains in the crevices of his hands would not come clean. Only then did he belatedly retract his immortal foundation and stand there, blankly.

His reflection in the water showed a figure in a white robe, without a single speck of red. As the miraculous power faded, the woman's flesh and bone had already been cleansed away by his dharma power.

Still, the man took off the robe and threw it into the sea, watching it drift away like a departing spirit. He put on an identical one, then stared at his reflection for a moment. His own face nearly made him vomit. He quickly fumbled in his sleeve for his mask, but his hands were shaking so badly he couldn't get a grip. It fell from his left hand to his right, then slipped into the water. After several attempts, Li Jiangnian finally managed to place it back on his face.

The sun was setting rapidly in the distance, painting a beautiful scene across the sea and sky. Li Jiangnian hid his cold hands in his sleeves and stared blankly at the water's surface, suddenly feeling as if he were trapped in a deep dream.

_Gurgle…_

In the twilight dusk, a ripple disturbed the calm water. The woman's bleached skull was pushed back by the waves, bobbing to the surface like a playful fish. A few shreds of red flesh clinging to it swayed in the current, looking all the more crimson in the light of the setting sun.
