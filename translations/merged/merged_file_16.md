# Chapter 799: Peacock

When Li Wushao asked, Li Xuanxuan immediately shook his head and replied:

“Naturally, nothing is settled. Back then, Chenghuai's marriage was arranged when Zhi'er and Yang Xiao'er returned home to visit family. Now, we only have this one child, and no news has come from the sect. The clan can only set the matter aside…”

“Moreover, Zhi'er is not who he used to be. He is a major figure in the Southern Sea. This matter requires even more caution…”

When Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er had returned home to visit those few times, the Foundation Establishment grand array on Qingdu Peak hadn't even been constructed. It couldn't compare to the current state of a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan, to say nothing of Li Xizhi holding such status now. After the old man finished speaking, Li Wushao nodded:

“Master and Mistress said that in the past, they only hoped the Young Master could grow up safely and continue the family bloodline, so they specifically selected the Ding clan. Now that Zhouluo is grown, his marriage is especially critical. Several families and sects have shown interest. Some have even paid Master a visit. In the years the Young Master has been head of the family, they've come even more frequently…”

Li Xuanxuan nodded repeatedly. He certainly hoped Li Zhouluo would find a good wife. The old man said, somewhat tactfully, “We must also pay attention to mutual affection... If things turn ugly later, we will end up offending people.”

“That is only natural.”

Li Wushao, perhaps not fully understanding his meaning, cupped his hands.

“Master's intention is this: before Young Master Zhouluo reaches Foundation Establishment, he should first make a trip to the Southern Sea. He will live with Master for a period, meet the young ladies from several prominent families and sects, and cultivate some feelings. He will marry right there. Once everything is arranged and he breaks through to Foundation Establishment, he can decide if he wishes to return.”

Li Xuanxuan was flabbergasted. “This… isn't that putting on too many airs? What if it makes all the families unhappy…”

“Haha!” Li Wushao laughed and shook his head.

“It is not excessive in the slightest! Old Master, you are not in the Southern Sea, so you do not know. Today, wherever Master goes in the Southern Sea, he is the guest of honor. Zhouluo is the master of a direct line Purple Mansion Immortal Clan, the Daoist Master's grand-nephew, of Yue royal blood, and the grandson of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion Master. He himself is a first-class talent. Which family wouldn't be rushing to present themselves?”

Li Xuanxuan understood the calculation. He mused internally:

'Ximing said that Yang Tianya is still lurking in some dark corner. That means he (Zhouluo) also has the bloodline of that Yang family Daoist Master. Indeed…'

Li Wushao continued without stopping:

“Besides this matter, there is the issue of Qi-Plucking Peak. The current Peak Lord is Peak Lord Lin Wuning. When she heard I was coming to the lake, she visited me repeatedly, asking me to carry a message. She said that the Azure Pond Sect harvests five types of 'Qi' from the lake, three of which cannot be found anywhere else. Now, damn it, they're being all polite, saying they hope to establish a place with the Moongaze Immortal Clan to serve as a foothold for the Azure Pond Sect. This way, when they come to gather Qi in the future, they'll have a proper procedure to follow.”

His mouth split into a grin. “So the Azure Pond Sect has this day too. How satisfying.”

Li Xuanxuan pondered this and knew it referred to things like the Golden Autumn in the Lake Qi. Most were unique to the Azure Pond Sect. The Moonlake Autumn Reflection Technique was very famous. His own family possessed the Supreme Yin Lunar Essence, but they didn't dare use it. It was quite the dilemma.

A thought struck him, and he asked, “What kind of people usually gather this Qi? They probably wouldn't send Foundation Establishment cultivators. They have all sworn the Profound Scenary Spirit Oath…”

“Correct.”

Li Wushao had clearly learned a thing or two at the Azure Pond Sect and understood the subtle meaning. He pulled him into the hall and lowered his voice.

“Old Master, this Qi-Plucking Peak naturally doesn't send Foundation Establishment cultivators to gather Qi. The Dao of Qi-gathering is always treated as a top priority. The key to the Golden Autumn in the Lake Qi is the Summoning Radiance Technique. Unless one were to search their souls…”

Li Xuanxuan actually chuckled and replied, “There is no rush. Just let their people come and gather the Qi.”

Li Wushao nodded heavily. Soon, he saw Quan Yuduan and the other disciple return. However, these two Azure Pond disciples deliberately avoided the other side as they returned, seemingly unwilling to run into the cultivators from Purple Smoke Gate. Their tour had not been enjoyable; they seemed constrained and awkward.

Wang Quwan was already waiting on the lake. Li Xuanxuan could only take Li Wushao out to see them off. Quan Yuduan saw the two from afar and smiled.

“Old Ancestor, we will head out now. We will return to see the senior when our business is concluded.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded. “Be careful in all things.”

The group headed north together. Li Xuanxuan saw them off past the lake. The sky darkened again. The lake was wrapped in silence. The Purple Smoke Gate cultivators, who had been hiding on their isle, also emerged. Several streaks of purple qi pierced the air and flew away lightly.

***

Peacock Sea.

The further north one traveled, the more magnificent and iridescent the waters of the Peacock Sea became. By the time one reached the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour in the far northeast, the seawater beneath the sacred bronze mountain already displayed a fantastical, shifting, five-hued brilliance, changing colors repeatedly with the sunlight. Patches of coral floated on the surface, moving like living fish and snakes.

Looking down from the sacred bronze mountain, one could still see several black dots squirming on the sea's surface, kowtowing with every single step as they approached the mountain. Coral naturally rose up to support them, allowing them to walk upon the sea as if on flat ground.

But the mountain was full of peacocks leaping and hopping, chasing each other playfully. When several mortals finished kowtowing and reached the foot of the mountain, the peacocks swarmed them and pecked them viciously. These people were already sallow and emaciated; how could they withstand such torment? Covered in blood, they fell back into the sea.

At this, several acolytes attending the peacocks watched with great relish and began to laugh.

“Their minds are unstable. They truly deserve it! Kowtowing every step is meant to nurture the Buddhist heart. If they cannot abandon self-respect, self-love, and their own independent thoughts, how can they be called pious? How can they seek emptiness?”

Just as they were laughing, a wild wind swept across the flat ground. These acolytes possessed little cultivation and were instantly swept up by the gale, along with the mortals on the ground. All of them landed upon a multicolored, feathered surface. Before the acolytes even landed, they were laughing in ecstasy.

“We have been chosen by the blessed land!”

“The Seven-Colored-Language Peacock Back! This is one of the highest blessed lands!”

The acolytes quickly settled themselves on the peacock's back and began piously chanting sutras. The dozen or so mortals, sallow and suffering from broken limbs from the fall, saw this and began chanting along, and astonishingly, they no longer felt any pain.

The massive peacock spread its wings and flew east. Splendor flowed in its dark, gem-like eyes. The Eastern Sea was vast, and the peacock was truly bored by the flight. After a while, it snatched up one person and "received" them, eliciting a cheer from those on its back.

The acolytes had the best "flavor" and were being saved for last. Seeing the mortals enter the "blessed land" first, they grew indignant. Suppressing their jealousy, they used every ounce of their strength to chant the sutras.

The peacock flew onward until it reached the Sea's Cape. Its snacks now finished, it transformed into a dignified and benevolent-looking woman clad in a five-colored robe. She dove deep into the seabed, executed an art, tunneled into the earth, and flew into a karst cave, finally arriving before a pool of turquoise water.

She smiled slightly and whispered, “Greetings, Great Daoist Master Buzi!”

The water in the subterranean pool rippled slightly, and a weak voice emerged, sounding ancient and weary:

“Daoist Friend Yuse, my thanks to you this time… Did you bring the Blood-Jadeite Treasure Pearl?”

The Merciful One Yuse smiled and nodded. “You are a great cultivator who has entered the Purple Mansion Realm; you need not be so polite. To be able to help a Great Daoist Master in this dire place is also due to fate. I only hope you recover from your injuries and capture that great demon!”

“I only hope… to see that flower first.”

The green pool rippled, and Chi Buzi's voice emerged: “As it should be.”

At this, the water stirred, and a bright white flower floated up from the pool's surface. The eyes of the Merciful One Yuse lit up, and she smiled. “This truly is a rare Supreme Yin treasure! Worthy of the Supreme Yang Dao… It truly opens the eyes of a minor cultivator like me from the poor countryside.”

She looked at it closely, just as a clear, smiling voice sounded right by her ear:

“Beautiful, isn't it? It should be!”

Yuse's heart seized in shock. She whipped her head around. Behind her, seated on a large rock, was a green-robed cultivator with unbound hair, smiling warmly at her. A deathly chill shot through her heart. “Daoist Master… what is…”

Before she could finish her question, she saw a spray of crystal flying toward her. The hairs on her body stood on end. She formed a hand seal, and layers of colored light flew up to block the crystal, only to find her vision blurring, immersed in a piercing, icy cold.

An icy sensation radiated from beneath her feet, the cold touch of ripples. She was already standing in the green pool.

Chou-Gui Hidden Form!

The Merciful One Yuse was only recently promoted. In a fight, she was no match for Chi Buzi. She immediately formed a seal and spoke with urgency:

“Great Daoist Master! My fate is held in the hands of the Shanjia Maha! Killing me will create binding karma! I urge you to act with caution!”

Yuse never imagined Chi Buzi would attack her. The Shanjia Maha was already in his ninth incarnation. Furthermore, Chi Buzi was not some vengeance-fueled Buddhist. Killing her, Yuse, offered him no benefit whatsoever!

Both Merciful Ones and Mahas were Buddhist cultivators who had attained the "Non-Retrogression Stage," equivalent to the Purple Mansion Realm. The greatest difference between them lay in that stage. A Maha's Non-Retrogression Stage resides on their own Maha "seat"—their position, form, and thoughts never regress. Unless their True Spirit is locked away, they are equivalent to immortal.

But a Merciful One's Non-Retrogression Stage is "hung" beneath a corresponding Maha's seat, the highest being beneath the Golden Lotus Seat—once also called the Lotus Seat or the Great Pu-Sa Dixit Seat. Their form and thoughts do not regress; even if their Dharma Body is shattered in the outside world, they can completely recover upon returning to the Buddhist Pure Land.

A Merciful One of this level already possesses the potential to attain the Maha realm; the conditions are just extremely strict.

The system of the Buddhist cultivators was extremely wondrous; otherwise, how could they have emerged from the ancient chaos of immortals and demons and seized the entire north during the turmoil? There was a reason why the seven paths of Buddhist cultivators and the northern mortals were pathologically obsessed with the Pure Land—it was simply far more convenient and infinitely safer than seeking one's own nature…

Although her, Yuse's, Non-Retrogression Stage was not yet certified under the highest Golden Lotus Seat, she had reached the secondary Developing Wisdom Seat. Her spiritual thoughts would not regress and could retreat to the Pure Land. More importantly, as a descendant of the Peacock, her status in the Way of Compassion was unusual. If she died, the Shanjia Maha himself would personally attend to the matter!

Killing her would only shatter this Dharma Body, offend the Ninth-Incarnation Shanjia Maha, and anger the entire Peacock clan, yielding Chi Buzi absolutely no benefit. Otherwise, why would she, Yuse, dare to recklessly contact Chi Buzi?!

Even as events spiraled far beyond her imagination, Yuse remained calm. She pointed out the stakes while forming seals, watching the green-robed man lounging on the rock. He smiled.

“Little Peacock, I won't kill you! I'm just borrowing you for a while.”

The Pristine Water at her feet rippled. Facing Chi Buzi of the Pristine Water Dao, Yuse had already lost most of her fighting spirit. She still wanted to immediately move and leap out of the green pool. She circulated her magic and stepped forward, only to find that the pool followed her like a shadow, staying directly beneath her feet.

Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow, observing her, and said casually:

“You are a peacock, after all. Yao are inherently inferior to humans. You cultivate as a Merciful One, yet you don't even have a single divine ability and clearly haven't learned any decent Dharma arts. If you had run into someone else, they would have slapped you to death in two hits!”

He appeared to be sitting casually on the rock, but he was toying with a small cauldron that radiated a shimmering green light. A powerful sensation of stagnation filled the carefully arranged cave, so thick that a faint green mist began to rise. He was clearly primed and ready to strike.

A descendant of the Peacock was still a Purple Mansion bloodline. Although not equal to a Dragon or Luan-Phoenix, she was certainly not worse than others. Unfortunately for her, she had met Chi Buzi, the greatest genius of the Chi family in three hundred years. The green pool below and the green mist in the air combined to bind her, preventing her escape into the Great Void. Yuse barely maintained her polite facade:

“I wonder what the Daoist Master requires? You could have simply told this junior. Why must you be so aggressive…”

Yuse's *thoughts* were non-regressing, not all three aspects. This Dharma Body and her Merciful One status were extremely precious to her. Knowing he couldn't, and had no motive to, kill her, she was ultimately reluctant to fight back.

Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow, glanced at her, and smiled.

“I have been cultivating a specific Dharma art these past few years. It requires peacock blood, peacock feet, and peacock feathers. I came this time, Daoist Friend, to borrow your Dharma Body.”

Yuse immediately relaxed. After all, these things, no matter what, were nothing compared to her entire Dharma Body. But if she weren't trapped here, she naturally would be unwilling to give them. The request now felt reasonable. She lowered her voice: “My…”

*Rumble…*

Before she could finish speaking, the small cauldron in Chi Buzi's hand had already appeared above her head. The intense, dense power of Pristine Water pressed down. In the single instant that Yuse hesitated, the green pool beneath her feet erupted with complex, glowing array patterns.

A sudden, deadly chill seized Yuse's heart. But Chi Buzi had been accumulating power in that cauldron for who knows how long. As it descended, it suppressed her, scattering her dharma power and rendering her completely immobile.

Chi Buzi remained seated on the rock, unmoving, his eyes filled with mockery.

'Fell for it once and it wasn't enough, she had to fall for it again. Truly stupid. The Pure Land only raises these kinds of idiots…'

Even though Chi Buzi was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Yuse was not someone he could kill with a mere flip of his hand. In this short time, he could only stun her, force her back to her original form, and trap her above the green pool.

Yuse was suddenly horrified. This was her moment of weakness, unable to move. If he sacrificed any Dharma Artifact now, he could easily wound her. Her mind was still reeling:

'At the absolute worst, he just covets my entire Dharma Body… Could he possibly pull out a Dharma Treasure and actually kill me?'

In that fleeting instant of thought, the grand array beneath her feet flared with a blinding white light. Yuse's figure abruptly faded. A dignified Merciful One from the Developing Wisdom Seat vanished just like that, leaving only the flow of colored light in the empty cave.

Chi Buzi's eyes darkened. He felt the slow, creeping sensation of weightlessness and understood.

'It can 'receive' Yuse even like this... and it clearly wasn't *Him* who acted. There are multiple True Monarchs in the 'Heavens Above'…'

'Dharma Artifacts have no effect. I wasn't even inside the array, yet I can still be pulled into that Grotto-Heaven... I fear I couldn't hide even if I fled to the ends of the earth. The 'Heavens Above' is not only much higher than the Buddhist Pure Land of Compassion, but it's fundamentally not in the Great Void. It is... beyond Heaven…'

'Peacocks really are stupid and dull... If I loop around, I might be able to trap one here again. Ugh, but that means I have to see that chatty moron of a donkey again…'

# Chapter 800: Seeking the Dao

The long steps were translucent, and white mist churned. From a small pavilion at the edge of the heavens, the faint, clear chime of music drifted over. Inside, a row of emerald chimes sat by the inner hall. Two celestial attendants were playing, their long robes trailing the ground, hidden within the white vapors.

At the front was a long table where a woman in tea-white iridescent robes rested her chin on one hand, writing with a brush held in the other. She possessed an air of clear, otherworldly detachment. A pipa lay beside the table, faintly reflecting the light.

Shaohui had stood guard at the edge of the heavens for many years. Immortal traces rarely reached this place. Even the celestial attendants in the pavilions were spirits dispatched by the Palace of the Supreme Yin. They could not speak and were only capable of simple tasks; once they memorized a rhythm, they could strike the chimes.

She was responsible for eight courtyards and pavilions. The surrounding four courtyards housed minor functionaries and attendants, while the immortal officials from three of the four immortal pavilions had been assigned elsewhere. On normal days, none of them bothered her.

Shaohui was happy for the leisure. She had the patience for quiet cultivation. Furthermore, the immortal officials in these courtyards and pavilions were not her direct subordinates; this was, after all, someone else's territory. Zhengao had found her this quiet post, so she naturally avoided interfering. Only the official from the one remaining immortal pavilion occasionally visited her, and he was dreadfully talkative.

The brush in her hand paused. This manual on Lesser Yin arts was seventy percent complete. Setting the brush down, she looked toward an attendant maiden who entered and bowed in the center, reporting respectfully:

"Reporting to Your Excellency, Dangjiang has arrived."

Shaohui frowned slightly, looking rather helpless. Counting the days, it had been exactly thirty. The man had timed his arrival perfectly. She had no choice but to nod.

"Let him up."

The maiden attendant withdrew. Soon, a person strode in from outside the pavilion. He had the appearance of a youth, with a broad forehead and thick, flourishing hair and beard. He shook out his wave-patterned sleeves and bowed.

"Collating Immortal Official of the Profound Seven Pavilion, Dangjiang, pays respects to the Lord of Lesser Yin Wu-Gui."

"You're here again."

A stark white circular marking dotted Shaohui's brow. She looked over, her eyes weary.

"You. Instead of properly collating scriptures and correcting errors in the east, why do you keep coming here? What is it this time?"

Dangjiang had long since figured out Shaohui's temperament. Though her words were sharp, it was just complaining; she had no real intention of punishing him. Aside from her aversion to conversation, she was an excellent superior. He was currently riding a wave of success and replied:

"If only I were *actually* collating. Your Excellency knows I can't keep my mouth shut. I'm only checking the texts, not comparing them against copies. I'm constantly worried I'll make a mistake in the cultivation methods..."

Collation required two people comparing texts; Dangjiang was just looking for company. Shaohui knew he would just complain about being bored, so she cut him off rather than letting him ramble.

"Get to the point."

Only then did Dangjiang retrieve a token from his sleeve. It was the length of a forearm, pure white, and inscribed with the silver-white sigil of the Supreme Yin, which was currently glowing. He presented it with both hands. "I am here on official business. I must ask Your Excellency to escort me!"

Shaohui raised an eyebrow. She finally stood up, gathered the pipa from the table into her arms, and gracefully drifted down. "After all this time," she commented idly, "you finally have some real work to do."

"Hehe."

Dangjiang chuckled, then hesitated before speaking again.

"That subordinate of mine in the mortal realm... although he's nowhere near my level, he does have some skill. He contacted me at the turn of the year and said he could capture a peacock this time! And it's no ordinary peacock. I hear it cultivates the arts of the Northern Buddhist Lands... I wonder how much merit this one is worth, compared to the last demon..."

A tea-white cloud rose beneath Shaohui's feet, lifting him up as well. As they flew south together, she replied softly:

"That subordinate of yours... is he called Chi Buzi? The last demon he caught, how much merit did the palace record for it?"

Dangjiang quickly replied, "Three hundred immortal merits."

"Oh?"

Shaohui nodded lightly. "Then this peacock might be worth around three hundred and fifty immortal merits."

Dangjiang quickly looked up. He had been enjoying his days, but he hadn't forgotten his promise to Chi Buzi to seek out a path to the Golden Core. He had been holding it in, waiting to ask Immortal Official Liu.

But Immortal Official Liu had left and never returned, leaving his supposed connection useless. With the fire burning his eyebrows, Dangjiang could only turn to Shaohui. He hesitated, "My subordinate cultivates the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. He cultivates his own nature and has already passed the 'Comprehending Purple' stage. He only lacks the final Dao lineage. However, the mortal realm's Fruition Attainment for Pristine Water is already occupied..."

Shaohui reacted quickly, immediately making some deductions. "Occupied is occupied... but I fear the one holding that Fruition Attainment is unwilling to let him achieve the Dao. That makes things difficult. Why not seek the Metallic Essence first? What is the status of that Pristine Water cultivator?"

Dangjiang shook his head. "His condition is poor. He is currently engaged in combat outside the heavens and has no time to spare. This is exactly why I am anxious. Whether it's proving the final Dao of 'Purging Dew,' receiving the Supreme Yin's guidance, or abandoning this path entirely, a decision must be made now. If we wait for that True Monarch to return, there won't be many options left."

"I see."

Shaohui was quite interested. Although her previous incarnation had been an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm demon, condensed from a wisp of Lesser Yin, and her memories retained the influence of many immortal arts, solving this matter was still problematic.

"Since he's your subordinate, why not ask Zhengao? Although Pristine Water is in the mortal realm, there might be an Immortal General of this Dao in the heavens. You could inquire."

"I wanted to!"

Dangjiang couldn't travel far. He wouldn't see another soul for ten days or half a month. He couldn't even find anyone to swap the two male attendants in his courtyard for female attendants, much less inquire about something so important.

'That dog Chi... your cultivation path is truly a dead end.'

Shaohui clearly understood. She paused, then replied, "Just request an audience with Zhengao and ask him properly. Although it will cost quite a bit... Zhengao appears cold but is kind-hearted, and his cultivation is profound. He won't make things difficult for you."

"But... this lowly one has humble words and little influence... What path do I take to find the Lord..."

At Dangjiang's question, Shaohui nodded. "I also need to make a trip to the Supreme Yin Palace this time. Since you asked, you can just accompany me then."

Having secured a path, Dangjiang was overjoyed. Offering profuse thanks, he stood waiting atop the clouds. The vast, magnificent hall appeared once more, twelve white jade bridges arching across the sky, spanning a golden lake.

This time, Shaohui also descended from the clouds, and they proceeded deeper into the hall, eventually arriving outside that same courtyard. From a distance, Dangjiang saw the two attendant maidens still standing outside. The one who previously held the white-rimmed jade pipa now held a Pure Cloud Jade Vase, while the other still carried a flower basket. When they saw him looking, they even returned a polite courtesy.

'...'

He strode to the front of the courtyard, keeping his eyes fixed forward. Behind him, Shaohui stopped. Dangjiang scanned them with his peripheral vision. This time, the attendant's basket was filled with glistening little fruits, the kind of goods that looked like they could bankrupt a person.

Terrified that Shaohui would remember he still owed her a [Moon Laurel Golden Branch], Dangjiang practically fled into the courtyard. The four lamp stands within the yard were blazing brightly, and the central round pool had already turned a shimmering white. He quickly formed a hand seal and activated the token.

"Activate!"

The figure of a man in green robes materialized above the pool. Dangjiang was still somewhat distracted. Chi Buzi stepped out of the pool, glanced around, and noticed the idiot spacing out by the poolside. He frowned.

"What are you losing your mind about?"

Dangjiang laughed in exasperation and shook his head. "That 'souvenir' you suddenly demanded last time. You *will* compensate me for it!"

Dangjiang had suffered a huge loss that time and still held a grudge. He had mentioned it to him two years prior, but Chi Buzi had merely treated it as a joke. Hearing it again now, he laughed and replied:

"Serves you right."

He hadn't come here to argue with Dangjiang. Before the other man could erupt, he immediately frowned.

"I caught that peacock for you. Do you have any news on your end?"

Dangjiang raised an eyebrow. He noticed that Chi Buzi was not only completely unscathed but also radiating a powerful aura. It seemed he hadn't even expended much dharma power this time. Dangjiang was secretly impressed but remained stubborn with his words.

"Just based on the few things you've caught so far... your efficiency is pathetic. These one or two demons are just minor figures in the Purple Mansion Realm. Why don't you take a piss and look at your own reflection? Yet you have the nerve to rush me for news?"

Chi Buzi sneered. "Give me a break. With you trying to get something for nothing, the fact that I'm willing to catch *anything* for you means I'm giving you face. Do you have news or not? What 'connection'? Don't tell me you were just bluffing."

This remark set Dangjiang off. He cursed, "You ungrateful wretch! Do you have any idea how I've schemed and managed my relationships these past few years? I haven't slept properly for nights! Do you know how much I've spent out of my own pocket... just to get you this chance to meet an Immortal General? And this is the thanks I get..."

Hearing this, Chi Buzi raised his eyebrows slightly, surprised.

"Meet an Immortal General?"

Chi Buzi didn't believe for a second that this idiot was capable of any grand "scheming." When they corresponded two years ago, the man had been vague, clearly lacking any confidence. He probably hadn't made any progress at all. His claims of maneuvering now likely meant he'd just stumbled into some dumb luck and gotten it done.

'As long as it got done... it's a good thing. I'll meet this Immortal General first and see... Still, I should probably praise the idiot.'

Chi Buzi affected an expression of amazement, offering a few words of thanks that sounded like he was conceding against his will. As expected, Dangjiang burst out laughing, looking incredibly smug. After chatting for a moment, the man seemed to remember something and said grudgingly:

"Did you ever find Immortal Official Li?"

Dangjiang had tasked him with this some time ago. But unlike the Golden Core lineage, this matter had no definite leads. Chi Buzi was also far cleverer than Dangjiang and just smiled.

"So what if I found him? So what if I didn't? Am I supposed to explain the matter of reincarnation to him? If that messes up the arrangements of those Above, who gets punished? You or me?"

This shut Dangjiang up completely. He truly didn't want to keep toiling like an ox and a horse every day. He sighed for a long time before replying, "In any case... just look for him. If he has his memories, just ask around for me."

To Chi Buzi, this was utter nonsense, but he firmly committed this information to memory.

What family was the reason he, Chi Buzi, first came into contact with [The Heavens] and Dangjiang? The Li Family of Moongaze! And what was Moongaze Lake? It was the foothold of the Moonlight Origin Mansion back then...

Everything about [The Heavens] was related to the Supreme Yin. Although it bore no resemblance to the Moonlight Origin Mansion's [Donghua Heaven] mentioned in the records, there was no way the two weren't connected!

If this "Immortal Official Li" had been ordered to reincarnate under his original surname, Chi Buzi's first reaction was that it had to be Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun!

Daoist Master Donghua just fit too well... possessing transcendent Dharma Art techniques, astonishing sword intent and cultivation, *and* operating under the name of the Moonlight Origin Mansion. How deep did these waters run? Although the Chi family had experienced it firsthand, Chi Buzi hadn't received the details due to the prohibition on recording Golden Core matters. But he wasn't stupid enough to go probing into the reasons!

He brushed the other man off with a single sentence. Dangjiang, meanwhile, lifted his chin, speaking proudly.

"First, I'll take you to meet my current superior, the fairy who holds the position of Lesser Yin Wu-Gui. Try to suppress that stench of mortal dust on you. Don't pollute her immortal aura."

Chi Buzi was eager to meet more people. He followed Dangjiang to the front of the courtyard. Dangjiang took the token from his sleeve and placed it in Chi Buzi's hand.

"You don't have immortal registry, so you must hold this token. There are many important figures on the path. Don't look around carelessly."

This surprised Chi Buzi. Logically, since Yingze hadn't appeared in so many years—even ignoring the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven of the Green Pine Temple —there should be *fewer* great cultivators here. Otherwise, they wouldn't have dispatched an idiot like Dangjiang to receive him.

He hesitated briefly but ultimately followed him out of the courtyard. Sure enough, the woman in the tea-white iridescent robes was waiting outside, holding her pipa, the stark white circular marking on her brow. She was looking right at them.

"Greetings, Lord of Lesser Yin Wu-Gui!"

Chi Buzi bowed, immediately assessing her.

'A great cultivator of Lesser Yin. She also possesses a Divine Ability... she must be at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm...'

Before him, however, Shaohui froze, a doubt rising in her mind.

'How strange... why do I find him more and more disagreeable the longer I look at him? His appearance isn't that repulsive...'

She showed no sign of this outwardly. With a single glance, she turned and walked away. Dangjiang hurried to follow. Chi Buzi walked at the very back. Although two rows of celestial soldiers lined the path, solemn and imposing, the man in green didn't spare them a second glance, focusing instead on the other cultivators.

'No matter how solemn or imposing the guards are, they could just be puppets, or some kind of divine ability...'

As he walked, many cultivators paused to watch them. A few with higher status even greeted Shaohui. Chi Buzi swept them with a faint gaze, thinking:

'The idiot is just puffing himself up to look important... not a single person acknowledged him...'

The group arrived at a high platform, pristine jade-green and bright, inscribed with bright moon patterns. Frosty snow drifted down, encircled by spiritual water. They waited on the platform for a moment before a handsome Immortal General in silver armor zipped over. Shaohui smiled.

"Daoist Friend Zhengao!"

Zhengao looked over and nodded in reply.

"Shaohui, you've come."

The two exchanged brief pleasantries. Shaohui was clearly not one for fawning, so she quickly changed the subject.

"Daoist Friend, you placed Dangjiang in my hands back then. I have a few small matters to consult you about. Firstly, to fulfill my duty as his superior, and secondly, it concerns the affairs of the Supreme Yin..."

Zhengao nodded with a smile, his gaze sweeping lightly over the two of them. He listened as Shaohui finished explaining. The celestial attendant of the Lesser Yin Wu-Gui position then shook out her tea-white robes and cupped her hands.

"I ask the Immortal General to handle the matter. It is not appropriate for Shaohui to remain here."

She retreated gracefully. Dangjiang waited below. Although he had met Zhengao before, those had been private meetings, nothing like the solemn dignity of today. He felt a secret fear growing in his heart.

Chi Buzi, standing to the side, was much calmer. However, the status associated with this place had repeatedly shattered his expectations, and now his own Golden Core Dao path was involved. He couldn't help but feel a flicker of anxiety. Watching Dangjiang standing frozen in front like a turtle pulling its head into its shell, he felt a massive headache coming on.

'That idiot...'



# Chapter 801: The Intercalation of Valley Water

Chi Buzi waited several breaths before the anxious Dangjiang finally stepped forward and bowed.

"Reporting to the Immortal General... this man was personally selected by the Honoured Lord back then and permitted to ascend to the heavens to seek the Dao. Now... he has accrued some initial immortal merit and has come specifically to pay his respects. He hopes only for a word or two of guidance from the Immortal General, that he might have some hope of reaching the Golden Core."

Dangjiang knelt obediently, tugging Chi Buzi’s sleeve with both hands, signaling him to present the token. Although Chi Buzi was a distinguished Great Cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm, he knelt just as readily, his expression impeccably natural and respectful.

"This lowly cultivator has successively offered two Demons for sacrifice in exchange for immortal merit, seeking capital for the Dao," Chi Buzi said. "It is all recorded within this token. I only request the adult's guidance."

Immediately, an Immortal Soldier descended from the platform, accepted the token from Chi Buzi, and carried it straight to Lu Jiangxian, who was disguised as Zhengao.

"My lord," the soldier reported, "the token contains six hundred and forty-one merits."

Zhengao gave a slight nod, glanced at the two, and replied, "Go seek an intercalary position."

Dangjiang no longer understood the conversation. Chi Buzi, too, hesitated. His Azure Pond Sect Pristine Water lineage was formidable, enough to overwhelm most cultivators, but it was precisely because his Dao originated from Pristine Water that his understanding of the Golden Core was surprisingly lacking. Though he had spent years gathering every scrap of information he could find, he was a sharp man. How could he waste an opportunity like this?

He immediately bowed again.

"Milord... this lowly cultivator's lineage is crude, and my cultivation shallow. I am completely in the dark regarding matters of the Golden Core... Only in Anhuai Heaven did I receive the Immortal Lord's pity, granting me this aspiration. The lord's words are too profound; I implore you to elaborate..."

Hearing this, Lu Jiangxian laughed internally.

'He's actually using my name for backing!'

Having read countless volumes and possessing immortal arts as his framework, Lu Jiangxian was far more knowledgeable about the Golden Core than Chi Buzi, whether in practice or theory. He felt quite confident.

This knowledge was a profound secret that could not be transmitted lightly. Chi Buzi was the type who wouldn't act without seeing a reward, but Lu Jiangxian intended to continue using him, so he wasn't stingy.

"Given your current situation," Zhengao said softly, "you cannot attain Fruition Attainment unless that True Monarch Lushui is eliminated. You already know this... Yet, you are a descendant of his lineage, and he is watching you closely. He doesn't even want you to secure a auxiliary position. If you try to confront him directly on the Dao of Pristine Water, you are committing suicide. Only an intercalary position remains viable."

Chi Buzi's breathing suddenly grew heavy. "This lowly cultivator boldly asks... which intercalary position must I attest?" he whispered.

Auxiliary positions and intercalary positions were ethereal concepts to ordinary cultivators. Even the core disciples of the Purple Mansion Realm merely knew the terms existed. Among the mighty Three Sects and Seven Gates, with their complete Golden Core lineages, not one possessed a cultivation method or scripture that clearly defined how to seek a auxiliary or intercalary position.

No matter what secrets he had witnessed previously, Chi Buzi always grasped the crux of the problem. The answer to this question carried the weight of a mountain; its value to the entire world was almost unimaginable.

Yet Zhengao replied as if it were a simple matter, shaking his head. "That depends on your Divine Abilities. Pristine Water and Valley Water have an intercalation. Of the five Divine Abilities, Spring's Echo, Heavy Murk, and Chou-Gui Hidden Form are all intercalations of Valley Water. But you... you just had to go and cultivate Clear Dusk Rain. That makes things troublesome."

Chi Buzi’s mind raced, his expression shifting several times as the implications of that measured sentence washed over him.

'Pristine Water and Valley Water have an intercalation.'

What did this mean? It meant that he, Chi Buzi, could use this to seek the intercalary position of Valley Water!

His composure, which wouldn't crack even if Mount Tai collapsed before him, finally shattered. His eyes revealed a mixture of stunned realization, doubt, and sudden, blinding clarity.

Based on his own cultivation and the ancient texts he’d collected, Chi Buzi had long harbored suspicions about Valley Water and Water Mansion. He had once gambled by speculating that Yingze was the Water Mansion True Monarch, solely as a show of loyalty.

And now, learning that these Divine Abilities were called "Valley Water intercalations," the fog in his mind mostly dispersed. But just knowing that Pristine Water and Valley Water had an intercalation wasn't the solution. The critical questions remained: which immortal foundation must he use as a supplement? And what method must he find to seek the Golden Core?

Countless thoughts erupted in his mind, but he relied on his profound cultivation to restrain his excitement.

"In the past, the seniors of my lineage only sought the auxiliary position of Pristine Water, never daring to dream of an intercalary one. By my generation, we understood the True Monarch's intent and had considered seeking an intercalary path... but I never imagined that Clear Dusk Rain had ruined the entire endeavor..."

Zhen'gao had already picked up a jade slip and begun reading it idly.

"If you hadn't cultivated Clear Dusk Rain," he replied, "this Valley Water Dao would have offered a wondrous affinity. But you did. Clear Dusk Rain is the 'evening rain,' the orthodox fruition of Pristine Water. As such, it conflicts with Valley Water."

Chi Buzi finally understood. His clan had possessed Heavy Murk and Spring's Echo. Only Clear Dusk Rain had come from the Azure Pond Sect's inventory. His suspicious nature immediately flared, placing all the blame on True Monarch Lushui.

"Now..." Chi Buzi pleaded, "I beg the lord to illuminate the path forward!"

Zhengao stroked the token in his hand, and its radiant light immediately dimmed. Dangjiang watched this, his heart aching at the cost, but Chi Buzi paid it no mind, waiting below with utmost reverence.

"Within the Water Mansion path," Zhen'gao said, "there is one called Morning Cold Rain. Are you aware of it?"

Of course Chi Buzi knew. He answered instantly,

"This lowly cultivator has heard of it. The Water Mansion's Morning Cold Rain is often seen in the Eastern Sea. Many descendants of Pristine Water Demons follow this Dao..."

"If you are to attest another Divine Ability," Zhen'gao said softly, "you should cultivate this one."

Chi Buzi froze, deep unease filling him.

After all, if a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator attested the wrong Divine Ability, their progress would be halted permanently. Cultivators in Jiangnan only dared to supplement their path with an outside Dao for their absolute final Divine Ability, and even then, only after meticulous, agonizing calculations to ensure the abilities wouldn't conflict. It was no simple matter.

Furthermore, telling a Pristine Water cultivator to use a Water Mansion Divine Ability to attest a Valley Water intercalary position was utter madness. If he had heard this idea yesterday, Chi Buzi would have slapped the speaker into oblivion. He couldn't fathom it.

Zhengao raised an eyebrow.

"Morning Cold Rain is 'falling snow meeting the morning light, transforming into chilling rain.' The rain is held within the snow; the snow is the rain's creek valley. Within the Water Mansion path, *this* is the Valley Water intercalation. The good news is that it can connect upward to those three Valley Water intercalations, and downward to your Clear Dusk Rain. While not as ideal as cultivating the other two Valley Water paths directly... it counts as a road."

The more Chi Buzi listened, the more sense it made. He nodded quickly, a seed of trust taking root.

No matter what, this method still involved four Pristine Water abilities; it remained within the bounds of worldly convention. Even if he failed to breach the Golden Core, his life would at least be preserved. In contrast, Chi Buzi now felt that the alternative—*not* cultivating Clear Dusk Rain, and instead cultivating three Pristine Water abilities followed by two Valley Water abilities—sounded like the real joke.

'The seniors and classics had long made it clear: cultivating even a single Divine Ability outside one's foundational path meant cultivation would halt permanently. Two? Even if you *could* cultivate them, how many days could you survive before your body exploded?'

He weighed the two roads. He would still choose the four-Pristine Water, one-Water Mansion path. In fact, he was suddenly grateful he had already cultivated Clear Dusk Rain; otherwise, he would have had difficulty refusing the other, suicidal suggestion.

"This Morning Cold Rain..."

Chi Buzi wasn't without the Water Mansion cultivation art, but he was completely ignorant regarding these divine intercalary mysteries. Naturally, he had to ask for the sake of security. His tone was hopeful and earnest, desperate for the general to simply hand him a specialized cultivation method.

Lu Jiangxian had been waiting for this exact question. The carrot was dangling, and Chi Buzi would naturally take the bait. Controlling Zhengao, he chuckled.

"That's easy. Morning Cold Rain is, after all, a Water Mansion method. It's best to modify it to better fit your Dao path. If you have sufficient immortal merit, you can go to the Manor and request a copy. The subsequent Gold-seeking method will be the same. Neither is difficult."

Chi Buzi's heart hammered his ribs. Lu Jiangxian knew how capable this man was and felt a flicker of worry; after all, even he needed time to compose the cultivation method. He feared Chi Buzi might pull off a massive sacrifice—perhaps an entire mountain of Merciful Ones—and demand the method when he couldn't produce it. Faking a Gold-seeking method was beyond his current abilities.

He quickly added a warning: "But I must remind you. My colleagues in the Manor are not as easy-going as I am. They look very unfavorably upon the Purple-Gold demonic path. Stay away from that area. If you need to make a request, have Dangjiang do it for you. The cost will not be low... Work hard."

The excuse was perfectly logical. It even resolved some of Chi Buzi's lingering doubts, lessening his suspicions. He and Dangjiang bowed respectfully and exited the platform. The green-robed man looked utterly refreshed, his spirit soaring.

Dangjiang, however, glanced mournfully at the token in Chi Buzi's hand. Six hundred and forty-one immortal merits were now reduced to a meager forty-one. Chi Buzi didn't care in the slightest.

'What a joke,' he thought. 'The lives of just two Demons? The single sentence, "Pristine Water and Valley Water have an intercalation," is worth the lives of how many Purple Mansion cultivators in my entire lineage?'

Shaohui was waiting outside, holding her pipa. She had always disliked Chi Buzi, but she was an expert at enduring and said nothing, escorting them out. When they reached the courtyard, both men breathed a sigh of relief.

This time, Dangjiang was wary of him, and Chi Buzi mentioned no gifts. He spoke with grave seriousness.

"I am returning this time to slowly accumulate immortal merit. Doing this too often attracts suspicion. The path ahead is one of constant peril, where body and spirit could be annihilated at any moment; it is like treading on thin ice. If I fall, your path of advancement vanishes, too."

"You are safe in the heavens. Please, ask about this cultivation method for me, and what its price is. If you have the chance, gather spirit pills and potent medicines—any aid from the mighty you can find. In doing so, you will also be helping yourself."

"Like I need you to tell me?" Dangjiang spat at him.

Chi Buzi nearly cursed him—*stupid mule*—but restrained himself and vanished from the round pool.

Dangjiang was left staring enviously at the spot, but as he took a step, something suddenly felt wrong.

'Damn it... That Chi dog earns three hundred merits per demon, and I... I'm not even making his spare change! How am I not getting a commission? When a subordinate does the dirty work, shouldn't you skim at least sixty or seventy percent? Otherwise, what’s the point!'

***

Within The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity.

As great snowflakes danced outside, Lu Jiangxian’s form slowly materialized by the table. In the center sat a jade pot, filled to the brim with the dazzling, ocean-like Divine Ability that still pulsed like a captured galaxy.

'Chi Buzi basically believes it... At least this will allow him to cultivate to Peak Purple Mansion. He still has two hundred years. He counts as a hidden card.'

Lu Jiangxian hadn't completely deceived him. According to his own calculations, provided the Gold-seeking method was a match, this path—though bizarre and incredibly difficult—was indeed a viable minor road straight to the Golden Core.

"This Morning Cold Rain cultivation method won't be hard to write. Li Ximing was able to break through relying on Talisman Qi, which proves that Talisman Qi is inextricably linked to Divine Abilities. It possesses the power to sense and nurture them. I only need to write the method up to the Foundation Establishment Realm. That makes it much, much simpler."

Lu Jiangxian had gray talismans in spades, and seven white talismans in his inventory. Although the sacrificial method wasn't recorded, the efficacy of the two talisman grades must differ.

"Chi Buzi is highly capable. When the time comes, I'll reward him with one gray talisman and let him grind out the breakthrough himself. The white talismans I'll save for that fellow Li Ximing. It will speed up the cultivation of his Sovereign's Perilous Tread, so he doesn't keep getting beaten and forced to flee."

He simulated the process using a few created human bodies. As he suspected, once the Purple Mansion Realm was achieved, Talisman Qi could indeed sense the previous Divine Ability and assist in nurturing the next.

"Li Ximing's Audience with the Celestial Gate is not yet at perfection. It will be some time before he's useful."

Dismissing the thought, he checked on Chi Buzi's status—all was normal. Only then did he wave his sleeve. A small, exquisite, seven-colored peacock with a golden beak and golden talons materialized on the floor.

The peacock's true form should have been the size of a mountain, but upon entering the Immortal Mirror's domain, it had been suppressed to this tiny form. Lu Jiangxian scanned it and made his assessment.

'It's far inferior to Fuyu. There are flaws in both its body and soul. Although the Mirror forcibly collected its true spirit, it ultimately possesses no Divine Abilities. It's mediocre fodder. Using it will be boring.'

These Merciful Ones had their heads stuffed with nothing but those sutras, and the Dharma Arts they learned were useless outside their Buddhist lands. Only the base instincts of a peacock remained. Even if he nurtured it, it was just an empty-headed mediocrity.

He had intended to take a soul to pair with Fuyu's Lesser Yin Divine Ability to refine Talisman Qi, but this Merciful One had only cultivation, no innate abilities. Lesser Yin, at least, had other uses. In the end, he decided to simply use the entire peacock.

"Come!"

The entire celestial palace instantly froze. Every Immortal Soldier and General solidified like a statue. The massive ocean of golden incense fire suppressed beneath the vast palace erupted, surging across the heavens, all of it flooding toward the seven-colored glass orb in his palm.

The golden lake that Dangjiang and the others had seen beneath the twelve white jade bridges was merely one small corner. The incense fire from millions of mortals, accumulated year after year, had condensed into a massive lake beneath the palace, and it was now draining at terrifying speed.

Previously, when Lu Jiangxian condensed Talisman Qi, he had never experienced consumption like this, nor had he ever considered if his incense fire reserves were sufficient. Now, the cost for a single azure talisman leaped from a measure of ten thousand to one of millions. Only his accumulated reserves from the last fifty years supported the expenditure. The golden lake's surface dropped lower and lower, but ultimately, it held.

A single point of green light emerged before him. Countless profound patterns, resembling a spider's web, spread through the air. The sounds of immortal bells and ethereal strings played from the void. The nascent Talisman Qi bobbed and swayed, seemingly observing its surroundings with curiosity.

Lu Jiangxian casually caught it, pressing it into his palm. All celestial phenomena vanished. The golden lake below rippled, only half of its volume remaining.

"All preparations are complete. As soon as the Li family's ritual passes, I can bestow this using the Talisman Seed."



# Chapter 802: Nine Mounds

Pale light bloomed again in the pitch-dark cavern. On the ground, the green pool rippled. The young man opened his eyes once more, the world shifting from a blur into sharp focus.

*Drip.*

Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow, standing motionlessly. His eyes still held a thick, lingering expression of disbelief and joy. As if waking from a dream, he scanned his surroundings before standing still, sleeves clasped.

"Valley Water Intercalary Position..."

He stood dumbfounded for a long time, still feeling that the answers he received from the Immortal General were worth far more than two Purple Mansion beasts... The first sentence was, "Pristine Water and Valley Water have an intercalary," and the next was, "Cultivate 'Morning Cold Rain' to seek the Valley Water intercalary position." What kind of treatment was this?

'Even the great families like the Wang and the Xie... or the Luoxia and Dragon-kin... do they receive such treatment? If their descendants hit a bottleneck in cultivation and personally went to pay respects to a True Monarch, would they receive this level of guidance?!'

'Four Pristine and one Mansion seeking Valley Water? What an utterly astonishing concept! Yet, coming from that Immortal General Zhengao, it sounded as simple as post-tea chatter... What level of Dao insight is this? What kind of Dao lineage! If you swapped in another True Monarch, could they possibly reach such a conclusion in an instant?'

Chi Buzi’s expression flickered.

"Impossible... Even the True Monarchs of the current age, who have cultivated for so many years longer than that... one of them only managed to nurture a single Jade True Monarch. While it’s true that my heart for seeking the Dao is resolute, an ordinary Golden Core cultivator surely lacks such miraculous means to turn decay into magic..."

The gap was simply too immense. For a moment, Chi Buzi even began to suspect what kind of place the world beyond the sky truly was. He didn't know if other realms existed, but if this was all real, such a terrifying Immortal Palace could likely command this realm as if it were child's play.

Chi Buzi was naturally suspicious and didn't dwell long on such extravagant fantasies. Instead, he sought the most reliable guess, musing inwardly:

"This level of Dao lineage insight... it must be a heritage from the Middle Antiquity period, at the very least..."

He sorted through his thoughts, gradually grasping the key point as his eyes narrowed.

'It’s likely he was taught to say it. A Golden Core cultivator whose lineage is close to the Valley and Pristine Waters might not be incapable of thinking of this method. But this affair isn't just about *thinking* of it. One must be able to produce a true Gold-seeking method for it to be reality.'

'And this Gold-seeking method is anything but simple. Forget all the ancient orthodox techniques, whether they seek Gold through the Five Elements or through Void and Reality—they are all useless here. This must be a method tailor-made specifically for me. Moreover, for such a fantastical, practically impossible Gold-seeking method, the difficulty of creating it is even greater than proving the Dao myself...'

It was the series of statements from the Zhengao that had given him sufficient confidence to believe it. He suppressed the surging joy and anxiety in his heart, returning to his usual calm.

'I still haven't received the Gold-seeking method, so some doubt remains. I'll continue hunting beasts for now. Since I have nothing I can cultivate at the moment, it's the perfect time to hunt these creatures... I must first get that cultivation art and see it for myself...'

His mood lifted considerably. He rode the wind and burst forth from the sea. He felt the world open up and the sea breeze refresh him. Lifting his gaze, he saw the stars shining brightly in the sky.

"One must always plan ahead. I need to make a trip to the World Navel, visit the various Dao lineages, leave a good impression on that Lady, and read more of the Valley Water Daoist scriptures."

***

The Sea Cape.

The island baked under a scorching sun. The air over the sea held not a trace of moisture, carrying instead an oppressive, stuffy heat. The sky was a spotless, cloudless blue, baking the island's crops until they withered.

A man sat on a large boulder by the sea. He wore white-gold Daoist robes, and a celestial light flashed between his brows as he gazed quietly into the sky.

Li Ximing had returned from hunting beasts and refined the Essence Gathering Pill. He had sent Xia Shouyu into seclusion while he did the same here at the Sea Cape. In three years, he had consumed two Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pills and cultivated diligently, successfully suppressing all the flames within his Great Juque Court.

Now, his injuries were ninety percent healed. The remaining damage was merely superficial harm to his Dharma Body from the battle's flames. He just needed to find some time to patch it up, and returning to his peak state would be effortless.

Of the seven Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pills, exactly one remained. Li Ximing tucked it away safely for emergencies.

'If I weren't an alchemist myself, I'd still be trapped in that cursed place, laying low. I might have even had to face that treacherous old bastard again in the future. This last pill is a perfect reserve. If I'm truly struck by that technique again, this can still save the day.'

With his injuries mostly treated and Xia Shouyu successfully breaking through to Foundation Establishment, Li Ximing planned to leave the Sea Cape and head for the Peacock Sea.

'The "Blazing Fire" Immortal Foundation is forged. Rain clouds scatter, and cold turns to heat. It truly is just as the books described.'

Li Ximing's insight was no longer shallow. Since the 'White Li Heart' was 'Blazing Fire' and also utilized 'Li,' it was almost certainly inseparable from the Luan Sparrow. Luan Sparrows command fire and revere 'Blazing Fire' as supreme. The 'White Li Heart' technique should not be weak.

His timing was precise. He waited only two breaths before a bright light shot up from the temple on the island. Reddish flames soared into the sky, accompanied by the faint, bright, and pleasant cry of a bird.

The chirping drew closer as the white-and-red flames sped toward him, resolving into the form of a beautiful woman. Her face was faintly flushed, her eyebrows thin and high. Bearing a smile, she respectfully knelt before him.

"Shouyu greets the Daoist Master! I was fortunate to not fail my mission. I have now forged my Dao Foundation and have not wasted the Daoist Master's precious pill..."

Li Ximing smiled and nodded, extending a hand to lift her up.

"It was not entirely the pill's doing," he said. "To cultivate in this desolate land and reach Qi Refining so early already proves you are a rare genius. Your ability to meet me is also a sign of your deep fortune."

Xia Shouyu nodded repeatedly as Li Ximing continued, "Let's go look around the temple. Once you have your affairs in order, we will set off."

These words sent a thrill of excitement through Xia Shouyu. She immediately bowed deeply and replied, "Your Excellency's grace... this lowly one will carve it into my heart and never forget!"

She knew full well that the Sea Cape was separated from the Peacock Sea, at the very edge of the Eastern Sea, by countless stretches of mortal ocean. Even though she was now at Foundation Establishment, she had no idea how many years or months it would take her to fly across it herself. Worse, once she reached the coast, the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain might ignore her, but the peacocks certainly wouldn't spare her.

Staying at the Sea Cape meant she could be a local tyrant, but her cultivation would stagnate until she died. The distance separating her from the wealthy Inner Sea and the Heaven-Merging Sea was unimaginable... And now, standing before her was a Purple Mansion cultivator. She had found a stable backer!

Li Ximing had already started walking. Master and servant arrived before the monastery to find the grounds covered in kneeling people. Li Ximing did not enter, merely stating casually:

"Handle it all."

Xia Shouyu immediately bowed and stepped inside. She was met by a thunderous chorus of "Your Excellency" and "Gracious Matriarch." There were sounds of old men weeping with joy, middle-aged men begging bitterly for mercy, and soon, inexplicable cries of people trying to make her stay. Only fifteen minutes passed before the chicken-and-dog chaos subsided. Xia Shouyu walked out quickly and reported respectfully:

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, the temple's affairs are all settled. When this lowly one broke through, it caused a three-month drought that harmed the populace. I have already left the resources the Daoist Master granted with the temple, instructing them to send people to purchase rice and compensate the commoners."

Xia Shouyu had clearly already perceived Li Ximing’s stance. This action was both a probing stone and a final bit of compensation for her own temple. Li Ximing noted it and nodded slightly. The two mounted a ray of celestial light and soared toward the horizon.

Xia Shouyu remained in a kneeling posture on the light, peering faintly through the illusory glow at the crowds still kowtowing on the ground below. Her heart was filled with complex emotions, but a pool of inky blackness swiftly spread, and the world went dark.

"Great Void!"

As they traversed the Great Void, Li Ximing spoke.

"You did well. I cultivate in Jiangnan and hail from an Immortal Clan; I am part of the renowned orthodox path. Your mind is sharp, but when you arrive at the clan, you must cast aside the temperament and methods you learned in the Outer Seas."

Xia Shouyu let out a breath of relief and nodded respectfully. Li Ximing casually retrieved an outer robe painted with a moon-lake pattern from his storage bag, tossing it along with a pair of silver boots into her hands.

"We are going to meet a guest," he ordered.

Xia Shouyu's current attire was a mismatched, unpresentable mess. While this outer robe wasn't a formal Dharma Robe, it was made of soft, expensive spirit cloth and matched the boots perfectly. Draping it on would cover her shortcomings. The moment Xia Shouyu touched it, she loved it.

'Tsk, tsk, this material... this spiritual qi... This must be authentic Jiangnan goods.'

She draped it over herself, admiring it silently, careful not to disturb him further. Li Ximing, meanwhile, continued to travel through the Great Void, pondering his plan:

"A visit to the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain is in order. The Dantai family is a good friend of Si Boxiu, and he was the first person I visited back then. My current relationship with the Si family is also amicable, and he is closely connected to the Inner Sea, making him the most accurate source for information. It is worth a visit."

He finalized his itinerary. After traversing the Great Void for a short while, he broke through the void and reappeared. The seawater below was a mix of bronze-green and rainbow-red; they had clearly arrived at the Peacock Sea.

Xia Shouyu, not understanding the principles of Great Void travel, was struck dumb by the speed. Li Ximing, however, frowned. Seeing flocks of peacocks crisscrossing the sky, he immediately concealed their forms.

"Why is this flock of peacocks going insane... searching everywhere like their mothers just died..."

He ducked back into the Great Void. Although he didn't know the precise location of the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain, he simply flew toward the most perilous-looking place within the Great Void and emerged back into the world. Sure enough, a majestic mountain range materialized from the sea, appearing even more imposing amidst the churning waves.

The entire mountain range was a deep purple-red, covered in maple trees that were a rare sight in the Outer Seas, their leaves rising and falling like waves in the sea breeze. Li Ximing swept his gaze over it and materialized at the foot of the mountain.

He found himself before a massive, pure-white mountain gate archway that stood well over a hundred zhang tall.

The right pillar bore large, magnificent characters:

【Great Wonder Merging Truth Path】

The left pillar read:

【Spirit-Pacifying Moon-Clear Mountain】

Li Ximing glanced at the center beam, which read:

【Supreme Mound Nine Daos】

Just as the various families recognized the Li family as part of the Wei-Li Dao Lineage and thus targeted them with the Xiqi Daos, all Dao lineages traced their origins as far back as they could. These names held great significance. Li Ximing committed them to memory.

Immediately, a cultivator flew out from the mountain. He looked startled but remained respectful, bowing.

"Greetings, Daoist Master. This lowly cultivator is Dantai Muming of the Nine Mounds Dao Lineage. We were unaware of Your Immortal Carriage’s arrival and failed to provide a proper welcome. Please, enter the mountain to rest."

Li Ximing had heard at both the Sea Cape and here in the Peacock Sea that the master of Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain was exceptionally hospitable and had many friends. This Dantai Muming clearly had seen his share of the world; his reception was practiced and natural. His surprise likely stemmed only from not recognizing Li Ximing.

Behind him, Xia Shouyu was still reeling from the shock of the majestic mountain and the colossal archway. However, with her Daoist Master backer standing before her, the surge of inferiority was minimal. Instead, she felt a sense of shared glory and stepped forward slightly, trying her best to appear natural and not disgrace Li Ximing.

Li Ximing gave a slight nod. "Is this the cultivation abode of Daoist Master Dantai? I have long heard of your great name. I had a very pleasant discussion with Senior Yuanxiu last time, and he spoke of the Daoist Master's reputation. As I was passing the Peacock Sea and found myself with time to spare, I came for a visit."

Li Ximing did not state his own name, but Dantai Muming was visibly pleased.

"So you are a friend of Daoist Master Yuanxiu! We have truly been remiss... Please, Daoist Master, rest in the pavilion for a moment. I will go and fetch my elder."

Although Li Ximing spoke as if they were familiar, Dantai Muming maintained his vigilance and did not rashly invite him fully into the mountain. He sent someone to make inquiries while apologizing, "A few days ago, the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour from the north suddenly came to cause trouble. Our sect's Great Daoist Master was invited to Great Bestowal Copper Mountain to discuss important matters with the peacocks and cannot return immediately."

"However... our sect's Daoist Master Lingdu is currently in the sect discussing the Dao with Daoist Master Houfu. They have been at it for three months. I will send someone to ask them."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up.

'Daoist Master Houfu is here too!'

Daoist Master Houfu was from the Great Xiukiu Monastery. That monastery acted with considerable righteousness and had no conflicts with the Li Clan; they had even come to congratulate Li Ximing in the past. With him present, Li Ximing felt much more secure about this visit.

Only a few breaths passed before two Daoist Masters were seen treading through the air toward them.

The one in the lead was ancient, leaning on a wooden staff; this had to be Lingdu. The one behind him, dressed in shamanistic robes, was tall and thin. It was indeed Houfu, whom he had met before. When the two arrived, Lingdu looked slightly perplexed.

"Greetings, Your Excellency..."

Li Ximing offered a smile, but Houfu recognized him. He stepped forward, a faint smile pulling at his lips as he spoke.

"Senior Lingdu, this is a Daoist Master from our Jiangnan: Zhaojing."

Daoist Master Houfu didn't often travel in Jiangnan, but when he did, it was always with banging gongs and drums, in a carriage pulled by spirit beasts. The man loved his pageantry, and the Li family had presented him with congratulatory gifts back then. Li Ximing quickly bowed.

"Greetings, Senior Houfu! I never imagined the Daoist Master would be here. This is truly an unexpected joy!"

Houfu was, strictly speaking, a peer of Li Ximing's generation. When Li Ximing elevated his status this way, his smile broadened slightly. "You flatter me... Zhaojing, you are truly formidable!"

Li Ximing understood the implication. Houfu saw that he was in good condition and was tacitly praising him for escaping intact from a late-stage Daoist Master like Changxiao. But Li Ximing knew better than anyone that his survival had involved far too much luck. He smiled and deflected the praise. The elder, Lingdu, however, looked quite shocked. He studied Li Ximing from top to bottom before praising him.

"So it is the Imperial Scion, Zhaojing. This old man is Cao Xiyan of the Nine Mounds Immortal Dao, titled Lingdu. Greetings, Daoist Master."

"I am unworthy of the title 'Imperial Scion'... it is merely a false rumor spread in Jiangnan."

Li Ximing quickly deflected again. Lingdu kept the smile on his face, clearly not believing the denial. He lifted his sleeve and gestured.

"Zhaojing, please..."

The three rode the wind into the mountain interior. A cool breeze rustled past, sending maple leaves drifting through the air. Beneath the largest maple tree sat an ancient bronze chessboard, where black and white pieces were locked in a fierce, entangled struggle, clearly in the middle of an intense game.

Li Ximing felt a pang of nervousness, glancing at the board.

'...I've lived this long and never even touched a chess piece... Please don't ask me to play.'

Fortunately, Lingdu immediately moved the chessboard aside. Houfu stood behind him, hands clasped, and chuckled.

"Zhaojing... you've certainly made Tinglan search hard these past two years! I just asked this old senior. That woman didn't just ask my Great Xiukiu Monastery; she even came asking the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain. She is desperate to find you!"

# Chapter 803: The Peacock's Old Affairs

‘Tinglan is still looking for me…’

Li Ximing doubted Tinglan cared that much about him. Ten to one, she was just anxious to use the pills and worried he would vanish into seclusion for another decade.

‘After all, I’ve already read the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill formula, the Profound Peak Gate affair is settled, and she took the Purple Mansion Realm formation. Now that she has the materials, she’s too embarrassed—or finds it too difficult—to ask anyone else to refine it...’

He sat down with the two cultivators.

“I promised Daoist Friend Tinglan we had important matters to discuss,” Li Ximing explained, covering for the alchemy. “I was gone for several years and delayed things, so she came looking.”

Houfu just nodded and poured tea. Lingdu, however, was quite enthusiastic. The old man smiled.

“Zhaojing’s alchemy skills are profound. Perhaps she wants you to refine pills. In any case, it’s a good thing. We previously thought Zhaojing was severely injured and in seclusion, so we only put in a token effort to search. Now that we see you are safe and sound, I’m not sure how to reply to her.”

Lingdu clearly wanted no part in Purple Smoke’s affairs and was using one sentence to ask Li Ximing for a clear answer. Li Ximing understood his intent.

“There's no need to trouble Senior with messages. When I am free and return to Jiangnan, I will naturally find her.”

Although Tinglan was from the Green Pine Dao lineage, the Great Xiukui Monastery was no slouch either, being a former subordinate of an immortal estate. Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain was overseas. None of the factions had any incentive to curry favor with her; it was purely a matter of personal relationships. Since no one here was exceptionally close to Tinglan, the matter was dropped.

Li Ximing took the opportunity. “I spent several years healing in the Eastern Sea and have no news from Jiangnan. I wonder what the current situation is...”

Houfu disliked idle talk, perhaps worried that explaining too much would lower his status. He sipped his tea silently. Seeing this, Lingdu replied:

“Zhu Gong entered Shanji Prefecture and established a new mountain gate called the Sacred Writ Gate, another Profound Enterprise lineage. That noble, Li Zhouwei, fled to the sea. I heard they lost someone who cultivated lightning.”

Li Ximing’s gaze dropped. He set the teacup down and unconsciously wiped his hands on his robes. “Oh... haih...”

His buoyant mood from recovering his injuries instantly plummeted, replaced by an empty hollowness.

‘Li Chenghui left no bloodline... This is all my fault. My planning was insufficient. He should have been a pillar suppressing the clan's destiny, but because of my lack of foresight, he was killed so carelessly.’

The family only had so many pillars, and only a handful were selfless. Li Ximing knew exactly who they were. Grief and sorrow washed over him. It was a testament to his control that he didn't lose his composure, but for a moment, he truly couldn't speak.

Lingdu was experienced and saw at a glance that Li Ximing had lost a prized junior. He shook his head slightly.

“Whether it’s clan inheritance or bloodlines, it's all the same. Out of ten juniors, six are mediocre, three are useless profligates, and the one who shows promise has to drag the other nine along. That’s bad enough... but the more promising they are, the more we push them into danger to train them.”

“We masters and elders all hope that one outstanding junior will be the one to turn the tide in a crisis. If they perish achieving that, it's a worthy death. But more often than not, it doesn’t happen that way. It's the abrupt, accidental deaths that leave a tightness in your chest, a strength you can't use... just bitterness and rage!”

He stamped his foot.

“When I was young, I had a junior with excellent talent and an honest temperament. If he were alive today, he would have reached the Purple Mansion Realm. But he went on a routine trip to a market in the surrounding seas, and in one careless moment, he died in a woman’s bed. He didn't even use his talismans or protective treasures.”

“We investigated later. You couldn’t even blame the kid for being stupid. The woman was just a rogue cultivator. He wasn't manipulated by some supernatural art; it was purely love turning to hate. She just hated him for being a philanderer. It just shows that even for elders like us who have mastered divine arts, when someone's luck runs out... we can't save them in time.”

Hearing this, Li Ximing said quietly, “Senior speaks the truth. My family also has a romantic. It isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as they are clever. It's just that his talent wasn't high, making his future even more difficult.”

Of the three, only Houfu was young and childless, and the Great Xiukui Monastery wasn't his problem to worry about. He should have been carefree, yet his brow furrowed at the topic.

“Daoist Master Cao only worries about his own descendants. He doesn't know the anxieties of our sect lineages. You can’t divide the inheritance equally. Not only do the disciples below hate their martial brothers, they start to hate you. Our thirty-six peaks have more than fifty factions, all busy promoting their own relatives. It's more than a tangled mess. In the years I've been cultivating, the disciples beneath me have already split into six cliques.”

The two offered a word of comfort. Li Ximing tactfully composed himself. Houfu glanced at Lingdu, and the elder from the Nine Mounds lineage finally spoke, smiling.

“Since Zhaojing is here, it must be destiny. Zhaojing, you fought Changxiao... is your Dharma body well? Did you happen to see the silver bottle?”

Lingdu and Li Ximing weren't particularly close. Asking about a Dharma body was taboo. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with a worse temper might have stormed off. But the other party's faction was powerful, and Li Ximing had a calm demeanor. He only frowned.

“It still has some damage. I saw the silver bottle. It is extremely formidable.”

Lingdu's voice grew grave. “The Mirrored-Mirrage lineage is powerful. Since you were struck by that bottle, Zhaojing, you must not return to Jiangnan anytime soon... Changxiao will detect you.”

Li Ximing's heart pounded, his pupils dilating slightly.

‘Why didn't I notice anything?!’

Li Ximing had suspected early on that Changxiao’s divine art left a mark, but he hadn't found the slightest trace... and he had specifically used the Immortal Mirror to check!

‘Impossible... Something is amiss. How could it evade the Immortal Mirror? That insidious bastard probably guessed I had a way to detect it and deliberately held back... feigning and probing...’

Lingdu glanced at him. “We few lack ocular arts and cannot see clearly. However, my Nine Mounds lineage possesses a Shade-Cleansing Pool that can cleanse a Dharma body...”

He paused briefly, his meaning becoming obvious.

“However, there is a matter I was hoping to discuss.”

Li Ximing looked up slightly. Lingdu said softly: “Purple Mansion Realm spiritual fire... I wonder if Zhaojing is interested?”

Li Ximing’s heart leaped, but his expression remained neutral. “Oh? Which type might it be?”

The highest-grade Dharma Art of the Li family was undoubtedly the sixth-rank Great Parting's White Brilliance. This technique had strict requirements: it needed the Purple Mansion Realm Li Fire to practice. Li Ximing had coveted it for a long time. Now that he asked, Lingdu seemed caught off guard.

“I do not know which one it is... In short, it is neither Molten Fire nor Blazing Fire.”

Having just escaped a perilous situation, Li Ximing was hesitant. “Perhaps you could elaborate.”

Lingdu nodded. “Zhaojing has likely heard that something happened at the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour. There is unrest everywhere. Before our Great Daoist Master left, he speculated that a Merciful One from the temple must have perished.”

Li Ximing was confused about this. This Great Daoist Master of Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain was a dignified late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, equal in strength to Maha. He had no need to placate the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour, yet it sounded like he had been summoned.

“The Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour certainly carries itself with prestige.”

Lingdu immediately caught his meaning. “Years ago, the Peacock ancestor of the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour had connections with our lineage. The previous Temple Master also rendered a great service to our Mountain Lord. He is bound by sentiment to look after the Peacocks...”

“No wonder!”

The Peacock Sea was clearly suppressed by Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain, yet the place was teeming with peacocks. It was rare for Immortals and Buddhists to have good relations. Li Ximing had been suspicious.

Lingdu continued, “Thus, with a Merciful One perishing, he had to go, both for logical and personal reasons. The Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour has four Merciful Ones. One has fallen, one must report to the Buddhist Pure Land, and another must host the Great Daoist Master. That leaves only one free.”

“The item we mentioned is in the Peacock Sea. It is an inheritance left by an ancestor of the Dantai family, deeply related to the Peacocks. It was discovered many years ago, but we feared that any disturbance would force us to split it with the Peacocks. Given his personal ties, the Great Daoist Master couldn't possibly support us, so we never made a move. Now is the perfect opportunity.”

Li Ximing mostly understood. He rubbed his teacup for a moment but didn't agree, smiling instead. “Since it is a treasure of the Dantai family, where do I come in?”

Lingdu paused slightly. “First, the formation is difficult to break. Second... that Merciful One will likely sense us and come. We will be below retrieving the item, and we need Zhaojing to block him for a moment.”

Now Li Ximing understood. Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain didn't want to tear face with the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour. They needed an unrelated person to take the blame. The price was the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual fire from the inheritance.

‘It's possible... before I arrived, they were planning to make Houfu the villain. They were just discussing it. Then I suddenly showed up. These two figured that after the Wei-Li incident, I wouldn't fear offending some Buddhist cultivators... so they're using a spiritual fire to push me out front.’

Li Ximing didn't dare believe this was truly left by a Dantai ancestor. But at the least, the two of them spoke of this inheritance as if it were their own backyard, which meant they were confident. Li Ximing was hesitating when Houfu suddenly spoke:

“Zhaojing, if that Merciful One comes, Senior Lingdu cannot face him. Regardless of whether you or I step forward, that Merciful One will fight relentlessly. If we duel and our identities are exposed, it’s trouble. Why don't we step out together? Two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators should be enough to intimidate him into retreating. We won't even need to fight, which reduces the risk of exposure by ninety percent.”

Houfu had the Great Xiukui Monastery behind him, so his words carried weight. This proposal was much more comfortable. Even if something went wrong, Houfu would be there to share the consequences. Li Ximing was tempted. He specifically asked:

“Is the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour backed by the Way of Compassion or the Way of Emptiness?”

“It is the Way of Compassion.”

Li Ximing relaxed slightly.

His grand-uncle, Li Xuanfeng, had killed eighteen Master Monks of the Way of Emptiness by the river, destroying a great destiny for that line. If this thing had even the slightest connection to the Way of Emptiness, Li Ximing wouldn't touch it. Pondering this, he nodded.

“We can try it.”

“Excellent!”

Lingdu nodded, smiling. “We must trouble Zhaojing to cultivate on the mountain for a time. We will finalize the preparations. When the time comes for it to appear, we will call you. Afterward, we will ask Zhaojing to meet the Great Daoist Master and proceed with the cleansing.”

Ultimately, Li Ximing decided he needed the cleansing to ease his suspicions. The three poured tea, acknowledging each other, and the matter was settled.

***

Moongaze Lake.

The bright moon dominated the lake, its light rolling across the sparkling waves. Around the shore, beams of white Dharma light frequently took flight, speeding toward the central island, heading first to the central hall. After a brief stop, they would shuttle toward the rear halls.

At the head of the main hall still sat a man in black robes, a writing brush in hand. Three years had passed, but Li Zhouluo's face hadn't changed much. He merely handled the petitions with much swifter action, his expression no longer the 'facing a great enemy' look of the past.

He quickly set the brush down and glanced at the sky. It was only midnight.

Ever since Li Xuanxuan had announced the three-year inspection, Li Zhouluo's workload had visibly shrunk.

Those prefectures and peaks that used to submit petitions for every trivial matter had suddenly grown brains, cleverly including their proposed solutions in the reports. Those clan members from certain branches who had been dead as pigs, relying only on connections, suddenly came alive, running diligently about the island every day. The clan members governing the outer territories abruptly became selfless and incorruptible. Meanwhile, the main branch members touring the periphery suddenly became fountains of strategy, spotting corruption at a glance and indignantly exposing waves of dirty officials, resulting in the downfall of a Dou family member.

‘Such diligence...’

Li Zhouluo suddenly realized he barely had to lift a finger. Even disciplining a few external families prompted a crowd of indignant clan members to lead the charge. All of this was good, naturally, except that the Qingdu cultivators had grown slightly cold. Although still respectful, they lacked their previous warmth.

He understood that his handling of the Li Chengpan affair three years ago had been poor. The status and power of the Qingdu cultivators were based on the need for those in authority to suppress the main branch. His favoritism had been too obvious, turning the matter into a confused mess. Later, he proactively established the 'legacy shelter' system, which naturally made it hard to win their affection.

‘But... none of that matters...’

Li Zhouluo firmly remembered Li Xuanxuan's words: *Do what you can with the power you have.* He was just here to earn enough goodwill before stepping down. Thinking this, he felt much better.

He pondered a moment. A man in plain robes was waiting nearby. Li Zhouluo finally noticed him and smiled.

“Uncle Chengpan, how are matters in the west?”

This was the same Li Chengpan from back then. The 'blood petition' incident had nearly forced him to imprison the Qingdu contingent. Although the investigation later cleared things up—with only a Li Hun being found guilty—Li Zhouluo could no longer use him in an official capacity, making him an assistant in the hall.

Li Chengpan bowed. “Everything is in order. This year's harvest from the spirit mines has been turned over to the clan.”

Li Zhouluo sighed softly. Calculating the time, the legacy inspection wasn't far off.

‘The old master said to grant the legacy shelters early. Let them be happy for a while, lest Jiangqian starts playing the bad cop the moment he comes out. That would be too obvious...’

The current spiritual atmosphere was Inward Heart Surging Profundity, which favored Fire-virtue. Li Jiangqian's seclusion definitely wouldn't last long. This matter couldn't be delayed.

Just as he was thinking, a clear breeze seemed to pass through the courtyard, slowly revealing a figure. It was a middle-aged man in a black, feather-like robe, a two-foot-long ink-jade pendant at his waist. His brow ridges were slightly high, and his eyes held a hint of a smile.

“Father!”

Li Zhouluo startled, rushing down the steps, overjoyed. “You've come out of seclusion!”

Several years had passed. Li Chenghuai's cultivation had stabilized further, a pure, thick gray brilliance circulating in his hair. His features weren't striking, and his Untraceable Presence technique concealed his immortal foundation, making him appear even more unremarkable. He nodded lightly.

“The ancestral sacrifice is approaching, and the family needs someone to oversee the situation. I estimated that Jiangqian was also about to emerge, so I came out. I toured the island. The family is quite lively, and the atmosphere is good. You've done well.”

Li Zhouluo knew exactly why this was, and felt ashamed. He lowered his voice. “Father... you misunderstand...”

### Chapter 804: Great Parting Scripture

Li Chenghuai paused, stunned. Li Zhouluo quickly rose, gathered several reports from the desk, and handed them over, explaining the situation in a low voice. Li Chenghuai’s brow furrowed tightly as he read. He raised an eyebrow. "So, this was waiting for me..."

After reviewing the matters of the western shore, he looked over Li Zhouluo’s proposed solutions. He glanced at them only briefly before shaking his head. "Summary execution in court. That was poorly handled... You lack the necessary prestige, and you were afraid of wounding the clan’s sentiments..."

Finally, he read the report regarding the legacy shelter appointments. He froze for a moment but didn't say much, merely sighing. "Let us go."

With Li Chenghuai out of seclusion, Li Zhouluo felt as if a thousand-pound weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He unfastened his black robe, draped it over his arm, and hurried to keep pace. As they walked, Li Chenghuai asked, "Where is the list of legacy shelter appointments?"

Li Zhouluo had it ready, tucked inside his robes. He presented it to his father. Li Chenghuai scanned it. "You balanced the four branches, so it's not a complete failure. The numbers are a bit high, but since the Old Master will allow Jiangqian to handle this, having a few extra names doesn't matter."

Li Zhouluo didn't mention Li Xuanxuan’s intentions, but Li Chenghuai, calculating the timeline, already understood. He didn't press the point and simply walked forward, suddenly asking, "Regarding Brother Cheng's inheritance, there were three candidates in the ancestral registry. What is the status of those three now?"

Li Zhouluo had been monitoring the situation and replied immediately. "The one with the closest blood relation and the most suitable age is Zhoutui. He has been working diligently on the island, showing great enthusiasm for both his cultivation and the management of the spirit fields..."

"The older one is Li Zhouda, also closely related. He’s impulsive and decisive, a whirlwind in action. He currently holds a post in the Jade Court. His only flaw is his temper. Last year, he got drunk and assaulted a clansman... The matter was reported all the way to Qingdu."

He paused briefly before finishing. "There is one more, Li Zhouxun, whose bloodline is more distant. He’s the one the elder allowed to stay in the manor before he passed. He seems to have given up hope early on. He didn't take any position on the island; instead, he has used this time to enter seclusion and cultivate."

Li Chenghuai pondered this for a breath, then shook his head. "A difficult choice..."

While Zhoutui's performance was good, his weeping at the funeral had been deeply unsettling. Zhouda’s violent temper naturally caused hesitation. As for the last one, Zhouxun—whether out of respect for Li Cheng’s lineage or some other reason—he had ultimately withdrawn himself, making it difficult for Li Chenghuai to help him even if he wanted to.

He mulled it over as they paused in the corridor. "What are their cultivation levels?"

Li Zhouluo bowed. "Zhouda is already at Qi Refining; he’s quite well-known among the brethren, and the support for him is slightly higher. The other two are still at Embyronic Breathing. Younger brothers Zhoutui and Zhouxun are of similar age and cultivation."

Li Zhouluo didn't state it explicitly, but his meaning was clear. Although the island provided them equal treatment, the resources Zhoutui enjoyed from his parents' generation were far beyond what the unsupported Zhouxun could access. This suggested Zhoutui's talent was inferior. Li Chenghuai understood. He resumed walking and nodded. "I see. You are not to interfere in this matter. After all, the Dao lineage has already been passed down. We don't know who will ultimately reach Foundation Establishment. The Dharma artifacts are being kept safe in the clan vaults. I will find an opportunity to meet Zhouxun. Do not show favoritism to anyone, nor express your approval."

If it hadn't been for Li Xuanxuan's earlier lecture, Li Zhouluo might have been confused by his father’s words. Now, however, he understood perfectly. "Your son understood long ago. I have not met privately with any of them in these years."

"Good." Li Chenghuai acknowledged, smiling. "This rare opportunity to temper you for three years has helped you mature greatly."

Li Zhouluo could only offer a sheepish smile. "I finally understand the stakes. If the Old Master hadn't been here, the lake our family spent six generations building would have been ruined by me in just two or three years."

The middle-aged man before him shook his head. "A hundred years of wise governance by the ancestors is only enough to survive one generation of incompetence. And one generation of incompetence is not enough to withstand three years of tyranny..."

He was counseling his eldest son when an apricot-yellow glow ascended into the sky. It drifted lazily toward the horizon, then descended mid-flight, transforming into countless apricot-colored blossoms of Li Fire that suddenly blew out over the lake.

These motes of Li Fire, large and small, flashed in the air with an ethereal grace, like countless river lanterns being released. The night had not yet fully yielded; in the pre-dawn twilight, the lake’s surface reflected the sky full of burning blossoms, drawing nearby cultivators to ride the winds and spectate.

*Omm!*

The defensive array of distant Mount Qingdu instantly activated. Colors shot toward the zenith as the [Morning Mist] within the formation surged, sweeping across the sky and scouring the stray Li Fire clean.

Li Zhouluo's eyes lit up. Li Chenghuai urgently mounted the wind, circling in the air. Just as he expected, he saw a man in crimson robes flying toward them, riding the fire. The robe was worn loosely, revealing a plain white tunic beneath. His black hair was wreathed in apricot-yellow flames.

He was tall and slender, with long, dark brows over a pair of golden eyes. His arms were crossed over his chest, a sword at his hip. In one fair hand, he held a small, round hammer, resting it casually against his shoulder.

Seeing Li Chenghuai approach, the young man smiled, the picture of high spirits. "Greetings, Grand-Uncle!"

"Congratulations!" Li Jiangqian clasped his hands and bowed. Li Chenghuai accepted with a smile. As the others hurried over, Li Jiangqian looked up slightly. His first question was: "How is Quewan?"

Li Zhouluo, having just arrived, smiled at the question. "Quewan also entered seclusion before the new year. She said she needed to harmonize her aura. Her cultivation has reached the peak of perfection; she is just choosing the right day to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Good." Although Li Jiangqian's generation was junior, his status was unique. Now that he had forged his immortal foundation, the weight of his words had undergone a qualitative change. He bowed to the assembled elders, and his second question was: "Is there any news from home regarding my father and the Daoist Master?"

Li Chenghuai shook his head as he led him down to the island. Li Jiangqian stood firm in the courtyard. When everyone had taken their seats, he scanned the room and noted one absence: Li Zhouming.

Li Jiangqian waited patiently. After half a cup of tea, a young man in red robes rushed in from outside the hall. Li Zhouming didn't dare meet Li Xuanxuan’s gaze, shrinking down as he slunk into a seat on the side.

The old man’s eyes were sharp. He noted that although the youth's clothes were tidy, his boots were mismatched and his hair ornament was overly simple. He had clearly worn his flamboyant clothes out riding this morning; nine times out of ten, he was flirting with some girl on the lake shore again.

Only then did Li Jiangqian clasp his hands in a formal bow. "Reporting to the elders: This junior has successfully forged the immortal foundation, 'Great Parting Scripture.' The Li Fire is now my constant companion. In motion, it can dispel golden gales and consume Horn Wood, burn metal and boil the seas. In stillness, it can stabilize flame and draw the parting light without startling a sparrow..."

He said only this, and the surrounding elders erupted in congratulations. Li Jiangqian nodded, accepting them. Li Xuanxuan observed this, then cleared his throat. "Let us dismiss for now..."

The old man waved his hand, sending the others away. He pulled Li Jiangqian aside into an inner room and closed the doors. "How is it? You cultivated the sixth-grade technique from the family archives. No one in our clan has ever succeeded with it before. It must possess unusual qualities."

Li Jiangqian helped him to a seat and served him tea, lowering his voice. "Old Master, I have mastered the Great Parting Scripture. This foundation is centered on arts. The foundation itself can store the parting light, granting extreme speed when riding fire. It connects to the 'First Manifestation of the Heavens,' so it can also dispel evil. Its innate mystery involves compounding medicines using wood; consuming them can extend life, heal wounds, and provide enhancements..."

"Oh?" Li Xuanxuan's eyes brightened. "Compounding medicines? Like alchemy?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head. He extended a hand, pressing two fingers together and bracing them with his thumb at the middle knuckle. *Pop.* A bright, apricot-yellow flame erupted.

This flame was unlike the eager, restless Li Fire they usually saw, nor was it like the five types of surging Li Fire within the [Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner]. Instead, it rested perfectly steady on his fingertip, utterly motionless.

He smiled. "The unusual quality the Old Master spoke of... I am afraid it is this flame."

"The fire of my immortal foundation is called 'Apricot Li.' Ordinary fire fears earth, but this fire is highly resistant. The inheritance text described it in detail: aside from the two sacred earths of the Jixian Immortal Dao, it fears no other earth. Unfortunately, it is too volatile to be placed in a cauldron and cannot be used for alchemy. My sea of qi is entirely apricot-yellow. Even when I reach the Purple Mansion Realm, I will have no affinity with pill refinement."

"And the medicines compounded by it... most of them can only be consumed by me. Perhaps Luan birds and sparrows could also stomach them."

Li Xuanxuan nodded, indicating he understood. He sighed. "Truly worthy of a sixth-grade Li Fire technique. It possesses almost every advantage Li Fire can offer, and even manages to squeeze out a healing mystery..."

Li Jiangqian quickly waved his hands. "The division of Dao paths still holds true. Stealth, alchemy, healing others—this Dao path is completely incapable of them. And while my fire-riding speed is fast, the parting light is too intense, making it difficult to cultivate evasion arts. It’s all a trade-off. You gain in one area and lose in another; you cannot have it all!"

The old man nodded repeatedly, his expression full of emotion. He let out a long breath. "Now that you are out of seclusion, I must trouble you with family matters..."

The old man retrieved a small wooden box from the desk. He opened it with one hand, revealing a thick stack of silk cloth inside, clearly covered in detailed records. Puzzled, Li Jiangqian accepted it and began to read.

The young man scanned it, flipping through the stack once with one hand. He read straight to the bottom, then flipped back to the beginning, carefully rereading the section on the west bank. He laughed. "They’ve eaten the leopard's gall."

Li Xuanxuan’s heart tightened when he heard that. Li Xixuan and the others were, after all, mortals; they could not withstand Li Jiangqian's methods. The old man quickly grabbed his arm. "These people are still your elders. Many are highly respected, and many of their children sacrificed themselves for the clan. The island's affairs must be resolved, certainly, but you cannot allow people’s hearts to grow cold."

"I understand... I understand!" Li Jiangqian held the silk report in one hand. The long white cloth trailed down, dragging on the floor, stirring gently in the draft. He kept his head bowed toward the text and smiled. "Just leave this matter to me. I'll just have to trouble Uncle Zhouluo to manage the household for a few more months, just to quiet the chatter below."

***

Outside the hall.

Li Zhouluo exited the main hall, leaving it to the other two. He accompanied Li Chenghuai down. Only then did he remember another matter, and he relayed the news of the letter from Li Xizhi.

Li Zhouluo was clearly proud, his tone slightly agitated. Li Chenghuai’s expression, however, remained largely unchanged. He waited for the young man to finish, remaining silent for a long time before finally saying, "He has always been formidable."

The relationship between his father, Li Chenghuai, and his grandfather, Li Xizhi, was certainly not close. Li Zhouluo hesitated slightly, then continued, "Grandfather's meaning is that he wishes for me to travel to the Southern Sea before my Foundation Establishment. He wants to select a suitable Dao companion for me... and he wants me to make my breakthrough there, in the Southern Sea."

Li Chenghuai actually nodded at this. "That is naturally for the best. Marriage is a critical affair. Having him inspect the candidates for you is much better."

Li Zhouluo studied his father's expression, lowering his voice. "Grandfather also had his disciple, Quan Yuduan, bring a letter back. But at that time, Father was still in seclusion. He stated he must deliver it personally into Father’s hands. He returned a year ago and has been cultivating in the wilderness region. I just sent someone to retrieve him."

Wang Quwan and the others had gone north. Letters had arrived earlier saying they had entered the Earth Palace and encountered several other direct lineage disciples, but communications ceased half a year ago. Even Quan Yuduan could no longer contact those inside. Now, three years had passed with no sound from the Dao lineage of Xiaoshi Mountain in the north. They estimated there must be another grotto-heaven hidden below. Quan Yuduan, who had been acting as escort, couldn't wait idly. Unsure if he had even completed his sect mission, he spent the last two years wandering Jiangbei and had only recently returned to the wilderness.

At Li Zhouluo's mention that Li Xizhi had left a personal letter for him, Li Chenghuai finally showed anxiety. He paced the courtyard twice. Just as dawn broke, he saw Quan Yuduan, dressed in brilliant red robes, approaching at high speed under escort.

The young man wore a jade crown. He glanced at the Dharma robes, saw the black jade pendant at his waist, and recognized Li Chenghuai. Visibly excited, he bowed low before him, speaking respectfully. "Greetings, Young Master! Master and Mistress have missed you terribly these past years. They often speak of you... but ten thousand li separate you, preventing a meeting..."

Li Chenghuai awkwardly helped him rise. Quan Yuduan, having said his piece, retrieved a letter from his sleeve. "This letter is in the Master’s own hand," he said softly. "He instructed me that I must deliver it, that all others must be dismissed, and that the Young Master must open it personally."

Li Chenghuai felt the letter. It wasn't thick; it was, in fact, quite thin. It was only wrapped in spirit-cloth, not formally sealed. It was clearly a personal note. He glanced around. Li Zhouluo immediately took the hint, led the others out, and securely closed the hall doors.

Only then did Li Chenghuai raise his hands, break the simple seal, and withdraw the pure white paper. The elegant, flowing script of Li Xizhi met his eyes:

"Written by hand on the twentieth of the spring moon. Your father currently guards the Southern Sea. All affairs are stable. I am presently selecting a wife for my grandson.

If you harbor the ambition to pursue the profound, verify your Dao, and seek transcendent abilities, you may follow Yuduan south across the sea. Mysterious pills, wondrous medicines, Dharma artifacts, and spirit objects; blessed lands and immortal mountains—your father will exhaust his strength to provide you with everything.

If your heart desires only to shelter the clan and live out your remaining years in peace, I have instructed Yuduan to bring my Daoist collection of many years, silks and brocades, fine foods and jade wares. You may listen to the rain from the bridge, sufficient to shelter your descendants, ensuring three generations of honor and nobility.

Written by the hand of Father Zhi."

Li Chenghuai read every single word. Then he turned the letter over. Though he knew the back was blank, he scanned it up and down anyway, turning the paper over and over in his hands.

When Quan Yuduan received no reply, he waited a moment longer before speaking softly. "Reporting to the Young Master, the Master instructed me to bring his Daoist collection. It is anchored by a Purple Mansion Realm talisman, and includes Foundation Establishment Dharma artifacts, spirit objects, talismans, and treasure medicines—everything is included..."

He began rattling off a list of items, but Li Chenghuai seemed oblivious, as if just waking from a dream. He asked hoarsely, "Did he... did he have any other instructions?"

Quan Yuduan grew uneasy at his tone but only bowed respectfully. "Master... Master said that in former years, he could barely protect himself, much less look after the Young Master. He wishes to make amends now."

### Chapter 805: The Register

Li Chenghuai listened quietly, tucked the letter into his sleeve, and replied, “I understand. When will Daoist Friend Yuduan be heading back for a reply?”

Quan Yuduan hesitated. “My junior brother is still in the north, so it should be some time yet. For now, I will remain here cultivating by the shore. The young master may take his time to consider... When you have word, simply summon me from the wilderness.”

Li Chenghuai gave a slight nod. Quan Yuduan retreated. As the hall doors opened, the voice of his eldest son, Li Zhouluo, could be heard cheerfully greeting Quan Yuduan. Then, with a creak, the doors shut firmly, sealing all the noise outside.

Li Chenghuai stood rooted to the spot. He kept his hand over his sleeve, motionless, his gaze frozen. He remained that way until the light in the room shifted. Li Zhouluo, having waited outside for a long time, finally knocked and entered.

“Father...” Li Zhouluo called softly.

Li Chenghuai was still clutching the letter in his sleeve. His lips moved, but he avoided the topic, asking instead, “Are you going to the Southern Sea with Quan Yuduan?”

Li Zhouluo was practically vibrating with impatience, wishing the days would fly by. The last three to five years had been nothing but bitter, grueling work, and he was thoroughly sick of it. At the mention of the trip, his voice filled with delight. “Exactly! I’m just waiting for them to return!”

Hearing that tone, Li Chenghuai understood. 'The child is just waiting to follow Quan Yuduan to the Southern Sea to enjoy himself and meet the fairy maidens of the various sects. He’s brimming with anticipation.'

It was only human nature. Had Li Chenghuai himself been blessed with such an opportunity in his youth, he too would have been restless and desperate with waiting. He poured a cup of tea. “Good. You must prepare well. Do not waste this opportunity.”

Li Zhouluo could see his father was unsettled and looked like he wanted to stop himself from speaking, likely wanting to ask about the letter. Before his son could voice the question, Li Chenghuai waved him away. Zhoulou had no choice but to depart, albeit reluctantly.

Once the hall was empty, Li Chenghuai finally retrieved the letter. He placed it gently on the table, face down.

He certainly knew the weight this letter carried. To put it bluntly, any one of the choices offered within it would make a cultivator from Jiangnan weep with joy. It was clearly something to be celebrated, yet he could not muster half a smile.

He stood alone in the hall for half the night until, at last, he heard movement at the entrance. An old man in blue-gray robes pushed the door open. Li Chenghuai bowed his head slightly.

“Greetings, Elder.”

Only then did he offer the letter. Li Xuanxuan sat down, poured some tea, and began to read it carefully. Li Chenghuai slowly shook his head and spoke.

“What does he owe me... What is there to owe? Those grievances from the days of living under another’s roof, without a father or mother... Can those wounds really be mended with these things?”

Li Xuanxuan remained focused on the letter, his gaze profound. Li Chenghuai’s expression, however, seemed almost detached as he said softly, “I might as well be frank with you. If this letter had arrived twenty years ago, I would have thrown it right back in Quan Yuduan’s face and told him clearly: I don’t want either choice.”

He let out a short laugh, then sighed. “But it came too late. I, Li Chenghuai, am already a father. Within the clan, I am considered an elder. I have far too much to consider now. How could I bear to throw it away? The days of youthful ignorance are long gone. To put it bluntly, my past resentment can now only be called petulance. That is the only reason I accepted this letter.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded heavily. “I understand...”

The old man filled the teacup. “Of the four in the 'Xi' generation... each had their duties back then. Never mind you; Ximing and Chengzhi were in the same position. Chengzhi is always respectful, but I know in his heart, he cannot feel close to Ximing either. This... it is an extremely difficult situation. Don’t say he doesn't understand you. In truth, you also do not understand your father.”

“At that time, there were far too many compromises to be made...”

The old man raised a hand to his cheek, feeling for a small, hard bump beneath the skin. He motioned for Li Chenghuai to look. “See this? Back then, my inner demons flared up. I sought help all the way to the Hengzhu Immortal Dao. They inserted five golden light pills into my flesh. I can still feel them to this day. The injury healed, but the mark left on my face is... unsightly.”

“Your situation is the same mold. Back then, the clan endured humiliation and swallowed its grievances, compromising itself into this state. Now, as you feel the rugged scars of the past, it is only natural to feel that imbalance in your heart. It is reasonable that you want to speak out, to ask questions... Your father is a reasonable man. Write a reply. Speak your mind, make it perfectly clear. You do not need to pretend you can’t feel the scars.”

Li Chenghuai remained silent for a moment. Li Xuanxuan had already pulled him toward the main seat. The old man pressed the brush into his hand while beginning to grind the ink, urging him, “Come. Write.”

***

When Li Zhouluo emerged from the hall, Quan Yuduan, dressed in his red robes, was still admiring the scenery on the island. Although Li Zhouluo was intensely curious about the letter his grandfather had received, he did not ask. He exchanged a few more pleasantries with Quan Yuduan before returning to the main hall.

As he settled into the main seat, Dili Guang approached to light the lamps. Li Zhouluo smiled. “What are your arrangements for the future?”

Li Zhouluo didn't need to elaborate. Dili Guang was exceptionally sharp; a man like him possessed a natural instinct and could sense that Li Zhouluo's time governing the clan was drawing to a close.

He understood precisely what Li Zhouluo was asking. He replied with deep respect, “Whatever the Clan Head arranges... this subordinate will follow. If I am fortunate enough to continue following the Clan Head, it will truly be a blessing I have cultivated...”

Only the direct inner circle knew of Li Zhouluo’s impending trip to the Southern Sea, but Dili Guang seemed utterly convinced that following him would lead to great benefits. His sincerity was palpable, making Li Zhouluo nod in approval.

Li Zhouluo was reading through scrolls when a report came from outside. Cui Jueyin had arrived to make a report.

In all the years Li Zhouluo had managed the clan, Cui Jueyin had always handled the matter of the Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails with methodical precision, reporting exactly once every three months. A sudden visit meant there was definitely a situation with the Purple Mansion array.

He shot to his feet. “Quickly, bring Protector Cui in!”

Dili Guang immediately went down personally to escort him. Once Cui Jueyin was in the hall, Dili Guang dismissed the other attendants, shut the doors himself, and stood guard outside.

Cui Jueyin looked much the same as he had three years prior. This direct descendant of the Cui family offered his customary humble salute and reported:

“Clan Head, the main bodies of the first twelve of the thirty-two profound needles are more than half-forged. However, the Purple Smoke Gate has already begun packing their baggage. The contingent of cultivators currently on the island is about to return to the sect, to be replaced by another batch. According to what Lord Wen Wu said, this is to prevent too much of the array pattern from being exposed.”

'Wen Wu is so slick-tongued he could talk the dead back to life,' Li Zhouluo thought. 'It’s impossible to know if he truly fears exposing the patterns or if this is just a scheduled rotation.'

Cui Jueyin continued, “He was mobilized back overnight and did not have time to pay his respects to the Clan Head, so he entrusted me with his apologies... He also asked me to pass on a message... He said that Li Quexi is already preparing to break through to Qi Refining, and the Purple Smoke Gate has prepared all the necessary pills for her.”

Li Quexi breaking through to Qi Refining was not surprising; Li Zhouluo actually felt it was slightly overdue. Regardless of whether the other party needed it, the clan had to send its portion. He nodded. “I will dispatch someone to the Purple Smoke Gate at once with a share of cultivation resources for her breakthrough.”

“Besides this matter, there is one other urgent affair,” Cui Jueyin said respectfully. “A Purple Smoke Gate cultivator, while traveling the region, mentioned that he had been guiding a child from a small household on the lake. Originally, he said he just found the child endearing... but after three to five years, feelings developed. When it was time to leave, he couldn't bear it. This time, he wishes to take the child back to the sect... and accept him as a disciple. He asked me to inquire with the Clan Head first.”

This was no small matter. Li Zhouluo was startled. “Which family? What is their surname?”

Cui Jueyin gave a bitter smile. “The Ding clan... A minor branch of the Ding clan that scattered to the lakeside... just a widow and an orphan. The mother has some minor cultivation, but in my opinion, this matter is not entirely... respectable.”

'The Ding clan!'

Suspicion immediately rose in Li Zhouluo’s mind. “Although this is somewhat abrupt, how is it not respectable?”

Cui Jueyin sighed softly. “That Ding family member died at the hands of the Floating Cloud Cave. Ding Weizeng even knows his name, so the widow and orphan have not had a difficult life. From what I observed, that Purple Smoke cultivator... harbors certain... intentions... toward the widow. He has stayed overnight. It is said that late one windy night, the sounds alerted the neighbors. Fortunately, no one recognized him. The child does not seem resistant to the idea...”

“This... He is a dignified Foundation Establishment cultivator. He didn’t even bother to set up a simple privacy array? Such indiscretion...”

Li Zhouluo’s expression turned strange. A cultivator from the Purple Smoke Gate could absolutely have concealed the noise. He could only sigh at the man’s peculiar habits. He understood the situation now. After a moment of hesitation, he said awkwardly, “This matter requires notifying Ding Weizeng... In any case, it can be counted as a good thing. What is the status of that Purple Smoke Gate cultivator? Is he known for being a fickle womanizer? My only fear is that he takes them there, and then cruelly abandons them after a few years. That would reflect poorly on us.”

Cui Jueyin replied, “The child is named Ding Mu. The cultivator is the master of Bell-Tether Peak at the Purple Smoke Gate. His name is Cao Chu, and his Daoist title is Huxizi. I have not heard rumors of him being fickle, but he already has one wife and two concubines at his peak. If she goes with him, she will also be taken as a concubine.”

This left Li Zhouluo with no recourse. Slightly embarrassed, he said, “If both parties are willing... we must still wait for an official representative from the Purple Smoke Gate to make the inquiry. After all, from my perspective, she is the one who stands to lose in this arrangement. This must be handled properly...”

“Indeed!”

Ding Mu was not of the Li lineage, nor from any famous family. His relationship to Ding Weizeng was distant, so the matter wasn't overly sensitive. But they were ultimately under the Li family's protection, so this naturally required official communication between the two Purple Mansion powers.

Cui Jueyin confirmed, “Daoist Friend Cao Chu has already reported this to his sect. Someone should be arriving soon to negotiate the matter.”

“Good.” Li Zhouluo let out a slight breath of relief. He watched Cui Jueyin depart, his mind already calculating.

'This Ding Mu will surely be isolated and powerless when he first arrives at the sect. This is the perfect time to provide timely aid. If we handle this well and he matures within the Purple Smoke Gate, we will have secured another stable connection. This is purely beneficial, with no drawbacks.'

With Li Jiangqian having emerged from seclusion, Li Zhouluo felt the pressure ease. There were only two major tasks left to handle: announcing the benefice register and conducting the ancestral sacrifice.

“Go and invite Jiangqian to come here,” he ordered.

A short while later, Li Jiangqian entered the hall. Li Zhouluo smiled and rose to greet him. “The date of the clan sacrifice is approaching. The usual procedures remain unchanged, which means we still need to capture a Demon beast. Will we be using a Foundation Establishment-level beast this year? Such creatures are rather difficult to find these days...”

The choice of sacrificial beast was usually decided by the clan's Foundation Establishment cultivators. With Li Minggong in seclusion, the decision fell to Li Chenghuai and Li Jiangqian. Li Zhouluo was probing for their inclination, suggesting tactfully, “The clan’s resources are currently quite strained, and you have only just broken through... In my opinion... perhaps it is best we keep everything simple this year.”

After all, Li Minggong was in seclusion. The clan's two early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators were unlikely to hunt together. The task would fall to Li Chenghuai, the stronger of the two. But whether fighting or just luring the beast, the current situation was unclear, making it an obvious risk.

In Li Zhouluo’s eyes, the sacrifice was merely a grand ceremony. At such a critical juncture, there was no need for such a high-profile display.

Li Jiangqian understood his concerns. He, however, still harbored thoughts of seeking out Talisman Qi.

'If I go to the Eastern Sea or the Helin Mountains, I wonder if I can even make it back in time...'

He wasn't afraid of failing to capture a beast; setting aside Li Chenghuai, he alone was more than confident of handling any wild Demon. The problem was that the clan's status had changed. In the past, they were a minor Foundation Establishment clan that nobody paid attention to. Now, they were a Purple Mansion power, and their Daoist Master was not on the lake. Many eyes were watching. Making a large commotion would certainly attract suspicion.

If Li Ximing were present, he could simply shuttle through the Great Void, grab a beast, and be back on the mountain for the sacrifice before anyone knew. Even if they found out, they would just assume it was for alchemy. But with Li Ximing absent, the sight of them hauling a massive beast back to the island would appear highly improper.

He frowned and finally replied, “Clan Head speaks reasonably. This matter requires further deliberation. This junior will first ask the Elder for his opinion before we make a final decision.”

Li Zhouluo nodded and pushed the register on his desk forward. The names were already recorded on a gold-bordered scroll. “This is the register for the benefice. Jiangqian, please take a look.”

But Li Jiangqian smiled and made no move to take the scroll. Instead, he bowed. “There is no need. The Clan Head may arrange it and announce it as he sees fit. I am just going to take a walk around the island.”

***

Elsewhere on the island.

The morning dawn was just breaking over the lake. A certain residence was already bustling with activity. The two imposing green-tiger stone statues flanking the entrance were draped in bright red silk, and servants, also dressed in red, smiled and offered congratulations to all arrivals.

The plaque above the main gate flowed with light, the two gilded characters for "Dongxu" positively glowing. The round, pale Li Xixuan stood before the gate, dressed in festive red robes, accepting the greetings of those who called him "Master."

The "Dongxu" Residence was the ancestral home of the Yuanwan Branch. It had once been quite spacious, but as the descendants multiplied, the courtyard had been divided into four wings, and each wing divided into four more rooms. While it looked magnificent from the outside, the interior was shockingly cramped. Every time Li Xixuan stood at this gate, he used to sigh. Today, he was not sighing. His face was beaming.

Waiting just inside was Li Minggong's younger brother, his face flush with success, wearing a colorful patterned headscarf. Guests treated him with marked respect. As one group entered, a man in short-cut robes hurried up to him, rubbing his hands gleefully.

“Brother Chang, several of your sons and nephews received the benefice this time! You’ll be needing good residences now, won't you? I happen to have some excellent locations available...”

The middle-aged man in the colorful headscarf was basking in his triumph. His good mood made him generous even to this opportunistic housing broker. He just laughed. “Wait a few days! There will be plenty of profit for you to make!”

He roared with laughter and pulled the man inside. Past the gate, the courtyard had been modified and was now extremely small, packed tight with well-wishers. He stuck his chest out, walking with an imposing air that stood in stark contrast to his father, Li Xixuan, who walked ahead of him, hunched over and casting suspicious glances at everything.

The son announced loudly, “In this round of the clan benefice, our Yuanwan Dongxu Residence has five members selected, totaling four branches! Everyone...”

He raised his cup, beaming. “The Main Branch cherishes its clan members, and all our families live in harmony! This is a toast to the Lake! A toast to the Island! And a toast to the Clan!”

# Chapter 806: The Eastern Residence

The crowd raised their cups in celebration. Li Chengzai, wearing a vibrant kerchief, was the picture of high spirits. Li Xixuan, however, kept his eyes wide, sweeping the room again and again as he counted the guests. Whatever ease he had felt outside the courtyard had long since been tossed to the nine heavens.

'The Chen Clan and the An clan didn't send anyone... which is understandable. But the families of Li Chenghao and Li Chengpan didn't even send greetings... There are almost no guests of any real weight from the main lineage.'

Li Xixuan watched grimly. He wasn’t particularly surprised, but any lingering shred of hope vanished. He had come from the bright, clamorous outer courtyard only to find the inner main hall pitch-black. A few children crouched in the corner. Li Xixuan raised his pale, plump hand and ordered softly:

"Get the third son back here!"

Before long, Li Chengzai, still in his colorful kerchief, entered the courtyard sullenly. Facing his father's dark expression, he tried to reason with him:

"...I already asked. Cheng was sent to the Milin Mountains by the old master, and Chengpan is busy near Zhouluo. It's reasonable they couldn't come. Father, why must you look so grim? It makes everyone uncomfortable."

Li Xixuan shot him a look and snapped:

"What do you understand? Although I never cultivated and couldn't recognize what kind of fire that was in the sky that day, several cultivators said the First Young Master, Li Jiangqian, broke through and exited seclusion... Li Zhouluo is amiable, but *he* certainly might not be!"

Li Chengzai frowned. He looked at his father and said:

"Our Eastern Residence is in the tightest spot, so we had to take the lead this time... We were the bird that stuck its neck out. Those above us compromised, everyone divided the benefits, and then they scattered like the wind, leaving the bird that stuck its neck out to be slaughtered... Now, one by one, they wouldn't dare show up."

Li Chengzai had grown up in the residence depending on his father for everything. Hearing this, he panicked. "Ah? What logic is that? We all went to Qingdu together, and we all received the boons. How can they abandon us now? If they do this, who will dare to step up in the future?"

Li Xixuan replied, "You make it sound easy. When those above want to suppress you, they have countless excuses. They'll always find a pretext that satisfies both sides, and then they'll grab us to make an example. It's always the leader who gets beaten. If we don't plan, we are doomed."

Li Chengzai nodded repeatedly. Li Xixuan’s brow remained tightly furrowed. "Before, we had some sway because the clansmen all wanted those boons and sided with us. Now that the boons have been handed out, we're a phoenix that's lost its feathers—worth nothing. Fortunately, I planned ahead... The merit and prestige of the children are genuine, not inflated."

"You children shouldn't make any moves regarding this. Just be honest and keep your heads down. You can't fight any of them. Your only hope is to rely on Minggong's reputation and stay low-key. I will go to the main hall later to apologize. Let everything fall on me, this old man. At worst, I'll suffer a little. Even in the most extreme case, my life won't be in danger."

Li Chengzai hesitated. "But every family is celebrating right now. For Father to go up the mountain... it seems inappropriate. It makes us lose face. Besides, why must we act as if we've done something wrong? The boons we received... compared to the other families, they were the absolute minimum..."

Li Xixuan's face hardened. "How is it inappropriate? Right now, Li Zhouluo is still in charge, and Li Jiangqian has only just emerged. If we don't approach him now, when should we? Wait until Li Jiangqian has his knife at our throats? If Li Zhouluo gives even a slight concession now, it will tie Li Jiangqian's hands regarding us in the future!"

"Oh..." Li Chengzai replied, half-convinced, half-doubting. "The First Young Master... intends to re-enter the island's affairs?"

Li Xixuan laughed in exasperation. This time, he didn't bother responding. He just shook his head and stormed out with a flick of his sleeves.

The front courtyard was full of guests, so he had to cross the threshold of the back courtyard and leave through the rear gate. The early morning mist was still chilly. Li Xixuan pulled his sleeves tighter, his pale, plump face looking listless.

'I fight for this, I fight for that, and in the end, no one is grateful. Boons for this one, boons for that one, but how many of them will actually amount to anything? In the entire Eastern Residence, only Minggong cultivates the path of immortality. This old man is counting his remaining days; I can only help them this much...'

Li Xixuan was the most desperate among the clan elders, precisely because his Yuanwan branch had far too few cultivators.

They were all descendants of Li Xuanxuan, but the other branch—the Yuandu Western Residence led by Li Cheng—had Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang, followed by Li Xinghan and Li Xingsai. Further down, they even had Li Queyi, who was associated with Purple Smoke. As long as a branch had cultivators, they could separate the family holdings without fear of being relegated to the fringes of the island.

The Western Residence had already split into several branches, and their leaders, the Li Zhoufang brothers, were cultivators themselves. Whether it was fighting for boons or finding positions outside, everything was much easier for them. Every clansman they arranged an external post for represented a new path for the future. The more they arranged, the easier things became. How could they compare to him, Li Xixuan, struggling all alone to find a future for his children and grandchildren?

It was bad enough that his descendants couldn't cultivate, but their minds weren't even sharp. How could Li Xixuan not be dismayed!

He huddled into his robes against the cold morning wind, chilled to the bone. His steps felt unsteady. Though the streets were filled with the sound of music, his heart was desolate.

The road from the Eastern Residence to the main hall wasn't long, but the hall sat on high ground. For a mortal, it was a journey guaranteed to leave one soaked in sweat. Li Xixuan usually traveled by sedan chair, but since he was sneaking out today, he had no such luxury. He had to wait by the roadside for a while and hail a carriage.

There were many coachmen and messengers on the island, but these were undignified jobs. Unless they had no other choice, members of the direct line were unwilling to do them. Most of these workers were the family or servants of cultivators who had been promoted onto the island or supplemented the main lineage, trying to subsidize their households.

He climbed into the small carriage, finally feeling some warmth. He drifted in and out of sleep as the carriage rocked along. After an unknown amount of time, the air grew hot and stuffy. He heard a shout from outside:

"Master! We've arrived!"

Li Xixuan lifted the curtain and saw the towering profile of the grand palace. He began to climb out. He was old, and his back and legs were stiff. He stretched out a foot, struggling to reach the ground, when he suddenly felt a cool touch at his waist. A pair of pale hands supported his back, helping him descend smoothly.

He steadied himself on the ground and let out a long breath. Raising his gaze, the first thing he saw was a pair of black boots, devoid of any decoration.

Above them, a crimson robe edged in gold fluttered lightly in the wind. Lifting his eyes slightly higher, he saw a pale face with long eyebrows.

Beneath those dark brows was a pair of golden eyes, watching him with a smile.

Li Xixuan's breath caught, and his heart clenched.

"First Young Master?"

Li Jiangqian was tall and lean, towering over the old man. Apricot-yellow flames still burned in his black hair, glowing faintly. He steadied Li Xixuan, then warmly grasped the elder's plump hand in his own and smiled.

"What a coincidence, meeting you here, Elder... Are you here to...?"

Li Xixuan felt a chill creep into his heart under that gaze. He had forgone a sedan and snuck out the side gate precisely to catch everyone in the hall off guard. How could he possibly tell Li Jiangqian the truth? He forced his expression to remain pleasant. "The matter of the boons has been announced. I came to pay my respects to the Patriarch and thank him for his grace..."

"Oh!" Li Jiangqian began walking toward the hall with him, shaking his head with a smile. "Elder, you are too polite. Though I have cultivated for some years, this is a skill I must learn from you! I was just thinking that during the evaluation, these clansmen were all impeccably behaved, but the moment they received their boons, they would surely go off and indulge themselves... But seeing you, Elder, I see true consistency in word and deed. The people of the Eastern Residence are truly fortunate to have you teaching them. Am I wrong?"

Li Jiangqian's words were always pleasant, but Li Xixuan had no idea what medicine he was selling from his gourd. The elder's scalp tingled. He just wanted to get to the hall, and his pace quickened. The doors were just ahead. He replied:

"Correct..."

Li Jiangqian nodded with a smile. "This junior was considering this very point. I discussed it with the Patriarch just this morning. These clansmen who receive boons... they must be watched more closely. If anyone in their branch, old or young, makes a mistake, the boon must first be suspended, pending review and reconsideration. This will also prevent people from slipping through muddy waters!"

"Ah..." Li Xixuan froze, as if struck by lightning. He stood stunned for a full second, nearly stopping in his tracks.

What had Li Xixuan come here to do? To apologize! With that one statement from Li Jiangqian, the moment he uttered his apology, his entire family's boons would be lost!

He stood dumbstruck for several breaths, his mind racing to formulate a response. He finally managed, "That... seems overly harsh. After all, which family doesn't have old and young? Surely..."

Li Jiangqian sighed, shaking his head and cutting him off. "Elder, your heart is too soft! How is this harsh? The Eastern Residence certainly won't make such mistakes... You needn't worry on behalf of the other branches... Oh... Dili Guang is here. Elder, please!"

Li Jiangqian timed it perfectly, interrupting him just as they reached the hall doors. Before Li Xixuan could respond, Li Jiangqian bowed, dissolved into an apricot-yellow light, and ascended into the sky. Li Xixuan was caught completely off guard as Dili Guang stepped forward to greet him respectfully.

"Elder, the Patriarch is currently receiving cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate. Is there an urgent matter?"

Li Xixuan exhaled deeply, twice. He gave a slight bow with clasped hands and retreated without a word. As he walked down the steps, the old man realized something was wrong and began to think.

'Could such a major decision really be finalized just like that? There wasn't the slightest rumor about it on the island. I was bluffed by that brat!'

He started to turn back, then stopped, afraid. "No... no... Since he said that... how can I possibly go up and apologize now? He's an expert at twisting black into white and white into black. If I go now, he'll spin it as me voluntarily apologizing and sacrificing my descendants' boons to uphold the clan's discipline. I'd be hated to death..."

Li Xixuan's limbs felt cold, and he trembled for a moment. 'There's no solution... no solution. If Minggong doesn't come out of seclusion, the only way to avoid being tormented to death by this kid... is to beg the Old Master!'

***

... Outside the hall was a cacophony, but inside Li Zhouluo’s inner sanctum, it was quiet. Cui Jueyin stood in the center of the hall, turned slightly to the side, hands clasped. He addressed the man seated above:

"Patriarch, this is Fairy Wei... and this is Daoist Cao."

"Greetings, Patriarch." The two bowed slightly. Li Zhouluo immediately replied, "Greetings, esteemed Immortals."

The replacement sent by the Purple Smoke Gate was Tinglan’s confidante, Wei Danying. She wore a yellow feathered robe and looked somewhat awkward. Daoist Cao, meanwhile, was burly, his face covered by a black beard. He held the hand of a small, thin child who looked to be about eight or nine years old.

They were clearly here to deal with Daoist Cao's affair. Cao Chu himself seemed perfectly at ease. Judging by his appearance, he was a straightforward sort. His clenched fists were the size of vinegar bowls. Profound Light flowed over his robes. Ding Mu's thin hand could only grasp one of his fingers. Cao Chu’s voice was deep:

"I am extremely fond of this child. I must trouble the Lake to part with him."

Who exactly he was "extremely fond of" was something everyone present understood clearly. Wei Danying hesitated before speaking.

"Fellow Daoist Cao Chu's situation... I trust the Patriarch is already aware. Since he has expressed the intent to take an apprentice, according to the rules of Purple Smoke, I must come forward and ask the Patriarch... We intend to bring his family along as well."

Wei Danying was clearly not well-acquainted with Cao Chu. The female cultivator knew the matter wasn't exactly respectable, so she phrased the request vaguely. Li Zhouluo couldn't let her lose face. He nodded.

"To be accepted into the mountain gate of Purple Smoke is this child's good fortune. The Lake will provide an additional share of his future cultivation resources. His family may certainly go with him. Please rest assured."

"Excellent!" Cao Chu looked pleased. He clasped his hands, bowed, and broke into a grin. He had a booming voice, and the single word was deafening. Wei Danying looked utterly mortified. She quickly said:

"Fellow Daoist Cao, perhaps you should head down first..."

Cao Chu made no fuss. He gave another cheerful bow and left briskly. The frail Ding Mu hadn't uttered a single sound, forced to take two steps for every one of the man holding his hand, looking as dry as a wooden puppet, yet there was a smile on his face.

Li Zhouluo watched the master and apprentice depart, frowning slightly. Wei Danying breathed a sigh of relief and looked up with a smile.

"This matter has troubled the Patriarch... Cao Chu is rather unreliable within the sect. On normal days, the cultivators on his peak won't even visit him. Fortunately, he only amuses himself with his wives and concubines; his character is otherwise passable..."

Li Zhouluo had seen the glow of Cao Chu's spiritual qi earlier and felt equally awkward.

'How is it that this Cao Chu cultivates Bright Yang... Oh. Actually... it's perfectly fitting that he cultivates Bright Yang...'

The two tacitly skipped the topic. Wei Danying's expression dimmed.

"These past few years, Changxiao and Hengzhu have been fighting fiercely in the Light Boat Sea region. The Changxiao Gate has suffered heavy losses. This should have been good news; my Purple Smoke doesn't have much influence overseas, so it was a good chance to stretch our legs."

"But something happened in the Eastern Sea, and Wen Wu had to be reassigned. This... is very bad. The earth veins in my Purple Smoke Gate's ocean territory have shifted violently. Earth fire and magma have leaked out. It is said the blaze is so bright it can be seen a thousand li away..."

"All the dragon-kin in the sea have fled to the surface. I hear the seafloor is overrun with Baleful Fire Qi, causing utter devastation. Many, many mortals and Demons have died."

The Purple Smoke Gate's strength overseas was inferior to both Changxiao and the Hengzhu Gate. They had invested considerable effort abroad these past years. Seeing Wei Danying's expression, the damage this time must have been significant. After all, the earth veins and fire veins had shifted simultaneously, and since it was in the sea, the water veins were likely affected too. A change in all three would cause catastrophic damage to arrays and structures.

Li Zhouluo’s expression turned grave. He asked in a low voice, "Has the cause been identified...?"

Wei Danying looked frustrated. "It was either a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with extremely profound cultivation in the Dao of Earth Virtue, or it was truly a natural shift in the earth veins—a calamity from nowhere. In any case... not only have the sect's Daoist Masters already gone, but many other cultivators are also being stationed in the Eastern Sea..."

"With so many cultivators mobilized, we will inevitably be short-staffed here with your noble clan. If our progress slows, please do not take offense."

Li Zhouluo nodded grimly, showing he understood. As expected, the Purple Smoke Gate had a reason for telling him this. His own clan's array was not urgent. He said softly:

"It is no matter. It is best that Purple Smoke attends to its own affairs first."

Wei Danying then took her leave. Li Zhouluo escorted her from the hall. She headed north, and Li Zhouluo, observing her route, deduced that Wei Danying was, in all likelihood, heading for the Xuanmiao Temple.

'Daoist Master Sumian follows the Treasured Earth lineage. As an Earth Virtue cultivator, he is an expert on earth veins. It seems she is going to request his help.'



# Chapter 807: Murder

Dawn was just breaking, but the great hall was brightly lit. Li Zhouluo placed several stacks of scrolls onto the desk and let out a breath of relief. The lamplight cast a sallow hue on his face as he turned and said:

“The clan’s records from the past few years, detailing all matters large and small, are recorded within. Li Jiangqian, you only need to read through them.”

Li Jiangqian, still dressed in his crimson robes, nodded at his words. He picked up the topmost volume, his expression thoughtful as he began to read. Li Zhouluo shook his head and said:

“I haven’t done a very good job these past few years. If there are any omissions or errors, I must ask you to correct them, Li Jiangqian. I apologize for the trouble…”

“Uncle, how could you say such a thing!” Li Jiangqian replied with a smile, shaking his head. “Fourth Uncle, you are kind-hearted and deeply care for the clan. How could there be any failings? These records show only benevolent governance. The policies you proposed are excellent; this nephew must study them carefully.”

Li Zhouluo merely sighed again and shook his head. He unfastened the black robe he wore, placed it into his storage bag, and replied:

“You must stop flattering me. I am also on the verge of breaking through to the ninth level of Qi Refining. This timing is perfect; I will take this opportunity to enter seclusion.”

He quickly departed. Li Jiangqian settled himself firmly back into the main seat, raised an eyebrow toward Dili Guang standing nearby, and asked:

“Are all the young masters on their way?”

Dili Guang nodded, responding respectfully, “Reporting to the Patriarch, Young Master Li Jianglong and Young Master Jiangxia entered seclusion three months ago and six months ago, respectively. The message has been sent, but it is unlikely they will receive it in time.”

Li Jiangqian gave a short laugh and replied, “It doesn't matter. Funan and the East Shore have always been managed by my two younger brothers, and everything is in perfect order. There is no need for them to make the trip. What about Jiangliang and Jiangnian?”

Dili Guang quickly replied: “The Fourth Young Master has been studying under Lord Cui Jueyin. Coincidentally, his lordship has been on the island these past few days, so the Fourth Young Master is already waiting in the side hall. The youngest master, Jiangnian, has also been cultivating on the island recently and is waiting as well.”

“Send them in.”

He gave the order and lowered his head again, returning his focus to the records. Scarcely ten breaths passed before the light clinking of metal sounded from the hall's entrance. A young master strode in, a sword cradled in his arm. His golden pupils scanned the room, and he called out in a bright voice:

“Big Brother!”

This was indeed his fourth brother, Li Jiangliang. He was fifteen now, his expressions vivid. He looked very similar to Li Jiangqian, though he appeared sunnier and more approachable. He spoke with enthusiasm:

“Congratulations, Big Brother! I went to your residence to pay my respects a few days ago, but your movements were unpredictable, and I wasn't able to see you. Truly, congratulations!”

Li Jiangliang was heartfelt, and Li Jiangqian naturally wouldn't rebuff him. He returned the greeting with a smile, saying:

“I was preoccupied with affairs these past few days and had no leisure. But the moment I was free, did I not send for you, Fourth Brother?”

The two exchanged a few more pleasantries before Li Jiangqian’s gaze shifted to the youngest brother, Li Jiangnian, who stood last in line.

All four of Li Zhouwei’s sons were tall. Even Li Jianglong, the plainest in appearance, possessed a fine build by any normal standard. Yet the Li Jiangnian standing before him now was short, almost stunted and thin.

What made Li Jiangqian frown, however, was the young man’s face.

The members of the Li clan were generally known for their good looks, especially those descending from Li Tongya’s line. Li Xijun had been a famously handsome man in his day, and Li Qinghong was a stunning beauty. Even Li Zhouwei, having managed the clan for so many years, had attracted the devotion of numerous female cultivators in the region. And Li Jiangliang, standing right in front of him, possessed a first-class bearing.

Yet Li Jiangnian had sharp, protruding lips and hollow cheeks. His eyes were both squinted and swollen. Worse, several warts dotted the side of his face, a few coarse hairs sprouting from them. It wasn't just that his appearance was unsightly; his entire demeanor was timid and cowering. He was not merely ungraceful—he was actively repulsive to look at.

'Failing to inherit Father’s golden pupils is one thing… but to look this wretched!'

His brow furrowed deeply. Compared to the natural charisma his other brothers possessed, this youngest one seemed to have an innate quality that repelled others. Li Jiangqian watched him in silence, finding the contrast hard to believe.

'Is he truly… Father’s biological son?!'

He couldn't even bring himself to speak, instead walking down from the main seat to observe him more closely. He asked, doubtfully, “You are already a cultivator about to enter Qi Refining… how can you still have such growths…”

Li Jiangqian was naturally referring to the warts on his face. The awkward Li Jiangnian, however, seemed accustomed to the question and answered meekly:

“I was born this way. Lord Cui already examined them. He said that as my cultivation base increases, they will naturally fade away, so there is no need to intervene.”

Li Jiangqian could only step back. His original intention to test his two younger brothers had evaporated. He returned to the main seat, averted his gaze from Jiangnian, and replied:

“Jiangnian, you are about to begin Qi Refining. Are you here to receive the Courtly Red Dust Qi? I will give you an order token; you may go to the dense forest and retrieve it yourself.”

Li Jiangnian nodded hastily, accepted the token Li Jiangqian handed him, and departed joyfully.

As he pushed the door open and left, both remaining brothers in the hall breathed a sigh of relief. Li Jiangqian let out a heavy breath, unsure what to even say, and simply rubbed the space between his brows.

Li Jiangliang lowered his head slightly and murmured, “For the past few years, our youngest brother has rarely left seclusion. Unless absolutely necessary, he eats and sleeps entirely within his immortal’s abode. He only came tonight because he was forced to retrieve the spiritual qi.”

“It’s better that he stays hidden.” Li Jiangqian sighed. “In this world, no matter where you go, your face is unavoidable. If you are born handsome, others treat you well at a glance. If you are born ugly, you invite insults just by walking down the road. As for using a Dharma Art to conceal it, he would inevitably be suspected of hiding his true identity and harboring ill intentions. At worst, we will just have him wear a mask to cover his features. He still won’t escape the stares, but at least it will be tolerable to look at.”

Li Jiangliang nodded repeatedly. Li Jiangqian spared him a glance, recognizing that his fourth brother didn't genuinely care whether Jiangnian wore a mask or not. He smiled and changed the subject:

“I heard Uncle Zhouluo mention that you consumed that portion of the Bright Parting Blazing Essence from many years ago. That means you follow the same dao lineage as I, cultivating the Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun. You should come to me often for guidance in the future.”

“Many thanks, Big Brother!”

Li Jiangliang cupped his hands and departed. Li Jiangqian rose to his feet, dipped a brush in the inkstone on his desk, and inscribed several characters. He then withdrew a stack of small letters from his sleeve, glanced at Dili Guang, and commanded:

“Go and summon the people from Qingdu and the Jade Court Guard.”

He raised his eyebrows, a smile playing on his lips. “Don't worry about making a commotion. In fact, the bigger the commotion, the better. I want the entire island to hear this clearly!”

Dili Guang understood the intent. He nodded and withdrew. As predicted, the great hall was suddenly filled with the sound of countless footsteps. Soldiers in white armor streamed in from both side halls, sealing every exit. For a moment, the hall was filled with flickering shadows and the noisy din of clashing weapons and scraping armor.

*Clang!*

Li Jiangqian remained seated on the main throne. Chen Yang, clad head-to-toe in black armor, strode quickly in from a side door and offered a cupped-fist salute.

“Reporting to the Patriarch. Li Xixuan is indeed at Mount Qingdu. He is in the Old Lord’s courtyard, begging bitterly. He has already been kneeling for an hour.”

“Only an hour!” Li Jiangqian smiled, savoring the moment. “He is a mortal, after all. The boat ride to Qingdu takes quite some time. It’s a good thing I waited for him until the middle of the night.”

He withdrew an order token, smiling. “Dili Guang has already gone to summon the Qingdu forces. Take your own people. The very instant the Qingdu forces leave the mountain, you are to lock down Qingdu completely. Allow no one to enter or leave.”

“Make the commotion as large as possible. Just say… that I have found grounds for accusation, and now, I intend to kill someone!”



# Chapter 808: Merit Shelters and Dao Stipends

Li Jiangqian dispatched his men and waited in the main hall. Soon, a clamor arose outside, and a procession of figures quickly reached the entrance. They hesitated, shoving each other forward, but no one dared to enter.

With a creak...

Finally, Chen Donghe and An Siwei led the way into the Jade Court. Each was followed by three individuals holding real power within the Qingdu Jade Court. They bowed first. Li Jiangqian was quite respectful toward these two. He sat up straight and said:

"Elders, please come in first."

The hall doors swung shut, leaving only the two of them standing inside. Li Jiangqian pointed to the stacks of letters on his desk and said:

"There are twenty-two candidates for the clan's legacy shelter selection. Uncle Zhouluo granted each of them three types of protection: they can remain on the island, receive an official post along the periphery, and are given an annual stipend.

"Their every major and minor action over the last three years is documented here. Suspicions, evidence, reports suppressed by Uncle Zhouluo, and past stains found in the archives—all marked in vermilion.

"I need the two divisions to cooperate. Qingdu's forces are not to move. The Jade Court's men will go directly to 'invite' these people. Bring those invited to the hall and lock them in separate rooms. There is no need for interrogation and no need for torture."

Chen Donghe looked like he wanted to speak but stopped himself. An Siwei, however, bowed and offered a reminder:

"Patriarch, the clan has been relatively honest these past three years. Those chosen for the shelter selection are generally those without discernible faults. Even if some offenses were intentional, there's no handle for us to grasp. If we settle scores based on the distant past, I fear it will stir resentment."

"It doesn't matter."

Li Jiangqian smiled. "I only need you two elders to keep everyone under watch. We just need to tighten the atmosphere."

The two nodded in understanding. Li Jiangqian walked down from his seat and personally opened the main doors for them. As the doors swung open, the crowd of whispering figures kneeling outside immediately fell silent. Li Jiangqian smiled.

"One more thing. Please have the Qingdu Jade Court pass this message to all branches: If any sheltered family commits crimes or acts against Qingdu, when one person offends, the entire household will be implicated. Their shelter privileges will be reduced accordingly."

The crowd dispersed in an orderly fashion. Soon, people were being brought up the mountain one by one. Li Jiangqian waited a while before he saw a man in a patterned turban being dragged up the path. This was whom he had been waiting for. The smile vanished from Li Jiangqian's face, replaced by an icy glare.

Li Chengza's heart turned cold as ice.

The Jade Court Guard had shown up at his door in the dead of night, speaking of 'one person offending, the entire household implicated.' Li Chengza’s heart had skipped a beat.

What had his old man gone to do? Confess!

Li Xixuan had rushed back, diverting midway to Qingdu to plead for mercy. But Li Chengza didn't know this. He only knew his father had gone to plead his case and had not returned, though it was now the middle of the night. Earlier, he had been sitting worriedly with his brothers, speculating about where their father might be facing punishment...

Now, having been glared at like that by Li Jiangqian, he was terrified.

'Father always said the First Young Master was ruthless. This whole maneuver... he's going to strip my family of our shelter privileges. All five slots will be gone... He truly is a master strategist. Father walked right into his trap!'

He was dragged into a side courtyard and locked inside. The heavy door shut, plunging the room into darkness. A formation activated, sealing the courtyard off from the outside world, making communication impossible. His heart filled with despair. When a servant from the main hall came to offer tea, he didn't react at all.

"Sir, please..."

He turned his head slightly. Suddenly, he found the servant familiar. He paused, then asked:

"Are you from the Ren family?"

Li Xixuan's primary wife was from the Ren family, making the East Residence very close to them. He quickly grabbed the servant's hand, his rarely used mind spinning furiously. He stammered:

"Get a message... to the East Residence... tell them to split the family assets. Immediately! Save whatever can be saved..."

The Ren family servant glanced at him and replied:

"You overestimate me, Young Master. I am just a lowly servant; how could I have such influence? Besides, the moment you were taken away, the East Residence already split the family assets!"

Li Chengza went limp. He sat stunned for a long time before finally uttering a single word:

"Good."

While Li Chengza agonized inside, the outside was quiet, broken only by the sound of hurried footsteps. Moonlight flowed like water. Li Jiangqian stood at the hall entrance as Chen Yang bowed slightly and reported in a low voice:

"Patriarch, Lord Xixuan is still in the Qingdu courtyard. The East Residence has already frantically divided its assets. The west branch had already split, so there wasn't much movement there, save for two sub-branches that further divided..."

"That's enough."

Li Jiangqian said casually:

"By the time Clan Elder Xixuan comes down the mountain, he will have already lost his East Residence. His fractured descendants will blame him. The senior elders say resentment shouldn't be aimed at brothers or the main clan. Placing the blame squarely on our Clan Elder Xixuan is perfect."

He scoffed.

"When parents fail in their duties, the siblings unite against a common foe. Doesn't that make them more unified? It won't harm their relationships, and they certainly can't blame the clan... It was Li Xixuan who confessed his guilt first. Only then did I, Li Jiangqian, send men to arrest people. Now, the East Residence has exposed itself without any need for interrogation. The reason for all these arrests... everyone understands it now!"

Even Chen Yang felt a chill run down his spine. He paused for a moment before cupping his hands.

"I only fear he won't cooperate... Clan Elder Xixuan... understands the situation better than anyone. If he spreads the truth everywhere..."

"I am not afraid of him refusing to cooperate."

Li Jiangqian flicked his sleeves and strode back into the hall, clasping his hands behind his back. He laughed.

"A parent's love for their child requires planning for the distant future. What good does exposing the truth do the East Residence? It will only invite me to fracture and dismantle them time and time again. He is old. He doesn't dare openly oppose me now that I hold the power."

"Moreover..."

He reached the head seat, picked up his brush, and added:

"Is there any difference between pleading for mercy and admitting guilt? If he wasn't guilty, why would he need to plead?"

Li Jiangqian glanced at Chen Yang and continued,

"Go and fetch Cui Jueyin."

Chen Yang swept away like the wind. Cui Jueyin entered the hall shortly after, having clearly been waiting nearby for some time. Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"The matter we discussed these past two months, Lord Cui... has it come to fruition?"

Cui Jueyin bowed slightly and said respectfully:

"As instructed by the Patriarch, I have selected three foundational Daoist manuals from my family's collection of 667 Daoist scriptures. They are: the 'White Han Compilation' from the *Six Chapters on Seeking Immortality*; the 'Methods of Questioning Scaled Beasts' general record; and the 'Principles of Spiritual Talismans' general outline."

"The selected portions of these three paths have been redacted, expanded, and supplemented using several other traditions. They are now named the 'White Han,' the 'Questioning Methods,' and the 'Spiritual Talismans' volumes."

He presented three volumes with both hands. Their covers were white, gold, and purple respectively, etched with patterns that gave them a transcendent aura. Li Jiangqian accepted them, flipped through them twice, and nodded.

"I've troubled you, Senior."

Cui Jueyin stood aside. Li Jiangqian turned to Chen Yang, who was waiting below.

"Bring the clan members from the side courtyards."

Before long, the detainees filed in, one after another. They stood assembled below the platform, heads bowed in terror. Li Jiangqian smiled.

"First, congratulations are in order. Clan Elder Xixuan righteously came to the mountain to accept responsibility for his faults. The clan initiated an investigation. Fortunately, Uncle Zhouluo has a sharp eye, and his shelter selections were extremely accurate. Although there were some suspicious points, they have now all been clarified. The shelter selections stand."

The crowd below breathed a collective sigh of relief. They exchanged furtive glances, many of them looking toward Li Chengza.

Li Chengza was now certain his father had merely gone to confess. Thankfully, nothing concrete was found, otherwise his own household would have been despised. He celebrated silently as Li Jiangqian continued:

"I have called you all here today to discuss a truly important matter. I intend to open a new door of opportunity within the clan. Using Milin Mountain as the primary location, we will establish three paths of learning: 'White Han,' 'Questioning Methods,' and 'Spiritual Talismans.' These will be available for study by clan members on the island who cannot cultivate, allowing them to contribute their meager strength to the clan."

The crowd below looked up, confused, staring at the platform. Li Jiangqian smiled.

"In the future, the path of shelter selection will continue, but it will be reserved only for the descendants of cultivators who sacrificed themselves for the clan, and it will only shelter the single generation that possesses a spiritual aptitude. If their descendants lack this aptitude, their portion of the cultivator's assets will be temporarily recorded by the lake, waiting for a future descendant with aptitude to be born. This we will call a 'Merit Shelter.'

"As for the path of studying the Daoist scriptures: every five years, during the sacrificial rites, Milin Mountain will hold an examination. Those who demonstrate attainment in any of the three paths and pass a character assessment will be granted a 'Merit Stipend' position in the clan. Not only will they be permitted to reside on the main island, they will also receive rewards and a salary. This we will call a 'Dao Stipend.'"

The hall fell silent. Cui Jueyin, clearly prepared, retrieved several completed golden scrolls from his sleeve and passed them down to Chen Donghe and An Siwei.

Everyone knew the Li family's shelter selection was hardly ironclad. If one lacked ability, an appointed position could just as easily be revoked, and the rewards and residency rights lasted only one generation. If this Dao Stipend path was viable, wouldn't it be even better than the shelter selection?

Eyebrows raised in anticipation. Li Jiangqian continued:

"This path has three ranks of positions. The clan will also establish academies in the various prefectures, and graduates may even be dispatched off-island... Now, representatives from every branch, come forward and copy the scriptures."

He leaned back in his high seat. Below, the heated gazes of the crowd followed the three books. There were even a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators present; only with them leading the way did the others obediently form a queue to copy the texts. Li Jiangqian's gaze drifted over the ecstatic faces.

'I can never allow them to easily attain positions of authority... Only by channeling their energy into the endless annotations of these Daoist scriptures, forcing them to spend their lives poring over the texts until their hair turns white, will they have no ambition left to study other matters. Only then can they slowly climb this new power structure, one that is completely isolated from the sixteen prefectures, the two peaks, and the mountain. This is the only way to prevent future trouble...'

He maintained his smile. As the copying finished, amidst the cacophony of voices crying out gratitude for the Patriarch's immense grace, he looked up slightly.

'Besides, it's not without its benefits... Reading these scriptures extensively will also serve to educate their descendants... Children with spiritual aptitude will use these three books for their enlightenment. It might even aid their future cultivation.'

"This is the law of Merit Shelters and Dao Stipends!"

...

Night deepened. Stars glittered in the sky, and the vast sea was calm, unbroken by waves. Gulls and eagles soared. A few cries echoed from the distant horizon, fading quickly from hearing.

A cool breeze rustled the maple forest. White jade lotus lamps floated on the stream, while the cyan jade platform glowed with a pure, bright light. A cultivator in white-gold Daoist robes opened his eyes. Profound Light flashed into existence, and a purple fire flared before dissipating, illuminating the woods for an instant.

Li Ximing had spent this recent period cultivating in the forest. The injuries to his dharma body had fully healed. This cultivation abode, cleared for him by the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain, was clearly exceptional; its spiritual energy was comparable to that of Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Uniquely, white jade lotus lamps drifted down the stream, lit within by some sort of spiritual item aspected to Valley Water that aided healing. The fragrance was rich. Although it had little effect on injuries at Li Ximing's Purple Mansion Realm level, the thought behind it was clear.

'My progress on the "Audience with the Celestial Gate" divine ability hasn't been great. Although I walked the line between life and death, and my Dao insight improved slightly, my cultivation base stagnated while I was healing...'

Refining a divine ability was a slow, grinding process. Li Ximing estimated it would take him another thirty-odd years to perfect Audience with the Celestial Gate. He calculated inwardly:

"By Jiangnan standards, my cultivation talent isn't actually slow. Perfecting this in thirty-plus years means I can immediately connect it to the *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass*. Without needing a transitional technique, I can spend another ten-odd years forging the Dao foundation, and then I can begin refining 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread.'

"I haven't seen any records regarding the time it takes to break through to the second divine ability; it must depend heavily on personal talent. Lacking the experience, it's hard to estimate. Let's budget ten years. That means achieving 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' in sixty years. If everything goes smoothly, I can condense the third divine ability in one hundred twenty years, break through to the mid-stage, and face the Purple Mystery Threshold."

The Purple Mystery Threshold was notoriously difficult, so Li Ximing couldn't estimate beyond it. Once he had three divine abilities, he would be considered a core powerhouse among Jiangnan's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Li Zhouwei wouldn't be much slower than him. At that point, even if they faced Changxiao, they wouldn't be completely outmatched.

"The only difficulty is surviving these next one hundred twenty years while being targeted by Changxiao. That is no easy task."

Li Ximing's situation was awkward. If he returned to Jiangnan, he had no confidence he could face Changxiao's overt attacks and hidden schemes. But if he remained overseas, his family wasn't safe either.

"Although Zhouwei took a huge risk and eliminated Situ Mo, ending our family's century-long affliction and removing a critical blade pointed at us, once Changxiao returns to Jiangnan and begins to scheme... even if he can't find another operative like Situ Mo, there will certainly be no shortage of borrowed blades..."

He felt a pang of frustration. Suddenly, the wind chimes in the maple trees tinkled. Xia Shouyu, dressed in white, emerged from the woods. She bowed slightly and spoke with great respect:

"Reporting to the Daoist Master: the two Daoist Masters have sent word. They say the matter discussed previously is ready, and we can set out."

Xia Shouyu had spent the better part of the last year on Nine Mounds, and her life wasn't just comfortable; it was luxurious compared to her entire life before. Never mind the density of spiritual energy in her dwelling; even the most desolate spot on a mountain path here had spiritual energy several times thicker than at Qingxu Temple.

Living this well, the woman positively glowed. Adorned with a few magical artifact accessories, she appeared even more beautiful. Her naturally thin eyebrows, which gave her a slightly severe look, were now offset by a pendant worn on her brow. Xia Shouyu had always known how to carry herself; now, she truly looked like a direct disciple from a major Purple Mansion Realm sect.

Li Ximing wasn't a cruel person and didn't find her appearance excessive. Seeing the once-rustic woman transform like this merely made him nod with a smile. He rose, tucking his hands into his sleeves as a thought occurred to him:

'I can use this opportunity... I should ask Houfu to take her to the lake. It's both safe and convenient, and it sends a subtle message of deterrence... Zhouming isn't getting any younger, yet he drifts aimlessly day after day. He's probably still frequenting some pleasure barge. That won't do.'

Thus, as he walked out, he asked:

"Lingdu is a generous elder. I hear that while your status on the immortal mountain is that of a guest, your actual treatment is akin to an outer disciple, with several scripture repositories open to you... is that correct?"

Xia Shouyu immediately panicked, rushing to say:

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, yes, that is true! But the artifacts and clothes this junior wears were all exchanged using the cultivation resources the Daoist Master granted me. I have not taken a single thing from the Nine Mounds tradition..."

Xia Shouyu had a meticulous mind and had already thought several steps ahead. But Li Ximing wasn't concerned about that. He nodded slightly.

"You've done well. I will find an opportunity to secure a better background for you, but you must be worthy of it. Since the scripture repositories are open to you, spend these next days reading more."

Xia Shouyu was both shocked and overjoyed. Although her talent, appearance, and intellect were second to none, her lowly birth was a constant source of hidden insecurity. Tears welled in her eyes.

"The Daoist Master's grace is like a second life! Even if I am crushed to dust, I cannot repay it!"

Li Ximing walked ahead, hands clasped behind his back, nodding slightly.

"Use these days to read. Otherwise, when opportunity is handed to you, you won't be able to hold it steady. If you are exposed later and regret it then, it will be far too late."

Xia Shouyu nodded repeatedly. The two arrived beneath the large maple tree where the discussion had been held earlier. Houfu, dressed in shamanic robes, and the elderly Lingdu were conferring in low voices. Seeing Li Ximing approach, Lingdu rose to his feet and said in an aged voice:

"Greetings, Daoist Friend Zhaojing. Time is short. Please, let us depart together."

Li Ximing nodded. Houfu merely offered a greeting and fell silent again. The three of them pierced the Great Void, and infinite blackness enveloped them. Only then did Lingdu speak softly:

"Daoist Friend Houfu and I have been setting this up for days. We wanted to be thorough and minimize the disturbance, which is why we delayed. However, we received news the day before yesterday. The Merciful One who went to the Buddhist Land to report has already walked the mountain of blades and sea of fire. He completed his punishment but was not demoted. Instead, he has returned under orders to continue the investigation. We had no choice but to hastily ask you to come."

Li Ximing shook his head.

"What can he possibly find? Anything that could be divined should have been divined long ago. If any traces had been found, they would have already pursued them. He wouldn't have needed to go to Buddhist Land to accept punishment in the first place."

He said this, but Li Ximing still felt a little apprehensive.

'This is a huge operation. I just hope that fellow doesn't come back bearing a grudge and pin everything on me... We need to finish this as quickly as possible.'

Lingdu seemed to share this sentiment. He didn't travel directly through the Great Void. Instead, he detoured to the Mortal Sea, utilizing its extremely fast transit properties to quickly arrive north of the Peacock Sea. He then retrieved a lotus flower from his sleeve.

The flower was a lovely pink, no bigger than his palm. On an adjacent stalk hung an old seed pod. Li Ximing stood beside him and could see clearly that the pod had exactly five neat holes.

Lingdu formed a hand seal, and three of the five holes immediately responded. Three jade-white lotus seeds popped out. The old Daoist Master said in a low voice:

"Please, both of you take one. Press it against the web of your thumb and hold it there. This will guard against Maha divination!"

'You had something this good and didn't mention it? You should have said so earlier...'

Li Ximing relaxed slightly. He pressed the seed into his hand as instructed and felt a strange sensation cover his dharma body, an indistinct five-colored treasured light. Following Lingdu, he exited the Great Void and found himself on the seabed somewhere within the Peacock Sea.

This area was dark and lightless. The seawater was a deep bronze-green. Li Ximing descended with the other two, quickly arriving at a massive undersea canyon. Lingdu said:

"Please wait here a moment!"

The old man vanished into the depths of the canyon. Although Li Ximing knew the probability of them harming him was almost zero, his heart still pounded nervously.

'If they set up a formation here and attacked me together, my life would be in grave danger... If I don't use the Profound Light... there is a sixty percent chance I will fall here...'

Fortunately, his fears did not materialize. After only half an incense stick of time, the seafloor began to tremble, and the entire seabed shook violently.

*BOOM!*

A brilliant, five-colored pillar of treasured light, as large as a house, erupted from the seabed. It surged through the heavy seawater, aiming for the sky. Houfu, who had been silently forming seals and chanting, finally stopped and barked:

"Rise!"

A small, patterned brown pouch flew from his sleeve, darting through the water to intercept the radiant light pillar mid-journey. The mouth of the bag pulsed. The five-colored light, which had been surging upward, bent its trajectory. It traveled several more li before turning just shy of the surface, diverting neatly into the bag's opening.

Suppressing such an anomaly was not easy. Even though the treasured light didn't pierce the heavens, auspicious clouds still gathered above the ocean surface. Li Ximing knew his part. He didn't use his own divine abilities or magic; instead, he activated the treasure pearl in his hand. The [Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger] lit up, and several beams of Earth-elemental radiance shot toward the sky, scattering the clouds.

Houfu's brow furrowed tightly. While maintaining control of the brown pouch with one hand, he looked at Li Ximing and warned in a low voice:

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, be warned. The Peacock Merciful One can sense this item. Although we are suppressing it, the Peacock Sea is right here. That Merciful One will certainly ride the winds to investigate."

Li Ximing nodded curtly. After a few breaths, the pillar of light finally subsided, and Houfu looked visibly more relaxed. Just then, however, a sound-shattering screech echoed from the horizon:

"CAW—!"

A colossal beast surfaced on the ocean—a mix of five-colors and bronze. It had red eyes, a golden beak, and was the size of a small mountain, with a broad, flat back. The streaking light of its wake flowed with multicolored, treasured hues, instantly dyeing half the sky.

The peacock leaped lightly, breached the sea, and plunged straight toward their location, its voice a deep, resonant male tone:

"Who dares steal from my Peacock lineage!"

The Merciful One arrived in an instant, transforming underwater into a middle-aged monk draped in five-colored robes. He had six ordination scars on his scalp, each a different color. His hands were empty, and his eyes were wide with fury.

Li Ximing glanced at Houfu. The Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery seemed immensely pleased by the monk's appearance. He laughed aloud and replied:

"Your father."

The middle-aged monk snapped his gaze toward the voice and froze, terror seizing his heart.

'Purple Mansion Realm?! Two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!'

A Merciful One was only about the level of an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Even if they cultivated the Lotus Seat, it primarily boosted survivability, not raw power. At best, he could fight a cultivator with two divine abilities. Typically, it took three to five Merciful Ones to resist a cultivator who had passed the Purple Mystery Threshold...

Seeing two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators at once terrified him. Furthermore, Li Ximing and Houfu had concealed their auras, revealing nothing of their divine ability cultivation, which made him completely unable to gauge their depth. Still, he was a Peacock, a Merciful One of the great Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour. His confidence remained. He spoke in a cold voice:

"I wonder which lineage these Daoist Masters hail from? Do you not know that the Peacock Sea is the territory of the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour? This treasured light also belongs to my Peacock lineage. Please hand it over immediately..."

"The Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour has four Merciful Ones in total, and they are rushing here now. Daoist friends, do not bring disaster upon yourselves!"

Li Ximing's Bright Yang divine ability was not suited for concealing his aura, and he had no idea what the Merciful One's divination capabilities were, so he remained silent. Houfu, however, burst into wild laughter, looking completely unrestrained as he answered coldly:

"I won't bother changing my name! I am Daoist Master Buzi of the Supreme Yang Azure Pond Sect! Now get lost!"

Li Ximing stared, stunned. He nearly turned his head to look at him, muttering inwardly:

'Wait... Houfu... you... huh?'

# Chapter 809: The Great Peacock Karma

Daoist Master Houfu was not a man of many words. Perhaps owing to his Xiukui lineage, he had a gloomy disposition and a reputation for being prideful. Li Ximing had always considered him a serious and cautious man.

Hearing Houfu say such a thing caught Li Ximing completely off guard. He had to hide his internal laughter.

'Oh, this is good. This is very good.'

But the peacock before them, who resembled a middle-aged man, narrowed his eyes. His colorful monastic robes pulsed with light as he spoke in a frigid tone, "Daoist... do you take me for a blind man!"

Houfu might have been bluffing, but the peacock certainly didn't buy it. If the great Daoist Master of the Azure Pond Sect, Chi Buzi, were truly present, how could he, Yu Guang, possibly still be standing here? Those two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators far surpassed him in strength. Yet, the pair before him were acting furtively and trying to change the subject. They must be terrified of provoking the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour!

Confidence surged in the peacock. He sneered, "I have heard that Chi Buzi is a green-eyed wraith with unbound hair, dressed in azure robes and golden tassels. His Divine Abilities are astonishing. How can two skulking curs like you possibly compare to him? Now, move!"

At those words, Houfu’s expression visibly darkened. His voice turned gravelly as he replied, "A brightly feathered chicken dares to bark like a rabid dog?"

The tension between them was thick enough to cut. If a fight broke out, Li Ximing would be the one forced to act. He quickly stepped forward, adopting a mild tone. "My colleague and I discovered this place together. By rights, what we find here is ours. How can it possibly belong to the Peacock Dao lineage?"

Yu Guang laughed, infuriated. He roared, "Stop playing dumb! You are merely stalling for time! Fine! I will see for myself exactly what kind of characters you are!"

His sleeve billowed as he summoned a vortex of iridescent flame from the void. The fire blazed fiercely even within the sea. With two fingers joined and his palm thrusting upward, he sent the flames smashing toward Houfu.

'It seems a fight is unavoidable...'

Li Ximing frowned slightly. 'I still underestimated Yu Guang’s position within the Buddhist Land. It seems that for a Merciful One—who is bold enough to maintain a path of retreat back in the Buddhist Land—the mere threat of two Purple Mansion cultivators isn't enough to make him retreat without testing us.'

They had already agreed that Li Ximing would be the one to fight. The Purple Mansion spiritual fire wasn't yet in hand, so Li Ximing couldn't refuse. He was preparing to raise his hand when the small bag in mid-air, still absorbing the treasure light, suddenly radiated a dark luster. From its flanks, the brilliant radiance of the Supreme Yang crackled and burst forth.

The Supreme Yang radiance moved naturally through the water, drifting before Houfu to intercept the attack. The Supreme Yang is the First Manifestation, and it instantly smothered the iridescent flames. As the two forces collided violently, Houfu’s icy voice cut through the turmoil: "Old mongrel, if you actually force my hand, you and your peacocks cannot afford the consequences!"

Yu Guang took one look and realized the pocket-like Dharma Artifact in the air was indeed no ordinary item. His lips moved, but no sound came out. A long bronze staff materialized in his hand. He took a single step into the void and vanished.

An intense warning sense flared in Li Ximing! The Profound Light between his brows pulsed, searching frantically, and his face stung with incipient pain. He cursed inwardly.

'Dammit... this colorful, bald donkey bullies the weak and fears the strong...'

Fortunately, Audience with the Celestial Gate inherently possessed aspects of a Body Divine Ability. The point of Profound Light between his brows was potent; it paused only a fraction of a second before locating the bronze staff striking toward him. Li Ximing’s lips buzzed, and he spat out a torrent of purple fire.

When he had previously dispersed the auspicious clouds unseen, he had used Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger specifically to avoid revealing his Bright Yang Divine Abilities. Now that he was in a direct confrontation, exposing the Bright Yang abilities was unavoidable; his Dharma Artifact was actually the more identifiable item. Thus, Li Ximing kept his artifact hidden, relying only on his Bright Yang flames to counter.

The purple fire transformed into a blazing violet serpent, slithering up the bronze staff and burning the Dharma power coating it with a sizzle. But Yu Guang’s momentum was ferocious. The staff flared with brilliant light, pressing the attack straight toward Li Ximing’s face.

*Bang!*

Li Ximing raised a hand, his palm reinforced by the Dharma power of his Bright Yang Divine Ability, and deflected the staff. His Dharma body shuddered from the impact. He seized the momentum to enter into the Great Void, only to feel a fiery sting erupt in his palm.

'This Merciful One... his Dharma body is impressively strong.'

Li Ximing had no intention of revealing the true form of Audience with the Celestial Gate—that would be tantamount to announcing his identity. By using only his Bright Yang abilities, he left himself some room for denial later.

Sure enough, the monk reversed his grip on the staff, his eyes widening in suspicion. "Bright Yang? Are you from the Cui family?"

The peacocks, after all, lived overseas. The most famous Bright Yang lineage in the Eastern Sea was unquestionably the Cui Clan of Chongzhou Island. Although the Li family had recently visited and the Cui clan had claimed their Purple Mansion experts were depleted, the Peacock Sea was too distant for Yu Guang to know this. His immediate suspicion falling upon the Cui clan was perfectly logical.

Now that Li Ximing had escaped into the Great Void, the monk did not pursue. Instead, he immediately dove toward the sea trench below. Houfu reappeared behind his pocket-like Dharma Artifact, placing both hands upon it to accelerate the absorption of the remaining treasure light.

Li Ximing had no choice but to step out of the Great Void, materializing in front of the monk to block him again. The monk instantly grew impatient. He hammered down twice with his staff, forcing Li Ximing back, then snatched a round disc from his sleeve.

The disc appeared to be bronze, glowing with an iridescent sheen. Its surface depicted a magnificent, multicolored Buddhist mural: a vast, vibrant ocean dominated by a spirit mountain that pierced the clouds. Spanning the sky above was an enormous peacock, roaring at the heavens. Kneeling beneath it was a naked woman, her face filled with piety, holding two swaddled bundles. The bundle in white cloth held an adorable, chubby baby; the bundle in red held a tiny, pink peacock, its beak open in a cry.

The eyes of the roaring peacock in the mural suddenly blazed, shooting twin beams of crimson light. Li Ximing was already wary and had preemptively entered the Great Void, yet he still felt a piercing pain between his brows. An instant later, a five-colored flame erupted onto his Dharma body. Sparks flew with the sharp sound of shattering glaze. *Crack!*

"Not good!"

After his ordeal with Changxiao, the sight of these flames struck terror into Li Ximing’s heart. He jumped several miles deeper into the Great Void. A box of spiritual water immediately materialized, and he slapped his Bright Yang Divine Ability over the wound, feeling a wave of soothing coolness.

Only then did he dare to inspect the damage. He found the flames had already vanished, leaving only a small, mottled mark on his Dharma body, about the size of a fingernail.

'Oh... that’s it? That’s pathetic.'

He felt a bead of sweat. Compared to Changxiao’s Dharma Art, this monk’s attack was a complete joke. Yet one was plain and simple, the other dazzling. Li Ximing stepped out of the void, purple flames erupting once more. The monk used his treasure to shine on him again. After several clashes, the monk demanded, "Which Dao lineage do you belong to, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing had once teamed up with Kongheng to suppress the [Wrathful Visage] Merciful One, Fu Xia. At that time, Fu Xia had already fallen to the level of a Master Monk, yet his Dharma body had endured their combined assaults unharmed. Now, Li Ximing was facing this new peacock with his full Purple Mansion cultivation, and this monk's Dharma body was clearly not weak. Unwilling to reveal his true Divine Abilities, Li Ximing found himself at a disadvantage relying on his Dharma body alone.

But Li Ximing lacked Houfu’s intimidating background; his only goal was to block the monk. He deliberately stalled for time. "This humble one is Gu Feng, merely a rogue cultivator from the Southern Sea. The item below now belongs to us; it has no fate with the Merciful Ones. I must ask you to retreat." He offered politeness before hostility, adding a threat, "Once the Great Daoist Master below finishes, your lineage may end up losing another Dharma Body today!"

Lingdu wasn't a "Great Daoist Master" at all and had no intention of revealing himself. Li Ximing was purely bluffing. Yet, although the peacock had forced Li Ximing onto the defensive, he possessed no decisive Divine Abilities. Annoyed by Li Ximing's persistence, the monk actually began to show hesitant, half-believing signs of withdrawal.

Yu Guang halted mid-water, his expression darkening. 'These two are acting suspiciously. This man has been fighting me this whole time but refuses to reveal his true Divine Abilities. If I force this into a battle to the death, am I not just forcing his hand to kill me? And that person holding the bag... that Dharma Artifact is far from simple. If that truly is the Supreme Yang lineage, this is deeply troublesome.'

He had to remember: the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour had *just* lost a Merciful One. This group, hiding their faces and identities, was suspicious to the extreme. Could they be the very cultivators who murdered Yuse? If so, staying here meant death!

Li Ximing didn’t know if Yu Guang had truly believed the bluff or if the monk simply lacked the confidence to break through his defenses. 'The peacocks of the Great Bestowal Temple must have lived too comfortably in their Peacock Sea,' Li Ximing mused. 'How do they compare to the cutthroat cultivators of Jiangnan? He won’t commit to fighting, yet he won’t fully retreat. He’s just wasting the opportunity. If he rushed down right now, he might even be able to negotiate a share. Since we clearly don't want to expose ourselves...' Their minds were on completely different tracks, their judgments worlds apart. But the Merciful One's intention to withdraw was solidifying.

Yu Guang ceased his attacks. He didn’t dare direct his parting words at Houfu, who held the suspected Supreme Yang treasure. Instead, he fixed Li Ximing with a glare, clasped his hands together, and said coldly, "Daoist Gu Feng, you have taken an artifact of our Buddhist Land. Karma will surely follow. You may return it personally to the Buddhist Land, or retribution will find you, and you will lose both your life and your treasure. This old monk has given his warning. We will be waiting!"

Li Ximing almost laughed at the peacock’s sanctimonious display. He shook his head and replied, matching the hostility, "If you bald-feathered birds don’t leave now, we will be the ones sending you back to the Buddhist Land—in pieces!"

Yu Guang’s expression turned venomous. He finally vanished.

Li Ximing recalled his Dharma power and flew toward the shallower water. The pillar of treasure light had already weakened to the thickness of a finger. Houfu gave the bag a final tug, absorbing the remnants, before turning to Li Ximing and nodding. "My thanks, Zhaojing. You bore the burden this time."

That bald bird was fierce in appearance but timid in reality, intimidated entirely by Houfu’s Supreme Yang artifact. Li Ximing hadn't even needed to deploy Audience with the Celestial Gate. This hardly counted as taking the fall; at most, he had attracted a flicker of suspicion. In exchange, he was getting a Purple Mansion spiritual fire. How could that possibly be considered a burden? He cupped his hands. "It is I who must thank Daoist Houfu!"

He meant it sincerely. Although Houfu's artifact was now exposed, he hadn't needed to reveal it. Since the plan had designated Li Ximing as the fighter, Houfu could have easily remained hidden and let Li Ximing shoulder the entire confrontation. Without the deterrent of that Supreme Yang radiance combined with Houfu's verbal threats, Yu Guang would likely never have withdrawn.

Houfu waved him off, his voice heavy. "That Yu Guang brought the [Peacock’s Providence Disc]. That was unexpected. If not for the fact that his cultivation base is insufficient and he clearly has not earned the treasure's full recognition, this confrontation would not have ended so easily."

"So it was the monk who was weak, not the treasure that was all show."

Li Ximing nodded, seizing the opportunity to ask, "I seldom encounter the artifacts of Buddhist cultivators. Do all of them possess their own spirituality? Why do they reach the point of needing 'recognition' from the wielder?"

Houfu sneered. "A Dharma Artifact is a tool, and a Daoist Master is a person. A Buddhist treasure is also a tool... but does a Merciful One even count as a person? Within the Buddhist Land, they are nothing but slaves to the Mahas. If a wealthy man acquires a fine carriage, is the driver necessarily more esteemed than the carriage itself? If one is a landlord, the tenant farmer is less valuable than the ox. It is the same principle. Whether it's 'recognized' or not simply depends on whether the master decides to assign that ox to that farmer."

His words dripped with sarcasm. "That [Peacock’s Providence Disc] is the personal treasure of the Peacock’s Son. It should be equivalent to one of our Dharma Treasures. It really ought to have its own classification..."

Li Ximing frowned. "That is precisely my confusion. Why don’t the Buddhist cultivators delineate their items clearly? A Master Monk uses a Treasured Artifact, a Merciful One uses a Treasured Artifact, and a Maha also uses a Treasured Artifact. Isn’t that incredibly confusing?"

At this topic, Houfu’s sarcastic smile deepened. He retrieved his bulging, sack-like Dharma Artifact. "If they delineated them clearly, what grand opera would the Buddhist Land have left to perform? How many Dharma Treasures has the Immortal Dao passed down through the ages? And how many Dharma Treasure-level artifacts has the Buddhist Land managed to create? We must exceed them tenfold! And what if we compare Dharma Treasures? My Supreme Yang lineage alone can name seven distinct Dharma Treasures! And that’s not counting all those lost to the ages."

"How could those idiots from the Seven Paths ever accept such a comparison? So, within the Buddhist Land, only a treasure personally wielded by a Maha is called a Enlightened Artifact. If a mere Merciful One wishes to use one, they must formally *request* it!"

Li Ximing finally nodded, his understanding clearing. 'If that's the case,' he thought, 'then artifacts at the Dharma Treasure level are vanishingly rare among them. This means the status of the Peacock clan is likely far greater than even the rumors suggest.'

They exchanged a few more words before Lingdu’s aged voice suddenly echoed in their ears: "Fellow Daoists, the matter here is concluded. Please grip the lotus seed in the web of your thumb, take a wide detour through the Great Void, and cover your tracks. Come to Nine Mounds."

Joy flashed in Li Ximing’s heart. He exchanged a glance with Houfu. Without another word, they immediately split up, vanishing into the Great Void.

Once inside the Great Void, Li Ximing felt a coolness radiating from the web of his thumb. He flew east through the void, going all the way to the Sea's Cape. He then looped more than halfway around the Cape, almost reaching the World's Navel, before finally turning toward the Nine Mounds immortal mountain.

By the time he arrived at the mountain, two days had passed. Houfu was already waiting in the courtyard before the main gate, sipping tea. He was clearly waiting. Seeing Li Ximing finally arrive, he remarked, "Zhaojing is exceedingly cautious."

'How can I not be cautious? I was the one who fought. The Bright Yang lineage isn't known for stealth, unlike your Xiukui path that comes and goes without a trace...'

He merely cupped his hands and smiled. "My apologies for making Senior wait!"

So much time had been wasted that Houfu didn't bother offering him tea. He swept the entire tea set away with one motion, eliminating any chance for small talk, and the two proceeded inside together.

Passing through a maple forest, they found Lingdu leaning on his cane. Standing before him was another person—a tall figure dressed in profound black robes, cinched at the waist by a white and green sash. His dark hair was bound neatly, cascading down his back.

Perhaps hearing their footsteps, the man turned. He possessed the features of a young man, strikingly elegant, but his pupils were faintly red, radiating an unsettling, demonic aura. He did not look like a benevolent figure.

Seeing that even Lingdu stood respectfully a half-step behind him, Li Ximing knew who this must be. Beside him, Houfu lowered his head—for the first time Li Ximing had seen—and spoke with deep deference. "Junior Houfu greets Daoist Master Yuandao!"

Li Ximing quickly followed suit, bowing deeply. "Junior Zhaojing pays his respects to the Great Daoist Master."

Li Ximing had long heard tales of this Great Daoist Master of the Dantai family, Dantai Lingtong. This Daoist Master Yuandao had supposedly already refined his *fifth* Divine Ability, placing his cultivation even higher than Si Boxiu's! He was a Great Daoist Master at the absolute peak of the Purple Mansion Realm. Even a Maha would not dare act arrogantly in his presence and would have to treat him as an equal.

After they completed their bows, the Great Daoist Master’s temperament proved entirely contrary to his unsettling appearance. His voice was warm, polite, and calm as still water, entirely lacking in arrogance. "Please, both of you, sit."

Li Ximing sat down obediently. Houfu also seemed unusually subdued. Only Lingdu moved comfortably, preparing tea for the three of them. Daoist Master Yuandao looked over with a smile. "How is fellow Daoist Lou Xing these days? It has been some time since I last saw him."

The question was clearly directed at Houfu. Li Ximing kept his gaze low. Houfu replied gravely, "The Ancestor was stuck comprehending the 'Purple Mystery' for a century, and it wore down his spirit. Although he has now broken through... he does not have much time remaining. He often speaks to me of the Great Daoist Master's Divine Abilities... He misses you greatly."

Daoist Master Yuandao rested one hand on the table as he accepted the small cup from Lingdu. Li Ximing caught a glimpse of a fine, dark sandalwood prayer chain looped around his wrist. The Great Daoist Master nodded, then turned his gaze to Li Ximing. "The next generation is truly formidable. I had thought Houfu achieving his Divine Ability so young was impressive, but I did not expect Zhaojing to be his equal. A rogue cultivator attaining the Purple Mansion Realm in less than a century... truly remarkable."

Given the stature of the man sitting before him, the Li family’s meager foundation was nothing. Calling Li Ximing a rogue cultivator wasn't wrong. Li Ximing would not correct him, replying only, "Junior was merely fortunate. It cannot compare to the Great Daoist Master’s vast abilities."

Daoist Master Yuandao chuckled softly. "We troubled you this time. Lingdu did indeed acquire the spiritual fire from that palace monastery... Lingdu!"

Lingdu quickly retrieved a small, vermillion ceramic bowl from his robes and placed it carefully on the table.

The bowl was exquisite and delicate, no larger than a baby’s fist. It was smooth and immaculate. Within its dark interior, a single, grayish-red flame, no bigger than a grain of rice, flickered, surrounded by a faint five-colored halo.

Daoist Master Yuandao sipped his tea. Seeing that Li Ximing didn't recognize the item, he explained, "This is the [Small Peacock Karma Merging Fire]. You can refer to it simply as [Small Peacock Karma]. Do not be fooled by its rice-grain appearance in this bowl; if released, it would likely swell to the size of a mountain peak."

He continued, "This fire is a transmutation of the [Lustful Merging Fire]. That fire is the second type of fire exhaled from the beaks of coupling Yuwu birds... The first fire they exhale corresponds to the Supreme Yang; this second fire corresponds to Bright Yang, possessing the effect of sexual union."

"Thus, the ancient Yuwu birds were omens of wanton revelry in broad daylight. This is the reason."

This level of esoteric Dao discussion left not only Li Ximing stunned, but even Houfu was staring at the bowl with rapt attention. The Great Daoist Master paused. He flicked a finger lightly, and the sound of a great bell chimed, echoing across the entire immortal mountain.

Lingdu explained from the side, "The Great Daoist Master is discussing ancient True Monarchs and Demon Monarchs. He must first alert the disciples to guard themselves, lest the Merging Fire descend in response to the mention and burn the forests."

Daoist Master Yuandao paused briefly, then continued, "This fire was obtained by the Great Peacock and passed to his eldest son. That son entered the Buddhist Dao—his name must not be spoken—and cultivated this fire into the [Great Peacock Karma]. From his seat, the [Small Peacock Karma] was born. This is that flame."

He concluded, "The [Small Peacock Karma] can be classified as a Merging Fire. Among Purple Mansion spiritual fires, its power is considerable. It ranks in the mid-to-upper tier, at least."

Li Ximing felt a mix of joy and regret.

He had long prepared himself for the possibility that the spiritual fire he received would not be the Li Fire he desperately wanted. The world's flames were myriad... Yet he had participated resolutely, driven by the Intercalary Sun Art. The Intercalary Sun Art was originally Tu Longjian’s great opportunity; it allowed certain flames to be converted between paths, primarily involving the Li, True, and Molten Fire paths.

However, the *Art* did not cover every flame within those three categories, and furthermore, the Merging Fire path existed entirely outside its scope. Li Ximing had already prepared himself for the inability to convert it. He was not a greedy man—any Purple Mansion spiritual fire was a massive gain.

Although this was a Merging Fire, based on the Great Daoist Master’s words, its power was exceptional. Li Ximing still felt the exchange was more than worth it. Joy filled his heart, but another doubt immediately surfaced.

'I merely attracted a flicker of suspicion. Do I truly deserve such a reward? This Merging Fire practically has the word "Peacock" written all over it! If I actually use this against an enemy, won't I be cementing myself as the culprit?'

If Daoist Master Yuandao hadn't explained its origin, Li Ximing would have accepted it after some polite refusals. But since the Great Daoist Master was sitting right here and had been so explicit, Li Ximing had no choice but to state respectfully, "A flame of such power... this Junior is unworthy to receive it. Please, Great Daoist Master, take it back!"

Hearing this, Daoist Master Yuandao raised an eyebrow slightly and shook his head. "There is no need for such ceremony. Your family is a power under the Immortal Mansion's governance. My Supreme Mound Dao lineage has deep ties to the Immortal Mansion. It is only natural to look after one of our own. It is just a spiritual fire."

Li Ximing was inwardly staggered. 'A Dao lineage with deep ties to the Immortal Mansion... If they are contemporaries, does that mean the Dantai family is on par with the founder of the Mansion? Even if they are a level below, that still makes them a "Three Sects" level power... No wonder he is so formidable! The Dantai family’s background is truly profound!'

He hurriedly bowed again. "Senior! One should only receive reward proportional to their merit. This Junior dares not be greedy. Furthermore, this [Small Peacock Karma] is a treasure of the peacocks. For this Junior to take it would be like holding a burning coal... I absolutely dare not accept it!"

Daoist Master Yuandao did not move, allowing him to complete the first bow. Only then did he reach out, gently halting Li Ximing's attempt to bow further. "Zhaojing, you are too polite," he said softly. "Set your mind at ease. Since I have explained this matter to you, I naturally have no intention of harming you."



### Chapter 810: The Goodwill of Nine Mounds

Daoist Master Yuandao finished speaking and pointed lightly to the small, vermilion ceramic bowl on the low table. His reddish pupils flickered as he began.

"I know Zhaojing is worried about the peacock matter. This Small Peacock Karma is not something found just anywhere in the world. Parading it about is ultimately unwise. Not only is the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour determined to acquire this fire, but at least five of the seven Northern Buddhist paths have Buddhist cultivators who could achieve their Dao using this karmic flame. Holding onto it will bring endless trouble..."

"I will give Zhaojing three choices."

He shifted his cup slightly, extended his hand, and said:

"First. Although the Small Peacock Karma is a karmic fire born of the Buddhist Land, its essence is still inseparable from the Lustful Merging Fire. However, it is unlike the Great Peacock Karma, which was personally refined by a being of great divine abilities. I am quite familiar with the Peacock Dao lineage. I can transform this fire into another type of Merging Fire for you, one called the 'Flame of Final Return.' It is similarly connected to Bright Yang and is a rare, gentle fire among the Merging Fires. It can be used for alchemy, but not for artifact refinement, nor can it be used against Converging Water or Geng Metal."

"Although the transformation process is tedious, lengthy, and expensive, and the 'Flame of Final Return' is far less valuable than the Small Peacock Karma, we happen to have a portion of it here on the mountain. You can retrieve it first..."

"That is the first option."

Li Ximing felt a stirring of interest and nodded respectfully, though a doubt immediately surfaced in his mind:

‘I’m afraid the Nine Mounds Dao lineage can only transform the Small Peacock Karma *into* the Flame of Final Return, but not reverse the process... Daoist Master Yuandao’s words imply he doesn't want to let the Small Peacock Karma go.’

While he was contemplating this, Daoist Master Yuandao continued.

"Second. You hand the Small Peacock Karma over to my Nine Mounds Dao lineage, and I will naturally provide a different spiritual fire in exchange. This fire is a True Fire, called the 'Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire.'"

"In recent antiquity, as the Supreme Yang and Bright Yang grew heavier while the Supreme Yin and Veiled Yin grew lighter, True Fires became increasingly fierce and Water Mansions grew increasingly gentle. True Fires gradually skewed heavily toward artifact refinement. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire is an exception. The True Fire Auxiliary Position it corresponds to still resonates, preserving qualities from a much older era. It is exceptionally suited for alchemy."

"However, in combat, it is inferior to the Flame of Final Return. No matter how gentle, the Flame of Final Return is still a Merging Fire. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire lacks the ferocity of modern True Fires, making it weaker by a notch."

He took a sip of tea and finally said:

"Third. I can also compensate you with other spiritual items."

"The prosperity of Water and Fire is unmatched by other paths. I will not bully you. Besides the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, we also have a measure of Pristine Water here on Nine Mounds Mountain."

When Daoist Master Yuandao finished, Li Ximing felt suddenly torn.

‘There is no Li Fire. I wonder if the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire can be converted into Li Fire... The Flame of Final Return can be used for both alchemy and combat, and it’s compatible with Bright Yang. That is also a good choice.’

The spiritual flames Daoist Master Yuandao offered were simply too tempting. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire sounded like something only these ancient Dao lineages could produce. Transforming it into Li Fire would be an outrageous waste. Li Ximing felt that even if he obtained this fire, he would treasure it immensely and truly be unable to bear converting it into Li Fire...

Beyond his indecision over the two flames, Li Ximing harbored an even deeper, hidden worry:

‘This Daoist Master has no connection to me. Why is he being so kind? All I did on this trip was show my face, yet I’m being offered such heavy compensation? Am I about to be tied into some massive karma?’

Belatedly, he grew hesitant.

‘Hah... I always see the rich benefits right in front of me and act too hastily. I can never think three steps ahead like Brother Jun and make meticulous arrangements. I just escaped one constraint, and now I seem to have walked straight into a thicket of thorns. Fortunately, Nine Mounds doesn't seem to bear heavy malice, so this is still remediable...’

Driven by this anxiety, Li Ximing first left his seat, bowed deeply, and spoke respectfully:
"To have formed this connection with Nine Mounds, to have offered my meager strength, and to have met the Great Daoist Master—Zhaojing was already content. I truly had no greedy intentions and only hoped to remove the mark. Now, I only fear the Peacock’s oppressive might, terrified that I cannot find peace. I dare not accept the Daoist Master’s spiritual items. I only hope for a small measure of shelter to avoid their venomous beak."

As soon as he said this, Houfu paused, visibly stunned. Daoist Master Yuandao, however, merely raised an eyebrow, the corners of his mouth curving slightly. He spoke:

"You are certainly a cautious one. Since it has come to this, I might as well speak plainly... Listen closely, and do not repeat what you hear."

Li Ximing nodded quickly. The Daoist Master smiled.

"Your guess is correct. Something extraordinary was indeed taken from that hidden treasury, something vital to the peacocks. If news of a treasure of this magnitude got out, it would be enough to shake the entire Buddhist Land and alarm the Maha. Vija and Sibha themselves would come to retrieve it."

Li Ximing’s heart sank, but seeing the other party speaking so openly, he paradoxically felt a sense of relief. Yuandao’s slightly reddish eyes stared at him as he replied:

"But this matter was not undertaken privately by my Nine Mounds Dao lineage. Do you understand? It was already decided that Vija would strictly order Abbot Yukuan to personally enter the Buddhist Land and report it. This treasure cannot fall into the peacocks' hands. The peacocks cannot even know of its tracks! Although the peacocks themselves are hardly worth mentioning... their voices are very loud."

As he spoke that last sentence, Daoist Master Yuandao's expression turned grim. Li Ximing nodded in understanding. Yuandao continued softly:

"Regardless of how Yukuan reports the loss of the Peacock Dao treasury to Vija and Sibha, the two Maha will not act in earnest. Instead, they will drag their feet and handle the matter lightly. They would much rather you *not* fall into the peacocks' hands, giving them even the slightest chance of learning anything."

"The only ones you have truly offended are the few peacocks in that temple. Even if this secret is exposed one day, it will merely throw the Buddhist Land into an uproar, an internal chaos. No one will treat you as the main culprit."

"As for the spiritual fire."

Yuandao glanced at him with a smile and said softly:
"Whether it is the 'Flame of Final Return' or the 'Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire,' both are inextricably linked to Nine Mounds. This is merely my Nine Mounds Dao lineage signaling that we have protected you, demonstrating to the Buddhist Land that the Immortal Dao will not sacrifice even a single Purple Mansion cultivator over this affair."

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He nodded repeatedly, bowing once more to Yuandao.
"Many thanks, Great Daoist Master! This junior..."

Yuandao waved his hand dismissively.
"There is no need for thanks. Nine Mounds cannot help you with the big troubles, but we can lend a hand with minor, peripheral matters. Just don't blame our lineage for watching you die when your family truly encounters a disaster you cannot handle."

This statement was abrupt, bordering on rude. Li Ximing froze for a second, but Houfu, standing beside him, nodded slightly and picked up the conversation:
"The Great Daoist Master has always been charitable and has helped many people on Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain. Such incidents inevitably occur... But Zhaojing is a man of integrity, with an excellent reputation in Jiangnan. His grand-uncle... was Daoist Master Yuansu’s capable right hand."

Yuandao smiled faintly and gestured to Lingdu.
"Fetch the fire."

Lingdu immediately departed. Yuandao, meanwhile, turned to idle chatter.
"It's a long story... Back then, both Daoist friends Yuansu and Yuanxiu visited Nine Mounds. I suppose we are of the same generation. In those days, that pair of martial brothers was always bickering. They had a massive argument here and parted on bad terms. They never had any close interactions after that."

"But when Yuanxiu came to see me the other day, he looked down and wrung his hands when speaking of Yuansu, shifting like he was sitting on pins and needles. I suppose... there is still affection between them."

Li Ximing nodded respectfully, but a sliver of doubt rose in his heart.
‘If that’s the case... then even Yuanxiu, the youngest of the three Yuans of Azure Pond Sect, doesn't have much longevity left. How much better off can this Daoist Master Yuandao be? Yet look at him... his essence and spirit remain at their peak. He even retains the appearance of a young man, and his tone betrays no hint of twilight age... If he isn't using a divine ability to mask it, his life-nurturing cultivation is truly remarkable...’

He had just finished this thought when Lingdu returned from the side, carrying two small bowls.

One appeared to be crafted from Geng Metal, plated with some unknown substance that gave it a dark, dull finish. The other was another vermilion ceramic bowl. Both were no larger than a child’s fist.

Lingdu carried them before him, opening the Geng Metal one first to reveal a pinpoint of grayish-gold light, the size of a grain of rice. He introduced it:
"This is the 'Flame of Final Return,' a Merging Fire. This is the portion stored on the mountain. This fire damages artifacts, so it is best stored in seamless Geng Metal."

He then presented the other bowl. Inside was a pinpoint of bright red light, also the size of a grain of rice. Nine Mounds must possess some incredible sealing technique; regardless of how ferocious a flame was, once captured in this bowl, it was reduced to a mere speck.

"This is the 'Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire,' a True Fire. True Fire refines metal, so it is contained in a glazed ceramic dharma artifact tempered with Converging Water."

Li Ximing knew these were his to choose from. After a moment's hesitation, he accepted the vermilion ceramic bowl and said respectfully:
"This junior accepts the Great Daoist Master’s decree. I shall remember this profound kindness and never forget it."

The Flame of Final Return and the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire were nearly identical in rarity. If comparing value, the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was likely superior. The Flame of Final Return was slightly stronger and could also be used for alchemy, with the added benefit of compatibility with Bright Yang. However, Li Ximing reckoned that with his Talisman Qi, 'Valley Wind Guide-Fire,' he didn't lack that bit of compatibility.

Furthermore, the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was a True Fire. It most likely met the requirements for transformation under the Intercalary Sun Art. Even if Li Ximing had no intention of converting such a precious fire, having an extra path was never a bad thing.
‘Great Parting's White Brilliance requires Li Fire to cultivate and deploy. Without that fire, it’s useless. Otherwise, the best option would be to convert it, complete the cultivation, and then convert it back...’

The subtle mysteries of the Flame of Final Return and the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire could never be summarized in a few sentences by Yuandao and the others, and their applications in various situations would differ. Even if he came to regret it later, this was the best choice Li Ximing could make right now.

"Congratulations, Zhaojing!" Houfu offered his felicitations.

Lingdu also nodded slightly and smiled. "The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire is not easy to refine. Please take this glazed bowl as well. Even if Zhaojing does not refine it here on Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain, this will make it convenient to carry."

Li Ximing had been coveting this thing for a while. He wished he could grab the metal bowl too, wipe it on his robes, and stuff it into his chest. Verbally, however, he remained modest:
"How can I possibly accept this..."

In truth, Li Ximing didn't really need the bowl. With 'Valley Wind Guide-Fire' in hand, any flame that fell into his possession, even the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, would be refined in an instant. But firstly, he needed to maintain a low profile, and secondly, why not accept a free item?

He accepted the bowl, thoroughly satisfied. Lingdu then said warmly:
"There is still the Shade-Cleansing Pool to visit... This... please allow the Great Daoist Master to take a look..."

He seemed hesitant, though whether toward Yuandao or Li Ximing was unclear. After all, inspecting another's dharma body was often a taboo act, as one never knew what measures might be left behind. But Li Ximing, possessing his own treasures, was completely unafraid. He feigned a moment of hesitation before extending his hand.

Yuandao turned his gaze, lightly tapped Li Ximing, and withdrew his touch almost instantly. The Great Daoist Master's eyes shifted, scanning Li Ximing, and he spoke with a trace of surprise:
"The Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage traces and silver bottle marks Lingdu spoke of... I detect none of them. The karmic connection from the Peacock’s Providence Disc has also been resolved by the 'Seven Mansions Lotus Seed.' This dharma body of Zhaojing's... aside from some minor injuries, there is nothing else."

‘That old bastard Changxiao... he really is playing these games of illusion and reality!’ Li Ximing cursed inwardly.

Yuandao continued, "However... since you are here, you might as well make the trip. We can heal these minor injuries while we're at it, and perhaps advance your cultivation a bit."

"Please wait in your grotto-dwelling for now. The Shade-Cleansing Pool on the mountain only thaws at the Zi hour. When the time approaches, I will send a disciple to guide you."

Li Ximing knew this was a dismissal. He offered his thanks, bowed slightly, and quickly departed. Only after he had left the area did Yuandao ask:

"Well?"

Houfu pondered for a moment before replying:
"His talent is decent, and he has a benevolent nature. Unfortunately, his background is too shallow. He hasn't seen many true treasures, so he is easily moved and doesn't know how to refuse offers... To have reached the Purple Mansion Realm, his intellect is certainly not lacking; at least among ordinary clan cultivators, he is first-class. Among Purple Mansion cultivators, however, he can only be considered average. He has one point—the Profound Peak incident revealed his stubbornness and loyalty to his word. He can be befriended. As an enemy, he poses no great threat."

Yuandao chuckled. He looked even younger than Houfu. "Stubborn and loyal to his word? Not necessarily. He might value relationships, or he might just have been unable to back down."

***

Li Ximing arrived at the stream by the maple forest and sat down. The gurgling water was pleasant. The white jade lamp pedestals lining the stream had been refilled with a different spiritual item, but unfortunately, the grade was too low for his cultivation level and had almost no effect.

He took the red-glazed bowl into his hand, rubbing it for a moment, pondering.
‘The spiritual materials used for this aren't high-grade, but the crafting technique is exquisite. It seems to be a special refinement method...’

Li Ximing flicked the bowl lightly. Several hazy red lights immediately lit up at the rim, revealing a tiny spot of golden-red. Just an instant later, the bright red flame surged eagerly from the mouth of the bowl, erupting like a golden flower. It bloomed, petals of gold light hanging in the air, displaying their utmost beauty.

The flame immediately tried to escape. Two streams of bright red fire split, bracing themselves on the bowl's rim, struggling to pull the other half of their body out. Li Ximing seized the opportunity to observe it.

The fire was bright red overall. The outer ring was blazing red, marked with layers of faint red patterns. The interior was whitish, with flashes of gold occasionally leaping out.

This was, after all, someone else’s territory. He didn't know if there were eyes in the forest or what measures the Purple Mansion array here might have. Li Ximing did not immediately refine the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire. Instead, he simply sensed it for a moment, then reached his hand toward the blazing red outer flame.

A piercing pain shot through him. Li Ximing retracted his hand; his fingertips had turned slightly white.
‘It is far more mysterious than the Bright Yang Purple Flame... and the power of the flames cannot be compared. A True Fire has the power to incinerate artifacts; Bright Yang is the Dao of generation and growth. Although this Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire is not fierce, its ability to burn dharma artifacts and the dharma body is on a completely different level—heaven and earth—compared to the inherent Bright Yang Purple Flame of my divine ability...’

‘My dharma body should be considered quite good among Purple Mansion cultivators who haven't refined a Body Divine Ability, yet even I must retreat from this Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire...’

Suppressing the urge to refine this fire for alchemy, he closed his eyes and entered meditation. Soon, an immortal attendant approached and said respectfully:
"Daoist Master, please follow me."

Li Ximing followed him deep into the forest. Purple mist began to rise beneath his feet. After passing through a hazy purple path, he saw a small pool constructed of fine white stones. It appeared to be empty.

The attendant had already retreated. However, a person stood beside the pool. It was Dantai Muming from earlier. He bowed to Li Ximing and said respectfully:
"Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing."

"This is the Shade-Cleansing Pool. It is a wondrous land aligned with Pure Qi and Lesser Yin. Its spiritual energy is pure and gentle, suitable for all Daos. It contains a resource known as the 'Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew,' which is particularly effective at healing the spiritual sense, advancing dharma power, removing impurities, dispelling foreign energies, preserving life, and avoiding lightning."

Li Ximing nodded slightly. Dantai Muming continued:
"Please, Daoist Master, sit by the pool and circulate your divine abilities to cultivate."

Li Ximing had been thinking he would have to enter the pool to cultivate; if anything unexpected happened, it might endanger his dharma body. He was therefore quite happy to sit by the edge. Just as he closed his eyes, Dantai Muming also withdrew.

He cultivated for about an hour when he felt a sudden coolness on his brow, as if a drop of clear dew had landed right between his eyes. As expected, his mind felt instantly clear, comfortable, and refreshed.

A Purple Mansion cultivator’s Shengyang Mansion had already been pushed into the Great Void. Li Ximing could see it clearly: the clear dew seeped in from his brow and immediately began to drip from within his Shengyang Mansion, turning into a torrential downpour that pelted everything inside the mansion.

Li Ximing felt as if he were standing in the rain, and a thought surfaced:
"If one were to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm at this location, would this Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew fall continuously to keep the spiritual sense clear? If it has such a wondrous use, this would be a rare treasure indeed."

He had just finished the thought when the divine abilities within his body surged. A massive amount of divine ability dharma power flooded into him. A white mist had risen in the area, nourishing every corner of his dharma body.

Li Ximing hurriedly circulated his divine abilities, meditating and cultivating.

But the white mist was vast, and his speed of refining divine abilities couldn't keep up. Ninety percent of it simply dissipated outside his dharma body. Li Ximing watched this, feeling it was a slight pity.
"Such pure dharma power... Unfortunately, refining divine abilities isn't just about having sufficient dharma power... Having enough power is good, but how can the refinement speed possibly be this fast?"

Just as he was lamenting this, a light rose from his sea of qi. The divine ability dharma power that had spread throughout his dharma body surged frantically toward his sea of qi. Amidst the storm of white mist, a brilliance suddenly ascended:
Valley Wind Guide-Fire!

Valley Wind Guide-Fire could manipulate fire, draw qi, and refine true essence and dharma power!

Throughout Li Ximing’s cultivation life, Valley Wind Guide-Fire hadn't played a huge role. While helpful for his cultivation speed, it was far from the terrifying efficiency of Li Yuanjiao’s 'Spirit-Devouring Qi Circulation.' Only now did he realize its potential as the vast dharma power surged toward him.

But Li Ximing still couldn't refine it into divine abilities fast enough; he could only circulate his Talisman Qi first.

If 'Spirit-Devouring Qi Circulation' were here, it would undoubtedly transform all of this into cultivation base. Li Ximing could only watch helplessly as Valley Wind Guide-Fire swallowed all the dharma power in one go, refined it, and gathered it all in his sea of qi.

Li Ximing glanced at it and thought:
‘Not bad at all.’

Only then did he open his eyes. Before him was the same bamboo forest. The white stone spiritual pool at his feet was now frozen over with a thick layer of blue ice, reflecting a crystalline light. The mist in the forest had vanished completely.

His dharma body was, naturally, perfectly fine, without any side effects. It had even advanced slightly. His cultivation base had also grown considerably. Valley Wind Guide-Fire had helped somewhat; combined with Audience with the Celestial Gate and his original cultivation, he had now crossed the initial threshold.

‘This saved me three years of work.’

He flicked his sleeves, stood up, and walked out via the path. Only two cultivators were guarding the forest. Seeing him, they hurriedly bowed. Li Ximing simply asked:
"How much time has passed?"

"Reporting to Daoist Master, we have been guarding this place ever since you entered seclusion. Eight months have passed."

"Has Daoist Master Houfu left the mountain?"

The moment Li Ximing asked, the cultivator immediately replied:
"Reporting to Daoist Master, Daoist Master Houfu has been lecturing on the scriptures and teaching arts on the mountain these past few months, once per month. He has not left. He should still be on the mountain now."

‘He certainly knows how to build relationships...’

Li Ximing was in high spirits. He headed toward the mountain peak and indeed saw Houfu and Lingdu from a distance, conversing in the forest. The same chessboard was set before them. This time, it seemed to be a new game, with only a few pieces placed.

As long as they were playing, Li Ximing didn't have to worry about being dragged into a game. He walked over confidently. As expected, the two looked up. Lingdu smiled.

"Congratulations, Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing returned the courtesy politely and asked:
"Where is the Great Daoist Master? I must go and thank him!"

Lingdu shook his head. "He has already left to visit a friend. It will be difficult for him to return within three to five years."

Li Ximing looked deeply regretful and offered a few polite words, though deep down, he felt a small sense of relief. He sat down nearby, looked at Houfu, and said quietly:
"Senior Houfu, when do you return to Jiangnan?"

Houfu looked surprised. "It will likely be several more months."

Li Ximing seized the chance and said with a smile:
"I actually have a favor to ask of you, Senior... I took on a Foundation Establishment disciple overseas and need to bring her back to Jiangnan, but I have many affairs overseas and cannot be in two places at once. I must ask Senior for help."

For a Purple Mansion cultivator, a trip to Jiangnan didn't take much time. Both of them naturally understood why he wasn't going personally. Houfu just nodded.
"It’s that Xia Shouyu, isn't it? She has often come to listen to my lectures these past few months. Earlier, I thought she was a disciple of Nine Mounds seeking the Dao. Although her cultivation is shallow, her heart for the Dao is strong."

Li Ximing nodded, expressing a trace of regret:
"She was carefully selected by me, but her background is lacking... and her surname isn't Li. I worry that when she returns, she won't have the prestige or status to keep others in line... It's quite troublesome! I was just thinking about picking out a background for her."

As he spoke, he glanced at Lingdu. That old man was sharp. He said leisurely:
"That's simple enough. Just give her a powerful status. Since she'll be far overseas, it doesn't matter if it's real or fake. If Fellow Daoist doesn't mind, we can give her the status of a relative of a Nine Mounds cultivator, acknowledging a background for her..."

Li Ximing had originally hoped to angle for an outer disciple status, but he didn't expect Lingdu to be so unwilling to accept any karma, wanting nothing to do with his own lineage. He replied verbally, "That is indeed a good solution..."

Lingdu let out a heavy sigh. "There is a disciple on the mountain who just perished while attempting breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, severing his incense line. We will recognize her as his granddaughter. Let her call him maternal grandfather... She just needs to place a few sticks of incense on his spirit tablet, and it will be settled."

Lingdu had dragged a dead man into it. Li Ximing didn't mind; it was just a matter of fabricating a title. He smiled, "Excellent! This has truly troubled Senior Lingdu!"

Before long, Dantai Muming hurriedly led Xia Shouyu up the path. The woman looked nervous and uneasy; she had absolutely no standing to speak in this place. Lingdu merely glanced at her and called out.

"Muming!"

Dantai Muming hurried forward. The two whispered to each other. It was impossible to know if Dantai Muming knew the truth, but when he stepped back, his expression had completely changed. He said joyfully.

"So it turns out she is Senior Brother Yudui’s granddaughter, the one who was lost! I will take her down to acknowledge her ancestor right away!"

Xia Shouyu reacted even faster. Her eyes instantly turned red, and she nodded emphatically. Dantai Muming led her away, speaking intimately to her along the path, appearing concerned in the extreme.

Li Ximing watched the two depart. Lingdu sighed meaningfully.

"Zhaojing... some are showered with endless sweet rain yet cannot be helped up, while others rise to the ninth heaven on a single gust of wind. It is truly hard to say..."



### Chapter 811: Destiny-Forged Alchemy

Li Ximing nodded. The three Purple Mansion cultivators began discussing the dao right then and there. Lingdu opened with a topic, speaking on the flawless nature of Wu Earth and which Dao could restrain it. Houfu countered by recounting stories of the Daoist Masters in his family sparring with Wu Earth cultivators. He speculated that a certain divine art within the Upright Wood lineage was the ultimate counter to Wu Earth, and the conversation flowed with enthusiasm.

Li Ximing, naturally, had little to contribute. His only significant contact was with Changxi of the Earth Virtue, and beyond that, Sumian of the Treasured Earth Dao. He had only heard that some cultivator named Cheng Yan practiced Wu Earth, but he’d never even met the man. He settled for listening intently, chiming in only with pleasantries when appropriate.

Seizing a lull in their discussion, Li Ximing turned to Lingdu and asked, "Senior… do you know anything of the Heavenly Glow Dao lineage?"

Houfu’s expression turned intriguing, his gaze suddenly profound. Lingdu, however, frowned. "Zhaojing, are you referring to… the Mount Luoxia of the Wuguang Xiexia?"

Li Ximing was asking on behalf of his elder brother and had merely taken the opportunity to inquire. He hadn't expected the conversation to immediately jump to Mount Luoxia, a name he was hearing for the first time. He paused, momentarily stunned, before quickly clarifying, "No, not that… I mean the Heavenly Glow Purple Mansion Dao lineage…"

Lingdu looked startled, then visibly relaxed, letting out a helpless laugh. "All Heavenly Glow in this world originates from one of two places: Mount Luoxia or Mount Duan. While they seem to be two separate locations, they are, in fact, enjoyed exclusively by that single individual. If you are speaking of the Heavenly Glow Purple Mansion lineage… that, too, is someone else's private property. It is something the vast majority of lineages simply do not possess."

Li Ximing offered some flattery. "This junior knows such things can't be found elsewhere. Most lineages naturally wouldn't have it. But an ancient, profound, and unfathomable lineage like yours, Senior, surely surpasses all others… so I thought I would ask."

Houfu, however, sighed, his gaze holding a deep, unspoken meaning. "Zhaojing, you are thinking too wishfully. We have nothing related to the Heavenly Glow."

He spoke cryptically, leaving Li Ximing to look up in surprise, but neither cultivator seemed willing to elaborate. Just then, someone else arrived in the grove. Dantai Muming strode up quickly. He waited until Houfu finished speaking and the three looked his way before reporting respectfully, "We have guided Daoist Friend Xia through the clan acknowledgment rites and had her read the biography of Senior Brother Yu. She has changed her attire and is waiting quietly in the grove."

"Good." Lingdu replied with a smile. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing likely has further instructions. Let her come up."

Li Ximing understood this was his cue; he likely shouldn't overstay his welcome. He reflected internally.

'I really have stayed too long. I received the benefits, and the Nine Mounds lineage has treated me exceptionally well. Staying longer would be impolite. It's best to depart soon.'

Soon, Xia Shouyu ascended. She was dressed in a white top and a gray skirt, adorned with shells that chimed softly—the typical attire of an Eastern Sea cultivator. Li Ximing beckoned her over and retrieved two scrolls from his sleeve, one red and one gold.

"Take these two scrolls back with you," he instructed. "The red scroll confirms your marriage. The gold one is a personal letter from my hand. Deliver them both directly to Elder Xuanxuan at the lake."

Whatever Xia Shouyu was feeling, her face remained respectful as she bowed. "Many thanks to the Daoist Master for bestowing this marriage! This junior will certainly deliver these to the Elder’s hands!"

Li Ximing then turned back to Houfu and bowed. "I must trouble you, Senior!"

Houfu gave a slight nod. Li Ximing gestured for Xia Shouyu to stand behind him, watching as Houfu replied, "Zhaojing, you are too courteous. Just call me Houfu… In recent years, the White Victory Dao has been clashing with the Great And Illustrious Peace Temple, shaking the Great Western Plateau. The Sword Gate requested aid from my Great Xiukui Monastery. I must travel west to the Great Western Plateau anyway, so this is directly on my path. It is no trouble at all."

Li Ximing nodded, but Lingdu looked utterly astonished, his eyes widening. "The White Victory Dao? Do you mean one of the three who was born in Splitreed Island? This is extraordinary! Truly extraordinary..."

Li Ximing knew a fair bit about ancient history, and the splitting in Splitreed Island wasn't exactly a great secret. In those days, Yingze had split the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch into three. One of those parts was the demon Xiyan, located right in the Great Western Plateau…

Although he didn't know why Lingdu immediately connected the White Victory Dao to the Xiyan Demon Monarch, it didn't stop Li Ximing from realizing the gravity of the matter. He lowered his voice. "Senior means to say… Lesser Yang…"

Houfu merely shook his head. Even though Li Ximing had spoken with extreme caution, Houfu raised a finger to his lips, his expression grave. "Not necessarily," he replied. "It is just that the White Victory Dao has risen rapidly. First, their leader achieved the Diverse Mansion realm over a decade ago… then, a year ago, another of the 'Five Brightnesses' perfected a divine ability. Two consecutive Purple Mansion cultivators have emerged, reversing the situation. The Merciful Ones of the Great And Illustrious Peace Temple can no longer hold them back."

He paused, adding, "Although there has been no sign of *that specific individual*, as a Lesser Yang lineage, it is possible this is his handiwork."

Lingdu’s expression was grim. He likewise raised a finger, but this time, he pointed toward the sky. "Do not forget, there is another Lesser Yang beyond the heavens. If *he* was the one injured, it is entirely possible it triggered anomalous activity from the other two."

The three looked at each other, speechless.

While those two dared to speak of such things, Li Ximing dared not listen. After all, one represented a Supreme Yang and Supreme Yin lineage, the other a tyrant of the overseas Nine Mounds lineage. He, Li Ximing, was a down-and-out cultivator with no one backing him. Seeing the silence descend, he felt a chill creep up his spine and quickly bowed.

"I will not impose any longer. Many thanks to the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain for the spirit fire. I will remember this kindness..."

After exchanging a few more pleasantries—Lingdu offered only a token request for him to stay—he was escorted to the mountain's edge. The farewell felt rushed; the elder was clearly distracted, and all three were lost in their own thoughts. Only Houfu added one last comment.

"By escorting Xia Shouyu back to the lake, people will inevitably assume I have met with you, Zhaojing. I personally fear neither Yehui nor Changxiao… but if Tinglan comes asking, I will find it difficult to answer her."

Evidently, as fellow Supreme Yang lineages, Purple Smoke and Xiukui shared a decent relationship. Houfu felt uncomfortable deceiving her outright.

Li Ximing considered this. He still needed to build the grand array and truly shouldn't leave a fellow Daoist Master hanging. Yet, exposing his own movements was troublesome; he couldn't give an exact location that Changxiao might exploit. After careful thought, he drew a jade pendant from his sleeve and handed it to Houfu.

"I am traveling nearby in the East A-Wang Sea. If Daoist Friend Tinglan wishes to find me, tell her to come to the border where the East A-Wang Sea meets the Peacock Sea. Have her crush this talisman, and I will naturally go to her."

Houfu understood and accepted the pendant. Li Ximing bid farewell to the two and sped away, flying across the ocean until he reached the neighboring East A-Wang Sea. The chaos here had somewhat subsided. Several Demon Generals had carved out territories, and smaller factions had begun to grow. The sea region looked relatively peaceful.

He carefully inspected his dharma body, ensuring no trace of Lesser Yang brilliance remained, and muttered, "That came out of nowhere, talking about such terrifying things… You mention one, you have to bring up all three, and that drags out another seven or eight..."

Li Ximing scanned the area, then dived deep into the sea, landing on the ocean floor. He immediately activated the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. Enveloped in a pure aura of Earth Virtue brilliance, he phased through the earth, piloting the Earth-Tiger shuttle deep underground until he located a fire vein and settled within it.

Using the power of the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, he carved out a cave, channeled the fire vein into it, and placed his alchemy cauldron atop the heat. Only then did Li Ximing sit down.

Before he could even act, he suddenly felt his Shengyang Acupoint turn ice-cold, as if a frigid force had smashed down upon him. Sparks exploded in his mind, his vision blurred, and a frosty qi surged up his face, forcing tears from his eyes.

"This…"

'It's over!'

It felt as if a giant hand had seized his spiritual sense, yanking it instantly into the infinite void beyond the heavens.

Suddenly, he saw blazing suns and twinkling stars, endless white jade immortal palaces rising like scales, clouds veiling the moon, and the divine light of the Golden Crow soaring amidst phoenixes. Twelve bridges of gold spanned a celestial lake, and tens of thousands of halls glittered…

The scenery flashed past in an instant. Before Li Ximing could see clearly, he plunged back into darkness, as if standing in a deep, subterranean palace. Specks of light dotted the gloom ahead, where a single stone bridge crossed the void. A man in gray robes, stained with blood, stood upon it. Peering closer, Li Ximing recognized a steady, calm, middle-aged face.

Wang Quwan.

The dim void seemed to contain only this single, empty bridge suspended in darkness. Wang Quwan was looking up, gripping a blue-gold treasured sword. From far above, strands of silk-like white brilliance descended, seemingly connected to some profound Dao trove.

Li Ximing’s vision zoomed rapidly toward that white brilliance. Countless wondrous treasures, Daoist scriptures, and dharma artifacts flashed before his eyes, dazzling and multicolored, until his focus finally locked onto the deepest object—a spirit sword hanging in the void.

The sword was simple and dignified, colored a pale gray without a single etching. It was a stark contrast to the luxurious and complex refinement styles of the current age. The cross-guard was nearly the same width as the blade itself, giving the entire sword a straight, uniform profile.

What truly captivated Li Ximing was the sword's sole decoration: a bright white spirit stone set into its pommel.

The familiar aura radiating from that stone caused the Talisman Seed within his Shengyang Acupoint to tremble violently, a sensation that made Li Ximing shudder. This was not the first time he had felt this. All those years ago, when Yu Muxian had arrived by boat, the young Li Ximing had been touched by that fragment and fainted. This was that same feeling.

A realization struck Li Ximing like lightning, flashing a single phrase through his mind:

'An Immortal Mirror fragment!'

The white brilliance rapidly receded, and the encroaching darkness dissipated. Li Ximing felt the world spin, and he slowly opened his eyes. He saw the dim stone walls of the cave. The dark alchemy cauldron stood before him. The crackling sound of the fire vein returned to his ears. He was back in the subterranean grotto.

He first performed a deep, formal bow before standing up. His face was a ghastly mix of blue and white as he exhaled a plume of frosty air. Forcing down his discomfort, he fumbled in his storage bag for a jade box.

"Cough!"

The moment he opened his mouth, several pale white vines burst forth, growing frantically. In an instant, they climbed his jaw, and several tendrils draped down like hanging orchids, blooming mid-air into clusters of pure white flowers.

A cold fragrance filled the cave.

He reached up, grasped the spirit object, and plucked the entire growth out, root and all. He placed it in the jade box, and without sparing it a second glance, immediately began checking his body.

'I wasn’t struck by a Supreme Yin divine ability… it's just a lingering chill… So it was the Immortal Mirror. I really thought I had angered a True Monarch by recklessly discussing them, that one just happened to be nearby, and I was about to be obliterated by Fruition Attainment pressure…'

He breathed a sigh of relief. The chill in his heart faded, replaced by shock and wild joy.

'Wang Quwan... that was Wang Quwan! That place must be the Secret Diffusion Dao trove, and the Secret Diffusion trove contains an Immortal Mirror fragment!'

'This place is countless thousands of miles from Jiangbei, yet I was able to glimpse the Secret Diffusion scenery… How powerful… And that place with the immortal palaces and pavilions… could that be beyond the heavens?'

He surmised that his sense had first linked to somewhere beyond the heavens, then followed the connection between that place and the Immortal Mirror down toward Jiangbei, observing the Secret Diffusion inheritance, before finally piercing into the Secret Diffusion Dao trove and perceiving the fragment's location...

'Truly a divine and mysterious technique…'

Suppressing his shock, Li Ximing quickly realized he had missed the immediate opportunity.

'The opening of the Secret Diffusion Dao trove must be timed. This time, it must be because the Chengyun Gate and the other sects gathered the required inheritances and opened it for the first time... Though I missed this window, if I just wait, there will be another chance…'

'If that's the case, raising my own Secret Diffusion successor is completely out of the question; it's far too late. I absolutely cannot allow that treasured sword to sit inside that trove for ten or twenty years… The only path is to fully support Wang Quwan…'

He sat silently, his gaze heavy.

'Wang Quwan… Wang Quwan… Is this the hand of destiny, or the pull of karma?'

Li Ximing slowly reined in his thoughts. Back home, Li Jiangqian also possessed a talisman and must have sensed this event. With him managing affairs from the clan, arrangements would certainly be made. Li Ximing didn't need to rush back himself.

Only then did he turn his gaze to the jade box. Inside, the branch of "Moon Orchid" remained vibrant, eight small flowers blooming upon it, radiating a faint white halo.

'A fine resource for the Purple Mansion realm.'

Li Ximing’s judgment was worlds apart from what it once was. With the Profound Light concealed between his brows, he could identify the grade of many things. Although he couldn't name the Supreme Yin spirit object before him, he could still recognize it as a Purple Mansion-grade resource, similar to the Horn Wood Golden Tassel.

'This is the perfect time to start alchemy. And I have another great medicine… right here on me.'

Steeling his resolve, he felt around his own body, precisely locating his Dantian. He pressed his index finger and thumb against the spot and spread them apart.

*Huala!*

The skin and flesh of his lower abdomen stretched open, revealing the Qi sea within. A brilliant golden radiance shone out, illuminating the entire cave.

Li Ximing quickly rolled up his other sleeve, plunged that hand into the opening, and felt around for a moment before slowly extracting something.

It was a glistening white pearl, smooth and round, with a crystal-like luster. It was only the size of a grain of rice, but the moment it left his abdomen, it instantly swelled to the size of a fist, releasing an intoxicatingly clear fragrance.

Li Ximing almost lost his grip on it. His divine abilities flared, and he invoked the suppressive power of Audience with the Celestial Gate to halt the pearl's expansion.

"Hmph!"

This object was the refined spiritual qi from the Shade-Cleansing Pool, tempered by the Valley Wind Guide-Fire. If a Foundation Establishment cultivator had this, they would be stuck with it in their Qi sea, unable to use it or exhaust it. Even for a Purple Mansion cultivator, it would normally take a very long time to safely draw out.

Fortunately, Li Ximing had a flexible mind; digging it out by hand was the fastest way. Now, the hand holding the wound open relaxed. With a single wipe, the opening healed completely, leaving not even a scar.

'But without the amplification from the Valley Wind Guide-Fire, my personal suppression is far weaker.'

Looking at the orb in his hand, Li Ximing immediately began assessing it with his old professional eye.

'This is pure Pure Qi, the divine ability essence of the Lesser Yin lineage, mixed with a hint of Bright Yang from its time in my Qi sea. If I use this as the base for a pill… I should be able to refine a furnace of spirit pills that greatly enhances divine abilities.'

'After all, this qi-pill requires my constant suppression. If I let go, it would likely erupt into a veritable mountain of spiritual qi. If I don't refine it, just carrying it around is not a solution.'

His expression suddenly turned strange.

'Well, it's not that there are *no* other ways to carry it… I could always cut myself open again and stuff it back in for the Valley Wind Guide-Fire to manage…'

That was, of course, a joke. While the Valley Wind Guide-Fire could suppress it effortlessly, the object was now the size of a fist. It wouldn't fit back into his Qi sea even if he forced it.

Although the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was not yet refined, he possessed the Valley Wind Guide-Fire, and Li Ximing reckoned he could handle it one-handed. He pulled out the crimson bowl and flicked it with a finger.

*Peng!*

The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire erupted again, its bright red glow illuminating the cave. Li Ximing took a gentle breath.

*Huala!*

The entire sheet of flame eagerly flew from the bowl, surging toward his nostrils. In a mere instant, the bright red light vanished from the cave, leaving only the empty, crimson-glazed bowl in his palm.

The moment the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire entered his body, it tried to flee. But the Valley Wind Guide-Fire instantly blazed to life, lunging like a starving beast, and bound the new fire with an incredibly powerful pull. The flame flickered brightly, and just like that, Li Ximing had complete control.

He easily guided the flame down, settling it into his Juque Palace. The Bright Yang Purple Flame and his True Fire showed no conflict; they actively made space, flanking the new True Fire as if protecting it.

Only then did Li Ximing open his eyes. His pupils flashed bright red, then pale gold, before slowly returning to their normal color.

"Good!"

Looking at the Shade-Cleansing Qi Pill and the Moon Orchid in his hands, Li Ximing felt immense satisfaction and began pondering the refinement method.

'I have no corresponding recipe. Refining them separately would require my own formulation, and the results would likely be nothing special. It's best to refine them together. Pure Qi, Lesser Yin, Supreme Yin, and Bright Yang. There are no conflicts. This can become a great pill!'

'However, alchemy demands a hierarchy: Monarch, Minister, Assistant, and Envoy. This Moon Orchid is a great medicine, but the Shade-Cleansing Qi Pill is also a great medicine, their qualities equal. If one becomes the Monarch, the other becomes an overly powerful Minister of a different nature. Such a refinement cannot succeed. Even if forced, it would waste the medicinal properties.'

The Xiao family's alchemy was the traditional Jiangnan technique. Li Ximing had long since surpassed Xiao Yuansi's alchemy Dao. The notable refinement methods Li Ximing possessed were few: the techniques for the [Xuanque Jingxin] and [Tianyi Cuiyuan] pills were just different recipes using similar methods. That left the complete alchemy system he'd obtained from Sea's Cape: the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art.

'The Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art demands high Dao comprehension, which isn't a problem, but it uses *destiny* as the primary ingredient… Hsss…'

Li Ximing was already a master of alchemy; his insight surpassed the vast majority of Purple Mansion cultivators in Jiangnan. After acquiring the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art, his vision and skill in the Dao of alchemy had risen to another level entirely.

Jiangnan alchemy used *nature*—that is, the medicinal properties and affinities of spirit items were combined to create a pill. The alchemist was tested on their dharma power, cultivation base, and divine abilities. The Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art used *destiny*. It combined the karmic destiny and life-force of the ingredients. The alchemist was tested on their Dao comprehension, their personal fate, and their hierarchical status in the world.

'Spirit items possess both nature and destiny. The spiritual status of that Moon Orchid is terrifyingly high. But the Shade-Cleansing Qi Pill is essentially just solidified dharma power. It has nature, but no destiny. Even after passing through my body, its destiny is worlds below that of the Moon Orchid!'

'If I refine this using the Heavenly Heart Oneness method, the Moon Orchid is the undeniable Monarch medicine. The Qi Pill is its iron-clad Minister! Lesser Yin assisting Supreme Yin—it is a perfect match! Furthermore, the orchid grew from my mouth, and the qi pill was born in my abdomen. They are fundamentally of one body, their destinies intertwined, a true heaven-sent opportunity. Who else in this world but me could possibly refine this pill?'

Li Ximing was struck by sudden enlightenment. Through his own exploration, he felt he was dimly perceiving a higher realm in the Dao of alchemy.

Fired up with inspiration, he struck the cauldron. The bright red Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire erupted, swirling around the vessel before diving beneath it, converging into a vortex of scarlet flame.

He was more focused than ever before. He deliberately retrieved a [White Jade Spirit Wood]—a gift he had received when breaking through to the Purple Mansion realm and had saved ever since—and tossed it into the True Fire first.

Then, his storage bag pulsed. Boxes long and short, jade vials large and small, all flew out, wrapped in his spiritual qi. Serpent Origin Spirit Water, [Wuxi Sand], [Yuanyang Spirit Essence]… all manner of spirit items flowed forth, leaping one after another into the furnace.

A viscous, bright purple medicinal liquid began to pool at the bottom of the cauldron. The Shade-Cleansing Qi Pill dropped into it and immediately threatened to erupt into a torrential storm of spiritual energy, intent on blowing the cauldron apart. The Profound Light between Li Ximing’s brows flared, and a white, suppressive divine ability slammed down, binding all the rampaging energy within the furnace.

Finally, the Moon Orchid fell inside. Li Ximing instantly sealed the lid, pressed both hands to the cauldron's sides, and enveloped it in his Bright Yang divine ability. He shut his eyes, focusing his full power on the task.

'This pill uses every ounce of knowledge I have accumulated. It will undoubtedly be the pinnacle of the first half of my alchemy career!'

...

Southern Sea.

The Shitang Sea is the region of the Southern Sea with the least amount of land. Known as the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, it is bordered by the Southern Borderlands to its back, Songzhou to the east, and Lufang to the south. Aside from the Azure Pond Sect's own North Dan Island, the region consists only of sparsely scattered small islands. Positioned between these major islands and having enjoyed recent peace and order, its trade has become increasingly prosperous.

North Dan was a land of beautiful scenery. At its center stood Elephant Mountain, rising six thousand feet. A grand palace sat atop its peak, bustling with cultivators coming and going. Yet, passing through this palace, one found a quieter pavilion in the rear courtyard where a man in white robes stood alone.

He had a noble, dignified appearance, a slightly long face, and brows set close to his eyes, giving him a generous and refined handsomeness. He held a sword level; it was bright white yet shimmered with a seven-colored radiance.

Potent sword qi brewed along the spine of the blade. He frowned slightly, his eyes shut tight, his face pale. Several breaths passed. The sword light pulsed erratically, threatening to erupt. Only then did his eyes snap open.

"Cough."

He coughed twice, and flakes of golden osmanthus petals tumbled from his robes, scattering on the ground in a golden halo.

Although he had clearly lost focus, the sword light had merely fluctuated rather than erupting violently, a testament to his profound mastery of both dharma arts and swordsmanship.

This man was the Master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, a direct descendant of the Moongaze Immortal Clan, and the current Lord of Shitang’s North Dan—Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow, Li Xizhi!

Li Xizhi quickly steadied himself, and the light on his sword immediately stabilized. With a flick of his other sleeve, the osmanthus petals on the ground were swept up, disappearing into a jade box that leaped from his waist, which he then tucked into his storage bag. All traces vanished in an instant.

He raised his brow, his eyes flashing with shock and suspicion.

'An Immortal Mirror fragment... Which disciple of my clan has touched upon this opportunity?'



# Chapter 812: The Jia-Yi Configuration

'Underground... a white light...'

He mused internally, 'The Chengyun Gate built an underground palace. I heard its deepest part lies beneath Xiaoshi Mountain. Perhaps it’s related to the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage... Secret Diffusion, Secret Diffusion... both are of the Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage. Their ancestors were the same branch.'

As the master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, Li Xizhi now possessed extensive knowledge. Although he couldn't access the core Dao repository of the Azure Pond Sect, over a decade of studying their vast collection of texts had still granted him a profound foundation.

'Earlier, I speculated the Immortal Mirror was an immortal artifact from the Moonlight Origin Mansion. But how is it suddenly connected to Mirrored-Mirage? Since the Moonlight Origin Mansion shares its source with the Supreme Yin Dao lineage, it definitely shouldn't be the same path as Mirrored-Mirage. If it is, then something is wrong...'

Li Xizhi pondered for a moment, sheathed his sword, and stepped out of the pavilion. He crossed through his residence and passed the threshold, arriving at another estate.

Li Xizhi’s grotto-mansion had two layers of restrictions, inner and outer. He didn't need servants waiting on him; rather, he was wary of anyone spying on his techniques. Thus, he kept no one within the grotto-mansion itself. Only upon entering the attached residence did he finally see figures. After passing through several more courtyards, a woman in palace attire greeted him.

"You've finished so early this time... did something happen?"

Li Xizhi replied: "I had a breakthrough earlier. It's a good thing."

The breakthrough Li Xizhi mentioned was, naturally, in the [Five-Color Sinking Expanse Sword Art]. This was a sword technique that emphasized both swordplay and Dharma Arts equally. Li Xizhi possessed the Talisman Qi [Rainbow Pierce Skyway], so cultivating in seclusion boosted his Dharma Arts, which in turn applied to this [Five-Color Sinking Expanse Sword Art].

This was an exceptionally difficult sword art, but Li Xizhi only needed to focus on practicing the swordplay. Not only was the difficulty massively reduced, but the process even showed faint signs of pulling his sword Dao cultivation upward in reverse. His long-stagnant sword Dao was advancing once again.

Yang Xiao'er had been his wife for many years, and Li Xizhi naturally understood her concerns. He placated her with a sentence, then extended his hand, palm up, and smiled.

"Look."

A bright, warm-white stream of light floated up from his palm, shifting into yellow and white hues. They interwove and roamed like the sky clearing after rain, a rainbow suddenly appearing, its colors blending, before condensing back into the warm-white light and sinking down.

Yang Xiao'er didn't feel the slightest sharpness from it. She blinked, then realized with joyous surprise: "Sword Essence?"

Li Xizhi smiled and nodded, speaking softly: "Years ago, when I descended on Dew Pot Island to fight for the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda, the dragon kin didn't intervene, but there were more than enough cultivators from the Southern Sea. While Dharma Arts are strong, they are easily countered by specialized artifacts. Now that I have Sword Essence, future matters... will be much more convenient."

Yang Xiao'er smiled and agreed. Her expression turning serious, she turned, retreated, and firmly shut the doors on both sides. The grand array activated. She then retrieved a talisman from her robes and pressed it to the door, causing dark light to flow across its surface.

Ensuring they were completely alone, she stepped forward and whispered: "I asked my family. The current spiritual aura is changing rapidly. With the demonic cultivators purged, life is flourishing. Small clans and sects are springing up like bamboo after the rain. The entire Shitang region is linked... The islands are almost all covered in Ginseng-Timber Wood... The family noticed."

The spiritual aura of the Southern Sea's Shitang region had always been Crossing Peril and Solidifying Enterprise. It was a pure Earth Virtue spiritual aura, beneficial to demonic cultivators and Earth Virtue, and balanced toward all Twelve Qi, yet it curiously did not suppress lightning. The rampage of demonic cultivators in recent years was inextricably linked to this aura. In the last few years, this aura had grown increasingly unstable and was already reaching its time of decline.

When a spiritual aura rises, it can uplift countless cultivators and nourish spiritual objects. But when it declines, it requires the sustenance of those same cultivators and the symbolism of spiritual items just to maintain its existence. Li Xizhi’s suppression of the Shitang demonic cultivators had severed the last thread keeping the aura clinging to life, accelerating its collapse.

This had forced the master of Thunder-Hearing Island to defy the Azure Pond Sect's pressure and personally attack Li Xizhi. In the end, even that Purple Mansion from Thunder-Hearing Island was suppressed in the Great Void by a single talisman from Yuanxiu. This affair was incredibly complex behind the scenes, but the story that circulated externally was merely that the Lord of Thunder-Hearing Island had challenged Li Xizhi and narrowly lost by a single move.

Even disciples of immortal sects could only vaguely perceive it as a conflict of interest between Shitang North Dan and Thunder-Hearing Island, or at best, part of the struggle between the righteous path and the demonic path. Only Li Xizhi and a select few others knew that Purple Mansions had actually clashed within the Great Void.

But Yuanxiu pushing Li Xizhi to the forefront immediately unsettled Yang Xiao'er. She began to investigate the true aim behind suppressing the demonic cultivators and altering the spiritual aura, returning to her sect several times to probe her family for information.

She brought up the Ginseng-Timber Wood, and Li Xizhi nodded, replying: "When I inspected Shitang back then, I saw that the Ginseng-Timber Wood the Lingu Family planted on the islands had already spread everywhere. I knew purging the demonic cultivators was just a matter of time. The Ginseng-Timber Wood is lush and vibrant, never withering through the seasons, an evergreen vine in this Southern Sea climate. Now these small clans and sects are rising... and sure enough, they've started raising the Lingu Family's Wu Oakworms..."

"Although the Lingu Family withdrew from this place, most of its lifelines are still held by the Azure Pond Sect... or rather, by the Lingu Family. Otherwise, why would they have given it up so easily? It’s just that this spiritual aura is constantly changing. I fear something is about to happen."

Yang Xiao'er's expression turned grave. She whispered, "This is only what's on the surface... There is another meaning. According to my brother's research, Ginseng-Timber Wood is pillar wood. In ancient times, this category was called Jia Wood. The Wu Oakworms are also aspected wood, wood of vibrant life and propagation, which is called Yi Wood. When the two combine, it is the Jia-Yi configuration. You pacified Shitang, and though not the head of the Azure Pond Sect, you are a pillar. Shitang is birthing new small clans, which is also propagation. This is also a Jia-Yi combination... There are too many such analogies. Looking back at when the Lingu Family ruled Shitang, most of the events fit this pattern."

"The elders in my family predict that the transformation of Shitang's spiritual aura will take at least another year or two... and there is a seventy percent chance it will transform into the [Jia-Yi Configuration]. It is shifting to favor Wood Virtue..."

Li Xizhi understood immediately. He let out a heavy breath and said, "Jia and Yi combine, taking the image of Metal. The [Jia-Yi Configuration] likely benefits Upright Wood. Daoist Master Yuanxiu and the Lingu Family have been cooperating for many years, not just one or two. I was just handling the cleanup... He wants to attempt the Golden Core realm in the Southern Sea... But he clearly only has four Divine Abilities. Has he cultivated a fifth?"

Yang Xiao'er lowered her gaze. "He probably couldn't find a fifth Dao lineage, but his lifespan is what it is. Even for a Wood Virtue cultivator, he doesn't have much time left. He has to make the attempt now, whether he's ready or not. Do you remember Anhuai Heaven? I heard the Dao repository of Anhuai Heaven was burned by Daoist Master Yuanxiu. Perhaps he already found a substitute for the fifth Divine Ability back then. He didn't want anyone else to know, so he ruthlessly burned it. Now, driven to desperation, he is preparing for a final gamble."

Li Xizhi rubbed his temples. "That makes sense. I heard that among the Three Yuans of the Azure Pond Sect, Daoist Master Yuansu had the highest talent, but lacked Dao lineages. Daoist Master Yuanxiu also far surpassed Yuanwu. Now he's attempting the Golden Core; even in death, he wants to go out with a bang. It’s just that if he dies, I'll be the one held over the fire."

Yang Xiao'er nodded silently. Chi Wei annihilated generations of geniuses, and Chi Buzi vanished. If Yuanxiu dies, the Azure Pond Sect will be left without a single Divine Ability cultivator. But, as a Supreme Yang Dao lineage, no one would dare offend them directly. Their overseas interests, however, would be impossible to protect...

Although Li Xizhi had a brother in the Purple Mansion realm and was himself a vital figure in the Azure Pond Sect, meaning Thunder-Hearing Island wouldn't dare touch him, the Shitang region he had governed for so many years would likely be lost.

What worried her more was Dantai Jin's attitude. She whispered, "Dantai Jin is acting as the Sect Master now. If something happens to Daoist Master Yuanxiu, and he doesn't transfer you back, husband, that will be real trouble... His backing from the Nine Mounds Dao lineage is not simple; they don't fear ordinary Purple Mansions!"

"It shouldn't come to that." Li Xizhi shook his head. "He won't leave me in this place. There are far more important places than the Southern Sea. Even if he wanted to gift Shitang to the demonic cultivators, sending the Lingu Family would be more appropriate. I am a stabilizing presence right now. Dantai Jin needs me... I only fear that the Miao Family and Changxiao are colluding. That would be troublesome."

As the couple was speaking, the dark light on the door suddenly trembled. Yang Xiao'er immediately fell silent. A few breaths later, a knock came:

"Knock knock... Sir, Lord Quan has returned to North Dan and wishes to report to you!"

Li Xizhi's interest stirred. He gave his wife a slight nod, calming her anxious mood, before pushing the door open and saying warmly:

"Have him bring the person up."

Soon, Quan Yuduan strode quickly into the estate, followed by a youth in black robes who looked around with some apprehension. Behind him was the sword-bearing Si Xunhui, while Li Wushao followed grimly at the very rear.

"Greetings, Master / Grandfather / Lord!"

Li Xizhi scanned the group first, not spotting Li Chenghuai. His expression unchanging, he pondered for a moment before nodding to Li Zhouluo with a smile.

"Seats!"

Once everyone was seated, Li Xizhi raised an eyebrow. "How did Chenghuai reply?"

Quan Yuduan presented a letter with both hands. "The Young Master did not reply, but he sent back this letter for you, Sir."

Li Xizhi accepted it, placing it on the desk without opening it. He smiled at Li Zhouluo. "Zhouluo, you must be weary from the road. This has been a hard journey. I have already prepared a residence for you. Go and rest first."

Li Zhouluo had no objections and nodded quickly. Li Wushao led him away. Li Xizhi was most concerned about the Immortal Mirror fragment. Logically, since he had just viewed the vision, there was no way Si Xunhui and the others should have exited so quickly. He frowned.

"Xunhui, what of the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage?"

Si Xunhui gave a wry smile and shook his head. "Master, we entered the underground palace and reached the deepest part. There was an altar inversely flooded with Converging Water, a world within itself... but inside it was total darkness, assaulted by water, fire, and lightning. Those Foundation Establishment cultivators went deeper, while we could only cling to the edge and endure. We collected one or two useless spiritual items and had no choice but to retreat."

Li Xizhi understood immediately. "It seems it requires at least a Foundation Establishment cultivation base... It's beyond our reach for now. It hasn't been easy for you either, holding out for several years. These years of being flooded by water, burned by fire, and struck by lightning have also been greatly beneficial to you. Go and cultivate..."

Si Xunhui bowed and presented a jade slip, saying respectfully: "I spent time on the journey recording all the obstacles within. It is all documented here. This can also serve as reconnaissance for the sect; perhaps it will fulfill another disciple's opportunity."

Li Xizhi chuckled and shook his head. Currently, the fastest cultivator of the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage was Si Xunhui himself; who else could cultivate it faster than a young master of the Si clan? The slip was of little value. He just waved his hand, dismissing him.

After Quan Yuduan also withdrew, Li Xizhi finally picked up the letter. He unfolded it and read, staring blankly for a long moment before refolding it with a long sigh.

"Hai..."

Yang Xiao'er emerged from the hall again. Li Xizhi ground some ink and said quietly, "The child wants to come out, but still has some lingering knots in his heart. I'll persuade him. I'll seize the opportunity these next few years to keep him by my side, and then have Zhouluo wed and send him back... When the tides rise in the Southern Sea, we won't have the good treatment we enjoy now!"

***

Moongaze Lake.

Dawn had just broken, its light flowing over thousands of homes. The continent was orderly. Golden light pooled on the floor tiles of the great hall.

Li Jiangqian, dressed in crimson robes, was pacing the hall. The policy of Merit Shelters and Dao Stipends had been implemented for several months, requiring the clan to supplement a massive amount of details and regulations. This, combined with the timing of the rites, left him pressed for time. Being a cautious man, he ultimately decided against risking the hunt for a Foundation Establishment Demon.

He reflected that it wasn't much of a loss. He had just broken through to Foundation Establishment, and receiving the rites now would only stabilize his cultivation and push him to the threshold of the mid-stage. It would be better to wait five or ten years, ideally receiving the rites while at the mid or late Foundation Establishment stage, where he would need to spend more time grinding his cultivation anyway.

'If it weren't that the Purple Mansion realm is too far off, and I lack complete certainty, it would be even better to condense a Divine Ability before receiving the rites! After all, there are shortcuts for Foundation Establishment cultivation, but there are no shortcuts for condensing Divine Abilities in the Purple Mansion realm... Even if there were, the cost would be enormous for only a ten or twenty percent boost. If the Talisman Qi's wondrous ability to boost cultivation could also be used at the Purple Mansion stage, it wouldn't just be saving three to five years of effort!'

Although there was no Foundation Establishment Demon to sacrifice, the rites were still overwhelmingly complex. With two major affairs stacked together, he had been run off his feet for months.

Of course, as the recipient of the talisman seed, he too had sensed the phenomenon days ago. After the initial joy, only a vague anxiety remained.

'I heard cultivators from several sects have returned, and Si Xunhui also returned fully loaded, already taking Uncle Zhouluo to the Southern Sea. Yet, there’s still no word from Wang Quwan.'

It wasn't that Li Jiangqian cared for the man; he was currently the clan's only Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage. If he perished in that underground palace, who knew how many years it would be before they could retrieve that treasured sword!

He mulled it over. Just as Miaoshui finished healing from her injuries and emerged from seclusion, her cultivation having greatly improved, the clan's available Foundation Establishment manpower eased up. He dispatched Miaoshui to Chengshui Marsh to provide support. After all, that woman used to operate in Jiangbei before her surrender; she understood the dynamics of various places and was less likely to attract trouble.

He was pondering this when Cui Jueyin entered the hall, bowed, and reported:

"Clan Head..."

Li Jiangqian had summoned him. He politely bade him rise and smiled.

"I heard something these past few days. Several cultivator families in the clan's West Residence have either hired guest elders, invited other clan members, or simply taken the field themselves to instruct their disciples in Dao debates."

Cui Jueyin replied, "This subordinate has also heard. This matter... is difficult to criticize..."

"It's fine," Li Jiangqian said. "But we cannot let them monopolize it. Please organize several guest elders to also establish an academy in Milin. Offer free instruction to the mortal clan members in their studies... Once the first few batches have passed their examinations, we can rotate these personnel out."



# Chapter 813: Within the Secret Diffusion

Cui Jueyin acknowledged the order. Li Jiangqian shook his head and said, "With the Purple Smoke Gate shifting manpower to the Eastern Sea, our production speed slows daily. But since the Daoist Master hasn't returned, delays are acceptable. The clan is stable; these are minor issues. Protector Cui, you are often on the Eastern Shore. Do you know what’s happening with Jiangxia?"

Li Jiangqian pointed to several letters on his desk, their format indicating they were almost certainly from Li Jiangxia. He frowned. "For several months now, the families on the Eastern Shore and the autonomous territories in the wilderness have gone silent. The number of disciples coming to the forest has plummeted. This is supposed to be the triennial intake, yet almost no one has shown up... This is no simple matter."

The Eastern Shore comprised 118 families, and their autonomous territories extended into the wilderness. Li Jiangxia had spent years chipping away at this region. Although they had been struck once by the Capital immortals Dao, their foundation remained unshaken. Though called the Eastern Shore, the name no longer covered the scope of their influence. If the entire wilderness were divided into five parts, the western two were under the Li family's remote control.

These territories were crucial sources of spiritual materials. Now that they needed to forge the Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails, this supply line was even more critical. He couldn't ignore it.

Cui Jueyin nodded. "I have received word... and I have determined the cause."

"In recent years, the Sacred Writ Gate in the eastern Shanji Prefecture has stabilized its foothold and begun recruiting widely. This group of demonic cultivators seems to be imitating the Chengyun Gate. With the Purple Smoke Gate backing them, they intend to transition to a righteous path..."

"They are desperately short on low-level cultivators, so their standards are low. Their main requirement is a 'clean background,' and they prefer cultivators from Jiangnan... Shanji Prefecture is blocked to the north by the Xuanmiao Temple and flanked by Supreme Yang lineages. Only the wilderness has a large population of cultivators... but the wilderness is full of rogue cultivators, a mixed bag with scattered and disorganized lineages. Even with the Sacred Writ Gate's low standards... few qualify."

"However, the wilderness borders the Eastern Shore. As it happens, the Eastern Shore families have spent years cultivating disciples according to the season, preparing them for the forest's recruitment. They focused on solidifying cultivation and building strong foundations, not rushing their training. When the Sacred Writ Gate opened its gates wide, they all flocked east to try their luck."

Beyond the Eastern Shore lay the autonomous lands, so those families primarily offered tribute through mining and planting. Unlike the prefectures on the lake, which were clearly internal territory, there was no need for the kind of diplomacy used with Ding Mu. After hearing the explanation, Li Jiangqian didn't seem anxious.

He nodded. "It makes sense. My family already has too many guest elders, too many rules, and not much enjoyment. Their future prospects here are far worse than with the Sacred Writ Gate. How could our offer compare to the comfort of being a disciple in a Purple Mansion Realm sect?"

Cui Jueyin bowed. "The Clan Head speaks truly... However, the Sacred Writ Gate lineage is only using them as fillers. They'll enter as outer disciples, lacking cultivation time and resources. It won't necessarily be better..."

"That's not important... Everyone has their own ambitions. We aren't lacking one or two batches of people." Li Jiangqian raised his eyes, his gaze settling heavily on the map scroll on the table. "What I fear is that they join the Sacred Writ Gate one by one. Today they take this family, tomorrow that one. If all one hundred and eighteen families are taken away, the east will be strengthened, but what about our west?"

Cui Jueyin nodded hesitantly and spoke softly, "The Third Young Master has been cultivating his influence there for many years. Perhaps we should integrate the Eastern Shore and wilderness region and establish a Prefecture Peak... But I fear this will make all those families anxious... It would not be easy to manage."

The crimson-robed youth shook his head. "Prefecture Peaks cannot be expanded lightly, much less swallow over a hundred families at once. This is about our family's reputation. Those Eastern Shore families exist to give the families bordering the lake someone lower-ranked to look down upon; it’s a method of uniting our core vassals by giving them superiority."

"Furthermore, these families are remnants from the era of the Jiang and Yu clans. When the Yu family weakened, they couldn't be touched, fine. But why didn't the Jiang family act? Why didn't the Xiao family? The Azure Pond Sect rule forbidding sects from crossing prefectural boundaries is not just empty words; it originates from the ancient Moonlight Origin Mansion. Under the Mansion's governance, only a true Sect can operate across prefectures. Even the Purple Smoke Gate must keep to its designated borders."

"Secondly, it avoids creating a direct border with other Purple Mansion powers... My family has the forest to manage these families; the Xiao family has Mount Yu. It is the same structure."

Li Jiangqian pondered this, looking at the map. "The wilderness also borders the Xiao family, near Mount Yu. Many must be going there to cultivate as well. Yet the Lixia Xiao family has not reacted... This makes things difficult."

He looked up. "Do all those families have people serving in the forest? Immediately revoke their positions. For those who went to the Sacred Writ Gate but failed the entrance, the forest will not accept them either. I will send someone east to ask questions. That Dai Jinquan of the Sacred Writ Gate seems reasonable. We will ask first."

***

Li Jiangqian waved Cui Jueyin away. Finally, a person ascended from the hall below. Dili Guang had followed Li Zhouluo to the Southern Sea, so this attendant was from the Dou family. He bowed.

"Reporting to the Clan Head, Guest Elder Miaoshui has returned."

Li Jiangqian looked up, concerned. "Alone? Or with Guest Elder Wang?"

The man replied, "Three returned together. They are already in the side courtyard, and are said to be heavily injured."

Li Jiangqian frowned and immediately descended. He arrived just as the three were approaching. Miaoshui’s aura was stable, though her robes were ragged. She bowed first. Wang Quwan followed behind her, sword at his waist, his face pale.

The last person was a stranger, his face covered in cold sweat and his clothes stained with blood. A golden, armor-like energy had invaded his body, freezing his limbs purple and making him stiff as he bowed.

Li Jiangqian let out a hearty laugh and stepped down from the dais, taking Wang Quwan’s hand. "Quwan, you are truly a peerless talent! You have returned safely, just as I expected!"

He then turned to the stranger, perplexed. "And this is..."

As Li Jiangqian began to ask, Wang Quwan cupped his fist. "This is Daoist Shouding from Mount Jingyi. We fought enemies together within the earth palace. He was injured when we escaped that perilous place. Considering the long road back to the Eastern Sea, and knowing we must pass through the territory of the Chunyi Dao Gate, I feared an ambush. Thus, I invited him here to the lake to rest."

'Mount Jingyi!'

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian immediately scrutinized the man. This Daoist Shouding looked young, with narrow eyes and an unimpressive demeanor. Perhaps he was suffering the backlash of a technique, as his hair and beard looked somewhat withered. Wounded by that golden energy, he couldn't even speak.

During the Profound Peak incident years ago, Changxi had gifted Yuezhou Island to Mount Jingyi. They should have been allies of the Profound Peak faction. Yet Mount Jingyi had never sent a single person, nor a single resource. They left the Kong family to struggle alone in Jiangnan, which indirectly led to Li Ximing being completely trapped. To put it unkindly, Sumian had at least spoken up; Daoist Master Xuanyi hadn't even opened her mouth. She hadn't so much as passed wind.

The core Profound Peak lineage despised them for this. While the Xuanmiao Temple hadn't suffered losses, Sumian was equally displeased with Xuanyi. Since his own family had been harmed by the affair, Li Jiangqian had nothing good to say about Mount Jingyi either.

Yet, of all the families in Jiangnan, this man had met Wang Quwan. And now he was here, delivered to the Li family. Only Li Jiangqian, with his deep political cunning, could maintain a smiling, courteous expression.

"So, it is a guest from the immortal Mount Jingyi. This is only proper. Please, rest in a grotto-mansion... If you require any resources, you need only ask."

Daoist Shouding’s face was purple, his lips trembling. He managed a strained sound of acknowledgment, then coughed up a mouthful of blood, unable to even offer polite pleasantries. Li Jiangqian had Miaoshui escort the man away but bid Wang Quwan to sit in the hall. Only then did he return to his seat, a plan forming.

'I wonder if this fellow's mouth is tight. Since he's from Mount Jingyi, I must try to find out... probe him indirectly, and see what kind of relationship Changxi and Xuanyi truly have.'

Aloud, he smiled. "Congratulations on your return... How were things inside the earth palace?"

As he spoke, his gaze rested on Wang Quwan, heavy with meaning.

'Based on his actions, he must have spoken a great deal with that Shouding in the palace. As a disciple of Jingyi, Shouding must understand the secrets of the Secret Diffusion lineage. The question is, did Wang Quwan manage to learn anything?'

At his question, Wang Quwan quickly bowed. He retrieved a large box from his sleeve and opened it before him. Inside rested a red pearl chain and a long, earth-yellow shield—the very Crimson Orb Jade and Hundred-Stone Spirit Shield he had borrowed.

She reported, "Clan Head, the earth palace contains deeper mysteries. We traveled to the lowest level, entered an earth vein, and then another vein beyond that, where we found a pool of Converging Water. It contained a universe within."

"Upon entering that pool, we found a palace inscribed with the words 'The Grand Secret Mirage-Vault.' The long plaques on either side had been stolen. The moment we passed the palace, water, fire, and lightning descended upon us. We flew and shuttled through it... for an entire year."

"The water, fire, and lightning were weak at first, but the water was Converging Water and the fire was Merging Fire. It burned hotter and hotter, and the lightning shattered our techniques. Fortunately, I had the two artifacts the family granted me—especially the Crimson Orb Jade—and my Floating Cloud Body supporting me. Only then did I pass."

Li Jiangqian felt something was wrong. 'A Grotto-Heaven? But what kind of Grotto-Heaven traps Foundation Establishment cultivators for a year and a half while they are still flying? How could it possibly be that large?'

Wang Quwan continued, "Past the trial of elements, we saw a stone bridge. According to Daoist Shouding, the bridge was crafted from an Wu Earth spiritual material. The entire bridge was covered by a great array that suppressed spiritual sense. I groped my way to the midpoint and found a stone stele inscribed with the three words: 'Code of Golden Manifestation.' A box containing water was granted from the sky. I took it, but the path ahead vanished, and I was forced to retreat."

"When I returned, I found Shouding. He said that 'Code of Golden Manifestation' required a Metal-Virtue Dharma Art to break. I have not learned one, so I turned back. But the exit path had changed. A crowd of people inside seemed to be fighting over something. I found a place to hide. After half a year or so, a large group moved off in one direction, and I seized the chance to escape."

"But the moment we emerged from the pool of Converging Water, a group of demonic cultivators ambushed us. Thankfully, the artifacts in our hands were powerful... but Daoist Shouding suffered greatly... The demonic cultivators saw his higher cultivation level and assumed the leader must have the treasures, so they focused all their attacks on him... He even used up the talismans his master had given him."

Li Jiangqian listened silently, then asked, "This Shouding from Mount Jingyi... how did he come to be with you?"

Wang Quwan replied succinctly, "He was severely injured but knew the way out. Shouding led me to the exit, and I protected him along the way."

Curiosity sparked in Li Jiangqian. 'Xuanyi understands the Secret Diffusion that well? It seems that if we want that treasured sword, Mount Jingyi could be a useful asset...'

After finishing his report, he bowed slightly, retrieved another box from his storage bag, and opened it before Li Jiangqian, revealing a light, translucent spiritual liquid.

"I did not recognize this spiritual item, but I brought it back for the family."

Li Jiangqian immediately frowned. "This is an opportunity you earned. What nonsense are you speaking?"

Only then did he glance at it, recognizing it instantly. "This is Clear Origin Spirit Water. It can be used to cultivate ocular techniques. You keep it. It is exactly one portion, and it will be of great use to you!"

Before Wang Quwan could reply, Li Jiangqian waved his hand dismissively. "Anything obtained from a Dao repository belongs entirely to you."

Wang Quwan hesitated a moment but finally put the item away. He bowed deeply and said in a low voice, "Clan Head... I noticed one other thing... I fought many people within the earth palace. The deeper we went into the veins, the stronger the cultivators became, yet their Immortal Foundations grew increasingly monotonous. There seemed to be only a few types. I privately asked Daoist Shouding, and he claimed that those who enter the earth palace with similar Dao lineages naturally gather together..."

Li Jiangqian remained noncommittal, unsure if he was telling the truth or repeating a fabrication. He rubbed the jade cup in his hand, appearing to make a decision. Finally, he spoke.

"As I thought..."

Wang Quwan looked puzzled. Li Jiangqian shook his head. "This matter concerns the Purple Mansion realm. I have a few speculations... which I can share with you, Quwan."

Wang Quwan immediately bowed, clearly having harbored these doubts for a long time.

Li Jiangqian said seriously, "If I am not mistaken, that earth palace was built by the Chengyun Gate. The demonic cultivators waiting outside were also their people. They discovered a specific Dao lineage underground, one that requires specific Immortal Foundations to enter... so they distributed tokens far and wide to those with the right foundations... letting those people enter the grotto for them, only to kill them when they emerged."

His expression darkened. "When the Floating Cloud Cave was destroyed, its techniques and resources were sent here by the other two caves. The technique you cultivate came from the Brahma Cloud Cave, which is backed by the Chengyun Gate... It seems their original plan was to give it to one of our family's disciples, lure them to that pool of Converging Water, and kill them... Divination is likely blocked in that place. Fortunately, Quwan, you were cautious and did not fight them for treasure... and the Daoist Master granted you a pill, allowing you to reach Foundation Establishment, which is how you escaped intact."

Wang Quwan froze, a flicker of shock passing over him.

Li Jiangqian smiled, shaking his head. "But the Daoist Master is far-sighted, beyond anything you or I could know. Perhaps he already saw through Chengyun Gate's scheme. He values you highly, so he specially granted you the pill for a battlefield breakthrough, leaving them entirely empty-handed... What was a minor trick by the Chengyun Gate instead became your destined opportunity..."

Li Jiangqian had twisted the order of events, lightly inserting Li Ximing's name with casual confidence, deftly papering over the family's failure to warn him sooner. Shock slowly dawned on Wang Quwan’s face. He processed the implications and let out a long breath.

Li Xuanxuan had genuinely given him the artifacts to protect his life. Neither Li Jiangqian nor Li Zhouluo had involved themselves in his gains, making their attitude clear. Wang Quwan bowed deeply. "My only regret is that my cultivation is shallow. I could not fight for more and wasted the opportunity the Daoist Master gave me..."

"That is nothing," Li Jiangqian smiled. "Based on your description, that place is not somewhere a few Foundation Establishment cultivators can explore in one trip. Go find Sun Bai for healing first. I will write a letter and ask the master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion. We will definitely gain something from this."

# Chapter 814: Marriage

Li Jiangqian dismissed Wang Quwan to tend to his injuries. After a while, a woman emerged from a side hall, dressed in white robes over a pale cyan skirt. Seeing her, Li Jiangqian finally offered a genuine smile. "Greetings, Aunt Xinghan. And congratulations."

Li Xinghan had only just emerged from her seclusion. She noticed her grand-nephew had already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm and returned his smile with a nod. "I should be the one congratulating you. I just came out and heard what happened with the Sacred Writ Gate... How utterly arrogant."

"Not entirely," Li Jiangqian said, shaking his head. He dismissed the surrounding cultivators and secured the doors. A slight smile touched his lips. "This incident proves the Sacred Writ Gate will never be a significant threat. Daoist Master Zhu Gong might be competent in cultivation, but she is useless at managing a sect. Her followers are nothing but wine-sacks and rice-bags. At their core, they remain overseas demonic cultivators; they don't understand the rules of Jiangnan, nor do they know how to play by them."

"I can tell Zhu Gong is trying to imitate the Chengyun Gate's playbook. But she is not Daoist Master Changyun, and she doesn't have a Zhong Qian working for her. Why was the Chengyun Gate able to transition to the righteous path so quickly? Because Daoist Master Changyun’s demonic cultivators were those who surrendered during the North-South war. As a Daoist Master, he killed as he pleased, utterly ruthless, and thus commanded fear. Daoist Master Zhu Gong, however, dragged her entire household over. Her subordinates are disciples of many years; this one is a junior relative, that one is family. Can she execute them on a whim? A large ship cannot turn easily. Even our Li family must deliberate endlessly just to alter a single system. What hope does the Sacred Writ Gate have!"

Though the Xuanmu Dao lineage was currently ascendant, he clearly held the Sacred Writ Gate in contempt. "They haven't cleansed themselves of their demonic cultivator habits. They are just going over there to stir up trouble. My only concern is that she'll exhaust the resources of the Eastern shore, or that one of her peak lords will go mad and provoke our family. That would be an ugly affair."

Hearing his analysis, Li Xinghan visibly relaxed. With Li Zhouluo gone, Li Zhouming indifferent to clan affairs, and Li Chenghuai returning to seclusion after a brief appearance, she was the only high-generation cultivator left to manage things, and the stress had been weighing on her. If Li Jiangqian was confident, she felt much calmer. "It is good you have a plan... I did have another thought, however. The Sacred Writ Gate is recruiting disciples indiscriminately. I heard both the Yuan and Yu families sent people to join. Should we...?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head slightly. "They still have Foundation Establishment cultivators managing the sect; they won't run it like a sieve. Any people we send won't reach the upper echelon, especially not spies from a family known to have a Purple Mansion cultivator. There is no need to send anyone from the direct lineage and hand them leverage. See if anyone from the branch lineages is willing to make the trip."

"Anyone we send now couldn't compare to Queyi or Quexi; they probably fall far short of Ding Mu. I sent people to Purple Smoke a few days ago to deliver resources to him. I hear that Daoist Cao is treating him quite well, even selecting a top-grade Embyronic Breathing cultivation method for him."

After sighing, he suddenly recalled something else. "Aunt," he asked, a knowing smile playing on his lips, "during the years you were in seclusion... a certain man surnamed Zhuang has been cultivating on the Western shore. He frequently sends letters requesting an audience. Are you aware of this?"

At the mention of this, Li Xinghan looked rather awkward. "I... I am aware," she admitted. "His name is Zhuang Pingye. His father, Zhuang Cheng, is a famous rogue cultivator in the Guyan Great Desert, renowned for his Talisman-Sword techniques. I encountered him that day I went to the desert to eliminate demons. We spoke a few words on the road, and I politely said perhaps we'd meet again. I never expected him to actually follow me to the lake..."

Chasing someone from the desert all the way to the lake—the intention was obvious to everyone. Li Jiangqian hesitated. "I heard he is considered exceptionally handsome, and his appearance and family background are both outstanding. His family’s inherited sword Dao is also said to be unique. In your opinion, Aunt... what is his character like? And... do you find him bothersome?"

He was asking her true feelings. She raised an eyebrow slightly. "He is very polite in all matters, so he isn't bothersome. His family background isn't bad, and he certainly seems sincere at the moment. However, my uncle asked Elder Donghe to write to his acquaintances in the desert. They say his reputation there is merely average. While he can't be called fickle or a womanizer, he is a frequent patron of the flower houses and taverns... But the general atmosphere in that place is like that... so it’s hard to judge."

"He is, after all, a young master from a cultivation family who has achieved Qi Refining. It's inevitable he would indulge in such things while roaming..."

Li Xinghan shook her head. "My assessment is that he sees me as a suitable match. I am not unattractive, my innate talent is comparatively high, and my family status would be beneficial to him. As for genuine affection... I doubt there is much. When I traveled the Northern shore and the desert in the past, I met others of his sort, just none with such an illustrious background. My family members, on the other hand, are quite taken with him."

Li Jiangqian hadn't anticipated this response. "Then what is your intention, Aunt?"

Li Xinghan smiled, pursing her lips. "He appears sincere for the present. Let him continue cultivating on the Western shore. Ultimately, the pursuit of the Immortal Dao is the true path. I am not inside his mind, so I cannot say his thoughts. There is no need to assume the worst of him. Given enough time, the truth will reveal itself."

Li Jiangqian couldn't help but study her again. "I expected you to be somewhat flustered by this. You are taking it very calmly."

"You, child..." Li Xinghan shook her head and laughed. "You underestimate me. Years ago, when I was on the Northern shore cultivating my sword techniques, several 'talents' from the Fei family arranged to 'coincidentally' encounter me. After I rejected one of them, the Fei family supposedly broke his legs. It was horribly embarrassing for me."

Just as they were discussing matters, a messenger rushed in from outside the hall, his legs trembling. He collapsed to his knees. "Family Head! Daoist Master Houfu of the Great Xiukui Monastery... has appeared on the island! He requests an audience with you and the Old Master!"

"What?!" Li Jiangqian froze, exchanging a look of pure shock with Li Xinghan.

'A Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery... We have no friendship, no connection... why would he come seeking us out?!'

Li Ximing was not known for having a wide circle of acquaintances. This sudden, unexpected visit almost certainly signaled bad news rather than good. A chill settled in Li Jiangqian’s heart.

'This is trouble...'

But a Purple Mansion cultivator had arrived on their island. They had to pay their respects immediately; a moment's delay was unacceptable. Protocol dictated they couldn't simply invite him in; Li Jiangqian and the others had to go out themselves to greet him, as befitted their junior status. While a minor detail, Li Jiangqian knew that to someone like Houfu, who valued appearances, such etiquette was critical.

He hurried from his seat and exited the main hall with Li Xinghan, making for the side palace. Entering the hall, they saw a young man in black shamanistic robes seated in the host’s chair. Standing beside him was a woman dressed in a white blouse and a grey skirt. A gemstone of unknown origin was set upon her brow, accentuating her extreme beauty.

Li Jiangqian led the greeting, bowing low. "This junior, Li Jiangqian of the Moongaze Immortal Clan, the unworthy acting Family Head, pays his respects to Daoist Master Houfu!"

Perhaps because his etiquette was flawless, Houfu seemed polite enough. "Rise," he said with a nod.

Li Jiangqian rose but did not take a seat, standing respectfully to the side. Li Xuanxuan soon rushed over from Qingdu. After the old man paid his respects, Houfu raised an eyebrow. "While this Daoist Master was walking the overseas territories, I chanced upon Daoist Master Zhaojing of your clan, and we journeyed together for a time. Before we parted ways, he heard I was returning inland and entrusted me with a message."

"Thank you, Daoist Master!"

Hearing these words, Li Jiangqian bowed repeatedly in thanks. Li Xuanxuan looked as if a great weight had been lifted from him; realizing Li Ximing was not in grave danger, he was moved almost to tears. Li Xinghan let out a quiet sigh, the worry visibly melting from her expression, replaced by joy. Houfu gestured toward the woman, Xia Shouyu.

"This junior was also entrusted to me by Zhaojing. He said she is to be wed to one of his descendants. She is, herself, the progeny of a high cultivator from overseas."

Li Xuanxuan had already been observing Xia Shouyu. He originally assumed she was some expert from the Great Xiukui Monastery and had been admiring her remarkable bearing. When he heard Houfu's words, his eyes instantly lit up.

'Zhouming is well past the usual age... I thought Ximing wasn't paying attention to the matter... so he had already made arrangements! Excellent, excellent... Now that he has reached the Purple Mansion realm, his planning has become so thorough...'

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian finally felt assured that Li Ximing's condition must be stable, and his own confidence returned. Houfu, however, looked eager to depart.

"My conversations with Zhaojing were amicable," he stated calmly. "He will not be able to return to the lake for some time, but he sent Shouyu back with his instructions. The clan merely needs to remain disciplined and keep a low profile."

"This Daoist Master has urgent matters to attend to in the west. The war on the Great Western Plateau rages unabated. The Shu territories have suffered drought for nine straight years. Months ago, the local clans collapsed, sects have fled, and the people are resorting to trading children for food everywhere. Every moment I delay, thousands more die. I will not waste time with idle talk."

Before they could reply, he stepped into the Great Void and vanished.

As the group offered respectful farewells, Li Jiangqian was already analyzing the Daoist Master's words, his sharp eyes calculating.

'A great drought in the Shu lands means no rain is falling. When the land is this parched and the springs run dry... this is a sign of the Pristine Water Fruition Attainment.'

While he was contemplating the status of Pristine Water, Li Xuanxuan had already stepped toward Xia Shouyu. "This old master is Li Xuanxuan. Miss..."

"I wouldn't dare!" Xia Shouyu quickly curtsied, retrieving two scrolls from her sleeve—one red, one gold. She held them in her palms, presenting the golden scroll to Li Xuanxuan first. "Old Master, this is what the Daoist Master instructed me to deliver to the family. The golden scroll is for the clan here at the lake. The red scroll... is my marriage contract."

She showed no trace of shyness, speaking with perfect composure. "It is for the clan disciple of the 'Zhou' generation. His name is Ming."

Li Xuanxuan saw his guess had been largely correct. Accepting the golden scroll, he nodded and beamed. "Miss... that child is the Daoist Master's own direct grandson. His only one."

A flicker of surprise crossed Xia Shouyu’s eyes. She paused for a beat, then the corners of her mouth lifted in a smile. Stepping forward slightly, she requested, "Has he emerged from seclusion? I hope the family might arrange a meeting..."

Li Xuanxuan was already holding the scroll. Li Jiangqian extended a hand toward the main hall, smiling. "Please..."

Houfu’s visit seemed to have banished the oppressive gloom hanging over the Li clan leaders. Even their steps felt lighter as the group returned. Li Xuanxuan followed behind, unable to resist unrolling the scroll to read.

Li Ximing mentioned no urgent crises. He stated that his injuries were largely healed and the clan should not worry. He was cultivating externally and could not return for some time, instructing Ding Weizeng and Cui Jueyin to watch over the clan.

He did, however, specifically mention the Capital immortals Dao, ordering Li Jiangqian and the others not to let relations with the north become overly hostile. They were to ease tensions where possible:

'Changxiao is currently scheming from the sidelines, and the situation remains unclear. There is no need to drag Yehui into this, lest we find ourselves facing a wolf at the front gate and a tiger at the back, caught in an impossible dilemma.'

Li Xuanxuan rolled the golden scroll closed just as they entered the main hall. Li Jiangqian accepted it to read while they awaited the return of the messenger sent to fetch Li Zhouming.

A long time passed with no reply. Li Xuanxuan began to feel a sense of dread. Sure enough, the messenger finally returned, looking deeply embarrassed. He approached Li Jiangqian and whispered, "We could not retrieve the Young Master... he went out for leisure... and has not returned from the lake perimeter..."

Given the Li family's current control over both Qingdu and Yuting mountains, it was impossible that they *couldn't* find Li Zhouming. It only meant he was indulging in debauchery again, leading the messenger to phrase it as "could not retrieve." Li Jiangqian felt a flush of secondhand embarrassment.

Xia Shouyu, however, proved exceptionally sharp. She smiled lightly. "It is no matter. This is the perfect time of year for an outing. I shall accompany you. There is no need to disturb the Young Master's enjoyment."

Her words immediately told Li Xuanxuan that this woman had her own mind. She had covered for Li Zhouming's absence now, but the issue would have to be faced eventually. It was better to just be open about it. He sighed internally. "Indeed... It is best we go together."

Li Jiangqian, having just finished the scroll, put it away with a thoughtful expression. "If I may ask," he inquired, "your esteemed Dao... from which immortal mountain or pavilion overseas does it hail? That we might pay our respects to its name."

Xia Shouyu offered a tactful smile. "My elders merely cultivate upon an immortal mountain; it is not worthy of being called a great pavilion. Daoist Master Zhaojing has shown immense kindness to both my family and myself. The three Daoist Masters were discussing the profound mysteries when the topic of matrimony arose, and thus this match was bestowed..."

"As for the lineage my elders follow... this junior worries that revealing it might compromise the Daoist Master’s location. For the moment... it is not convenient to disclose. When the Daoist Master returns or sends word, then I can speak clearly. My apologies."

It was a watertight deflection. Li Jiangqian smiled and nodded. "Not at all. Although the rites are not complete, you are practically a member of our senior generation. How can you apologize to a junior? You honor me!"

The group left the main island together, taking to the air. Just as they ascended, they saw a streak of heavenly light racing in from the lake's edge. It was Li Zhouming, dressed in a flamboyant red robe with his signature fan dangling at his waist, flying frantically back toward the island.

Li Jiangqian spotted him instantly and knew the next few moments were going to be excruciatingly awkward.

Li Xuanxuan had tried reasoning, pleading, and scolding, but he was utterly helpless against this particular descendant. His anger began to simmer again, but with Xia Shouyu present, he decided to grant the boy a sliver of dignity and simply turned his head away.

Xia Shouyu appeared entirely unbothered. She inclined her head slightly in a formal greeting. "Greetings, Young Master."

Li Zhouming had been looking guiltily at Li Xuanxuan, wondering why the old man wasn't already screaming at him. Before he could puzzle it out, his gaze landed on the stunning woman before him. His eyes lit up with delight. "Greetings, Miss..."

As he drew closer, he realized Xia Shouyu was already at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Despite his own noble status, he was only a Qi Refining cultivator casually addressing a Foundation Establishment expert as 'Miss.' He suddenly felt insecure, but Xia Shouyu merely smiled and nodded, appearing somewhat shy and endearing, which immediately caused him to lift his chin a fraction higher.

Li Xuanxuan shot him a warning glare—though it was doubtful the boy understood it—and announced in a gruff voice: "This is Fairy Xia, the beloved daughter of an overseas immortal cultivator. She possesses outstanding talent, profound cultivation, a gentle temperament, and beauty like a celestial. This... is the marriage your Grandfather arranged for you. She came today specifically to meet you... and just which gutter were *you* playing in!"

"Huh?"

Li Zhouming was completely stunned. While his grandfather, Li Ximing, had provided him with an esteemed status, he had offered little actual attention; Li Xuanxuan had been the one to raise him. Hearing this sudden news, a delighted grin split his face.

'So it was Grandfather! Grandfather’s divine power is truly vast... what magnanimity, the true bearing of a Daoist Master! Wonderful, wonderful! He actually found me such a gentle and adorable wife! I will never curse him in my heart again... Never! And I won't let Father curse him either! I'll praise him to everyone I meet... What a good Grandfather, hehe.'

# Chapter 815: The Evil Cicada

Li Zhouming immediately flicked his sleeves, raised his head, and announced joyfully:

"So, news from Grandfather has arrived! I have been so worried about him, but it seems he has also been thinking of me. Does he have any decree?"

Only after saying this did he turn to Xia Shouyu and smile. "It's just... the Daoist Master arranged this marriage, but he never mentioned it to me. May I ask the lady's name?"

His words were polite. Xia Shouyu returned his smile but paused slightly, allowing the old man to speak first. Li Xuanxuan's expression softened a fraction as he replied:

"You do remember to worry about the Daoist Master. He is currently traveling in the Eastern Sea, and everything is going smoothly."

Only then did Xia Shouyu speak. "In response to the Young Master, this humble woman's surname is Xia, name Shouyu. I am a cultivator from the Eastern Sea."

Li Zhouming quickly unfastened his fan. "Please... Allow me to take you for a walk by the lake. It's the perfect chance to talk about the Daoist Master!"

Since it was only their first meeting, Xia Shouyu didn't sense anything amiss. She smiled and walked toward him. Li Xuanxuan felt a sense of strangeness in his heart, unsure what to say, and could only nod in acknowledgment. As the two left together, the old man didn't know whether to laugh or curse.

'This child is usually dull and mischievous, unreliable in all things. Nine out of ten sentences he speaks are nonsensical... But the moment he sees a woman, it's like he's suddenly enlightened—his eyes clear, his mind sharp, a completely different person. Every word he just said was perfectly on point... No wonder none of those girls by the lake ever caused any trouble. Hah...'

Li Jiangqian waited for him at the side, pondering deeply. After all, with two scrolls of decrees returning from Li Ximing, the main lineage descendants needed to gather and discuss. He entered the main hall with the old man and sealed the doors tightly. Li Xuanxuan sighed.

"It is best that the Daoist Master is fine. This Lady Xia was also his choice. I can see she is an extremely intelligent girl, and her family background must be good..."

Li Jiangqian guided him to the master seat. Once the old man sat down, Li Jiangqian stood to one side, poured him tea, and said in a low voice:

"She is very skilled in conversation. It was impossible to glean much in such a short time, but the subtle part is that we shouldn't be asking questions anyway, lest we expose the Daoist Master's whereabouts. However, I observed her attire... while elegant, none of it seems to be top-grade. If she truly had an extraordinary background, she should have at least one Foundation Establishment Realm dharma weapon, or perhaps spirit boots... yet I saw none."

"Perhaps my eyes are poor and I failed to recognize their value, or perhaps she simply hasn't brought out her powerful artifacts..."

Xia Shouyu was intended to be an elder (by marriage/status), so Li Jiangqian spoke extremely diplomatically. Li Xuanxuan, however, understood the implication and voiced his doubt:

"That is one point. But she repeatedly mentioned that her elders are cultivating on an immortal mountain and that her immediate family is not wealthy... That is also plausible."

Li Jiangqian nodded. Only when facing Li Xuanxuan did he dare speak so frankly. He replied:

"By my deduction, even if she has elders on an immortal mountain, Lady Xia must belong to a side branch or an impoverished main branch. The Daoist Master's trip overseas might not have been part of the original plan. Perhaps he made a compromise with a certain lineage, asking them for some assistance, which resulted in this marriage contract. Since we are the ones asking the favor, the other party naturally wouldn't send over their most talented or crucial direct descendant..."

"This is just my private speculation. Ultimately, this is probably for the best. Of all the female cultivators with outside surnames I've seen by the lake, not one can compare to Lady Xia. The Daoist Master's considerations are certainly more thorough than ours."

Li Xuanxuan nodded. He saw Li Jiangqian raise his head as if sensing something. A knock came from outside. With a wave of his sleeve, the hall doors swung open. Chen Yang was waiting outside. He hurried in and whispered in his ear:

"Patriarch... someone from the Azure Pond Sect has arrived."

Li Jiangqian frowned. "Who from the Azure Pond Sect? In what capacity are they here?"

Chen Yang whispered, "The visitor is Peak Lord Li Quantao of Fuchen Peak. He claims to be a good friend of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion Master."

Li Jiangqian had no recollection of the name, but Li Xuanxuan immediately nodded upon hearing it. "Ah, it's that young man. Quickly, invite him up!"

Although Li Quantao and the Moongaze Li clan didn't interact often, the gratitude between them ran deep. Their relationship went back to his father, Li Encheng, and Li Quantao himself had once saved Li Xizhi's life. Li Xuanxuan valued him greatly and turned to Li Jiangqian.

"We had such a good relationship back then. Now that our family has become a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan, we absolutely cannot make him wait. We must not let others think we are putting on the airs of an Immortal Clan and forgetting gratitude. It would cause a needless misunderstanding."

As they spoke, Li Quantao, dressed in blue robes patterned with waves, ascended the hall. The high-spirited youth of the past was now a middle-aged man, appearing far more reserved as he continuously cupped his hands in greeting.

Li Xuanxuan remained seated in the master chair while Li Jiangqian invited Li Quantao inside, taking a seat beside him to accompany him. The middle-aged man looked around the hall, his eyes filled with emotion. "Your clan... the changes are too vast. I hardly recognize the place."

"You and Xizhi are like brothers! You used to call him Brother Zhi. Why the formality..."

Li Xuanxuan replied with a smile, motioning for him to sit closer. "Have you encountered some difficulty? Or perhaps a junior disciple needs pills? Just say the word."

Li Quantao still couldn't relax. In the intervening years, he had married the sister of the Si family's Si Tongyi. With the Si family's support, his children did not lack for cultivation resources. Yet, his expression was somewhat desolate as he nodded.

"I was under sect orders to investigate matters in the Shanji area. Since I was passing the lake, I stopped by to visit."

He lowered his voice. "I just came from the Mushroom Forest Plains. It is chaos there. The Yuan Family Patriarch, Yuan Hudu, died suddenly when an old injury relapsed. Yuan Zibin has taken control of the family, imprisoned the elder Yuan Huyuan, and has hung several of his uncles, like Yuan Fuyao and Yuan Fuyi, from the mountain peak, whipping them for sport. He calls them his 'herd of swine,' letting them faint and reviving them repeatedly... It is too horrible to watch. He has also requisitioned over a thousand women into the mountains. The land is filled with misery."

Li Xuanxuan frowned. "Has Yuan Chengzhao made any statement?"

Mentioning Li Xizhi's junior brother, Yuan Chengzhao, Li Quantao just shook his head.

"He has not emerged from seclusion... This sort of thing isn't unique; it happens everywhere. It's only gaining attention because he imprisoned and humiliated an elder. Otherwise, it would hardly be news... It's nothing compared to the imperial descendants of Chu back in the day. My father used to say that patricide is not unknown even in immortal sects. And that Earth Virtue cultivator from Changxiao... his Dao companion is his own elder sister. It's common. In those sects and minor clans that have lost the suppression of a Divine Ability cultivator, the one who rises to power gains cultivation and authority, and their desires become uncontrollable, often leading to extreme brutality."

"In the past, the sect could manage these things. Now, we can barely manage ourselves, and such incidents are becoming more frequent."

Li Xuanxuan saw his hesitation and waved his hand, dismissing the attendants. Li Quantao was clearly agitated. Li Xuanxuan then found an excuse to send Li Jiangqian away as well. Only then did this Azure Pond Sect Peak Lord—this distant relative of the Wei-Li bloodline—let out a sigh. After a long moment, he whispered:

"There is some good news. Qin Xian, Peak Lord Qin, has been promoted to Peak Lord of Yuanxing Peak. He is preparing to select an auspicious day to marry Fellow Daoist Fei Qingyi..."

The affair between Fei Qingyi and the Si family confidant, Qin Xian, had been going on for a long time. That it was finally coming to fruition was significant news, but it clearly wasn't what Li Quantao truly wanted to say. Li Xuanxuan waited quietly. Sure enough, Li Quantao continued:

"A few days ago... just as Peak Lord Qin took his new post, I was also on duty. A blaze erupted on the main peak of the Azure Pond Sect, dyeing the heavens. I followed the disturbance and sensed an abnormal fluctuation in spiritual energy... A cultivator had fallen."

"But I was the first to arrive at that cultivator's cave-dwelling. I saw signs of excavation at the entrance gate and indentations from magic weapons striking it. The formation had been dispelled by an extremely skilled cultivator..."

Li Xuanxuan's heart trembled. He focused intently as Li Quantao, his face pale, whispered:

"I felt that something was wrong and descended the mountain quietly. But then... I saw my eldest son, Li Kan, and my second son, Li Xiangye, sneaking down the path. The cold white-iron swords they carried were broken, yet they kept them strapped to their backs..."

With the conversation having reached this point, Li Xuanxuan knew exactly what he meant. He remained silent. Frankly, Li Xuanxuan was surprised the Si family had waited this long to make a move. Li Quantao continued:

"The next morning, news spread through the sect. It was said that the former Sect Master, Chi Zhiyun, had failed his breakthrough and perished during the night. Although no one spoke out, I could see... most people wore expressions of sorrow."

At this, an exhausted look settled onto his features. He whispered:

"We all knew something would happen, but... I was still holding out hope that he would simply fail to achieve his Divine Ability on his own. My wife said they originally assumed the sudden change in spiritual atmosphere meant he was doomed to fail. No one expected him to reach the stage of Inward Heart Surging Profundity, which benefits the Fire Virtue. As the day drew closer, everyone grew anxious... leading to this."

Despite his words, his face was a mask of anxiety and fear.

In the end, Chi Zhiyun, the Sect Master of the Azure Pond Sect, had been generous, incredibly intelligent, merciful in judgment, and bold in promoting talent. He was truly a hero of his generation. Under his governance, the Azure Pond Sect was completely loyal; almost everyone had received his grace. Even after Chi Zhiyan's perverse actions had cost him all his confidants, and even with the Si family in power, everyone in the Azure Pond Sect knew Chi Zhiyun was in seclusion. They all felt guilty, and no one ever dared to bring him up.

Dantai Jin had promoted so many people, yet not one of them had been willing to act on his implied wishes. Now, he had been forced to rely on the hastily promoted confidant, Qin Xian, to plot the deed, using Li Quantao's two naive sons to carry it out. This revealed just how guilty the Si family and Dantai Jin truly felt. Even so, the Azure Pond Sect was still filled "with expressions of sorrow." The situation was awkward to the extreme.

Li Quantao grew even more distressed, his eyes welling with moisture. "He was a heroic figure. He was in seclusion, breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, pushing his Shengyang Acupoint into the Great Void. Everything was succeeding. He had broken his inner demons and was about to grasp Divine Ability... only to have his stone gate dug open from the outside. Two mere Qi Refining children broke in with swords, pierced his dantian, and severed his head. He died defeated and disgraced. If he bears a grudge, shaking heaven and earth would not be enough to appease it!"

"Senior, the elders in my family have all passed away. Brother Zhi and I are like blood brothers, and you are my elder... Speaking privately, back when my father was targeted by the Chi family, Sect Master Chi provided us much protection... I thanked him from the bottom of my heart then. Now... now, it wouldn't be wrong to call me ungrateful and perfidious!"

A dignified Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Li Quantao was covered in a cold sweat, tears streaming down his face. He bowed deeply, his voice trembling with terror:

"And those two were my own sons. They actually did such a thing... My conscience alone freezes my spine. I don't know what to do... I truly don't know what to do! Please, Senior... guide me!"

Li Quantao had grown up protected on the immortal peak, naive to the ways of the world. Although he had learned much since, he still acted according to his conscience. He was fundamentally a decent and kind man; otherwise, he never would have saved Li Xizhi all those years ago. His eyes were now filled with pure terror. The old man opened his eyes and asked softly:

"Do you know why they used your sons in this way?"

Li Quantao nodded stiffly.

"My father had a... misunderstanding... with Chi Wei. So they figured pulling me in was the most convenient option. It binds me tightly to them, making it impossible to leave. By involving Brother Zhi's connection, and then... I went into seclusion, and my two boys met someone... who instigated it... It doesn't matter who anymore."

Li Xuanxuan couldn't help but swallow a mouthful of hot tea to warm his stomach. He coughed.

"This is the karma of the past... It is all karma from long ago. The sin is not yours..."

Li Quantao's eyes widened, his lips trembling. "Senior believes in karma? I thought the Wei-Li were the last people to believe in it... If you believe that, you can forgive anything. That isn't good... If we must speak of karma, it was my father who committed the evil, who ambushed Chi Wei and stole the lineage..."

He seemed to have revealed something unintentionally. He lowered his voice, "Chi Wei was despicable, but Chi Zhiyun tried to dissuade him. He did much to remedy the situation and treated the victims kindly. I know Chi Zhiyun had to die. A clean execution, or even just explaining it clearly before killing him... but to harm him like *this*... I am deeply unsettled."

"Even revenge must have standards. If he harmed my family for personal gain, I would, at most, take revenge on him, kill him. I would not capture his great-grandson and dismember him. If I did that, wouldn't I be even more despicable than him? Shouldn't I suffer retribution for that? This is what I mean."

Li Xuanxuan listened, stunned. His heart sank. He took a medicinal pill from his sleeve, but Li Quantao waved it away.

"Senior, I am perfectly clear-headed. Lord Si is in the Southern Sea. What Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could possibly influence me through the grand formation of the Azure Pond Sect? This matter has weighed on my heart for a long time. This is not a momentary impulse."

His eyes dimmed slightly. "I understand that your esteemed clan also suffered greatly at the hands of the Chi family. The hatred runs deep in your hearts; you cannot understand me... But Senior is also correct. If there is karma, in the end, it will fall upon me!"

Li Quantao bowed deeply one last time and retreated from the hall. His hurried silhouette looked utterly defeated. Li Xuanxuan forgot to see him out. He picked up his tea and drank several consecutive mouthfuls before he felt the warmth return to his limbs.

After a long while, Li Jiangqian returned to his side, looking slightly surprised. "Why did he leave without even turning his head... Senior...?"

Li Xuanxuan rubbed his brow and said softly, "Chi Zhiyun... has fallen."

Li Jiangqian wasn't surprised. He nodded. "It was only a matter of time. That they dragged it out this long only shows the Si family was being careless."

He immediately grew suspicious. "Was he the one who told you? Was he involved? The Si family wanting to pull him in... they must be up to no good. They aren't trying to drag our family into this, are they..."

The old man seemed unsettled. He nodded silently, rising and walking down the steps. He glanced at Li Jiangqian and coughed.

"I was actually coming to find you... Sometimes I look at Que'wan's temperament and find it good; other times, I feel you are more reliable. You two siblings should complement each other more... Why don't you learn from your sister? Not everything needs to be taken to the absolute extreme, assuming the worst! There are benefits to interacting with sincerity... You trust people too little. You prefer to embellish everything with rhetoric. While it often wins you advantages, I fear it makes those around you—your friends—grow cold-hearted."

Li Jiangqian hadn't expected Li Xuanxuan to bring this up. He smiled naturally and replied:

"Toward my sister, and toward you, Senior, I have never been anything but completely sincere. My heart is clear on this. Any rhetorical embellishments are only seen by my elders, and they are always used to gain benefits for the clan... My conscience is clear."

The old man only walked down the steps, returning his smile. He nodded. "I'm old. These are the words of a dotard. The clan's affairs still require your full attention... This burdens you."

He descended the stairs but, surprisingly, did not return to Qingdu. Instead, he walked toward the bustling center of the island. Li Jiangqian accompanied him halfway before turning back to the hall. His expression serene, he sat down in the master seat, tapping the table lightly, his eyes turning cold as ice.

'I've never seen Senior act like this. Who had the audacity... who has been whispering slander about me in the old man's ear!'

# Chapter 816: Beihai Sea

Purple Smoke Gate.

Ethereal purple qi, unchanged for a hundred years, drifted through the mountain range. This land seemed eternally steeped in violet hues, with peaks jutting like islands from a purple sea of clouds, orderly and imbued with an immortal aura.

A stream of light drifted up the mountain, revealing a young woman riding the wind. She wore a simple white blouse and a purple skirt, her face round and her eyes bright above delicate ears. Though her attire was not extravagant, its neat propriety gave her a pleasant charm.

"Junior Sister Queyi!" a voice called from the mountainside.

She looked toward the sound just as a man hurried over on the wind, landing before her with a smile. "Back so early today!"

This was Li Queyi, a disciple of the Purple Smoke Gate currently at the third layer of Qi Refining. Seeing the man, she quickly bowed. "Greetings, Senior Brother Huang! I should be practicing my sword right now, but I received an urgent message from the sect. I’m being sent to the Eastern Sea... so I returned early."

The Purple Smoke Gate’s station in the Eastern Sea had been suffering disasters for half a year—landslides, tsunamis, and shattering islands had shifted all the earth and fire veins. The sect was overwhelmed, having already pulled most of their personnel from Moongaze Lake, leaving the main sect short-handed. This Second Senior Brother was well aware of the situation.

"Why are they sending *you*?" he asked doubtfully. "You’ve only been cultivating for such a short time! What kind of reasoning is that? This will be hard to explain, won't it? Does Master know?"

He clearly understood her background; if someone barely in the Qi Refining realm was sent out and met with misfortune, the sect would have no way to answer to the Li family.

Li Queyi forced a smile. "Naturally, they aren't sending me to fight. I cultivate the Jade True lineage, and the formation on that island is also from the Jade True system. I’m just going to handle logistics."

"Well, that makes sense…" Senior Brother Huang relaxed slightly, though worry lingered on his face. They descended together, heading toward their peak.

Ziqi Peak was not poorly situated; it rested on the right flank, encircled by mountains. Had its position been slightly more central, it would have directly faced Mu Zuo Peak. As the morning dawn broke, the world turned golden.

Senior Brother Huang hesitated for a long moment before finally speaking. "About last time… what I mentioned to you, Junior Sister. The Treasured Virtue Pill... Any word on that ingredient I needed, the White Zi Root? The sect doesn't have many alchemists, and it's terribly troublesome... you have to reserve their time far in advance."

He gave an awkward laugh. "I’m not… I’m not trying to pressure you, Junior Sister. This is just a loan. Your Senior Brother is truly facing barren pockets right now. Once I gather the necessary cultivation resources, I will absolutely repay you tenfold in the future..."

A trace of fatigue crossed Li Queyi’s face, but she maintained her forced smile. "I have already written home to ask. If there is any news, they will certainly send word. Please rest assured, Senior Brother."

The Purple Smoke Gate’s stipend for disciples wasn't bad, but not every disciple possessed an influential background. Ling Yanzi, in particular, was a lone wolf. The few disciples he accepted were either commoners or came from minor Qi Refining clans. The old man simply didn't know how to manage connections, yet he possessed an overly compassionate heart and preferred accepting disciples of humble status. Back when he first gave the Li family their entry token, they, too, were merely a Qi Refining family.

This Second Senior Brother was desperate to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. The sect had already provided him with one share of resources, and Ling Yanzi had given him what little he could spare, but naturally, the more resources one had, the better. Thus, he frequently turned to Li Queyi.

Li Queyi was utterly exhausted by it. Everyone on the peak treated her with overwhelming affection, seemingly wanting to praise her higher than the heavens, but in reality, they were all just staring at the resources in her pockets. If the items were truly hers to give, it would be one thing. But these were things she had to beg her family for, time and time again. How could she bear to keep opening her mouth to ask!

Ling Yanzi, meanwhile, understood nothing of management. Her senior brothers weren't inherently bad people, but for the sake of their Dao path to Foundation Establishment, even a good person could become ruthless. In private, they swallowed their pride again and again to plead with her. Every time Li Queyi picked up her brush to write home, her heart ached with grievance.

'I’m not asking for these senior brothers to be like Wen Wu of Mu Zuo Peak, arranging everything perfectly, carefully selecting techniques for me, and managing all the connections with the alchemy and artifact-refining peaks. But surely they don’t have to force my hand like this, over and over again… This…'

'When I first arrived, I knew this peak was inferior to the others. I assumed that if I just cultivated hard and maintained good relationships, everything would be fine. But who could have known that a poor and bitter peak has its own logic... How could this life be anything *but* bitter?'

Ling Yanzi was genuinely good to her, yet even he had privately requested resources from the Li family on two occasions. Li Jiangqian had spotted the underlying issue at a glance and mentioned it subtly in a letter. Li Queyi understood immediately: it was the cost of currying favor with her master. The old man had to support too many disciples, stretching every single spirit stone as if it were two. She saw that clearly enough.

A few days ago, Wen Wu had brought Li Quexi to visit, hoping to strengthen the relationship between the cousins. Who knew what pills Mu Zuo Peak had provided Li Quexi, but her cultivation speed was terrifyingly fast. Worse, Li Queyi heard that her cousin was actually sending spiritual items she acquired *back* to the family. This news made Li Queyi feel even more insignificant.

This trip to the Eastern Sea—she claimed it was a sect arrangement, but in truth, Li Queyi had privately begged a senior sister from the Xiao family, who also cultivated at Purple Smoke, to arrange it. She just wanted an excuse to escape.

Yet, she could still understand the desperation driving her senior brothers as they risked everything for a chance at Foundation Establishment. She could only lower her voice. "I don't need Senior Brother to repay me multiple times over. My family has some spare capacity, so I am willing to help my martial brothers. I have already sent the letter home. If the family obtains the root, they will send it directly to Master. I am leaving for the overseas assignment soon, so Senior Brother can just collect it from Master when it arrives."

She gave a slight bow, excused herself, and retreated to her own rooms, feeling an isolating chill seep out from the entire peak. She was at a complete loss.

'How did it come to this? Poverty is one thing, but why can’t martial siblings support each other with basic fellowship? Instead, they scramble over one another to scheme for my things. Meanwhile, the wealthy Mu Zuo Peak is filled with righteous, generous people, all of them focused wholeheartedly on clearing obstacles for my cousin…'

***

Beihai Sea.

The Beihai Sea was an sea within the greater Hetian Sea domain. Its total area was not large; if one discounted the numerous reefs and islets dotting its surface, the remaining water was smaller than two Splitreed Islands combined. Yet, it was ludicrously wealthy, overflowing with spiritual items, truly the spiritual essence of the Hetian Sea.

The dragon lineage had a custom of 'shepherding the seas.' In the past, this meant Dragon Princes were rotated between the various oceans like traveling magistrates. Nowadays, it more closely resembled a feudal system of enfeoffment. Each Dragon King governed a fixed sea territory, but these domains were invariably outside the Hetian Sea, scattered between the Vermillion Sea's Strait of Ten Thousand Isles and the World's Navel.

The Hetian Sea proper was akin to the Dragon Monarch's personal domain and was not meant to be partitioned off. But exceptions always exist. In the last millennium, three exceptionally favored Dragon Kings had been granted fiefs within Hetian. The Beihai Sea was the smallest of these, but it was the closest to the core territory, bordering the Yinzhou island where the dragons dwelled. It was practically adjacent to the capital. This alone demonstrated the immense favor and status held by the Beihai Dragon King.

The central sea was perfectly calm. A few small boats drifted on the currents. A figure squatted on the bow of the lead vessel, his eyes glowing green as he stared intently ahead. After a moment, he slipped back into the cabin and whispered, "Young Master, Changliu Gorge is just ahead."

Inside, a young man leaned against the bulkhead, his pair of golden pupils emitting a faint, yin-like glow in the shadows. Hearing the report, he merely replied, "Slow the boat. Follow the coast west and look for settlements. There is no need to head straight for the gorge."

The green-eyed man immediately rose, hopped back to the bow, and drew a pair of slimy, dark-green hands from within his robes, using them to slowly propel the boat forward.

This passenger was, of course, Li Zhouwei.

Back then, Li Zhouwei had ambushed and killed Situ Mo, seizing his Dharma Artifact. He was pursued to the borders of the Myriad Radiance region, where, in full view of numerous Changxiao Gate cultivators, he slew Yunan Zi and escaped into the Sword Gate’s territory.

The Sword Gate dispatched a main lineage disciple, Cheng Xuhua, to greet him and invited him to rest in the local prefecture. But there was no decree from the Purple Mansion Realm, no heavyweight figures appeared, and they certainly did not invite Li Zhouwei into their mountain stronghold. He understood immediately: the Sword Gate desperately wanted no part of this conflict and was acting purely out of basic courtesy.

Although Cheng Xuhua was clearly stunned by Li Zhouwei's actions and remained perfectly polite, the courtyard they offered him did not even contain a cup of tea. Li Zhouwei wasted no time. He hastily packed and used a golden talisman to escape to the Eastern Sea.

Everyone knew the Changxiao Gate and the Hengzhu Dao did not get along, so he absolutely could not flee toward Hengzhu. Furthermore, Changxiao’s Lightboat Reefs and the Hengzhu’s Suzhù Reefs are situated extremely close to one another. Li Zhouwei feared, one, that someone might be waiting to ambush him midway, and two, he himself had never intended to throw his lot in with the Hengzhu Dao. Thus, he chose the opposite path, traveling straight into the heart of the Hetian Sea.

Traveling day and night, he reached the Beihai Sea. He selected a remote location to remotely pay his respects to Li Chenghui, then immediately entered seclusion to heal his wounds and refine his cultivation. Having made significant progress, he only emerged in the last few days.

He was at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He had *just* broken through right before he was forced to fight his way out from the suppression of numerous Changxiao cultivators and their Dharma Artifacts. The ordeal had severely destabilized his foundation. He consumed a medicinal pill to stabilize his cultivation base, estimating that after a year or so of consolidation, his cultivation would be perfected, and he could begin practicing his secret arts.

Only now, however, did he finally have a moment to truly sit and process everything. He sighed softly.

'I originally assumed that with Wang Fu dead, even though Changxiao bears extreme malice toward the "Son of Destiny" and wants to plot against our family, they would at least adhere to the basic rules. It should have been a long-term strategic game. I never, ever expected that old bastard to be so decisively vicious.'

Regarding the Li family's strategic maneuvering at the Purple Mansion Realm level, he was the most informed person aside from Li Ximing himself. This incident appeared to have been triggered by Profound Peak, but in reality, it was a meticulous, long-brewing plot by Changxiao. They simply hadn't anticipated that Changxiao's determination had reached such lengths. That Purple Mansion formation over the lake was not the work of a single day. Li Ximing was bound to expose his movements in the Eastern Sea eventually. Even if the Profound Peak incident hadn't happened, Changxiao would have manufactured another pretext.

Now that he had calmed down, he sorted through the clues. 'Changxiao’s scheme didn’t begin the moment the Daoist Master broke through. It likely started much earlier, with Yehui and Changxiao planning to boil the frog—a scheme to kill me while maintaining their reputation. But then the Daoist Master broke through abruptly. Yehui immediately tried to pull out, forcing Changxiao to abandon that plan and move directly to assassinate the Daoist Master instead…'

With no news regarding either Changxiao or Li Ximing, Li Zhouwei had no intention of leaving the Beihai Sea. He had chosen this location with extreme care.

This Beihai Dragon King was the son of Dongfang You. Not only was he powerful and deeply favored, but most critically, this Dragon King was the master of the White Dragon lineage and the father of Dingjiao—the Dragon Prince of the Clear Seas and Serene Pools, Inheritor of the Azure.

Years ago, Li Zhouwei had accepted a request from Dingjiao and helped facilitate the 'fox-dragon affair.' The White Dragon lineage certainly hadn't acted without reason. Setting aside friendship and face, Li Zhouwei possessed something that the White Dragon lineage coveted. This was, therefore, the safest place he could possibly be.

'If I had fled south, who knows if the Hengzhu Dao would have used me to escalate their feud with the Changxiao Gate. I would just be placing myself in someone else's hands. Changxiao’s methods are bizarre; the Hengzhu Dao’s protection is simply not as reliable as the dragons’ authority.'

'The Hengzhu Dao conflicts with both the Golden Feather Sect and the Azure Pond Sect; they are separate factions. The Daoist Master mentioned this when he visited Daoist Master Yuanxiu. I cannot go there lightly. Conversely, the moment I entered the Beihai Sea, the dragon lineage almost certainly knew. I might even get an opportunity to meet the King.'

Therefore, he had subdued several local demons along the way to serve as his attendants. Li Zhouwei silently took stock. "I killed Situ Mo and seized his Dharma Artifacts... that man’s personal fortune was quite substantial. It’s just a pity I couldn’t grab Yunan Zi’s belongings. I was too worried about divination tracking… otherwise, adding that old man’s wealth, it would have been a true windfall."

But Situ Mo had been ordered around by various Purple Mansions; it was hard to say if his belongings were 'clean.' Left in a storage bag, they were fine. Taking them out was another matter.

Furthermore, his own Immortal Foundation possessed an extremely powerful ability to suppress and seize Dharma Artifacts, and he had stolen quite a few from the Changxiao Gate. Naturally, he couldn't use any of them himself. He had used the Immortal Mirror to inspect his haul; one Water Mansion gourd artifact still had the residue of a tracking formation carved into its inner wall. It was a ticking time bomb. He didn't dare remove it, planning instead to exchange the entire tainted lot while he was in the Beihai Sea.

He summoned one of the demons. The demons of the Beihai Sea were generally more knowledgeable and cunning than those of the Southern Borderlands. But having eaten men, their temperaments were all the same: they respected strength, not diplomacy, fearing power, not virtue.

He forced the demon to kneel and demanded, "What kind of place is this Changliu Gorge? Is there a market for spiritual items?"

The demon appeared to be some kind of fish creature, dripping slime onto the deck. It scrambled to reply, "Reporting to the Great King! At Changliu Gorge, there is a Changliu Mountain. At the foot of this mountain, there is indeed a market! A Purple Mansion Daoist Master lives on the mountain; I hear she is called Daoist Master Xiang Chun. Her temperament is excellent! She treats demons and immortals as equals, and she is a good friend of the Beihai Dragon King! It is rare for us demons in Beihai to have such a market…"

"Oh? Such a place exists..." Li Zhouwei was beginning to understand. He nodded. "No wonder you lot have some semblance of worldliness and have all cobbled together partial human forms. It turns out you have a market where you can learn such things."

These Qi Refining demons could not, of course, achieve a true human transformation; they had merely practiced some minor techniques to appear as half-human lackeys. Proud demons with purer bloodlines would never stoop to such arts.

"Then head to the market," Li Zhouwei commanded.

The demons began to row. Li Zhouwei was already calculating the situation. 'Daoist Master Xiang Chun... Her mountain is here in Beihai, bordering the Yinzhou continent, and she is close with the Dragon King. Her stance and identity need no further explanation. I recall the Daoist Master mentioning her once. No wonder she’s such an accommodating figure. So this is Changliu Mountain. Perhaps… perhaps I can inquire about the news here.'

He sat cross-legged on the boat, closing his eyes to cultivate. After some time, he heard a commotion outside. His spiritual sense immediately swept outward.

Several demons dressed in azure robes stood before his boat. He heard the trembling, timid voice of the toad demon from the bow. "My lords… my lords, please, hold on! The one in this boat is also a Great King! I cannot afford to slight either side! If this one becomes angry, you all… you might not fare so well. Please, reconsider!"

The lead azure-robed demon had two long ribbons tied about its neck. It had a high nose and bulging eyes—a domineering visage—yet its tone was not arrogant. It bowed slightly. "Daoist friend, you misunderstand. Please, just announce our presence. We have come under orders to request an audience with the Great King."

The toad demon was a natural coward; speaking that one sentence of warning had already taken all its courage. It didn't bother arguing further, simply stumbling back to make the report. The azure-robed demon followed. Li Zhouwei, already grasping the situation, lifted the cabin curtain.

His golden pupils swept over them, causing the lead demon to shudder involuntarily. "Who is your master?" Li Zhouwei asked casually.

The azure-robed demon immediately bowed low, speaking with profound respect. "Reporting to the Great King, my master is the The Water-Parting Dragon King of the Boundless Sea's Primal Serenity. His fief is here in the Beihai Sea. He is currently resting upon Changliu Mountain and wishes to invite the Great King to join him."

# Chapter 817: The Secret of the Great Ancestor

"So it's the Beihai Sea Dragon King. A simple summons would have sufficed; there was no need for such a formal invitation."

The azure-robed demon soldier cautiously raised his eyes. He saw an imposing man in soft armor step out of the cabin, his attitude polite enough.

"Lead the way."

These few azure-robed demons were all at the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. Li Zhouwei used his ocular technique and discerned they were some kind of deep-sea green shrimp. To command such a presence in the Beihai Sea, they had to be serving a Dragon-kin. Li Zhouwei had a decent relationship with Dingjiao, and this Dragon King was considered an elder.

A massive, jewel-encrusted, high-backed chair rose from the sea, lifted by a host of demons. It was as large as a house, supported beneath by nine black-backed turtles. The armrests were fashioned from two white Hooked Serpent heads, polished smooth and inscribed with glowing blue runes, emanating a fierce aura.

The Dragon-kin had used Hooked Serpent nobles for decoration for ages. Guest chair armrests, in particular, often used their heads. They disdained black or gray serpents, insisting on using only white ones. Li Zhouwei landed on the seat; his entire human frame was smaller than one of the armrests. The crowd of demons swayed as they carried him forward.

Li Zhouwei had assumed some minor Dragon-kin official had detected him. He never expected the Beihai Sea Dragon King himself to send an invitation. It seemed like a great honor, but it was actually a headache.

‘Is this necessary? Unsolicited kindness is, nine times out of ten, a trap, especially coming from a Demon of this level. Dragons and the White Qilin share a bond, and Dingjiao even said this Beihai Sea Dragon King once met Emperor Gong of Wei. But if the relationship was truly that reliable, there would be at least a single White Qilin left in the entire Eastern Sea...’

He sat cross-legged, sinking into heavy thought. The seat beneath him moved slowly but covered ground rapidly. Hundreds of miles passed in what felt like moments. The water currents rushed by. The toad stationed beneath the seat called out obsequiously:

"Your Majesty, we’ve arrived at Changliu Mountain!"

‘Changliu Mountain?’

Li Zhouwei immediately sensed something was wrong.

‘If the Beihai Sea Dragon King invited me, why didn't he take me to his Dragon Palace in the Beihai Sea? Why call me to Changliu Mountain!’

He frowned. The azure-robed demon at his side was sharp. The instant the toad finished shouting, he immediately followed up, his voice soft:

"Indeed, that is Changliu Mountain ahead. Our Lord rarely emerges from seclusion. He is currently on the mountain discussing the profound with a Daoist Master. Knowing you were also in the Beihai Sea, he invited you to join them."

‘It seems this Daoist Master of Changliu Mountain... is truly intimate with the Dragon-kin.’

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully. The conveyance stopped at the foot of the mountain, where a young woman dressed as a Daoist nun waited. She looked sixteen or seventeen, her face rosy. The moment she saw him, she actually bowed low to the ground.

"Greetings, Your Majesty. The two lords are waiting for you on the mountain."

Li Zhouwei felt a slight shock, his expression shifting. He re-examined the immortal mountain but saw no one else, only this single Daoist nun. The two green shrimp demons followed him ashore. The Changliu Mountain nun bowed repeatedly to them, but the two demons merely offered a slight nod in return.

Li Zhouwei remained silent.

‘Changliu Mountain is also a Purple Mansion Realm lineage... yet they debase themselves like this. The Hetian Sea... it truly is nothing more than the backyard of the Dragon-kin...’

He proceeded up the mountain. Along the way, he saw no cultivators coming or going, nor any medicine gardens or pavilions. The spirit trees flanking the path were dense, obscuring nearly everything from view, which only intensified his feeling of unease.

They soon reached the summit. The two azure-robed demons moved ahead to guide him, and he finally saw a vast, luxurious palace. They passed through three successive gates, all guarded by demons. The pillars lining the path grew taller, painted with the wave patterns of Converging Water.

"My Lord! The White Qilin has been brought!"

The two demons spoke in unison, their voices echoing in the vast, empty hall. From the front, however, came the sound of sweet, high-pitched, rustling giggles.

Li Zhouwei performed his salutations and slightly raised his brow.

On the main throne at the highest point sat a robust, gray-haired man. He had a high-bridged nose, narrow eyes, and wildly disheveled hair. His eyes were shockingly large and glowed with a flashing red light. The light in the palace was already dim; viewed from afar, he looked like a fiend from a grim fog.

He wore a suit of silver-white soft armor. Long, gray-white fur spilled from the gaps in the armor plates, flowing down his body. His hands were as large as human heads, his claws gleaming coldly as they rested on the armrests.

This demon sat with his legs spread wide. Sitting on his left knee, which was as broad as a small table, was a woman. She had dark black hair and an innocent face, draped in a semi-transparent white gauze. Her pristine white thigh and most of her upper torso were completely bare. Her eyes were shaded and remote, their color indistinct.

Within the massive palace court, dozens of other Daoist nuns of varying beauty sat gathered below the main throne. Some held fruit platters, others raised golden jugs, all of them flirting and laughing, each displaying their own charms.

The rosy-cheeked Daoist nun who had greeted him at the mountain's base went up, smiled, and greeted her companions, joining her sisters to kneel and massage the Dragon King’s feet.

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze slightly, refusing to watch. The suspicion in his heart was suddenly confirmed.

‘Just as I thought...’

The one on the throne was undoubtedly the Beihai Sea Dragon King. The cultivator who met him had said, 'two lords are waiting.' The entire atmosphere of Changliu Mountain was one of dissolute indulgence. Who else could the Daoist nun on his knee possibly be?

She had to be the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master of Changliu Mountain, the Daoist Master Xiang Chun.

‘No wonder... No wonder Changliu Mountain receives such preferential treatment. No wonder the Daoist Master Xiang Chun treats humans and demons as equals. The demons in the Beihai Sea only dare to say the Daoist Master and the Dragon King are 'close'... This goes far beyond just being close...’

‘I heard Daoist Master Xiang Chun is mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm and not old; she only broke through in the last hundred years. The Beihai Sea Dragon King is old enough to be her grandmaster... Several of the Dragon Princes are probably older than Daoist Master Xiang Chun... She clearly isn't his official wife. Dragons are inherently lecherous... and no one dares to spread a single word of gossip about it...’

This was truly an awkward situation. The Beihai Sea Dragon King obviously didn't mind the relationship being known, or he wouldn't be sitting here so brazenly. What Daoist Master Xiang Chun thought about it, however, was hard to say.

Li Zhouwei couldn't fathom their motives. Having completed his salutations, he could only offer an ambiguous greeting:

"My respects to both the lords..."

The gray-haired man spoke. His voice was just as fierce as his appearance—gruff and deviant. "White Qilin... I heard Jiao'er mention you. I just finished my seclusion, and since you happened to be in the Beihai Sea, I decided to see you."

He loosened his grip, allowing Xiang Chun to slide off his knee. With a wave of his sleeve, the crowd of female cultivators below dispersed. The moment Xiang Chun’s feet touched the ground, a set of black-gray Daoist robes materialized, covering her completely. She took a seat to the side.

Only then did the Beihai Sea Dragon King continue, "This is Daoist Master Xiang Chun, the mistress of Changliu Mountain."

After he spoke, Daoist Master Xiang Chun replied in a soft voice, "Lieyun... so this is the White Qilin. I have read much about them, but this is the first time I have seen one."

Unsure what medicine these two were selling, Li Zhouwei could only maintain perfect etiquette and bow once more.

Dongfang Lieyun's status was clearly far beyond Dingjiao's. He didn't offer Li Zhouwei a seat, instead speaking with detached interest.

"I saw Emperor Gong of Wei in my youth. That one was a Golden Core direct descendant and the lord of a Immortal Dynasty. He was purer than this one. But his temperament wasn't much like a White Qilin. I imagine it was because the state's destiny was fading, and the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment was unstable."

Xiang Chun nodded, whispering, "That was during the Wei era. Today, he is a rare sight in the world, a White Qilin."

The gray-haired man blinked slightly, his glittering red eyes finally turning toward Li Zhouwei. Dongfang Lieyun smiled.

"I sought you out for Xiang Chun."

Li Zhouwei looked up. The Dragon King said flatly:

"Bright Yang and Veiled Yin are the foundation of Valley Water. Xiang Chun requires White Qilin blood to cultivate a divine ability."

A bitter chill shot up his spine. Li Zhouwei quickly composed himself. His expression remained unchanged as he replied, "To be able to help the Daoist Master is this junior’s honor."

Dongfang Lieyun laughed loudly and nodded slightly toward Xiang Chun, his voice softening.

"I will take him now. When the required years are fulfilled, I will refine a measure of White Qilin blood and send it over to you."

He then rose from the main throne, casting an enormous shadow over the hall. Without sparing another glance at anyone, he waved his sleeve. Immediately, azure seawater gathered at his feet, and they warped away through the Great Void.

***

The entire grand hall instantly fell empty. Daoist Master Xiang Chun remained standing in the same spot, staring coldly into the empty space. After a long moment, a slight smile touched her face.

"White Qilin blood... It’s mine!"

***

Amidst a blur of azure light, Li Zhouwei’s vision cleared, revealing a dazzling crystalline expanse. A palace seemingly made of crystal, with jade-like steps appearing one by one, filled his sight. He let out a breath. Not far away stood a jade platform.

An intense chill radiated from his side.

The Beihai Sea Dragon King, Dongfang Lieyun—who looked more fiend than man—was sitting sprawled on the steps beside him. His form was so massive that his legs spanned five or six steps at once. He held a jade pot, those crimson pupils fixed squarely on Li Zhouwei.

He glanced at Li Zhouwei, then stood up, his voice low.

"I called you here for a few things. In this world, only on the surface of the Hetian Sea can certain matters be discussed. It is fortunate we can settle them all today."

Dongfang Lieyun’s voice had changed, shedding its earlier deviant tone, becoming heavy and powerful. Li Zhouwei immediately understood.

"Your Majesty, please speak."

Dongfang Lieyun paced to the great doors of the crystal palace and stood with his back to Li Zhouwei, his voice deep.

"The Wei Great Ancestor, Li Qianyuan. Do you know of him?"

Li Zhouwei sensed the gravity in that low tone. A creeping sense of dread, a feeling of mortal danger, prickled his skin. "The founding monarch of Wei. Naturally, I know of him."

Dongfang Lieyun spoke quietly. "The Zhou Dynasty divided the world, sparking endless wars that could not be stopped. Finally, the True Monarch fell, and the state lineage was severed by Jin. From then on, the world knew no peace. Often, the death of one emperor meant the end of the dynasty. There was even a century that saw six changes of rulers. The Great Ancestor emerged from Guanlong to conquer Qi and Lu, unifying the north. He became the first emperor to verify Bright Yang, and the very first human master of the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment."

"Following that, he established the Immortal Dynasty. The Imperial Throne *was* the Fruition Attainment. To ascend the throne was to borrow the status of a Golden Core; to accept an official rank was to borrow the dharma power of Bright Yang. Although the Wei court was consequently brutal, it was a true Immortal Dynasty... Of Wei, Qi, Liang, and Zhao, only Emperor Wu of Liang learned his method. Only the Wei and Liang dynasties possessed this power. The others had only the name of a Immortal Dynasty, not the reality."

"As for refuse like Zhao and Yan, it is laughable. They were merely puppets of the Buddhist cultivators, yet they dared call themselves emperors!"

He continued to face away from Li Zhouwei, explaining as if to himself:

"Everyone believed the Wei dynasty he founded was the greatest method ever devised to solve the barrier between immortal and mortal, the best way to build an immortal kingdom... Yet such a figure, a man only half a step from the Dao Embryo, suddenly died a violent death. The Bright Yang Fruition Attainment returned to the Great Void. Because of this, Emperor Gong of Wei collapsed, exploding into a pile of rotten meat right in front of the court. The imperial majesty built over generations became a terrifying, horrific joke... The officials simultaneously lost their power, and thus, the nation disintegrated."

"This method of the immortal kingdom was subsequently stolen by the Buddhists. They studied and improved it, filling in the gaps generation by generation, which led to the Seven Phases Buddhist Land method they use today. Ultimately, the Northern Buddhists persecute the Wei Li clan so desperately not just because of karma. It is just like a common thief who steals another’s property, then jumps up and down, screaming accusations, desperately wishing they could kill the original owner so the stolen item truly becomes their own."

Li Zhouwei’s hair stood on end. Dongfang Lieyun finally turned his face, revealing an expression of grim, agonizing depression.

"It was Luoxia... You have met Li Xunquan. Mount Luoxia’s plot for the Bright Yang position is no secret. But the Great Ancestor's influence on the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment is too deep. He imbued it with too much meaning, and Heaven itself approved him. The Fruition Attainment recognizes only him. But he has lost his sanity, so he can only fall from the Great Void, again and again... Luoxia applies its influence bit by bit, using these repeated falls to wear away his divine power and his fate—and, of course, to torture Li Xunquan."

"The last one... your family is familiar with him. It was Chu Yi."

Li Zhouwei snapped his head up. Dongfang Lieyun continued, "After a thousand years, Bright Yang is finally, greatly corrupted. Luoxia has gradually seized the true initiative. They opened their grotto-heaven, leaking vast quantities of Bright Yang cultivation methods into the world. Normally, cultivating Bright Yang would help the Great Ancestor, but he is too defiled. When these cultivators impact the Purple Mansion Realm or the Golden Core, influencing heaven and earth, it instead helps to shake the Fruition Attainment."

"And you... you are a watershed moment."

Dongfang Lieyun’s expression was complex, tinged with a cruel venom. "The Bright Yang Fruition Attainment is finally willing to bestow its destiny upon another. That destiny is upon you. Your probability of successfully impacting the Purple Mansion Realm is enormous; you could even strike for the Fruition Attainment itself. You don't even need to succeed. The very act of *trying* will cause him immense damage... Although we lack the power to rescue the Great Ancestor, based on the meager strength we do possess, my hornless dragon lineage *should* kill you."

"But, inconveniently, you are a descendant of Wei Li. You can be considered a junior of Emperor Gong of Wei... From that angle, it seems we should help you. You must understand the hornless dragon lineage’s complicated feelings toward you... Ignoring you... already seems the best possible solution."

His voice gradually turned sinister. "My branch was closer to Emperor Gong of Wei. Some time ago, I sent Dingjiao to retrieve you, to slowly reveal the matter of the Wei Li, all while trying to avoid Mount Luoxia's notice. But things changed. You possess the body of a White Qilin. Changxiao covets your destiny. He chased Li Ximing all the way to the Eastern Sea, shamelessly probing with that dog face of his, while Luoxia watched from the sidelines."

"A spirit cultivator of my Dragon kin has deep ties to your Li clan and was forced to intervene and save him. She is intimately connected to the Dragon Monarch. The moment she acted, high-level cultivators could deduce exactly what step the Dragon Monarch’s secret affairs had reached. This situation twisted and turned, becoming Luoxia’s poisonous scheme to probe my hornless dragon lineage, allowing them to see the Dragon Monarch's true state. I do not know if Changxiao intended this, but the people from Mount Luoxia have already succeeded."

"This move put us badly on the defensive... This Venerable One sensed then that something was wrong."

Li Zhouwei’s expression changed drastically as he realized the Dragon King’s gaze was utterly bleak. Dongfang Lieyun’s voice dropped, turning cold as steel.

"It made This Venerable One consider a possibility. Mount Luoxia is extremely close to Bright Yang. They could not possibly be unaware of your destiny. So why didn't they come to collect you? Wouldn't it be far better to have you under their control? What if... what if this destiny of yours was *lured* out by them, deliberately bestowed upon a Wei Li descendant... specifically to trap my lineage in this dilemma? You... and the entire Li clan... what if you are nothing but a trap, deliberately allowed to exist by Mount Luoxia?"

The Dragon King’s pupils contracted, narrowing until they were almost two vertical red lines. He hissed, "You are the handiwork of Mount Luoxia."

# Chapter 818: White Dew Blood

Li Zhouwei stared opposite the red-eyed Dragon King, a peak Purple Mansion cultivator who possessed five complete Divine Abilities. Dongfang Lieyun’s ferocious aura seemed to overflow. As his emotions shifted, the entire crystal palace trembled slightly, letting out a low hum.

He had spoken quickly and at length, stacking one deduction and calculation upon another. The interrogation was imminent. Li Zhouwei barely had time for a lightning-fast review of the situation before he answered:

"Since Your Majesty believes I am the result of Mount Luoxia influencing the bestowal of the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment, and the Great Ancestor is already so weakened... even if I were to die suddenly, would they not simply bestow a second attainment? If Mount Luoxia placed that second chance within their own mountain, wouldn't killing me be nothing more than drinking poison to quench their thirst?"

"Furthermore, ignorance was one thing, but now that Senior has revealed these secrets to me, is seeking that Fruition Attainment... truly something this junior should attempt? Failure to achieve the Fruition Attainment means death. But if I succeed, could Mount Luoxia bear to watch a Fruition Attainment they plotted over for a thousand years fall into the hands of a Li Qianyuan descendant? The Bright Yang lineage values hierarchy and orthodoxy above all. If this junior becomes a True Monarch, how could this Fruition Attainment possibly satisfy Mount Luoxia’s ambitions?"

Dongfang Lieyun had yet to reply. Li Zhouwei maintained his calm expression and continued, "This junior knows nothing of destiny’s calculations. I only know that as a White Qilin—even if I truly was born of Mount Luoxia's influence—cooperating with the dragon lineage to protect the Great Ancestor’s position is the only logical path. No matter how powerful Mount Luoxia is, they ultimately have no place for me. If Your Majesty truly intended to kill me, there would be no need for this long discussion. You merely wished me to understand the stakes."

For the dragon lineage, the worst possible outcome was Li Zhouwei failing to achieve the Fruition Attainment, which would mean all their efforts had been for nothing. Conversely, Mount Luoxia was the one who *most* desired Li Zhouwei to make the attempt... Dongfang Lieyun’s expression remained grim, his deep voice resounding:

"Once the Dao path is severed, how could a White Qilin accept it? Will you not also perish when your lifespan ends? Any ambitious cultivator would rather test the Bright Yang against Mount Luoxia. If you maneuver against them and actually succeed in becoming a True Monarch, the wonders of such divine abilities are profound. Might there not be a way to reconcile? Even if you perish, you gain infinite chances at rebirth. That is far better than dying as a Purple Mansion cultivator."

Li Zhouwei did not back down. "If I become a True Monarch and then perish, I will surely be suppressed by Mount Luoxia for eternity, never to see the light of day. As a Purple Mansion cultivator, I still have the option of seeking Intercalary or Auxiliary Positions. At worst, if the dragon lineage grants me a measure of Metallic Essence, I can reincarnate and escape this cage entirely."

Li Zhouwei had made the outrageous demand of exchanging for Metallic Essence, yet Dongfang Lieyun showed no surprise. Standing far off at the front of the hall, the demon ignored the mention of the auxiliary positions and spoke in a quieter voice:

"If you reincarnate and cultivate another path, you may never again touch the realm of Five Divine Abilities."

Li Zhouwei fell silent for a moment. The demon took a step forward, the vicious light in his eyes having faded significantly. He finally took the initiative again:

"Whether you are Mount Luoxia’s gambit or not, I have no reason to kill you. I brought you here this time to clarify the situation... Although Mount Luoxia will certainly seek you out once you break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, the true ownership of the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment is not something you alone can decide."

"By the time you reach the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, the Great Ancestor’s condition will remain unknown. Whether you intend to seek an auxiliary position, an intercalary one, or—left with no other choice—reincarnate, will all depend on the situation at that time."

Li Zhouwei silently exhaled in relief. He bowed and replied, "The Great Ancestor was harmed by Mount Luoxia. The dragon lineage has been an ally for a millennium. Zhouwei can still distinguish right from wrong."

The Beihai Dragon King did not answer him, instead walking step-by-step up to the highest jade platform. His already massive body cast immense shadows. Standing at the edge of the dais, he looked up and said softly, "I must collect this [White Qilin Blood]. First, I have my own use for it. Second, it serves as an excuse to deal with Xiang Chun. But rest assured, you will not suffer a loss in this matter. I will have someone bring you spiritual items..."

Li Zhouwei looked up. He knew this trial was unavoidable, but he still had an unconfirmed suspicion. Sensing the Dragon King was currently amenable, he seized the chance to ask, "There is one thing I am unsure if I should ask... Among the dragon lineage... which one has such close ties to my Wei Li clan that they would intervene to save me?"

Dongfang Lieyun glanced at him. "That is a long story... It has much to do with Daoist Master Zipei from years past, and it is not convenient for me to speak of it here. If you are interested in investigating, continue heading east. Past the Crimson Reef Island region, there is a sea to the north called the Lie Sea. Go there and ask yourself."

The Dragon King's expression darkened slightly. "That dog Changxiao, however, is sharp. He sensed something was amiss. Whether he intended to or not, he understood he had become Mount Luoxia’s pawn, and now he’s hiding... I wonder who he is colluding with in the shadows..."

Li Zhouwei understood the implications of this. He bowed. "Many thanks to the dragon lineage for intervening!"

Dongfang Lieyun gave a slight wave of his hand. Wind and clouds surged through the crystal palace. Tides of white vapor poured in from outside, swiftly climbing the jade-green steps until they swirled past their calves.

Dongfang Lieyun and Li Zhouwei stood together within this white vapor, as if atop the highest peaks of the sky. The surrounding crystalline, emerald scenery was completely obscured, leaving only an endless white expanse and the nearby jade platform.

The vapor instantly coalesced, condensing beside them into the form of a young man. He was dressed in immaculate white robes, his hair neatly combed. His face was slightly round, his eyebrows short and delicate, and his eyes pure black. He offered a classic, elegant bow:

"Dongfang Heyun greets Your Majesty."

The Dragon King shifted his red eyes. "I have told you several times, there is no need for such courtesy. You are now master of your own divine abilities. If you continue this way, I will be the one who feels awkward."

Dongfang Heyun smiled slightly, but his bowed back did not straighten. "Proper etiquette must be observed. This is something I learned from the human clans in ancient times, and I have benefited from it ever since. I cannot simply discard it just because my strength has increased and I have learned a few divine abilities..."

The demon was very polite to him and didn't argue, merely nodding. Dongfang Heyun then turned his gaze to Li Zhouwei, nodded slightly, and smiled. "So the White Qilin is here. It truly has been a long time... I wanted to visit Daoist Friend Xizhi several times, but he is always in the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, and it is inconvenient for me to see him there."

Logically, the dragon lineage had no fear of the Azure Pond Sect. There were few places in the Eastern Sea or Southern Sea that a dragon could not go. At the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, the most he might encounter was Si Boxiu, and to put it bluntly, Dongfang Heyun really didn't need to give Daoist Master Yuanxiu much face.

Yet Dongfang Heyun said it was "inconvenient," making it unclear if he was just being polite or if there was something preventing him from entering the Shitang. Li Zhouwei bowed, offering a casual courtesy: "My clan elder has also mentioned Senior’s grace and holds you in high esteem. If Senior wishes to meet, you need only send word, and we will naturally select a place to host you."

Dongfang Heyun smiled and nodded politely. High above, the Beihai Dragon King gestured. The white-robed young man retrieved a dark gold box from his sleeve, adorned with the subtle etching of a rampant qilin.

Dongfang Heyun gently stroked the box, seemingly chanting an incantation. The dark gold box popped open automatically. Inside, nestled on folded black silk, sat a round porcelain dish the size of a pastry, filled with a shimmering, golden-white liquid.

The moment this golden-white spiritual item appeared, it was as if a sun of the same color had risen in the clouds. The light was dazzling; ten thousand rays of dawn burst through the vapor, illuminating the entire white domain.

Dongfang Heyun extended a hand, and a fierce wind instantly gathered the clouds from all directions, forcing all the nascent sunlight back into the box. Only then did the surrounding scenery return to normal. He smiled.

"This item is surely familiar to you, Daoist Friend. It is called [White Du Blood]. In ancient times, it was known as the [Shuyang Victorious Qilin Light]. The beast of the Bright Yang is the [Shuyang]. The Shuyang's eldest son was called [Shengming]—that is, the very first White Qilin. During a solar eclipse, the light that falls from the White Qilin becomes [White Du Blood]."

The Li family was indeed familiar with the name [White Du Blood]. Years ago, when Li Ximing was preparing to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, this was one of the Bright Yang spiritual items on his list. No wonder they had never found a trace of it; if the White Qilin was extinct, how could [White Du Blood] exist? Although there was often more than one way to condense a spiritual item, this one was almost certainly tied to the White Qilin.

But Li Zhouwei had a more pressing concern. He looked up, seizing the chance. "You all refer to me as a White Qilin. How do I differ from [Shengming]?"

Dongfang Heyun chuckled. "You possess the destiny of a White Qilin, and that destiny is abundant—so rich it is as if you are the reincarnation of the White Qilin itself. However, you lack the *essence* of the White Qilin. That is why you cultivated the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao, to complete that essence. Once you break through the Golden Core, you will be no different from the Victorious Qilin... When that time comes, during an eclipse, the [Shuyang Victorious Qilin Light] will fall from you as well."

"It is only because you already possessed such a complete White Qilin destiny that the Life Divine Ability of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao came so naturally to you... If you had entered the Buddhist Dao, you would have instantly attained a position. The Undefeated King of Brightness was just like that."

This was rare information. Li Zhouwei quickly asked, "Is the Life Divine Ability the same as destiny?"

Dongfang Heyun patiently explained: "The Life Divine Ability is still a divine ability. Possessing the destiny makes cultivating the Life Divine Ability easy, but the Life Divine Ability cannot create destiny. Once one ascends to a Fruition Attainment, it will naturally be conferred upon cultivators of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao. The Metallic Essence is not the point; the *position* is the key. It is only rumored that the great cultivators of antiquity—figures at the Immortal Lord level—could rely on Metallic Essence to birth destiny."

Li Zhouwei was extremely sharp. Hearing this, he immediately understood. 'It seems the key to everything is attaining the Fruition Attainment. Seeking destiny through essence... is perhaps truly seeking the Fruition Attainment through essence, and then gaining destiny via the Fruition Attainment. Thus, completing both...'

Since the Beihai Dragon King was still waiting above, he said no more. Dongfang Heyun continued, "Preparation prevents calamity. We are taking this measure of [White Qilin Blood] from you not just because Lady Xiang Chun requires it, but because His Majesty must also inspect it. We are primarily examining the bloodline; we do not need this item for its spiritual properties. Doing this *before* the Purple Mansion Realm is an act that damages your foundation, but if we waited until *after* the Purple Mansion, the damage would be extremely difficult to remedy."

Dongfang Heyun maintained his amicable attitude and offered the explanation. Li Zhouwei finally understood.

'So that's how it is! They are truly cautious. Even now, they still need to inspect my bloodline... Xiang Chun needing the spiritual item is just a pretext. The dragon lineage is extracting it themselves, verifying that I am truly the White Qilin of the Wei Li clan, and then casually gifting it to Xiang Chun. The intermediate process is what matters most!'

Dongfang Heyun brought the small, pastry-sized porcelain dish over. "With this [White Du Blood], you only need to refine it. When I extract your essence blood from the outside, it will not harm your foundation; it may even consolidate and deepen your cultivation."

The young man was, as ever, courteous, even making a small joke. "Of course you cannot use this much. Just a drop on your glabella is more than enough. If you had waited until after the Purple Mansion Realm, you would have needed the entire portion."

He seemed hesitant to touch the spiritual item directly, merely offering it forward. Li Zhouwei extended his index finger and touched it. His fingertip grew intensely hot. When he brushed it against his glabella, no liquid remained on his hand, but a surging radiance emerged from the spot between his brows.

Li Zhouwei sat cross-legged on the jade platform. Dongfang Heyun formed seals nearby, seemingly examining something, as dots of golden liquid quickly gathered at the tip of his other hand.

The Beihai Dragon King observed from his high seat with lowered eyes. Time passed. Dongfang Heyun retracted his hand, now holding a golden bead of liquid the size of a fingernail.

Li Zhouwei remained seated with his eyes shut tight, his face pale. The Profound Light from his glabella enveloped his entire body, rapidly replenishing his vital energy. This was clearly not a process that would end quickly. Dongfang Heyun raised his hand, and the sea of clouds swiftly surged to cover him, isolating and protecting him.

He hurried up the platform, offering the golden bead with both hands. "Your Majesty, please inspect it."

Dongfang Lieyun, on the main seat, gently took the bead and examined it in his palm. After a long moment, the red-eyed Dragon King said in a low voice, "Although this is not a detailed inspection... it is, at the very least, of the orthodox Bright Yang lineage. There is no mistake..."

He pondered for a long time before speaking again, quietly. "Heyun, I find his personality lacks the dominance and ruthlessness... it does not resemble a White Qilin... yet it also lacks the insidious volatility of a White Cicada. If I had to say... he reminds me more of Emperor Gong of Wei."

Dongfang Heyun smiled slightly and bowed. "In this subordinate’s view... that is perfectly normal. After all, the Great Ancestor of Wei is in an abnormal state, and the Bright Yang has likewise been affected. The signs were already present during Emperor Gong's time. For him to resemble Emperor Gong now, is that not perfectly logical? Lacking dominance and tyranny is actually better. We need not worry that his temperament is too fierce, causing him to rush headlong for that Fruition Attainment... This is truly ideal."

"Indeed." The Beihai Dragon King couldn't help but nod. "No matter how much they influence the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment, they cannot bestow several lines of destiny at once. Calculating the days, Mount Luoxia is about to move on the Bright Yang's descent again. We must watch over this side; how much can they manage over there? One Li Zhouwei is the most they can handle, and he is safe right under our noses..."

Dongfang Heyun nodded respectfully. "The Bright Yang Auxiliary Position is extremely difficult to obtain. The Dongli Sect has researched the Li Fire Intercalary Position, but it is no simple matter either, especially right under Mount Luoxia’s watch, and having to cultivate the divine abilities... I just wonder what the North will say of this."

At the mention of this, the demon on the high seat clearly hesitated. He lowered his voice. "It is still early, but we had to mention it to him first, to make him wary and vigilant toward Mount Luoxia... lest he be too passive later..."

He put away the golden droplet and stood. "I am making a trip to Yinzhou Island. If he emerges from seclusion, explain things to him and send him on his way."

# Chapter 819: Tai'e

Li Zhouwei awoke from his deep meditation. Spiritual energy surged through his body like a roaring river, his aura stable, his cultivation base smooth and perfected. The light of his Immortal Foundation shone clear and bright.

'With the help of the White Dew Blood, I truly avoided significant harm this time,' he thought. 'But activating my Essence Blood is a serious matter. Even taking a spiritual item of this quality only managed to offset the cost and stabilize my cultivation base.'

This success was also due to Dongfang Heyun controlling the dosage perfectly. Bright Yang possesses properties that enhance fertility. While Dragon-kind are generally magnanimous, they prioritize their own Dragon heirs above all else, making them naturally miserly when it came to any spiritual item related to Bright Yang.

"Hooo..."

He exhaled a stream of white vapor and opened his eyes. The ethereal mists around him still drifted and billowed, making him feel as if he were lost in an infinite sea of clouds. All traces of the Crystal Palace had vanished. The Beihai Sea Dragon King was also gone; only the youth in white robes remained standing quietly at his side.

He didn't know how long he had been cultivating, but Dongfang Heyun's gaze seemed never to have moved from him. The moment Li Zhouwei stirred, the youth offered a thoughtful smile.

"One hundred and twenty-eight days have passed," Dongfang Heyun said. "According to the Li-Wei orthodox calendar... it is now the seventh month. If you are using the Liu-Chu orthodox calendar of the Yue State, it is the twenty-second day of the sixth month."

Li Zhouwei already knew that the Yue State followed the Liu-Chu calendar, which differed from the reckoning used by the Li Clan's Wei State. Yet Dongfang Heyun stated it so naturally, as if he had once lived in Wei and the conversion of dates was second nature to him. Li Zhouwei felt a slight shock ripple through his heart.

'Just how ancient is he? Dragon Monarch Beijia is a Hornless Dragon. If Dongfang Heyun truly is the first breath exhaled by Dragon Monarch Beijia, doesn't that mean he is nearly as old as the Dragon Monarch himself?!'

Struck by the realization, he first bowed respectfully and said:

"Thank you, Senior, for watching over me. Nearly four months have passed... Senior is truly erudite, to even know the Wei calendar."

Dongfang Heyun ignored the compliment and gestured for him to rise. The clouds filling the palace began to shift, converging beneath their feet until a spot of utter blackness materialized. Only then did the youth say:

"It is merely habit. Fellow Daoist, please."

Dongfang Heyun seemed to call everyone Fellow Daoist. He stepped into the Great Void. Li Zhouwei immediately saw the void filled with the deep, shimmering Light of Converging Waters—undoubtedly a Grand Array belonging to Dragon-kin. As Dongfang Heyun moved through the Great Void, he continued:

"The matter concerning the Lie Sea originated as a favor owed to Daoist Master Zipei."

"During the North-South Conflict long ago, it became necessary to open Anhuai Heaven. This released those portions of the Essence of True Qi and, in doing so, also revealed the status of the True Qi Fruition Attainment. The entity occupying that Fruition Attainment... is likely gone. This event greatly benefited my Dragon-kin, so Daoist Master Zipei seized the opportunity to make a transaction with us. As for her true motive..."

Dongfang Heyun shook his head, his expression caught between a smile and something else.

"To this day, it remains unknown."

Li Zhouwei’s heart sank. While the Li Clan and Purple Smoke were not entirely unconnected, their relationship was casual at best. They certainly had no deep ties to Zipei herself. After a moment of thought, he asked:

"Senior, you are sending me to..."

"Hoh."

Dongfang Heyun smiled slightly and replied:

"We just exited the Grotto-Heaven; naturally, we are heading toward the Beihai Sea. If you have a destination in mind, I can accompany you part of the way and see you there."

"You need not worry about Changxiao for now. As long as you don't stumble directly into one of the Changxiao Sect's few overseas outposts, he lacks the inclination to hunt you down. As for returning inland... that remains somewhat precarious."

Li Zhouwei understood his meaning. The open seas were ultimately the territory of Dragon-kin; whatever plots or hidden dangers existed, they would not be aimed at him here. But once he returned inland, Dragon-kin had no ability to intervene. While Changxiao wouldn't dare kill him, his formidable Life Divine Ability meant he surely possessed other insidious methods.

After saying this, Dongfang Heyun nodded slightly and added:

"It just means that Daoist Master of yours will have to endure a little more hardship."

Li Zhouwei replied:

"Since that is the case, I will trouble Senior to drop me at the nearest marketplace. I have several Dharma artifacts on hand that I must dispose of cleanly; traveling the seas while holding them is inherently unsafe."

Li Zhouwei ideally wanted to trade directly with Dragon-kin. They possessed the finest goods and had no fear of handling items belonging to the Changxiao Sect. However, the opportunity had not presented itself, and he suspected Dongfang Heyun lacked the authority to approve such a transaction. He posed the request deliberately, curious to see how the youth would respond.

"Easily done!"

As expected, Dongfang Heyun didn't comment further. He simply raised an eyebrow, peered out from the Great Void, and replied:

"In the Beihai Sea, you have the Changliu Mountain Marketplace. To the east, there is a place called Tai'e Island, a small trading market run by the Azure Pond Sect in the Hetian Sea. To the west is Mount Duan; it has a market, but it's best avoided. Further south lies the Vermillion Sea."

Li Zhouwei nodded, understanding the options. He felt a twinge of regret; he had originally wanted to continue east to see the Lie Sea at the far edge of the ocean. He said:

"Then I must trouble Senior to take me to Tai'e Island."

"Very well. Tai'e Island... that is also a new name."

Dongfang Heyun called it a new name, though given his age, "new" could have meant any time in the last several centuries. The youth nodded. After traveling only a short while longer, they burst through the Great Void and returned to the mortal realm. Li Zhouwei felt his footing lighten as he took to the air, realizing the white-robed young man beside him had already vanished. Only his elegant voice lingered:

"It is an Immortal Sect outpost, after all. It is inappropriate for me to draw closer. This spot is barely a hundred li from Tai'e Island; you may fly there yourself."

Li Zhouwei descended on his beam of light and bowed toward the empty sky. He let out a long breath, feeling himself relax considerably.

'I finally got through that!'

While Dragon-kin had shown him little malice, being surrounded by them—a Peak Purple Mansion Realm expert here, a Purple Mansion Realm Spirit Demon there, all of them high-status figures from the revered Dragon lineage—was inherently stressful. He was never truly at ease in the presence of such powerful demon beasts.

'I also managed to get an update on Changxiao, which means I don't need to be quite so wary of him. I can operate with more freedom now.'

Although the affair between Luoxia and Dragon-kin was complicated, it was fortunately not a problem for someone at his Foundation Establishment Realm to consider. Li Zhouwei never worried about such lofty matters, and his mood brightened instantly. He looked toward the horizon and was startled to see that the ocean before him was a deep, pervasive violet-red.

The seawater here was distinctly purplish-red, laced with faint traces of blue-violet. The typical azure blue of the Hetian Sea was nowhere to be seen. As far as he could see, the water was an interwoven tapestry of purple and blue. He immediately rode his light higher, appreciating the strange vista with growing curiosity.

After flying only a dozen li, he spotted a rogue cultivator hovering on the wind above the sea’s surface. Li Zhouwei needed directions. With a casual wave of his hand, a beam of Profound Light flared, and he rematerialized a short distance from the other cultivator.

Li Zhouwei's speed was already far beyond that of a typical cultivator, and he was further augmented by the Light-Shifting Shuttle Technique of his Yuan'E Soft Soft Armor. The rogue cultivator had no time to react. Seeing a Late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator materialize nearby, he instantly broke out in a cold sweat. He noted the newcomer's extraordinary bearing and the quality of his artifacts, recognizing this was no ordinary person. He quickly bowed.

"This humble cultivator greets the Daoist!"

Li Zhouwei had no intention of making things difficult for him and simply inquired:

"Which direction is Tai'e Island? And why is the seawater here violet-red?"

The cultivator hurriedly replied:

"Reporting to the Daoist, Tai'e Island is just over seventy li to the southeast. This area is known as the Violet-Slaying Minor Reefs, one of the few territories near Tai'e Island where resources can still be gathered. It originally produced Spirit Sand, but it was completely excavated by cultivators years ago. All that remains is the vast Cinnabar ore vein beneath the seabed. The seawater is saturated with Cinnabar dust, which gives it this violet-red appearance from afar."

He gave an ingratiating smile and added:

"Both the name and the reef itself have an origin. Years ago, a Senior Li known as the 'Astral Golden Bowstring' was stationed here when a Water Ape attacked. It was an incredibly imposing beast; I heard it was a Great Demon Beast nearing the Purple Mansion Realm. That Senior shot it dead right here with three arrows. Its body dissolved into a hundred li of Cinnabar, which formed this very reef. I heard it was because that Demon beast possessed... some kind of... Whole... something..."

Li Zhouwei’s eyebrows lifted, and the corners of his mouth turned up in a smile. His opinion of the rogue cultivator instantly improved. He motioned for the man to fly alongside him, and they both rode their light toward the southeast. "Is that the origin! You are speaking of the Whole Pill. So, who named these 'Violet-Slaying Minor Reefs'? And who is in charge of Tai'e Island these days?"

This rogue cultivator knew how to please, immediately affecting a look of sudden realization. He nodded repeatedly.

"Right, right! The Whole Pill! Your Excellency is truly knowledgeable. The 'Violet-Slaying Minor Reefs' weren't even the original name. They were called the 'Ape-Slaying Minor Reefs.' But the Island Lord stationed here is surnamed Yuan, and 'Ape-Slaying' sounded... well, it wasn't pleasant to his ears. So, they just substituted the color instead."

Li Zhouwei was flying extremely fast. In the time it took to exchange these few words, a large, ochre-yellow island had already appeared on the horizon. As they descended toward it, the rogue cultivator spoke respectfully:

"Your Excellency, please give your orders. This lowly one is Xiahou Damo. I am quite familiar with this island. To be able to serve the Daoist would be this humble cultivator's good fortune."

In these seas, encountering a high-status Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator traveling alone, without an entourage, was a rare opportunity. The rogue cultivator was trying to seize it. Li Zhouwei simply nodded.

"Take me to the place that deals in Dharma artifacts."

Since the island’s guarding cultivator was surnamed Yuan and belonged to the Azure Pond Sect, it had to be the Yuan Clan of Mushroom Forest Plains. Decades ago, Li Zhouwei would have needed no guide and would have been obligated to pay a formal visit. But now that their two families had parted ways, he couldn't be bothered and simply let Xiahou Damo lead on.

After only two streets, they arrived at the most opulent establishment on the island, a towering four-story pavilion. When Xiahou Damo stepped across the threshold, the attendants on either side barely gave him a second glance. When Li Zhouwei followed him in, however, they instantly lit up with brilliant smiles, bowing and greeting him as "Your Excellency."

Li Zhouwei wasted no time and proceeded directly to the highest floor. A man in blue robes, also at the Foundation Establishment Realm, moved to greet them. His judgment was clearly superior to Xiahou Damo's. He politely inquired:

"May I ask which noble lineage Your Excellency hails from...?"

Li Zhouwei took his seat firmly and replied:

"Supreme-grade Foundation Establishment Dharma artifacts, taken by killing a core disciple. Buy them if you can. An elder of my family also cultivates with the Azure Pond Sect, so do not waste my time with pleasantries."

He glanced up, his golden pupils sweeping the man's face. The features struck him as familiar. "What is your name?"

The man’s expression had already changed. While quietly dispatching someone downstairs, he replied with utmost respect:

"This junior hails from Jiangbei. My surname is Zhou, and my name is Boyun."

When Li Zhouwei heard Jiangbei combined with "Boyun," he immediately recalled a certain saber master. Comparing the man's features to his memory, he raised an eyebrow.

"Gongsun Boyun... I have met your elder brother. His saber technique is passable."

Zhou Boyun broke into a cold sweat upon hearing this. Fortunately, Li Zhouwei had no interest in pursuing the matter. He retrieved several jade boxes from his sleeve, setting them out one by one.

"Two Golden Thorn Dharma artifacts from the Golden Tang Gate; both are decent. One Green Gourd from the Water Mansion; this one is peak-grade among Foundation Establishment items, true heirloom quality. And one wooden staff—standard, but it can nourish the physical body and assist recovery."

He then produced an ordinary cloth storage pouch and set it on the table.

"The contents of this are also quite valuable, and should be easier to move."

Zhou Boyun bowed.

"May I ask... what Senior requires in return?"

Normally, no one would trade items like this purely for spirit stones; it simply wasn't necessary, and artifacts of this grade often couldn't be bought with spirit stones alone. However, for Li Zhouwei—and indeed, for the Li Clan as a whole—most items that were not useful at the Purple Mansion Realm held little significance. This made the transaction difficult.

Li Zhouwei considered this briefly and replied:

"I require one exceptional Dharma shield and one flying shuttle, or other Dharma artifacts of comparable quality."

He paused, then finally asked his most important question:

"Do you have any Purple Mansion Realm-level cultivation resources or materials here?"

The question left Zhou Boyun completely flustered. He was merely a Guest Elder on this island; how could he possibly have access to such things? His face flushed with embarrassment. Fortunately, a commotion arose from the stairwell, followed by hearty laughter.

"I wonder which Fellow Daoist has come to grace my Tai'e Island as a guest!"

Looking as if he’d received a pardon, Zhou Boyun quickly retreated to the side, bowing respectfully.

"Island Lord!"

Li Zhouwei knew the man surnamed Yuan had arrived. His expression remained neutral. He was not naturally arrogant and normally would have stood to show respect, but the current relationship between their two families was deeply awkward. It would not be an exaggeration to say a knot of enmity now existed between them. He could only lower his gaze and say nothing.

An old man ascended the pavilion stairs. He looked ancient, leaning heavily on a cane, with a full head of white hair, though his face was reasonably kindly. When he saw the young man remain seated, his expression soured with displeasure.

Had any ordinary cultivator dared to show such disrespect, Yuan Hu'e would have already started cursing. But this guest was extremely young and his cultivation profound. He worried Li Zhouwei might be a direct lineage disciple from some major power, so he dared not let his displeasure show too clearly.

His Tai'e Island was small, after all. Even bearing the Azure Pond Sect’s name, it was easily looked down upon. Worse, most core disciples from major sects knew that the Azure Pond Sect's own Purple Mansion Realm foundation was currently teetering. Glancing at the jade boxes spread on the table, he formed a guess and spoke in a tone that was half-polite, half-warning.

"This one is Yuan Hu'e, of the Yuan Clan of Mushroom Forest Plains. I humbly serve as the Island Lord of Tai'e and as the Peak Lord of Mercy Peak within the Azure Pool Sect, stationed here by sect orders."

"Might I ask who Fellow Daoist is? You needn't worry that my Azure Pool Sect cannot afford this exchange. The Violet-Slaying Spirit Trace is still active, and the Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow holds sway over the Southern Sea and the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang. Shipping what you need would not take long."

Seeing that the man truly did not recognize him, Li Zhouwei understood. This old man must have been stationed here for many years, missing the recent events inland and rarely, if ever, returning. He replied casually:

"My reputation cannot compare to Old Senior's."

He smiled slightly and added:

"This junior hails from the Small Lake Within the Mainland. My surname is Li. My given name is Zhouwei."

The pavilion fell utterly silent. Zhou Boyun looked completely bewildered, clearly still trying to place the location "Small Lake Within the Mainland
." But the expression on Yuan Hu'e’s face froze solid. His pupils dilated rapidly, his gaze fixing belatedly on the young man’s golden eyes.

His mind roared into a state of blank white noise. A chill ran down his limbs, followed by a complex wave of dread and utter horror.

'Li Zhouwei... He is that Pride of the Li Clan, the Li family’s White Qilin!'

'The White Qilin Li Zhouwei! The one who ambushed and killed the Golden Tang Gate Master, Situ Mo! The one who fought six opponents at once, endured the spiritual artifact [Yongjing Profound Ring], and forcibly executed Yunan Zi—a core disciple of the Purple Mansion Realm lineage and a cultivator at the Peak Foundation Establishment Realm!'

'Why has this Baleful Star come here?! Is he not afraid of Changxiao?!'

# Chapter 820: The Deng Clan

Yuan Hu'e froze, rooted to the spot, utterly speechless.

Zhou Boyun, standing beside him, was still processing the old man’s aggressive stance. He had been anxiously looking for an opening, sensing a perfect opportunity to impress Yuan Hu'e. If Li Zhouwei hadn't immediately exposed his identity, Zhou Boyun would have already jumped in to support the elder, but doing so now might bring disaster upon his own brother. All he could do was steal glances at Yuan Hu'e’s face. The old man’s beard trembled violently as he stammered:

"So... so it is Your Excellency... Please, forgive my disrespect! What ridiculous nonsense I was spouting, daring to speak of Your Excellency's own elders..."

All the false bravado evaporated, replaced by a mixture of deep embarrassment and terror. "This old man was blind... Back when Lord Li Xuanfeng was stationed on this island... this humble one admired him immensely. I often sought his guidance and have always carried that gratitude in my heart. To think that Your Excellency would arrive today... not only did I fail to welcome you properly, I failed to even recognize you. A terrible sin... a terrible sin..."

The reversal was so abrupt it left Zhou Boyun stunned. But he heard every word clearly, and a cold dread washed over him.

'My heavens... Li Xuanfeng was a Li. Li Xizhi is also a Li. They are one family! This Li Zhouwei is from the Moongaze Immortal Clan!'

Only now did Zhou Boyun grasp the severity of the situation, cursing his own foolishness. The old man, however, had already turned on him.

"You, surnamed Zhou!" Yuan Hu'e barked. "When such a distinguished guest arrives, you don't even bother to investigate clearly? You just send a messy report about some 'dangerous man at the door'... I ought to punish you severely for this!"

'Ah?'

Zhou Boyun broke out in a cold sweat. Even the Yuan family couldn't withstand the Li family's current power, let alone a mere rogue cultivator like himself. Li Xuanfeng’s reputation in this region was immense; several cultivators had even tried to mimic his mastery of the bow. Zhou Boyun didn't dare utter another word, standing rigid and silent as a mute.

Li Zhouwei watched the old man twist the narrative, blaming his own transgression on "failing to recognize him in person" while shoving Zhou Boyun forward as the scapegoat. Li Zhouwei said nothing, letting his silence amplify the pressure.

Yuan Hu'e continued to ramble, but seeing that Li Zhouwei offered no reply, he finally let out a long, trembling sigh.

"Ai!"

Yuan Hu'e had always held Li Xuanfeng in both respect and awe; he'd never had the slightest intention of offending him. But he was stationed overseas, a cultivator originally promoted by the Ning family, making his position sensitive. He had no authority in Yuan family matters, only the privilege to listen.

When he first heard that Yuan Hudu and Yuan Huyuan were playing both sides, he knew disaster was coming.

As it turned out, Yuan Chengzhao, back in the sect, was just as unreliable. The relationship between the two families had been excellent, built on the friendship between their seniors and generations of goodwill. They had even been discussing a marriage alliance. Instead, those two old fools and one shortsighted junior sold out Yuan Chengdao, creating the irreparable feud that existed today.

Now, Yuan Hudu had died when his old injuries relapsed, and Yuan Zibin had taken control of the family. Yuan Zibin was an arrogant, perverse tyrant. It was clear that over three generations, the Yuan family had rotted to the core. This decay had implicated Yuan Hu'e, marking him as an enemy of a Purple Mansion Realm power. With that power now standing right in front of him, Yuan Hu'e felt as though his heart were bleeding.

"The juniors back home... they don't know any better..." he whispered.

The grudge between the Li and Yuan families could not be resolved with a few simple words. Li Zhouwei felt he had neither the qualification nor the inclination to mediate this grievance on behalf of his elders. He waved his hand dismissively.

"Tai'e Island Lord, there is no need for explanations. I am only passing through. I will leave as soon as I have traded for the spiritual items I need."

He gestured to the jade box on the table. Only now did Yuan Hu'e properly inspect its contents. He carefully took the items out, appraised them, and reported nervously:

"Your Excellency, Tai'e Island currently has a white-skinned fan named the [White Yin Fan]. It is a Dharma artifact of the Profound Qi dao, capable of stirring clouds of black and yellow energy. It is quite rare. It was consigned here for sale by a Peak Lord from the Azure Pond. It should be of suitable value."

Li Zhouwei finally heard something interesting. Dharma artifacts of the Profound Qi dao were uncommon, and his own **Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts** catalyzed an Obsidian Flame that was derived from that very path. This fan would be a perfect fit.

"Which Peak Lord is this, and what do they require in exchange?"

Yuan Hu'e wiped a bead of sweat from his brow. "He is the former Peak Lord of Sever Peak, also a Mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. His surname is Deng, given name Yuzhi. He is over a century old and cultivates in this region, so he left the item here for consignment..."

He shot a look at Zhou Boyun. Looking as though he had just received a pardon, Zhou Boyun scrambled out of the room to fetch the man. Li Zhouwei’s interest sharpened, and he nodded to himself.

'So, he's from the Deng family.'

Yuan Hu'e’s gaze returned to the table, locking onto the long staff. He studied it for several moments, clearly tempted, yet wary of personally using an item belonging to the Changxiao Gate. He hesitated.

"As for this long staff," he said, "this old man can make the decision to keep it on the island for consignment."

He fumbled inside his sleeve for a moment before producing a lustrous, pure white pearl of light. He offered it tentatively.

"This is a protective artifact, the [Aegis of Mystic Light], from the Clear Qi path. It is compatible with all cultivation paths. Perhaps Your Excellency would take this for now? We will leave the staff here to be sold. Once it finds a buyer, we can compare the values. If there is a shortfall, I will deliver the difference; if there is an excess, you may repay me. We can settle the matter later on the lake..."

Li Zhouwei needed only a single glance to understand. The old man coveted the staff. Life-preserving items were invaluable to aging cultivators like him, but he feared the methods of the Changxiao Gate and wanted time to have the staff inspected by others first.

The [Aegis of Mystic Light] was indeed versatile, but defensive barrier artifacts were typically expensive. Since Yuan Hu'e was offering this as a simple exchange, it likely offered meager protection. Still, the long staff was useless to Li Zhouwei, and he had no desire to waste time running around various marketplaces. He pushed the wooden staff across the table and accepted the white pearl.

"Your Excellency, please look... this is the catalog of treasures currently curated on the island."

Yuan Hu'e took possession of the wooden staff, stroking it lovingly. He was clearly ill at ease in Li Zhouwei’s presence. Making an excuse about needing to verify the staff and make inquiries, he quickly departed.

Li Zhouwei picked up the catalog and began to read. Before long, he heard Zhou Boyun’s respectful voice from the doorway.

"Your Excellency, please come in!"

A middle-aged man entered. His hair was graying and he was exceptionally thin, with shifty, rodent-like features. Despite his appearance, his expression was calm. His small eyes swept the room and settled on Li Zhouwei. He offered a slight bow and sighed.

"Family Head Li... we finally meet. I am Deng Yuzhi, of the Deng Clan of Simin..."

The Deng Clan was a minor family. Although they possessed a Foundation Establishment cultivator to hold the line, they had been forced by the Chi Clan to practice a bizarre cultivation art that caused successive generations to go mad and perish. Only after Chi Wei fell and Chi Zhiyun intervened to ease relations did the Deng Clan’s situation improve. Their disciples finally stopped practicing that technique. Deng Yuzhi was the last survivor of it.

The Deng family had established a friendship with the Li family long ago. Deng Yuzhi’s older brother, Deng Qiuzhi, was reportedly a close friend of the Sword Immortal Li Chejing. Years ago, Li Zhouwei had even used the Deng family as an intermediary to send a letter to Li Quantao. Though they rarely interacted, the bond was solid. Li Zhouwei rose and invited him to sit.

Although Deng Yuzhi was unsightly, he carried himself with an unexpected grace. He produced a jade pot and matching cups, poured the tea, and smiled. "Congratulations, Family Head."

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly. "Greetings, Senior. Is your family faring better these days?"

Deng Yuzhi revealed an unpleasant smile. "We have been well for the past century. Once Chi Wei died, we could finally breathe. Those who held the deepest malice toward my family, like Ning Hejing and Chi Zhiyan, are also dead, which eased things further. When Chi Zhiyun fell some time ago, my family even mourned him extensively..."

Li Zhouwei frowned. "Chi Zhiyun fell? Your clan... what are your intentions toward the remnants of the Chi Clan?"

Deng Yuzhi replied, "When the Chi Clan Head was assassinated, I drew my sword and set out immediately. I intended to seize the opportunity to slaughter his entire remaining family, from the elders down to the children. Halfway there, my own sons and daughters stopped me..."

"Perhaps it is because I spent all my years running between Mount Yi and Azure Pond, leaving me no time to raise them properly. They do not recognize the sins our ancestors suffered, generation after generation of being butchered. Chi Wei has been dead for over a hundred years. Who cares about some distant uncle from a branch family who died that long ago? They only see me as cruel. They fear my rage will bring disaster upon them, worried that Chi Buzi will return one day to settle the score."

He sipped his tea. "When I was in my twenties, my brother was murdered. I have hated for over a hundred years. I felt my Deng family was being devoured, generation after generation, and that this blood feud was carved into my very bones. I always believed that if the day for vengeance ever came, every member of the Deng family would fight to the death... But when I returned home, it seemed no one remembered. Or if they did remember, they felt no hatred. They only felt that Chi Zhiyun had saved them, sparing them from being devoured for the last century."

He pursed his lips, his harelip trembling grotesquely. "My very appearance is the consequence of my father practicing that wretched art. My face is ugly. When I returned home after a hundred years, they discovered that my heart is also ugly. They believe I only want to commit this act—an act that would bring endless calamity to our family—purely as revenge for my own hideous face. They don't realize that I *could* change my appearance now; I deliberately keep this face to remember."

"I went back three times. I walked the lands for ages. Gradually, I felt it was all meaningless. Perhaps I don't even hate them that much anymore. So I left Simin and came here."

His tone was flat as he asked, "What about your clan? Your family deserves great credit for the Chi Clan's destruction. The Chi Clan still has mortals who haven't died out. Does your clan ever think of exterminating them to finalize your revenge?"

Li Zhouwei remained silent.

Deng Yuzhi continued, "This whole affair is impossible to unravel. Your family lost a Sword Immortal. My family lost an unknown, worthless Qi Refining cultivator. On the surface, your family's hatred seems more justified. But didn't we both lose a family member? Because yours was a Sword Immortal, he is easier to mourn, his vengeance easier to justify. As for an unknown nobody... no one cares that he was murdered. Who cares?"

"It's just... he was my brother. So I hate a little more."

He laughed self-deprecatingly, his harelip clamping shut. He retrieved a brocade jade box from his sleeve. "Back when I visited the Li family, I met Senior Li Tongya and Fellow Daoist Li Xuanling. It is rare to see someone from those days, so I ran my mouth. I heard you want the [White Yin Fan]... It is just as rare to find a buyer so perfectly suited for it."

He placed the box on the table and gently opened it. Inside lay a pure white ivory fan, only the length of a forearm. Its surface was smooth and delicate. The fan’s handle was forged from pure, lusterless Dark Iron.

With a single glance, Li Zhouwei recognized it as a superior Dharma artifact. He was immediately tempted and nodded. "May I know the artifact's origins? And what does Fellow Daoist require in exchange?"

Deng Yuzhi smiled. "This was one of the artifacts my ancestor obtained while serving under the Great Liang. When the Great Liang fell, my ancestor crossed the river and fled south. This spiritual hoard was thus preserved. Unfortunately, later descendants were unfilial and squandered most of it. This artifact eventually fell to me. It should have been returned to the clan, but I was... greatly disappointed. I left hastily. I never imagined the heavens, seeing the hardship of my first half-life, would take pity on me. I unexpectedly had a new son late in life."

His gaze softened, a warmth that made his harsh features seem less unpleasant. He clearly adored this new child.

"An artifact of the Profound Qi path is not a good fit for my own techniques, and I am preparing to establish a property in the Hetian Sea Region for my heir. He cultivates Pit Water. Since the nature of the energy is such that 'Profound Qi transforms to Pit Water and expels Li-Fire,' this fan is even less suitable for him. I was hoping to find my son something reliable to protect his life, and I took a liking to that gourd of yours."

"The path of Water Mansion," he concluded, "is highly suitable, both for myself and for my young son."

Li Zhouwei had heard that the Deng family technique was a rare dual-attribute art, requiring both [Frigid Night-Moon Qi] and [Sinking Heart of Falling Rain]. The former was of the Supreme Yin, and the latter belonged to the Water Mansion path. It was indeed a perfect match.

Slowly, Li Zhouwei shook his head. "That is truly a pity. First, this gourd still contains a tracking imprint left by the Changxiao Gate. If you were to leave it to a junior, it would be an endless source of future calamity. Second, it is, after all, stolen property. I fear that one day, it will be recognized."

Zhou Boyun had clearly failed to explain the risks; middlemen like him always hid half the truth to secure a deal. Hearing Li Zhouwei's warning, a chill ran through Deng Yuzhi. He offered a grateful smile.

"Many thanks for the warning, Fellow Daoist... That is one issue. The materials in your storage pouch are also needed for a formation I am building, but without the gourd as the main trade, it is difficult to exchange for them."

He didn't even mention the artifacts from the Golden Tang Gate. Not only were they of inferior quality, but they were obviously incompatible with the cultivation paths of both him and his son.

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully. He truly desired the [White Yin Fan] and could not let it pass by. In comparison, the Water Mansion gourd was significantly weaker, and with the unresolved imprint lowering its intrinsic value, the decision was clear.

"I am extremely interested in the [White Yin Fan]," Li Zhouwei stated. "I see that Senior is not in a desperate hurry for a day or two. I must travel to the far seas to visit a senior, and my route will take me through many places. This journey will provide the perfect opportunity to handle the gourd—perhaps alter its appearance, and ask a high-level cultivator to wipe the imprint clean. Then it will be whole and complete."

Deng Yuzhi nodded slightly.

Li Zhouwei added, "The original owner of this item was surnamed Zhuang. He was one of those who ambushed me. It will be much safer for everyone once it is properly cleaned."

They exchanged a few more pleasantries, but Deng Yuzhi still looked hesitant. He stood and went outside. Just then, Li Zhouwei saw Zhou Boyun re-entering and stopped him.

"Do you know of the Lie Sea? Are there any maps of it for sale in the marketplace?"

The Lie Sea was supposed to be the new Dragon-Attribute Sea Pasture. Zhou Boyun just shook his head, completely lost. Li Zhouwei had to recall the description given by Dongfang Heyun: the Chain of Seas lay east of Crimson Reef Island, past the Hetian Sea, bordering the Outer Sea.

"In that case," Li Zhouwei said, "bring me a map of Crimson Reef Island."

Zhou Boyun hurried off again. Li Zhouwei returned to studying the secret arts manual alone in the pavilion. After some time, the man returned, handing the map over with utmost respect.

Li Zhouwei smiled. "Gongsun Boyun... your elder brother serves the White Ye Immortal Sect, correct? Why would he bear to let his younger brother remain a simple rogue cultivator here in the Hetian Sea?"

The man stiffened, his face flooding with terror. He was not completely ignorant of affairs in the mainland; he knew Moongaze Lake had fought the White Ye Immortal Sect before. He could only bow deeply.

"My brother established his Immortal Foundation many years ago. He spent his entire savings to push this foolish and inept younger brother into the Foundation Establishment Realm, but he was unwilling for two birds to roost on the same branch. He feared that if disaster struck, both brothers would perish together."

"He told me that although the mainland is rich, it is far too dangerous. He forbade me from going there, and he forbade me from using our family surname, Gongsun. But he sends resources overseas to me every year... He hopes one day I will have enough to start my own family and create a small sect... Only then, he said, can he finally rest easy."

# Chapter 821: The Thunder Pool

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "I have met your older brother, Gongsun Bofan. Despite his humble origins, his disposition is superb. The rogue cultivators in Jiangbei are innumerable, yet he has reached the apex of their path. If we ignore the ineffable hand of fate, he truly isn't far behind Wang Quwan..." He glanced at Zhou Boyun. "While he is formidable, you are stationed here in the Eastern Sea. You must be more cautious. Do not waste his heartfelt efforts!"

The Li Clan had once been enemies of the Capital immortals Dao, though relations had thawed recently. Zhou Boyun's words, however, were far too blunt. They were certainly not complimentary toward the Capital immortals Dao. If the wrong people heard his comments—that 'two birds cannot rest on the same branch'—it would be tantamount to placing a blade against his brother's throat.

It was fortunate that Li Zhouwei was the one present; he held Gongsun Bofan in decent regard, and the conflict between their two families had lessened. Had it been anyone else, they would not hesitate to sow discord between Gongsun Bofan and the Capital immortals Dao. A few choice words shouted during the heat of battle, and even someone as steady as Gongsun Bofan would likely turn pale with fright.

Zhou Boyun, whether he understood the gravity of the warning or not, nodded repeatedly and replied respectfully, "It is only because I saw how divinely mighty you are, my lord. I feared that if I spoke too highly of my brother's relationship with the Capital immortals Dao, I might displease you... That is why I spoke the plain truth."

Li Zhouwei was not an overly charitable man. Having said his piece, he stopped there. He gave a slight nod and exited the private room, sighing inwardly.

'Rogue cultivators, generation after generation... producing a single genius like Gongsun Bofan is already a miracle. How could he possibly have an equally remarkable younger brother? That family of Wang Quwan... how incredibly rare they are.'

As he left the pavilion, Yuan Hu'e hurried over, smiling. "My lord... I was just asking someone to inspect the artifact. Why are you leaving so soon? I haven't even had the chance to host you properly..."

Li Zhouwei knew the man couldn't wait for him to leave, so he didn't waste words, merely waving his hand. "Island Lord, there is no need to see me off!"

He immediately transformed into a ray of Profound Light and streaked away, vanishing toward the horizon.

Only then did Yuan Hu'e straighten his bowed back. His face darkened as he returned to the pavilion, with Zhou Boyun following uneasily behind him.

The old man shut the door firmly and said coldly, "Why didn't you inform me of such a situation sooner! You just sent someone saying it was 'big business'... But he produced an artifact like that! Is he some ordinary person? We couldn't even verify his origins! And now look!"

Zhou Boyun grew increasingly embarrassed and remained silent. Yuan Hu'e's expression was grim. "If not for your brother, do you think you would have this cushy job? You nearly got this old man killed! From now on, you're done here!"

Yuan Hu'e stormed out, leaving Zhou Boyun with that parting glare. He stalked out of the pavilion and returned to his own manor-cave. His anger had faded, replaced by calculation.

'The Mushroom Forest Plains are beyond saving. It's a land of conflict, and the ancestors passed down this fatal legacy. Several generations of elders have cultivated themselves to death pursuing it, and the children grow weaker with every generation. If we stay, what future does the Yuan clan have?'

'Yuan Chengzhao is also a selfish bastard. The Yuan family means nothing compared to his own Dao path. Things have escalated this far, yet he doesn't dare show his face or say a single word. Can't count on him. I must bring a few of the children out here. We will establish a new mountain in this territory, escape that cursed place, and restore the family discipline. We cannot let the lineage be extinguished...'

***

The radiance of the Bright Yang surfaced in the sky as the morning clouds began to glow. The sea glittered with golden light. Floes of ice, large and small, drifted on the surface like countless shards of shattered gold.

The Dragon King of Crimson Reef Island cultivated Cold Qi, sealing it in this land. This Crimson Reef Island was pierced by waves of frigid intent, and icebergs floated everywhere. Li Zhouwei had read the jade slips obtained from Tai'e Island, which recorded that Crimson Reef Island had become quite prosperous in recent years. Many new spirit mines and spirit troves had emerged, attracting a growing number of cultivators.

He flew midway and scanned the area. He didn't spot any Demon beasts, but he did see several flashes of greyish-red flame and heard the crackle of thunder. Two groups of cultivators were engaged in a lively battle atop an iceberg.

Li Zhouwei glanced over. One side wielded ferocious flames that made the opposing artifacts sizzle. The other commanded booming thunder that shattered chunks of the iceberg. A look at their attire and he recognized them immediately.

"One side is Crimson Reef Island, the other is Thunder-Hearing Island. This is a fight between stupid birds and vicious dogs. Both sides stink; neither is any good."

The leader of Crimson Reef Island was a young woman dressed in blue, a stark contrast to the red robes of her companions. The leader of Thunder-Hearing Island wielded two copper alms bowls, thunder crackling between them. He was an old acquaintance: Miao Ye.

This man was a direct descendant of the Miao Family. He had come to the lake before to ask about the Duruo Spear.

Looking closer at the iceberg, he saw that a cluster of ice-blue and white flowers, roughly the size of a fist, had bloomed on the summit. Their stems were vibrant green, rooted directly in the ice. Beside them crouched a black tortoise the height of a man and the size of a large table, trembling as it hid in its shell.

Li Zhouwei recognized it instantly. 'So, it's the Jade Hare Ice Flower... A rare treasure medicine. Legend says it only blooms beneath the Pine of the Wintry Snow. I never expected to find it here.'

'Strange... Even if this flower didn't grow beneath the pine, it absolutely should not be growing on an iceberg. This looks more like a manifestation caused by someone's divine ability breakthrough... It must be the Dragon King of Crimson Reef Island...'

Besides the strangeness of the spiritual object, Miao Ye's status was considerable. He would never travel thousands of miles just to fight over a Jade Hare Ice Flower. Clearly, both groups had other reasons for appearing at Crimson Reef Island; this treasure medicine was just an unexpected skirmish.

The Li Family's enmity with Thunder-Hearing Island wasn't as deep as their hatred for Crimson Reef Island, but it wasn't much better. He swept his gaze over the brawling cultivators, memorized the location, and transformed into light, taking a wide detour.

'After I return from the Lie Sea, I should also find a place for seclusion. I won't leave the Hetian Sea. I can stop by Crimson Reef Island and see just what these two factions are scheming.'

He had already covered most of the distance, and traveling as light was extremely fast. But he suddenly found goose-feather snow falling from the sky. It came down thick and fast, blanketing his entire field of vision in white. The world below became an interweaving canvas of blue and white.

Li Zhouwei smelled the rich scent of pine. On the small reef islands below his feet, countless pine trees burst forth from the stone, shaking in the blizzard, growing taller and taller, only to be quickly buried by the endless snow.

He flew for a hundred miles before the heavy snow began to subside. By the time he reached the outer sea, the snowfall had stopped completely. Li Zhouwei grew suspicious again.

"I've never heard of mastering a divine ability causing such a huge spectacle. It doesn't look like the fall of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator either. It looks more like a Demon beast on Crimson Reef Island breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm... Perhaps one of that Dragon King's subordinates."

He focused and flew on. Following the map's guidance for half a day, he gradually saw a small patch of dark reefs appearing on the edge of the sea. In the distance, the scattered shadows of islands emerged.

Li Zhouwei landed on the reef and looked around. The ground beneath his feet trembled slightly. A carriage, shimmering with purple light, actually rose from the sea's surface. A wave rolled in, carrying sparks of purple lightning.

A female cultivator in a white robe appeared. Her features were delicate, her pupils a deep purple. She led the carriage and spoke politely, "My Mistress invites you. Please, Young Master, come with me!"

Li Zhouwei's ocular art flickered. He perceived that she was a Purple Feather Sparrow and understood that the mistress of the Lie Sea had sent for him. He nodded slightly. "My thanks, Fairy."

"I wouldn't dare!"

The female cultivator, slightly awed, guided him onto the carriage. It was sized for ordinary people, completely unlike the previous Dragon-kin vehicles, which were as large as houses or small hills. This one seemed compact and exquisite.

Li Zhouwei lifted the curtain and entered. A small stove sat in the center, and behind it was only a single soft cushion. It was far too minimalist for the usual Dragon-kin style.

He was extremely familiar with the carriage's interior. He expertly lit the stove and waited, feeling both anticipation and sorrow. The carriage had already leaped into the air. He heard the female cultivator speak.

"Please wait a moment, Young Master. My Mistress is above the Lie Sea at the Profound Firmament Thunder Pool. We will arrive momentarily!"

Li Zhouwei acknowledged her. He watched the misty clouds outside the window gradually turn grey. The carriage beneath him suddenly shook, as if it had landed on something, and then began to race forward.

The thunder on both sides grew denser, and the color of the dark clouds deepened. They pierced the depths of the clouds and finally came to an abrupt halt. Before him was an entirely different scene.

He saw a vast, circular pool of purplish-white, filled with a dense, shimmering thunder liquid. It stretched beyond the horizon. Purple lightning constantly descended from above, smashing into the pool. The strikes were clearly powerful, yet the thunder liquid below, seemingly forged of fine iron, only rippled faintly.

The rim of the pool was a deep cyan, about thirty feet wide, gleaming with the luster of copper and iron and covered in dense thunder patterns. A group of female cultivators in white robes waited quietly by the edge.

Li Zhouwei stepped down. The white-robed cultivator handed the carriage off to another attendant who came to receive it. She gestured slightly and said respectfully, "This way, Young Master."

Li Zhouwei walked forward. The pool's shore vibrated slightly with every celestial thunderclap. After walking a short distance, the cultivator smiled.

"This place was formed by devouring thunder. The metal edge of the pool is the remains of a Grotto-Heaven, and the thunder liquid also poured forth from that Grotto-Heaven. It is called Echoing Thunder Water. It is solid as profound iron; it neither dissipates nor scatters, neither moves nor sounds. And yet, it is thunder."

"Above the Thunder Pool circle thirty-six paths of Profound Thunder and twelve Firmament Thunders. Once you enter, not only can you not fly, but I must urge you, Young Master, *never* draw a metal object. If you must draw an artifact, you absolutely must not point it toward the heavens. The forty-eight thunderbolts will descend and claim your life."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding. Fortunately, the Yuan'E Soft armor he wore was soft armor, without any sharp protrusions. He followed the female cultivator forward as the world behind them was gradually obscured by the dark sea of clouds. He saw a gap in the pool's edge, but the purplish-white thunder liquid did not flow out, standing erect as if it were solid.

The cultivator stepped onto the thunder pool. With a metallic clang, she walked directly upon the thunder liquid. Li Zhouwei followed her forward; it was indeed as hard as iron rock.

In the very center of the Thunder Pool stood a small, silver-white palace, not at all imposing. Li Zhouwei raised his gaze and saw a person leaning in the pavilion above.

The woman was draped in purplish-white feathers. She had a high-bridged nose, willow-leaf eyebrows, and almond eyes. Her long hair was coiled behind her, fastened with a single silver-white hairpin, while the rest of her dark hair cascaded like a waterfall from the pavilion window.

A purple mist filled her eyes. The purplish-white feathered robe pulsed as if breathing. Behind her, a faint purplish-white disc shimmered. She merely sat there, yet in his spiritual sense, she was a blinding radiance—a terrifying concentration of extreme thunder, compressed within that body, which otherwise appeared tranquil and gentle.

Li Zhouwei exhaled deeply. He bowed profoundly, as if toppling a golden mountain or a jade pillar, and announced in a clear, strong voice, "Moongaze Li Zhouwei pays his respects to the Mistress."

The woman chuckled softly. "Minghuang, you've come."

The woman in the Thunder Pool was none other than Li Qinghong!

Hearing her reply, Li Zhouwei slowly released the tension in his heart. The woman descended from the pavilion and helped him up. Li Zhouwei's voice was slightly hoarse as he replied, "The Old Master... is still worried sick about you, Mistress. He assumed you must have met with disaster in the Grotto-Heaven. The longer it went, the more anxious he became. But it turns out you have mastered the thunder and secured dominion over a sea... When I report this to the Old Master, he will surely weep with joy."

Although he had guessed it was related to Li Qinghong before coming, Li Zhouwei hadn't dared to hope too much. Even seeing her with his own eyes, he still suspected she might be a remnant soul. But with that one sentence from her, only relief remained in his heart.

Li Qinghong listened, a trace of worry clouding her expression. She spoke softly, "Some things are not suitable to be written on paper, lest they invite calamity... Furthermore, it is difficult to extend my hand onto the mainland. Back then, when Dingjiao met the fox, he still had to go through you in the Eastern Sea; he could not send a letter directly."

"My situation is even more unique. It involves many matters of the Dragon Monarch swallowing thunder. It is not convenient to expose myself, nor is it appropriate for me to leave this sea."

Li Zhouwei bowed. "Knowing that you are safe, Mistress, is the only blessing we need! Only now do I know the Daoist Master managed to escape danger... It was all thanks to your intervention. I only fear we caused you inconvenience, which would be a grave error..."

Since Li Qinghong had stated these concerns, it likely meant her current position was extremely close to that of the Dragon-kin. Learning that Li Qinghong was unharmed *and* that she had rescued Li Ximing was already the best possible outcome. Li Zhouwei absolutely did not want to drag her down. His repeated use of "Mistress" was a clear signal to the Dragon-kin of his attitude.

But his heart was filled mostly with gratitude and joy. "Our family member had just reached the Purple Mansion Realm and understood nothing. The Daoist Master is not the type to manage affairs meticulously. He was plotted against and nearly perished in the Eastern Sea... We only have you to thank for his rescue..."

But Li Qinghong just shook her head slightly and smiled. "For Ximing to reach the Purple Mansion Realm... he is far more formidable than I. He did not disappoint... Whether it's me or the Old Master back home, we both owe him our thanks. We all advanced one step of blood, one step of tears... Because of him, those blood and tears were not shed in vain."

"If he hadn't held on through that mental threshold, we wouldn't even have room to maneuver today... Besides... you all have always underestimated him."

Li Qinghong gave a soft smile and invited him into the pavilion. Sitting down in the pavilion of the Profound Firmament Thunder Pool, her pale purple, almond-shaped eyes blinked slightly.

"The Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring—that is, the Thunder Cloud Temple Grotto-Heaven—many cultivators perished there. Thunder-Hearing Island from the Southern Sea, the Xi Family from the Northern Sea, the Daoist traditions of the Western Heaven Plateau... from Jiangnan and Jiangbei, from Zhao, Yan, Wu, and Yue... every single one of them is a lineage the Dragon-kin have disseminated over the past thousand years."

"My cultivation method originated from Ling Yanzi. Back then, the Dragon-kin also selected him to enter. It was originally promised to the Purple Smoke Gate, but he gave it to our family first. That karmic affinity thus fell upon me... This method landing in our family's hands involved Changxiao and Purple Smoke, and now, the prophecy is fulfilled through Changxiao and Purple Smoke."

The white-robed cultivator who had led him in brought forward a jade pot. Li Qinghong raised a slender hand, stopping her. Those eyes, once so full of heroic spirit, now held a trace of gentleness.

"It's impossible to explain it all clearly anymore. Looking back at everything... perhaps I was just born with the destiny to swallow thunder."

# Chapter 822: Preserving Truth Through Martial Might

Li Zhouwei pondered this deeply before replying, "The cultivation manual you acquired, my lady, spans a hundred years of history. It began in the sea and later moved to the lakes. Everything was meticulously arranged. Dragons cannot walk the land, and Mount Luoxia cannot control the seas. If some divine ability connects these events, who could possibly wield such immense power... Perhaps, my lady, you truly bear the weight of Fate."

Though Li Zhouwei seemed merely to be expressing his awe of Li Qinghong, his words landed differently on his two listeners.

'Who could possibly wield such immense power?'

Both held the answer in their hearts, yet they dared not speak it, dared not even truly think it. Since the suspicion had been planted, they could only cling to the explanation of Fate, refusing to broach the other possibility.

Li Qinghong immediately softened her voice. "This matter... must be traced back to the Conflict of North and South. In those years, the Grotto-Heavens of the True Qi path opened wide. Publicly, it was said the True Monarchs had traveled beyond the heavens, leaving the various Purple Mansion Realm masters to their own devices. In truth, the Golden Feather Sect took the lead, acting on a Celestial Decree from True Monarch Taiyuan, to probe the status of the True Qi path’s Fruition Attainment."

"When the Grotto-Heavens opened, three portions of the Martial True Qi Malignance Essence emerged. It was rumored that all three belonged to True Monarch Tianwu himself... and thus, everyone understood... True Monarch Tianwu was in peril."

Li Qinghong retrieved some tea leaves from a white porcelain jar nearby, shaking a measure into the pot. Her slender hand and the Jade vessel complemented each other perfectly.

Li Zhouwei asked skeptically, "They could confirm the status of a True Monarch based solely on three portions of Metallic Essence?"

Li Qinghong lowered her voice. "In the years Anhuai Heaven was established, True Monarch Tianwu’s authority shook the region, and all Demons and fiends retreated before him. He brought out three suits of armor and placed one in each of the three major territories of Anhuai Heaven. He left behind a single sentence, and then he departed beyond the heavens."

"That sentence was..." Her expression turned reverent. "‘When the armor lives, the Malignance stands. When the armor dies, the Martial Truth Qi hangs vacant. I invite later generations to ascend.’"

"In the decade that followed, those three suits of armor sequentially grew skin and flesh, becoming two men and one woman. Their faces, features, and voices were indistinguishable from living people, and all three attained great divine abilities. They guarded Anhuai Heaven until the day it was sealed and the Kingdom of Ning was destroyed. After that, they vanished without a trace."

"During the Conflict of North and South, the Purple Mansion Realm masters stormed into Anhuai Heaven, only to find it utterly deserted. The armor was gone. All that remained were those three portions of the 『Martial Truth Qi Malignance Essence』."

She shook her head. "This ended up fattening Jiangbei. One portion was obtained by Mount Changhuai in the Kingdom of Wu. Purple Smoke acquired another. The final portion, however, escaped and vanished due to the negligence of Daoist Master Chengyan. As a direct result of that failure, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Southern Sea perished."

"All three portions are critically important. The general cultivators... well, the Purple Mansion masters aside, *especially* the Golden Feather Sect, which gained nothing... they are intensely dissatisfied with him. Even Mount Changhuai and the Dragon-kin, who *did* obtain the True Qi, show him no courtesy whatsoever. Those with shorter tempers... like Hengli of Hengzhu, or Ping Yan of Yinzhou Island... they practically scream for his blood."

Li Zhouwei shook his head repeatedly. "No wonder it is said Daoist Master Chengyan cannot travel freely, nor dares he leave the known Seas. So this is the reason."

Li Qinghong continued, "That escaped Metallic Essence also became a Demon-fiend. That thing is ferocious. Because it was left behind by True Monarch Tianwu, it retains a sliver of the True Monarch's essential status. With the Fruition Attainment currently unoccupied, it is even more terrifying. Even Purple Mansion Realm masters must give it a wide berth... And worse, it was transformed from one of those three suits of armor, so its intelligence and cunning are certainly not inferior to any man. Right now, it’s hidden who-knows-where and absolutely refuses to emerge."

Li Zhouwei let out a long breath. "To think even a single suit of armor possesses such might. To achieve Fruition Attainment as True Monarch Tianwu did... leaving his armor to watch over the world while he sought higher truths... one could face death without regret."

Li Qinghong nodded slightly, clearly holding this True Monarch Tianwu in high regard. "He was a genius of the near-ancient era, and a magnanimous figure. It is said that when his own younger sister perished, her name appeared on the registry of the Underworld. Honored as a True Monarch, he easily could have used his divine abilities to detain her soul, yet he respected the order of the Underworld and refused to interfere for personal reasons. Later, he personally traveled to the Underworld to negotiate her return."

Li Zhouwei sorted through the information, but a doubt suddenly arose. "True Monarch Taiyuan holds an illustrious position in the current era and is highly active. Cultivators from the Golden Feather Sect can even enter the Grotto-Heavens to train. Since Golden Feather gained nothing, and that Metallic Essence has twisted into a Demon-fiend, why doesn't the True Monarch personally intervene and recapture it?"

Li Qinghong had clearly pondered this long ago. After all, True Monarchs still exist both within and beyond the seas. There was no reason they would allow something coveted even by Golden Core cultivators to roam free as a Demon-fiend.

"I already asked about that," she replied. "It concerns the Underworld. Once the Metallic Essence transformed into a Demon-fiend, the Underworld gained sole jurisdiction over its capture. If the Underworld does not dispatch agents to retrieve it, not even a True Monarch has the authority to interfere... This falls squarely within their jurisdiction. If True Monarch Taiyuan *were* to intervene, it would be an act of profound disrespect."

She frowned, her willow-leaf brows knitting as she searched for the words to describe the severity. She offered an analogy: "It would be like traveling to Mount Luoxia, standing at its base, and intercepting the forty-eight rays of twilight that fly across the firmament, stopping them from returning to the summit... and then stealing one or two of those rays for yourself."

"Ah..."

Li Zhouwei understood immediately. Both Mount Luoxia and the Underworld were entities in a league of their own. Mount Luoxia was more visible in the mortal world and thus inspired greater awe, but the Underworld, which held sway over all the fiends of the world, was no less tyrannical.

Just as Li Qinghong finished speaking, the water in the pot boiled, and the Jade lid rattled softly. She poured Li Zhouwei a cup, revealing a tea that was surprisingly pale purple. "This is a tea plant someone gifted me, Winter's Echo. I planted it here in the Lie Sea. This is the year's first harvest."

Li Zhouwei offered his thanks. He first inspected the cup. The veins of the tea leaves shimmered gold and silver, while the leaves themselves were snow-white. He took a delicate sip, only to feel an intense numbness spread from the tip of his tongue all the way down to his stomach. An instant later, a dense wave of spiritual energy surged upward, sweeping his fatigue away entirely.

The taste, however, was purely and solely *numb*. It was, frankly, not pleasant. Li Zhouwei swallowed and replied, "Excellent!"

Li Qinghong, however, was quite enthusiastic. "This is the very first thing I've ever grown myself. Although my sense of taste is vastly different from a mortal's now, I can hazard a guess at the flavor... It should be quite good."

"Mm, yes, absolutely."

When the tea was first poured, it was just ordinary spiritual tea water. But this Thunder Pool was an exceptionally mystical place. The ambient power of thunder in the world was drawn by the tea water and rapidly converged. Li Zhouwei felt a distinct tingling at his Baihui acupoint on the crown of his head. It felt as if lightning was about to descend from the heavens.

'I cannot hold this cup...'

Li Qinghong, naturally, was fine; no lightning in heaven or earth would strike her. Li Zhouwei, however, calmly but quickly set his teacup down. Seeing Li Qinghong purse her lips in a smile, he shook his head, slightly embarrassed.

Her pale purple, almond-shaped eyes blinked. Her crimson lips parted in a smile. "If it tastes bad, just say it tastes bad. You cannot tell a lie in this place. When the ancients swore oaths to the heavens, retribution always came as lightning. Lies are forbidden in the Thunder Pool. You are only safe because Fate shields you. If anyone else had sat here and said that, the lightning would have already struck."

"If you insist on praising it, I'll end up serving it to other guests, getting them all numb, and then they, too, will be forced to say how 'excellent' it is..."

Li Qinghong couldn't help but laugh. She refilled his cup. "If Xizhi were visiting, I’m sure he would also praise it. When the lightning struck... Xizhi could probably endure it. But poor Wushao’s tiny frame certainly can't take a bolt of thunder. Although I would be here to prevent him from being turned to ash, he would, at the very least, become a roasted snake."

Li Zhouwei nodded awkwardly. Seeing Li Qinghong adding still more tea to his cup, his tongue began to tingle preemptively. Unsure if he was expected to drink it, he quickly changed the subject. "Grand-Ancestor, have you heard any news of the Daoist Master?"

Li Qinghong finally set the Jade pot down. "That day he was pursued all the way here, giving me a justifiable reason to intervene. I intercepted Changxiao. Changxiao is extremely cunning. The instant he saw me, he feared offending the Dragons, and his attacks immediately became hesitant and restrained. If I had tried to circle around him, Ximing would have vanished."

"We did not fight for long. He possessed little true will to battle from the start. The longer we clashed, the more he sensed things were amiss, and he fled in a single breath. He is now hidden in some unknown corner observing the situation. He remains a significant threat."

Li Qinghong’s expression turned serious. "He already considers our family a mortal enemy. This is now a blood feud that ends only in death. While he may not dare to harm you directly, he will have zero scruples about harming Ximing..."

"As for Ximing... he was struck by a Mirrored-Mirage Dharma Art. I was quite worried at first, but who knew that only a few years later, he’d be alive and kicking again? He already sent a letter home, and he has even managed to connect with the Dantai Family!"

Li Zhouwei breathed a sigh of relief. He thought for a moment, then said, "I do have one matter that I must trouble you with, my lady."

He retrieved a Jade box from his sleeve and placed it on the table. "I successfully ambushed Situ Mo, and during that time, I also seized a Dharma tool from a disciple of Changxiao Gate. It follows the Water Mansion path and is of excellent quality. I have studied it and sought advice for some time, only to discover an imprint left by the Changxiao Gate deep inside it. The technique used is advanced, allowing any Changxiao disciple within a certain radius to detect it..."

"This specific Water Mansion Dharma tool is somewhat well-known, and I fear being discovered if I carry it. While I myself may be fine, I cannot pass it on to the younger disciples of the clan, and attempting to trade it significantly diminishes its value. I currently have my eye on another Dharma tool, but this issue has delayed the transaction."

He looked up, his hand hovering over his teacup before pulling back again. "If my lady happens to have a suitable Dharma tool here to exchange, it would be the most convenient solution."

Li Qinghong glanced at the box. "Let me take a look. It will save you the trouble of running around. Since you already have your eye on something else, neutralizing the danger from this item is the best course."

She smiled, her tone shifting. "Of course, this place was also established quite hastily. It’s not as if I have a stock of Dharma tools lying around to trade you."

Li Zhouwei nodded and opened the Jade box. Inside sat a small, glimmering azure gourd. It radiated a brilliant, precious light, yet it seemed suppressed by the ambient Profound Thunder in the sky, causing it to appear somewhat dim.

Li Qinghong extended her slender hand. Pulled by a primal magnetic force, the gourd immediately flew into her grasp. She scanned it for two beats.

*Boom!*

A bolt of Firmament Thunders descended from the sky, striking the gourd with a deafening crash. Purple lightning washed over the artifact, and a thick plume of pitch-black smoke erupted from within it, only to be instantly annihilated and dispersed by the dense lightning of the mystic realm.

The small azure gourd immediately looked brand new, even the original owner's imprint scrubbed clean. Li Qinghong nodded. "This item truly is rather mystical. It must be an antique. It appears they were originally attempting to refine it into an extremely high-grade Pristine Water Dharma tool. But somewhere mid-process—perhaps they ran out of materials, or perhaps some accident occurred—it was converted into a Water Mansion tool."

She paused briefly, then called softly, "Yuanzi!"

The same white-robed female attendant who had guided him inside entered the pavilion, kneeling firmly on the floor. She accepted the gourd from Li Qinghong with both hands.

Li Qinghong instructed, "Take this Dharma tool down to the Lustrous-Head clan on the seabed. Instruct them to alter the artifact. Ask if they can change its color and external appearance while increasing its power, or at least not diminishing it. Then, return to the Thunder Pool with their answer."

"Zhouwei... do you have any specific requirements?"

Yuanzi nodded respectfully, holding the Dharma tool as she stood aside. Only now did Li Zhouwei truly feel the authoritative atmosphere of a domain belonging to the Dragon-kin. He quickly replied, "Not many requirements! Just ensure the final item does not clash with Supreme Yin or Pit Water!"

Li Qinghong shook her head with a smile. "The Lie Sea was originally just an insignificant part of the outer ocean. It had no reputation; it was merely considered a vassal territory of Crimson Reef Island. Crimson Reef Island only ever sent their subordinates here to exploit the populace. The local Demon beasts and cultivators led bitter lives."

"After this Thunder Pool was established, they all submitted to my authority. With that parasitic middle layer of exploitation removed—and since I demand very little of them—they are all immensely grateful. Just send the Dharma tool over. I guarantee they will re-forge it to your complete satisfaction."

Li Zhouwei offered a genuine smile and nodded. "Oh, there’s no need to go to *that* much trouble. Ultimately, it’s destined to be traded away. If they spend too much effort on it, I won’t be able to bear parting with it."

Only then did Li Qinghong turn her head. "No need for extravagance. Just follow the young master's wishes."

"Yes!"

Yuanzi bowed and exited with the Dharma tool.

Li Zhouwei then returned to their topic. "Based on your earlier words, the Metallic Essence portions are currently held by Mount Changhuai and Daoist Master Zipei. But Daoist Master Zipei has already reincarnated..."

He hesitated at this point, showing his confusion.

Li Qinghong interrupted him. "Daoist Master Zipei of the Purple Smoke Gate acquired a portion of the True Qi, but she did not use it for her reincarnation. In the end, she gave it to the Dragon-kin. Purple Qi and True Qi are conceptually very close, yet she refused it... According to the Dragon-kin, there were two reasons. First, she was aiming to assail the Purple Qi Fruition Attainment and refused to leave herself any mental fallback, fearing it would compromise her ascent. Second, she *had* to give it up. Even if she had taken it into reincarnation, she would not have achieved her desire. Any ordinary Metallic Essence would be one thing, but *that* particular portion... it would have compelled a Dragon Monarch to intervene personally! It might even have unleashed boundless karmic slaughter."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding. Li Qinghong’s expression, however, grew uneasy. "However, according to the Dragon-kin, that exchange Zipei made seems to have been what perfected my Thunder Body. If not for her contribution, it is highly likely that nothing at all would have remained of me after swallowing the thunder. They... they hope that if I encounter cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate in the future, I will look after them..."

"If our family has the opportunity, we must try our best to foster good relations with that sect... At the very least, we must avoid any conflict. It doesn't just put me in an awkward position; I also fear that those with ill intentions might exploit the situation."

Her words took Li Zhouwei by surprise. His expression turned solemn. "I will immediately find an opportunity to relay this to the family... Was that portion of Metallic Essence truly so critical? Enough to compel a Dragon Monarch to intervene?"

Li Qinghong replied, "Today... the re-establishment of the True Qi Fruition Attainment is already a foregone conclusion, so that Metallic Essence is naturally vital. A few years ago, the Dragon King of the Admirable Sea came to visit, and he mentioned an even more critical point..."

Her expression grew complex. "The True Qi... the Dragons do not merely *hope* to get a piece of the pie. They *must* secure a piece of the pie. Even Dragon Monarch Xiyang’s intervention in the affairs of True Monarch Shangyuan was, in part, to ensure this True Qi could descend upon the world..."

Li Zhouwei hesitated, processing this, before asking, "Could it be... that the True Qi is essential for the Dragon-kin to advance further?"

Li Qinghong nodded, leaning forward slightly. Though her voice remained soft, her words landed with the weight of thunder:

"The Martial True Qi Malignance Essence. Its divinity is profound and clear within; its ferocious might overflows externally. Its righteous nature halts depravity; its benevolent authority is infinite. It does not dwell alone, nor does it live in isolation. It intertwines with the serpent as its companion; its heart is the perfect balance of Yin and Yang—It annihilates Demons and fiends, preserving Truth through Martial Might!"

"True Dragons... True Dragons..."

"How can they possibly lack 'Truth'?"

# Chapter 823: The Imperial Command

Li Zhouwei let out a heavy breath and replied, "I understand."

The Dragon-kin hadn't sent him to the Lie Sea merely for a family reunion. The words Li Qinghong spoke were likely the Dragon-kin's true intention. The importance of that True Qi was so high that the Beihai Sea Dragon King had reminded her repeatedly, ensuring Li Qinghong explained the situation to him personally.

"This Bright Yang is one scheme, and that True Qi is another. They are likely afraid my Li family will get entangled, causing the two plots to intersect and interfere with the Dragon-kin's plan to secure the True Qi."

Li Zhouwei understood the stakes clearly.

'The Bright Yang matter is hardly about old sentiments; it's mostly about preventing the Luoxia faction from acquiring it. But compared to the pursuit of the True Dragons, everything else must be pushed aside. Once this matter is involved, forget a Wei-Li descendant—even one of their own Dragon-kin would be killed without hesitation. This trip... this is a warning, delivered by the Beihai Sea and Admirable Sea factions within the Dragon-kin.'

Li Qinghong studied his expression as she sipped her tea. "You must not touch the True Qi. The family simply needs to wait quietly for your breakthrough."

She seemed to recall something, the words hesitating on her lips before she finally lowered her gaze.

"It truly is a pity... about Li Chenghui."

Li Zhouwei fell silent, unsure how to respond. A long moment passed before he spoke. "My uncle and I defended the river for sixteen years, vigilant day and night, often feeling we were nearing the end of our path. I had it slightly easier. Uncle slept on his spear, waiting for the dawn. I fear that the moment the anomaly at Mount Wu first appeared, his death was already imminent."

"To have survived all those days... only to fall here."

Among the Chengming generation, Li Chenghui and Li Qinghong had been the closest. They had trained together at the Ancestral Spring, and because of their shared Dao Heritage, Li Chenghui often sought her guidance. His sudden death must surely be the most painful for her.

Li Qinghong remained quiet for a time before saying, "Back then, I always thought he was the most promising of the Chengming generation, and the most cautious. I believed he could carry the weight of the Great Liang. He truly did not disappoint."

The atmosphere immediately grew heavy. Li Zhouwei, wishing to change the subject, clasped his hands.

"Senior, when this junior was passing through Crimson Reef Island, I witnessed quite a commotion. Two groups of cultivators were fighting fiercely. There were people from Thunder-Hearing Island and Crimson Reef Island present. I had heard that Crimson Reef Island is usually deserted... What is...?"

Li Qinghong pondered this briefly. "It must be related to the Crimson Reef Dragon King. He emerged from seclusion, becoming another late-stage Purple Mansion Realm Dragon King. Perhaps he intends to construct his Dragon Palace soon and will host a celebratory banquet... They came for that?"

Li Zhouwei was still perplexed but nodded. "But I only saw people from those two families... Perhaps their information network is just faster..."

Li Qinghong thought carefully, then mused, "Your words remind me of something. The Crimson Reef Dragon King is of the Black Dragon Ancestral Line. Thunder-Hearing Island once assisted the Black Dragon Ancestral Line... If the Crimson Reef Dragon King is celebrating, it's reasonable for Thunder-Hearing Island to arrive in force. As for Crimson Reef Island... that is harder to say."

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouwei. He spoke in a solemn tone, "In that case, my family is allied with the White Dragon Ancestral Line. It is probably best we avoid contact with this Crimson Reef Island, lest we be given trouble. They are Dragon-kin, after all. If they truly decided to make an issue of it, my family could not withstand the pressure."

Li Qinghong inclined her head. "While that reasoning is sound, the Dragon-kin have a singular objective and are unshakeably united on this front. They won't make things too difficult for you right now. Just stay away from Crimson Reef Island. Don't make things awkward for them."

---

Li Zhouwei acknowledged her words just as the white-robed female attendant hurried back into the pavilion, bowing respectfully.

"Mistress of the Pool, the Deepwater Attendants examining the Dharma artifact have replied. This artifact can harmonize the Water Mansion. By tempering it with the Spiritwater of the Harmonious Abyss, the Pristine Water within can be transformed and consolidated. By adding another layer of Harmonizing Metal to balance the mansion, it can be refined into a Blue-Gold Gourd. It will be an inch larger than its current form, and the method of wielding it will change from grasping to holding, or wearing at the waist. It will gain two new wondrous abilities, including summoning water to suppress enemies..."

These underwater Demon beasts provided an exhaustive description. Li Qinghong listened distractedly. When the attendant finished, she glanced at Li Zhouwei.

"Minghuang. What is your assessment?"

Li Zhouwei made a quick estimation. The original green gourd had been inferior to the Deng Clan's fan. This upgrade had both gains and losses but was certainly a significant improvement. Although it still couldn't compare to the fan, he replied, "It is already excellent."

Li Qinghong nodded and turned to the attendant, whose name was Yuanzi. "How long will it take?"

Yuanzi bowed. "At least six months. We estimate between half a year and nine months."

The woman's gaze turned back to him. Li Zhouwei had no other pressing plans; cultivation was cultivation, regardless of the location. Besides, he had many secret arts he needed to practice. He nodded. "That poses no problem. I was just looking for a place to enter seclusion. Is it convenient here in the Lie Sea?"

Li Qinghong considered this. "The thunder within the pool is far too potent and tyrannical; it is naturally unsuitable for Minghuang's cultivation. There aren't many cultivation spots in the Lie Sea below. At best, there is Sea Otter Mountain, but the Spiritual Essence there is inferior even to the mainland. I am afraid Zhouwei will be inconvenienced."

The outer seas were barren, far worse than the Eastern Sea, let alone Jiangnan. Li Zhouwei naturally understood this. After they exchanged a few more pleasantries, Li Qinghong concluded, "I will have Yuanzi escort you down."

Li Zhouwei bowed, letting out a long sigh of relief. "Now that I have met with you, Senior, I can finally send word back to the family."

Li Qinghong smiled and returned the gesture. He followed the white-robed female attendant out, heading back toward the sea. The chariot they had arrived in was waiting by the pool's edge, the surroundings still utterly empty. Yuanzi respectfully invited him to board without any unnecessary words.

Li Qinghong's palace had few attendants, and they all seemed to share her temperament: concise and elegantly efficient. The chariot plunged toward the sea. Sea Otter Mountain came into view, revealing itself to be extremely simple. Although there were temples and abbeys on the mountain, the buildings were orderly and built low to the ground, with modest front and back courtyards. A few Daoists were burning incense, deep in quiet prayer as they cultivated thunder arts.

But as the chariot broke through the cloud layer, the tranquility below instantly shattered. A visible panic spread through the inhabitants. A group of Daoists quickly gathered below the Ritual Altar on the mountain peak. Looking down, Li Zhouwei saw a swaying sea of black Daoist kerchiefs.

*RUMBLE!*

The chariot landed atop the Ritual Altar with a deafening, thunder-like roar, sending ripples of silver light pulsing outward. A man at the head of the group below shouted:

"The Firmament Cloud Abbey, representing the fourteen Dao Heritages of the Second Celestial Thunder, respectfully welcomes the High Celestial Thunder Emissary! We receive the thunder command and uphold the Immortal Decree!"

The assembled Daoists bowed as one. From the sides, the sounds of ritual flutes and zithers rose. From the front of the chariot, Yuanzi's clear voice announced:

"We carry no formal edict, only an advisory directive."

"The White Qilin of the Path of the Bright Yang is visiting the Thunder Pool and will be resting on Sea Otter Mountain. I am under orders to accompany His Excellency in selecting a cultivation site. There is no need for this mobilization, but you absolutely must not show any neglect."

"This lowly cultivator obeys."

Li Zhouwei felt the chariot tremble slightly as Yuanzi pulled back the curtain for him, bowing respectfully. "Your Excellency, please!"

He stepped out onto the Ritual Altar. It was forged from silvery-white metal. The Daoists below remained with their heads bowed low. Only the leader, an old Daoist, stepped forward, stopping one step below the platform to bow deeply. "We pay respects to the Aspect of the Bright Yang. For Your Excellency to choose this small mountain to tread upon blesses our Dao lineage. This lowly cultivator is overwhelmed by this honor, extremely grateful."

Yuanzi, terrified the locals would offend their guest, stuck close to him, whispering an explanation: "Your Excellency, when the Eastern Sea's waters receded and the thunder rose, the Thunder Pool descended upon the world. The Firmament Cloud Abbey sensed their Dao Heritage and followed it here all the way from the Northern Sea. Their heritage originates from ancient cultivators. If their speech causes offense, please..."

She was attempting to smooth things over, but inwardly she trembled. 'That old man Lu must have a death wish! This is the White Qilin. Although he is polite while visiting the Thunder Pool, the Bright Yang Aspect prizes hierarchy above all else. He didn't even kowtow, and he's spouting nonsense about blessing the Dao lineage...'

Li Zhouwei, however, found this very interesting. He swept his gaze over the crowd, noticing that most of the Firmament Cloud Abbey's adherents were mortals. There were only a sparse few at the Embyronic Breathing stage, and the old Daoist before him was merely at Qi Refining. What a thoroughly miserable state!

"Please rise."

He responded, raising an eyebrow. "Is this ancient etiquette... or the rules of thunder cultivation?"

Sweat immediately beaded on the old Daoist's forehead. "Your Excellency, only one rule has been passed down through our heritage. We do not know if it is etiquette or thunder law. This small mountain is crude and cannot fulfill the requirements of the rites. It is this lowly cultivator's sin."

Li Zhouwei gave the man a thoughtful look. It seemed these ancient cultivation rules were rather different than he had imagined. He activated his brilliant Profound Light and descended from the Ritual Altar.

Although Li Zhouwei was not a true White Qilin, his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation, amplified by his destiny, made him appear as nothing less than divine to this crowd of mortals. They stared in mingled awe and envy.

Yuanzi accompanied him into the abbey, quietly adding details. "Although these cultivators are weak, their Dao Heritage has deep roots connecting them to the Profound Firmament Thunder Pool and the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring. There is also a Xi Clan in the Northern Sea that sent a disciple here to cultivate. He is currently in seclusion, attempting to break through to Qi Refining."

"I have heard of them."

Li Zhouwei knew of that Xi Clan member, Xi Zikang. He had been an upright man. Unfortunately, he had almost certainly perished within that Grotto-Heaven along with the others. Li Zhouwei could only sigh internally.

'The Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring... just from that name alone, it is clearly something the Dragon-kin are determined to possess. To guide thunder and anchor clouds—that should inherently be the role of a dragon.'

---

They soon arrived at the deepest cultivation abode within the Firmament Cloud Abbey. It was exactly as Li Qinghong had said: not only was the spiritual energy inferior to the lake above, but the space itself was incredibly cramped.

If an abode had been opened by a cultivator from the inner seas, it would at least be the size of a courtyard. This one, however, was barely the size of a single room. It contained only one table, one chair, and one meditation cushion. Yet the old Daoist clearly cherished the place; the entrance was neatly lined with soft mats.

The old Daoist bowed low beside the entrance as Yuanzi activated the formation array for him. "Your Excellency... please. When there is news regarding the Dharma artifact, I will come up the mountain to retrieve you."

Li Zhouwei nodded and stepped inside. The great door sealed shut automatically, and the Dharma Lamps within the abode lit up, brightly illuminating the confined space. He sat in place for a short while, organizing all the recent information until his mind gradually cleared.

He settled onto the meditation cushion. Nine secret arts—each one vast as the sea, yet concise and profoundly potent—surged forth from his spiritual sense. These were the nine secret arts of the Radiant Essence Scripture!

These arts were exceptionally precious. Li Zhouwei had no need to carry transcribed copies to study; the knowledge had been directly bestowed upon him when he received the Talisman Seed. Preparing to begin his cultivation, he followed the experiential records left behind by Li Ximing and first isolated the art known as **Primal Yang** to read.

"The origin of Bright Yang, the aspect of the Yang axis manifests. Every step adheres to the rules; every glance matches the rite. To sing is to harmonize the pitch pipes; to move is to regulate the hierarchy of status; to tread is to not step upon the land of a state without a Monarch; to stop is to not roost in the domains of feudal lords..."

Li Zhouwei read it through once, nodding slightly. 'Reasonably easy to understand...'

He suddenly remembered something. Rummaging through his storage pouch, he retrieved a jade slip. This was something Li Ximing had given him. It appeared to be annotations for this secret art—it contained only the commentary, not the original text.

Li Zhouwei read the preface first and saw the signature:

【Daoist Master Gufeng】

'Oh. A fitting pen name for a Daoist Master. He must have drawn inspiration from the Talisman Qi.'

He proceeded to read the lengthy hundred-thousand-word text, but his brows furrowed, and he shook his head in thought.

'This thing is verb... cough... it doesn't suit me. This must have been prepared for the younger generations of the family. It's not of much use to me.'

'However, this scroll speculates that the cultivation difficulty is not the same for everyone. Although the nine secret arts ascend sequentially, based on an individual's specific temperament and talent, the difficulty of mastering each of the arts varies...'

He put the slip away. Instead of immediately beginning Primal Yang, he read through the other eight arts and briefly tested each one.

Within his Sea of Qi, flickers of golden light appeared, sometimes white, sometimes gold. One moment they formed a lamp, the next they formed steps, then transformed again into a vast palace complex or a million elite soldiers, flashing unstably. Time flowed past like water.

More than half a month later, Li Zhouwei slowly opened his eyes, exhaling a plume of white mist. Although the abode's lamps were bright, his eyes were far more dazzling, faintly flowing with a golden Profound Light.

His expression, however, was far from calm. Doubt surged in his heart, mixed with profound astonishment.

'These nine secret arts... I've already cultivated a significant portion of them!'

He had tested them all, using the secret arts to stimulate his Immortal Foundation and observe the changes. Edict Glyphs materialized upon the foundation, faint but distinct, as golden lines and white light flowed across its surface. This was unmistakably the sign of having mastered the **Imperial Command**—one of the nine arts!

And this Imperial Command was supposed to be, by far, the most difficult of the nine!

'It certainly wasn't the cultivation method's influence... Daoist Master Gufeng practiced for so many years before his breakthrough, and he always had to start from scratch. Then... it must be the influence of my destiny.'

Yet, after testing all nine arts, he found it was far more than just that. The nine arts were: Primal Yang, Heavenly Lamp, Jewel Steps, Great Fissure, the Art of Returning Fold, Myriad Arms Prefecture, Imperial Command, Golden Qilin, and Red Cicada.

Of these, Imperial Command was already at Grand Completion. Great Fissure was 50% mastered, and Myriad Arms Prefecture was 30% mastered!

Li Zhouwei was simultaneously shocked and overjoyed, but this was immediately followed by deep confusion. "Why these three?"

Although his current cultivation level wasn't high, destiny clung to him, and his discussions with the Dragon-kin had yielded an immense amount of valuable information. He already had a theory.

"The Yang Axis bears two children: one is the White Qilin, the second is the White Cicada. But at the time of my birth, the White Qilin delivered the child, and the White Cicada vibrated its wings. Both phenomena appeared simultaneously. This likely means I exist somewhere between the Qilin and the Cicada. As for how much relation this truly has to the Yang Axis itself, that requires a separate discussion..."

The Yang Axis was, after all, the primary aspect of the Bright Yang. Li Zhouwei didn't dare compare himself to it lightly. Furthermore, who knew how much influence the successive generations of the Wei-Li had exerted upon the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment over the ages? The Dragon-kin believed he was the White Qilin, and that assumption probably wasn't far from the truth.

"Regardless of my connection to the Yang Axis, mastering Imperial Command... likely corresponds directly to this destiny."

Mastering Imperial Command was understandable. But having 50% mastery of the Great Fissure and 30% of the Myriad Arms Prefecture was utterly baffling. If he had shown a slight mastery across all the techniques, that would be one thing. But arts like Primal Yang showed absolutely zero trace of cultivation.

"How strange... When did I ever cultivate these two arts? Or perhaps... was I simply born with them?"

**Li Qinghong:** Purple Mansion Realm Spirit Cultivator Thunder of the Dragon-kin



# Chapter 824: Harmonising Metal

The secret method Imperial Command served to increase one's personal might and compel others. While its utility was limited, commanding mortals or low-level cultivators posed no issue. As for the remaining two secret methods, he had made progress, but they were far from mastered and offered no tangible benefits.

Then again, secret methods were never intended to be Dao arts that enhanced one's combat prowess. He estimated that even mastering all nine would offer less aid in a real Dao battle than his Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts.

Li Zhouwei mused on this, suppressed the nagging doubts in his mind, and resolved to ask Li Qinghong about it later. For now, he immersed himself back into secluded cultivation.

Cultivating the Primal Yang was not difficult, and time slipped by in an instant. A faint vibration echoed from outside the immortal's abode, and he slowly opened his eyes. Yuanzi's respectful voice carried in:

"My Lord, the Lustrous-Head Clan has reported personally. The spiritual artifact is successfully refined, and they humbly request you come to inspect it."

The doors to the manor-cave boomed open. Li Zhouwei dissolved into a streak of light, reappearing at her side. Yuanzi bowed and began to lead the way. The old Daoist followed just as respectfully as before, though this time he was accompanied by a young man in a silver crown and feathered robes. He appeared to be a cultivator from the Xi Family of the Northern Sea, and he dared not speak, keeping his gaze lowered as he trailed behind.

Li Zhouwei deliberately slowed his pace, yet the young man remained silent. It wasn't until Li Zhouwei had stepped onto the ritual platform that the youth seized his opportunity:

"Xi Nanqing of the Firmament Cloud Abbey, greets you, my Lord."

Li Zhouwei acknowledged him with a simple sound. In the brief moment he turned to enter the carriage, he shot the youth a glance, lifting the curtain just slightly.

"The Xi Family of the Northern Sea. Your clan has cultivated lightning for generations, and you walk the Righteous Path. We should indeed interact more often."

Xi Nanqing offered a brief reply and fell silent, having nothing more to add. The carriage swayed as it rode the thunder upward, ascending through heavy layers of mist. Li Zhouwei glanced down. The Daoists on the mountain were dispersing in an orderly fashion. The old Daoist, meanwhile, was removing the cushions and table mats from the abode and distributing them among several nearby middle-aged cultivators, who were likely all advanced in years and without heirs.

He withdrew his gaze. Above, the purple-and-white brilliance of the Thunder Pool emerged from the cloud layers. Heavy black mist churned within it, seeming to brew infinite reserves of lightning, radiating an aura that was both dangerous and oppressive.

Following the familiar path, he stepped across the liquid lightning and ascended the silvery-white pavilion. Li Qinghong sat in the same spot as before, though this time her long hair cascaded freely over her shoulders. A blue-gold gourd now rested on the table. The woman’s pale lavender eyes locked onto him as she smiled.

"Minghuang, take a look at this spiritual artifact."

Li Zhouwei took his seat and lightly weighed the gourd. It felt significantly heavier.

Li Qinghong continued, "It is much as we predicted. The spiritual artifact has successfully transformed its nature to one of convergence, reinforced with Pond Sector Xin Metal of the Harmonising Metal. It is heavier by fourteen catties and seven taels. It has gained the ability to use Converging Water to erode an enemy's spiritual qi; it's far more potent than before. The Lustrous-Head Clan were here to construct formations, but their artifact refinement techniques and Dao attainment are truly first-class. This wasn't some casual patch job. Even the gourd's original owner wouldn't recognize it standing before him."

"Converging Water is the final destination toward which all rivers flow. By adding the Pond Sector Xin Metal—Harmonising Metal is, by nature, a metal of preservation and collection—the gourd can now contain spirit water. It will nurture the liquid within, slowing the dissipation of its spiritual essence. You can even store talisman water crafted from an immortal foundation inside it."

"Thank you, my Lady!"

Li Zhouwei nodded repeatedly as he listened. He accepted the gourd, stored it safely in his sleeve, and after offering several more thanks, he remarked:

"Harmonising Metal is certainly peculiar. I have rarely seen it within the Seas. If it is truly a metal of preservation, I suspect the few spiritual artifacts our family possesses capable of storing spiritual objects must have been refined using this substance."

Li Qinghong smiled faintly. "Although I do not cultivate the Metal Virtue, I have been reading some hidden scriptures lately. Your guess is almost certainly correct. Harmonising Metal is exceedingly rare these days, which is precisely why ancient spiritual artifacts could often preserve spiritual objects, whereas most modern ones cannot."

"Speaking of this... the matter of the 'Three Metals' has troubled my family for a long time. Even though the Water Virtue is incomplete, it is still referred to as the 'Five Waters.' Why, then, is Metal Virtue only the 'Three Metals'? Brother Wushao and I studied this privately several times but found nothing. I eventually asked..."

"It turns out both of those missing paths to Fruition Attainment are already occupied. Furthermore, their holders are both located Beyond the Heavens, and their current status is... difficult to articulate. The implication from the Dragon-kin is that these two paths are not only difficult to cultivate, they are currently impossible to *achieve*. This has led to the awkward, incomplete state we have today."

"Although spiritual objects aligned with these two paths occasionally appear in the mainland and the Seas, cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm are pitifully rare. As for Purple Mansion Realm-grade spiritual objects, they no longer manifest in the world; they can only be passed down as ancient legacies or extracted from ancient spiritual artifacts. In the last thousand years, I have heard of fewer than ten cultivators who attempted these paths. All were Heaven's Chosen prodigies, but they strayed onto these two divergent roads, only to languish and die during the early Purple Mansion Realm. Today, only one such person remains."

Doubt stirred in Li Zhouwei's heart. "I have heard that methods exist to convert between different daos, such as 'Refining Pristine Water into Converging Water' or the 'Art of Borrowing Geng for Dui.' Can these two missing Metal Virtues be obtained through similar means?"

Li Qinghong shook her head. "That, I do not know."

Li Zhouwei grew contemplative, his mind suddenly turning to the Jiang Family incident.

'No wonder... No wonder that Daoist Master from the Wang Family went so far as to destroy an ancient spiritual artifact just to extract the Six Xin Harmonising Metal. The empty husk is supposedly still in their vaults. So this is why: Harmonising Metal is no longer being naturally produced... The Wang Family commands the Wandering Metal in this age; if a conversion method existed, what element could they *not* create? Why would they need to travel thousands of miles just to destroy an ancient spiritual artifact? Since even the Wang Family resorted to that, it must truly be impossible to convert.'

Understanding dawned on him, and he felt he had gained significant insight. He nodded. "No wonder it is said that when the 'Three Metals' manifest, the Metal Virtue is considered proven. If this is the case, then it truly is all 'complete'—all that can exist, already does."

After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Li Zhouwei spoke again. "There is one other matter I must ask you, my Lady. What do you know regarding secret methods? Are there any known cases of a cultivator reaching the late Foundation Establishment Realm who has also achieved significant attainment in these secret arts?"

Li Zhouwei knew that asking Li Qinghong was tantamount to asking the Dragon-kin directly. Fortunately, the Dragon-kin were aware that he carried the burden of Fate, giving him the courage to ask. To his surprise, however, Li Qinghong merely paused, shook her head, and replied:

"I have never even cultivated an secret method, so naturally, I know nothing of such matters."

Li Zhouwei could only let the matter drop. They chatted for a short while longer within the Thunder Pool before he finally rose to take his leave.

"I am greatly indebted to you for this, my Lady. On my return, I will detour by Crimson Reef Island and stop at Tai'e Island to exchange for some magical implements. Afterward, I will follow the coast down toward the Vermillion Sea to trade for supplies before returning to the Zongquan Island region to enter secluded cultivation."

Li Qinghong nodded and walked him out of the pavilion. Softly, she said:

"The Old Master is advanced in years. Please, ask him to take good care of his health. I am confined to this pool and cannot leave, but I miss him terribly... I have now cultivated the Thunder Body. If a storm ever brews over Moongaze Lake and lightning flashes upon its surface, tell him to consider it me, visiting my great-uncle."

"This junior will certainly relay the message."

They walked all the way to the edge of the Lightning Pool. Her vermillion lips parted slightly, and she hesitated for a long moment. She seemed to have a warning or advice to impart, but, perhaps considering her station, she ultimately swallowed her words.

Li Zhouwei saw the hesitation. He offered a deep, prolonged bow, making no promises or oaths. He simply mounted his escaping light and departed toward the west.

---

Moongaze Lake.

Dawn rose as always. A young man in crimson robes stood at the highest point of the pavilion, gazing out over the entire lake prefecture. Behind him, a young man in black robes stood bowed, looking only a few years his senior. He wore a sword at his waist and held an extremely respectful posture.

The crimson-robed youth slowly withdrew his gaze, letting it fall upon the small letter in his hand. His brow furrowed, a trace of cold disdain touching his features as he spoke in a low voice:

"Kong Guli is dead..."

The young man behind him remained calm. He bowed and replied:

"This subordinate also received the news. The Sacred Writ Gate is handling the funeral with great fanfare. I fear we will be required to send representatives."

It had only been a few years since the Kong Family submitted to the Sacred Writ Gate when the turmoil in the Eastern Sea began. As one of the two surviving elders of the Kong Family, Kong Guli had been entrusted with heavy responsibilities there. He had been dispatched by the Sacred Writ Gate to reinforce Purple Smoke, only to be ambushed halfway by the Chunyi Dao Gate, dying on the road.

When the news returned, Kong Guxi wailed in grief. But before he had wept more than a few moments, Daoist Master Zhu Gong personally traveled to the Chunyi Dao Gate to confront Daoist Master Guanghou. The dispute lasted for several days. Upon her return, she immediately promoted Kong Xiaxiang to the powerful position of Protector and bestowed several marriage contracts with the direct bloodline, all by way of compensation.

Kong Guli’s funeral, meanwhile, was held with extravagant splendor and the highest possible honors. The elder’s children and grandchildren were nearly all gone. They found the youngest remaining boy in the Kong bloodline, whom Daoist Master Zhu Gong personally accepted as a disciple, and invited all the major families to attend the condolences and witness the ceremony.

This grand spectacle lasted for several days, and Li Jiangqian monitored it closely. He refolded the letter in his hand, shaking his head.

"Chen Yang, our delegation for the condolences must be impressive. The Sacred Writ Gate is trying to strengthen its bond with the Kong Family, binding them to the point where they are inseparable. My Li Family must, therefore, be extra cautious to avoid any suspicion. This requires you to lead the trip personally."

He instructed, "Also, be mindful... do not engage in idle chatter with the Kong Family members. Kong Guxi will not seek you out. And since our family has reached the Purple Mansion Realm level, they won't dare cause an ugly scene or sever relations. At worst, you will simply have to endure their cold expressions."

"This subordinate understands!"

Visiting the Sacred Writ Gate was certainly not a pleasant assignment. Li Jiangqian was privately wary that the Xuanmu Dao Lineage was attempting to drive a wedge between the Li and Kong families, forcing the Kongs to cling desperately to the Sacred Writ Gate's thigh. If someone hot-tempered like Ding Weizeng were sent, they would inevitably clash. Cui Jueyin's status, meanwhile, was too sensitive. Chen Yang, however, had always been thorough and perceptive. Entrusting this to him was the most appropriate choice.

Chen Yang accepted the command and withdrew. Li Jiangqian remained standing on the high platform. After a moment, he saw Cui Jueyin ascend from below. Cui Jueyin bowed, offering forth a jade slip with both hands.

"Reporting to the Patriarch: the Milin Dao Garden established some time ago has been attended by numerous mortal members of the clan. We tested them individually these past few days, and we now have the results."

"Even when mortals study the Dao classics, there are clear differences in their aptitude. Some, despite being unable to cultivate, demonstrate a strong comprehension of Dao methods. Others, through sheer diligence, can barely grasp a concept or two. And some have clearly received guidance from cultivators in their families and show minor achievements..."

Li Jiangqian frowned. "If they already have cultivators guiding them, what need is there to attend the Milin Dao Garden?"

Cui Jueyin looked slightly embarrassed. "The family established the Dao Garden intending it for the clan’s poorer disciples. But after several months, the majority of the clan members have enrolled... Firstly, the cultivators in their immediate families rarely have the spare time to instruct them. Secondly... they don't have much to teach."

Li Jiangqian paused, stunned, then shook his head. "It seems I overestimated them."

When it truly came down to Dao methods, the average rogue cultivator only knew one or two basic spells. Likewise, the family's Guest Elders, unless they specialized in talisman drawing, spirit plants, alchemy, or artifact refinement, possessed no meaningful Dao attainment even at the Qi Refining stage. Only upon reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm and forging one's immortal foundation does a cultivator begin to gain true insight into the world.

Although the Li Family was an Immortal Clan with abundant Daoist scriptures, even members of the direct bloodline only began gaining slight Dao attainment during Qi Refining. Of the clan's few Qi Refining cultivators, only the brothers Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang had any spare time. But no matter how much they cared for the junior clan members, they could not halt their own cultivation to instruct mortals.

Thus, the fact that the Milin Dao Garden was overflowing with students was simultaneously unexpected and perfectly logical. Li Jiangqian smiled and shook his head.

"This is an unexpected boon. The growing rift between the various courtyards might be mitigated by this... Separate the children into groups. Make sure to pair those from different branches who are unfamiliar with one another, and split up those from the same courtyard. Force them to get acquainted..."

Ever one to seize an opportunity, he implemented the slight change. Cui Jueyin carefully noted the instruction and continued:

"There are indeed a few individuals who show a profound understanding of Dao methods, often making astonishing insights. But since they cannot cultivate, their talent is ultimately useless."

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow, thinking to himself. 'The Talisman Seed functions as a spiritual aperture... Perhaps these children could seek it out... Unfortunately, by the time they demonstrate such academic talent, it is far too late. They are well past the age of six, and it has already been confirmed they cannot cultivate... It is of little use. Forget it. If any of them possessed truly transcendent talent, like Quewan, the Talisman Seed would have responded on its own...'

He waved Cui Jueyin away. Suddenly, he sensed strands of Clear Qi rising toward the zenith. Wisps of energy brushed aside the cloud layer, revealing the Azure Sky. The energy was light and gentle; it flashed for only a brief instant before rapidly wilting away.

Li Jiangqian pondered this, watching the phenomenon intently. "This is a celestial phenomenon I have never witnessed before."

Before long, a messenger arrived, bowing deeply before him.

"Reporting, my Lord. Old Master Tian Zhongqing of the Tian Clan has failed his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm. His body has perished, and his Dao has dissipated."

Understanding dawned on Li Jiangqian. He shook his head. "So, that was the sign of 'Clear Qi' failing a breakthrough... He was the only person in the entire lake region attempting to reach Foundation Establishment by cultivating Clear Qi. In those early years, the lake was impoverished, and he practiced the Clear Qi Dao Lineage. He simply grew too old. Although he changed his cultivation method since then, it was ultimately too late."

He seemed genuinely remorseful for a moment. "He managed to hold on for so long. While the Inward Heart Surging Profundity benefits the Immortal Dao and secluded cultivation, and it clarifies the Twelve Qi, all of which helped him immensely, it still wasn't quite enough... If he had practiced a third or fourth-grade cultivation method from the start, and had more resources, he might have attempted this breakthrough ten or twenty years younger. Back then, he would have had a chance."

"In the early days, our family lacked geniuses, but several of the stewards from external families were excellent. What a pity..."

The man from the Jade Court Guard bowed and retreated quickly. Li Jiangqian pondered this on the platform for a moment before someone from Qingdu arrived right behind him, reporting the news:

"Old Master Tian left final words. His immortal remains are to be buried by the Meichi River in Lijing Prefecture. It is said that Elder Chen shed tears upon hearing the news. Lord Li Wen and Old Master An have already set out."

Tian Zhongqing's great-aunt had been Lord Xiangping's wife; the old man himself called Li Xuanfeng 'Cousin-Uncle.' His status was prominent, and he had been an instrumental figure in the clan's rise. Li Jiangqian sighed heavily.

"Send some compensation to the Tian family. I recall the old master lost all heirs in his son's generation. The one currently managing the Tian family is named... Tian Ling. He is at the Qi Refining level. Although only a nephew, he served Tian Zhongqing as a son would serve a father. Bestow the gifts upon him."

He waved the messenger away, stepped down from the high platform, and added:

"I will go personally."

### Chapter 825: The Immortal Decree

As Li Jiangqian headed toward the riverbank, he glanced up at the sky. The ethereal essence released by Tian Zhongqing’s fall had already vanished without a trace. The sun blazed fiercely, casting a light so bright over the lake it was almost suffocating.

"The summers get drier every year."

He descended on stepping flames. Below, in the Lijings Prefectural Town, doorways were already draped in white mourning gauze. The various branches of the Tian clan had once been prominent families in Lijing. Though their power had waned after moving to Eastern Yue, and they were caught in the crossfire of the conflict between north and south, their path had been difficult. Fortunately, Tian Zhongqing had returned safely back then. Even if the younger generation was lacking, the family still retained a measure of prestige and relied on old favors. Li Jiangqian had been delayed, and by the time he arrived, the riverbank was already crowded.

Although Chen Yang had departed, the Chen family—a great clan equal to the Ans—had no shortage of influential figures to manage the situation. Moreover, Chen Donghe himself had personally come this time. Li Jiangqian scanned the crowd. Aside from Li Chenghuai and a few others currently in seclusion, nearly half of the lake region’s true powerholders were present.

He wasn't surprised. It was no secret that the esteemed clans of the lake region were a tangled web of alliances. The Li clan itself had integrated with external families through generations of intermarriage. The fact that Ding Weizeng, Qu Bushi, and Miaoshui—several of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators belonging to the Jiangbei faction—had *not* attended, actually earned his silent approval.

The old master of the Tian family, Tian Ling, waited by the riverbank dressed entirely in white. He was something of a special case. His father, Tian Rong, had been assassinated by a servant girl, leaving Tian Ling to grow up alone in Qingdu. He had held posts first in the Jade Court and later in the Lake region, but his low cultivation meant he was never considered an important figure. Currently stationed on the eastern shore, he had rushed back for the funeral. He stepped forward to receive Li Jiangqian, bowing meticulously.

"Greetings, Clan Head."

Li Jiangqian offered a few words of comfort as he landed. He scanned the dense, overlapping reed marshes, spoke the necessary pleasantries, and made his appearance brief. It was enough to fulfill his obligations.

Stepping away from the formal proceedings, he sought out Li Xuanxuan. The old man looked deeply worried. The moment he saw Li Jiangqian, he spoke.

"Qian'er, are you returning to the main island? Take me with you; I need to retrieve an item or two."

Li Jiangqian was indeed managing countless affairs and still had his own cultivation to attend to; he had little time to waste here. He nodded, supported the old man's arm, and ignited his flames, flying back out over the lake. As they traveled, he asked:

"Elder, what are you fetching that requires you to go personally?"

Li Xuanxuan sighed. "The Tian family’s younger generation is truly in decline. We must help where we can... This old man has some spiritual items stored away. I’ll go fetch them... If I spot any promising youths, I'll pass some along."

Li Jiangqian nodded thoughtfully. "You can entrust that task to me."

Before Li Xuanxuan could reply, Li Jiangqian activated his ocular technique. A brief glance aside made him pause. "Hm?"

Standing amidst the clouds near the lake was a man and a woman. The woman’s features were unremarkable, but she carried herself with an excellent bearing, a faint smile on her face. In her arms, she cradled a treasured sword that radiated an aura as piercing and cold as Ice.

Beside her stood an exceptionally handsome young man, appearing to be in his late twenties. He wore a deep green robe secured by a Jade belt, and dark boots. A short talisman-sword hung at his hip.

Li Jiangqian smiled and flew over, bowing first to the woman. "Greetings, Aunt Xinghan."

Li Xinghan returned the greeting and then hurried to pay respects to Li Xuanxuan. The young man, surprised, quickly followed suit. After the flurry of salutations, Li Jiangqian turned to the man, feigning unfamiliarity.

"And this is..."

"I am Zhuang Pingye, of the Guyan Zhuang Clan," the man replied with a smile.

Li Jiangqian recognized him; this was indeed the famous talisman-sword successor from Guyan. "Daoist Friend, you have a truly striking countenance," Li Jiangqian praised.

Zhuang Pingye was indeed exceptionally handsome, but his was the dazzling handsomeness of wealth and dashing flair. His features—a broad, noble forehead, bright lips, white teeth, and a full chin—were so opulent they commanded attention. Yet, he lacked true refined grace. He was prettier than Li Xizhi, but Li Xizhi possessed an enduring quality to his looks that Zhuang Pingye lacked. His beauty was also starkly different from Li Xijun’s cold, sharp elegance.

His looks and bearing were first-class, and he was clearly accustomed to praise. He bowed politely to Li Jiangqian.

"Greetings, Clan Head!"

His voice was also extremely pleasant, compelling trust. Based on this first impression alone, Zhuang Pingye seemed an impeccable candidate for a husband. Li Xuanxuan watched with a faint smile, nodding slightly.

Li Jiangqian nodded, and Zhuang Pingye immediately added:

"I heard that Xinghan enjoys sword arts. I recently acquired a rather unique sword manual in the Great Desert and brought it to study with her."

Li Jiangqian glanced at Li Xinghan, who nodded gently. He offered a few more pleasantries, praising Zhuang Pingye. Though the young man smiled, he deflected every compliment with practiced humility. Not wanting to intrude, Li Jiangqian took his leave.

'With that appearance and bearing, he’s certainly not beneath Aunt. He doesn't seem like a brainless fool, either... Though he's a few years older, his prospects for reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm look very promising...'

As Li Jiangqian flew back on the wind, solidifying his impression of the man, Li Xuanxuan spoke.

"It seems Xinghan isn't averse to him. He has a good demeanor and is clearly generous. Matters of affection often rise and fall as quickly as an overturned cup or spilled tea. We must investigate clearly, and quickly—how many brothers does he have? His paternal line consists of high-level cultivators, but what about his maternal line? Does he have any black marks on his record? If this needs to be stopped, it must be stopped early, before it harms anyone."

Li Jiangqian replied cautiously, "Elder, I already investigated this. He is the youngest legitimate son of Zhuang Cheng. His mother, a woman from a minor clan, died early. The subsequent official wife bore no children, which is why Zhuang Cheng keeps seven concubines... Still, he has very few legitimate sons. Zhuang Pingye is deeply favored, surrounded by numerous servant girls and songstresses, but he has no heirs."

Li Jiangqian had only revealed a fraction of what he knew, but the implication was clear. Li Xuanxuan frowned. Then again, one of his own descendants was also known to indulge in that path, so he only hesitated, offering no reply. The two descended back onto the island, arriving at Qingdu. The old man sighed.

"These things are often unavoidable... We shall wait and see."

They landed. Li Jiangqian returned to the main hall in the center of the island via his fire technique and took his seat. A guard soon reported that Xia Shouyu was waiting outside.

This woman had, after all, been personally selected by Li Ximing, and furthermore, she was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Li Jiangqian treated her with considerable respect and immediately invited her in. Xia Shouyu was escorted into the hall. She bowed.

"Greetings, Clan Head... I have been looking for Young Master Zhouming these past few days, but he was nowhere to be found this morning. His attendants mentioned he went for an outing by the lake, but I found no trace of him. Since the weather is rather oppressive, I came here to inquire..."

'An outing in this blazing heat? Where else could he be... he’s off indulging his vices.'

Li Zhouming had been remarkably well-behaved recently, so much so that Li Xuanxuan almost believed the boy was finally mending his ways. But a fox cannot hide its tail. The itch obviously became unbearable, and he had gone off to rendezvous with some woman. Li Jiangqian felt the awkwardness of the situation and forced a smile.

"My uncle does have a habit of taking such outings. He often rides out alone, and even the servants cannot track him."

Xia Shouyu observed his reaction and understood the situation perfectly. However, with the marriage agreement still pending, a woman as calculating as she would never choose to make an issue of it now. She smiled.

"I understand. It was merely a casual mention. The wedding date is approaching, so I came to find the Clan Head to discuss the arrangements."

Her expression turned serious. "My family members were supposed to come here, but considering the Daoist Master’s situation... the Daoist Master gave specific instructions not to expose anything. I fear that if cultivators from my home traveled here, their movements might be revealed. Yet, planning this alone seems inappropriate. Therefore, I came specifically to consult the Clan Head..."

Li Jiangqian fell silent, observing her expression just as carefully, weighing his calculations.

Xia Shouyu’s engagement had been personally decreed by Li Ximing. Her background was a mystery, but Li Jiangqian had no authority to question the decision. Besides, she handled every matter meticulously, leaving no room for complaint.

By framing it this way, she made any request to meet her elders seem unnecessary. He couldn't tell if this was a strategic maneuver—advancing by retreating—or a genuine desire to consult. With Li Ximing’s reputation backing her, Li Jiangqian could only concede.

"Senior is commendably cautious. We shall proceed with the wedding according to custom. With the Daoist Master vouching for you, the formalities with your sect are not urgent..."

He set aside the letter in his hand and smiled. "However, Senior possesses the rare Blazing Fire Dao lineage. Such lineages have specific requirements. If there is any location within the lake region better suited for your cultivation, you must mention it. Since you cannot currently contact your sect, you may also list any spiritual items required for your high-grade techniques."

"The juniors in the family are also quite curious about the Blazing Fire lineage and were hoping to ask you for guidance."

Xia Shouyu’s heart tightened, though her smile remained unchanged. "There is no need for spiritual items; I brought sufficient supplies when I left home. As for guidance... I would not dare presume to instruct the Immortal Clan. However, if the juniors visit, I will certainly not be negligent in their teaching."

Li Jiangqian was about to press the point when the sound of hurried footsteps echoed from the entrance. Cui Jueyin appeared at the hall entrance, his expression urgent. He bowed quickly, and Li Jiangqian swallowed the rest of his sentence as Cui Jueyin approached and whispered:

"Clan Head... someone from the Golden Feather Sect has arrived. It is the individual closest to Daoist Master Qiushui—Zhang Duanyan of the Golden Feather Sect. She is waiting outside the island perimeter."

'Qiushui? Zhang Duanyan!'

If one had to name the most unprovokable figures in all of Jiangnan, one was the sole survivor of the Three Yuans, Daoist Master Yuanxiu. The other was this very Daoist Master Qiushui. Both were cultivators on the verge of trying the Golden Core realm, figures that even other Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters deeply feared.

Furthermore, Daoist Master Qiushui was a Great Daoist Master specializing in the Whole Pill path and a member of the Golden Feather Zhang family, placing her status even a notch above Daoist Master Yuanxiu. This meant Zhang Duanyan’s authority within the Golden Feather Sect was scarcely less than that of the Sect Master!

Li Jiangqian’s pupils constricted. He shot to his feet and strode rapidly down from the dais, offering a brief apology to Xia Shouyu as he passed.

"An honored guest is at the gate. I must greet them immediately. Please forgive me for neglecting you, Senior."

How could Xia Shouyu possibly complain about being neglected? She was practically breathing a sigh of relief. Li Jiangqian vanished from the hall in moments, and she hurriedly excused herself, making her way back to her own cultivation abode.

Li Jiangqian, meanwhile, had no capacity to analyze their conversation further. His mind filled with unease, he exited the hall and rode the wind toward the island’s edge. Sure enough, a woman stood waiting in the small pavilion there.

The woman was tall and dressed in golden robes. A golden gauze veiled the lower half of her face, revealing only a pair of calm eyes and fair skin. Her hands were clasped behind her back. An old man, eyes half-closed and back hunched, stood beside her.

The woman was currently gazing out at the lake scenery with what seemed to be an appreciative smile. However, her ramrod-straight posture and a subtle hesitation in her movements betrayed an inner turmoil.

Li Jiangqian hurriedly landed his flames outside the pavilion and entered on foot, bowing deeply. "Greetings, Emissary of the Immortal Sect."

Zhang Duanyan turned and returned the bow. She studied him for a moment. "You are Li Jiangqian. Let us speak inside."

Li Jiangqian and Cui Jueyin led the pair inside, guiding them through the defensive formations and back to the great hall. Zhang Duanyan observed their surroundings and nodded.

"The Li Clan has governed this lake region with considerable merit, surpassing the Jiang family of old."

Li Jiangqian clasped his hands. "The Jiangs were descendants of an Immortal Mansion; we cannot compare. We have merely benefited from our Daoist Master’s good fortune, which has allowed us some prosperity..."

Zhang Duanyan smiled faintly. Faced with an emissary from the Golden Feather Sect, Li Jiangqian tactfully bypassed the main audience hall, guiding them instead toward a rear hall.

The reason was simple: the main audience hall possessed only one high seat, forcing an awkward declaration of status. Zhang Duanyan was not at the Purple Mansion Realm, but she was the mouthpiece for one, and her personal background was illustrious. With his own Daoist Master absent, Li Jiangqian letting her take the high seat would seem obsequious; taking it himself would be arrogant. The rear hall, with its less formal seating, solved the dilemma. They sat, and Cui Jueyin served tea.

Li Jiangqian spoke respectfully. "The Emissary of the Immortal Sect gracing our humble abode brings radiance to the entire lake region. May I ask what guidance you bring us?"

"There are indeed arrangements to discuss. Have you had news of your Daoist Master in recent years? It would be best if he were present to oversee this matter."

Zhang Duanyan nodded lightly, returning his polite smile as she inquired after Li Ximing’s whereabouts. Li Jiangqian replied:

"The Daoist Master is traveling overseas, and we have received no news of his return. If the Immortal Emissary needs me to relay a message to him, I fear I am unable to do so."

Zhang Duanyan sighed softly. "The Clan Head misunderstands. A few days ago, an emissary from the North arrived at the Golden Feather mountain gate. They bore an Immortal Order, and after negotiations with my Golden Feather Sect, a great matter was decided. I have been dispatched south to transmit this order to the various sects."

'An emissary from the North?'

The Zhang family had never shown any deference to Buddhist cultivators. For Zhang Duanyan to refer to this person as an emissary from the North—and even subtly imply her own status was lower—the origin of this visitor was obvious.

'Mount Luoxia!'

Just as this realization struck Li Jiangqian, Zhang Duanyan rose from her seat. Her veil vanished, revealing a lovely face with bright eyes and pristine teeth. She spoke in a low voice:

"This decree should have been received at the Tiantai Dharma Realm. Fortunately, it was already formally received once at the Golden Feather Sect. This is merely a transmission, one step removed from the original Immortal Rank, but it is still improper to announce it indoors. If the decree cannot reach the heavens, this hall will collapse. If my feet do not touch the raw earth, the foundations beneath us will shatter..."

Li Jiangqian only had to gesture her one step back; the rear of the hall opened directly onto a courtyard exposed to the sky. Zhang Duanyan judged it spacious enough.

"All of you, bow now."

The old man accompanying her was already prostrate on the ground, his expression respectful to the point of terror. Li Jiangqian and Cui Jueyin bowed down. Zhang Duanyan’s expression turned utterly solemn. She retreated half a step, bowed deeply from the waist, raised her hands above her head, and respectfully intoned:

"Comprehending Profundity’s purple reflection, the Wu light revealing the dawn mist; the Golden Oneness of this Dao, I humbly beseech thee."

The Great Void did not tremble, nor did any spiritual light flash. Her hands merely vibrated faintly, and a scroll materialized within them. It was white with a brown border, looking as commonplace as a mortal book as it lay flat in her palms.

Li Jiangqian’s heart seized. He dared not ask a thing. He only registered that every sound of bird and insect in the garden had fallen utterly silent. The wind stopped. Even the bright light from the zenith above seemed to dim.

Zhang Duanyan’s expression was grave, her normally calm eyes filled only with profound weight. Her voice dropped low: "On the twenty-second day of the seventh month, in the twenty-second year of Shenxuan, the Wu Light accepts the offering. The Celestial Entourage shall honor the realm, arriving at the Three Streams of Jiangbei. It descends to observe the mortal world, to spread virtue and grace. It proceeds thence to Qilu, returning in six years and six months. All clans in the lands it traverses must burn incense and perform the rites. Close your doors and do not disturb the passage. In all places the Celestial Entourage treads, deference is paramount. Do not entangle yourself in this causality."

Zhang Duanyan only spoke the words; the immortal decree in her hands was never unrolled. Perhaps the Li family lacked the status to see it, or perhaps opening it would unleash something terrifying. The scroll remained inert in her palms.

Yet her voice echoed in the profound silence. Li Jiangqian slowly bowed his head lower, his mind roaring like thunder.

'Mount Luoxia’s *Celestial Entourage* is coming to Jiangbei to observe the mortal world...'

Whose entourage could possibly come from Mount Luoxia? It had to be a True Monarch! "Observe the mortal world"... the phrase sounded magnificent, projecting an air of supreme authority, but it meant only one thing: a True Monarch was reincarnating and descending!

'Proceeds to Qilu, returning in six years and six months...'

This True Monarch intended to carve a path from Jiangbei straight through to the lands of Qilu, returning to Mount Luoxia after six years and six months—a precise repetition of what Chu Yi had done all those years ago!

As for the warnings about deference and causality, it felt less like a threat and more like a merciful reminder: this True Monarch was descending to observe the world's suffering as the path to reclaim his Fruition Attainment. Any great clan or immortal sect that blocked his way would be scattered like dust in the wind.

'Back then, Chu Yi rose abruptly and annihilated the great clans of Yufu Prefecture. Our family knew nothing concrete, only whispers and speculation. Now... only because we have achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, do we finally qualify to receive Mount Luoxia’s direct orders...'

While Li Jiangqian still possessed the clarity to analyze the situation, Cui Jueyin was frozen solid beside him, stunned into a statue. His legs trembled violently. As a direct descendant of the Overseas Cui Clan—a line that had suffered repeated torments—his terror of a True Monarch ran far deeper than Li Jiangqian’s, perhaps even deeper than Zhang Duanyan’s.

Zhang Duanyan herself remained solemn, her eyes overflowing with boundless awe and reverence, as if her own consciousness had been swept away. Yet, it seemed genuine. Only the knuckles of the hands gripping the scroll had turned white.

She was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator; that grip contained enough force to shatter brick, yet the immortal decree remained utterly pristine, without the slightest wrinkle. Li Jiangqian kept his eyes firmly fixed on the ground, his voice resonant with deference.

"This lowly cultivator accepts the decree!"

The immortal decree in Zhang Duanyan’s hands vanished abruptly, as if it had never existed. The woman stepped forward naturally to help Li Jiangqian rise, her voice emerging slightly hoarse.

"Clan Head, please rise quickly."

Li Jiangqian accepted the gesture and rose, though a heavy pressure remained lodged in his chest. Beside him, Cui Jueyin was drenched in sweat, his eyes lowered to mere slits, his gaze seemingly nailed to the earth, utterly unable to look up.

The four returned inside in silence. Zhang Duanyan took her seat but remained quiet.

Zhang Duanyan had traveled here from the Golden Feather Sect. The Li clan didn't know which stop this was on her itinerary, but based on geography, they had to be the first or second. The woman clearly had little experience reciting an immortal decree. It wasn't only the Li family members who were shaken; her own face was pale, and she seemed to be struggling to catch her breath.

Li Jiangqian quickly adjusted his emotions and poured her fresh tea. "We have truly troubled the Immortal Emissary to make this trip simply to warn my family... Jiangqian thanks you on behalf of the entire Li clan!"

Zhang Duanyan raised the cup to her lips and took a sip. Her eyes betrayed her exhaustion, but she forced herself to maintain the proper etiquette. "The Clan Head speaks too gravely. This is merely within the scope of my duty."

Li Jiangqian considered this, then asked, "Just one thing... this 'twenty-second year of Shenxuan, seventh month.' My family is unfamiliar with this calendar. When is that?"

Zhang Duanyan replied in a low voice, "Shenxuan is the calendar used by the Northern Dao lineages, reckoned by the spiritual atmosphere. It corresponds to June, two years from now."

Li Jiangqian sighed softly, searing the date into his memory. But Zhang Duanyan spoke again, her expression turning solemn.

"Since the Celestial Entourage will be in Jiangbei, the grudge between your esteemed clan and the White Ye Immortal Sect must be set aside. If you are still preoccupied with such squabbles when this begins, I fear that in the end..."

She hesitated, trailing off. Li Jiangqian nodded quickly.

"Emissary, rest assured, my clan knows its limits. We would never do such a thing. The affairs of a True Monarch are far beyond our touch. We will not intentionally provoke the Capital immortals Dao... But we cannot guarantee their restraint."

"Rest assured on that count."

Zhang Duanyan shook her head. "The Capital immortals Dao will absolutely not make a move. They will not use this as an opportunity for any schemes or assassinations. They will not even allow the *thought* to arise. This matter is far beyond the control of any Purple Mansion Realm. If anyone harbors such designs, the result is often the annihilation of both parties, and worse, it is an offense to the North. That is tantamount to punching a hole in the heavens."

Li Jiangqian finally relaxed. Only then did Zhang Duanyan continue:

"In another two days or so, the decree will also have been delivered to the Capital immortals Dao. I implore your clan and the Capital immortals Dao to negotiate properly. Use the two years you have. Withdraw the personnel that must be withdrawn. Swiftly promote the clans necessary to hold the territory. Ensure the boundaries are handed over properly. Do this, so you are not forced to sever a limb to survive when the time comes."

"As for the rites and incense, it is best to perform them to the fullest extent. No one truly knows the specifics of this situation. It would be best to construct a high altar and ensure all formalities are observed."

"This junior obeys!"

Zhang Duanyan let out a slow breath. She pondered for a long moment before speaking again, as if steeling herself to add a final warning.

"Daoist Master Qiushui met Senior Xuanfeng back in the day. There was some affinity there, and she holds him in high regard. Furthermore, my grandfather shares a deep friendship with your clan. Therefore, I will offer one personal reminder: your clan must remain quiet. Do not entertain any thoughts of making contact. That path leads only to eternal damnation."

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian felt a flicker of suspicion. 'Where is this warning coming from? She already made the point clear. It’s not as if our family is ignorant of the Chu Yi affair. Why would we be insane enough to attempt contact with a True Monarch?'

He immediately replied aloud, "That is absolutely impossible. My clan would never seek its own destruction."

Zhang Duanyan nodded lightly and turned her gaze to Cui Jueyin. This time, her tone was not so polite. "And you."

Cui Jueyin was still drenched in sweat. Being singled out, he sucked in a sharp breath and bowed deeply. "I swear on the Chongzhou Cui Clan, I will never defy the Immortal Decree!"

Zhang Duanyan sipped her tea, finally guiding the conversation away from the terrifying subject. Her voice softened. "Once this affair has passed, both Daoist Master Yuanxiu and my own Daoist Master Qiushui will be attempting to break through to the Golden Core realm. It is rare for a Daoist Master of my Zhang family to seek their Dao in the outside world. We will be sure to send your clan an invitation. If your Daoist Master has returned from his travels and is in residence, he is more than welcome to observe the ceremony."

The Zhang family, unlike the Chi clan, were the legitimate, direct descendants of True Monarch Taiyuan—true Golden Core Immortal Descendants. The Golden Feather Sect’s Grotto-Heaven was on an entirely different level than the domain at Pristine Water; countless members of their direct lineage likely cultivated within it.

When a Daoist Master of the Zhang family neared the end of their lifespan, they would perish inside that Grotto-Heaven, feeding their spiritual essence back into their domain rather than letting it scatter to benefit outsiders. Zhang Tianyuan, who had not been seen in years, had almost certainly followed this path.

Zhang Duanyan phrased it elegantly, but the reality was that aside from their ancestors on the Path of Metal Virtue, none of the Zhang family's recent Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had managed to cultivate the Five Dao Divine Abilities to completion. Now, all their hopes rested on Qiushui.

For a Golden Core Immortal Descendant to speak this way already showed immense respect. Li Jiangqian hurriedly returned the bow.

"The Great Daoist Master is the foremost expert of the Whole Pill path beneath the heavens! Her cultivation and techniques shake the world. She will certainly attain Fruition Attainment. My clan need only prepare our congratulatory gifts and wait for the day when heaven and earth celebrate with her!"

# Chapter 826: Rumors

"Let us hope your auspicious words come to pass, Family Head."

Zhang Duanyan shifted her gaze away from Cui Jueyin and replied.

The attempt by Daoist Master Qiushui to seek the Whole Pill Fruition Attainment was the one thing the entire Zhang family desperately hoped would succeed. It was also an endeavor the entire Golden Feather Sect was sparing no effort to support. The benefits of gaining another True Monarch were so enticing that the mere thought could make one’s breath quicken. Li Jiangqian's words had clearly struck the right chord, bringing a hint of a smile to Zhang Duanyan’s face.

"The Sect has been paying attention to the brethren of your noble clan... truly, all are talents. My Golden Oneness of Highest Azure daoist tradition also regards them highly. If the opportunity arises, you may send them to the mountains to seek entry. Although my family is strict in recruiting cultivators from outside the Grotto-Heaven, given the aptitude of your clan's geniuses, they would have a very strong chance."

Li Jiangqian smiled and nodded, uncertain how much of her statement was genuine and how much was mere courtesy. Since she hadn't produced any token or command sigil, he treated it as polite chatter and refilled her tea.

The Golden Feather Sect’s stance toward the Li family was neither good nor overtly malicious; it remained perpetually ambiguous. Although they proclaimed to their own disciples that Li Tongya and Zhang Yun were close friends, when it came to practical matters, there was little tangible support to speak of.

This wasn't specifically targeted at the Li clan. Compared to other sects, Golden Feather already showed considerable goodwill toward Moongaze Lake. When Yuansu died and the matter of Li Xuanfeng's custody fell into the hands of the Purple Mansion realm cultivators, Qiushui’s attitude had been amicable. The present Zhang Duanyan was also approachable. Had it been any other power, their attitude might not have been nearly so pleasant.

The Golden Feather Sect had always acted with a certain capriciousness. If their interests aligned, they could be generous in sharing benefits. If their interests conflicted, the Dao lineage wouldn't hesitate to inflict harm. Despite this, their reputation in Jiangnan remained quite good. After all, for such an enormous Golden Core Dao Lineage, people tended to forget its severity and were far better at remembering its kindness, provided it showed even a sliver of gentleness.

Now that their business was concluded, Li Jiangqian began to subtly probe for information, sighing.

"My family has only just attained the Purple Mansion Realm, and we must rely on your esteemed sect for guidance in all matters. The Upper Sect from the north has passed down an edict, which we were fortunate to receive via Golden Feather... After all, years ago, that Daoist Master Chi... he was observing the mortal world within the Azure Pond territory. When Azure Pond received their orders, they completely disregarded the minor clans below them..."

His face showed resentment, but the words carried a deeper meaning.

No one knew if Mount Luoxia had actually passed the command to Azure Pond. His question, while appearing to be a complaint, would inevitably force a response that hinted at the positions of the various sects. More importantly, it touched upon the nature of Golden Feather's role in this trip. For the dignified Golden Feather Immortal Sect to act as a mere messenger was, ultimately, not a glorious affair.

Zhang Duanyan sipped her tea before replying.

"When Azure Pond was previously under Daoist Master Chi, he was indeed a bit hasty and paid little attention to the people's livelihood."

Having said this, she skillfully avoided the Azure Pond issue and instead smiled.

"The ancients always emphasized the division of Dao Lineages. Take the Green Pine Supreme Yang Dao Lineage; it can be traced all the way back to an Immortal Lord. As long as one inherits the Green Pine Supreme Yang Dao Lineage, they must show each other some face. Outsiders who see this connection will also take a step back."

"Jiangbei is also one such region of lineages. If we speak purely of Dao Lineage divisions, my Golden Feather has some jurisdiction over sects like Chengyun and Xuanmiao. This is the same reason the northern power is referred to as the Upper Sect."

It was a clever answer, deftly sidestepping the matter of Azure Pond. Li Jiangqian nodded.

A nostalgic look crossed Zhang Duanyan's face as she continued, "Once... in the Ten Directions Conclave, there were established rules between sects. Only remnants of those rules remain today. Your noble clan can still rely on this connection to pay respects to the various Supreme Yang Dao Lineages. When the Immortal Mansion existed, noble clan would have been considered a subordinate. Although they would count as part of the Supreme Yang Dao Lineage, there was a clear hierarchy between you and direct lines like Purple Smoke and Azure Pond... Nowadays, however, that hierarchy is not so easily enforced."

She paused, then looked at Li Jiangqian with a smile and nodded. "I heard my grandfather mention... the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture... is in your clan's possession?"

Li Jiangqian’s expression flickered, but he nodded lightly.

While the matter was important, there was no reason to hide it. Zhang Yun himself had visited the Li family years ago to confirm this. Now that the family had their own Purple Mansion Realm expert, the cultivation method no longer seemed so dangerously valuable as to invite disaster.

Thus, Li Jiangqian rose from his seat, bowed, and replied, "Years ago, my ancestor was acquainted with Senior Zhang Yun. They discovered a hidden trove together, divided the spiritual items, and thus obtained this technique. It has been kept in our treasury ever since."

Zhang Duanyan showed no surprise. "The Great River and Grand Mound Scripture has been lost for many years, and our sect lacked the method to unseal it. We believed that with Senior Tongya's celestial bearing, he would surely have the fortuitous opportunity to decipher it. So, it was entrusted to your clan, considered a continuation of his Dao path."

"We never imagined that Jingzhan would harm the senior and his son. At that time, voices within the sect demanded we send someone to the lake to retrieve both the cultivation method and the Duruo. My grandfather argued against the consensus, came personally, and intended to exchange it for the Wanling Flower as a replacement."

Li Jiangqian listened intently as the woman chuckled. "He didn't expect the Wanling Flower to be connected to Yinghua, so Grandfather returned empty-handed. It was then that the voices in the sect claimed he was protecting Senior Tongya’s descendants due to their deep friendship."

"So that's how it was!" Li Jiangqian nodded thoughtfully, musing internally.

'The news that the Jade slip contained the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture came during the destruction of the Moongaze Lake Market. That group of people... perhaps it included Golden Feather cultivators who intentionally shouted the name to give our family a clue.'

Finally understanding the origin of the rumor, he naturally wouldn't say anything else, offering only, "My deepest thanks to your predecessor!"

He then asked, "Senior Zhang entered seclusion to break through. Is there any news?"

Zhang Duanyan’s expression remained unchanged. "My lord broke through long ago. He is currently within the Grotto-Heaven studying mystic arts."

"Senior truly is a peerless talent!" Li Jiangqian nodded slowly, a realization dawning on him.

'There were no phenomena in the wider world. It seems... one truly can break through to the Purple Mansion Realm inside a Grotto-Heaven. If so, then how many Purple Mansion experts the Golden Feather Sect actually has, how many are active in the world, and how many might have fallen... it’s nearly impossible for the outside world to discern.'

'A Grotto-Heaven... truly extraordinary. It's understandable why Yue Cultivating Sect abandoned Jiangbei and Yue State. Even if they lost all their external territories, they still possess an entire, vast world within the Grotto-Heaven.'

The two chatted for a while longer. When the sun passed noon, she rose to leave. Li Jiangqian escorted her beyond the island. As they were parting, Zhang Duanyan turned back, a bright smile on her face.

"Since your noble clan cannot open the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture, letting it sit in your treasury for a hundred or even a thousand years won't change that. Why not let it go? Allow someone in the world bound by fate to obtain it. They will surely make it shine with brilliance."

She seemed to be implying something specific. Li Jiangqian, catching her meaning, replied, "I understand. Thank you for the guidance, Immortal Emissary."

She and the old man then departed to the north. Based on their flight path, they were likely heading toward the White Ye Immortal Sect.

Li Jiangqian mulled over her words on his way back.

'It makes sense. It will never open itself just sitting in the treasury. But if we let it flow out into the world, we'll lose track of it. It seems we must identify the right person to pass it to, just as the Zhang family did with us...'

'But how to identify this person? Furthermore, their cultivation method would need to be compatible...'

He found this approach too inefficient and frowned... when a better idea struck him.

'Perhaps we could have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator use their divine abilities to place a secret imprint upon its surface. Then we let it drift freely. When the time comes and someone opens it, we would sense it, shatter the Great Void to arrive as if reaping a harvest, and obtain a superior Purple Mansion Dao Lineage.'

At this thought, a chill climbed his spine.

'If I can think of this, wouldn't the Zhang family also have thought of it? Wouldn't the various Purple Mansion experts who carved up Lingyu Gate have thought of it? Can it be that this item was released... just waiting for a cultivator bearing the mark of destiny to activate it?'

'How did Zhang Yun determine that my ancestor carried the mark of destiny? Could it be that the copy of the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture he saw happened to share the same energetic affinity as my ancestor's cultivation method, allowing it to be continued? And seeing his extraordinary bearing, he decided to test him, thus forming his speculation?'

'If the Zhang family hadn't hinted at it, I would never have considered this possibility!'

Even someone as ruthless as him couldn't help but feel suspicious. 'Ordinary cultivators might not think of such a venomous plot. Whether this imprint exists or not... we'll know as soon as the Daoist Master returns. I'll ask him to examine it.'

Li Jiangqian walked back to the main hall, lost in thought. The teapot and jade cups had already been cleared from the table. Cui Jueyin followed behind him, his head lowered, seemingly in a daze.

Suddenly, Li Jiangqian turned around. "Protector Cui, regarding this matter with the Upper Sect, does the Cui family have any knowledge?"

Cui Jueyin bowed deeply, his gaze fixed on the floor. "Reporting to the Family Head... it is truly that my family... for a thousand years... what we have endured... endured..."

This Foundation Establishment Realm Daoist, who for years had always maintained the calm and elegant demeanor of a noble scion, now seemed utterly terrified. The mere mention of Mount Luoxia seemed to evoke an extreme, primal fear.

"The Dongli Sect... annihilated in an instant... A direct edict from the Upper Sect. Our ancestors acted rashly and defied it. Three generations were nearly exterminated. Even Purple Mansion Divine Abilities cultivators died violently within days. We must fear it. We *dare not* fail to fear it!"

"Now, the edict is before us. All we can do is tremble, prostrate ourselves, and await orders."

Li Jiangqian stared gravely at him. Beads of sweat continued to drip uncontrollably from Cui Jueyin's neck, one after another. This was the first time he had ever seen Cui Jueyin in such a state, and he sensed a profound, deep-seated unease.

'If I keep pressing, I'm afraid disaster will spring from his words.' He sighed inwardly and said, "Protector Cui, go and rest well."

Cui Jueyin stood, bowed, and retreated from the side. Li Jiangqian’s gaze fell upon the empty desk.

'Comprehending Profoundity, reflecting the purple. Wu Light meeting the heavenly glows. The Jin-Yi path... is one of supplication.'

'Golden Feather has a reputation of subservience to the north... and most of the time, this reputation is fact. That entity in the north... is confirmed to be at the Dao Embryo realm, without a doubt. As for how many Dao Embryos are behind them... that is hard to say.'

'Zhang Duanyan implicitly revealed that the Jiangbei families and Golden Feather belong to the same Dao Lineage. Since Golden Feather cannot refuse, these lineages can all be considered subordinates of Luoxia. This means the mastermind behind the conflict between north and south, and the designs on the fertile lands of Jiangbei, is also perfectly clear.'

A feeling of powerlessness rose in his heart. He forced the thought away and focused his mind back on Jiangbei.

'The Ding Clan moved their entire population; they can be protected. Qu Bushi and Miaoshui are merely local guest elders with shallow connections. The family's deepest entanglement... is the Wang Clan.'

The Jiangbei Wang Clan had lived and grown in this place for generations. Escape was impossible. No matter how cleanly they tried to cut ties, the karma remained.

"Right now, whoever is biggest in Jiangbei is destined for the worst luck... We must pull back from the lands of Funan for now. Bring all the cultivators back. Let it go wild. Don't touch it. Don't even go near it."

He summoned an attendant. "Pass down my order. Tell the Second Young Master to depart immediately and report back to the Lake."

The attendant received the order and was about to leave when Li Jiangqian hesitated, then called him back. "Go and ask Protector Cui. It would be best if he personally traveled to Jiangbei to deliver this order."

Besides Li Jiangqian himself, Cui Jueyin was the only one in the family who understood the gravity of the situation. His own brothers were not easy people to deal with, and this matter was one of absolute urgency. Li Jiangqian could not afford any mistakes.

He immediately got busy, spreading out the bamboo slips on his desk, noting down every possible oversight.

'Wang Quwan is tied to the Secret Diffusion Dao Lineage. We must protect him if possible... but his connections to the Jiangbei Wang Clan run too deep... this is truly...'

As Li Jiangqian pondered this, he suddenly froze. A dark cloud of suspicion crawled across his features.

'Wang Quwan... Wang Quwan... It couldn't be... Could it be that destiny pushed this person forward first, intending him to be a stepping stone for that True Monarch? If so... isn't this man doomed to die?'

His heart heavy, he deliberated for a long time before ordering, "Summon Qu Bushi."

Old Man Qu’s immortal foundation was the Palace of Concealed Storage. He excelled at surveying earth-veins and nurturing spiritual fields. Having already organized the lands of Funan, he had spent the last few years by the lake identifying fields, teaching a few apprentices, and re-classifying the Li clan’s spiritual fields. He was living a quiet, secluded life.

He was quite idle, so he arrived quickly at the hall upon being summoned, prostrating on the floor. "This lowly one greets the Family Head!"

This old man usually kept a low profile, avoiding involvement in anything significant. He was exceptionally cunning, which was precisely why Li Jiangqian had sought him out. He smiled and asked:

"I need to ask you about something. You are very familiar with Funan in Jiangbei. Are there any independent cultivators there, Foundation Establishment Realm, who have absolutely zero connection to my family?" He paused, then added, "Preferably ones who aren't gentle... the tyrannical, overbearing types."

Qu Bushi was baffled by the request but sank into deep thought. "There are many independent cultivators in Jiangbei now, but very few in Funan; it's mostly managed by our own cultivators and manpower. However, I have heard... in the Midong territory, there are several."

Midong had been tossed by the Li family into the hands of the Capital immortals Dao and had long since devolved into chaos. The Capital immortals Dao had sent several cultivators to manage it over the years, but all had failed. Eventually, they resorted to simply collecting a stipend, and the place remained a total mess.

Qu Bushi observed his expression, guessing he was looking for some kind of scapegoat, and answered:

"If Milord is looking for someone ignorant and untraceable, this subordinate has an idea. There are countless people like that in the Eastern Sea. Lure one over, tempt him, perhaps point a demonic cultivator his way... let him murder for treasure and create his own sect gates. Once the man is dead, everything vanishes. Very convenient."

Qu Bushi truly lived up to his reputation as someone who had survived the Eastern Sea to reach Foundation Establishment. Li Jiangqian considered this and immediately had a plan.

'The Capital immortals Dao will surely send someone to negotiate soon. This isn't a matter for just one family. I vaguely recall that Guan Gongxiao also knows how to handle things. This is the perfect time to deal with it.'

'This will also force our two families to break the cold war we've had for years. I wonder what the Capital immortals Dao's attitude will be.'

He looked up. "Guest Elder Qu, stay by my side for the next few months. When the time comes, there will be matters I need to discuss with you."

# Chapter 827: Consultation

Li Jiangqian waited for more than a day before Cui Jueyin strode in from outside the hall. His emotions appeared to have stabilized; he bowed, his composed attitude restored, and reported, "Patriarch, the Second Young Master is outside the hall."

"Please, let him in."

After Li Jiangqian replied, Cui Jueyin immediately withdrew. A short while later, a man entered the hall.

He wore simple cloth robes and plain boots, his entire person unadorned save for the single sword at his waist. He was already at the late stage of Qi Refining, yet his brow was filled with an easy calm, as if he were a rogue cultivator just emerged from a temple. He approached Li Jiangqian and bowed deeply.

"Greetings, Patriarch!"

This was Li Jianglong. Over the years, he had governed Funan with stability and prosperity. There had not been a single disturbance from rogue or demonic cultivators. He had successfully walled off the chaos of Jiangbei, resolving the Li family’s northern troubles while securing a significant income of spiritual resources. He was, by all measures, exceptionally competent.

He and his third brother, Li Jiangxia, had stabilized two fronts during the chaotic period when Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei had left the family. If not for the three brothers, the clan would have faced countless more troubles.

Li Jiangqian smiled at him and waved his hand gently. The guards stationed in the hall all retreated, closing the main and side doors tight. The spiritual lamps brightened, leaving only the two of them in the vast hall. Li Jiangqian’s smile vanished. He strode down from his seat and personally helped Li Jianglong up.

He spoke heavily. "I have called Second Brother back this time because we are abandoning the Funan territory."

It went without saying how much heart’s blood Li Jianglong had poured into Funan. The statement nearly shattered his composure. He took a moment to steady himself, frowning as he asked, "Patriarch, this is…"

Li Jiangqian said, "A True Monarch intends to reincarnate in Jiangbei. Right in the Sanxi region."

Li Jianglong stared at him blankly.

Shaking his head, Li Jiangqian clarified, "It is a True Monarch from the Northern High Sect. Zhang Duanyan of the Golden Feather Sect came personally to deliver the edict."

Those three sentences completely destroyed Li Jianglong’s calm. His pupils dilated, his face flooded with utter disbelief. After several long breaths, he finally managed to ask, "Like Chu Yi, all those years ago?"

"Correct."

Li Jiangqian affirmed it and led him over to the main desk, spreading out a large map. He summarized the Golden Feather Sect's orders. When he finished, Li Jianglong's expression was one of profound gravity.

"If we mishandle this," Li Jianglong said, "it is a catastrophe that could implicate tens of thousands. It is an event that means death and the annihilation of our clan."

Li Jiangqian nodded. "Second Brother understands Funan best. The situation there, and how we make a clean break... that is the trouble."

Li Jianglong contemplated for a moment, studying the map. "When the Floating Cloud Cave was destroyed, the common folk were plundered by the other two caves and have never recovered. Our family’s control there revolves around the spirit fields and veins, mostly garrisoned by cultivators from outside the region. Withdrawing them won't be difficult... but once we leave, the sparse local population cannot possibly produce many cultivators. They will be stranded and isolated; even self-governance will be a problem."

He continued, "If our family releases this land, Capital immortals Dao will also have to release Midong. Midong is a tangled web of established families. Many immortal sects from both Jiangnan and Jiangbei have people embedded there, and the population is dense. They will immediately move to swallow Funan."

Midong was difficult to govern for two fundamental reasons: first, the massive populations of the established families; second, the various major sects all recruited direct descendants from these families, supporting these local tyrants so they could acquire Jiangbei’s spiritual resources at low cost or through outright plunder. Li Jiangqian knew this well.

"Based on your understanding of Jiangbei," Li Jiangqian asked, "how will the Midong situation develop? Is it possible these families will get the news?"

Li Jianglong pondered this. "They absolutely must not. All the major sects will pull their hands back. A 'local tyrant' is a tyrant precisely because their clan system is enormous, spanning both the overt and the covert. Their lineages are unrestricted and undecaying, resulting in a mix of the worthy and the worthless. This makes them difficult to eradicate, but it also makes it impossible for them to extricate themselves now. Even if they have clan members cultivating in the immortal sects... the light punishment will be the crippling of their cultivation. The heavy one will be execution following accusations of treason."

Li Jiangqian considered this. "Executing them also has drawbacks. What if the clan declines, and Heavenly Fate just so happens to land on their remnants? That would only cause more trouble. Since the edict mentioned sending them 'to Qi and Lu,' let them go there. The ones we should truly fear are the Northern powers. The immortal sects will make a clean break, but they won't be *so* ruthless as to burn every bridge. They must leave themselves a path of retreat."

Li Jianglong observed his brother’s expression and replied, "This little brother was inconsiderate. In that case, we need not convict them. We just need to arrange for someone to... eliminate them. If trouble arises one day, we can simply push out the scapegoat. Since they won't be fleeing south, it will be an easy excuse to make."

"That is the correct logic."

The two brothers stared at the map. Li Jianglong mused, "Funan doesn't have many entanglements, but there are a few local clan cultivators who are difficult to handle. An excuse is easy enough to find. We grant them spiritual items and send them away. After a period, we tell them in advance that we are withdrawing and Capital immortals Dao is moving in. They will flee for their lives with their entire families."

"There are also a few of our cultivators who... enjoyed themselves locally and fathered children. Treat them as Jiangbei rogue cultivators. Take them and their entire villages away. We won't leave behind a single dog or duck."

The Li family employed many cultivators originating from Jiangbei, but thankfully, most were rogue cultivators and easily handled. Li Jiangqian nodded silently in approval.

Suddenly, a light knock sounded at the main door, interrupting their conversation. Qu Bushi entered, his face a mask of suspicion and shock.

"Reporting to the Patriarch! That... that utterly shameless Capital immortals Dao... they sent their fiend guest elder to request an audience!"

Li Jiangqian frowned. "This early? Surely not... How many people did Daoist Friend Guan bring? It wasn't spread around, was it?"

Qu Bushi looked as though he had seen a ghost and nearly bit his tongue. He hesitated, "That fiend... uh... the person from Capital immortals Dao... came alone. He just appeared outside the island... and asked someone to pass the message secretly. This old slave understands the gravity of the situation and did not let anyone see him."

Li Jiangqian let out a breath of relief. "Bring him up through the side hall. Do not let him be seen."

Qu Bushi hurried away. About the time it takes for half an incense stick to burn, a middle-aged man entered. He had been wearing dashing white robes, but the moment he stepped into the hall, his appearance shifted. He now had high brows, deep-set eyes, and wore black Daoist robes tied with a silk belt. He walked into the hall, his face a picture of bitterness, and sighed.

"Greetings, Patriarch!"

Li Jiangqian gave a slight nod, his tone perfectly neutral. "So, it is the Capital immortals Sect Master."

It was, astonishingly, the Capital immortals Sect Master Guan Gongxiao himself.

Guan Gongxiao had no temper to speak of right now, and he was already a mild-mannered man by nature. He shook his head and replied, "With this disaster looming over us, there is no room for old grudges between our families. My family arrived hastily from overseas; we have never encountered anything like this. I came to see the Patriarch the very instant I received the order."

Capital immortals Dao's territory was located even north of the Sanxi region; their situation was infinitely more precarious than the Li family's. Guan Gongxiao was naturally desperate. It wasn't just him; the Xuanmiao Temple and the Chengyun Gate were likely in the exact same predicament.

Li Jiangqian chose not to bicker. He only asked, "Does your Daoist Master have any orders?"

Guan Gongxiao silently shook his head. After a brief pause, he answered, "My family’s Daoist Master entered seclusion many years ago. He is not currently in Jiangbei."

The absence of Daoist Master Yehui was not a critical secret. Many sects with Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had them stationed abroad for long periods, especially those without the reputation of a Supreme Yang Dao Lineage. The fewer Purple Mansion Realm masters a sect had, the less likely they were to remain stationary. Daoist Master Chuting of the Xiao family hadn't returned to Jiangnan in decades, yet the Xiao family remained as stable as Mount Tai.

But when Li Jiangqian heard this, he instantly understood.

'No wonder this fellow rushed over here so frantically,' he thought. 'His Daoist Master is out traveling or in seclusion, and who knows how many years that will last. This is serious. Yehui might be gone for ten years. When he finally emerges, there might not be a single person named Guan left in the entire Baiye region.'

'Looked at this way, the Golden Feather Sect basically just saved the Capital immortals lineage.'

He gestured to the side, inviting Guan Gongxiao to sit. "This is Jianglong, my younger brother."

Guan Gongxiao shook his head. "I have long heard of your brother's reputation. When Wang He was managing Midong earlier, he came to complain every other day. It later escalated to the point where he couldn't salvage the situation."

The brothers did not acknowledge the barb. Guan Gongxiao stood up. "I came here today, first, because I have something I must clarify with your clan."

His expression turned solemn. "My family's Daoist Master has never borne your clan any ill will. Regarding the Changxiao incident, he worked extremely hard to mediate and secretly assist, hoping only to protect your clan as much as possible. Perhaps the Patriarch finds this absurd. But to say something unpleasant..."

"Even if it meant earning your clan's hatred for nothing, my Daoist Master hoped Changxiao would gain one more blood feud. He least of all wanted to see your esteemed father come to harm. Even when a fatal weakness was held by others, he insisted on giving those secret warnings. That was the reason."

He lowered his voice. "Regardless of our families' relationship, on the matter of the Changxiao Sect, my Daoist Master earnestly hopes our two families share the same stance."

Li Jiangqian remained silent for a moment. He was not Li Ximing; he had no understanding of the situation back then. The best response was no response at all. "This is not a matter I can address. It must wait for the Daoist Masters to communicate. The issue currently at hand is the most urgent."

Guan Gongxiao sat back down and nodded.

Li Jiangqian began, "Your esteemed sect must abandon Midong. But a land full of warring factions is ultimately a bad thing. First, we need a 'leader' so that all consequences finally land on him. Second, we need some demonic cultivators or beasts, so the lords can amuse themselves to their satisfaction, saving them the trouble of finding replacements elsewhere. And third... both our sides need a valid reason to withdraw. The loose ends must be tied up so we do not arouse the suspicion of others."

Guan Gongxiao nodded. "The demonic beasts aren't urgent. If a territory is left empty for a year or two, they will naturally appear. The Fanyun territory still has several demon generals causing trouble. There will be plenty to clean up. A leader is also easy to find; the world is overflowing with the greedy. But your third point... that truly is a problem. The families in Midong aren't fools. If both our sides withdraw simultaneously, they will smell a rat immediately."

Li Jiangqian thought for a moment, then whispered, "This isn't without a solution. We just need an excuse."

He used a formation array to send an order. Qu Bushi immediately entered from outside. When he saw Guan Gongxiao seated nearby, the three of them appearing harmonious and even smiling, he felt an internal shockwave. He bowed.

"Greetings Patriarch, Young Master, and Sect Master."

Guan Gongxiao took a sip of tea. "What Sect Master? This humble one is Gongxiao of Jiangbei."

Guan Gongxiao hadn't even bothered to change out of his formal Sect Master robes, yet Qu Bushi saw the smiles on all three faces, nodded repeatedly, and began apologizing profusely.

Li Jiangqian paused briefly, then said, "Daoist Friend Gong has brought news. There is a Secret Diffusion Direct Lineage Token somewhere in Jiangbei. Rumor holds that it contains a favor from a high-level cultivator. The holder can establish their own lineage there, and it even involves a Purple Mansion realm spirit treasury. It is something that even we and Capital immortals Dao cannot interfere with. You are to send men immediately. Dig three feet deep if you must, but you are to find this thing."

Qu Bushi wiped sweat from his brow as he nodded.

Guan Gongxiao smiled slightly and added, "I hear this rumor has spread like the wind. Apparently, a direct disciple of Capital immortals Dao revealed it while drunk. That disciple has already been locked up. Everyone in the Three Rivers area knows about it. The Lake is actually late to hear the news. You must hurry."

Qu Bushi was an old hand who had navigated Jiangbei for years. He had never heard of such a thing. Connecting this to Li Jiangqian's earlier intentions, he instantly understood.

"This old slave will absolutely ensure this matter is carried out to the fullest!"

He hurried away. Li Jiangqian then continued, "Your sect will first start a fight with my family in Funan. We will pull our people back, emptying the land. Simultaneously, fight us across the river, forcing your reserves to reinforce from that direction. Create a standoff. A feigned war."

"At this point, Funan will be abandoned by us. All we need is an ambitious Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Eastern Sea. We let him 'find' this Secret Diffusion Lineage Sect Master Token. With the path to the Purple Mansion realm laid out before him, how could he not be moved?"

"The moment he dares to try... my family will immediately send congratulatory gifts. Your sect will order the Midong families to march south and 'offer tribute' to this new power. Everything will click perfectly into place."

Guan Gongxiao nodded repeatedly. "Good idea! A brilliant idea! My sect has strong connections in the Eastern Sea; gathering information is easy. We already have several candidates on hand."

Li Jiangqian smiled, finding Guan Gongxiao much less disagreeable now. "Then we shall rely on your esteemed sect to lure this ambitious man over."

As for spreading the rumors and the details about the "locked-up disciple," they didn't need further discussion. Guan Gongxiao would handle it perfectly.

Li Jianglong considered the plan but remained worried. He looked at his brother. "But with the Daoist Master absent, things may not go exactly as we anticipate... What if this person gets the token but remains cautious? It could drag matters out."

Li Jiangqian shook his head, his voice turning hollow. "We do not need to concern ourselves with that. Someone *else* will ensure it happens. The rumor will certainly become truer than the truth. One, two, or perhaps even more scapegoats... everyone involved will be delighted to see it."

Both men nodded. Guan Gongxiao then said, "Regardless, in my humble opinion, I fear we must also find the Northern Brocade River King."

At the mention of this prominent follower of the dragon-kin, both brothers frowned.

Li Jiangqian adopted a thoughtful expression. "He likely also has thoughts of moving. He absolutely cannot be allowed to remain here. Leave the matter of this Demon General to us."

"Good!"

Smiling broadly, Guan Gongxiao raised his cup to the two brothers. The two lineages, regarded by the outside world as mortal enemies locked in a death feud, drank tea together like old friends.

Guan Gongxiao lowered his voice. "We must communicate frequently about this matter moving forward. I cannot come here often; it is too easy to expose myself. I will send disciples in disguise, carrying a token, to relay my words. The Lake should do the same."

Li Jiangqian nodded. They dispensed with the formal pleasantries of seeing him off, merely clasping their hands in salute. Guan Gongxiao stepped out of the hall, his appearance completely changed, and was escorted away by a servant.

Li Jianglong watched him depart, his expression unsettled. Li Jiangqian, too, was filled with doubt.

'During the turmoil on the East Shore back then,' Li Jiangqian mused, 'Capital immortals Dao truly was conspicuously restrained... They later sent someone to actively ease tensions, even returning Protector An. I have no idea how much of what he just said was truth and how much was fabrication.'

His gaze locked onto the map on the desk. He suddenly recalled something:

"Zhang Duanyan hid several things when she spoke. When she listed the subordinate relationships, she didn't seem to mention Capital immortals Dao... She listed the others in order but skipped right over them. And the Capital immortals lineage name doesn't even begin with 'Xuan'..."



# Chapter 828: The Manifestation of Earth Virtue

The East A-Wang Sea.

Within the deep, dark veins of the earth, only the faint, flickering glow of flames could be seen. A massive, man-high alchemy cauldron stood upon the primary earth-vein, its surface covered in complex patterns. Intricate carvings of ocean waves and fierce beasts adorned its body, and it rested solidly on three ancient, unadorned legs.

The spirit fire blazed. A ring of bright, surging flames encircled the jet-black cauldron, while a brilliant white inferno leaped and danced beneath it.

Li Ximing had been refining this pill for nearly two years. Though he was confident in the completeness of his alchemical theory, this was his first time attempting to form a pill using the Heavenly Heart Oneness technique. The path had been fraught with peril, but thanks to his exceptionally solid foundation, he had overcome each obstacle one by one.

‘The power of the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was unexpectedly potent and a great help,’ he mused. ‘But the sheer dominance of the Heavenly Heart Oneness technique was just as formidable. Without both, this pill would have been impossible to refine.’

‘Everything is going well, with one small exception… this cauldron can’t take much more.’

The River-Heart Cauldron before him was an ancestral heirloom, acquired by his ancestors during the market place catastrophe. It was merely a Qi Refining grade tool. It only survived to this day because it was an ancient artifact forged from incredibly sturdy materials.

But no matter how sturdy, it couldn't withstand the combined power of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator’s divine abilities and True Fire. The intensity was enough to melt the cauldron into a liquid state; it was only holding its shape thanks to the protection of his power.

‘After this batch, this cauldron will be completely unusable.’

The pill’s refinement was now approaching the final nurturing stage, and he could finally relax his focus. Li Ximing formed a hand seal and cast a spell. The divine ability enveloping the cauldron flashed, and he rose to his feet. Pressing two fingers to his lips, he spat out a speck of purple light.

This spark of Bright Yang flame, infused with his divine ability, pulsed with spiritual energy. It dove under the cauldron and merged into the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire. Li Ximing then chanted:

"Three-Garrison True Fire, nurture this precious pill. With utmost care and focus, await the dawning of its light."

With that, he withdrew his consciousness completely, leaving only his divine ability to shield the cauldron. The spirit fire obediently took over the task of nurturing the pill.

The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire had, after all, been praised even by the Daoist Master Yuandao, Dantai Lingtong, as an exceptional alchemical flame. It had been an immense help during the refinement process, and its own spiritual nature was gentle and not overly destructive, making it perfectly suited for this kind of nurturing work.

"Hah…"

A wave of relief washed over him. He had spent nearly two years in a state of absolute concentration, blending spiritual materials with a alchemy art he had never used before. Even for a cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm, the strain was considerable, and he couldn't help but let out a long, heavy sigh.

He took out a few spirit-nourishing pills and consumed them, nurturing his divine abilitys. Thirty-six days passed. A faint flicker appeared between his brows, and a sudden premonition struck him. He opened his eyes.

‘Tinglan of the Purple Smoke Gate has found me.’

Before entering seclusion in the East A-Wang Sea, he had left a jade pendant with Houfu, imbued with a wisp of his divine ability. They had agreed on a meeting point at the border of the two seas. Now, his Profound Light sensed that it had been crushed.

During the Foundation Establishment Realm, items like this spirit jade needed to be constantly nurtured to maintain a long-distance connection, and they would often lose their efficacy after a few years. Now that he had achieved his own divine abilitys, a single touch was enough to maintain the connection for over a decade. It was far more convenient.

He enveloped the area with a formation, reinforced it with a warning art, and then tore open the Great Void to traverse space. From within the Great Void, he first observed the meeting point. Sure enough, a purple cloud carriage was parked at the border of the two seas, golden ribbons fluttering in the wind. It was unmistakably a Daoist Master from the Purple Smoke Gate.

He didn't approach rashly. Only after confirming there was no ambush did he transform into a ray of Profound Light and descend, materializing before the carriage.

A young woman stood before the vehicle, her features pure and charming. The Profound Light revealed her to be a rabbit Demon beast in human form. She bowed repeatedly upon seeing Li Ximing. Before he had a chance to speak, the carriage curtain was whisked aside. Tinglan, still dressed in her autumn-yellow satin robe, emerged with a slightly embarrassed expression.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing had barely survived his encounter with Changxiao, and his losses were surely not small. The incident had stemmed from an arrangement made by Purple Smoke, and though it was only a catalyst, Tinglan felt responsible. She offered a slight bow.

"It's been too long… The matter at Profound Peak has concluded. I'm so glad you're safe and sound, Daoist Friend. Otherwise… I truly wouldn't have known how to face you…"

Li Ximing didn't blame her much. The fault lay with his own lack of caution; the Purple Smoke Gate could never have predicted such an outcome. Furthermore, now that he was gradually learning of the domineering origins of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, he knew he was in no position to blame them. He replied, "Changxiao's attack was unexpected. Your gate is not at fault."

Unwilling to attract attention here, and still concerned about the unfinished pill in the earth-vein, he continued, "The treasure medicines in my cauldron are not yet finished. I must ask Daoist Friend Tinglan to rest at my humble abode for a while."

Tinglan nodded in agreement. The purple cloud carriage immediately flew toward the sea, descending all the way to the seabed of rolling white sand. Tinglan dismissed the carriage and instructed her attendant, "Wait for me here."

The spirit beast acknowledged the command. Li Ximing activated his Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger technique, and a shroud of earthy yellow light enveloped him and Tinglan, carrying them deep into the earth-veins. Tinglan’s eyes scanned their surroundings.

"The Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains certainly has its merits. Earth-burrowing is no small feat, yet this Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger dharma treasure allows you to travel through earth-veins as if you were an Earth Virtue cultivator. It speaks to the excellence of your lineage."

Hearing the full name of Profound Peak's Dao lineage for the first time, Li Ximing remarked with curiosity, "A Comprehending Profoundity lineage… no wonder they are so close to the Xuanmiao Temple."

Tinglan chuckled. "It can't be called a Comprehending Profoundity lineage. Each of those lineages is distinct and meticulously recorded. The Encompassing Profoundity category is a bit looser, but Comprehending Profoundity is the strictest. Daoist Friend Sumian at least possesses an ancestral portrait; Profound Peak has nothing of the sort."

As they descended, Li Ximing recalled the shady Qi-Stone Demon Embryo that Changxi had given to Sumian, but he remained noncommittal. Tinglan sighed. "An island belonging to my Purple Smoke Gate in the Vermillion Sea has run into trouble. We've been investigating for some time, but it's become quite vexing."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing prompted her. A suspicious look crossed Tinglan's face. "At first, we thought it was a shift in the earth-veins, a problem with the volcanic activity on the seafloor. But after several sweeps with another Daoist Friend, we found traces of an Earth Virtue divine ability. We asked Zhu Gong to take a look, and she suspects a cultivator broke through to a new realm there."

Li Ximing frowned. "The number of Earth Virtue cultivators seems to be growing these days…"

In truth, most demonic cultivators could be considered Earth Virtue cultivators, but people like Li Ximing naturally didn't count them among the ranks. When they spoke of Earth Virtue cultivators, they were referring to figures at the Daoist Master level of the Immortal Dao. Tinglan nodded in agreement, her voice growing somber.

"Indeed. And the geological signs are somewhat similar to 'Manifestations Earth'—one of the two ancient daoist traditions of Sheji, specifically the She daoist tradition, also known as She Immortals. This matter has been a headache for me for a long time. I discussed it with several other Daoist Friends, and their consensus was… the She Immortal dao is a leader of the Immortal Dao. It's best not to dig too deeply."

The daoist traditions of Earth Virtue were numerous and complex; Li Ximing himself had heard of at least six. He could faintly grasp how prominent this Dao must have been in ancient times. The two daoist traditions of Sheji were particularly famous. Although her own Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was noble, its backers were either missing or in seclusion. It might even be a step lower than this She Immortal path. It was no wonder she felt uneasy.

Soon, they arrived at his cave dwelling. Tinglan's eyes lit up in surprise. "What a potent True Fire! This is… from the Three-Cycle lineage, isn't it? That is truly ancient."

That single sentence revealed the depth of knowledge possessed by the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Li Ximing gave a slight nod. His divine ability had already concealed the cauldron completely. Tinglan swept the area with her spiritual sense and smiled. "Such skill and daring. To think a simple Qi Refining cauldron is enough for you to refine such a top-tier spirit pill!"

It was a prettier way of calling him poor, but Li Ximing took it in stride. "I came up with the formula for this pill on a whim, and it is not yet complete. Fortunately, it has reached the nurturing stage. The pill you require needs the Immeasurable Water and Fire and a different cauldron, so there is no conflict."

Hearing him finally bring up her pill, Tinglan crossed her arms and smiled. "Your formations were so well hidden with those mountain-piercing nails, I couldn't even find a trace of you. If I hadn't gotten word from Houfu, I might have ended up doing all this for nothing."

Tinglan's words were spoken in jest, but there was a kernel of truth in them. Li Ximing apologized profusely. "Although there was a delay, it was a blessing in disguise. My skill in the Dao of alchemy has greatly improved, and I am now far more confident in refining your spirit pill."

Tinglan laughed, then her expression turned serious. "We can't delay any longer. I need this pill urgently. Otherwise, considering your recent troubles, I wouldn't have chased you all the way out to this remote sea."

"I have brought the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness and the Immeasurable Water and Fire. As for the cauldron…" Tinglan's already beautiful face became solemn. "I have even managed to borrow the spiritual artifact, the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron, for you."

‘What a grand display… this pill is no ordinary thing.’

Li Ximing was already very confident he could refine the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill, especially with the aid of a better cauldron and Talisman Qi. He nodded slightly. "Then let us choose a place and begin… refining the ingredients for your pill will be a time-consuming process. The sooner we start, the better."

He considered for a moment. "Refining such a spirit pill is best done in a suitable treasure land… I wonder if the East A-Wang Sea has such a place."

Li Ximing was an alchemist, after all. At his words, Tinglan began to ponder. He glanced at her and smiled. "How about this? Refining the spiritual ingredients is a lengthy process, but fortunately, it isn't picky about the location. I will begin the initial refinement here while you take your immortal carriage to search for a suitable place. Once I have finished with the ingredients, we can move to the treasure land for the final step of forming the pill."

Tinglan nodded slightly, thinking it was a reasonable plan, but she remained cautious. "The method is good, and it's not that I don't trust you, Daoist Friend. You can keep the Immeasurable Water and Fire here for refinement. However, the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron was borrowed from the Great Xiukui Monastery and cannot be left behind. I can lend you my Treasure Elephant Cauldron to use instead. It's a Foundation Establishment Realm-grade furnace."

With his own pill on the verge of completion, Li Ximing's real intention was to send her away. The primary ingredient of his pill was a Supreme Yin spiritual item, and since her sect was once a subordinate of the Immortal Mansion, he was afraid she might recognize something. Hearing her offer, he could only grumble inwardly.

‘Wonderful. Even a non-alchemist's cauldron is better than mine.’

Whether it was the Treasure Elephant Cauldron or the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron, both were leagues better than his own River-Heart Cauldron. He had no objections. "That's fine," he said with a smile.

Tinglan produced an earthen pot, no bigger than her palm. Its surface was smooth and engraved with many gold and white patterns. Holding it, she explained, "This Supreme Minister's Gourd is also a spiritual artifact, crafted by Martial Uncle Zimu back in the day. The Immeasurable Water and Fire within it cannot be removed or escape. Even if lost, it will find its way back from the Great Void."

The Immeasurable Water and Fire was, after all, a precious item. Her words were a subtle warning. She opened the lid, and a ball of radiant flame immediately leaped out. Hues of azure and indigo, the colors of the two primal forces, swirled together. The spiritual energy in the cave dwelling instantly withered. His nearby Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire began to hum, its flames distorting rapidly, threatening to ruin his pill.

But Li Ximing simply reached out and gently grasped it. The Immeasurable Water and Fire instantly grew docile, settling quietly in his hand, its two colors stabilizing into a multicolored sphere.

Tinglan let out a visible sigh of relief, her hand that had been tensed over the lid finally relaxing. She nodded in surprise. "Impressive skill, Daoist Friend!"

The Immeasurable Water and Fire was inherently violent, and having been bound to a spiritual artifact, it couldn't be truly refined, only borrowed. This added another layer of difficulty to controlling it. Tinglan's earlier repeated warnings were not without reason.

Seeing Li Ximing handle it with ease, she felt the endeavor was already halfway to success. Overjoyed, she took out a treasure box from her sleeve and said in a low voice, "The spiritual ingredients for the pill are all in this box. There are two portions for most of them. For the few that are exceptionally rare, if the refinement fails, please adjust the formula as you see fit."

Li Ximing scanned the contents with his spiritual sense and was left speechless. A sense of caution rose within him.

‘This thing is far too important to Purple Smoke. Success would be wonderful, but failure would be both awkward and an offense.’

The woman in autumn-yellow robes beckoned lightly, and a massive cauldron woven from gold and ivory hues appeared from her sleeve. The heads of elephants were cast on its four corners, shimmering with spiritual light. This had to be the Treasure Elephant Cauldron.

Tinglan passed the dharma artifact to him as if shedding a heavy burden, her tone becoming much livelier. She quickly said her goodbyes, took a few steps back to exit the range of the Immeasurable Water and Fire, and vanished into the Great Void.

Li Ximing observed the azure and indigo flames of the Immeasurable Water and Fire swirling in his hand, a hint of envy in his heart.

‘This spirit fire wasn't made for alchemy. Wielding something like this in a fight would make one virtually invincible. No wonder Zimu went to the trouble of binding it to a spiritual artifact. If you sever the connection while fleeing, an enemy can't just appear next to you. And for ambushes, it's even more potent…’

He could feel the raw, untamed nature of the flame, but with his Valley Wind Guide-Fire technique, controlling it was still effortless. The Supreme Minister's Gourd was an ingenious, masterfully crafted item that granted the Immeasurable Water and Fire a degree of autonomy. Even though Tinglan had left with the main spiritual artifact, what remained in his hand was not a mere magical flame, but the Immeasurable Water and Fire itself.

‘The work of Daoist Master Zimu… judging by his age, he must be quite old now. Whether he's truly missing or just in hiding, it's hard to say…’

He activated the Immeasurable Water and Fire, moved the Treasure Elephant Cauldron into place, and sent a stream of spiritual ingredients flying into it.

‘Refining the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill is a troublesome task. This will give the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire more than enough time to finish nurturing my own spirit pill!’

# Chapter 829: Unraveling Doubts

Li Ximing scanned the area for a moment, and once he was certain Tinglan had departed, he activated the Treasure Elephant Cauldron to begin refining the pills. A torrent of Immeasurable Water and Fire coiled beneath the cauldron as a host of spiritual herbs flew inside in sequence, melting one by one.

The recipe for the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill required the spiritual ingredients to be refined 18,600 times by the Immeasurable Water and Fire. This particular flame was not only the catalyst for alchemy but also an ingredient itself. He drew out a separate strand of azure-blue spiritual fire and fed it into the cauldron.

Under normal circumstances, this would have been an agonizingly tedious task. The Immeasurable Water and Fire was never meant for alchemy; much like Merging Fire, it was relentless, threatening to burn the ingredients to ash. With another portion of the flame already inside the cauldron as an ingredient, it was like dropping a hot coal into a cotton quilt.

By his own estimation, relying solely on his own efforts would allow him to complete only one or two refinement cycles per hour. The entire process would take two to four years—an immense amount of labor. This was only feasible because he had grown accustomed to arduous and repetitive alchemy from a young age. Anyone else would likely have taken much longer.

However, Li Ximing possessed the Valley Wind Guide-Fire technique, an art that could refine True Essence and granted him exceptional control over flames. As he put it to the test, he found the process surprisingly effortless, leaving him with enough spare attention to monitor the True Fire in his other cauldron.

Once the spiritual liquid in the cauldron had undergone all 18,600 refinements, he kneaded the entirety of the spiritual flames into the mixture. At the bottom of the cauldron, a hazy, grey substance began to form—the first sign of Valley Water.

Li Ximing gently nurtured it with the Immeasurable Water and Fire. When he checked the time, he was surprised to find that less than half a year had passed.

‘Alchemy methods like the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction are actually quite suitable for me.’

Meanwhile, the River-Heart Cauldron had turned a fiery, incandescent red, and waves of dense medicinal fragrance began to waft from it, signaling that the pills were about to form. Li Ximing quickly freed a hand and unleashed a brilliant glow.

*Hum!*

A small, exquisitely detailed celestial gate sprang from his palm. Adorned with dragon banners, phoenix carriages, and intricate carvings, it hovered within the cave residence, flooding the space with a blinding light. It was the physical manifestation of his divine ability, Audience with the Celestial Gate!

The moment Audience with the Celestial Gate appeared, a torrent of iridescent light from the divine ability surged forth, cascading like a waterfall. It clung to the walls of the entire cave, forming a seal that isolated all sound and fragrance from the outside world.

Li Ximing knew this pill was no small matter and had to be handled with the utmost care. He pushed his divine ability to its full power, suppressing everything in the vicinity. After a quick scan of the Great Void confirmed there were no prying eyes and that Tinglan had not returned, he finally turned his attention to the cauldron, his other hand still resting on the Treasure Elephant Cauldron.

After all, while the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire could be trusted to gently nurture a pill on its own, the Immeasurable Water and Fire possessed no such patience. He could not step away and let it finish unattended as he had before.

*Crack!*

A dense network of fissures, like a spiderweb, suddenly appeared on the side of the River-Heart Cauldron and spread rapidly up its surface. Li Ximing pressed down with his divine ability as a layer of Bright Yang spiritual qi surged forth to stabilize the vessel. A sharp, resonant clang echoed through the cave.

*BOOM!*

The cave shook as if struck by lightning. The deafening roar was followed by an explosion of silver-white radiance. Several points of light shot out from the cauldron, darting through the brilliance, but how could they possibly escape the search of a divine ability? A look of delight washed over Li Ximing’s face as he retrieved a jade box from his sleeve.

"Come!"

Instantly, the torrent of silver-white light flowed like water into the soft lining of the jade box. All fragrance and color vanished in that same moment, leaving only three pills, each the size of a longan, resting inside.

The pills were a milky white, their surfaces etched with fine, silver patterns resembling Moon Laurel leaves. Wisps of silver-white light swirled around them, twinkling like three brilliant stars in the dim cave, their light pulsing softly. It was a captivating sight.

Li Ximing dared not touch them with his hands, nor did he risk using his spiritual qi to handle them directly. Instead, he conjured a gentle breeze of spiritual energy to lift them for a careful inspection.

‘Breaks through cultivation bottlenecks, calms the spirit, nourishes the physical body with the pure essence of the cold moon, increases lifespan… and holding it in the mouth grants the protection of a strand of Supreme Yin energy…’

Li Ximing didn't follow rigid pill recipes. Unlike ordinary pills, whose effects were known before they were even crafted, the properties of this fortuitous pill could only be deduced from its fragrance and the sensations he experienced during its creation.

‘The bottleneck-breaking effect of this pill is decent, but unremarkable for my Bright Yang cultivation. Still, it is a spirit pill of the Purple Mansion Realm. As for nourishing the body with the pure essence of the cold moon… it's useless for my Bright Yang physique.’

‘The increase to one's lifespan, however, is exceptionally rare. It has the faint aura of a fate-aspected pill—the first of its kind I've seen in this life. The final protective effect is something I can't quite decipher yet.’

‘Regardless, it is superior to any other pill I have refined in my entire life. Perhaps the completed Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill might compare, but next to this, all others are but common trifles.’

He admired his creation with satisfaction. The bottleneck-breaking and lifespan-increasing properties alone were enough for him to treasure it immensely. A smile spread across his face.

"If the Xi family of the Chunyi Dao Gate, who cultivate the path of Supreme Yin, knew I possessed this spirit pill, wouldn't their eyes pop out of their heads? Nourishing the body with the pure essence of the cold moon and a mouthful of Supreme Yin energy… the Xi family would probably weep with joy."

‘With a sacred medicine of the Supreme Yin affinity in my possession, the Chunyi Dao Gate… I must find a way to contact them.’

Li Ximing had access to a virtually inexhaustible supply of Supreme Yin moonlight essence. Even with some losses during refinement, crafting spirit pills of the Supreme Yin affinity was a simple matter for him. He closed the lid of the jade box, and the cool, serene light vanished, plunging the cave back into darkness, illuminated only by the flickering colors of the Immeasurable Water and Fire.

His expression grew serious as he surveyed the cave, his mind racing with caution.

‘Having refined a sacred medicine of the Supreme Yin dao, a celestial phenomenon should have manifested, altering the spiritual aura of this area. Although I've used my divine ability to suppress and seal it, that aura doesn't just disappear. The moment I release the seal, I can't have Moon Laurel flowers suddenly blooming over the ocean. That would be impossible to explain away.’

Even in the desolate outer seas, Li Ximing remained ever-vigilant of watchful eyes. He rummaged through his storage bag and retrieved a luminous white flower.

This was a Suncrest Flower, a spiritual item of the Supreme Yang Dao he had received as a gift upon reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. It wasn't particularly valuable, but it was rare. A brilliant light flared between his brows, and as a purple flame erupted, the solar spiritual item dissolved into motes of light and vanished.

"That should be enough to obscure the phenomenon."

With that, he released his divine ability. Outside, the moon was bright and the stars were sparse, but there were no other unusual signs.

He sealed the cave once more with his divine ability and cast a pained glance at the heavily cracked River-Heart Cauldron, muttering to himself.

"This thing is useless now. It's more sentimental than practical. Repairing it would mean recasting it entirely, and it just wouldn't be the same."

He put it away. With one hand maintaining control over the fire, he took out the Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass and began to read. Three months passed before he finally sensed a faint disturbance outside the cave. A closer look confirmed it was Tinglan. Not wanting to disturb him, she was waiting patiently outside.

Li Ximing, guessing that the time was right, sent a message for her to enter. A few dozen breaths later, she appeared inside the cave, having carefully navigated her way through the earth with an escape technique.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing?"

Li Ximing smiled and nodded in greeting. "The refinement is complete!"

Tinglan had expected she might be needed to lend a hand and was slightly taken aback by his words. She thought to herself with a hint of shock:

‘It seems I've underestimated this Daoist Master Zhaojing… He just broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, yet his skill in alchemy seems poised to surpass even that of old Daoist Master Sumian. Truly remarkable. Then again… how could the first Daoist Master to rise under the watch of the Immortal Clan be anything ordinary?’

‘Sumian is from the Comprehending Profundity lineage, and he’s an old man who appears warm on the surface but is cold-blooded to the core—he cannot be trusted. Hengxing is far too calculating, and I cannot afford to be indebted to her. Tianhuo is too playful; a task that should take a year, she would drag out for five. Old Daoist Master Shen Yuming is getting on in years. Li Ximing, on the other hand, has protected Profound Peak time and again. He is clearly a man who honors his word—loyal and sincere. If I need pills refined in secret in the future, his help will be indispensable.’

‘It's just a shame he follows the Bright Yang path… who knows what he will become in the future. I still have that information about the Life Divine Ability. I wonder if it’s the right time to tell him.’

Composing herself, she studied him for a moment and smiled. "Daoist friend, you are a true saint of alchemy. I have underestimated you time and again. My sincerest apologies!"

"Not at all!"

With a gentle wave of his hand, the Treasure Elephant Cauldron, which had been resting over the fire, shrank until it was the size of a small incense burner. He held it in his hand and said with a smile, "Please!"

The two of them departed the cave. Tinglan summoned a purple cloud carriage, and the rabbit Demon pulled back the curtain, inviting him to board.

Li Ximing, slightly surprised, took a seat inside the celestial carriage. The interior was quite plain and simple. An incense burner in the center held two smoldering pieces of golden, soft incense. Holding the Treasure Elephant Cauldron, Li Ximing remained perfectly composed.

Tinglan remained silent for a moment, gathering her thoughts before she spoke. "A few years ago, I sought out Yehui. He was cultivating in the Southern Sea. I asked him about a certain matter, which I later confirmed with Zhu Gong. It concerns Kong Haiying."

"Back then, the person who entered seclusion at the Profound Peak mountain gate to attempt a breakthrough was, without a doubt, Kong Haiying."

Li Ximing froze. He had personally verified it at the time; the aura from within the sealed cave was that of Fu En. He couldn't help but fall into deep thought. Tinglan continued.

"I… went to see Kong Guxi. They had misidentified the soul lamps of Fu En and Kong Haiying. Kong Haiying's seclusion was far longer than any of us realized. The person who made several appearances to meet with the Kong Clan juniors was actually Fu En in disguise. And the artifact that Fu En blood-refined… it belonged to Kong Haiying."

Li Ximing’s expression grew grim. Tinglan pressed on. "It is no surprise that you were mistaken, Daoist Friend Zhaojing, because the information they had was wrong. The only elder present who had actually met Kong Haiying was Kong Guli, but his memory was erased. The other elders had all perished over the years. Senior Changxi overlooked only one old man named Kong Yu. Fortunately for the plan, he took his own life on the spot."

Her words were laced with a chilling coldness, her eyes betraying a deep shock. "Senior Changxi made these arrangements long ago, swapping their identities. Perhaps it was to prepare a scapegoat. Perhaps. After all, Kong Haiying had once been to Encompassing Profoundity."

Her words were intentionally vague, but Li Ximing silently understood the unspoken implications.

Yehui had met Kong Haiying in person. What good would a substitute be? Yehui would have seen through it immediately. That left only one terrifying possibility.

Daoist Master Changxi had coldly delivered Kong Haiying directly into Yehui's hands. He had even been kind enough to help Yehui and Li Ximing maintain the illusion that the victim was Fu En.

Though Li Ximing was not as adept at such schemes, the truth was now laid bare before him, and he was not so naive as to miss it.

‘After Changxi's death, Yehui was bound to bring his blade down on the Kong Clan. Kong Haiying had to die. His death wasn't just about the blood feud for killing his wife and exterminating his clan; it was also tied to the secrets of the Encompassing Profoundity lineage. If he remained alive, any power that took in the Kong Clan would live in unease, unwilling to offend Yehui.’

‘Only with Kong Haiying's death would Yehui be willing to sheathe his blade and reconsider whether continued persecution of the Kong Clan was worth the effort. Yehui's attitude toward me improved so dramatically back then because he believed I had made a concession. This was the reason!’

‘Changxi’s choice was cold and calculated from the very beginning. Kong Haiying was right there, in seclusion at the Profound Peak mountain gate. If he could achieve his breakthrough in the window of time that Changxi's death had bought, then all would be well. If not, he would become Changxi’s peace offering to Yehui.’

‘The identity swap was likely a casual contingency at first, a move to give Profound Peak flexibility and to confuse outsiders, lowering their guard concerning Kong Haiying. Changxi never anticipated that Kong Haiying would fail to overcome his inner demons, that he would remain trapped for so long and ultimately betray his hopes.’

‘Later, when that tactic had outlived its primary purpose, it was repurposed to strengthen my conviction—after all, from my perspective, it was Fu En who had died, while Kong Haiying was still somewhere out there, with a great chance of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm.’

‘No wonder I felt that cultivator's foundation was so profound at the time, not at all like a guest elder such as Fu En. It was Kong Haiying himself!’

‘So, in the end, the elusive Kong Haiying, whose whereabouts were a mystery, was personally delivered by my own hands to his execution.’

A chilling shock gripped Li Ximing's heart, leaving him speechless for a long while. He finally let out a deep, heavy sigh. "Daoist Master Changxi… regardless of the extent of his powers, everything he did after his death—be it cruel, cold, manipulative, or deceitful—was for the preservation of his clan. He can face his ancestors without an ounce of shame."

Tinglan could see that he had pieced together the entire sequence of events. She spoke in a low, haunting voice. "As for what he felt for Kong Haiying and Kong Yu, whether he wept in sorrow or burned with guilt, only the senior himself knew in his heart. Did Kong Haiying know what was happening during his seclusion? Did he silently consent? His failure to overcome his inner demons… is it possible Senior Changxi had a hand in that as well?"

Her question sent a fresh wave of ice through Li Ximing's veins. He answered in a low voice, "Daoist Master Changxi… though he manipulated me a great deal, he also taught me much. Ultimately, he is worthy of respect."

Tinglan’s gaze was fixed on the space before them. Two faint, autumn-yellow lines lit up at the corners of her eyes. She rested her chin on her hand, her eyes looking out the window as she spoke softly. "He is indeed worthy of respect. After all, those in the Purple Mansion Realm who have not yet cultivated a Life Divine Ability often have many attachments to the mortal world. Once a Life Divine Ability is achieved, especially one of the Earth Virtue, they slowly let everything go. Sect, clan… they become mere tools. Lineage, master, and disciple… they become mere rungs on the ladder to immortality."

"Certain paths of the Purple Mansion Realm… their cultivators are either single-mindedly focused on attaining immortality or become uncontrollably violent and tyrannical. The only word to describe them is 'fearsome'—Daoist Friend Zhaojing, World's Radiance is not a divine ability with a good reputation."

The woman’s voice echoed within the celestial carriage. The incense burner in the center released a cool, crisp fragrance, the same scent that lingered about her, evoking the feeling of an autumn wind sweeping through a rice field. Suddenly, Tinglan’s mask of clever pleasantries fell away, revealing a flicker of genuine worry.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, you broke through your state of ignorance in a mere few years and then shattered the chains of limitless illusion. That is an incredible feat. But that is the karma of one who compromises and endures. To see into another's heart is to confront your own inner demons; the two are entirely different. Before the Grand Ancestor of Wei attained the Dao, the path of Bright Yang was not always so 'bright.' Traces of the Qilin and Cicada still remain to this day. Are you truly confident that you can grasp a Life Divine Ability?"



# Chapter 830: The Hundred-Day Pill

Li Ximing held her gaze for several seconds, a thought suddenly flashing through his mind.

'What does she mean by this? Could it be that Purple Smoke has a lead on World's Radiance, but she's hesitant to offer it?'

When the Dongli Sect's Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven collapsed, countless Bright Yang Dao traditions were scattered to the winds, claimed by the various families of the Azure Pine region. The Li family had yet to rise at the time and had only managed to acquire a copy of the Intercalary Sun Art through Tu Longjian, a technique that had benefited them to this day.

Both Yufu Prefecture and Mount Dongli lay on the border between the territories of the Purple Smoke and Azure Pond families. It stood to reason that those two had acquired far more from the fallout. The possibility that Purple Smoke had obtained a trace of the Life Divine Ability known as World's Radiance was extremely high, and the thought made his heart pound.

Yet, it was not in Li Ximing's nature to make bold, confident promises. He mulled it over before speaking.

"The divine abilities of each tradition are unique. Whether one can master them depends on one's disposition and the nature of the tradition itself. I have never read the cultivation method, so I cannot say for certain. World's Radiance is its ancient name; this Life Divine Ability is also called Luminous Heart. It was revised over the years by the emperors of Wei, the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate, and the Dongli Sect. I imagine there must be a path within it to cultivate an open and honorable heart."

Tinglan looked away, seemingly having anticipated his cautious response. "It has indeed been greatly improved," she said quietly. "The Cui Clan cultivated themselves through rites, which led to the rise of Dongli. My Purple Smoke was not prosperous back then, but we had some connection to them. The cultivation method for this Life Divine Ability has always been locked away. One can only seek this path after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm; one is not permitted to use this path *to* achieve the Purple Mansion Realm."

A strained smile appeared on her face, as if the words were difficult to say. "This Dao tradition… my Purple Smoke is quite familiar with it. If Zhaojing is interested in the World's Radiance tradition, after you achieve your second divine ability… you may visit the Purple Smoke blessed land."

'So she really does have news of the Life Divine Ability!'

Li Ximing nodded slowly. Though puzzled by the hesitation and bitterness in her tone, he kept his expression calm while his heart filled with light.

He had already made some progress with Audience with the Celestial Gate. Once he consumed the pill refined from the Supreme Yin, his cultivation speed would soar. The spiritual medicine also had the effect of breaking through bottlenecks, putting the Body Divine Ability, Sovereign's Perilous Tread, within his grasp.

If Purple Smoke was willing to provide World's Radiance, then as soon as he mastered Sovereign's Perilous Tread, Li Ximing would possess the two most essential arts of the orthodox Bright Yang path—one for the body and one for life. Once accomplished, combined with Audience with the Celestial Gate, he would instantly leap into the upper echelon of the Purple Mansion Realm!

Cultivators of other traditions were not so fortunate. Between the Cui family and the Dongli Sect, the path had been practically laid bare for him. His greatest worry had been the matter of his Life Divine Ability, and now an unexpected clue had fallen into his lap. How could he not feel his spirit brighten with joy?

'The Purple Mystery is difficult to cross, and I have no other desires. In this life, to wield divine abilities, to cultivate my body and command my fate—this journey will not have been in vain.'

Even the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill in his hand now seemed more precious. The carriage soon came to a halt. A rabbit Demon robed in purple came forward to welcome them. The two alighted from the immortal carriage to the sight of a boiling sea and vast stretches of white sand. On the island, the mountain range billowed with thick smoke.

Li Ximing’s Profound Light swept across the island from between his brows, revealing a complex web of interwoven fire and water veins. The entire island was a landscape of either molten lava or hot springs—a peculiar place indeed. It appeared to be occupied by a demonic sect; black-robed disciples hurried to and fro. Li Ximing and Tinglan ignored them completely. He gave a subtle nod of approval.

"Finding a suitable place for alchemy on short notice was quite the challenge," Tinglan said with a smile. "I surveyed all the nearby seas, and only this one met the requirements."

She turned her palm upward in a gesture of invitation. Li Ximing accepted and walked ahead. As they proceeded towards the mountain at the island's heart, they saw a grim, blood-soaked formation. It was only at the Qi Refining level, but it covered a massive area, which was impressive enough.

This was the outer sea, at the very edge of the East A-Wang Sea. To construct such an array here, the sect must be a well-known demonic power in the local area.

Of course, for the two of them, the formation was non-existent. With a mere step through the Great Void, they passed through it, unseen and unheard. They materialized inside a lavish assembly hall where two guards, radiating demonic energy, stood sentry at the entrance.

Despite the two brilliant Daoist Masters appearing before them, the late-stage Qi Refining guards remained as if blind, seeing nothing at all. Li Ximing and Tinglan strolled leisurely into the hall, where a heated argument was already underway.

"We finally caught someone from the Han Family! On Changdu Island! He's trapped by the grand array!"

"We should attack in full force now and wipe out the Han Family!"

An insidious voice immediately cut in, cursing, "That Han Li is cautious and cunning! How many times has he escaped since Han Shihai died? We must go to the island together and annihilate him!"

"Nonsense! He's just a petty Qi Refining cultivator! Why should we care!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow at the exchange. Tinglan, however, had no interest in the grudges of these small-fry cultivators. "Let me handle this," she said casually.

She lifted her sleeve and pushed the great doors open with a creak. Inside, a hulking man sat sprawled on a throne of black and white bones. Li Ximing didn't bother to get a closer look. Tinglan simply pursed her lips and blew gently, as if extinguishing a candle.

*Whoosh…*

A purple wind swept through the hall. The domineering island master on his throne and the imposing guards at his side all seemed to be illusions. They crumbled like sand and scattered into nothingness. Their black-scaled armor and gleaming weapons were instantly sliced into neat, fingernail-sized discs that clattered across the floor.

Yet, the candlelight in the hall remained perfectly still, its gentle glow illuminating the now-empty seats.

In a single instant, the bustling chamber fell utterly silent, devoid of any living soul.

It was impossible to know how many Foundation Establishment Realm and Qi Refining cultivators had been extinguished in that single breath. As casually as if she were brushing dust from her clothes, Tinglan remarked, "A pity they aren't from the righteous path. Otherwise, a few could have been left alive to run errands."

She stamped her foot lightly. The entire hall shook violently, and a circular vent opened in the center of the floor, spewing forth a torrent of Baleful Fire Qi. Li Ximing simultaneously activated Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, stabilizing the mountain’s earth veins. Tinglan turned to the rabbit Demon and instructed, "Ze Gui, clean this up. Don't disturb the Daoist Master."

Ze Gui bowed respectfully and withdrew. Li Ximing glanced at the shadows near the entrance; the two guards remained at their posts, completely oblivious.

'The profundity of Purple Smoke's Dao arts is truly remarkable, and Tinglan's cultivation is deep…'

He knew that whatever she had just done was not a divine ability. The purple qi exhibited no control over fire or earth veins, nor did it possess any illusory properties. Her actions, from start to finish, were the product of spell arts, not a divine ability.

Releasing his own power, Li Ximing summoned the Treasure Elephant Cauldron. It swelled like an inflating balloon and settled with a boom over the vent of Baleful Fire Qi. The Immeasurable Water and Fire surged forth once more. Tinglan, meanwhile, beckoned lightly, and a small cauldron appeared in her palm.

The cauldron was purple on top and black on the bottom. The black was not the usual bronze of an alchemy vessel but a dark, fabric-like grey, and it was adorned with images of birds like crows and owls. It was a rare five-legged cauldron.

'The Purple Mansion Realm spiritual artifact, the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron.'

The value of such a spiritual cauldron went without saying. Purple Mansion Realm spiritual artifacts were already exceptionally rare, let alone one designed for alchemy. Li Ximing placed his hands upon it, and a profound sensation arose within him.

"A fine spiritual artifact…" he murmured in appreciation.

But his expression quickly froze.

Under the probe of his spiritual sense, two imposing, ancient seal characters materialized on the bottom of the cauldron: *Cultivation Transcendence*.

'The Great Xiukui Monastery has some nerve… Perhaps it was a gift from Yue Cultivating Sect. Surely they wouldn't have stolen it from the north… True Monarch Taiyue is a renowned, living True Monarch.'

Tinglan seemed not to notice his reaction. She solemnly took out a turquoise jade box and opened it.

Inside, it was filled with a pale white spiritual liquid from which a wave of potent spiritual energy washed over them. Submerged within was a walnut-sized, pure white object. It seemed both liquid and solid, tumbling about with a life of its own, occasionally poking its head above the surface as if observing the world.

Li Ximing’s eyes blazed.

'Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness!'

This was the core ingredient for the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill, the extremely rare Purple Mansion Realm spirit water itself!

Among all the spiritual treasures of the Purple Mansion Realm, the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness was in a class of its own. This was because it possessed the miraculous ability to purify one's Dao foundation and correct a flawed cultivation path!

In the journey of cultivation, the techniques one practiced and the qi one absorbed created a chasm-like difference in future potential. For rogue cultivators who had no choice but to absorb impure qi, their futures were all but sealed. It was for this reason that nine out of ten tales told in the common marketplaces featured this spirit water. Whether the hero was gravely injured and received it as a gift from a beautiful maiden or seized it from an enemy, a single draught would heal his wounds and grant him a complete rebirth, setting him on a path to greatness.

Such stories were ubiquitous. From the scions of Purple Mansion Realm clans down to wandering Embyronic Breathing cultivators, everyone knew of its fame. This was the first time anyone from the Li family had ever laid eyes on it.

The item was clearly precious to Tinglan as well. She held it with extreme care. "Purple Mansion spirit water, the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness, preserved in the Water Mansion's White Partridge Origin Spring. Daoist Friend Zhaojing, please!"

She even specified the water used to preserve it, clearly worried that it might affect his alchemy. As what came next involved the secrets of his own tradition, it was improper for her to watch. She immediately withdrew, closing the hall's great doors behind her and taking a seat cross-legged outside.

With a thought from Li Ximing, the Immeasurable Water and Fire parted. The jade box shot into the opening, and the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness plunged out of its preserving water and into the cauldron.

*BOOM!*

The sound of a roaring flood filled the air, like crashing waves on a stormy sea. The Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness was Valley Water, and the cauldron was its valley. It was a spirit water perfectly suited for alchemy, and as Li Ximing began the refinement, the process felt smooth and natural. He enveloped the essence with a refined medicinal liquid, slapped the side of the cauldron, and in a single breath, the alchemical aroma shifted several times as the Immeasurable Water and Fire boiled furiously.

A full one hundred days passed. Under Tinglan's anxious gaze, heavy rain clouds gathered in the sky. They hung dark and low but refused to release their rain, casting a humid, stuffy pall over the entire island. The once-dry sand quickly grew damp, threatening to turn to mud.

*BOOM!*

Muffled thunder rumbled from within the clouds, a sound without light. Tinglan looked up at the sky, a hint of joy on her face as she counted the days.

"A pill forged in a hundred days," she nodded. "That's a good omen."

*Creeak…*

The doors to the great hall slowly opened a crack. She looked up to see a thick, white vapor pouring out, cascading down the steps like a waterfall. It carried no fragrance, yet wherever it passed, grass sprouted, and insects began to chirp, creating a scene of vibrant life.

A Daoist Master in white and gold robes stepped out, a smile on his face. He looked up and made a congratulatory gesture.

"Congratulations, Tinglan!"

The woman’s eyes sparkled. Li Ximing beamed.

"The Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron is a truly magnificent treasure! With its assistance, and with heaven, earth, and man all aligned, I managed to produce four pills!"

"Excellent!"

In the Dao of alchemy, a single batch at the Embyronic Breathing stage could yield a dozen pills. At Qi Refining, the number usually dropped to below ten, and by the Foundation Establishment Realm, it was typically between six and nine. At the Purple Mansion Realm, a yield of three or four spirit pills was already considered a fine result. Li Ximing had originally promised three or fewer, which was why Tinglan had so readily agreed.

To have two extra pills—nearly double the expected amount—how could Tinglan not be surprised and overjoyed? "Zhaojing is truly a master of the Dao of Alchemy!" she exclaimed. "Even Senior Xiao would likely produce the same number! Truly… a talent that astounds the world!"

Tinglan’s words were sincere. Li Ximing was not yet a hundred years old, yet his skill was comparable to that of an old master who had dedicated centuries to the craft. How could he not be described as astoundingly talented?

But Xiao Chuting was no ordinary figure. Though both were progenitors of an Immortal Clan's divine abilities, Li Ximing knew the vast gap between them. Setting all else aside, when Li Ximing broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, he had faced Changxiao. When Xiao Chuting had his trial, he faced the Daoist Master Tianyuan of the Golden Feather Sect! In the end, the Man on Creek had emerged completely unscathed, and not a single direct descendant of the Xiao family had fallen.

Li Ximing dared not compare himself to such a figure. "Daoist Friend, you exaggerate," he said seriously. "If Senior Xiao were here, he would have refined at least six pills."

Tinglan was filled with joy and cared little whether it was four pills or six. She watched as Li Ximing shook his sleeve, producing a jade box. He opened it gently to reveal four pure white pills, each with shimmering golden veins.

"Wonderful, wonderful…" she murmured.

Li Ximing smiled. "I refined these pills, so I know them well. As they are pills of Valley Water, they must always be kept in a container. Exposure to the world will diminish their properties, and exposure to the Great Void will annihilate them instantly. You must store them with care."

"Thank you for the reminder, Zhaojing!"

Tinglan may well have known this already, but she accepted his advice graciously. When she saw Li Ximing produce the golden Treasure Elephant Cauldron to return it, she quickly waved her hands.

"I cannot accept this. That you refined four pills is already beyond my wildest expectations. I should be the one thanking you. Please, accept the Treasure Elephant Cauldron as a return gift!"

"Oh?"

For a moment, Li Ximing was genuinely tempted. He didn't have an alchemy cauldron of his own, and while the Treasure Elephant Cauldron wasn't an ancient artifact, it was a top-tier dharma artifact and felt comfortable to use. Such a cauldron was invaluable, but its worth couldn't compare to two Purple Mansion Realm spirit pills. Accepting it wouldn't be excessive. As he hesitated, Tinglan smiled.

"I obtained the Treasure Elephant Cauldron from the Thundercloud Monastery's grotto-heaven. I don't possess my master's great skill; he acquired both a spiritual artifact and a thunderstone, while I only managed to get some Dao traditions and dharma artifacts."

"This cauldron was forged after the monastery sealed its grotto-heaven, so it's not an ancient artifact, but its body is excellent. It was made with the True Fire dao's Trueflame Goldstone and the Supreme Yang dao's Cloudgaze Cursive Liquid."

Although both materials were of the Foundation Establishment Realm level, they were rare treasures even back then. Now, even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators rarely possessed them. After a few polite refusals, Li Ximing accepted the cauldron, holding it with clear admiration.

He returned the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron to Tinglan, who then used her Supreme Minister's Gourd to collect the Immeasurable Water and Fire. Once they were seated, Tinglan smiled at him, placed the jade box on the table, and began to explain.

"The Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill, refined from the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness. In ancient times, it could bring the dead back to life and regrow flesh on bones. Now that souls dissipate first, the pill can no longer save them, but it has no problem healing the Dharma Body of a Purple Mansion cultivator and extending their lifespan."

"It can also resolve calamities of fire, heal injuries from golden gales, and purge impurities from one's immortal foundation, elevating one's Dao. It must never touch the ground; it will dissolve on contact with earth."

"The pill also has some minor uses that you probably won't need. It can resolve fertility issues for Purple Mansion cultivators, alleviate the weakness after childbirth, and accelerate the gestation of a divine ability after absorbing another's immortal foundation."

She smiled faintly. "The part about purging impurities sounds tempting, but it's not as powerful as consuming a whole Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness. In my Purple Smoke, we typically use the pill like this…"

"For instance, if someone reached Foundation Establishment Realm with a third-grade technique and later switched to a compatible fourth-grade technique, they would take this pill when breaking through to the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. It would not only expand their cultivation and solidify their foundation but also refine their immortal foundation."

Li Ximing had the recipe, but the pill's history, origins, and the extensive records of its effects were clearly known only to Tinglan's lineage. Her detailed explanation was related to an unspoken rule in alchemy.

When an alchemist succeeds, they typically estimate a yield. If they produce more than expected, the extra pills are often not mentioned and are silently kept as their fee. Although Li Ximing had presented four pills, Tinglan did not believe for a moment that he had only managed to make four.

Her being so clear was a gesture of goodwill. He had promised three or fewer but delivered four, which was no small matter.

'He probably made five,' Tinglan thought. 'He must know how precious the pills are, so he didn't take much for himself.'

This act not only gave Purple Smoke ample face but also demonstrated his restrained character. It was why she had gifted him the Treasure Elephant Cauldron as a sign of her gratitude.

Li Ximing simply smiled and nodded.

'The Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron is truly incredible,' he thought to himself. 'And my control over the Immeasurable Water and Fire is simple enough. This batch produced a full six pills…'

At least one of those pills was thanks to the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron, and another was the result of favorable conditions and a bit of luck. He had discreetly kept two for himself, primarily to foster good relations with Purple Smoke.

The reason was simple: it was a Supreme Yang Dao tradition, and his own Life Divine Ability was still in their hands…

'Besides, if Tinglan profits greatly this time, she'll have to come to me for alchemy again. After a few more times, my own stores will be full.'

He was quite fond of the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill. His junior, Li Minggong, had a slightly inferior immortal foundation. With this pill, he might be able to open up new paths for her.

With their business concluded, Tinglan considered for a moment, then her expression turned serious.

"There is something I must tell you, Zhaojing…"

Li Ximing raised his eyebrows.

"This matter is important, but not urgent," Tinglan continued. "It was another reason for my visit. I didn't want to affect your alchemy, so I didn't mention it before. Now that the pills are made, I should tell you."

She stated solemnly, "True Monarch is about to reincarnate in Jiangbei for his cultivation. There is just over a year left until it happens."

"What?!"

Li Ximing was stunned into silence, his face a picture of shock. Tinglan quickly explained, trying to placate him.

"The matter is significant, but thankfully it is in Jiangbei, not Jiangnan. His path will also take him north, so it has little to do with us here. However, your clan once had a presence in Jiangbei, so you should be aware."

A sense of unease settled over Li Ximing. He shook his head anxiously. "Sigh… It hasn't been that long. How could we run into this sort of thing again?"

Hearing this, Tinglan grew thoughtful. "Daoist Friend, surely you aren't planning to return to the mainland? I'm afraid it won't be convenient… and even if you went back, it wouldn't help much. You would just attract unwanted attention. Luoxia is still respectful toward Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. They generally won't cause a Purple Mansion cultivator to lose face. As long as you don't court death yourself, at most one or two of your clan's direct descendants might get dragged in. It won't escalate to an existential crisis."

She sighed softly. "After all… Luoxia has to consider our feelings. If a Purple Mansion Realm clan were wiped out because of this, future reincarnations would become difficult. It wouldn't look good to stir up resentment among cultivators and mortals."

"I asked Yehui; he doesn't seem to be planning to go back either. That Li Jiangqian is a capable person, so there's no need to worry."

Clearly, with a True Monarch involved, Yehui wanted nothing more to do with the Capital immortals Dao. Li Ximing, however, was from an Immortal Clan and, among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, placed an exceptionally high value on his family. Tinglan understood this and had deliberately waited until after the alchemy was complete to tell him, fearing he would act rashly and jeopardize her pills. Hearing her words, Li Ximing mulled it over.

"I just hope that he is sensible and maintains contact."

"He wouldn't dare be anything but sensible." A smile touched Tinglan's lips, as if she had recalled something amusing. "They are far more afraid than your clan is. A True Monarch's reincarnation needs antagonists. The Capital immortals Dao has demonic origins, a very sensitive identity. Clans like yours, which have presented themselves as righteous for generations… in the stories, you're usually on the side with the beautiful maiden. The young mistress might be headstrong at first, but she'll eventually fall for him. You might even gain some benefits."

Li Ximing sighed and shook his head. "I've read more of those stories than you have, Daoist Friend. There's another kind, where the protagonist is righteous and discerning, and my 'righteous' clan is exposed as ugly and corrupt. Meanwhile, the demonic sect's maiden is seen as genuine and lovable. No clan's history is perfectly clean. If someone wants to dig up dirt, they'll find it. It's best not to get involved at all. The potential benefits aren't worth the risk."

Tinglan chuckled. "You see things clearly… That's true… And that Moongaze Lake…"

"Hey!"

Li Ximing dared not let her continue. A True Monarch's powers were vast; who knew if he might draw inspiration from their conversation? If things really played out that way, Yehui would laugh his head off. He hesitated for a moment, then began to write a letter.

'Even though the younger generation at home is clever, who's to say one of them won't be influenced by fate? Li Jiangqian has a Talisman Seed in him, but I should still write a letter by hand to ensure that power in the clan remains in the hands of my grand-uncle and Li Jiangqian.'



# Chapter 831: Cold

Moongaze Lake was a far cry from its usual tranquility. A joyous, festive atmosphere pulsed through the air as the island's many halls were draped in crimson. Figures of great importance within the clan moved back and forth, signaling an event of grand celebration.

Dressed in red robes, Li Zhouming stood in the main hall, a proud and contented look on his face. Beside him, in a great jade chair, sat an old man in dark red robes, his white hair a stark contrast to his smiling face.

"Father... I've made you proud this time, haven't I?"

Li Zhouming's mother had passed away long ago, leaving only his father to witness this day. Li Chengzhi, who had already lost most of his teeth to age, merely shot his son a look.

"This marriage was arranged by your grandfather. What's there to be proud of?"

Despite his words, Li Chengzhi couldn't hide the pride in his heart. Seeing his son marry a powerful Foundation Establishment cultivator, a direct descendant of an immortal sect, was a source of deep satisfaction. The smile was plain on his face as he watched his son go to welcome the bride. He downed two more cups of wine, his face flushing with the heat.

Li Chengzhi was well-regarded in the clan, and as a member of the direct Purple Mansion Realm lineage, he commanded respect. Furthermore, Li Zhouming was a direct descendant of the main branch. The combination of these statuses made his wedding even more magnificent than that of the Clan Head. Every notable figure on the lake had come to attend.

The old man raised his eyes for a moment, scanning the crowd. He figured his own father, Li Ximing, wouldn't be coming. He settled back into his chair, unbothered. He was used to it.

Ever since he was deemed unable to cultivate at the age of six, his father had cast him from his thoughts. If he had possessed even a single spiritual aperture, no matter how poor his talent, he might have learned a trade. But as a mortal, he was confined to the foot of the mountain. The clan's rules had been even stricter then. To put it bluntly, Li Chengzhi considered himself a man who had suffered. The bitterness and hardship he'd endured were no less than what his cultivating brothers had faced.

Because of this, he’d never felt much connection to the clan's order or its legacy. It wasn't until Li Zhouming was born that something truly changed within him. He might offer a little help to his other children, direct or otherwise, but he didn't obsess over their fortunes. Only Li Zhouming was different. For him, he had swallowed his pride and begged Li Ximing, desperate to arrange the best possible future for his son. As for his other children who had been sent away, he no longer had the heart to manage their affairs.

From that day forward, Li Chengzhi stopped judging his father so harshly. He had, after all, become the same kind of man himself. With that realization, everything was forgiven. Li Chengzhi had to admit, he had just drawn a line of validation through a lifetime of his own pain.

The sound of gongs and drums filled the hall as the newlyweds entered amidst a chorus of congratulations. Seated in the seat of honor, the old man drank the wine his new daughter-in-law offered him. In that moment, he could no longer concern himself with who was right or wrong, nor could he distinguish between truths and falsehoods. Seeing Li Zhouming in his brilliant red robes, a searing heat coursed through him. His eyes reddened, and only one thought surfaced.

"Just be good to each other. That's all that matters. It's just a shame... I probably won't live long enough to see your children."

Though Li Zhouming could be playful, he was a good person at heart and easily moved. He couldn't bear to hear such words, and on this day of great joy, he nearly broke down in tears, letting out a few choked sounds.

The torrent of rituals and the press of the crowd swept away his sorrow, and soon he was swept away to the next location, his cheerful mood restored.

Once Li Zhouming left, the hall fell silent. The boisterous crowd had moved on, and a cold wind began to blow through the grand space. The jade chair beneath him felt icy and sharp. With the effects of the wine now fading, Li Chengzhi felt a deep chill seep into his bones.

'These jade chairs are made for cultivators, after all,' he thought. 'So terribly cold…'

## The Main Hall of the Continent

Figures hurried through the great hall. An old man dressed in black ascended several flights of stairs, finally arriving in the spacious chamber. He knelt and bowed respectfully.

"Reporting to the Clan Head," he said. "Both Midong and Brahma Cloud Cave are searching for the token. The Brahma Cloud Cave has even sent a direct disciple from the Chengyun Gate to personally oversee the matter. The whole Sanxi region is in an uproar; they're making quite a scene."

Above him, Li Jiangqian sat with his eyes closed, pinching his fingers together in a meditative gesture. Wisps of Li Fire trickled from his lips as if he were practicing a technique. Hearing the report, he opened his eyes.

"Good," he said.

The Baijiang Creek in the Sanxi region of Jiangbei was divided among three powers. Besides the Li Clan's Funan and the Capital immortals Dao's Midong, the remaining territory belonged to the Brahma Cloud Cave, a vassal of the Chengyun Gate. The arrival of a direct disciple was certainly not about finding some token; it was a clear signal that the Chengyun Gate tacitly supported the arrangement.

This was undoubtedly excellent news. Without the approval of a Purple Mansion Realm power, Li Jiangqian had felt a persistent lack of confidence.

As for why the old man only mentioned Midong and Brahma Cloud Cave searching for the token—omitting the Li Clan's Funan—it was because Funan was sparsely populated. The cultivators sent there were subject to term assessments and had no opportunity to abandon their posts for a treasure hunt. Whether the various forces under the Li Clan's governance were making a move was a matter for Qingdu and Yuting.

Li Jiangqian considered for a moment. He felt the time was ripe. There was only one year and five months left until the sixth month of the twenty-second year of Shenxuan's reign.

"Have you... received any news from Midong?" he asked in a low voice.

Qu Bushi was currently responsible for communicating with the Capital immortals Dao. The old man was flexible and knew how to think on his feet. He had also met Guan Gongxiao before and knew some of the inside details.

"I received a verbal message this morning," Qu Bushi replied. "They said the candidates have been chosen, but the token's whereabouts are still unknown. Lord Guan Gongxiao mentioned... that if he were to 'find' it himself, it probably wouldn't look authentic."

"As for the candidates, Lord Guan first selected a Daoist from the Southern Sea. He cultivates on a mountain there and is skilled in using venomous creatures and fierce beasts. He cultivates the 'Locust Shade Ghost' technique and goes by the Daoist name Bai. The other is a cultivator from the Northern Sea who cultivates the Bound Earth dao. His foundation is unknown, but his surname is Huang."

Guan Gongxiao had specified the two candidates for two reasons. First, to ask if there were any issues with his choices. Second, to inform the Li Clan, preventing them from accidentally making contact with the chosen individuals and ruining the plan.

As for Guan Gongxiao finding the token himself, it simply meant the Capital immortals Dao would forge one. However, their tradition was not known for artifact refinement, so any creation of theirs would lack authenticity and would be difficult to pass off.

Li Jiangqian thought it over. "Go back and tell fellow Daoist Guan this: however many candidates they have, they should find a way to invite them over. Once they are established in the area, a token will naturally appear for them. If not, we will consider other options."

He paused, adding, "But the Three Rivers region needs to be thrown into chaos. It's too stable right now, which doesn't suit our purposes."

Having received his orders, Qu Bushi immediately withdrew. Li Jiangqian was lost in thought for a while longer before another report came from below, announcing that Chen Yang was waiting outside.

"Have Protector Chen come up," he instructed.

Soon, the black-robed Chen Yang strode in from outside. Despite his constant travels, his cultivation had advanced rapidly, and thanks to his immortal foundation, his aura was exceptionally potent.

"Greetings, Clan Head," he said respectfully. "This subordinate has a matter to report. The Sacred Writ Gate has sent someone with a gift."

Li Jiangqian's brow furrowed. His perception was razor-sharp. "What kind of gift requires a Protector to deliver it?"

The question cut straight to the heart of the matter, its insight almost startling. But Chen Yang was no simple character. He lowered his head and answered respectfully.

"When the Clan Head sent me to the Sacred Writ Gate to offer condolences, they treated me with great courtesy. Perhaps they felt they could establish a rapport with me, so they sent someone hoping to inquire about our clan's disposition through me. The Sacred Writ Gate wishes... to form a marriage alliance with Moongaze Lake."

"The messenger waited for me by the lake during my patrol and approached me when we were alone, presenting the gift. I was caught completely off guard and did not dare to be negligent. I haven't even replied to them. I came straight to the main hall to report!"

The Sacred Writ Gate's intentions were clear. Anyone else might have made some inquiries on their behalf, perhaps speaking of the current situation and accepting the gift. Reporting such a thing to the Clan Head could be awkward, after all. But they had the misfortune of running into Chen Yang, who brought the matter directly to the highest authority.

"No wonder," Li Jiangqian murmured, nodding slightly.

Some time ago, when Chen Yang went to the Sacred Writ Gate for Kong Guli's funeral, the Kong family had refused to see him, which was expected. But the Xuanmu Daoist tradition had not made things difficult for him. Instead, a direct disciple had welcomed him, praised him, and treated him with courtesy throughout.

Li Jiangqian had initially thought it was due to their connection with Purple Smoke, but now it seemed they were here to propose a marriage.

"So that's what they were waiting for," he said with a slight, intrigued smile. "Who is the proposal for, and which of our own are they asking for?"

Chen Yang reported in a solemn voice, "The Sacred Writ Gate is proposing on behalf of their most outstanding direct disciple, Dai Jinquan. However, his age is a bit advanced, so they asked me to gauge your opinion. If the clan has reservations, they will make other arrangements. As for who they wish to marry... they briefly mentioned Lady Xinghan."

Strictly speaking, the wilderness was vast and a crossroads for many powers. The Sacred Writ Gate and the Li Clan had no significant territorial conflicts. Furthermore, the relationship between Purple Smoke and Moongaze Lake was currently on the rise. It was perfectly reasonable for Daoist Master Zhu Gong to want to strengthen ties.

But while the Sacred Writ Gate's thinking was sound, Li Jiangqian had a low opinion of their Xuanmu Daoist tradition. Daoist Master Zhu Gong was a dignified Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, sought after by thousands.

'Whether Daoist Master Zhu Gong's divine abilities are vast remains to be seen,' he thought, 'but either her mind isn't on managing her sect, or she has other plans. The Xuanmu Daoist tradition is a mess. Their inherent flaws haven't been purged, and their methods are crude. I've also heard they are arrogant and domineering toward smaller clans, relying entirely on Zhu Gong's personal prestige to stay afloat…'

'Furthermore, while the Dai family might not be generational demonic cultivators, they came from the Eastern Sea and have a poor reputation. They also cultivate Earth Virtue, and I've never heard of any outstanding members from their line. Although Dai Jinquan is at the Foundation Establishment Realm, he is similarly unknown. If he hadn't come to the lake to inquire before, I would never have even heard his name…'

Both sects had relocated from the Eastern Sea, but in terms of both their Daoist traditions and personal relationships, the Sacred Writ Gate couldn't compare to the Chengyun Gate. Moreover, to suddenly propose a marriage at this specific time... who knew what troubles might be waiting down the road?

The Sacred Writ Gate was only making an inquiry. If Li Jiangqian showed any interest and let slip any hint of it, Zhuang Pingye would likely pack his bags and slip away in shame. Otherwise, Zhuang Cheng would have to come to their door to apologize.

Fortunately, Li Jiangqian was not fond of the Xuanmu Daoist tradition. Having considered all angles, he felt not the slightest temptation.

"You will simply reply to them," he said, "that the Xuanmu Daoist tradition of the Purple Mansion Realm is noble, but the Daoist Master is not home, and her elders are seriously injured and in seclusion. There is no one in the clan with the authority to make such a decision."

"You know how to phrase it. Just say it's your own speculation; don't involve the clan."

Chen Yang understood perfectly. "As for the gift they sent..."

Li Jiangqian waved his hand. "Whatever gift they brought, you can deal with it as you see fit."

"This subordinate has already had it sent to the side hall."

Chen Yang's reply was seamless. As he was about to withdraw, Li Jiangqian stopped him.

"After you've replied to the eastern sect, make a trip to Funan. Jianglong is handling an extremely important matter over there. He has yet to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, so his authority is ultimately limited. You are thorough and cautious. Go and help him."

He picked up a scroll decree that was already prepared on his desk and handed it to Chen Yang. "The clan has an abundance of Foundation Establishment cultivators now," he said gravely. "Take my order and have Miaoshui and An Siwei also travel to the wilderness. Have them station themselves on the riverbank to guard the north."

This was not only to provide backup for Li Jianglong, but also to prepare for the future "confrontation" with the Capital immortals Dao in Funan and on the river. Sending a few people over just before the enemy's planned attack would seem far too prescient and would give them away.

Chen Yang hesitated slightly. "Is there something amiss with the situation in Funan...?"

Li Jiangqian knew Chen Yang's mind was racing. He waved his hand again. "Don't overthink it. When you get there, ask Jianglong for the details. Spare no effort in helping the Second Young Master see this matter through. If there are any mistakes, it will endanger both of your lives."

At these words, Chen Yang's expression changed dramatically. He bowed and retreated. A thought flickered through Li Jiangqian's mind.

'Protector White Ape has been in seclusion for years. He and the clan's elders were heavily injured back then. He should be close to recovery. I need to check on him through the formation array, lest something happens without my knowledge.'

After sending Chen Yang to the north, Li Jiangqian still had many matters to attend to. Although the wedding of his Purple Mansion Realm descendant's uncle was over, there were countless arrangements to handle. He was busy making notes on various memorials when a report came from below. A white-haired old man in a dark blue robe entered the hall.

Li Jiangqian quickly rose from the main seat and came down to support him, but Li Xuanxuan waved him off. The old man's face was grim. "Azure Pond Sect has issued some kind of order," he began. "Li Quantao has been urgently recalled from the north. He's returned in less than half the time he'd mentioned. He passed by Moongaze Lake but didn't even have time to stop and rest. He only left a letter."

"The letter was delivered by one of the lake's patrol cultivators... You should take a look."

"Li Quantao?"

Azure Pond Sect's assignments typically lasted for five years. Li Quantao had been on some important mission; he had even discussed the matter of Chi Zhiyun when he passed by the lake before. Now, only a year and a half later, he had been urgently recalled. Li Jiangqian frowned, a knot of unease tightening in his chest.

'Just after we mentioned his son being used as a weapon, he's urgently recalled... Please don't let this be about Chi Buzi's return…'

Although Chi Buzi's actions were cold-blooded and merciless, he was, after all, a Purple Mansion Daoist Master who commanded four divine abilities. Such a powerful direct descendant of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition would rank among the top five in all of Jiangnan. Moreover, this "Precious Tree of the Chi Clan" was still young. If Chi Buzi returned, it would surely throw Azure Pond Sect into utter chaos.

He took the letter from the old man's hand, his expression serious. He opened it and saw that the contents were brief. The beginning was filled with polite inquiries and greetings. On the next page, however, the handwriting became much more frantic, and the message was bizarre:

*'On the twenty-second day of the tenth month, a sudden cold fell upon Yi Mountain City. Pine and cypress sprouted from bare rock as frost blanketed the ground. Then came a blizzard, burying the plains in over sixteen feet of snow. Hailstones the size of basins rained down, shattering trees and killing countless birds and beasts.'*



# Chapter 832: The Pine Snow Inquiry

The passage was brief. There was no mention of a transfer before it, nor any explanation after. It was just a short note inserted at the end of the letter, completely without context.

Yet this simple account of a great snow caused Li Jiangqian to hold the letter in stunned silence for a long time. He met the old man’s gaze and said in a low voice, “It’s snowing in Yi Mountain City.”

Yi Mountain City was deep in the Southern Borderlands. Snow was unheard of; the city was like summer all year round, and even a frost was a rare event. When Li Xuanxuan heard this, he was momentarily taken aback, but understanding dawned quickly, and a look of shock crossed his face. “It must be Fairy Ning…”

Another family might not have guessed the secret, but the Ning family’s Daoist Master Yuansu had entrusted his legacy to Li Xuanfeng before his death. The Ning clan had once tied its fate to Li Xuanfeng, so the Li family knew a great deal. They immediately understood this referred to Fairy Autumnlake, Ning Wan, who was in seclusion in Yi Mountain City, attempting her breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm.

She was not only the former master of Moonview Peak and Moongaze Lake’s earliest direct superior, but also someone the Li family had known since their humble beginnings. She was an acquaintance of both Sword Immortal Li Chejing and Li Tongya, the Celestial Moon Sword… Furthermore, she cultivated ‘Cold Qi,’ a path similar to Li Xijun’s. The telltale sign of this Dao was the scent of pine and a great, blanketing snow.

“No wonder they summoned him back in such a rush… and no wonder they said it was a matter of incredible importance. This truly is a world-shaking event…”

But a phenomenon was just a phenomenon. Whether it heralded success or failure, a great snow was inevitable. When Li Ximing had his breakthrough, the sky above Moongaze Lake had brightened, yet Azure Pond still assumed he had perished. Li Xuanxuan murmured to himself for a moment before shaking his head.

“Let’s just hope the spirit of Daoist Master Yuansu is watching over her. The Fairy must succeed!”

Li Jiangqian was of a younger generation. By the time he was old enough to understand such things, Ning Wan had already entered seclusion, and she wasn't mentioned specifically in the clan’s histories. He was unfamiliar with Fairy Autumnlake and fell into silent contemplation at the old man’s words.

The old man’s eyes were filled with reminiscence as he shook his head.

“Back then, my second uncle and Wan Yuankai drove a carriage out from the lake, leaving Moongaze Lake for the first time. They met Senior Xiao Yongling, and it was from him they first heard the great name of Fairy Autumnlake… She was already at the eighth level of Qi Refining then, and the number one beauty of the Azure Pond Sect. If she can reach the Purple Mansion Realm now, it would be a truly celebrated tale.”

Li Jiangqian thought for a moment. “In your esteemed opinion, what are Fairy Ning’s chances?”

Li Xuanxuan considered this. “I’d say they’re very high! I heard Daoist Master Yuansu personally chose her cultivation method, and the resources she received were his life’s savings. She even has a Purple Mansion spiritual object of Cold Qi!”

Though Li Xuanxuan was only at the Qi Refining stage, his brothers and his descendants were all exceptional figures. The old man knew a great deal and was quite shrewd. He lowered his voice.

“Yuansu was one of the Three Yuans of Azure Pond, but he was different from Daoist Master Yuanxiu and Yuanwu. His status was likely on par with Chi Wei… both were close friends of the heir to the Immortal Mansion. If his Dao lineage hadn’t been broken, it’s hard to say who would be leading Azure Pond these days.”

“Think of the benefits Chi Wei, Zipei, and that one from Golden Feather received back then. How could Daoist Master Yuansu have any less? His mount was a Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beast. If it weren't for that ruthless, fearless madman Situ Tang, that spirit beast would have lived to become a Purple Mansion expert itself.”

“If you sold off my entire Li family, would it even be worth one of that beast’s eyes? Do you really think the only thing he had was that Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal? How could he not have other treasures?”

“When you look at it that way, Fairy Ning’s breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm is, if not a certainty, at least seventy or eighty percent likely.”

This was a real eye-opener for Li Jiangqian. He nodded slowly. “It seems this is most likely a good thing.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded back. “This old man won’t speak in absolutes, but it is indeed good news. After all, *that* one is getting old, as all the cultivators know. This is a cataclysmic event. If, in the future, our backer is Fairy Ning…”

Although Daoist Master Yuanxiu was the youngest of the Three Yuans, his lifespan was nearing its end. He was also a difficult character who had always harbored ambitions of pulling the Li family into Azure Pond Sect. If Ning Wan were to lead Azure Pond Sect, things would be much easier. Li Jiangqian understood completely. “I suppose it’s too late to head to Yi Mountain City now. With Li Quantao rushing back so quickly, there’s much to ponder.”

Li Xuanxuan replied, “Ning Heyuan died in the north, and the spiritual artifact was lost. To this day, there’s still no news of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. That’s a Dharma Treasure! An ancient spiritual artifact! And since *that one* was already the prime suspect, he certainly has a lot to think about.”

Having concluded their discussion, both agreed it was good news. Li Xuanxuan put the letter away and said, “I don’t know how your arrangements in Jiangbei are proceeding, but this idle old man heard a piece of news. A sword cultivator has appeared in the Wu State, quite famous, with the surname Xu.”

Though Li Jiangqian was swamped with duties, his Foundation Establishment Realm mind processed the information instantly. He pulled a letter from the pile on his desk as he spoke.

“You are correct, my lord. I’ve received news as well. First, Sword Immortal Youfu of the Northern Sea has achieved the Purple Mansion Realm and established a sect in the Feather-Shedding Land, calling it the Northern Mansion Sword Dao…”

He paused, his expression turning serious. “The crucial point is… this man is not only a sword immortal, but a Daoist Master of the Supreme Yang Dao.”

Li Xuanxuan’s heart skipped a beat. He nodded silently. Although Jiangnan was called the heartland of the Supreme Yang Dao, it had few such cultivators and not a single Daoist Master. No one knew how powerful they truly were. As for the Supreme Yin Dao, only the Chunyi Dao Gate was of any consequence. Li Jiangqian continued.

“The other matter is this Daoist Xu. He killed a cultivator from Mount Changhuai and fled deep into the Southern Borderlands. This is the first time such a thing has happened in our era.”

Mount Changhuai’s authority in the Wu State was absolute. To kill one of their people and escape meant this was no ordinary person. Li Jiangqian shook his head. “With the great one’s arrival imminent, these sorts of incidents will naturally increase. There are two or three others, but none as brazen as this Daoist Xu. He is also a master of sword techniques, with exceptional combat prowess.”

Li Xuanxuan said softly, “That’s the truth of it. Although the great one’s chariot will land in Jiangbei, there are many cultivators on both sides of the river. If chaos breaks out, it will be a huge problem. Don’t forget the lesson of Xu Xiao.”

“This junior has been taught.”

Li Jiangqian knew the old man was using the story of Daoist Xu as a warning. He nodded in acknowledgment and saw him out.

***

Yi Mountain City.

Yi Mountain City was the foremost city of the Southern Borderlands, standing guard over Mount Lingqiu on the border of Azure Pond Sect’s territory. Beyond it, the land stretched south into an endless sea of jungle. The Southern Borderlands tended southwest, with North Dan Island and the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang lying to the east along the coast.

If one continued southwest, passing through the dense forests and the ruins of ancient Southern Yue, one would reach the nations of Shahuan and Piao, and even the more distant lands of Meng and Shendu. All of these were considered within the bounds of the countless Demon Ranges deep in the Southern Borderlands.

Although humans were widespread, the traditionally recognized territory of the Xia descendants ended at Yi Mountain City. The rest were considered barbarians. The old state of Chu had been looked down upon by the Central Plains; those outside the city were the barbarians of barbarians, not even worthy of scorn.

This great city, which divided civilization from the wilds, had been named in the ancient texts of the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion. When they first forged the city, it was wreathed in heavenly flames. The fire clouds only dissipated after the spiritual mines of Mount Lingqiu were exhausted, but the area remained rich in spiritual energy and was largely isolated from the atmospheric influences of other regions.

Yet this ancient city, which had not seen snow in centuries, was now draped in a thick white blanket. The snow was deep enough to bury a person, packing the streets solid. Countless cultivators stood on the rooftops that poked through the snow, gazing at the vast, white sky.

‘What a snowstorm…’

After generations of cultivation by the Ning clan, nearly everyone in Yi Mountain City bore the name Ning. Faced with this celestial phenomenon, the cultivators naturally understood its significance. They dared not clear away the snow, watching the heavens with anxious hearts.

In the highest grand hall, a woman in plain clothes sat upon a high seat. She appeared to be middle-aged. Below her stood a man in full armor, his face fierce and forbidding. He was clearly not someone to be trifled with.

“Mother, the snow is letting up.”

Li Yuanqin stood at the entrance of the hall, watching the falling flakes. Ning Hemian rose from her seat. In contrast to her son’s composure, she was visibly agitated. She strode out of the hall and said gravely, “Let us go greet the Daoist Master together!”

Whether Ning Wan had succeeded or not, this was a journey they had to make.

Mother and son arrived at the outer chamber of a deep grotto-mansion. The gate was already thick with frost. The stone statue of the Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beast still crouched before the entrance, its form painted white by the accumulated snow. Only its three eyes stared out with a ghostly light.

Ning Hemian reached out and pressed the statue’s long horn. The mechanism, once impossibly rigid, had loosened. With a gentle turn, the frost-covered gate rumbled open. A dense wave of frigid, frosty Qi erupted from the gap, flowing out like a river of pure white.

Li Yuanqin felt a chill seep into his bones. Both mother and son were now in the Foundation Establishment Realm, but they still felt a deep fear before such intense cold. They waited for the thickest part of the blast to pass before pushing the gate fully open and stepping inside.

Daoist Master Yuansu had sealed the grotto’s array. He had personally designed, modified, and empowered it with his own abilities, making it completely different from the original. Inside, he had placed a lamp of Blazing Fire. Only when this dharma lamp was extinguished by the invading cold Qi would the sealed array open.

The design was ingenious, solving nearly every potential problem. Even a traitor from within the Ning family could not interfere. As long as the Cold Qi surged within the grotto, entry was possible. If Ning Wan emerged, all was well. If she had perished, the Ning family could still enter to collect her remains.

Li Yuanqin braved the biting Cold Qi and entered. The first thing he saw was a jade lamp on a table by the inner door, long since extinguished, leaving the grotto lit only by a dim, yellow glow.

This was Ning Tiaoxiao’s cultivation chamber. The jade platform, perpetually soaked in spiritual energy, stood silently in the gloom. The walls shimmered faintly with an eerie light. Li Yuanqin took a closer look and felt a chill crawl up his spine.

The stone walls flickered with a dark luminescence, as if many people were standing within them, looking out. Sweat beaded on the back of his neck. Ning Hemian pulled him back gently and whispered, “This is a Daoist Master's cultivation place. See little, hear little.”

Li Yuanqin lowered his head. Ning Wan’s seclusion chamber was on the other side of the grotto, only a dozen steps away. He took a single step forward, only to hear his mother drop to her knees with a thud. She spoke with the utmost reverence.

“Greetings, Daoist Master!”

He snapped his head up. The jade platform, which had been empty a moment ago, now held a woman in a white dress.

She was tall with eyes that curved like crescent moons and long black hair that cascaded down her back. A single, vertical white mark adorned her brow. Her features were gentle and soft, but her eyes held a cool detachment that made it impossible to look away.

The woman appeared to be no more than twenty years old. Her sleeves were embroidered with golden patterns, and she sat quietly on the edge of the jade platform, her fair legs dangling over the side, her bare feet resting upon a bank of pristine white mist.

The entire grotto was suddenly filled with the scent of pine.

Li Yuanqin quickly stepped back and knelt behind his mother, listening to the Fairy's cold voice.

“Hemian, where is Li Xuanfeng?”

Ning Wan did not ask about Ning Tiaoxiao, as if she had long known the elder’s fate. Though this was the day she attained her great power, her gaze held a deep sorrow as she looked around the empty grotto. Ning Hemian replied respectfully, “During the North-South War, my husband died fighting to stop the southward advance of the Buddhist cultivators.”

A shadow passed over Ning Wan’s eyes. “That sounds like something he would do.”

She spoke again. “Has Chi Zhiyun emerged from seclusion yet? He was always so competitive, always trying to be one step ahead of me. Looks like he’s fallen behind this time.”

Ning Hemian answered deferentially, “Reporting to the Daoist Master, Chi Zhiyun has already perished. The Chi family’s direct line is severed. There are no longer any cultivators named Chi in Azure Pond.”

For the first time, Ning Wan’s composure broke. After listening to their account of all that had transpired, she fell into a long silence, a look of loneliness in her eyes. “A pity. He was quite a character.”

She made a quick calculation in her mind, and her expression grew solemn. “Heyuan fell. Where is the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal!”

“Its whereabouts are unknown…”

Ning Wan clenched her jaw and let out a cold snort. “How unsightly.”

The Daoist Master stepped down from the jade platform as if walking on air. She turned to face the eerily glowing stone wall behind her and called out, “Who goes there?”

One by one, faces began to emerge from the stone, some clear, some blurry. But Ning Wan ignored them, her gaze fixed on a distant corner of the wall. Soon, the apparitions faded. She seemed to be calculating something. After a moment, she thought to herself:

‘Nineteen… two are missing… The Great One said that when a face fades, it means they are seeking Fruition Attainment. Besides Senior Zipei, there’s one other. Since no one has been heard to achieve the rank of True Monarch, they must have been reincarnated through a Metallic Essence.’

‘Coincidentally, three streams of Metallic Essence have separated from Anhuai Heaven. One of them should correspond to ‘True Qi.’ Looking at the position… it’s the one from Mount Changhuai. They’re making a play for the position of ‘True Qi.’’

She pursed her lips, lost in thought for a long while, then lightly tapped the jade platform. The platform trembled and split down the middle, revealing a box containing twenty-eight small, white flags.

The woman beckoned gently, and the twenty-eight flags flew up together, circling her palm. A faint smile touched Ning Wan’s lips as she stepped forward. The entire grotto array began to shake, and countless points of white light flared. From the Great Void, a massive, table-sized array disk covered in profound patterns emerged.

Setting up a Purple Mansion array was always a complicated affair. Even with a pre-made array disk, deployment and retrieval were troublesome. Yet for Ning Wan, it seemed as simple as taking a tool out of storage.

“Let’s go. We’ll pay a visit to Senior Yuanxiu.”

The Fairy of Autumnlake rose into the air, borne upon the endless falling snow. Standing below, Ning Hemian was suddenly struck by a belated realization:

‘The Daoist Master was called Fairy Autumnlake back then, and not just for her cultivation level… Her talent in the dao of arrays was something even Daoist Master Chi Wei, Daoist Master Yuanxiu, and the others had praised…’



# Chapter 833: Omen

# Moongaze Lake

As the days passed, the situation in Jiangbei grew increasingly tense. Though the lake’s surface remained placid, its upper echelons were a hive of frantic activity. The flow of people in and out of the great hall swelled, particularly Qu Bushi, who, having been thrust into a position of great responsibility, was so busy he barely had a moment’s rest.

Li Jiangqian had already dispatched his men and was waiting in the great hall. After a long while, he finally saw Wang Quwan enter from outside. A blue and gold sword hung at the man’s waist. He carried himself with a steady gravity, his posture as firm as a pine, inspiring respect in all who saw him.

Li Jiangqian glanced at him and asked warmly, "How are your injuries? Have you had Elder Sun take a look?"

Wang Quwan cupped his hands in a fist. "Patriarch, I have been recuperating according to Elder Sun's instructions. He examined me again these past few days, which is why I have only just left my cave-dwelling."

The wounds he had sustained in Jiangbei were not severe, and after this period of recovery, he was almost fully healed. Li Jiangqian nodded. "And what of Daoist Shouding from Mount Jingyi? Is there any news?"

At the mention of this, Wang Quwan looked extremely embarrassed. When Daoist Shouding had returned with him, he had been terrified of being ambushed and dared not go back to Mount Jingyi. Instead, he had darted into a Li family cave-dwelling and immediately entered seclusion, refusing to leave or even show his face.

The Li family certainly didn't lack a spare cave, but Wang Quwan understood the sensitivities of the situation. The two families were not on the best of terms, and he himself was living under their roof; he knew he had to be cautious in all things. As the one who had brought Shouding here, he felt both anxious and mortified that his guest was overstaying his welcome.

"This subordinate has inquired several times," he replied. "I even borrowed his seal to write letters to Mount Jingyi. At first, there were some replies discussing who they might send to escort him back. But a few months ago, the contact suddenly ceased. Every letter I've sent since has vanished without a trace…"

"I have troubled the clan," he continued, "and my heart is ill at ease. I am willing to lease this cave-dwelling on his behalf…"

Li Jiangqian nodded with a flicker of amusement. He knew perfectly well why Mount Jingyi had suddenly gone silent.

‘How could they dare to write back?’ he thought.

The Xuanyi Dao lineage was an Eastern Sea power; their intelligence network in Jiangbei was certainly no match for the Li family’s. They likely only knew that a True Monarch was coming. Now, a token from the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage had appeared, and Shouding himself was a practitioner of that path. The connection was too obvious to ignore, and they were undoubtedly terrified.

‘If Shouding were to walk out of Jiangbei openly right now, I doubt even the Chunyi Dao Gate would dare ambush him. He could reach the foot of Mount Jingyi, and Xuanyi wouldn't even dare open the gates for him.’

‘After all,’ he mused, ‘a mainland power might still show a sliver of decorum, perhaps sending someone to read an edict. But the overseas factions are demonic cultivators, and the entire Xuanyi sect cultivates Earth Virtue… If the reincarnated True Monarch were to slap Xuanyi across the face, they’d have to offer up the other cheek, worried that he wasn't fully satisfied.’

At that moment, Li Jiangqian felt that his family's reputation on the righteous path was rather useful. At the very least, major powers had to maintain some semblance of decorum and cared about appearances.

Seeing Wang Quwan's uneasy expression, Li Jiangqian smiled. "Protector Wang, there is no need for such courtesy. We are all family here. Elder Sun was once a capable aide under Daoist Master Changxi of the Profound Peak Dao lineage. His medical skills are more than reliable."

He paused briefly, steering the conversation toward the Profound Peak lineage. He recounted the story of the "One-Incense-Stick Family," leaving Wang Quwan utterly dumbfounded. For a moment, Wang Quwan almost thought Li Jiangqian was mocking him, but then he continued.

"The one known as the 'Li Fire Spear' back then, who later became Daoist Master Chu, was a similar case."

The Profound Peak was a lofty Purple Mansion Realm sect. Though it had declined, its members were still honored guests of Daoist Masters. To Wang Quwan, such matters were distant. But Chu Yi, the "Li Fire Spear," had passed through Jiangbei on his journey north years ago; the Wang family was certain to have records of it. Understanding dawned in Wang Quwan's heart.

"So that's how it is… Daoist Master Chu is also a reincarnated True Monarch… No wonder he could break through to the Purple Mansion Realm in the middle of a battle…"

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian could only shake his head with a hint of resignation. "The words 'in battle' and 'breakthrough to Purple Mansion Realm' simply do not belong together. Not even the greatest genius could achieve such a feat. It is merely a game for a True Monarch. The reason I sought you out is because a True Monarch is about to be reincarnated in Jiangbei."

He paused, then added, "This is a celestial decree from the north."

Handling Wang Quwan was an exceedingly delicate matter. The Ding clan of Ding Weizeng had been persecuted and their numbers had dwindled; they had already been relocated to the lake. This left Wang Quwan as the most prestigious local cultivator remaining in Jiangbei.

The Wang clan’s direct bloodline numbered in the tens of thousands, scattered throughout Jiangbei. Many sects in the region had members of the Jiangbei Wang clan within their ranks. Protecting the entire clan was simply not realistic.

The fatal blow was that the mortal members of the Jiangbei Wang clan were all either landlords or local gentry—figures essential for maintaining regional stability. On any normal day, they were the common folk the immortal sects spoke of protecting. But when a True Monarch was reincarnated, these were the very people who would become the first stepping stones.

From these mortals, one could easily trace a path back to the cultivators. The Wang clan was spread far and wide; following the threads could lead directly back to Wang Quwan himself. A reincarnated True Monarch didn't operate on logic. If he toppled a landlord connected to the Wangs, he could very well slaughter his way to the river's edge, causing a massive embarrassment for the Li family.

Li Jiangqian still hoped to protect Wang Quwan. It wasn’t because of the resources the Li family had invested in him over the years, but because of the fragment hidden within their secret vault.

But there were limits to that protection. Li Jiangqian would never endanger his own family's survival for one man. He carefully watched the shock on the other's face and said softly, "The number of people in the family who know of this can be counted on one hand. I tell you this because the Wang clan's entanglements in Jiangbei run too deep. If arrangements are not made soon, disaster is inevitable."

Sweat immediately beaded on Wang Quwan's forehead.

"To ensure your own safety, relocating your clan is the best option," Li Jiangqian continued. "Once the True Monarch has departed, it will not be too late to return to Jiangbei."

From the bottom of his heart, Li Jiangqian hoped Wang Quwan would choose this path. Wang Quwan was different from the family’s other retainers and protectors. The Wang clan held immense sway in Jiangbei, a colossal entity that could answer his call. The Li family couldn't conveniently extend its influence across the river, and Wang Quwan had never truly committed his heart to the lake. He could never become one of the Li family’s true, trusted followers.

If he could use this event to weaken the ties between Wang Quwan and the Wang clan, and bring people like him to the lake, the situation would be entirely different.

But Wang Quwan thought it over and said in a low voice, "The Jiangbei Wang clan numbers in the tens of thousands. I cannot simply sit by and watch. Furthermore, if the True Monarch is reincarnated, it is possible he could be born as a Wang. If I abandon them for the lake today, it could create hidden dangers for the future."

"In this subordinate's humble opinion," he continued, "the ties of blood cannot be cleanly severed, no matter how one tries. It is impossible to move every member of the Wang clan to the lake. If even one person who is left behind makes a mistake, the True Monarch will see it as the mistake of the entire clan. Trouble will follow."

Whether such ties could truly be severed depended on the person in question. But for a man of Wang Quwan's character, being forced to do so would be more difficult than taking his life. Hearing his reply, Li Jiangqian felt a sense of apprehension and sighed internally.

‘This man… is truly bound by fate…’

It was clear now. Since Wang Quwan was determined to share the fate of the Jiangbei Wang clan, he was embracing an enormous risk. Li Jiangqian could not force him, could not tie him up and drag him away. It seemed all he could do was arrange for a favorable outcome.

‘So this is the work of destiny. Wang Quwan's fate was likely intertwined with the True Monarch's reincarnation from the very beginning. Now, as the day approaches, it is forcing my hand, making me send him to Jiangbei to play the role he was meant to play. Marvelous… truly marvelous.’

Li Jiangqian could only say, "Since your mind is made up, I will 'demote' you to a post in Jiangbei. You are to ignore whatever happens in Funan and head directly to your clan's territory. Do not speak of what you should not, or you will face annihilation. More than one Daoist Master is watching from the Great Void."

Wang Quwan bowed slightly. "This subordinate will depart immediately to stand guard in Jiangbei for six years. When the time is up, I will return to the lake to report."

Li Jiangqian shook his head gravely and watched him leave. Just then, Qu Bushi came to report. The old man spoke in a low voice, "Patriarch, a message from the north. They have already set out for Funan."

Li Jiangqian pulled his thoughts back to the present and nodded silently. "White Ape…"

He stopped mid-sentence, looking up thoughtfully. Outside the hall, a brilliant flare of fire descended, pulsing with light. A woman strode through the air.

She wore a long red dress, her features exquisite and captivating. She rode upon a roaring True Fire, holding a hexagonal lantern in her hand. Inside it, a soft, downy flame flickered gently. She wore a slight smile. Li Jiangqian rose hastily.

"Greetings, Great Aunt! Congratulations on emerging from seclusion and advancing your cultivation!"

Li Minggong returned the smile. Following behind her was a tall, white-haired old man clad in stone armor. It was, without a doubt, the White Ape.

With two pieces of good news arriving at once, Li Jiangqian let out a small breath of relief. Li Minggong waved for Qu Bushi to leave, her expression turning serious.

"My recovery shouldn't have taken this long," she said. "But my cultivation had just been refined when I encountered the Inward Heart Surging Profundity, an auspicious state for fire-attribute cultivators seeking a breakthrough. I felt an insight and broke through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. It was a stroke of luck, but my foundation was unstable, so I spent extra time solidifying my cultivation."

"So that's what happened!"

Li Jiangqian offered a few more words of congratulations, but Li Minggong said gravely, "This is not the time for celebration. Upon leaving seclusion, I first paid my respects to the Old Master. He told me of the current troubles, and I came to find you immediately. How have you arranged our forces for the riverbank?"

Li Jiangqian organized his thoughts and replied at once, "Protector Ding holds a grudge against the Capital immortals Dao, so I've left him on the north bank. Protector Cui will guard the east bank. The rest will cross the river with me to spar with the Capital immortals Dao. The Embyronic Breathing cultivators in the family need not go, but the Qi Refining disciples can join the fights to gain experience."

"I have instructed both sides that this is merely a period of probing and standoffs," he added. "They are to avoid lethal force in all matters to prevent bloodshed from escalating the situation…"

The matter of the True Monarch could not be spoken of freely, so this excuse was passable. Li Minggong nodded thoughtfully.

"It is for the best that Ding Weizeng is not involved. The Ding family was nearly wiped out by Wenhu and uprooted from their lands. Although the clan has moved here, it's possible some of their bloodline remains in Jiangbei. It is not wise for him to get involved."

"Miaoshui and Qu Bushi are rogue cultivators…"

As Li Minggong was pondering, Li Jiangqian reminded her, "There are also two demonic cultivators with sealed cultivation on the east bank… Their surname is Wen. They migrated from the Eastern Sea and have been tending the furnaces on the mountain for many years. Since they hail from the Eastern Sea, it shouldn't be an issue… If Great Aunt has any concerns, I can go and deal with them."

Li Minggong shook her head, the hexagonal lantern in her hand swaying slightly. "That won't be necessary… I didn't expect so much to have happened. To think that in the end, we must join forces with the Capital immortals Dao. If they truly are at odds with Changxiao, then so be it. But I fear that Daoist Master is a cunning one, deliberately saying such things to seize upon our moment of weakness and plot some other scheme."

A thoughtful look crossed Li Jiangqian's face, but the palace-gowned woman before him said, "There is no use in overthinking it now. You and I will go to the river together."

***

On Azure Pond Peak, white mist swirled and clouds drifted. This place was the hub of the Azure Pond Sect’s Tianyuan One Dao Spiritual Array, a place where the spiritual energy should have remained constant day after day. Now, however, it held a touch of chill.

A blast of frost and snow swept in, landing before a cave-dwelling and solidifying into a woman in white. She was exceptionally beautiful, and the faint fragrance of pine spread from her. She took a step forward and announced in a clear voice, "Junior Ning Wan requests an audience with Senior Si!"

Ning Wan was a cultivator of Azure Pond. Her breakthrough had not been made public, nor had she yet called for a gathering of cultivators to celebrate. Instead, she had come directly to the main peak to meet with Yuanxiu.

After a moment's wait, an aged voice emerged, "Wan'er, you've come out of seclusion. Please, come in."

Ning Wan's form dissolved into white snow, reappearing over a large pool of Pristine Water that shimmered like a vast gemstone. In the midst of the cold snow, six ornate jade thrones carved from azure jade appeared even more brilliant. On one of the thrones sat an old man, looking his age. His face was a dense, overlapping mesh of wrinkles, as gnarled as old tree bark, and his eyes seemed somewhat vacant.

Ning Wan did not sit beside him. Instead, she took her place on the third-to-last throne. With one not taking the main seat and the other sitting two seats away on the same side, the arrangement looked awkward, as if each of the six thrones had a specific owner.

Unlike other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who often concealed their aged appearance, Yuanxiu made no such attempt. "My heartfelt congratulations," he said in a raspy voice.

"I told my martial brother earlier that you went into seclusion too soon. You wouldn't be able to use the spirit pills that Yuanli and Xuanfeng obtained in Anhuai Heaven, which is a true pity. But he paid me no mind. I suppose he was certain you would succeed."

The relationship between the martial brothers Yuanxiu and Yuansu was complicated. They were once close but had later gone their separate ways. Ning Wan was in no position to comment, so she simply replied, "The Daoist Master had another spirit pill he obtained long ago… he allowed me to consume it. I was also quite fortunate, and thus I succeeded."

Yuanxiu let out a derisive snort. "When Chi Wei asked him, he gave a cold face and said he obtained nothing. It was a lie, of course. If not for the Dharma Treasure in Yuansu's hands, and the fact that Chi Wei was on death's door, who knows what he might have done."

Dense spiritual energy mixed with the glow of Dharma, illuminating the entire cave-dwelling with a radiant light that made Ning Wan herself seem to shine. She said gently, "Did anyone pursue the matter of Can Lufu's fake pill? When he was dying, everyone gave him leeway. After he died, he was dust returning to dust, and no one cared."

Her words were not pleasant and seemed to carry a hidden meaning. A gurgling laugh rumbled in Yuanxiu's throat. The five fingers of his exposed left hand were stretched taut. Then, one by one, they separated, revealing more than ten fingers on that palm, like the gnarled roots of an old tree, clamped firmly onto the jade throne. He chuckled, "Indeed! Indeed!"

His eyes reflected the shimmering Pristine Merging Owl Pool, and the smile on his face grew wider. He suddenly said, "You may not believe me, but the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal is not in my possession."



# Chapter 834: Why Seek Another Path?

Ning Wan sat silently upon her jade-green throne, seemingly unmoved by Yuanxiu’s words. This matter couldn’t be dismissed simply because the old man claimed the item was no longer in his hands. The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal was an exceptionally precious Dharma Treasure, a renowned artifact even in ancient times, powerful enough to make any Purple Mansion Realm cultivator cast aside their pride.

Her gaze fell upon the old man’s hand resting on the throne’s armrest. "Back then," she said softly, "the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal was in the hands of you seniors. It made scheming against others convenient and reaped you plenty of benefits. But no matter what, that artifact belongs to Azure Pond Sect. We are a proud Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Even with our master temporarily absent, our treasures should not be so easily taken."

Ning Wan was clearly unconvinced. Yuanxiu, his back stooped with age, replied, "That ordinary people would not dare only proves that it was no ordinary person who took it. What belongs to Yuansu is his. I would not hide it."

His words, contrary to her expectation, gave Ning Wan pause. A flicker of genuine doubt entered her heart. "Senior, you refuse to say who took it," she pressed. "If the situation is truly so dire that it cannot be spoken of, why speak of it today? And if this is because our master is beyond the heavens, why did he not secure it long ago?"

Yuanxiu stood like an old, weathered tree. "The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal is the seal of the Feathered Serpent, the progenitor of Pristine Water," he said in a low voice. "This item is far more useful than you imagine. The only reason it was in Ning Tiaoxiao’s hands was because our master allowed it. Once he died, the item was naturally lost."

"But there was one thing our master did not anticipate. Even if Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun, had left a treasure for Ning Tiaoxiao’s reincarnation within the seal, he would have died before ever using it. That was the sort of man he was. He would grit his teeth and swallow his own blood before ever nourishing his enemy."

Ning Wan’s expression began to shift as the old man continued speaking calmly.

"When Ning Tiaoxiao fell, Zipei thought me greedy, that I wanted to seize the artifact from the Ning Family. She insisted on placing it in Ning Heyuan's hands... She overestimated me. As long as that seal remained with a Ning, the moment I looked away, it would be schemed away by others... I am a Great Daoist Master of Azure Pond Sect. They wouldn't know if I acted with our master's blessing. But Ning Heyuan was different. For him, possessing it was a death warrant."

"If he had been more perceptive back then, he might not have died."

Ning Wan wanted to speak but held her tongue. Yuanxiu went on, "You can't blame her. How could one speak of such matters to someone outside the Daoist tradition? She was fiercely protective of Yuansu. Had I tried to take the seal by force, she would have fought me. I could only leave. As I departed, I saw Pu Yu of the Penglai Daoist tradition performing divinations. His arts are profound; perhaps he had long suspected something."

Ning Wan listened in silence.

"I watched you grow up," the old man said. "For the sake of the bond between our families, let me offer you some advice. The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal is not something you can touch. Wait until I am dead, when you are sitting alone upon the Pristine Merging Owl Pool, and you will understand just how much trouble it is."

He let out a dry, raspy laugh. "By then, you won't be the master of the Ning Family. You will be the master of Azure Pond Sect! Whether you want it or not, it will no longer be the Ning Family of Azure Pond Sect, but the Azure Pond Sect of the Ning Family."

A complex look crossed Ning Wan’s face. As a sect cultivator raised in Azure Pond and bound to the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, she was already marked. With the Pristine Speech Heaven watching from above, she could never truly leave. At most, she could emulate Chi Buzi, feigning a desire to travel the world to abandon her clan. She would never have the power to break away and establish herself independently as a great immortal clan.

‘Chi Buzi… that cold-hearted, parentless madman…’

Her expression darkened. Yuanxiu, however, seemed lost in thought. With his lifespan nearing its end, the old man’s usually stern and stoic face showed more emotion. "The Cold Qi divine ability, 'Serene Listen'," he said wistfully. "To select this superior technique for you, Yuansu went so far as to ally with Tianwan. He mastered it decades ago, and now you too have refined this Life Divine Ability. There is a matter in the north that requires your attention."

Seeing Ning Wan frown, Yuanxiu casually explained the situation. "I suppose you haven't heard... The Li Family is now a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan. A Moongaze Immortal Clan, no less! If you pass through their territory, you might as well pay them your respects."

Suspicion colored Ning Wan's features. "A Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan... you don't mean Li Xizhi?"

A complicated light flickered in Yuanxiu's eyes. "It is Li Xizhi's younger brother, Li Ximing. He was once an unknown figure, but it seems he was hiding his true strength, cultivating diligently until he mastered the Bright Yang divine ability. He is known as Zhaojing. He is also an alchemist, though I do not know how skilled."

"From the looks of it, Bright Yang is not a path that excels in alchemy. He cannot be compared to Qing Tangyin. I estimate he is at the level of a Hengxing."

Ning Wan’s brows arched in pleasant surprise. Geographically, the Li Clan was a natural ally for Azure Pond Sect, and their two families had always maintained a good relationship, built upon the bonds of their ancestors and strengthened by marriage. How could she not be pleased? She had helped Li Chejing in the past and let Li Xuanfeng go; these were all fortuitous connections.

‘Aside from that lunatic Ning Hejing, my Ning Clan’s relationship with the Li Clan isn’t bad at all,’ she mused. ‘And Li Yuanqin was the one who pushed the Chi Family to their downfall. This is perfect.’

After some thought, she wondered if his temperament would make him a suitable ally. The world was full of eccentrics, after all. "This Daoist Master Zhaojing," she couldn't help but ask, "what is his character like?"

Yuanxiu narrowed his eyes. "Pure, kind, and gentle, holding no grudges. He cultivates Bright Yang with introspection, not aggression, much like the ancient cultivators of the Cui Clan. He is soft-hearted but discerning, benevolent and compassionate, and devoted above all to the legacy of his clan's ancestors."

Ning Wan nodded repeatedly. Yuanxiu did not have many days left; he had no reason to deceive her on such matters. His judgment of character had always been uncannily sharp and was worth considering. "To have such a Purple Mansion Realm master nearby," she said, "is truly a blessing for Azure Pond."

Yuanxiu grunted, a sneer touching his lips. "Without Chi Wei, Azure Pond would have had many more blessings..."

"My life is almost over. I once forced Li Xuanfeng to consume a pill that destroyed his path to the Purple Mansion Realm. Li Ximing will never trust me. You are far more suited to lead Azure Pond than I. The one currently managing the sect's affairs is a junior from Yuandao's line—from the Nine Mounds Dantai Clan. In the future, Azure Pond will not lack for Purple Mansion Realm masters. It falls to you to lead them."

Ning Wan knew she could not escape the orbit of Azure Pond. But to become a generational leader of the Azure Pond of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was an incredibly advantageous position for her own lineage. With this shift in status, her perspective changed as well. "A senior from Yuandao? That is also fate... Although the Supreme Mound follows the Supreme Yin Daoist tradition, they share a root with Azure Pond. Senior Yuandao once studied here, and now one from the Dantai Clan repays that debt. It is a fitting arrangement."

At the mention of Yuandao, Yuanxiu’s emotions grew complex. He lowered his head. "Did you ask? Qing Tangyin... has he truly been reincarnated?"

Ning Wan nodded silently. Yuanxiu's gaze turned cold. "Zhang Tianyuan has also fallen. He was once a nobody, not worth a second glance, good only for bullying clan cultivators. Yuansu never gave him a thought."

Ning Wan had no desire to be entangled in their old grievances. That generation of Purple Mansion Realm masters had all advanced in unison due to the Immortal Mansion's inheritor, and their relationships were a tangled web of favors and feuds. She simply rose from her seat. "I will go and oversee the matter in the north immediately."

"My breakthrough will be at the Shitang," Si Boxiu said.

She transformed into a flurry of frost and coalesced at the cave entrance, her white robes fluttering. Just as she was about to leave, his words struck her as odd. A rumbling, whooshing sound of wind began to build behind her.

*Whoosh!*

The rustle of trees echoed from behind. Ning Wan froze, glancing slightly over her shoulder.

The damp scent of the forest washed over her, and the chirping of crickets grew louder. She saw the old man on the throne struggling to his feet, his hands gripping the armrests, his chest heaving forward as if an endless gale was blasting out from behind him.

Yet Ning Wan felt not the slightest breeze.

*Chirp... Chirp...*

The gale behind the old man pulled his clothes taut against his front, the loose robes revealing Si Boxiu's thin, withered frame. His two knees moved inward, fusing together. His flesh sprouted roots, binding his legs into one, while his feet lengthened unnaturally, crawling across the floor.

He snapped his head up, a gurgling sound escaping his throat. Only then did Ning Wan notice what was wrong.

A slick, dark brown cricket was perched in Si Boxiu's pupil.

Its two greenish-black antennae extended out of the eye socket, waving lazily. Si Boxiu seemed unaware of the insect in his eye. He was completely focused, his lips pressed tightly together as the limbs of some foreign object repeatedly tried to push out from between them, only to retract as if in pain.

Ning Wan’s pupils widened.

Si Boxiu’s normal eye noticed her gaze, and a flicker of hope appeared within it. His left hand, now sprouting more branches and leaves, held fast to the armrest while his right hand suddenly let go.

With that release, most of his body lifted into the air, like an old tree in a storm with only a few roots left clinging to the soil. He waved his now-free hand at Ning Wan.

She still felt no wind. Her spiritual sense and divine abilities detected only calm within the cave; the pool below was without a single ripple. Yet Si Boxiu was utterly exhausted. The hand he had freed, now restored to its normal, wrinkled appearance, gestured toward her. He curled four fingers, leaving only his index finger extended, pointing. Then, the old man’s mouth gaped open. In that instant, countless green insects flew out, taking wing. Ning Wan saw clearly that the inside of his mouth was like wood grain, rigid and unyielding.

But he bared his snow-white teeth and, like a pouncing tiger, bit down viciously on his own finger.

*BOOM!*

The Body Divine Ability of the Upright Wood path was incredibly resilient. The impact was like a thunderclap, sending sparks and violet lightning erupting. The old man raised his head, his one normal hand still facing him, but the index finger was gone.

Even one as composed as Ning Wan could not help but stumble back two steps. She watched as Si Boxiu offered a meaningful smile, the severed finger still held in his mouth. Slowly, his left hand released its grip.

"Ah?"

Finally, Ning Wan felt the wind. It was a roar louder than the preceding thunderclap. Her robes whipped about her as the old man, light as a bird, shot out of the cave with a *whoosh*.

She didn't even have time to react. She turned her head dazedly, watching Si Boxiu soar into the sky.

He flew higher and higher, not in a straight line south, but circling like an agile sparrow, spiraling diagonally toward the southern horizon.

The old man used neither dharma power nor divine ability. He simply held his arms out to his sides, carefully maintaining his balance, until he became a tiny black dot against the sky.

A green rain began to fall.

Ning Wan stood amidst the swirling wind and rain, her dress swaying. She held out a hand, palm up, catching the emerald droplets. Fear still lingered in her eyes, but it was being rapidly overtaken by a profound confusion.

The rain quickly formed a small green puddle in her palm. The woman stared at it, murmuring, "Pristine Water… How is this possible… This is Clear Dusk Rain. Why is it raining… why is the Clear Dusk Rain falling?"

"His path is Upright Wood!"

But she had no time for questions. Si Boxiu, the Great Daoist Master of the Azure Pond Sect, the foremost master of the Upright Wood path in this age, the number one talisman master in Jiangnan—today, he sought Fruition Attainment!

She raised a hand and flicked a finger. The great bell beside her immediately began to sway.

*DONG! DONG! DONG!*

The urgent tolling of the bell resounded throughout the Azure Pond mountain range. The sound of panicked footsteps drew closer. Ning Wan remained on the peak, gazing at the descending green rain. The Sect Master, Dantai Jin, practically scrambled to her side, prostrating himself without a moment's hesitation or question. "Greetings, Daoist Master!" he cried out in alarm.

Ning Wan glanced down at him. "You are the Sect Master," she commanded. "Whether to see our senior off or to broaden your own horizons, you should accompany me."

***

The Southern Sea, North Dan Island.

Upon the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, the waves churned violently. When Ning Wan tore through the Great Void and arrived, the sky was already a maelstrom of roiling black clouds.

She looked up and could see the black dot circling high above. Group after group of cultivators stood in mid-air, their faces a mixture of awe and terror as they stared at the heavens.

The entire sea was in turmoil, great waves swirling on its surface. The sky grew darker, and the magical winds became harder to control, forcing some cultivators to descend. All colors faded from the world, save for the brilliant lights of divine abilities that pierced through the Great Void to hang suspended in the air.

Ning Wan stood her ground as the gale swept past. Beside her, Dantai Jin was shaking, his mind a complete blank as he stared at the circling dot in the sky.

‘Senior Yuanxiu? Is he attaining his Dao?’

‘Why so suddenly?!’

Before he could think further, snow-white clouds began to form beneath his feet. Thunder cracked across the sky. Dantai Jin looked into the distance and saw dozens of radiant lights within the storm clouds—at least several dozen Purple Mansion Realm masters had gathered around the sea of the Shitang, ascending together into the highest heavens.

A fine, dense static began to fill his ears. Dantai Jin realized the green rain was falling here as well. Now that they were closer to the zenith, he could finally see the old man circling in the sky.

‘This… Old Senior…’

The Yuanxiu that Dantai Jin knew had always been meticulous and composed. The man he saw now was hunched over, soaring with outstretched arms. His eyes were terrifyingly wide, with several black crickets crawling across his pupils, and his entire body was overgrown with branches and leaves. The sight was horrifying.

"Senior Yuanxiu!"

Dantai Jin watched in silence. He had not been summoned here on a whim. Yuanxiu and Yuandao had made arrangements long ago; he had been chosen at the age of six to become Yuanxiu’s disciple. He respected this old man more than his own father, who was always in seclusion.

But the old man who had picked him out from all the other Dantai children seemed to have vanished long ago.

Dantai Jin felt dizzy from the sheer number of divine ability projections in the sky. Ning Wan, however, suddenly looked up toward a nearby point. Two figures, one behind the other, had appeared on a cloud, their forms indistinct.

Ning Wan knew they were from the Underworld. With Si Boxiu in his current state, no one was there to greet them, but the two paid it no mind. They watched the circling Si Boxiu from afar.

"Such audacity!" one said.

The other sighed, his voice sharp. "It is as if the heavens themselves are helping him. Who would dare to leech off True Monarch Du’s authority over Pristine Water like this? It is only because the True Monarchs are all beyond the heavens, with no time to spare for this world, that he can borrow this power."

"If not for that, how could you say he has audacity? And audacity is all it is."

Ning Wan listened quietly, until a gentle voice sounded from her other side.

"He has been pushed to a dead end. If not for that, how could he seek the Dao in this manner?"

"Hm?"

Ning Wan was horrified. She was a dignified Purple Mansion Realm master; for someone to approach her undetected was unthinkable. Her body instantly dissolved into ice and snow, only to rematerialize in the same spot a moment later. "Greetings, Grand Martial Uncle," she said, looking slightly flustered.

The man beside her, dressed in an azure robe with golden tassels, stood with his profile to her, exuding an air of transcendent detachment. His pupils, however, held a faint green-blue light that seemed more demonic than immortal. He smiled faintly. "Chou-Gui Hidden Form."

Ning Wan had met this man in her youth. It was Chi Buzi, who had been missing for many years!

She gave an awkward nod. Chi Buzi was clearly explaining how he had appeared beside her so suddenly. He was a Great Daoist Master now. All Ning Wan could do was stand by his side respectfully.

‘The entire Chi Family was annihilated, Chi Zhiyun’s Grotto-Heaven was desecrated and he was murdered, yet none of that could move this Great Daoist Master. But for Great Daoist Master Si's breakthrough, he was already waiting here in the Southern Sea, without any prior sign.’

Chi Buzi completely ignored the two emissaries from the Underworld, leaving them to stand there like thin air. "Ning Wan… not bad," he said in a low, ethereal voice. "You've reached the Purple Mansion Realm as well. It seems Senior Yuansu's spiritual resources were abundant enough to benefit you."

Hearing this, the hair on Ning Wan's arms stood on end. She almost turned and fled, but Chi Buzi chuckled twice. This man followed the heartless Great Dao, and was known to be aloof and cruel, yet his laughter was pleasant to the ear. "You need not be afraid. I have no desire for the senior's meager possessions."

"The path of Upright Wood," he asked, "do you know what it is called?"

Ning Wan certainly didn't dare leave. Unsure of his intentions, she shook her head hesitantly. A smile touched Chi Buzi's face. "Dui Metal is the true position of Shen-You Metal. Likewise, Upright Wood is the true position of Jia-Yi Wood. Its full name is the 'Dedicated Path of True Mao-Xun Wood'. The name alone tells you it is a righteous and true way. To seek this path while trying to supplement it with unorthodox shortcuts? That is a fool's dream."

"And yet... the inheritance of the Upright Wood path is scarce. Forget all five branches, even gathering three is a monumental task... The Sima Family has held onto their branch for so many years, yet no one has ever achieved Fruition Attainment with it."

"So, Senior Yuanxiu could only seek an unorthodox supplement. I do not know how he obtained the Pristine Water, but he intended to use it to temper the Upright Wood, in hopes of attaining a certain Wood Virtue."

He finally raised his eyebrows, a trace of melancholy in them. "He has no certainty, no method to seek the required Metallic Essence, only a sliver of speculation. He can do nothing but offer his own body to this path."

Ning Wan lowered her head silently. The storm created by the old man in the sky was growing more terrifying. He raised his head, his eyes bulging as he stared directly at the heavens.

His lips moved, and he finally spat out the severed finger.

The moment the finger left his mouth, it transformed into an infant, then a boy, and in the next instant, a dashing young man who bore a strong resemblance to Si Boxiu. This was undoubtedly him in his youth. The two figures activated their divine abilities and sat facing each other. In the sky, wood and water energies clashed, shaking the very heavens.

After a long moment, one of the blurry figures from the Underworld finally looked away, shaking his head in disappointment. He took out a net-like object, hiding it in his hand. "A pity. He doesn't know you can only spit that out *after* you succeed."

The other watched with cold eyes. "How could he know? He is no True Monarch Du Qing. And how many like True Monarch Du Qing are there in this world? True Monarch Du Qing only succeeded because he learned the methods of his predecessors. This man has no true inheritance. To borrow the power of Pristine Water at all is already impressive."

"And what if he did know? He wouldn't have the ability to succeed and then spit it out. If he had that kind of power, he wouldn't be in a state where he can't even greet us."

One of them seemed to catch something from the air, passing it to his other hand before scattering it outwards. Ning Wan noticed nothing, but Chi Buzi had already taken a step back, his expression complex as he watched the seeker in the sky.

Si Boxiu was rapidly withering. His hunched body curled into a dark ball like a pill bug, his high-quality robes being torn to shreds within it. Meanwhile, the younger man grew taller and more imposing. A triumphant smile spread across his face. He raised a fair hand and snapped his fingers.

*SNAP!*

All the wind, wood, and water energies between heaven and earth surged into his body.

His clothes became increasingly ornate and noble, while black veins spread across his face. His height continued to increase, and his appearance began to warp.

The man scanned his surroundings, then suddenly reached out and lifted the frail Si Boxiu. "You walked a true path," he laughed. "Why did you seek another?"

The crickets in Si Boxiu's pupils finally broke out, crawling down his cheeks. His lips parted and closed, forming silent words as the last wisp of life flowed from his body into the other's.

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

The man's appearance was magnificent, but the laughter that erupted from his throat was sharp and horrifying. The nearby Purple Mansion Realm masters all retreated a step. The two blurry figures vanished, and the last ray of sunlight disappeared from the world.

"Abomination!"

*BOOM!*

A massive thunderclap shook the world. The winds howled, and sheet after sheet of lightning illuminated the sky. In the piercing flashes of light that broke the darkness, a figure could be faintly seen standing in the east.

He had the appearance of a young man, tall and slender, with an unnaturally handsome face and faintly red pupils. He wore a black robe, with a white and green sash tied at his waist, his long black hair bound behind his head.

*BOOM!*

When the next bolt of lightning flashed, the man was gone. All the radiant lights of the divine abilities over the churning sea vanished simultaneously, leaving only endless darkness and the man laughing wildly in mid-air.



# Chapter 835: Seeking Guidance

The world went dim as the Great Void flickered. Ning Wan dropped Dantai Jin off on North Dan Island and flew for a thousand miles before the disquiet in her heart began to subside. Still, a cold sweat covered her body, and the lingering fear was palpable.

‘So this is a demonic fiend of Metallic Essence,’ she thought, her heart still racing. ‘No wonder the ancient records say that after the war between Immortals and Demons, these fiends ran rampant, and even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators couldn’t ensure their own safety. A great cultivator, empowered by divine abilities, could be killed in an instant… I always thought it was an exaggeration, but the reality is truly terrifying.’

The demonic fiend that Si Boxiu had become was likely of the Upright Wood dao, but it was mixed with some other unknown dao lineages, making it unnaturally horrifying. The sharp, majestic aura of Upright Wood, carrying with it wind, rain, and thunder, shot straight to the heavens with an intensity she had never witnessed before.

Such a fiend was born to live in the Great Void; outrunning it was impossible. At first, Ning Wan hadn’t fully grasped the danger. But when she estimated she wouldn’t last ten moves against it, a cold sweat of terror broke out. Only then did she notice that the surrounding Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were all fleeing, each faster than the last. Even Chi Buzi was nowhere to be seen.

‘No wonder the Metallic Essence creature inside Anhuai Heaven was able to catch that Purple Mansion cultivator off guard and devour him in one bite. A fiend born from Senior Yuanxiu's failed apotheosis is already this terrifying… A Metallic Essence creature left behind by a True Monarch… it must be no different from a True Monarch’s avatar!’

Still shaken from the experience, she was now on high alert, her senses sharpened to their absolute peak. At last, she detected a faint, azure shadow stepping through the Great Void. When it was still several dozen feet away, she snapped, "Who's there?!"

_Splash!_

A sheet of Pristine Water coalesced before her, and Chi Buzi stepped from the Great Void into the mortal world, now only ten feet away. ‘It must be the Chou-Gui Hidden Form,’ Ning Wan thought, a numbing sensation creeping up her spine. ‘The divine abilities of the Pristine Water dao are truly bizarre, capable of deceiving even the spiritual sense of a Purple Mansion cultivator. If Chi Buzi wanted to assassinate someone, anyone who hasn't crossed the immortal threshold of Purple Mystery would likely fall victim.’

Chi Buzi, however, simply smiled at her. "I came to ask fellow Daoist Ning," he said, "where is the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal?"

He had no ulterior motive. After all, Yuansu was dead, and the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal was an excellent treasure for trapping others. If he could borrow it, it would be a great help in his Demon-hunting endeavors. But the speaker may be careless, while the listener is not. Yuanxiu had just warned her before his death. The question struck Ning Wan with a jolt of fear.

"Reporting to Senior," she answered quickly, "when my elder fell, I was in seclusion. It happened that Lord Yuanxiu was also in Anhuai Heaven at the time. The seal was lost shortly after..."

"Oh?" Chi Buzi glanced at her, a smirk on his face. "What's the matter? Has the name of Azure Pond lost its weight? Or is Si Boxiu so incompetent that he doesn't even know who took it?"

In the next instant, understanding dawned on him. His expression turned grim. "There's a problem with that seal," he said coldly.

Ning Wan lowered her head, silent. Chi Buzi narrowed his eyes, took a step back, and studied her intently.

"Your elder... lost the seal. That is the seal of the Feathered Serpent. Is someone trying to use this as a pretext, using the methods left behind by the Feathered Serpent to destabilize the authority over Pristine Water?"

‘Please, just stop talking…’

The question made sweat pour down Ning Wan's back. She didn't nod, nor did she shake her head, simply standing in place as if she hadn't heard a thing.

But Chi Buzi was a man of immense cunning. In the past, he might have been tempted to serve Du Qing to the death. Now, however, he only wished for the two sides to cause as much chaos for each other as possible, so Du Qing wouldn't come looking for him. As for contacting the party that was making trouble for Du Qing, the thought never even crossed his mind.

‘Given Du Qing’s personality, the only way the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal could have gotten out is if it poses no major threat to him. At most, it's a minor annoyance. If I truly sided with someone trying to shake his Fruition Attainment over Pristine Water, I’d be the first to die a violent death!’

‘As for Ning Wan here, she needs to stay alive. It’s best to have a few Purple Mansion cultivators at Azure Pond to keep Pristine Water busy, so he doesn't think of me.’

He thus said, "Don't touch it. Your life depends on it."

Ning Wan nodded emphatically. Satisfied, Chi Buzi rose on the wind, a cold sneer in his heart.

‘I’ve witnessed the ceremony I came to see. Very good, a green-eyed ghost, is it? And you, mottled chicken… Your Lord Chi will have you join Yuse as a ghost!’

## In the World of the Mirror

A brilliant hall of shimmering light stood amidst pristine white clouds. The white bricks gleamed, and a jade platform was set in the center of the courtyard. A woman in tea-white robes stood guard, a stark white circular pattern adorning the spot between her brows, her expression reverent.

Beside her sat a white-robed immortal, his hand resting on the jade platform. Before him hovered a circular screen of light, the size of a washbasin. Within it, winds howled and lightning flashed, but the muffled roars were contained, reduced to faint vibrations.

On the other side of the platform, six jade slips glowing with a soft light stood arranged in a circle on a table.

Lu Jiangxian watched the changes in the mirror intently. He saw the handsome young fiend being bound by a gray Dharma Treasure, then slowly dissolving into points of deep green light that were dragged into the Great Void. The wind and rain over Shitang gradually subsided, but the once-clear weather had transformed into a humid, oppressive heat that seemed to radiate from the mirror.

He withdrew his gaze and pondered for a moment before picking up a jade slip. "He cultivated four paths of Upright Wood," he mused. "According to the Daoist scriptures in the archives, they were Journeying North, 'The Path Dedicated,' 'Scrutinizing Words,' and 'Carpenter's Measure'..."

"The fifth path he cultivated was 'Falcon's Roost,' from the 'Gathering Wood' dao... Perhaps he hoped to be accepted by drawing on the ancient scripture's description of Gathering Wood: 'Cultivators gather like a flock of birds coming to rest.'"

"The logic is not flawed."

Lu Jiangxian's understanding of the Dao was profound, and he quickly analyzed the core of the problem, sighing softly. "Among the Five Virtues, the paths of Dui (Dui Metal), Kan (Pit Water), Li (Li Fire), and Gen (Bound Earth) are True Positions. These so-called supreme True Positions are inherently complete and reject supplementation. But the Upright Wood dao is a position of accumulation and reception; it naturally welcomes supplements but struggles with excess."

"A clever idea. The 'Falcon's Roost' he chose fittingly casts the Upright Wood as a fierce, descending falcon, seeking to roost within the Intercalary Position of Gathering Wood."

He waved his hand gently, and the scenes replayed in the mirror. "It's a pity," he lamented. "His four Upright Wood paths were too dominant, and the Fruition Attainment of 'Gathering Wood' was empty, offering no branch to perch on. His method for seeking the Metallic Essecne was also a complete mess. Naturally, he failed!"

Though Si Boxiu had failed, his struggle and careful deliberation placed him in the top tier among the many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators attempting their breakthrough. It was a lamentable end.

He let the jade slip for 'Clear Dusk Rain' dissipate, yet one question remained. "But where did the 'Pristine Water' come from? Even if he had concealed a measure of Pristine Water within him beforehand, it shouldn't have been enough to make the heavens rain, much less the Clear Dusk Rain that represents the Fruition Attainment of Pristine Water. He must have used some method to borrow Du Qing's authority."

He looked down at his own palm in thought, replaying Si Boxiu's series of actions in his mind.

"Was it the Pristine Merging Owl Pool? The bird-like circling was a feint, a symbol of achieving Gathering Wood, and should have nothing to do with Pristine Water... As for swallowing the finger..."

Lu Jiangxian was almost certain that this method was not something Si Boxiu had invented on the spot! He must have been emulating the breakthrough method of some ancient Golden Core, or perhaps even Dao Embryo!

‘To have figured out the method of combining Upright Wood and Gathering Wood without a master is commendable. But to inexplicably cause the heavens to rain down Clear Dusk Rain, there is definitely something more to it.’

Thinking of using Gathering Wood to ascend was the limit of his own genius. But the finger-swallowing method... even Lu Jiangxian was stunned by it. It wasn't a symbolic substitution from within the Fruition Attainment process; it was a direct imitation of the actions of some ancient Golden Core or Dao Embryo cultivator!

‘The Sima Family truly has some hidden treasures… What else would one expect from a family that traces its lineage back to the ancient state of Zhou…’

Lu Jiangxian pondered deeply, murmuring, ‘A pity… he didn't know you're supposed to spit it out _after_ you succeed…’

Those were the exact words spoken by the Underworld emissaries. Lu Jiangxian had observed them with his spiritual sense; they were not the same two from Li Ximing's breakthrough, but likely the ones responsible for the Southern Sea or the Shitang region. They were just as bizarre-looking.

‘This means the Underworld also knows of this method.’

Although Lu Jiangxian could read Daoist arts, the most critical secrets were obviously encrypted or passed down orally. He would likely never know the full story. He didn't dwell on it. ‘There is still plenty of time… the clues will only multiply. I wonder what Chi Buzi thinks, having witnessed this. He values his own path to the Dao above all else; this should convince him that his future lies with my faction.’

In the time since Li Ximing had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the number of Daoist scriptures Lu Jiangxian had accessed had grown exponentially. Most importantly, he had obtained a small portion of the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition!

Daoist Master Yuandao’s lineage was well-ordered and meticulously preserved. Not only did the texts require sigils to decrypt, but each art had a corresponding oral incantation. Fortunately, the tradition was generous, and the library collections available to inner disciples were quite rich. Though they didn't touch upon many Purple Mansion Realm techniques, the knowledge Lu Jiangxian gained had opened his eyes.

‘Nine Mounds is a Supreme Yin tradition, so these Purple Mansion techniques are of little use to me. However, this narrative of the Three Profoundities is worth studying.’

According to the writings of the Nine Mounds tradition, there were originally three progenitor paths in the world of cultivation, known as the Three Profoundities: Azure Profoundity, Encompassing Profoundity, and Comprehending Profoundity. No matter how the great Daoist traditions of the world had changed, they could all be traced back to one of these three.

Jiangnan's famous Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and the Peacock Sea's Nine Mounds Daoist tradition, both originated from Azure Profoundity.

‘And according to the decree read by the Golden Feather Sect, both Luoxia's Wu Light and Golden Feather Sect itself are Comprehending Profoundity traditions. Almost all of Jiangbei follows the Comprehending Profoundity path.’

"As for Encompassing Profoundity, I have yet to find any orthodox lineage. There are quite a few who have obtained remnant inheritances, like the Capital immortals Dao and the Changxiao Sect, but they are not considered orthodox."

‘This explains the Capital immortals Dao's predicament in Jiangbei. Their tradition is completely different from the others, and they’re seen as foreign imposters. The only ones who could be considered distant kin, the Changxiao Sect, are sharpening their knives… No wonder Yehui didn't dare to stay long in Jiangbei.’

Having sorted out the system of the Three Profoundities, Lu Jiangxian suddenly understood the framework of the current era and the source of the subtle discrimination and prejudice among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

As for how his previous incarnation, the leader of the Azure Profoundity and Supreme Yin—who might have also embodied the Supreme Yang—had fallen to his current state, well, that was an interesting question.

"At the very least, this Mount Luoxia is almost certainly up to no good. While the Dragon-kin are slightly better, they are ultimately a different species. The road to recovering my strength is long..."

Right now, the fragment of his main body within the Secret Diffusion Secret Treasury was not an easy thing to retrieve.

‘The Secret Diffusion Secret Treasury hangs in the Great Void, perpetually sealed. It opens for only a few days each year, hanging there in plain sight, yet I cannot take it.’

With all eyes in Jiangbei watching, and Li Qianyuan forced into the open, Lu Jiangxian was too cautious to even show his face. He had no idea how many True Monarchs were surrounding that small territory and had no intention of trying to retrieve the fragment by force.

Moreover, everything from the surge of spiritual energy in Jiangbei to Li Qianyuan's reincarnation had been obviously orchestrated. Almost everyone on that path had been replaced by followers of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition. The Chengyun Gate was even controlled by Golden Feather people. The sense of danger was overwhelming.

"Perhaps, retrieving that fragment will depend on this True Monarch."

He flicked his sleeve, and the mirror and jade slips on the platform vanished. A speck of violet lightning appeared in his palm, his expression growing complex.

‘Li Qinghong.’

Li Qinghong was one who had received a talisman from him. Back then, she had entered the Grotto-Heaven with Zikang. Lu Jiangxian had watched her fight her way from the south of the Grotto-Heaven to the north, all the way to the Hall of Thunder.

Finally, she had laid eyes on the endless draconic form of Beijia.

Li Qinghong had transformed into a Thunder Body by consuming lightning, but the connection through the Talisman Seed had not been broken. In fact, Lu Jiangxian had even received some feedback from it, though it only slightly enhanced his spiritual sense—better than nothing.

Although Lu Jiangxian only had a vague understanding of the Dragon Monarch Beijia's plans, planting such a key pair of eyes among the Dragon-kin was an excellent move. Even if Li Qinghong could only guard the Thunder Pool, it was enough for Lu Jiangxian to glimpse a piece of the puzzle.

‘This Dragon Monarch Beijia is not only extremely ambitious, wanting to become a True Dragon, but he is already preparing to assail the Dao Embryo realm!’

The matter of True Dragons involved that 'Azure Profoundity Son,' but no matter how Lu Jiangxian looked at it, a True Dragon was an existence at least above the Dao Embryo realm.

"Something that even a True Hornless Dragon at the peak of the Dao Embryo realm could not achieve back then, how could it be done without the authority of a Dao Embryo? Although the Dragon-kin have improved generation by generation and have been plotting for ages, to continue the great undertaking of their predecessors, one must at least reach the Dao Embryo realm."

He pondered for a long time before finally looking at Shaohui, who had been waiting patiently.

The Lesser Yin Celestial Attendant immediately bowed. "Reporting to the Mansion Lord, your subordinate has completed the composition of the 'Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity.' It is complete with a table of contents and contains body arts and spell arts sufficient to cultivate a divine ability. I have come to offer it to the mansion's library!"

The Lesser Yin Celestial Attendant was formed from the Sparrow demon Fuyu and had cultivated the Lesser Yin in her past life. When Lu Jiangxian, speaking through the Zhengao, had tasked her with compiling a scripture, the Celestial Attendant had been quite earnest, organizing the entire scripture from her past life that had led to her divine ability.

This was no small feat. After all, she had been a Demon beast before and now had a human body. Without a decent grasp of Daoist arts, organizing such a thing would have been difficult. Lu Jiangxian took it and glanced through it, nodding to himself.

‘Her efficiency is much higher than Dangjiang's!’

The 'Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity' led to the 'All-Fragrance Sinks' divine ability, a rare fourth-grade technique. Given Shaohui's own limitations, pushing this technique to the Purple Mansion Realm was her limit, so it naturally wasn't of the highest grade. Lu Jiangxian gave a slight nod. "It is adequate," he said casually.

One cannot make bricks without straw. After finishing this scroll, asking Shaohui to write another Purple Mansion Realm technique would be asking too much. "There are still Daoist scriptures in the mansion's library," Lu Jiangxian said. "Read them well. There is much to do over with Zhengao. Manage things properly."

The woman in the tea-white dress quickly withdrew. Lu Jiangxian thought to himself, "Given Chi Buzi's efficiency, Northern Buddhists are about to suffer!"




# Chapter 836: A Meeting of Two Sects

"On the twenty-first of mid-spring, Daoist Master Yuanxiu of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition attempted his ascension at Stonetang Atoll in the Southern Sea. Heavenly thunder roared and colossal waves surged, but he failed. As the elements raged, malevolent forces emerged, and he was ultimately bound and slain by the Underworld."

"Three days later, the winds died, the rains fell, and the spiritual energy of the Southern Sea was forever altered."

Li Jiangqian stared at the letter, his mind reeling in disbelief. He read the words again, but they made no more sense than the first time.

'So abrupt…' he thought. 'There was no decree, no invitations sent to observe the ceremony. He just… suddenly went to the Southern Sea for his breakthrough. I wonder how his tribulation compared to those of the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.'

He clutched the letter, his thoughts racing.

'Then again, it's hard to say. News might have circulated among those at the Purple Mansion Realm, far beyond the reach of a minor cultivator like myself. I heard Daoist Master Yuanxiu cultivated the path of Upright Wood. That would explain the recent period of abundant resources in the Southern Sea.'

He turned the letter over and read the next line:

"Fairy Autumnlake has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, achieving the Frigid Animus Divine Ability."

Though the message was brief, its implications were immense. Ning Wan’s cultivation method was far more well-known than Yuanxiu’s. The Daoist Master’s Upright Wood path was a rarity, unlike any conventional cultivation of the wood element, so few understood his divine ability. Ning Wan, however, had been famous even during her Qi Refining days. The Frigid Animus was a common Daoist tradition in Jiangnan; its power evoked blizzards, and even whispers from the Azure Pond Sect spoke of its might.

'The Azure Pond Sect is about to change hands.'

The Si family had few descendants, and their grip on the sect was already tenuous. Now, with Yuanxiu dead and Si Yuanli in seclusion, Dantai Jin and Tongyi would have no choice but to take their cues from Ning Wan.

At his side, Li Xuanxuan understood immediately. He smiled, stroking his beard. “Send a congratulatory gift at once,” he urged.

This was excellent news for the Li family. Li Jiangqian’s spirits soared as he summoned an attendant. “I recall we have a portion of Pinefrost Dew in the treasury,” he began. “Though it’s only a Foundation Establishment Realm spiritual item, it aligns perfectly with her cultivation. Also…”

He paused, considering. Most of the family’s valuable assets were currently with Li Ximing, leaving them with little to offer that was truly impressive. Yet a gift like this could not be delayed; its timeliness was as crucial a sign of sincerity as its value.

“Years ago, Father brought back a basket of Riverstream Pearls. They’re quite precious. We planned to refine them into a set of Dharma artifacts, but the sheer number—a full sixteen of them—made it too difficult, so they’ve remained unused. Why not... send those as the gift?”

Li Xuanxuan winced at the suggestion. There was a reason that basket of pearls had never been refined: it was a set of sixteen individual Foundation Establishment Realm spiritual items, all with interconnected auras. The frugal old man couldn't bear the thought of giving away something so valuable. “That gift is far too extravagant,” he said, hesitating. “It’s on par with something a Purple Mansion Realm master would give personally. And it would be a terrible shame to break up the set. Let’s think of another way…”

Li Jiangqian nodded. He had hoped to put the Azure Pond Sect further in their debt, his thoughts secretly drifting to Li Xuanfeng’s heirloom, White Lightning. The artifact was likely a spiritual artifact in its embryonic stage, but whether anyone could wield it was another matter... Still, since Li Xuanxuan had spoken, he would naturally defer.

“Then transcribe a copy of the *Frigid Pine Dewy Snow Art* and send it to the Daoist Master,” Li Xuanxuan instructed. “Also, make it clear that our family’s Daoist Master is cultivating abroad and is unaware of matters on the mainland. He cannot pay his respects in person but will certainly make amends in the future.”

Li Jiangqian added, “We should have Li Chengpan lead the delegation, with Master Cui accompanying him, to show the importance we place on this.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded slightly. “And summon that rascal Zhouming and Li Chenghao as well!”

Li Chenghao was one of the few remaining Qi Refining elders of the main family branch and the paternal uncle of the Li Zhoufang brothers. He had once made things difficult for Li Zhouluo and been demoted to managing affairs in Milin Prefecture, but he was recalled the moment tensions with the Capital immortals dao rose.

Li Xuanxuan’s reasoning was clear. Of the Xi generation, their family had one Purple Mansion Realm master: Li Ximing. Below them, in the Chengming generation, Li Chenghuai was set on going to the Southern Sea. That boy had the heart of a true seeker and couldn't be held back. That left only Li Chenghao and Li Minggong. Li Xuanxuan had summoned him now precisely so that Li Jiangqian would entrust him with more responsibility.

The three were all on the island, and they arrived soon after being summoned. Li Chenghao was at the front, his expression stern and his robes immaculate. Li Zhouming, dressed in vibrant red, was his complete opposite, sauntering along behind him. Bringing up the rear was Li Chengpan, his head bowed.

When Li Jiangqian explained the situation, Li Cheng’s face lit up. “A truly joyous occasion! You can leave the matter to me!”

Years ago, Li Chenghao had caused trouble for Li Zhouluo while trying to protect Li Chengpan. His heart was fiercely loyal to his kin, and he had always felt the clan’s leadership was too harsh, a sentiment that had kept him from positions of power. Yet he was also the one who cared most for the family’s reputation. If an outsider dared to slander the Li name, he would be the first to fly into a rage. His competence was not in question, making him a suitable choice for this task.

'Besides,' Li Xuanxuan sighed internally, 'there aren't many left in the family who can properly represent us.'

His tone, however, was stern as he spoke. “Zhouming, you will go with them. Listen to your elders.”

As the direct grandson of a Purple Mansion Realm master, Li Zhouming’s presence would show adequate respect. The young man in red nodded repeatedly, a cheeky grin on his face. “Old Master, what are you saying? When have I ever disobeyed? It’s always been whatever the masters say, goes!”

Li Zhouming had once put Li Chenghao and the others in an incredibly awkward position, and Li Xuanxuan worried there was still a rift between them, hoping more contact might mend it. Fortunately, the boy showed no signs of embarrassment, smiling broadly as if nothing had ever happened, addressing the others warmly as ‘Uncle’ and ‘Master.’

Li Chenghao, for his part, would not dare show him disrespect. Li Ximing, the Daoist Master who had single-handedly elevated their family to the status of an Immortal Clan by reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, rarely appeared, but his prestige among the clan was absolute. If Li Ximing suddenly demanded a new palace built for his leisure, Li Chenghao would be the first to start digging the foundations. He bowed with great solemnity. “Greetings, Young Master... Please, after you.”

Once the three had departed, Li Jiangqian couldn’t help but sigh in admiration. “Old Master, your painstaking efforts are truly something this junior respects.”

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard and shook his head. “Our goals are merely different. You focus on the clan’s worldly interests, while I only hope to mend the rifts between our branches. If we are not united within, any external gains are meaningless.”

Li Xuanxuan paused, about to ask about the situation in the north, when a purple mist began to suffuse the air over the lake, flanked by billowing clouds. A female attendant in purple robes approached and knocked on the hall doors. “Reporting to the masters of the Moongaze Immortal Clan,” she announced. “Daoist Master Tinglan of the Profound Grotto of Taixu Purple Qi Gate has come to visit.”

Li Jiangqian froze for a second, realizing that Daoist Master Tinglan, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, was visiting in her official capacity representing the Purple Smoke Gate. He immediately descended the side steps and bowed. “Greetings to the emissary of the Taixu Purple Qi dao. Our humble clan awaits the Daoist Master.”

At his words, the purple mist before the hall coalesced, and a female Daoist Master in autumn-yellow robes stepped out of the Great Void. Two faint, yellow floral markings at the corners of her eyes glowed softly. Li Jiangqian respectfully ushered her inside.

As she was a Purple Mansion Realm master, he led her directly to the seat of honor. The great doors swung shut behind them. Tinglan first offered a nod to Li Xuanxuan and engaged in some polite conversation—inquiring about the old master’s health and the clan’s prosperity. Li Xuanxuan was, after all, Li Ximing’s grandfather, and she paid him the respect he was due. Only then did she get to the point.

“I have already met with fellow Daoist Ximing in the east,” she began. “I have returned for two reasons.”

She inclined her head. “First, the spirit pill that fellow Daoist Ximing promised me has been successfully refined. The Purple Smoke Gate is not a tradition that goes back on its word. Our business overseas is largely concluded, so I will be bringing my people over to construct the defensive array for your clan.”

Li Jiangqian had no idea what kind of precious pill the two masters had concocted, but it must have been of monumental importance for her to repay the favor with an entire clan array. He cupped his fists respectfully. “We are grateful, Daoist Master!”

Tinglan smiled, clearly pleased. “The second matter,” she continued, “concerns Jiangbei. Daoist Master Qiushui of the Golden Feather Sect had originally sought Senior Yuanxiu for aid. However, the senior declined, citing his imminent breakthrough. Soon after, he staked his life in pursuit of the Dao and ascended. We are all part of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. To keep Jiangnan from descending into chaos, and to respectfully see the True Monarch off on his journey north, we must now turn our attention to the situation in Jiangbei.”

Li Jiangqian could only bow his head in deference. “Thank you, Daoist Master!”

Tinglan’s intentions were clear. The factions of Jiangnan wished to avoid being dragged into the unfolding chaos, and the collective of Supreme Yang Dao traditions had chosen her to manage the Jiangbei situation. Her presence at Moongaze Lake was a tacit acknowledgment that the Li family was considered part of their alliance.

'A blessing or a curse?' Li Jiangqian wondered. He knew well enough that the cultivators of the Supreme Yang Dao were an arrogant lot. They had held their territories in Jiangnan for centuries, their positions unshakable, and they looked down on both the Eastern Sea cultivators and rogue cultivators. The Li clan was only afforded a measure of courtesy because they held the title of Bright Yang and had been acknowledged as a righteous sect by the Immortal Mansion long ago. But for them to be truly accepted? Li Jiangqian didn't believe it for a moment.

'This must be a personal gesture of goodwill from Tinglan,' he concluded. The Jiangnan sects wanted the True Monarch’s activities to remain far from their borders, but the exact location of that border was flexible. By choosing Moongaze Lake as her base, Tinglan was subtly extending her protection over his family.

He waited for several moments, but Tinglan didn't press for details about Jiangbei. He was just about to broach the subject himself when a sound like falling snow rustled outside. Through the doors, he saw a woman in white step out of the Great Void. She wore a simple white dress, cinched with a delicate silk sash that accentuated her slender waist. Her features were gentle, almost demure, but her eyes held an icy clarity. The moment she set foot on the ground, a palpable chill descended upon the grand hall.

It was Fairy Autumnlake, Ning Wan!

'So, they were waiting for her!' Li Jiangqian realized. 'Even the Azure Pond Sect has to take a hand in this…' He quickly banished the thoughts from his mind, bowing respectfully to the newly arrived master before stepping back.

Tinglan rose to greet her, her expression polite but tinged with surprise. “Who could have been so foolish as to provoke such anger in my dear sister?”

Tinglan was only perhaps twenty years older than Ning Wan, and since both their families hailed from the Supreme Yang Dao, the familiar address was appropriate.

“Senior, you are too kind. You can just call me Wan’er,” Ning Wan replied. “And I’m not truly angry. It’s just… since I cultivated Serene Listen, dealing with the people in my own sect has become quite unsettling.”

Tinglan’s expression shifted to one of understanding. “Of course. Serene Listen is a Life Divine Ability. The power to hear the thoughts of others… it is bound to cause complications.”

Ning Wan offered Li Jiangqian a faint, kind nod, but with another Purple Mansion Realm master present, she did not speak to him further. She took a seat to the side and said quietly, “When my elder was alive, he had many strange moods I could never understand. Now that I have my own Life Divine Ability, I realize he was an exceptionally patient man. The stray thoughts one happens to hear... they can be profoundly disappointing.”

“It’s not that I actively pry into people's minds; Serene Listen doesn't work that way. But the moment someone harbors a malicious thought, the ability alerts me as a warning. It’s a protective instinct, much like a defensive Dharma Art that activates on its own to block an attack. But the things I heard… By the time I left the Azure Pond Sect, I nearly lost control and killed someone.”

Her face was grim, her normally gentle features frozen in a mask of cold anger. It was clear she had overheard a great deal within her sect, and the sight sent a fresh wave of fear through Li Jiangqian, who stood rigidly, staring at his own feet.

Tinglan gave a complex sigh. “The Azure Pond Sect is already in good shape, having been thoroughly cleansed by Senior Yuanxiu once. It would be far worse in a place like the Eastern Sea, where the moral climate is rotten. That senior I mentioned… he also possessed Serene Listen.”

Ning Wan had no desire to speak more of her own ability. She changed the subject. “Senior Yuanxiu… Daoist Master, were you able to observe his tribulation?”

“I was. I rushed back from the east and almost missed it,” Tinglan said with a long sigh. “Daoist Master Zimu of my Purple Smoke tradition was also there to witness it. He watched for a long time before simply shaking his head and uttering a single phrase.”

Ning Wan would not let such a chance to grasp a profound insight pass her by. Her eyes lit with anticipation. “And what did the Great Daoist Master say?”

Tinglan nodded. “The old falcon’s body is heavy; where can it find a branch to rest? A mountain chamber is easily shaken, but the Upright Wood cannot be moved.”

Ning Wan mulled over the sixteen words, but she could only grasp the most literal meaning: 'the Upright Wood cannot be moved.' She looked at Tinglan and said, “The Great Daoist Master’s cultivation has reached the level of heaven and earth. As expected of one who cultivates the Heavenly Purple Qi, his grasp of profound truths is far beyond our own.” After a slight pause, she added quietly, “I saw Daoist Master Chi.”

There was only one Daoist Master Chi she could be referring to: the long-missing Great Daoist Master, Chi Buzi.

Tinglan considered this for a moment. “A seeker of the Dao, so detached by his very nature. A true pity.”

Ning Wan seemed to have her own suspicions and didn’t press for an explanation of why it was a pity. Tinglan nodded with a smile, a faint purple light swirling in her hand. “Our meeting here today at the Li residence shows that we are of one mind. About the situation in Jiangbei…”

At last, she turned her gaze to Li Jiangqian. “What news does the Li clan have?”

Li Jiangqian dared not let his focus waver for a second, concentrating entirely on the matter of Jiangbei. “Reporting to the two Daoist Masters,” he said respectfully. “Jiangbei is currently in a state of chaos. Most of the sects have withdrawn their influence and sealed their mountain gates. The Xuanmiao Temple has taken the most drastic measures. They controlled few prefectures to begin with, but now they have activated their defensive arrays and recalled all disciples from abroad, as if intending to seal off their mountain entirely. The northern sects are pushing further north, and the southern sects are retreating south, leaving sixty percent of Jiangbei’s heartlands completely vacant. In many of these abandoned territories, demonic cultivators and Demon beasts are already on the rise, plaguing the land!”

# Chapter 837: The Curtain Rises

After Li Jiangqian finished speaking, Ning Wan quietly observed, "By allowing demons to run rampant, don't these Jiangbei powers fear being judged as villains by the True Monarch?"

Li Jiangqian hastily replied, "In the north, ever since the Golden Tang Gate's master, Situ Mo, fell, the sect has completely collapsed. It's in chaos, showing signs of splintering, and can no longer control the various powers under its jurisdiction."

A flicker of regret crossed Ning Wan's face. "If Xuanfeng had managed to hold on until today," she added, "his great opportunity would have arrived."

The Golden Tang Gate possessed the *Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra*, the very Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method that complemented the 'Engraved Gold Stone' technique Li Xuanfeng practiced. If he hadn't needed to rely on elixirs and had cultivated to this day, he might have had a chance to obtain it.

But Li Jiangqian was unsure of the Ning family's stance toward the Si family, so he simply nodded respectfully and changed the subject. "The Daoist Master of Chengyun Gate has some conflict with the Lotus Temple to the north and has taken his forces there. In his absence, a monk named Yaosa Chengmi has taken the opportunity to stir up rebellion, spreading the ways of Buddhist cultivation…"

Jiangbei had been overrun by Buddhist cultivators several times in the past, so their teachings already had a foothold and were popular among the common people, allowing them to spread rapidly. This kind of rebellion was not uncommon. Tinglan added with a smile, "I'd say this Daoist Master Changyun is quite capable. He appears out of the Eastern Sea, brings his sect to heel, and then gets entangled with the Lotus Temple. It’s all a show, pushing and shoving. That Yaosa Chengmi probably thinks he’s clever, believing Minghui is keeping the Daoist Master occupied for him."

Ning Wan seemed lost in thought. Seeing she wasn't going to speak, Li Jiangqian continued, "As for Xuanmiao Temple... they announced their Daoist Master is embarking on a long journey and that the temple will seal its mountain to face a tribulation. They've dismissed all their outer disciples and shut their gates."

"To the south, there's the Capital immortals Dao. Their Daoist Master has vanished, and now the various commanderies are showing signs of self-governance. The situation at Baijiang Creek is extremely volatile. My family has already withdrawn and is now in a standoff with the Capital immortals Dao across the river in Jiangbei."

The two of them were both Daoist Masters, so they understood the situation without needing every detail. Ning Wan remarked, "Everyone is certainly showing their true colors!"

Tinglan said, "After all the trouble your family has gone through, the lands of the three Secret Diffusion families at Baijiang Creek are indeed a suitable place for the True Monarch to build his power. What is the situation now?"

The 'three Secret Diffusion families' she mentioned were the Li family's Funan, the Capital immortals's Midong, and the sole survivor, the Brahma Cloud Cave. These were key areas under close watch, so of course she was informed. Li Jiangqian replied, "Since my family's dispute with the Capital immortals Dao began, the lands of those three families have descended into chaos. The great clans are still exercising some restraint, but people from the Eastern Sea and Southern Sea have stepped forward. A Daoist Huang and a Daoist Bai have both brought men, ostensibly to gather qi in Jiangbei, but in reality, they're using this opportunity to search for and seize spiritual items everywhere, making a fortune."

"On another note, I've also heard they are searching for a token... related to the Secret Diffusion orthodoxy."

He answered cautiously, but Tinglan just smiled. "That token you speak of... it does exist."

'It does exist.' How could Li Jiangqian not know whether it existed or not?

At a gesture from Tinglan, a woman in a purple robe approached, carrying a jade tray. She walked to Li Jiangqian and bowed slightly, allowing the black-robed man to see the object on the tray.

It was a token with a black base and intricate gold patterns, depicting ephemeral clouds and bowing malevolent spirits.

The token gleamed with a pure light, looking exceptionally precious. It was difficult to discern its material or grade, and faint wisps of black wind and white qi drifted over its surface. Li Jiangqian had seen his share of treasures, but one glance told him this felt like an artifact of the Purple Mansion Realm.

Even more remarkably, though its purpose was unknown, just looking at it conveyed a sense of noble authority that stirred the heart, kindling a desire to possess it.

'So they actually had a Purple Mansion Realm expert forge it... This thing is incredibly realistic. If I didn't know I'd made the whole story up myself, even with it right in front of me, I'd assume it was a secret treasure from some major power, just waiting for the right conditions to reveal its glory. I would never recognize it...'

Tinglan glanced at him. "This is the token," she said softly. "Take a good look, and make sure the Capital immortals Dao recognizes it too."

Li Jiangqian bowed. "I obey!"

He was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator; a single glance was enough to memorize it. As the purple-robed woman carried the jade tray away, Tinglan added casually, "This item has many wondrous uses. It would be quite something if a cultivator from the Eastern Sea were to obtain it."

Tinglan didn't elaborate further for him, instead turning to Ning Wan. "Ning Wan, do you... have any other arrangements for now?"

Ning Wan naturally shook her head. It was better to let Tinglan, who had been in the Purple Mansion Realm longer, handle the planning. The question was merely a courtesy. "The Snow Wings Gate has been sealed for many years," Ning Wan said softly. "Is there any news of them?"

Cultivating the Cold Qi, Ning Wan was clearly already planning her next steps. Tinglan shook her head. "The Snow Wings Gate has its own history. Since they've sealed their mountain, it would be inappropriate to disturb them."

Having given Ning Wan that reminder, which she accepted, Tinglan pointed out another path. "Now that you have reached the Daoist Master realm, the matter of Hongxue must naturally be handed to you. Wasn't Li Encheng protected back then for the sake of Hongxue's lineage? Now there's Li Quantao. Senior Yuanxiu sent him to guard the Hongxue ruins, but there hasn't been much movement."

"Once the news of your success came out, Senior Yuanxiu, who was also preparing to break through to the Golden realm, hastily recalled Li Quantao. He did it to preserve this path for you."

Ning Wan nodded in surprise. Tinglan continued, "Now that the True Monarchs is observing the mortal world, and the Hongxue ruins are located in the wilderness near Lake Xian, it's the perfect time to uncover the lineage. You can have him try. If he strikes it lucky, you'll gain at least two Purple Mansion Realm legacies, Water Mansion and Cold Qi. It's a worthy gamble."

"I specifically involved you in this matter with that consideration in mind."

Ning Wan was tempted.

Among the many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan, Tinglan was one of the most trustworthy from the Ning family's perspective. Her master, Daoist Master Zipei, and her Martial Uncle, Daoist Master Zimu, were both close friends of Daoist Master Yuansu. Daoist Master Zimu was even still alive, so it was natural for her to offer some assistance.

She replied, "I will dispatch Li Quantao and his son back to their ancestral land to stand guard. I'll also send his son to investigate the matter of the Jiangbei token and try his luck. However, I'm not familiar with the details of this affair, so I must trouble you, Senior."

"Of course." Tinglan nodded slightly. "I'll send Qianli to observe the situation. If anything goes wrong, I can simply extract the two of them. We must protect the descendants of Hongxue."

The more Li Jiangqian listened, the more uneasy he felt. For Daoist Master Tinglan to bring this up here and now made her intentions obvious. Sure enough, the Daoist Master looked over with a smile and instructed, "This is not to be known by others."

How could Li Jiangqian not understand that this was directed at him? He bowed. "This subordinate understands."

The Moongaze Li Clan had a good relationship with Li Quantao. If Li Quantao were to come to Lake Xian, he might contact the Li family, learn about the situation in the north, and grow suspicious of the Ning Clan. While this wouldn't endanger Li Quantao's life—and might even benefit him—it was best for him to remain ignorant if they were to claim the Hongxue legacy.

With the matter settled, the two Daoist Masters departed for the Great Void, leaving only a letter from Li Ximing stating that the family had put Li Jiangqian and the other in charge.

Li Jiangqian respectfully saw the two of them off until they disappeared, then turned to Li Xuanxuan. The old man was stroking his beard, his brow furrowed in a deep frown.

Li Xuanxuan had surely understood the Daoist Masters' intentions. He held a great deal of affection for Li Quantao. He stood and said, "Think carefully before you act... Quantao once saved Zhi'er... Although... he is powerless in this matter. It would be better if Ximing were here; he could have a say. But he isn't, and we have no right to interfere."

Li Jiangqian replied, "You worry too much, my lord. The fact that the two Daoist Masters informed our family specifically shows they've considered Li Quantao's Wei-Li bloodline. But he is also a cultivator of the Azure Pond. With these two identities, the Ning family's reward will not be small. This is his good fortune."

Li Xuanxuan couldn't tell if Li Jiangqian was speaking this way because he suspected Ning Wan hadn't truly left, or if he genuinely believed it. He simply nodded and withdrew. Li Jiangqian, however, sank into thought. He summoned the Immortal Mirror in his mind, and only after confirming no one was in the Great Void did he dare to let his thoughts run free.

'With the Talisman Seed on me, Ning Wan's Serene Listen shouldn't be triggered even if I harbor malicious thoughts. But if she were to focus on listening... what might she hear?'

He pondered this for a long time, troubled. Just then, Li Minggong entered the hall, also with a frown. Clearly, she had learned of the messes her father, Li Xixuan, had made while she was in secluded cultivation to heal.

Seeing Li Jiangqian, Li Minggong asked about the visit from the Daoist Masters, then said softly, "I just received a report. The Daoist from Mount Jingyi has come out of seclusion. He read the letter we gave his mountain and wishes to see me. I told him to come here so we can question him together."

Li Jiangqian had his own questions. This Shouding had finally emerged. He quickly nodded and asked for him to be brought in.

A Daoist with narrow eyes soon appeared before them. His face was no longer as gaunt as when he was injured, but it was still pale. He bowed upon seeing them. "Thank you for the grace of the Moon-Gazing clan's shelter! Shouding will surely repay you upon my return!"

"There is no need for repayment." Li Minggong was polite enough, but after that one sentence, she fell silent in the main seat.

Li Jiangqian let out a small laugh and helped him up. "Years ago, Daoist Master Changxi entrusted Kong Gumo to Mount Jingyi's care. How is he now?" he asked in a low voice. "Daoist Master Changxi's foresight was incredible, managing to preserve that spark... My family was very close with the old Daoist Master. I wonder what instructions he gave your sect... He must have pleaded earnestly, ai!"

His eyes filled with sorrow, and he shook his head, one hand on Shouding's back, his voice thick with emotion. Moved by his tone, Shouding sighed. "Isn't that the truth! So the old Daoist Master explained it to your esteemed clan as well. Preserving that spark was the priority; the mainland was secondary. My mountain would have helped where we could, but then the great war broke out, and we had to let it go."

'Just as I thought...' Li Jiangqian sneered internally. 'So that was Daoist Master Changxi's plan. He told my family Mount Jingyi would help, but was vague about how much! Daoist Master Xuanyi only ever agreed to protect Kong Gumo!'

'And that Sumian, with his hypocritical act, secretly blaming Mount Jingyi time and again. Could that old fox not know? Adding fuel to the fire... I wonder what he was plotting. Wonderful... not a single one of them is any good.'

His expression remained unchanged. Not fully trusting Shouding's side of the story, he probed with a sigh, "For your sect to protect him so steadfastly, you must have a strong relationship with Profound Peak. In the east..."

Before he could finish, Shouding started waving his hands as if he'd seen a plague god. "You misunderstand, Clan Head! My lineage does feel sympathy for the old Daoist Master, but our relationship was never deep. We weren't familiar back then..." He paused, then explained further, "It's not as if our traditions are similar. We had only met briefly. It's just that Yuezhou Island is close to our mountain gate, and we urgently needed a market like that to attract talent and resources... which led to today's situation."

His words screamed, 'Don't you dare associate Profound Peak with us.' Seated above, Li Minggong sighed internally for Kong Gumo. "I see," she said softly. "What are the mountain's instructions? Is there any way my family can assist?"

This was a question about his future plans, and perhaps a polite way of asking him to leave. Shouding immediately became awkward. "The mountain... hopes I can stay on the mainland for a while..."

Shouding said this, then quickly tried to justify himself. "It... it won't trouble your clan. I've already imposed for years. My Daoist Master has some friendship with the Chen Clan. I will head south now, to Tongmo Prefecture."

Just from that, Li Jiangqian could tell the man was a clumsy speaker. He could have simply said he had business with the Chen Clan, but he had to say so much more. Seeing his oblivious expression, Li Jiangqian sighed to himself.

'If you dare go south, the Yuyang Chen Clan won't dare to take you in... Are you trying to scare their Daoist Master into coming out of seclusion? That would just create an awkward situation.'

This was a free favor waiting to be claimed. The Yuyang Chen Clan had a past relationship with the Li family; they had worked together to eliminate Wang Fu during the struggle for the Radiant Sky Stone. Li Jiangqian immediately smelled an opportunity. He smiled. "I see your injuries have not yet healed, Daoist friend. There's no rush. Why don't you let our guest elder examine your condition while I send a letter to the Chen Clan to inquire? Wouldn't that solve everything?"

Shouding was at a loss, but he couldn't refuse Li Jiangqian's enthusiastic offer. He could only nod and go find Sun Bai. Li Minggong looked over, a thoughtful expression on her face, as Li Jiangqian wrote two letters.

One was for Mount Jingyi, stating that Daoist Shouding intended to visit the Chen Clan but was temporarily being hosted by the Li family. The other was for the Chen Clan, with a similar message, saying he "suspected it might be inconvenient, and was thus writing to inquire."

He had them sent out immediately, then turned to Li Minggong with a smile. "It's a favor that costs us nothing. It's always good to be on friendly terms with Purple Mansion Realm powers. This saves the Chen Clan from future resentment, where they might feel our family should have stepped in to prevent an awkward situation for everyone."

The two discussed matters in Jiangbei until late into the night. Suddenly, they noticed the northern sky begin to brighten faintly. A pillar of intertwined black and white light shot towards the heavens, its presence immense.

Though it was too far to discern any specific aura, the intertwining black and white colors were identical to those on the token. It took no thought to realize a treasure had appeared.

'A Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master is truly different. So efficient!'

Li Jiangqian strode out of the hall, gazing north for a moment. He tilted his head as if listening, then pulled his black outer robe tighter and chuckled. "Men!" he commanded. "Prepare fine gifts! We're going to meet this 'Successor of Secret Diffusion'!"

Qu Bushi quickly appeared from the side, carrying a jade tray laden with several spiritual items. He followed closely at Li Jiangqian's side, a chill in his heart.

'What a disaster... so there really is some heaven-defying token. The overseas world is a storm of blood and gore, where the demonic path runs wild—it truly is vicious... And this mainland... though it looks bright on the surface, it's just as stained with filth...'

# Chapter 838: The Locust Ghost

Jiangbei, Funan.

The mountains in the Funan region were not particularly tall. In fact, all of Jiangbei had only three major mountain ranges. The nearest was the Golden Tang Gate’s Saber Mountain. Here, the terrain was gentle, and the highest point, Funan’s Main Peak, was barely a few hundred feet high.

"Funan's Main Peak" was a name given by the Li family. Ever since they had withdrawn from the region, taking the Cloud-Piercing Grand Formation with them, the mountain had been left empty. The rogue cultivators and demonic cultivators who flooded in afterward kept a low profile, silently occupying the abandoned cave residences.

They didn't dare rename the mountain, fearing they might displease the Li clan, so they all claimed to be merely "gathering spiritual Qi on the mountain." Besides, with so many rogue cultivators hiding out in the area, each claiming their own small territory, no one wanted to make waves.

A few months prior, a group of demonic and rogue cultivators had gathered to offer tribute to the Li family as a fee for "gathering Qi," but the offer was politely declined. The cultivators returned, feigning great regret, and within months, they had invited friends and allies, causing the cultivator population in the area to multiply several times over.

Jiangbei was simply too rich. Its lowest-grade spirit fields would be coveted and claimed territory if they were located overseas. Who would want to toil in the vast seas when they could live comfortably on the mainland, waiting for spiritual treasures to sprout from the earth with little effort?

And then there were the heart-pounding rumors that circulated in the shadows.

The Li family had always treated Funan as a buffer zone, a place for harvesting spiritual resources rather than cultivating a population. As a result, there were few commoners. With the arrival of these cultivators riding the winds, however, the number of cultivator descendants began to grow. Small sects and temples were established, and the area slowly began to resemble the untamed wilderness of the eastern shore.

It was a scene of peace and tranquility, until a brilliant flash of light tore through the sky, shattering the calm.

"Hahahahaha!"

An intense, swirling vortex of black and white light shot into the heavens. An old cultivator in black robes, suspended arrogantly in the air, threw his head back and laughed maniacally. Rings of ghostly light pulsed around him, casting him in a sinister, malevolent aura.

The light was so potent that it was visible across the entire Baijiang Creek region. One by one, cultivators took to the air, their faces a mixture of envy and astonishment as they looked up.

"I am Daoist Bai! Today, I have obtained the Edict of Abyssal Gloom and received the recognition of the Secret Diffusion Dao Lineage. I shall accept this inheritance and resurrect the ancient sect!"

As he spoke, dark clouds and lightning gathered, rumbling dramatically across the sky. The assembled cultivators stared, dumbfounded, glancing at one another in disbelief.

"Can the rumors be true? How can he be so brazen!"

"To obtain such a treasure and dare to reveal it so openly… Does he think the Capital immortals Secret Gate and the Moongaze Immortal Clan are mere decorations?!"

A wave of commotion spread through the crowd below. The old man in the black daoist robe held his head high, tendrils of black mist coiling behind him. Just then, a figure emerged from the clouds to the east—a young man with high brows and deep-set eyes, holding a Daoist scripture. He had the unmistakable air of a direct disciple from a major sect. His expression was cold, but he managed to force a smile.

"I am Guan Gongxiao, here on behalf of the White Ye Immortal Sect to congratulate you, fellow Daoist! The re-emergence of the Secret Diffusion Dao Lineage is truly a joyous occasion for the cultivators of Jiangbei!"

He inclined his head slightly and commanded, "Present the celebratory gift from my Immortal Sect!"

At his words, a subordinate stepped forward with a jade platter and presented it. The crowd below fell silent, and Daoist Bai’s tense expression melted away, replaced by a boundless joy.

‘The gamble paid off!’

He let out a low chuckle and accepted the gift without ceremony. Masking the greed on his face, he cupped his hands. "Greetings, Gate Master! My actions were not born of arrogance, but this Edict requires such a public display to re-establish the mountain gate. I hope you’ll forgive any offense!"

Guan Gongxiao gave a slight nod, displaying the magnanimity of a great sect. "I see!"

Daoist Bai wasn't sure what he meant by that, but his mind was already swimming with ecstasy. He proudly raised his head just as the clouds to the south parted, revealing a torrent of Li Fire. Another young man appeared.

This one’s eyes were a noble gold. He was draped in an outer robe embroidered with Li Fire patterns and stood upon the churning flames. His eyes were narrow, his brows set low, giving him a formidable appearance.

‘It's a golden-eyed direct descendant of the Li Clan!’

The reputation of the Moongaze Immortal Clan was formidable in Jiangbei. The tale of Li Zhouwei slaying the Golden Tang Gate’s master and departing with his spiritual artifact was still told on both sides of the river. The crowd recognized his lineage instantly. The golden-eyed noble spoke, his tone even.

"Congratulations, fellow Daoist. Moongaze offers the lands of Funan as a gift. Protector Qu!"

An old man appeared, also carrying a jade platter. The cultivators below were green with envy.

‘This Daoist Bai is incredibly lucky!’

Wreathed in the swirling black and white energy, Daoist Bai truly had the presence of a demonic titan. He returned Li Jiangqian's salute but said little, simply tucking the items from the platter into his sleeve.

Li Jiangqian studied him for a moment, noting the irrepressible joy on his face. The token’s influence was clearly significant. ‘I wonder if this is the True Monarch's influence or a Daoist Master's handiwork,’ he mused inwardly. ‘That expression, those movements, that uncontainable glee—he could be a stage actor.’

Beside them, Guan Gongxiao sneered. "Your family head is so generous. Can you still call Funan your territory? Gifting something that's already his—how shameless!"

Li Jiangqian shot him a venomous glare, his voice laced with ice. "Oh? Lord Guan isn't skilled in combat, but you excel at healing. It seems you've recovered quickly from the halberd blow my father gave you all those years ago."

Guan Gongxiao’s face stiffened. He let out a cold huff, and a gale began to whip around him as he clutched his scripture. His other hand, however, remained behind his back, not even forming a seal.

‘This Guan fellow is being so perfunctory…’ Qu Bushi thought to himself, unable to watch any longer. With a furious expression, he stepped forward and brandished his wooden staff, looking ready for a fight at any moment.

The animosity between the two factions was no secret; it was the very reason the rogue cultivators in Funan and Midong were enjoying such prosperous days. The confrontation was exactly what the onlookers had expected. They watched with keen interest as Daoist Bai chuckled and stepped between them.

"Please, give me some face, my lords. Today is a joyous day for my lineage."

As soon as he spoke, the tense, sword-drawn atmosphere vanished. Daoist Bai hadn't expected his words to be so effective, and a fresh wave of elation washed over him. He raised his head and cupped his hands toward Guan Gongxiao. "I will have to rely on the Gate Master's care in the future!"

The cultivators below were no fools. The meaning was clear.

‘The old man is siding with the Capital immortals Dao.’

Objectively, Daoist Bai's choice wasn't wrong. He came from a demonic cultivation background and had resorted to all manner of underhanded tactics. The Li family was famously righteous; how could they compare to the Capital immortals Dao, who also hailed from overseas and felt like kin?

He was already occupying the Li family's territory, which was an offense in itself. If he allied with them, he would be judged every time he used his blood-essence arts. And who knew if the Li family harbored secret ambitions to exorcise demons and defend the Dao?

The Capital immortals Dao, on the other hand, would surely support him in holding this buffer zone against the Li family. It was a sound choice.

All eyes turned to Li Jiangqian. The Li family's head had been publicly humiliated, and the icy expression on his face was enough to chill the bone.

Inwardly, however, Li Jiangqian was celebrating. He could see that although his rival Guan Gongxiao was smiling and nodding, every fiber of his being was likely screaming in protest, wishing he could slap Daoist Bai across the face.

‘Daoist Bai is nothing but a stumbling block on the path to the True Monarch realm,’ Li Jiangqian thought gleefully. ‘Now he's cozying up to Guan, and he'll drag the entire Capital immortals Dao down with him.’

Maintaining his cold facade, he seized the opportunity to dash any of their hopes. Without a second thought, he turned, flicked his sleeves, and departed.

Guan Gongxiao saw him leave without a backward glance and panicked. The man was quick-witted, though. He turned to Daoist Bai with an urgent expression. "That Li fellow left. Our two families are still in a standoff on the river. You go ahead and get settled. I must return to my post."

Daoist Bai couldn't possibly stop him and naturally let him go, even accompanying him for a short distance out of a misplaced sense of courtesy. The gesture sent a shiver down Guan Gongxiao’s spine.

‘How can I dare to gift him Midong now?’ Guan Gongxiao fretted as he flew. ‘The closer we get, the more he'll come to my home for aid…’

He flew faster and faster, practically fleeing the scene. Back in Funan, Daoist Bai turned to the cultivators below, a cold smirk on his face. "Fellow cultivators of Funan," he announced calmly, "I, Daoist Bai, have received the Secret Diffusion Dao Lineage here. It is my duty to establish this lineage and spread its teachings. Is there anyone among you… who is unwilling to establish this Dao with me?"

With that, he raised the token high. Streams of light shone down, and not a single person dared to move. Even his rival, Daoist Huang, stood pale and silent.

Who knew what divine powers that token possessed?

Daoist Bai threw his head back and laughed. He felt that by absorbing so many powerful cultivators at once, his strength could now rival that of a lesser immortal sect in decline. ‘Those righteous sects are so insular, only promoting their own year after year,’ he thought with smug satisfaction. ‘How can they compare to my all-embracing approach?’

He descended on the wind. Immediately, a sycophant scurried forward. "Gate Master, our Dao lineage ought to have a name."

Daoist Bai stroked his beard, pleased. He thought "Secret Diffusion" sounded unpleasant and had no intention of using it. "The inheritance is not yet complete, so it's not right to call it Secret Diffusion," he declared. "I cultivate the Locust Shade Ghost. With the combined power of all you cultivators, let's call it the Hall of the Locust Soul. What do you think?"

How could anyone object? The cultivators mumbled their assent and dispersed, awaiting individual summons from their new master.

***

Moongaze Lake.

Li Jiangqian rode the wind all the way back to the lake and landed in the main hall. Only when the doors were sealed behind him did a smile touch his lips. He rolled up a scroll on the table and looked at Li Xuanxuan's puzzled expression.

"A deranged madman with a bit of petty cleverness has Guan Gongxiao terrified," he chuckled. "And he can't even see two steps ahead. He's the one who lured that man here in the first place."

He briefly explained the situation to Li Xuanxuan. The old man simply stroked his beard. "No wonder Zhouming enjoys watching plays. The mortal world is just a stage, with one performance layered on top of another."

Though the old man was strict with Li Zhouming, often calling him a scoundrel or a beast, he clearly doted on him, letting the affectionate 'Ming'er' slip out. Li Jiangqian shook his head with a smile. Soon, Qu Bushi entered and reported on the events in the north.

"The Hall of the Locust Soul? Truly a character from overseas. Can't even pick a proper name." Li Jiangqian sneered. "It doesn't sound like anything good. 'Cave' would be the most he could claim… A 'Hall'-level power? Is he worthy?"

There were not many 'Halls' or 'Mansions' in the current era. There was the Northern Dark Mansion of the North Star Lady, which was a residence, not a power. The closest was the Shengbai Hall on the Great Western Plateau, now known to the outside world as the White Victory Dao.

‘The White Victory Dao claims the lineage of the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch, passed down by the demon Xiyan,’ Li Jiangqian mused. ‘It has produced two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, which is no small feat. What sort of character is this Daoist Bai to dare call his sect a Hall…’

While these naming conventions weren't strictly enforced these days, they still carried weight. A review of the last few centuries of records showed no power in either Jiangnan or Jiangbei that called itself a 'Hall'. Only the ignorant were fearless.

Now Li Xuanxuan also shook his head with a helpless sigh. "He's completely lost his sense of proportion. Does he think he's Daoist Master Chang Yun? He's only in the Foundation Establishment Realm. I fear he'll destroy himself long before the True Monarch has to deal with him."

Li Jiangqian shook his head. "I doubt it. He'll last a few years at least. After all, he is 'favored by fortune'."

With Daoist Bai acting as a shield, they could afford to wait and see how the situation in Jiangbei developed. Li Jiangqian had someone escort Li Xuanxuan out, then summoned another subordinate. "Daoist Master Ning is in Jiangbei. The people we sent to Azure Pond will surely find nothing. The Daoist Master cultivates Serene Listen. Recall them at once, lest they offend the immortal's presence."

As he sent the messenger off, his mind was already spinning with plans.

‘Li Quantao is on good terms with our family, and now he's getting involved in the northern affairs. The two Daoist Masters will certainly protect him. If he manages to obtain the Hongxue Dao lineage, Daoist Master Ning will be the main beneficiary, but Li Quantao will also gain greatly.’

After all, the Hongxue sect belonged to the Wei-Li family. Their lineage was strong; they had only been wiped out overnight due to the fall of Daoist Master Guansue. The Daoist repository they left behind must be substantial...

‘Li Quantao doesn't seem like someone who can reach the Purple Mansion Realm, but with these resources, anyone would be tempted to try. If he dies, there will be no need to protect the Hongxue descendants, and the Daoist repository will go to Azure Pond. If our Daoist Master can intervene, he can both watch over the Wei-Li descendants and perhaps get a piece of the pie.’

***

Eastern Sea.

The waters around Zongquan Island were calm, with a few fishing boats drifting on the surface. A blazing, golden illusion streaked across the sky from afar, kicking up furious waves.

Li Zhouwei had traveled straight from Lie Sea, making a stop at Crimson Reef Island to see the Deng family.

Deng Yuzhi had been overjoyed, practically inseparable from the artifact Li Zhouwei had given him. He had traded the White Yin Fan for it and even refused to accept the promised resources from the Golden Tang Gate, insisting the two items were now of comparable value and there was no need for the extra trouble.

He had happily brought his son out—a lively boy named Deng Buyan. Father and son escorted Li Zhouwei far out to sea, inviting him to visit again next year.

Li Zhouwei could only marvel at their sincerity. He followed the water veins, stopping at two market-islands without finding anything of value before continuing on toward the Vermillion Sea and Zongquan.

Riding the Profound Light, he approached the island and paused, taking stock. The island seemed a fair bit larger than he remembered. Feeling a flicker of doubt, he didn't descend immediately.

However, the cultivators on the island recognized him. Soon, a white-haired old man rode the wind to greet him. It was Zong Yan.

Zong Yan was the original master of Zongquan Island, having scraped by in humiliating servitude under the Hui Clan. After Li Yuanjiao arrived, he had remained to help manage the island. Li Zhouwei had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm here, so the old man knew him well. He came to the edge of the defensive array to welcome him but did not open it.

It was a Li family rule, a precaution against demonic cultivators using transformation arts to trick their way in. Li Zhouwei deactivated the array and entered. The old man bowed respectfully. "My lord…"

Li Zhouwei waved his hand. Zong Yan was an earth-nurtured child with no descendants. He had an adopted son who was killed by a demonic cultivator two years prior, and he hadn't taken another since. He lived a solitary life, yet his mindset was good.

At least he didn't have to worry about being eaten.

Li Zhouwei glanced around, setting aside his earlier question for a moment. "Old senior, how old are you now?"

Zong Yan understood what he was asking and sighed. "I reckon I have another twenty or thirty years left…"

The earth-nurtured children from the Nurturing Spring on World's Navel Island could not pursue an immortal foundation. Zong Yan had been stuck at the late stage of Qi Refining for many years, simply waiting to die. Li Zhouwei made a mental note and returned to his original question. "Why does Zongquan seem larger than before?"

"My lord," Zong Yan replied, "a few years ago… there was a great movement in the earth's veins to the north. A great, rolling cloud of smoke. Many of the surrounding islands were affected. Zongquan is on one of those lines. Not only did the island grow, but the defensive array was also impacted and has become much weaker."

Li Zhouwei now understood. He pinched his fingers, calculating the direction. "No wonder. The market-city of Purple Smoke is to the north. So they're on the same vein."

Zong Yan nodded eagerly. "Exactly! A few years back, Miss Queyi joined the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate. She visited Zongquan once to ask if the island lacked anything. She's on duty at the nearby market-city and is usually very busy."

"Queyi…"

As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Li Zhouwei had a good memory for names. He recalled her in an instant—a gentle, soft-spoken girl who was very likable. A rare smile appeared on his face. "So she's been recognized by Purple Smoke. Good. I have some spare things on hand. I'll make a trip to the market-city."

He left some low-level spiritual materials he no longer needed on Zongquan and flew northwest. After some time, he saw a vast expanse of purple—a large island floating before him.

It was the Purple Smoke Gate's New Rain Archipelago.

The place had once been a single large island, but the shift in ley lines had transformed it into a cluster of reefs. It was bustling with people, and many smaller powers had set up outposts. Li Zhouwei watched for a moment, then smiled faintly and descended as a streak of light.

Near the market-city, a young woman in purple stood on a dark, violet reef. Her face was round and cute. Her hands were formed into the shape of a small flask, drawing in the colorful light shimmering above the sea's surface with intense concentration.

After a few breaths, a wiggling strand of rainbow light fell into her palms, swimming like a fish before she carefully bottled it in a jade vial. Suddenly, a deep voice sounded beside her.

"What are you doing?"

The round-faced woman quickly turned her head and saw a tall man standing beside her. He was clad in soft gold and white armor inscribed with black, esoteric patterns. Though a faint smile played on his lips, his eyes held a natural authority that commanded respect without anger. In his hand, he held a halberd, standing effortlessly in the air above the sea.

"Uncle?!"

Li Queyi's eyes widened in disbelief, and the jade vial nearly slipped from her grasp. Joy flooded her face. "My lord, it's so good to see you're safe!"

Coming to her senses, she answered his question before he could ask again, speaking respectfully, "I am merely collecting the purple qi of the azure heavens to complete a sect mission."

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei nodded slowly. His mere presence seemed to emanate waves of warmth. After being alone for so many years, Li Queyi had never felt so secure. Even the magical wind beneath her feet felt more solid. "Uncle, are you here to…"

Li Zhouwei didn't answer right away. He glanced at the jade vial in her hand. "Instead of having you cultivate in the sect, Purple Smoke sent you out here to gather qi? How much time does this take each day?"

"I chose this myself, for the experience," she replied quickly. "It's only half an hour a day. This month, my senior sister, who shares my duties, is in seclusion, so I'm covering for her. It takes an hour."

Li Zhouwei seemed dissatisfied with this answer. Thoughtfully, he relaxed his grip, and the long halberd vanished. He raised an eyebrow. "Is this really for experience? Where are your senior brother and your Master? Has the family arranged for anyone to watch over you?"

Li Queyi hesitated. "Master and Senior Brother are in the sect. I felt the peak was a bit oppressive, so I came to the sea. There's work to do, but it's very quiet."

"Quiet?"

Li Zhouwei immediately sensed something was wrong. Seeing her lower her head, he wondered who in the family was in charge of her affairs and whether they had made the proper arrangements. After a few more questions, Li Queyi replied, "It was Uncle Zhouluo, some time ago."

Li Zhouwei understood. "Come," he said in a warm voice. "Take me to see the person in charge. I'll handle this for you."

At his words, Li Queyi's eyes turned red. She led him inside, explaining everything in bits and pieces along the way.

The buildings of Purple Smoke were brand new, clearly recent constructions. Faint patterns on the ground glowed with a soft light. The cultivators they passed all smiled and nodded at Li Queyi, showing their good relationship with her, but they whispered amongst themselves when they saw Li Zhouwei. Many of them clearly recognized him.

A middle-aged man descended from a higher level. His eyes were bright and sharp, and two talismans, one gold and one white, hung from his waist. He looked at Li Zhouwei with a mixture of shock and awe before bowing.

"Wen Wu of Mu Zuo Peak, greets you… my lord!"

The title 'my lord' was a great sign of respect, showing he saw him as a future Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. It was Li Zhouwei's first time meeting the man, and he found that despite his ordinary appearance, his demeanor was quite remarkable.

"So it is fellow Daoist Wen," Li Zhouwei said warmly. "I am Li Zhouwei of Moongaze."

No more needed to be said. Wen Wu, his suspicions confirmed, hurriedly led him upwards. With Li Queyi in tow, Li Zhouwei explained with a smile, "I have been away from the lake for many years. Only recently did I learn that a direct descendant of my family was favored by Purple Smoke, so I came to visit. I happened to run into her gathering qi… after waiting for quite some time, we came to pay our respects to the Immortal Gate together."

"I see."

Though the words were polite, they made Wen Wu's scalp tingle. He looked hesitantly at Li Queyi and said kindly, "Queyi has always been a diligent and obedient disciple. It is the fortune of Ziqi Peak to have her."

Li Queyi glanced at Li Zhouwei's back. The senior family member nodded. "Ziqi Peak… I remember now. That's Ling Yanzi's peak."

Their exchange ended. Led by Wen Wu, Li Zhouwei took a seat in the main hall. Purple-robed disciples immediately came forward to serve tea. Li Zhouwei did not drink it.

"Ziqi Peak is poor… and not very peaceful, is it?" he asked.

Wen Wu understood perfectly. But he had been urgently dispatched overseas and hadn't even known Li Queyi had come out ahead of schedule. He could only let out a long sigh and explain, "This matter… I must explain it to you properly, fellow Daoist."



# Chapter 839: Chaos Stirs

Although Li Zhouwei’s tone was calm and even, Wen Wu was no fool. How could he not sense the dissatisfaction when the man refused his tea, skipped the pleasantries, and opened with a comment about things not being ‘peaceful’?

This was no good-tempered master before him. Wen Wu had been stationed in the Eastern Sea years ago and had met Situ Mo, secretly considering him a formidable figure of their generation, a shoo-in for the Purple Mansion Realm. Yet, in the hands of the White Qilin standing before him, Situ Mo had been as helpless as a chick. How could Wen Wu not be terrified?

This wasn't just a matter of offending a peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator; this was clearly offending a future Purple Mansion Realm expert!

Ziqi Peak had made this mess, yet he, Wen Wu, was the one left to deal with it. As the intermediary, he did have some obligation to see to things. A bitter taste filled his mouth. Desperately searching for a solution, he began to speak, trying to stall for time.

“Ziqi Peak… it was once quite glorious. But after certain events, it fell on hard times. It holds little standing in the sect now, and they’ve grown accustomed to hardship. The peak itself is not very tranquil… ahem! My fellow disciples there are not the most steady individuals. It’s true that things aren’t always peaceful…”

He quickly tried to mend the situation. “However, training in the overseas territories is a sect assignment. Your clan’s Li Quexi is a junior disciple of my Mu Zuo Peak. She is currently in seclusion, breaking through to the next stage. In a few years, she too will need to come out and experience the Eastern Sea, lest she become too sheltered. Li Queyi can complete her two years first, and then she won't have to venture out anymore.”

He adjusted his robes, the movement causing the two Spiritual Talismans on his lap—one white, one gold, both glowing with a soft light—to settle on his thighs. Li Zhouwei glanced at the bowing Li Queyi and understood.

‘So Wen Wu’s Mu Zuo Peak took on a disciple specifically to foster good relations between the Li Clan and Purple Smoke. Ziqi Peak was never the priority. For Purple Smoke to devote resources to one direct descendant of the Li family is already giving us considerable face; any more would not benefit their future. And Queyi isn't the type to fight for it…’

‘Besides, if I were in Purple Smoke’s position, I’d also be more inclined to take a hands-off approach with a cultivator who values their family so much… It might not be intentional. With Quexi already there, and Queyi being so gentle and unassertive, it’s a convenient outcome for them.’

He lowered his hand and replied, “Queyi is the daughter of my eldest brother, Li Zhoufang, a direct descendant of our Yuandu branch. Senior Ling Yanzi is a good friend of our family and naturally looks out for her. But he is getting on in years, and it's normal for him to lose track of things sometimes. I am simply concerned that if these disciples of yours stir up trouble, it will harm the stability of Purple Smoke.”

Wen Wu shifted, embarrassed and uneasy. He knew the man before him was phrasing his words diplomatically only out of respect for Purple Smoke’s background. There was no avoiding this. “You are right,” he conceded. “The supervision of those peaks has been lax. The discipline has indeed gotten poor, and it needs to be corrected…”

Li Zhouwei chuckled and shook his head. “That would be difficult for you to manage, wouldn’t it, Daoist Wen? I am not familiar with the internal affairs of your peaks, but I doubt it has reached the point of needing a full-blown rectification. There’s no need to make a scene. Queyi doesn’t care for commotion; she is fine here in the overseas territories. Let things proceed as they should…”

Rectify the discipline? Li Zhouwei had no intention of making Li Queyi the target of everyone’s resentment. The girl had never mentioned this to the clan, precisely because she feared ruining the relationships within her peak. He wouldn't put her in such a difficult position.

“Besides,” he added casually, “Purple Smoke follows the Supreme Yang Dao. How could its culture be anything but righteous? Even the cultivators of Jiangnan wouldn’t dare to underestimate a blessed land like yours. My family’s Daoist Master also has a good relationship with Purple Smoke. Queyi being in the Eastern Sea is for the best. The Daoist Master is nearby and can look after things.”

At these words, a genuine sweat broke out on Wen Wu’s brow. He understood Li Zhouwei’s meaning perfectly.

‘*Today, it’s me, Li Zhouwei, who has come, and I’m willing to give you some leeway. But Daoist Master Zhaojing is also in the overseas territories. If, on a whim, he were to stumble upon this… wouldn’t you, Wen Wu, lose a layer of skin?*’

Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing, was known to be good-natured, but that was his attitude toward fellow Purple Mansion Realm masters. If Li Ximing had come today and personally witnessed a direct descendant of his clan doing menial qi-gathering work, and if Li Queyi had burst into tears and knelt before him, Wen Wu would have had to remove his own cap, bind his hands, and kneel before the master of Tinglan Seat!

But was today any better? Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes were fixed on him, and they held no shortage of frost.

Wen Wu no longer felt like he was riding a tiger; a chill was creeping into his heart. He immediately said, “This isn’t about the sect’s disciples. It was my negligence. I was busy with other matters, which led to you having to come and ask… It is truly…”

Li Zhouwei, still showing no sign of anger, replied, “You misunderstand, Daoist Wen. I simply came to see my junior, check on her, and browse the market…”

He waved a hand, leading Li Queyi out. The tea on the table remained untouched. Wen Wu hurried after them. “What about Queyi’s arrangements going forward…”

Li Zhouwei smiled. “A Daoist Master wishes to see her. She will remain here among the reefs. No need to transfer her.”

Wen Wu could only nod, escorting them down from the main hall. When Li Zhouwei politely declined his offer to accompany them further, Wen Wu could only turn back, his heart weary and bitter.

‘That bunch of idiots from Ziqi Peak…’ he cursed internally. ‘I just got assigned here, and they dropped this huge pot of blame right on my head! If it weren’t for the respect I owe to old Senior Ling Yanzi… I’d have given those bastards a sound thrashing!’

Still uneasy, he thought, ‘I must send a letter to my master… and inform the Daoist Master in advance… These powerful figures don’t listen to reason when it comes to family. When the time comes for blame, I won’t even have a chance to explain…’

*

As Wen Wu departed, Li Zhouwei led his junior into the market. He enveloped them both in a soft glow, separating them from the bustling crowd. Only then did he speak in a low voice.

“Queyi, you handled this matter incorrectly.”

Li Queyi, who had been on edge the entire time, bowed in apology. Before she could voice her regrets, Li Zhouwei stopped her with a gesture. The man in white and gold armor said, “You are a direct daughter of a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan, yet you are far too gentle. Forget immortal sects, anywhere you go, if you are merely polite and kind, gentle without a hint of authority, people will always doubt you… You take one step back, and they will see you as a pushover. Then they will take a step forward, certain you won’t bare your fangs and bite. The most they expect is a reprimand, so they will kneel and beg. If begging doesn’t work, they’ll cry. As long as they see you might soften, the benefits they can squeeze from you are worth more than a little lost pride.”

Li Zhouwei casually surveyed the many spiritual items in the market. “You must carry yourself with an air of authority. You must learn to frown. These cultivators, once they have a status that makes you care about their feelings, will hope to suck a little blood from you. Even if they can’t, they’ll resort to petty tricks. Today, they claim an urgent matter and have you help gather qi. Tomorrow, they can go into seclusion, and when you come looking for them, they’ll be nowhere to be found.”

Li Queyi knew he was talking about her senior sister on the island. She nodded silently and murmured, “We are all from the same sect. Some of them knelt and wept while they begged… They said they had families, old and young, depending on them to make a breakthrough. I just wanted to help where I could, to soothe my own conscience.”

Li Zhouwei glanced at her. He knew that while she was intelligent, her nature was fundamentally gentle, making her easy to read. She lacked any sense of superiority. “Don’t think that by giving them some spiritual items, these senior brothers and sisters will remember your kindness. And don’t mistake them for being important. Maybe they’re just acting shamelessly, maybe they have grand ambitions… so what? What does that have to do with you? Why should you have to use your resources to support them?”

He took a silk pouch from his sleeve, one containing the wealth he had taken from Situ Mo’s body and exchanged for resources suitable for her cultivation level. He tossed it into her hands.

“Today, I was able to stand up for you, but that is only because our families have a relationship. Purple Smoke has an obligation to guide you, and they certainly shouldn’t stand by and watch you suffer. But once you leave this blessed land, once you are far from Moongaze Lake, no one will be watching over you every moment. If you are harmed somewhere, the most the clan can do is avenge you after the fact.”

“These resources are enough for you. Cultivate well. Your own strength is all that is real.”

Li Queyi nodded and replied respectfully, “I will remember your teachings, my lord.”

This was all Li Zhouwei could say. In Li Queyi’s generation, most of the Li family had been born into privilege and had grown up without vicious struggles. Such a disposition was inevitable.

‘It’s not a bad trait,’ he thought, ‘just ill-suited for the times.’

He finished his business in the market, having exchanged most of the goods he’d plundered. Soon, Wen Wu returned with others to invite him back. Li Zhouwei sent his junior away and suddenly asked, “Daoist Wen, you mentioned before that Ziqi Peak was once glorious… How did it fall to its current state?”

Wen Wu’s expression immediately turned awkward, as if the topic were difficult to broach. But after the earlier unpleasantness, he was here now to smooth things over. Hiding the truth would only seem insincere. He had no choice but to explain in a low voice.

“Daoist Li… Ziqi Peak once had a master who committed a dishonorable act. He later died… and his lineage declined. Senior Ling Yanzi knows why, so he never complains about the sect’s favoritism. Many in the sect are aware of the story…”

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully, clearly waiting for more. Wen Wu shook his head, looking pained. He dismissed the people around them and whispered, “This… this master’s Daoist name was Ting Qian. He once instigated an internal rebellion and was later suppressed and slain by Ling Shu… The details of the incident were contained within the blessed land, so the other major families don’t know much about it, only that a period of turmoil occurred… Ziqi Peak is his legacy. And Senior Ling Yanzi… is not only his martial grand-disciple but also his great-grandson.”

Li Zhouwei frowned. He sighed inwardly and said, “Senior Ling Yanzi has no heirs and recruits almost exclusively rogue cultivators. Surely the resentment from that rebellion ends with him?”

Wen Wu nodded repeatedly, hinting, “That was the sect’s intention in having Queyi join him. After all, his other disciples were raised by him from a young age, but their talent is limited, and none are suitable to inherit his position. Queyi can step in perfectly, and while she’s at it, give the peak a new name. Then the matter will be considered closed.”

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. ‘This Ziqi Peak is certainly interesting…’ he mused.

Wen Wu was unwilling to say more. Li Zhouwei exchanged a few more pleasantries, then rose into the air on a beam of light and departed from the market, heading for the sect’s spiritual spring to cultivate his secret arts in seclusion.

He had perfected his Imperial Command. Along the way, he had also progressed with his Great Fissure, bringing it to sixty percent completion, while his Myriad Arms Prefecture was at thirty percent. He estimated it would take him two or three years to master both.

As for his other secret arts, they would not progress as quickly, though he figured Primal Yang wouldn’t take too long. All in all, Li Zhouwei calculated that mastering four secret arts would take him at least three or four years.

“Four secret arts, and it only increases my chances by twenty percent. Time is tight.”

Not only was time a concern, but Li Zhouwei also had no Radiant Sky Stone to use. Though he was hailed as a future Purple Mansion Realm expert, cultivation was a personal journey. The more secret arts he could master, the better.

‘I fear the family may not be able to cope. I must also consider breaking through sooner.’

*

The Southern Sea, Shitang North Dan.

After Daoist Master Yuanxiu, Si Boxiu, failed his breakthrough here, the skies over Shitang had remained overcast for three days. The winds grew chaotic, blowing north one moment and south the next. Erratic gales swept across the regions, rising and falling without warning. At times, the winds were so strong that even low-level cultivators couldn’t control their flight, let alone the mortal fishermen at sea.

Muffled thunder rumbled intermittently within the clouds, entirely different from the downpours and rising thunder of the Eastern Sea years ago. Not a single drop of rain fell, leaving the entire sea region oppressively hot and humid, a place that made all who approached turn back.

The Ginseng-Timber Wood on the various islands ceased to sprout. Their leaves fell, leaving them bare, their hard bark exposed and dripping with condensation.

Amidst the raging winds in the clouds, a point of rainbow light hovered in the air. The figure within stared into the distance at the water vapor that was thick enough to condense, sighing deeply. He was trapped before an array, unable to leave.

In these recent days, cultivators found themselves with an abundance of spiritual resources, but life for the common people had become difficult. The damp heat seeped into their bodies, causing countless deaths.

Li Xizhi had been working on this problem for a long time. He had dispatched all the cultivators under his command, but their eyes were all fixed on the newly emerged spiritual items, their minds elsewhere.

Worse, with Yuanxiu’s death, Li Xizhi had lost his protector and now had to be constantly on guard. Although the Purple Mansion Realm masters of Thunder-Hearing Island might hesitate to act against him personally out of fear of Li Ximing, he could not afford to let his guard down.

Azure Pond finally had Ning Wan, another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but she was tied up with matters in Jiangbei. She couldn't possibly remain in the Southern Sea. She had only sent a letter, telling him not to leave the island.

Li Xizhi could only gaze out at the ocean and sigh, knowing in his heart that all his years of effort to save Shitang had been undone by the death of Daoist Master Yuanxiu.

‘Dantai Jin also came to North Dan, likely to witness Yuanxiu’s breakthrough. He was deeply grieved but will soon return to the Azure Pond mountains. Based on the messages he’s sent me these past few days, he intends to recall me…’

With the Azure Pond Sect having suffered several heavy blows, Li Xizhi was now one of its few remaining prominent figures. The recall was not unexpected. He could have ignored the world outside his island, but he wanted to save whom he could before he left, and the thought exhausted him.

“Grandfather!”

As Li Xizhi was lost in thought, a youth in black robes approached and bowed respectfully. Just as he was about to speak, Li Wushao rushed over from the side, followed by a horrified Quan Yuduan. Before either could say a word, Li Xizhi looked up, his expression turning grave.

Golden light pierced through the layers of clouds overhead. One by one, bare-armed Master Monks appeared, standing in the air with palms pressed together and pious expressions. Seated in their center was a golden effigy as large as a mountain!

“The Merciful One?!”

The entirety of Shitang North Dan had been surrounded by Buddhist cultivators. Dozens of Master Monks stood faintly visible among the clouds, while an incalculable number of monks stood upon the sea below, supported by some unknown artifacts. A serene, solemn atmosphere descended upon the entire area.

Quan Yuduan gritted his teeth, staring at the golden light above. “Master!” he said in a low voice. “It’s the monks from the Great Konghai Temple on Songzhou to the south! They have entered the sea!”



# Chapter 840: Baoqing

The sky was filled with Buddhist cultivators, their expressions as rigid and imposing as statues. Within the clouds, a brilliant golden light shone forth, revealing a colossal, golden-bodied effigy. Its face was serene—devoid of compassion, yet also of joy—as it loomed silently over the world below.

A palpable sense of fear and apprehension gripped the cultivators on the ground. The entirety of North Dan Island was bathed in the overwhelming radiance. Li Wushao took a step back with a deep frown, clearly repulsed by the celestial light. His face soured, and one could only imagine the curses running through his mind.

All eyes turned to Li Xizhi.

He remained perfectly calm. Crushing a jade talisman in his hand, he made a quick assessment before rising on a trail of rosy mist. Channeling his spiritual energy, he projected his voice, clear and strong.

"May I ask why the Great Konghai Temple has suddenly graced our Azure Pond's Shitang? I am Li Xizhi, Lord of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion."

None of the Master Monks in the sky answered. The Merciful One remained as still as a sculpture. Instead, a nun stepped forward, leading a contingent of her peers. Dressed in loose, dark monastic robes, she pressed her palms together and intoned:

"Our master, Lord of the Great Konghai Temple, through a profound karmic destiny, has attained the mystical Dao of the Five Skandhas and disseminated the wondrous teachings of the Three Vehicles. He has dispatched the Arhat Dharma Protector, the Merciful One and great cultivator of the highest order, Zhuzhen, to come and guard Beidan."

The moment she finished speaking, an uproar swept through the ranks of the Azure Pond cultivators.

The history of Buddhist cultivators was far shorter than that of Immortal cultivators, and their titles were consequently a mess of overblown and convoluted names. The Immortal Dao, by contrast, had inherited its traditions from a golden age in antiquity, and its conventions were firmly established. A cultivator in the Purple Mansion Realm was simply called a Daoist Master, and in many places, those in the Foundation Establishment Realm didn't even merit the title of Daoist.

This Buddhist cultivator, "Zhuzhen," was called both a "Merciful One" and a "great cultivator," titles that sounded ridiculously exalted. In reality, he was just a Merciful One. Many so-called "Great Master Monks" among the Buddhist cultivators were only at the level of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

What truly horrified the crowd was her final declaration—*to come and guard Beidan!*

What was the meaning of this? The Azure Pond Sect was, for all its troubles, part of the Supreme Yang Dao lineage. Although the Southern Sea had many powerful Buddhist and Daoist cultivators, and the Great Konghai Temple was backed by a Maha, there was no justification for such an arrogant, demanding attitude on another's territory. This was tantamount to a declaration of war on Azure Pond.

Li Xizhi raised his head, his eyes cool and composed. "I wonder what promise the Great Konghai Temple has received," he said in a measured tone, "and from which Daoist Master's immortal edict you derive the authority to simply take Shitang?"

"Beidan has received no such edict. If the Great Konghai Temple intends to seize Shitang while my sect is vulnerable after the fall of our Great Daoist Master, then forgive this junior for being unable to comply."

The nun in the sky returned his words with a cold glare. "With Lord Zhuzhen present, what right do people like you have to speak? Even with your great reputation as the Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow, do you expect a great cultivator to explain himself to you?"

Li Xizhi frowned. Seeing her obstinance and the way she twisted his words instead of listening, he knew they had come with ill intentions. Azure Pond was weak, and there was no way they could spare a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to intervene at this moment.

Just then, his wife, Yang Xiao'er, descended on a cloud of mist to his side. "Are all the members of the Great Konghai Temple so unreasonable?" she asked softly. "I am Yang Xiao'er of the Yang Clan from the Yue State…"

The nun was about to retort when the statue-like Merciful One in the sky finally spoke, his voice deep and resonant as thunder.

"So, an Imperial Scion."

His eyes were filled with a stern authority. "My Great Konghai Temple has crossed paths with Daoist friends Si, Tang, and Ning in the past," he said coldly. "Beidan itself was a treasured place where I discussed the profound mysteries with two of them. Shitang, moreover, was the very place where my master attained his enlightenment. A great battle was fought here long ago, and the three Daoist Masters declared that as long as they lived, Shitang would belong to Azure Pond."

He paused briefly. "Out of respect for the Azure Pond's lineage, my master promised to withdraw from Shitang. Now, your sect's karmic tie to this place has ended. We have simply come to take back what is ours."

Li Xizhi's expression darkened.

The Merciful One's meaning was clear: in his telling, the Three Yuans of Azure Pond had stolen Shitang from the Great Konghai Temple. Now that the Three Yuans were gone, they were here to reclaim it.

The sect's most secret archives were beyond Li Xizhi's access, but he had never heard any mention of Shitang being seized from others. If the matter had been so significant as to require the intervention of three Purple Mansion Realm masters, it was impossible that no record of it would exist within the sect. Even if this man wasn't lying outright, he was certainly omitting crucial facts.

But the facts no longer mattered. They were already surrounded, leaving no room for negotiation. They had come to strike while the iron was hot. How could Li Xizhi possibly debate the matter with a Merciful One?

Since they came with hostility, he dropped all pretense of politeness. "And what is it the Merciful One suggests?" he asked flatly.

Addressing him directly as "Merciful One" was a custom from Jiangnan. It was not common in the Southern Sea and carried a distinct flavor of the northern Buddhist Dao. The Merciful One's brow furrowed, and a Sanskrit chant escaped his lips. "My Great Konghai Temple has no desire for needless slaughter. Out of respect for Daoist Master Zhaojing and the Yue State, take your families and disciples and leave. Cede Beidan to us."

Li Xizhi fell silent.

Cede it? Or not?

The protective array on North Dan Island was formidable, but using it to resist a Merciful One was a fool's dream. Li Xizhi had no desire to die a martyr for Azure Pond, and he knew that Dantai Jin and the Ning Clan wanted him to preserve his life. He weighed his options, trying to gauge whether they would actually kill him.

'It wouldn't take long for Daoist Master Ning to get here from Jiangbei,' he thought, 'but notifying her is the problem. I've already crushed the talisman to alert Dantai Jin, but he might not have the nerve to immediately ring the bronze bell and summon a Daoist Master back.'

He quickly looked up. "We must have a Daoist Master's immortal edict to retreat," he said softly. "I must ask the Merciful One to wait. As soon as the edict arrives, I will have an answer for you."

For Zhuzhen to wait here would be a joke. The statement was a clear refusal. The golden light emanating from the Merciful One began to shimmer, a clear sign of his growing anger.

Furthermore, after so many years in the Southern Sea, it was impossible that Li Xizhi didn't know the local customs. His refusal to call him "Great Cultivator," using "Merciful One" again and again, was like adding oil to a fire.

"You've refused the easy way," the high-level cultivator snarled, "so you'll get the hard way!"

As he spoke, the surrounding group of Master Monks let out a unified roar. The sky thundered with a sound that shook the heavens. Li Xizhi swept his gaze across them and began to form hand seals.

A torrent of brilliant light descended from above as the Master Monks pressed toward the array. Li Xizhi remained motionless, but a host of rosy-hued doppelgangers leaped from his body, and a magnificent rainbow of light erupted.

"Rainbow Pierce!"

This Dharma Art, which had once failed to even scratch Tuoba Chongyuan's physical body, was now completely transformed. The splendid, colorful light coalesced into massive beams the size of houses, which danced and scattered through the air, streaking past the faces of the Master Monks.

As the spell arts shot toward the heavens, the nun attending the Merciful One was startled. She descended on her cloud, shouting, "Vicious fiend! You still dare to be arrogant!"

Even Zhuzhen frowned slightly, musing to himself.

'He truly is exceptionally skilled in spell arts… his reputation is well-earned… a pity he cultivates heavenly glow arts. With no path forward unless he joins Luoxia… he is indeed a sharp sword for any Immortal Daoist Master.'

He seemed less rash and unreasonable than he appeared on the surface. He was observing, scrutinizing. Seeing this, Li Xizhi felt his resolve harden.

"All cultivators on the island, join me in resistance!" he commanded.

The cultivators immediately descended onto the array platforms. The formation on North Dan Island had been constructed by an array master during Chi Wei's era, when the Azure Pond Sect was at its zenith with five Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters presiding over it. The materials used were of the highest quality. With more than ten Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators channeling their energy in unison, the great array blazed to life.

But the Master Monks in the sky were more numerous and more powerful, and the array began to tremble almost immediately. Li Xizhi took a step into the air, his hands forming a new seal as he chanted an incantation.

'Screen of Cinnabar Cloud, from light manifest as you will, embrace the nine mountains, connect with the Nine Serene and reveal the truth… light of misty clouds, emerge at my command…'

A six-colored radiance shot from his palms. It soared like a swallow toward the outside of the array, transforming into a rainbow mist that spread out to reinforce the formation.

This was Li Xizhi's immortal foundation, Universal Dawn Mist, which excelled at evasion, rainbow-gathering, and casting. It could coalesce rainbow mist to confuse enemies and fortify a location. He had rarely used it in recent years, but now, its appearance immediately weakened the momentum of the attacking Master Monks.

The disorienting power of the mist was formidable, and combined with Li Xizhi's potent spell arts, it threw the cultivators outside the array into disarray. Above them, Zhuzhen's eyelids twitched with annoyance. The nun beside him immediately spoke in a respectful tone.

"Great Cultivator, shall I…"

Before she could finish, Zhuzhen shot her a cold glance. It was clear the Great Konghai Temple was starting to lose face, but the Merciful One seemed preoccupied with something else, his gaze wandering over the island.

He observed Yang Xiao'er closely, as if trying to confirm something. Seeing her composure and complete lack of fear, he frowned inwardly. But he couldn't allow Li Xizhi to hold them off. The Merciful One finally had to act. He let out a soft, casual breath.

"Hah!"

With that single exhalation, a fierce gale swept across the island. No matter how powerful the rosy mist was, it was instantly dispersed by the Merciful One's breath, once again revealing the white-robed man at the heart of the array.

Li Xizhi's expression was grave. As the crowd of Master Monks closed in again, he finally placed his hand on the hilt of the longsword strapped to his back. His pale, slender fingers rested on the gem embedded in the sword, yet he hesitated.

Beside him, Yang Xiao'er's face was also tinged with anger. Seeing her husband's hesitation, she took a step forward. "Act freely, husband…" she said in a soft, warm voice.

The understanding between them needed no words. Yang Xiao'er knew he was unsure of the situation and worried that injuring these Master Monks would give the Merciful One a pretext to retaliate without restraint. And Li Xizhi knew that his wife was confident.

His trust in her was absolute. She had been his wise partner through countless near-death experiences over the years. He gave a slight nod, and with a flick of his wrist—

*Shing!*

The longsword, shimmering with colorful light, was drawn partially from its sheath, revealing a section of pure white blade, its edge sharp, smooth, and exquisitely curved.

Above, the previously distracted Zhuzhen's eyes suddenly lit up. He whipped his head around as if jolted by lightning and let out a thundering roar.

"How dare you!"

At the same instant, a brilliant, warm white light leaped from within the array. It split into yellow and white streams, which in the very moment they appeared, each divided again into three points of interweaving, fluid light.

'Flowing Light of the Triple Moon!'

The many Master Monks surrounding the array finally recoiled in unison, a heart-stopping sense of danger flooding their senses.

*Clang!*

A gigantic golden hand shot through the Great Void and materialized in front of the Master Monks. Rippling with immense spiritual qi, it shielded them all behind it.

Zhuzhen was a Merciful One, after all, and traversing the Great Void offered him immense advantages. The six points of brilliant, warm white light were seized at once. The nearest stream of light had almost reached a Master Monk's neck, making his spiritual body shiver and a faint red line appear on his skin.

A cold chill ran down the backs of all the Master Monks as they exchanged horrified glances.

'He almost killed someone…'

Only Zhuzhen's swift reaction had prevented it. If the Great Konghai Temple had arrived in force, only to have several of their Master Monks killed right in front of a Merciful One, the loss of face would have been catastrophic.

In that single instant, the golden hand had barely managed to grasp the sword essence. A series of fine, sharp, ear-piercing metallic clashes rang out. Then, like a rainbow appearing after a storm, multicolored lights intertwined as streaks of radiance seemed to fall from the sky.

Li Xizhi had already sheathed his sword.

'Autumn Moon's Accord!'

It was the third style of the Celestial Moon Sword Canon!

Li Xizhi had achieved his sword essence and crossed the threshold to practice this sword art more than twenty years after his younger brother, Li Xijun, had. He had only managed it with the aid of the Five-Colour Sinking Expanse Sword Art. But his innate talent was no less than his brother's. By combining the Five-Colour Sinking Expanse Sword Art with the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon, he produced six streams of sword light. Executing Autumn Moon's Accord on this foundation made it even more devastating.

The next moment, a violent, piercing, earth-shattering shriek erupted from within the palm. The sound was so sharp and brittle that the Master Monks winced in pain, while the monks below clutched their ears as blood trickled out.

The great golden palm flinched as if it had clamped down on a steel nail. It faltered in a pained reflex, then, as if in a fit of rage, it slammed down onto Beidan's great array.

*BOOM!*

The dozen or so Foundation Establishment cultivators within the array all spat blood and were sent flying like arrows shot from a bow. The great array of Beidan exploded with a deafening roar, emitting a thick golden smoke. Like a glass dome struck by a hammer, it was instantly covered in a web of fine cracks.

*BANG!*

A tremendous crash echoed from the main hall atop Beidan's peak as thick white smoke billowed out. The central array plate had clearly been shattered beyond repair.

Silence fell over the scene.

*Crack…*

The sound of the great array of Beidan breaking apart filled the air. Whether it was the monks on the sea or the cultivators on the island, no one had yet recovered from their stupor. They were not shocked that Zhuzhen had broken the array with a single palm strike—on the contrary, it would have been stranger if he couldn't.

What left them stunned was Zhuzhen's pained reaction.

'This is a great cultivator of the Great Konghai Temple…'

In the last few centuries in Jiangnan, only one person had fought a Merciful One as a Foundation Establishment cultivator: Duanmu Kui.

Li Xizhi had merely caused Zhuzhen a flicker of pain. If not for the array absorbing the blow, he would have been annihilated instantly. Of course, he couldn't be compared to Duanmu Kui, who, wielding an Immortal Scripture, had beaten a Merciful One from the south so badly he was forced to retreat.

But that was with an Immortal Scripture. And who was Duanmu Kui? He was a legendary figure who had dominated his era, a man who had almost single-handedly redeemed the reputation of the Locust Shade Ghost immortal foundation. Not just anyone could be said to have dominated an era. Even without an Immortal Scripture, how many in Jiangnan could have fought him?

The current scene left the entire area of Shitang speechless. No one dared to look up at the Merciful One. Even Yang Xiao'er was startled, not expecting her husband's sword strike to be so incredible. She immediately clutched a talisman in her hand.

'Please don't let him fly into a rage…'

The Merciful One Zhuzhen slowly raised his head, studying his palm.

The golden palm was perfectly smooth. Of course, there was nothing there. No matter how hastily he had acted, Li Xizhi could not possibly have broken through his spiritual body or even left a mark. But he had undeniably felt pain.

'It must be a sword art capable of harming the Shengyang Acupoint… such magnificent swordsmanship…'

Zhuzhen's guess was correct. The strike of Autumn Moon's Accord, followed by the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon, merged three into one to simultaneously extinguish the Shengyang, Qihai, and Juque acupoints. It required sword essence to execute. If combined with a sword intent that could pierce the Great Void, the technique would be even more terrifying.

'A shame the gap between us is too vast,' Zhuzhen thought. 'It was merely a surprise.'

His thoughts flashed by in an instant. His gaze fell upon the white-robed swordsman on the island, his face burning with rage, his voice turning colder.

"Good… very good… they all say your sword can shake the heavens and earth. You are truly a descendant of a Sword Immortal."

As his voice grew low, Yang Xiao'er slowly tightened her grip on the talisman in her sleeve. Li Xizhi had already given quiet orders for the other cultivators to retreat. He himself remained unhurried, cupping his hands in a salute.

"This junior was merely clever. I thank Senior for the guidance."

The next moment, a blast of black wind shot from Yang Xiao'er's sleeve. But at the same time, Zhuzhen's colossal golden body vanished from the sky. The other Master Monks gave chase to the retreating Azure Pond cultivators, while the sound of the array crackling and shattering continued. Swarms of monks began to climb onto North Dan Island like ants.

*BOOM.*

A great golden palm materialized and seized the black wind, its five fingers tightening and yanking it back forcefully. Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er, caught within the wind, both coughed up blood. Yet Li Xizhi saw that his wife was completely unafraid. She simply guided the wind calmly and whispered:

"Daoist Master Ning has made her move."

By his calculations, it was too soon for Ning Wan to have arrived from the north. Li Xizhi couldn't tell if 'Daoist Master Ning has arrived' or 'Daoist Master Ning was here all along.' Zhuzhen's behavior was equally strange.

'Is he unable to catch us, or unwilling?'

He could only lower his head slowly, pushing all such thoughts from his mind.

As soon as Yang Xiao'er finished speaking, flurries of cold snow began to fall from the sky. A woman in white emerged from the Great Void. Unlike Zhuzhen's posturing, feigned coldness, this immortal's chill was laced with genuine fury.

"The Great Konghai Temple certainly has a lot of nerve."

The cultivators on the island let out a collective sigh of relief. Li Xizhi and his wife also relaxed. Zhuzhen, secretly relieved himself, manifested his full golden spiritual body and replied:

"Daoist Master Ning, you've arrived just in time. Regarding the matter of Beidan, my Maha wishes to discuss it with you in detail."

He stood his ground, a pillar of golden light soaring behind him. A thin figure slowly materialized within it—a monk in grey robes, holding a staff.

The monk's eyes were set high on his face. He held one hand before him, and his chin was sharp, giving him a somewhat malevolent look. Unlike the colossal spiritual bodies of the seven Mahas of the north, he appeared to be an ordinary monk. But when he struck the ground with his staff, a crisp sound rang out, and all the wind and snow ceased.

Ning Wan looked at him quietly. "With the Three Yuans fallen," she said softly, "a creature like you comes out to make trouble."

An exaggerated expression of joy spread across the monk's face. He grinned, revealing a set of perfectly white teeth. "No matter how invincible they were, they are dead now, while I have become a Maha. My path to eternal life has just begun. That is the difference between Immortals and Buddhists. What's the use of letting you be proud for a few more years?"

"Beidan belongs to my temple, so we will naturally take it back. Daoist friend Ning, my temple will give the Supreme Yang Dao lineage some face and not harm anyone. Go back to where you came from!"

Ning Wan smiled faintly, a smile like the spring thaw, and her tone became gentle. "Even if Senior lives another four hundred years, you'll never erase the incidents of 'Yuanwu Treading on the Face' and 'One Talisman is Enough.' In the past, for the sake of friendship between our two houses, we didn't speak of it. But now that the world has heard that Baoqing has achieved the Maha realm, perhaps it's time to tell the old stories again."

Her calm words struck like a thunderclap. After all of Baoqing Maha's posturing, Ning Wan's single sentence made him clench his fists. A dangerous light gleamed in his eyes as he forced a smile through his rage.

"You bitch, you'd better worry about yourself!"

***

## Moongaze Lake

On the grand hall, light streamed and flowed. A man in black robes with crimson trim stood before the gallery, watching the heavy rain fall upon the lake. His hand rested on the stone railing, tapping lightly, a picture of leisure.

After a while, a white-haired old man approached from the other end of the gallery. The old man was small and thin, his face a web of wrinkles, giving him an extremely shrewd appearance.

He bowed before the younger man. "Reporting to the Patriarch," he said respectfully, "the Hall of the Locust Soul from Jiangbei… has taken the lands of Midong, expanding their territory by a thousand li. Many of the great families of Midong have already pledged their allegiance. Their strength has grown considerably."

Li Jiangqian nodded with great interest. "How did they manage it? Did the Capital immortals give Midong away? Couldn't Guan Gongxiao come up with a better plan?"

Qu Bushi quickly replied, "Patriarch, there was unrest in Midong. Several families defected to the Hall of the Locust Soul… Daoist Bai was initially unwilling to accept them… but those families brought news that the whole of Baijiang Creek was the territory of the Secret Diffusion lineage. Lord Guan simply went with the flow and gave them Midong… Daoist Bai didn't harm those families, seeming to intend to make use of them once the storm passes."

Li Jiangqian nodded. "That's a passable explanation. Daoist Bai isn't a fool, just exceedingly greedy. He won't do anything truly unforgivable, but for a small grievance, his greed will make him overlook it."

Qu Bushi nodded eagerly. "Precisely because of this news, I've heard… that in recent days, Daoist Bai intends to conquer Fanyun and unify Baijiang Creek."

"That Hall of the Locust Soul is leakier than a sieve…" Li Jiangqian sneered. "People are all the same. After one or two successful ventures, they think everyone is just like them. My family and the Capital immortals Dao have kept our distance, so he's gradually lost his fear of Purple Mansion Realm powers. He thinks they're nothing special. Seeing Chengyun Gate and Lotus Temple locked in a fierce battle, unable to even manage the chaos in their own territories, he decided to make his move."

"And Chengyun Gate is happy to let them fight. With the Secret Diffusion lineage gathered, Fanyun's purpose no longer exists. They can cleanly rid themselves of their vassals in the area. It's killing two birds with one stone. And they have the perfect excuse of being tied up by the Buddhist Dao… they have nothing to fear."

He surveyed the entire situation, thinking to himself:

'Chengyun Gate is truly formidable. Their planning, before and after, has been flawless, and they've managed to distance themselves from everything completely. After all, when orchestrating something like this, even the puppeteer has to be wary.'

Qu Bushi didn't know what he was thinking and dared not speak. He saw Li Jiangqian suddenly become thoughtful.

"Guan Gongxiao… I believe he has a sister, named Guan Lingdie? I hear she is quite beautiful… hmm… the Saintess of the Demonic Dao… Has she been in Jiangbei recently?"

# Chapter 841: The Great Rat

Qu Bushi hurried forward, his voice respectful.

"Reporting to the Family Head, it was indeed Guan Lingdie. The Capital immortals Dao sent her to the Eastern Sea. As for the Capital immortals Dao itself… they've been shuffling their personnel quite aggressively, replacing several cultivators stationed near the borders of Baijiang Creek."

"Guan Gongxiao still dotes on his sister," Li Jiangqian mused, nodding to himself. It was understandable. Though opportunities abounded at a True Monarch's side, if he were in Guan Gongxiao's shoes, he wouldn't have been willing to send Li Que'wan either, even if she hadn't already entered seclusion for her breakthrough.

'A personnel shuffle… Don't tell me that Guan fellow scoured his entire sect and sent every female cultivator he could find? Knowing Guan Gongxiao's personality, it's not out of the question…'

When it came to matters surrounding a True Monarch, female cultivators were always more convenient than males. Over the past few years, Li Jiangqian had already been gradually replacing the cultivators stationed on the northern shore with members of the Fei family and women, just to prevent any unforeseen incidents.

Qu Bushi lowered his head slightly and continued, "The two families have been in a standoff for several months, with skirmishes beginning to break out. Many great families and demonic cultivators have come to spy. One of them, a fellow with rather paltry skills, was spotted at a glance by Lord Cui on the river and captured."

"He has been taken to a side hall, awaiting your judgment, my lord…"

This was no surprise to Li Jiangqian. "I am aware," he replied calmly. "He's one of the Hall of the Locust Soul's people. Protector Cui already sent a message. I will question him myself."

A chill crept into his smile. "They have some nerve. Not just on the river—demonic cultivators have been spotted snooping around our northern shore as well. Give them an inch and they take a mile. A mere Foundation Establishment Realm demonic cultivator, gathering some rabble, dares to spy on my family's mountain gate…"

'If it weren't for more pressing matters…' he thought coldly, 'I'd dispatch a protector to fetch his head!'

A shiver went down Qu Bushi's spine. He hadn't expected the faction across the river would dare to spy so openly. That old Daoist Bai had clearly underestimated the reach of a Purple Mansion Realm power and overestimated his own sect's ability to keep secrets. The old man could only bow his head in silence.

Most of the clan's Foundation Establishment cultivators had been sent to the river, and Li Jiangqian once again felt he was short on manpower, especially those from the direct lineage.

Li Jianglong had returned from the north and was now in seclusion. Having reached the eighth level of Qi Refining, he could attempt his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm after consuming the Talisman Pill and the Three Perfection Breakthrough Pill. Jiangxia was a bit faster, but not by much.

As for the rest of the Li family, a new generation of cultivators—Fei Qing'yi, An Xuantong, and even Li Zhoufang, Li Zhouyang, and Li Xinghan—was gradually reaching the later stages of Qi Refining. Li Jiangqian made a quick mental calculation.

'In about ten years, our family will see its peak number of Foundation Establishment cultivators. It won't even be a problem to have one for each mountain peak… We will truly become a behemoth, just like the Xiao family of old…'

As the two were discussing matters of the north, a cultivator approached from the side, drew a small letter from his sleeve, and presented it. Li Jiangqian's expression turned peculiar as he read it.

His gaze swept over the heavy rain outside the window. He dismissed Qu Bushi, then turned and walked back into the hall, sending someone to summon Li Xuanxuan and Li Minggong.

The old man arrived quickly, riding the wind. He moved with haste, yet his face was wreathed in smiles, as if he had heard good news. Li Minggong, however, was nowhere to be seen, likely at a critical juncture in her cultivation of spell arts. The current conflict with the Capital immortals Dao wasn't a full-blown war, and they had enough people. Moreover, Cui Jueyin was in charge and knew the secrets behind the situation, so he was more than capable of handling things. Thus, they let Li Minggong focus on her training.

Li Xuanxuan took the letter from Li Jiangqian. As he read, Li Jiangqian poured a cup of tea for the elder.

"Daoist Master Qiuhu fought in the Southern Sea… and was forced to retreat by Maha. Beidan is lost…"

Whenever Li Xuanxuan came to the main hall, Li Jiangqian would personally pour his tea, always at the perfect temperature. It was just the man’s way, making others feel at ease in his presence. Li Xuanxuan quietly accepted the cup with a smile.

"It's rare to get news of Li Xizhi… This is a good thing… A family of sword immortals should have a sword cultivator, after all."

The letter had evidently mentioned Li Xizhi drawing his sword, but Li Xuanxuan's smile was strained. Li Jiangqian's frown deepened. He set down the teapot and lowered his voice.

"Something is very wrong with this. It's been wrong from the start. Tell me, this Zhuzhen Merciful One… why would he suddenly take Shitang? Was it necessary for the Great Konghai Temple? Even if we assume there's some secret we low-level cultivators don't understand… why would he take Shitang without harming a single cultivator from the Azure Pond?"

"Daoist Master Qiuhu was clearly stationed to guard the north. How could she appear at Shitang in a flash? Not even traversing the Great Void is that fast, unless the Daoist Master possesses supreme wisdom and knew about it long in advance."

"Furthermore, after the Zhuzhen suffered such a humiliation, it wouldn't have been excessive for him to strike someone down in anger…"

Li Xuanxuan had been worried that Li Xizhi was drawing too much attention, but he hadn't considered Li Jiangqian's line of reasoning. Hearing it now, he asked, "What are you implying?"

Li Jiangqian's expression was unreadable. "I received news some time ago that the Lotus Temple also ceded territory to the Chengyun Gate."

As Li Xuanxuan pondered this, the pieces seemed to fit. Li Jiangqian continued in a low voice, "They are both leaders of the Immortal Dao, after all… They shouldn't be on such friendly terms with Buddhist cultivators…"

The old man understood his meaning, but it was hard to say whether the Azure Pond had deliberately given up Beidan as part of a secret trade, or if they were secretly colluding with the Great Konghai Temple on some grander scheme.

Li Jiangqian glanced at him. "The one who suffers most is the Lingu Family."

The old man stroked his beard and nodded.

As Li Jiangqian saw it, with Ning Wan supporting the Azure Pond alone, it was understandable that she would trade Beidan for some form of aid. And what kind of place was Shitang? The Lingu Family had been operating there for years, using the Wu Oakworm and Ginseng-Timber Wood to bleed it dry day by day. Ning Wan couldn't possibly have been unaware. There was also a marketplace there that benefited the Ning and Si families, but with Yuanxiu's death, that market was doomed to fail.

Seeing the old man remain silent, Li Jiangqian whispered, "Daoist Master Ning should still be in the Southern Sea."

Li Jiangqian was not one for idle speculation; he was hinting to the old man that he had already used the Immortal Mirror to check. Li Xuanxuan's face filled with worry. "I just fear… that things are not stable for Xizhi."

This was precisely what unsettled Li Jiangqian. "Who would reveal their true strength for no reason when they could keep it hidden?" he said softly. "Stepping into the limelight is never a safe path. It seems like he's earned everyone's praise, but with his status, does he really need such accolades? From start to finish, there's no benefit for him in this, only for the Azure Pond."

"I don't believe Daoist Master Ning is the type to push Xizhi forward for her own gain," the old man countered. "She is not like Yuanxiu, and the Li family is not what it once was… And don't forget… he is Zhaojing's brother."

'Once you reach the Purple Mansion Realm and attain a Life Divine Ability, your heart changes, no matter who you are.'

Li Jiangqian could only nod silently. Though he thought otherwise, it was not the time to say more. "In any case, this doesn't bode well. Daoist Master Ning is the most powerful figure involved. It would be best for you, my lord, to meet with her on the lake. There should be no obstacles."

Li Xuanxuan nodded grimly, then changed the subject. "I've heard about the matter with the Hall of the Locust Soul. Do not be rash…"

Li Jiangqian smiled. "You underestimate me, old master."

Li Xuanxuan said no more, but his heart was heavy with concern.

'If it weren't for Daoist Bai, and if our family wasn't in Jiangbei, we would have found it difficult to escape this entanglement. This Li family rules their domain with an iron fist, commanding factions from afar, their background profound. They are all so-called young masters of a great family, and the one governing them is a cunning youth in black and crimson robes, a golden-eyed scion with great ambitions who will stop at nothing… This young man's father was a peerless talent among Foundation Establishment cultivators, and above him is an ancestor, a Daoist Master whose whereabouts are unknown…'

'They're the protagonists of this drama, while we are just clowns on the side! If my family were in Jiangbei, we would have already packed up and fled overseas by now.'

He left without another word to write his letter. Li Jiangqian set down his brush, only to see a young man in a red robe approaching the hall from outside, a folding fan in his hand. It was his uncle, Zhouming.

Li Jiangqian smiled. "Uncle, you seem to be in a leisurely mood today, to have time to visit me."

Zhouming, a blissful newlywed, had lost his usual debonair flair. His face was a mask of misery as he shook his head. "These past few months… I haven't been able to visit a single pleasure barge. I don't know how Shouyu gets her information, but every time I slip away, she shows up moments later. She doesn't say a word, just sits there smiling and watching…"

"I break out in a cold sweat every time. And those poor girls? They usually end up kneeling on the floor, weeping…"

Li Jiangqian was well aware of his uncle's recent antics and stifled a laugh. The red-robed man before him shook his head again. "I thought I could get a breath of fresh air on a trip to the Azure Pond, see the sights, but I was called back as soon as I arrived. I didn't even get to see anything…"

He sighed. "In this rainy season, there's nothing more relaxing than drifting on the lake in a boat and watching the rain. But I have no heart for it anymore. I came here to hide."

Zhouming loathed tedious duties more than anyone. To be driven to seek out work in the main hall showed just how desperate he was. Li Jiangqian clicked his tongue and offered some comfort. "Aunt is from a prestigious family, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, a first-rate figure… If you put in more effort, Uncle, a happy marriage is the best thing you could ask for…"

At the mention of this, Zhouming's face paled slightly, and he sighed. "She's a direct disciple of an immortal sect, very capable… You should find something for her to do… A dignified Foundation Establishment cultivator, tormenting me day in and day out? I can't take it anymore…"

Li Jiangqian understood at once. He smiled inwardly but put on a thoughtful expression.

'He has a point. A woman of her standing, the wife of a Purple Mansion Realm direct descendant, should have a position. It's only proper.'

He had been so busy lately that he had overlooked the matter. "What you say is reasonable, Uncle. I recall that Aunt cultivates the Blazing Fire. Coincidentally, the clan is re-establishing the Qi-gathering division, to be called the 'Furnace Tribute Division.' We will have to trouble her to lead it!"

The Li family's Qi-gathering branch possessed a treasure, an ancient artifact called Stray Fragrance that Li Xuanfeng had acquired. It was originally from the Si Family and could store spiritual qi without letting it dissipate. His words implied that Xia Shouyu would now be in charge of it.

Spiritual qi was always a finite resource, making this no easy job. The one in charge needed not only status but also cunning. Li Jiangqian's arrangement was perfect. Zhouming didn't grasp all the subtleties, but he nodded repeatedly. "My thanks, Family Head. There is one other matter… My brother Zhoufang's eldest son, Li Jiangzong, has broken through to the Qi Refining realm. He cultivates the Pheasant Fire March Art from the True Fire lineage. My brother dotes on him and hopes he can study under our aunt, Li Minggong. If you could put in a good word for him…"

Li Zhoufang had been blessed with many children. First there was Li Queyi cultivating at Purple Smoke, and now there was Li Jiangzong. All of them were quite promising. With Li Xinghan from the Yuandu branch as well, their lineage had become the most prominent of the main branch.

Li Jiangqian naturally agreed. A new, promising member of the direct line was a good thing. Although Li Minggong was from the Yuanwan Branch, she held no such sectarian prejudices and would surely be delighted. He smiled and asked, "How old is this young cousin of mine?"

Zhouming snapped open his fan. "Twenty-three, a little younger than Queyi."

Just as he finished speaking, a figure appeared outside the hall. It was Li Minggong, dressed in a white gown, the lantern in her hand unlit—a stark contrast to her usual attire.

Li Jiangqian then remembered that today was the anniversary of Li Chenghui's death. She must have been paying her respects, which was why the person sent to summon her couldn't get through to her manor.

Affection fades when one is gone. For the first two years, the anniversary rituals had been grand affairs, but now, few people still remembered Li Chenghui. Only the three clan members who stood to inherit his legacy made a lively show of it every year, organizing ceremonies more splendid than those for their own ancestors. Whether their sentiment was false or genuine, Li Chenghui had left no children, and at least someone was there to manage his affairs.

Li Jiangqian's black robe was appropriate enough, but Zhouming was still clad in bright red. He wasn't a bad person, just utterly thoughtless. He had barely met Li Chenghui a few times in his life, and even seeing his aunt in mourning white didn't seem to register, which made Li Jiangqian cringe.

Fortunately, Li Minggong wasn't one to fuss over such things. "I've recently mastered the Art of Wondrous Transformations," she said gently. "It was a congratulatory gift from the Slaughter Jun Gate to the Daoist Master back then. The art is highly compatible with my immortal foundation, and that pocket of purple baleful qi on Gardenia Scenery Mountain was a wondrous aid in my training… Its potential is immense."

"You cultivate the Li Fire, which is even more compatible than my True Fire. You should give it a try. There's more to this art than meets the eye."

The Slaughter Jun Gate's Art of Wondrous Transformations was a method of consuming Li Fire and Baleful Earth to exhale Earth Fire Baleful Qi. It was quite difficult to cultivate. Li Minggong's expression was one of pleasant surprise, having mastered it with the aid of the purple baleful qi.

If it could excite Li Minggong, who cultivated True Fire, it would surely be even more effective for him with his Li Fire. Li Jiangqian's interest was piqued. He nodded eagerly and sighed. "Nothing from that Daoist Master Junjian is ever subpar… And he has such good relations with our family, the things he gives us are bound to be better than what he gives others… Have you had a look at the juniors in the family, my lady?"

Li Minggong moved to take a seat. "I was just about to speak with you about that. I've seen Jiangzong. He is modest and eager to learn. While one might not call his temperament exceptional, his magnanimity already surpasses most."

Hearing this, it was clear the boy was quite promising. Not even his father, Li Zhoufang, had received such praise, and Li Zhouluo had only been described as "talented." Li Jiangqian looked up slightly, breathing a sigh of relief.

'Among the Jiang and Que generation, aside from my own younger brothers, we finally have someone presentable!'

He now understood Li Xuanxuan's joyful expression when he had arrived. The old man cared most about such matters and must have known early on. Li Jiangqian sighed. "The lack of promising successors has been a constant worry for the old master and the other elders. Having a talented one at last should ease their minds and quench their thirst."

Among the Zhou and Xing generation, only Li Xinghan could be considered prominent. In the Jiang and Que generation, besides the golden-eyed children, Queyi and Quexi were at Purple Smoke, leaving only Que'wan on the lake, and her cultivation was so rapid she had no time for thoughts of offspring.

Zhouming finally seemed to grasp the situation. He asked a few questions about family affairs, careful not to mention the abandoned Funan. "I hear there's been some fighting on the river," he said. "Our cultivators have clashed with those from the Capital immortals Dao, and we've captured a demonic cultivator. Which faction is he from?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head. "Let's bring him up for the elders to see."

He gave a quiet order, and Qu Bushi entered from outside the hall, dragging a young-looking demonic cultivator. The man's hands were bound tight, his cultivation sealed. His face was pale, and he was drenched in a cold sweat.

Zhouming looked at the man, but the youth was unable to speak. Li Jiangqian said with a thin smile, "My family is in a major conflict with the Capital immortals Dao, and this fellow was spying from the sidelines. Lord Cui's ocular arts are formidable; he plucked him right out."

He held up the letter from Cui Jueyin, read from it, and then passed it to Zhouming and Li Minggong. "He's already been interrogated. He's from the Hall of the Locust Soul. The Secret Diffusion Dao lineage has a long history, so he has some backing."

He turned his head, his voice turning sharp. "Your name! Your position!"

The young man immediately dropped to his knees. "This lowly one… this lowly one is a protector under the Hall of the Locust Soul, called Protector Black Rat. I am one of the seven protectors before the main hall, in charge of taxes on spiritual items in the Funan area, and I also manage a storehouse…"

"The Hall Master was unsure what was happening on the river and specifically sent me to investigate. I had no intention of spying, I swear! Please, my lords, see the truth!"

Zhouming, unaware of the underlying situation, reacted genuinely. He smacked his fan into his palm, clearly displeased. "Is there truly such a thing as owing a favor to a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? But he only has a favor, while our family truly *has* a Purple Mansion Realm expert. We can't let them bully us as they please…"

Li Jiangqian sighed dramatically. "Uncle, you don't understand. This Secret Diffusion Dao lineage is no simple matter. The Purple Mansion Realm faction behind them has deep roots, possibly even tracing back to a True Monarch… The family must avoid this conflict at all costs!"

Zhouming was taken aback. This gave him a much better understanding of why they had lost Funan. He shot to his feet. "What should we do then?" he stammered. "Should we… release him?"

"No…"

Li Jiangqian made no attempt to hide his intentions from the kneeling demonic cultivator. His eyes, light and sharp, flickered across his uncle, and he changed his words mid-sentence. He laughed in fury. "But we cannot be bullied like this either. I will kill him and make the other side taste some pain."

As the words left his lips, a sense of unease washed over him. He saw Zhouming jump to his feet, a look of shock and terror on his face. "You can't kill him! If there's a True Monarch involved…"

Even Qu Bushi was stunned and quickly pleaded, "My lord, I'm afraid you can't kill him…"

Li Minggong, too, frowned slightly, clearly disagreeing. She was mindful of his position and remained silent, but if he persisted, she would likely speak up as well.

Li Jiangqian surveyed the room with amusement, his feigned anger subsiding slightly. "He may have received a token, but that doesn't mean his entire lineage has it! Just because of one token, everyone wants to put him on a pedestal?"

The two men resumed their persuasion. After a long while, Li Jiangqian finally relented.

"Fine, I won't kill him, but he can't just come and go as he pleases. Take him down and let him taste some suffering first."

Zhouming let out a long breath. Before Li Jiangqian could change his mind again, he hurriedly had Qu Bushi take the man away. Li Jiangqian simply raised an eyebrow, taking it all in, a realization dawning in his mind.

'Protector Black Rat… an important figure. Good, very good.'

Qu Bushi hadn't left yet. He paused to ask for instructions. "Where should he be imprisoned?"

An idea immediately formed in Li Jiangqian's mind—it was time to make use of the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda on the lake.

The Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda was a gift from Li Xizhi years ago. It was extremely valuable and had been kept in Qingdu, intended as an artifact for training the younger generation and punishing disciples. Yet, it had seen little use over the years.

Firstly, just after they acquired it, Li Jiangqian had come out of seclusion to reorganize the family's affairs. The entire Li clan was incredibly busy, so no one had the time to figure it out.

Secondly… its power was simply too unbalanced. Forget the Li family disciples, even Chen Yang had entered it once and came out covered in soot. After braving the Supreme He Fire, he found the Crop-Injuring Wind in the middle to be pitifully weak, while the final Autumn-Perishing Water was overwhelmingly powerful. Among the many cultivators of the Li family, only Cui Jueyin and Ding Weizeng could complete the full trial.

The benefits gained were not that significant either. For cultivators of Cui Jueyin's and Ding Weizeng's level, refining their true essence or clearing their spiritual sense was of little use. As for Qi Refining cultivators, they had no hope of withstanding the Supreme He Fire.

'It's an ancient artifact, after all. With the changes to Fruition Attainment, everything is different now. It's not very practical.' he thought. 'But the artifact is controllable. Unless the Northern Palace Thunder at the very top is activated, it won't be fatal. No wonder they said it was for punishing disciples; that's its best use.'

"This fellow is weak," he said coldly. "Send him into the Crop-Injuring Wind. Let him have a taste of suffering!"

The Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda wouldn't kill, but it would inflict continuous torment, enough to leave an indelible mark on the man's mind. As Qu Bushi dragged him away, Zhouming returned to his seat to discuss some family matters before taking his leave.

Li Jiangqian sat quietly in the main seat, a chill spreading through his heart.

'It's already begun… Black Rat's capture wasn't an accident. No wonder it was so sloppy… Now we'll see if the Hall of the Locust Soul wants him back. If they really send someone to retrieve him, he must play a significant role.'

The True Monarch was prophesied to descend within six years, which meant it couldn't be an infant. The descent would be into a host who had long felt the connection, or a reincarnation whose destiny had only recently awakened… in which case there probably wouldn't be any grand omens.

'He's been captured for some time now. News from the north should arrive soon.'

Li Minggong had watched the entire performance without a word. Seeing Li Jiangqian lost in thought, she spoke up, her brow furrowed. "From his description, this man seems extremely important to the Hall of the Locust Soul. They will send someone to ransom him."

Li Jiangqian sighed internally. It seemed Li Minggong also had her suspicions. He remained silent on the matter and simply said, "I'll go see for myself."

The woman departed on a trail of fire. Li Jiangqian waited, trying to read through some scrolls. After a while, he grew agitated, unable to distinguish which thoughts were truly his own. He strode outside and leaned against the corridor railing once more, sighing as he gazed out at the ceaseless storm over Jiangbei.

"This great rain… the blood of the great families and the Hall of the Locust Soul… It would be best if none of it splashes onto my family."



# Chapter 842: A Farewell

The Hall of the Locust Soul did not keep Li Jiangqian waiting long. Before the heavy rain could even begin to subside, a black wind swept down from the north, arriving on the northern shore with a menacing roar.

But as soon as it crossed over Cold Cloud Peak and left Jiangbei behind, the storm seemed to lose its nerve. The black wind dissipated and the malevolent aura vanished, leaving only a withered, bald old eccentric flying low over the lake. He approached the grand formation array and bowed, his voice a wail.

"This humble one is Daoist Wu Gui, one of the eight great protectors before the throne of the Jiangbei Hall of the Locust Soul... I beg an audience with the noble of the Immortal Clan!"

Li Jiangqian had already given orders to have Daoist Wu Gui watched, so a guide was immediately dispatched to lead him in. Wu Gui hurried inside, and upon entering the main hall, he was struck by an oppressive and terrifying majesty. His gaze lifted to a pair of golden eyes gleaming from the shadows, and he immediately dropped to his knees.

"This humble cultivator greets the noble of the Immortal Clan! My Hall Master is engaged in a dispute with the Brahma Cloud Cave and could not come himself. I am here to apologize to the Immortal Clan on his behalf..."

With a single glance, Li Jiangqian knew this Wu Gui was far more astute than that old rat. Perhaps he had a better understanding of the powers in the Purple Mansion Realm, or perhaps he was just a natural coward.

'Hmm... this one seems more sensible. He might even end up serving under a True Monarch someday.'

Li Jiangqian adopted a stern tone and replied, "So, it is you, the men of the north! The Hall of the Locust Soul may have inherited its sacred lineage, but does that give you the right to ignore the rules of the Immortal Dao? To slaughter commoners at will and send this fiend to wreak havoc upon my river!"

Of course, Li Jiangqian had no idea if the man had actually used any blood qi techniques on the river, but he knew in his bones that this Daoist was far from clean. The accusation terrified Wu Gui, who stammered, "My lord... my lord... That beast Black Rat has committed many evils, and our Hall Master is also greatly displeased with him. He gave this humble one a direct order to capture him and bring him back for severe punishment. This is also our way of thanking you, my lord, for teaching him a lesson on our behalf..."

'Daoist Bai could say something like that? That donkey-brained idiot... could words like these actually come out of his mouth?'

Li Jiangqian understood that the man before him was merely smoothing things over to complete his mission. Since he had no intention of getting involved anyway, he took the offered olive branch and relented. "The Hall Master is right. He does indeed require proper discipline. As the leader of a major power, such actions are unacceptable."

Hearing this, Wu Gui hastily explained, "Precisely! Precisely! The Hall Master also said he intends to punish him by sending him away... to a remote outpost in the east to supervise low-level cultivators mining spirit veins. He will only retain his post as a warehouse keeper..."

Li Jiangqian shook his head inwardly. One plague after another. He drew out a token, intending to let Wu Gui retrieve the prisoner himself, but a wave of caution made him reconsider.

'I can't let them meet. This Black Rat is clearly a dead man walking, marked for death by someone else. Wu Gui is a complete fence-sitter. If he sees my family's treasure and lets his tongue slip later, he might bring some great power down on us to take our Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda.'

He changed his tune. "Wait here. I'll have someone bring him up."

Wu Gui nodded repeatedly. Li Jiangqian, meanwhile, pulled a message from Wang Quwan from his desk. Recalling that the man was in seclusion at Panglu Ridge, he asked in a low voice, "A remote outpost? To which mountain has he been assigned?"

Wu Gui quickly replied, "It is near the White Ye Immortal Sect, beside White Treasury Prefecture. As for mountains... there seem to be several ridges nearby, but no major peaks."

Li Jiangqian acted as though he had only asked out of idle curiosity and quickly lost interest. Secretly, however, he unfurled a map under his desk. A quick check confirmed his suspicion: Panglu Ridge was located in White Treasury Prefecture. The dominant local clan was even the Wang clan, a branch of Wang He from the Capital immortals Dao.

'Hoh.'

Not daring to involve himself any further, he watched as Qu Bushi escorted the prisoner in. The man, having spent only a few hours within the swirling winds of the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda, was already trembling uncontrollably. His Foundation Establishment Realm was clearly built on a weak foundation, likely a fluke achieved with blood qihe was nothing compared to the Wen brothers.

'Perfect. Since he reached the Foundation Establishment Realm through blood arts, his healing abilities will be exceptional. Once he returns and supplements his energy, these minor wounds will vanish. He'll be ready to handle the True Monarch's business right away...'

As he mused, a sudden uproar filled the hall.

"You damned plague! You dare to refine blood qi on the territory of the Immortal Clan! If I don't beat you to death, you plague-ridden cur, I won't be able to face the Hall Master when I return!"

The moment Wu Gui saw Black Rat, he began to curse and beat him. His words, of course, were a desperate attempt to save the man's life. Li Jiangqian watched in amusement, allowing the tirade to continue. Black Rat's face contorted with resentment, and he opened his mouth as if to retort.

*Slap!*

Daoist Wu Gui's hand was a blur, a single strike filling Black Rat's mouth with blood. Li Jiangqian clicked his tongue inwardly and gave a slight wave of his hand. Qu Bushi immediately shoved both men out of the hall.

Wu Gui's curses faded as the doors closed. Li Jiangqian gazed at Wang Quwan's letter and decided against a reply.

'A man as clever as him will understand something is wrong when I don't respond.'

The envoys from the Hall of the Locust Soul were sent on their way. As expected, Daoist Bai was caught up in a conflict with the Brahma Cloud Cave. The master of the cave was Pingwang Zi, the very same man who, years ago, had come with Wenhu to pay respects to Li Ximing, using the name of Chengyun Gate to secure his escape. Now, the tables had turned, and it was this old fox's turn to face misfortune.

'I wonder if he'll die at the hands of the Hall of the Locust Soul, or perhaps sooner, at the hands of Chengyun Gate... He is, after all, a man of Chengyun Gate in both name and deed. And then there was that Daoist Wenhu. If Wenhu hadn't died, he would be the one playing this role now...'

Li Jiangqian pondered this again and again. In his time, Wenhu had been a master of schemes and deception, yet Li Ximing had annihilated him with a single breath. Though Li Jiangqian had not been present, he remembered how Li Chenghuai had returned from the mountain deeply shaken, his skin slick with a cold sweat.

The young man in the black robe, seated upon the main throne, slowly set the letter down. His gaze was fixed on the vortex of fate that was Jiangbeia massive, swirling maw that could tear any genius to shreds. His expression was nearly cruel as he murmured a silent refrain.

"Fortune exhausted bars the Mansion's gate; a shallow fate prevents a greater state."

When Li Ximing had spoken those words, they were filled with melancholy. When Li Chenghuai had recounted them, he was full of lingering fear. Now, from Li Jiangqian's lips, they carried a cold cruelty and a deep-seated vigilance.

He sat with his back to the light, crumpling Wang Quwan's letter ever tighter in his fist. A brilliant flare of Li Fire leaped from his palm. Red and yellow flames twisted and writhed, swiftly incinerating the paper. A fine, gray dust drifted from between his fingers, scattering across the steps below his throne.

## Purple Smoke Gate

Within the blessed land of Purple Smoke, ethereal clouds of mist drifted and coiled. A rosy dawn broke, its golden radiance weaving through the purple light that flickered in and out of view among the clouds. At the very highest point, upon the Purple Terrace, the lights merged into a single, dazzling purple-gold brilliance.

The two protectors standing before the terrace wore solemn expressions. Beyond the flowing river of purple qi, the throne at the head of the hall was magnificent, its carvings profound and mysterious.

Daoist Master Tinglan, clad in autumn-yellow robes, stood amidst this vast sea of clouds. Today, however, she was not in the seat of honor but stood to the side, her body slightly bowed in a gesture of immense respect.

For on the throne sat another, a man dressed in a purple-gold Daoist robe, a scripture held loosely in his hands as he read with quiet intensity.

His face was strikingly young, with eyes like stars and slightly thin lips. His features were so perfect they seemed sculpted, like an immortal statue in a temple, yet he possessed an air of transcendent aloofness that set him far apart from the mortal coil. The simple act of him lowering his head to read was enough to captivate any gaze.

Tinglan's own bearing was exceptional, but standing beside this man, she seemed like a mere attendant deity, not daring to move an inch.

After an unknown amount of time had passed, the purple-gold light on the terrace began to recede. The man closed the book in his hands. Only then did Tinglan raise her hands, respectfully presenting a box of pills.

"Reporting to Martial Uncle, the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill has been successfully refined. We requested the aid of Daoist Master Zhaojing of the Li clan of Wei. A total of four pills were created... they are here."

After speaking, she also produced the original clay pot. "The Immeasurable Water and Fire is here as well!" she announced with reverence.

The man she called Martial Uncle closed his eyes for a moment. He took the pills with a turn of his hand, revealing irises of purple-gold. Then, pinching his fingers together, he began to calculate, his every movement as serene as a temple deity's.

The Purple-Robed Daoist Masters voice was like a deep, resonant bell. "The Great Ancestor... has manifested in the world."

Tinglan nodded respectfully. "Reporting to Martial Uncle... after I returned from meeting you in the Southern Sea, all the lineages of the Supreme Yang Dao gathered to discuss the matter. It was decided that our gate and Azure Pond Sect would handle it."

Hearing her words, it was clear this man was none other than the long-missing Daoist Master Zimuthe only great Daoist Master in the entire Yue State's Supreme Yang Dao lineage who had perfected all five Daoist divine abilities!

Daoist Master Zimu had clearly only just arrived. He listened to her report and stated flatly, "Xiukui sent Houfu, and the Hengzhu Immortal Dao sent Hengxing."

Tinglan cupped her hands in deference. "Martial Uncle's divine abilities are vast. Though you were not present, you knew exactly who each sect would send."

Zimu's perfectly sculpted face remained unchanged, but his tone was laced with disappointment. "The heavens do not favor our Supreme Yang Dao."

Tinglan paused, uncertain. Zimu sat quietly and continued, "Lou Xing was once hailed as the Dao Child of the Xiukui Dao, seen as the next great Daoist Master. His combat prowess is formidable, but his cultivation is lacking. He has been stagnating at the Purple Mystery stage for countless years, wasting endless life-shortening remedies in a desperate attempt to break through. If an event of this magnitude cannot even stir him from his seclusion, it seems he does not have much time left."

Daoist Master Lou Xing was of the same generation as the Three Yuans of Azure Pond. Zimu could lament his fate, but Tinglan wasn't a match for even a single one of the man's divine abilities; she would never dare to comment. She lowered her head and listened as Zimu spoke on. "When he and I pass from this world, the Supreme Yang Dao will have no more champions. The final rays of the Green Pine Temple's last golden age will be extinguished."

His words made Tinglan's head snap up. Zimus voice was soft. "The great Azure Pond Sect, a power on the level of an upper sect, nearly collapsed entirely. Now, it leans on a Daoist Master who cultivates frost and has only just entered the Purple Mansion Realm. The Sword Gate's reputation was once so great it sought to emulate the Thunder Palace and uphold the morals of Jiangnan. For centuries, it has been in steady decline, now relying on the Li family for backing, too timid to even step outside its own gates."

"Xiukui and Hengzhu are both branches of the Moon Radiance Branch. The Great Xiukui Monastery will soon be left with only Houfu and Kui Qi. The Hengzhu Immortal Dao is fierce and unyielding; their war with the Murong family shattered the very lineage that had just begun to show promise. Hengli and Hengxing... they were propped up by the very last dregs of the Hengzhu foundation..."

"Cultivation Transcendence has entered seclusion and is no longer in the Yue State. Once I am gone, this blessed land of Purple Smoke will be left with only you."

Tinglan was speechless. "But... but no matter what, we are still the Supreme Yang Dao..."

Zimu gave a cold laugh. "A fine Supreme Yang Dao, indeed. A Supreme Yang Dao that doesn't even cultivate the 'Supreme Yang'!"

Tinglan dared not speak again. The great Daoist Master took a step forward, his voice low. "The Immortal Mansion has been in seclusion for years. Li Jiangqun was even besieged and killed at Moongaze Lake. Where do you think the deterrent power of the Supreme Yang Dao comes from? It used to be our Dharma Treasures! One Pristine Water, one Cultivation Transcendencethose two are still fighting in the heavens! Others may not know what kind of person Pristine Water is, but how could we not? The only one who might have intervened to protect us, Cultivation Transcendence, no longer even comes to Jiangnan. And that 'Yuzhen' has gone to the Northern Sea to establish a new lineage!"

"Ultimately, it is the Supreme Yang Dao. All five houses can sit at the same table. A Purple Mansion Realm expert from one house is an expert for all five. A great Daoist Master is a great Daoist Master for the entire Yue State. To put it nicely, it's mutual aid. To put it bluntly, it's collusion, a force to intimidate all of Jiangnan... Now, with Lou Xing and myself gone, tell me, can the five houses combined even compare to a single Golden Feather family?"

"Most importantly... there are no more great Daoist Masters. Yuandao will not get involved... and so, the Supreme Yang Dao will have no more great Daoist Masters."

His gaze drifted to the distant sea of clouds as he spoke grimly. "Li Jiangqun bought the Supreme Yang Dao another five hundred years, but even that must come to an end. Our cultivators fail time and again to break through to the Golden Core Realm. Azure Pond was forced to cede Shitang, and a man as domineering as Lou Xing didn't even raise a single question..."

Tinglan met his solemn, statue-like eyes. "Whether he is still alive remains unknown."

After a long moment of contemplation, Tinglan said respectfully, "But... how can the Supreme Yang Dao truly decline? The younger generation has its share of brilliant talents. We could summon a dozen Purple Mansion Realm experts at a moment's notice. If a great war were to break out in Jiangnan, surely the Underworld would not allow it."

Zimu held the scripture in his hands, his tone placid. "The Underworld has been too lenient with you, so much so that you now see them as your protectors. When the time comes that Jiangnan not only lacks great Daoist Masters but also cultivators with the *potential* to become one, who knows how long they'll have to wait to harvest Metallic Essence. Do you think the Underworld can't devise another plan? If they change their minds one day, all of you will become little more than stray dogs."

He continued with detached coolness, "The mortal world's Fruition Attainments of Wu Light and Luoxia make you all tremble with fear, keeping you on edge day and night, too afraid to even voice a complaint. Yet the Yin Division of the Underworld and the powers of the North are factions of the same caliber, and you feel no fear of them. It seems you have been kept in this pen for so long that you can no longer even see where your masters are placing their game pieces."

Tinglan was speechless. She could only bow low. "I beg Martial Uncle... for guidance!"

Zimu's figure was imposing, making Tinglan appear small and delicate before him, barely reaching his shoulder. Her expression was a mixture of confusion and unease.

Zimu smiled faintly. He paced once around the Purple Terrace, as if bidding a final farewell to the blessed land that had birthed and raised him. He reached out and gently patted her head in a comforting gesture.

"Rest assured. No matter how bad things get, you can always hide in the blessed land. The spiritual shield will be left for you. There is no need to return the Immeasurable Water and Fire to me. As long as there is no news of my demise, the blessed land will remain safe. Should I perish, you can offer the Dharma Treasure as tribute, following the example of the Tuoba family."

"The legacy left by my own master, my martial sisters, and even Ancestral Master Taixu has allowed me to perceive the mysteries of the Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence. I will now journey to the far east, to the source where the purple qi flourishes, to seek my path."

He raised his eyebrows, and his eyes began to glow with a purple-gold light. His lips were as red as vermilion, his face as smooth as porcelain jade. Layers of purple qi billowed from beneath his feet, and his voice took on the resonance of a Brahma chant:

"On this journey to the far east to seek Fruition Attainment, if I see the purple qi coming from the east, behold the Celestial Capital's Purple Tenuity, hear the vast music of the Empyrean Heavens and the chorus of a hundred immortals; then the dying embers of incense will be restored, fallen wood will become scripture, and the deer and birds will all come to bow before me. The twenty-three mountains and one realm of this Purple Smoke Blessed Land will then rise from the earth, ascend beyond the heavens, and transform into a grotto-heaven."

Hearing his proclamation, Tinglan fell to her knees, kowtowing endlessly. When she had completed the nine prostrations and finally looked up, the throne before her was empty. All that remained was a single, sparkling, perfectly round purple-gold orb.

"A Dharma Treasurethe Purple Qi Immortal Origin Mystic Shroud!"



# Chapter 843: Entrusted

Tinglan carefully held the spherical purplish-gold pearl. It was cool to the touch, and though it appeared unremarkable, it was a priceless treasure coveted by all in this realm. She couldn't sense its grade or any magical energy; only its substantial weight was palpable.

She held the pearl up, standing against the brilliant morning glow. The golden light of the dawn, reflected by the purple pearl, caused the throne on the Purple Terrace to radiate a soft brilliance.

The world around her gradually brightened. The Purple Terrace cave dwelling, sealed for years, finally stirred. Tinglan stepped into the void and found herself in a small, enclosed Immortal Palace.

The palace's location was unknown, and its interior was a vast expanse of shimmering purple and gold. There was nothing but a single jade seat and a small platform.

This platform, roughly a palm's width in size, was carved from a single piece of purple jade. Its intricate patterns were a pale purple, hidden within the jade itself, giving it a serene and elegant look. At its center was a circular groove that reflected a faint, white light.

Tinglan stepped forward and placed the Purple Qi Immortal Origin Mystic Shroud into the groove. A ripple of power from her hand caused a wisp of faint purple light to leap from the platform, flying into her brow.

At the same moment, the Shimmering Purple Profound Grand Array of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land finally resonated with a sense of perfect harmony. Tinglan stood motionless, gradually taking control of this immensely powerful grand array.

Though small, this jade platform was the very hub of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land—the formation core of the Shimmering Purple Profound Grand Array left behind by Taixu!

Though Tinglan had single-handedly managed the Purple Smoke Gate for many years, she hadn't been qualified to control this array. She had only been granted the right to open and close its gates. To truly gain its recognition, one had to possess either the Dharma Treasure, Purple Qi Immortal Origin Mystic Shroud, or the Taixu Purple Qi Scroll.

Now that Zimu had departed, and the Dharma Treasure had fallen into her hands, Tinglan had finally entered this hallowed ground, a place only the great Daoist Masters of the Wen and Kan families had ever been allowed to enter. Yet her heart was filled with worry.

‘Is it really that serious?’

The Supreme Yang Dao has been a pillar of the Jiangnan region for so many years, simply watching the clouds rise and fall, occupying a position of such dignity that other Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters would come to pay their respects. At its peak, a single immortal decree was all it took to summon any other Purple Mansion in Jiangnan.

Although it was weaker now, it was only because the great Daoist Masters of several sects were of similar age, and their periods of weakness happened to align. Chi Buzi, too, treated the Azure Pond branch of the Supreme Yang Dao as a burden, a terrible stroke of bad luck. Otherwise, a dignified tradition like the Supreme Yang Dao wouldn't have been so weakened.

If Zimu hadn't said these words herself, Tinglan would have dismissed any talk of trouble for the Supreme Yang Dao as a joke.

‘It’s a laugh, really... Hengli and Xiukui both see themselves as inheritors of the Immortal Mansion lineage. My Purple Smoke and Myriad Radiance maintain the ancestral teachings, ensuring that at least our main bloodlines won’t practice the art of Rebirth. Only Azure Pond has the ability to produce a great Daoist Master in a short period of time.’

‘However... every sect has a fallback plan... my family and Hengli have our blessed lands, the Sword Gate has the various mountains of the Great Western Plateau, and Xiukui has its mountain observatories. Even if Martial Uncle is right, it merely means the Golden Age of the Supreme Yang is coming to an end...’

Her gaze fell on the jade platform before her. Dense, cloud-like Purple Qi swirled around her. Tinglan then cast her eyes toward the Immortal Seat beside her.

This seat was not grand; in fact, it was quite small and delicate, clearly built for a person of petite stature. Tinglan took a step back, performed a deep bow, and then circled the seat.

Curiously, as she reached the back of the seat, all the surrounding light dimmed. It was pitch black, but her Purple Mansion level sight was not to be obstructed by mere darkness. With a glance, Tinglan discovered several lines of elegant calligraphy inscribed on the back of the seat:

‘Cultivate the truth to attain immortality, be neither impatient nor boastful, seek the ultimate state of Purple Qi, and sleep embracing the Valley Water.’

These twenty words seemed to hold a mesmerizing power, and Tinglan couldn’t tear her eyes away. Her gaze was filled with deep thought, as if she had gained a new understanding of Zimu's words. The female Daoist Master moved a step away, her chest suddenly aching with a sharp pain. A powerful sense of suffocation filled her nostrils, and her lips trembled as she began to cough.

"Cough... cough, cough..."

Tinglan coughed for a long time, her world spinning, until she finally coughed up a stream of gray air from her parched throat, landing in the palm of her hand.

She opened her left hand and squinted. It was a handful of incense ash.

A chill ran down Tinglan's spine. Suppressing the urge to cough, she retreated from the back of the throne, transforming her palm into a blade and carving deeply into her chest.

_Boom!_

A cloud of gray smoke erupted, a large handful of incense ash spewing from her internal organs. It sprayed out in a radial pattern, mixing with the purplish-gold clouds in a harmonious sight.

‘It's... a True Monarch's handwriting!’

Tinglan’s form instantly transformed into a wisp of thick Purple Smoke and dispersed. The strands of smoke flew towards the jade platform, reforming into a hand as white as jade that grasped the Dharma Treasure. Her body then slowly returned to normal, and the rolling incense ash dissipated.

"Cough... cough..."

After a final two coughs, she slowly returned to normal. The blood returned to her pale face, and Tinglan immediately bowed, kowtowing nine times.

The scene before her slowly faded. The solid feel of the ground returned to her feet, and the purplish-gold pearl in her hand disappeared. Tinglan, however, didn’t panic and slowly let out a breath.

The Purple Qi Immortal Origin Mystic Shroud had returned to its purplish-gold illusionary realm, and Tinglan had secured the array’s recognition. She could now return to the illusion at any time from this Purple Terrace. Whether the Dharma Treasure was in her hand or not no longer mattered—she would neither take it out to fight nor would she take it out of the Blessed Land.

She stepped down from the platform with lingering fear, standing alone by the stairs and looking at the ethereal clouds.

‘Since this is the case... securing the support of the Li family is even more important than I thought. At the very least, Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing... will become two Purple Mansion cultivators, one an alchemist and the other a genius whose fighting prowess is no less than Hengli’s.’

‘As for Ning Wan... I can try my best to win her over, but I don’t have to help her with everything. It makes sense for the True Monarch to go north to deal with the Shi and supplement the south as a result of the north’s loss. But I received no news about the Shitang matter, which means that girl is still cautious around me...’

Tinglan stood silently on the steps. The morning light had long since vanished. She focused her senses on the distance, where dark clouds loomed over Jiangbei, and the rain fell without end.

"Someone!"

She called softly, and a purple-robed cultivator from below hurried up. Tinglan asked, "How are things in the north?"

The man's face was very similar to Wen Wu’s. He said respectfully, "Everything is under control. Daoist Bai’s ambition is growing and can no longer be contained. Brahma Cloud Cave has been forced into a desperate retreat, asking for aid several times without success... And Pingwang Zi doesn't dare to abandon this place and flee, so he can only remain trapped day after day."

"A few hours ago, Daoist Bai already breached his main formation and captured Pingwang Zi alive, claiming he used infant souls to forge a spiritual artifact, a great and unforgivable evil. He has now been imprisoned."

Tinglan asked, "Oh? He could think of that crime? How much of this is true?"

The purple-robed man immediately replied, "It is likely true..."

Tinglan nodded, lost in thought. The man looked a bit embarrassed and whispered, "There is one more thing... news from overseas says that Li Zhouwei of the Li family appeared in our Xin Yu market..."

"That's good news."

Tinglan smiled faintly, but seeing the man's expression, she took a closer look. The man immediately replied, "He ran into Miss Li Queyi of the Li family, who was gathering Qi. He reportedly waited for a while."

Tinglan's expression changed. She frowned. "A while ago, they said she was being transferred overseas. Qianli told me she suspected it was the Li family's own arrangement. Since Zhaojing and others were already overseas, she gave the order to let her decide for herself... and now... why is she gathering Qi?"

She looked directly at the man. "Wen Wu has always been a smooth talker. I can't just listen to him. As his older brother, did you find out the situation from an outside source?"

The purple-robed man nodded hurriedly. "Queyi has a gentle personality, and Ling Yanzi is senile and unable to control anything. The disciples below, eager to advance to the Foundation Establishment Realm, wanted to borrow things from her..."

Tinglan understood the moment he spoke. She let out a cold laugh. "Senile and useless? Not necessarily. He's no simple character. He calmly emerged from the grotto heaven, and not even a Purple Mansion could get a word out of him. He just said it might be related to the True Monarch and kept everything under wraps... On the surface, he looks like a useless glutton, yet he was still able to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm when he was over a hundred years old. You say he can't control his disciples today? I think he just chooses not to."

"Don’t you know whose descendant he is?"

The man dared not say more. Tinglan's anger subsided, and her mood shifted. She sighed. "Alright... if he wants to go into seclusion, then so be it. After all, he has suffered enough in his life. Don't cause him any trouble over the Li family's matters."

"Should I... recall Wen Wu?"

He asked. Tinglan replied, "No need. There’s no one more suitable than him. He will handle things. The disciples of Ziqi Peak are all in seclusion anyway, and there are no other tasks to be assigned. We will wait for news from the Li family."

She dismissed the man and let out a sigh of relief. She then took to the air, summoning a wisp of Purple Qi. She passed through the dense clouds and disappeared into the Great Void, where she suddenly froze.

The Great Void was dark and empty, stretching infinitely, but a woman stood not far away.

The woman was dressed in yellow, wearing a veiled hat. The white veil hung down, and she stood still. Her pale hands hung at her sides, hidden by her pale-yellow sleeves, clutching two intertwined golden rings.

As she stood in the boundless Great Void, a crimson light cascaded down on both sides, transforming into silver and settling into a leaden gray. Tinglan took a small step back and said respectfully, "I greet Daoist Master Qiushui. May I ask what brings you to my Purple Smoke Blessed Land?"

Daoist Master Qiushui's gaze penetrated her veil and rested on Tinglan's face. She said softly, "I came to pay my respects to Senior Zimu."

Tinglan's heart sank, but her clever mind immediately caught on.

‘She cultivates the Whole Pill, and is naturally adept at observing the nature of things. It seems the Shimmering Purple Profound Grand Array's reaction was observed by her...’

This meant that Qiushui was not in the grotto-heaven but was in the Jiangbei area. Perhaps she was there because of the True Monarch's reincarnation. Thinking more terrifyingly, perhaps she had been waiting near the mountain gate all along...

These great Daoist Masters, who were about to break through, were one more terrifying than the last. The current Qiushui at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm was probably a match for Zimu. Tinglan bowed again and replied, "You are a step too late, Martial Uncle has already departed."

"Oh?"

Qiushui seemed a little surprised. She said softly, "Daoist Qingzhou is truly formidable."

Wen Qingzhou was Zimu's full name, which was now known to very few. Even fewer were those who could address her as Daoist Qingzhou. Tinglan didn't know if Qiushui meant that she had failed to predict Zimu's departure or that Zimu had departed right under her nose. She merely bowed, and the woman before her said:

"A few years ago, he obtained the Valley Water and Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness, and began his preparations. I don't know if Qingzhou got a taste of that Valley Water; I was hoping to lend a hand. Since he did not meet with me, he must be confident in his own ability..."

"That is good. With only a few of us left in the world, I hope he succeeds..."

Her brows were filled with melancholy, as if she had only come to offer a few words of blessing.

Daoist Master Qiushui's backing was True Monarch Duijin. Everything must have been arranged for her. She was the most outstanding figure of the Zhang family in recent years and had even met the inheritor of the Immortal Mansion. Tinglan could only feel envious. After thanking her on behalf of her Martial Uncle, Qiushui said:

"After the True Monarch's matter is settled, I will return to the grotto-heaven. But now that Ning Wan has successfully broken through, I must attend to what happened with... what happened with Tiaoxiao..."

The Daoist Master Yuansu once had some entanglement with Daoist Master Qiushui, and they almost became Dao companions. This incident was once considered a great joyous occasion for the Golden Feather and Azure Pond. There was also a time when Situ Tang killed a Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beast, and Daoist Master Qiushui cast a shadow of revenge for Yuansu.

Although the matter was later dropped because of Li Jiangqun, as a disciple of Zipei, Tinglan had naturally heard a little. However, this kind of thing was a taboo, and she dared not say a word, listening to the great Daoist Master before her say:

"Back then, Tiaoxiao and Zipei were also very good friends. It was Tiaoxiao who introduced me to her. The three of us have a bond. It is only right that I look after the Ning family now..."

"I came to you for this very reason. You can both fulfill your master's last wish and my trust..."

Tinglan felt a slight sense of relief. She bowed and said, "The great Daoist Master may give any order!"

Qiushui took out a palm-sized mirror from her sleeve, held it in her palm, and said softly, "Since Yuanxiu has died, both the "Please, Lord Take This Golden Talisman" and the Huai River Map are nowhere to be found. Yuanxiu may not have given them to her, but many people are coveting these items. I ask that you help her when necessary."

"After all, my family is not of the Supreme Yang Dao tradition. It's truly inconvenient for me and my fellow sect members to help her with certain things. Once we offer a little help, it will immediately lead to a hundred times the trouble... I can only entrust this to you."

She revealed the mirror in her palm. It was small and adorable, but it shimmered with a silvery-white lightning. Qiushui said earnestly, "My ancestor once attacked the Thunder Palace and obtained this treasure from it. It was originally a pair, but the other one was lost, leaving only this single one. Its power, however, is not to be underestimated."

"I entrust this spiritual artifact to you as a reward."

‘A spiritual artifact from the Thunder Palace!’

In the current world, a spiritual artifact from the Thunder Palace was definitely a very popular item. Firstly, its power was immense and its mystical uses endless. Secondly, it usually had no negative side effects, as the Thunder Palace had been gone for so many years...

"It’s just to look after her... there's no need..."

Tinglan just responded when Qiushui immediately spoke up:

"If you don't accept it, where is the favor? You'll also lack the power to care for her."

Although Qiushui's words were not pleasant, they genuinely persuaded Tinglan. Previously, she might have had the thought to decline, but Martial Uncle Zimu's words had completely stripped her of any sense of security. She secretly calculated, and this spiritual artifact seemed even more important.

"I will not fail the great Daoist Master's trust."

Tinglan accepted the item. Qiushui smiled faintly, seemingly lost in thought. She lowered her hands, and the two golden rings fell from her wrists back into her hands with a crisp sound.

Qiushui rode on a surging crimson sea of waves. Tinglan felt a sense of awe. She finally looked up and asked, "The great Daoist Master's cultivation has reached its peak, unmatched by anyone in the past three hundred years. When will you seek the Golden Core... to allow this junior a glimpse of the Whole Pill's brilliance..."

Qiushui just smiled and shook her head, transforming into quicksilver in the Great Void. She left a fleeting reply:

"It’s all too early."

...

Inside the Immortal Mirror.

It was snowing heavily in the Supreme Yin Manor. The round pond in the small courtyard shimmered with white light, and the white bricks on the ground were spotlessly clean. Four jade-white lanterns stood in the middle, emitting a hazy white glow.

A young man stood by the white circular pond. His forehead was smooth and his eyes were light green. He stood with his hands tucked into his sleeves, peering into the pond, waiting for the water to ripple and a faint light to appear.

"I'm just waiting for this mad dog to come here. It's the only fun I get... now that Fairy Shaohui has given her cultivation method, she's gone to the Immortal Pavilion to cultivate. There's one less person to see..."

This person was, of course, Dangjiang.

Although Dangjiang's status was not as high as Shaohui's, he was still a separated soul of the Seven reincarnations Maha Jinlian. Shaohui, on the other hand, was the soul of an early Purple Mansion realm Demon. Over time, if they were to truly compare, Shaohui would not be Dangjiang's equal in any way other than her cultivation of the Lesser Yin Dao.

Therefore, no matter what tradition Dangjiang obtained, as long as the grade wasn't too high, he could always modify it and erase its origin. Shaohui, however, found it a bit more difficult. Besides specially modifying Lesser Yin Dao traditions, she was also studying in the pavilion to increase her cultivation.

Dangjiang, naturally, did not know the details. He only knew that Shaohui had gone to a higher-level Immortal Pavilion to take up a position, and that place was empty again. There was not even a single person to talk to, so the moment his token lit up today, he rushed over.

After waiting for a long time, the sound of chanting finally began. The young man immediately pulled his head back and turned to the side, raising his chin. A man in green robes with golden tassels gradually emerged from the pond.

The man had a young face, light green eyes, wide sleeves, a loose robe, and his hair was unbound.

"Great Daoist Master Chi!"

Upon hearing this, Chi Buzi slowly opened his eyes and looked around, finally settling his gaze on the young man before him. He stepped out of the pond and said casually, "Lord Dangjiang!"

Dangjiang loved to hear this and nodded repeatedly, laughing. "Who's the unlucky one you've brought in this time?"

"An ignorant fool of a peacock..."

Chi Buzi had clearly come with a great accomplishment, but his expression was not good. He seemed preoccupied and replied, "It's that same old broken Peacock Temple. I've captured another one this time. The higher-ups will definitely blow up, so we'll have to find a new location next time..."

He observed Dangjiang's expression, sighed, and replied, "Yuanxiu failed his breakthrough and even turned into a Demon. He had many ideas, but he died a miserable death."

Chi Buzi explained casually. Dangjiang had once shared a body with him, so he naturally knew of Yuanxiu. He pursed his lips and said, "Oh, so it was that rigid old man. He just broke through to the Golden Core and died so miserably."

Chi Buzi was absent-minded, seemingly weighed down by a heavy worry. He was a person of deep thought, and yet he appeared so preoccupied that Dangjiang noticed something was off and whispered, "Why did you come up this time? A single peacock doesn't seem to be enough to exchange for that Purple Mansion cultivation method... there was no need for you to make this trip..."

Dangjiang naturally hoped he would come up every time so at least there would be someone to talk to. But Chi Buzi put seeking immortality first in all things and would not waste time on anything. There must be a reason for him to come up.

Sure enough, when Dangjiang asked, Chi Buzi immediately spoke. His face was grim, and he said in a low voice, "I went to the Shu region a few days ago and saw a thousand miles of drought. The heavens did not rain, and the springs dried up. This is a sign that the Pristine Water is not flourishing."

Upon hearing this, Dangjiang was surprised. "Isn't this a good thing? The person above your head wishes all Pristine Water cultivators were dead. If it weren't for the fact that severing all their inheritances would offend the Underworld, he wouldn't show any mercy! If he gets a little hurt, it's a perfect chance for you to make some small moves..."

Chi Buzi shook his head slightly and said in a deep voice, "Is this a place to talk?"

This courtyard was empty, without even a table or a chair, clearly not a place for conversation. Dangjiang led him to a small side courtyard. Once the door was closed, Chi Buzi said, "Whether Pristine Water is more or less hurt, it doesn't affect me much. But since the sign of Pristine Water has appeared, it's likely that the battle has reached a crucial point, and he might be coming back!"

Dangjiang was stunned and whispered, "He comes back, so what...? You don't cultivate Purging Dew, and you're going to cultivate Morning Cold Rain. How can he even suspect you? Even if he comes back... when he sees your path is cut off, he should be even more relaxed and let his guard down..."

Chi Buzi's face was grim. He said in a low voice, "You don't understand... you don't understand what Pristine Water is like... I have been to his Pristine Speech Heaven. He is a stingy True Monarch, a sinister person who pays attention to every detail... A person like that... a person like that will not let go of the slightest doubt..."

Dangjiang grew suspicious, looking at his grim face. He asked, "What do you want to do?"

Chi Buzi looked at him deeply, his tone cold. He replied, "I have been to his Pristine Speech Heaven. My life, my death, and my progress in cultivation are all within his sight. When he returns from beyond the heavens, all the clear ponds in the world will be his followers."

"I have cultivated the Chou-Gui Hidden Form. If he returns, he might pay attention to me."

Dangjiang understood even less. He shook his head and said, "The Chou-Gui Hidden Form is not the Purging Dew. The cultivation method is available, and there's no shortage of spiritual energy. So many people in the world cultivate it. It's not surprising that you succeeded. He can't investigate every single one, can he?"

Chi Buzi slowly shook his head and whispered, "I didn't use the 'Art of Rebirth,' yet I still succeeded. To Pristine Water, where this Purple Mansion cultivation method came from is worth investigating."

His light green eyes looked over, filled with extreme calm. His hands on the table clenched into fists, and he said in a low voice, "If I were him, I would definitely investigate. That's enough."

# Chapter 844: A Place of Secrets

A chill crept through Dangjiang. "Then what are you saying?" he asked.

Chi Buzi fixed him with an intense gaze, his pale azure eyes unwavering. "This is unavoidable," he began, his voice low. "The moment Pristine Water sees me, he'll grow suspicious of my cultivation. Do you really think he'll politely ask where I acquired the Chou-Gui Hidden Form, a Purple Mansion Realm technique? Whether I have it or not, he won't say a single word. He'll simply reach out and read my memories!"

"Once that happens, this will be about far more than a single Dharma Art!"

"And whether he finds anything or not, my death is certain. While you might remain safe in the heavens, you'll suffer a catastrophic loss and can forget about seeing anyone ever again."

Anxiety tightened its grip on Dangjiang. "What are you talking about? Weren't you chosen by the Immortal Lord? That True Monarch Lushui is only at the Golden Core realm. How could he possibly kill you?"

Chi Buzi shot him a somber look. "Chosen? What 'chosen'? When destiny presents an opportunity, the Immortal offers a path. If you can walk it, you do. If you fail, who cares if you die? Do you think the Immortal is short on Purple Mansion Realm cultivators? Is he going to return from beyond the heavens just to save me? It's one thing to borrow his name for a bit of clout, but you can't be naive enough to believe it's a guarantee of safety."

At his words, Dangjiang’s brow furrowed, his own anxiety mounting. 'He has a point,' he thought. 'Is there anyone in the heavens who doesn't possess some unfathomable power?'

Seeing Dangjiang at a loss for words, the hope in Chi Buzi’s heart faded into faint disappointment. "My cultivation is insignificant," he said. "But if something were to happen to me, I fear it would jeopardize the Celestial Palace's plans."

Dangjiang glanced at him as Chi Buzi continued, "I'm counting on you to plead on my behalf, to find a way out of this for me. If you could just get an audience with that Lord Zhengao from before, I believe there would be a chance."

Dangjiang hesitated. He himself needed Shaohui’s help just to see Zhengao, so he had little confidence. But this was a matter of life and death for Chi Buzi, a threat to his very path of cultivation. He had to try. He rose to his feet.

"You know how it is with that Lord," he said. "You can't just see him when you please. I only know the location of Lady Shaohui's celestial pavilion. I will go and ask for you."

But Chi Buzi was still filled with doubt.

He was a direct descendant of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and his mind was sharp. Over the years, he had learned more than a few secrets. He grabbed Dangjiang's arm. "The Immortal Lord… he governs yin and yang. It’s possible he has an incarnation in the mortal world. Ages ago, there was an immortal named Yingze who also held dominion over yin and yang. I wonder if they could be one and the same."

The suggestion made Dangjiang’s scalp tingle with dread. He wouldn't dare speculate on such a thing. "You want me to ask about the Immortal Lord's mortal incarnation? First, I have nowhere to ask. Second, I don't have the lifespan to survive asking! I couldn't even find out the name Immortal Official Li used when he descended to the mortal realm. This is a profound secret, a matter of celestial mystery. How could I possibly have the authority to inquire?"

"I'm not asking you to investigate..."

Chi Buzi looked at him, a headache forming. He knew for a fact that many people in the world were searching for Yingze, but the immortal never appeared, which was a deeply ominous sign. "This Pristine Water," he explained, "is known as one of the Six Scions of Chongming. His master *is* that immortal who governs yin and yang. He belongs to the orthodox Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition, and the number of immortals in his lineage is more than you can count on one hand. I’m not afraid of him picking a fight with the heavens. I’m afraid of what he might uncover, and the upheaval it could cause."

As Chi Buzi spoke, Dangjiang felt his blood run cold. His memories of a past life were of a minor water official in the Underworld; he had no frame of reference for figures of such terrifying power. "I understand," he said, his voice laced with fear.

"Be subtle," Chi Buzi urged. "Ask carefully."

At the instruction, Dangjiang lifted his head again. Masking his unease, he strode out, grumbling as he went, "Hmph. When it comes to delicate words, you think you're better than me? I don't need your coaching!"

He left through the courtyard gate. Only then did Chi Buzi allow himself to sit back down. He was, after all, in another's grotto-heaven. Even when alone, he dared not reveal a hint of emotion. He closed his eyes, entering a meditative state right where he sat.

White snow drifted down around him, slowly blanketing the courtyard. The fragrant scent of osmanthus blossoms filled the air—a scene that should have brought peace to one’s mind. But as he sat in stillness, his heart was a raging storm.

Chi Buzi’s words had been both a plea for help and a test. In that brief exchange, he had gauged Dangjiang’s position and keenly identified the crucial truth: he, Chi Buzi, was not important to the heavens. The Immortal's favor had been a casual gesture, and Zhengao had given Dangjiang no special orders concerning him.

This single piece of information gave rise to a deep-seated suspicion in the man's dark and cynical mind.

'This Immortal Lord is almost certainly Yingze. But he's been missing for years, which means he doesn't want the world to know of his existence. He must be advancing some secret plot. His relationship with Pristine Water can't be good. Since he's an immortal, the opportunity he gave me would never expose himself, nor would it allow Pristine Water to have any suspicions.'

'Once Pristine Water probes my memories, he'll find nothing. As for me... because I failed to complete my tasks before his return, I'll lose my life. No matter what Pristine Water does to me, my end will be a silent, unnoticed death. So, what role does Zhengao play in this? The method for seeking a Golden Core is priceless. How could I possibly earn it in just a few short years?'

He smelled a trap. A shadow instantly fell over his heart.

'Could it be that they're just using me? Making me hunt Demons for them all these years, knowing my offerings would never be enough. Then, when Pristine Water returns, I die, and that's that. They've already profited handsomely. They never had to find me a path to the Golden Core at all.'

Although Chi Buzi knew little about the true power behind the Immortal Palace, his mind worked in a particular way. He could extrapolate an outcome from the barest threads of self-interest in an instant. The conclusion was chilling: if his fortuitous encounter was not a deliberate part of some grand celestial scheme against Pristine Water, then the heavens would never disrupt their established plans for a pawn like him. He would most likely be left to die at the hands of Pristine Water.

***

Meanwhile, Dangjiang left the courtyard, walking with his head lowered. After a short while, he found a large pavilion within the palace. He presented his token, and a heavenly soldier went inside to announce him.

Soon, the soldier, clad in shimmering, scale-like armor and possessing handsome features, emerged. "Proofreader of the Profound Seven Pavilion," he announced in a clear voice, "the Celestial Attendant will see you."

Dangjiang had worried he would be turned away. Flooded with relief, he hurried forward, passed through a magnificent corridor, and entered a room where stacks of silvery-white jade slips were piled high. A woman in tea-white robes sat primly at a desk.

Shaohui looked weary. The stark white glow between her brows flickered faintly, a clear sign that recent days had not been easy. Seeing Dangjiang was no longer as irritating as it once was. "So it's you," she said. "Has something happened?"

Although Shaohui had been reassigned, Dangjiang was still nominally her subordinate, which was why he had been granted an audience. He immediately prostrated himself and cried out, "Years ago, Immortal Official Liu entrusted me with the duty of looking after the talented individual selected by the Immortal Lord! But now he has encountered a heavenly calamity and his life is in peril! I came to ask for your guidance, my lady!"

Shaohui frowned at his words. She knew he was talking about Chi Buzi. She had no time for such trivial matters, but she also wanted to avoid any blame. "What sort of trouble?" she asked.

"It's the same matter as before," Dangjiang said from the floor. "The True Monarch who oversees his Fruition Attainment, True Monarch Lushui, is about to return from beyond the heavens. My subordinate's breakthrough was achieved through a connection I facilitated, a connection that leads back to the heavens. The True Monarch will likely seek him out, and we fear it will cause trouble."

Shaohui shook her head. "Who would dare make trouble for the heavens? Let him be. When that True Monarch hears the heavens are involved, he won't kill him. The only issue is that the heavens have not yet revealed themselves to the mortal world. A sudden exposure might draw the ire of those above."

Shaohui's words resonated with Dangjiang's deepest fears. He wasn't as concerned about Pristine Water as the cautious Chi Buzi was; he was terrified of messing up the plans of his superiors. After he finished his obeisance, Shaohui spoke.

"Wait here. I will go and see the Lord."

Overjoyed, Dangjiang nodded eagerly and began to wait in the pavilion. After an anxious half-hour, there was finally movement. The woman in the tea-white celestial dress re-entered the pavilion, her expression thoughtful.

Seeing Shaohui step inside, Dangjiang hurried forward and asked respectfully, "My lady?"

Shaohui gave a slight shake of her head. "I consulted the Lord and received a few pieces of information. I will share them with you."

Her expression turned grave. She spoke with deliberation. "First, the Lord has issued no decree. The Immortal Lord taught him a Dharma Art merely as a reward for watching over you. He has no other connection to the heavens. It is not yet time for the heavens to manifest in the world. If he is captured by this Pristine Water, the trail of the immortals will simply go cold. There is no risk of exposing any trace of the heavens."

The words left a bitter taste in Dangjiang's mouth. He finally understood the full weight of Chi Buzi's suspicions.

Shaohui continued, "Second, considering his sincere desire for immortality, Lord Zhengao has left him a sliver of a chance. If he truly feels that Pristine Water will harm him, he may request a celestial official from the heavens to assess his situation and see if there is any room for maneuver."

Dangjiang's heart sank. "And which official might he request?" he asked weakly.

A wry, helpless smile touched Shaohui's lips. "Me."

She rose from behind the desk. "Go on. Bring him here."

Dangjiang had no choice but to retreat. He hurried back to the courtyard, where Chi Buzi sat unmoving at the table. With a grim face, Dangjiang quietly relayed the two messages.

Chi Buzi, however, let out a sigh of relief. He lowered his head. "Good. Take me to see her."

The news Dangjiang brought was not surprising. Chi Buzi had anticipated that Zhengao would leave him a path to survival, however narrow. This was enough. In fact, he had felt the shadow of this danger looming for a long time.

'The moment I went to that island to see Li Qinghong, I had to be prepared to be crushed by Pristine Water at any time. His return is neither unexpected nor premature.'

Back when he had spoken to Li Qinghong of betraying Pristine Water, Chi Buzi had only one thought:

'If I die, I die. I have to try!'

His resolve today was exactly the same.

He lowered his head, a look of grim satisfaction and burning ambition on his face. He wound his way through corridors past celestial generals and attendants, climbed the steps of the pavilion, and slowly approached Shaohui's desk. With a thud, he fell to his knees.

"Many thanks to my lady for saving my life!" he said with utmost respect.

Shaohui had never liked him, but seeing a great Daoist Master prostrate himself before her so completely, she composed herself and said softly, "Do you have a plan?"

Chi Buzi looked up, his pale azure eyes bright and full of spirit, without a trace of despair. "I am unwilling to give up this chance to enter the grotto-heaven and meet the immortals," he said in a low voice. "Nor am I willing to abandon my path. The only strategy now is to deceive Pristine Water."

"And to deceive him, I must not remember anything myself. As long as I know I'm lying, the True Monarch will know I'm lying."

Shaohui studied his expression. Though she had always disliked the man before her, she couldn't help but be moved by his conviction. "Continue," she said.

"I believe the only way for me to not know is to have my memories removed and stored somewhere else," Chi Buzi said softly. "After Pristine Water has inspected me and left, the memories can be returned. Only then can I escape his scrutiny. Once he returns to the Pristine Speech Heaven to recuperate, it will be much harder for him to keep an eye on me."

Shaohui frowned slightly as Chi Buzi continued, "I need a method to alter my memories right under the nose of a True Monarch without being discovered."

The celestial attendant before him shook her head. "It's more complicated than that. No jade slip can be used to record memories related to the heavens. The only way is to peel away a part of your soul to store them. But splitting a soul is far beyond the abilities of you or me."

"Besides," she added, "the pain of splitting one's soul is worse than being flayed alive."

Chi Buzi had not even considered the pain.

From his humble beginnings in the Azure Pond to his current station, he, Chi Buzi, had survived by unscrupulously seizing every opportunity that flashed before him. No matter how small the chance, even if it was a mere crack, he would scrape bone and shed skin to squeeze through it like a weed.

Chi Wei, Zhengao, Demons, or gods—whatever the powers that be needed him to be, Chi Buzi would become. With the Golden Core realm ahead, nothing was too precious to discard, and nothing was too bitter to accept.

'By my power alone, even if I were flayed alive a thousand times, I could never escape Pristine Water's grasp. He would crush me like an ant. But I don't need much. With just a sliver of assistance from a power on his level, I will have the right to deceive him.'

But upon hearing Shaohui's words, Chi Buzi did not nod in agreement. A chill went through him. "If I split my soul, how could Pristine Water not see it?" he countered.

"He won't waste time wondering what tricks I have up my sleeve. He doesn't need to. He won't bother with countermeasures. The moment he sees a matter involving a Golden Core breakthrough that could shake his Fruition Attainment, combined with a profound technique like soul-splitting, he won't permit anyone to interfere. He'll ignore any pressure from the Underworld and kill me with a single glance."

Shaohui pondered this for a moment. "I can ask about a method for separating memories," she said quietly. "Perhaps there is a spiritual artifact that can accomplish it. But how can you guarantee Pristine Water will leave? If he is as cunning as you say, he might return without a trace and leave just as stealthily. Without your memories, how will you know when to restore them? It's practically impossible!"

"Furthermore, even if you wait for him to leave and regain your memories, how will you know when he might suddenly reappear? A Golden Core cultivator can manifest in the mortal world in an instant! If the thought ever crosses his mind, he only needs to take half a step out of the Pristine Speech Heaven, and he'll immediately know everything!"

Seeing Shaohui shaking her head repeatedly, Chi Buzi remained calm. "This may seem difficult," he said in a low voice, "but in truth, I only need those memories when it is time to make an offering."

"As long as you, my lady, can find a way for me to deceive his eyes, I can arrange it so that I am drawn to hunt Demons, arrive at a certain secret location where I will remember this matter, make my offering to the heavens, and then forget it all again before I leave."

Shaohui's expression grew serious. She stared intently into his eyes, a deep and profound doubt surfacing. "Is there truly a secret place that even a True Monarch cannot see?"

Chi Buzi's eyes narrowed slightly. As he looked down, his expression took on an icy, calculated calm.

"I do, in fact, know of such a place. A corner of the world that even a True Monarch cannot perceive."



# Chapter 845: A Plea for Help

“In his travels through Yue State all those years ago, Li Jiangqun once mentioned a place, a place that is normally hidden by layers of grand barrier formations. It not only severs all connection to the Great Void, but the final layer is an Immortal Dao array so potent that not even a True Monarch can see through it!”

“That area also holds a Merging Fire called the 'Immortal Dao Wall', left behind by an ancient Immortal Lord. Li Jiangqun himself said that True Monarchs shouldn't even get close to this place. In fact... they dare not!”

Chi Buzi lowered his voice. “Such a place, and yet Li Jiangqun had a way to get in. He told Ning Tiaoxiao, he told Zipei and Qiushui, and he even told… Xiao Xianyou! In the end, this place was no secret to the Supreme and Golden Feather Sect Daoist traditions...”

“Although that Immortal Dao Wall can’t connect to the Great Void, the spiritual essence and laws there are the same as in ancient times. Disciples from both the Green Pine Supreme Yang and Golden Oneness of Highest Azure traditions often visit it.”

Shaohui nodded as she listened. Though she had no impression of the names spoken, she had a rough idea of what was coming. Se frowned and asked, “Are you saying it's hidden in that...?”

Chi Buzi bowed again.

“If you, esteemed lady, have a suitable method, perhaps a spiritual artifact or a sensory array, I only need to determine the location beneath the Immortal Dao Wall. Once I’m there, I’ll remember.”

“Beyond that… I also have a Chou-Gui Hidden Form Life Divine Ability. Unlike the Purging Dew, this ability’s inheritance is not completely broken in this era. Some in the Purple Mansion Realm have it. Pristine Water deliberately didn’t pass it down, which is why it's not at Azure Pond… I heard the copy at Azure Pond was obtained from the Chunyi Dao Gate.”

“When I entered Anhuai Heaven, I couldn't find this method… If I don't obtain its origin, Pristine Water will certainly grow suspicious of me…”

He was subtly trying to get Shaohui to solve his problem. Shaohui frowned. “I knew this was going to be a hassle, but I didn't know it was this much of one.”

Fearing that Shaohui was getting intimidated, Chi Buzi reported in a low voice, “This cultivation method isn't without origin. The Feathered Serpent once had it, and after being swallowed by the Hornless Dragon, it fell into the hands of the Dragon-kin… The Dragon-kin even have the Purging Dew's Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method.”

“The Wu State's Mount Changhuai, the Great Western Plateau’s White Victory Palace, and North Star Lady of the Northern Sea have all produced Daoist Masters of the Chou-Gui Hidden Form. Both the Immortal Mansion and the Chunyi Dao Gate have the Pristine Water Daoist orthodoxies.”

“The Immortal Mansion might not be suitable, but as long as it exists in the present world… it’s perfectly reasonable for me to have obtained it. It's worth a try.”

A glimmer of intelligence sparked in Chi Buzi’s eyes as he rattled off a string of names. “I was once puzzled why all five Pristine Water traditions weren’t cut off. Only Purging Dew was, and I thought it was due to offending the Underworld...”

“It was only later, after listening to Immortal General Zhengao explain, that I understood another reason: those three Chou-Gui Hidden Form traditions are a supplement to Valley Water. It’s not just an issue for Pristine Water alone; it might concern certain people's pursuit of Valley Water, and even several Daoist orthodoxies that achieved enlightenment through it. Therefore, they couldn't just cut it off…”

“And as for the cultivators of Azure Pond, all he could do was not pass down the Chou-Gui Hidden Form cultivation method and instead spread the Clear Dusk Rain's Fruition Attainment to sever the path for lower-level cultivators.”

Shaohui sighed deeply, signaling that she understood. She lowered her voice. “You go report this to me first, then ask someone to find Immortal Official Liu. After all, it was he who pushed this matter onto Dangjiang, so it should rightfully be his to manage now… You go back and try to find a cultivation method for yourself. I don't have the ability to arrange everything for you.”

Chi Buzi bowed respectfully. “Don’t worry, esteemed lady.”

Shaohui stood up, and Chi Buzi followed, a slight worry in his heart.

‘The heavens should be able to receive me from the Merging Fire… but if they can't bypass the Immortal Lord's techniques, then this is a dead end!’

Dangjiang, who had been listening to the conversation, couldn't help but interject.

“If it doesn’t work out… why not seize the opportunity to push for the Golden Core? Isn't that better than living so subserviently under him? Besides, when he returns, won’t your chances of a breakthrough be even smaller?”

Chi Buzi gently shook his head. “A breakthrough? Where would I suddenly get a cultivation method and Golden Core formula from? And how do I know when he’ll return? If I don’t prepare, I’ll just be waiting to get my head cut off. A battle like that wouldn’t last for decades. He might already be back, just healing from his wounds in his cave abode.”

He lowered his eyes. “Besides… I doubt what the outside world is fighting about. Who knows what Pristine Water’s plans are?”

After walking for a while, the three of them soon arrived at Zhengao’s high platform. The Immortal General was still sitting there, but the decor on either side had slightly changed, and the bamboo scrolls that were previously in front of him were gone.

“We meet again,” Zhengao said calmly, watching the three of them bow.

“Shaohui has already told me about your matter.”

Chi Buzi’s self-rescue was not an accident. From beginning to end, Lu Jiangxian's attitude towards him was to stall for as long as possible. From his abrupt arrival at Moongaze Lake, to his pledge of allegiance on Zongquan Island, and even the final supplement to Valley Water, it was all forced by Chi Buzi’s step-by-step eagerness for the Dao.

But none of this could avoid the problem of Pristine Water.

‘Erasing my own traces from Pristine Water’s eyes is easy, but protecting Chi Buzi is much more difficult!’

Years ago, when Chi Buzi rashly came to the lake, Lu Jiangxian’s strength was far from recovered. After examining Chi Buzi’s soul, he discovered the technique Pristine Speech Heaven had left behind. To avoid awakening the secluded Pristine Water, he could not use soul-searching to change the memories, so he resorted to a less direct method, using Dangjiang, a split soul of Maha, as a failsafe to restrain him.

As Lu Jiangxian's strength grew exponentially after obtaining that Immortal Dao spell art, Chi Buzi's threat diminished. Dangjiang eventually returned to the Immortal Mansion, and Chi Buzi also gained a patron, but Lu Jiangxian always held a utilitarian attitude towards this Demon.

Now, after receiving several offerings from the Purple Mansion Realm, he truly did not want to lose such a powerful aid. So, he gave Shaohui a reply in Zhengao’s name, and Chi Buzi also gave his answer.

‘The most critical part of this matter is modifying memories… It's not impossible now. If he opens up his mind, I can bypass Pristine Water's technique. But whether Pristine Water believes it or not, or if it succeeds or not… how can Chi Buzi, under his watchful eye, continue to inexplicably gather Demon beasts for me? Not only is the risk great, but the benefit to me is almost nothing now.’

‘What’s more, Chi Buzi is deliberately holding back some information to make this seem less difficult. Pristine Water can’t possibly fail to recognize which cultivation method produced that Life Divine Ability. The Chou-Gui Hidden Form was formed by Talisman Qi inducing a celestial foundation, which means only his copy of the Chou-Gui Hidden Form's Purple Mansion Realm chapter would work. Any other copy would be a mismatch.’

The only good news was that Pristine Water hadn't bestowed the Daoist tradition. The copy of the Chou-Gui Hidden Form at Azure Pond was obtained by the Chi family from the Chunyi Dao Gate. If that copy had been given by Pristine Water, with the Purple Mansion Realm chapter in his hands, then Chi Buzi would be at a dead end.

Lu Jiangxian weighed the options in his mind, already sighing inwardly.

“How difficult it is to deceive a Golden Core cultivator! He's just talking big. If Chi Buzi can get the Chou-Gui Hidden Form's Purple Mansion Realm chapter, it might be worth saving him, at least to ensure I leave no trace myself.”

In comparison, Lu Jiangxian was much more interested in that Merging Fire!

After all, what caused his strength to leap forward was the Three-Drum Wall in the Green Pine grotto-heaven. Ultimately, this Three-Drum Wall was also a Merging Fire, which meant that the immortal spell art Lu Jiangxian had been looking for finally had a lead!

“No wonder… no wonder I was wandering all over the Eastern Sea with the Li family and never found a trace of this thing. It was hidden deep in the sea… and with several layers of barriers and even an Immortal Dao array strengthening it, I wonder if I can pass through it.”

He fell silent for a moment, listening to Shaohui report the news. He paused, showing a hint of interest. “A treasure trove that can hide from a True Monarch? Perhaps it's a trace of my heavenly origins. You should go there and see if you can contact the heavens.”

Chi Buzi immediately bowed respectfully. In terms of cultivation, only this one Immortal General in the heavens could earn his respect. That lecture on the Dao was so profound it would not be an exaggeration to say he was a celestial being!

After asking this, Zhengao said casually, “To break through your Divine Ability, you need to find the Chou-Gui Hidden Form's Purple Mansion Realm chapter from the lower realms. How could the heavens have a record of something written by some cultivator from the recent past?”

Hearing this, Chi Buzi suddenly felt a rush of relief and both surprise and joy.

‘That incredibly mysterious item… it really did use the celestial foundation to cultivate the Divine Ability through resonance!’

He, of course, knew that different cultivation methods led to slightly different Divine Abilities, but his Divine Ability had broken through without any cultivation method. He was worried that he wouldn't be able to find a corresponding one and hadn't dared to ask. Now that Zhengao had mentioned it, he felt immense relief.

‘It’s true! It’s true! As long as I can find the source of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method, it will be fine… The Chunyi Dao Gate is full of fools from top to bottom; there are so many loopholes to exploit!’

His eyes immediately sparkled. He bowed and said, “Thank you for your guidance, esteemed sir!”

Zhengao gave a slight nod of his chin, indicating that he understood. He said softly, “Since you've made this decision, you'll have to face that True Monarch sooner or later. It's better to plan early. When you get the cultivation method, report back to Shaohui.”

Upon hearing this, Chi Buzi was relieved, but Dangjiang grew tense. He asked in a low voice, “May I ask, esteemed sir… what is the cost of this Immortal Merit…?”

Lu Jiangxian was anxious for Chi Buzi to quickly settle his retreat and start gathering Demon beasts for him, so he immediately said in a gentle voice, “No need to worry. This will be recorded under Immortal Official Liu’s name… But you, Chi Buzi, you need to hurry and exchange for the Morning Cold Rain cultivation method. At the very least, you should cultivate a celestial foundation. After you’ve had your memories altered, cultivating it to the Divine Ability realm will be the best kind of protection. It’s more reassuring than a thousand words, and it will quell that True Monarch's suspicions.”

In reality, Lu Jiangxian added this extra piece of advice because he was already halfway done writing that cultivation method and could hand it over to him soon.

The Morning Cold Rain was not a rare cultivation method to begin with. The vault had at least a dozen copies. The Foundation Establishment Realm chapter was done in a blink, and the Purple Mansion Realm chapter didn't require any specific rank or secret technique, so he wrote it smoothly. It was a cinch.

Chi Buzi understood what he meant. He was more eager than anyone to cultivate this technique, and his heart was filled with anxiety. He nodded repeatedly, bowing respectfully.

“Thank you for your guidance, esteemed sir. This humble cultivator will go at once.”

He bowed respectfully and said, “As long as I can get my life back from Pristine Water’s clutches, Buzi will not disappoint you!”

*

The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity.

The moonlight was crystalline and clear. Lu Jiangxian stood beside the white, translucent jade throne, his gaze piercing through the many residences, falling upon the two individuals in the small pavilion.

Several rays of colored light emerged from thin air, converging in front of him, and flowing within his palm. They quickly condensed into a tiny speck of light.

“Chi Buzi is truly efficient. Yu Guang and Merciful One have already been offered up to me…”

This peacock was far more capable than the previous female one. The one who had been refined into Talisman Qi had only Buddhist cultivation methods in her mind from beginning to end. This one, at least, had some Immortal Dao foundation, and scattered spell arts. What was even more rare was that he also had a Merging Fire cultivation method.

A fifth-grade Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method, the ‘Karma Flame Binding Heart Art,’ which forges the ‘Black-Eyed Desire’ immortal foundation.

Besides this ‘Karma Flame Binding Heart Art,’ Yu Guang also had a couple of secret arts related to the Great Peacock Karma, and Lu Jiangxian learned that this Demon peacock’s ancestors once had a great Buddhist cultivators, and was even a mount for the Revered One Su Xikong!

‘No wonder they say peacocks have a great voice in the Buddhist Land. With a background like that, how could they not?’

He flicked his finger, and placed this ‘Karma Flame Binding Heart Art’ on a high shelf. The peacock's soul was then separated.

These Merciful One were indeed easy to get, but their cultivation was truly pitiful. Their understanding of the Immortal Dao and talent were equally underwhelming. Yu Guang was a bit better than the female peacock, but only slightly. If he were to be released, it would simply be one more person to talk to.

He had no choice but to store it away for later use, his mind pondering deeply as he looked at the soul.

‘At least it’s a Purple Mansion Realm soul. It's very useful for performing shamanic arts. With this soul in hand, I’ll at least have a trump card.’

‘As for Pristine Water… he might be returning soon.’

Chi Buzi was just a useful chess piece to him. Once Pristine Water returned, this chess piece would be either dead or useless. In any case, he wouldn't be able to provide Demon beasts for him anymore. His memory would be temporarily lost, but even a useless Chi Buzi was better than a dead one. When the time was right, if Chi Buzi were to achieve enlightenment on the Valley Water path, it could lead to a massive turning point.

‘I’m bound to face Pristine Water sooner or later. One more piece is better than one less.’

He calmed his mind and looked out through the mirror.

In the depths of the Great Void, in places no one could see, a vast, bright light was slowly descending. A powerful sense of resonance rose from a distance, and the world within the mirror also shimmered with a bright radiance, making Lu Jiangxian slowly raise his eyebrows.

Even with Lu Jiangxian's mastery over Metallic Essence, the sliver of Bright Yang Metallic Essence locked in the mirror began to stir. The tallest and most luxurious heavenly gate at the entrance of the entire palace shone brilliantly and trembled slightly.

Various Bright Yang spiritual energies and Bright Yang radiances intertwined in the sky, dyeing the entire firmament a golden yellow.

Lu Jiangxian raised his hand, and that sliver of Bright Yang Metallic Essence emerged from his fingertips, like a handful of conical golden light. It rapidly expanded and changed, condensing into a series of faces.

All the radiance suddenly contracted, finally transforming back into a single scene at his fingertips.

It was a dark and eerie mine. The first ray of sunlight in the sky was pouring down from the clouds, landing on the various miners, their bodies mixed with blood and sweat. A young man with a slightly pale, yet resolute, face slowly raised his head.

‘The Bright Yang Fruition Attainment… has chosen its person.’

# Chapter 846: The Heir Apparent

Moongaze Lake.

The lake water was a serene azure, and a continuous spring rain fell. Gentle breezes drifted along the shore, leaving the small courtyard on the islet in silence. The two kumquat trees by the gate swayed slightly, their leaves droopy and listless from being shaded by the eaves and denied sunlight, even with the spring wind stirring them.

Li Xinghan stood in the courtyard, a precious sword hanging from her waist.

She was now at the seventh level of Qi Refining, firmly in the late stage. As a direct descendant of the Li Family, she was due to enter the mountains, take pills, and go into secluded cultivation once she reached the late stage of Qi Refining. She had heard that a few pills would be enough to help her attempt a breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Not knowing how many years this journey would take, she had come home to see her parents.

Hearing the commotion, her mother came out of the house with a smile to greet her, while her father sat sideways on the doorstep, his head bowed.

Ever since her maternal uncle, Chì Tiàozōng, had been promoted and the matter of her brother's official position had led to a falling-out with her parents and brother, Li Xinghan had rarely visited home. She mostly sent letters. Now, looking at the courtyard, it was eerily quiet, the laughter of previous years long gone.

It was clear that the influence of her uncle, Chì Tiàozōng, and her own influence were worlds apart. Although her brother had managed to secure a government post, it was a poor one in some remote place. Her brother and sister-in-law had moved out, leaving only their two aging parents to live in the quiet courtyard.

Seeing this, Li Xinghan’s heart felt heavy. She tried to say a few pleasant words, but her father was clearly still angry with her. He answered with a curt face and a few clipped words, perhaps also blaming her for the pain of their family's separation.

Unable to stay any longer, Li Xinghan announced her impending secluded cultivation for Foundation Establishment. As it was an endeavor where one either succeeded or died, her mother froze in shock, her eyes welling up with tears.

Her father finally lowered his legs from the threshold, his mouth opening as if to speak, but his face remained cold. Li Xinghan sighed, saying, "The family head still needs to see me... I've already visited my uncle. I just came to bid you both farewell."

She looked at her father, who had aged significantly, and her voice softened.

"Father... my brother isn't very capable. Even when he was managing the hands at a mining branch, he was a total mess. The only reason Qingdu didn't arrest him was because he finally listened to my uncle's advice and stopped taking bribes.

"Now, Jiangqian is in charge of the family. He's sharp-eyed and surely saw through my brother's ineptitude. The one overseeing the eastern shore is the Second Young Master, Li Jianglong. He has shown me favor, and I often hear news that he is tolerating my brother's actions out of consideration for me...

"If I fail my breakthrough and word of my death reaches you, please have my brother resign from his post early. Brother Zhoufang has already gone through enough trouble for our kin. There's no need for us to bother him again later."

She wasn't sure if her father had listened, and she turned to leave. He remained motionless, watching her go, while her mother saw her out of the courtyard and quickly returned, crouching by his side to wipe away tears.

Only then did her father stand up, listening as his wife whispered, "Look at you, you agreed to him... to say a good word for Zhoutui to inherit Master Chenghui's legacy, but you got cold feet again... and now you can't give him an answer..."

Her father closed his eyes and shook his head. "Forget it. Our daughter is stubborn and proud. Now that she's attempting Foundation Establishment, how can she possibly listen to such talk? It might even affect her state of mind. Whether Li Zhoutui lives or dies is not worth her life... and as for his legacy, he can go die somewhere far away and not get involved with my family."

He sighed and said, "Aren't there a few temples for the immortals on the eastern shore? Tomorrow... come with me to pray."

"I heard the Merciful One Temple by the river is more effective," his wife suggested.

Her father shook his head vigorously. "You're confused, too. A member of the Li Family praying to the Merciful One? Aren't you afraid of being crushed by a falling beam inside the temple? Forget it... we'll go to the eastern shore!"

Li Xinghan summoned the wind and soared into the air, landing inside the main hall. She lifted her gaze and saw a Qi Refining cultivator standing near the hall's entrance. He had a remarkably ugly face with a pointed jaw and sunken cheeks. Her brother, Li Zhoufang, was speaking with him, his expression awkward. Seeing Li Xinghan, he looked as if he had been granted a great pardon and hurried over.

"This is Fifth Young Master," he said.

It turned out this man was Li Jiangnian. By his age, he was only around eighteen, so his talent must have been decent. His appearance, however, did not reflect his age at all.

His gaze was downcast, as he dared not look at Li Xinghan. This wasn't directed at her personally; on the Immortal Dao, where everyone was stunningly handsome, his ugliness was especially pronounced, causing him to hunch his shoulders and mumble, "Greetings, Aunt."

Li Jiangnian's voice was unremarkable, at least much better than his face. Clearly, his resolve was far weaker than his brothers', as he lacked the courage to look others in the eye.

Li Xinghan sighed internally and exchanged a polite greeting before entering. The seat for Li Jiangliang on the other side was empty. The Fourth Young Master must have gone to the river with Cui Jueyin.

The two sisters of the Jiangque generation were both at the Purple Smoke Gate, and of the Zhouxing generation, only she and her brother, Li Zhoufang, were allowed into this hall. She glanced around and immediately went up to bow to Li Minggong and Li Xuanxuan.

"Greetings, masters!"

Li Minggong smiled and nodded, gesturing to a square-faced young man who stood nearby. He looked about twenty, with bright eyes. Li Xinghan was familiar with this one; he was Li Zhoufang's treasured son, the recently cultivated Li Jiangzong, who was currently by Li Minggong's side.

Li Jiangzong was very familiar with her and paid his respects. Only then did Li Xinghan return to her seat beside Li Zhouming. The red-robed young master had broken his bad habit of being late and had arrived early, sitting properly, which made Li Xinghan smile.

"Swish!"

Li Zhouming opened his fan, using it to cover his mouth as he spoke in a low voice.

"I say, little sister... I'm a bit strapped for cash these days. Shòuyú has confiscated all my things and will only let me make hairpins for her... do you have one or two pieces of spirit iron or materials I could use to pay off some debts to other families..."

Li Xinghan let out a laugh. "You've got some nerve. Go see Uncle Chenghao for spirit iron... I'm not in charge, nor do I manage things. Where would I get such things?"

Just then, Li Jiangqian's soft voice echoed through the hall. "Now that all our clansmen have arrived, let's discuss the matter of Grand Uncle Chenghui."

At his words, the gathered clansmen quieted. Li Jiangqian continued, "This matter should have been settled long ago, but our brothers are either away or in secluded cultivation, so it has been difficult to gather everyone. Now that Aunt Xinghan is also about to go into seclusion for her breakthrough, it's the perfect time to make a decision."

Li Chenghui had no heirs and left no written will, making the matter of his succession very complicated. After so many years of delay, Li Zhouda, the oldest and most talented, was already in the middle stage of Qi Refining and was nearing the age to attempt Foundation Establishment in just a few years. He had personally visited Li Xuanxuan, hoping to put the matter on the agenda.

After all, a breakthrough to Foundation Establishment was a life-or-death moment, the very time when one most needed the legacy of Li Chenghui, from cultivation methods and spell arts to spiritual artifacts and resources. Even his official lineage and status, if not decided now, would become meaningless later. Not only would they lose their greatest value, but it would also breed resentment.

And that coveted Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman, although said to be a clan item and not part of the inherited Daoist tradition, everyone knew that whoever first obtained the Daoist tradition and successfully cultivated the way of lightning would ultimately wield the spiritual artifact.

In addition, there was an even more critical issue: Li Chenghui's father, Li Xì'è, had passed away a few days ago.

Although Li Xì'è was a mere mortal, he was Li Chenghui's father! While he never said anything, his heart must have favored his closest blood relative, Li Zhoutui, as the successor. With his death, the lineage of Li Zhoutui suffered a major blow.

Of course, even if a few of the higher-ups felt this way, they continued to publicly state that they were waiting for the elders to return, as pleasantries still needed to be said.

Li Jiangqian paused slightly. Li Xuanxuan spoke in a hoarse voice, "There were originally three candidates: Zhouda, Zhoutui, and Zhouxun. Zhouda is the most talented and has the fiercest temperament, which is well-suited to the way of lightning. However, his fiery nature also presents difficulties..."

"Zhoutui has a closer bloodline, but like Zhouxun, he lacks talent..."

Everyone present was well aware of the three candidates. Li Zhoutui was the closest in bloodline and the most suitable. Had he not made that impatient, presumptuous wail back then, the matter would have been settled in his favor. This whole long process would have been avoided.

But his family elders lacked self-control, and his outburst had soured the goodwill of several Foundation Establishment cultivators towards him. Over the years, Li Zhoutui had enjoyed excellent resources, yet his cultivation was only comparable to Li Zhouxun, who had gone out to manage the fields. Both were still in the Embryonic Breathing stage, which only made things worse for him.

As for Li Zhouxun, his talent was passable. In the past, he came from a poor family and was taken in by Li Chenghui, thus gaining some rights to the inheritance. However, Li Chenghui might have only been observing him and never said a word about it, so he couldn't have been named the successor at the time.

Yet, he later voluntarily gave up and went to the island to manage the spiritual fields. If Li Zhouda hadn't been an option, he would have had a great chance, but compared to him now, his prospects had dimmed.

After Li Xuanxuan finished speaking, he looked around. The others lowered their heads in thought, and no one spoke up, knowing there was no dissent. He then said, "Let's have Zhouda come in and see for himself!"

Soon, a stocky man in leather armor entered from the side. He was robust, with a square face, thick brows, and large eyes. He looked somewhat similar to Li Wen, but while Li Wen had a simple-minded demeanor, this man was clearly someone who had seen blood, a great deal more ferocious, with eyes that shone brightly.

He quickly walked to the front of the hall and, without fear, bowed and said, "Greetings to all the elders and brothers!"

Li Xuanxuan nodded and said, "This is Li Zhouda. He currently holds a position at Yùtíng, handling tasks like slaying Demons and expelling evil."

The old man looked around again. Only Li Zhoufang hesitated for a moment, glancing at Li Xinghan, who, having a good impression of Li Zhouda, spoke softly, "I have stayed by the lake for a while. This brother is diligent and responsible. Among the clansmen, he's one of the most hardworking."

With Li Xinghan's endorsement, Li Zhoufang remained silent. As both were his kinsmen, he certainly wouldn't speak up for Li Zhoutui against his promising sister. The old man noticed this and nodded. "All the elders think highly of you. You just need to temper your personality a bit."

"This junior accepts your guidance!" Li Zhouda grinned and bowed to everyone. Li Minggong stood up and said, "I'll take you to Qingdu. All the rituals on the mountain should be ready."

The clansmen followed Li Minggong to Qingdu, leaving only Li Xinghan and a few others. Li Xuanxuan sighed, "He is good, yes, but only because we have Jiangqian and others to oversee the big picture. We won't rely solely on him in the future. That's why I dared to choose him. We won't need him to be the head of Qingdu, but he can certainly hold down a few peaks."

Li Zhouda was exemplary in every way, save for his overly righteous and volatile temper and his lack of verbal skill. He would often champion justice within the clan, which earned him the support of many clansmen, but it was not considered a safe path on the road of cultivation.

Li Jiangqian had been waiting for this matter to be settled. His gaze was profound as he sipped his tea. "When word of this gets out, it will be alright for the lone Zhouxun, but the Zhoutui faction will likely have some complaints.

"That's one thing. The other is that Uncle Zhouda has a fiery temper and can't stand petty gossip... my suggestion is that as soon as the formalities are complete, he should be sent into secluded cultivation immediately. That way, he won't hear any of it, and by the time he comes out in a few years, the matter will have faded, and there will be far fewer disputes."

Li Xuanxuan was most afraid of such trouble and could only sigh. In truth, they all understood that at this point, they had no choice but to pick Li Zhouda. Li Zhoutui would likely remain a Qi Refining cultivator forever.

The old man glanced at Li Xinghan and said in a gentle voice, "As for that Essence Gathering Pills of yours, I sent people to inquire with various families a couple of years ago. We eventually obtained one refined by Yùzhēn from the Sword Gate and traded it for one of our own.

"I will also take you to your cave dwelling later and teach you the proper sequence for taking the pills needed for your breakthrough to Foundation Establishment."

Since the Li Family possessed a Talisman Pill, they could achieve a breakthrough without any side effects. As they could not reveal the pill, the Li Family had devised various methods over the years. Li Jiangqian had even managed to mix the Talisman Pill into a selection of other pills by wrapping it in a pill skin, so that when the final breakthrough occurred, it would simply be attributed to an unusually effective combination of medicines.

Li Xinghan bowed in gratitude and withdrew from the hall. Li Jiangqian then waved his hand, dismissing the others on either side. Seeing Li Xuanxuan's worried face, he smiled and said, "Elder, you don't need to worry so much. He may be temperamental and enjoy a good fight, but he's not an idiot. Look at how he spends his days fighting and brawling, sticking up for his clansmen, and how he fights Demons without regard for his life. Isn't he building a reputation? A family needs a direct descendant who is a powerful fighter and a hothead, willing to risk his life, and with such high cultivation... it's a very interesting way of getting what you want."

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard, and Li Jiangqian spoke in a low voice, "I received news that Li Quantao is already stationed at Lake Xian, and his son has gone to Baijiang Creek to travel around that area. The surrounding families aren't bothering him.

"Master Li Xizhi has been transferred east to guard the Eastern Sea for Azure Pond. He has been given a larger area, from Green Pine Island all the way to Tai'e Island near Crimson Reef Island. He has full authority to command it. His status now... is comparable to that of Sect Master Dantai Jin."

A smile appeared on his face as he continued, "There's also news that Fei Qingyi has made her first public appearance since marrying Qín Xiǎn. It's said she's been invited to guard the Eastern Sea and will be placed under Master Li XIzhi's command. Dantai Jin sent a large group of people with her, and she is highly valued.

"This person is sharp-eyed..."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head. "When the Sima Family was at its peak, she avoided them and didn't even contact her own family, yet she never forgot to fawn over our family, even giving away a spiritual artifact for Foundation Establishment. Now that Ning Wan has come out of seclusion, it's immediately seen as a signal from the Sima Family to show goodwill to the Ning family... Call it good fortune or cleverness, she has finally escaped the sinking ship of the Fei family and is soaring higher and higher."

Li Jiangqian paused, then rose from his main seat and walked out the door. He seemed to sense something and looked north.

'Inward Heart Surging Profundity is beneficial for the Immortal Dao and secluded cultivation, and it can clear the twelve vital breaths.'

'To break through at the very moment a True Monarch descends... there is something suspicious about this.'

In the north, heavy snow fell, blanketing the distance in white. Spring snow was not a particularly surprising phenomenon, but Li Jiangqian observed the extent of the snowfall and smiled.

"They've come just as I expected... After all these years, the Fei family has finally produced their own Foundation Establishment cultivator... but Fei Qingyi... might be in for another headache."

# Chapter 847: Baiku

At Cold Cloud Peak, snow drifted through the small courtyard and thick frost clung to the steps. A group of cultivators in white robes knelt outside a cave dwelling. The stout man leading them pressed his forehead to the ground, his face a mix of awe and delight.

"Welcome, honored sir, from your closed-door cultivation!"

The wind and snow before him stirred slightly, and a young man emerged from the courtyard, the very elements clinging to his robes. He bent down slowly, helping the middle-aged man to his feet. He clapped him on the shoulder and chuckled.

"This is a day for celebration, Uncle Tongcai, there's no need for such formality," said Fei Qing'yi with a laugh. "The North-South conflict drained our family's vitality, and with only a few elders like you remaining, we must all shoulder the burden together."

Though a bit stout, Fei Tongcai had a certain mature charm. All members of the Fei family were blessed with good looks, and Fei Qing'yi, who cultivated the Cold Qi, possessed an added aura of cold sternness. Hearing his words, Fei Tongcai nodded repeatedly, reminding him, "The first thing... we must go to the main family..."

"I understand," Fei Qing'yi replied, his head bowed. "This matter can't be delayed. There are a hundred, a thousand eyes on the Lake. If not for the alliance our ancestors forged with the Lake, we wouldn't even have this single mountain peak to call our own. The venerable elder is a man who values old ties. Fetch some of the spiritual items from the mountain and come with me."

He continued in a low voice, "You are the only one left in our family who met Li Qinghong all those years ago. If you come with me to pay our respects to the Lake, you'll have an excuse to speak a few words with the venerable elder... That venerable elder... is truly our family's protective charm."

"Understood! Understood!" Fei Tongcai hurried to prepare the items. As he walked with his kinsman, he heard Fei Qing'yi's cold voice.

"In any case, since Fei Qingyi has clung to a powerful branch and submitted herself to the Si family, we can't count on her to help with family matters. We only have ourselves to rely on..."

After they had flown for a time and exited the great formation, they saw a man in black robes waiting quietly before it, his hands clasped. Upon seeing Fei Qing'yi, he lowered his head slightly and spoke in a calm voice.

"Fellow Daoist Fei, let us go to the island together!"

"Ah, it's Protector Chen," Fei Qing'yi said, forcing a smile. He nodded. "Yes, we were just on our way... just on our way..."

Chen Yang found him utterly displeasing. As the leader of a new generation of elders, including people like An Xuanxin, he had always regarded the Fei family as a thorn in his side. He could not tolerate this semi-autonomous clan in northern Jiangbei, yet he had never been able to find a pretext to act.

He had been sent to Funan to clean up the traces of past events and had handled the matter jointly with Li Jianglong. He was keenly aware of what had transpired in the north, especially concerning the True Monarch. With his cautious nature, he had wanted to turn over every single blade of grass in all of Funan at the time.

At such a critical juncture, Chen Yang had no goodwill whatsoever toward Fei Qing'yi. His hand tightened slightly on the hilt of his sword, but a smile bloomed on his face, and he chatted and laughed with them all the way.

Following behind Chen Yang, they flew into the Lake's midst. The hall they entered was utterly silent. Passing through the doorway, they saw the man in crimson robes who had been waiting for them. Li Jiangqian sat on the seat of honor, a smile on his face.

Fei Qing'yi was actually terrified of that smile; it sent a shiver down his spine. The Li clan had battled their way out of the remote and desolate lands of Eastern Yue to become the rulers of Moongaze Lake. This bloody history made everyone in the family, from top to bottom, seem utterly formidable. Even after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, Fei Qing'yi couldn't shake this feeling. He knelt on the floor of the hall, bowing respectfully.

Li Jiangqian offered a few words of congratulations, and Fei Qing'yi answered each one, steering the conversation back to how honest and loyal the Fei family was, and that they harbored no ulterior motives.

Li Jiangqian wasn't satisfied with his answers. He still had doubts about the younger man's breakthrough. He watched him for a while in silence before speaking.

"The Floating Cloud Territory in the north was once deeply entangled with the Fei clan. The Lake protected the north bank for ten years, allowing you to weather the storm. Now, that territory has been freed up for a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to work. The Fei clan should have withdrawn its hands from there. We've given this order before, but it seems it hasn't been carried out to our satisfaction."

The Fei clan should not have dared to act in Jiangbei, but the Fei family lacked the Li clan's efficiency and speed. Li Jiangqian guessed they still maintained numerous, unintentional ties. When Li Jiangqian asked about it, Fei Qing'yi didn't even know which aspect of his family's affairs was lacking. He simply answered, "This subordinate is incompetent. I will go back and take care of it properly..."

Li Jiangqian had no intention of letting him handle it blindly. The difference between the Fei family with and without a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was massive. He had specially sent Chen Yang to intercept Fei Qing'yi before he could head north. Now, he simply said, "That's not necessary. You will stay on the Lake for now. All news concerning the north will be sent to the island for us to handle. If you conceal even a single detail..."

Fei Qing'yi nodded frantically. Li Jiangqian's gaze, however, suddenly locked onto Fei Tongcai, who was sweating profusely beside him. He didn't have to say a word. The nearby Chen Yang immediately stepped forward, drew his sword, and placed it against the middle-aged man's neck, shouting, "Speak!"

Fei Tongcai glanced anxiously at his nephew, a sight that terrified Fei Qing'yi out of his wits. If not for the fact that cultivating the 'Snow on the Pine' physique prevented him from sweating, he too would have been drenched. He knelt down as well, giving Fei Tongcai a meaningful look before answering, "This subordinate... this subordinate has only just come out of seclusion... I don't know what news the family has received..."

Li Jiangqian watched the two men silently. Fei Tongcai began to kowtow, muttering timidly, "Reporting to the Venerable Sir... we received a secret letter a few days ago. A former clansman... is cultivating in Baihu County. They sent a secret letter back recently, hoping for assistance with resources and supplies..."

He called him a "former clansman," but Fei Qing'yi knew he was a descendant left behind by the older generation as a contingency plan. A feeling of dread took hold of him. Chen Yang, who held the sword, received a subtle cue from his lord. His face instantly turned grim and menacing. "We told your family to withdraw your hands long ago. To knowingly hide information and secretly contact others... you are truly rebellious!"

"This humble one didn't know about this before!" Fei Tongcai could only kneel on the ground, trembling. Li Jiangqian still wore a smile, but his heart was filled with dark clouds.

'Baihu County... so he is indeed in Baihu County. That means Protector Black Rat is in Baihu County. Wang Quwan and Wang He are also in Baihu County, and the core of the Wang clan of Jiangbei is in the area of Baihu County...'

But if the Fei family had someone in Baihu County, the matter was completely different. Li Jiangqian strode down, helped Fei Qing'yi up, and said with a hint of reproach, "Protector Chen is too harsh... this matter isn't clear yet, there's no need to rush."

Fei Qing'yi finally relaxed a little. Fei Tongcai stopped stuttering, and when Chen Yang asked, he spoke softly.

"That person is of my generation. He made a mistake years ago and was driven out by the family. He no longer keeps in contact with us. He once cultivated at Lake Xian, and later went to Baihu County to work as a tearoom owner."

"Recently... we heard that there was turmoil in the county. The great formation of the ore vein was destroyed, which angered Protector Black Rat. His business was affected, and he also reached a crucial period in his Qi Refining breakthrough... so he sought help from the Peak."

"Patriarch, please rest assured! Our family will no longer have any contact with this person!"

Li Jiangqian stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his fists clenched so tight that the veins on his knuckles bulged. A few wisps of Li Fire leaked from his palms, flickering erratically.

This matter seemed harmless—after all, the person had been exiled by the Fei family. If he happened to gain favor with the True Monarch, the Fei family would be in trouble, and if he offended the True Monarch, the Fei family would also be in trouble. But a little thought revealed that this "exile" was a pathetic ruse.

'What if this person was forced to be exiled due to my pressure, a part of a 'cunning rabbit with three burrows' plan? If he does gain favor with the True Monarch, it would mean my family will be a target for attracting hatred!'

He spoke with a gentle tone, "Why would you drive away a family member for no good reason? Speak the truth now."

His voice was faintly chilling. Chen Yang's face turned even darker, and he stood silently. Fei Tongcai finally couldn't hold on any longer. He kowtowed and confessed, "Reporting to the Venerable Sir... this was the doing of Fei Tongyu... back when he led our Fei family to swear allegiance to the Lake, he made a secret plan to send out four branches of our clan. He was even afraid of being discovered and didn't dare to contact them for all these years... He said... those who are outside only need to know they are of the Fei clan, and we don't need to know where they are. That way, if Cold Cloud Peak's Fei clan were to one day disappear, he would have a chance to rebuild the clan and continue the lineage!"

"This family... only recently made contact again..."

Li Jiangqian, a man of great cunning, understood immediately. Though Fei Tongyu had led his clansmen to pledge allegiance, he clearly held deep misgivings about the Li clan, fearing his family would be slowly worn away until the north bank was fully occupied. He had dispersed his bloodline as a contingency. As for why they hadn't dared to contact them all these years? It was to guard against the Li clan, of course!

That was the true meaning of the so-called "exile!" It was originally a backup plan, but now, due to the fate of Jiangbei, one branch had ended up in Baihu County. They might truly encounter the True Monarch!

He swept a grim look at Chen Yang, who also looked sullen. He was disgusted by Fei Tongcai. Chen Yang was no simple man; he had probably also guessed this layer of deception. Holding his sword, he said grimly, "The Lake has treated your family well all these years, haven't we?"

At these words, the two could only kneel and kowtow, unable to say another word. This was Fei Tongyu's doing, a mere retreat plan. Who could have foreseen that such a thing would happen in the future, or that it would cause trouble in this way?

'The Fei clansmen are all quite attractive. Perhaps one or two of the daughters will offer their beauty and be favored by the True Monarch. If he really lets this Fei Tongcai cut off contact, and the matter comes back to bite them, will it be the Fei family's fault? Naturally, it would be seen as my, Li Jiangqian's, persecution...'

Lost in thought, he returned to the seat of honor. He sat down and told Chen Yang to sheathe his sword. At the moment, he was wary of the True Monarch's methods, so he maintained a pleasant demeanor.

"This matter is simply a case of a predecessor being overly cautious. There is no need to dwell on it now. Qing'yi's breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm is a great blessing. There's no need for a clansman to be wandering about outside. Send someone to bring him back and have him complete his breakthrough within the Peak!"

This intention confused the two Fei clansmen. They didn't know if it was a good or bad thing, or why this order had been given. They could only kowtow and thank him. Chen Yang spoke in a low voice.

"And the person we should send..."

This was a critical matter. It would be best to send someone who knew the inside story. If it weren't so strange for Li Jiangqian to go himself, he would have considered making the trip. He, too, possessed a Talisman Seed.

He shook his head slightly, troubled by the thought. He sent the two men away to wait before answering, "Perhaps Protector Chen should go. There's no need for Fei Qing'yi to go. Take Fei Tongcai to gain his trust, and also find a few direct descendants of the Fei clan from the north bank who have been promoted because of their closeness to our family. Have them go together to welcome him. Using Fei Qing'yi's breakthrough as a reason to welcome him won't cause too much of a problem."

Chen Yang nodded respectfully. He did not take the opportunity to speak ill of the Fei family, but instead voiced his doubts. "This is bad news. I wonder if we will be in time... and as for the ore vein incident, there are almost certainly some tricks at play."

Li Jiangqian understood the trickery better than he did, which was why this Fei clansman had to be brought in. He shook his head and replied, "This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Jiangbei is so vast. The Capital immortals Dao and our family, our shadows here can't be erased. The True Monarch's script always needs actors. There's no way to avoid it, only to decide if the role is good or bad."

"If we can detect this in advance, it is a blessing in disguise. By bringing him in this way, we might not even run into the man himself. Things have only just begun to change. Everyone's cultivation shouldn't be too high yet. A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator at this time won't be an enemy, so nothing too terrible should happen... but if we don't bring him in, something terrible is bound to happen in the end."

Chen Yang nodded heavily, his head lowered, lost in thought. Li Jiangqian didn't really want him to go, but he didn't have many capable Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and each had their own shortcomings.

Cui Jueyin was skilled at internal affairs and acted with grace, but it would be difficult to get him to engage in deception or underhanded methods. Ding Weizeng was a fighting champion. Qu Bushi was clever, but old and cowardly, always trying to keep his head down. Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia had not yet broken through. He truly did not have a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator who was as steady and effective in both overt and covert actions as Chen Yang.

'It's best if I go with him in secret. I'll watch from the river. If anything truly happens, there will still be room to maneuver...'

As Chen Yang left the hall, Qu Bushi brought the Fei clansmen forward. They were all in high spirits after hearing the good news. Fei Tongcai had also collected himself and was waiting quietly outside the hall. Chen Yang put on a grave face, apologizing and sighing as if he had been overly impulsive just moments before, which made Fei Tongcai's forehead break out in a cold sweat, slightly easing the tension.

With a wide smile, Chen Yang took Fei Tongcai's arm and pulled him forward, offering a few words of congratulations. The Fei clansmen were soon full of laughter, and they flew north on the wind.

Upon reaching Jiangbei, the sun grew noticeably hotter, and the early spring chill was gone. Chen Yang chuckled. "The Capital immortals Dao is not on good terms with my family. All of you can wait on the riverbank while Fellow Daoist Tongcai and I go to retrieve him."

The purpose of the rest of the group was to prevent Fei Tongcai from having too much time alone with the other Fei clansman. Once he was retrieved, the clansman would simply be introduced to a group of Fei family members who had prospered under the Li family's rule. Chen Yang was too lazy to bring along this group of burdens, fearing they would stir up trouble.

When they reached Baihu County, the southernmost part of the Baiye Creek territory, the area was in utter chaos. The rule of the Hall of the Locust Soul was worse than no rule at all. Cultivators flew about the city as if it were an unowned realm.

Corpses littered the main road, a stench of death hanging in the air from the thick, yellow dust. There were no pedestrians, only a few people kneeling on the ground, groaning, whether from sickness or hunger.

Fei Tongcai frowned repeatedly at the sight. Chen Yang swept his spiritual sense across the area and said in a low voice, "It seems it's because the formation in Baihu County was destroyed... and the spiritual mineral dust from the ore vein has spread throughout the Baihu County area..."

Metal Malice and Metal Taint were lethal poisons to mortals. The former was often found in artifacts—the Li clan would even put away their artifacts when meeting mortals—while the latter was a cold and fierce toxin often found in ore veins. Back then, who knew how many people from the Rui clan had died mining Cuiyuan Copper Essence for the Xiao family due to this very toxin.

'This Protector Black Rat doesn't care about mortals... he'll just let them die...'

Fei Tongcai followed the instructions to the tearoom. The surroundings were indeed desolate. The courtyard was in disrepair, and the nearby streets were littered with corpses. It was impossible to find a place to stand.

Still, the tearoom was a place for cultivators and appeared clean and tidy. Standing far away, they saw a commotion. A group of people was kneeling on the ground, and a man in luxurious robes stood haughtily in the courtyard.

Amidst the kneeling cultivators, a slender figure stood. His handsome face was full of defiance as he listened to the man in luxurious robes shout.

"You dog! You dare to not kneel before me, the son of the esteemed County Governor!"

The handsome youth merely replied in a cold voice, "Why should I kneel to you? I, Lin Feng, only kneel to the heavens above and the earth below. Are you, a scoundrel who only relies on his father's prestige, worthy of making me kneel?"

He raised his head, and a certain imposing air emanated from his slender body. The scoundrel's face immediately contorted in anger. A retainer standing beside him stepped forward, his face grim, and said in a cold voice, "Kneel!"

Everyone was shocked. They saw that the retainer was a Qi Refining cultivator. A pair of delicate sisters nearby hurried to pull at the youth. "Brother Lin..."

But the youth stood unyielding. Soon, the crowd parted, and an old man came forward, whispering, "Please don't be angry... don't be angry. This old man is here to hand over the spiritual supplies to Protector Black Rat... please, for the Protector's sake..."

At his words, the retainer and the scoundrel hesitated, looking as if they were about to back down. But the youth took a step forward and shouted, "You, surnamed Wang! Do you dare to duel me?"

"Ridiculous!" The scoundrel named Wang's eyes turned cold. "You are just at the third layer of Embyronic Breathing! You dare to challenge my fifth layer? There is nothing I don't dare to do!"

"Good! Three months from now, you and I will fight a duel to the death right here! We shall not only determine who is superior but also who lives and who dies!"

Lin Feng's shout made the scoundrel named Wang laugh in anger. He gave the old man who had come to his aid a cold stare before flicking his sleeves and leaving, leaving behind a flurry of hushed discussions in the shop.

Chen Yang watched, frowning. He patted Fei Tongcai beside him, but Fei Tongcai just shook his head.

"This Baihu County is interesting. The stage is set so realistically... and the protagonist truly has a noble bearing. He is quite admirable."

Chen Yang gave him a quick look before slowly approaching. He nodded. "He is indeed an extraordinary person, one not easily seen on the Lake..."

Fei Tongcai had completely shed his previous caution and sorrow. He walked quickly into the tearoom, taking the old man's hand. "Hey! Second cousin, it's been a long time!"

The old man also recognized Fei Tongcai. He was full of shock. "Why have you come here... is the family...?"

"Qing'yi has broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm! We are here to bring you back to enjoy a life of ease!"

The two sighed with emotion. Fei Tongcai's face showed not a single trace of worry, completely immersed in the joy of seeing an old friend. Chen Yang, meanwhile, went to look at Lin Feng, his face now a picture of simple honesty. He patted the youth's shoulder and praised him.

"Good boy! I saw from afar just now. This is truly the demeanor of an Immortal Dao genius!"

"A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator!"

The courtyard erupted in a clamor. The group of cultivators knelt down in fear. While the son of the County Governor had only inspired fear of his authority, this person inspired fear from the bottom of their hearts. The two delicate sisters beside the youth also knelt, but the young man remained fearless, standing proudly. He bowed and said, "Greetings, Senior!"

Chen Yang nodded constantly, his expression full of admiration. He sighed. "In my life, I admire those who cannot be intimidated by power the most! And I despise those scoundrels and schemers with twisted minds! Good boy! For Jiangbei to produce such an unafraid person... it is indeed a blessed land!"

He pulled Lin Feng to a table and sat him down. "But in just three months, how can you defeat him?"

Lin Feng slowly shook his head, his eyes firm. "This junior has his own way!"

"Good!" Chen Yang praised him repeatedly. He reached into his sleeve and took out a talisman. "It's a pleasure to have met and spoken with you. If you ever face danger in the future, you can use this talisman to escape. Consider it a way to save a friend."

"Thank you, Senior!"

Chen Yang laughed heartily. "I am from Moongaze Lake. A cultivator from the Fei family has achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, and so has gained a higher status on the Lake. I am here to bring this elder back. He is about to have a breakthrough to Qi Refining... so he will cultivate on the Lake."

The two sisters by the youth's side gasped. Chen Yang smiled. "Seeing the two of you, you must also be from the Fei family. You are both truly beautiful... Do you have spiritual apertures? You can come and cultivate on the mountain as well."

The older sister hesitated, while the younger one looked disappointed. They spoke at the same time. "Brother Lin saved our lives. We only wish to cultivate by his side..."

But Lin Feng silently shook his head. "Qingya has a spiritual aperture and should naturally join the Moongaze Lake Sect to cultivate... as for Qingfei... she will have to suffer with me as we wander..."

The three of them became lost in their heartfelt conversation. Chen Yang watched with a smile, but drops of cold sweat rolled down his cheeks and into his collar. His lips trembled slightly, but he could not speak, only maintain the stiff smile on his face.

When Lin Feng's gaze finally turned to him, the subtle struggle on Chen Yang's face shattered instantly. A jovial smile appeared once more. He motioned to Fei Tongcai to come over, laughing.

"It's almost time to go. This is someone else's territory, after all, and our Daoist tradition is not on good terms with theirs, so we should not stay long..."

Fei Tongcai took the older of the two sisters by the hand, nodding repeatedly. His old cousin followed. Lin Feng sighed lightly, holding his sister as he saw them out of the hall. He spoke with deep affection.

"Qingya, don't worry... wait for me for three years! In three years, I will reach the Foundation Establishment Realm and personally go to Cold Cloud Peak to ask for your hand!"

The younger sister pouted with jealousy, while Fei Qingya's face flushed. His words were utterly absurd, yet no one present found it strange. Even Fei Tongcai nodded with a smile, his face full of gratification.

Chen Yang soared into the air with the group and flew south. Lin Feng silently put the talisman away. He raised his head and said in a cold voice, "The Wang Clan... covering the sky with a single hand, acting with impunity. Just you wait!"

Yellow sand swirled past him. He stood tall and proud as his cultivation rose. In just a few breaths, another Embyronic Breathing wheel had condensed within his body.

# Chapter 848: Entering the Fray

Riding the winds, Chen Yang led the lively group on their journey home. The black-robed man stroked his beard with a contented smile, while Fei Tongcai and his cousin, Fei Tonglu, laughed until their sides ached, reminiscing about days long past.

During their early years of cultivation, their ancestor, Fei Wangbai, had been struck down by a single sword strike from Si Yuanli in full view of the clan. The event had become an inner demon for nearly every member of the Fei family. Yet here the two were, recalling those times with faces full of blissful joy, not a shadow of gloom in sight.

After they crossed the river, a crowd of Fei family members came to welcome them. They called out greetings, puzzled by the group’s infectious cheerfulness but joining in the festive mood as they headed toward the lake.

They had just reached the northern shore when they saw a refined, scholarly-looking Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator waiting for them. It was Cui Jueyin, who was supposed to be guarding the river.

Cui Jueyin’s smile was frozen. He came face to face with Chen Yang and was about to speak when Chen Yang’s bright, cheerful voice boomed out.

"Greetings, Lord Cui! What a coincidence!"

The shout left Cui Jueyin stunned and suspicious. 'Who is this man?' he thought. 'The Chen Yang I know speaks in a deep, measured tone and rarely smiles. When has he ever laughed so heartily?' With his brows unfurrowed and his features relaxed, he looked almost like a different person.

"Protector Chen…" Cui Jueyin replied, his suspicion slowly fading. He adopted a gentle tone. "I am under orders from the Family Head to lead you and Daoist Friend Fei to the lake. The grand array on Cold Cloud Peak requires maintenance. The rest of you may find lodging at a nearby peak. I will not see you off."

Fei Tongcai nodded repeatedly and sent the others back with Fei Qingya. He and Chen Yang then joined Cui Jueyin, and the three of them flew toward the lake. When they arrived at the great hall, it was completely empty.

Cui Jueyin closed the heavy doors and smiled at Fei Tongcai.

"Daoist Friend, please rest for a moment. I will take Protector Chen to make his report."

Fei Tongcai nodded with a smile.

His attitude toward Cui Jueyin was bizarre. He was merely at the Qi Refining stage, yet when facing a peak Foundation Establishment Realm expert like Cui Jueyin, he neither bowed nor lowered his head. Not only did he lack the usual fear of a higher-level cultivator, but he also treated him with the casual familiarity of a colleague.

Chen Yang observed this without a hint of displeasure. As he walked out with Cui Jueyin, he began to chat amiably.

"Lord Cui, I met a true genius in Jiangbei… such indomitable pride, unbending in the face of power…"

Cui Jueyin, however, wore a conflicted expression and seemed reluctant to listen. He cut in, "About Fei Qingya…"

"We can discuss that in detail later!"

The two entered the main hall, which was also deserted except for Li Jiangqian, who sat in the center with a grim expression. He squinted, his gaze filled with apprehension as if he were facing two monstrous beasts.

As Chen Yang and Cui Jueyin came to a stop, Cui Jueyin dropped to his knees in a deep bow. Chen Yang offered a slight, casual nod of respect. Li Jiangqian set down the vermilion brush in his hand and lowered his head to read a scroll, saying nothing.

The atmosphere in the hall instantly froze. The cheerful smile on Chen Yang's face grew stiff. Cui Jueyin, kneeling firmly on the stone floor, felt a sheen of sweat form on his neck. Silence reigned.

As time ticked by, Cui Jueyin finally broke the quiet, his voice low.

"Reporting to the Family Head… I fear… Baiku Prefecture is indeed… where *that one* has taken residence."

Chen Yang remained standing ramrod straight, a look of utter confusion on his face. Seeing this, Cui Jueyin began to sweat profusely. He heard Li Jiangqian’s soft command.

"Wake Lord Chen up."

Cui Jueyin scrambled to his feet and began casting spells, unleashing one Dharma Art after another, but the Chen Yang before him remained unresponsive. Finally, Cui Jueyin rolled up his sleeves, and while Chen Yang was distracted, he delivered two heavy slaps across his face.

*Smack! Smack!*

He had put his full strength into the blows. Chen Yang’s cheeks flushed crimson as he staggered back two steps, a dazed look in his eyes. He collapsed to his knees with a thud, his lips trembling as if he wanted to speak, but no sound came out.

Li Jiangqian rose, still averting his gaze from Chen Yang. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw wisps of Purple Smoke drifting out and coiling on the floor. He immediately bowed low, his voice respectful.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

A woman in autumn-yellow robes stepped into the hall. Cui Jueyin reacted just as quickly, bowing reverently. Only Chen Yang remained standing stiffly in the center of the hall. He cupped his hands in a salute and asked, "May I ask which Daoist Master has graced us with her presence…?"

At this, even Li Jiangqian was at a loss for words. He remained kneeling and pleaded, "I beg the Daoist Master… to save him…"

Fortunately, Tinglan was magnanimous and chose to ignore the remark. She formed a sword finger with two fingers and lightly tapped the spot between Chen Yang's brows.

Chen Yang instantly stumbled back a step. His eyes flashed a brilliant yellow before erupting in a blinding light that burned them to cinders, leaving only two dark, empty sockets. He fell to the floor with a crash, the back of his robes visibly soaked with sweat.

He fumbled on the ground, kowtowing repeatedly while ignoring the bloody tears that dripped from his empty sockets. Tinglan casually plucked a sheet of paper from the desk, picked up the vermilion brush, and with a few deft strokes, drew a pair of eyes.

She tossed the paper toward Chen Yang's face. In an instant, two new eyeballs popped into the blackened sockets, and a blank sheet of paper fluttered to the floor.

Tinglan had not yet mastered the Life Divine Ability; destroying his eyes before recreating them was clearly a clever workaround. She allowed Chen Yang a moment to recover before speaking softly.

"Now that all the players are assembled on your side, the True Monarch will naturally appear. Not bad. Finding the Monarch so quickly saves a lot of trouble later…"

Her tone was light. She glanced at the still-bowing Chen Yang and chuckled. "You're quite capable yourself, to still have some sweat left to shed in the Monarch's presence."

Fear and apprehension were the only emotions left in Chen Yang's eyes. His hands, pressed against the floor for support, were pale and trembled slightly. Li Jiangqian spoke up respectfully, "Daoist Master, there is still a Qi Refining cultivator who personally saw the Monarch and returned. He is nearby… should we have him come in?"

Tinglan shook her head and took the main seat, a hint of shock in her expression. "There's no need to see him," she said gently. "He's beyond saving. His original consciousness has been completely annihilated. What's replaced it is whatever the Monarch imagines him to be. If the Monarch thinks he's cheerful, he's cheerful. If he thinks he's optimistic, he's optimistic. If one day the Monarch thinks he should go rescue him, he'll grab a sword and go. No one can save him."

"As for… you…" Tinglan looked at Chen Yang. "You are a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, after all, and I intervened in time. Just lie low until the Monarch leaves, and this matter will be over."

In that short time, Li Jiangqian had observed a great deal. Chen Yang had been acting strangely, yet Cui Jueyin had been completely oblivious until the end. The influence was clearly far more widespread than he had imagined. "Should we isolate him… have him stay alone?" he asked quietly.

Tinglan considered this for a moment. "That's up to you. As long as you don't mention the Monarch's affairs, he's harmless. But it's best to have as little contact as possible."

"As for that young lady…" Tinglan's gaze swept over them again. "Give her a quiet environment, and assign a few female cultivators from the Fei family to live with her. There's no need to pick the talented ones."

Li Jiangqian nodded quickly. "This junior understands."

Tinglan's voice took on a meaningful tone. "You must understand, the Monarch will leave sooner or later, but *they* might not be able to. Even as a mortal, they are a prize. Not even a corpse would be left of them. If she's a cultivator… her uses are even greater. The willful and arrogant ones are not useful, but the obedient, cute, aloof, and cold ones… they are excellent material…"

Li Jiangqian looked up slightly, sudden understanding dawning in his eyes. A flash of killing intent sparked within him before he quickly suppressed it. "Thank you for the guidance, Daoist Master!"

Tinglan continued in a leisurely manner, "Ning Wan is watching over Li Quantao and his son, as well as matters in Jiangbei. It was convenient for me to make this trip."

She looked at Li Jiangqian and smiled. "The Li clan is truly of the Wei-Li lineage, and Li Zhouwei is a true White Qilin. Excellent, indeed. A match for Tu Longjian!"

The remark seemed to come out of nowhere, but Li Jiangqian understood her meaning perfectly. She was complimenting him for remaining largely unaffected, for being able to command the situation calmly through these bizarre changes. It had deepened her and the other Daoist Masters' conviction in the Li family's bloodline.

'A son of the White Qilin… a Golden Core bloodline… Only that can grant one a slight escape from the Monarch's influence.'

With those words, she dissolved into Purple Smoke and vanished. Li Jiangqian respectfully bid her farewell, then calmly raised his head and sat in the main seat. Below, Chen Yang was drenched in sweat, clearly terrified by his own actions on the journey back.

Li Jiangqian paused for a moment, then smiled. "Protector Chen! Regarding the Daoist Master's decree… how should we select these women from the Fei family?"

Chen Yang replied respectfully, "The jealous, the restless, the troublemakers, and those from branches unrelated to ours… supplement them with one or two gentle, kind ones who are our kin."

"A group of female cultivators will always have drama," he continued. "We'll just send them resources. If the Monarch arrives here and becomes displeased, should he want some entertainment, this will give him a quick way to vent. No matter what, the Fei family is his maternal family, and his time is tight. He won't linger in Jiangnan."

Li Jiangqian smiled. "It seems Protector Chen has returned to us."

He picked up his brush, his mind racing. 'The Daoist Master's meaning is clear. I wonder which immortal sects will get ideas about Fei Qingya. Driving a wedge between her and the Fei family in advance is good for my clan and for the other sects. After all, it's an awkward situation.'

'Thinking back, the incident with Chu Yi last time was in Yufu Prefecture, right near the Purple Smoke Gate…'

Making the connection, Li Jiangqian looked up and asked, "The current rising star of the Purple Smoke Gate's Mu Zuo Peak, Qian Lizi… she must be around a hundred years old now, right? Protector Cui, do you know her name?"

Cui Jueyin thought for a moment. "I believe… her surname is Han? As for her given name… that's difficult to know. She has used her Daoist title since joining the sect, so it's hard to find out her original name."

"I understand." Li Jiangqian nodded, deep in thought. "Protector Chen will be fully in charge of the Fei Qingya matter. Replace everyone who has had contact with her with female attendants. Lock down the mountain peaks where she cultivates, and don't let anyone in…"

"Especially my family members."

A plan had already formed in Li Jiangqian's mind.

'Since Daoist Master Tinglan said the Monarch makes things what he thinks they are, Chen Yang has already become an amiable and approachable senior in his mind. Perhaps if he goes over early, that wastrel will make a move, letting Chen Yang step in to help and set up some three-month agreement…'

'And since an amiable senior is representing my Li clan, whatever happens at Cold Cloud Peak probably won't be blamed on us. Let them deal with the fallout themselves…'

He added another instruction to put Chen Yang's mind at ease. "You don't need to have contact with her normally. When the True Monarch arrives, find an excuse to go into seclusion. There's no need for you to meet him again."

"Yes!"

Chen Yang’s expression finally calmed. He received his orders and exited through a side door. Li Jiangqian considered for a moment more, then commanded:

"Have Fei Qing'yi come up."

Soon, a man entered from outside the hall. He had been stuck on the island since his breakthrough, unable to even leave the main hall. His face was etched with anxiety as he bowed before the throne. "Greetings, Family Head," he said cautiously.

Li Jiangqian’s face was a mask of profound disappointment. He descended from his seat, his tone laced with frustration. "Daoist Master Tinglan just left!"

The words terrified Fei Qing'yi, who immediately kowtowed, his body tense with nervousness. Li Jiangqian pressed on, "How many times have I told you! The matter in Jiangbei is of utmost importance to the Daoist Masters! Who knows how many Purple Mansion Realm experts are involved, and you nearly ruined their grand plans! If not for our clan's intervention, the entire Fei family would have become a stepping stone for others!"

Fei Qing'yi had never imagined the situation was so dire. He remained frozen in place as Li Jiangqian continued coldly, "Listen well. The current Fei Tongcai has been afflicted by a spell art. No one is to see him. I will send him to guard a ferry crossing near Jiangbei, a post within our territory. His resources will be several times what your branch receives, and the benefits will be far greater. When the time is up, we will bring him back."

Fei Qing'yi started to thank him, but Li Jiangqian waved his hand dismissively. "There is something more important… Although Fei Qingya is unaware, she is the reincarnation of a Daoist Master. She is no longer a member of your Fei family. The Daoist Masters have given specific instructions: her cultivation technique is special and cannot be tainted by worldly ties. She is forbidden from seeing anyone and will cultivate on your Cold Cloud Peak. I will seal off those mountain peaks and leave a few people to accompany her. If anyone from your family disturbs her, it will be a crime punishable by the extermination of your entire clan."

Fei Qing'yi could never have predicted such a turn of events. A chill washed over him. 'Without a Purple Mansion Realm expert, we have no right to know anything… we're just cannon fodder.'

Li Jiangqian continued, "I am telling you this secret so you can control your family members. If it leaks and attracts enemies, not only will your Fei family be wiped out for harboring her, but my clan will also suffer greatly."

His tone softened slightly. "Daoist Friend Fei, these matters are top secret, known only to myself, Lord Cui, and a few others. I am telling you this out of the deep friendship between our families, so you understand the gravity of the situation. It is extremely serious. Because a direct descendant of your family appeared and disrupted their plans—and they couldn't just kill him out of respect for my clan—the Purple Mansion Realm experts are very displeased."

"This subordinate understands!" Fei Qing'yi's hand, extending from his sleeve, was trembling.

Li Jiangqian sighed. "This being reincarnated into Fei Qingya… in her past life, she cultivated the Way of Heartlessness. That's why she cultivates Cold Qi. If you behave, nothing will happen. But if you get too involved, too close, and something goes wrong when she is proving her Dao… and she needs to kill to sever her emotional ties, that is no laughing matter."

He had thoroughly intimidated Fei Qing'yi, who now began to thank him with fawning gratitude. Beside them, Cui Jueyin didn't dare lift his head. Only then did Li Jiangqian say, "Lord Cui, go with him. Handle this matter properly. Do not meet her personally; let the people we arranged earlier handle everything."

The two men quickly retreated. Li Jiangqian returned to his seat and let out a long, frustrated sigh.

He could never tell Fei Qing'yi the truth. One could never underestimate human greed. If Fei Qing'yi learned that his own relative had become a True Monarch's consort, it would undoubtedly trigger a terrifying disturbance. No matter how much he warned him to stay away, the man would assume it was a bluff and try to get closer.

However, the excuse for bringing Fei Qingya back had been Fei Qing'yi's breakthrough; he couldn't just lock him up and be done with it. He would remain a huge liability. For now, this elaborate deception was the only way to make everything fit with the series of commands that had been issued.

'I'll just have to play it by ear…'

He picked up his brush and wrote several more orders, frowning. "I also need to see the Old Master. I'll have him confine Uncle Zhouming. He'll have to suffer for a bit…"
