# Chapter 616: Rising Yang Meets The Rainbow

"Elder Brother's artifact has some peculiarities." Li Qinghong handed over the jade bottle, presenting it briefly before removing her own mana and spiritual sense. She then passed it to Li Xuanfeng, allowing him to infuse it with his own essence.

The surface of the bottle shimmered with golden brilliance, releasing a bright golden mist that danced and leaped across Li Xuanfeng's fingertips. He lowered his gaze to inspect it for a moment before replying, "An artifact from the ancient Wei State. It might have belonged to the Bright Yang. Bring it back to the family and let the juniors test it‚Äîperhaps it may reveal different effects."

The two ascended into the skies, riding the wind. As they flew over rivers and shifting landscapes below, Li Xuanfeng's thoughts drifted to the lake. Suddenly, he turned back and asked, "I have heard that my elder brother's inner demons have plagued him, leaving his Dao Heart unstable. Is this true?"

Li Qinghong nodded slightly, seemingly anticipating his line of thought. Sure enough, Li Xuanfeng calculated something with his fingers before asking again, "Did my elder brother later have any other children?"

"He did not," Li Qinghong replied softly. "There have been no more descendants. Those mortal kin of ours... they all passed away some years ago."

Li Xuanfeng spoke hoarsely, "Elder Brother... the loss of his last child in the grotto heaven must be leaving him in unbearable agony."

The two flew in silence, the atmosphere heavy with grief. The sky alternated between light and shadow as time passed. Eventually, they reached the lakeside. Torrential rain poured down, drenching the landscape. Mount Qingdu stood solemnly amidst the storm. As Li Xuanfeng had never returned after leaving, his imprint was absent from the mountain's formations. Thus, Li Qinghong activated the formation, allowing them to land on the peak together.

Once within the mountain's protective barrier, Li Qinghong respectfully handed the Immortal Mirror back to Li Xuanfeng. He accepted it with both hands, and the two proceeded forward together.

By the stone steps on the mountainside stood a young girl. She was dressed in a white gown, her phoenix-shaped almond eyes radiating a quiet beauty. Li Qinghong spoke gently, "This is elder brother's surviving child."

Li Xuanfeng nodded silently, watching as Li Qinghong took the girl's hand. He stepped forward on the somewhat unfamiliar stone steps, his voice soft as he said, "I will head to the ancestral shrine first, go and gather everyone."

Li Qinghong understood Li Xuanfeng's intention to return the Immortal Mirror and report his accomplishments. Leading Li Yuexiang away, she left him to ascend the path alone. Step by step, Li Xuanfeng approached the ancestral shrine, closing the heavy doors behind him and isolating himself from the outside world.

Inside, he bowed solemnly before a row of ancestral tablets, confirming with the Immortal Mirror that no Purple Mansion Realm experts were nearby. Only then did he open the door to the stone chamber and place the pale grayish-blue Immortal Mirror atop the mystical spirit altar. From his belongings, he retrieved the jade buckle.

In an instant, the pale grayish-blue Immortal Mirror lit up, trembling violently and emitting waves of dazzling white light.

A mist of moon-white hue surged forth, casting a luminous glow across the ground. In this light, clusters of complexly patterned osmanthus flowers bloomed, their golden-white blossoms drooping delicately with golden stamens, exuding a fragrant aroma. From the dim corners of the room, a few sprightly rabbits and toads leaped out, their movements lively and animated.

The scent of osmanthus flowers wafted through the air. Li Xuanfeng raised the jade buckle high in both hands, which began to emit a soft light.

He had already inspected the jade buckle earlier. Sweeping his spiritual sense over it revealed that it was made of ordinary jade. After Yu Muxian's death, it had shown no reactions‚Äîneither signs of acknowledging a new master nor changes in brightness.

But now, the jade buckle finally reacted. A stream of pure white light cascaded downward, entering the Immortal Mirror and vanishing within. The pale grayish-blue mirror surface glowed intensely, transforming into a brilliant, radiant white.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Within the Mirror World.

Lu Jiangxian sat cross-legged, slowly absorbing the feedback from the talisman seed. Li Yuanjiao's cultivation, while not exceptionally deep, had been the first mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm talisman seed, far superior to the previous ones.

Lu Jiangxian had always been satisfied with and confident in Li Yuanjiao. The way he exchanged his life for Yu Muxian's death and the jade buckle revealed subtle layers of calculated deliberation. Not only did Lu Jiangxian comprehend it, but even those present, such as Li Xuanfeng and Xiao Yongling, could sense its meaning.

"Jiao dares not forget... Not many could have done better than you in fulfilling the promise to Li Tongya..."

Lu Jiangxian remained silent for a moment as scenes from the grotto heaven replayed in his mind like an unfolding animation. He watched as Li Yuanjiao reached the Three Drums Wall, entered the phantasm, and selected a technique to memorize.

The image froze on the final moment at the stone wall, where golden script floated across its surface. Lu Jiangxian's expression changed as his gaze fixated on the golden characters, True Insight Profound Method.

The four words seemed to carry a magnetic force, evoking countless thoughts in his mind. What truly shocked him was not the golden text of the scripture's principles but the very existence of these four characters.

Lu Jiangxian had not seen this particular script for more than ninety years.

"Seal Script..." The words were unmistakably written in the ancient style of his past life, the Small Seal Script.

The golden characters leaped from his memory, emerging from his pupils and hovering in the Mirror World's space. Lu Jiangxian remained seated at the center, his gaze growing brighter as the characters circled around him.
ùìØùìªùìÆùôöùô¨ùìÆùôóùíèùô§ùíóùôöùô°.ùíÑùíêùì∂

He remembered.

It was not a matter of learning or reading anew but of memories surging forth from deep within. Perhaps he had studied this scripture hundreds or even thousands of times before. Now, with sudden clarity, he recalled it all.

The True Insight Profound Method was originally named The Liangzhi Path of Radiant Truth and Supreme Enlightenment Sutra. It was an ancient method for cultivators to refine their nature, extend their lifespan, and ascend to immortality. In Lu Jiangxian's memories, he had already perfected it to its ultimate form.

Lu Jiangxian slowly opened his eyes, and his entire demeanor had completely transformed. He gently raised his hand, palm facing upward, and the Bright Yang Metallic Essence, resembling a radiant cone of light, emerged in his grasp.

Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence!

"Ah... So this is the nature of the Metallic Essence! Life and essence are intertwined, and the Metallic Essence and thread of fate are fundamentally one!" Countless revelations surged within his heart, yet he found himself unable to articulate them. Overwhelmed with joy, tears fell from his eyes as he muttered, "No wonder a Golden Core rebirth ties itself to a thread of fate... The Metallic Essence, when activated, naturally forges one's fate!"

The Metallic Essence in his hand had undergone a fundamental change compared to before. No longer inert, it now swirled warmly in his palm. Interlocking his index and middle fingers, he gently tapped the essence with his thumb, causing it to emit an even brighter radiance.

In an instant, Lu Jiangxian's robes transformed into garments of dazzling golden splendor, surrounded by rings of colorful light. Streams of spiritual qi and flames cascaded like rain, dancing around him.

Golden embers resembling the Supreme Yang Splendor Flame, the explosive brilliance of the Six Yang Radiance, and the luminous patterns of the Golden Yang Radiant Origin emerged around him, merging, fading, and evolving.

Though he had yet to claim the jade buckle, Lu Jiangxian's heart brimmed with indescribable joy. He whispered, "The greatest treasure of this journey is, without doubt, the True Insight Profound Method!"

Lu Jiangxian felt certain that with these immortal techniques, even if he unleashed the Bright Yang Essence into the world, no one could take it from him‚Äîunless the rightful owner of this Bright Yang Fruition descended in person.

To compare his former self, Lu Jiangxian mused, he had once been like a child holding a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact without the ability to wield it‚Äîperhaps only capable of using it to crack walnuts.

But now, he was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator well-versed in various spells. Not only could he harness the metallic essence's myriad wonders, but through its guidance, he could gain insight into countless truths of the world!

"What a pity... If I had a physical body, with just this Metallic Essence and the immortal techniques, I could reach Foundation Establishment Realm within three months and Purple Mansion Realm in six years..." Joy flickered in his brightened eyes as he muttered, "I wonder if there are other similar relics in this world. With just one glance, the rewards would be immeasurable!"

Suppressing his excitement, he silently reminded himself, "Caution... I must remain cautious. Though this Metallic Essence could make me a master strategist in this realm, I am still within the territory of the Golden Core Realm experts. I must tread carefully and proceed slowly."

As he pondered his plans, the murky glow in the sky gradually dispersed, casting down a ray of white light. Lu Jiangxian felt the gradual restoration of the mirror artifact's power. Though his anticipation for the jade buckle had diminished, his heart still stirred with some delight.

"Not only do I have three more talisman seeds, but the Supreme Yin Profound Light has also reached the power of the Purple Mansion Realm!" Lu Jiangxian's eyes gleamed faintly as he gauged the feedback from the world. Though he couldn't fully grasp the level of power associated with the Purple Mansion Realm, based on his past experiences, it likely meant that a direct strike could instantly kill a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

"The Supreme Yin Profound Light must not be used carelessly..." His gaze lingered on the Bright Yang Metallic Essence before him. With a slight thought, the essence shifted, transforming into a beam of light and manifesting a human face.

This face appeared resolute and commanding, with a high nose bridge and deep-set eyes radiating a dignified masculine charm. However, it was not brutish or aggressive, but rather an inspiring and enthralling presence.

His brows were broad and smooth, and his golden pupils glowed faintly under the shadow of his nose, exuding an air of dominance and cunning.

"Great Ancestor of Wei, Li Qianyuan..." The Bright Yang Essence, passed down through countless years, instinctively displayed the visage of its original owner first. Gradually, the face morphed into that of a pale, slender youth, then shifted rapidly through a series of faces‚Äîeach belonging to ancient cultivators who had once interacted with the Metallic Essence.

Finally, the sequence slowed and settled on the youthful face of an inexperienced young man.

"Chu Yi." Lu Jiangxian studied the face intently, his gaze lingering on the brows and the bridge of the nose. "It truly is Chu Yi!"

But then, to his astonishment, the features began to overlap with the earlier face he had seen. He froze in place, his expression shifting to one of disbelief. Moments later, he exclaimed, "Li Qianyuan! Chu Yi is the reincarnation of Li Qianyuan! How can this be? This is impossible! How could Mount Luoxia..."

His words trailed off abruptly. With a change in his hand seals, the Metallic Essence began to shift once more. Lu Jiangxian carefully examined its patterns, discovering that over the past millennium, Li Qianyuan had reincarnated a staggering nineteen times.

The metallic essence in his hand slowly reverted to its original conical form, floating quietly in Lu Jiangxian's palm. He sat back down on the stone bench, his expression dark as he muttered, "Mount Luoxia... how ruthless Mount Luoxia is!"

Lu Jiangxian had long determined that the Bright Yang Fruition had an owner, but he had not realized that this person was still Li Qianyuan.

In hindsight, Li Qianyuan, as perhaps the first emperor to achieve mastery over the Bright Yang Essence, had single-handedly built the unprecedented centralized feudal state of the Great Wei. His actions, from Lu Jiangxian's current level of insight, ensured that as long as he lived, no one else could hope to touch the Bright Yang Fruition.

However, the True Monarchs of Mount Luoxia, desiring the Bright Yang for themselves, had to contend with the fact that a Golden Core Realm cultivator was nearly immortal in this world, capable of constant reincarnation. The only way to seize the Fruition Attainment was to repeatedly bring about Li Qianyuan's reincarnation and death. Each cycle of destruction and resurgence chipped away at his fate and divine abilities, inching the True Monarchs closer to their goal.

And yet, something had gone wrong with Li Qianyuan. He seemed to have lost his memories. With each reincarnation, he failed to recall his past lives, repeatedly falling into Mount Luoxia's grasp.

"Everyone thought Chu Yi bore a thread of fate, unrivaled in this world. They envied his ability to play among mortals, to return north to Mount Luoxia, and assumed he was merely a True Monarch toying with the world." Lu Jiangxian closed his eyes slightly and murmured, "Who would have thought... who could have imagined... that behind it all was a scheme using the states of Wu, Yue, and Zhao as pawns on a chessboard, corrupting the Bright Yang Fruition time and time again? I fear that with every cycle, multiple True Monarchs are watching from the Great Void."

"No wonder... Chu Yi, with fate upon him, was so unstoppable. Even when Bright Yang descended, the threads of fate scattered across a few lucky individuals, each one immensely formidable! This was precisely to exhaust his fate and divine abilities to the fullest!" Lu Jiangxian concluded, "What a ruthless Mount Luoxia!"

Lu Jiangxian exhaled lightly and quickly connected the dots to the collapse of the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven.

"When control over the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment reached a certain level, they first caused the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven of the Cui Family to fall. This led to the emergence of numerous Bright Yang Dao Lineage across the land and overseas... Why deliberately allow these inheritances to flow out?" He lowered his gaze to the small strand of Metallic Essence suspended in his hand.

Although Lu Jiangxian had gained some profound insights into the nature of Metallic Essence and fate through immortal techniques, his understanding of Fruition Attainments remained limited. He could only speculate, "On the surface, it looks like compensation for various sects... but considering their usual practice of strictly sealing techniques and my earlier deductions, this cannot be so simple! This suggests... Mount Luoxia hopes to see Bright Yang cultivators arise both on the mainland and beyond the seas, likely as part of their larger plan..."

The next moment, Lu Jiangxian suddenly recalled the sight of the five True Monarchs gathered around Green Pine Temple. His chest tightened, and he exhaled softly, suppressing his growing unease. He comforted himself, "I have already chosen Bright Yang and now possess the Bright Yang Metallic Essence... I have come this far."

With a gentle wave of his hand, he retrieved an object from the table before him.

This was the result of years of effort, a Grade Five Purple Mansion Realm technique written using the Metallic Essence and references from numerous other techniques. Having reviewed it with his newfound immortal techniques, Lu Jiangxian was reassured of its perfection. Finally, he allowed himself a sigh of relief.

The item was a golden jade slip with intricate patterns, engraved with small characters that read, Radiant Essence Scripture.

After putting everything in order, a bold idea arose in Lu Jiangxian's mind. His gaze swept downward, and his divine sense extended outward, scanning the entirety of Moongaze Lake.

His attention lingered briefly on the core members of the Li Family, but he failed to find what he was seeking. His divine sense swept further until it reached the small town, where it rested on a young man standing in a courtyard, looking gently at the people around him.

This youth had broad eyebrows and an imposing yet composed demeanor. Dressed in a fine robe, his smile radiated warmth. This was none other than Li Chengliao.

Li Chengliao had navigated the situation with Xu Xiao deftly, earning the favor of many elders. Recently, he had been riding a wave of success, having taken a new wife and broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. It was the prime of his life.

However, Lu Jiangxian's divine sense did not linger on Li Chengliao but instead shifted to the figure beside him.

Seated next to him was a gentle woman with a sweet smile. Though her beauty could not rival that of Liu Lingzhen, her actions exuded natural elegance, and her eyes shone brightly. She was lightly cradling her stomach. With a slight movement of his divine sense, Lu Jiangxian detected the presence of a fetus within her womb.

He softly formed a hand seal, and the Metallic Essence flowed with his will, surreptitiously linking to the void beyond. Lu Jiangxian murmured in a low voice, "Since Bright Yang descends and the threads of fate scatter, bringing forth fated ones, why should it not be my Li Family's turn?"
