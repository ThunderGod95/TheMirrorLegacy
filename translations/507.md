# Chapter 763: Sword Cry

Yu Mujian’s eyes widened as he thrust both palms forward, releasing two bursts of golden light. But Li Xijun’s swordplay was masterful; it was no longer the rigid, orthodox Celestial Moon Slash. His longsword subtly adjusted its angle mid-swing, and the gathered sword light slipped right through the gap between Yu Mujian’s hands.

The arc of Li Xijun’s sword came alive, evading defenses on the fly. Though its power hadn't drastically increased, the threat was now far greater. Caught off guard, the white sword light pierced through Yu Mujian’s chin, broke through the roof of his mouth, and nearly split his head open.

Still, Yu Mujian reacted swiftly. His copper sword lashed out, forcing Li Xijun back. Off to the side, Li Ximing was startled and quickly redirected the Radiant Origin Pass to suppress him again.

Though Li Ximing did not study the sword path, he was awestruck by his younger brother’s strike and admired him, Xijun’s swordsmanship has already surpassed Second Uncle’s from back then. Now that Brother Xizhi can no longer focus on the sword, no one in the family aside from the two ancestral lines can compare.

Yu Mujian was prepared this time. He formed a seal and narrowly avoided the Radiant Origin Pass’s suppression, retreating quickly.

His eyes gleamed as he spoke softly, “I truly underestimated you...”

The sword light still shimmered along his chin and only showed signs of healing after some time. He gathered dharma light in his hands again, for that vexing Radiant Origin Pass had come crashing down once more. Yu Mujian had no choice but to defend, growing increasingly irritated.

Suppressed by the Radiant Pass, Yu Mujian had lost the initiative and suffered repeated attacks from the two. Knowing this wouldn’t do, he finally dodged the massive gate and immediately cast a spell, flicking out three drops of golden tear-like essence.

The three golden drops rolled and drifted through the air before transforming into three figures, each wielding a copper sword. They darted off in a different direction.

Having fought countless battles across the north, he knew well that suppression spells and dharma artifacts were weakest against concealment and doppelgangers. Maneuvering between them could waste endless time. So, he hid his real body among the illusions, silently adjusting his breath and preparing to strike.

Just as the spell was cast, Li Xijun sheathed his sword. His eyes lit up with a snow-bright gleam. The effects of Radiant Snow Pine Ridge combined with Spirit Eye Perception allowed him to see through the illusion in an instant.

His spiritual sense stirred, and he transmitted a thought, Upper left.

Li Ximing understood instantly and activated the Radiant Origin Pass, slamming it straight down on the target. Yu Mujian was forced to summon his golden shield once again as the gate bore down on him. When his eyes met Li Xijun’s bright, piercing gaze, his chest tightened involuntarily.

This Li Xijun’s eye technique is no simple art!

Yu Mujian had only managed to unleash one strike before being pinned down by the Radiant Origin Pass again. The radiant light gleamed brilliantly, and its grinding suppression was overwhelming. If he had a pinpoint technique, it might help, but his copper sword was built for brute force.

He thought bitterly, This Bright Yang generation... he must have formed an Immortal Foundation based on some divine spell. Its grade is by no means low. If it were any ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, they would’ve long been ground to dust...

Meanwhile, Li Ximing had begun to grasp the rhythm of Yu Mujian’s movements and spellcasting intervals. Becoming more proficient by the moment, Li Xijun continued to cast his Kui Light technique, drawing his sword to unleash streaks of light that constantly interrupted Yu Mujian’s attempts to escape.

Though the two brothers rarely fought together, Li Xijun had a flawless sense of timing. He always exploited the openings Li Ximing left perfectly, leaving Yu Mujian fuming.

White mist was surging from his body and his face flushed red. Yu Mujian hovered in the air for two seconds before the Radiant Origin Pass pressed down again. The bright white gate sparkled brilliantly and finally pinned him in place.

Yu Mujian’s expression darkened further as dazzling light poured down around him. Li Ximing now sat firmly atop the gate, cross-legged, eyes shut tight and hands sealed in a mudra as he focused wholly on suppression.

Beside him, Li Xijun stood in white robes, sword slung across his back. He had two fingers pressed together as he formed seals and cast spells. Mount Qingdu’s spiritual energy shifted violently. Ten streaks of icy light shot upward, creating a deep blue barrier that cascaded from the sky.

“Morning Mist.”

Li Xijun gently formed another seal. A thick gray mist rose over the lake, rapidly spreading and cutting off spiritual sense. Tendrils started to drift toward Yu Mujian.

Li Xijun had invited him to fight at the lake with a plan in mind. Liu Changdie’s Heaven-Guarding Formation of Five Waters had been prepared long ago but had never been activated. He had saved for this moment to destroy Yu Mujian in one blow. His hands cycled rapidly through seals: Serpent Stream, Pure Essence, Grounded.

His killing intent surged. Countless serpentine water beasts, condensed from mana, leaped from the lake, their gray-green light flickering. The ground beneath Yu Mujian’s feet seemed to sink, and the Radiant Origin Pass pressed down harder, making escape feel impossible.

Yu Mujian’s expression grew increasingly grim. He now realized he had completely underestimated them, I thought Li Ximing was just an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. I underestimated this suppression technique. And now, I’ve fallen for Li Xijun’s scheme and walked straight into a formation... If I don’t bring out my real power, I’m in real trouble.

He sat cross-legged in midair. He formed a lotus seal before his chest as golden runes barely held around him. Golden patterns rose along his face. His eyes sparkled, releasing twin beams of dazzling golden light as he solemnly chanted, “Suxikong bestowed the true form through empowerment, illuminating Vajra and Womb Realms... Xu Mu has attained it, and today, beseeches to embody it. I command!”

He chanted rapidly, but each word was solemn and forceful. The spell he uttered transformed his eyes into a brilliant gold. He extended both arms forward as his back arched and flesh pulled away, revealing two more golden arms.

“By command, I attain the true form of Suxikong!”

The upper half of his robes exploded open, revealing a muscular torso. Golden light shone from each side of his chest. Two more eyes opened coldly and stared ahead. The long strip of cloth that had once unfurled golden runes now wrapped itself around his waist, slowly turning to gold itself.

Yu Mujian’s four eyes all focused forward. His rear two arms shot upward, veins of gold flaring as they pushed the Radiant Origin Pass away. His other two arms gripped his sword and pointed it directly at Li Xijun.

Li Xijun’s expression gradually turned grave. He slowly drew his sword back and braced himself.

Xu Mu is, after all, a Master Monk seated beside the Five-Eyed Merciful One. He’s bound to have hidden cards. Buddhist cultivators often rely on borrowed power from each other... Judging by this appearance, he’s drawing on external force.

Yu Mujian had fully manifested the True Form of Suxikong. His hair and beard had vanished, and he now resembled a golden-bodied Arhat. His eyes gleamed like molten gold as golden lacquer covering his eyelids and face.

He thundered, voice like crackling thunder, “Hah!”

The cry echoed like dragons roaring and tigers howling, stirring mountains and seas. Both Li Ximing and Li Xijun staggered. Yu Mujian forcefully pushed with both hands, blasting white mist from his mouth as he shoved the Radiant Origin Pass away. White mist and golden light entwined, his gaze sharp and blazing.

He said, “Draw your sword!”

He had placed his copper sword at his waist. All four hands now gripped the hilt and drew it inch by inch, releasing a narrow stream of golden light. A fierce sword aura erupted, intertwining with the runes on his body and stirring the lake into waves.

So all this time, despite the intense battle, his copper sword had never truly left its sheath! It had been so seamlessly forged with the scabbard that no one had noticed.

No wonder every swing carried immense weight but lacked sharpness. It was a concealed blade all along! thought Li Xijun.

Yu Mujian’s expression was ice-cold, the golden light on his body blazing like fire as it flowed into his sword. He paid no heed to the Radiant Origin Pass descending again and said deeply, “I have entered buddhism and severed ties with the Yu Family. This sword is for severing worldly attachments, to return a favor once shown by a senior.

“A sword that was concealed for years... today, it shall move.”

His eyes grew even brighter as he slowly drew the sword. Li Xijun stood still in midair, tightly gripping his own hilt. The final formation of the Heaven-Guarding Formation of Five Waters, the Layered Flow, emerged. Deep blue water surged and gradually surrounded him.

Provoked by Yu Mujian’s sword aura, Han Lin, Li Xijun’s sword, was already eager for battle. It let out a sharp screech as it vibrated in his hand. Li Xijun stared quietly down at his foe. He swallowed a pill, and said nothing.

The grand formations atop Mount Qingdu and nearby peaks flared to life, some bright, some dim, but their lights weaved together to release waves of energy. Li Ximing felt as if blades were cutting across his face, but with Yu Mujian’s sword aimed straight at his brother, how could he back down? He steeled himself, reversed his mana, and caused the Radiant Origin Pass to erupt in brilliance as it descended with increasing force.

Clang!

Golden light exploded skyward, dispersing clouds and mist. The Radiant Origin Pass rang with a sharp sound as the radiance at its center pulsed once, then dimmed. A tidal eruption of golden sword qi burst forth from within the gate, like mountains collapsing and seas roaring.

Boom!

The sword qi howled through the center, causing the plaque atop the gate to tremble violently. Cracks spread across the stone bricks, and the entire gate dimmed, shrinking into a single stream of light that shot back toward Li Ximing.

Pfft!

The Radiant Origin Pass had been harmed. Li Ximing coughed up a mouthful of blood, mingled gold and red. But before the blood even hit the lake, it transformed into golden streaks of light and scattered. He had no time to worry about his injuries; he immediately pulled out talismans and sent them flying to chase after the escaping light.

Li Xijun poured all his cultivation into his sword. The lake beneath his feet had frozen into solid ice. His pupils reflected only the golden sword aura; this was the culmination of the golden Arhat Suxikong’s lifetime of sword cultivation.

He felt the talisman seeds in his qi sea stir and erupt with pure qi. His mind grew sharper than ever before. Countless profound meanings surfaced in his heart, and his consciousness seemed to fall into a mirror, where he beheld a green sword resting on stone.

A man in a bright white robe stood alone atop an ancient, weathered city. His features were radiant and transcendent. A sky-darkening fire phoenix streaked through the heavens like a comet. The man calmly drew his sword, and a wave of cyan-white iridescence burst forth.

That cyan-white sword image gradually appeared in Li Xijun’s eyes. He sheathed his sword with his pale and glowing hand. He summoned another.

Clang!

A sharp screech rang out as a cyan-white sword burst forth from the mountains and soared through the air to land in his hand. The sword tassel swayed in the wind.

It was the Qingche Sword!

The moon-white sword light lit up once more and the gleam across the lake suddenly dimmed.

Golden light erupted from several miles away, accompanied by the rumble of collapsing stone. Yu Mujian stood in midair, staring blankly.

Li Xijun stood silently opposite him. Yu Mujian slowly lowered his sword. After standing for two seconds, his expression shifted and he abruptly said, “I have no regrets.”

Countless cracks spread across his face as the words left his mouth. His body held together for a single moment before shattering into countless fragments that scattered across the sky. The fragments turned to streams of light that turned into ash that drifted down like settling mist.

The dim yellow Copper Cache lost its radiance. It dropped, split into two pieces, and after half a spin, sank swiftly into the lake below.

Li Ximing sensed Li Xijun’s flickering and unstable qi. Without time to hesitate, he rushed to his side, only to see wind and snow churning as blood trailed from Li Xijun’s lips.

He quickly supported Li Xijun into the mountains. It was only when he fed Li Xijun a Wanglin Blossom that his complexion began to shift for the better. A faint red line ran across his waist; he had clearly been pierced by sword qi.

Blood still rising in his throat, Li Xijun rasped, “Earth-View Bloodstone!”

Li Ximing hastily took out the blood-glowing jade stone from his storage pouch and handed it to Li Xijun. Li Xijun used his palm like a blade and sliced off a small portion. He then tore his own abdomen open. His internal organs were broken and mangled.

He placed the bloodstone inside, pressed his palms together, and spat out a mouthful of black blood which pierced the jade with dozens of tiny holes.

After panting for a few moments, life gradually returned to Li Xijun’s face. He asked, “Is Yu Mujian dead?”

Li Ximing took half a second before realizing he needed to respond, "At the very least, that physical body should be dead..."

His face was drenched in sweat as he hastily asked, “How are you?”

“I should be fine with the Earth-View Bloodstone.” Li Xijun’s face was pale as paper. He leaned against a green boulder, using his mana to bind his fragmented organs together.

Yet his eyes were shockingly bright, and he smiled. “Ximing, there should still be a sword immortal’s remnant or inheritance hidden within the Qingche Sword!”

“Inheritance, whatever... Just stop talking first...” Li Ximing had no mind to listen to any more. He rummaged through his storage pouch and piled out several pills, muttering, “Every time I emerge from closed-door cultivation, something has already gone wrong at home... I've been feeling uneasy for days. Focus on your recovery...”

Li Xijun nodded, took a few pills, and sat down cross-legged, closing his eyes to heal.

After more than ten seconds, Li Xuanxuan came rushing over, calling out, “Ximing! Xijun! Are you both alright?”

“Still holding on...” Li Ximing quickly replied, then gradually regained his calm. He followed Li Xuanxuan out to reassure him, and noticed the elder holding two broken halves of the copper sword.

Copper Cache was still dripping wet from the lake. The fracture was smooth as a mirror.

————

Xu State, great void.

Golden clouds swirled auspiciously within the pitch-black great void, white mist curling around them. A massive golden figure sat upright at its center. The figure had three heads, six arms, and countless faces. The golden lacquer adorning it shimmered as it was surrounded by murmuring Sanskrit chants.

Many Merciful Ones stood beneath the golden lotus-like clouds, only a tenth the size of the golden figure. Their expressions varied, with some glaring in fury while others were as cold as frost. However, they were all holding blades, spears, axes, or halberds.

All the Merciful Ones stood frozen, their lotus-formed hands motionless in the golden mist. Their sacred weapons shimmered coldly, drawing the eye irresistibly toward them.

“Hm?”

Suddenly, a Merciful One opened its eyes, three on its face and two more on its chest. They were all glaring wide with faint anger flickering within them. Its arms, arranged in a lotus posture, dropped swiftly as it began divining with measured movements.

Xu Mu is dead!

He felt a flicker of anger. Xu Mu had been one of the few successful converts. He had been an exceptional manifestation of the True Form of Suxikong in the Way of Emptiness. A true Arhat he could rely on.

And that was only part of it. Xu Mu also possessed a profound swordsmanship. He was a cultivator from Jiangnan, and likely at the Sword Essence Realm. He had been the perfect pawn... yet now, he had died so suddenly and uselessly after being sent south to sever his past!

“That Li Family... they possess enough power to prevent even the True Form of Suxikong from reincarnating?!”

The Five-Eyed Merciful One’s three facial eyes flared with fury, while the two on his chest remained icy cold. The lotus dharma artifacts on either side descended from above his head to his sides.

After a brief moment, he murmured inwardly, The few Golden Core Realm cultivators of Jiangnan have already departed for the Outer Heavens. This was not interference. This is the perfect moment to divine fate... Maha is also nearby. I must see what kind of Mandate of Heaven this person carries. Ideally, I can take him for myself...

His regret slightly eased, golden patterns began to form across his face. His five eyes slowly closed as he began calculating with folded fingers.
