# Chapter 1037: The Killing Intent of Martial Cultivation

In the Great Void, dense layers of Metal Malice swirled through the dim light and shadows. A Daoist Master, clad in a robe of golden stone and flying sand, stood bathed in radiance. He took a few steps and stopped, a smile playing on his lips as he gazed down into the mortal realm. Beside him, a woman waited, her body turned slightly toward him.

"My lord… will they fight?"

"They won't."

Daoist Master Tianhuo shook his head with a smile.

"Qing Jifang gains nothing by winning, and he'd only lose face if he lost. There's friction between the two nations, but it's nowhere near the point where a King-Marquis would resort to arms. From start to finish, this has been nothing more than Tanshan trying to curry favor."

Seeing the woman nod in understanding, he pointed a hand beyond the Great Void toward the grand confrontation between the two nations and chuckled.

"But his actions still reek of the same old habits. You know, some people are just stingy to their core. Even if they're reincarnated, reborn into a new life with no memory of the last, they can never shake that miserliness. He's completely unwilling to suffer even the smallest loss, which just makes him seem petty."

The woman clearly knew he was mocking Qing Tangyin. She lowered her gaze and said,

"True Qi was never Mount Changhuai's business to begin with. That master of theirs secludes himself in a remote corner, cut off from all Spiritual Qi, a recluse high above the world. He's on the same path as the Wandering Metal cultivators, isn't that a conflict with the path of worldly engagement? The Taihua Classic says: 'The Heavenly Throne cannot be forced; Karmic Affinity is more precious than divine ability.' Ha! It takes a thousand years for Wu Earth to even drive out the Bright Yang!"

This kind of critical commentary wasn't her place to make. Daoist Master Tianhuo knew she admired that Wandering Metal True Monarch from the north and held a dim view of Mount Changhuai. He spoke in a low, somber tone,

"I've heard that among the various lineages of the Supreme Yang, the Xingbo line was originally preeminent. Yet now, the highest cultivation level belongs to that lord from Mount Changhuai... If he weren't bound by his position, he could very well be aiming for the Dao Embryo. Who could have predicted it?"

The woman fell silent, having understood the warning. Daoist Master Tianhuo waited a while, watching as the gray mist on the horizon gradually receded before finally manifesting himself. He came to a stop amidst the ethereal white fog of the mountainside, looked toward the man in black, and said with a smile, 

"Greetings, King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei had actually noticed him long ago. Having just forced Qing Jifang back, he showed no surprise at all. He simply clasped his hands and said,

"My thanks, Daoist Master!"

Daoist Master Tianhuo understood he was referring to the matter with the Zhuang Clan. Shaking his head with a slight laugh, he followed behind the King-Marquis with his hands clasped behind his back. His bearing was transcendent as he walked along the clouds in the sky. An immortal and a king—they made for a rather complementary pair.

"This is Duanyan!"

The noble immortal scion of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition gestured toward Zhang Duanyan. The woman immediately gave a slight curtsy and smiled.

"Greetings, King Wei!"

Golden Feather had always operated quietly; their successes and failures were all decided within their grotto-heaven. How many years had it been? This celestial maiden had already reached the Purple Mansion Realm.

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod.

Daoist Master Tianhuo spoke politely, "I was planning to visit Ting Province anyway, so I just took this opportunity to come over... Might I ask... where is Fellow Daoist Zhaojing?"

"My grand-uncle is still in seclusion... I'm afraid he won't be able to meet you."

After that long battle to the west, Li Ximing still hadn't shown himself. The claim of seclusion was most likely true, which made Daoist Master Tianhuo's gaze shift slightly.

'What poor timing...'

He thought this to himself, but his words didn't stop. He said mockingly, "Qing Jifang is quite a character. Back during the affair with the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel, I always thought he and his father were just putting on a show. Now, seeing this blatantly idiotic display, even I can't tell if he's genuinely stupid or just pretending."

Daoist Master Tianhuo and Qing Jifang didn't get along, so Li Zhouwei took his taunts as mere pleasantries. Inwardly, however, he was carefully assessing the situation.

'Qing Jifang's strength is not to be underestimated... He has many treasures, his spell arts are extremely powerful, and he took a direct hit from the Radiant Sun King's Halberd without flinching... To completely suppress him, I'd need to be at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm with three divine abilities.'

'And if a real fight breaks out, even if I could hold him off, the other cultivators on the lake would be in grave danger...'

While Daoist Master Tianhuo continued his mockery, Zhang Duanyan smiled faintly, bowed, and said,

"He was born from a spiritual creature, after all, and has roots in the Radiant Profound Origin..."

Daoist Master Tianhuo remained noncommittal.

"Duanyan, that's a superficial way of looking at it. Qing Tangyin may be a miser, but his Dao-Profundity and schemes are not shallow. Back then, he used the Radiant Profound Origin to conceive a son, balanced it with Veiled Yin, and tried to achieve a state of harmony between yin and yang. His initial plan was to have Qing Jifang cultivate True Qi... but alas... what kind of person dares to meddle with the balance of yin and yang? Many have foolishly tried to achieve that balance in their offspring throughout history, and the results are never good... Too much Bright Yang leads to tyranny and cruelty; too much Veiled Yin leads to ugliness and cowardice. Qing Jifang is actually one of the better outcomes!"

His words gave Li Zhouwei pause, as if they sparked some association in his mind. He fell into a thoughtful silence. Daoist Master Tianhuo smiled.

"The moment the boy was born, Qing Tangyin knew it was a dead end. So, banking on his son's decent talent, he rushed him off to cultivate the Qingyi Profound Earth Daoist Tradition, to be used as a pawn by the mountain sect..."

Li Zhouwei nodded and asked probingly, "So now Mount Changhuai and the Golden Oneness are also serving a nation."

Daoist Master Tianhuo's smile slowly faded, revealing a hint of helplessness. He sighed softly and replied,

"The affairs of immortals are simply about cultivating in accordance with the times, observing the celestial calculus, and following the transformations of the Golden Position. You can't speak of serving one or another; we can only say we are following the trend!"

His words were pleasant, but Li Zhouwei knew they weren't sincere. The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition was hardly a group of reclusive cultivators. A day would come when the world would be the one following the transformations of the Golden Oneness and the momentum of the Highest Azure!

Still, Li Zhouwei replied, "The Daoist Master is absolutely right. The current changes in the Golden Position are unfolding between Shu and Song. Zhao and Yan are established in the north, and they are not the type to sit idle and do nothing. I have received the Song Emperor's decree; I wonder how many chances I will have to chat and laugh with you, Daoist Master, in the Western Mountains."

Though Li Zhouwei's words were veiled, Daoist Master Tianhuo was not the flamboyant libertine he appeared to be on the surface; he understood the question perfectly.

'What role is your Golden Feather playing in the Shu Court?'

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes were bright as he awaited his answer.

Wu and Yue were once comparable, but now they were worlds apart. To put it bluntly, the Great Song's current strength was truly pathetic. Unless the Emperor himself took action, Mount Changhuai alone was more than enough to keep the entire Song nation overwhelmed...

Daoist Master Tianhuo saw it all with perfect clarity:

'Sima Yuanli is short-sighted and overly cautious. He can be an aide, but not a pillar of support. Ning Wan is weak-willed and soft-hearted, unfit for important tasks... The Song Court has no true heroes.'

'And beyond the Song Court... Lingu has poor foundations but received heaven-defying resources, yet only produced a three-foot sprout—a laughingstock. Chen Yin defends Yuyang, but his heart is willing while his strength is weak. Sword Gate is selfish and keeps its doors closed. Although Purple Smoke obeys orders, with one sick and one young, how can they amount to anything?'

'Li Zhouwei is the empire's Treasured Artifact, but his edge has yet to be honed, and he's burdened by a killing calamity. Although Liu Bai is the Azure Jade Immortal Blade, he harbors resentment and is stuck guarding the Southern Sea. The depths of Yang Ruiyi are still unknown, but if he cannot cross the Purple Mystery, he'll be a Purple Mansion Realm mid-stage at best, just like Li Zhouwei...'

'All of them combined are barely a match for Mount Changhuai and the Nine Clans. If my Golden Feather were to enter the fray, the Song Court's border defenses would be a joke... And that's not even counting the north! The north covets Li Zhouwei even more!'

'This isn't just a problem for the Great Song dynasty. The Song has the Underworld behind it, so they can ultimately maintain control. But his Moongaze Lake is right on the river... He has no choice but to worry!'

Daoist Master Tianhuo had calculated everything perfectly, but he hesitated before answering. After a long pause, he finally said,

"The great desert has been pacified, and the immortal mountains are sealed. Many pacification departments have been set up in Golden Oneness's old lands.. The cultivators of my Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition are in seclusion and have no intention of interfering in worldly affairs. Only Daoist Master Tianque has descended to Qize. At the very least... we will have many more years to meet like this!"

Li Zhouwei understood immediately and pondered for a moment.

'So True Monarch Taiyuan has indeed joined forces with Mount Changhuai. But it will still be some time before Golden Feather enters the picture. The two sides won't come to real blows anytime soon. But in the end, a confrontation is inevitable.'

Golden Feather's goodwill may have been born of self-interest, but it was openly displayed. Li Zhouwei considered this for a long time, then suddenly raised his eyebrows and said,

"War between north and south, east and west, is imminent... The number of Purple Mansion Realm experts making a move will be the most in a century. Martial Cultivation's radiance is one thing, but the Northern Buddhists may not be the same. If the conflict between north and south reaches a point where rules are disregarded, I fear the first to be slaughtered will be those in the Foundation Establishment Realm."

Daoist Master Tianhuo shook his head. "The Martial Cultivation Star is watching from above. With your wondrous golden pupils, King Wei, have you observed anything?"

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei paused before replying, "When I observe that star, I only feel a knotted convergence of destiny and a brilliant golden light, but nothing more."

Daoist Master Tianhuo said gravely, "This star is no ordinary celestial body. It was not born for the Song, nor will it perish for the Shu. It is a manifestation of Tianwu's killing intent, and all lands illuminated by True Qi fall under its jurisdiction. As long as the Shengyang Acupoint has not been pushed into the Great Void, one is subject to this star's scrutiny and protection. Ordinary people cannot even look upon it. As you are King Wei and blessed by destiny, you are naturally immune to its taboos."

"But when ordinary cultivators gaze upon this star, they only find it dazzlingly bright, as if a raging fire is burning their hearts. It is the same for the Buddhist cultivators of the north; they feel as if swords are pointed at their backs, watched by Martial Cultivation, its power infinite... Charging through army formations is the way of martial cultivation and is not affected. But if any Merciful One were to brandish their butcher's knife and slaughter officials under this star's gaze, fate would surely come to collect its due."

"The accumulation of too much killing intent will cause the light of Martial Cultivation to descend and claim a life. In the end, some decorum must be observed."

This was the first time Li Zhouwei had heard of such a wonder, and he nodded silently. Daoist Master Tianhuo sighed.

"But that's just how it's said... If a powerful expert truly wanted to bully the weak, killing a hundred or a thousand mortals and a cultivator or two, while troublesome, wouldn't result in any major consequences... A war between nations is a war between nations. If someone truly decides to cast aside all face, how could a self-acting killing intent possibly stop them..."

His words carried a subtle reminder. Li Zhouwei acknowledged it. Daoist Master Tianhuo then changed the subject.

"But the young lords can rest assured... As the legitimate sons of King Wei, they will surely receive the full attention of Martial Cultivation. As long as they don't achieve a divine ability, their fates are protected by the Martial Cultivation Star. At most, they'll need to be wary of being besieged by Master Monks, but they won't be forcefully converted by a high-level cultivator."

Li Zhouwei was lost in thought.

'If that's the case... Jianglong and Jiangxia should be fine. Jiangqian is about to attempt his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. But Jiangchun and Que'Wan have Talisman Seeds in them; they might not be subject to this star's jurisdiction. I wonder how they appear to the outside world...'

Although he possessed a wondrous ability, he still lacked a Life Divine Ability and couldn't see things as clearly as these people. After a long silence, he finally let out a quiet breath and said politely,

"My lake has rarely seen such peaceful times. If the Daoist Master finds himself with some leisure, you are welcome to come and visit."

Daoist Master Tianhuo raised his eyebrows and looked at him intently, his expression serious.

"The world is in turmoil, with tides rising and falling. But there is no great conflict in the matters of cultivation. King Wei, you may as well invite a friend or two to discuss the border defenses. The Golden Oneness's position is sensitive, after all. The Western Mountains is as far as we can come."

He stopped abruptly, having reached the edge of the mountain. "Forgive me for not crossing the border; I cannot see you off further," he said with a smile. 

"Having seen King Wei's current bearing... this trip has already been a fruitful one."

Li Zhouwei retracted his gaze, exchanged a few more pleasantries, and waited until the two had stepped into the Great Void and departed. Only then did the smile on his face slowly fade.

'The tides rising and falling... border defenses...'

He turned back with some urgency and commanded, "Zhouda."

Li Zhouda and his men were waiting on the mountain. Hearing the call, the man quickly strode forward, bowed before him, and said respectfully, "Your Majesty!"

Li Zhouwei paced, his gaze fixed on the white mist and the cold, rainy mountain pass.

"The Shu soldiers have retreated and won't be back for a while. The Spiritual Qi in the Western Mountains is weak. Have Miaoshui lead a contingent of troops to the Guyan Temple at the foot of the mountain and repair the formations as planned."

"Yes, sir!"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow.

"Have Xinghan and the members of the Zhuang Clan been brought back?"

"They have been brought into the mountains..."

Li Zhouda replied, and listened as his older brother gave an urgent order: 

"You... have the two of them stay at Guyan and assist Miaoshui... The Zhuang Clan is still useful. Have Zhuang Pingye find some rogue cultivators at the foot of the mountain and establish a foothold."

Recognizing the unusual urgency in his tone, Li Zhouda hurried off. Li Zhouwei frowned and strode down the mountain at a casual pace. His two sons stood on the path, silent.

Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia were both at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. One wore a magnificent crown and crimson robes, the other possessed a handsome and commanding presence. They stood far apart from each other. Seeing Li Zhouwei descend step by step, Li Jianglong, who now managed the clan's affairs, took a direct step forward and said respectfully, "Father."

Li Zhouwei's expression was grave.

"Write two memorials for me. The first is a reply to the Song Emperor, expressing our loyalty. The second is to commend the Zhuang Clan for their meritorious service in defending the nation, stating that Zhuang Cheng is devoted to the Song... Request that the Song Court bestow a noble title upon the Zhuang Clan, with their fief in the great desert, so that he may guard the border."

Li Jianglong was exceptionally clever and understood immediately. Guyan Temple was at the border between the two nations, a hot potato. If the Song Emperor were to issue this decree, it would be equivalent to dispatching a portion of the Great Song's forces to garrison Guyan, which would invisibly relieve the pressure on the lake. He nodded at once, then hesitated.

"Since the Song Court has made our lake a kingdom, they see us as a buffer... This decree... might not be easy to obtain."

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"This is the first official petition from Ting Province. It's reasonable and well-founded, so the Song Court cannot refuse it, but they can delay... This is merely a test to see what the Song Emperor's intentions are toward our lake... If he truly holds some goodwill, he will have no choice but to dispatch these troops."

Li Jianglong nodded immediately.

Li Zhouwei continued, "Once you've handled this, immediately lead Chen Yang, Qu Bushi, and Li Zhoufang to the Milin Mountains. Activate the grand formation and communicate with the cultivators on the eastern shore, telling them to be ready to retreat into the mountains at any time."

Li Jianglong's expression changed instantly. He bowed slightly and hurried down the mountain. Only then did Li Zhouwei turn to look at Li Jiangxia.

Of all the brothers, this young man was the tallest and had the most imposing features. Having later trained in movement techniques and donned a suit of armor, he stood like a mountain, his expression unchanging. He said in a deep voice, "Father!"

Li Zhouwei's gaze fell upon him, his expression solemn.

"In the past, I was unwilling to let you two brothers exert yourselves because the conflict between north and south hinges primarily on destiny. I couldn't be sure some greedy senior wouldn't bully the weak. But now, we are defending the shores of our lake, and this is a national war... The north shore is yours to command. Ding Weizeng and the others will all be under your authority!"

Li Jiangxia clasped his hands solemnly and immediately went down to prepare. Li Zhouwei paced back and forth, hesitating.

'When I visited the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance a few days ago, my grand-uncle was at a critical juncture. With the help of numerous treasures, his chances of a breakthrough are quite high... If I were to forcibly call him out now, not only would all his previous efforts be wasted, but he might even be injured...'

He closed his eyes and pondered for a moment before giving an order: "Go and invite Daoist Master Sima to the lake for a discussion!"
