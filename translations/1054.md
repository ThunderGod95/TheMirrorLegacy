# Chapter 1054: Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body

The light in the great hall was dim.

The dharma lamps to the side had been refilled three times, warming the entire chamber like a furnace, yet the old man on the couch remained damp and cold. He had lain there for three months, drifting between sleep and consciousness, when he suddenly remembered his surname was not Li.

'Back then, Father was called Ye Chengfu.'

When his father was still Ye Chengfu, their days were always a frantic rush. He seemed to run a small business at the village entrance, but work was scarce, so he often took odd jobs at others’ homes. Occasionally, he would return with a large sack of rice, beans, and wheat, striding proudly through the door and proclaiming himself the third-smartest man in Lijing Village.

Li Qiuyang couldn't remember much more. If he had managed to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, perhaps he could recall more of the past.

The old man lifted his head slightly. Beside him, Sun Bai was applying a balm to his lips, using the spiritual resources of Horn Wood and dharma power to nourish the 'lips'—the symbolic gateway for appetite in the context of Merging Fire. He hoped to prolong his life by a few more breaths, a desperate measure akin to drinking poison to quench one's thirst.

The old man stared blankly at the ceiling, his voice weak and thin. “Xuan… Xuan…”

A white-haired man nearby coughed twice and bowed his tall frame. Tears welled in his drooping eyes as he replied,

“Wait… just a little longer.”

Li Qiuyang’s memories were faded, but he still recalled kneeling before that old man as a small child to receive the "Azure Origin Wheel Nourishment Art."

Li Mutian had instructed him to honor the sect and revere the Dao, to be close to his relatives and live in harmony with his clan. And so, he had taken the surname Li.

With that one act, he, Li Qiuyang, had enjoyed a respected status for one hundred and sixty-five years. Now, at Moongaze Lake, even cultivators of the Foundation Establishment Realm had to treat him with courtesy.

“Old Ancestor… the master is here, the master is here!”

Through the haze, a gentle breeze drifted to his pillow. Li Qiuyang forced his eyes open, only to see another aged face. Li Xuanxuan looked even older than Chen Donghe, who stood beside him; he was a wreck, though his spirit and vitality remained intact. His face was stained with tears.

“Qiuyang… old friend. It looks like you’re leaving me too…”

Li Qiuyang struggled for a moment but couldn't turn over. If not for a Horn Wood Foundation Establishment cultivator sustaining him, he would have been long gone.

In his youth, Li Xuanxuan had run a shop in the Xiao Clan Market. He and Li Qiuyang had survived a demonic raid together, forging a bond in a time of peril. The current generation of the Li clan could no longer comprehend that kind of precarious, lonely fear. With so many of their old acquaintances gone, the two had often found comfort in each other's company, and their friendship ran deep.

The Li Qiuyang he once knew was gone. The man on the bed was like a lump of rotting flesh. Merging Fire had ravaged his essence and vitality. Although his body had been restored later, the damage to his foundation and lifespan was irreparable. Li Xuanxuan could barely recognize his features anymore, seeing only two turbid eyes peering from within the withered skin.

A profound sorrow welled up in Li Xuanxuan’s heart, followed by a terrifying loneliness. He lowered his head.

“Qiuyang… Qiuyang… what is it you can’t let go of?”

The old man on the bed let out two shallow breaths but gave no other response.

Li Qiuyang's talent hadn't been poor. The spirit fruit he consumed in his youth had accelerated his cultivation, but it had also doomed his chances at Qi Refining, forcing him to cultivate a miscellaneous form of Qi. Yet among his many descendants, not a single one had shown any real promise. After more than a century, none had managed to surpass him.

Li Qiuyang laboriously shifted his gaze to stare at Li Xuanxuan.

He had always known this brother from the main family held many secrets. He also knew he had never truly been part of the Li clan’s inner circle. And it wasn't just him. Even Chen Yang, for all her outstanding talent, had he truly been accepted after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm? The so-called Qingdu bloodline was nothing more than a joke.

But he had held Li Yuanxiu in his arms, led Li Xiangping’s horse, shared tea with Li Xuanfeng, and walked through Lixia with Chen Mufeng. Moons had set and suns had risen. He had witnessed sixty-two thousand sunsets over Moongaze Lake. For this land that had birthed and raised him, and for the people on it, he felt a deep, sorrowful love.

As if mustering his last ounce of strength, the old man’s lips parted, and he murmured, “Xuanxuan… they are too close…”

Li Xuanxuan’s brow twitched. He paused, stunned, then reached out to support him. A frightened Sun Bai rose to his feet, instructing a junior to moisten the Old Ancestor’s lips with medicinal soup before hastily retreating.

Li Xuanxuan seemed lost in thought, asking blankly,

“Who… who is too close?”

Li Qiuyang began to struggle, coughing so violently it seemed he would expel his lungs. He groaned,

“Out…”

Li Xuanxuan took the bowl of soup from the junior, waving his hand to dismiss the others. Chen Donghe raised an eyebrow, looking at the dying man on the couch. Seeing the intense stare fixed on him, he hid his tears and turned to leave.

Soon, only Li Xuanxuan remained in the vast hall. Li Qiuyang’s breathing grew ragged and intense. A sliver of strength returned to his hand, and he gripped Li Xuanxuan’s arm, his voice a strained, guttural hiss.

“They… and you… are too close… The Jiang… the Jiang family…”

Li Xuanxuan’s lips trembled. The old man’s teeth chattered as he began to spit blood.

“If… if he were here… only by crippling them all… would it be clean…” he mumbled.

Li Xuanxuan couldn’t tell who ‘he’ was—Old Ancestor Li Mutian? Or Li Xiangping? He certainly understood the reference to the Jiang family, but since Li Ximing had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he hadn't given the matter a thought for a very, very long time.

'The Jiang family… their ancestor was murdered… But our family is flourishing. Not to mention King Wei, both Jiangqian and Que'Wan are seeds for the Purple Mansion Realm. If we were ever to lose all our Purple Mansion experts, the clan would surely be annihilated. Why worry about internal strife now…'

He fell silent for a moment. The old man before him finally went still. Li Xuanxuan turned and sat on the steps, his choked sobs giving way to quiet weeping. A clutter of footsteps sounded from outside the hall. The first to rush in was an unfamiliar man who fell to his knees before Li Xuanxuan with a thud, wailing,

“Old Ancestor!”

A middle-aged man who followed close behind was knocked off balance but refused to be outdone. He too dropped to his knees, his cries even louder, his howls like thunder.

Li Xuanxuan raised his tear-filled eyes and scanned the crowd of descendants scrambling to get inside. With a dazed expression, he drew the curtain around the couch and, with a flick of his sleeve, sent them all tumbling out of the hall.

The chamber fell silent instantly. No one remained but Chen Donghe, who stood with his eyes closed, tears streaming down his face. After weeping for a while, Li Xuanxuan noticed that the cries outside were sparse, mostly replaced by whispers. He spoke, his voice devoid of energy,

“After six generations, the bonds of kinship have faded, but their foolishness remains as strong as ever.”

## Deer Weeds Island

The storm at sea had subsided, and the sky had taken on an eerie, verdant hue. All color was blocked out by the light of the grotto-mansion. On the walls, bluish-purple patterns flickered one by one, channeling a torrent of Spiritual Qi inward.

A woman in a white robe sat cross-legged in the center. Her willow-like eyebrows were curved, her expression serene. Her vermilion lips were slightly parted, as if holding a hazy, colorful glow. Her hands formed a seal at her abdomen, radiating a brilliant divine light.

After an unknown amount of time, she concluded her wondrous art. The colorful glow retracted into her Shengyang Acupoint. She rose to her feet, the light in her almond-shaped eyes brightening and then dimming as she exhaled, her eyebrows raised in satisfaction.

'The difficulty of mastering the "Rainbow Throne" is much lower than I anticipated… I estimate it will take no more than two years…'

In her early years, Li Que'wan had spent a vast amount of time on the Shamanic Talisman Dao. Her spiritual aperture was located between her eyebrows, allowing her to visualize the Shengyang Acupoint from a very early stage. Coupled with her exceptional talent for shamanic arts, cultivating this art had still felt like rowing against a current—arduous and slow.

Fortunately, that effort had not been in vain. When she switched to cultivating this secret technique, it felt as if she were unraveling a silk cocoon, each step clear as day. All that time spent in her youth was now paying back tenfold, as if she had divine assistance.

'The Whole Pill is a great test of one's Dao-Profundity. If an ordinary person were to cultivate the "Rainbow Throne," it would be impossible to succeed without ten or twenty years of effort… Yet in my hands, it feels so easy…'

She breathed a silent sigh of relief, though her thoughts drifted.

'I heard my clan uncle was enfeoffed as King Wei… I wonder how much trouble that will bring. It’s infuriating that I can only stay overseas, unable to help.'

Her desire to reach the Purple Mansion Realm grew more urgent by the day. Fortunately, she had patience and simply redoubled her efforts. Still, when the day came for the family letters to arrive, she always emerged from her seclusion on time.

As she walked out of her grotto-mansion, cultivators on both sides bowed deeply. Li Que'wan hurried onward and, just as she expected, saw the grotto's main hall shimmering with light. The pale blue patterns of the wall murals reflected off a violet-gold table. A man sat at its center, dressed in a white fur cloak with a precious pearl tied at his waist. Three vertical marks adorned his brow as he stared intently at a scroll on the table.

“Greetings, Daoist Master!”

This man was Daoist Master Yuanbian, Liu Changdie.

Liu Changdie appeared very composed. He had spent little time in seclusion these past years, choosing instead to guard this island. He used to venture out occasionally, but after that one stormy night, he had not taken a single step off the island.

The reason was simple: he was terrified.

The thunderstorm that night had been highly unnatural, clearly directed by someone. Liu Changdie had suppressed his impulse to investigate. Afterward, he secretly performed divinations and, combining them with the subtleties of his own divine ability, managed to uncover several clues.

'A powerful cultivator must have acted that night, likely targeting me… But they were wary of the grand formation and, being in the Eastern Sea, were thwarted by the Dragon-kin. That’s the only reason they failed!'

There was a reason Liu Changdie spent most of his years in the Southern Sea and the Eastern Sea. Many of the treasures he possessed were 'fated opportunities' he had stumbled upon in these waters. He had long suspected that the Dragon-kin had a vested interest in protecting him. This incident had confirmed all his prior suspicions.

'Even hiding here in the Eastern Sea, within this grand formation, there are still people who want to harm me… If I went elsewhere, who knows what would happen!'

Seeing Li Que'wan, Liu Changdie seemed pleased. He nodded at her and rose with a smile.

“You are quite punctual.”

When Liu Changdie first arrived on the island, he received instructions from Li Ximing to protect Li Que'wan at all costs. He had kept this in mind, and after a private conversation with her, he was utterly stunned by her heavenly talent. The depth of her Dao-Profundity and the clarity of her thinking when casting spell arts were not at all like those of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Upon further inquiry, he learned that Li Que'wan had practiced shamanic arts for many years, which explained a great deal.

'The Shamanic Talisman Dao is ancient, even more so than the Ancient Immortal Dao of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature or dining on mist and sipping dew. It points directly to the root of the Great Dao…'

The Ancient Immortal Dao of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature or dining on mist and sipping dew usually referred to the Three Profound Daoist Traditions, which originated from the Orthodox Origin Yin-Yang. One of these traditions had spread and evolved to become the Three Profoundities known throughout the world today. But the Shamanic Talisman Dao was a tradition that had spread across the world in the same era as the Orthodox Origin Yin-Yang!

'Within the Ancient Merging Method, the Shamanic Talisman Dao alone accounts for the earliest three figures: the Merging Owl, the Upper Shaman, and the Jade True. Furthermore, they occupy the most critical first, third, and sixth positions of the nine slots, which speaks to its immense power.'

'If one can achieve great things in the Shamanic Talisman Dao, commanding most of the spell arts of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao becomes effortless…'

Of course, achieving 'great things' was no small feat. It was not something one could accomplish by merely learning a few shamanic arts or mastering some curses. One had to be an orthodox successor of this Dao. The legendary Duanmu Kui, who could suppress all his peers, and Jiang Boqing, who was versed in the two paths of Immortals and Buddhists, were testaments to this.

For this reason, Liu Changdie held this junior from the Li clan in extremely high regard. He could already see her future path to the Purple Mansion Realm and had begun to treat her as a peer.

“Come!” he said with a smile. “Take a look at this!”

Li Que'wan’s respect for him deepened. She strode forward and stood beside the table. On it lay a golden scroll of soft material, seemingly woven from some kind of spirit silk. The runes upon it were abstruse, with several lines of large, colored characters.

[Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body].

As Li Que'wan examined it, Liu Changdie explained with a smile, “This scroll was sent by your family. They obtained it from some place called the Changxiao Gate. It’s an ancient artifact, locked with a secret preservation technique. They asked me to decipher it… It took quite some effort.”

“Now that it’s open, I see it is a wondrous method for Body-Swapping Transference, and a very sophisticated one at that. It can be used to refine an alternate body for preserving one’s life, cultivating the Dao, evading tribulations, and avoiding disasters. If one’s Dao-Profundity is high enough and they possess some rare treasures, they might even be able to use this art for reincarnation.”

Li Que'wan’s eyes burned with intensity as she stared at the golden script. 

“It’s so precious!” she exclaimed.

Although Li Que'wan wasn't entirely clear on Li Zhouwei's current situation, she understood the principle that once one's divine ability was perfected, the only paths forward were seeking the Golden Core or reincarnation. The thought that this might be useful to her own Daoist Master brought a radiant smile to her face, and she studied the scroll with great care.

Such an item might not have been extraordinary in ancient times, but today, when methods for reincarnation and Great Void-walking were mostly lost, it was invaluable. Liu Changdie nodded in agreement.

“A pity,” he sighed. “Its primary purposes are the first four. The reincarnation aspect is merely a side benefit. The resources required to refine an alternate body to the point where it could be used for reincarnation… one could probably cultivate several Purple Mansion experts or acquire numerous new divine abilities for oneself with that amount of wealth. And it wouldn't even add much to the chances of success. Why bother?”

“Compared to ancient demon embryos, the Ten-Colored Heart-Uniting Pearl… or even Metallic Essence, the probability of this technique succeeding is far too low, and it comes with many side effects. It can only be considered a final resort, a path taken out of desperation.”

He chuckled.

“In any case… it is still precious. I was fortunate enough to get a few good looks at it.”

Li Que'wan quickly shook her head, saying respectfully,

“Your friendship with our family’s Daoist Master is profound; it was only right that it be sent to you to share. How could you say such a thing? We couldn’t possibly let you spend so much time deciphering the scroll for nothing…”

Liu Changdie shook his head and laughed. He had long since stopped considering his time a precious commodity. He took a letter from his sleeve and said,

“A letter from home… Go on, read it.”

Li Que'wan received it like a treasure and began to read. Liu Changdie watched her profile and sighed inwardly.

'I used to think… if I still had a son or daughter, I could arrange a match with her. But looking at her now… even if I did have a child, they would not be worthy of her.'

As Liu Changdie was lost in thought, a figure hurried into the grotto. The man bowed before him and reported respectfully,

“Daoist Master… there is a… a Demon King waiting outside the island! He… wishes to see you!”

'A Demon King?!'

Liu Changdie’s first thought was of the Dragon-kin, and his heart leaped in alarm. But then, he felt a sudden resonance and took a golden jade pendant from his sleeve. A closer look brought a flash of understanding and a hint of embarrassment.

'It's Senior Fuxun! He’s come to find me!'
