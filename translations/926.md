# Chapter 926: The Valiant King

The river waters howled as a furious storm gathered on the banks. Monks from the north, like a dense swarm of black dots, swarmed the grounds surrounding a dark, foreboding temple.

A young man clad in crimson armor rode a stream of fire toward them. He paused briefly outside the grand defense array before ascending quickly to Cold Cloud Peak. In the gloom of the storm, the plum blossoms looked withered and weak. A tall Daoist Master stood before the courtyard, his gaze heavy and profound.

"Father."

Li Jiangqian bowed, his voice respectful. His golden eyes were grave. The moment his words faded, another pair of golden eyes turned from the shadows. Li Jiangqian met that gaze for an instant, and then both looked away. Only then did he hear his father’s voice.

"How goes it?"

Li Jiangqian completed his salute and replied, "Reporting to Father, Jiangxia has gathered his forces and converged with the people from Muquan and Purple Smoke. They have made camp in the Wilderness. Daoist Master Tinglan came personally."

"Good."

Li Zhouwei nodded.

The two shores were now locked in a standoff. Master Monks and their lesser brethren frequently crossed south to conduct raids and harassment. Li Jianglong was assigned to guard the northern bank, Jiangxia had gone to the Wilderness, and Li Jiangqian was stationed on the lake. Each had their duty.

After reporting, however, Li Jiangqian paused. He spoke again, this time with marked hesitation.

"We... we received word from Fourth Brother. He is in the Simin Prefecture... and is on his way back."

Li Zhouwei had five sons known to the world. Three had already succeeded in the Foundation Establishment Realm and held positions of importance. This fourth son, Li Jiangliang, was also a man of outstanding talent, gifted since birth. He had been personally tutored by Cui Jueyin from a young age and was now at the point where he, too, could break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Yet, he was fond of traveling and rarely spent time at home.

Li Zhouwei had been in seclusion for many years, only returning after his breakthrough to the Daoist Master realm. It was only because of this that the boy was finally, and perhaps reluctantly, making his way back to the lake. Li Zhouwei rarely interfered in his children's choices and had simply let him be. But seeing Li Jiangqian’s strange expression, he said flatly:

"Speak."

Li Jiangqian lifted the hem of his robes and knelt.

"We hear," he said in a low voice, "that Fourth Brother is bringing a woman back with him. Her surname is Yang... It is our failure that we did not learn of this sooner. We only understood when he sent a personal letter. Father, please forgive our negligence!"

Li Zhouwei’s brow finally furrowed slightly. He turned his head. "Which Yang?"

Li Jiangqian kept his head low. "Reporting to Father... she is of the imperial lineage."

Li Zhouwei’s eyes narrowed. "Then you can hardly be blamed," he said softly.

The Yang clan was not just of imperial descent; they were one of the few families with clear, confirmed ties to the Underworld. The existence of Yang Tianya was still a secret to the outside world! It was possible it was mutual affection, but Li Zhouwei found it hard to believe this was some simple, accidental romance. He could only compose his expression and nod.

"Imperial lineage is fine. It is, naturally, a good match."

Beside them, Li Jianglong kept his eyes downcast, while Li Jiangqian remained in a silent bow. It was clear that both of them were deeply uncomfortable.

Li Chenghuai had left home to pursue his cultivation. On the surface, this was to receive his father's protection and seek a grander path on the Dao. But from another angle, was it not also a move by the Li family to weaken the Yang family's influence? Yang Xiao'er had been exceptionally good to Li Xizhi, yet Li Xizhi had never wanted the Yang's influence to touch Moongaze Lake. Many of his arrangements, it seemed, were designed to kill multiple birds with one stone.

Allowing Li Chenghuai to leave the lake was, yes, part of his desire to seek the Dao, but it was hard to believe this other consideration wasn't also a factor. Zhouluo was already half-subordinated to Azure Pond's command. It wasn't until Li Jiangchun's birth that things had relaxed, and the idea of letting a child stay and serve on the lake had returned.

But now, this... this move of acting first and reporting later naturally made the Li family's leadership sensitive. The Underworld's status was simply too lofty—it was the primary reason The Unsurpassed in the north had not yet crossed the river. The Li and Yang families had always been close, making it difficult to protest.

"After all," Li Zhouwei said softly, "the north is aggressive. The Yang family also means well. A marriage connection like this only serves to show the closeness between our two families."

At this, both Li Jiangqian and Li Jianglong managed a smile and voiced their agreement. Li Zhouwei put away the jade slip in his hand, sinking into his own thoughts.

'Both the Radiant Celestial Wave Art and the Arranged-Mansions Celestial Yang Escape Art are spell arts that strongly complement Audience with the Celestial Gate. They both feel like clever shortcuts, so their future potential for development is limited. But at least the cultivation speed isn't slow. I've mastered the entry-level for both.'

Cultivating these two spell arts had felt surprisingly natural, as if water flowing into a pre-carved channel. Perhaps it was due to the many secret methods he had cultivated in his past, granting him a much deeper understanding of the Bright Yang. He quietly stored the knowledge away.

'Pondering in a vacuum is extremely time-consuming. Since I've already reached the entry-level, I'll naturally have opportunities in combat to help me comprehend them further. That will be enough.'

As he was musing, Li Que'wan approached, holding a jade box. She bowed nearby, offering it with both hands. "Reporting to the Daoist Master," she said respectfully, "the three types of Spiritual Qi have been collected."

Li Zhouwei looked slightly surprised, raising an eyebrow. "So fast."

For his future cultivation, Li Zhouwei had once again prioritized movement techniques. The Li Fire art, Tread on Flames, was certainly powerful, but it wasn't his first choice.

He was, after all, different from Li Ximing. Li Ximing had received the empowerment of Valley Wind Guide-Fire, giving him extremely strong control over all types of flames—a level of mastery few cultivators in the world could match. Cultivating Tread on Flames was naturally far easier for him. Li Zhouwei, however, had received the empowerment of Illuminating Sun and Moon. What he needed to elevate in the future was his Dao-Profundity in the Bright Yang. The more Bright Yang methods he cultivated, the greater the benefit when his Dao-Profundity eventually increased. If he chose a Li Fire Movement technique, he would find it very difficult to reap that benefit.

Thus, he had meticulously searched the High Firmament Pavilion within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. He had searched for a Bright Yang Movement technique for a long time but had been mostly dissatisfied. But that search *had* led him to something else: a fifth-grade Pure Qi spell art, the Profound Vastness Art!

This art cultivated Pure Qi. When the cultivator was unharmed, it would be nurtured within the Great Void. When injured, it would use the Pure Qi to heal. If one's physical body perished, one could even use the Shengyang Acupoint to escape with the aid of the Pure Qi. Li Zhouwei had been overjoyed.

He wasn't interested in its miraculous life-saving properties. Rather, he coveted its ability to use Pure Qi for healing.

His Dharma body was outstanding, but this also meant it was far more difficult to heal when injured. Although Illuminating Sun and Moon tied his life-mandate and cultivation to a single Mansion, allowing his body to avoid many otherwise fatal injuries, being wounded was still a massive inconvenience. It was completely different from Li Ximing, who could simply take a pill and recover fully in less than half a year of seclusion.

The Profound Vastness Art, which cultivated Pure Qi, was a rare and wondrous healing method that did not conflict with other Daoist traditions. He had decisively postponed his search for a movement technique and first acquired the Profound Vastness Art to cultivate.

Pure Qi arts rarely had harsh requirements, and this one was no exception. It came with several Qi-gathering incantations, requiring one portion each of the Lesser Clear Spirit Qi, the Lesser Celestial-Yang Pure Qi, and the Profound Promise Pure Qi. These were the exact three types of Spiritual Qi Li Que'wan was delivering.

These three Pure Qis were not difficult to gather, but only the Lesser Clear Spirit Qi was widely known. The others were unheard of. To gather them from scratch would normally take years. Hearing his unasked question, Li Que'wan quickly explained:

"The other two are very similar to the Lesser Clear Spirit Qi; they share the same source, and the gathering methods were provided. This junior used the transformative properties of my immortal foundation and spent a few extra portions of Lesser Clear Spirit Qi to exchange for them, allowing me to obtain them early."

Not having to wait was, of course, excellent. Li Zhouwei nodded in satisfaction. He was about to say more when he suddenly looked up, his expression turning sharp with alarm. He had sensed something. In an instant, his form dissolved into light and vanished.

The others on the peak exchanged a glance and looked up at the sky together.

"Someone is crossing the river!"

Li Zhouwei took a single step, reappearing in the Great Void. Billowing bright light, accompanied by streams of white Qi, flowed from his body, coalescing into the form of a Qilin-like beast that circled around him. His weapon was not in his hand; he simply stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his voice booming like thunder.

"Which fellow Daoist has come to visit!"

Flames erupted in the Great Void. True Fire blazed like a waterfall, like a raging river, spreading through the void and transforming it into a domain of fire. A middle-aged man appeared within.

He wore complex robes—a snow-white upper garment and a bright red lower robe, with a heavy black cloak draped over his shoulders. His build was majestic, his nose high-bridged, and he possessed a fine beard and thick, dark brows. He was, by any measure, heroically handsome.

In his imposing eyes, True Fire roiled and flowed. As he gazed over from afar, the very Great Void seemed to scorch, as if all creation had been plunged into a furnace.

The blazing True Fire reflected in the void. Li Zhouwei's voice was deep, tinged with a fraction of doubt.

"So, it is the Valiant King!"

This person was indeed a King-Marquis of the Gao family. A mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who commanded three True Fire divine abilities. The very same man who was currently traveling south, persuading the various families to surrender: the Valiant King, Gao Fu!

His reputation was enormous, his strength formidable. He was a famed King-Marquis of the north, who long ago had earned acclaim for "Slaying Demons by the Lake" and "Bringing Order to the Qi Lands." Back during the North-South conflict, when there was a great disparity in power, he had been invited to stand guard. Even Daoist Master Qiushui and Daoist Master Yuanxiu had to show him deference. Li Zhouwei needed only to see the True Fire and the famously handsome, thick-bearded face to know who it was.

'The Valiant King has crossed the river...'

The Gao family's role in the recent conflicts had not been overtly hostile, but for him to cross the river now... it was a deeply suspicious act. Li Zhouwei could only give a slight nod, his voice ringing out.

"I was unaware of the Valiant King's arrival. Forgive me for not welcoming you sooner."

But the King-Marquis, wreathed in True Fire, remained utterly motionless within the flames. He was like a statue, a divine idol. His eyes, filled with blazing fire, simply stared at Li Zhouwei, and his gaze seemed almost... lost.

A full, long breath passed. Then, this King-Marquis, famed for his majestic bearing and fine beard, finally moved his lips. His expression was one of extreme complexity. His voice, though resonant and magnetic, carried a rough, hoarse edge.

"This humble King... greets... greets... Young Master."

He did not use "Daoist Master." He did not ask for a Daoist title. He did not use "Lord of the Lake" or "Master of the Li Clan." Instead, after several pained hesitations, he used the term "Young Master."

Li Zhouwei was taken aback, uncertain how to respond.

He was not ignorant of the Gao family's origins. Their original surname had been Lou; "Gao" was a name bestowed upon them by the Wei Emperor, the fount of their family's rise. The Gao family had always revered the Wei orthodox line. In those days, the Qi lands were directly north of the Ning State, and the two had existed in mutual support.

Even during the chaotic twilight of the Liang dynasty, right before the King of Yan, Murong Dechang, had fallen, the Gao family still flew the banner of "Respecting Wei." It was for this very reason that the current Gao family was often mocked by the other great families who had "passed the gate." There were even calls within their own clan to revert their surname to Lou.

When Li Xuanfeng was at the Great Ning Palace, he had heard some people refer to the Gao family as "Lou's dogs and horses." Li Zhouwei had never imagined that the current Valiant King would still harbor this small, lingering sentiment toward him.

He could only reply, "May I ask what business brings the great King here?"

The man's deep-set eyes, burning with True Fire, seemed impossibly profound. Gao Fu had regained much of his composure. He spoke softly.

"I have not come this time for public matters. It is merely... a small, personal wish. I have come to ask a question."

"Please speak."

Li Zhouwei grew wary, but he watched as the man sighed.

"This King had an aunt, surname Gao, given name Xijiang. She was very kind to me when I was young. But she wished to roam the world, and she often wandered. Years ago, she was in Jiangbei, and later, she came south to Jiangnan. Now... her lifespan is at its end. I have come to take her back. Either for her to return to her roots, or to bring her remains and funerary robes back to be buried in Yingqiu."

He paused. "It is a pity that once she crossed into Jiangnan, we lost all trace of her. She also uses a Daoist title when traveling. Therefore, I came specifically to ask the Lord of the Lake, hoping you might help this King find her."

Li Zhouwei found the entire story strange. "I see," he said, looking up. "May I know the elder's Daoist title? I will search for you, great King."

Gao Fu's eyes, still reflecting the inferno, finally met his gaze directly. His voice was calm.

"Her Daoist title... is Jianghuzi."

The name struck Li Zhouwei like a bolt of lightning. He froze, his expression shifting several times as he stared at the King-Marquis.

Li Ximing might not recognize that name, but Li Zhouwei remembered *exactly* who she was. Years ago, when the Secret Diffusion sects were at war with Moongaze Lake, their aggression had been relentless, right up until Li Ximing broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm. When the cultivators from Floating Cloud Cave retreated, they had left behind their old, weak, and sick, who were subsequently captured. Jianghuzi had been one of them.

At the time, Li Ximing had noted she was from the Zhao State and thought it odd. But seeing that she cultivated Pure Qi, he had simply allowed her to live and cultivate in the lake's Wilderness.

Meeting Gao Fu's intensely meaningful gaze, Li Zhouwei had a sudden, dawning realization.

'There are still Wei loyalists in the Gao family. This old cultivator came south... she came to see the Wei-Li bloodline. She probably didn't dare to openly side with Moongaze Lake, so she did the opposite, taking up residence in the Floating Cloud Cave to observe the situation...'

But doubts remained. Li Zhouwei put on a mask of surprise. "So, Elder Jianghuzi is an elder of the Gao family! To think she never said a word all these years. My family has truly been rude... It's just, I have been in seclusion for my breakthrough these past few years and have only just returned. I am not aware of the current situation of the few rogue cultivators in the Wilderness. I will make inquiries for the Valiant King at once!"

A faint smile touched Gao Fu's eyes. He nodded lightly. His low voice, carried by his divine ability, quietly drifted into Li Zhouwei's ears.

"At her advanced age," he said hauntingly, "she approaches all things as if she is already facing death. How could she dare?"

The implication was obvious—perhaps *too* obvious, something that could only be said in a private transmission between two such powerful cultivators. Li Zhouwei was momentarily speechless. He could only shake his head.

"Please wait a moment, great King."

He silently turned and dispatched someone to fetch the old woman, his mind racing.

'Jianghuzi has been in the Wilderness all these years. Do the other families know? They probably don't...'

'Gao Fu came all this way himself. Was it truly just to retrieve an elder? He appeared in the Great Void right next to the lake. Did Daoist Master Tinglan sense him?'

But no matter how he analyzed it, the man before him had already dispersed his protective divine ability, appearing far more approachable. Yet his eyes, fixed on Li Zhouwei, remained just as grave.

Li Zhouwei replayed the man's words in his mind and suddenly felt a profound chill.

'Jianghuzi joining the Floating Cloud Cave was likely her own choice. But... whose idea was it to leave her behind, to let her fall into my family's hands? Jianghuzi's Qi and blood were failing; she was old and sick. If she had been killed by our people back then, how would Gao Fu be acting right now? Would he still have come here, speaking so politely?'

His golden eyes flickered, his heart sinking.

'This Valiant King... he has probably already figured it out. Someone wants discord between the Gao and the Li. And he is simply helpless to stop it... And my family? At such a sensitive time, for the Gao family to appear, asking for an ancestor's remains... the Supreme Yang Dao tradition probably isn't smiling about this, either.'
