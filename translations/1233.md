# Chapter 1233: Clandestine Contact

Li Que'wan formed an incantation seal and sat quietly within the grand hall, the commandery pill before her spiraling and flickering, blooming with silver-red hues until, after an unknown passage of time, her slender hand relaxed and she opened her eyes, the light drawing inward.

She gently raised her hand; the original wound on her wrist had vanished completely, revealing skin as fair as jade as the Manifestations Earth affliction surged and then disappeared entirely.

Awaiting the Supreme Divine possessed a nurturing virtue, which, complemented by the empowerment from Hidden Profundity's Profound Coffin Crimson Water, had ensured her injuries did not worsen during more than half a year of gentle nourishment; now, after taking the Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder, her recovery had been exceedingly swift, all told, a little over four hundred days had passed.

Li Que'wan had rushed back to the lake estate as soon as she had achieved her breakthrough, spending her time fending off one issue after another, and only today, with her injuries finally healed, did she truly have a moment to breathe; she could not help but fall into contemplation, carefully reflecting on her gains and losses in that great battle.

'Ultimately, I still lack offensive capabilities. My one success in scheming against Qing Jifang was only due to the advantage of him being unprepared and caught completely off guard... Without that silencing art, the role I could have played in the battle would have been far, far too small.'

This was, in many ways, unavoidable; a cultivator's primary foundation is their Dao, and the Whole Pill path was simply not one that excelled in combat. It lacked the killing power of Dui Metal's Palace of Retracted Killing or Merging Fire's Life-Ending Expulsion, and in this respect, was not even the equal of the Great Parting Scripture!

Yet her clan had an advantage: the all-encompassing collection of cultivation methods and spell arts within the High Firmament Pavilion. If she was determined to find an offensive technique, it was not impossible, but she was still hesitant:

"Is this the right time for that?"

In her opinion, their family already had sufficient offensive power. King Wei was a given, and once her elder brother matured and mastered another divine ability or two, his orthodox Li Fire would make him one not to be trifled with.

Given this, Li Que'wan felt it was somewhat inappropriate for her to be the one to shore up this weakness now.

'It is said that "if your arts cannot protect your Dao, you invite deadly peril," yet for a Whole Pill practitioner, cultivating offensive arts is an arduous and thankless task. In such a short period of time... I doubt I could achieve much, and I fear my efforts might even prove counterproductive...'

What gave her further insight was her own Talisman Qi.

'My Luminous Chord of Obscurity is certainly not weak in combat, but it is averse to injury and ill-suited for charging onto the front lines. Its focus is on self-cultivation and nurturing one's nature; though when a move must be made, there is absolutely no hesitation...'

Thus, Li Que'wan found herself leaning toward a versatile art that could supplement her own divine abilities. It should possess defensive power and, ideally, be able to neutralize enemy spell arts to avoid injury—if it were ancient, pointing directly to the origin like the shamanic arts, and allowed her to draw broader insights, that would be even better.

With that, a name quickly surfaced in her mind.

The Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence.

This art had been obtained by Li Zhouwei from the Cui Clan and was a technique from the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate of old!

The art was exceedingly ancient and profound, a method of the old cultivators that originated from the spatial storage arts of the True Dao Sect. Some cultivators could not even grasp its rudiments after more than a decade of study, but once mastered, one's sleeve could contain all manner of transformations, faintly resembling a world unto itself...

This benefit made the young woman's eyes light up.

The arts of the Whole Pill could transform spiritual items and perform all sorts of wonders, but at higher levels, it required raising a high platform and establishing a grand formation; the transformation of over ten streams of Profound Minister Moon Essence she had once described to Li Ximing would necessitate establishing a great hall and arranging a spiritual aura!

'But this way, I could place many of my Whole Pill items within my sleeve to evolve under constant supervision, and I would no longer be rendered immobile while helping the clan transform spiritual items.'

The thought was far too tempting.

'And that is merely the initial stage of proficiency; if I could master it to perfection, I could even store away the spiritual water, spiritual fire, spell arts, and spiritual artifacts of others, making it an extremely useful protective art as well!'

She did not hesitate, immediately taking out the jade slip to study it in detail. Her other hand lay palm up, and a light flickered in turn between her five fingers as she felt out the divine mysteries within.

Once she began reading, she could not stop. The light and shadows on her body shifted constantly, the reflections of the sun and moon flickering over her like firelight as she felt herself sinking into a vast ocean of profound mysteries, where true principles resided in every corner.

'What a magnificent art!'

She read, completely engrossed, and it seemed as if only the time it takes for an incense stick to burn had passed when she suddenly started and performed a quick calculation with her fingers.

"Another three hundred days have passed! No wonder they say it's so difficult!"

Although the spell art was abstruse, Li Que'wan had seen shamanic arts many times more so, and found its current difficulty to be just right, making for a thoroughly satisfying study. Even so, three hundred days had only been enough for her to gain a thorough understanding of the introductory scroll—not to master it, but her mind had warned her that the appointed day with the Golden Feather Sect was drawing near...

'Time passes in the blink of an eye!'

Although she had not yet mastered the art, she was already confident in her grasp of it. Her steps grew lighter as she rose and stepped into the Great Void, only to discover a festive atmosphere on the lake island. It was decorated with lanterns and streamers, alive with the sound of firecrackers and the clamor of voices—a truly bustling scene. Feeling a bit curious, she rode a beam of light all the way to Gardenia Scenery Mountain, where she finally saw her elder brother.

While she had been diligently studying, Li Jiangqian had naturally not been idle either. He was supposed to have gone to the great desert to cultivate, but with so many people and prying eyes on the lake island recently, and with Li Que'wan in seclusion to heal her wounds, he had simply stayed to practice his spell arts there just in case. A fierce fire blazed in his palm, changing ceaselessly with a faint surge of golden-red light; it was a rather familiar art.

The Sun's Resonant Parting Art.

This art was easy to learn but difficult to master. Both of the Li family's Daoist Masters had used it, and Li Zhouwei had even achieved a decent Dao-Profundity with it during his Foundation Establishment Realm, but as his divine abilities advanced, he had gradually set the art aside.

For no other reason than that the effort and reward had become extremely disproportionate.

This was very similar to the Great Parting's White Brilliance; Li Ximing had calculated that an ordinary cultivator could spend a lifetime without fully mastering the Li-Light, yet the divine ability of the Great Parting Scripture could greatly accelerate the process. The Sun's Resonant Parting Art was much the same. It came from the Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun and was complementary to that cultivation method; only with the divine ability of the Great Parting Scripture could one truly cultivate its essence!

This was why the Sun's Resonant Parting Art bore the name of the sun and was listed as a complementary technique to the Li Fire cultivation method; the Great Parting Scripture was also known as the Art of Gazing Upon and Describing the Sun, which perfectly aligned with the meaning of Supreme Yang Responding-to-Li.

Li Jiangqian had put a great deal of effort into this art during his Foundation Establishment Realm, and now that he finally had some free time, he naturally seized the opportunity to advance his skill and work toward complete mastery, not slacking in the slightest. He only relaxed his hands and opened his eyes, the leaping glow of Li Fire within them gradually fading, when his clan sister landed on the mountain.

"Are your wounds healed?"

"They are."

Li Que'wan said with a small smile, "But I've just come out of seclusion. Why is the island so lively? It seems like some great celebration is happening."

"It's the marriage alliance with the Chen Clan!"

Li Jiangqian stood up, a somewhat distant and uncertain look in his eyes as he said,

"You've come at the perfect time. This is something I need to discuss with you."

He clasped his hands behind his back and paced, frowning.

"Back then, to solve the urgent crisis on the lake, I promised Chen Yin a marriage for Yusui. Later, seeing that the man from the Chen Clan was a capable person, I made the decision and agreed to it. The Chen Clan was overjoyed, and that old man has personally come to the lake estate to deliver gifts."

Li Que'wan still remembered Li Jiangqian's recent speculation that Chen Yin might be cooperating with the Xiao Clan, and her expression grew solemn.

"This means..."

The young man said, "Never mind the various spiritual resources; they were extremely generous. By my rough estimate, the Chen Clan likely put forth about twenty percent of their entire family fortune... Regarding this... I will not treat Yusui unfairly. Whatever the Chen Clan has given, I will have her take with her as part of her dowry."

Twenty percent of a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan's fortune! It was an absolutely terrifying figure, something that would never happen unless they were intentionally trying to curry favor. To call it a magnificent dowry would be a gross understatement. Yet his tone was nonchalant as if he did not care, and he frowned as he spoke.

"What's important is at the Purple Mansion level... Chen Yin, in the name of the Chen Clan... sent over a Purple Mansion-grade spiritual item."

He turned over his palm, revealing a stone box. Inside lay a purple object that pulsed like a heart, emitting a faint light. Li Que'wan's brow twitched.

"An Upper Shaman item? What a lavish gift!"

"Indeed."

Li Jiangqian said, "This is an Upper Shaman's Purple Baleful Heart, which is quite rare. Our clan is currently in short supply of spiritual items, and this will be useful if we need to trade with the Xiukui in the future."

He did not elaborate, continuing, "And that's not all. Chen Wenyao sent over a spiritual resource, a portion of Noble Feather Respite Water... and this venerable Daoist Master Chen also sent our clan a very powerful secret method, in his own name."

Now even Li Que'wan frowned. While Li Yusui's status was certainly respected, both were Purple Mansion clans; a single portion of a spiritual resource was more than enough to show respect. This attitude was far too obsequious. She then asked:

"Brother, did you accept it all?"

The joy on Li Jiangqian's face was not deep, mingled instead with a measure of doubt.

"I wasn't going to accept everything, but when he placed that secret method in my hands, I changed my mind... After weighing the matter repeatedly, I ultimately accepted it."

He turned his hand over, revealing a jade slip as green as emerald, and passed it to the young woman before him.

"Read it," he said gravely.

Li Que'wan focused her mind and touched the slip. A vast collection of text and diagrams flooded into her consciousness, intricate, complex, and exceedingly obscure—it seemed to have reached a point where an ordinary jade slip would struggle to contain it all!

The Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation.

Even with her Dao-Profundity and experience, Li Que'wan had to focus for the time it took half an incense stick to burn, only then slowly reigning in the shock within her spiritual sense. The emotion in her eyes grew complex.

"What a powerful method!"

Li Jiangqian nodded gravely.

The art was both extremely profound and yet elegantly simple. It was a method of seeking the Dao through Pit Water, using various techniques, spiritual items, and even phenomena to advance one's cultivation. Though its requirements were demanding, it could achieve the goal of lowering the difficulty of a breakthrough.

'Direct, yet powerful. This alone... is enough to be astonishing.'

Secret methods that could help a person achieve a breakthrough were exceedingly rare in this world; even the efficacy of medicinal pills was limited. The Li Clan was already considered extremely powerful among Purple Mansion Immortal Clans, yet to this day they possessed no secret art that could definitively facilitate a breakthrough!

'Although consuming a Purple Mansion-grade spiritual item to achieve a breakthrough is a widely known trick, it is far less specific and targeted than this secret method.'

What surprised the two Purple Mansion cultivators even more was that it explained in detail how to cast and coordinate various Pit Water divine abilities. These divine abilities were:

Darkening Clouds, Man on Creek, Grieving River Departure, Position Follows Peril, Entering the Pit's Abyss, and Jing Dragon King.

Six divine abilities in total.

The secret method was written with great clarity; there was no hierarchy among them, nor any sense that they were complementary or substitutable for one another. They were simply six distinct divine abilities!

Li Que'wan's gaze was grave. She looked at Li Jiangqian, and the young man said grimly,

"Judging from the divine abilities, one of 'Position Follows Peril' or 'Entering the Pit's Abyss' must be what is commonly called 'Holding the Ridge' in Jiangnan. The principles of each one are profound, fitting, and clearly distinct from the others."

Li Que'wan reacted quickly. Adding this to the gains their clan had once made at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, she came to a swift realization and whispered,

"The Vast Ocean does not belong to the Pit; it is the external manifestation of an anomaly in the Pit's position."

"Exactly!"

Li Jiangqian had obviously considered this point as well, but unlike Li Que'wan, he was thinking not only of the weight of this secret itself but also of the message this secret method conveyed.

"It's hard to say if Chen Yin has other secret methods, but when he attempted to use the Vast Ocean to step past the Purple Mystery, he was most likely using this very technique. Our previous speculations were not unfounded."

He said quietly, "This art is ancient and weathered; not only does it look old, but it also has a kind of simplicity that cuts right to the heart of the matter, leaving most of the room for expression to the caster's Dao-Profundity... Since it can be used to break through to the fourth divine ability, could it be used as a fundamental method for seeking the Dao with a fifth?"

"Something this profound is definitely not something Chen Yin could have obtained on his own, much less delivered so openly into our hands."

"This is likely him stating his position, or perhaps..."

His gaze gradually changed.

"It is the Xiao Clan stating their position. The secret method of a submerged flood dragon seeking transformation... Senior Xiao has made it clear he is interested in the Pit's position—and not only that, he will not back down in the face of the Golden Oneness!"

Li Que'wan's expression was complex and tinged with worry.

"In other words, he helped Chen Yin become a Great Daoist Master and pushed the Chen Clan to simultaneously draw closer to our family while also making it clear that he stands behind them. This is likely a way to bind multiple parties together, so that at the critical moment... we will all stand behind him."

Li Jiangqian sighed.

"That is precisely why I accepted the Chen Clan's generous gifts..."

Li Que'wan said gravely, "Brother, this is no small matter. You must ask the two elders!"

The connection between the Xiao and Li clans was not strong these days, but in earlier years, the lake estate had often relied on their help; even Li Yuanjiao's branch carried half Xiao blood... Once this matter was brought into the open, it would likely be difficult to manage. How could Li Jiangqian not know this? He whispered:

"The two elders are both in seclusion and should not be disturbed. I'm telling you this first not just to ask your opinion, but also to prepare you—you are the one who must go to the Golden Feather Sect, so you need to be aware of the situation to handle them!"

So he was also concerned about the trip to the Golden Feather Sect. Li Que'wan immediately understood her brother's meaning and felt a headache coming on.

"You're right. If the Golden Feather Sect says something to warn or admonish us, that would be troublesome enough."

"No..."

But the young man before her shook his head grimly, looking at her with great seriousness.

"I only want you to know about this matter so you can recognize any verbal traps they might lay... but when you get to the Golden Feather Sect, you must not allow yourself to be wronged! At least for now, it is their turn to worry about Father and appease us, not the other way around!"

Li Que'wan was taken aback and raised her eyebrows. The crimson-robed young man's golden eyes glinted, filled with a cold light as he gave a low, chilly laugh.

"The more of a strategist someone is... the more they fear you'll simply smash their board to pieces. If you act cautiously, they'll know exactly how to handle you. We have nothing left to lose. If the Bright Yang path fails, it's only a life... what difference does it make who comes to take it!"

A decisive look appeared in Li Que'wan's eyes. Unsurprised, she smiled gently.

"Don't worry, Brother."

Li Jiangqian sighed softly. He knew his sister had always been gentle on the outside but unyielding within, and he was not usually one to worry. But the Golden Feather Sect was powerful, and for her to be cultivating the Whole Pill art they most abhorred, deep within their territory, inevitably filled him with concern, making him uncharacteristically verbose. Now, he only said:

"I wish I were the one going."
