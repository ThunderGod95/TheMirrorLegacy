# Chapter 1036: The General of Shu

The Guyan Great Desert.

A torrential downpour turned the world into a quagmire. On a hidden path, a convoy of carriages raced through the mud. Cries of mourning filled the air, and within one carriage rested a black lacquered coffin, surrounded by cultivators with bowed, weeping heads. The scene was one of grim solemnity. At the head of the procession, a man in white robes seemed utterly lost, his spirit adrift.

He only snapped back to reality when a cultivator approached him.

"Where are we?" he asked, his gaze distant.

The man offered a reassuring reply.

"Rest easy, Clan Head. The lands are in chaos, swarming with refugees. But our convoy is swift. We will cross the desert in less than a day."

Zhuang Pingye nodded numbly, his expression vacant.

The turmoil in the Wu State had been brewing for some time. The Zhuang family had heard the rumors but never considered leaving. This was the heartland of the Golden Feather Sect! How could the chaos of the world possibly reach this deep into their territory? How could it sweep across the entire desert? Besides, their own Old Master, Zhuang Cheng, was out on the frontier, helping the Golden Feather Sect quell the unrest. What could possibly go wrong?

He had been traveling south while his wife, Li Xinghan, was in seclusion. Hiding his identity, he had been indulging himself at a familiar marketplace when the news struck him like a thunderbolt: an army had invaded the desert. At the same time, a message arrived that his father was gravely ill. In that instant, all else was forgotten. He had raced home in a panic.

When he arrived, Zhuang Cheng was lying on his deathbed. The old Daoist, a rogue cultivator who had made his name in the desert with his talisman swords, had made few major mistakes in a life full of minor ones. In his later years, he had guided the Zhuang family to its zenith. But the war had left him mortally wounded, and he had exhausted the last of his strength just to make it home.

Ignoring his son, Zhuang Cheng’s first act was to summon Li Xinghan from her seclusion. Together, they assessed the dire situation. Realizing the gravity of it all, the Old Master didn’t even wait for a reply from Moongaze Lake. He made the last, and wisest, decision of his life.

‘Flee… Flee now!’

The Zhuang clan was a major power in the desert, a Foundation Establishment Realm family with a long and storied history. They had even managed to curry favor with Moongaze Lake, making them an untouchable force in their Prefecture. Yet now, they abandoned everything. They didn’t even dare to fly. Instead, they loaded their clan members and spiritual treasures onto a dozen carriages and stole out of the city under the cover of night, heading east.

Old Master Zhuang Cheng was not yet dead, but he feared the celestial phenomena his death would cause might attract unwanted attention. He had them seal him within the coffin to await his end while the others fled without stopping.

Even now, a chilling cold gripped Zhuang Pingye’s limbs. He entered the carriage to find his wife still beside the coffin, channeling her dharma power into it.

"Shouldn't you rest for a while?" he asked, his voice trembling with concern.

Li Xinghan shook her head.

Her features had matured, and her years managing the household had given her a sharp, capable air. But at this moment, her mind was troubled.

‘I never thought the Golden Feather Sect’s transition would be so violent… a full-blown slaughter. It completely upended our family’s calculations…’

The Zhuang family had been largely ignorant of the changes sweeping through the Wu State, but Li Xinghan had her own sources. She knew the Golden Feather Sect was likely to be absorbed into the new dynasty. Since the Zhuang family was sworn to the Golden Feather Sect, Moongaze Lake had refrained from interfering. But no one had expected the army from the west to unleash such unrestrained carnage, butchering their way across the land.

She sighed inwardly, looking at her disheveled husband in silence.

She wasn’t blind to his affairs. She knew that when Zhuang Pingye had come to Moongaze Lake, it hadn’t been for love at first sight. Whether he was keeping a mistress or simply seeking pleasure, he was at least smart enough to be discreet and spare her any public humiliation. For years, they had maintained a relationship of mutual, if distant, respect.

It had bothered her at first, but she had grown accustomed to it. Between managing clan affairs and her own sword practice, she had little time to spare. Besides, trying to change a man’s nature would likely have caused nothing but chaos and resentment.

‘My first love is the sword,’ she thought. ‘I have no right to demand he love me most of all.’

But now, their world had been turned upside down. Perhaps realizing that his future depended entirely on the mercy of his wife’s family, Zhuang Pingye’s voice was exceptionally gentle. The proud composure that had always defined him was gone, replaced by a nervous fear that she might decide to settle old scores.

This newfound vulnerability stirred a flicker of pity in Li Xinghan. The image of the Old Master clutching her hand, his eyes streaming with tears as he begged her to protect his family, was still vivid in her mind.

"You don't have to be afraid," she said, waving a hand dismissively. "The Old Master was able to drag his wounded body all the way back from the front lines. He must have used a divine ability to do so. The Golden Oneness Upper Sect couldn't possibly be unaware of this. They are likely bound by some agreement that prevents them from intervening directly, but they are surely offering support from the shadows."

Zhuang Pingye was a sharp man; he understood immediately. A wave of relief washed over him, though his eyes remained fixed on her. Li Xinghan, however, was gazing out the window. Her expression shifted as she saw the distant signs of a great battle.

"We just passed Guyan Temple!"

"What?" Zhuang Pingye was horrified. "You mean… an army from the west must have taken a shortcut to get here ahead of us."

"Either they mean to trap the desert's cultivators and prevent them from fleeing to the lake," Li Xinghan deduced, "or they're trying to stop the lake from taking advantage of the chaos to seize the desert for themselves!" She nodded. 

"My guess is they fear word has already reached the lake. They want to launch a surprise attack and try to capture the Western Mountains!"

The husband and wife sat in silence as the rain grew heavier, drowning out the sound of the horses' hooves. Their path remained strangely clear, almost unnaturally so. Then, just as suddenly as it began, the storm seemed to halt. A figure landed soundlessly before their carriage.

A powerful voice boomed,

"Subordinate Ding Weizeng, acting under the orders of King Wei, has come to escort you, my lady!"

‘King Wei…’

Li Xinghan was slightly surprised, but she recognized Ding Weizeng. Zhuang Pingye saw her nod, and the tension drained from his body. He let out a long sigh, his eyes shifting uncertainly toward his wife.

"We are grateful, Guest Retainer Ding," Li Xinghan said politely.

The carriage curtain was lifted, letting in a spray of cold rain. Zhuang Pingye put on a smile and greeted the Guest Retainer before quickly placing his hands on the coffin. He knocked gently. There was no response, only a silent, profound cold.

Li Xinghan turned away, shedding a single tear for the old man. As Zhuang Pingye bowed to Ding Weizeng, his mind went blank. His left hand rested on the coffin, trembling slightly. An emptiness hollowed out his chest. His father, the Old Master who had lived a life of prestige, had passed away somewhere along this desperate journey, dying silently in his coffin, consumed by worry.

---

At Guyan Temple, the downpour was relentless. Gray-black mud washed over the collapsed city walls, revealing fragments of ancient, broken stone. Thunder rolled across the heavens, shaking the very foundations of the earth.

On one side of the desert, ranks of silver-armored soldiers stood in perfect formation. Azure banners, emblazoned with a golden 【Shu】 character, snapped in the wind. Above them, celestial chariots with wheels thirty feet high stood arrayed amongst the clouds, an imposing and majestic sight.

On the other side, colorful clouds swirled, but the forces were far sparser. Li Zhouwei stood within the clouds, dressed in a simple black robe with gold-trimmed sleeves, a Campaign Cloak draped over his shoulders. Beside him, a bronze-skinned giant held a great, purple-hued banner embroidered with a qilin, standing firm within the roiling Heavenly Light.

At the foot of a mountain, several cultivators huddled together in the torrential rain, supporting one another, a picture of misery.

Guyan Temple had been built upon the ancient city walls. Its strategic location had earned it the favor of the Li clan, and it had long been their loyal vassal. Though its importance had waned after the walls fell, it remained a vital bridgehead to the desert. The few Guyan Temple cultivators who remained were all natives of the western shore. Now, supported by the Li clan’s men, they wept in each other's arms.

‘Great Shu…’

The azure banners were a clear declaration. The Xiao-Wu, who had seized their mandate from the state of Chu, had been utterly crushed, their last vestiges of power stamped out. The Shu army still radiated a thick, bloody killing intent, a testament to the brutal path they had carved to get here.

‘This faction has a far more potent thirst for blood,’ Li Zhouwei mused.

His presence in the sky, however, seemed to agitate the soldiers standing in the blood-soaked mud below. A flicker of light rippled through their ranks, and a figure emerged, riding the wind to lead a detachment forward.

The man came to a halt in the sky, revealing himself. He stopped at a respectful distance and clasped his hands in a formal salute. "This humble one is Ni Hongyan of the Ni clan, Founding Earl of the Qi Pavilion of Great Shu and Military Commissioner of the Desert Pacification Army. I greet you, Your Excellency!"

‘Daoist Master Ni Hongyan…’

Li Zhouwei had heard of him. The Ni clan had long been the Sword Gate’s most trusted aides, managing the lands of Shu on their behalf. This Daoist Master Hongyan had achieved his divine ability long ago and had always been a staunch supporter of the Supreme Yang Dao. But now, with the changing tides of power, he had clearly thrown his lot in with the Shu kingdom and received a significant post for his troubles—even if he was stationed out here in Guyan.

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. "Minghuang, King Wei of the Great Song."

A hint of unease crossed Daoist Master Hongyan’s face. He forced a smile. "So it is King Wei. For Your Majesty to cross the mountains and bring your forces here… might there be some urgent matter to discuss?"

The young man chuckled, his hands clasped behind his back. "The people in that temple belong to my Moongaze Lake. And yet you say it is I who has brought forces here?"

Daoist Master Hongyan took a half-step back. He opened his mouth to speak, but the proximity to Li Zhouwei made him wary. He lowered his voice. "Allow me to report to the Grand General."

Before he could turn, another man shot through the air, his silver armor glinting magnificently. He stopped beside Hongyan, his brow furrowed.

"Military Commissioner, why do you hesitate?"

Li Zhouwei watched him with a cold gaze. The man returned the stare without flinching, his eyes locking directly onto Li Zhouwei’s.

"And who might this be?" he demanded.

The question put Daoist Master Hongyan in an awkward position. He stepped forward again, ignoring the newcomer and addressing Li Zhouwei in a placating tone.

"King Wei… this is Lord Li Muyan, a Meritorious Official of the Black Tortoise Spiritual Wing."

Li Zhouwei remained impassive, not deigning to give Li Muyan a second glance. The man hadn't possessed a divine ability for long. Some unknown boon must have been granted to him, giving him a deceptively impressive aura that hinted at some hidden power.

What truly drew Li Zhouwei’s attention was the glittering silver chariot in the distance. There had to be someone else there.

‘I wonder… is it the Shu Emperor, or some other highness?’

There was still no news from the Golden Feather Sect. If things had gone as expected, they should have joined forces with Mount Changhuai. One was of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, the other from the Changhuai Immortal Mountain—their combined strength would be terrifying.

Behind him, Li Zhouda’s expression turned icy with surprise.

‘The Tanshan Li Clan…’

Li Muyan, of course, knew exactly who Li Zhouwei was. He simply put on a cold face and said dismissively,

"King Wei? I am acting on the Grand General's orders to conquer the Western Mountains. I know of no King Wei."

At these words, Li Zhouwei’s eyebrows shot up, and his golden eyes swept over the man.

The Western Mountains were a range devoid of spiritual energy that served as a natural border. Their peaks were so treacherous and high that even cultivators of lower realms could not cross them. They were easy to defend and hard to attack; a single powerful cultivator with a defensive array was all that was needed to hold them. If they fell into enemy hands, that enemy would hold the high ground, creating an insurmountable threat that would rob Moongaze Lake of all peace.

Whether Shu was truly determined to take the Western Mountains was debatable, but Moongaze Lake absolutely could not afford to lose them.

Daoist Master Hongyan’s face fell, and he sighed internally.

‘He really is spoiling for a fight…’

But since Li Muyan had spoken, there was nothing more for him to say. Hongyan silently took a step back, positioning himself behind Li Muyan.

The golden-eyed young man before them, however, let out a cold laugh. His words shot out, forcing Li Muyan's retort back down his throat.

"Li Muyan… the Tanshan Li Clan may not recognize a King of Wei, but do you recognize an Emperor of Wei?"

Li Muyan had not expected such a response. His expression darkened.

"What is this nonsense! My Tanshan Li Clan hails from Jiangnan! We have no connection whatsoever to the north! What talk is this of a Wei Emperor?" he snarled.

But in the blink of an eye, the young man vanished.

Daoist Master Hongyan’s face contorted in alarm as a brilliant light instantly coalesced around him. He felt a searing Heavenly Light wash over him. Li Zhouwei reappeared in mid-air, his hand thrust forward, clenching a point of golden light. As he swung, the light extended like liquid mercury, forming a crescent-bladed halberd. The weapon’s chilling edge leaped forth like a deadly stinger.

His voice boomed like thunder, cold and majestic.

"Your pathetic lies betray you!"

Li Muyan gritted his teeth. His silver armor blazed as his divine abilities converged. A storm of lightning instantly gathered from the heavens, surging into his armor. A golden radiance erupted from between his brows, casting a brilliant sheen.

Li Zhouwei’s halberd descended like a mountain, yet it moved with an ethereal grace. It found a gap in the thunder and golden light, stabbing straight down. A flicker of contempt crossed Li Zhouwei’s face.

_BOOM!_

A torrent of golden lightning erupted, but a brownish-green umbrella suddenly appeared, spinning open. It unfurled a canopy of earthen brown, completely and utterly smothering the golden light.

The Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, using Wu Earth to counter lightning.

His lightning was effortlessly blocked, but the deadly point of the halberd could not be ignored. Li Muyan’s mouth opened in a sharp cry. "Hah!"

In an instant, a ripple of silver lightning burst from his body, exploding into a web of chains that coiled around the halberd, bringing its advance to a sudden halt.

At the same time, Daoist Master Hongyan unleashed his own Spiritual Artifact. A hazy, churning flame snaked up his arm and coalesced into a fiery spear, which he immediately launched at Li Zhouwei’s face.

Seeing this, Li Muyan allowed himself a cold smirk. But to his shock, the halberd, entangled in lightning, gave a slight twist. A brilliant golden light exploded outwards, stunning him for a fraction of a second and nearly allowing the Grand Ascension to break free.

Li Muyan immediately grew cautious.

‘Daoist Master Hongyan has cultivated two divine abilities to perfection over many years. And while I may be newly ascended, I have the blessing of the Martial Inquiry’s light, which makes me formidable. Still, this man is favored by destiny; I must be careful.’

He poured more of his dharma power and divine ability into the chains, desperately trying to hold the halberd in place. But Li Zhouwei held the weapon with one hand, his posture as relaxed as if he were on a leisurely stroll. Without giving his two opponents so much as a glance, he raised his other hand. Ten streaks of violet-white lightning crashed down from the sky, all striking the flame spear.

_BOOM!_

Billowing black smoke rose as a purple-gold lightning mace materialized within the vortex of dark clouds above. Its golden sheen was so brilliant it made Li Muyan’s expression change.

‘What a fine treasure… to think it was wasted in the hands of Bright Yang! But this is not enough… That man Qing is watching from the back. I need to force out more of his true power!’

He grit his teeth and sneered, "You dare mention the Wei Emperor? You ignorant whelp. How dare you hope that my Tanshan clan shares a lineage with you Wei fiends!"

The words hit like a thunderclap, but the first to react was Daoist Master Hongyan. He gasped, his heart sinking.

‘He’ll say anything… Does he truly have that much faith in Qing?’

This remark finally made Li Zhouwei focus his full attention on Li Muyan’s face. An expression of cold disgust mixed with anger appeared.

"I will grant you your wish."

In a single thought, the golden-eyed young man’s brows furrowed. An overwhelming, irresistible force shattered the divine ability, sending silver fragments flying. Li Muyan staggered forward as his power buckled. A muffled explosion echoed in his ears.

_CLANG!_

For a terrifying second, his vision blurred. Golden light flashed before his eyes, and a deafening buzz filled his ears. The entire world fractured into a kaleidoscope of blue, white, purple, and yellow shards. There was only noise, and the cold, wet sensation of something trickling from his nose.

‘…’

His consciousness plunged into an abyss for a moment before clawing its way back from the depths. He snapped back to clarity with a jolt of pure terror. The world swam back into focus.

But the roiling thunderclouds, Daoist Master Hongyan—everything was gone. Above him was a Celestial Gate, as bright as a mountain peak. All he could see in every direction was an endless expanse of black and gold, pierced by a single point of light.

It was the ice-cold face of Li Zhouwei.

The young man seemed both infinitely distant and terrifyingly close.

In that same instant, he realized what the endless darkness enveloping him was. It wasn't a divine ability or a spiritual artifact, not an array or a spectral veil. It was a dense, unending torrent of dark golden light.

Emperor Qi's Light.

The flood of this divine ability poured down on him, leaving him as helpless as a lone boat in a raging sea, struggling and unable to move. From the sky above, a massive, mountain-like halberd slowly descended, radiating a terrifying pressure that stole his breath.

‘The Radiant Sun King's Halberd!’

Li Muyan could no longer afford to care about his dignity. His eyes widened in horror.

"Grand General!"

_BOOM!_

The wind and rain outside suddenly ceased. A stream of gray energy shot down from the sky like a bolt of lightning, transforming into a massive hand. It had clearly been gathering power for some time. It brutally swiped aside the outer layer of Emperor Qi's Light and clamped down hard.

A cold shout echoed from the sky.

"Li Zhouwei!"

_DONG!!_

The Radiant Sun King's Halberd struck something seemingly indestructible. A cloud of golden dust exploded from its blade, raining down like glittering powder. A gray pearl shot out, tumbling awkwardly through the air. Unable to control its trajectory, it plummeted like a meteor and slammed into the ground with a deafening crash.

A direct hit from the halberd would have left Li Muyan hovering between life and death; even survival would have meant a decade of secluded healing. Now, having been saved, he was still drenched in a cold sweat. Seizing the moment when Emperor Qi's Light was shattered, he shed the remaining streams of light from his body and prepared to flee.

But the black-robed young man had already vanished.

The gray energy in the sky solidified, revealing a youth with refined features and a simple, unadorned Daoist robe. His face was exceptionally grim. One of his hands was hidden behind his back, clearly in pain, while the other made a grasping motion in the air.

_CLANG!_

A metallic ringing vibrated through everyone's ears. The western army stumbled in disarray. A golden bracelet flashed in the air for an instant before disappearing again.

But in that same instant, the bright blade of a halberd appeared reflected in the pupils of Li Muyan on the opposite side. He desperately drew all his divine abilities into his body, simultaneously activating his True Qi and expelling a stream of white vapor from his nose.

"Bestow!"

But the enemy's Spiritual Artifact was simply too fast!

_BANG!_

The gray pearl had only just hit the ground. Caught completely off guard, Li Muyan took the full force of the halberd strike. Before his white vapor could even fully form, it was violently dispersed. Like a falling star, he was blasted from the sky and crashed into the western battle formation. An explosion of lightning and fire erupted. The earth cracked, the mountains shook, and the rain stopped completely.
The youth who had emerged from the gray energy looked utterly livid. He stared coldly at Li Zhouwei and took a step forward, drawing upon the gray energy until it loomed like a mountain.

The two faced off in the sky for a tense moment. The silver-armored general finally climbed out from a pile of bodies, coughing violently and spitting up black blood that pulsed with purple flames. He had barely found his footing when his face contorted in horror.

Almost simultaneously, the youth confronting Li Zhouwei showed a look of shocked fury. He erupted. "King Wei, what incredible nerve!"

_CLANG!_

The reply came not from Li Zhouwei, but from a heaven-shaking metallic sound. Something abruptly pierced through the Great Void right in front of Li Muyan.

It was a golden spear, ten feet long, utterly smooth and unadorned.
The Descending Radiance Equal Edge!

This was an item Li Zhouwei had obtained from a grotto-heaven. He had never had a chance to use it. It was forged from 'Wandering Metal,' an element that existed outside of cause and effect, making it free and untraceable, impossible to detect or predict.

_Pfft!_

The golden spear, having waited for the perfect moment, flashed like lightning. It pierced straight through Li Muyan’s chest and vanished, drawing a muffled grunt. He stumbled back several steps, spitting up more blood. The gray energy in the sky roared, incandescent with rage.

"Li Zhouwei!"

The spear had not struck him, but the humiliation was greater than any physical blow. It had pierced straight through his pride. Qing Jifang, a noble scion of an immortal sect, a man who considered himself superior to almost anyone he met, had never suffered such a loss of face.

He exploded in a furious rage, and the gray energy blotted out the sky. Qing Jifang sneered. "Fine… A fine King Wei… You dare show such disrespect to my Changhuai Dao Lineage? We'll see who will be left with no face at the end of this!"

The gray pearl leaped from the ground and flew into his hand. The churning gray energy boiled over, surging around Li Zhouwei's body. But Li Zhouwei's expression was strange. He was staring intently at the hand Qing Jifang kept hidden behind his back.

‘As expected of the son of a Great Daoist Master of Changhuai. To take a Splitting Light strike from the Radiant Sun King's Halberd head-on with his physical body… Even with his powerful physique, superior spell arts, and time to prepare… he must have lost at least four fingers. And he hasn't even made a sound!’

Seeing Li Zhouwei staring at his hidden hand, Qing Jifang understood instantly. It was the ultimate insult, adding fuel to the fire. His four fingers were hanging on by mere threads of flesh, and the potent Bright Yang divine ability was still spreading through the wounds. He didn't dare bring his hand out. He gritted his teeth in fury.

‘Li Muyan and Ni Hongyan… one got carried away by his own act and underestimated the enemy, the other was a useless coward, stunned like a wooden chicken… He was completely dazed by a single Spiritual Treasure! If even one of them had been a competent Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, why would I have needed to block that halberd myself!’

Qing Jifang’s techniques were profound, his background noble, his treasures numerous. In a proper fight, there was no way such a clumsy Spiritual Artifact could have ever touched him! He was confident he had a hundred ways to wound Li Zhouwei right here and now, yet he was the one who had to suffer such a humiliating blow.

‘Go ahead and laugh, Li Zhouwei… When you suffer your defeat in the north, we'll see who in Moongaze Lake is left smiling!’
