# Chapter 1200 Guardian of the Vast Hall

‘Chi Buzi.’

Yuanshang was utterly shaken. A thousand thoughts raced through his mind before the face of a youth from long ago finally surfaced.

‘Him?’

Yet looking at the person before him now, despite having spoken only a few sentences, Yuanshang felt it was impossible for this to be Chi Buzi—that man would try to scheme against you three times with a single sentence. Even when feigning closeness, such words would never leave his lips!

Dangjiang saw the disbelief in his eyes and was about to speak, but he met Shaohui's warning, dissatisfied gaze. The words caught in his throat, and he said sheepishly,

"Senior, you've misunderstood. By a twist of fate, I have borrowed his eyes to see the world…"

But the old man was sharp.

‘Borrowed his eyes… which means Chi Buzi must have received guidance from the Supreme Yin…’

When Chi Buzi rose to fame, Yuanshang had already begun a reclusive life among the islands, combining his study of the Supreme Yin Dao in preparation to seek the Purple Mystery. He was not actually familiar with the man; his most profound impression came from an encounter on Splitreed Island.

The junior had only been at the Foundation Establishment Realm… yet his ruthlessness was already apparent. Yuanshang had gone to Splitreed Island to meet Wen Qingzhou just as a Daoist Master from the Azure Pond Sect was leaving. He was listening to two Daoist Masters of the Purple Smoke Gate lamenting the Azure Pond's affairs when Yuanjing remarked,

"Yuanwu is arrogant and disliked by his peers, yet he possesses the fortune to carry on a Dao lineage. His disciple and his son both have the makings of Dao Masters and are undeniably remarkable talents. In contrast, our fellow Daoists Si and Ning have failed to produce a single worthy successor from their followers."

Wen Qingzhou, already quite renowned at the time, remained noncommittal and said,

"The Si Family has a continuous line of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, but they suffer from many man-made calamities, hence their lineage is thin. The Ning Clan rose from humble beginnings, and their main branch is in disarray, resulting in a fractured and impure line. These are signs of a shallow destiny. Meanwhile, Yuanxiu is proud and merciless, indifferent even to his own grand-disciples, while Yuansu is capricious, scorning his superiors and disdaining his subordinates. These are the seeds of a broken lineage; they cannot compare to Yuanwu."

Yuanshang, reading a scroll nearby, smiled and asked,

"What of Chi Wei?"

For several generations, the Chi family had not taken masters, instead cultivating within the sect as a clan. Chi Wei should have received a 'Yuan' generation name but chose not to use it, so he was always addressed directly. Unexpectedly, Wen Qingzhou had replied in a soft voice,

"That Chi Buzi is as merciless as Yuanxiu and as capricious as Yuansu, yet he is free of their arrogance and constraints. His mind is a labyrinth of schemes. Were he not born into the Pristine Pool, he would surely be a devil."

From that day on, Yuanshang paid close attention. Subsequent events left him speechless time and again, and he once lamented to his disciple, Fuxuan,

"Wen Qingzhou was right—staying in the Pristine Pool has truly held him back from becoming a demon lord!"

Could such a man truly be a pawn of the Supreme Yin?

‘How could it be impossible?!’

A chill ran down Yuanshang's spine.

‘Wasn't he the one who produced the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch all those years ago?’

Now it was clear. There was no immortal's cave, no ancestral legacy—it was obvious that Chi Buzi had obtained the Supreme Yin artifact from his backer and secretly passed it to his own people!

‘What nonsense about needing the Xi clan's bloodline… what a farce about using a spiritual item as collateral. Not a single word from that junior's mouth was true! This whole grand spectacle was staged for the sole purpose of delivering that spiritual item!’

‘I thought at the time that perhaps Pristine Water was behind him, that the item was sent to further probe the Supreme Yin… I never imagined… never imagined… that there was someone else pulling the strings!’

With this single point illuminated, everything clicked into place in Yuanshang’s mind, and a sudden, stunning realization dawned on him.

‘So that's how it is… As long as one reaches the threshold of the Woven Jade Dao… one can communicate with the Hall of Final Vastness and be reborn there through some wondrous means. To the great figures in the outside world, I may have perished, but in truth, I've already shed my shell like a golden cicada…’

‘Therefore… that spiritual item given to Fuxuan, while ostensibly another test from the higher powers, was in fact meant to ensure he reached that very threshold, allowing him to ascend to the Hall of Final Vastness just as I have—it was genuinely to help him succeed!’

‘Harm, loss, lack, and concealment are the rites of the Supreme Yin; through them, my Dao is nourished. This is the true method of the Supreme Yin!’

In an instant, the old man had formed a complete theory. A wave of warmth surged through him, and he was so moved he nearly wept.

‘My Lord has never abandoned us… My disciple and I still have a chance to meet again!’

His eyes reddened for a moment. Shaohui, however, was at a loss. It mattered little whether the man before her was truly of the Woven Jade Dao; anyone who reached this place was one of their own, and there was nothing to hide. She was simply worried whether it was their place to speak of Chi Buzi, fearing they might complicate matters and earn Dangjiang a reputation as a gossip…

Dangjiang was also lost in thought. He had wanted to ask for news of Chi Buzi, but after Shaohui's glare, he no longer dared. Shaohui sighed and said,

"In that case… Fellow Daoist, please follow me to the Supreme Yin Manor!"

This was more than Yuanshang could have hoped for. Overjoyed, he stepped forward with her. Seeing this, Dangjiang immediately lowered his head and followed, pleading in a low voice,

"I know a bit about him… Let me come see the Immortal General as well. It's better than the immortal maiden going alone…"

The trio rode the winds for a time, crossing the vast expanse of soaring clouds and passing by layer upon layer of celestial palaces before soon arriving at the innermost manor. The scenery here was such that even Dangjiang, who had visited several times, could not help but gaze around in wonder, to say nothing of Yuanshang.

His emotions had completely reversed. Beyond the immense relief, a tide of questions now flooded his mind.

‘The Hall of Final Vastness is in ruins, yet this place is as majestic as a celestial palace. It must be either a subordinate domain or a branch… The complexities here are far beyond my imagination.’

He walked for a short while and soon arrived at the base of a high platform of white jade, where a silvery-white bridge hung suspended over a lake. The immortal maiden in tea-white robes went forward to inquire with the guards before the hall, who informed her,

"My Lady has arrived at a perfect time. The Immortal General just saw off a Divine Core cultivator and is now on the terrace."

So they ascended the numerous jade steps, climbing ever upward until they beheld a magnificent, cold palace. The main seat was high and elegant. Shaohui paid her respects and announced,

"Reporting to my Lord, someone has arrived from the lower realm, claiming to be from the Hall of Final Vastness!"

Yuanshang followed with a bow, his heart pounding with anxiety. A brief silence fell over the grand hall, and then a voice tinged with surprise spoke,

"The Hall of Final Vastness has opened? Which member of the Woven Jade Dao still remains?"

The moment this person spoke, their words were utterly different from Shaohui's; they were clearly aware of the hall's existence. Yuanshang immediately bowed again. Hearing a rustling from above, the voice grew stern and continued,

"The Supreme Yin has felt no stirrings—the Hall of Final Vastness has not manifested. From where, then, has a member of the Woven Jade Dao come? Which branch of the Azure Profoundity does this cultivator belong to?"

Hearing this, Yuanshang could no longer remain silent. His heart tightened as he bowed and said,

"This junior follows the Dao-path of Gonghua Heaven, a reflection of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition…"

"Gonghua?"

The figure rose and descended from above with steady steps, seemingly lost in deep thought. Dangjiang's talkative habit flared up again. He shuffled forward and said respectfully,

"Reporting to my Lord, it is the Daoist tradition of 'Pristine Water.' The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was founded by his master. According to him, he is now a successor of Gonghua!"

Zhengao asked,

"Is it the Changjing Daoist tradition? I was in seclusion in the heavens at that time and did not descend to the mortal realm, so I am not entirely clear on the origins of the Supreme Yang…"

"It is!"

Hearing those two familiar words, Yuanshang secretly let out a breath of relief, lowering his eyes in acknowledgement. The person above, though still surprised and clearly puzzled, stood up out of courtesy and said,

"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist! Now that you have achieved the Woven Jade Dao, you are a personage of the heavens!"

Yuanshang, devoid of any divine ability, felt his confidence waver. He could tell the other party's words were insincere and had a foreboding premonition. Sure enough, the person continued,

"The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition does not necessarily contain the Great Dao of Woven Jade—when did you achieve the Dao? Who is your True Monarch?"

These words sent a tremor through Yuanshang's heart. The three words he was thinking of hung on the tip of his tongue, yet he did not know how to say them.

‘Chunyi Dao Gate.’

That untraversable threshold in the mirage heaven had been a colossal stone weighing upon the Chunyi Dao Gate for a thousand years. He could only lower his head and say respectfully,

"This junior has only just attained the Woven Jade Dao. I felt no resonance with the Supreme Yin; I simply awoke and found myself here. Within my Dao lineage, there has never been a True Monarch. The founder's Daoist name was Jiequn, and he was a… nominal disciple of the later Supreme Yang True Monarch, Yingze."

There was a moment of silence from above. Yuanshang paused, then continued,

"He… once cultivated in an Immortal Mansion. That place… is the Donghua Heaven Dao-path of Azure Profoundity. The Woven Jade Dao was likely obtained from there."

"Oh?"

Zhengao paused, then said,

"And the name of the art?"

Yuanshang said in a low voice,

"The Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic."

An imperceptible smile flashed in Zhengao's eyes, but his tone grew distant as he asked,

"I do not know how you sensed the Supreme Yin and achieved the Woven Jade Dao… but the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic… is that not a technique of the Encompassing Profoundity?"

The great stone in Yuanshang's heart finally came crashing down. He stood in trembling silence, utterly speechless.

It was true! Having obtained the many Daoist arts of the Chunyi Dao Gate, he had long since discovered upon careful inspection that something was amiss!

The current Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, at its deepest level, originated from Yingze. According to Heaven's Horn, Yingze came from Gonghua Heaven. From a macro perspective below the Azure Profoundity, it could indeed be called the Gonghua Dao-path.

This instantly reminded Lu Jiangxian of another place.

Donghua Heaven!

That was where the Moonlight Origin Mansion was located!

In other words, Donghua and Gonghua were very likely parallel, great Dao-paths beneath the Azure Profoundity, a tier higher than the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Yet the Dao-classic of the Chunyi Dao Gate belonged to neither, and instead bore the words 'Wall-Below'!

The name 'Wall-Below' was famous—it belonged to a True Monarch of the Encompassing Profoundity!

This made things extremely delicate. It was a terrifying truth that successive generations of Chunyi Dao Gate cultivators had always avoided—the Dao-classic in Jiequn's possession likely did not come from the Azure Profoundity at all, but was obtained by chance… This nominal disciple of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was truly just that, nominal. The ancestral art of the Chunyi Dao Gate was proof that Jiequn had never, in his entire life, stepped through the inner gates of the Azure Profoundity!

Now that Zhengao had laid it bare in just a few words, a deep chill washed over Yuanshang. He said in a trembling voice,

"The founder cultivated at Green Pine and resided in the Immortal Mansion; there are records of it all. The Supreme Yang once looked favorably upon him… but the origins of the Dao-classic are beyond the knowledge of a junior cultivator like myself…"

Lu Jiangxian knew there were holes in the story and had deliberately put him on a pedestal to create an excuse for him not to visit the heavens too often and chat with Dangjiang. Besides, Yuanshang was not Dangjiang; he had no soul of his own… He was merely a creation of the world within the mirror, his presence here nothing more than a projection from that mirrored world, with Lu Jiangxian constantly feeding him reactions… In other words, the moment Lu Jiangxian relaxed his focus, the non-existent Yuanshang would vanish from the heavens!

‘He cannot stay here for long… first, it's a drain on my mental energy, and second… Dangjiang's mouth is far too troublesome…’

Seeing him looking as if he'd been plunged into an icy abyss, Zhengao immediately changed his tune, his voice softening as he said,

"As this matter is unclear, I cannot hold your origins against you. Moreover, I see your divine abilities are all scattered, as if you've been censured by Exiled Qi, so I cannot admit you into the manor. However… a technique from the Encompassing Profoundity is of no concern. It is but one method among many. Since you were able to reach the Hall of Final Vastness, how could you be an outsider?"

This sentence allowed the old man's suspended heart to settle slightly, though the doubt was plain on his face. The person above him smiled and said,

"After all, this hall is where those of the Woven Jade Dao convene. Although many have now passed on or fallen, it still sensed your achievement, which can be considered a strand of karmic affinity."

Yuanshang was lost in thought at these words. The immortal general finished his smile, then his expression turned serious as he said,

"This place is not within the celestial realm, and it has fallen into disrepair over the years due to the Supreme Yin's seclusion. Now that you have arrived, it can be said to have a spark of life again. I will report this to the manor, have your name temporarily registered, and entrust this grand hall to your care. You will be responsible for making offerings to the Dao Ancestors and paying respects to the Supreme Yin. How does that sound?"

Yuanshang had escaped death; his life was a gift. His mind was filled with countless mysteries he yearned to solve. Now, finally receiving this offer, his heart calmed, and how could he possibly refuse? He lowered his gaze and said,

"Many thanks, my Lord! Shaoshang… if I receive this great honor, I will not fail my mission!"

He performed a deep bow, but the figure before him solemnly helped him to his feet, saying,

"Fellow Daoist, though you have lost your cultivation, your station is still that of the Woven Jade Dao, no lower than my own. I absolutely cannot accept such a gesture that demeans me."

This was Lu Jiangxian's sincere belief. The station of the Woven Jade Dao was not to be taken lightly. He had been observing from the side and had long sensed Daoist Master Yuanshang's sincerity. Zhengao was merely a Supreme Yin Immortal General he had invented; when the time came for action, Yuanshang was the one who could truly act on his behalf!

‘However, a man of his caliber is a rare talent. I must be patient, slowly building his backstory to allay any suspicion…’

He was not the least bit nervous as he said,

"Fellow Daoist, your situation is no small matter. The Immortal Lord is currently in seclusion, and I must summon several colleagues to inquire in detail… For now, I can only offer you a minor post as caretaker of the Hall of Final Vastness. I fear you may feel slighted…"

Yuanshang was a valuable asset who could keep Dangjiang in check, especially when it came to composing scriptures related to the three yin aspects. Lu Jiangxian had no intention of letting him go. He turned to Shaohui and instructed,

"Give all the scriptures you are responsible for to our fellow Daoist to take with him. On the one hand, it will enrich the Profound Hall, and on the other, it will give him something to occupy his time… By sorting through these texts, he might even find the origins of his Dao lineage."

Shaohui quickly nodded in agreement, her gaze toward Yuanshang becoming more respectful. A profound sense of security and belonging filled the old man's heart. He nodded gravely, opened his mouth, but ultimately refrained from voicing his many theories, saying instead,

"I will stand guard for the Supreme Yin, even unto death."

Zhengao laughed and shook his head.

"The Hall of Final Vastness has collapsed; its past is dust. For now, you need only watch over it—and this is no tedious task. There is a Divine Core cultivator of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition who has been trying to ascend to the heavens recently. Alas, the heavenly mystries are hidden, and he cannot find entry. It makes me seem as though I have neglected him. Now that you are here in the Hall of Final Vastness, he will at least have a place to visit…"

His expression turned solemn as he added,

"He is a senior of great standing. You may consult him on any matter."

Yuanshang immediately nodded, committing the words to memory.

This was precisely Lu Jiangxian's intention, and Yuanshang's greatest immediate purpose in his plan!

‘Dangjiang is a gossip, and Shaohui is naive, but Yuanshang is perfect for this! In his current state, he's the ideal person to handle Tang Xie… He has a perfectly legitimate reason to ask about the various changes concerning the Supreme Yin of the Azure Profoundity!’

Lu Jiangxian had deliberately stoked Yuanshang's curiosity about ancient history, intending to use him as a mouthpiece to question Tang Xie.

‘Ideally, I can pry the most crucial secrets and information about the Moonlight Origin Mansion and Yingze from Tang Xie's lips! Even if I can't, I must get a clear understanding of the Three Profoundities, especially the several Supreme Yin True Monarchs of the Azure Profoundity!’
