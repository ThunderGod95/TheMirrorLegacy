# Chapter 893: Tianhuo

Li Ximing didn't believe any talk of achieving the True Monarch realm or forging a Golden Core. If anyone had a chance, it was Li Zhouwei or Li Que'wan. He'd be burning high incense just to reach the Purple Mystery realm.

He just bowed and said, "I dare not hope for the Golden Core. I only wish for this junior to have some promise, so as not to lose our inheritance."

Hearing this, Zhengao paused, a hint of melancholy in his eyes. He turned away, silent for a moment. In the distance, a palace maid hurried over, holding a jade box.

He sighed. "There are many good things left in the High Firmament Pavilion. He also left items behind, entrusted to the heavens. Take them all back with you. Consider it accepting this karmic connection."

As the items were presented, Li Ximing bowed again and again, thanking him profusely, but he did not rise. He bowed and asked, "This junior has merely received an ancestor's legacy. Might I ask if that immortal official was Daoist Master Donghua?"

The Li clan had obtained the Immortal Mirror long ago and had harbored this suspicion. Now, he finally voiced it, his heart pounding. He watched from the corner of his eye and saw that at the mention of this name, Dangjiang, who was also kneeling, was already weeping, his sobs unstoppable.

A chill went down his spine. 'It must be him... This Immortal Official Dangjiang toiled day and night for Daoist Master Donghua. Daoist Master Donghua even recorded his pavilion's name on the censer. Now, just hearing the name, Dangjiang is overcome, tears streaming down his face. Daoist Master Donghua must have had significant standing in the heavens! That must be why... this immortal general, who clearly holds a high position, came to greet me personally!'

Dangjiang's heartbreaking sobs made even Zhengao sigh.

'Can I even say no?' he thought. 'It's not like I can point to anyone else for you. Am I supposed to say it was your Ancestor Mutian?'

So, Zhengao put on a solemn expression and sighed deeply. "Cherish it well."

With that, he waved his sleeve, and Li Ximing dissolved into a stream of light. Zhengao turned, exasperated. Dangjiang was a wreck, stretching out his hands and crying, "It has been so long since I've seen you, milord! I have missed you dearly! I have kept your teachings in mind. These hands have not stopped transcribing cultivation manuals for a single day!"

That's what he said, but in his mind, he was chanting:

'Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun... Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun... It really was you... Still no news, and I still have to work like an ox. My life is bitter!'

Zhengao's head buzzed from listening to his thoughts. Frustrated, he maintained his imposing demeanor and offered some comfort. "I know your hardship. You have always been the one managing Immortal Official Li's affairs. It is a good sign that someone from the Lower Realm has arrived. It means the restrictions on the Immortal Residence are gradually lifting..."

"Immortal Official Li's position has remained vacant. This Zhaojing won't be able to ascend for many days, and he may not have the chance in the future. But his old position—exterminating Demons in the Lower Realm and policing unorthodox paths—could be of great benefit to you!"

Dangjiang looked up, overjoyed, but his face was still tear-streaked.

"This lowly one is not greedy, nor am I complaining! I am only grateful that milord always remembers me. I will never forget! I will redouble my efforts..."

To his credit, he was indeed diligent. While he couldn't transcribe Purple Mansion Realm-level scrolls like Lu Jiangxian, he hadn't slacked off on Foundation Establishment Realm or Qi Refining texts. His breadth was far greater than Shaohui's, who specialized only in Lesser Yin.

He (Lu Jiangxian) now comforted him, "This place is also harsh. If you need anything... feel free to ask Shaohui."

Lu Jiangxian had just finished speaking when he heard the man's irrepressible inner voice:

'Are there... are there any immortal cows in the heavens? I'm dying for some milk...'

The thought was so jarring that Lu Jiangxian immediately dispersed into the wind, utterly exasperated.

'I should have known he was like this... He brought Jinlian's bad habits to the heavens! Still thinking about boiling milk to drink!'

***

High Firmament Pavilion.

The four high lamp pillars blazed. The Daoist Master in the white-gold robes slowly opened his eyes.

Li Ximing felt the world spin. He was back in the High Firmament Pavilion. The celestial sights vanished like a dream, his soul returned to his Shengyang Acupoint, and only the sun-and-moon light of the High Firmament Pavilion remained.

The three incense sticks in the censer had just burned out, their ashes drooping inside. A jade box sat directly in front of him.

'It was like a dream... It truly was Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun.'

'But even if he was a Sword Immortal, even if he alone could suppress any Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in Jiangnan and was on good terms with every young cultivator of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... he was still besieged and killed at Moongaze Lake. My clan is nothing compared to him. We must be even more cautious.'

He rose and picked up the jade box, studying it. It was unadorned, pure white as snow, and felt as if it might melt in his hand at any moment.

He opened it gently, and a wave of frigid air rushed out, plunging the pavilion into a sudden chill. He looked inside and saw a scroll and a small, fingernail-sized pearl.

The scroll depicted a white sparrow, wings spread as if about to take flight, startlingly lifelike. Six large characters were written beside it:
*Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity*.

Li Ximing examined it closely. The base of the painting was filled with densely packed text describing a cultivation method and its associated spell arts. He probed it with his spiritual sense. The *Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity* was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method of the Lesser Yin attribute. It allowed one to condense the 'All-Fragrance Sinks' Divine Ability and came complete with spell arts, movement techniques, and escape arts.

Although the *Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity* was written by Shaohui, Shaohui had once been a Demon King from beyond the seas. Some of her habits and techniques were bound to be noticed. Lu Jiangxian had modified it after receiving it. It now radiated an ancient air, reminiscent of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao in its nascent form.

Li Ximing nodded in delight. He placed the scroll back in the box and then looked at the token in his hand. It was indeed glowing with a silver light.

'From now on, this place is my clan's treasure trove. Talisman Pills, clan histories, spell artifacts, and incredible cultivation methods... I'll hide them all in here.'

He put the scroll away and took out the small, fingernail-sized pearl. As he sensed it, a scene gradually appeared in his spiritual sense.

He saw familiar, churning vermilion-green seawater, a narrow strait, and rolling mountain ranges. Li Ximing studied it.

'It seems to be somewhere in the Strait of Ten Thousand Isles... near Lulai Island...'

As his perspective sank, a deep blue glow emerged, revealing a cave residence hidden within the earth veins. Its gates were sealed tight, showing no sign of life.

'A Purple Mansion Grand Formation... It must be someone's cave residence.'

Li Ximing memorized the location, stored the pearl back in the jade box, and headed to the next floor.

'There are still Purple Mansion Realm cultivation methods and spell arts here!'

He took out the wooden slips again, inserted them into the stone platform, and began to browse.

He didn't browse randomly. After a careful search, he found a Purple Mansion Realm method for the World's Radiance lineage. The lowest-level one was the *Clear-Through Eternal Celebration Scripture*, but its name was greyed out.

'According to the token's description, as long as the clan's disciples make offerings, new cultivation methods will eventually be bestowed. But to request a *specific* one, you must first pray by the censer in the High Firmament Pavilion and send a talisman to the heavens. You then have to wait for a response. With the heavens sealed, who knows how long that would take, or who would even respond...'

'Besides, it's too expensive. Purple Smoke already has the World's Radiance Daoist tradition, so it would be more reasonable to get it from her. No need to go through all this trouble. I should focus on exterminating Demons, see how many immortal merits I can earn, and exchange them for something else.'

After his experience in the heavens, Li Ximing understood that most of the lit-up  Arts here had been exchanged by that Immortal Official Li. Of the fifth-rank spell arts, aside from the *Water-Guiding Transformation Scripture* of the Pit Water attribute, which he was not skilled in, three remained: the Pure Qi art *Profound Vastness Art*, the True Qi art *True-One Severing Yi Radiance Art*, and the Azure Manifestation art *Nine Dams of the Azure Ram Mountain*.

Among the three, Azure Manifestation favored Earth Virtue and had always held an ambiguous position among the arts. In contrast, Pure Qi and True Qi were the least restrictive and could be used by almost anyone.

Li Ximing glanced at the *Profound Vastness Art*. It was a spell art that used the Dharma body to cultivate Pure Qi, entrusting it to the Great Void to be nurtured and transformed. It required the Dharma body to be "unblemished and unharmed." Unblemished meant at least the Purple Mansion Realm, and unharmed meant having no injuries.

Normally, when cultivating this art, if the Dharma body was damaged, the Pure Qi entrusted to the Great Void would sense the breach and pour out. The *Profound Vastness Art* used this principle to repair the Dharma body or strike at enemies in an emergency.

But its most important use wasn't just that. It seemed most of the text was just a foundation for accumulating Pure Qi. Once the art was mastered, if the body was suddenly destroyed, the excess Pure Qi would envelop the Shengyang Acupoint and escape into the Great Void.

'Pure Qi arts truly are profound...'

At the Purple Mansion Realm, although one couldn't act as wantonly as the Merciful One or Maha, the destruction of the Dharma body was not the end. Only when the Shengyang Acupoint shattered was one truly considered fallen.

However, Purple Mansion cultivators had no Buddhist Land to entrust their core to and escape thousands of miles in an instant. If the Dharma body was shattered, it was simple for an enemy to seize the Shengyang Acupoint. Only with a rare Spiritual Artifact or spell art could a precious few escape with just their Shengyang Acupoint.

The *Profound Vastness Art* looked difficult. Li Ximing scanned it and moved on to the *True-One Severing Yi Radiance Art*. This True Qi spell art was one of those rare arts nurtured within a weapon, which naturally made it hard to cultivate. He noted them both down for now.

He had been cultivating the *Tread on Flames* technique recently, and after nearly two years, he had only just passed the introductory stage. He wouldn't overreach. He immediately went down to the lowest floor, activated the stone platform, and began picking fourth-rank Bright Yang spell arts.

This time, there were many more arts available, and the difficulty was much lower. Li Ximing wasn't lacking for offensive methods at the moment. After a careful look, he picked out two.

'A fourth-rank Bright Yang escape art, the *Arranged-Mansions Celestial Yang Escape Art*, and a fourth-rank binding art, the *Radiant Celestial Wave Art*.'

As an Immortal Dao cultivator, his selection of arts was already richer than that of Buddhist cultivators or Demon cultivators. Now, he had his free pick. Movement techniques, spell arts, escape arts... each had its merits. It was tempting to take more, but he knew not to bite off more than he could chew. He settled on these two.

'First, neither is too difficult. Second, they are both closely related to the *Audience with the Celestial Gate* ability, so I should be able to master them faster.'

'This has its drawbacks, of course. When I cultivate other Divine Abilities like the *Eternal Brightness Steps*, these arts won't be complementary and will likely be replaced. But who knows if I'll ever reach that stage? Speed is all that matters. I need to increase my strength as quickly as possible.'

Satisfied, he put them away and went to his residence in the pavilion, storing the jade box in a chest.

During his fight with Nuxiao and the others, Li Ximing had sustained a minor shoulder injury. It wasn't visible now, but it would take a few months to heal. He had no patience to wait. Taking advantage of the rich spiritual energy here, he retrieved a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill from his sleeve. He pinched the skin and flesh of his shoulder, pushed the pill inside, and let it dissolve, allowing it to heal on its own.

But he had just finished dressing the wound, not even having time to cultivate, when he heard a crisp *crack!*

Li Ximing looked down quickly. The jade talisman at his waist was trembling, fine cracks spreading across its surface.

"There's news from the lake!"

He quickly closed the jade box, grabbed a pale green-white jade bottle from the cabinet, and turned to the window. He didn't spare a glance for the wondrous scenery outside as he secretly communicated with the token.

*Shhh...*

His form instantly dissolved into Heavenly Light. The silver-white token hovered in the air for a moment before floating down to rest on the table.

***

Lake Island, Inner Formation.

Li Ximing waited a moment. His surroundings stabilized into a purple-and-yellow light barrier. His form materialized in a dimly lit hall where long curtains swayed in a faint breeze, casting pale shadows.

His spiritual sense swept out. Li Que'wan was waiting for him just outside the main hall, looking calm. He relaxed.

'It seems nothing bad has happened. It's probably just a Purple Mansion Realm visitor.'

The timing was awkward. The major battles in the north were still raging. If Li Ximing hadn't been protecting his treasures, he too would be out seeing if he could pick up any scraps instead of returning so early to hide.

Nothing in front of him had changed since he left, but his state of mind was completely different. He let out a breath, his mood excellent, and bid the girl enter.

Li Que'wan entered the hall, bowed formally, and reported respectfully, "Daoist Master, Daoist Master Tianhuo of the Golden Feather Sect is here to pay a visit. He is on the lake... with a cultivator from Jiangbei... I informed him you were healing, and he said... there was no rush..."

"Tianhuo?"

Hearing it was someone from the Golden Feather Sect, Li Ximing's feelings were complicated. But for a figure of this level to visit, he couldn't just let him wait. The Golden Feather Sect had been monitoring Bai Yinzi; they certainly knew what injuries he had sustained and how severe they were.

"I will go greet him."

Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then, as he walked out, he added as if suddenly remembering something, "The clan has a Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda. It has space inside to hold people. Move it from Mount Qingdu, have someone repair this hall, and install it right here in the main hall!"

Li Que'wan didn't have time to ask questions; she just nodded in assent.

Li Ximing passed through the formation and went out onto the lake, where he saw a Daoist Master in golden-yellow robes. The Daoist Master's robes were embroidered with golden flames, and his cuffs depicted golden rocks and wind-blown sand. They were exceptionally ornate. He stood seven feet tall, with handsome brows and sharp eyes—a man of graceful bearing. A small, gleaming silver sword-shaped accessory hung from his waist. He stood on the water's surface, gazing into the distance.

Standing respectfully nearby was a young man in blue robes, so nervous he was sweating profusely, not daring to speak. From his appearance, it had to be Su Yan, the one who had caused such a commotion in the Capital immortals Dao that Guan Gongxiao had repeatedly called for help.

Seeing Li Ximing approach, the golden-robed Daoist Master turned, his eyes shining. "Greetings, Zhaojing! I am Tianhuo of the Golden Feather Sect."

Li Ximing returned the courtesy. "Let's speak on the mountain."

If Azure Pond had always been a greedy wolf in the Li clan's history, always trying to bleed them dry, then the Golden Feather Sect was the smiling tiger licking its fur nearby. Although they were rumored to be on good terms with the Li clan, their attitude was mostly one of indifference.

'If that was all, it would have been fine.'

But the incident back then with Situ Mo of the Golden Tang Gate had needlessly cost the life of Li Chenghui of the Chengming generation. This was a deep pain for Li Ximing. More than one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had schemed against the Li clan in that affair. Fearing retaliation from a young Purple Mansion cultivator like himself, even more had opportunistically fanned the flames and struck cheap blows. The Golden Feather Sect's indifference was simply allowing others to borrow the "knife" that was the Situ clan.

'As for whether they actively supported it... who knows.'

Li Ximing couldn't pin all the blame on the Golden Feather Sect. In fact, it was impossible to count how many Purple Mansion cultivators had been involved. The more one guessed, the more dangerous it became. He could only sigh inwardly. 'It has always been this way... How can it ever be made clear? I can only hope that Zhouwei remains safe.'

Despite this past, Li Ximing led him up the mountain. Daoist Master Tianhuo seemed unfazed, merely smiling. "Zhaojing must have gained much this time. I heard the Buddhist cultivators came up empty. I arrived halfway through, and Wang Xiaoxiao was taken in by Chengyun Gate."

This outcome was about what Li Ximing had expected. If he was going to take Bai Yinzi, someone else was bound to take Wang Xiaoxiao. He couldn't expect them to just wait. So, she had fallen into Chengyun's hands.

Tianhuo took a seat, waving for Su Yan to wait outside. Then he smiled. "I just sparred with one of the Five Bright Ones from the White Victory Dao and ran into members of the Helian clan. Only then did I learn that the Helian clan has grown very close to the Way of Emptiness... They were dead set on capturing that Yaosa Chengmi and nearly came to blows with the Lotus Temple."

Li Ximing regarded all of them as trouble; it would be best if they did fight.

'I still have that kasaya that was wrapped around Bai Yinzi. Anything used specifically to protect him can't be ordinary. But I have no use for a Buddhist cultivator's item... I'll have to find a way to sell it.'

Tianhuo, oblivious to his thoughts, paused slightly. His eyes fixed on Li Ximing. "The Helian clan was once glorious. They've been struggling for many years and now finally have a chance to breathe. Like the Way of Emptiness, they are resented by both the Gao clan and the White Horse Monastery. Whether due to the situation or their relationship, they had no choice but to side with the Way of Emptiness. But who knew that the Way of Emptiness, which twice rushed to Jiangbei and stirred up the conflict between north and south, was only doing so out of its own desperation? They are not a safe ship to board."

"Now they're relying on Secret Diffusion to catch their breath, so they roped people in to ambush Purple Smoke. And look... how little did they get for all that effort!"

'What's that supposed to mean? *How little* did they get?'

His words carried a hidden barb. Li Ximing was stunned, caught off guard. He probed lightly, "I can't say for sure. Perhaps the Helian clan had its own reasons for siding with the Way of Emptiness. I heard their territory is in Hetao, where they face the Northern Di and Demon beasts. They aren't at peace either."

"Indeed..." Tianhuo lowered his gaze slightly. Li Ximing's heart thumped as he heard him continue, "I hear you've been on good terms with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition lately... That's rare. It must be because you, Zhaojing, are of imperial descent and upright character that you have this fortunate connection. My clan is just a mountain away. If there's any way we can help, it would be best for us to interact more..."

Li Ximing quickly replied, "I wouldn't dare trouble the Immortal Sect without reason."

"But I *do* have a favor to ask!" Tianhuo smiled. "Now that the spoils are mostly divided, I was taking Su Yan back when I suddenly thought of the *Great River and Grand Mound Scripture*. I came here to borrow it."

He said with regret, "The *Great River and Grand Mound Scripture* has never met its destined owner and has sat empty all these years. Duanyan came once, thinking to activate it, but he didn't find a suitable candidate. This time, I have Su Yan, so I made the trip."

Seeing him with Su Yan, Li Ximing had already understood his purpose. He sent a mental command and smiled. "This is a good thing. The *Great River and Grand Mound Scripture* is just collecting dust in my clan's vault. If the Immortal Sect has a use for it, please take it! If an opportunity arises one day, just send a copy back to the lake, and we'll consider the favor returned."

Tianhuo immediately stood up, his voice heavy. "What nonsense is this! My Golden Feather Sect will absolutely not renege on a favor owed! We cannot simply take something from the lake for free. This is a debt *I* owe you."

Li Ximing met his smiling gaze, feeling a slight unease. He sighed, "It's just one cultivation method..."

"Ah... the Situ clan's was *also* just one cultivation method, yet it still required the Supreme Yang cultivators to make a trip..."

He waved his hand, having brought up the Situ clan. Li Ximing hesitated, then finally asked, "The Golden Tang Gate... their fate was truly tragic. Even though my clan was always their enemy, I couldn't bear to see an immortal lineage humiliated like that. A few collateral branches survived; they were sent to my clan."

At this, Tianhuo's smile didn't fade, but he avoided Li Ximing's gaze and deftly dodged the topic. "Oh... the Way of Emptiness is building a temple on the Tangdao Mountain Range. I hear it's called the 'Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple'. Quite the display!"

As he spoke, he shook his head with a laugh, but his hand rested on his tea cup, unmoving. Finally, he saw Ding Weizeng hurrying in from outside the mountain, holding a jade box.

Ding Weizeng placed the box on the table, opened the lid, and removed the golden silk cloth covering the *Great River and Grand Mound Scripture*.

"Good..."

Li Ximing handed it to Tianhuo. The Daoist Master took it with a smile, his expression turning serious. "I will remember your clan's righteous act. In recent years, our Clan Sister Qiushui has been in seclusion, cultivating a grand art of spiritual division and preservation. She has no mind for sect affairs. The sect... is managed by myself and Tianque. Just send any letters to the Golden Feather Sect."

He said a few more words, flicked his sleeve, and stood. Then, as if just remembering, he asked, "Your clan's 'qilin child'... I presume he has also entered seclusion by now!"

Li Ximing met his gaze briefly but did not answer.

The young man understood. He smiled and vanished into the Great Void as a flash of colored light.

Ding Weizeng kept his head bowed, but Li Ximing's expression was frozen. He remained silent for a long time, one hand still resting on the table, motionless.

The man knew his place and clumsily began to clear the table, collecting the jade box, tea, and cloth. He was about to take Daoist Master Tianhuo's cup when Li Ximing shook his head.

"Daoist Master..."

The Daoist Master waved him off. "Leave."

Ding Weizeng quickly bowed and retreated. Li Ximing stepped forward, staring at his own eyes reflected in the teacup.

'When a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator feels strong emotion, their divine ability manifests externally, interacting with all things. When Changxi died, his final letter was so heavy a mortal could not lift it. When he spoke of the Golden Tang Gate affair, he was seething, grinding his teeth in hatred, yet he dared not voice his anger, suppressing his emotions and his power, which resulted in that...'

This cup had absorbed Tianhuo's rage. It weighed over a thousand pounds. If Li Ximing hadn't been here, the jade table would have instantly collapsed and shattered.
