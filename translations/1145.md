# Chapter 1145: The Gap

The world roiled with wind and clouds. Myriad pink eyes flickered in and out of sight within the churning heavens, their profound patterns glowing brightly against a golden form that remained shrouded in darkness, exuding an aura of solemn dignity.

‘Zhelu.’

He knew this Maha. It was an old acquaintance. During the chaos in Anhuai Heaven years ago, Zhelu had contended with Jinlian and Vija for Tang Shecheng. He was also the very backer of Taixi who had sought to refine Li Xuanfeng.

Zhelu was a Maha Liangli of the Turbid Emptiness Dao. He should have been a top-tier figure among the Seven Aspects, but the Turbid Emptiness Dao was a shattered remnant, hollow within. He had only reached his sixth life through the support of others.

Even so, this Maha Liangli’s strength was approaching the late Purple Mansion Realm.

Facing the brilliant golden halberd, Zhelu remained utterly unperturbed. A bronze lotus bloomed before him, radiating infinite light as a thousand eyes flashed in unison.

Li Zhouwei withdrew his gaze from the mysterious daoist, his expression turning equally grave. Seizing the moment before his Bright King art dissipated, he swept his halberd up to point it at Zhelu, and a wave of pitch-black darkness stained the sky.

"Good…"

Confronted by Li Zhouwei's charge, Zhelu’s reaction was entirely different from the previous two Mahas. With a flicker of his thousand eyes, he closed a great hand around the bronze lotus. Instantly, heaven and earth trembled, clouds churned, and mountains of gold descended from the sky.

The Sovereign’s Perilous Tread technique was terrifying in a direct charge. Zhelu’s myriad disorienting lights, typically invincible, were useless now. But as a Maha Liangli of immense Dao-Profundity, he had no shortage of methods.

The mountains descended with a heavy, crushing weight. They did not target him, bind him, or suppress him; they simply fell, divine abilities crashing down like a relentless storm. Heavenly light clashed with the golden peaks, shattering the air all around. Zhelu then quelled his own ability and summoned a Buddhist Land.

"By my decree!"

From within the mists of the Buddhist Land, a five-colored radiance descended upon the golden mountains. The spell was instantly empowered, transforming completely. No matter how King Wei shattered the peaks, new ones grew back at a terrifying rate, a dense, ever-regenerating barrier that consumed the space before him.

Li Zhouwei frowned, getting his first true taste of this Turbid Emptiness Liangli’s power.

But his opponent was wary of the Sovereign’s Perilous Tread and refused to interfere with his charge. Unrestrained, Li Zhouwei merely shifted his golden eyes. The Crimson Severing Arrowhead vanished from the sky. The young man burst free from the mountain range, his white blade flashing as it closed in on the golden form’s eyes.

The thousand-eyed Maha showed no fear nor haste. He pressed his palms together, a faint smile on his lips. The Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions, which had been waiting before him, suddenly flipped over and descended to envelop its target.

This lotus was a treasure Zhelu had nurtured for many years. Now, brimming with accumulated power, it erupted into a three-colored lotus fire. Capitalizing on Li Zhouwei's broken charge, the flames slammed into him, burning fiercely and exploding in a brilliant flash of light.

A vast, disorienting sea of esoteric power flooded his Shengyang Acupoint, rooting him to the spot.

The thousand-eyed golden form before King Wei dispersed like the wind, rematerializing in the distance as a slender monk. His face, however, was covered in so many eyes that any trace of handsome refinement was utterly destroyed. He gave a strange little lift to his Zen robes and smiled.

"Please, King Wei, enjoy it at your leisure."

As his voice faded, not only did the main body of the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions charge forward, but the golden mountains he had summoned earlier shifted their target and began to fall once more.

Yet, amid the swirling lights and flames, King Wei's eyes snapped open. Dense Qilin patterns converged across his body, his ink-black robes transforming into battle armor. The roiling flames slid from his form like common water, completely harmless. His halberd flared.

Binding Light!

The bronze lotus had not only failed to restrain him, but it had been imprisoned in turn. The vicious light of the halberd expanded rapidly. King Wei’s gaze was glacial as he brought two fingers together and held them vertically before his lips.

"Boom!"

A sky-swallowing darkness swept in, and a single point of fire bloomed at his fingertips.

The flame was a brilliant, clear gold, radiating a pure light devoid of any evil or strangeness. It was neither false nor real, neither yin nor yang. Though only the size of a soybean, it pulsed with the condensed might of a life-mandate brought to its absolute peak.

It was the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare!

The monk's expression froze. The Great Void around him trembled as Li-Light erupted from all directions—above, below, left, and right. Golden locks of light interlinked and converged, weaving a great net of chains that trapped him where he stood.

The net appeared impossibly fine, yet it seared billowing white smoke from his body, embedding itself in his flesh and scalding the densely packed eyes. He opened his mouth and let out a terrifying, inhuman howl.

"Aaaargh!"

Zhelu had refined a thousand-eyed body. He was a classic Buddhist cultivator of the Immortal Dao, one who had poured all his Dao-Profundity into his golden form. He had spent untold years on this bizarre Dharma Body; it was exceptionally precious, and he never allowed an enemy to get near it. He had never imagined he would face a technique so tyrannical that it could manifest from thin air.

Worse, an intense imprisoning force washed over his body, and his brilliant lights suddenly dimmed. The bright halberd charged forward. King Wei held it in one hand, his eyes shining like twin stars.

"Dong!"

A wave of searing heavenly light shot into the sky, exceptionally bright against the dark canopy of night. The distant setting sun seemed to tremble. Yet, Li Zhouwei felt no joy. His sharp gaze swept across the battlefield, meeting the smiling eyes of the Daoist, who was calmly putting away an azure stone.

The Daoist had made his move again.

The power of this last halberd strike had clearly been less than that of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd. The Daoist held the azure stone with an unnerving stillness. A moment later, a desolate, distant roar echoed through the air.

"King Wei… I require aid!"

Li Zhouwei turned his head and saw the white-haired old man.

Situ Huo!

The mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator's face was ashen, his eyes glinting with a sinister light. His Dharma Body, which seemed forged from gold and stone, was covered in cracks. Three flags were embedded in his chest and abdomen, fluttering wildly in the wind and pulsing with waves of True Fire.

The cloud of dragons and serpents beneath the old man's feet was still present, but it now looked ragged and pathetic. He held his long saber aloft, struggling to parry a simple wooden sword.

The Daoist advanced with the leisure of a man strolling through his own garden. He came to a stop and sat cross-legged upon a horizontal gourd, a broad smile on his face as he formed a sword-finger sign. As his fingers slowly pressed down, Situ Huo was inexorably forced back by the wooden sword, retreating bit by bit toward the river.

The Daoist still seemed unsatisfied, a flicker of surprise on his face as he remarked,

"He has some skill, I'll give him that."

Li Zhouwei's expression turned grim.

Situ Huo wasn't gravely injured. In their brief exchange, Li Zhouwei had only managed to gain a slight advantage over his own opponent, hardly a suppression. Yet this Military Commissioner, this master of the broadsword, had already been pushed all the way back to the river's edge. One more step and he would be in Jiangnan.

‘This isn't a call for aid. He's lost the will to fight.’

While Li Zhouwei was locked in a fierce back-and-forth, Situ Huo felt as if he were fighting a ghost. The Metal Virtue spell arts he had cultivated for years were a complete joke before this cultivator. The man’s porcelain gourd had simply swept through them like a gale scattering the clouds, leaving nothing behind.

His renowned Blood-Omen Tower had fared even worse. No matter how many seas of blood, disorienting illusions, or malevolent blade-winds it conjured, no matter the sinister light or Metal Malice it unleashed, his opponent negated it all with a single divine ability. The attacks vanished as if brushed by a gentle spring breeze.

‘Hundreds of years… this is the first time anything like this has happened…’

He felt no discouragement, only a profound shock.

‘This spell is specifically designed to counter blood-based arts! It has to be from a Golden Core Dao lineage!’

Situ Huo had trump cards of his own, but the situation made it clear that every technique he had ever relied on was little more than child's play to this man. Only his Monarch's Lost Sheep artifact had any effect, and it was only enough to allow for a continuous, desperate retreat.

He was Situ Huo! He was an expert among those at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, a recipient of the light of Martial Cultivation! What kind of monster could toy with him like this? There was no anger in his heart, only a spreading chill that seized his lungs and made his spirit tremble.

‘There's something wrong with this Daoist… he mentioned a Grotto-Heaven… who is he? A direct descendant of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition? A direct disciple of a True Monarch?’

With that realization, only a single thought remained in Situ Huo’s mind.

‘Run… I have to run now! These direct descendants of the Three Profoundities can't be judged by common sense. Baiye is lost. If I'm too slow, my life is lost too!’

He wasn’t Situ Tang, and he certainly wasn't Duanmu Kui. Years ago, Kui Qi couldn't even defend himself against Wei Xuanyin for a short time, and Wei Xuanyin hadn't even trained in a Grotto-Heaven—he was from a mere mortal branch of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition!

His cry to Li Zhouwei wasn't a request for help. It was a declaration.

‘I, Situ Huo, am leaving now. You're on your own!’

Li Zhouwei understood perfectly. His expression grew heavy. He glanced down at the great array below, where thick purple qi was churning within the formation's light.

‘This is trouble. Without Situ Huo, it's no longer a question of defending Baiye. Lingering any longer is a death sentence!’

His gaze hardened. He made his decision in an instant. Stepping upon a trail of faint red light, he crossed the sky to intercept the Daoist. At the same time, his voice, empowered by a divine ability, shot into the array below.

"Retreat immediately!"

Zhelu, caught off guard by Li Zhouwei's previous attack, was seething. He wasn't about to let his target escape. But just as he moved to act, a kaleidoscope of colors exploded before his eyes. His mind grew fuzzy as infinite heavenly light spun before him.

The Pure Yang Bracelets!

The Spiritual Treasure had never failed. It pinned the Maha in place. The light of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead shifted, arcing gracefully through the air not toward Zhelu, but straight for the Daoist, buying precious time for the enormous purple pavilion that was now rising from the ground.

Seeing Li Zhouwei arrive on a path of light, the Daoist's smile faded. He frowned, clasped his hands together, and spoke, his head lowered.

"A reminder for King Wei, it would be unwise to linger here!"

His only answer was the flash of a bright halberd.

The Daoist smiled and shook his head. He raised two fingers and held them before him.

Guileful Desolate Plain!

In an instant, a grayish-yellow light enveloped them. The distance between the two combatants seemed to stretch impossibly, yet they also felt as if they were right next to each other. All color and power converged on the halberd's tip, only to be met by an object falling from the sky.

It was a jade Ruyi Scepter, the color of a yellowish-green autumn leaf.

The scepter struck the halberd with a force that made the muscles on Li Zhouwei's arm bulge and his Qilin patterns flare into view. The radiance and esoteric power of his attack instantly dimmed. He should have been stopped cold, but the charging momentum of the Sovereign’s Perilous Tread suddenly surged, and he broke through.

The sleeve of the Daoist’s gray robe billowed open.

The halberd felt as though it had been plunged into an endless mire. The two warriors' auras tangled in the air as their divine abilities clashed. Li Zhouwei's golden eyes shifted, his brow furrowed in concentration.

A wooden sword had already pierced the Great Void and was now reflected in his pupils.

The sword was crude, its hilt still bearing the untrimmed nubs of branches that glowed with a faint, tender-green iridescence. A familiar aura washed over him.

‘The Heavenly Nurture Urn… it's Protecting Wood…’

"Thud!"

Without a flicker of hesitation, Li Zhouwei's hand shot up and clamped down on the wooden sword. The Daoist's expression shifted, and his sword-finger sign paused. But the space between the young man's brows had already transformed into the omen of a solar eclipse. A vast desert manifested, and a black-gold radiance erupted forth.

"An art of the Yang Cusp…"

The Daoist's expression changed. His eyes took on the brilliant hue of sunset clouds. A seven-colored divine light gathered and surged out to meet the black-gold wave of Emperor Qi's Light.

"BOOM!"

The light in the sky shattered. The black-gold radiance dissolved like winter snow under a blazing sun. The majestic, seven-colored pillar of sunset light struck the golden figure, passed through it, and slammed into the earth like a falling comet.

An earth-shattering cloud of dust erupted. The purple pavilion had already soared high into the sky. A beam of cool, clear light pierced the dust cloud and shone upon the ground, tranquil and fragrant like the light of an immortal realm.

The Violet Arrangement!

The rolling, clear light, mingled with purple qi, settled the dust. The golden-eyed youth was gone, leaving only a trail of violet mist rising into the air. The Daoist paused, a flicker of surprise on his face.

He didn't seem to care that his prey had escaped. Instead, he remarked with admiration,

"The heritage of the True Dao Sect."

The mountain forest fell silent. All was peaceful. The assembled Buddhist cultivators kept their heads bowed, not daring to look at him. Even Zhelu, the Maha Liangli, was trembling with fear as he stared at the man.

The Daoist paid them no mind; it was as if they didn't exist. With a flick of his sleeve, he stepped into the Great Void and vanished.

For a moment, the golden forms of the Mahas shimmered. The Merciful Ones exchanged glances, and their strange gazes fell in unison upon the pale face of the immortal cultivator still trapped beneath the white light of the array.

"BOOM!"

---

Ting Province.

A shroud of Dawn Qi intertwined with the merciless, unifying light that bathed the island. A Daoist Master in white-gold robes stood silently, his face ashen. The flames beside him danced, threatening to burn a hole through the Great Void itself.

Opposite him stood a tall man in feathered robes. Strings of viscous, golden blood dripped from the tip of his long halberd. His eyes, a swirling mix of Profound Yellow Qi, watched his opponent quietly.

There was no great solemnity in his gaze, only casual observation. A flicker of wariness appeared only when his eyes swept over the burning Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire.

A rolling aura of Veiled Yin clung to Touba Ci's robes, effortlessly neutralizing the heavenly light that shone upon him and leaving a bitter taste in Li Ximing’s mouth.

‘Substituted Hindrance…’

Back in Baixiang Valley, Li Ximing had seen Li Zhouwei suppress this man with a single Audience with the Celestial Gate. He hadn't thought much of him then. Perhaps Li Zhouwei had killed Vast Cicada too quickly, or perhaps the northern cultivators were simply accustomed to holding back. At Baixiang, this man, like Changyun, had clearly not been fighting at full strength.

But after nearly seventy rounds of combat on the lake, Li Ximing was covered in wounds, and his heart was cold with dread.

‘The Profound Qi Dao lineage… it's terrifying.’

His opponent possessed the Substituted Hindrance divine ability. Though he cultivated Profound Qi, he could perceive Bright Yang and give birth to Veiled Yin. His mastery of the technique wasn't deep, but it was enough to neutralize the majority of Li Ximing's attacks.

And every strike of the man's halberd was brutally powerful, each more ferocious than the last, beating Li Ximing into a sorry state.

He shifted his gaze to the general standing high above with his hands clasped behind his back. His eyes darkened.

Gongsun Bei.

Truthfully, this man was an even greater threat than Touba Ci. His mastery over Dawn Qi was exquisite, and his combat prowess was formidable. Most lethally, Li Ximing knew he was still holding back a Dawn Qi Spiritual Treasure.

‘He's keeping it in reserve, waiting for Minghuang!’

If not for that Spiritual Treasure still gathering power, the support of the array, his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, and the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire that could force his opponents back, Li Ximing would already be dead. Even so, with every exchange, he sustained new injuries.

He appeared to be holding his own, but the effigy hidden in his sleeve was covered in cracks. After just seventy rounds, it was on the verge of shattering. Worse still was the great array beneath his feet, which flickered precariously under the constant assault, filling him with rage and frustration.

‘This Gongsun Bei… he doesn't even try to injure me with every attack. His attention isn't even fully on me—it's still on the island!’

Before he could think further, the descendant of Great Liang raised his hand again. An ornate azure jade vase descended from the heavens, spilling a cascade of clear, brilliant light.

As the light rained down, a great azure cauldron materialized in the air. The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron flew out and absorbed the radiance, but the divine ability hidden within was unleashed.

Plea to Supplant the Night!

A dim light fell, shearing away a huge portion of the Light of the Six Harmonies he projected. The Heavenly Yuwu spiritual fire immediately surged to fill the gap, lunging toward the general’s face with sinister venom.

Even Touba Ci had to retreat before this Merging Fire, let alone Gongsun Bei. Faced with it, even a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert had to withdraw his power and avoid it, unwilling to risk a Spiritual Artifact against the flames.

But this gave Li Ximing no respite. The halberd wreathed in demonic flames was already upon him.

"BOOM!"

He brought out a bronze basin to defend himself, but it looked frail before the halberd. Touba Ci’s demonic flames were at their absolute peak; it was not something a minor Spiritual Artifact could block. The basin was sent flying with a deafening crash.

The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light at the center of Li Ximing's brow flared, momentarily halting the halberd and erasing some of its demonic fire. But the weapon still fell, carving a massive gash across his waist and abdomen and engulfing half his body in flames.

He choked on a mouthful of blood, his face growing even paler.

The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body in his sleeve desperately worked to weaken the invading demonic qi. Li Ximing barely managed to retreat, but a chill shot through his mind as the Surrogate Body Ascension Art screamed a warning, forcing his head up.

From within the seemingly safe curtain of Merging Fire, a brilliant light suddenly plunged down.

Gongsun Bei had been forced back by the fire time and again, but he wouldn't be denied forever. He had been secretly accumulating power. A blast of extremely condensed Dawn Qi gushed down, and Li Ximing felt a profound sense of crisis.

But his expression remained unchanged. He thrust open his sleeve and revealed an urn.

The Heavenly Nurture Urn!

The moment the Spiritual Treasure appeared, its presence and power changed the battlefield. The urn's mouth was small, but it pulsed with an immense gravitational pull, a veritable Taotie’s maw. It not only swallowed the incoming divine ability and Dawn Qi with ease but turned the tables, attempting to disrupt Gongsun Bei’s own stability.

The general's expression changed. A suspicion in the back of his mind solidified into certainty.

‘I fear Li Zhouwei was never in seclusion on the lake to begin with!’

The events in the Western Sea were widely known; the Heavenly Nurture Urn was no longer a secret. But in Gongsun Bei's mind, all of the Li family's greatest treasures should have been with Li Zhouwei. If Li Ximing had it, it could only mean it had been left to him to defend the lake while Li Zhouwei himself was away.

The surprise on Gongsun Bei’s face lasted only a second. Years of war had made him ruthlessly decisive. In the next instant, a sheet of Dawn Light cut across the world without warning.

The Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform!

The instant the Heavenly Nurture Urn appeared, his entire strategy shifted in a flash of lightning from forcing Li Zhouwei’s hand to annihilating Li Ximing.

As the Dawn Light appeared, Li Ximing felt an unprecedented chill. Every fiber of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body in his sleeve shrieked a warning.

‘Mortal danger!’

Yet his face remained placid. He ignored the threat, even using his brilliant Merging Fire to force back the Profound Qi cultivator. He brought his hands together, and rolling talismans of intertwined crimson and gold began to coalesce in his palms like a newborn star.

"Hm?"

Gongsun Bei seemed to sense something and snapped his head up.

Just as the colossal Treasure Platform was about to crush everything, an intense blaze of Radiant Fire flooded the sky, overwhelming the clear light. Golden threads streamed from the Great Void, freezing the platform in midair.

And from within the crimson radiance, a Daoist Master clad in the crimson robes of Radiant Fire emerged, walking upon the flames. A bead like a Golden Core spun in his hand. Overlapping layers of golden light descended as an invisible qi enveloped the world.

Double Radiance!

The layered golden light shot forward. Though caught by surprise, Gongsun Bei's reaction was swift. A streak of azure-white light flashed across his robes as he moved to evade. But then the invisible qi descended upon him.

Swarm of Light!

The suppressive power of the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument against other Dao paths slowed his movements for a critical instant. The brilliant golden light struck him. His vision went white, and he stumbled back two steps in disorientation.

"This is bad."

The general's expression changed. He fought to regain his balance, not even glancing at the newcomer. He turned his head sharply, desperately calling his jade vase back to protect him.

In the clouds, Li Ximing had already raised his head. Seizing the moment his foe was immobilized, an intense, pure gold light surged from his palms. It tore through the clouds, echoed through the Great Void, and arrived in an instant.

"BOOM!"

The sixth-grade Radiant Fire art: Great Radiance of White Brilliance!

The art was incredibly costly and time-consuming to master, and cumbersome to cast. But it was backed by the grand Dao of Radiant Fire's ascendant position, a convergence of malign and auspicious forces. Its power was first-rate. Years ago, it had pierced straight through Vast Cicada’s magnificent Dharma Body. An ordinary immortal cultivator stood no chance.

Just then, a square seal flew through the air, shielding Gongsun Bei.

Touba Ci!

His eyes were sharp, and he clearly possessed some uncanny perceptive ability; he had been the first to detect Li Ximing when he had crossed the river to scout. He had made his move the instant before the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument appeared, which was the only reason he had arrived in time.

"BOOM!"

But it had been a desperate, hasty defense. The magnificent square seal held for but a single breath before it was shattered. The intense golden light flooded the sky, blasting Gongsun Bei out of the air. He crashed onto the distant lakeshore, kicking up a storm of clouds and Radiant Fire.

"What audacity…"

The man in the feathered, glowing robes didn't spare a single glance for the battered Gongsun Bei on the ground, nor for Li Ximing, who had unleashed the sky-spanning, breathtaking Radiant Fire art. His gaze was fixed dead ahead.

His face was glacial. He caught the searing hot seal in his left hand while his right raised the halberd, its demonic flames burning bright. He forced back the thick Radiant Fire radiating from the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and aimed its tip directly at the crimson-robed youth.

Touba Ci narrowed his eyes, finally getting a clear look at the newcomer's face.

The man had narrow, hooded eyes and a wicked cast to his features, tempered by a superficial gentleness that was both unnerving and unforgettable. A merciless smile played on his lips as he gazed at the halberd pointed at him.

That pair of golden eyes burned like red-hot coals, so bright they stung the eyes. It made the descendant of Great Liang, the Daoist Master of the Touba clan, freeze. An expression of utter disbelief bloomed in his eyes.

‘This is…’
