# Chapter 967, People from the Past

The giant turtle and the soft-shell turtle embraced, black and white light interweaving.

A deep blue, gold-patterned wine vessel shimmered, casting a faint, cold glow. In the center of the scene, a pool of white water rippled with multicolored light. A middle-aged man, draped in a white fur cloak with a precious pearl at his waist, leaned against the pool's edge, his eyes tightly shut.

Three vertical, silver marks flashed between his brows. One hand pressed against the pool as a soft, white, illusory radiance poured down, surging across the water's surface. The Daoist Master began to ponder inwardly,

'I've finally sensed a resonance. Through the Vault-Beam Silver... I should be able to glimpse the things that were placed in that 'locked' state.'

As he was deep in thought, a man descended from the sky, small crimson sparrows circling around him. The man smiled and said,

"Senior Liu!"

Liu Changdie looked up, the radiance of his divine ability gradually dimming. He replied,

"Ximing! You're out of seclusion. How did it go?"

"I made some progress!"

Li Ximing was quite satisfied with the results of his cultivation session and replied with a smile,

"This Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array... how is it?"

Liu Changdie's expression grew solemn. He replied,

"I've also achieved some results... This array... is truly astonishing."

He gently turned his hand, and clusters of light fell into his sleeve. Liu Changdie said seriously,

"Ximing, you know that my Vault Metal Dao Lineage is one of 'hiding and storing.' Harmonising and Vault Lock is a concept with extremely broad symbolism. Most cave-mansions, Grotto-heavens, and Mystic Realms incorporate this 'vault lock' symbolism..."

"This is why when predecessors cast an array over a mountain, later generations can't find it. Minor cultivators, small sects, or even rogue cultivators and demonic cultivators can only find small cave-mansions by pure chance or incredible luck. They shouldn't even dream of finding one at the Purple Mansion Realm level.

"Even if a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of a much higher cultivation base comes searching, they need a confirmed location. They must either use a divine ability or an illusion-breaking technique to probe inch by inch, and only then do they have a chance. To this day, a vast number of predecessor Grotto-mansions and Mystic Realms remain lost."

He said softly,

"And my Vault Metal Dao Lineage, which symbolizes the 'storage' aspect of arrays, has a natural advantage in this. The benefits I've managed to acquire over the years are all related to my Dao Lineage."

"Oh?!"

Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then asked,

"Does that mean you have the ability to break arrays, Senior?"

"Not at all!"

Liu Changdie shook his head.

"Harmonising and Vault Lock is no joke. Too many of Vault Metal's wonders have already been hidden away. I can't 'break' anything; I can only 'see' and 'take.' If you want to talk about array-breaking, that's the domain of Renewing Wood and Manifestations Earth. Although Vault-Beam Silver is closely tied to formations... it doesn't excel at destroying them."

The Wood Virtue in the world is in decline. Of the Wood Dao Lineages today, Horn Wood is the most famous. The only others known are the Si family's Upright Wood and Daoist Master Luo's Gathering Wood. There's been no news of the other two." When Li Ximing heard this, he replied,

"I've heard a little... Renewing Wood... what kind of Dao Lineage is it?"

Liu Changdie shook his head and smiled,

"It's not considered a powerful Dao Lineage, nor is it famous. It's just that those of us who cultivate array formations must remember these few array-breaking Dao Lineages. As for Manifestations Earth, I only noted it specifically because I heard the Viewing Pavilion faction's Array-Foundation Sundering Blades belongs to it.

"Traces of Renewing Wood today can mostly only be found through old Dao Lineage records or the transformations of spiritual items. As for the final Wood, it has vanished without a trace..."

He mentioned the Viewing Pavilion Dao Lineage, lowered his head slightly, and continued,

"As for my Vault Metal, besides being helpful for constructing arrays, I'm currently having Zhaojing take a look at the treasure hidden below."

He pressed one hand on the pool's edge, and his divine ability surged. The pool water immediately boiled and rapidly turned transparent.

The transparency spread, moving from top to bottom, gradually rendering even the white pool floor invisible. Amidst this transformation, a deep, azure-blue light grew increasingly intense.

Liu Changdie took the opportunity to explain,

"Purple Mansion Realm spirit arrays are typically anchored by a Purple Mansion Realm-level spiritual item. Some powerful grand arrays even have several Spiritual Artifacts at their core. Before deployment, these are gathered in the array-disk and can't be seen clearly. Only when the array is active do they roam, occasionally settling into a critical node."

He made a slight grasping motion, as if strenuously seizing something. The transparency beneath him expanded, revealing layer upon layer of intricate array patterns and incantations. Thousands upon thousands of small flags were fixed within the formation.

The small flags, black with white patterns, pulsed with a dense radiance. They were arranged in a tight, swirling vortex, the base of every flag pointing toward the same center.

And at that center, a small, azure-blue orb was held fast by the Vault-Beam Silver divine ability. It emitted a crystal-clear radiance. Streams of Water Mansion power poured into the orb from above, underwent layers of refinement, and were then released anew.

"Hm?"

As this scene materialized, Li Ximing frowned, his expression filled with shock and uncertainty. Liu Changdie was clearly just as surprised. He shot to his feet and exclaimed,

"This..."

The object anchoring this grand array, the item at its critical node, the very source of the Feather Transformation Pool... it wasn't a spiritual item, it was a Spiritual Artifact!

Li Ximing's pupils suddenly dilated.

Although he hadn't taken the azure-blue orb in his hand, its shimmering light and the faint, intricate patterns on its surface were clear to him. It was perfectly integrated with the grand array, likely an item from its master's Dao Lineage. A powerful sense of familiarity washed over him, and he suddenly recalled a name,

'Li Quantao!'

Although this orb was far more magnificent and was a mysterious azure-blue rather than white, it was clearly of the same origin as the Wall Water Pill Li Quantao had possessed all those years ago!

'There must be a connection between them. The Wall Water Pill might even have been crafted in imitation of this very artifact!

'Although Li Ximing hadn't had much contact with the manby the time they properly met, Ximing was already in the Purple Mansion Realm and had no need to associate with himhe had seen that famous dharma artifact all those years ago. He had secretly coveted it, and the sight was burned into his memory!

'How can it be related to him? The Hongxue Sect? The Li Clan?

'No!

A strange light flashed in Li Ximing's eyes as he mentally sifted through every piece of related information. Finally, he remembered.

'The Wall Water Pill is an ancient dharma artifact... it was obtained by Li Encheng from the Secret Enclosure Dao Lineage. It has nothing to do with the Hongxue Li Clan... Which means... tracing it back to its source... the master of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion might be a cultivator from the Secret Enclosure Dao Lineage...

'And according to Brother Zhi (Li Xizhi), the Wall Water Pill was actually an imitation of the Great Liang Martial Emperor's two orbs, Converging Water and Water Mansion. But it only ended up as a dharma artifact. This one before me... this must be the one imitated from the original Dharma Treasure. That Wall Water Pill is just an imitation of an imitation...

'Great Liang and Encompassing Profoundity... I wonder what the connection is?'

While Li Ximing was lost in thought, Liu Changdie was staring intently at the endless vortex of small flags. He scanned them one by one, his astonishment growing, and asked,

"Daoist Friend, do you recognize these flags?!"

Li Ximing glanced over, slightly puzzled, but Liu Changdie said in a heavy tone,

"Years ago, when I went to your esteemed clan to set up an array, I was fortunate enough to be able to study your clan's array flags. They also had white patterns on a black body... That set came from Wan Huaqian and was called the [White Feather Catalpa Flag].

"And the small flags materializing in this array are seventy or eighty percent similar to them!"

"Hm?"

It took Li Ximing a moment to place the name Wan Huaqian. He frowned and said,

"The Wan family ancestor? That array-path genius, Wan Huaqian?"

The Wan family had once been neighbors with the Li Clan; they were, in fact, the first family the Li Clan had encountered. Li Ximing had naturally heard of them. At his words, Liu Changdie nodded hesitantly and sat back down, his expression grim.

"No wonder... no wonder..."

He muttered,

"The master of the inheritance Wan Huaqian received must be inextricably linked to the master of this mansion! The [White Feather Catalpa Flag] was his bonded artifact, forged by his own hand. It's impossible for it to resemble this array for no reason... It seems he really did obtain its legacy..."

Liu Changdie's gaze grew heavy as countless thoughts raced through his mind. Suddenly, he asked,

"Ximing, do you know of the Secret Enclosure Dao Lineage?"

'Just as I thought!'

Li Ximing inwardly understood and replied,

"Of course. It's one of the great secrets of Encompassing Profoundity."

As soon as he said this, Liu Changdie knew he was well-informed. He sighed.

"Exactly... I noted that this array has the distinct style of Encompassing Profoundity. Now, seeing that the orb below is so similar to the Wall Water Pill from the Secret Enclosure Sect, I'm certain they share the same origin...

Liu Changdie pinched his fingers, making a quick calculation. His smile grew stiff as he muttered,

"Wan Huaqian fell over three hundred years ago. Calculating the dates... that seems awfully close to the time when Chi Wei and Li Encheng went to the Secret Enclosure Sect..."

"Ah?"

Li Ximing was stunned. Although he was from Jiangnan, Moongaze Lake was somewhat isolated, different from places like Lixia or Simin, and he heard far fewer rumors. Still, he understood the implication and asked in a low voice,

"Senior, are you implying... the origin of this whole affair might lie with Wan Huaqian?"

Liu Changdie laughed coldly, as if some old rumor had just been confirmed.

"To put it nicely, one might say a great opportunity manifested, allowing Wan Huaqian to obtain the Secret Enclosure inheritance, while the Azure Pond just so happened to find a clue to it. But to put it bluntly, who knows how Chi Wei and Li Encheng _really_ got into that Secret Enclosure Mystic Realm?

"Wan Huaqian was a true prodigy of his generation. He built several incredible arrays, and even a high-level figure from Azure Pond came to see them, proclaiming him a genius. That's what cemented his fame; everyone knew him after that. But don't you think that Azure Pond bigwig went back and reported something? Because soon after, Wan Huaqian diedextremely abruptly, while still in the Foundation Establishment Realm. And right after that, Chi Wei and Li Encheng entered the Secret Enclosure Mystic Realm... Heh heh!"

Li Ximing frowned to himself, listening as Liu Changdie's eyes grew sharp.

"I always heard that the [White Feather Catalpa Flag] was in Li Encheng's possession. When I later came to your clan and found you had a set, I was confused. Thinking about it now... Li Encheng must have obtained several dharma artifacts from the Secret Enclosure, and the rogue cultivators simply mistook the array flags he heldwhich shared the same originfor Wan Huaqian's [White Feather Catalpa Flag].

"The methods of that crowd are the same as always. They use someone up, but they still keep the Wan family around just to see if there are any lingering trump cards. They let them be for a hundred-odd years... Then, only when Chi Wei was near the end of his life, they stopped paying attention and casually cleaned up the potential loose end."

Liu Changdie clearly held a deep loathing for the great powers of Jiangnan and Jiangbei, always assuming the most sinister motives. Li Ximing was more moderate. He felt that while Liu's analysis wasn't entirely objective, it was mostly logical. He could only sigh.

"If Wan Huaqian had kept a low profile back then and hidden his inheritance, perhaps he could have carved out his own path."

Liu Changdie merely waved his hand dismissively, his gaze fixed on the Spiritual Artifact at the base of the array.

"This is a remarkable treasure down here. I can retrieve it, but doing so would destroy the Feather Transformation Pool."

The Feather Transformation Pool was critical to them right now, and Li Ximing was naturally unwilling to sacrifice it. He pondered for a moment before asking,

"If, one day... I need to remove that Spiritual Artifact for use, could I replace it with a Water Mansion spiritual item? Even if the Feather Transformation Pool dissipates, could we at least preserve the grand array and prevent it from collapsing?"

Liu Changdie stared intently at the array, thinking for a long time before replying,

"It would be very difficult right now. But give me a few decades to master this array formation, and I might be able to make some modifications. By then, we might find a much better solution."

"Good!"

Li Ximing nodded in delight.

"I'll go retrieve the clan's [White Feather Catalpa Flag] for you to study, Senior!"

...

Azure Pond Peak was shrouded in clouds and mist, Pristine Water drifting on the breeze. The faint sound of a spring could be heard. The Sect Master's Hall was empty. Only after crossing the wide courtyard could one see a lone figure sitting on the steps.

He was a middle-aged man with small eyes and a long face, possessing the general air of a sect disciple. At this moment, however, his face was etched with worry, his eyes filled with anxiety. He sat forlornly on the steps, completely at a loss.

This was the current Sect Master of the Azure Pond Sect, Lin Wuning.

Lin Wuning himself wasn't particularly capable; he really only knew how to cultivate. He normally relied on the support of the Ning Clan and Li Yuanqin to maintain stability. But ever since Ning Wan had entered seclusion, the Ning Clan had fallen into disarray. And now that Li Yuanqin had also entered seclusion for his breakthrough, Lin Wuning hadn't known a single day of peace.

He should have forced Li Yuanqin to stay, but Li Yuanqin's talent was considerable. He had served diligently for many years, never once shirking his duties. His scheduled breakthrough date had already been postponed year after year. Now, at this critical juncture, it simply couldn't be delayed any further, and Lin Wuning had no choice but to let him go.

The moment Li Yuanqin left, the Ning Clan began running around like headless chickens. In the past, Lin Wuning only had to give an order, and Li Yuanqin would handle it efficiently. Now that he had to manage things himself, he was completely overwhelmed.

Just now, he had unrolled the scroll in his hand and read a report from Qin Xian, requesting a transfer to the Eastern Sea.

Qin Xian was from the Si family. With Li Yuanqin absent, Lin Wuning was already nursing a headache, trying to figure out how to respond to the request. Suddenly, he heard footsteps approaching the hall. He looked up quickly, only to see Qin Xian himself approaching, his face grim. He rushed in from the mountain path without so much as a greeting.

"You!"

Lin Wuning shot to his feet in alarm, but he caught a flash of contempt in Qin Xian's eyes as the man stepped lightly to the side, assuming the posture of one welcoming a guest.

The anger that flared in Lin Wuning's chest was immediately extinguished by the gesture, replaced by shock and suspicion.

'What is this? Which Daoist Master has arrived?'

But before he could react, he froze, staring dumbfounded.

A man in green robes was strolling up the mountain path. He had a middle-aged appearance, with a square face and a long nose, but his steps were light and carefree. A longsword was strapped to his back, a scroll was tied at his waist, and he was gazing at Lin Wuning with a smile.

A divine ability's radiance, so dense it had not yet been retracted, still pulsed around him. It caused the trees on the peak to stir, as if they were standing in a vast forest. Illusory mulberry leaves seemed to fall from the sky, drifting past his sleeves.

His mere presence on the path commanded all attention, as if he were seated on a throne of honor. The divine ability he exuded was steady and orthodox, the mark of a high-level cultivator from a major immortal sect.

Lin Wuning felt as if he had been struck by lightning. His mind went blank. He finally understood Qin Xian's smugness. His legs gave way, and he collapsed to his knees with a thud, crying out in terror,

"Greetings... Daoist Master!"
