# Chapter 769: Deeper into the Mist

Moongaze Lake.

A black shadow flashed past. The man, clad in dark robes, raced forward on the wind, leaving a chilling trail of gray mist in the air. He wore the Supreme Feather Night-robe, an artifact adorned with foot-long black tassels that shimmered with iridescent light at their tips, accelerating his speed with every moment.

To put it bluntly, the Supreme Feather Night-robe was the finest Dharma artifact the Li clan possessed. Li Xizhi had exhausted countless resources to acquire it; it was doubtful a better robe could be found in all of Jiangnan among those beneath the Purple Mansion Realm.

The two-finger-long piece of black jade in his hand was unremarkable, appearing merely as an impure trinket. But Li Chenghuai knew this Night Ghost Secret Talisman was far more extraordinary.

The rest of the Li family believed the talisman could only summon an entity at the Foundation Establishment level. Li Chenghuai, however, understood it was a genuine ancient artifact capable of far more than just summoning a night-ghost. Its true potential was simply beyond his current level of cultivation.

Soon, the landscape of Funan came into view. The sky above it was a blazing mix of red and white flames. Li Chenghuai pushed his speed, riding the wind until his form blurred and faded like water.

Li Minggong stood in mid-air holding her brazier, spiritual fire surging to block Guan Lingdie. Nearby, Miaoshui, Elder White Ape, and even Qu Bushi were locked in desperate combat. Clearly outnumbered, the Li allies were pale and hard-pressed.

'My brother isn't here...' Li Chenghuai mused. 'Li Chenghui must have gone to rescue Ding Weizeng.'

He retrieved the black jade from his sleeve, placed it in his palm, and tossed it lightly into the air.

A fierce gale erupted. Swirling motes of yin qi coalesced into a dancing vortex of blackness, from which a magnificent, horned yaksha emerged. Wielding a trident of dark energy, it charged straight into the ranks of the Capital immortals Dao.

The yaksha possessed considerable power. It dissolved into black mist and descended upon the cultivators, immediately unleashing a frigid wave of energy that disrupted their techniques. It followed by sweeping its trident, throwing the Capital immortals Dao formation into chaos.

Li Chenghuai himself materialized from the shadows directly beside Guan Lingdie, his own sword drawn, unleashing a brilliant white slash of sword-light as large as a ship's sail.

Startled, Guan Lingdie’s form dissipated like smoke. Li Chenghuai shook his robes, his own body flickering as he prepared to pursue, when a soft voice sounded next to his ear.

"Little brother, no need to be so fierce!"

Li Chenghuai instantly recognized the voice of his elder sister, Li Minggong. Though shocked, his reflexes were sharp; he immediately slowed his attack by half a beat, letting the sword-light strike empty air as he sent back a spiritual transmission: "What is..."

Li Minggong, who had already formed suspicions, replied concisely, "The Capital immortals Dao is merely going through the motions. Their real goal was to destroy the Profound Peak Gate's foundation. Now that it's come to this, there's no need to fight them to the death. Just keep them occupied."

Understanding dawned on Li Chenghuai. He engaged, coordinating his attacks. His techniques and swordplay were fundamentally sound, and he pressed the assault. Guan Lingdie, now facing two opponents, likewise fell back, refusing to be drawn into a desperate fight.

Guan Lingdie was the stronger cultivator; even when holding back as if in a spar, she had completely suppressed Li Minggong. Now, with the pressure relieved, Li Minggong finally had a moment to think. The Capital immortals Dao's peculiar attitude, combined with the words of Daoist Master Tinglan, rushed back to her.

'If the real enemy isn't the Capital immortals Dao, but Changxiao trying to destroy my family... was chasing our Daoist Master out to sea truly his only plan?'

She poured spiritual qi into the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier. Flames mixed with the distinct red-and-white down of Pure Feather Li-Fire billowed forth.

'Based on what Daoist Master Tinglan implied... Changxiao probably hasn't returned either. But if he orchestrated this plot long ago, seeking something our family possesses... wouldn't this be the moment for that plot to manifest?'

'If that's the case, the Daoist Master who disguised himself as Sumian is almost certainly the other Purple Mansion cultivator from Changxiao Gate: Daoist Master Chengyan!'

Daoist Master Chengyan was famous for never emerging from seclusion, but given the circumstances, it wasn't unreasonable for him to finally appear. Li Minggong’s nerves tightened. 'What instructions did Changxiao leave for Chengyan? That Daoist Master came here to gather intelligence; he must be about to act!'

She felt lost in a dense fog, unable to see the path clearly.

'Is defending Funan the right move or the wrong one? But even if we abandon this place and retreat to the north bank... as long as our Daoist Master doesn't return, will we ever know peace? It just means moving the target for their schemes back to the north bank!'

***

Elsewhere over Funan, the sky was heavy and dark. Fierce winds howled as golden light clashed with resounding cracks of thunder.

Li Chenghui stood amidst the storm, his robes billowing as he held his long spear horizontally, treading upon bolts of lightning. Thunder descended from the heavens, striking the air before him and condensing into a torrential waterfall of lightning that crashed downward.

He had arrived riding the thunder, catching them by surprise. Descending from the sky with the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman, he had struck down a Golden Tang Gate guest elder with nine consecutive bolts to rescue Ding Weizeng. Now, besides Situ Mo himself, the Golden Tang Gate still had three other Foundation Establishment cultivators clustered around their leader, jointly fending off Ding Weizeng.

This was Li Chenghui’s first time fighting Situ Mo directly. Although his Dao lineage held no specific advantage, his artifacts countered the Golden Tang Gate’s techniques. By joining forces with Ding Weizeng, they managed to suppress the group.

Now, Li Chenghui beckoned. The six punishment talismans immediately spun around his wrist, unleashing a gushing wave of silvery-white brilliance. "Where Yang culminates, the Six Thunders are born!"

A blinding flash erupted as runes lit up sequentially on the six slender, elegant tokens. In response, Situ Mo casually tossed out a golden shield.

*BOOM!*

Billowing black smoke surged from the impact. Fortunately, the golden shield was not an artifact powered by blood-qi and managed to hold. Situ Mo instantly drew his saber, blocking the thunder spear that shot out from the smoke with a sharp *CLANG*.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

Li Cheng’s thunder spear danced, each blow seemingly suppressing the Golden Tang Gate Master, yet Li Chenghui’s expression was far from relaxed.

'What is Situ Mo playing at...'

This was too strange. The man fighting him now was not performing at the level expected of the Golden Tang Gate Master. Situ Mo was a veteran Foundation Establishment cultivator who had long ago begun practicing secret arts. Even with the Chongming Profound Insight Screen high above suppressing his golden needles and saber, he should never be such an easy opponent.

Li Chenghui’s gaze darkened. The Gate Master opposite him seemed almost dazed. His sister had always described Situ Mo as "suspicious, cunning, sinister, and venomous," yet the man before him today was merely a silent, detached warrior.

Nearby, Ding Weizeng was growing deeply uneasy. He had dealt with Situ Mo many times, had even fought him, and knew the man well. The eyes that should have been brimming with malice and cunning were utterly changed, replaced by a silent, detached calm that set Ding Weizeng on edge.

He sent a covert transmission: 'Lord Chenghui, I fear this man is plotting something...'

Li Chenghui replied, suspicious, 'You all claim he is treacherous and unpredictable. If he were scheming, why would he act this way and deliberately arouse our suspicion?'

While the two allies grew suspicious, Situ Mo simply rode his golden light, weaving through the wind to meet the rain of lightning. He circulated his power, only for the bronze-green light of the screen in the sky to shine down, locking his two primary artifacts in mid-air, rendering them immobile.

Forced to rely only on hand seals, Situ Mo released bursts of light to counter the thunder. It was a dull, frustrating fight, yet his face remained blank as he silently endured the assault.

Situ Mo had been fighting the Li clan since the era of Li Yuanjiao. He had been at the Foundation Establishment Realm far longer than most; he was an elder of the same generation as Li Xuanxuan. To be suppressed by Li Chenghui—a junior among juniors—using an external artifact should have been a pathetic, shameful humiliation. Yet Situ Mo merely watched in silence.

When Situ Mo set out today, he had received three flying letters, all dispatched from the Great Void. Two ordered him to kill Li Chenghui. The third ordered him to kill Ding Weizeng, specifically to force Li Zhouwei to show himself.

Accompanying the letters were two items: a gray rope etched with patterns of mountains, edged in gold, and surrounded by a faint white halo; and a purple talisman that shimmered like rippling violet water, radiating an unfathomable power. It was ice-cold to the touch, a chill that pierced straight to his soul.

He could not decipher the purple talisman, but the gray rope... Situ Mo knew the gray rope all too well. He had read of it countless times. It was the prized treasure of his clan’s own Daoist Master, Situ Huo. A Purple Mansion-grade Spirit Artifact: The Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope!

His clan’s Daoist Master, Situ Huo, was exiled overseas, his status—living or dead—unknown. Rumors claimed his Dharma Body had been severely wounded—some said by the elements, others by an enemy—and that he had lost an arm, forcing him into hiding, never daring to return. Why would *he* get involved in this mess? What possible reason could he have?

Situ Mo had skirmished with the Li clan for years, always carefully dancing along the edge of the established rules. He recalled the time on Jindou Island, when Li Xuanfeng waited in the waters with his bow drawn, forcing Situ Mo to hide, paralyzed, on the island. In truth, the terror he felt then paled in comparison to this.

Since its third generation, the Golden Tang Gate had seen countless masters die suddenly, commit suicide, or be assassinated by their own kin. Situ Mo was a product of this environment; he himself had killed his own brother to take his position. To have survived in the cracks for this long, his insight was sharp. He understood the current situation perfectly.

'Today, the only person who can kill a direct descendant of the Li clan—and do so *within the rules*—is me.'

The Li clan’s backing was Li Ximing, who was away. The Situ clan clung to existence thanks to Situ Huo, who was also away. At this precise moment, no one was more suitable for this task than Situ Mo.

In terms of motive, his enmity with the Li clan was deep. In terms of status, he too was the descendant of a Purple Mansion cultivator. He was the perfect hot potato—dangerous to touch, difficult to discard. The only difference between him and Li Chenghui was that Situ Huo placed no value on the Golden Tang Gate.

'Once I kill Li Chenghui, who will Li Ximing seek vengeance against? The Golden Tang Gate, a faction with only a few weaklings left, who could simply seal their mountain and play dead? Will he target Changxiao? Or Yehui? Did the powers who sent this artifact and this talisman not consider this?'

'But what about *me*? Did they expect me to calmly return to the Golden Tang Gate and enter seclusion for my next breakthrough? Impossible!'

The gold-armored man stood coldly, seemingly suppressed and unable to break free, but internally he was frozen, as if clutching a bone-chilling dagger, utterly paralyzed by indecision.

Yes, the Golden Tang Gate possessed a Purple Mansion-grade formation, but what good was it? The formation core was sealed by a higher power, rendered inert. It wasn't just the Golden Feather Sect that held a jade key to the array; the Azure Pond Sect and the Yue Cultivating Sect had keys as well. That grand formation offered Situ Mo no protection at all.

The moment he used this Purple Mansion Spirit Artifact to kill Li Chenghui, a Daoist Master from the Golden Feather Sect would likely arrive. They would kill him to appease the Li clan, and secondly, they would seize the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope for themselves. They wouldn't show an ounce of mercy.

'But if I *don't* kill him...' he thought, 'I will have accepted gifts from two Purple Mansion cultivators while defying the orders of three. Who under heaven will grant me refuge then?'

Situ Mo had considered handing the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope over to the Golden Feather Sect, begging to survive in the cracks. But he knew that at this very moment, the entire scene over the Tangdao Mountain Range was falling under the gaze of the Golden Feather Sect. Their utter silence was, itself, an obvious answer.

'Daoist Master Qiushui has been in seclusion for years, leaving Daoist Master Tianhuo to manage the sect... That Daoist Master has already given his tacit approval. Perhaps... perhaps one of those three letters came directly from him!'

No matter how he looked at it, Situ Mo was the Golden Feather Sect’s dog. If the sect hadn't approved this, who would dare make such a move?!

Situ Mo gripped the Spirit Artifact in his sleeve. Time ticked by, second by agonizing second, as if counting down the last moments of his life. The man finally lifted his sleeve and hissed, "Li Chenghui!"

The man opposite him glanced over. Li Chenghui's eyes were sharp and dazzling, like twin points of ink, with arcs of lightning crawling across his robes. Situ Mo stared at him, momentarily lost, grinding his teeth so hard they audibly cracked.

'There is only one path to survival... only one path...'

Li Chenghui watched the man opposite him. Situ Mo’s golden robes whipped in the wind, pulsing with metallic light. The man was clearly over-agitated; his sharp, white teeth were bared, and his body seemed to hunch over as strange, guttural sounds escaped his throat.

'Gold resides in Geng-Xin... Earth forms mountains... that which is baleful shall be bound...'

Li Chenghui sensed the danger and retreated a step. At that exact moment, Situ Mo snapped his head up and let out a guttural roar: "HAA!"

Time seemed to slow. Li Chenghui watched clearly as a gray rope snaked out of Situ Mo's sleeve. It was covered in overlapping mountain patterns, edged in gold, and surrounded by a faint white halo. As it appeared, the light around them instantly dimmed.

*BANG!*

The Chongming Profound Insight Screen high above shuddered as if struck, recoiling with a dull boom. Its suppressing light vanished. Instantly, the massive swarm of golden needles and the school of fish-like daggers were released, screaming through the air as they shot downward.

In the next instant, the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talismans that hovered around Li Chenghui exploded outward, blasted apart and scattering in every direction. The lightning they had generated held back the gray rope for a fraction of a second before being utterly annihilated.

"A Spirit Artifact!"

Li Chenghui's mind screamed the warning, but the rope moved like the wind. It coiled like a clever serpent, instantly leaping onto his long spear.

Although Li Chenghui was one of the Li clan’s top cultivators and his spear was a Foundation Establishment-grade artifact, it was merely standard issue—nothing compared to Li Qinghong’s Duruo Spear. But even if he held the Duruo, it would have made little difference against a true Spirit Artifact.

With a sickening *thud*, the lightning on his spear vanished and all spiritual qi dissipated. The gray rope bound the weapon tightly, then flicked, contemptuously sweeping the spear toward the ground.

But that brief instant was all Li Chenghui needed. He summoned a palm-sized, ornate bronze mirror from his sleeve. Its rim was carved with two rings depicting galloping beasts. It was the Bronze-Winged Brightwhite.

This was the mirror artifact recovered from the Capital immortals Dao. Though ornate, its quality was not high—only slightly better than his spear. It leaped forward and struck the gray rope. A sharp *TANG* rang out as the mirror was sent flying backward, emitting agonizing, cracking sounds.

But the desperate blocks had not been useless. Ding Weizeng, who was close by, was already swinging his staff to intercept. Crucially, Li Chenghui had bought himself just enough time. He opened his mouth and drew a mote of brilliant white light from his internal Thunder Pool.

"Secret Art of the Purple Talisman’s Primal Light!"
