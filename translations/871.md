# Chapter 871: Yan Hu

Li Ximing accepted the jade slip. A quick scan revealed only about a hundred thousand new characters had been added. He turned his head and asked:

"If you enter seclusion at Zongquan, the spiritual veins will still be insufficient. Fortunately, I have a [Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill]. Seal it within a spirit formation and use spirit stones and other resources to catalyze its spiritual energy. That should suffice for your needs."

Li Zhouwei acknowledged this and replied in a low voice, "Zongquan is, after all, territory of the Zhu South Mansion Water. With our connections to both Dingjiao and the Thunder Pool, it is the safest possible location. Daoist Master, please rest assured."

Having considered this, he untied the Profound Pattern Vase from his waist and placed it in Li Ximing’s hands. "This spirit artifact has been refined for many years, and its power is immense," he explained. "In the hands of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, any opponent it strikes—even a direct disciple of the Three Great Sects—will be left dead or crippled. It would be better to entrust it to Jiangqian and Li Que'wan for their protection."

"Good."

Li Ximing was perhaps the only person who understood the true source of the vase's power. The materials of the Profound Pattern Vase were astonishing, but only his Valley Wind Guide-Fire ability could continuously enhance its might. He accepted the item without further comment.

Li Zhouwei mulled it over and added, "Regarding our two direct descendants at Purple Smoke: Li Quexi's cultivation technique is superior, so she receives more attention. Although Li Queyi is the elder sister, her personality is gentle, and she cultivates the Jade True technique. Purple Smoke inevitably overlooks her somewhat, which worries the family."

Li Ximing listened, recalling a vague impression of the situation. He watched Li Zhouwei salute and depart. As the great formation closed, Li Ximing transformed into a streak of light and flew away, sighing internally.

'That settles one matter. But this Profound Pattern Vase... I must be careful. If I continue refining it indefinitely, I can no longer conveniently gift it to someone else.'

The Profound Pattern Vase was, after all, inscribed with the name 'Li Qianyuan.' The Li family knows it is a powerful artifact. If Li Ximing keep refining it until a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator can wield power approaching the Purple Mansion Realm, it will undoubtedly attract unwanted attention.

'The other great families are sharp-eyed; I cannot underestimate them. Either I stop enhancing it at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm and then bestow it, or I keep it for my own use. After all, such power is far less dangerous—and appears far more reasonable—in the hands of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.'

As his own strength increased, the efficacy of his Valley Wind Guide-Fire grew exponentially. It was largely thanks to this ability that Li Ximing's alchemy skills advanced at lightning speed, free from worry. His profound fire control techniques were now likely known even within the Supreme Yang Dao, and this growing reputation conveniently served to mask the truth of the Profound Pattern Vase.

'Since it must coordinate with Talisman Qi, acquiring a Purple Mansion spiritual flame is also critical to increasing my strength. But with the flourishing of water and fire elements, spiritual flames are certainly no cheaper than spiritual artifacts. Some of the rarest ones are worth even more.'

He traversed the Great Void above the Eastern Sea on his way back. Wary that Changxiao might intercept him mid-journey, he skirted the coastline of the Eastern Sea until he reached Lin'an Prefecture. From there, he cut through the territory of the Great Xiukui Monastery, bypassed Tiger's Frontier, and soon the Purple Smoke Blessed Land came into view.

He still had alchemy-related questions for Tinglan, but he estimated she was still in seclusion and could not be disturbed. Since no one else in the sect possessed her specific legacy, he couldn't ask anyone else. However, since he was already here, he might as well show his concern.

Secondly, his clan's two direct descendants were cultivating in this blessed land. Li Ximing felt he should at least see them. He brought two Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pills with him, stopping at the blessed land intending to pay a visit.

As expected, the one who came to greet him was Qian Lizi of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. She was exceptionally beautiful in her purple dress, flanked by cultivators who bowed deeply. In Qian Lizi's eyes, Li Ximing had rushed back specifically for the sake of Purple Smoke. Deeply grateful, she thanked him twice before saying, "The blessed land will forever remember the Daoist Master's aid. Please, take the seat of honor!"

Li Ximing nodded. Following them inside, he indeed saw a young woman waiting amidst the Purple Smoke. She possessed a refined beauty and a tranquil, detached aura. A sword was fastened at her waist, and she wore a round, gold-backed, pale blue artifact around her neck. Her eyes were bright as she bowed and said softly, "Li Quexi pays respects to the Daoist Master."

Li Ximing glanced at her, reasonably satisfied. As expected of the Supreme Yang Dao, the artifacts Li Quexi wore were vastly superior to those of the descendants back at the lake. "Your cultivation is fast," he remarked. "You have already reached Qi Refining."

Qian Lizi signaled, and Li Quexi moved to wait respectfully by Li Ximing’s side. "Reporting to the Daoist Master," she said deferentially, "this junior consumed the [Purple Smoke Cloud-Cliff Qi]. I have now received the peak's secret talisman and have entered the area beneath the Purple Terrace to cultivate."

This was treatment reserved for inner disciples of the Purple Smoke Gate, most of whom were already Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. For Li Quexi to enter while only at the Qi Refining stage was clearly a gesture of goodwill resulting from Li Ximing's intervention.

Li Ximing nodded, saying nothing more. Instead, he looked directly into her eyes and asked, "Where is your sister?"

The Profound Light in his eyes was penetrating. Even Qian Lizi hesitated, daring not to interject. Li Quexi respectfully replied, "Sister Queyi is cultivating in the Eastern Sea. My Eldest disciple-brother is also there. According to his reports... Sister Queyi's cultivation is progressing well. She is already at the sixth level of Qi Refining."

Hearing this, Li Ximing nodded silently. He immediately understood that the two sisters were not close, and he sighed inwardly. 'It makes sense... After a long separation, even blood brothers grow distant, let alone Li Quexi, whose very name implies she was brought to the Island much later. I cannot expect the two of them to be perfectly united...'

Qian Lizi quickly interjected, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, my Daoist Master is waiting for you on the platform..."

"Oh?" This genuinely surprised Li Ximing. He said no more, ascending the steps and vanishing into the swirling Purple Smoke.

Qian Lizi remained where she was. After a long moment, she sighed, leading Li Quexi back. "Sixth level is sixth level. Why did you have to mention your disciple-brother? It only highlights that you sisters do not correspond and have grown estranged."

Li Quexi bowed in apology. "Master... The Daoist Master possesses divine abilities. I answer what he asks; I say what there is to be said. The clan gave me life, the sect raised me; I hold gratitude for both. He is a Daoist Master, after all. There is nothing I should hide from the Daoist Master."

Qian Lizi could only shake her head helplessly. "You and your Eldest disciple-brother perhaps share the same mentality, yet your actions are diametrically opposed. Very well, go. Return to your cultivation..."

...

The purple mist drifted ethereal.

When Li Ximing stepped onto the Purple Smoke platform, Tinglan was indeed standing there. She was not wearing her usual autumn-yellow dress, having changed into loose-fitting purple robes that lent her an ethereal air. More importantly, her complexion was ruddy; she looked completely unharmed.

But when Li Ximing looked using the Profound Light between his brows, he faintly perceived a purple token. He knew instantly that the Tinglan before him was an apparition reliant on a spiritual artifact, not her true body.

Even so, such a wondrous technique still astonished Li Ximing. "What an incredible spiritual artifact!"

Tinglan smiled, making no effort to hide it. "This is the [Transit Token]," she said openly. "It is a spiritual artifact gifted to our sect's founder by that eminent figure from Cultivation Transcendence. It now qualifies as an ancient spiritual artifact. While it possesses no offensive capabilities, it can project a likeness across distances. As long as the Great Void remains stable, it can manifest this double from a hundred li away."

'So it does have a distance limitation...'

Given that transmitting one's voice was currently more difficult than at any other point in history, this spiritual artifact would be unbelievably useful if it lacked a distance restriction. But as Li Ximing considered it, he realized something even more profound. "Fellow Daoist, this means you are healing..."

"Correct." Tinglan's attitude was much warmer than when they first met. She spoke softly, "With this spiritual artifact, I can simultaneously heal, read scriptures, and manage the sect. The only thing I cannot do is actively cultivate."

"How remarkable!" Li Ximing nodded in amazement. He retrieved the Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pills from his sleeve. "You are injured, after all. I was worried, so I brought some medicine. These two were refined using Pristine Water; the effect is quite potent..."

Tinglan accepted them and chuckled. "You are too courteous. Is there something you need my help with?"

Li Ximing sighed. "It concerns that treasure pill, the [Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill]. Your alchemy records are profound. I learned much from refining that pill, and I was considering refining similar pills myself. Although I lack a treasure like the [Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness], I can attempt similar elixirs. That is when I recalled what you said long ago."

"You mentioned it should be consumed when breaking through to the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. I am unsure why... and I wondered if there is an auxiliary method involved..."

"Ah, so it was about this." Tinglan smiled. "Wait here."

She dispatched someone, who returned from the repository with a jade slip. She handed it generously to Li Ximing. "This is the method that accompanies the pill formula. It's a consumption technique summarized by our predecessors; there are different ways to take it at different stages. It isn't *required* that one takes it at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough, it's just that this specific stage ensures the least medicinal power is wasted, and the foundation is not yet so rigid that it cannot be altered. Zhaojing just needs to follow the variations described within."

The [Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill] came with its own specialized method for improving one's immortal foundation. Normally, the Purple Smoke Gate would never give such a thing away freely. This was, he assumed, repayment for his previous favors.

Li Ximing was indeed planning to improve Li Minggong's Dao foundation, and he possessed more than one [Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill]. He thanked Tinglan. The woman replied, "I heard about the matter in the north. The Great Xiukui Monastery cannot lower itself to intervene directly. Things having reached this point... this is the only outcome."

Li Ximing now understood that the "one in the north" was Li Qianyuan. He dared not say much, only replying, "I apologize for troubling Fairy Qiuhu. I must refine a spirit embryo in the coming years, and I also have new insights requiring seclusion. I cannot participate in the affairs of the north..."

He considered this carefully. Recalling his earlier thoughts about the spiritual flame and feeling the pinch of resources, he decided it would be a waste not to ask while he had the chance. He deliberately mentioned, "Here in Jiangnan, it is hard enough just to find treasure medicines. Where would one find natural Purple Mansion-level spirit items? ...Even Foundation Establishment-level materials are difficult to obtain. If I need Purple Mansion resources and spiritual flames for alchemy... I don't know where I would even begin to look."

"Since I achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, I have never once discovered Purple Mansion resources, which makes alchemy very inconvenient..."

Tinglan shook her head. "That is indeed a troublesome matter. Purple Mansion resources and spiritual flames cannot be found in ordinary places. Although Jiangnan has abundant spiritual qi, it is also teeming with cultivators. Any location with decent spiritual veins or earth veins was claimed for cultivation long ago. How could anything have the time to mature?"

"If you wish to acquire Purple Mansion items, there are only two places nearby: the Eastern Sea and the Southern Borderlands. The Dragon-kin are tyrannical and difficult to negotiate with. The Southern Borderlands, however, are covered in countless mountains."

"Furthermore, the Southern Borderlands extend continuously to the southwest, following the coast to the nation of Shendu. If you cross the gorge there, you will find a vast, uninhabited jungle, easily the size of the Wuyue region. This all belongs to the territory of the Southern Borderlands Demon Kings. Most of the Daoist traditions in Wuyue maintain contact with the Southern Borderlands. They rely on them to scrape together Purple Mansion spirit items—after all, humans are masters of a hundred crafts, making trade convenient for both sides."

She added a reminder, "Isn't Quanwu Mountain very close to my blessed land? The demon races call it the 'Mountain of Exiles.' Many of the Demon beasts inside fled from the Southern Borderlands. Find a useful one. Have him go to the Southern Borderlands to gather information and facilitate trades for you. It won't be efficient, but year after year, you are bound to gain something."

This advice caused sudden realization for Li Ximing. He nodded repeatedly. "That is a truly brilliant idea. It is the Southern Borderlands, after all. No matter which human I send, they won't have the convenience of a Demon beast. And because they would be native to the region, they will already understand the customs and the Demon Kings..."

"Exactly," Tinglan said casually. "Especially in recent years. The northern Southern Borderlands border Jiangnan, and they are jointly influenced by the current spiritual aura—the [Inward Heart Surging Profundity]. The twelve lucid qis are causing the virtue of fire to swell. Whether it's spirit materials or spiritual flames, this is the most flourishing time for them. The aura in the southern Southern Borderlands is influenced by Shitang; it is the [Jia-Yi Configuration] of the Upright Wood spiritual aura. There will be no shortage of spirit medicines either!"

After saying this, Tinglan added a warning, "This spiritual aura will only last for so many years. Right now is the perfect time for your needs. Send someone to inquire as soon as possible. Every day you wait is one less day of collection time!"

Li Ximing nodded emphatically. 'It's a good thing I asked. If I had waited until something happened involving the True Monarch, or the Great Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery fell, or someone else broke through, the spiritual aura would shift. I would have missed this opportunity entirely!'

He indicated that he understood. Tinglan saw him out, her expression fraught with worry, clearly still preoccupied with the affairs in Jiangbei.

Li Ximing, however, did not delay. He traveled as a streak of light, passing the Purple Smoke Blessed Land and calculating the route. It was only a short jump to Quanwu Mountain, located in the center of Yue State.

The number of Demon beasts on Quanwu Mountain had increased significantly in recent years, most of them refugees from the Southern Borderlands. Although they were primarily Foundation Establishment-level demons, most possessed some skill. This place, which had once been the backyard where Azure Pond vanquished demons, was now neglected. Looking down from above, one could see demonic smoke rolling everywhere.

Most Demon beasts in the Eastern Sea had powerful backings, and the outer-sea demons kept their heads down. Only Azure Pond had access to such a treasure trove. Li Ximing himself was running low on Essence Gathering Pills and also needed materials for sacrificial rites. He descended as a beam of light, landing on the mountain range's peak.

Black light flickered from the highest Demon Cave. It appeared two Demon beasts were in the middle of a vicious fight. Amidst the roiling black smoke, a dog demon cultivator, his hair and beard standing on end, was locked in a desperate battle with a Bei demon that had taken human form.

Li Ximing assessed them in a glance. The dog demon was faring poorly; the opposing Bei demon had the upper hand and was still maintaining its human shape. Its bloody aura was horrific, a clear sign it had devoured countless humans. Li Ximing materialized as the Profound Light, standing firm within the surging black wind.

Both demons paled. Li Ximing wasted no words. He raised his hand and casually lifted. The Bei demon was instantly forced back into its true form, falling into his grasp, immobilized. The dog demon immediately became as docile as a chicken. "Milord!" it yelped. "We were instructed by Great King Hu! We have not eaten any humans!"

Li Ximing didn't care about some 'King Hu' or 'King Mao.' He asked casually, "Oh? This senior lackey you speak of... did he flee from the Southern Borderlands?"

The dog demon scrambled to reply, "Milord's divine abilities are all-knowing! Great King Hu did indeed flee from the Southern Borderlands. He was guided by a great personage from Moongaze Lake, and thus renounced his evil ways! He occupies a peak on this mountain, accumulating merit and protecting the common people..."

'He's using my family's name!' This was no small matter. Li Ximing paused, his interest finally piqued. A faint smile touched his lips. "Good, good. Which peak is he on?"

The dog demon had been speaking without confidence; few demons on Quanwu Mountain actually believed the tiger king's claims. It only hoped to escape. Hearing the question, it sold out its great king without hesitation, pointing in a specific direction. But before it knew what was happening, the world spun, and it was instantly transported to the location it had indicated.

A dark void lay ahead, lit only by two points of light. Clearly, they hadn't just arrived *on* the peak; they were already deep inside the Demon Cave.

'A divine ability... This is the Purple Mansion Realm...'

Li Ximing glanced at the cavern door and lifted his chin. The dog demon, dripping sweat, hurried forward, pushed the door open, and immediately knelt to the side. A cold voice barked from within: "Why do you enter without announcing!"

Seated on the central throne was a broad-faced, black-haired middle-aged man. His features were domineering. He wore dark robes, and a pure white long spear stood beside him. His dark pupils glared from beneath furrowed brows.

The iridescent light of a divine ability instantly reflected in those dark pupils.

In the next instant, the middle-aged man tumbled heavily from his throne. He rolled several times across the ground, his robes falling away and the white spear clattering beside him. He shuffled forward on his knees, his voice dripping with subservience. "This lowly demon... this lowly demon Yan Hu pays his respects to the Daoist Master! Respects to the Divine Ability! This one failed to welcome you; this one is too ashamed to rise!..."

Yan Hu recognized the Demon beast dangling from the cultivator's hand at a glance. He had fought that rival for decades. Not only had Yan Hu been unable to defeat him, but he had also been pushed into increasingly dire straits. Yet now, in the blink of an eye, that rival was utterly finished!

The Daoist Master before him swept his gaze over Yan Hu, and the mere look caused the demon to ache with phantom pain. His life rested on this person's whim. Terrified, Yan Hu forced the bitter words out: "This lowly demon... this lowly demon has some dealings with a master from Moongaze Lake... This one has never eaten humans! Please, Daoist Master, for their sake, spare this lowly life..."

The Daoist Master in the white and gold robes chuckled. "Do tell... I was unaware that anyone from *my* lake was interacting with you."

This sentence plunged the cavern into silence. The Demon beast finally realized the truth: 'This is Daoist Master Zhaojing!'

The tiger demon broke out in a cold sweat. Racking his brain, he kowtowed repeatedly. "Years ago... years ago, Daoist Qinghong from the lake came to Quanwu and offered this lowly demon guidance in combat! This demon benefited immensely, grateful beyond words, and offered a [Blood-Dawn Fruit] in return... But the master did not leave a name, only claiming to be from the north and that we might meet again... This lowly demon yearned for that day, but never knew the master's origin..."

"Later, the master's reputation shook the world, and thunder pealed over the river. Only when I heard the news did I realize it was the Daoist from the lake... Since then, I have waited day and night, diligently awaiting the master's return..."

'Blood-Dawn Fruit...' Li Ximing actually remembered the name of that spirit fruit.

Back when the Li family had not yet risen and was still destitute, they had sought to connect with Li Encheng—father of Li Quantao of the Wei Li branch—using exactly this rare Jiangnan [Blood-Dawn Fruit]!

And that [Blood-Dawn Fruit] was what Li Qinghong had obtained from this very Yan Hu, given to Li Xizhi, and ultimately exchanged for Essence Gathering Pills...

'So this is where that strand of karma began!'

Li Ximing knew this Demon beast was glossing over the details, speaking vaguely, and only trying to latch onto this connection now that he was in the Purple Mansion Realm. Still, his family *had* taken the spirit fruit from this creature back then, which must have felt like a sudden disaster for the demon. Amused, Li Ximing asked, "Do you still regret losing the [Blood-Dawn Fruit]?"

The Demon beast peeked at his expression, then kowtowed rapidly, weeping. "If not for offering that fruit and gaining a sliver of immortal protection, this lowly demon would have been captured and refined into a pill ten years ago! How could I have survived to this day..."

Li Ximing rarely encountered such a smooth-talking Demon beast. He sat upon the throne and appraised him. "What offense did you commit that made you flee to this Mountain of Exiles?"

The tiger demon hurried to explain. "This lowly one was a patrolman in a region of the Southern Borderlands. One time, I mistakenly delivered the wrong ingredients, displeasing General White Macaque... I knew I had messed up. It just so happened my own King was fighting a great war and killed the White Macaque, so I escaped calamity and gained my freedom. But who knew his younger brother, Black Macaque, would take his place! In desperation, this lowly demon gathered the spirit items he was transporting and fled overnight to the Mountain of Exiles..."

"Now... seventy years have passed." He lowered his head. "The matter is in the past, but I can never dare return... Those spirit items I seized the chance to steal were either used to aid my cultivation or were extorted by passing human cultivators... They were used up many years ago..."

Li Ximing listened to this trivial history and asked casually, "It has been seventy years. Are you still familiar with the Southern Borderlands?"

Yan Hu's eyes lit up when he heard this, sensing an opportunity. He nodded frantically. "Though this lowly one left, I am still familiar with the Five Ranges north of Shahuan! If I just have some spirit items... integrating myself back in would be extremely simple..."

"Enough." Li Ximing nodded. "We said back then we would give you an opportunity, and my family does not go back on its word. I need a Demon beast to carry messages to the Southern Borderlands. You will follow me."

Yan Hu was instantly overcome with ecstasy. He scrambled forward from the floor and kowtowed respectfully, crying out, "This one is willing to die for the Daoist Master!"

Yan Hu knew his life here was precarious, surviving day to day. He had survived this long only by being strong, groveling, spending his wealth, and borrowing the reputation of others. How much longer could he last? But if he submitted to a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, even a peak Foundation Establishment demon general would have to respectfully call him 'Sir.' He could walk with his head held high in the Southern Borderlands while on orders... He had definitely seen what those demons who served as dogs for Purple Mansion cultivators looked like when they came to the Southern Borderlands!

He practically wept with joy. Li Ximing lifted him up with a beam of light. The dog demon nearby watched, stunned. 'Th-th-this... He really *did* have a connection! Then why was he squatting here suffering all this time?'

Yan Hu, trembling with delight behind them, couldn't be bothered with the dog demon, hoping only that it wouldn't try to tag along. Li Ximing, meanwhile, had his own considerations.

It was true that he and Yan Hu shared a strand of karma, but karma alone wasn't enough to warrant taking this demon in. First, the Demon beast's turbid aura was weak; clearly, he had not dared to eat humans all these years. Second, this Demon beast was quick-witted and experienced, which would make handling matters more convenient.

There was one other key point. This Demon beast possessed the [Hurricane Ghost Yin] foundation.

'I have obtained several Myriad Secrets Daoist traditions—be they spell arts or escape techniques—but I currently have no cultivator aligned with the [Hurricane Ghost Yin]. Although Demon beasts of these common bloodlines are generally considered inferior, this demon cultivator's cultivation isn't bad. He is already in the late Foundation Establishment Realm. If he trains in these techniques, he can still be put to good use.'

Flying into the Great Void, Li Ximing raised an eyebrow and said quietly, "When the time comes, I will send you to the Southern Borderlands. You will bear the imprint of my divine ability and visit the various demon clans. You are to inquire about spirit items and spiritual flames on my behalf. Do you understand?"

Yan Hu nodded quickly and said respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master! This servant witnessed such things back in the day... I have some understanding. I will absolutely not disappoint the Daoist Master!"

"Mm." Li Ximing glanced at him. "You will be representing my family, after all. When we return to the lake, you will receive my Island's Six Dams Secret Technique. You will also learn one or two escape techniques and movement skills. I will find someone to outfit you with armor, and *then* I will send you to the Southern Borderlands."
