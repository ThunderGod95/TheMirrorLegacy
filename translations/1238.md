# Chapter 1238: Awaiting the Divine

Windswept clouds roiled through the mountain forest where an azure cauldron stood upon a high place. Within it, mists of silver and red swirled and intertwined as if an elixir was condensing inside, faintly illuminating the surroundings with patches of multicolored light.

A modest stone platform sat beside the azure cauldron, and upon it, a woman sat cross-legged with one hand resting on her knee, forming a hand seal that shimmered with silver light. Its halo faintly intertwined with the azure cauldron, releasing ripples of color, while her other hand held a jade slip which she read intently; after an unknown amount of time had passed, she opened her eyes as a silver light flashed in her palm.

'The aura has reached perfection.'

She waited for the opportune moment, performed a quick divination, and received an auspicious sign, only then did she stand and lightly tap the azure cauldron three times.

The intertwined red and silver mist within the cauldron seethed for an instant but gave no further reaction; she had no choice but to raise her hand again, strike the cauldron's rim, and recite with a laugh:

"For three thousand days, sand has mixed with mercury; Mansion Water refined into the cavern's void essence. Heaven and Earth await beyond this azure furnace; how can you still hide yourself in slumber? —Li Wushao! The marvel is complete!"

Though her words were gentle, they descended into the cotton-soft mist within the cauldron and ignited flashes of violet lightning. The Mystic Pill below shot upward, transforming in midair into a flowing, inky darkness before landing in front of the azure cauldron to reveal the form of a man.

The man was not tall, and his eyes were sinister and fierce; even with a hint of joy, his demeanor remained intimidating. He wore robes like overlapping scales, and the shadow at his feet writhed restlessly as if a Flood Dragon slithered within. Most importantly, the multicolored light that coiled around him seemed faintly connected to the Great Void, possessing an extraordinary and profound quality!

He was no longer of the mortal coil!

This demon beast had been refined like a pill in the cauldron for many years, yet he was not entirely cut off from the outside world; he had sensed it all—the many upheavals, Li Que'wan's injury, and even her rushed return to the lake to provide aid. Now, standing among the mountains, he felt as if he had been reborn!

Li Wushao prostrated himself in a deep bow, his voice reverent.

"Wushao thanks you, Daoist Master!"

Her face lit up with joy as she quickly helped him up, saying after a brief inspection,

"We ran into some trouble along the way; Western Shu attacked, and it nearly ruined everything. Seeing you safe and sound with your aura intact, I can finally be at ease!"

The old demon's eyes shone with genuine excitement, filled with irrepressible joy and a profound disbelief he could not shake, as if he were still in a dream. He simply bowed and said,

"This Wushao was originally but a common creature of the Eastern Sea, eking out a miserable existence in the jaws of a dragon. I drifted from place to place until I ended up at Lake Xian… My old master did not disdain this old demon's humble bloodline or meager strength, but graciously brought me to the lake, bestowing treasures upon me to bolster my fate. The young master then personally led me to Azure Pond, and with the help of all manner of spiritual resources, my humble blood was finally able to shine…"

"And now you have used the Dao of Edict God to elevate me to a divine ability. I shall never forget this grace that has set me upon the Dao!"

In truth, Li Wushao understood his own value as a Hooked Serpent better than anyone… To be blunt, the resources the Li clan had invested in him were no less than what they would spend to cultivate a scion of a noble house, yet the results had always been lackluster…

When the Li siblings had him undertake this path of Edict God, Li Wushao had long been prepared to offer his own body to the Dao. Even when problems arose midway, he never imagined Li Que'wan would expend time and resources to mend his shaken foundation—it would have been far more practical to simply find another demon beast to refine!

'This Edict God seems like a state of servitude, but it actually has profound benefits. There's even some room for my own cultivation, and because my Dharma Body is externally attached, I can leverage the long lifespan of a demon beast and bind myself to this Spiritual Treasure…'

Demon beasts have no access to the secret arts of the Purple Mansion Realm, making the attainment of a divine ability incredibly difficult. If word of this got out, countless demon beasts with bloodlines far nobler than his would fight for the chance to become an Edict God!

He had cultivated in human form for a hundred years, and for the first time, he regretted that his vocabulary consisted mostly of curses and insults; so much so that when he tried to express sincere gratitude, his words came out like clumsy flattery, much to his own chagrin.

'I should have learned a few more phrases from Old Man Qu!'

Li Que'wan only smiled without a word, just as a fiery light flared among the mountains. A man in crimson robes strode down, his eyes alight with joy as he laughed and said,

"You're too kind, Senior!"

Li Jiangqian's golden pupils held a smile as he studied the demon beast closely, sensing that his divine aura was abstruse and indistinct. It truly possessed the aura of Water Virtue, yet it lacked the brilliance of a typical divine ability. He asked,

"What sort of marvel is it?"

Li Que'wan laughed.

"Because it's a marvel borrowed from an unorthodox path, it can't be considered a true divine ability. However, his entire Mansion Water foundation has been combined with various spiritual resources and elevated by a supreme marvel, ascending into the Spiritual Treasure… and the spiritual essence we used to raise his immortal foundation was exceptionally fine…"

She paused for a moment before continuing,

"Using the Edict God method normally yields perhaps fifty or sixty percent of a standard marvel's power, but our spiritual essence was simply too sublime. Even at fifty or sixty percent, the result is astonishing. Right now, apart from lacking a specific divine ability, he is already at ninety percent of the level of a typical Mansion Water cultivator who possesses a single divine ability!"

At these words, Li Jiangqian's expression changed instantly, and Li Wushao himself was utterly stunned. Li Que'wan had made it sound simple, but achieving this was anything but—although the upper limits of the Blessing of Divinity were extremely high, the cost in resources was astronomical. According to the principles of the Blessing of Divinity method, even investing Li Ximing's treasured Profound Lake Primal Essence might not have produced such a fine result!

'As expected of the Supreme Yin Spiritual Essence!'

Li Jiangqian clasped his hands behind his back and paced a few steps, contemplating the implications of this development before nodding.

"This is a fitting outcome!"

Only then did Li Wushao seem to awaken from a dream. He rose, his face wreathed in smiles as he bowed and said,

"The young miss speaks truly, but the Blessing of Divinity has its own benefits… My Shengyang acupoint has already merged with the Spiritual Treasure. Though I cannot stray too far from it, even if my Dharma Body is shattered on the spot, as long as the treasure isn't lost, I can slowly recover afterward by expending resources!"

This much did not surprise Li Jiangqian; methods that involved offering up one's True Spirit and life-mandate often had such benefits. This was also a major reason why Li Wushao had so eagerly entered the Spiritual Treasure to become an Edict God—otherwise, not so many cultivators and demon beasts would be willing to throw in their lot with the Buddhists!

But Li Wushao had not finished, and the smile on his face grew wider.

"And there's a most important benefit: the marvels of this Spiritual Treasure also work on me!"

This made Li Que'wan rise to her feet, her expression rather strange.

"I never read of such a thing in the methods from the Underworld or in the Spiritual Treasure's descriptions!"

Li Wushao's smile still looked sinister as he spoke.

"This subordinate only just sensed it. The more precious the cost of the Edict God, and the higher the Dao-Profundity of the caster, the greater the possibility of sharing with the Spiritual Treasure! For example, this subordinate can enjoy the marvels of both Material Derivation and Hidden Profundity."

The demon beast said,

"Material Derivation aids in the transformation of material properties, which is of little help to this subordinate, but Hidden Profundity is of great use!"

Li Que'wan had already understood in that instant and nodded.

"You can share in Hidden Profundity. With the help of the Profound Coffin Crimson Water, even if your Dharma Body is destroyed and you retreat into the Spiritual Treasure, you can rely on Hidden Profundity to slowly heal even if no one provides resources for your recovery. Even if things aren't so dire and you are merely injured, you can heal yourself while using your divine abilities, just as I did that day… The marvels of this Spiritual Treasure are all interlinked!"

"Precisely."

Li Wushao was clearly extremely satisfied with his current state, his eyes shining.

"In addition, because my Shengyang acupoint and life-mandate are within the Spiritual Treasure, I am essentially just a marvel of this Spiritual Treasure. All manner of intimidating, bewitching, confounding, and even cursing divine abilities and spell arts will have no effect on me."

"The only weakness… is still the Spiritual Treasure itself."

He finally reined in his joy and sighed.

"If this Spiritual Treasure is ever suppressed or captured, I will lose my life as well!"

Li Jiangqian nodded repeatedly, his mind racing with thoughts. He paced quickly for a few steps on the mountain before asking,

"How far can you travel?"

A bitter look finally appeared on Li Wushao's face.

"The distance is the same as before. If the young miss is at the lake, I can at most reach the great desert… and it requires that the Great Void not be sealed. Once the Great Void is blocked, I will dissipate along with it."

Hearing this flaw, Li Jiangqian felt it was more reasonable. He then asked again,

"Can you cultivate on your own?"

Li Que'wan nodded.

"There isn't much room for his cultivation to grow now. At most, he can gain one or two more layers of marvels. If we want him to advance further, I'll have to find another Edict Pill. Of the so-called Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity, if all five are gathered, his cultivation limit… should be comparable to a perfected divine ability."

A trace of helplessness flashed in her eyes.

"Of course, not to mention the difficulty of doing so, an Edict God who has cultivation but no divine ability, even if their cultivation and dharma power are comparable to a perfected divine ability, can at best contend with a cultivator of three divine abilities."

Li Jiangqian said,

"It seems he'll need to work on his spell arts."

He was not wrong. The greatest advantage of an Edict God was their initiative. Li Wushao had his own thoughts and Dao-Profundity; every spell art he mastered was almost equivalent to adding a small new marvel to the Spiritual Treasure.

'In other words… the best candidates for this Edict God are actually demon beasts with low innate talent but high aptitude for the Dao—those whom the great sects and clans would call beings of high Dao-wisdom…'

On this point, Li Wushao could be considered average. After all, he had managed to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm despite his humble bloodline, which showed he had some talent. Thus, he took an item out from his sleeve and placed it in the old demon's hands.

"This art is the Water-Guiding Transformation Scripture. It is an art of Pit Water. The Pit Water Mansion is fraught with complexities, and this item draws upon the transformations of rivers and streams. If you cultivate it, you will surely make progress!"

This item was also a fifth-grade art from the High Firmament Pavilion, impossible to find in the outside world and enough to move the heart of a Purple Mansion cultivator. Li Wushao bowed his thanks, and Li Que'wan remarked with a sigh,

"It's finally done… The family has another confidant. Go and pay your respects to the old master first!"

Li Wushao bowed and retreated, dissolving into a dispersing cloud of water. Only then did the crimson-robed young man turn around.

"I just investigated carefully. He has no trace of the Supreme Yin aura on him; it must have been completely consumed during his elevation. Even if some remained, it would be of no consequence to us now."

Li Que'wan nodded silently.

"Since that taboo can be relaxed a little, there's no need to delay Yehui's matter any longer!"

She then turned her slender hand over, revealing a small, shining cauldron in her palm—Li Wushao's refinement had not required her full attention, so Li Que'wan naturally had not wasted the time. She had long since prepared a portion of Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, concealed it with a Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, and transformed it into the Yin-Leap Qi that Yehui needed!

Now that more than a year had passed, Li Que'wan had naturally completed the task and handed it to her brother. Li Jiangqian accepted it and said seriously,

"Leave this to me. With Li Wushao standing guard, I can be more at ease if you enter seclusion at the lake… It's just that…"

His tone shifted as he voiced his concern.

"We already added two Daoist Masters, and now we have the even closer Li Wushao. They haven't asked yet, but as the number of people increases, a simple comparison with the spiritual qi will reveal that something is wrong. The matter of the mystic realm becomes more urgent by the day. These days, whenever I return to the lake, I stay in the Milin Mountains and only cultivate a little, for fear of draining the spiritual qi of the people below, which would then harm the spiritual meridian."

"However, the formation our family has just established is short on spiritual items, so we can delay a little, but we must slowly start inquiring about the relevant spiritual items."

He reminded his sister, but Li Que'wan was not surprised and nodded in response.

"I have also read that fox-kin's method for constructing a mystic realm in the Great Void. The calculation for the Profound Foundation must be adapted to local conditions, so it's difficult to directly determine the number and type of spiritual items needed. I will need to calm my mind and calculate for three to five years, then begin the refinement. I will also have to constantly calculate according to the changes and slowly add things in; it could easily take ten or twenty years…"

Hesitation appeared in her eyes.

"All told, even if our family gives its all, it will take at least thirty years. Not only will I be tied up for these thirty years, but there can be no accidents. The Profound Foundation is extremely fragile before it's completed; any problem will mean all previous efforts are wasted!"

"Even you will need that long…"

Li Jiangqian was taken aback, a trace of disappointment flashing in his eyes.

"Then it's no wonder. The spiritual atmosphere has been changing for so many years, yet we haven't heard of anyone who has successfully established a mystic realm. Firstly, everyone has the will but not the power, and secondly… it is truly difficult."

His judgment was swift. He said with a heavy heart,

"In that case, let's postpone this matter for now, whether it's by finding another method or seeking help from elsewhere… If only there were a way to seize another family's mystic realm…"

Li Que'wan hadn't considered this point. She watched her brother depart on a plume of fire, made a mental note of the matter, and once again took out the jade slip—it was precisely the Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence.

Refining the treasure in the mountains for the past three hundred days had not consumed much of her mental energy. She had been constantly studying this spell art; after all, she already had a rough outline in her mind. Now, picking up her interrupted train of thought, she had long since begun to nurture the marvel within her sleeve.

In her spiritual sense, she felt a slight weight in her sleeve. Extending a slender hand, she opened her palm towards the gardenias covering the ground and made a grasping motion. The empty sleeve's opening suddenly gaped, and in an instant, a patch of the white blossoms vanished.

Joy appeared in the woman's eyes. She gently clenched her fair fingers, swiftly drew her hand back, and then forcefully flung it forward. A torrent of gardenia blossoms like a white dragon rushed out, tumbling down the stone steps and disappearing into the mountainside.

'Good! The Sleeve Residence was cultivated so quickly!'

The delight in her eyes was obvious—although the current Sleeve Residence was no different from a storage pouch, it at least meant she had passed the threshold of this notoriously difficult spell art.

And what surprised her even more was the time it took to accomplish.

'The book said it would take at least three hundred and sixty-six days, yet I succeeded in only three hundred…'

As a Whole Pill cultivator, her perception was extremely clear. This had stumbled right into the specialty of Awaiting the Supreme Divine. Firstly, the Sleeve Residence resonated with the concept of nurturing. Secondly, the act of gestating the Sleeve Residence itself aligned with the imagery of Awaiting the Supreme Divine. That was why it had been so swift!

This instantly sparked more associations in her mind.

'Awaiting the Supreme Divine prioritizes longevity and the Immortal Dao, and also possesses the virtue of gestation… To think it could even apply here. This means that spell arts requiring the nurturing of some kind of casting medium will all receive an additional boon from my divine ability…'

The Golden Book of Divine Attendance was, after all, a Daoist treatise prepared by that True Monarch for his beloved, containing a vast amount of Daoist Dharma expositions, but the sections describing divine abilities were very few. It was even possible that for those ancient cultivators, explaining a divine ability was less useful than leaving behind a few more transformations. This woman had never thought her divine ability could be directed inward. Now, with her thoughts suddenly cleared, it was like an epiphany, and her expression grew strange.

'In that case… my cultivation of a second immortal foundation and a second divine ability, isn't that also Awaiting the Supreme Divine? Awaiting the Supreme Divine prioritizes longevity and the Immortal Dao; so this is what it means to prioritize the Immortal Dao… Awaiting the Supreme Divine and the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao are inherently and extremely compatible!'

'That's right…'

Her eyes slowly brightened.

'The Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao… wasn't it in the hands of the Prime Virtue True Monarch of the Whole Pill that it was revitalized, leading the great tide of the world?! No wonder… no wonder Golden Oneness had Daoist Master Qiushui cultivate the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao…'

'Those of the so-called Whole Pill should cultivate the Purple Mansion to build the Golden Core!'
