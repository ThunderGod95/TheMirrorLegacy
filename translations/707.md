# Chapter 707: The Dawn of an Immortal Clan

He waved a hand dismissively. "Weizeng, the Daoist Master and I have important matters to discuss. Please wait at the foot of the mountain."

Ding Weizeng naturally complied. As Xiao Ruyu led him away, the burly man, despite his power, felt a wave of apprehension. He was a known figure in Jiangbei, but he had never experienced the grandeur of a true immortal clan. In the presence of the Xiao family, he felt utterly out of his depth.

Li Ximing ascended the main peak of Mount Xianyou alone, his steps measured as he approached the deep pool. This time, no snow fell; the stone path was clear, and the air was filled with a serene, welcoming tranquility. When he reached the water's edge, he found the old man not fishing, but sitting peacefully and sipping tea.

"Zhaojing pays his respects to the Daoist Master," Li Ximing said with a bow before taking a seat at the table.

Xiao Chuting’s demeanor was as unhurried as ever. "There is no need for such formality."

This was an official visit, far different from his previous attempt to foster goodwill. The tea Xiao Chuting served was a pale yellow, shimmering with a potent spiritual energy that marked it as a high-grade brew. Li Ximing took a small sip. While it was of little use to a Purple Mansion cultivator, its fragrance was exquisite.

After a moment's pause, Li Ximing lowered his voice. "Senior... that cultivator from Jiangbei follows the Hengzhu Immortal Dao. Is there any sign of a hidden motive?"

Xiao Chuting had barred Ding Weizeng from the mountain, and Li Ximing’s first instinct was that the man was trouble. But the old man simply shook his head. "Si Boxiu sent him, didn't he?"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing, and he recounted his recent conversation. Xiao Chuting let out a soft laugh. "He suspects the extent of my divine abilities and wanted to test whether I have mastered 'Holding the Ridge.' So first, he mentioned Daoist Xiangchun, knowing you would find it too troublesome. Then he mentioned me, making the suggestion seem casual."

He elaborated, "My path of 'Pit Water' includes the divine ability 'Holding the Ridge.' The water dwells within the mountain, sustained by its source, making it inexhaustible. It has the power to heal and restore life, and it could certainly cure your retainer."

"All he needed to do was watch. If your retainer left Mount Xianyou fully healed, he would know with near certainty that I, Xiao Chuting, have mastered the ability."

"This junior was ignorant of such subtleties and nearly caused a problem," Li Ximing said apologetically, thanking him for the guidance. Xiao Chuting could have easily dismissed the matter with a simple excuse; his detailed explanation was a clear gesture of instruction.

A more serious thought struck Li Ximing, and he frowned. "I wonder, was Daoist Master Yuanxiu merely seizing an opportunity, or did he use his life divine ability to orchestrate this? Would he truly concern himself with such a minor affair?"

"He was merely seizing an opportunity," Xiao Chuting replied casually. "A passing test. Though his 'Carpenter's Measure' is a life divine ability, it doesn't focus on manipulating events. Besides, he is far too proud to bother with such schemes."

It was clear from his tone that he had dealt with countless such ploys over the years; this was nothing more than a trivial distraction. He changed the subject. "Regarding Changxi, it seems you have agreed to his request. Do you know the full story behind the Radiant Sky Stone?"

Seeing the conversation turn to the Kong family, Li Ximing replied, "I know the basics, but I would be grateful for your instruction, Senior."

He knew that the Kong family had only provided information without getting directly involved, but he listened as Xiao Chuting began to explain.

"Years ago, Tu Longjian remained unaligned for a long time. After his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, he entered a long seclusion, seeing no one. It was a clear statement that he wished to remain neutral. Since he had made his name in the Yue State, such an attitude earned him more than a few cold shoulders."

"The incident with the Radiant Sky Stone was engineered to force his hand. When Li Xijun was led to the cultivators from the Crimson Reef Island, it was to compel Tu Longjian to choose between returning the spirit item and siding with the Hengzhu Immortal Dao. He staunchly refused to choose, and so, Li Xijun died."

As Li Ximing remained silent, Xiao Chuting continued, "The role the Kong family played in all this is... difficult to say for certain. Changxi was an outcast in Jiangnan. If an opportunity arose to curry favor with the major powers by fanning the flames, he would not have passed it up. Furthermore, knowing Tu Longjian's character, he likely calculated that even if he couldn't save Li Xijun, the Radiant Sky Stone would still end up in your family's hands."

"He had some ties to the Crimson Reef Island. A solution that pleased both sides was not beyond his means."

Though Xiao Chuting claimed it was "difficult to say," his meaning was clear: Changxi had been a key instigator. He had helped the Crimson Reef Island lure Tu Longjian while ensuring the Li family obtained the Radiant Sky Stone.

'It's even possible,' Li Ximing thought, 'that the Radiant Sky Stone was the payment the Crimson Reef Island promised the Profound Peak Gate for luring Tu Longjian. Changxi simply passed it along to my family as our 'reward.''

He understood now. Without the information from the Profound Peak Gate, the Li family might never have pursued the stone. It was precisely because they valued their relationship with the Kong clan, and because they had followed Changxi's wishes by pressuring Si Yuanli, that they saw the stone as due compensation and decided to act.

Looking back, the entire affair was a web of complexity. His family had merely been the killers; behind the scenes, several Purple Mansion cultivators had been pulling the strings.

'And the Changxiao Gate, who seemed to gain nothing... what was their role in all this?'

As his mind churned, Xiao Chuting took another sip of tea. "Did you accept Changxi's gift, Zhaojing? Knowing this now, how will you proceed?"

Li Ximing fell silent for a moment. Changxi's actions hadn't been intended to harm his family, merely to make their decisions for them. From any objective standpoint, trading a Foundation Establishment cultivator with no hope of reaching the Purple Mansion for a Radiant Sky Stone was a monumental gain.

'But back then, my family was just a noble house. Did we ever truly have the power to make our own decisions?'

He could hardly seek justice for Li Xijun's death. At most, he could hate the Crimson Reef Island. He certainly couldn't voice any blame in front of Xiao Chuting. "The Crimson Reef Island wanted to entrap Tu Longjian," he finally answered. "My family would have been caught in the crossfire regardless. Without the Profound Peak Gate, they would have used even crueler methods. Given their animosity toward us, it might not have been just my cousin who perished."

"This was like someone holding a knife to my throat to force my elders to act. Daoist Master Changxi merely tugged on his sleeve and secured some compensation for us. What he gained is another matter. My family was a minor house then. When a Purple Mansion cultivator offers aid, one does not have the luxury of being picky."

Whatever his true feelings were about Changxi, his words were exceedingly diplomatic, and not just for his sake.

The Profound Peak Gate had fanned the flames, but the Xiao family had remained completely aloof. They had controlled the eastern shore, denying the Li family the right to build a market, and had stood by during numerous conflicts. If Li Ximing spoke ill of Changxi, what would that make Xiao Chuting?

Li Ximing remembered one crucial fact: Mount Xianyou was not the Li family. Though the memory of Li Xijun's death was a knot in his heart, who truly cared? All anyone wanted was a gesture.

His reply elicited no significant change in Xiao Chuting's expression. The old man simply nodded. "You see things clearly, Zhaojing. That is no small feat."

His voice carried a hint of lament. Reaching the Purple Mansion Realm was a glorious achievement, enough to make even the most resolute cultivator swell with pride. And now, it was Changxi who was old and frail, begging for help.

After a moment, Xiao Chuting smiled. "As for your retainer, you can ask Changxi. He will have a way."

Li Ximing offered his thanks. As their conversation wound down, and it seemed his visit was nearing its end, he recalled Si Boxiu's parting words. "Senior, you have supported the Xiao family alone in Jiangnan for so long. You must have infringed upon the interests of many Purple Mansion cultivators. Are there any misunderstandings with other Daoist Masters that I should be aware of?"

He was asking about Xiao Chuting's enemies. The old man understood at once, but his reply was nonchalant. "I keep to myself in Jiangnan. No one would believe you and I have formed an alliance. You need not worry. Go on now."

***

**Moongaze Lake, Vermillion Bud Pavilion.**

The bluestone lantern stands cast a hazy glow, their light reflecting on the ink-black surface of the lake. The night was deep.

Li Quewan concluded her cultivation and stood for a moment in the pavilion. Since her Daoist Master's breakthrough, the Bright Yang in the sky above the lake had become too potent and unstable. It was better to cultivate her Whole Pill in the dead of night. She had thus shifted her schedule, and now, as she finished, the world was shrouded in darkness.

"Sister Quewan!"

She had barely begun to rest when a figure on a flying shuttle zipped across the lake and landed beside her. It was a distant cousin from her own branch of the family who usually cultivated on the main island. Li Queyi was younger than her, dressed in a pink skirt, with a round face and delicate ears that gave her a refined, lovely appearance. She smiled brightly. "Congratulations, sister! Your brothers have all been released!"

"What?!"

Li Quewan's heart had been heavy with worry, expecting a summons to Mount Qingdu. The news was so unexpectedly good that a fleeting look of joy crossed her face, quickly replaced by a flicker of unease. "How was the interrogation handled?"

She understood why Li Zhouwei had delayed, and she feared he might simply quash the matter without a proper investigation, which would only harm her in the long run.

But Li Queyi just smiled. "Don't worry, sister! Grand-uncle Chenghuai successfully broke through and has taken charge of Mount Qingdu. He used a truth-discerning talisman from his 'Untraceable Presence' lineage to expose all of Li Dongdi's lies! The rumors have collapsed on their own!"

A slow, genuine smile spread across Li Quewan's face. "Grand-uncle succeeded in his breakthrough? That's wonderful news!"

Li Queyi paused for a moment before adding, "Dozens of people involved have been captured, from outside families and branch lineages, even some from the main line. They've all been taken to the Water Cave on Mount Qingdu."

Li Quewan's joy quickly faded. She spoke softly, "I entered the main island and rose to stand with the Young Lord, despite coming from a branch family. It's only natural that there would be gossip and jealousy. We shouldn't be too harsh. If it causes chaos within the clan, the fault will ultimately be mine."

Li Queyi, who was also from the main line of the First Branch and was very close to Li Quewan, stared. A sense of injustice had long simmered within her, and her delicate eyebrows furrowed. "Sister, you think too highly of them. They're just insignificant nobodies."

Li Quewan simply shook her head. She rose from her seat in the pavilion, intending to go to Mount Qingdu to pay her respects to Li Chenghuai. But before she could leave, a man in black robes descended on the wind, landing before her. It was Chen Yang.

"Greetings, my lady," Chen Yang said with a cupped-fist salute. Without waiting for a reply, he stated gravely, "The Clan Head summons you. Please follow me to the island at once."

Not daring to delay, Li Quewan flew with him. As she arrived at the main hall on the island, she saw two youths waiting outside. One was dressed practically, with an ordinary face. The one beside him, however, was built for battle, with a bold and resolute air, thick eyebrows, and a suit of armor. Both had golden eyes.

"Greetings, Clan Sister," they both said.

Li Quewan quickly nodded in return. They were the Second Young Lord, Li Jianglong, and the Third Young Lord, Li Jiangxia. Both were younger than her, only eighteen or nineteen, and both cultivated the Bright Yang arts.

The Fourth Young Lord, Li Jiangliang, was still a child, but these two were formidable figures. Li Jianglong was known in the clan for his magnanimity and foresight, while Li Jiangxia had held a position of authority for some time, having recently returned from managing affairs on the eastern shore for the Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly.

Upon seeing Li Quewan, Li Jiangxia laughed heartily. "It's been many years, Clan Sister! A pity the Xiao family has returned the lands east of the shore. I will likely have to bid Father farewell and go back to take charge. There won't be much time to chat!"

Li Jiangxia was noticeably more outgoing than his brother, with a more striking presence and a more ruthless approach to his duties. He had distinguished himself early on and was favored by Li Zhouwei, who entrusted him with great responsibilities.

Li Jianglong was more reserved. He inquired after Li Quewan's brothers, and she answered his questions. Soon, they were summoned, and the three of them entered the hall together.

The hall was brightly lit. Li Zhouwei was still at his desk, marking documents with a vermillion brush. The end of the Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly had left a mountain of loose ends to tie up—which families had sent gifts, whose were more generous, who hadn't come, who had left halfway through. It was not a task that could be finished quickly.

He only set down his brush when the three of them approached. His eyes fell first on Li Quewan, his voice low and deep. "Wan'er, the matter within the clan has been settled. I've spoken with Uncle Chenghuai. For the time being, send your brothers to Mount Qingdu. They can work on the old master's talisman peak to keep him company."

The "old master" was, of course, Li Xuanxuan. After this ordeal, even if her brothers were released, their businesses were ruined. This arrangement was more than suitable. Li Quewan bowed respectfully. "Thank you, Clan Head."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "There has always been gossip in the clan—just power struggles between the sixteen prefectures. If it wasn't this rumor, it would have been another. Stay in the Vermillion Bud Pavilion and focus on your cultivation."

Li Quewan quickly agreed. Li Zhouwei then turned his gaze to his two sons, sliding a jade tablet across the desk. "Jiangxia, the Xiao family has ceded seventy-nine families on the eastern shore. Take this token, go to Mount Qingdu to get the immortal registers, and select a few Peak Attendants, Prefecture Stewards, and Guest Elders. Make a trip there and clean things up."

"Yes, sir!" Li Jiangxia's eyes lit up, his eagerness palpable. His brother, Li Jianglong, simply lowered his head, his expression unreadable.

Li Zhouwei picked up his brush again, not looking up as he asked, "Do you have a plan?"

Li Jiangxia answered without hesitation. "I've already thought it through, Father. Besides the tributes, first, we will station garrisons along the eastern shore to prohibit blood-qi consumption, hoarding of rice and meat, and forced mergers. Then, we will establish a market to facilitate trade. Finally, we'll establish a palace in the dense forest to govern the one hundred and eighteen families of the eastern shore."

"Every five years, twenty-four youths will be selected from those families to train at the mountain palace. Their treatment will be linked to their clan's status. Those who succeed in their cultivation can become stewards or Guest Elders in our service. Those who fail will return to their own families to manage their affairs."

Li Zhouwei's brush paused. "And if they don't wish to stay?"

Li Jiangxia frowned. "Then they can return to govern their own families."

Li Zhouwei glanced at Li Jianglong, who had been standing silently. "Jianglong, your thoughts."

Li Jianglong stepped forward and bowed. "Reporting to the Clan Head, my third brother's plan is excellent. The palace in the forest is currently empty and would be perfect for housing the geniuses from these families. However, we should frame it more favorably. Announce that once they complete their training and reach Qi Refinement, they are free. They can request to stay with our clan or on the mountain, return to their own families, or even travel the world as they please."

Li Jiangxia understood immediately. The youth grinned. "I was short-sighted. My brother's way certainly sounds better."

In the impoverished and narrow lands of the eastern shore, how could any of the one hundred and eighteen families support even a single Qi Refinement cultivator? A clan head was the absolute peak. Even if they wanted to return home, they lacked the resources. To protect their families, their only real choice was to remain at the lake.

Besides, the Li family never restricted their cultivators from venturing out into the world. But most would return within a year or two, having learned the harsh realities of life as a rogue cultivator—constantly scrambling for spiritual energy, lacking spirit rice for sustenance, always hiding, always wandering. When compared to the techniques and resources the Li family provided, the choice was obvious. They would come back on their own.
