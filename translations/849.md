# Chapter 849: Immortal Dao Wall

The Eastern Sea.

The water was a profound, abyssal dark. A long canyon, its bottom lost to sight, was shrouded in gloom. A streak of azure light shot through the depths, weaving through the water like a fish. Yet, there wasn't a single living creature to be seen—only the oppressive, dark sea.

After an unknowable amount of time, the pale gray canyon floor came into view. Layers of fine, light gray debris drifted in the currents, revealing the stark white reef below. The azure light shifted, transforming on the seabed into a man in azure robes.

The man wore fine azure clothing, a golden tassel hanging from his belt. With his handsome face, azure eyes, and long, unbound hair, he stood firm on the seafloor and surveyed his surroundings.

It was Chi Buzi.

***

The seabed near the coast was shallow and rich with spiritual energy; it had all once been land, much like the six great prefectures to the south. But past Green Pine Island and Splitreed Island, the seafloor plunged dramatically, marking the ancient coastline.

This place was not far from Splitreed Island. To reach it, one had to traverse the densest region of spiritual energy, travel near Bamboo Creek Island, and then descend between the earth veins to find this deep canyon and follow it to the bottom.

The inner records of the Azure Pond Sect mentioned that Daoist Master Yuansu had cultivated at the bottom of this canyon for a very long time. The deepest parts here plunged far below the floor of the Vermillion Sea, likely even deeper than the great chasm on Splitreed Island itself.

What made it truly exceptional was the complete absence of spiritual energy within the canyon. It was like traveling through the Great Void. No Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, even if they searched for a hundred or a thousand years, could ever hope to discover this place.

This lack of spiritual energy also made travel treacherous. Even a mighty Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had to rely on their own dharma power to descend, a journey that would take no less than four or five days at their speed. As for a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, they might possess the ability to get down, but they would most certainly lack the power to fly back up in such a null environment.

Chi Buzi stood on the pitch-black canyon floor. He crouched down and, with a push of his dharma power, swept aside the rolling white sand. The movement revealed a flat stone platform, upon which was inscribed a single, simple golden circle.

He formed a hand seal, recited an incantation in his mind, and pressed his palm onto the platform. As he poured his power into it, layers of profound light began to glow. The dark, lightless canyon floor was finally illuminated by faint golden specks.

But Chi Buzi’s expression was grave. He remained perfectly still, not daring to move.

He knew this place was protected by countless layers of restrictive formations. The slightest ripple of power could unleash more trouble than he could handle. The very bottom layer was an immortal formation; if he triggered its defenses, annihilation would be certain.

He waited for a long while before the golden light on the platform finally shifted to white. The circle flared brightly for a moment before dimming, leaving a single, sparkling point of light at its center.

*Shing!*

With great caution, Chi Buzi drew the Dharma sword from his waist. He flicked a mote of azure light from its tip into the glowing point. After waiting a moment, he reached out and drew the light back, confirming there was no ambush waiting for him. Only then did his form blur, transforming into a streak of azure light that shot into the portal.

***

An unknown time later, a dim light appeared before him. He found himself on another seabed entirely.

The first thing he saw was a towering undersea cliff adorned with fields of coral. The area was littered with ruins and rubble. The remains of collapsed, grayish-white stone walls lay at the cliff's base, and the ground was scattered with broken tiles of all sizes that shimmered with faint, colorful light. Sunlight, filtering down from above, dappled the ground like shimmering scales.

Looking up, he could see the glittering surface of the sea, a sheet of brilliant white from his vantage point. The sun was blazing in the sky. He estimated the cliff was thousands of feet high, its peak nearly breaking the surface.

Chi Buzi paused, a little lost in thought. He took a few steps forward. When nothing happened, he retrieved the tripod-shaped spiritual artifact from his robes and began to scan the entire area.

He moved east until he reached the edge of this pocket sea. Though he could still see endless coral reefs stretching into the distance, his hands met an invisible barrier. He followed the boundary, circling the entire area to ensure he was alone before he began his ascent up the cliff.

The higher he climbed, the brighter the sunlight became. Halfway up the cliffside, Chi Buzi discovered a large stone table surrounded by more than a dozen high-backed stone chairs, most of them overturned and scattered. The scene was one of ruin and desolation. On the single intact chair, a white Daoist robe was draped, swaying gently in the unseen currents.

The tabletop was a mess of bronze wine goblets, some standing, some toppled over. A single jade flask sat silently amidst the clutter. There was nothing else.

Chi Buzi had been here many times. The first time was with Chi Wei, and it was here that the first seeds of defiance against Pristine Water had been planted in his heart. The stone table had been here even then, and a suffocating sense of danger arose whenever he drew near.

As before, Chi Buzi carefully skirted the area and continued his climb. At the very peak of the cliff, he finally saw it: a shimmering stone wall. It was about the height of a man and as thick as two palms pressed together. Countless tiny, ant-sized golden characters floated across its surface. Here, he was only a few yards from the surface; it felt as if a single leap would allow him to break through into the open air.

Chi Buzi paid it no mind and slowly sat down.

According to Chi Wei, the space beyond the water's surface was filled with the ancient Golden Crow's Transmuting Radiance. Anyone who dared to stick their head out would be instantly incinerated. Even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would face certain death.

As for the Immortal Dao Wall, Chi Wei and Ning Tiaoxiao had been here. Qiushui and Daoist Master Tianyuan had been here. Even Zimu, who was once hailed as the cultivator with the highest Dao attainment of his generation, had come. Every Daoist Master who had visited this place was a prodigy of their era, yet not a single one could remember a single word written on the wall. The name "Immortal Dao Wall" itself had come from Li Jiangqun.

Whether Li Jiangqun himself could remember its contents, only he knew.

Chi Buzi bowed slowly. With his dharma power, he traced a series of arcane patterns on the ground. His voice was low and resonant as he began to chant.

"I, the humble cultivator Chi Buzi… pray to the Heavenly Officials to ward off disaster and exorcise evil…"

***

In the world within the Immortal Mirror.

Wind and clouds surged across the land. Lu Jiangxian stood quietly inside his snow-swept cave dwelling, the image of the undersea stone wall swiftly reflected in his pupils.

His gaze lifted slightly, sweeping over the reflection of the Golden Crow's Transmuting Radiance. Golden runes streamed from his eyes, spiraling around his body, growing ever brighter until they coalesced before him into lines of elegant small seal script.

*The Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core*!

As the techniques from his memory surfaced one by one, Lu Jiangxian looked up. Sheets of profound light rained down around him.

The full name of the technique was the *Supreme Technique of the Immortal Dao for Seeking Transformation through the Unified Golden Core*. It shared the same origin as the *Wondrous Technique of True Attainment* he had obtained from the Three-Drum Wall; both were recorded in small seal script.

The difference was that the *Wondrous Technique of True Attainment*, contained within the Dharma Treasure known as the Three-Drum Wall, was an immortal art for cultivating a Golden Core. The *Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core*, however, was a supreme method used by ancient immortals to evade calamities and establish a domain in the azure heavens. It taught one how to hold a Fruition Attainment while simultaneously achieving an Auxiliary Position, or how to gain an Intercalary Position without ever abandoning the first.

The text of this art was concise, yet its variations were infinite, spanning nearly ten million words of detailed explanations for its different permutations. Its primary purpose was to guide a cultivator on how to hold a Fruition Attainment while seeking one of several Auxiliary Positions, and how to achieve an Intercalary Position without relinquishing their Fruition Attainment. The "cultivators" it spoke of were what modern practitioners would call Dao Embryo immortals—beings of whom only a handful existed in the current era.

For now, the art’s primary function was beyond Lu Jiangxian’s reach. At most, it offered some minor convenience in helping him write a Golden Core attainment method for Chi Buzi, but the principles of dual cultivation and achieving an Intercalary Position were not very similar. The art was only helpful due to its incredibly high-level perspective.

But its second function was not to be underestimated: *evading calamities and establishing a domain in the azure heavens.*

This art could erase one's traces from the mortal world, preventing detection by others. It could also use one's personal status to conceal a grotto-heaven and construct an immortal realm.

‘The Immortal Mirror’s status is already incredibly high, so it can erase my tracks by default,’ Lu Jiangxian thought. ‘But the second ability… this is a genuine ancient method for constructing an immortal realm!’

This was no simple matter of hanging a grotto-heaven in the Great Void. In ancient times, when Auxiliary and Intercalary Positions were common, opening a grotto-heaven was simple. Even a spiritual artifact could contain a cave dwelling. The lowest tier of these were the secret realms opened by ordinary cultivators inside spiritual artifacts or on auspicious lands, known as halls or caves. With the changes in the world, these have all long since collapsed.

Only the secret realms established in the Great Void or anchored to powerful auspicious lands by great sects and factions had a chance of surviving to this day. The imperial clans typically created "palaces," while immortal cultivators favored "halls." If properly sealed, these could still exist. The Great Ning Palace was such a place. However, even these realms could be affected by shifts in the mortal world's spiritual atmosphere, causing them to suddenly manifest or for an entrance to appear.

Among these was a special category: the blessed lands of the Purple Smoke and Hengzhu families. Only after obtaining the *Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core* did Lu Jiangxian truly understand them. Blessed lands were typically the work of Golden Core-level experts. By expending their cultivation and divine abilities, they could link a physical location to a Fruition Attainment. This would cause all sorts of phenomena to occur in the area, making it more favorable for certain types of cultivators, even aiding breakthroughs to the Foundation Establishment Realm, the refinement of divine abilities, or the quest for a Fruition Attainment.

The highest tier of all were the grotto-heavens, created by a True Monarch and anchored to their Fruition Attainment. These were known as "heavens." If the True Monarch was exceptionally powerful and their grotto-heaven vast, it might even be called a "dharma-realm," a domain of astonishing size.

The *Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core* provided a method to construct such a grotto-heaven, a way to partition reality itself. This immortal realm would be anchored to one's status, not to the Great Void or a magical artifact. As an immortal-grade art, it relied on only two things: status, and the user's own dharma power and divine abilities.

With this method, the two effects combined meant he could use his status to open a grotto-heaven and silently create a gateway in the mortal world, allowing people to enter with their physical bodies!

And status was the one thing Lu Jiangxian had in abundance. The Immortal Mirror itself already contained a world! He simply hadn't understood the principles before, which was why he could only pull in souls.

He turned his head sharply, his gaze falling upon the world within the Mirror, which loomed, half-hidden, in the clouds behind him. In that instant, his understanding of this realm soared to its absolute peak.

This world was a creation of supreme skill, anchored to the Immortal Mirror and completely isolated from the Great Void. It was half-real, half-illusory, which was why he was nearly invincible within it. To contact the Great Void from here, one had to go through the Immortal Mirror, and since the Mirror itself was beyond perception, the entire realm remained undetectable.

But this came with a drawback. The Immortal Mirror did not simply draw people in. The only way for an outsider to enter was to come into physical contact with the Mirror's body. Only by using methods like scrying or soul-searching to link a person's soul and destiny to the Mirror could they possibly gain entry.

When Lu Jiangxian had first obtained this world, it was nothing more than a single mountain range under a dreary, gray sky. Even then, he was its master, sealed off from the outside world. As his strength grew, the world within the Mirror had gradually transformed.

This realm was a mix of real and illusory. The Immortal Palace above the clouds was a manifestation of his will, but the mountain range below was tangible and real. Now, with the *Wondrous Art*, he could forcibly create an entrance in the mortal world for others to enter.

Take Chi Buzi, for example. He could now enter this place in his physical body. To him, once inside, there would be no difference between the celestial palace in the clouds and the ruined mountains below; both would seem equally real. However, if he tried to take something out, an object from the celestial palace would dissipate into a mere wisp of Supreme Yin moonlight. But the stones and soil from the mountains below? Those could be brought out into the real world.

‘Real or fake, it makes little difference to them,’ Lu Jiangxian mused. ‘And I would never allow them to take anything out. Even a single pebble from this world could become a fatal poison if it reached the outside!’

As his power continued to grow, he found it increasingly difficult to imagine the terrifying power of the enemy who had shattered the Immortal Mirror. It must have been a being on the level of an immortal. What cataclysmic battles had this mountain range witnessed? What traces remained? He could not afford to be careless.

More importantly, it wasn't just a matter of entry and exit. Lu Jiangxian strongly suspected that the Immortal Mirror contained a complete Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment. If he directly linked it to the outside world, the *Wondrous Art* could hide his tracks, but the response of heaven and earth to the appearance of a Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment could not be faked. Auspicious phenomena would erupt everywhere. Mount Luoxia and the Underworld would be thrown into a panic. Even if they couldn't find him, it would alert his enemies.

But this was the world inherent to the Immortal Mirror. It did not mean he couldn't use the *Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core* to create an entirely new one. The immense status granted to him by the Mirror and the high-quality, unending supply of power he now commanded were the perfect fuel for constructing a domain in the azure heavens!

He raised his hand, his robes fluttering around him as boundless light gathered in his palm. Countless brilliant ideas flooded his mind. Specks of white light appeared in his hand, coalescing into a sphere of pure whiteness.

This sphere of pure white expanded rapidly, yet it had no connection to the Great Void. Shielded by the power of the *Wondrous Art*, earth, water, fire, and wind began to surge within it, releasing waves of profound light.

'I will rely on my own status to forge a new realm—a true Immortal Palace domain. I will use it to interact with the mortal world, to allow the Li clan to enter, to influence the great powers of the world, and to collect the fragments!'
