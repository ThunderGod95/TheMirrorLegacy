# Chapter 760: Profound Arts

'Mount Luoxia... He’s even dragging Mount Luoxia into this...'

Dense gray smoke spread across the sea surface, threatening to close in. Before the thunder could fall, Li Ximing had no time to think and plunged directly into the Great Void. But the Great Void itself was already unstable, its spiritual energies roiled by the thunder fluctuations, causing the void to heave like a stormy sea, erupting in chaotic peaks and troughs.

Changxiao’s thunderous voice echoed all around. Li Ximing clearly felt the pulling sensation of the gray smoke. Whether it was a divine ability or a spiritual artifact, the smoke possessed a sealing power, though perhaps not its primary function. The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger struggled, tore free, and fled.

Changxiao’s figure tore through the void moments later. Li Ximing spurred his spiritual artifact onward, simultaneously retrieving a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill and consuming it. As his Dharma Body began to circulate the medicine, the debilitating effects of the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* finally lessened. But Changxiao merely raised the silver disk in his hand, shining it directly at him.

'Another spiritual artifact, without a doubt!'

Changxiao had inherited the Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage and was a Purple Mansion cultivator of immense experience. The lantern, the silver disk, and the gray smoke outside—these powerful spiritual artifacts were overwhelming. Li Ximing’s heart went cold.

'Do I flee the Great Void, or do I resist this head-on? Fleeing means facing that thunder array. It’s just a choice between the Supreme Yin and the Profound Thunder!'

'But the Great Void offers a huge advantage right now! We're at the edge of the Hetian Sea. Further east, the spiritual qi of the world thins out, unlike the abundant qi of the coastal waters. Flying in the Great Void becomes far more efficient out there—perhaps five or even ten times faster!'

Li Ximing wavered. Ultimately, he raised *Audience with the Celestial Gate*. This time, it wasn't a feint or an attack; he used it to reinforce his own position. An ornate, bright-white celestial gate materialized above him, bathing him in Profound Light.

The clear, bright radiance from the silver disk shone down, but before it struck the gate, a thick, brownish-yellow light screen erupted first. It was the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen.

The Supreme Yin light poured down but was temporarily held back by the screen. Li Ximing felt a moment of relief. 'Thank goodness it works!'

But his realization struck a second later. 'Changxiao isn't Yehui. I absolutely cannot keep jumping between the Great Void and the physical world. Instead of delaying him, I'll just be falling right into his traps!'

What was Changxiao famous for? Manipulating the strings of fate and mastering divination! Li Ximing knew his own combat experience was lacking. His previous tactic of weaving between the two realms had been read perfectly. A master of calculations like Changxiao could easily predict his emergence points and simply wait on the other side with attacks prepared.

He had already fallen for it twice—the blinding white light and the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* had both struck him head-on the instant he transitioned, leaving no time to defend. If any ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator had taken those two hits directly, they would be utterly incapacitated by now.

'If I'm going to transition, it has to be sudden and unexpected, not just a reaction when his arts are already descending. Otherwise, he'll predict it every time—especially someone who excels at calculation like him.'

For now, he was holding back the silver disk, but the Supreme Yin light was intensifying. Li Ximing had learned his lesson. Even if the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen started to fail, he absolutely would not jump back to the physical world just to interrupt the spell.

'I don't even need to think about it. That Profound Thunder array is definitely tracking me out there. The instant I emerge, it will blast me in the chest! There’s no room for error!'

His mind raced. He unleashed rays of Supreme Yang light and Bright Yang purple flame, sending them surging into the Great Void to intercept the small, exquisite jade vase flying toward him.

*Boom!*

Although the two lights were brilliant, they visibly faltered, pressed down by the vase and sliding backward. Still, it was far better than having the attack appear suddenly in his face.

But Changxiao’s next divine ability was already manifesting. Layers of white qi surged up, turning the surrounding void into a viscous swamp. The qi crawled up the structure of *Audience with the Celestial Gate*, attempting to lock the divine ability in place.

Li Ximing's only goal was to delay; he couldn't afford to be pinned down. He immediately sent *Audience with the Celestial Gate* flying upward to block the descending Supreme Yin light, while the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen plunged down to counter the encroaching white qi.

*Audience with the Celestial Gate* held steady against the silver disk, but the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen was clearly no match for the swamp-like divine ability. After a brief stalemate, Li Ximing knew he couldn't afford to be trapped. Forced to choose between the incoming *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* and the oppressive Supreme Yin light, he unhesitatingly prioritized the latter. *Audience with the Celestial Gate* suddenly flared with intense brilliance.

The Supreme Yang light and purple flames blocking the vase detonated, momentarily blasting the artifact back. Li Ximing then sent *Audience with the Celestial Gate* soaring, smashing it directly toward Changxiao’s face as a diversion. Ignoring the vase, Li Ximing spurred the tiger onward, bracing himself against the raw Supreme Yin light as he resumed his desperate flight east.

With *Audience with the Celestial Gate* occupied, the Supreme Yin light streaked toward him like a silver fish. Li Ximing pushed the tiger to its limits. His spiritual sense flared, and a dim yellow halo erupted from his body.

*Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption!*

This was another innate wonder of the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. Li Ximing hadn't used it until now for one simple reason: the ability reduced damage from attacks outside the Twelve Qi and the Fire Virtues. Since he had previously faced only True Fire or been caught off guard by surprise attacks, it had been useless.

Now, the dim yellow halo wrapped his Dharma Body in silken threads. When the Supreme Yin light struck it, the attack was instantly weakened by several degrees. Though it still detonated against his body and blasted numerous holes through him—an injury roughly comparable to the True Fire burns Yehui had inflicted—Li Ximing seized the opportunity. For the first time, he actually pulled away, opening up a real distance between them.

'He learns fast,' Changxiao thought, frowning slightly as the celestial gate rushed him. His cultivation was profound; he instantly recognized the Geng Earth light protecting Li Ximing. With a simple gesture, he recalled the twelve-cornered lantern from the physical world, tearing it back through the void into his hand. He would simply switch back to True Fire.

The sight sent a profound shock through Li Ximing. 'So it wasn't just thunder waiting for me in the physical world! He had this True Fire lantern positioned out there as well! If my realization had come even a moment later, if I had made that mistake one more time, it would have been fatal!'

But Changxiao’s expression turned solemn. He raised his hand, and white flames began to surge in the Great Void. Before he could even finish casting the spell, Li Ximing vanished, slipping back into the physical world like a nimble fish.

The logic was simple: Changxiao had just recalled his True Fire lantern. All that remained in the physical world was the thunder. Since *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* was highly effective against thunder, if he didn't escape now, when would he?

The moment Li Ximing emerged, countless silver-white thunderbolts materialized and crashed down. The *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* flared brightly, venting the electricity away from him. Although the ability was far more effective against thunder than Supreme Yin, this electrical storm had been accumulating power for a long time. Li Ximing's Dharma Body was blasted until black smoke rolled off him, yet he endured, pushing forward at extreme speed. The damage wasn't even as severe as that single hit from the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art*!

He waited for Changxiao to follow him back to the physical world, planning to dive back into the Great Void at the opportune moment, but Changxiao never appeared. As Li Ximing sped through the torrential downpour, his heart began to pound with dread.

Li Ximing had learned from his two painful lessons and adapted, but Changxiao was a man of deep calculations. He was a cultivator who, much like Tu Longjian, had clawed his way to the top against numerous Purple Mansion experts. How could such a man willingly serve as a whetstone for his opponent to sharpen his skills?

He felt a sudden chill crawl up his spine as a voice exploded in his ears, vaguely articulating a chant:

"*The Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art.*"

A stream of deep black light tore out of the Great Void, moving with incredible speed. Li Ximing refused to stop, pushing his own escape light forward. He knew he couldn't dive back into the Great Void to dodge this; gritting his teeth, he flew onward, but the black light drew closer and closer.

'If I hadn't taken those debilitating hits earlier, I wouldn't be in such a wretched state now!'

After a long chase through the relentless storm, the air ahead of him warped. Three silver vases tore through the rain—the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* again. Having already suffered from it, Li Ximing didn't bother looking for Changxiao; he activated his *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* and simultaneously summoned *Audience with the Celestial Gate*, the massive white gate rising from the storm, its power pressing down to suppress the incoming spells.

He used his full strength, barely managing to pin the three vases, only for his pupils to reflect an endless sea of True Fire. The twelve-cornered lantern had just torn through the Great Void to manifest before him.

'*Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption* can't block True Fire!'

Li Ximing had no choice but to divert his power, unleashing Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light and Bright Yang Purple Flame to counter the lantern. In that instant of vulnerability, the jet-black *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* slammed into his body, exploding in a dark flash.

A second later, his body vanished from the physical world, having fled back into the Great Void.

Changxiao, however, smiled.

'The great matter is settled.'

Both the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* and the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* were profound arts from his Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage, but the *Sangyu* art was far older. It wasn't an attack of light or spiritual energy, but something derived from ancient immortal arts. Its effectiveness relied on three conditions: being seen by the target, being heard by the target, and landing on the target.

Just now, Li Ximing had clearly seen the black light, distinctly heard the name of the art, and had finally been struck by it. He had taken the full force of its conditions. This was not something the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* could even compare to.

Chasing him from the coastal waters all the way to the Hetian Sea, Changxiao had never been completely certain he could capture or kill him. Li Ximing, though wretched, had not suffered a fundamental injury, and his reactions were quick, even managing to create opportunities to counter. If the chase dragged on much longer, the Hengzhu lineage would absolutely intervene.

But Changxiao had schemed for this outcome, first testing Mount Luoxia’s attitude, then the attitude of the dragon clans, ensuring no one would interfere. Now that his masterpiece, the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art*, had landed, the matter was finally guaranteed.

'Mount Luoxia has no intention of protecting him, and the dragon clans clearly don't care either. Li Zhouwei may have been invited by a Dragon Prince in the past, but that alliance was clearly only with him as an individual. The Li family is not on the list of those the dragon clans will intervene to save.'

'And even if the dragon clans *did* want to protect him, the only ones in the Eastern Sea who could intercept me are the demon cultivators. Letting him escape would cause me little loss, but Mount Luoxia would no longer just watch from above. That action would be all the proof they needed that the dragon clans are attempting to seize the Bright Yang Dao!'

Changxiao never acted without calculating every angle. He pushed the gray smoke forward, letting the thunder roll, intentionally shaking the surroundings. He sensed several other cultivators—Demon clan experts and masters of the Eastern Sea—stepping through the Great Void to observe from a distance. This set his mind further at ease.

'Even in the one-in-ten-thousand chance that Li Zhouwei was secretly a pawn left by the Bright Splendor Imperial Monarch, that entity wouldn't dare save him now. With so many Purple Mansion experts watching, wouldn't that just expose to the world that the ancestor Li Qianyuan still retains his private consciousness?'

'I've made a huge commotion, and Purple Smoke Gate and the Hengzhu clan will certainly rush here immediately. But it is already far too late!'

The Daoist Master listened intently. He tossed the lantern back into the Great Void, letting the spiritual artifact continue the pursuit on its own, while he himself crossed into the physical world. He flew through the rain for a moment, then stopped and began pinching his fingers, calculating.

Li Zhouwei's connection to Mount Luoxia, and perhaps even Li Qianyuan, was a strong possibility. And Li Ximing himself, though seemingly ordinary, had shown abnormalities—that treasure protecting his spiritual sense, perhaps even some hidden link to the Wei Emperor. Changxiao would not give his quarry any chance whatsoever to turn the tables.

Bypassing calculations aimed directly at Li Ximing's fate—which might be shielded—he focused only on the fluctuations in the Great Void. Sure enough, he pinpointed where Li Ximing, clad in his white-gold robes, would emerge nearby. Changxiao formed a hand seal. The silver disk behind him leaped into the air, and the gray smoke rolled with thunder. He raised an eyebrow.

*Boom!*

The rain poured as thunder shook heaven and earth. Far away, the Great Void rippled, and Li Ximing burst forth. His Dharma Body was now wreathed in the black qi of the curse, and the Geng Tiger beneath him had slowed considerably.

Li Ximing was suffering under the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art*. The black qi wrapping his Dharma Body had erupted into dark flames, burning him with an audible crackle. A sharp pain radiated from his Juque Palace, as if the black fire was erupting from within it. Fortunately, his *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was nurtured within that very palace, and his own Bright Yang Purple Flame was suppressing the curse. For the moment, it wasn't debilitating. Li Ximing clutched his spiritual artifact tightly and plunged headlong into the darkness of the storm.

Daoist Master Changxiao recalled his lantern and took a step to follow, only to freeze.

His actions ceased. He stopped the pursuit. Instead, he lifted his head and looked toward the heavens.

The rain poured, and monstrous waves clawed toward the sky. Thunder writhed like dragons, and silver cracks spiderwebbed the pitch-black night.

But the thunder in the sky no longer obeyed Changxiao's command. Instead, it converged resolutely before him, purple and white electricity intertwining, forming a flowing river of liquid lightning that snaked downward, emitting a violent, deafening roar.

Changxiao's vision was completely filled by the cascading purple-and-white brilliance. His gaze remained cold, fixed on the atmospheric thunder. The Supreme Yin silver disk began to circle his body clockwise, slowly moving to hover directly in front of his face.

*BOOM!*

A massive, shivering silver-white thunderbolt dropped from the sky, smashing into the silver disk with a deafening metallic *clang*. The lightning did not dissipate; it flowed wildly, condensing three feet away from him, stabbing relentlessly at the disk and burning away patches of black smoke.

The front seven inches of the thunderbolt were shaped like a sharp prism, flat as a buckwheat seed, buzzing as it pierced the artifact. The shaft behind it appeared to be six feet long, its light flowing, as purple-and-white electricity seemed to flow backward from it, connecting up into the heavens.

Changxiao slowly raised the twelve-cornered lantern, using its light to disperse the overwhelming glare of the thunderbolt. Only then did the shape before him stabilize, revealing its true form.

It was a silver-white, intricately patterned spear.
