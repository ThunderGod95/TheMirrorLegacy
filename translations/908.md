# Chapter 908: Scheming on the North Bank

"The people of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition are finished this time, and the riverbank is about to suffer for it. It's your good fortune, being able to reap some benefits by coming over to the north."

After saying this, Helian Wumeng laughed. "The Li Clan is a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan, after all. If I planted a divine ability in you, I'm afraid it would be discovered as soon as you crossed the river and reached the lake. Fortunately, Xuwang already used his own marvels to fix your fate and has even reserved a place for you in the Buddhist Land. You have no escape."

"If this succeeds, you'll gain a long-lived position as a Buddhist cultivator. If it fails... you'll die without a complete corpse, your very soul scattered to the winds."

Fei Qing'yi understood little about the ways of Buddhist cultivators, but the words sent a chill down his spine. He felt in his heart that the Li Clan had treated him well, but no matter how well, what could be more important than his life? With death staring him in the face, his heart turned to ice. Worse, the position of a Buddhist cultivator was dangled as bait. Hearing the Daoist Master's words, his indecision faded. He kowtowed.

"Please, Milord, instruct me..."

Helian Wumeng settled into his seat among the clouds and gave a casual command.

"When you return, you'll claim your orders and bring my people with you. They will be disguised as Southern cultivators, claiming to have fled a defeat in the north. Once you enter the grand formation and meet the Li family, just seize a few key figures. The matter will be settled."

Fei Qing'yi froze. The Li family's protocols for granting an audience were incredibly strict. It was nothing like this northern barbarian imagined. Following this plan would be throwing his life away. He immediately dropped to his knees, frantically protesting, "Milord, you misunderstand! Moongaze Lake is bound by endless rules. It's impossible to get an audience with the Li family's core members!"

Helian Wumeng wasn't surprised in the least. He regarded him with a knowing, playful smile and nodded. "Oh? Then why don't you propose a plan?"

As Fei Qing'yi met that gaze, the realization struck him.

'He's testing me!'

All his minor schemes vanished. He knelt, his limbs ice-cold. The fear in his heart solidified, paradoxically giving rise to a hysterical calm. He spoke respectfully, "The Li family's core members are extraordinary. They carry many profound treasures and are difficult to deceive. Li Jiangqian is known for his sharp mind, and Li Que'wan is even more skilled in divination... This humble one dares to ask... does Milord want to capture people, or seize items?"

Helian Wumeng's smile faded. "Either. But people are better."

Fei Qing'yi kowtowed. "In this humble one's insignificant opinion, I should use these injuries... go to the lake and report that the... the Tangdao Mountain Range has been breached in several places and urgently requires reinforcements."

Helian Wumeng shot him a glance. He had brought his people south for a reason. He'd had the Buddhist cultivators attack the Tangdao Mountain Range to pin down the injured Tinglan as she returned to the formation. He had immediately unleashed demonic cultivators to plunder Xiaoshi Mountain in the rear, cutting communications and maintaining the illusion, all while infiltrating Baijiang Creek ahead of time. He had his own comprehensive plan; how could he not understand the stakes? He merely said, "You think he'll send his core members? I doubt he'll send anyone at all."

Fei Qing'yi shook his head. "They certainly won't. Why would they need to? Milord is right here by the river. Just dispatch a few men to stir up trouble, acting as demonic cultivators. The lake fancies itself the righteous path. As long as they're sure a Purple Mansion Realm expert won't cross the river, how can they possibly sit back and ignore it?"

"I'll tell you exactly what to say!"

Helian Wumeng laughed heartily and paced in front of him. After muttering a few more instructions, he kicked the young man in the shoulder, sending the white-robed youth tumbling. "It's always easy for a divine ability to scheme against a mere Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... But are you really this terrified of dying?"

Fei Qing'yi just said, "Milord jests. Who isn't afraid of dying? This humble one can die, of course, but I cannot die like this! And I cannot die *now*!"

He kowtowed again and again. With a wave of his hand, Helian Wumeng dismissed Fei Qing'yi from the cloud. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, smiling broadly. A subordinate beside him quickly asked, "Milord, our relations with the Buddhist cultivators have always been poor... How can we let Xuwang get off so easily?"

"Haha!" Helian Wumeng shook his head, his gaze fixed on the distant formation over the lake. "Of course I won't. The man truly was just handed over by the Buddhist cultivators. His fate might be spoken for, but as for a 'position' or 'dying without a corpse'? Nonsense! It was just enough to scare him. I can't even figure out the Buddhist cultivators' tricks, so how could someone surnamed Fei? It's just a shame I don't possess a Life Divine Ability. Otherwise, none of this trouble would be necessary!"

"We must use this southern push to harvest as much blood qi as possible, but we have to be quick. After all, once those few Daoist Masters are routed and return, we'll be deep in enemy territory, isolated and unaided. That will be a real problem."

The subordinate nodded repeatedly in admiration, then added a reminder, "Aside from that, Milord, you wish to capture those core members to exchange for treasures... but... if that Daoist Master Zhaojing truly escaped, it won't take him long to arrive at his Purple Mansion Realm speed. If we dally too long, we might not have time..."

"Heh..." Helian Wumeng shook his head, amused. "Li Jiangqian? Li Que'wan? If they can't draw out Li Ximing, what value do they have?"

"As long as he comes, he'll be forced to save them. And even if he doesn't, if he tries to charge straight into the formation, he won't be able to avoid being wounded by my baleful energy divine ability. He'll be the easiest one to track..."

He gave a sinister laugh. "What did you think we came here to snatch?"

"If his timing is right, I'll just kill him along with them. That would be ideal. But if he doesn't dare to show, I'll abduct those guest elders and core members anyway. Once they're in my hands, exchanging them for the Li family's Purple Mansion Realm resources, spirit embryos, and Spiritual Artifacts... well, how hard could that be?"

***

Purple pillars pierced the sky, interspersed with pavilions and terraces shrouded in morning mist. Austere, noble patterns flowed with power inside the grand formation. Qu Bushi ascended the steps, crossed the threshold of the main hall, and bowed deeply toward the palace's interior.

The head of the hall was dim. The left window was shut tight, admitting no light, and only a few dharma lamps flickered. The main seat was empty. To the side sat a man in golden robes, holding a jade slip in one hand, which he used to lightly tap his other.

A woman sat opposite him. The side door to her right was slightly ajar, and a sliver of bright light fell across her robes. Qu Bushi, having paid his respects in the inner hall, looked toward the two core members of the Moongaze Immortal Clan who were now making the decisions. "Reporting to the Family Head," he said respectfully, "there is no news from the north. We hear the Xiaoshi Mountain region is in chaos, that the northern cultivators have invaded... It is said... many have died. We just haven't seen any life jades shatter."

"Life jades aren't always accurate for matters involving the Purple Mansion Realm."

The man was, of course, Li Jianglong. It had been some time since he had taken over the lake's affairs from his elder brother. He pressed down on the jade slip, his expression clouded with doubt. "There is a major Purple Mansion Realm battle at Xiaoshi Mountain. It's inevitable that demonic cultivators have slipped through. The Baijiang Creek area is likely full of them. With communications cut, if we still try to defend Baijiang Creek, I'm afraid we'll be overrun."

On the other side, Li Que'wan whispered, "But... it's only been a single day!"

Li Jianglong understood her meaning.

The day Kan Ziyu broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Li Ximing had emerged from seclusion and left. Li Que'wan had also quickly ended her own seclusion to travel to Purple Smoke and offer congratulations. Shortly after, a letter arrived from a cultivator at the Purple Smoke Blessed Land, stating that Daoist Master Zhaojing was resting there and would personally attend the grand banquet in three days to celebrate the new Daoist Master of the Purple Smoke Gate.

But in a flash, the world had trembled. The northern clouds flared bright and then extinguished. The ground shook violently from the direction of Xiaoshi Mountain, like a landslide or a tsunami, a terrifying sight.

By her calculations, the Purple Smoke Gate's banquet was less than a day away. It was even possible the guests from the various houses hadn't yet been seated!

This was why Li Jianglong's expression was so grim. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, fearing a joint plot by several Maha, had kept everything strictly confidential. From the perspective of the Li family and all of Jiangnan's cultivators, the north had seized the perfect opportunity to invade, striking just as Jiangnan's Daoist traditions gathered to celebrate.

Musing on this, he couldn't help but ask, "What word from my elder brother?"

Ever since the trouble started and contact was lost, Li Jiangqian had pulled his people back from Baijiang Creek to guard the north bank. At the question, Qu Bushi quickly replied, "This news came directly from him, milord. He killed several demonic cultivators today who rashly tried to cross south. Their cultivation levels weren't considered high."

As he pondered, Li Que'wan spoke. "If the Northern Buddhists invaded, they couldn't have breached the Tangdao Mountain Range instantly. It wouldn't take long for our Purple Mansion Realm experts to get there. Perhaps we just lost the initiative. The situation at Xiaoshi Mountain is unstable, and with no news, it's said to be surrounded by demonic cultivators. We shouldn't rashly cross the river to investigate."

"I know that." Li Jianglong's gaze swept over the empty main seat, his thoughts unreadable. He raised an eyebrow. "Daoist Master..."

But before he could finish, a clamor of footsteps arose from below. Cui Jueyin entered, his expression heavy. "Fei Qing'yi has fled back from the north! He's here asking for reinforcements!"

Li Jianglong's expression changed. He strode forward two paces, frowning. "Did he come straight into the formation?"

"He did not. He is waiting respectfully outside."

Cui Jueyin's answer seemed to put Li Jianglong slightly at ease. He turned to the woman beside him. Li Que'wan had one hand resting lightly, the other idly turning a small jade tablet. Her eyes were closed. After a long moment, she opened them.

"Let him in."

Li Jianglong assumed she had just performed a calculation with her shamanic arts and nodded quickly. He watched as the white-robed youth, his arm missing, staggered in from outside the hall. Fei Qing'yi collapsed to his knees and cried, "The mountains are in crisis! I beg the family to dispatch reinforcements!"

He then gave a brief account, from the chaos in the north to his escape from the formation. He deliberately omitted any mention of the Merciful Ones, saying only that the enemy was fierce and help was desperately needed. "If those positions fall, the enemy will have a clear path south. The river itself will be the next line of defense! Fortunately, Milord himself said that the northern Purple Mansion experts would not cross the river, and their main force is at the Tangdao Mountain Range. We just need to fend off the rogue cultivators and demonic cultivators coming south!"

The man was visibly agitated, his limbs trembling. Li Jianglong listened intently, his eyes sweeping over him. "Only you?"

"Reporting to Milord..." Fei Qing'yi began to stammer. But after only a few words, Li Jianglong, who was not easily fooled, sensed something was wrong. He shot to his feet, his expression turning stormy. "What is it you're hiding!"

The outburst sent Fei Qing'yi sprawling, his forehead pressed so tightly to the floor that only the back of his head was visible. "This subordinate... this subordinate lied!" he cried. "The situation was critical. There were many of the family's Qi Refining cultivators in the formation... Even though I had some strength to spare... I didn't have time... I... I only saved myself..."

This wasn't such a grievous crime. Li Jianglong helped him up, noticing the man was so overcome with emotion he could barely open his eyes. "Protector Fei has endured much."

Fei Qing'yi's voice was hoarse. "This subordinate means... with Purple Mansion experts fighting at Xiaoshi Mountain and Baijiang Creek, it's incredibly dangerous. Even though the north is asking for aid, we shouldn't necessarily go. We could be killed by the aftershocks of their battle halfway there. We should focus all efforts on defending the north bank, to prevent the demonic cultivators from harming the common folk!"

"As I fled, I saw many demonic cultivators heading south. The situation is urgent! I wish to atone for my failure and prove my heart for protecting the clan!"

'As long as the Purple Mansion experts don't cross the river, defending the north bank won't be that difficult.'

He had first proposed the impossible (a full rescue), then offered this compromise, which made his report seem more credible. Li Jianglong was moved. "I will make the arrangements... Have Protector An Siwei and Guest Elder Sun brought here!"

Fei Qing'yi kept his head bowed, saying nothing, tears streaming down his face.

But then Li Jianglong's tone shifted. "The north bank must be defended," he said gravely, "but the north cannot be ignored. Maintaining the formation and providing dharma power requires our Qi Refining and Embyronic Breathing cultivators. You are right, Baijiang Creek is full of demonic cultivators. It's one thing for a few of you to provide support, but moving a large group is too conspicuous. I will send Guest Elder Cui with some of our people to the Tangdao Mountain Range, but they will go with the people from Purple Smoke. That way, they can look out for each other."

"This subordinate obeys!" As if Fei Qing'yi cared about any of that.

Fei Qing'yi had been relieved not to see Li Jiangqian, but Li Que'wan and Li Jianglong were proving frustratingly thorough. In the end, they agreed to send people to the north bank, but only two guest elders who were probably weaker than him in a real fight!

Still, he hadn't truly expected to lure out the Li family's core members. He raised no objection and began to count silently in his head. Just as the two guest elders stepped forward, a heaven-shaking explosion ripped through the air.

"BOOM!"

Everyone looked up. Several beams of black light shot up from the north, accompanied by mournful wails. Fei Qing'yi immediately became frantic, dropping to his knees before the pair. "The north bank! My Fei clansmen are still on the north bank! I beg you both, Milords, please save them!"

Before either of them could respond, a golden light flared over the lake. The 'Eternal Brightness Steps' shone brilliantly, blocking the surging black qi. Cui Jueyin had already made his move. Streams of light rose from all over the lake as other cultivators rushed to the scene.

Fei Qing'yi seemed beside himself, immediately riding the wind out of the hall, taking An Siwei and the other guest elder with him. Li Jianglong frowned, anger rising in his face. He turned, only to see Li Que'wan's expression was frozen.

The woman shook her head, just slightly. "Let's watch for a moment," she whispered.

Although Fei Qing'yi's words were earnest, and Li Que'wan had even used the Immortal Mirror to investigate, she had found no trace of any divine ability or dharma power on him. Nor had the mirror found anything amiss on the lake, save for a few furtive demonic cultivators lurking on the periphery. Yet, every time she listened to him, she felt a profound sense of unease.

In anyone else, such unease might be mere suspicion. But Li Que'wan cultivated the 'Houshenshu', giving her a natural instinct for avoiding death and prolonging life. While that instinct wasn't identical to this feeling of anxiety... she couldn't ignore the slightest possibility. This could very well be a fatal matter.

'Even if it's not some elaborate conspiracy, it's highly possible this group of demonic cultivators is extremely powerful. Rushing out would lead to casualties. In that case, we should also observe for a moment... We can't just charge in blind.'

Li Jianglong immediately agreed, his eyes narrowing in thought. He looked at his elder sister. "We can't trust his word alone. Let's wait for our brother. He's on the north bank; he knows the situation there best. If he makes an appearance, we can decide then."

After all, knowing Li Jiangqian's cautious nature, he would have already investigated the riverbank thoroughly. If new enemies had arrived, or if there was something wrong with these demonic cultivators, he would be the first to know.

A chaotic battle had already erupted in the sky above the north bank. Though many of the Li family's cultivators had gone to the mountains, plenty of Foundation Establishment Realm experts remained. Cui Jueyin took the lead, a bright light flashing from his hand. His spell arts ignited first, transforming into blazing streams of righteous fire that scattered through the air like glowing talismans.

"BOOM!"

The righteous fire, capable of expelling demons and cleansing evil, instantly blasted the black light apart. The White Ape leaped into the sky just as a torrent of black water surged upward from the other sideit was Chen Yang.

There were four demonic cultivators in the sky, all seemingly powerful. The moment they saw Cui Jueyin, their expressions turned serious. Two immediately moved to intercept him, while another, riding a cloud of black qi, descended toward the ground. He took a gourd from his robes, leaving the last cultivator to handle the man and the ape.

As he descended, he raised the gourd high and unleashed a hurricane. It swept over the ground like a giant hand from the heavens, instantly refining all living beings into blood essence and sucking them into the gourd. In a moment, the ground was soaked in blood, and screams echoed across the sky.

"You!" Fei Qing'yi looked genuinely frantic. He immediately drew his dharma artifact and rushed forward to stop him. "You dare?!"

His voice was raw, his eyes bloodshot, causing An Siwei and the others to sigh inwardly as they rushed to assist him. The demonic cultivator opposite him obviously knew what he was playing at and sneered. "Hehe! And who are you? ...Daoist Friend Zhao!"

At his call, another plume of black qi rose, solidifying into a young man in imposing black armor, holding a sword. His cultivation was clearly profound. With a flick of his blade, he forced all three of them back.

The demonic cultivator with the gourd held his dharma artifact high, laughing maniacally. "Jiangnan is so rich! Let's finish this quick! Plunder what we can and go!"

His gourd seemed to be a dharma artifact specializing in harvesting blood qi. While it didn't look particularly profound, it absorbed the essence at an astonishing speed. It pulsed with red light that swept through the town, tearing the roofs from houses. When the light fell on mortals, it sucked their very bones and marrow dry before flying back to the gourd.

A few Qi Refining cultivators rushed to the scene but dared not approach, only managing to hurl a few Dharma Arts from a distance to block the red light. The demonic cultivator became enraged, drew his own sword, and cursed, "These ants dare to block my path!"

Below, the screams shook the heavens. The black-armored youth was incredibly strong, holding his own against all three opponents. He only occasionally revealed a flaw, as if the grade of his sword technique was too low, preventing him from bringing his full power to bear.

Fei Qing'yi, of course, knew the man was only pretending, but the gourd below had already consumed many of his Fei clansmen. His eyes turned red with genuine, bitter sorrow.

'What can I do? I can barely protect my own life... Forget it. My closest relatives are all in the mountains. Let him do as he pleases!'

The moment this demonic cultivator surnamed Zhao appeared, Cui Jueyin's expression changed, a flicker of doubt in his eyes.

'Such profound cultivation... such powerful spell arts... Even if his dharma artifact and armor look ordinary, is he really one of the rogue cultivators?'

But the battle was already joined; he couldn't just call a halt. Pinned down by his opponent, he had no choice but to send a covert mental message to the others: 'These men don't seem like rogue cultivators... Be careful!'

Fei Qing'yi's expression was a mask of grief and fury. He sent a message back to the group: 'Milord already said the Purple Mansion experts wouldn't cross the river! So what if they aren't rogue cultivators? We must kill them and protect the people of the north bank!'
