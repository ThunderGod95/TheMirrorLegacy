# Chapter 970: One Decisive Push

Li Ximing saw Si Yuanli off and returned to his seat. Li Zhouwei had already manifested and began to ask questions.

"He showed some intent to build good relations," Li Ximing sighed. "After all, circumstances are stronger than men. The Si family is not what it once was, and our family has endured. Even if he harbors some resentment, he must lower his head when required."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "The matter with the Yang family... did Granduncle mention it?"

Li Ximing let out a short laugh. "Since he didn't ask, I didn't bring it up. In any case, the Mushroom Forest Plains are Azure Pond territory. It's not like Yang Zhuo can turn around and attack Moongaze Lake. Let him stir up his own trouble."

Li Zhouwei smiled. The Underworld was, after all, an extraordinary place. Si Yuanli didn't trust the Li family enough to bring up the Yang family's affairs. He poured some tea and replied, "It's quite the coincidence. I was just in the Wilderness and saw Daoist Master Xuanyi approaching. I estimate he was looking for you, Granduncle, but he ran into me instead and struck up a conversation—it was about the Hongxue Daoist Tradition."

He paused, then continued, "According to him, Hongxue originated from the Wei-Li and still possesses some foundation. The few sects that were exterminated back then were completely carved up, but Hongxue managed to hide this one lineage underground. The Azure Pond Sect and the other powers all sensed that something must have been hidden elsewhere, which is why they went to the trouble of gathering the descendants of 'Li Ti'."

"Daoist Master Xuanyi said the place doesn't seem like a cultivator's abode, but rather a Mystic Realm."

Li Ximing grew suspicious. "How much of that is true? The Azure Pond Sect is backed by a Grotto-Heaven and relies on the high standing of a 'Great One'. It's plausible they might have a Mystic Realm. But Hongxue only had a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. How could they possess such means?"

"I asked," Li Zhouwei replied. "Apparently, the Hongxue sect was a declining branch of the Wei-Li. They happened upon a reincarnated 'Wei Emperor' and received a stroke of luck. The 'Great One' obtained an Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition—one of the 'Four Secrets'—called the 'Secret Elevated'. After that entity took everything of value, he left them the scraps and the empty shell of a Mystic Realm. This branch of the Wei-Li prospered from then on."

Only then did Li Ximing understand. He nodded silently. "A Mystic Realm, much like the Great Ning Palace back in the day, can last for centuries if left sealed. But if it's opened and not maintained by someone with sufficiently high divine abilities, I fear it won't hold for long."

"Exactly." Li Zhouwei's expression was strange. "Fortunately, that Mystic Realm was never large, and it relied on the high standing of Wanling Heaven. It remained relatively stable, allowing Hongxue to benefit from it for many years."

"Now Li Quantao has entered. Tianwan's 'Cold Qi' divine ability is not a 'Whole Pill'. She required all sorts of assistance to even get inside. But this is her opportunity. Times have changed. Wanling Heaven is constantly shaking and gradually revealing its true nature. This place is also becoming more unstable... Daoist Master Xuanyi's meaning is clear: we just have to wait. The moment something happens to Wanling Heaven, this Mystic Realm will definitely collapse."

"What a pity!" Li Ximing lamented inwardly. He had already understood the strange look in Li Zhouwei's eyes.

'To be honest,' he thought, 'our family has no need for 'Cold Qi', but a Mystic Realm is a first-rate treasure. If we could get our hands on it, it would be leagues better for concealment than the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda! We could hide so many things much more easily... But now, it's on the verge of collapse. It's clearly not fated for us.'

Seeing Li Ximing's deep regret, Li Zhouwei offered comfort. "Our family doesn't understand the arts of Great Void construction. Even if we managed to acquire a Mystic Realm, we would have no way to maintain it. Besides, the cost of maintenance is far higher than it was in ancient times. If our family were to take on such a task, the burden would surely fall to Que'Wan in the future."

Li Ximing nodded in agreement, his expression turning serious. "Wanling Heaven draws closer by the day. You absolutely must go and test your fortune. I will go and return as quickly as possible, then I will remain at the lake. I'll handle the Hongxue affair and... watch over the clan."

He voiced his concerns. "Although everyone's attention will be on Wanling Heaven, the Buddhist cultivators are treacherous. We can't guarantee that some Merciful One won't get ideas about our family. We absolutely cannot let our guard down!"

Li Zhouwei's expression gradually hardened. He left the mountain with Li Ximing, descending toward a more concealed grand formation.

"I was just pondering that very issue." He changed the subject. "'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' is the humble aspect of the Bright Yang, and its cultivation is extremely fast. After I forged the 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' immortal foundation, I received its blessing and your resources, Granduncle. In just a few years, I have already reached perfection."

"Oh?" Li Ximing showed a flash of delight. "Well, you did take the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill..."

Li Zhouwei nodded, his face grave. "Although the immortal foundation is perfect, there is certain to be conflict within the Grotto-Heaven. The possibility of injury is extremely high. If I am wounded beyond a certain point, it's very likely my immortal foundation will be damaged..."

Li Ximing weighed the implications and instantly understood his meaning. 

"You're going to try and nurture a divine ability?" he asked, inwardly shocked.

"Precisely!" Li Zhouwei had, in fact, been planning this for a long time; otherwise, he wouldn't have taken multiple Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills to advance his cultivation. His eyes burned with intensity. "Rather than risk damaging my cultivation in the Grotto-Heaven, I will make one decisive push and aim straight for a divine ability!"

Li Ximing fell silent, deep in thought.

Li Zhouwei continued, his voice firm as steel. "'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' is situated in a humble position, which is a perfect match. It's suitable for forging the immortal foundation, and just as suitable for achieving the divine ability. That is the first reason. Second, 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' is a Body Divine Ability. I am favored by the Bright Yang, and my body already possesses its own marvels, which resonates with it."

"Even if it is rash and I fail to achieve the divine ability, as long as I can push through to the Shengyang Acupoint in one go, it will make my next attempt to claim the 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' divine ability easier and faster. No matter what, that is far better than letting my cultivation go to waste!"

Li Ximing grew more hesitant. "I fear only one thing. Pushing to the Shengyang Acupoint and nurturing a divine ability takes time. Even though you are no longer a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, it is not something that can be accomplished in a year or two..."

"If you haven't succeeded by the time the Grotto-Heaven opens, won't you miss the opportunity?"

Li Zhouwei's expression was resolute. "The immortal foundation is not the issue; I can cultivate that at any time. But the Grotto-Heaven is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. If I truly run out of time and the Grotto-Heaven begins to fall, the spiritual qi of the world will become immensely vast. I will surely sense it. At that moment, I will abandon 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' and head for the Grotto-Heaven."

Li Ximing knew this junior of his was far more decisive than he. Gritting his teeth, he said, "There isn't much I can do to help... However! I once refined a certain great pill in the Eastern Sea. Its effects are exceptional, perfect for breaking through bottlenecks and calming one's qi. It nourishes the dharma body with the cold moon's clear spiritual qi and extends the life-mandate. It's a perfect match for your needs! Just take one, and it will surely aid you!"

Li Zhouwei knew exactly how precious that pill was. Li Ximing had used one during a desperate crisis, but it had been the wrong situation for it. Though he never spoke of it, he had secretly regretted it for years. This regret only deepened after he obtained a high-quality consumable like the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill, and he'd stopped mentioning it entirely.

How could he let Li Ximing take it out again? "We will not speak of this!" he said quickly. "What if the Grotto-Heaven falls just in time? Should I abandon the attempt or refuse to waste the pill? My goal is to minimize potential losses, not to guarantee a breakthrough. I absolutely cannot waste such a treasure!"

His reasoning was sound and convinced Li Ximing, who could only sigh in frustration. "It's just a pity that Si Yuanli is still so cautious. He refuses to trade pills with me. Otherwise, the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill, which is made for nurturing divine abilities, would be the most suitable for you!"

"How could things be so perfect?" Li Zhouwei just smiled and saw him off, saying no more. A thread of anticipation stirred within him.

'That Grotto-Heaven holds more than just spiritual items and Daoist Traditions. It's a grand stage for a battle. It will save my Dao-Profundity from this stagnation!'

He transformed into a streak of light and swiftly entered the formation, taking a seat within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Without hesitation, he reached into his sleeve and retrieved a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill.

'Sovereign's Perilous Tread is perfected. All that's left is this final step!'

He swallowed the pill. The roiling Bright Yang divine ability immediately began to circle within his dharma body. The clouds in his qi sea parted as a golden light shot forth, powerfully lifted by the Bright Yang divine ability and the pill's dharma power.

As this wondrous transformation ascended, pale golden scales began to materialize around the young man's neck, creeping up along his jawline toward his cheeks, giving him a ferocious, draconic appearance.

...

Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.

A faint white mist permeated the sky, while pale, jagged bones littered the ground. Amidst surges of biting cold qi, a few minor cultivators, clutching talismans, moved with extreme caution among the skeletons.

The sky was an eerie, deep purple, glowing like a massive, magnificent gemstone rather than being dark.

"What a treasure land..."

A man wielding a long-handled pole-blade stood in the air, demonic winds swirling around him as he drew the surrounding baleful qi into a vortex. Helian Wumeng stared into the Great Void with his demonic pupils, which flashed as if trying to discern something.

Beside him stood a tall, imposing middle-aged man, his hand resting on the Dharma sword at his waist. "The spiritual qi now changes three times a day," he said softly. "The initial signs are appearing."

Helian Wumeng knew his elder's Dao-Profundity was higher and that he understood these changes better. He smiled. "Have the juniors arrived?"

Helian Wujiang nodded leisurely. "Changyu and Changying have both reached Jiangbei. The two of them are pillars of the family. This is a perfect opportunity for them to fight for their fortunes."

Helian Wumeng's gaze swept across the Great Void. He saw a beam of Valley Water light rise from one side, and the blaze of True Fire flare up on another, each occupying a different quadrant. He sneered. "They've all come."

Helian Wujiang shook his head. "They've all spread their teachings far and wide, and it was a great effort to finally produce a Xindu. The families invested heavily, even preparing spiritual items for their candidates—and likely wasted many more on other hopefuls. Naturally, they want to recoup their losses. This is especially true for those few great families from Zhao State."

The Helian family had been slowly rising in recent years, escaping their predicament in Mobei and conquering numerous tribes. In doing so, they had naturally offended many, and their relations with several of the great families were strained.

Helian Wumeng was about to offer a scathing remark when he saw a golden light cascade down from another part of the Great Void like a waterfall.

An old man and a young man materialized. Both wore robes patterned with golden flames, embroidered with images of rock and wind-blown sand. The moment they appeared, their radiance illuminated the area—a truly grand display of power.

Helian Wujiang lowered his voice. "The Golden Feather Sect. That is True Monarch Taiyuan... He is the 'Gengyi Daoist Shanqing' mentioned in the scriptures. His is also a top-tier Daoist Tradition."

Helian Wumeng nodded silently. This man, who usually feared neither heaven nor earth, showed a trace of reverence at the name. "So it's him... an evergreen tree of the Metal Virtue."

But before he finished speaking, a clear cloud drifted in from the southwest, shifting and changing in the air. Several figures could be vaguely seen standing within it. They exchanged greetings with the Golden Feather Sect.

'Mount Changhuai.'

Divine abilities swirled, and colorful clouds gathered. More experts manifested in sequence, waiting in the sky. Helian Wumeng laughed. "On any other day, they're screaming to kill one another. But when it's time to carve up a Grotto-Heaven, every last one of them shows up, acting friendlier than family. The fighting stops, the killing stops..."

"Where is it any different?" Helian Wujiang smiled. "Otherwise, why would the likes of Bai Ziyu bother to get involved?"

Amidst the gathering of powerful cultivators, Helian Wumeng raised his head. His eyes quickly found a patch of brilliant light, but he did not see the person he expected. "That is...?"

Helian Wujiang's gaze was deep. "Li Ximing."

Within the somber Great Void, magnificent radiances appeared one by one. A man in a white-gold Daoist robe stood in the southern quadrant. It was Li Ximing, his hands folded in his sleeves, his gaze sweeping over the assembly.

More than half a year had passed since Li Zhouwei entered seclusion. During this time, Li Ximing had dedicated himself to cultivating spell arts and advancing his cultivation base. There had been no leisure to speak of. Aided by Talisman Qi, his Great Radiance of White Brilliance had progressed steadily. A sudden flash of inspiration had even allowed him to take a great leap forward, condensing an additional "crimson light."

This should have been a joyous occasion, but just as he finished his cultivation, he sensed the spiritual qi by the "shore" become turbulent. A bad feeling rose in his heart, and his delight vanished. Standing in the Great Void, he confirmed his fears: shadowy figures were gathering from all directions.

A streak of golden light leaped toward him, materializing into a handsome and carefree young man. It was Daoist Master Tianhuo of the Golden Feather Sect.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

"Daoist Friend Tianhuo..." Li Ximing had been feeling hesitant. Seeing Tianhuo approach him directly, he felt a measure of safety.

Tianhuo smiled freely. "Which juniors did you bring along, Daoist Friend?"

Li Ximing just shook his head with a wry smile. The young man before him was extremely sharp; he immediately and seamlessly changed the subject.

"The foundations of Wanling Heaven are beginning to show. The first things to fall will certainly be the various Mystic Realms attached to it. Do you remember the Great Ning Palace, Daoist Friend? It was the exact same situation with Anhuai Heaven back in the day!"

"These Mystic Realms are just full of things for Foundation Establishment cultivators... You and I have no need to fight over them. But sending in some juniors... that's an excellent opportunity! Sometimes, they even hold great surprises. And with us presiding up here, everyone will be restrained. There shouldn't be any serious casualties."

With just that brief explanation, Li Ximing understood completely.

'What was once a great crisis and opportunity in the eyes of a Foundation Establishment cultivator is nothing special to those who wield divine abilities... My own family's elder acted as a blade for the Azure Pond Sect, doing this exact same job!'

'If that's the case, Minggong and the others can absolutely go in and try... especially Ding Weizeng! He possesses the marvel of 'slipping the cage'. He can definitely enter and exit safely. It's a shame 'Little Cui' is gone...'

Thinking this way, he realized it meant there was still a decent amount of time. Li Ximing felt a secret joy. He hadn't expected Daoist Master Tianhuo to be so warm.

Tianhuo smiled and said, "Have you made arrangements on the lake? My sect's juniors will also be heading here. If you are interested, Daoist Friend, we can have them enter together. They can look out for one another!"
