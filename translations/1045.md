# Chapter 1045: The Qilin's Son

Tian Langzhi’s words hung in the air, giving Jiang Toushou pause. The envoy from Mount Dayang seemed deeply wary of the Way of Compassion. Jiang Toushou lowered his gaze again to the bronze bowl in his hands, and Tian Langzhi decided to strike while the iron was hot.

"Head of House, think about it. Is it not so? Did Qi Lanyan acquiesce, or even offer support, because he owes us some great favor? Of course not. It must be because he harbors the same ambitions in his own heart. Since that's the case, what does it matter who he cooperates with? Why should he be bound to us alone?"

"None of the other lords can spare a hand… This opportunity has presented itself, but when the time comes, who can say which side will be able to act first? As long as the Head of House gives the order, I am not afraid of offending anyone."

Tian Langzhi’s eyes narrowed as he lowered his voice. "As for Minghui, Gongsun Bei has his reservations about him, and Qi Lanyan utterly detests Jinlian. He wasn't present for the battle, yet he told me twice that the Lotus Temple is useless, that the disciple-brothers Minghui and Mingxiang would not give their all."

"Today, Minghui proved his incompetence. And I believe Mingxiang was holding back as well. Since the Lotus Temple refuses to contribute its strength, why should we show them any mercy?"

Jiang Toushou mulled this over for a long time before a faint smile touched his lips. "Liangli, your considerations are astute. I will inquire about this matter when I return."

"As for Minghui," he continued, "we'll hold this failure over his head and find ways to use him. The next time we attack the south or defend against the Great Song, we'll throw him right in Yang Ruiyi's path. Yang Ruiyi wields Exiled Qi; that will force his hand. He’ll have no choice but to fight with everything he has."

"If they can't defeat him and end up crippled or killed by the Yang Clan, it will serve as a fitting explanation for Jinlian. And if he flees without fighting, we'll have cause to capture him… and punish him for his crimes in the name of Mount Dayang."

---

High in the sky, the two golden figures fell silent. Below, Minghui’s heart sank like a stone. Jiang Toushou had always been at odds with his Way of Joyful Bliss; nothing good could come of this. As expected, the man in the sky spoke, a cold smile on his face.

"Minghui, your senses are impure, and your heart is filled with greed and malice. You should be severely punished. However, considering the many good deeds of the Way of Joyful Bliss, the diligence of your disciple-brother, and the high prestige of your master, we shall merely record this transgression. You and your disciple-brother are ordered to guard the riverbank."

The smile vanished from his face, replaced by a chilling indifference. "If you fail again… the mountain will have to punish you severely."

If they had ordered him thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil or a sea of fire, Minghui might have felt a sense of relief. But this light sentence terrified him.

'My master, highly respected? Everyone knows what a terrible reputation he has! This is a plot to kill me!'

The Five-Eyed creature sizzled and popped as it tumbled in the boiling oil. Minghui could only kowtow, crying out, "I have failed you, my lords! I am consumed by guilt! I beg only for punishment to be inflicted upon my body… as a show of my sincerity!"

But how could the two possibly let him off? After a few more hollow words of praise, they were about to dismiss him lightly when Minghui burst into tears.

"The two virtuous masters are willing to show me mercy, but I cannot forgive myself! If you allow me to walk out of this place unharmed… I will cripple my own Dharma Body to show my gratitude!"

His words made Jiang Toushou’s gaze turn to ice. "You refuse to strive for betterment and seek only to avoid battle. I can personally escort you to Mount Dayang and explain this matter before all the Buddhists. Let's see what you have to say for yourself then."

On any other day, Minghui might have actually gone with him. Anything was better than living under the constant shadow of their schemes. But he thought of the matters at the riverbank. If he were gone, his disciple-brother Mingxiang was bound to make a mistake, and furthermore, he would lose the chance to prove his loyalty to that _other_ master. Finally, he stifled his wails and retreated sullenly.

The moment he stepped out of the great hall, his expression darkened. His disciple-brother, Mingxiang, was waiting for him on the steps. With a grave look, Minghui sent a transmission, "The situation has changed. Someone from Mount Dayang is here… it’s Jiang Toushou. We can’t get away. I fear our lives are in danger!"

Mingxiang frowned, shaking his head as he transmitted back, "I regret ever agreeing to that fellow from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm!"

Minghui’s face was grim. "This has nothing to do with him… This isn't something we could have resolved by agreeing or disagreeing. Given the situation today, even if we hadn't promised Fachang anything, Jiang Toushou would have come, and we would have been summoned all the same. The conflict between the north and south has shifted. Qi Lanyan has made the first move to upset the balance, and the greed of the various Daoist traditions for the Li Clan’s territory can no longer be suppressed!"

Having spent more time in the mortal world, Minghui had more experience than his disciple-brother, who spent his years in closed-door cultivation. He quickly pieced together the situation. Mingxiang’s expression changed as he looked at his junior with new gravity.

"The most urgent task," Minghui said, his tone serious, "is to inform our master. I must return at once. He will soon order me to depart for my post… We cannot delay!"

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain, brilliant light pulsed through the peaks. A man in black robes frowned, looking at Li Zhouwei. "King Wei, perhaps you should take your medicine first."

"It's nothing," Li Zhouwei said, shaking his head. He gestured for the man to sit beside him. Sima Yuanli, who had followed them all the way with an indescribably awkward expression, also stopped and bowed with a sigh.

"I… I was foolish and incompetent, allowing King Wei to fall into such danger… It is a grievous sin! I should be punished!"

Sima Yuanli had been regretting his actions for some time. This was not the era of the Azure Pond Sect; what influence did the Sima Family have left? He didn't dare hold a grudge against the Li family, and he certainly couldn't afford for Li Zhouwei to hold one against him.

'White Cicada is vengeful over the smallest slight, and while White Qilin might be better, he's no saint either! Today, my rescue was delayed, yet he still escaped. In the future, during the great war between north and south, what if he has his own 'delayed rescue'? I wouldn't stand a chance!'

He knew he couldn't just brush this off. He had to address it directly. He hurriedly took out the Azure Grace Profound Gourd to heal Li Zhouwei while lamenting, "King Wei must believe me!"

A wave of bitterness washed over him. He remembered the old days, when Li Ximing was in seclusion seeking death and he, Sima Yuanli, presided over the Azure Pond Sect. Back then, he had spoken of Li Zhouwei with casual disdain—a cornered man with death written all over him. Now, he was the subordinate one. He had hesitated for just a moment to lend his treasure, and now he had to beg for mercy, respectfully addressing him as King Wei. The world had changed, and people with it. Half-genuine tears of sorrow welled in Sima Yuanli’s eyes. "We are family by marriage. Seeing King Wei so gravely injured fills me with shame."

Li Zhouwei, however, did not blame him. He waved a hand dismissively. "The Huai River Map is a precious treasure. It was my fault for requesting it so rashly. Daoist Master, please don't trouble yourself over it."

Sima Yuanli nodded repeatedly. Nearby, Yang Ruiyi watched the exchange with amusement, his mind racing. 'This Daoist Master Sima is a far cry from Si Boxiu… I can't believe Si Boxiu was comfortable letting him run things on the mainland. Hah… his only saving grace is his decent talent, a notch above Ning Wan's.'

Once their conversation ended, Yang Ruiyi spoke up. "With the west in turmoil and the Northern Zhao watching like a tiger, this disaster on the lake has truly shaken the people's hearts. As for His Majesty's side… I will go and inquire, and I will be sure to report everything on King Wei's behalf."

Li Zhouwei remained impassive, forcing a smile. "General, your timely reinforcements were a great blessing to us on the lake. The Buddhist cultivators will not let Ting Province go. This is only the beginning."

Yang Ruiyi shook his head with a slight sigh. "Qi Lanyan will not get away with what happened today for free." He smoothed his sleeve. "I wonder where fellow Daoist Zhaojing is? With King Wei injured, I'm afraid Ting Province cannot do without him."

Li Zhouwei’s expression was perfectly calm. "My elder is in seclusion at a critical juncture of his breakthrough. It's impossible to say what year or month he might see progress. I dare not disturb him, for fear of causing all his previous efforts to be in vain."

'By my calculations, it should be about time…' Yang Ruiyi thought. Li Ximing couldn't possibly sit still with Li Zhouwei injured like this. He did a quick calculation and was ninety percent convinced. "Since that is the case, I should dispatch a Daoist Master to the Wilderness to guard the border, so that King Wei can recuperate properly. I wonder… does King Wei have anyone in mind?"

Li Zhouwei glanced at Sima Yuanli beside him and said seriously, "Fellow Daoist Sima is a good candidate, but if the north has ill intentions, he may not even be able to protect himself. We must ask the King of Yuyang to make a trip."

Hearing him bring up Chen Yin, Sima Yuanli secretly breathed a sigh of relief and nodded. "The King of Yuyang has reached the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, which is no small feat. His strength has grown considerably, and he is very reliable… He is also acquainted with Daoist Master Cheng, which would make coordinating reinforcements convenient."

At the mention of Daoist Master Cheng, Li Zhouwei’s expression subtly tightened. But Yang Ruiyi simply said coolly, "Indeed. The two Daoist Masters of the Sword Gate have parted on bad terms, and Lingmei is in seclusion. You won't have to worry about him being uncooperative."

Sima Yuanli fell silent, swallowing hard. The atmosphere grew heavy. Fortunately, the clouds outside the mountain began to churn, and another Daoist Master arrived, descending gracefully upon a divine ability.

The Daoist Master was a strikingly beautiful woman dressed in pale green robes, her waterfall of black hair cascading down her back. With a gentle smile, she gave a slight bow. "Reporting to the Grand General, Lingu Lanying has returned to give her report."

Yang Ruiyi glanced at her, a hint of a smile on his face. He noticed a man standing beside her among the clouds. Though his features were not exceptional, his armor was battered and he was covered in dust, as if he had just come from a battlefield. A lingering killing intent still smoldered in his golden eyes, giving him a formidable air.

Li Zhouwei set down the cup in his hand, a ripple of emotion in his eyes. This man was none other than his own legitimate son and heir, the one publicly known as the Second Young Master, Li Jianglong!

Li Jianglong faced the crowd, his expression unchanging, and bowed. "Greetings, Father! Greetings, esteemed Daoist Masters!"

Lingu Lanying smiled and looked at him as well. "So this is King Wei. It is truly a case of 'a tiger father will not have a dog son.' The Second Young Master won a great victory over the Buddhist cultivators in the Wilderness, joined forces with the Song army, and intercepted the defeated northern forces for us… His military achievements are outstanding!"

"Oh?" Yang Ruiyi’s interest was piqued. He observed the young man closely.

Lingu Lanying continued her praise. "The Zhao army was crossing the river when the Young Master shattered their formation, throwing them into chaos. Over ten thousand were killed or injured, and large numbers of Zhao troops were forced to remain in the Wilderness. We even captured two direct descendants of the Gongsun family… With the Young Master's surprise attack, our victory was magnified more than tenfold!"

"I was late to arrive, but I brought him back with me!" she finished, her smile polite, seemingly filled with nothing but goodwill.

Yang Ruiyi took the opportunity to pull Li Jianglong over, asking his age and marital status before smiling. "But we can't forget your younger brother… Li Jiangxia, was it? He deserves great credit for the Li family's bloody stand. Though his contribution was not as prominent as yours, it cannot be ignored."

The Grand General turned back to Li Zhouwei and sighed. "I was just thinking about who should lead the troops in the Wilderness, but I forgot that King Wei's sons are all outstanding talents. It's perfect for him to manage this matter. Why don't I take him back with me to ask the Monarch for a title? It would be a fitting reward for him!"

Having said this, the man gave no one a chance to speak. He stood up, a smile on his face, and swept his gaze over the three of them. "Have any of you heard of… the Law of the Celestial Dynasty?"

Lingu Lanying paused, shaking her head with some hesitation. Sima Yuanli nodded awkwardly.

Yang Ruiyi smiled. "The Law of the Celestial Dynasty was first created by Emperor Wei, derived from the ancient methods of incense offerings and mountain supervision. He was a peerless genius, favored by the Bright Yang, and he pushed this art to its absolute pinnacle. After the Wei-Li dynasty was destroyed, the Buddhist cultivators learned it and used it to complete the final piece of their Buddhist Land's cultivation path. The rise of Maha and the Merciful One was also thanks to this law."

"And while my Song Court does not follow the way of the Celestial Dynasty, we are similarly favored by the heavens. Thus, we have the Martial Cultivation Star shining upon us, blessing all our officials. His Majesty the Monarch built the Purple and Gold Hall in the imperial capital precisely to gather the light of Martial Cultivation and wield its profound methods."

Hearing this, Sima Yuanli looked up thoughtfully, a glimmer of shock appearing in his pupils.

Yang Ruiyi raised his head, his expression solemn. "Those who enter the Purple and Gold Hall receive the protection of Tianxiu and Tianwu. Their spiritual sense is cleared, and their destiny, weapons, and Dharma Body are elevated. It is of immense help for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm in the future. Diligent practice of martial cultivation and profound arts is what it means to be a Holder of the Profound."

He moved his lips slightly, and his ordinary face suddenly took on an ethereal quality. "And a Holder of the Profound… when on a campaign for the Emperor, may borrow a Tianwu divine ability."

As soon as these words were spoken, Lingu Lanying’s eyebrows shot up. A storm was raging in her heart. 'No wonder… no wonder he brought up the Celestial Dynasty. No wonder he mentioned Maha and the Merciful One!'

The Wei-Li's Law of the Celestial Dynasty was simple: to hold an office was to hold power. Whether you were a mortal with no cultivation or a minor cultivator, once you held an official position, you gained a corresponding level of power. This "Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace" was an imitation of the Wei-Li system!

'No wonder the Song Court isn't the least bit worried about the northern border! No wonder the Cheng Clan's attitude changed so drastically after entering the palace, sending their disciples into the prefectures. Even with Maha and the Merciful One pressing down on them, he has a way to counter it and defend this border!'

'With an offer like this, which family wouldn't flock to serve the Song Court? Even if a few Daoist Masters harbor no goodwill towards the court, what about their disciples? Who wouldn't want the blessing of Tianwu? Who wouldn't want to possess a divine ability!'

'Once you've tasted the power of a divine ability, who would be willing to go back to being ordinary! As long as those who enter the palace desire and cannot let go of this official position, do they belong to the Song Court or to their own families? This is cutting the ground from under their feet… These are the true methods of the Underworld!'

Yang Ruiyi's casual words had unleashed a tidal wave in her heart. Sima Yuanli was also speechless, his hand gripping the table so tightly his knuckles were white. The entire mountainside fell silent, with only the whistling of the wind.

Yang Ruiyi turned his head and smiled. "What does King Wei think?"

Li Zhouwei remained composed. He lowered his gaze to look at his son.

Li Jianglong had always been exceptionally obedient. He had the Chen Clan's blood in him; his features were not as striking as Li Jiangxia's and he resembled his father less, but he was far more compliant. He had few confidants of his own, and in his years managing the family's affairs on the island, all matters, large and small, passed through his hands without any sign of favoritism.

But now, this ever-obedient child knelt respectfully on the ground, silent, his head bowed. His golden eyes were fixed on the floor, leaving his father with only a view of his profile.

In that instant, the line of his brow on that profile softened, taking on a familiar look that made Li Zhouwei's gaze freeze and his lips part slightly.

Perhaps it was the pain from his injuries. In the end, King Wei did not speak. He let out a breath and then forced a smile.

"Second Young Master, express your gratitude."
