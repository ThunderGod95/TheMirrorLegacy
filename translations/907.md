# Chapter 907: Shattered Jade

Thunder and crimson fire rained from the heavens. Helian Wujiang knew Yehui's appearance spelled the end of any possible truce. He didn't waste words questioning him as the monk had. Instead, black qi streamed from his eyes as he channeled his divine ability, resisting the deluge of purple water.

Yehui hailed from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. Helian Wujiang was already exhausted from a long battle and had now lost the initiative. He was instantly plunged into dire straits. The deep-black 'Rakshasa Sea' that had blanketed the sky was suppressed by the purple water, dissolving into frigid mist and tumbling away, gradually revealing the bright sky above.

Li Ximing used an ability to hover in the air, seizing a momentary respite. The medicinal pill he had taken began to work. His dharma power, which had been sluggish and constrained by the baleful qi, started to flow smoothly once more, circulating through his Dharma Body.

The great battle was already past its peak when Helian Wujiang appeared. Just as that Spiritual Blade cut its way toward him, Daoist Master Luo's voice finally echoed in his ear, announcing the arrival of reinforcements.

Li Ximing didn't quite trust him. He used his 'Shadowsight' ability to investigate and only then discovered the reinforcement was Yehui.

'If Yehui showed up, I wouldn't know if he was here to help me or kill me. To Helian Wujiang, Yehui is just a nuisance. But to me, in my current state, he's lethal. Yehui isn't Helian Wujiang. Several of his Capital Guard abilities can influence the Great Void—escaping from him is a challenge of an entirely different magnitude.'

'By all rights, I should have fled already. The only reassuring fact was that this Daoist Master had been waiting silently in the Great Void near Helian Wujiang, not lurking near me.'

Now, the two were locked in combat. Li Ximing assisted with his own abilities and spell arts while simultaneously consuming pills to regulate his breathing. He soon regained a stable footing among the clouds, his heart a tangle of complex emotions.

'So, the day has actually come... where I'm fighting on the same side as Yehui.'

Helian Wujiang's situation became desperate.

Yehui's 'Sorrowful Southern Water' and 'Eastern Feather Mountain' abilities created a lockdown. His Capital Guard techniques, designed to exorcise ghosts and animate spirits, proved strangely effective against the baleful qi. The 'Sorrowful Southern Water' in particular completely neutralized the 'Sea of Rakshasa'. The skies were swept clean of baleful qi, leaving only a howling, frigid wind that felt like the precursor to a blizzard.

With his 'Sea of Rakshasa' broken, the divine power of Helian Wujiang's Dharma Body was greatly diminished. The lightning in the sky, however, continued to strike relentlessly. Worse, Li Ximing was harassing him from the sidelines. Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light and the Radiant Celestial Wave Art kept him pinned. A strike of Heavenly Light from one side, a wave of Radiance from the other, and Shichuan dispelling any illusion he tried to form—it was an impossible situation.

After several more exchanges, Helian Wujiang was set on retreating. He commanded his black qi to weave through the lightning, neutralizing Yehui's Dharma Arts, until at last, his fingers closed around the short blade at his waist!

"Omm..."

Yehui just laughed.

He had been observing from the sidelines for a long time and was intimately familiar with Helian Wujiang's techniques. How could he forget this one? With a light flick of his finger, the thunder and fire in the sky converged, and from within their depths, a hazy, yellow brilliance emerged.

Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release!

This Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release had been brewing for who knows how long, hidden within the clouds. It was a technique from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. Once the profound light locked on, it was impossible to shake, near or far. When used against a Spiritual Artifact, it had the divine effect of severing the item's connection to its wielder's ability and revealing its true form.

It now shot from Yehui's fingertip, seeming both far and near as it circled. The short blade's intended target—Yehui—seemed to split like a mirror image, and the attack was diverted, striking the profound light instead.

The Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release, like a shadow beneath the moon, then split from its end into three hazy afterimages. A soft sound echoed:

"Bang!"

One of the three hazy afterimages vanished. The purple water was rent apart by the churning blade-qi. Helian Wujiang's expression was grim. The pitch-black short blade reappeared before him, the power on the Spiritual Artifact still surging. Though undamaged, it had clearly failed to find its mark.

Yehui didn't wait, striding forward on the lightning.

Helian Wujiang's reaction was instantaneous. Black smoke billowed from his feet as his escape arts activated, ready to spirit him away.

But the young man before him simply smiled and raised a palm.

'Western Heaven Plateau!'

The Great Void warped. Snow began to fall over a sudden, impossibly steep landscape. An endless gale, carrying flurries of snow, materialized from nothing beside him.

The wind, a pale azure, closed in and locked Helian Wujiang in place. Yehui's long hair whipped about in the gale. The two remaining Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release streams shot from a distance and merged into the back of his head. A fiery, electric light ignited in his pupils. His voice boomed like thunder:

"Hah!"

The shout itself was unremarkable, but empowered by the Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release, it struck Helian Wujiang's spirit. His body shuddered, his eyes glazed over with confusion, and his defenses shattered. Yehui, already before him, formed his palm into a blade and chopped down.

The blow instantly tore him open, sending baleful qi spilling out. But Helian Wujiang was no easy foe. His mouth gaped open, swelling to the size of a man. The bloody maw inhaled Yehui's attack and spat out a white talisman.

The talisman unfurled to a length of over ten feet, dissolving the incoming light as it draped itself over him. Though Helian Wujiang coughed up blood, his baleful qi scattering, wounded by the spell arts and unable to gather his power, he still managed to summon a gust of wind that blew him back several yards.

Having gained a moment's distance, Helian Wujiang didn't hesitate. He activated 'Incessant Calamity,' and his body dissolved into roiling clouds of baleful qi, scattering in every direction.

Yehui smiled coldly. The talismans in the sky began to activate, but a sound like a landslide and a tsunami roared from the distant horizon. Thunder cracked as a sheet of white qi rose, sweeping the crimson light from the sky.

His expression shifted. The ability in his hands halted. A sudden, deep wariness made him hesitate, and a name surfaced in his mind:

"Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao... Wei Xuanyin!"

In that brief instant of hesitation, as Helian Wujiang's form scattered into black qi, two golden, scaled insects burst free from the dispersing mist.

The creatures had twelve feet, two wings, and four-segmented bodies covered in fine scales. They trailed multicolored light and a furious wind, rising like dragons shedding their chains. Emitting a brilliant golden glow, they shot forward like meteors.

"Excellent!"

Li Ximing was overjoyed. He stepped forward, allowing one of the wind-riding insects to land on his disfigured face. The creature seemed to roll over in delight before coiling inside his nasal cavity. White bone emerged, flesh and sinew knitted together, and his brilliant golden eyes manifested once more.

The other scaled insect writhed, spat blood, and died. Its corpse attached itself to his severed limb. It transformed into long bone, its own flesh transmuting into muscle and skin. The arm that had been bitten off reappeared, fully restored.

These two scaled insects were, in fact, his own severed body parts, transformed!

The severed parts had been suppressed by Helian Wujiang's power, not yet refined. Now that he was forced to disperse into baleful qi and flee for his life, the body parts obediently returned to their master.

Now, Li Ximing was bathed in radiant Heavenly Light. Though a faint line remained on the bridge of his nose, it was barely visible without close inspection. At least his Dharma Body no longer looked so wretched.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

The baleful qi receded, and the purple water dissipated. Yehui made no move to pursue. He turned back and smiled.

"Long time no see."

Helian Wujiang's retreat was inevitable. Yehui had waited long on the sidelines; appearing just to force him back would have been enough. But he had gone further, using his spell arts to break his opponent's technique and free the trapped body parts. This was a clear show of goodwill. Despite his unease, Li Ximing inclined his head.

"My thanks, Daoist Friend..."

But before he could finish, a soft *clack* sounded at his waist.

"Clack!"

The jade talisman at his waist flashed faintly, a web of cracks spreading across its surface. With a flicker of black light, it instantly exploded into fine powder that drifted down his robes.

'This is bad...'

Li Ximing's heart sank, and a chill crept over him.

'That talisman was from Kui Qi of the Great Xiukui Monastery. I had one, and Daoist Master Luo had one. We could sense each other through them, and they were our signal to act... For it to shatter now... it's a signal to drop everything and return to the defenses at Tangdao Mountain immediately.'

'I'm afraid something has happened to Kui Qi...'

'Ever since Helian Wujiang appeared, I knew this would be trouble. My only comfort was that Kui Qi had sent the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. That suggested he had, at least, anticipated Helian Wujiang's arrival...'

'But the shattering talisman confirms my fears.' He raised his head, gazing north.

The sky was dim, flickering erratically. The crimson glow on the horizon was receding at an incredible speed, but there were no other signs of disturbance.

'It's likely being concealed by some treasure. The fact that I can't see a massive flare of light... is definitely not a good sign.'

With Helian Wujiang gone, the two monks had no choice but to retreat into the Great Void. Daoist Master Luo made no attempt to delay them or team up with Yehui for a killing blow; he had clearly been startled by his own talisman shattering. He turned, saw Yehui standing with his hands clasped behind his back, and said, his face wrought with anxiety:

"Let's go, let's go! We have to leave now!"

Neither of them was inclined to linger. Li Ximing was injured and didn't want to stay. They immediately prepared to enter the Great Void, only to see Yehui's expression darken.

"Leave? And where are you two Daoist Friends going?"

The question was grim, but it had to be faced. They had no idea how the main forces of the Supreme Yang Dao were faring. Should they return to their own sects, or proceed to Tangdao Mountain?

Though none of the three spoke, the gravity of the situation needed no words.

If the Supreme Yang Dao had been victorious and was retreating from Luoxia, their first priority would have been to relieve their allies. One or two Daoist Masters should have arrived by now to deal with those Merciful Ones, or at the very least, to provide support and cover a safe retreat.

But there wasn't a single shadow. There was only the shattered talisman—a highest-level alert demanding all forces converge on Tangdao Mountain. It all pointed to one conclusion: the Supreme Yang Dao hadn't fought to a draw. They had likely suffered a minor defeat, or perhaps... a complete rout.

'Kui Qi's plan was unexpected, but it seems the enemy countered it. If Helian Wujiang could appear here, how few people could be at Luoxia? How few at Xiaoshi Mountain?'

'If Yehui hadn't been here, Caishan would have ended in a minor defeat as well. And Yehui doesn't have a warning talisman. His presence wasn't pre-arranged with the Supreme Yang Dao. If it had been, he should have gone to Luoxia. Caishan isn't the decisive battleground!'

'He must have rushed back from overseas to protect his sect... He probably has his own agenda, but even so, the other two battlefields won't be lucky enough to have a Yehui show up to help!'

'Going to Tangdao Mountain... I can't say if it's safe. I have the Immortal Mirror; I could detect an ambush if the Northern forces had won and were lying in wait. But regardless, there would certainly be one or two battles to fight, and my current condition is terrible.'

'Even though I recovered two parts of my Dharma Body, which greatly reduces the time and effort for repair, those parts are saturated with unstable baleful qi. I don't have time to refine it. For the short term, it's no different from not having them back at all...'

'If I go over in this state, I'm not even confident I could win against a Merciful One.'

Li Ximing looked up at Daoist Master Luo, only to see his grim expression.

"That's hard to say," Daoist Master Luo said. "While I urgently need that cultivation method from Fairy Ning, the Supreme Yang Dao has many cultivators. It would be better if Hengzhu wasn't there, but with the Chunyi Dao Gate present, they'll inevitably look down on me. It's not convenient for me to just waltz into Tangdao..."

"I will follow along in the Great Void. I'll just trouble you, Daoist Friend, to mention me to the others. If a major battle breaks out, I can appear and provide support!"

Daoist Master Luo was a fiend from the Southern Borderlands and inherently cunning. With these words, he pushed the entire burden onto Li Ximing. Li Ximing's mind raced.

'A defeat at Luoxia means they've scattered. It's questionable if the allied Daoist Masters will even go to Tangdao Mountain...'

'If I were the Northern Buddhists, where would I go now? Tangdao Mountain?'

'It has to be Xiaoshi Mountain!'

'The great array at Tangdao Mountain can't cover the entire Tangdao Mountain Range. The outer ridges are protected only by smaller, ordinary formations. Right in front is Xiaoshi Mountain, where Tinglan is. As long as the cultivators there hold, it's fine. But if it falls, the Northern forces can punch straight through to Baijiang Creek! Why would those Buddhist cultivators and demonic cultivators bother trying to crack the hardest nut?'

'If Baijiang Creek is lost, all the families on the shore will be in jeopardy. Their retreat will be cut off, and I'll be forced to return to the northern bank myself!'

His expression turned grim. He cupped his hands.

"Pardon me, everyone. I must go to Xiaoshi Mountain first. If Daoist Friend Tinglan has retreated... the Northern forces might already be pushing into Baijiang Creek. The fire is at my own doorstep!"

Without waiting for a reply, Li Ximing transformed into a streak of light and sped away. Daoist Master Luo started to speak, then stopped, watching him go with a puzzled expression.

"Zhaojing is in that condition. Even if someone really is attacking Moongaze Lake, what can he do? Isn't he just throwing his life away? If you ask me, he should be finding a corner to heal. Both places are dangerous; why walk right into a trap?"

He then glanced at Yehui, only to find the young man's expression was just as sour.

'...Baijiang Creek is at the Li Clan's doorstep, but isn't it at the Capital immortals Dao's as well?'

Daoist Master Luo had a sudden realization and immediately said:

"Brother, are you going too?"

But Yehui narrowed his eyes and shook his head. He was not Li Ximing. Frankly, aside from the Guan Gongxiao siblings, he didn't care about anyone else. He certainly didn't care about the casualties among the common folk or cultivators in his territory. He just waved his hand.

"Why worry so much? My mountain gate has a Purple Mansion great array; it won't be broken so easily. The worst that can happen is the population and resources get plundered. Those two siblings are still at Tangdao Mountain. I'll go with you. At the very least, I need to get them out."

The fiend sighed, summoned an Azure Crow Qi wind, and rode his ability south toward Tangdao Mountain with Daoist Master Luo. "You've been away all these years. Did you find anything good?" he asked.

Yehui's relationship with him was surprisingly close. He waved his hand.

"Nothing much. I fought with Changxiao over a treasure from the Encompassing Profoundity and spent a few years recovering. Now that I'm back, I suspect he's going to defect to the Northern side."

Daoist Master Luo mulled this over and replied:

"I have a feeling this time is different. Wei Xuanyin is not an easy man to plot against. He will definitely come this time. If the Way of Compassion still gives their full support, people are going to die."

Yehui's expression was neutral. Daoist Master Luo chuckled.

"It just has nothing to do with me... Who cares? As long as I get the cultivation method, it's fine. If the situation drags out into a stalemate, and the fight lasts a long time, maybe I can pick up a few more things... That would be wonderful."

"Look, the Northern side plays the villain and carves flesh from them. We play the hero... and don't we also carve flesh from them? Someone always has to be fed. Look at that Zhaojing. His Daoist tradition is orthodox, and look how much he's already devoured. Our interests align, and the Supreme Yang is just more generous."

"It's rare for a demonic cultivator like me to get a few scraps of oil, and now you're running over to share in the profits!"

Daoist Master Luo pointed at him with a laugh. Yehui, standing with his hands behind his back, wasn't annoyed. He just chuckled.

"You fiend!"

Daoist Master Luo sneered and replied:

"Fiend? I may be a fiend, but at least I don't plot against my own apprentices and children. Even when I harvest blood qi, I take it from wicked tyrants and landlords in remote valleys—people who have nothing to do with me. If I'm a fiend, what does that make the likes of Sumian and Qulei? You might as well just call them animals."

That word, 'animals,' made Yehui lower his head slightly. His lips moved, and with his gaze downcast, he murmured:

"The quest for survival, for strength, for freedom... it's not something that can be judged by conscience or morality."

"Heh!"

Daoist Master Luo spat. For all these years, he had been branded a fiend by the people of Jiangnan and those further north. Though he never said it, he was clearly unhappy about it. With a sarcastic look, he retorted:

"Then you tell me, besides conscience itself, what *is* judged by conscience? As for how 'radiant' the Supreme Yang Dao is, I think Li Jiangqun knows best! The opera they're performing today is the same one they performed on the lake five hundred years ago!"

...

Baijiang Creek.

The lush vegetation swayed in the gale, bent low to the ground. Not a single person was in sight. There was only a relentless, sun-blotting wind churning the clouds...

A sound like rolling thunder echoed from the horizon, punctuated by the continuous shattering of formations. Streaks of golden light tore through the sky, kicking up flurries of leaves. A lone figure, cloaked in a frigid wind, flew just above the ground.

It was a one-armed man. He was covered in filth, his face streaked with blood. Though handsome, his desperate flight and injuries made him look wretched. Blood kept welling up in his mouth, but he dared not spit, lest it freeze and reveal his trail. He had no choice but to swallow it back down.

'Xiaoshi Mountain is finished... Outside the main array at Tangdao Mountain, it's a sea of blood... Master Monks everywhere, but not a single Daoist Master in sight...'

Deep, residual terror filled his eyes.

Fei Qing'yi hadn't been assigned to the Tangdao Mountain garrison for long. The first batch of Li family cultivators had followed Li Jiangxia into Baijiang Creek. After consolidating, they left a few units behind and led the Capital immortals Dao forces to Tangdao Mountain.

It wasn't until the Buddhist cultivators became more active that the Li family sent a second wave of reinforcements, led by Fei Qing'yi himself. The Lord Wen assigning personnel heard his name and placed him on the relatively quiet southern flank...

But he never expected Xiaoshi Mountain to be conquered, attacked by three Merciful Ones. Not only did no Daoist Master emerge from the main array, but the garrison was also in dire straits. Fortunately, the formation Fei Qing'yi was guarding was remote, so he still received news. He had no intention of dying for the Supreme Yang Dao. Seeing the formations, large and small, fall one after another, he immediately abandoned his post, left his cultivators behind, and fled.

He hadn't expected to be pursued by several Master Monks, whose numbers only grew along the way, forming an imposing force. He didn't dare fight back, simply fleeing despite his injuries. He ran all the way to the border of Baijiang Creek before the group of Master Monks, apparently wary of something, finally dispersed.

He dragged himself here, at the end of his rope. He checked his surroundings—it was Manghuazi Mountain, still a good distance from the lake. Suddenly, a heaven-shaking gale erupted around him. Black clouds blotted out the sun, as if he had entered a demon realm.

This terrified him so much his limbs went weak. He turned to run, but had barely gone any distance when a beam of demonic light descended, smashing into the frigid wind at his feet with a *boom*. The impact scattered his protective qi and made him spray a mouthful of blood. The demonic light leaped and coiled, wrapping around his torso. His vision went black.

He heard only the rush of wind, and then his vision returned:

*Thump!*

He had been thrown impossibly high and had tumbled onto a cloud, landing on dark, swirling baleful qi. He knew he was done for. He scrambled to his feet but didn't dare look up. He caught a glimpse of a line of cultivators standing on either side and immediately kowtowed.

"Greetings, my lord! Greetings, my lord!"

"Oh?"

The person at the head of the group sounded like a young man. Then, he heard someone to his left say with a tremble:

"R-reporting, my lord... This subordinate was negligent... I let an Immortal cultivator slip through..."

"Hahahaha!"

A hearty laugh came from the head of the group, his tone casual.

"What does it matter? My men are all scattered across several prefectures, plundering everywhere. Who has time to watch our backs?"

Fei Qing'yi was sweating profusely. He saw a pair of silver-white boots stop in front of him, and a voice spoke from above:

"Even if your defenses were tight, you couldn't have stopped this man. Xuwang sent him down personally. He's from Moongaze Lake, and we have a use for him right now. If he renders meritorious service, Xuwang will want him back! If he fell into your hands and was killed for nothing, who would Xuwang complain to?"

Fei Qing'yi felt a chill all over, frozen in place. He was in the Foundation Establishment Realm, after all, and had heard plenty about the affairs of the north and south. How could he not understand the meaning behind those words? He didn't know how to respond, but he suddenly felt his throat tighten as he was lifted into the air by a powerful force.

The Purple Mansion Daoist Master before him wore armor under a feathered cloak. He was handsome, but his eyes were cold. One hand gripped a long-handled saber-glaive, while the other held Fei Qing'yi up before him.

"Don't play dead. Li Ximing is still at Caishan; he can't get here right now. Even if he escaped with his life, he's just hiding in some corner. And even if he did come, he'd be on the verge of death from his wounds."

"I can't break that Purple Mansion array in a short time, but I can't just let this juicy piece of meat sit right in front of me!"

He saw the man before him give a bright smile and said softly:

"I know your Fei Clan is on the northern bank. You don't need to worry. If this fails, you'll die, of course. But the northern bank? I can take it with a snap of my fingers. Your Fei family will be allowed to leave this place and go to Monan. If you succeed, the Northern Buddhists will certainly give you a good position."

Fei Qing'yi, trapped in his grasp, felt his will to survive erupt. He suddenly became calm, stared directly into the man's eyes, and replied:

"I only hope that my lord keeps his word."

"Hahahaha!"

The silver-armored man laughed and set him down, planting his saber-glaive in the ground. He began to applaud.

"You don't need to worry about that. I am Helian Wumeng of the Tiefu Kingdom's royal family. I have no reason to go back on my word!"
