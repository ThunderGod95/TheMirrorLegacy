# Chapter 947: The Profound Light's Lineage

White steam rose from the golden furnace, the True Fire banked low. Three days passed, the flames extinguished, and the scent of a finished pill wafted forth.

With a soft click, Li Ximing closed the jade box in his hand. He stored the pill furnace, nodded to Daoist Master Shanbai who stood before him, and then entered his immortal cave. Carrying the box straight to the bedside, he spoke politely:

"Fellow Daoist Zhu Gong?"

The female Daoist Master, who appeared to be only sixteen or seventeen, was flushed and coughing incessantly. Her expression was hard to read as she accepted the jade box from him and replied:

"Many thanks, Zhaojing!"

She set the box by the bed, but surprisingly, she didn't comment on it further. Instead, she said:

"I see that Kong Xiaxiang is still kneeling outside the cave. He must be terrified, begging for some way to ensure his safety."

A cold light entered her eyes as she continued:

"I know what he fears. In the years I was away, a few scoundrels within the sect couldn't keep their hands clean. There's trouble brewing in the north, and they're afraid, too. They think that if Kong Xiaxiang dies, first, he can't report their misdeeds, and second, if a real crisis hits, it will force the Purple Mansion Realm experts to turn on each other. That way, they won't be handed over to appease someone's anger."

Li Ximing sighed inwardly. Zhu Gong, however, looked deeply vexed. She said quietly:

"This business with the Kong Clan... Back then, out of consideration for the aristocracy and compared to the Eastern Sea's usual methods, my actions were remarkably lenient. The Kong Clan members... I paired them with core disciples from the sect. As for Kong Guxi... I didn't harm him in the slightest. Instead, I had him dispatched overseas for his own protection..."

"But we've never had a situation where a core disciple was scattered, went into seclusion abroad, and then returned as a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. For that... I suppose I have the aristocracy to 'thank'."

Hearing her euphemistic, bitter tone, Li Ximing replied:

"What happened back then... Yehui seized the mountain, and you took it back. That was always intended as a preparation for a day like this..."

Zhu Gong just shook her head silently.

Honestly, she, Zhu Gong, would never normally fear a Daoist Master who had only just reached the Purple Mansion Realm by cultivating the Fool's Mountain Chase. If this had happened even two or three years ago, the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition would have mediated, and this whole affair would have been trivial.

But the current situation was completely different!

Her voice was a little hoarse as she said:

"Fellow Daoist, do you know the Kong Clan's origins?"

Li Ximing nodded. "The Kong Clan was once a great noble family in the Xu State. They suffered during the 'Northern Inspection' calamity, so the entire family moved south and established their gate in Shanji. Daoist Master Changxi claimed his lineage was the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains, which falls under the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition..."

As he spoke, understanding dawned, and his voice trailed off. Zhu Gong's expression was complicated. She whispered:

"A cultivator from the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains and the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition breaks through to the Purple Mansion Realm right in Jiangbei—in the Xu State's old territory, no less. And she has a perfectly justifiable, 'righteous' feud with my Sacred writ, and by extension, the entire Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, all in the name of 'restoring her lineage'!"

"Qi Lanyan has come down from the north, just itching for an excuse to make a move. If he can't seize this opportunity, he has no right to call himself an heir of the Viewing Pavilion faction."

Li Ximing's pupils widened slightly. He watched as the woman forced herself to sit up, her voice laced with exhaustion.

"It's been three days since the breakthrough... and there hasn't been a single word. We have no standing to go investigating. But Sword Gate certainly went. The fact that they are silent means they've found nothing."

"Sword Gate?"

Li Ximing was taken aback, but Zhu Gong had reached a level of helplessness that actually made her laugh.

"Sword Gate 'borrowed' the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain. Do you recall that, Zhaojing? The Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain is a powerful artifact of the Bound Earth Dao. Changxi must have used some method—perhaps borrowing Sumian's aid—to keep the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain from being moved!"

"What?"

Li Ximing froze, blurting out the word in shock. Zhu Gong secretly observed his reaction, confirming his ignorance before continuing through gritted teeth:

"The Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain is a treasure from beneath a great mountain of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition. Setting aside its other mysteries that aided her breakthrough, its most basic function is to stabilize the earth veins, allowing them to shift without collapsing into chaos. If our guess is correct, Kong Tingyun is in seclusion deep within the earth veins of Xuanmiao Temple!"

"He was secretly using the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain to stabilize the earth veins while simultaneously converting his life's cultivation into spiritual energy of their shared lineage, all to covertly fuel her breakthrough!"

Zhu Gong's expression grew increasingly complex.

"As you know, Fellow Daoist... the earth veins elsewhere might be shattered in a fight, but not in Jiangbei. No cultivators dare wage all-out war there... and even if they tried, powerful guardians would be watching."

"This way, Kong Tingyun would be perfectly safe! Since the earth veins would remain intact, the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain could shield her during the cataclysm of his death, and afterward, its lingering effects would be impossible to detect..."

Li Ximing was horrified.

"At the time, Sumian and I were both in the sky! There were countless Purple Mansion Realm experts hidden in the shadows. How could no one have noticed?"

"Koff... koff..."

Zhu Gong couldn't help but cough.

"Sumian cultivates the Treasured Earth divine ability—the Palace of Concealed Storage. The spiritual treasure Kong Tingyun ingested was the Roaming Pass Treasured Earth, which also stems from the Treasured Earth. It was designed to resonate with his divine ability... It was all prepared long in advance. Hidden impossibly deep underground... the two of them plotted together to keep her safe."

A sudden radiance filled Li Ximing's mind as the memories flooded back, clear as day.

'Sumian didn't make a move... because he was exerting his power elsewhere... He was at Gehu Peak!'

At this realization, Li Ximing's eyebrows shot up, his heart pounding.

'In that case, the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain never changed hands. It was only borrowed. Which means Sword Gate absolutely knew!'

'There's another party that knew about this... Sword Gate!'

Indeed, he wasn't the only one to realize this. Zhu Gong's gaze was fraught with complexity.

"Perhaps Changxi never even consulted Sword Gate. He just gambled on their arrogance, betting they'd be too proud to forcibly reclaim the Spiritual Artifact and cause her breakthrough to fail. And now, it seems he was right! Even as the situation deteriorates, even knowing her breakthrough gives the north the perfect excuse to interfere, Sword Gate remains completely indifferent..."

Li Ximing seemed not to hear her, his thoughts turning bleak.

'When they sent someone to my family to demand the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain... on one hand, it was Lingmei using the opportunity to carve off Profound Peak's lakeside territories, expanding his influence within the sect while making his own arrangements outside. But on the other hand... it was probably meant as a warning to me!'

A chill flashed in Zhu Gong's eyes, and her red lips parted.

"Fellow Daoist Zhaojing, take a guess... when Wei Xuanyin personally summoned Yehui back to the capital, was this part of his plan? This chess piece... he's been watching it for a long time. He just didn't expect it to be played so soon!"

"It's true our families have a private agreement. But Yehui knows the full story. If Wei Xuanyin 'explains' the past to Kong Tingyun, blurring the details and twisting the facts just so... how will this end? Will we even get a chance to defend ourselves?"

As her agitation grew, the warm air in the immortal cave stirred, causing the nearby lamplight to dim and flicker as if it might go out. The woman gritted her teeth.

"Once Kong Tingyun is backed by the Profound Governance Pavilion... what reason would she have to listen to our side of the story? Whether she believes his one-sided tale or not is irrelevant! Even if it's a lie... they will make it the truth!"

...

The Great Zhao, Imperial Capital.

The brilliant morning sun rose from the horizon, piercing the clouds to cast down golden rays. The light streamed past countless immortal terraces and pavilions, glittering in the distance.

In the growing light, the shadowed stairs reflected a dull bronze sheen. Eighteen hundred steps spanned the flowing clouds, exuding a solemn and cold majesty.

The sunlight crept upwards, inch by inch, climbing the platform to illuminate the vast terrace with its eight gates. At last, it struck the plaque above the great hall, revealing three stark white words.

Profound Governance Pavilion

The great hall was vast. In its center stood a large, bright silver cauldron. The clear water within was still as a mirror, emitting a faint, elegant glow that reflected the calm eyes of the long-haired man seated on the high dais.

He wore a silver robe that seemed fashioned from countless individual feathers. His eyes were long and narrow, giving him a soft, androgynous beauty. A silver incense burner sat on the desk before him, beside which rested a hairpin he had just removed.

This was none other than the current Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhao, the leader of the Viewing Pavilion faction—Wei Xuanyin.

He sat quietly at the desk, his expression markedly different from the day at Luoxia. It was more formal, more severe. On closer inspection, his features appeared more masculine, lacking the soft beauty he displayed when suppressing the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition.

To the side of the main dais, only ten paces away—shockingly close in the vast hall—sat a pale silver desk. It held no spiritual treasures or fine wine, only a simple bronze tray filled with a mixture of several types of sand, all emitting a faint glow.

Seated at this desk was a woman in teal robes. Her features were fair and her bearing exceptional, but the Bound Earth divine ability around her fluctuated unstably, a clear sign of a recent breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm.

Unfortunately, her elegant eyebrows were slightly knitted, revealing her confusion and unease. But as her host had not spoken, she could only wait patiently.

"Martial Uncle!"

A bright laugh rang out from outside the hall. A young man strode in, dressed in a Daoist robe of white with gold trim, emblazoned with black clouds and profound patterns, and cinched with a purple silk sash. His arrival made Wei Xuanyin raise an eyebrow. He said softly:

"Martial Nephew, you've retrieved it."

Qi Lanyan entered with a smile, turning slightly to reveal the people behind him.

Two junior cultivators in black caps followed, holding a jade tray upon which rested several thick, golden volumes. Qi Lanyan adopted a formal tone.

"I consulted with Junior Sister and have respectfully retrieved the Genealogical Records of the Mystic and Profound Immortals of Zhaoyao Mountain. It required ritual incense and purification, which caused the delay. Please forgive me!"

"Of course."

The teal-robed woman replied hastily. Wei Xuanyin glanced at her with a smile, showing no arrogance. He simply said:

"Please begin."

The woman spoke respectfully.

"The founder of the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains was named Luo Yuan. He was a disciple of Great Daoist Master Lü Bai of Tongxuan Palace. He came from the Shu region and spread his teachings in Luoxia."

"Zhou Zhaozi received the transmission and passed it to Li Bi. Three generations later, Li Bi's line entered Ning, where the Dao was passed to Zhao Yan. Zhao Yan passed it to Kong Xia. The lineage then transitioned from a sect to a clan for ten generations, until the ancestor Daoist Master Changxi, Kong Yanxi, achieved his divine ability."

This woman was none other than Kong Tingyun, who had vanished after the anomalous phenomenon in the north!

Qi Lanyan picked up the genealogical scroll, glanced at it, and said:

"Great Daoist Master Lü Bai did indeed perish while striving for the Auxiliary Position, and he had a disciple named Luo Yuan. While it's not the orthodox line of the Viewing Pavilion faction, it is a genuine lineage."

Kong Tingyun kept her head lowered, remaining silent.

When she emerged from her breakthrough, this Daoist Master Qi had appeared from the earth veins, claiming to be from the same Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition. He insisted she return to the north with him to formally acknowledge her ancestors.

Kong Tingyun could tell at a glance that this Daoist Master's cultivation was profound and his divine abilities were terrifying. A bucket of cold water was instantly dumped on the joy of her breakthrough. Her request to visit her sect was flatly denied—Profound Peak Gate, he told her, had already been carved up and divided.

The news almost made her cough up blood. But the Daoist Master's power was undeniable, leaving no room for argument. Kong Tingyun had no chance to even hesitate before she was half-coerced, half-escorted to this Profound Governance Pavilion.

And here, she was met by an even more terrifying Great Daoist Master!

Kong Tingyun was not unobservant. Setting aside the man's peak-level divine ability, even the various Spiritual Artifacts on his desk were treasures far beyond her reach. This only deepened her suspicion and alarm.

Her ancestor Changxi had spent the first half of his life rushing about, calling in favors and making inquiries, but not a single great family would acknowledge their Comprehending Profoundity origins. No one would admit the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains was an ancient Daoist tradition. Yet now, the moment she broke through, people from the Profound Governance Pavilion were at her door.

'I'm afraid they just want to use me!'

For now, she could only stand silently to the side, not daring to speak, listening as the Great Daoist Master spoke casually:

"A pity there are no portraits or detailed lineage charts. It all remains questionable... However, she is ultimately from the former Xu State and broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm in Jiangbei. She should be registered with the Profound Governance Pavilion on that basis alone, to say nothing of cultivating the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition."

Wei Xuanyin was being strict, setting the terms by this rule. Qi Lanyan nodded and said respectfully:

"According to this junior's understanding, this Daoist Master Changxi was affected by the True Monarch's northern inspection. His clan suffered a great calamity and fell into decline. He was the one who began its revival."

Wei Xuanyin showed a flicker of interest and nodded.

"So, a man of some destiny. What was his cultivation? The Bound Earth transmission is strict; I imagine his cultivation wasn't very high."

Qi Lanyan bowed quickly and replied:

"Martial Uncle is correct. He was in the early Purple Mansion Realm and cultivated the Fool's Mountain Chase. However, he was overeager in his pursuit of the Dao and used some unscrupulous methods in his youth. Unfortunately, this involved Maha and was discovered by the Nian Clan."

"They reported this to 'That One'. 'That One' was already displeased with Changxi's tendency to boastfully claim credit for his minor involvement in the True Monarch's affairs. This new transgression was intolerable. Fortunately, He did not intervene personally, but likely sent someone to issue a private warning. After that, Changxi became timid and never dared to overstep again."

At this, Wei Xuanyin raised his eyebrows slightly. But Kong Tingyun felt her world collapse, her mind going blank.

'What?'

'How... how is that possible?!'

Kong Tingyun knew her ancestor was no saint and had plenty of schemes, but she had always assumed they simply failed, forcing him to submit and resulting in his death as a mere early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. She never imagined this was the true story!

Connected to the Nian Clan of Yue Cultivating Sect... and referred to as 'That One' by these two powerful figures... who else could it be?! She was intelligent and guessed the identity at once, her heart freezing with dread.

'These two brought me thousands of miles... They wouldn't invent such a story just to deceive me. And... there were many suspicious things about the past... Could it be that Ancestor was waiting for Him to fail a breakthrough... Is that why he trained successor after successor, wasting his final years?'

Wei Xuanyin seemed to notice her reaction. He closed the book in his hand and asked with mild interest:

"What is it?"

Qi Lanyan was equally perceptive. He smiled.

"It was Junior Sister who noticed. Logically, 'That One' isn't an overbearing person, and Changxi was old enough to command some respect. But when Changxi met 'That One', he was so terrified he couldn't even lift his head, his respect bordering on obsequious. We investigated later and found he had dealings with Maha of the Way of Great Desire. After 'That One' slew the Maha, that Maha never dared venture south again. Changxi must have received a warning at that time, too."

Kong Tingyun's pupils widened. But Wei Xuanyin simply shook his head with a small laugh and said lightly:

"Enough... The past is the past. Take her down and explain the current situation. At the very least, we should first help her get her clan members back."

He smiled, and a gentle, androgynous beauty instantly animated his entire face.

"And after that... we must take back her sect's mountain gate, hmm?"
