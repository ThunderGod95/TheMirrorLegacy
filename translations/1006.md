# Chapter 1006: Stopping Lust

Sparrow Carp Fish was full of ambition, but the Maha Nuzi at his side began to worry.

"My lord, you must be careful..."

Maha Nuzi had always been a Merciful One under Sparrow Carp Fish's command. Back in the day, by relying on Sparrow Carp Fish and the power behind him, not only did Maha Nuzi receive excellent assistance, but ordinary people also didn't dare to offend him. His status was far higher than that of a typical Merciful One; he had enjoyed a life of luxury and did not want to lose it easily. Seeing the current situation, he spoke with deep concern.

"Achieving this matter is crucial, but this isn't something that can be openly discussed. It all depends on a spark of understanding; there are no clear agreements. If that great personage truly intends to kill, it will be difficult to handle."

"Even if you can escape... you will lose a century of your physical body."

On the surface, Sparrow Carp Fish's journey south seemed impressive, but Maha Nuzi knew in his heart that this was a major undertaking filled with both danger and opportunity. It might also be a conspiracy woven by several factions to cut off another arm of the Peacock Clan. For so many years, the great personages of the Peacock Clan had not responded, and the other Peacocks had repeatedly hit dead ends, causing them to become extremely wary.

Even if Yang Zhuo had only just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, his essence was Tianwu's Metallic Essence. The three suits of armor he used in the past had caused the north to suffer immense losses, and the memory of that still lingered, causing them to flinch. It was no wonder Maha Nuzi was worried, yet Sparrow Carp Fish simply shook his head and laughed.

From his sleeve, he took out a small porcelain bowl, only half the size of a palm. It rested quietly in his hand, its clear water rippling, stirring up waves.

"This is..."

Maha Nuzi's expression froze the moment he saw it. He blinked in disbelief.

The spiritual energy in the bowl was so resplendent it seemed to be solidifying, faintly shaking the Great Void itself. It was clearly Purple Mansion-grade spiritual water, and a full six portions of Purple Mansion-grade Valley Water!

"Heavenly One, Praise Cliff, Azure Ember, White Ewe, Returning Creek, and Matriarch."

These six portions of Valley Water complemented each other and seemed to be mixed with other substances of extremely rich spiritual energy, carrying a powerful lifeforce. The dense Valley Water was on the verge of spilling out of the small bowl, transforming into a rolling gray wind.

"This!"

Even though Maha Nuzi had some status in the north, his pockets were still empty. Forget about spiritual water or fire, his only Purple Mansion-grade spiritual item was tucked away at the bottom of his storage. He had never seen so much spiritual water and was momentarily entranced.

The monk smiled and said, "You are mistaken. This is not a question of whether or not to kill. The so-called 'stopping lust with righteousness' is not just a saying. Once they step out of the prefecture, they must die, to have their spirit and form extinguished and never be reborn."

Maha Nuzi was speechless, staring blankly at him. The monk narrowed his eyes slightly and laughed.

"It is precisely for this reason that this matter can only be done by my Way of Great Desire, and only by me. It is because the Peacock Clan has obtained the symbol of Black-Eyed Desire, and because my Way of Great Desire possesses the Great Virtue Golden Lotus..."

"You think I don't know? Not a single person in the north has good intentions. They all advised me to go to the south to gain the prestige of a Demon, but in reality, they all hoped I would go there to die. Even our own Great Desire Liangli — there was never a moment he didn't fear me!"

Maha Nuzi didn't know why he brought this up; he only felt his scalp prickle. He listened as the monk in front of him chuckled.

"But I have been waiting for this day. They think I am personally putting myself in danger, but that is not the case. The Great Virtue Golden Lotus planted by Quanwu has been blessed by a great personage. My main body is sitting in the Buddhist Land, on the Great Virtue Golden Lotus. I am only going down the mountain with the Small Peacock Karma and its karmic root, walking step by step until I reach outside the prefecture."

"This karmic root will become the guest for that stopping lust with righteousness! To become the Demon that is suppressed and eliminated, to achieve a great karma unseen in a thousand years!"

Maha Nuzi was struck with a jolt of alarm. He turned slightly and said, his face drained of color, "Karmic root? My lord, you want to cut off your Peacock karmic root?! This... this..."

Maha Nuzi looked down, his expression one of shock, as he watched Sparrow Carp Fish sit atop the mountain peak and slowly drink the spiritual water from the bowl. The Great Virtue Golden Lotus enveloped him, emitting waves of radiant light. He spoke quietly.

"Back then, my clan's Great Zhizhan returned to the Buddhists, enlightened by a great personage. From then on, our Merging Fire diverged, but he was, after all, the son of the Yuwu bird. The Yuwu bird was once the master of all fires, with boundless divine might, and still retained a piece of karma."

"He cultivated for many years but was still unable to advance further. He then asked the Great Buddhists, and only then did he learn that a Yuwu karmic root remained within him. If the karmic root was not removed, he would forever be trapped by Merging Fire and unable to advance further."

"That great personage in the sea removed his karmic root. Now, I am the first among the Peacocks, and I too shall remove it to achieve my Dao."

He lifted his head, his face rapidly aging. Dense wrinkles crawled across his face, solidifying him into a mere shell. From his chest and abdomen, a fire sprang forth, grand and continuous, like thousands of small serpents slithering through the air. In a moment, it enveloped the entire mountain range. It then condensed before him, landing and forming a monk.

This new monk was vibrant and full of energy, with a wicked smile. He stood quietly in the air, while the body of Sparrow Carp Fish behind him was torn open, revealing dry, pale organs. His skin and flesh crumbled, turning into a skeleton, silent and lifeless.

Maha Nuzi felt his scalp tingle, still reeling from the sheer ambition. His mind was blank.

'Using my karmic root to occupy the position of True Qi's guest...'

That True Qi stops lust with righteousness was a well-known fact. That great personage certainly needed a devil, but once this devil entered the game, he would stand as the opposite side of that great personage. Even as a devil, his destiny and status would be that of an immeasurable Celestial Demon!

Such profound karma was enough to drive any Buddhist cultivator mad!

The Way of Great Desire descended upon them, precisely to act as this devil, to escort Sparrow Carp Fish on his journey before that True Qi and solidify his claim as a Demon. But this was not without danger. Even with the Great Virtue Golden Lotus, which could contain a True Spirit, already planted before the Simin gates, there was no guarantee that the Underworld did not possess the 'Exiled Qi'!

The way of the 'Exiled Qi' brought ignorance and doom. If that great personage had a powerful artifact of the 'Exiled Qi,' a single glance could still kill him!

Even if he succeeded—having entered the guest position of the Tianwu Demon-slayer, becoming the very devil to be suppressed and eliminated, and then successfully escaping—it would be a great position and destiny... but also an extremely dangerous one. Who knew when that great personage might need one more step to succeed? Would this devil be pushed out to complete the unfinished task, filling the Dao of another?

'One must remember, the whole world is pushing this matter. Those great personages can't wait any longer. The Seven Prime Ministers may look glorious, but how much say do they have from such a height? If such a situation arises, no matter how high Sparrow Carp Fish's destiny is, he would still have to go!'

Sparrow Carp Fish was right. The Way of Great Desire could calmly travel south precisely because the Great Virtue Golden Lotus allowed for a confident attempt. But the other factions that gave way were watching with cold eyes... just waiting for the future to push him into a well!

Even the Great Desire Maha Liangli, who supported Sparrow Carp Fish, now seemed to be wary of his immense strength and the Peacock clan's backing, wishing he would die in the south.

Yet Sparrow Carp Fish's move was so brilliant and bold that ordinary people wouldn't even dare to imagine it. He dared to let the Metallic Essence of Tianwu remove his karmic root for him, adding status and destiny to his name!

In this way, he would collect all the status and destiny, while having little of the negative consequences from this great karma. 'The devil is my karmic root,' he was essentially saying, 'and it has been thoroughly purged. The more powerful you are at stopping lust with righteousness, does that not mean my true body is even more full of radiance?'

'He actually planned something like this!'

And now that things had progressed to this point, with the Great Virtue Golden Lotus already planted on the mountain and all the conditions met, the entire world was pushing for this event to happen... Maha Nuzi pondered carefully and was momentarily lost in a daze. He finally understood why Sparrow Carp Fish had sneered when he mentioned Vast Cicada.

'He's right. This is a great karma unseen in a thousand years. If this scheme succeeds... not only will it succeed, but what are Vast Cicada and Beigu? They can't even hold a candle to it. It will also pave an incredibly radiant path for him to remain in a high position...'

If Yuan Huzhong joining the Buddhists and cultivating to the rank of Maha allowed him to have a say at the Great Yang Mountain Dharma Assembly, then once Sparrow Carp Fish succeeded, it was highly possible that in a few hundred years, he would be a great figure, sitting on a high platform to teach the Dao!

'Would a matter of this magnitude not have a great personage pushing it from behind? If there were no great personage's signal, where would he have gotten six portions of Valley Water under Liangli's nose?'

In that instant, Maha Nuzi felt a chill in his heart, and his mind became crystal clear.

'Did that great personage truly not respond? The Peacock Sea's secret stash was plundered, and several Peacocks died one after another; how could this have happened without reason? It must have been a secret test by a great personage...'

'The fact that the great personage never responded was precisely to let the Peacocks be gradually plotted against, waiting for Sparrow Carp Fish to enter the game and make today's events possible!'

A profound coldness filled his heart, and he silently lowered his head.

'Such a long-standing plot, a great personage must have gotten wind of it beforehand... Who warned him? Who wants to create more division among the Seven Prime Ministers? Is it from above or below?'

But the wicked monk in front of him had already shaken out his sleeves. Without even looking at Maha Nuzi, he stepped forward. In just a few strides, he turned into a yellow dot at the foot of the mountain and gradually disappeared into the distance.

He walked across the earth as if taking ordinary steps, but he was covering great distances in a single bound. He moved south at an astonishing speed. Wherever he passed, music swelled, and the ground, whether muddy or barren, bloomed with lotus flowers. Wild beasts knelt in reverence, and pools of water glistened with light, like a Buddhist Land on earth.

...

Simin Prefecture.

Thick gray fire rose into the sky, and raucous music played, drifting lightly into the prefecture. The great hall, however, was extremely quiet, with only the faint twinkling of lanterns.

The main seat at the head of the hall was empty, but the sides were filled with young talents from various families. They sat according to their rank, either with their heads bowed, sipping tea, or in silent contemplation. The only sound was the occasional clinking of porcelain cups.

Most of them were not nervous, waiting patiently. Only Li Jiangliang's brow remained tightly furrowed as he stared at the map on his table. From time to time, a subordinate would come forward to hand him a message, allowing him to trace the black route of the Buddhist cultivators.

'Past Quanwu... one movement could affect tens of thousands, or even more...'

Li Jiangliang held up his teacup, appearing somewhat anxious. He raised his eyebrows and glanced around.

He had been tasked with formulating rituals and had not been in the hall for a long time. The people standing in this great hall had changed quite a bit, yet they were all, as was natural, descendants of the Immortal Clan or the Purple Mansion Realm.

As he was thinking, he heard a commotion. A middle-aged man in a coarse robe entered from outside the hall. His hair was half-white, and his face was stern. A gourd was tied to his waist. As soon as he stepped into the hall, several people went forward to congratulate him.

"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Lingu! Congratulations!"

"To have a divine ability... it truly shocks the four directions..."

Li Jiangliang knew who he was: Lingu Lie of the Lingu family. He had originally been an unvalued clan elder who wandered the world, but now he was the Family Head.

The Lingu family's talent pool was absolutely withering at the moment. In the past, they had many at the Foundation Establishment Realm. If there was even a shred of opportunity, they would immediately go into seclusion in Linhai Prefecture. Those talented individuals with ability had all fallen, and so Lingu Lie, a clan elder who only broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm at nearly a hundred years old, had to be called back to the clan to shoulder this great responsibility.

The moment Lingu Lanying succeeded, he instantly became a sought-after figure. A crowd of people came forward to flatter him, but Lingu Lie took a moment to look at Li Jiangliang, bowing to him from a distance.

Li Jiangliang smiled in acknowledgment. Lingu Lie immediately moved closer, laughing.

"Greetings, Lord Li!"

"Senior, you are too kind!"

Li Jiangliang had no choice but to set aside what he was doing and respond with a gentle voice. Lingu Lie said with emotion,

"I have some ties with your clan. The Daoist Master from my family back then also fought alongside your clan. He was a true peer of Daoist Master Zhaojing and felt a great kinship. He asked me to visit you!"

Li Jiangliang smiled and said, "With the Buddhist cultivators moving south, a great war is about to break out. The congratulatory gifts from each family may be delayed... Since we are both in the hall, I will offer my congratulations in advance!"

Just as the man was about to bring up old stories, he paused slightly. Li Jiangliang also dropped his smile, sensing something.

"Bang... bang bang..."

The water in the teacups on the table began to boil for no reason, making the lids hum. Layers of overlapping water and fire appeared everywhere, and a faint rustling sound of scales could be heard. Li Jiangliang reacted quickly, rising abruptly and rushing out of the great hall.

He saw white cranes circling in the sky, with layers of water and fire sparkling like stars. This summoned streaks of falling immortal light. Li Jiangliang simply turned around and looked at the other cultivators who were still bewildered inside the hall.

"Come down and greet the great personage."

The group hurried down from the hall. Led by Li Jiangliang, they all bowed in unison. Their feathered robes and splendid garments spread out across the ground, reflecting the light of the water and fire in the sky, shining brilliantly.

"Rumble!"

Azure, blue, and indigo water and fire intertwined with black, red, and yellow-brown colors in the air. Countless white cranes descended from the heavens, dissolving the endless karmic fire that poured down, illuminating the prefecture in a blaze of light.

Li Jiangliang lifted his head slightly, only to find a pair of black boots standing before him.

His heart skipped a beat. He slowly raised his head, his gaze sweeping over the man's beautifully patterned black robe, finally resting on his face.

It was an extremely ordinary, unremarkable face.

But it was this plain face that made one's mind go blank, unable to recall any of his features. The aura on his body showed no fluctuations whatsoever, as if he were a mortal.

Li Jiangliang could tell that this man's attire was similar to his wife Yang Tanyou's. He lowered his eyes slightly and found that the people around him were completely unsurprised by his appearance, as if they had not noticed him. Only then did he rise and say,

"Greetings, senior."

The man in front of him nodded slightly and smiled.

"You are the son of Bright Yang."

Li Jiangliang bowed and said,

"My father is Daoist Master Minghuang."

The man nodded in satisfaction and said softly,

"I would like to ask you to tell the Daoist Master in the lake... just say that Yang Ruiyi of the Yang clan of Simin asks the Daoist Master on the lake to come to Simin to discuss a great matter."

Li Jiangliang hesitated for a moment. The man from the Yang clan smiled, looked at him deeply, and added,

"Daoist Master Guanxuan, Yang Tianya, is also in Simin. He has been waiting for your clan for a long time and wants to catch up with the descendants of an old friend."
