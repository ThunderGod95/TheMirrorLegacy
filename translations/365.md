# Chapter 452: Respective Benefits

Li Yuanjiao carefully stowed away the two items before tossing the storage pouch back to the rogue cultivator, who was still bowing while kneeling before him. Observing the man, Li Yuanjiao discerned that despite his ragged appearance, the man practiced a proper Qi cultivation method. His hands were unusually soft and fair, showing that he was likely versed in the arts of immortal cultivation.

This aroused Li Yuanjiao's suspicion.

"Are you a rogue cultivator?" he asked.

Recognizing that Li Yuanjiao was no easy target to deceive, the rogue cultivator secretly thought to himself, This man is cautious and didn't kill me outright... Surely, he isn't a devil cultivator! Perhaps he belongs to one of the three sects or seven gates, or a prestigious immortal clan... These people are knowledgeable; deceit would surely backfire...

Adjusting his strategy, the rogue cultivator lifted his head, shedding any previous semblance of cowardice, and explained in a respectful manner, "I was once a cultivator from Wu State. My sect was destroyed by devil cultivators, forcing me to seek refuge in Yue State..."

Li Yuanjiao, impressed by his composed tone and demeanor, contemplated recruiting him, thinking to himself, If I treat him with kindness, perhaps I could acquire the secret techniques of Wu State and an ally for my family...

However, Li Yuanjiao was inherently distrustful. Sensing the man's true essence for a brief moment, he felt an unnerving familiarity. A chilling thought flashed through his mind suddenly, causing him to mutter in shock, "Slaughter Jun Gate?!"

Startled at being recognized so quickly, the rogue cultivator immediately pressed his forehead to the ground again. Realizing that he could no longer conceal his identity, he replied solemnly, "Yes... May I inquire who Senior is...?"

Li Yuanjiao recalled the old monkey and the Slaughter Jun Kui Light technique he had acquired years ago.

He mused to himself, Such a coincidence! How could we dare to involve ourselves with them right now? The Slaughter Jun Gate was devastated during the devil plague... Who knows they might be scheming?!

Besides, this man is no ordinary character; he might be a serpent dragon with a significant fate!

Deciding against taking advantage of the situation, Li Yuanjiao dropped the damaged dharma artifact from the devil cultivator onto the ground and emptied his storage pouch.

Several bottles of the devil cultivator's blood pills, over a dozen Spirit Stones, and a couple of low-quality dharma artifacts, along with the Fire Baleful Qi and Yang Nourishing Technique manual came tumbling out.

After a brief inspection of the manual, he hastily repacked them and said, "I have received favors from Slaughter Jun Gate... Consider these items as repayment. Take them and sell them after you leave!"

For the first time in their conversation, the rogue cultivator's composure wavered, now stricken with genuine shock. After a stunned silence, he hurriedly asked, "Senior, may I ask for your name?"

Already riding on the wind, Li Yuanjiao simply replied, "This is not the time to talk, leave quickly!"

The rogue cultivator's eyes reddened slightly, managing only to call out, "Tu Longjian will never forget the kindness you have shown him today! I shall repay you generously in the future!"

Eager to avoid trouble, Li Yuanjiao swiftly departed. Once he landed safely back in his cave dwelling, he breathed a sigh of relief, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders.

He mused quietly, "I don't really care about the repayment, I just hope he won't bring danger to our family... Given that demon cultivators have the backing of an immortal sect, there must be more to the Slaughter Jun Gate incident than meets the eye, just like the mystery surrounding the Xiao Family... My family has received the two legacies with fear. Only those who have lost their minds would involve themselves with those from Slaughter Jun Gate..."

Li Yuanjiao had briefly examined the Yang Nourishing Technique in Tu Longjian's possession. It appeared to be a method for converting one type of spirit fire into another, but it required numerous spirit items and extensive knowledge. However, the manual was thick with a lot of content. Cautious of potential traps, he dared not delve too deeply into it.

After thinking for a moment, he decided that it should be safe to examine the storage pouches, so he took out the three of them excitedly.

The storage pouches from the father and daughter were ordinary, but the final pouch from the daring demon cultivator seemed of superior quality. Li Yuanjiao looked at it for a bit and grew suspicious again as he mumbled, "I'll have someone open this back at home rather than risking it myself..."

He had handed over the dharma artifacts from the father and daughter to Tu Longjian, so there was little left in his possession‚Äîonly two jade bottles.

One was left by the fleeing demon cultivator. It was slender, about two fingers wide, and adorned with silver patterns. Although small, it looked exquisite. Li Yuanjiao channeled his true essence into it, watching as colorful brilliance danced across its surface before it released a white mist.

The mist continued to rise, gradually creating a faint veil of concealment around him. Under its cover, his body seemed to vanish, leaving the cave dwelling suddenly empty.

The mist, perhaps attuned to the Jing Dragon King immortal foundation, seemed to resonate intimately with him, swirling around him protectively. It was only then that realization dawned upon Li Yuanjiao.

This must be the dharma artifact that the demon cultivator used to conceal himself! I wonder where he got it from... The patterns on the bottle are definitely unusual. They're nothing like what I've seen before.

He inverted the bottle and immediately heard the sound of rain before a stream of crystal-clear spring water poured out like flowing silk, weaving through the air like a snake.

Li Yuanjiao peered closer, intrigued.

Engraved at the bottom of the bottle were the words‚ÄîLi Qianyuan from the Li Family of the Wei State.

"Wei State... So the Li Family still existed in the ancient Wei State..."

No wonder I couldn't detect that demon cultivator; this artifact is a Foundational Establishment Realm dharma artifact... He was decisive, cautious and even had such a prized item in his possession.

The Profound Patterned Bottle not only concealed one's figure but also served as a protective dharma artifact when inverted. The mist within could ward off spells and enhance wind control, making it a truly versatile artifact.

"Excellent! I'll name it the Profound Patterned Bottle."

Acquiring this artifact made Li Yuanjiao's journey worthwhile. The Azure Proclaimation, a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, was a generous gift from Yuan Tuan when she visited the Li Family. Although such artifacts were easily obtainable for peak masters of the three sects and seven gates, they were treasures to clan cultivators.

Another jade bottle contained a spirit fire known as the Profound Yang Radiant Fire. Li Yuanjiao was unfamiliar with this bright golden-red flame, but he could feel its intense heat painfully searing his spiritual senses.

Gazing toward the sky, he left the cave dwelling on a gust of wind, activating the Profound Patterned Bottle, and flew amidst the mist toward the Profound Peak Gate.

Meanwhile in the Li Family...

Although Li Yuanjiao had been away for some time, news of his breakthrough had spread across the six mountains. The cultivators at home rejoiced, and a few guest cultivators breathed sighs of relief and could finally rest easy.

Li Tongya had been absent for over a decade, raising suspicions among the guest and external cultivators. However, given his formidable reputation, none dared to inquire further.

After all, he was Li Qiuyang and Chen Donghe's mentor, and could subdue even An Zheyan. His penetrating gaze, having once swept over everyone, still lingered vividly in their memories even after more than ten years.

Li Yuanjiao's breakthrough further solidified everyone's confidence. Several families sent congratulatory gifts, masking any jealousy with outward expressions of congratulations.

In the old central hall, Li Yuanping calculated the family's finances meticulously, occasionally writing something on his desk. Li Qinghong stood at his side with her spear. Having consumed a talisman pill, she now radiated the aura of a Qi Cultivator at the ninth heavenly layer.

Li Yuanping reviewed the ledger, carefully explaining the details to Li Qinghong, who was listening attentively.

"With this new system, our family's surplus this year has decreased by seventeen or eighteen Spirit Stones," he reported.
ùöèùï£ùêûùó≤ùê∞ùïñùêõùêßùï†ùïßùöéùöï.ùêúùöòùó∫

The Li Family's most productive territory was Mount Yue's Wutu Mansion. With seventy Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators working tirelessly, it generated twenty Spirit Stones annually. After accounting for seven to eight hundred jin of Spirit Paddies as salaries, a surplus of fourteen Spirit Stones remained.

Next was Huazhong Mansion, which earned sixteen Spirit Stones and after paying out six to seven hundred jin of Spirit Paddies as salaries, and a surplus of about ten remained.

The remaining Lijing, Huaqian, and Yuting were less fertile, each yielding only seven or eight Spirit Stones. With fewer workers, these mountains managed a surplus of two to three Spirit Stones each, totaling eight altogether.

"The annual profit was a mere thirty-two Spirit Stones, totaling only one hundred and sixty over five years," Li Yuanping continued thoughtfully.

Fortunately, with the Peak Guardians appointed, they could be sent to the remote areas of Mount Dali to gather qi. With monthly rotations, this yields an additional seven Spirit Stones annually.

"With the inclusion of the gathered qi, the total comes to one hundred and ninety-five Spirit Stones, just about ten to twenty away from the required tribute amount," he added with a satisfied nod.

The gap of only three or four Spirit Stones annually was manageable. Since most talismans crafted by his father, Li Xuanxuan, were distributed as rewards, covering the deficit was relatively straightforward.

"Conversely, with the new system implemented, our control over our own territory has more than doubled. The number of personnel at our disposal has increased tenfold, significantly enhancing our influence over the neighboring families and those on the eastern shore..." he continued.

These developments‚Äîdistributing benefits, stabilizing the cultivator groups under their command, and securing the populace's loyalty‚Äîwere all within Li Yuanping's expectations. Just as he was pondering how to further capitalize on these changes, someone approached him.

"Seventh Uncle, Ximing is getting ready to break through to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm," Li Xijun reported, bowing slightly.

Li Yuanping nodded silently, offering a smile but then gently asked, "Have you considered taking a wife, Jun'er?"

At the age of twenty-one, Li Xijun's early advancements in Qi Cultivation Realm made him appear youthful. However, he was still at the first heavenly layer, highlighting the growing gap in talent with his brother, Li Ximing, who was advancing even faster.

Li Xijun occasionally brought joyous news to Li Yuanping, hoping to bridge the gap between the father and son. However, Li Yuanping seemed uninterested and instead posed a personal question to him.

"I've met the daughter from An Family...but I don't think it'll work out," Li Xijun replied truthfully.

Li Yuanping sighed, but did not ask if it was the girl or just that his nephew was not interested in the relationship. He simply murmured, "You'll have to decide for yourself... I hope you'll at least leave an heir.

Li Xijun shook his head gently.

"Big Brother has many heirs, and the second lineage already has successors. Xijun will leave it all to fate. Retaining Yang Essence and practicing certain secret techniques could also prove advantageous."[1]

After chatting briefly, Li Yuanping watched his nephew depart on the wind back to Mount Qingdu to focus on either his cultivation or swordsmanship.

He could not help but remark, "This child excels in many areas... He's sharp, diligent, and always dedicated to his swordsmanship day and night. However, he's emotionally reserved and harbors an inherent pride that makes it difficult for others to relate to him..."

Li Qinghong, standing nearby, pursed her lips.

"It's partly my fault. When Jun'er was young, his father, Brother Yun, faced hardships. As a result, he was exposed to many two-faced people. This inevitably shaped his reserved and cautious nature..."

"With his remarkable appearance, innate talent, and early experiences that taught him to see through people, it comes as no surprise that he's prideful. Considering everything, I think he's fine... he could have turned out to be way worse."

As Li Qinghong concluded, Li Yuanping stared into her almond-shaped eyes and suddenly chuckled.

"Jun'er truly takes after you. You're really his aunt," he remarked.

Li Qinghong was taken aback, but as she saw Li Yuanping's pale face breaking into a strained smile, he hoarsely added, "Someone in the family has also chosen to remain unmarried for life, even sacrificing her lifespan to pursue the dao. She has a remarkable appearance, innate talent, wits, and pride too... Yes, I'm talking about you, Li Qinghong!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Meanwhile, at Mount Dongli...

The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven was approximately the size of a prefecture. This once-majestic realm, filled with immortal mountains and sprawling structures and pavilions, now lay in ruins. Vibrant spirit fires were spreading in every direction amidst billowing black smoke.

Yuan Tuan, accompanied by Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er, landed on a modest hill. The peak assigned to Yuan Tuan was notably smaller and less impressive due to Qingsui Peak's declining power. It appeared that little of value could be found in this unassuming location.

Li Xizhi stepped into a small courtyard on the mountain. Yuan Tuan remained mounted on a deer as she instructed gently, "Go and search. Bring back Qi Cultivation and Foundation Establishment Realm items to the peak. Items of the Purple Mansion Realm should be submitted to the main peak. Ensure pill recipes, cultivation and secret manuals are archived within the sect. Do not disseminate them widely, and avoid trying anything funny. Remember, the grand formations are watching us."

Yuan Tuan, lacking strong backing within the clan, knew better than to aim for the central peaks, where the most valuable treasures were likely kept. Instead, she chose not to vie for access, avoiding unnecessary conflicts.

The courtyard was littered with broken bookshelves and various spirit items scattered on the ground, shimmering with spiritual energy. Yuan Tuan scanned the place with her spiritual sense, then reached out to pick up a shimmery fragment from the ground.

With a tone of regret, she remarked, "A fine Crying Blood Stone... What a pity... Chu Yi's greed has devastated the grotto heaven, destroying at least thirty percent of the spirit treasures within..."

Inside the courtyard, Li Xizhi sifted through the debris of collapsed medicine cabinets and found several stacks of prescriptions. Upon closer inspection, one was prominently labeled‚ÄîThree Aspects Breaking Realm Pill, written by Cui Niexiang.

Dongli Sect preferred to use durable spirit cloth for their records to minimize damage. Li Xizhi swiftly scanned the information with his spiritual sense. Continuing his search, he found yet another prescription‚ÄîTwo Ways of Refining Renewal Spirit Pill, written by Cui Er.

It contained two methods of refining this spirit pill, one for the Qi Cultivation and the other for the Foundation Establishment Realm. This delighted Li Xizhi as he thought to himself, Ming'er is a skillful alchemist. This recipe will surely benefit our family!

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao'er approached, holding a stack of documents, looking as though realization had just dawned upon her.

"Brother! The Cui family of the Dongli Sect indeed originated from the north, and their heritage is deeply tied to the ancient Wei Kingdom. It's no wonder they use Yang and Radiant Fire as their emblems..."

Li Xizhi immediately recalled the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual back home, authored by Cui Mu of the ancient Wei State. A surge of hope filled his heart as he wondered, Could this grotto heaven hold the key to my family's destiny? If I can find the Purple Mansion Realm part of the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual here, it could revitalize Brother Ming's Dao!

His heart raced with the possibility, but anxiety soon crept in. The three sects and seven gates had long divided this grotto heaven among themselves. How could he possibly find an opportunity there? He'd probably be killed by disciples of the same sect as soon as he left this peak...

Despite his concerns, he mused aloud, "I wonder if there are any Grade Five or Grade Six cultivation techniques hidden in this grotto heaven... Securing one would certainly be a remarkable feat."

Yuan Tuan, overhearing him, shook her head slightly and murmured softly, "Don't get your hopes up. Aside from Chu Yi, the Radiant Fire Spear, no one else can unlock the Dongli Dao Collection."

After their brief exchange, they swiftly plundered the main courtyard atop the mountain before descending to continue their scavenging, as instructed by Master Yuan Tuan.

As Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er made their way down, Yuan Tuan's brow furrowed in contemplation.

Yang Tianya claimed that Li Mutian truly existed... Could it be that there was really a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator named Li Mutian in Yang Tianya's forces? How did he meet an untimely end though? The clan seems oblivious to this, and their records mention only three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in their family...

What was Daoist Master Yuan Su thinking when he chose Ning Hemian as Li Xuanfeng's wife... Whose pawn is the Li Family..?

The deeper Yuan Tuan delved into these thoughts, the more bewildering the situation seemed. Meanwhile, down the mountain, Yang Xiao'er called out to Li Xizhi warmly and excitedly, drawing Yuan Tuan's gaze downward.

Watching Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er, she reminisced about her senior brother who had long left the sect and was never to return, leaving her behind. Her eyes reddened slightly at Yang Xiao'er's affection for Li Xizhi.

Regardless of the turmoil outside, my immediate priority is to protect the young ones at our peak.

1. Big brother here refers to Li Xicheng, and Yang Essence here refers to virginity. ‚òú
