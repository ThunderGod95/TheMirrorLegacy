# Chapter 1111: His Highness

And from his perspective, with the Azure Insight Origin Mirror present, the Heavenly Element divine mystery shouldn't have been in Ting Province. It _couldn't_ be in Ting Province. The fact that Suining obtained it must also be a move by the heavens.

The look in Li Zhouwei's eyes gradually cleared.

'In essence, this is a deep scheme hidden beneath a shallow one. Suining is indeed of the Heavenly Element, but the divine mystery he obtained is likely not limited to that. The future he is guiding is very likely the future that the great personage in the heavens desires.'

If that was the case, Li Suining's vagueness about the Heavenly Element divine mystery finally made sense. This invisible, perfectly concealed chess piece had undoubtedly been placed to target his Li family.

'That's exactly why... Suining cannot have a Talisman Seed. He's bound to be exposed to that personage's sight eventually. If he accepts a Talisman Seed, the karmic link will be instantly severed, leaving no trace. Then the Li family's anomaly will have no explanation, which will only make others vigilant...'

Li Zhouwei understood. The Li family was being watched by millions, and those members who bore Talisman Seeds and gained only a moment's respite by entering the lake... they all seemed free, but in reality, they were trapped in a cage.

Li Zhouwei mused for a moment, his gaze resting on Li Suining, an idea forming in his mind.

He asked, "The next great war between North and South. How much time is left? Can you calculate it precisely?"

Hearing this, Li Suining replied, "Although there have been minor frictions over the years, if I am not mistaken, the true great war is still eight years away!"

Eight years from now would be the Baihai Campaign. It was the final joint northern expedition where the Great Song and Western Shu would cooperate for their own respective gains. It was also the war where the Way of Great Desire would once again pour its forces into the Huai region... Now that Vast Cicada was dead and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm was silent, the timelines matched perfectly. From Li Suining's perspective, the timing should be accurate.

When Li Zhouwei heard this, however, his heart brightened.

'Eight years... That is more than enough time.'

He had emerged from this last war with no major injuries. And the years Li Ximing had struggled to hold on, he had passed through safely by relying on his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body. This meant these eight years... for the Li family, this was an extremely precious period that could be dedicated purely to development and preparation!

He mused for a moment, then suddenly raised his head as if sensing something. He gazed at the horizon, watching the black Profound Banners fluttering in the distance. He knew the people from the Song court had arrived. He stood and said,

"The Old Master mentioned he wishes to see you. Once you are ready, go out and meet the Old Ancestor."

Li Suining quickly agreed and bowed as Li Zhouwei departed. He waited until the colors faded from the sky before standing up, hesitating in his cave residence.

'Should I tell him... or not...'

At this point, in this situation, Li Suining naturally understood the issue.

'He thinks I possess some peculiar divination ability...'

Li Suining had the urge to confess the truth, but every time he faced Li Zhouwei, he couldn't bring himself to speak.

'Is it really a good idea to confess to King Wei?'

He could hardly imagine what would happen if Li Zhouwei learned the complete story of the Li family's rise and fall. Worse, how could he tell a fervent Dao-seeker that his attainment of verifying the Dao was like the Second Manifestation of the worldâ€”destined to fall soon after?

Even if Li Suining knew little about the Quest for Gold, he knew that for a process so steeped in symbolism and the verification of one's path, this was absolutely not a good omen.

'What can be said, and what cannot... it's probably impossible to distinguish anymore.'

He knelt anxiously in his cave residence, pulling a jade slip from his sleeve. He tried to read, but his mind refused to quiet. Pacing a few steps, he finally leaned back against the main seat and closed his eyes in deep thought.

An unknown amount of time passed. His breathing gradually evened out. A flicker of silver light leaped from between his brows, connecting to a brilliant, distant star, pulsing with dazzling radiance.

---

The imperial palace was magnificent and imposing, its deep halls hushed and serene.

"This is the Great Song," Lin Chensheng said, his heart a knot of complex emotions. He was dressed in white robes.

Even though he had learned much at the monastery, walking through the Great Song's palace court still filled him with a disorienting wind of confusion. He felt as if he were trapped in a dream.

He walked silently along the palace corridor. After a while, he saw a woman waiting on the path. Her head was bowed, her hands clasped, her posture exceedingly humble. Lin Chensheng only recognized her when he was standing right in front of her.

"Ziyu!" he said, his voice dry.

Kan Ziyu and Lin Chensheng were old acquaintances. They had grown up together and shared deep feelings, even venturing into a Grotto-Heaven together for training... But looking at her now, this person bore no resemblance to the high-spirited yet gentle Kan Ziyu he remembered.

Only then did Daoist Master Wenqing look up at him, her gaze flickering for an instant.

"So, Daoist Master Chensheng has arrived," she replied. "Please, follow me."

Lin Chensheng immediately masked his expression, a sour feeling rising in his heart.

'The chosen prodigy of my Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... reduced to a minor role, merely guiding others.'

He lowered his head and said nothing more, following her to the deepest part of the palace complex. He bowed low, listening to the surrounding officials whispering among themselves. He vaguely caught a few words... King Wei...

"A great victory, I presume?" Lin Chensheng asked in a low voice.

Daoist Master Wenqing nodded. She seemed devoid of emotion, yet she spoke readily.

"Indeed. A great victory for King Wei. This King Wei is surnamed Li, his given name is Zhouwei. He is a kinsman of Li Xuanfeng. Li Xuanfeng... Brother Chensheng, do you remember him?"

The image of the man holding a golden bow in the Grotto-Heaven instantly surfaced in Lin Chensheng's mind. He nodded. He had only seen him once, but he'd vaguely felt that fierce man possessed something his own Dao Lineage lacked. The impression had stuck with him.

Daoist Master Wenqing added, "King Wei... he should have been born during the era when you and I were prominent. He now possesses three divine abilities."

Lin Chensheng fell silent for a moment before replying, "Chi Wei committed countless evils. If not for that... he should have been a disciple of my Supreme Yang."

"It just means the destiny of the Supreme Yang is exhausted," Wenqing said flatly.

Daoist Master Wenqing had emerged from seclusion several years before him. She had personally witnessed the final hope of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition collapse and had seen the many ups and downs since. She spoke of it with absolute calm.

As they spoke, they arrived at a hall deep within the palace. Grand General Yang Ruiyi was standing there. Beside him, a woman in beautiful green robes waited, her body turned slightly to the side.

Lin Chensheng bowed respectfully. Yang Ruiyi, however, smiled warmly and hurried over to help him up.

"Chensheng is out of seclusion!" he boomed. "I have gained another great general! This gives me much more confidence!"

The title "great general" might have been a courtesy, but the confidence was genuine. No matter how far the Great Xiukui Monastery had fallen, it was no ordinary Dao Lineage. A single Lin Chensheng offered far more than any ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!

The affair between Sword Immortal Lou Xing and the Lingu family had caused a massive uproar at the time. In reality, aside from some spiritual items and resources, Lingu Lanying had ended up with only two Spiritual Artifacts, one of which even clashed with her own Dao Lineage. Lou Xing hadn't touched the true foundation on Tiger's Frontier mountain in the slightest!

'Losing the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword is fine. We still have the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, and the former "Whole Pill" wondrous treasure, the Un-harming Stone that was sealed away... And even that aside, the Celestial Xiukui is still on Tiger's Frontier!'

In Yang Ruiyi's opinion, Lou Xing was one of the sharpest minds in the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. His actions back then had minimized the Great Xiukui Monastery's losses while keeping the North completely unbothered.

He was calculating inwardly, but his expression turned sorrowful. He sighed,

"Fellow Daoist Houfu... truly a model for our generation!"

Houfu's death had been silent and should have gone unnoticed, but matters of life and death could never be hidden from the Underworld.

Lin Chensheng lowered his gaze.

"My uncle died at the hands of Northern cultivators. I, Chensheng, will surely avenge him!"

Whatever his true feelings, Yang Ruiyi was pleased by these words. He helped Lin Chensheng up and led Lingu Lanying over.

"This is Yingjia," he introduced. "Lingu Lanying."

Lin Chensheng nodded slightly in acknowledgment. Lingu Lanying immediately took a step back and said respectfully, "Greetings, Benefactor!"

"Daoist Master, you are too polite."

Even though Lingu Lanying held a royal title from the Great Song, she dared not put on airs before Lin Chensheng. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition may have ended, but it was still a Golden Core inheritance. There was no need to even compare their respective standing in the Yang family's eyes. Besides... in the entire Song state, who didn't know the roots of her Lingu family?
Unless some pretext arose in the future, she would always be a step below him.

Yang Ruiyi maintained an air of nonchalance. He simply smiled at Lin Chensheng and said,

"You've emerged from seclusion just when I need you... I must trouble you all to take a trip to the North."

Lin Chensheng nodded. Yang Ruiyi pulled him aside, whispered a few sentences, and pressed a pitch-black token into his hand. Then, he silently saw the three of them out.

The Grand General seemed to have just recalled something.

"In Qize," he asked, seemingly offhand, "there is a Dingyang Zi. He is... close with your Dao Lineage, I believe?"

Lin Chensheng quickly replied,

"A friendship from a past generation, and so much time has passed... This subordinate will have to return and inquire... It would be best to meet him first before saying more."

Yang Ruiyi smiled and nodded, watching the three depart. Only then did his smile vanish. He turned and walked back inside, heading deeper into the palace.

This place was devoid of any human warmth, filled only with a piercing chill. Faint shadows stretched across the floor. Yang Ruiyi knelt humbly and reported in a low voice, "Your Imperial Majesty, someone from Xiukui has arrived."

The Emperor of the Great Song stood in the hall, holding a three-inch copper hairpin, quietly toying with the bird in the cage before him. After a long moment, he spoke.

"Houfu had integrity."

It seemed the allegiance of the Great Xiukui Monastery brought him little joy. Instead, the death of Daoist Master Houfu seemed to stir something in him, reminding him of another.

"Is Lingmei attempting the Purple Mystery?"

Yang Ruiyi's expression tensed.

"Yes... It has been some time. The events of that year spurred him on. In truth... if the Cheng family hadn't suppressed him and denied him that Life Divine Ability... with his talent, he should have surpassed the Purple Mystery long ago."

The Song Emperor remained noncommittal.

"What is he cultivating now?"

Yang Ruiyi replied, "He originally cultivated Dui Metal. Lacking the Dui Metal Life Divine Ability, 'Position Follows Trust', he naturally sought to compensate with Geng Metal. He is using 'Present Departs Old'. Dui Metal is prone to shifts, so this is not considered an inferior choice."

Yang Zhuo took a step, his mind already elsewhere. He said indifferently,

"The Cheng family has no use for him, so let him cultivate. The current trend of the world aligns perfectly with that Life Divine Ability of his. He has a high chance of success. Once he passes the Purple Mystery, the old capital will see some changes."

The Cheng family's territory was once the capital of Yue State, which is why the emperor referred to it as the 'old capital'. The Yang Ruiyi on the other side nodded.

"His destiny also resonates with his divine ability. This subordinate will absolutely seize this opportunity..."

Before he could finish, the Song Emperor cut him off with a grim look and a wave of his hand.

"Lingmei is the successor of the Sword Gate. The Great Song will not disturb him. But the Cheng family? Are _they_ worthy of the name Sword Gate? We give Lingmei face for now. Once this is settled, Wanyu must also submit to Song's command."

Yang Ruiyi nodded quickly.

"That Daoist Master from the Cheng family always took both prestige and profit for himself. He emerges when it's time to claim benefits and retreats into seclusion when it's time to bear responsibility... With Cheng Gao dead, there's no one left to step up..."

Yang Zhuo shot him a glance, and Yang Ruiyi immediately fell silent, standing beside him without another word.

"Ding..."

With a flick from Yang Zhuo, the clear ring of metal on metal echoed through the hall. The sparrow in the cage, just waking up, stared drowsily at the copper hairpin in his hand.

Suddenly, the sound of rapid footsteps approached. Several people rushed into the hall, but it was a young boy who trotted in. He bowed before the emperor, his voice childish.

"Father Emperor!"

At that sound, a trace of warmth finally entered Yang Zhuo's cold, inhuman eyes. He looked down at the boy and smiled.

"Jiao'er."

This was his third son, Yang Jiao.

For a moment, the icy imperial palace grew warmer, infused with a bit of human life. Even Yang Ruiyi smiled, watching the boy with sincere relief.

Yang Zhuo's harem was small. Of his children, Yang Jiao was the only one truly considered an imperial descendant born after his ascension. The child was young, but incredibly bright.

But Yang Ruiyi knew even more.

This prince was studying the ancient Daoist Tradition, the [Taiyi Profound Truth Art]. He had entered the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature, not the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao!

Not only that, but Yang Jiao's talent was so astounding it had even alarmed the Underworld.

'If he achieves the Dao through True Qi... this prince not only has a limitless future, he might even be able to contend for an Auxiliary Position!'

The significance of this was staggering. Even the Underworld would never object to one more True Monarch.

For Yang Ruiyi, seeing this Third Highness wasn't just seeing a promising descendant of the Yang clan; he was possibly looking at a future sovereign.

"Greetings, Grand General!"

The prince bowed to them both before gleefully pulling a small stone sparrow from his sleeve. He held it up in his palm.

"Father, look!"

The little sparrow was carved with breathtaking realismâ€”two tail feathers, pitch-black claws, red eyes, and a green beak. It was a perfect likeness of the Tanzhen sparrow in the cage beside Yang Zhuo.

"Impressive," the Song Emperor said, glancing at it with interest.

The little prince, however, looked a bit crestfallen.

"But it doesn't move like yours, Father."

Yang Zhuo chuckled softly. With a light flick of the copper hairpin, he opened the cage door, casually took the Spirit Sparrow out, and offered it to his son.

The Spirit Sparrow's eyes were bright and alert. It didn't fly away but simply stared quietly at the young prince.

Yang Jiao's eyes filled with delight, but he didn't take it, clasping his hands instead.

"But Father Emperor, you love this Tanzhen..."

Yang Zhuo smiled and shook his head. He picked up the stone sparrow and blew a gentle breath across it.

Instantly, the sound of fluttering wings filled the air. A white shadow flickered, and the stone sparrowâ€”carved from common jadeâ€”sprang to life. It hopped and jumped, utterly alive, before settling quietly on the emperor's finger.

The Song Emperor placed the new bird into the cage and then patted his son's shoulder.

"Go and play."

Yang Jiao's eyes shone with adoration. He offered his thanks and skipped happily out of the hall.

A retinue of attendants flocked around the prince, sweeping him away like the wind. Yang Ruiyi's pupils contracted slightly.

The Tanzhen was a congratulatory gift from the Underworld, incredibly rare and precious. Never mind its small size; if it truly manifested its power, an ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would struggle to capture it. Moreover, it was a creature of the True Qi path, innately skilled at piercing all illusion!

Yet the man before him had merely _breathed_ on a stone, and it had transformed. The suppressed divine ability and the roiling of the Great Void all testified to the authenticity of the bird now in the cage.

'The Emperor's power... what terrifying level has it reached? He is the reincarnation of the Tianwu Metallic Essence, forged from the full might of the Underworld... Truly an existence far beyond any mere 'child of destiny'...'

He remained silent for a long time. Finally, he heard someone approach the hall and report,

"Your Majesty... King Wei has arrived at Zhengxing Palace!"
