# Chapter 241: Achievements Through Generations

"Dividing off the eastern mountainous region, offering treasures from the southern border to the old flood dragon, and keeping the Purple Smoke Gate in the north allied and relatively quiet, while being cut off by Xiao Chuting to the west..." Chi Zhiyun muttered as he sat silently on the radiant throne, holding his forehead in distress.

He felt deeply uneasy, only now realizing what Chi Wei had meant. At this point, the Azure Pond Sect was like a volcano on the verge of erupting.

No sooner had Chi Wei died than the Xiao Family declared themselves an immortal clan. Several other immortal sects had continually tested the waters, and families across various prefectures had grown restless. If not for the four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators holding the fort, things would have already gone awry.

Now, the only option is to appease and keep the Xiao Family neutral, while firmly suppressing the families. As long as there are four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators within the sect, nothing too drastic will happen...

Chi Zhiyun thought of how the Xiao Family had produced four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators overnight and ground his teeth in fury. He struck the armrest heavily and cursed out loud.

"What an annoying clan!"

While he remained deep in thought, a person approached and reported respectfully, "Sect Master, Linghai Prefecture has been in turmoil... A group of devil cultivators incited rogue cultivators to attack the market established by our Azure Pond Sect. Fortunately, several peak masters arrived in time to disperse the crowd and capture a few impoverished rogues."

Chi Zhiyun raised his head in disbelief, asking in a stern voice, "How could this happen? How dare these rogue cultivators assault our immortal sect's market?!"

The man hesitated for a moment before replying, "According to the peak masters, it seems these people have been bewitched by devil techniques and acted in madness. This is no trivial matter!"

"Devil techniques..?"

Chi Zhiyun froze for a moment. In ancient times, people would always say devils should be killed on sight. Nowadays, few distinguished between immortals and devils. If anything, it was most likely a curse spell.

"Don't worry about them for now," he said with a dismissive wave of his hand.

The man cupped his fist in acknowledgment before continuing, "Si Yuanbai has left the tower, gathered his belongings from the Azure Pond Peak, and left without speaking to the Daoist Master. He headed out on his own."

Chi Zhiyun chuckled and nodded.

"Let him do whatever he wants."

Li Tongya bid farewell to the fox and continued heading east with the wind, landing at the market on Cloud Crowned Peak. Now that Xiao Chuting had attained the Purple Mansion Realm, the market felt different, frequently hosting cultivators who arrived specifically to discuss the Xiao Family.

Li Tongya found a spirit medicine store. Inside, a Qi Cultivation Realm apprentice was counting medicinal ingredients behind the counter. Spotting Li Tongya, he immediately stood up and walked over with a welcoming smile.

"Old Master, are you here to purchase some herbs?"

"Yes, good medicine," Li Tongya replied with a nod.

The apprentice was momentarily stunned before dropping to his knees.

"Might you be a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator..?" he asked nervously, head bowed.

"Yes," Li Tongya answered softly.

With that confirmation, the apprentice fell prostrate, bowing repeatedly and struggling to speak.

"I... I apologize for my lack of manners! Please follow me upstairs, Senior..." he stammered.

Li Tongya was at a loss for words, surprised by the reverence given to Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. He wanted to speak but remained silent when he noticed the apprentice trembling, simply ascending the stairs without another word.

The second floor was furnished much more lavishly, with several Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators busy browsing the counters for ingredients.

As Li Tongya walked through the door, all eyes turned toward him instantly. The moment their spiritual senses came in contact with his aura, they quickly withdrew it in shock and greeted him respectfully.

"Greetings, Senior!"

"Greetings, Ancestor!"

Seeing how cautious the Qi Cultivators were, and sensing the sudden hush in the shop, Li Tongya waved his hand somewhat awkwardly.

"Continue as you were... I'm only here to find some ingredients."

"Understood!"

The cultivators awkwardly resumed their browsing but exchanged uncertain glances with each other, eventually leaving one by one until the entire shop was empty—except for Li Tongya.

The shopkeeper, though business was disrupted, plastered on an ingratiating smile and said respectfully, "What would you like, Senior?"

"Do you have any spirit medicine?" Li Tongya asked.

The shopkeeper frowned slightly at this, and he stammered, "Selling spirit medicine is forbidden under the orders of the Azure Pond Sect... Only the immortal sect itself can handle such transactions."

Li Tongya paused and reflected on the earlier presence of Qi Cultivators, a suspicion forming in his mind. He murmured quietly, "It seems this market is no longer of use to Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators..."

The shopkeeper responded respectfully, "Senior, Cloud Crowned Peak Market provides spirit items and dharma artifacts mainly for the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm. It is rare for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to visit here. However, you may find useful information from the nearby clans... Some of them might have what you are looking for."

He continued, "Only a few markets in Yue State have spirit items and artifacts suitable for those of the Foundation Establishment Realm. In the past, the Moongaze Lake Market attracted many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Unfortunately, it is no longer active."

Seeing Li Tongya deep in thought, the shopkeeper offered an obsequious smile and continued, "You should ask around... The immortal clans on the peak, the Yuan Family at Mushroom Forest Plain, and the Yu and Fei families at Moongaze Lake might know where to find the spirit medicine you're looking for."

Li Tongya nodded, though he couldn't help but inwardly chuckle to himself.

Buying spirit medicine from the Xiao Family just to give it back as a gift is quite absurd!

Observing Li Tongya's expression, the shopkeeper asked carefully, "Senior, may I inquire which family you are an ancestor of, or which peak you cultivate at? I can gather information for you and bring any updates if there come any."

Raising an eyebrow, Li Tongya realized that this shopkeeper was smart and bold indeed, trying to find a powerful patron. However, he couldn't reveal his identity, as only close allies and immediate family knew of his recent breakthrough. Moreover, it wasn't time to intervene in this market yet. He waved it off dismissively.

"I am just a rogue cultivator."

The shopkeeper wiped the sweat from his forehead and apologized profusely. Li Tongya didn't mind this and, noting the shopkeeper's shrewdness, left him an open-ended command.

"Keep your ears open... I will return in a few years."

The shopkeeper brightened at this and nodded repeatedly as Li Tongya ascended on the wind, vanishing above the market. Finally, wiping his brow, the shopkeeper murmured, "With a Foundation Establishment Realm clan supporting us, we could move closer to the market center and avoid being pushed around."

His apprentice stepped forward and whispered, "How can you be sure? What if he is really just a rogue cultivator? Would we not be inviting trouble?"

With a sly grin, the shopkeeper replied, "The senior was seeking spirit medicine directly and openly, which are not something rogue cultivators can easily afford. His aura was commanding, indicating high status... Even at worst, he would at least have a small temple. I see you still have much to learn!"

"Yes!" the apprentice acknowledged. The staff, now cheerful, resumed organizing their herbs with renewed energy.

Li Tongya ascended on the wind, while the Cloud Crowned Peak market below grew smaller.

He mused to himself, Our family is backed by the mountains, producing many herbs and spirit items... Having a shop in the market is essential. With alchemy recipes and furnaces at home, establishing a lineage of alchemists is crucial, and medicines are indispensable. This clever and bold shopkeeper could be useful later on, so I'll keep him as a potential asset.

Reflecting on how others had reacted to his presence, he was deeply moved. He had always known Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators were respected, but not to such an extent.

He recalled how when Si Yuanbai descended from the sky, the Li brothers could only muster a facade of bravado. Now, having reached the Foundation Establishment Realm himself, he was among the same rank, being addressed as "Ancestor" and on par with a peak master of Azure Pond Sect.

"There are the three sects, seven gates. Azure Pond had thirty-six peaks and most Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, around forty of them... The Golden Feather Sect and Yue Cultivating Sect combined have fifty or so, and the remaining seven gates have around fifty to sixty. Adding in the various families and rogue cultivators, Yue State likely has just over two hundred Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators."

With a population of millions and tens of thousands of cultivators, only a little over two hundred were at the Foundation Establishment Realm, highlighting their rarity.

Though the Li Family couldn't compare to the Xiao Family, they had solid foundations now compared to other families. With the support of their talisman seeds, Li Xuanfeng was on the path to the Foundation Establishment Realm.

"As for the Purple Mansion Realm..." Li Tongya sighed. After meeting so many people, only his fourth brother Li Chejing and An Jingming showed potential to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. Adding those with mere passing encounters, perhaps Ning Wan could be included.

"Xuanxuan and Xuanling lack spiritual orifices and rely on talisman seeds... Reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm was already a huge feat for them. Xuanfeng is too fierce and wild. He is good at killing men and demons, but likely will not reach the Purple Mansion Realm. Yuanjiao and Qinghong have better talents, but not to a monstrous level. With talisman seeds, they might have a chance at the Foundation Establishment Realm, but Purple Mansion Realm is still a long shot... Who knows how many generations it will take for the Li Family to produce someone like that?"

He then sighed into the open sky, chastising himself for being too impatient.

Then he muttered, "One or two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators should be enough to maintain the family legacy while slowly accumulating more... The Xiao Family needed three hundred years for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to emerge. The Li Family is not even a hundred years old yet, so demanding more is pointless!"

Refocusing his thoughts on the spirit medicine, he considered the clans he could approach.

"The Xiao and Yu families are out of the question, and the Fei Family is as poor as ours... The Yuan Family has not had much contact with us. However..."

An idea suddenly struck him, and he thought to himself, There's one place worth checking out... I should speak to that person! Since we're neighbors, this is the perfect opportunity to form good relations.

Having made up his mind, Li Tongya rose into the air and headed west.

"Li Yuanjiao!" Li Qinghong called out as she approached with a big smile. Her clear voice snapped Li Yuanjiao out of his thoughts.

He grunted angrily and scolded, "Li Qinghong! It has been three years, and you cannot even bring yourself to call me big brother?"

"Heh."

Li Qinghong planted her long spear on the ground. The red tassel fluttered in the air as her crimson robe swayed gently in the breeze. "Are you thinking about my future sister-in-law?" she teased.

Li Yuanjiao blushed, letting out a humph. He smiled and drew his sword, feigning anger.

"Still so cheeky. Call me big brother!"

With that, he raised his sword to fend off Li Qinghong's sharp spear. They laughed as they sparred for dozens of exchanges. Li Qinghong's spear skills had improved significantly, causing Li Yuanjiao to raise an eyebrow in surprise. Despite this, he did not shy away from taunting her relentlessly.

"You spent all those years with a clan and only learned this much?" He chuckled.

Li Qinghong didn't respond but swung her spear even more fiercely. They both employed the River Crossing Torrential Step, though neither was very skilled at it. Each one would execute half a move for every full one of the other, each taking turns gaining and losing the upper hand.

After reaching a stalemate, they burst into laughter and stopped their sparring, sitting down to chat.

"Qinghong, your spear skills have greatly improved, and your cultivation has also increased. Those three years with the Fei Family were not wasted!" Li Yuanjiao praised, speaking earnestly this time.

"Brother, you do not know this, but the spiritual qi concentration on the Fei Family's Glacial Cloud Peak greatly surpasses ours. Moreover, they have a vast territory and many peaks, so it is no wonder they produce so many Qi Cultivators," Li Qinghong replied with a smile.

Li Yuanjiao wiped his brow and sheathed his sword. With a laugh, he said, "Is that not the truth? If our family did not have Mount Huaqian and Mount Yue to support us, where would our steady supply of Spirit Rice come from? We would not even be able to pay the family's tributes! Our elders and we juniors alike would probably delay our breakthroughs by three or four years."

The two locked eyes. Li Qinghong said softly, "Brother, you are absolutely right. From my perspective, without the family's expansion and prosperity, how could the branches and clans be as compliant as they are now? People are motivated by profit and fear death. The ancestor uses intimidation, and the elders placate with benefits... This is the way to achieve lasting stability."

"I never thought you would have such insight," Li Yuanjiao teased her before saying seriously, "You have indeed hit the nail on the head. With our eldest brother gone, it is up to you and I to lead our generation... We must plan carefully to maintain control over the various clans and branches."

Li Qinghong's sincere nod showed her agreement, and Li Yuanjiao appreciated her understanding, feeling the mutual trust between them deepening.

Suddenly, he recalled something, his expression changing as he asked in a grave tone, "I heard from the elders that you intend to practice the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique? Father asked me to dissuade you... Qinghong, if you have something on your mind, why not share it with me?"

Li Qinghong nodded slowly and spoke softly.

"That's right... The technique is exceptionally powerful and perfectly matches a dharma artifact in the family. I love the spear, so how could I not be tempted by such a technique? My branch already has Yuanyun to carry on the lineage, so I am free from such a burden... Not being able to bear an heir is no problem."

Li Yuanjiao could only nod. After three years apart, both siblings had made great progress. They exchanged thoughts and judged people, appreciating each other's growth.

Looking up, Li Yuanjiao noticed a streak of light coming from the east. "Uncle is back from his hunt! His Golden Age Longbow is truly dazzling," he remarked with awe.

Li Qinghong's mood dimmed as she responded softly, "Do not laugh at me, brother... I am ambitious, so I understand him well. Uncle is skilled in the art of killing but is constrained within the small world of Mount Liqing. I fear he is not content. People like him are meant to roam the world like the heroes in novels, settling scores freely, but he is confined to this mountain. Naturally, he is frustrated, though he never expresses it."

Li Yuanjiao froze for a moment, realizing this for the first time. He raised an eyebrow and asked quietly, "Do the elders know...?"

Li Qinghong pursed her lips before replying, "How could they not know? They see it but are wary of the circumstances and say nothing. Every elder carries their burdens, all for the family."

Li Yuanjiao remained silent, gripping his sword tightly. After a long pause, he sighed.

"With our family's strength currently, it will take several generations to build an immortal clan."
