# Chapter 663: Two Talisman Seeds

As Li Zhouwei finished his prayer, a clear light suffused the hall. Plumes of white mist churned within the Chongming Profund Insight Screen, and from the void, two points of white light emerged. They spun once before blossoming into two white flowers, which hovered in the air as golden characters materialized beneath them.

One read:

"Li Jiangqian."

The other:

"Li Shuwan."

Li Zhouwei and the others gave their thanks. He raised an eyebrow, glancing over at Li Qinghong, and saw a flicker of shock on her face. As the two white flowers drifted down, she immediately reached out and caught them.

"Two Talisman Seeds..."

The name Li Jiangqian brought a sense of relief, but the second name was completely unfamiliar. The three of them froze, puzzled. Only Li Xuanxuan seemed to be searching his memory.

Li Qinghong's expression was complicated. Li Xuanxuan, his brow deeply furrowed, had already retrieved a jade slip from his storage pouch to consult it. The old man was sentimental and often worried about which family lines were dying out and which branches could be used to continue them. As such, he kept the clan's annual registers on hand.

After a pause of two full breaths, a look of realization dawned on Li Xuanxuan’s face. "So, she is one of my descendants," he said. "Quite a distant one... from a minor branch now."

He let out a hearty laugh, turned the jade slip over, and handed it to the other two. "This couldn't be better!" he whispered.

Li Qinghong breathed a sigh of relief. She took the jade slip and scanned it, quickly finding Li Shuwan's name. As she traced the lineage upward, her brow furrowed again. "Li Yesheng... Li Xiewen... Li Pingyi... Hmm? Isn't this from Uncle Xiewen's line? Grand-Uncle, are you sure you're reading this right?"

At the mention of this, a flash of pain crossed Li Xuanxuan's eyes. "This matter," he began softly, "goes back to your eldest brother."

Li Qinghong's eyebrows shot up. "Brother Yuanxiu?" she murmured.

Li Xuanxuan sat down nearby, gathering his thoughts before speaking. "Uncle Yesheng didn't have many children, and Xiewen was the main heir. The others were no good. They opened a gambling den and got involved in debauchery. Your brother caught them, killed one, branded the rest, and banished them from the town. They were struck from the clan records, leaving only Xiewen..."

"Xiewen had three daughters and one son, Li Pingyi. At a young age, he..." Decades had passed, but Li Xuanxuan's voice still choked with emotion as he spoke of it. "He took his own life out of guilt over the Yu family's thunder-fire incident... and so the line was broken."

"With no heir and his brothers exiled for their crimes, Xiewen was left alone. For old times' sake, I had my seventh grandson's second son, who was a mortal and already part of a minor branch, adopted into his line. Since both were minor branches, it made little difference..."

"I see..." Li Qinghong fell silent for a moment. "Well," she said softly, "now that the line has produced a child with spiritual aptitude, it's time to welcome them back into the main clan."

Li Zhouwei listened quietly from the side. Li Xuanxuan said, "I'll go bring her back right away."

Li Qinghong smiled and nodded. "Let me go. This shouldn't be delayed. By my calculations... she's only six. We shouldn't draw any unwanted attention. I'll go under the cover of night and see what this little girl is like."

Li Zhouwei agreed. "I'll bring Jiangqian here."

In an instant, Li Qinghong vanished from the great hall. Li Xuanxuan picked up the two white flowers, not daring to touch them directly. He levitated them with his spiritual qi, his spiritual sense gently probing them.

The flowers each had twelve pure white petals. Inside, the pistils flickered like phantoms of light, shimmering in and out of focus. They emitted a rich, sweet scent of osmanthus, which invigorated the old man. He looked up and asked, "Minghuang, do you know what these are?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head. Sensing the incredibly dense Supreme Yin power within the blossoms, he took out two jade boxes and placed the flowers inside. "I'm afraid this is another long-extinct spiritual treasure," he said softly. "When I have the chance, I will seek out ancient records from the dragon or fox clans to try and identify them."

The Li family possessed other Supreme Yin treasures. Years ago, when Yu Muxian visited the lake, the Immortal Mirror had stirred, causing a branch of osmanthus and a white flower to fall. Li Yuanjiao had carefully preserved them, but even with the clan's best methods, the items couldn't be perfectly maintained and had been fading year by year.

A small portion had been used to supplement Li Wushao's life-source, but the rest had completely dissipated over the decades. Li Zhouwei sealed the boxes carefully. "They seem difficult to preserve," he murmured. "They may be treasures that cannot be exposed to the world. If we can't identify them, or if we do and find they are too precious, it would be better to use them. Elder White Ape suffered many grievous injuries in his youth. Using these two items to fortify his life-source should be enough to restore his foundations."

"Mm..." Li Xuanxuan cared deeply for his old brother-in-arms, but he couldn't help but cringe at the thought. To a Supreme Yin lineage like the Chunyi Dao Gate, these flowers were likely countless times more precious than a Radiant Sky Stone.

'Our family is using them to supplement a life-source... It's like using Supreme Yin moon essence to practice the Xuanjing Wheel technique...' The old man didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Still, he turned the jade boxes over and over in his hands before carefully tucking them away.

***

Lijing Prefecture, Lichuan Entrance.

The night wind was chilly. Rain dripped from the low-hanging branches of the loquat tree in the courtyard. Li Baotuo, shivering from the cold, pulled on two extra layers of clothing. In the yard, a group of children were laughing together.

"What's all the racket!" he grumbled, buttoning his coat as he pushed the door open. He rubbed his hands together. The weather was indeed growing colder by the day, but Li Baotuo's heart burned like hot coals.

'Heaven be praised... after generations of mortals, we finally have a cultivator...' The day before, his daughter, Li Shuwan, had managed to condense a wisp of spiritual energy after reading a cultivation manual distributed by the clan. The achievement had sent Li Baotuo into a state of sheer ecstasy.

Li Baotuo's line had never produced a cultivator, so they were far down the list for the clan's spiritual aptitude assessment. There were far too many mortal families like his, and countless six-year-old children. It was impossible to check them all individually. The usual practice was to hand out a copy of the most common Embryonic Breathing technique for families to test on their own.

Li Baotuo's ancestors had seen better days, and they weren't lacking for such a basic manual. The moment Li Shuwan turned six, he hadn't even bothered to queue up, simply retrieving their own copy to let her try. The result nearly made him faint with joy.

"Shuyuan!" His face broke into a wide smile as he saw his daughter approach. Once all his children were seated at the table, he assumed a serious posture and announced, "This is a matter of great importance. I have gone to see Clan Uncle Chengzhi... and asked him to find a cultivator to assess Shuyuan! By my reckoning, they should be arriving soon. Everyone be on your best behavior."

Li Shuwan propped her chin on the table, her eyes darting to the meatballs in her bowl. A meal like this was a rare treat.

The past glory of Li Baotuo's ancestors was just that—in the past. Their current life was quite meager. They had a large house, but anything of value had been sold off by previous generations. If they sold the house itself, they would have nothing left.

The entire family depended on the few boats Li Baotuo and his eldest son operated on the lake. It was a permissible livelihood, and when the Clan Justice Hall occasionally came to inspect, Li Baotuo naturally had a clear conscience.

'But how can that compare to cultivation?' To put it bluntly, if Li Shuwan's talent was sufficient, the entire family could move onto the lake. The stipend they would receive would be more than enough to live out the rest of their days in peace and comfort.

'As for Shuyuan... after decades of cultivation, when she comes back to see us, she probably won't even recognize us.' That's what the operas always said. Li Baotuo had heard plenty of rumors about how cultivators lived in a world apart. He figured he wouldn't see much of his daughter for the rest of his life. The thought filled him with both pride and a touch of sorrow.

Li Baotuo quickly pushed the feeling aside and began discussing with his sons how to set the table and notify their relatives for a proper banquet. Now that Li Shuwan had spiritual aptitude, everyone—those who had looked down on them and those who hadn't—would come bearing smiles. The nearby cultivator branches would even send representatives. This was the time to build connections for his daughter.

He waited for a while, his anxiety mounting, until he finally heard a call from outside the courtyard. "My dear nephew! I've brought the Guest Elder!"

Li Baotuo shot up from his seat. His sons scrambled to their feet and followed him in a rush to the front of the courtyard. "Greetings to you, honored elders!" they chorused.

The man in the lead was his clan uncle, Li Chengzhi. Though a mortal, his bloodline was prestigious. Li Baotuo's ancestor and his had been as close as brothers, and Li Baotuo had even met him as a child. "Clan Uncle, it has been too long!" he exclaimed. "This nephew has missed you dearly!"

Li Chengzhi laughed heartily. He was a shrewd man who knew how to curry favor. As the son of Li Ximing, even as a mortal, he had managed to befriend many cultivators. He had a good impression of Li Baotuo and had immediately brought a cultivator over.

He gestured to the old man in brown robes beside him. "This is Guest Elder Hu! A high master of the Qi Refinement Realm!"

"Qi Refinement!" Li Baotuo was stunned. He wasn't entirely ignorant; he knew that such figures held positions of power on the prefecture peak. That Li Chengzhi could bring such a person here thrilled him. "Greetings, Senior!" he said deferentially. "My home is humble... please forgive its simplicity!"

Guest Elder Hu was perfectly courteous to Li Chengzhi, but not so much to someone like Li Baotuo, whose branch had been reduced to a minor mortal line for who knew how many years. For Li Chengzhi's sake, he gave a slight nod. "No need for formalities."

Li Baotuo didn't take offense. He nodded repeatedly, leading them into the courtyard. He caught Li Chengzhi's meaningful gaze and instantly understood. 'He's helping me find a patron for Shuyuan!'

'But... is this appropriate?' If Li Baotuo had been from an ordinary minor branch, he would have shamelessly seized the opportunity. But he had inherited some knowledge of the clan's affairs and knew that the sixteen prefectures were not a place of perfect harmony.

'This is Lijing Prefecture... the territory of the old four families. If we're going to align with anyone, it should be one of them. I don't even know which prefecture this cultivator Hu is from. Getting involved with him... we might offend the four families...'

Besides, Li Baotuo knew his own situation. While his line appeared to be an ordinary minor branch, they were actually an offshoot from the main clan via adoption. If one of their descendants proved to be exceptional, they might even have a chance to return to the main clan. If so, there was no need to get entangled in factional rivalries!

A thousand thoughts raced through his mind. He pulled his daughter forward with a smile. "Shuyuan! Greet the two seniors!"

Li Shuwan tilted her head to look. She noticed six points of light flickering around the man in brown robes, and a chaotic swirl of energy surrounded him. It was slightly different from the people she had seen flying in the sky before, and she couldn't help but stare.

Guest Elder Hu, however, merely glanced at her briefly before nodding and striding past. 'Li Baotuo's family has been mortals for generations,' he thought with an inward sigh. 'How good can the talent of their first cultivator possibly be? Li Chengzhi wants me to offer some guidance... what a hassle.'

He put on an air of importance, his eyes sweeping over the table. Finding nothing to his liking, he said coolly, "Tea will suffice."

The elaborate feast Li Baotuo had prepared went untouched. Wiping sweat from his brow, he ushered the guest into the inner hall and seated him. At first, Guest Elder Hu deigned to respond when Li Chengzhi spoke, but the moment Li Baotuo opened his mouth, the man in brown fell silent, staring at the floor.

Even a fool could see Guest Elder Hu's disdain. The food on the table grew cold. Li Baotuo's wife stood helplessly at the back of the hall. In the end, what could a mortal like Li Baotuo possibly have to talk about with a cultivator? He was so embarrassed he couldn't speak.

Though she was only six, Li Shuwan saw it all, and her heart ached. "Father, I'll be going now," she said softly.

Li Baotuo let out a breath, about to stop her, but Li Chengzhi cheerfully let her go. After she had left, Guest Elder Hu, sensing Li Chengzhi's displeasure, asked casually, "How long did it take your esteemed daughter to condense her first wisp of spiritual energy?"

Li Baotuo felt his awkwardness ease slightly. "About two hours, I believe," he whispered.

Guest Elder Hu stared, then saw Li Baotuo's clueless expression. A wave of shock crashed through him. 'What?'

While the adults talked in the hall, Li Shuwan wandered into the back courtyard. A few loquat trees stood in the overgrown yard. As she walked, she remembered the helpless looks on her parents' faces and couldn't stop herself from wiping away a tear.

"This guy..." She took a few more steps and nearly collided with someone standing in the courtyard, making her jump.

"Ah..." Li Shuwan gasped, but her fear was instantly replaced by fascination. Her eyes were glued to the woman before her, completely unable to look away.

The woman wore a long robe of elegant feathers. Her black hair was coiled up, adorned with a small, simple white flower pin. The hem of her cyan-patterned skirt pulsed with faint points of purple light. Her eyes, hazy with a purple shimmer, looked down at her with a warm smile.

"You..." Li Shuwan was so stunned she couldn't speak. The woman reached out and naturally stroked her cheek, letting out a soft laugh. Her voice was clear and pleasant. "Li Shuwan?"

"Yes..." Li Shuwan nervously clasped her hands behind her back. She knew this person had to be a cultivator and didn't dare move. She snuck a peek and noticed that this woman didn't have the six points of light like the other man, only a rippling expanse of purple.

The celestial-looking woman nodded, her purple eyes glancing past the girl toward the courtyard gate. Her tone grew cold. "This Hu Jingye... he certainly plays his cards well. The moment he sees your extraordinary talent, he starts with threats and promises, trying to betroth you to his youngest son..."

It was strange. The woman in white had merely stopped smiling and added a chill to her voice, but her entire aura had transformed. An awe-inspiring authority settled on her features, and in the clouds above, thunder seemed to rumble and roll.

Li Shuwan looked up and thought she saw a faint purple tinge to the clouds. She quickly whispered, "But my father said he's very powerful... a big shot from the prefecture peak..."

The woman was taken aback by her words, and the coldness on her face vanished instantly. She had almond-shaped eyes that seemed to melt like ice in the spring wind. She let out a clear, bright laugh. "A big shot, indeed!"
