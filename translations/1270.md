# Chapter 1270: Falling Without Destruction

Yinling Pavilion.

The crisp sound of jade echoed within the pavilion. The middle-aged Daoist stood with one hand behind his back, holding a jade rod in the other as he lightly tapped a small bell before him; the sound was clear and bright, causing an abundant Pure Qi to emerge. It allowed the emotions of the youth below to gradually stabilize.

The youth’s eyes were round and shone with a multicolored light as he stared thoughtfully at the ground; after an unknown amount of time, he finally shook his head and spoke,

“Martial Uncle… this junior still cannot understand.”

Xuanwei stroked his beard but did not turn, instead saying,

“Do not focus on a single place. Look to the world.”

Tao Jiexing considered this with great difficulty before shaking his head.

“This junior doesn't understand these things—I would rather organize the Daoist scriptures and reread the ancient texts than ponder such matters…”

Xuanwei let out a faint sigh and said,

“It is so… back then, allowing Shidao to return to Yinling and you to enter the sect already determined the future.”

The middle-aged man strode forward and sighed.

“But you must have some discernment. If you have none at all, how could you have ever achieved the Eye of Galloping Heart? In all these years, you are the only one to have cultivated this divine ability; if you cannot even see the situation clearly, then you cannot grasp its essence.”

Tao Jiexing could only lower his head, but before he could say more, a cultivator had already rushed up from the bottom of the jade stairs and reported,

“Reporting to the Daoist Master, King Wei has broken the siege of Ruzhou, slain two of the Merciful Ones, mobilized his generals, and returned alone.”

Tao Jiexing was flabbergasted,

‘So fast!’

“Also…”

The man fell silent for a moment, but when he saw Xuanwei glance at him, he quickly continued,

“A large force of men riding flying vessels has crossed Xiangxiang and arrived at Yinling. Their leader is surnamed Ding; he claims to be from Ting Province and a general under King Wei, and he wishes… wishes to enter Yinling.”

Xuanwei raised an eyebrow and said,

“No matter. Let them proceed as they see fit.”

These cultivators had come for no other reason than to take control of Yinling's major prefectures and deal with the mystic realm. For those of the Purple Mansion Realm, anything outside the grand formation and the mystic realm itself was truly worthless—and since Li Zhouwei had no reputation for slaughtering cities for blood, there was even less cause for concern.

Xuanwei, however, was more concerned with another matter and asked,

“Have my words been taken to Liangchuan?”

This person bowed and said:

“Reporting to the Daoist Master, they went long ago, but there has been no news since.”

Xuanwei nodded.

The man immediately withdrew, just as a figure as swift as the wind and dark as ink entered the jade pavilion from the brilliant heavenly light outside. This was King Wei, who walked with the stride of a dragon and the gait of a tiger; his clothes still carried a hint of smoke, and while the Radiant Sun King's Halberd at his waist was dim, its killing intent was boundless.

He had clearly returned from slaying the Buddhists.

Xuanwei said no more, placing the small bell in his hand into Tao Jiexing's. He then said:

“Please!”

The two men activated a divine ability and rose, following the radiance of the mystic pavilion upward into the Great Void. There, they indeed sensed a fluctuation; two faint shadows lay dormant within the Great Void, seeming to rise and fall unstably.

A golden light flickered in Li Zhouwei’s eyes as he detected wisps of yin qi. They grew steadily more distinct under the illumination of the multicolored light, at once as stable as Mount Tai and as ceaseless as a trickling stream.

At the base of this yin qi, one or two rays of Bright Yang light could be seen. Their aura was as faint as a gossamer thread, flickering as if they might fall at any moment, held in place only by that ceaseless, trickling stream.

He praised:

“A fine mystic realm.”

Xuanwei stroked his beard and said:

“When it comes to construction in the Great Void, the most crucial aspect is the Profound Foundation. A 'foundation' is a vessel that contains a world and has the ability to conceal. The absolute best choice is, of course, the station of a True Monarch, a golden position of ultimate supremacy…”

“It is not difficult for a True Monarch to form their own realm, but grotto-heavens still differ. I have heard that the most wondrous method is the immortal art for the Establishment of the Azure Aether, which can create an immortal realm, though this is now the stuff of legends… For minor cultivators such as ourselves, suspending a realm in the Great Void is now very difficult; we can only maintain it by borrowing external power.”

“This realm of my sect was established when an ancestor invited a Woven Jade Immortal from the Unmoving Temple to take action. A wisp of its aura is anchored to the Land of Regret, so naturally, it is as steady as Mount Tai!”

Li Zhouwei frowned slightly:

“The Unmoving Temple? The Land of Regret?”

Xuanwei said:

“The Unmoving Temple is the Daoist ground of True Monarch Guanhua. The Land of Regret is a place he established beyond the heavens for True Monarchs who might regret their journey and wish to return… However, most who decide to venture beyond the heavens have considered it thoroughly, so very few come back. As far as I know, there have only ever been three.”

He chuckled and said:

“One returned due to some affair, and another was injured and forced to take refuge there; both were long ago. The last one, however, was much more recent, a figure from the near-ancient era, I hear… The rumors are varied: some say it was Beijia, others say it was the Zhidu, and some even claim it was the True Monarch of Wondrous Transformation.”

Li Zhouwei's expression flickered.

“Her Ladyship, the Mysterious Female…”

Xuanwei smiled and said,

“Mere rumors, do not mind them. If such a thing were true, the situation today would not be as it is.”

He did not say what situation that would be, but Li Zhouwei seemed to understand something as he glanced at him before looking toward the Bright Yang radiance. Before he could speak, however, he faintly heard a cry from beyond the multicolored light,

“King Wei! King Wei, wait!”

The voice was distant then near, loud then soft, and filled with urgency,

“Fellow Daoist Xuanwei! Fellow Daoist Xuanwei!”

Xuanwei breathed a small sigh of relief. He waved his sleeve lightly, and the barrier of multicolored light in the Great Void parted. A figure riding a True Fire rushed in hurriedly, immediately bowing with a panicked voice as he said,

“King Wei, wait!”

It was Jia Zan, who had been guarding Liangchuan to the north!

Li Zhouwei, however, was not surprised and said with a smile,

“Daoist Master Jia, were you not guarding the north? Why have you rushed here?”

Jia Zan was both shocked and panicked, and at a loss for how to respond. He stole a glance at Xuanwei, his voice lowering as he said,

“I heard… I heard that King Wei intends to move against the mystic realm…”

What else could Jia Zan be worried about?

It was naturally his junior, Wei Dangshan, who was in seclusion seeking to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!

Seeing this, Li Zhouwei understood that Xuanwei had secretly informed him, and for a moment, he couldn't help but chuckle.

As it happened, since he had already promised, and Jia Zan had taken Liangchuan for him, he naturally would not go back on his word. This was why he had sent Kuang Hong to Liangchuan with secret instructions to remind Jia Zan. He had not expected Xuanwei to have also thought of this and acted a step faster, causing Jia Zan to rush over first. The man did not dare say it was Xuanwei who had warned him, and could only stammer evasively.

‘He managed to do me a favor first.’

Seeing that Li Zhouwei did not press the matter, Jia Zan quickly lowered his head and pleaded:

“King Wei! King Wei… my junior… is still in seclusion… Once Mountain's Edge Hall falls and crashes into the grand formation, the disturbance to the Great Void will surely cause him to perish! I implore King Wei to reconsider…”

He had no intention of preserving Mountain's Edge Hall and had known for some time that his clan's foundation was doomed, but he had never imagined something as drastic as the mystic realm itself falling. He cried out,

“I, Jia Zan, am willing to offer up the resources of my entire clan, asking only that King Wei grant him a path to survival!”

Wei Dangshan was breaking through within the Purple Mansion's grand formation, where external influences were already weakened to a minimum. The fall of Gongsun Bei and even the Qiao clan's mystic realm had had some effect, which Jia Zan had accepted through gritted teeth. But he simply could not withstand Mountain's Edge Hall being located directly above the Wei family's grand formation!

If this mystic realm were to crash down, his junior would certainly die on the spot!

Upon receiving Xuanwei's secret message, Jia Zan broke out in a cold sweat. Just a short while ago he had been advising Yu Xi, and now the disaster had fallen upon his own head. He said nothing more and secretly rushed back—fortunately, his divine abilities were meager and he was already injured, so his presence would not be missed.

Li Zhouwei was, of course, aware of the situation. Though slightly regretful, he had already dispatched Li Que'wan to wait in Xiangxiang; even if the mystic realm was spared, his own people would have to enter it. But before he could speak, Xuanwei was already stroking his beard with a smile as he said:

“Daoist Master Jia, you worry too much. King Wei has already prepared a path of retreat for your junior. He has brought a Pure Qi treasure, the Bell of Suspended Void and Treasured Peace, and will have Jiexing accompany you. This matter will not be difficult!”

Li Zhouwei’s heart skipped a beat, while Jia Zan was both shocked and overjoyed. Xuanwei immediately continued:

“You must hurry!”

Jia Zan was startled and offered repeated thanks. Not daring to linger for another moment, he transformed into a streak of light and descended, vanishing without a trace. Only then did Xuanwei turn around and say with a faint smile,

“The Jia clan will be going to the state of Song in the future, so the Tao clan has no use for this favor. It is better to let King Wei have it.”

Li Zhouwei exhaled lightly, a look of approval appearing on his face for the first time as he said,

“I am indebted to you, Senior.”

In truth, this was more than a simple favor. Li Zhouwei wanted not only the spiritual resources, but for all the mystic realms of Luoxia to fall in unison. The addition of Mountain's Edge Hall would make a considerable difference to the grand spectacle!

And all Xuanwei wanted was the White Curtain Old Dream Tower and the Yin-Leap Qi. Both men understood this implicitly and left it unsaid, watching only as King Wei slowly unfastened his long halberd. His gaze was fixed quietly upon that point of Bright Yang radiance in the Great Void, his focus gradually intensifying.

In an instant, a dense darkness spread out, compressed within the multicolored light like indissoluble ink. A vast setting sun appeared like a reflection in water, twisting and wavering.

Li Zhouwei’s full suit of armor had already materialized. He raised his long halberd high, the inscription of a leaping qilin shimmering upon it. In that moment, a dense golden light flared as the Radiant Sun King's Halberd swelled in size, piercing the Great Void. It became as large as a small mountain, was lifted high, and then abruptly plunged down!

Splitting Light!

“BOOM!”

As a mystic realm, the core of the Governing Yang Grotto was exceedingly difficult to damage, which was why most cultivators resorted to assaulting its spiritual mechanics. But now, it was already on the brink of collapse, and with Xuanwei having removed its protections, the situation changed instantly!

A tremor ran through the Great Void as furious winds swept across the sky. A speck of pale white flickered in the bright heavens, and every cultivator in Yinling raised their head to stare in terrified comprehension.

That speck of pale white was like a drop of ink in clear water, expanding with incredible speed. A pale light spread across the heavens and earth, illuminating the wilderness below. At last, countless golden pavilions and towers became visible, shining brightly in everyone’s field of view.

Crashing down!

The grand formation of this mystic realm had been relatively intact, but the rupture of its Profound Foundation caused collapses everywhere. Countless magnificent pavilions and towers crushed against each other, raining down in a cascade of glazed gold, purple sand, and white stone. In response, the shattered remnants of the grand formation activated, revealing innumerable restrictive seals!

For a moment, the earth shook and the mountains swayed as the earth veins trembled. The Purple Mansion's grand formation shone with increasing intensity, suppressing the volatile spiritual energies that roiled everywhere. Pavilions collapsed, and though the cultivators in the sky had already formed a defensive array to stabilize the fluctuations, they still began to fall like raindrops.

The light of the Lesser Yang immediately flashed across the sky. A middle-aged Daoist Master stepped forth, a radiance blooming in his hand where the auras of three yang energies faintly intertwined.

“Revering the Eastern Lord!”

A righteous light poured down, suppressing the rampant streams of Bright Yang radiance. All the light then surged upward, rushing straight to the heavens. The celestial phenomena changed several times; flames leaped up in the east and the west, and in an instant, endless purple flames burned across the sky, bathing all of Yinling in a vast, violet light.

The whole world knew.

Before this soul-shaking celestial phenomenon, all of Yinling fell silent. The earth, however, began to vibrate violently. From the main hall within the ruins, a vast radiance shone, and a white pillar of light unexpectedly rose to pierce the heavens!

While using his full power to stabilize the earth veins, a look of surprise arose in Xuanwei's eyes.

“Hm?”

The instant he looked up, a dense darkness spread out. The setting sun descended, and a torrent of black and gold light surged forth to block the leaping white light!

“BOOM!”

The white light was suddenly struck and teetered on the verge of collapse, yet it still tried to flee. But a great hand appeared out of thin air and pressed down viciously upon it.

The white light flared, seeming to be a measure left by a predecessor, as if intending to burn the attacker to ashes. Yet no matter how it pulsed, the hand remained utterly unharmed. Instead, the white halo shattered like a bubble after the strike, revealing its true form: a gourd, pale purple in color and covered in golden patterns!

The object was no larger than two fingers, yet it was shrouded in a pale white light, brimming with spiritual nature. It desperately tried to flee but was held fast by the great hand, unable to escape. A dense white light gathered at the mouth of the gourd; its ferocity had been provoked, and it was about to lash out!

The black-robed young man paid it no mind as he revealed himself, colors surging in his eyes with joyous surprise.

“What a treasure!”

He swept his golden eyes over it, and the golden qilin tattoos on his face grew more pronounced. The small purple gourd finally seemed to sense something. It trembled slightly, and the white light at its mouth flickered for a moment before dissipating like an illusion. Suddenly, it stopped struggling.

Then, pale golden, thread-like strands of light leaped from the gourd’s waist, coiling around his knuckles like golden spirit snakes. They transformed into fine threads that locked onto him, and the gourd rested obediently in his palm.

The treasure had already dispelled all the dharma power left by its original owner and refined itself for him!

A strange light rippled in Li Zhouwei’s eyes. With a flip of his hand, he plucked the gourd from the air and casually hung it at his waist. Amid the numerous restrictive seals, white smoke billowed as the main hall in the deepest part of the ruins also rose from the ground, lifting high into the sky!

The hall had black tiles and golden lacquer, with crimson stairs and high, jutting eaves. The qilin motifs upon it were a domineering, flamboyant black. There were six steps leading to the entrance, flanked by two qilin statues of white stone and purple sand. Their heads were raised slightly, and they stared at onlookers with a calm, noble gaze.

The great hall rode upon the purple flames. Even after having broken free from the mystic realm, the radiance before it remained intensely powerful, refusing to touch the ground. It faintly exuded the aura of an Audience with the Celestial Gate, carrying the dense light of a divine ability whose might was in no way inferior to an ordinary Purple Mansion grand formation!

For a moment, every cultivator in Yinling raised their eyes to gaze upon this Profound Hall of Bright Yang, as if it still possessed the divine might of the Great Wei of old, refusing to be looked down upon!

Xuanwei was a step slower and had only just arrived. He said in praise,

“It is often said: 'The palaces of Wei ride the heavens, falling without destruction; the palace of Liang rides the qi, dim and without light.' It is indeed so!”

Amid the surging purple flames, the great hall's doors could be seen to be tightly shut. Two faint, golden-white residual images stood silently before it. Upon seeing someone descend, a cold voice spoke.

“Halt. The Zhaoguang does not kill.”

Then the eyes of the qilin statues on both sides lit up, their sharp claws flashed, thick with golden killing intent!

The young man said nothing more, but as Xuanwei watched with a hesitant expression, he took a step forward and naturally set his foot upon the first vermilion step.

“CRACK!”

In that instant, the raging purple flames receded, not daring to scorch his clothes. As he took another step, the two squatting qilin statues trembled in unison. Their bright eyes dimmed, and they lowered their heads in submission.

Li Zhouwei moved forward again. Divine light converged, and the palace doors, sealed for a thousand years, swung wide open. The two figures before the hall fell to their knees with a crash, their voices ringing like metal.

“We respectfully welcome Your Highness!”

The young man turned his head slightly. A similarly brilliant radiance was rising from the west, momentarily brightening the sky and illuminating his face in both heavenly light and purple flame.

The Boye Mystic Realm had also fallen into the mortal world!
