# Chapter 1042: The Scourge of War

Clouds churned in the sky as Sanskrit chants flowed through the air. Rainbow lotuses bloomed amidst an interplay of radiant light, and the vague, colossal shape of a gilded form shifted within the haze, casting an immense shadow upon the earth.

A violent gale swept across the land. A man in blue robes, his chest pierced by a golden spear, tumbled through the chaotic winds. Behind him, a Master Monk closed in fast, his wild laughter echoing through the air.

The man coughed up blood, his heart turning to ice.

‘It’s not just the ferry crossing… The entire riverbank is swarming with Buddhist cultivators…’

Chen Jinxi had been tasked with defending the riverbank alongside Li Minggong, but the sheer number of Master Monks pressing south had already made their stand a desperate struggle. Then, halfway through the battle, a contingent of Zhao State soldiers had charged in from the flank. Clad in iron armor with the unmistakable ruggedness of the great desert, these soldiers were incredibly strong. Most were at the Qi Refining level, led by Foundation Establishment cultivators. They had deliberately bypassed the positions held by Li Minggong and Ding Weizeng to break through the side—they had even used an array-breaking talisman.

The ferry crossings were lightly defended to begin with, relying entirely on the swift support of Foundation Establishment masters. The moment the flanks were breached, the line collapsed. Seeing the crossings to her left and right fall, Li Minggong knew the situation was hopeless and ordered a full retreat.

Chen Jinxi was no fool; in fact, he was quite clever. He understood the disparity in strength between the northern and southern forces and had been cautious throughout his flight. But he never could have anticipated a gilded form plummeting from the sky as he retreated. A divine ability like that might mean little to a true master, but when it crashed to the ground, it was no different from a falling mountain—and it could crush people to death. Chen Jinxi barely escaped being flattened, but the faint connection he had with the White Ape instantly shattered. He lost sight of Li Minggong and was hounded relentlessly westward.

He hadn't been a Foundation Establishment cultivator for long. How could he possibly fend off the focused attention of several Master Monks? He had fled for dozens of miles, but his body was already riddled with wounds from their golden artifacts. Blood poured from his mouth as he looked up in despair.

‘Where did the others retreat to? Don’t tell me the fighting has reached the lake…’

Below, the din of battle was deafening. The clash of golden arms and spiritual iron was a constant ring, and where the two armies met, flesh and blood flew. Just as Chen Jinxi gave in to despair, his eyes caught a flicker of movement. In the distance, a man in bronze armor stood in a pool of blood, a battle-axe in each hand. The blades, stained with gore, pulsed with a dense, crackling lightning.

‘Li Zhouda!’

It didn't matter that this tempestuous direct descendant of the Li family, the one in charge of Qingdu's affairs, had offended countless outsiders. It didn't matter how many times he had forced the Chen Clan to bow their heads. The moment Chen Jinxi saw him, tears streamed down his face.

‘Finally, a friendly face! He’s carrying powerful treasures! He can definitely save me!’

A low hum resonated as a blood-escape art rapidly consumed his vitality. Chen Jinxi felt his vision swim, his breath catching in his throat. As the scene came into focus, his heart leaped.

Li Zhouda was trapped. Golden hooks had sunk into his axes, their thick chains held taut by a Master Monk on either side, locking his weapons in place. Yet the man seemed unconcerned. A bronze bell hovered above his head, crackling with responsive lightning as if warding something off. With a powerful contraction of his muscles, he expelled an arrow from his chest and glared fiercely at the enemy before him.

Li Zhouda always fought on the front lines. He was no stranger to such injuries; they had honed his combat skills and forged his formidable physique. He raised his axes high, pulling the two Master Monks off-balance, and brought them crashing down.

_BOOM!_

A wave of thunder erupted. But Chen Jinxi had no time to celebrate. A chilling presence was closing in from behind, and his heart seized with terror.

“My lord, save me!” he shrieked.

The sudden cry made Li Zhouda snap his head up. The fierce warrior’s expression shifted instantly to one of shock and alarm.

Without a second thought, the burly man roared and leaped into the air, directing the thunder bell above him to shield the approaching Chen Jinxi.

But he was a fraction of a second too late. The instant Chen Jinxi’s plea left his lips, a figure appeared before him. Clad in silver-white armor and holding a blood-red axe high, the newcomer stared at him with a look of cruel amusement.

‘Peak Foundation Establishment…’

In the next moment, the bloody axe fell. Chen Jinxi's face, which bore a strong resemblance to Chen Yang's, twisted into a mask of pure horror. His skull split open with a sickening crack. Illuminated by the thick glow of Dawn Qi, his brain matter splattered outwards. The ghastly scene was accompanied by a harsh grinding sound and the splash of fluid.

“Urk!”

A horrifying scream escaped from what was left of Chen Jinxi’s tongue as his left hand scrambled to grab the right half of his bisected body. A brilliant, pale-yellow light burst forth from the clean-cut cross-section of his torso.

_SPLAT!_

A torrent of black blood rained down, drenching Li Zhouda from head to toe. The warrior coughed twice as another golden artifact slammed him back to the ground. Fighting the urge to collapse, he spat out a mouthful of clotted blood and wiped a hand across his breastplate.

In his blood-soaked palm lay two shattered white teeth. Their texture was slowly turning gray, rapidly transforming into river stones with the passage of time.

Li Zhouda stared blankly. Though he and Chen Jinxi had never been close, his eyes burned with rage. A sharp voice cut through his daze.

“My lord, it’s time to go!”

A pillar of Pit Water light shot into the sky, shredding a tattered robe into a storm of ash. The sudden brightness illuminated the grim face of Li Jiangxia nearby. The tall young master stood majestically among the cultivators, drenched in blood, his expression dark as he tossed a severed head to the ground.

He was here as reinforcement.

The bald head rolled across the dirt, its eyes still wide open, staring greedily at Li Zhouda. Finally letting go of his twin axes, Li Zhouda threw out a talisman and rose into the air on a gust of wind.

Li Jiangxia supported him, casting a cold glance back. The axe-wielding Gongsun cultivator paid the escaping men no mind, instead pointing at the brain matter on the ground and boasting to his comrades.

Li Zhouda coughed up more blood but remained silent. As Li Jiangxia turned, a group of cultivators rushed to assist them.

“Uncle… take this medicine, quickly!”

They fell back into the formation, and Li Jiangxia released the burly man. A woman at his side immediately draped a cloak over his shoulders.

Although Li Jiangxia had no sons, nor any woman he deemed worthy of being his wife, his household was filled with female relatives. Several now crowded around him, their faces etched with concern. He waved them away, his gaze fixed on a high-platform Spiritual Treasure hanging in the sky.

The battle had become a river of blood. The number of monks and Master Monks from the north who had fallen here was beyond counting. Li Jiangxia himself had slain three Master Monks, but the Buddhist cultivators fought without fear of death, and demonic cultivators exploited every opening. The tide of the battle was slowly turning against them.

The shadow of the gilded form in the sky passed over him. A jade ring in his sleeve, which had gone dark, lit up once more. Li Jiangxia’s heart sank.

‘Only the western ferry, defended by Guest Retainer Ding, is still holding… The arrays at the other five crossings have been shattered. I can’t let the Guest Retainer keep fighting there… If his rear is cut off, he’ll be trapped…’

The young master lifted his sleeve and tapped the jade ring. The last point of light on it dimmed. Soon after, a commotion erupted from the west as the ground began to tremble. Ding Weizeng was fighting his way back.

Their forces on the lake had already suffered heavy losses. With several crossings falling at once, demonic cultivators had poured deep into the northern bank at multiple points. Li Jiangxia estimated that in the worst-hit areas, the enemy had already torn through more than half of the northern shore.

‘Father is trapped by that Spiritual Treasure… If this battle drags on, we’re doomed…’

His heart heavy, he activated the dharma artifact in his hand, unleashing a burst of Bright Yang light that forced a group of Master Monks back. His golden eyes were frigid. A sudden thought struck him.

‘There’s trouble in the Wilderness, too… The Song Court’s army could already be in Lixia Prefecture…’

“Young Master!”

As he was contemplating, a figure rode the wind from the south and landed before him. His face was stern as he bowed his head.

“Nantanchen pays his respects to the Young Master…”

Nantanchen bowed low. Li Jiangxia, though not well acquainted with him, knew he was stationed on the eastern bank. He raised an eyebrow.

“What of the Milin Mountains?!”

Nantanchen spoke quickly. “The Buddhist cultivators crossed the Wilderness and are attacking Lixia, so there wasn't much pressure on the eastern bank. Our commander was gathering intelligence and ordered us to reinforce the river first!”

Li Jiangxia’s heart stirred. His guess had been right. He scanned the cultivators behind Nantanchen and his eyes suddenly fell upon a familiar, observant youth. He frowned.

“Suining… what are you doing here!”

Li Suining stepped forward, his expression grave. “Demonic cultivators have repeatedly slipped onto the lake. The elders know the situation on the northern bank is dire. Brother Suihuan has received orders to prepare the disciples to defend the shore. I came ahead to report to you, my lord.”

Li Jiangxia was momentarily speechless, then shook his head. “It hasn't come to that… The key is King Wei. From the sounds in the sky, I think Gongsun Bei has arrived!”

Li Suining’s face remained calm, but as he stared at the massive Spiritual Artifact that blotted out the sky, his eyes reflected the rolling glow of Dawn Qi, and his mind was in turmoil.

‘Dawn Qi,’ he thought. ‘It really is him!’

‘Gongsun Bei… During the founding war, he was supposed to be guarding Shanji. Why is he at the lake? And since when was there a massive Spiritual Treasure that could suppress the heavens?’

As the colossal gilded form shifted overhead, its shadow once again enveloped them. A deep sense of foreboding washed over Li Suining.

‘In my past life, no demonic cultivators ever made it onto the lake. The riverbank was in peril, but our forces never let the Buddhist cultivators cross the river. This means… it was the Zhao State army brought by Gongsun Bei that changed the situation.’

‘How is that possible? Gongsun Bei acts on orders from the Zhao Court and the Profound Governance Pavilion… Why would those orders change overnight?’

All Li Suining had changed was the fate of Ding Weizeng. No matter how hard he wracked his brain, he couldn’t understand why a figure as significant as Gongsun Bei—a Zhao State general with a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability—would suddenly appear at the lake. A cold dread filled his heart. Li Jiangxia, lost in his own thoughts, finally spoke.

“Fine… You all will go to the Milin Mountains for me! Guest Retainer Sun is busy treating Elder White Ape and can’t be spared. Take my uncle back with you to recuperate!”

Li Jiangxia was well aware of who Li Suining was. On a battlefield where fortunes could turn in an instant, even Foundation Establishment cultivators could be surrounded and killed, to say nothing of those at the Qi Refining level. He pulled the younger man closer, his tone serious.

“The northern bank is dense with forests and has little farmland. Even if the Buddhist cultivators scorch it a few times, the loss won't be great. But if our lines break, Foundation Establishment cultivators can still escape, while any lower-level cultivators on defense will be completely wiped out. Whether it’s the Milin Mountains or the lake, we cannot send any more troops here!”

The cultivators were stunned to hear how dire the situation had become. Li Jiangxia, however, was unfazed.

“The defense of the Milin Mountains is paramount. Tell Li Jianglong to hold his position. I was observing the battle in the sky just now and saw a Maha retreating from Lixia. It's highly likely the Song army has reached the prefecture. Make this clear to Li Jianglong—if an opportunity arises, he can boldly lead his troops out from the eastern bank and cut off the Zhao soldiers’ retreat!”

Li Suining was shocked. He couldn't believe Li Jiangxia still possessed such an aggressive spirit in such a desperate situation. He stared at him for a moment. A cold smile touched Li Jiangxia’s lips.

“Just deliver the message. If Li Jianglong proves incompetent, he can't blame me for it.”

Li Suining hurriedly bowed and helped Li Zhouda to his feet. Only then did he truly notice that the man was covered from head to toe in bloody wounds. Shards of glittering golden artifacts were still embedded in what was left of his armor.

“…Grand-uncle Zhouda!”

Li Zhouda shook his head, his face a grim mask. Bathed in a cold sweat, Li Suining turned and rode Nantanchen's magical wind south. His heart pounded in his chest. As the Milin Mountains rose before them, Nantanchen descended swiftly. A young man in black robes was pacing anxiously among the trees.

He had handsome eyes, sharp brows, and intense golden pupils. His bearing was first-class. It was his fourth brother, Li Suihuan.

If Li Suining possessed a kind of gloomy coldness, then Li Suihuan was the perfect embodiment of the grace of the Purple Mansion Realm's direct lineage. His golden eyes were bright, his stride powerful. Even in his anxiety, he maintained an air of composure—not the overbearing pride of a typical noble house, but the ethereal aura of one with the blood of a divine ability.

Though he was the eldest son of Second Uncle Li Jianglong, this fourth brother’s personality was more akin to Third Uncle Li Jiangxia’s. He strode towards them, and though he said nothing, the gravity in his nimble eyes spoke volumes.

Before Li Suining could speak, Li Suihuan rushed to take Li Zhouda from him. He gasped at the man's condition and said in a low voice, “Brother, you’re too late. Cries of battle have erupted in the south. Our forces were defeated and are retreating. Father has already led his men into the fray!”

The words Li Suining had been about to say died in his throat. He paced frantically for a few steps, then noticed his hands were wet. Just from supporting Li Zhouda for a moment, they were now completely covered in blood.

“The young masters are no ordinary men. As long as King Wei is safe, this situation is still manageable,” Li Zhouda said, his voice hoarse. His beard was matted with blood, but he paid it no mind. He took a few steps forward, looking towards a middle-aged man sitting in a nearby pavilion.

This man was also clad in armor. He had gray eyes and long eyebrows, and his face was pale—he was clearly badly injured. It was Chen Yang.

Seeing Li Zhouda looking at him, Chen Yang could no longer pretend not to notice. He rose quickly and said respectfully, “Greetings…”

“Don’t force yourself!” Li Zhouda coughed. His expression was complex, but his tone was cold and disdainful. “Guest Retainer Chen, you’ve disliked me for a long time. Just say it. You always act more respectful than anyone. Isn't that utterly hypocritical!”

Chen Yang was stunned speechless by the outburst. Li Zhouda let out a ragged breath, finally unclenching his fist and showing his blood-soaked palm to the other man.

In his broad palm lay two shattered teeth.

“But your Jinxi… I couldn't save him. I failed you…”

Chen Yang’s brow furrowed and his eyes narrowed. He looked away for a moment, then his gaze snapped back. His lips moved, but no sound came out. He took two steps back and collapsed into a sitting position within the pavilion.

The head of the Chen Clan, a man renowned for his deep scheming, contemplated for a long moment. At last, he seemed like nothing more than a father. He frowned.

“Is this all?”

Li Zhouda stood there anxiously, regretting not having a jade box to preserve them. His voice was stiff.

“This is all.”
