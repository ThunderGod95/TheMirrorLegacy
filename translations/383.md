# Chapter 488: Li Qinghong of Qingdu

"Qinghong will succeed soon?"

Li Yuanjiao felt a surge of quiet delight upon hearing this though he maintained a composed exterior, merely nodding as he said softly, "Master Monk, please return with me."

While Kongheng was quite talkative in front of Li Wushao, he only nodded in Li Yuanjiao's presence, rising to join him. Together, they ascended into the air, riding the wind back along the path Li Yuanjiao had come.

The journey was silent. Kongheng, surrounded by a golden glow, held his monk staff which emitted a mana light, giving him an ethereal appearance.

Li Yuanjiao shot him a glance and inquired, "Now that you've made a breakthrough, what are your future plans?"
ùëìùò≥ùò¶ùëíùë§ùëíùò£ùòØ‚Ñ¥ùò∑ùò¶ùìÅ.ùëêùëúùëö

Kongheng lowered his head slightly and replied, "If your esteemed family has any requests, I will do my utmost to fulfill them. Otherwise, I will continue cultivating peacefully at Moongaze Lake."

Upon reaching the peak, Kongheng excused himself and settled down to meditate, while Li Yuanjiao stood contemplatively in the forest instead of resuming his cultivation in seclusion.

After the time it took for an incense stick to burn, an urgent call came from outside the formation‚Äîit was Kongheng's voice ringing with eagerness.

"I wish to see Benefactor Yuanjiao! Please open the formation!"

When the monk descended before Li Yuanjiao, he pleaded, "Senior! I can't possibly let Xijun suffer because of me! It's my fault that I was focused solely on the secrets of my cultivation secrets and refused to disclose much... Now that I have succeeded, I must express my gratitude to your esteemed family for their support."

Kongheng spoke at length, defending Li Xijun. Li Yuanjiao merely glanced at him and remained silent. Having been with the Li Family for over a decade, Kongheng's character was well-regarded by all.

Although Li Yuanjiao was not fond of Buddhist cultivators, he recognized that the strength of such a skilled individual should not be wasted.

After hearing all this, perhaps he can really be an asset to our family...

"This is my family's affair, Master Monk. Do not trouble yourself with it. Once I have finished punishing him, he will be released," Li Yuanjiao stated simply and decisively.

Kongheng shook his head and was about to interject when Li Yuanjiao asked, "You are a Master Monk who cultivates authentic technique from Liao River Temple; what makes you different from typical Buddhist cultivators from Zhao State? I'm guessing your current strength is no lesser than a standard Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, right?"

Kongheng responded with a shake of his head, "Benefactor does not practice Buddhism; it's very complicated. I can't fully explain it, but I can only say that it is comparable to the Foundation Establishment Realm of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. However, compared to the seven Buddhist Dao of the north, it falls a bit short."

Li Yuanjiao, having once encountered the ancient immortal cultivator Wang Xun from the Wang Family, had assumed ancient Buddhist cultivators would be much stronger.

"You're saying that ancient techniques are not as effective as today's techniques?" he asked in surprise.

"Indeed."

Kongheng sighed deeply, then explained, "Master Monk and Maha of Buddhism Dao correspond to the Foundation Establishment and Purple Mansion Realm. Master Monk practices internal cultivation techniques, seeking clarity and insight... However, today's Buddhist cultivators in Zhao State have taken a shortcut.

"Master Monk doesn't cultivate but venerates Maha and Dharma Master, reciting their names daily to borrow divine abilities and share Metallic Essence for constructing a giant statue, which aids in their cultivation. Hence, their strength is considerable, surpassing that of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators."

Li Yuanjiao listened intently to this seldom-shared insight. Kongheng continued, "This path bypasses self-cultivation, resulting in the creation of the Merciful One‚Äîpretty much a stronger version of Master Monk. But without any divine abilities, Merciful Ones are thus weaker against the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!"

"Conversely, the Mahas, less constrained by the Heavenly Dao and able to reincarnate freely from life to life, turn what was once a perilous existence into a stable one, and are stronger than Purple Mansion Realm cultivators."

"I see!" Li Yuanjiao exclaimed, his long-standing confusion about the strength of these Buddhist cultivators finally cleared. His expression soon relaxed as Kongheng sighed deeply.

"Because those Master Monks from Zhao State derive their power from Mahas, their methods are particularly mystical. They can beguile and ensnare their targets, performing all manners of deceptions. Both monk soldiers and commoners are brainwashed and controlled by these Master Monks, who themselves are under the control of the Mahas' influences. Everyone in Zhao State obeyed readily; none dared to act out or express their discontent.

"The Master Monk commands from above and below, and the people comply joyfully; acts of violence are seen as justified, even cannibalism is welcomed, with elders eagerly awaiting their turn, and children wishing only to grow up faster to reach this so-called ultimate bliss..."

Tears welled in Kongheng's eyes as he whispered quietly, "Such a world... and all Master Monks call it the Buddhist State On Earth."

Kongheng looked rather lost as he murmured, "The Buddhist ancestors once envisioned a utopia‚Äîa world free from evil and sorrow, without killing or strife. They've achieved it and the people of Zhao State live in happiness and joy every day."

At these words, Li Yuanjiao felt a suffocating sense of foreboding and asked in a deep voice, "Then... What about the Emperor of Zhao State?"

"Those Jie people..." Kongheng lowered his head and continued, "A thousand years ago, the Jie people invaded the state with formidable power, blessed by heavenly fate and bearing the emperor's visage, aspiring to reign for generations. Zhao Zhaowu Emperor Fu Qiyan[1], who had been suppressing Buddhism forcefully, died suddenly overnight. His descendants lasted only a hundred years before falling under Maha's sway."

"After offering up the Metallic Essence and welcoming Maha to the capital, the current Emperor of Zhao State behaves like a mere slave... kneeling and worshiping the Maha!"

Li Yuanjiao then murmured in silence, "No wonder it is said that Zhao State will never be successful... and that the Emperor will die achieving nothing. His mind is not his own; how could he possibly ever achieve greatness?"

Kongheng sighed softly.

"Forgive me for losing my composure, Benefactor. My Dao lineage originates from the north, and though Zhao State's Buddhism conflicts with ours, I have always grieved for Zhao State."

"Who can say who is right or wrong? Night after night, people under my Liao River Temple's rule flee and smuggle themselves into Zhao State. Some even accused my temple of being an evil sect," he said sadly.

Kongheng paused, as though he was at the peak of his emotion. Li Yuanjiao asked a few more probing questions, then waved his hand and dismissed him.

Kongheng was a reasonable monk. Although he wished to continue appealing for Li Xijun, he ultimately sighed softly and remarked guiltily, "Xijun has indeed suffered because of me."

With that, he rode away on the wind, leaving Li Yuanjiao standing alone with his hand resting on the Qingche Sword.

"Second Uncle!"

While Li Yuanjiao was lost in thought, Li Ximing approached, riding the wind from behind him. He cupped his fist and bowed respectfully before saying, "Congratulations on your achievement in cultivation, Second Uncle! May you achieve the Purple Mansion Realm soon!"

This was his first time meeting Li Yuanjiao after he emerged from seclusion. Li Ximing had come to pay his respects, his tone earnest as he continued, "I believe Xijun has his reasons for what he has done..."

"Sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm... not bad."

Without responding to his remark, Li Yuanjiao assessed Li Ximing's cultivation with a hint of satisfaction and continued, "It seems you're not far from breaking through to the seventh heavenly layer. You should be ready to attempt establishing your foundation by the age of thirty."

Li Ximing shared everything about his cultivation journey, both significant and minor. Li Yuanjiao listened intently, then pressed him on with a question, his tone thick with incredulity and disbelief.

"You're saying that... bedroom activities can aid in cultivation?!"

Li Ximing, visibly embarrassed, nodded. Li Yuanjiao, however, was not one to gloss over such details. He pulled out a jade slip from his storage pouch, studied it intently, and finally said in a deep voice, "It seems there is some truth to this! While I'm not familiar with which Metallic Essence is used in the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual, it is related to the Radiant Yang, so it makes sense."

With a nod, he dismissed the topic.

"I understand now... you may go."

Watching Li Ximing depart, Li Yuanjiao picked up a small letter on the desk. It had arrived early that morning from the Azure Pond Sect. Li Xizhi had always been reliable and managed to extract much information within the sect.

"Blood Sun Fruit."

Li Yuanjiao had never heard of this spirit medicine before, so he had to dispatch his men to gather more information about it. As for acquiring it, it seemed likely that a deeper expedition into Mount Yue would be necessary.

"I shall cultivate in seclusion first and address this matter when Qinghong returns after her breakthrough!" he decided.

1. Emperor's name is Fu Qiyan, Zhao Zhaowu Emperor is his posthumous title. ‚òú

Li Ximing returned to the courtyard and opened the lid of the blackened furnace, revealing the medicinal liquid inside. It was crystal clear, slightly gray, and somewhat sticky.

"Phew! It's still alright!"

The process was quick, and the elixir in the furnace had not yet solidified enough to ruin this batch‚Äîproof of Li Ximing's high talent and the teachings of Xiao Yuansi. Since returning home, he had yet to spoil a single batch of elixir.

After completely refining the pills, six emerged successfully from the furnace. Li Ximing stored them in a jade bottle when he was suddenly interrupted by two knocks at the door.

Li Ximing frowned slightly as the door creaked open and a person entered, respectfully announcing, "My lord, there's a female cultivator outside who was sent by the family head. She is seeking guidance."

"Seeking guidance...?" Li Ximing echoed. Despite being a bit startled, he commanded softly, "Bring her over."

The attendant retreated, and soon after, a woman entered the courtyard.

This woman appeared no older than twenty, with a graceful posture and fair skin, and was dressed in a green gown. With an innocent blink of her eyes, she bowed and said, "Meng greets Senior."

Li Ximing regarded her quietly and replied softly, "Ah, so you're from the Meng Family."

Meng Zhuoyun, sensing Li Ximing's slightly inappropriate gaze, maintained her respectful demeanor and explained, "I was ordered to seek Senior's guidance on the dao of alchemy... The family head has approved this arrangement."

"Good," Li Ximing replied, observing her with an intrigued expression before instructing, "Call forth your core flame so I can examine it."
ùöèùê´ùöéùó≤ùï®ùêûùêõùïüùöòùêØùöéùóπ.ùïîùê®ùó∫

His conversation with Li Yuanjiao had just concluded when Meng Zhuoyun arrived, arousing his suspicion.

Unsure and a bit cautious, Li Ximing thought to himself, Could it be that the Meng Family is ready to join our family, using this woman's charms as a tactic? She's close to breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm... She could be quite beneficial to my cultivation.

Meng Zhuoyun was a beauty with soft skin and fine features. It was no surprise that Li Ximing had no immunity against her. While he shared the secrets of alchemy, his mind was preoccupied with something else.

Meng Zhuoyun was no longer a naive girl; her sharp mind was already at work.

This Li Ximing seems different from the rest of the Li Family. I've heard he's quite taken with beauty... If I can endear myself to him, perhaps I could secure a better position within the Li Family.

Both harboring their own motives, they exchanged glances that were filled with unspoken intentions, their voices softening as they spoke.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Xijun did not have to kneel in the ancestral hall for long. He was allowed to resume his cultivation after just a few days.

Yet, Kongheng, concerned, visited often to check on him.

The Li Family operated smoothly until the arrival of spring. When the snow had melted, mana light hurriedly approached from the west amidst clouds and fog.

It halted at the boundary of the Li Family's territory. Xu Gongming, a mid-stage Qi Cultivator, immediately flew out to greet the visitor, cupping his fist as he began, "Fellow Daoist..."

The figure within the light materialized, revealing a burly man with an intense glare who was fully dressed in leather armor. He barked, "Is this the Li Family of Lijing?"

Xu Gongming, clearly taken aback by his tone, corrected him, "It's known as Li Family of Qingdu..."

The burly man's eyes reddened with intensity as he demanded, "I don't care whether it's Qingdu or whatever! I want to know if your family has the Wanglin Blossom!"

Realizing the man was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Xu Gongming was shocked and stammered hastily, "M-My family does possess this item... May I know why you're looking for it, Senior...?"

The burly visitor was delighted by the response. He grabbed Xu Gongming by the collar and said forcefully, "Bring it to me quickly... or I'll make you miserable!"

Captured in his grip, Xu Gongming felt intense pain shooting through his limbs. His lungs felt like they were on fire as he barely managed to gasp out, "Please wait a moment, Senior... I'll inform the elders!"

The man reluctantly released him and urged, "Go, go, go!"

Xu Gongming wasted no time, quickly descending to alert the family. The Jade Court Guards had already noticed the commotion and gathered around.

Li Xicheng arrived, propelled by the wind, demanded in a stern voice, "What's going on here? Why is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from another clan here?"

After Xu Gongming explained the situation, Li Xicheng frowned and said, "What nonsense is this! We're due to submit our tributes next year... The recent harvests of Wanglin Blossoms had long been sold to other clans. There's none reserved for him."

"Although we have kept a few for personal use, they are stored in the old ancestor's cave dwelling, and he has long retreated into seclusion!" he added.

While the two men were still discussing, the burly man above interrupted impatiently, "Enough talking! Does your family have the flower or not? Don't waste my time!"

His urgency was palpable as he stepped forward, reaching out commandingly. A group of cultivators, sensing a potential threat, rushed to surround Li Xicheng protectively.

Chen Mufeng, who was standing nearby, called out, "I'd advise you to think carefully before you act, Senior!"

The burly man halted abruptly. Though anxious, he was rational. With a stern look, he gritted his teeth and demanded, "Then bring out the flower, quickly!"

Li Xicheng was equally nervous as he commanded, "Go to Qingdu and summon the old ancestor immediately!"

As soon as he had finished speaking, thunder rolled, echoing across the heavens and earth, drowning out the rest of his voice with its resonant boom.

Rumble!

Dark clouds amassed from the south, accompanied by thunder that had been suppressed throughout the long winter. As the first thunderclap of spring reverberated, a brilliant purple light surged forward from the south.

"Fellow Daoist, you seek favor yet act so imperiously... It seems you hold little regard for my family!"

From the south, a Foundation Establishment Realm female cultivator in jade armor arrived amidst the storm, her heroic presence commanding respect. Her fine eyebrows above her beautiful almond eyes knitted together, conveying her warning.

Her long black hair fluttered in the wind, accentuating her delicate ears. Strands of purple electricity flickered through her hair, casting silver-white halos that captivated everyone present, rendering them speechless.

Holding her silver-white lance upside down, Li Qinghong descended valiantly before them.

"Auntie!" Li Xicheng exclaimed joyously, overwhelmed with emotion. He was visibly excited and failed to contain his laughter.

Li Qinghong nodded slightly, her gaze softening as she looked at her family members. She stepped on the rolling thunder and lightning beneath her feet, closing the distance between them.

Behind her, Li Wushao stood in awe, bowing slightly as he respectfully retreated a step. His clothes seemed scorched and tattered, as if he had been beaten up not long ago.

The previously belligerent man was initially offended, yet when his gaze landed on her, he was struck by her stunning presence.

His confidence waned slightly as he asked in a softer tone, "And who might you be?"

Li Qinghong was dressed neatly, her appearance heroic and unadorned by makeup. The lively purple lightning around her lent an air of majesty and invincibility to her already commanding presence.

With dense purple electricity flickering in her eyes, she announced her name proudly.

"Li Qinghong from the Li Family of Qingdu."
