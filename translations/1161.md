# Chapter 1161: Jade Shattered

A storm of power swept through the heavens as a grayish-white brilliance gathered in the sky. From a supreme Buddhist Land, millions of golden and pink lights rained down, falling upon the mountain and illuminating every rock and stone across its slopes.

Towering golden figures stood at the forefront, their auras coalescing into celestial phenomena: heavenly beings anointing the earth, a rain of vibrant blossoms, blooming lotus ponds, and shimmering glazed light. Immeasurable sacred lands converged to hold aloft each of the Mahas.

At the very center, the dazzling light coalesced into a single figure. His face was like white jade, his aura noble and imposing. Behind him, it was as if Mount Sumeru itself was his bulwark, with the four continents suspended in the air. The twelve ordination scars on his scalp shone like pure gold.

He held a purple, circular mirror, large as a man's face, cupped in his hand. Responding to the will of the three Mahas, a torrent of iridescent light poured down from the Buddhist Land above, funneling into the mirror. It converged into a solid purple halo that seared the great formation below, making it tremble violently.

The man at the center was Tian Langzhi, the Liangli Maha of the Sea of Desire.

Flanking him stood two towering Dharma Bodies. One was a figure of heavy, reddish-gold, its feet trampling a mythical jackal—this was the sixth-reincarnation Dharma Protector Maha, Renshijia. The other was a black-skinned figure that reached for the heavens, clutching a profound earthen vessel—the sixth-reincarnation Earth-Governing Maha, Xiaodisa!

Every top-ranking Maha of the Way of Great Desire had followed Tian Langzhi to this very place.

The Maha holding the earthen vessel, his hands forming incantation seals, spoke with a grim expression.

"Nuzi has fallen at the lake," he said in a low voice.

Tian Langzhi's expression remained unchanged, as if the deceased was a complete stranger.

"His cultivation was insufficient," he said dismissively. "He died facing his tribulation. How pitiful. How respectable."

The Dharma Protector Maha, Renshijia, showed a flicker of concern.

"He followed the First Seat for many years. I fear... this will be difficult to explain."

At this, Xiaodisa swallowed whatever he was about to say. Tian Langzhi opened his eyes a fraction.

"Qi Lanyan sought him out to head south for one reason alone: his karmic tie to the Sparrow Carp Fish. It was a ploy to pin us down, to force our hand and make us send rescuers, thereby allowing them to tap into the divine power of the Great Desire..."

"How absurd. Now that the Sparrow Carp Fish has been reborn, that karmic bond was severed long ago. A pity about Bashan, though—he was a rare talent."

He spoke of pity, but his face held no trace of it. His eyes were fixed on the mountain of the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple below, as if his gaze could pierce through the hue of the Manifestations Earth to see the Jade True radiance hidden within. A look of keen anticipation and greed surfaced in their depths.

Watching the formation weaken bit by bit, Tian Langzhi's voice was low and deep.

"Daoist Friend Liu, must you continue this futile resistance?"

His voice echoed, seeping through the cracks in the formation as streaks of pink, glass-like light. The light shone down upon the forest, clashing with the Jade True radiance and sending up plumes of white smoke.

---

Atop the peak, a sword cultivator sat cross-legged, his face a painful, stark white. The Jade True light that normally enveloped him like a shroud of azure jade was shattered. The halo behind him was marred by dark fractures. His gaze was glacial as he stared unblinking at the sky.

During this great battle between the north and south at Lake Xian, the divine abilities had flared most intensely in the southeast. Yet the most dangerous front was not Ting Province, nor Baiye Creek, nor even Lake Xian itself. It was Tangdao Mountain.

Here, Liu Bai, the Protector-General of Jinghai, faced three Mahas from the Way of Great Desire.

He faced the terrifying pressure of an eighth-generation Maha, Tian Langzhi, leading the assault, flanked by two sixth-generation Mahas. An endless stream of Merciful Ones, both great and small, descended, all backed by the full might of the Buddhist Land of the Way of Great Desire.

The pressure on Tangdao Mountain was scarcely less than that at Lake Xian. Yet in stark contrast, the only defenders here were Liu Bai and the master and disciple from Overlook Peak.

Their only hope was the great formation enveloping the mountain.

This Great Ye Profound Exiled Spirit Formation had been personally established by Yang Ruiyi. Using the 'Bestowed Origin Transformation Manifestation Grand Marvelous Spirit Method', he had combined countless rare treasures with the unique celestial and terrestrial advantages of Jianghuai's highest peak. The formation drew upon the Manifestations Earth aspect of Earth Virtue, making it unparalleled among those at the Purple Mansion Realm.

To put it plainly, with Liu Bai defending it, not even an eighth-generation Maha like Tian Langzhi could hope to breach it quickly with his present might.

"Cough..."

The Jade True cultivator coughed up a spray of blood, a cold, ironic smile touching his lips.

"But it cannot withstand an assault so long in the making, so meticulously prepared."

The tide of battle had turned because of the purple mirror in Tian Langzhi's hand.

The divine ability of this artifact was strange and extraordinary. It bore no resemblance to a Buddhist treasure, yet it could channel the full brilliance of the Buddhist Land and even connect to the great sun in the heavens, gathering the esoteric power of the Supreme Yang.

While not designed to shatter formations, its searing power only intensified, producing an endless conflagration that was more effective than any siege weapon.

The artifact had forced Liu Bai and Xianyao out from the formation's protection multiple times in attempts to disrupt the attack. Each time, the combined assault of the three Mahas drove them back. On their last attempt... they had nearly been unable to return.

By now, if Liu Bai still failed to see the naked ambition of the Way of Great Desire, his two centuries of cultivation would have been a waste.

'Tian Langzhi was once a cultivator from the Central Plains... He inherited the Jade True lineage of the Heavenly Lang Terrace and reached the Purple Mansion Realm, but his progress halted at the precipice of the Purple Mystery. The techniques of the Heavenly Lang Terrace are exceptionally unorthodox, filled with extreme methods that damage one's character to extend one's life-mandate, or sacrifice one's life-mandate to nourish one's character. In the end, with his lifespan dwindling, he abandoned his path and converted to the Buddhist way...'

The Heavenly Lang Terrace was quite renowned. It was an ancient Daoist Tradition, far older than even Wanling Heaven, founded by True Monarch Chilang. His secular name was Liu Yubing, the very first bloodline ancestor revered by the royal house of the Chu State.

'When the Chu State fell, the legacies of the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion were lost to time. The Jade True Dao Lineage I cultivate was passed down through my clan, and it too can be traced back to the Heavenly Lang Terrace. How could I not know this!'

'He has been plotting this for a long time... biding his time, waiting for the war between north and south to escalate, for both sides to be too preoccupied to spare their Divided Aspect Bodies. Then he came, wielding the full power of the Way of Great Desire, utterly determined to convert me and claim my legacy!'

In his icy gaze, the great formation trembled ceaselessly as wisps of white energy drifted down from the divine ability. Liu Bai’s eyes shifted from the north back to the south, his gaze fixed on the gloomy Exiled Qi in the distance. He turned his head and said softly,

"Daoist Friend Lian."

At his words, an old man who had been desperately using his own divine ability to fend off the descending light turned to face him. This Daoist Master, who had reached the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm using a different Dao, was also at the end of his strength. Half his face was stripped away to stark white bone. His voice was filled with grief.

"Protector-General... We have no news from Lake Xian. We've been trapped for months, with no hope of reinforcement!"

A sharp cracking sound echoed through the mountains. An ironic smile touched Liu Bai's lips, but he didn't answer the old man. Instead, he said,

"I hear there is also a great battle at the White River. You two Daoist Masters should flee toward Baiye."

The faces of the old man and the youth beside him changed drastically. But the Daoist Master's expression was serene. With a flick of his wrist, he drew his sword, its chilling white edge pointed toward the heavens.

"BOOM!"

An infinite light of Manifestations Earth surged into the sky, finally blocking the purple radiance. The might of the Buddhist Land erupted, and a deafening Sanskrit chant filled the air.

"Daoist Friend Liu! The time for our fated connection has come!"

"DONG!"

Two golden bodies, one crimson and one jet-black, rose like mountains, enveloping the sky from left and right. The light at the center grew blindingly bright, traversing space and time to become a golden mountain that came crashing down.

Liu Bai's face was a mask of calm. The Jade True halo behind him soared into the air, unleashing a torrent of milky-white light that shot toward the heavens before violently disintegrating in the sea of clouds.

This jade wheel had been born in a grotto-heaven, its origins extraordinary. It had been nourished by spiritual energy for a thousand years before being gifted to Liu Bai by Li Ximing, becoming a Jade True Spiritual Artifact attuned to his divine ability. Now, as it shattered, it bloomed with a million points of white light, like a bright moon emerging from behind the clouds, pure and radiant.

The brilliant Jade True light pulsed, felt by heaven and earth. Even Tian Langzhi’s expression changed. He tried to evade, but an azure-white radiance coalesced beneath his golden form, trapping him like a narrow, treacherous cliff path, making it impossible to move.

It was as if Tian Langzhi and Liu Bai had vanished from the world, falling into another reality.

'Azure Jade Cliff.'

Tian Langzhi was all too familiar with this divine ability. As a cultivator of the Heavenly Lang Terrace Dao Lineage, 'Azure Jade Cliff' had been his trump card for over three hundred years. It forced an opponent onto a perilous cliffside path. While one could try to dodge, leaving the path—even being grazed by its edge—would exponentially amplify the power of any incoming attack, leaving no choice but to face it head-on.

In an instant, the curtains of brilliant light before him were violently torn asunder. The glare was so cold it made his face ache and brought tears to his eyes.

But he had no time to block the descending Jade True light. The entire sky seemed to sprout countless eyes, all fixed on the sword cultivator in the air. Seeing the furious blaze of his life-mandate erupting from his body, Tian Langzhi's face twisted in alarm.

"Stop him! Quickly!"

The moment he spoke, the face of the crimson Dharma Body, Renshijia, tore open from the brow downward. The inside was utterly hollow, containing nothing but a swirling mass of crimson light.

Liu Bai's gaze never left Tian Langzhi. The crimson light, hindered by the 'Azure Jade Cliff' technique, was already weakened. Then, something shot out from his sleeve.

It was a talisman, three inches long and a finger's breadth wide, forged of a deep, heavy crimson. On one side, profound patterns formed the character for 'Chu'. On the other, brilliant purple patterns formed two characters: 'Liu Yi'.

The moment the talisman appeared, the very colors of heaven and earth shifted. The characters flickered and pulsed with a crimson-gold light that swept away the incoming attack. Bathed in its glow, Renshijia's entire body erupted in Li Fire.

Ignoring his grievous wounds, Liu Bai shot forward, his sword drawn. The radiant light of his life-mandate blazed as he pointed his blade at Tian Langzhi. A vast sword light, merged with the radiance of the shattered Jade True artifact, slammed into the eighth-generation Maha in the sky.

"CRACK!"

A cry of pain echoed for a fleeting moment. The moon-like Jade True light receded like the tide. Tian Langzhi's jade-like face slowly came back into view, the cracks on its surface vanishing at an astonishing rate until it was once more perfect.

But a deep white line had appeared on his face. His hand clamped over his left eye, refusing to move. Wisps of white, smoke-like blood trickled from between his fingers, becoming a waterfall of white energy that rained down upon the mortal world.

Even though he had lived for eight generations, though Liu Bai was severely injured, though the Way of Great Desire was at its zenith, and though he was empowered by the full might of the Buddhist Land—faced with a strike born from Liu Bai sacrificing his own Spiritual Artifact, future, and life-mandate, Tian Langzhi had been wounded.

A cold voice bit through gritted teeth.

"Stubborn fool..."

A mountain-sized golden palm stretched across the sky, its lines like deep ravines. The five fingers closed, crushing the Jade True light within its grasp. It held firm as shards of jade and glazed light rained down.

The Protector-General's long hair flew wildly. He was but a speck of white light, clutched tightly in that giant hand. Yet his face was calm, utterly unconcerned as his divine ability and life-mandate burned away without restraint, forming a milky-white halo against the crushing pressure.

Suddenly, the world fell silent. Tian Langzhi's expression shifted, and he looked off into the distance.

Countless streams of black qi surged from the south like a tidal wave over a mountain, pushing a swaying, profound nether-palace across the sky.

Yang Ruiyi!

He had bypassed Shanji, conquered Baiye with lightning speed, and now he had arrived.

His appearance was a stone cast into a placid lake, sending out infinite ripples. All-consuming darkness instantly shrouded the sky. The jet-black Maha moved, raising its earthen vessel high and smashing it down.

"BOOM!"

The Great Void shuddered as if the world were ending. The Exiled Qi that had flooded the heavens stalled. Tian Langzhi’s voice was a mixture of shock and fury.

"Yang Ruiyi? You abandoned Shanji Prefecture!"

Though the distant scene was now reflected in his eyes, Liu Bai, trapped in the palm, remained calm. He reversed his grip on his sword, lifted his head slightly, and placed the blade against his own neck.

In that instant, a chill shot through Tian Langzhi's heart. His feigned rage vanished, replaced by genuine urgency. His voice, carried by his power, rushed into the palm.

"Daoist Friend Liu! It doesn't have to be this way!"

Liu Bai’s eyes held only irony. It was as if he hadn't even seen the rapidly approaching Yang Ruiyi, a sight his captor had deliberately let him witness. As his divine ability surged, Tian Langzhi's voice turned hateful.

"Liu Bai! Have you forgotten the blood debt of your ruined state and exterminated clan?"

The Daoist Master's expression finally flickered. Tian Langzhi's resentful voice, laced with power, echoed again.

"Whose family destroyed the Chu State? Whose family destroyed the Heavenly Mansions? When Xiao Ci usurped the throne, who served as his wings? The armies your Liu clan raised to restore the state—by whose hand did they fall? And who left you here to die, sending no aid for months?"

"Don't you hate them?"

His words were filled with rage, but they only served to calm Liu Bai's eyes. The sword cultivator raised an eyebrow, his gaze seeming to pierce the Great Void to some dark, hidden place. There, an old man in Daoist robes stood quietly.

The man had hair like snow, and a large gourd stood beside him. His gaze was gentle, tinged with pity. Across the veil of space and power, he watched Liu Bai silently, as if awaiting his answer.

In his hands, he held a scroll about three feet wide. It was not unrolled, but its exposed, light-azure, fish-scale-patterned surface emanated an elegant, profound light.

A small smile touched Liu Bai's handsome face, whether of irony or self-deprecation, it was impossible to tell. His sword finally moved. His jade-like skin split, and crimson beads of blood like jewels gushed forth, sliding down the hilt with a clear, melodic clinking.

"CLANG!"

Countless streams of sword qi erupted from his body, every last bit of his power and dharma force becoming fuel for the inferno. Amidst Tian Langzhi's furious roar, a dense, potent Jade True light shot into the heavens.

The light was a startling shade of bluish-white. His body exploded like a clap of thunder, shattering the sky into countless fragments of jade that rained down. In the heavens, celestial palaces and pavilions materialized. There were visions of colorful sleeves serving diligently, of fair hands offering jade. Then, the candles were extinguished, and the moon shone down upon a silver lamp.

A divine ability had fallen.

---

The two celestial phenomena over Lake Xian had not yet fully formed when this Jade True brilliance rose in the west. The streak of white light was gentle, yet it sent a shiver down the spine of all who saw it, a stark testament to the bloody nature of this war.

On the same day, another divine ability had been extinguished. The third mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had fallen.

The sky over Jianghuai had changed completely. The accumulated celestial phenomena had reached a boiling point. The Jade True light continued to rise like mist, piling up like snow in layer upon layer until even the Exiled Qi began to dissipate.

The sky full of Jade True light was reflected in the surging pupils of the man in black. This Grand General of the Song State, this agent of the Yang clan's interests, stood silent and motionless against the distant horizon.
