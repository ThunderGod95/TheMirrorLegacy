# Chapter 963: Yang Zhuo

Deep down, Li Jiangliang felt awkward and more than a little cautious.

This elder brother of his... he had truly enjoyed every privilege. As the eldest son of Bright Yang, he wasn't just sent to the island at birth and groomed as the heir in all things; his treatment and cultivation had surpassed his peers his entire life.

His cultivation level didn't matter so much, but it was this treatment that left his other brothers feeling helpless.

Li Jiangliang knew perfectly well that his second and third brothers both possessed considerable talent and spirit. In any other family, they would have been outstanding leaders in their own right.

In fact, from Li Jiangliang's own interactions over the years, he felt his eldest brother, Li Jiangqian, was too cold and ruthless. His second brother, Li Jianglong, was more earnest, and his third brother, Li Jiangxia, was more genuine. True, Moongaze Lake had thrived and become a model of order under Li Jiangqian's governance, but any of his brothers could have done just as well. Yet, whenever they were in Li Jiangqian's presence, they were inexplicably diminished, as if they were a level below himâ€”and it was about more than just his status as the first-born son.

Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing, was their family's first Daoist Master. Every time he emerged from seclusion, he would summon either Li Jiangqian or Ding Weizeng. Li Jiangliang and the others appeared prominent, but the number of times they were granted an audience with the Daoist Master, or even their own father, was negligible. All the other brothers' visits combined probably didn't add up to Li Jiangqian's alone. This was the true foundation of his unique status.

Li Jiangliang couldn't help his complex feelings. He bowed and said with a sigh,

"Congratulations, Elder Brother, on your great advance in cultivation!"

His spiritual sense registered it clearly: the Li Jiangqian before him had already reached the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm.

'He's probably... a strong contender to be the next to reach the Purple Mansion Realm...'

His heart was a tangle of emotions, but the crimson-robed man before him was all smiles, his presence as refreshing as a spring breeze. He walked up, nodded to Yang Tianyou, and chuckled.

"I just emerged from seclusion and heard you were in the Mushroom Forest Plains, Fourth Brother, so I stopped by... This must be your wife. She is as lovely as rumored!"

Yang Tianyou smiled but said nothing. Li Jiangliang wore a helpless expression.

"I had no intention of disturbing you, Elder Brother. But all of us brothers were born with these golden pupils; our identity is obvious wherever we go. News travels fast, reaching Moongaze Lake in an instant."

Li Jiangqian started walking back with him, shaking his head.

"It's unavoidable. Although the relationship between the Yuan Clan and our family has faded, they are, after all, the clan of our Lord's own master. Even if Yuan Chengzhao is a good-for-nothing who repeatedly causes harm, the family must still look out for them. Naturally, we pay attention."

He clasped his hands behind his back, pacing as he asked with feigned casualty,

"Your wife is from..."

Yang Tianyou smiled and curtsied.

"The Yang Clan of Simin... just a small, unknown family."

She stated it clearly: the Yang Clan of Simin, not the Yang Clan of Diyun Peak, Azure Pond. The difference between the two was vast.

Li Jiangqian nodded thoughtfully. "That's not quite right. The Yang Clan of Simin are also orthodox imperial descendants, descendants of King Yue."

Yang Tianyou smiled without replying. Li Jiangliang stepped forward.

"Elder Brother, did you come to see my brother-in-law? He's cultivating at Heavenly Thunder Peak, not in the city. We'll have to head south."

Heavenly Thunder Peak was one of the wonders of the Mushroom Forest Plains. Because large deposits of thunder-ore were buried in the mountain, heavenly lightning rolled across it endlessly, year-round, leaving the peak and its base scorched black. Li Qinghong had once borrowed this place to achieve a breakthrough, a fact the Li family knew well.

But at the mention of Yang Zhuo, Li Jiangqian's eyes narrowed slightly. He smiled, "Since I'm here, I must meet him. I've only heard you praise him; I've yet to see what kind of man he truly is."

Although Li Jiangliang knew Li Jiangqian meant no harm by this visit, seeing his attitude, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He turned to his subordinates.

"Remain here and guard the city. I'll be back shortly."

The two brothers rose into the air, riding on flames, and flew south. The smile on Li Jiangqian's face faded, his expression growing calm, his voice distant.

"You haven't returned home in many years. Do you miss it?"

Li Jiangliang bowed in response. "Of course. I miss it terribly."

Li Jiangqian didn't acknowledge his answer, speaking as if to himself.

"Lord Cui's cultivation has advanced, and he has now returned to Chongzhou Island. You should have been there to see him off, but the timing was unfortunate."

At the mention of Cui Jueyin, Li Jiangliang was visibly moved. "I heard. The path to the Purple Mansion Realm is fraught with peril. I was in Simin at the time, and I hated that I couldn't rush back. In the end, I wasn't able to personally escort Master back to the island..."

They arrived suddenly at Heavenly Thunder Peak. Thunder crashed, and the smell of scorched earth filled the air. Li Jiangqian saw a one-armed old man in green robes approach them. His beard was sparse, and he cringed, his head lowered. His gaunt face was sallow and withered, the clear mark of chronic injuries and a lack of resources. He spoke in a low, subservient voice.

"This lowly one greets you, my Lords..."

Li Jiangqian glanced at him, a flicker of surprise on his face. "Ah, if it isn't Lord Yuan Huyuan... Please, no need for such ceremony!"

Yuan Huyuan kept his head bowed, hunching his shoulders, and darted a pleading glance at Li Jiangliang. But Li Jiangliang simply smiled as his elder brother helped the old man up. He gestured to the man and said,

"He is the Yuan Clan Head now."

Sweat poured down Yuan Huyuan's face as he repeatedly stammered that he wasn't worthy. Li Jiangqian, however, adopted a serious tone.

"For all these years... Yuan Chengzhao was the master of the Yuan family, and it wasn't our place to interfere. Now that you've escaped that sea of suffering, better days are ahead."

He then retrieved a golden pill box from his sleeve and pressed it into the old man's hand.

"Please, take this..."

Yuan Huyuan didn't even know which generation of the Li family this young man belonged to. He was bewildered, unable to process how he had fallen from being called 'Senior' by Li Chejing to this current, wretched state. A confusing mix of hot and cold sensations washed over his limbs. He looked again at Li Jiangliang, his eyes filled with a desperate, lost plea.

Li Jiangliang smiled. "Clan Head Yuan, please accept it."

Only then did the old man quickly hide the box in his own sleeve, crying out,

"Thank you, my Lords! Thank you!"

The two brothers had already started up the steps, coming to a stop in the courtyard on Heavenly Thunder Peak. Li Jiangqian lowered his head slightly. He saw flows of purple energy streaming across the steps, which were covered in a fine layer of white crystals, like frost, as white as snow.

Two steps higher, they saw a white-winged immortal crane standing on one leg in the courtyard. Its long beak was tucked into its feathers, lost in a deep sleep.

Li Jiangliang's expression changed instantly. He shook out his robes, took a step back, and announced respectfully,

"Reporting to my Lord! The Li Family Head has come to pay his respects."

The hall doors creaked open, and a man stepped out. He appeared young, dressed in white robes. His dark eyes were sharp and slightly tapered, giving his handsome face a severe cast, yet his naturally elegant eyebrows lent him an air of dashing, unrestrained charm.

He stood in the courtyard and raised those eyebrows. The white crane instantly awoke, gave a light push, and spread its wings, ascending into the clouds.

"Li Jiangqian of the Moongaze Li Clan, greets Fellow Daoist Yang!"

Li Jiangqian offered the greeting with a smile. The man before him smiled back and led him into the main hall. He raised an eyebrow at Li Jiangliang, but his words were for Li Jiangqian.

"Ah, a guest from Moongaze Lake. Forgive my discourtesy in not welcoming you sooner."

Li Jiangqian privately noted that this man possessed a refined elegance, far from an ordinary person. He took a seat beside him, his gaze sweeping over the hall's entrance. The vision of flowing purple energy and frost-covered steps was gone, leaving only the dark, scorched stone.

Yang Zhuo had already spoken, his tone pleasant.

"I have long heard of Moongaze's reputation. It is I who should be paying you a visit."

As Li Jiangqian finished his observation, he felt a sudden, piercing might wash over him. He couldn't explain it, but it made him feel intensely threatened. He sensed no malice, yet it felt as if the other man had inexplicably pressed a blade to his throat, ready to cut down his prestige.

He knew instantly that Li Jiangliang had not been exaggerating. He was shaken.

'It's true. This man is on the same level as Father.'

He smiled. "I came today... first, simply to meet you, and second, regarding the Yuan family's affairs. And third, of course, for my brother's marriage... Seeing the Yuan family now being put to good use, I feel a thread of karma has been settled."

"The root of the chaos has been removed. The Yuan family will naturally find peace."

"As for the marriage... my father has mentioned it."

Yang Zhuo shifted his gaze, the sharp aura retracting.

"His esteemed self is advanced in years and has always had exacting standards. For Jiangliang to earn his favor shows he is a first-class talent, a dragon among men. I also heard that Daoist Master Minghuang has given his approval. This is an excellent match."

Yang Zhuo turned his head, no longer facing him directly. He didn't seem to hold much goodwill for him. Li Jiangqian, in turn, felt a profound sense of unease, like needles on his back. His golden pupils dropped, scanning the floor near the entrance. He discovered that the threshold was covered in tiny snakes, each no bigger than a finger. Water and fire roiled on their scales, and their tails were linked together, forming a shimmering, dancing carpet of multicolored light.

Li Jiangqian suppressed his reaction and forced a smile.

"It's just that it hasn't been easy for my fourth brother, venturing out all alone. In the future, we will have to trouble the Yang family with many matters..."

Yang Zhuo replied,

"He is not only my younger sister's beloved, but also my good friend. I consider him my own brother. Family Head, you need not be so courteous."

They exchanged a few more pleasantries and chatted about trivial matters. Finally, Li Jiangqian raised his golden eyes.

"Then I shall not impose any longer."

He exited the main hall and rose into the sky on his flames, speeding away. Li Jiangliang followed to see him off. The two brothers flew in silence for a long time. After an unknown while, Li Jiangqian finally chuckled.

"No wonder you were told you had to follow him... He is a truly formidable man."

Li Jiangliang had not missed Yang Zhuo's animosity toward Li Jiangqian. He felt a little helpless as he replied,

"My following him isn't some gamble... My Lord has said, he can bring peace to the Yue lands and separate the mortal from the immortal. His pursuit of the Dao... has always been to end conflict with strength, to save the common people..."

This sentence only made the smile on Li Jiangqian's face widen. He made a subtle, almost imperceptible motion of grinding his teeth, his eyes burning as he stared at his younger brother.

"That's true! How could a noble imperial descendant be content with a single prefecture?"

Li Jiangliang stopped within his flames. He bowed deeply to this elder brother he barely knew.

"Brother... I have made things difficult for the family..."

Li Jiangqian's superficial smile froze. His eyebrows drew together as his brother continued in a low voice:

"When you see Father, please relay a message for me... Jiangliang... will never take a single thing from the family. If I do, then let me answer to our ancestors with my life!"

...

The Vermillion Sea, Suzhu Reefs.

The reefs were scattered across the vast sea like stars in the sky. Their crimson rock was dazzling under the sun. Flights of cultivators in white robes rose and fell among them, creating a lively scene.

High above the islands, at the very apex of the sky, a Daoist Master in white robes stood with Spiritual Swords on his back. His expression was solemn, his gaze tinged with sorrow as it swept silently over the islands below.

Beneath Fuxuan's feet lay the famous SuzhÃ¹ Reefs, a core territory of the Vermillion Sea. This was the overseas base managed by the Hengzhu Dao for generations. Over hundreds of years, it had been fortified into an impenetrable stronghold, its Purple Mansion Realm grand array shimmering with power.

'Only now, it no longer belongs to the Bi family!'

Many years ago, Hengxing had personally visited the Chunyi Dao Gate to trade for a portion of 'Star-Soul Divine Origin' from Fuxuan. In exchange, the SuzhÃ¹ Reefs were to be mortgaged to the Chunyi Dao Gate for fifty full years.

At the time, the Chunyi Dao Gate was at the height of its prestige. With a newly ascended Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it was eager to expand its influence. The deal had seemed incredibly favorable. Fuxuan, after careful consideration, had agreed.

Now, with the Hengzhu Dao sealing its gates, Fuxuan finally understood.

'Hengxing... she had been planning this from the very beginning. This so-called 'mortgage' to my Chunyi Dao Gate... it was just a way to have my family guard these islands for her while her own sect was sealed!'

Still, when he weighed it all, both sides had profited. And they were, after all, both part of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. At this, Fuxuan felt a secret sense of relief and became much more comfortable with the situation.

He waited over the sea for a while. Finally, a streak of light approached from the east, rapidly manifesting before him as a man in green robes.

The man was young, his green robes fluttering. His eyes were a pale azure, and his face was all smiles. He bowed to Fuxuan and said casually,

"Fellow Daoist Fuxuan!"

"Fellow Daoist Chi!"

Fuxuan replied, his tone flat.

The young man stood with his hands behind his back, appearing perfectly at ease. He smiled.

"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist."

This man was none other than the long-missing Chi Buzi!

His eyes were the same pale azure as before, revealing a cold indifference. A string of jet-black, glossy prayer beads hung at his waist, pulsing with the light of Pristine Water.

He seemed unchanged from several years ago, save for the fluctuating aura of his divine ability, which felt... different.

The two entered the grand array together. When Chi Buzi remained silent, Fuxuan finally had to speak first.

"Your... gains. They were substantial, I presume?"

Chi Buzi took a sip of tea, a faint, unreadable smile playing on his lips. He set the cup down.

"There were some gains," he said quietly. "After all, I refused to join the Buddhists. That only leaves so many options. Pu Yu only offered a few words for your sake and mine; he would never get involved personally..."

"Still, there was a turning point."

Fuxuan shook his head. "Otherwise, you wouldn't have come here. And you certainly wouldn't be so eager to meddle in this mess."

Chi Buzi's gaze gradually turned ice-cold and sharp. He stared blankly at some distant point.

"It's the turning point I'm afraid of," he said softly. "What if it was left behind by some great power? How many have reached the end of their cultivation, only to discover they were just placing the final piece on someone else's board? ...Still, being a game piece is one thing. What I fear is being the piece that's only needed to fill a space, and not to stay alive."

He seemed to be weighed down by some great hesitation, and the implication of his words was clear. Fuxuan's heart sank.

'Penglai never meddles with Fruition Attainment. Since Pu Yu spoke, it must have been a method that wouldn't offend Pristine Water. What else could it be... but reincarnation?'

He looked down at Chi Buzi, his own heart heavy. The words of Daoist Master Yuanshang from all those years ago echoed in his ears. Their situations were, in fact, quite similar. A complex expression crossed his face as he said in a low voice,

"Some opportunities... you cannot question their origin. You simply must use them!"

Chi Buzi clearly hadn't expected him to say such a thing. It struck the very core of his worries. He raised his azure-tinted eyes and gave Fuxuan an appreciative smile, but his mind flashed with a different, razor-sharp thought:

'Oh? Fuxuan, Fuxuan... does your Chunyi Dao Gate... also carry an opportunity that it is forced to cultivate? An opportunity... from the Supreme Yin Daoist Tradition?'
