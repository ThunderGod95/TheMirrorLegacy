# Chapter 494: Luken

Li Yuanjiao rode the wind along the northern foothills of Mount Dali, the mountains and rivers passing swiftly beneath him. Spirit mist poured out of the Profound Patterned Bottle, shrouding him as he flew onward with his hands clasped behind his back, his expression calm and composed.

Xijun should be able to manage it... Although the old man is stubborn, he is aging and in poor health. A little tact might coax him out.

Li Yuanjiao's face darkened. He had always felt dissatisfied with Li Xuanxuan's neglect of his own health.

He really likes dragging things out...

Li Yuanjiao suddenly recalled a moment from his youth when his mother, Mu Yalu, had sat with him alone in the yard. She was still young then, with her flowing silky hair draping over her shoulders.

She always told him gently—"Your father... is a very boring man. He loves only one thing in this life—the Li Family. Even Xiu'er barely made it to the list. Li Xuanxuan doesn't even love himself, maybe he's even disappointed in himself. He never takes care of himself and looks down on himself, thinking that his life is probably worth less than a few pieces of Spirit Stones."

At the time, Li Yuanjiao still did not understand what she meant, but now, witnessing his father's state, the truth finally dawned upon him.

Among all the members of the Li Family, he only looks down on himself. After the old ancestor's death, he has lost all interest in living. He keeps drawing talismans day and night, longing for death yet afraid to embrace it.

Li Yuanjiao felt a pang in his heart, but yet could not bring himself to say those words out loud.

Before his mother drew her final breath, she refused to look at Li Xuanxuan. He never shed a tear for her either. Li Yuanjiao stood between them at the time, feeling a mix of both sadness and anger.

"Forget it," he mumbled.

Not wanting to dwell on it further, he pushed his thoughts aside and continued flying through the mountains.

Soon enough, he spotted two brown deer demons flying toward him, their smooth, delicate fur glistening in the light. They stood together and spoke earnestly, "Greetings, Exalted Immortal!"

These two deer demons were both late-stage Qi Cultivators, bowing so low that their heads were nearly buried in the clouds. They dared not look directly at him, only glancing nervously at his Qingche Sword.

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, and the deer demon on the left explained hurriedly, "I serve the demon general. The general has specially prepared a banquet and would like to invite the Exalted Immortal to join us!"

Their politeness caused Li Yuanjiao to grow suspicious. He quietly tightened his grip around the hilt of his sword. Although the White Banyan Fox was a guarantor, he was not certain of the deer demon's strength. If they harbored ill intentions, a peaceful resolution could be difficult.

He had not brought the mirror with him this time, but fortunately, the Qingche Sword retained a sword intent within it, so dispatching a deer demon would not be a problem.

Since I've asked the White Banyan Fox to introduce me, they shouldn't ambush me. If they do, I'll have no choice but to use my sword intent.

When he rode the wind closer, Li Yuanjiao noticed that both sides were lined with demons bowing their heads in respect. Most were deer species, their fur similar in color and perfectly symmetrical, having fully adopted the ways of the human race.

As he rode along, he spotted three tables set up beneath a massive white banyan tree. The White Banyan Fox lounged comfortably on the table at the front, munching on a spirit peach.

Next to him stood a middle-aged man with brown hair and black eyes. His long hair cascaded past his shoulders, over a large shield that he carried on his back. Li Yuanjiao sensed that he was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm Cultivator and guessed that he was the demon general.

The tables were filled with an array of peaches, apricots, fruit wine, and fresh flowers. As soon as Li Yuanjiao landed, the middle-aged deer demon approached him with a polite greeting.

"Luken of Mount Dali greets fellow Daoist," he said.

Luken had a small face, round eyes, and a rare yellowish-brown hair color—remnants from his transformation. His clear eyes held no trace of bloodlust or cruelty.

"Li Yuanjiao of Qingdu."

Li Yuanjiao observed Luken, noting the clear aura between his eyebrows, which set him apart from the pig demon before. Having a better impression of him, Li Yuanjiao bowed respectfully to the White Banyan Fox.

"Greetings, Senior."

Although he had witnessed the White Banyan Fox's abilities in the cave, the friendship between the fox and Li Tongya alone compelled him to show respect. Despite his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he remained humble and courteous.

The fox nodded, flipped over, and slid behind the table.

"I've taken care of the pig demon's issue. Since his background was lacking, I added a few more Spirit Stones and invited this Daoist friend to join us."

Pointing to the deer demon, it continued, "This is Luken, a kind demon and my friend from the den. You can interact freely with him in the future."

Li Yuanjiao thanked him and quickly retrieved ten Spirit Stones from his Storage Pouch to offer to the White Banyan Fox. The fox accepted six pieces and tucked them away, reaching for another spirit peach to munch on while saying, "Carry on, both of you; I have some other matter to attend to."

With that, he took off. Luken then turned to Li Yuanjiao and said, "When I was cultivating on the southern foothill, I'd already heard about your esteemed clan. Now that I see you, it's clear you are indeed exceptional."

Li Yuanjiao merely nodded in acknowledgment. Luken then led the others to sit down, producing a jade box.

Presenting it with a smile, he said, "This is the Qianyan Radiant Fruit, a treasured panacea. It's a gift for you. I'll be cultivating in the northern foothills from now on and I would appreciate any guidance you might offer..."

Li Yuanjiao opened the jade box to find an orange-red stone bead inside. It had no distinct smell, and its light was faint.

Luken quickly explained, "Don't be fooled by its unassuming appearance, fellow Daoist! This fruit is highly beneficial for cultivators practicing earth and stone techniques. It can aid in cultivation and breakthroughs, and it has many miraculous effects when used to craft dharma artifacts. If consumed, it can also stop bleeding and prolong lives."

Li Yuanjiao shook his head slightly and replied, "Fellow Daoist, you must have been cultivating for quite some time to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. It's quite rare to find any earth and stone cultivators in Yue State, aside from those in the Profound Peak Gate. This treasured panacea... it's not particularly useful to me as I also have a Wanglin Blossom at home, which is also quite well-known... It can also be used to prolong lives."

Luken's expression fell slightly as he lowered his head. He rummaged through his sleeves and pulled out two large deer antlers that resembled small trees rather than twigs.

He said warmly, "I didn't mean to present such a meager gift! These antlers were shed when I reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. They're substantial enough to be made into weapons or dozens of Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts."

Though Luken had kept these antlers all this time with the intention of crafting them into dharma artifacts for himself, he reluctantly offered them instead.

Li Yuanjiao had no desire to embarrass him. Since the White Banyan Fox had made it clear that the deer was its friend, he had to be courteous toward the deer too and instead asked, "Fellow Daoist, do you know anything about the Blood Sun Fruit?"

"Blood Sun Fruit? That sounds unfamiliar," Luken replied with a slight frown.

However, he visibly relaxed when he received the request from Li Yuanjiao.

"While I haven't heard of that treasured panacea, you've come to the right person. I'm older and hold some sway among the other demons. I'll ask around for you—it's no trouble at all!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded and described the Blood Sun Fruit as outlined in the letter from Li Xizhi, detailing its appearance and characteristics for Luken to note. He then inquired, "How old are you, fellow Daoist?"

Feeling reassured after receiving clear instructions, Luken replied, "I am over five hundred years old. If we count from when I gained intelligence, I've been around for more than four hundred years."

"That's pretty impressive!" Li Yuanjiao responded.

Although Luken was over five hundred years old, he still appeared middle-aged and in his prime, suggesting a lifespan of around a thousand years—something many would envy.

Luken sighed and said, "Fellow Daoist, you're correct. Despite our long lifespans, few of us live to see a full life. Many without backing are captured or killed early on, and even those with backgrounds are often treated as commodities with clear price tags."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in understanding, thinking to himself, It seems that most of these demon generals are quite aware of their circumstances, yet they remain powerless to change their situation.

Luken smiled and continued politely, "When I was still uncivilized, I cultivated alongside other deers in the Mushroom Forest Plain. Azure Pond Sect had just been established at that time, and the Yuan Family had only been based there for a few decades. When the Yuan Family later destroyed the Mushroom Forest Demon Den, I moved to Mount Dali.

"I had a close friend in the Dali Demon Den, and he had kept me safe for hundreds of years. Unfortunately, he failed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm and perished. After that, I was released to become a demon general, and I've held that position for several decades now."

Though this deer demon had lived for a long time, he spent most of his time cultivating in the forest. He did not seem to be a cunning person and was rather pleasant to talk to.

Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and remarked, "It seems like you have quite a strong background in the demon den, fellow Daoist."

Luken shook his head and quickly replied, "Nothing like that! Forgive me for saying this, fellow Daoist, but the sword immortal of your esteemed clan also served Azure Pond... did the sect take care of him? It's the same with the demon den but even more ruthless. If I hadn't requested to leave the den, I would have been eaten sooner or later."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in understanding. His interest was piqued after hearing that Luken was five hundred years old.

"Fellow Daoist, do you also know about... the war four hundred years ago?" he asked carefully.

"Of course I do! It was a significant event. My old friends died one after another, and now there are only a few who know of it."

Luken nodded, looking at Li Yuanjiao's expectant gaze, then continued, "The Golden Feather Sect and Azure Chi Gate surrounded Li Jiangqun and killed him; the sun and moon darkened and the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators formed a formation to block the supreme void. The Azure Chi Devil Gate had been established for five hundred years, but this battle drained its strength and shook its foundation."

Li Yuanjiao frowned and asked, "Wasn't it the three sects and seven gates?"

"Three sects and seven gates..?"

Luken was taken aback before saying, "Of course not! Yue Cultivating Sect and Snow Ji Gate were never involved... Profound Peak Gate and Changxiao Gate weren't established until later. Apart from Lingyu Gate on Li Jiangqun's side, only the Golden Feather Sect and Azure Chi Devil Gate joined forces with Hongxue, Lichi, and Wuzhu Gates."

"Please elaborate, fellow Daoist!" Li Yuanjiao urged.

Luken nodded and continued, "It was an intense battle. The Golden Feather Sect and the Devil Gate were better off. Most of the Daoist Masters from Hongxue, Lichi, and Wuzhu Gates were killed by Daoist Master Donghua... One of the Daoist Masters from Wuzhu Gate managed to escape thousands of li to the Eastern Sea, but he still vomited blood and died in the end, which was great for the Eastern Sea cultivators."[1]

"The surviving Daoist Master of Hongxue Gate obtained the immortal sword of Daoist Master Donghua, but he also died on the way back. Since then, the immortal sword has been missing, and the cultivators of Jiangnan and Jiangbei have searched for it everywhere. Imaginations roamed."

Luken then lowered his voice and whispered apprehensively, "Although Daoist Master Donghua is dead, he managed to wipe out the three Dao lineages single-handedly. Those from Azure Pond Sects and Golden Feather Sects lived in fear for a hundred years... He was truly a genius!"

Li Yuanjiao processed the information and asked softly, "But... Why did they have to kill Li Jiangqun?"

Luken shook his head, confusion etched on his face as he replied, "No one knows. Li Jiangqun cultivated on the lake by himself, and The Golden Feather Sect and the Devil Gate would even occasionally seek his help. Daoist Master Donghua had always assisted them... He was praised for his contributions but then the sects suddenly turned hostile overnight! They wanted him dead no matter what!"

The deer demon sighed.

"The thoughts of Purple Mansion and Golden Core Relm cultivators are beyond the understanding of others. Just like this devil plague... Jiangnan's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators only watched without intervening. Who knows what their true intentions are?"

Li Yuanjiao nodded, considering this. He then asked casually, "What dharma artifact did Daoist Master Donghua use?"

"What else could it be?" Luken smiled before answering, "A sword, of course..."

"Just one sword...?" Li Yuanjiao asked again.

"Only that one sword," Luken confirmed with a nod.

"One that could kill a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator and dispel his divine abilities. It caused leaves to fall from Mount Dali like rain and raised the water level of Moongaze Lake by three chi. I was still at the Qi Cultivator back then but I remember everything vividly," Luken said, gazing off into the distance.

Luken paused, seemingly lost in his own memories.

"Daoist Master Donghua had already reached the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, yet he died overnight. For three nights, no moon was sighted in the region; the sky was as black as ink. I couldn't cultivate for those three whole nights. I hid in the cave, gripped by only fear."

No moon...

Li Yuanjiao felt a sense of relief mixed with regret as he remarked, "This phenomenon showed that he must have been close to achieving the Golden Core Realm."

Although that was what he said, he pondered inwardly to himself, Daoist Master Donghua had only a sword... So the immortal mirror isn't Lu Jiangqun's dharma artifact! If it belongs to the Moonlight Origin Mansion... who else could it belong to if not Li Jiangqun?

After a few more absent-minded exchanges with Luken, Li Yuanjiao reminded, "Fellow Daoist, about the Blood Sun Fruit—please help me locate it. If you find one, my family will reward you generously!"

"Rest assured..." Luken replied readily.

Li Yuanjiao nodded then added, "Please do your best then. My family needs more than one, so don't worry."

Luken understood his implication and nodded repeatedly. With that, Li Yuanjiao departed on the wind.

As he flew away on a cloud of mist, Luken sighed with relief and returned to his seat. He glanced at his bewildered subordinates and waved his hand.

"You're all dismissed!"

The lesser demons bid farewell. Luken eyed the untouched fruit wine that Li Yuanjiao had left behind, poured it back into his jade cup, and took a sip. Just then, the White Banyan Fox approached on demonic wind and landed gracefully before him.

"Greetings, young master!" Luken said, bowing hurriedly.

The White Banyan Fox shook his head indifferently.

"I'm no longer a young master. Since my adoptive father died, neither of us has any backing... We're just lingering here..."

Luken replied in a hushed tone, "As long as you break through to Foundation Establishment Realm, you'll earn the surname of the fox clan and return to the demon den once again. Don't underestimate yourself..."

The White Banyan Fox did not respond to Luken's remarks but instead lay down under the tree with its legs propped on the table, and changed the subject.

"How do you find Li Yuanjiao?"

Luken pondered for a moment before answering, "I've seen many demons, but I rarely interact with humans. This one reminds me of a serpent dragon—unwise to offend... and being targeted would be even more troublesome. It's best to stay on good terms with him."

The White Banyan Fox flicked its tail and replied, "Fortunately, you don't eat people and with my favor, he won't trouble you... Once I go into seclusion, just take care of yourself and cooperate more."

Luken nodded as the White Banyan Fox yawned and murmured, "My cultivation has improved rapidly over the past ten years. I can choose a day to enter seclusion soon... It would be great if I could break through. If I fail, you should just join the Li Family as long as your spirit remains intact..."

With that, the fox dozed off, leaving Luken to sit at the table alone, sipping the fruit wine and lost in his own thoughts.
