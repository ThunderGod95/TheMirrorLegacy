# Chapter 1279: Transmutation

"Moongaze Lake… is a fine domain."

Dark clouds drifted across the sky as the lake island lay shrouded in night, the distant pavilions shining brightly with lights, and an old man dressed as a fisherman stood on the shore, gazing silently, saying after a long while:

"The changes here are so earth-shattering that I can hardly recognize the place."

Following behind with his head bowed, Xiao Yuansi could not help but look toward several snowy peaks to the north, where a rather magnificent gatehouse stood on the northern shore of Moongaze Lake; then, seeing a streak of light flash across the sky, the Alchemist said:

"This is the Zhou Martial Gate; the Li Clan's domain has six such gates, all guarded by the direct lineage, and this one faces north. Having seen us, they should have gone to report to the Daoist Master by now."

Xiao Chuting nodded slightly and waited quietly, and after only a short moment, he saw a swathe of Bright Yang radiance shuttle over and manifest upon the lake's surface, revealing the figure in a platinum Daoist robe who bowed and said:

"Greetings, revered elder!"

He bowed deeply, then turned to Xiao Yuansi at his side and said eagerly:

"Greetings, Master!"

The visitor was, of course, Li Ximing.

Xiao Yuansi's affection for Li Ximing went without saying; just seeing him was enough to wash away much of the sorrow in his heart, and a gentle smile surfaced in his eyes as he spoke:

"Your divine abilities have grown ever more profound, Daoist Master. This Xiao is honored to witness it!"

Xiao Yuansi had always been exceedingly courteous, and even as his master, he did not put on airs before a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator; Li Ximing bowed deeply, said no more, and simply stated:

"King Wei is in the hall, quietly awaiting Daoist Master Xiao."

Xiao Chuting took a step, and with no visible sign of a divine ability, he walked upon the water without a trace and shrunk the distance with every stride; floating lightly southward, he soon arrived before the purple and gold pillars, where Li Ximing led him inside as the old Daoist Master chuckled and said:

"Pingya Island… the Moongaze Lake market; I came here in the past, and I told them then that this place had the foundations for a clan and that to use it as a mere market would be a waste. As expected, it came to pass."

Li Ximing said:

"It was only by relying on your divine abilities to remove the Yu Clan's backer that my family was able to acquire this land."

"Yu Yufeng…"

Xiao Chuting raised an eyebrow, as if these were all matters of a distant past, and spoke softly:

"Even without me, Xiao Chuting, there would have been others; once someone cultivates a Jade True Foundation Establishment, they cannot be allowed to remain, and they were all fated to perish before True Monarch Shangyuan verified his Dao."

Li Ximing had a vague recollection of the events of that year, but thinking back on it now, the details were hazy, and he said:

"It's widely rumored among the lesser cultivators on the lake that the fear was they would become tonic for the True Monarch."

Xiao Chuting shook his head and said with a smile:

"That is both right and wrong; the crux of the matter was actually the Azure Insight Origin Mirror. Under the shroud of such a peerless treasure, even a True Monarch's divinations are blinded. Yu Yufeng's path to the Dao was ruined early on, yet he was a stubborn one and insisted on forcing his way forward in cultivation. Thus, as his cultivation level grew higher, it became difficult to answer to those above, so they simply disposed of him first."

Li Ximing said:

"There was also someone from the Fei family."

"It was all done casually."

Indeed.

Whether it was resolving the Li family's greatest trouble or the sudden calamity that befell the Yu and Fei families, all the storms that swept across the lake, all the monstrous waves that rose and fell—the cause, the culprit, was nothing more than a casual act.

In the space of a few sentences, they had arrived before the grand hall, whose pale golden doors slowly opened to reveal a young man seated at its head; dressed in ink-black robes with golden pupils, he quietly read a Daoist scripture, yet it seemed an invisible setting sun hung behind him, causing all the splendor of the great hall to surge toward him.

This was the first time Xiao Chuting had seen this White Qilin, and he could not help but look at him a few extra times.

Li Zhouwei, in turn, was observing him.

Xiao Chuting's aura was now extremely restrained, like that of a mortal old man in a straw cape and conical hat, making him seem utterly unremarkable, yet under Li Zhouwei's golden eyes, an extremely dangerous aura permeated the old Daoist Master's aged and frail body.

A Pit Water divine ability so dense it was like black lacquer was coalescing within his body, seeming ready to erupt at any moment, yet there was also a vague sense of imperfection…

'His divine ability is perfected? It seems so, and yet it doesn't…'

This King of Wei frowned to himself.

'So fast…'

In his opinion, Xiao Chuting's innate talent could not be considered good, or he would not have taken nearly three hundred years to reach the Purple Mansion Realm; yet, to master five divine abilities in the next two hundred years was a speed that could only be described as genius!

"Greetings, King of Wei."

Although Xiao Chuting was the first divine ability cultivator to support the Li family, one who could even be addressed as 'senior' by Li Tongya himself, and was now a Great Daoist Master with perfected divine abilities, he put on no airs upon meeting the White Qilin, instead remaining polite and calm.

"Senior Xiao."

Li Zhouwei smiled slightly:

"I have long admired your reputation."

Li Ximing took this in, merely supporting Xiao Yuansi as he said:

"Master… please!"

The doors to the great hall immediately sealed shut and the grand formation activated, leaving only two people within the vast, empty space—a Great Daoist Master whose Pit Water divine ability was perfected, and a King of Wei whose might shook the north and south.

This White Qilin of the mortal realm strode forward, descending the golden stairs step by step as he spoke softly:

"The Xiao Clan has been away from Jiangnan for many years; it is a rare occasion to have a revered elder such as yourself visit today, and to find you have already perfected your divine abilities!"

A hint of admiration was visible in Xiao Chuting's eyes as he spoke:

"What the King of Wei says is half right; the Xiao Clan in fact still has a bloodline in Jiangnan—the Wu family of Lixia are actually the descendants of my elder brother, Xiao Chuwu, who remained behind in Jiangnan as a provision for the Song Court's needs."

Li Zhouwei's expression shifted, and he could not help but nod:

"Impressive. Utterly without a trace."

Xiao Chuting shook his head with a laugh and said:

"That was not my arrangement… it merely happened to be of use. As for perfecting my divine abilities…"

He suddenly smiled without speaking, his gaze filled with profound meaning. The King of Wei's eyes gradually grew more intense as he spoke:

"Pit Water Fruition Attainment?"

Upon hearing this, the smile on the old man in the straw cape and hat slowly widened, and he said languidly:

"The King of Wei has a discerning eye."

He stepped forward, and the vast, boundless radiance of 'Pit Water' that he had kept suppressed within him finally rippled outward, plunging the entire hall into darkness as a torrent of aqueous light surged up and transformed into a cascade of treacherous, flowing waterfalls.

Five paths of Pit Water converged!

In that instant, he no longer resembled a common old man; an infinite, pitch-black water essence cast a shadow over his features, while illusory, multicolored lights like snakes and Flood Dragons coiled around his face, and his pupils became a soul-stealing, pitch-black void.

His voice was ethereal:

"Correct. I seek the Pit Water Fruition Attainment. As for the 'Vast Ocean' technique Ximing delivered, I never actually cultivated it. Are my divine abilities perfected? Yes and no."

Xiao Chuting gave a wizened laugh:

"I imagine the King of Wei is aware of the matter of 'Pit Water's' overflow."

"In ancient times, there was the 'Abyssal Seizure Transformation,' where a divine ability was stolen from Mansion Water and placed within Pit Water, becoming Pit Water's Vast Ocean. This divine ability was said to have originally belonged to Mansion Water, where it was called 'Vast Dredged Lake'."

"Life-Nourishing Flood Dragon is another name for it—they are two sides of the same coin."

The old man's smile slowly faded. As he spoke, the phenomenal aura of his divine ability shifted continuously, manifesting as mountains and rivers in which it seemed countless black Flood Dragons were swimming, and he continued:

"Ever since the Abyssal Seizure Transformation, rivers have overflowed without being cleared and lakes have dried up without being replenished. This Life-Nourishing Flood Dragon was forced away, escaping into the great river to become the Jing Dragon King, while Vast Dredged Lake received the river's abyss and was infused to become Vast Ocean…"

"The ultimate result of this was that Pit Water gained the aspect of convergence, while Mansion Water came to resemble Valley Water, giving the Pit Water divine ability a completely different set of characteristics."

The old man said with a smile:

"There is something the King of Wei may not know. This old man reached the level of four divine abilities a very long time ago. The overflow of 'Pit Water' makes it unsuited for a Intercalary Attainment, and it also shifts its immortal threshold from three divine abilities to four—because 'Pit Water' has six divine abilities in total!"

Li Zhouwei's eyes gradually brightened, and after pondering for a long while, he said in admiration:

"So that's how it is!"

The old man said ethereally:

"This immortal threshold blocked me for a very long time. Strictly speaking, I would have had to cultivate all six divine abilities to be considered perfected, but the final one… is now impossible to complete."

The King of Wei said:

"Is it because you are out of time?"

Xiao Chuting's words were ethereal:

"It is true that I do not have much time left, but earlier, there was still a chance to make an attempt. That, however, is only half the reason."

"The other half of the reason lies with the Dragon-kin."

His tone finally wavered:

"The river and the lake converged to form Vast Ocean, and Pit Water seized it. This was single-handedly facilitated by the Dragon-kin, which gave it the aspect of Converging Water. I have consulted with a certain great personage; to verify this Fruition Attainment of an overflowing Pit Water using an unprecedented six divine abilities is a path for which no Dao Lineage or Quest for Gold method can be found. There is no precedent. People have tried, but they have all failed."

"In truth, for a cultivator of my level to verify it, there was originally only one method."

Xiao Chuting said indifferently:

"Find a way to return the Vast Ocean."

"As long as a Mansion Water cultivator has verified their Dao, at the very moment I verify mine and the 'Pit Water' Fruition Attainment resonates, if they simultaneously reclaim the Vast Ocean and stop the 'Pit Water' overflow, I can then use the ancient Quest for Gold method to seek the Dao normally, and thus become the Pit Water True Monarch!"

He said with regret:

"But the Mansion Water path is already incomplete, and the Dragon-kin watch it far too closely. The position has long been vacant!"

Li Zhouwei was silent, and Xiao Chuting continued indifferently:

"Alternatively, one could first verify the Dao of Converging Water, then find an opportunity to ride the momentum of a greater trend and enact a transmutation from the position of Converging Water to obtain Pit Water."

Li Zhouwei's gaze flickered slightly:

"Transmutation?"

Xiao Chuting's expression was solemn:

"To ascend via the Orthodox Nature is called 'Fruition'; to gain through a partial auxiliary is called 'Auxiliary'; a staggered, alternate arrangement is called 'Intercalary'. These pertain to matters of divine ability."

"For the orthodox position to change hands is called 'Transmutation'; for an auxiliary to succeed the primary is called 'Transference'; for a profound scheme to seize the sovereign position is called 'Transformation'. These pertain to matters of venerable cultivators."

"Thus, what is called 'transmutation' and 'transformation' is for the venerable position of Converging Water to gain ascendancy and then seize the position of Pit Water!"

Li Zhouwei's pupils dilated, staring firmly at him.

Xiao Chuting's tone was placid, yet the things he spoke of were anything but ordinary; this was knowledge that no Purple Mansion Realm rogue cultivator should be privy to, and even some direct disciples of Golden Core lineages might not understand it with such clarity!

'He must have a True Monarch backing him! Perhaps not even an ordinary one!'

Xiao Chuting did not hold back, continuing in that ethereal voice:

"Throughout history, the prodigies who have achieved Auxiliary or Intercalary Attainments are countless, and the venerable cultivators who have enacted transmutations and transformations are not in the minority. Something as noble as the Supreme Yang has its divine matter of 'Abdication-Transmutation'; something as profound as Gathering Wood has its immortal office of 'Slaughter-Transformation.' There are even those who achieved the Dao in ways the ancients could never have imagined, whose deeds cannot be adequately described even by searching all the ancient records."

"To annotate Grasping the Transcendent is called Derivation; to add a stroke for Golden Oneness is called Borrowing… these are feats accomplished by individuals not seen in tens of thousands of years."

The shock he felt was submerged within his golden pupils as he silently committed the other's words to memory. Xiao Chuting smiled and said:

"In short, any path impassable at the divine ability stage is one that can only be walked at the Golden Core Realm. A Intercalary Attainment for Converging Water is fundamentally impossible, and since the Dragon-kin occupy the Converging position, they control who owns the Pit Water position!"

Hearing this, everything became clear in Li Zhouwei's mind.

'No wonder the Dragon-kin don't even bother with him! No wonder Golden Oneness said he couldn't succeed!'

'He is attempting to accomplish a Golden Core Realm feat with the body of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. How could he possibly succeed!'

Li Zhouwei looked at him quietly.

"Since the orthodox Fruition of Pit Water is so difficult to attain, did you never consider seeking an Auxiliary Position, senior?"

Xiao Chuting looked at him with a smile:

"Correct. Logically, with my divine abilities being incomplete, seeking an Auxiliary Position should be my only way forward. Before I arrived in Cangzhou, I did indeed entertain such a thought."

"Does the King of Wei recall what I said? That when the Pit Water position gained the Vast Ocean, it took on the aspect of Converging Water?"

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouwei instantly:

"Si Boxiu died pursuing a Intercalary Attainment, Dongfang You perished seeking an Auxiliary one—Converging Water despises the Auxiliary Position!"

Xiao Chuting's smile slowly turned icy:

"Only after I was reminded did I realize that the overflowing Pit Water resembles Converging Water; the orthodox position and the receptive position are in resonance. It allows no one to achieve a Intercalary Attainment, nor does it favor an Auxiliary one, leaving only the single path of beating one's head against the wall of the main Fruition Attainment. This is the very means by which the Dragon-kin and certain others have been able to keep the Pit Water position masterless and rest easy all this time!"

As he finished speaking, the smile in his eyes grew increasingly tinged with sarcasm.

Li Zhouwei finally understood the source of Golden Oneness's certainty. His gaze was sharp as he said quietly:

"If that is the case, what benefit do the Dragon-kin gain from Pit Water remaining in a state of overflow and without a master?"

His words were exceedingly sharp, instantly grasping the crux of the matter; their edge even pointed directly at the relationship between Xiao Chuting and the Dragon-kin, causing the old man to fall into a long silence before he finally spoke:

"What the Dragon-kin want is the Water Virtue. At the very least."

"Among the five waters, Pristine Water was destroyed by the True Hornless Dragon; now, even though that personage has obtained it, they sit on pins and needles. Mansion Water has dried up and been severed, and even the sole surviving Valley Water remains silently concealed, avoiding being targeted only by virtue of its innate characteristic of hiding. Meanwhile, the might of Converging Water is unrivaled in the world; this particular Fruition Attainment, which loves to gather and dominate, possesses an insatiable desire. Imbuing the orthodox nature of Pit Water with the aspect of Converging Water was their masterstroke, and they will absolutely not permit anyone else to meddle with it!"

"I am only a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator and do not understand the final conditions for their quest to become a True Dragon, but all knowledgeable people in the world know that, at least before the so-called True Dragon achieves the Dao, They absolutely cannot allow Converging Water's absolute dominance within the Water Virtue to be broken."

His eyes were bright, and every word he spoke was a pearl of wisdom:

"This is the opportunity for the Converging Water Dragon Monarch, who is at the peak of the Golden Core Realm, to verify his Dao!"

"What's more, it is not only the Water Virtue that they want!"

Li Zhouwei nodded slowly, the faces of that group from the Hornless Dragon lineage becoming ever clearer in his mind, and he said quietly:

"In that case, for you to verify your Dao-fruit, senior, must be as difficult as ascending to the heavens."

Xiao Chuting smiled without answering, yet seemed to have noticed something:

'But for someone like him, Xiao Chuting, however difficult the Auxiliary Position might be, could it be more difficult than the Fruition Attainment that requires an act of transmutation? I fear the True Monarch backing him must have some plan and a degree of confidence! Have they already created a Quest for Gold method? Or perhaps… some special secret art…'

A name flashed through his mind.

The Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation!

A long silence descended upon the great hall. After an unknown amount of time, Li Zhouwei spoke in a low voice:

"Your Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation, senior… old Daoist Master Chen delivered it to the lake, and this King has received it. The Chen Clan… are they your doing? Will they be assisting you in Badger Prefecture?"

The old Daoist Master gave a derisive laugh:

"Chen Yin…"

His expression was composed:

"That man received my secret method, but he would never dare to offend the Golden Feather Sect, let alone the Dragon-kin and those unknown True Monarchs. No matter how handsomely I rewarded him or how many resources I gave, the most he would do is play dumb and lock himself away in Yuyang, waiting for my attempt at verifying the Dao to be over."

Li Zhouwei raised his eyebrows and said:

"It seems you had other intentions, senior."

Xiao Chuting said indifferently:

"Correct. Him not acting against me is but one part of it. The second… was that I gave him the Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation to help him attempt a breakthrough merely so I could observe how much of a connection still remains between 'Mansion Water' and 'Vast Ocean'."

The old man turned his head, his expression full of regret:

"His breakthrough failed, which shows that 'Vast Ocean' and 'Mansion Water' have already drifted very far apart. No wonder Chen Xuanli failed."

Li Zhouwei then understood completely:

'He was using Chen Yin for his own trial and error!'
