# Chapter 858: Old Enemies

Years ago, the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven had been thrown into turmoil by Chu Yi, causing it to fall from the Great Void. Countless spirit items and artifacts rained down into the mountains below, flooding the entire Eastern Li Mountain range with a surge of spiritual energy that nourished a generation of cultivators.

The Three Sects and Seven Gates of Jiangnan had profited immensely. The fortunate ones made a fortune, while even the lesser powers managed to get a taste. Daoist Master Qiushui and Daoist Master Yuansu, who had overseen the affair, had undoubtedly acquired an untold number of treasures...

Now, with another grotto-heaven emerging, the Li family had to secure the specific spirit sword they sought. It was a prize they absolutely could not afford to lose. If it came down to it, they would have to cross the river and seize it by force.

'But that won't be easy...'

If Daoist Master Tinglan didn't return soon, there would be no one to command the situation. How could the powers of Jiangbei simply allow the Three Sects and Seven Gates to come and go as they pleased? Even if she did return, her authority couldn't compare to that of Qiushui and Yuansu from Li Jiangqun's era. Qiushui, in particular, had the backing of a Golden Core cultivator. Back then, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had been able to pour into the region, carve out territories, and plunder the grotto-heaven at will.

This thought only deepened his anxiety.

If Daoist Master Tinglan *could* replicate the feats of Yuansu and Qiushui, the chances of the sword falling into the Li family’s hands were slim, though they might be able to trade for it later. But if she lost control of Jiangbei entirely, then who would claim the grotto-heaven’s treasures? The whole situation would dissolve into chaos.

Li Jiangqian picked up several jade slips, ordering someone to make copies and send them to the clan.

Li Que'wan reminded him, "With Daoist Master Tinglan and Daoist Master Qiuhu absent, we still need to answer Li Quantao's query. He has always been a friend to our family. We should try... try to help him if we can."

Li Jiangqian glanced at Li Minggong, who nodded in agreement. "You're right," he conceded. "We have a long-standing relationship. Why don't we reply like this... Advise him to let his people proceed, but tell him the Daoist Masters have not been seen, and that Jiangbei may be on the verge of upheaval. He should watch his words and act with extreme caution."

Naturally, Li Jiangqian had no intention of revealing too much. Before the others could respond, he added, "Did Li Quantao mention that son of his?"

"No," Li Que'wan replied. "Since entering Jiangbei, the young man has been like a stone tossed into the sea, causing not a single ripple. We haven't received any letters from him, though we know his life jade is still intact."

Li Jiangqian listened as he finished writing the letter. "Then it's best not to say more. Let this be our response. Tell him that with the prestige of Azure Pond backing him, the factions in Jiangbei won't dare harm his son. He can rest assured."

Li Minggong, having waited patiently, finally spoke. "I heard something interesting. The former emperor of the northern Eastern Yue, a man named Dili Youjie, came to the lake recently. He said he's preparing to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and hopes to receive the lake's blessing."

"Dili Youjie?" Li Jiangqian frowned. The name was vaguely familiar. "I remember him. He sat on the throne of the northern Eastern Yue for many years to reach this point. His junior, Dili Guang, still serves beside Uncle Zhouluo, a loyal servant. What cultivation art does he practice?"

"The Geng Metal Art."

Li Minggong smiled. "He made some preparations for his technique. It’s crude, but it shows he's put some thought into it, as there are compatible arts within the clan he could switch to. I plan to take him to the clan repository, help him change his cultivation art, and then send him into seclusion."

Li Jiangqian nodded his approval.

"Also," Li Minggong said softly, "I hear the clan's project, the Thirty-two Prefecture Purple-Broad Spirit Needles, is nearing completion. I came to ask you about it."

"I know," Li Jiangqian said with a shake of his head. He had been overseeing the project and knew the details better than anyone. "It is indeed almost finished. The cost of this Purple Mansion Realm formation has been staggering, the largest drain on our inventory in a century. It's nearly depleted our entire stock of related spiritual materials and even drove up the price of such resources across Yuebei by half a percent. We even had to provide a substantial amount of spirit rice to the Purple Smoke Gate as part of the deal."

The Li family's system was different from other clans, making their spirit rice production among the highest of the Purple Mansion Realm powers in the Yue State. But a surplus of spirit rice wasn't particularly valuable, so it was clear the Purple Smoke Gate was doing them a favor.

"The next step is to have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator set up the formation. But with Daoist Master Tinglan missing... and even if she weren't, with her not yet having returned, we can't risk letting an outsider set up the formation alone. We'll likely have to wait two years."

Li Minggong nodded. "The formation isn't urgent. The priority is to finish the project and send the people from the Purple Smoke Gate on their way. The north and south are in turmoil, and the incident with Daoist Cao set a precedent. If more people start coming to the lake to recruit disciples, it will only lead to trouble."

With that, Li Minggong departed, leaving Li Jiangqian to sigh. "The elders have cultivated a fierce spirit over the years. Forged in the conflict between north and south, they've only grown more formidable."

While Li Minggong wasn't as exceptional as Li Chenghui, her cultivation had deepened with age, making her qualified to be a peak master in the Three Sects and Seven Gates. Li Que'wan agreed, then added, "Jiangliang is getting older. It might be time for him to return and visit Qingdu and Yuting. He should make the rounds and prove his worth."

Li Jiangqian nodded thoughtfully but didn't issue any immediate orders. He dismissed her and paced the grand hall alone, gazing north at the dark clouds from which the heavy rain still fell.

'If the Abyssal Gloom Medallion truly was Daoist Master Tinglan's design... which faction is it that doesn't want the Supreme Yang Dao to benefit?'

He strode forward, only to see the rain clouds overhead thicken. A streak of light shot from the distance and landed on the island. Soon, hurried footsteps approached. Chen Yang, clad in black armor, stopped before him and bowed. "Clan Head, a message has arrived from Azure Pond Sect. An elder from the Hengzhu Immortal Dao has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, manifested a divine ability, and taken the Daoist title 'Nanzun'."

"The Hengzhu Immortal Dao?" Li Jiangqian was momentarily stunned, a hint of regret in his voice. "From which generation is he?"

Chen Yang hesitated slightly. "It is said this Daoist Master spent nearly thirty years achieving his breakthrough. However, his seniority is quite high, close to that of Daoist Master Hengxing. His secular name is Bi Chengjuan."

"Bi Chengjuan... I've never heard of him." Li Jiangqian nodded slowly. The name was indeed unfamiliar. "Whether it's the power of their blessed land or some other method, the Hengzhu Immortal Dao is truly fortunate to have added another Purple Mansion Realm expert. It seems they are poised to become the leading Daoist tradition in the Yue State."

He sighed again. "It's just a shame... that Daoist tradition is so eccentric, so incompatible with others. And their feud with the Golden Feather Sect... I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing."

After a moment of thought, he gave his orders. "Propriety demands we send someone to offer congratulations. Also, send a reply to Azure Pond Sect. Inform them that Daoist Master Qiuhu has not manifested her power in a long time, and ask if they can contact her to give Dantai Jin a warning."

**Xiaoshi Mountain**

The peaks of Xiaoshi Mountain rose and fell, their slopes sparse and desolate. The rare, torrential downpour only made the landscape seem more bleak as pale yellow rainwater carved channels down the mountainside, washing away what little soil remained. The runoff flowed down into the tributaries of the ancient Huai River, eventually emptying into Baijiang Creek.

Amidst the downpour, the iridescent lights of several divine abilities shimmered within the dark clouds. A man in brown robes stood in the heavy night sky, his eyes a pale grey. With his hands clasped behind his back, he trod upon an ebony aura of power, his gaze sweeping across the mountain below.

Xiaoshi Mountain was once the seat of the Secret Diffusion Sect and the origin of their Daoist tradition. Though it had been occupied by Buddhist cultivators for a time, the crumbling ruins still held an ancient, sorrowful beauty, made all the more poignant by the storm.

After a brief survey, the man brought his hands together before his chest and blew out a stream of dark yellow light that spread across the area. He then focused, channeling his divine ability as if searching for something.

A step behind him stood a woman in red robes. Her face was youthful, and she held her head slightly bowed in a gesture of respect. "Lord Kui Qi," she whispered, "have you found anything?"

The woman was, of course, Daoist Master Zhu Gong. Hailing from the overseas territories, she was a cultivator of Earth Virtue and had once been branded a demonic practitioner. Before a cultivator of the Supreme Yang Dao, she was naturally deferential.

The brown-robed man, his features resolute, kept his eyes fixed on the mountain. "I can't find them," he said, shaking his head. "We'll wait. In any case, the Northern Buddhists can't escape responsibility... and it's not just one of their temples."

Zhu Gong's face filled with dread. She knew this was about the Qi Wang Profound-Heaven Hearing. "What should we do?" she whispered, her voice trembling. "If it really is the Vija, how can two early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators like us possibly stand against them? If something goes wrong, the consequences will be catastrophic..."

"Them?" Daoist Master Kui Qi was far calmer, even frowning with a hint of annoyance. It was clear he held little regard for Zhu Gong and was only being civil for Daoist Master Tinglan's sake. But the situation was critical, so he maintained a patient tone. "It's not just the Vija. They couldn't have done this alone. Back when Senior Zipei seized the Metallic Essence, she took it from the hands of numerous monks, deeply offending a senior Maha named Zhelu. He's already at the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm!"

He continued, "I wasn't present at the time, so I don't know which other temples were involved. If they all act together, that's when we'll have real trouble."

Hearing this, Zhu Gong's heart sank further into despair.

'This Kui Qi may act polite,' she thought, 'but deep down, he has the same arrogance as the rest of the Supreme Yang Dao. He clearly looks down on me. Getting too close to him will lead to no good end!'

She remained wary, but her resolve to rescue Tinglan was unshaken. For now, she had no choice but to follow him.

Kui Qi, sensing her unease, said, "Don't worry too much. Now that we're here, they can't hide for long. At worst, Tinglan and Ning Wan will suffer some minor injuries. These Buddhist cultivators all have their own agendas; they won't risk an open war with our Supreme Yang Dao. Besides, those two are carrying more than enough treasures to protect themselves."

Zhu Gong let out a heavy sigh of relief. Just then, Kui Qi released the glow from his hands as if dispelling some concealment, and began performing divinations with his fingers.

But at that exact moment, the storm abruptly ceased. The sky erupted in a kaleidoscope of light, which coalesced into a colossal curtain that pressed down with overwhelming might. Daoist Master Kui Qi reacted instantly, abandoning his calculations as a bronze sword flew from his sleeve.

The sword, the color of tarnished steel and adorned with a golden tassel, shot skyward, swift as a swallow, to meet the descending light.

**BOOM!**

The collision of ebony and iridescent light lit up the heavens, shattering the surrounding storm clouds. Kui Qi's voice turned to ice. "Which Maha dares to show themselves?"

A rainbow-like blessed land materialized in the sky. Within it sat a solemn, golden-bodied figure. A black serpent was coiled around its body, and atop its shoulders sat a long, horse-like head. Its two large, round eyes were pitch-black voids. It opened its great mouth in a wide grin.

"Daoist Friend Kui Qi! I have long heard of your great name!"

The Maha was hideously ugly. While his appearance might terrify mortals, to a cultivator of the same level, it was merely grotesque. Daoist Master Kui Qi's expression grew even colder with disgust. "So, it is the Maha Taixi. Instead of staying in your wretched hole, have you come to obstruct me?"

The Maha Taixi’s smile didn't waver. "Having heard of your fame for so long, I thought we might spar. Shall we see if your Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword is sharper, or if my Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl is superior?"

As his words fell, a large, smooth-surfaced purple bowl appeared, rimmed in purplish-black. It immediately began to spew forth raging waves of karmic fire.

"Taixi!"

While Kui Qi was well-informed, Zhu Gong had spent most of her years in the Eastern Sea and was unfamiliar with these Buddhist cultivators. Only now, upon seeing the iconic artifact, did she recognize their opponent and finally piece everything together.

'So, another enemy made by Daoist Master Zipei! All those years ago on the river, she deliberately prevented them from claiming a soul's destiny, forcefully protecting that Li Xuanfeng. They lost several Master Monks and a great deal of face. This Maha has held that grudge ever since...'

'That great Daoist Master was too tyrannical in her later years, making far too many enemies. Now that she has passed on, the retribution has arrived!'

A chill ran down her spine. But she saw Kui Qi let out a cold laugh as he drew his sword, unleashing a wave of dark light. His divine ability flared in mid-air. "You dare compare that shoddy Treasured Artifact of yours to a spiritual artifact from my Xiukui Daoist tradition? Let's put it to the test!"

The Xiukui's Daoist tradition was known for its strange and unpredictable methods. Armed with multiple spiritual artifacts, Kui Qi had no fear of this newly advanced Maha. He was even confident he could injure Taixi before resuming his search for Tinglan.

He might be fearless, but Zhu Gong's scalp tingled with terror. She didn't know whether to stay or flee. Before she could decide, figures began to materialize on either side of them, wreathed in white mist. Enormous, three-headed, six-armed golden bodies with countless faces appeared one after another, their arrival heralded by the chanting of Sanskrit.

It was the host of Maha Taixi's Merciful Ones!

These Merciful Ones were not as massive as the golden body in the sky, but each had a unique expression as they emerged from the Great Void, one after another.

"One, two... four, five..."

Five Merciful Ones!

Maha Taixi had only recently advanced. These five were likely the entirety of his forces. For him to deploy all of them now spoke volumes of the hatred in his heart.

And five Merciful Ones, acting in concert, were more than enough to threaten her life.

Zhu Gong stood frozen, staring as the five figures appeared around them. Her face showed none of Kui Qi's bravado, only utter despair as a profound chill washed over her.

'It's over!'
