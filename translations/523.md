# Chapter 793: Shock

Baixiang Valley.

Tuoba Chongyuan had broken through Baixiang Valley more than half a year ago, and the surrounding regions like Qun Yuan Mountain and Nu Mountain had been plundered clean. Vast swathes had been transformed into devil cultivators' ravaged lands.

Tang Shedu was by no means incompetent. When Tuoba Chongyuan died, he received orders to march into the mountains, splitting the devil lands in two. It only took him two hours to fight his way back to Baixiang Valley.

The famed Changtian Halberd had not been used for years, but once it was unleashed, it instantly slew over ten devil cultivators. Wherever the halberd struck, death and soul annihilation followed, with no chance for escape.

Clad in radiant white armor and dripping with the blood of devil cultivators, he stood his ground, planting his halberd with overwhelming might. He felt immensely pleased with himself.

"Where is Li Xizhi..." Tang Shedu glanced at the jade slip and casually muttered, "The agreed time was within three days, yet there's no sign of him?"

Tang Shedu had only just fought his way into Baixiang Valley, and it was already the last day of the three-day deadline of the rather forced arrangement. He needed no deep thought to guess it must have been orchestrated by Chi Liangzhe and others of the Chi Family.

Although he feared Li Xuanfeng somewhat and wouldn't deliberately target the Li Family, he also wouldn't show mercy. Since Chi Liangzhe had handed him leverage, Tang Shedu naturally had his own plan.

He muttered, "If he still hasn't arrived, just note it down and send it to the main hall."

He wasn't foolish enough to play the villain himself; it was better to let the Chi and Li Families deepen their hatred. After confirming twice, a person below replied, "The Daoist arrived an hour ago and will soon pay respects to you, my lord."

Tang Shedu, still basking in the sight of fleeing devil cultivators, looked up at a sky full of fiery red clouds to the south, and grew suspicious.

He was still thinking when he saw a man in white robes approaching him. The man was composed and elegant, carrying a deep blue fan at his waist and a sword on the other side.

His complexion was slightly pale but he spoke calmly, "Greetings, senior."

Tang Shedu glanced sidelong at him, but did not question him. Instead, he turned to another subordinate, asking, "What's happening in the south?"

The subordinate answered in a low voice, "A cultivator has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm and became a Daoist Master."

"Oh?" Tang Shedu froze for a moment, but then the calm Li Xizhi spoke, his tone slightly cold yet flawless, "Reporting to you, my lord, the cultivator in question is the Daoist Master Tu Longjian of the Slaughter Jun Gate, who has achieved the Molten Fire divine ability."

Tang Shedu's figure stiffened. He stood frozen for two seconds, his voice trembling as he asked, "Tu Longjian?"

"Exactly!" Li Xizhi's cold words struck Tang Shedu's heart. He slowly turned to meet Li Xizhi's calm gaze, and his heart trembled in shock, "Tu Longjian... Tu Longjian! How could it be so fast?! How could it be so fast?!"

A shiver ran from his head to his toes. As he stared at Li Xizhi, a sudden familiarity surged up. He pictured a pair of cold, ruthless eyes, and his heart grew colder, That's right... he is the direct son of Li Yuanjiao... Tu Longjian! And Tu Longjian... killed that ruthless man... and nearly severed my own path!

How should I conduct myself now? What else can I do?

Tang Shedu had once battled fiercely with Tu Longjian. He had even mocked him openly and killed Li Yuanjiao by force. Now, when he recalled that youth‚Äôs cold gaze, he felt a chill deep in his bones.

Tang Shedu had long known the secrets of the Green Pine Temple‚Äôs Mirage Mirror Heaven. He knew that no matter how high people like Tu Longjian seemed to soar back then, they would ultimately perish, thus he had dared to offend them deeply.

Who could have expected that Tu Longjian would still manage to escape with so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators overseeing the great void! It was utterly absurd!

Tang Shedu didn‚Äôt know whether there had been some scheme among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators or if Tu Longjian had some powerful backer. He only understood that he had suddenly become expendable, and ice filled his heart.

There was no need for him to turn or use spiritual sense, he could perfectly imagine the look on Li Xizhi‚Äôs face behind him. Tang Shedu cursed inwardly, I really let my anger get the better of me when I avenged Yu Muxian... and now I've ended up in this miserable state!

Tang Shedu slowly calmed himself and quickly began planning, I must find a Purple Mansion Realm backer, or else I'll open my eyes one day and Molten Fire will already be burning at my chest!

Tang Shedu‚Äôs expression was dark as Li Xizhi watched him silently from behind. He was masking his inner turmoil, though inwardly he was overwhelmed by surging emotions.

This was the first time he had seen Tang Shedu. The memory of Li Yuanjiao dying under this man‚Äôs halberd had been etched deeply into his mind. Though he had never shown it outwardly, his hatred for Tang Shedu burned fiercely.

For now, I must bide my time... This man is not easy to deal with, and I mustn't ruin greater matters. But since he might deduce something, I must be on guard against him striking first!

The two guarded against each other. They showed no changes on the surface nor exchanged any words, yet they were both silently calculating the other's intentions.

Kuijun Mountain.

Kuijun Mountain lay at the junction between Wu and Yue States. Tongmo Prefecture, held by the Chen Family of Yuyang, lay to the north. Beyond that rose the southern foothills of Mount Dali, and it was only about five thousand kilometers from Moongaze Lake.

This area bordered the southern territories of the demonic creatures. Countless large and small demonic temples and shamanic kingdoms dotted the land further south, paying tribute to the demonic clans and serving as pasture grounds for great demonic beasts.

Kuijun Mountain had once been the stronghold of the Slaughter Jun Gate. It was originally treacherous, remote, and desolate terrain that was covered in cold iron and frigid stones, linking the shamanic kingdoms between Wu and Yue.

Now, the mountains were shrouded in hazy red mist, that glowed and drifted between the ridges. The once frigid stones had transformed into a blazing crimson, sparking showers of fire. From afar, the entire mountain range seemed wrapped in a luminous, fiery glow.

"The cultivators of the shamanic kingdoms congratulate the Daoist Master!"

Beams of dharma light soared from the red mist, halting respectfully before the mountain, filled with awe at the crimson fog. After waiting a long while, a fiery wind finally swept down from the mountain's peak.

The wind coalesced and spiraled until it formed a man in black robes. He was flanked by roaring gray-red and hazy flames that intertwined into waves of scorching winds.

He stood before the mountain and spoke loudly, "Tu Longjian greets you all!"

As soon as his voice rang out, the cultivators were struck with terror, all falling to their knees as they cried out in fear, "Daoist Master, you humble us! We dare not accept such a title!"

This Daoist Master was, of course, Tu Longjian. Despite many hardships and the destruction of his gate in his youth, he retained a youthful spirit, always addressing fellow cultivators as equals, regardless of their cultivation level.

When he was still at the Foundation Establishment Realm, Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators had merely felt uneasy at his courtesy. Now that he was a Daoist Master, none dared let him address them as peers. Pure fear filled their hearts.

The black-clad Tu Longjian gazed at the group of cultivators and said softly, "I am here to rebuild the Slaughter Jun Gate. When the devil plague swept through, our disciples fled and scattered, and their whereabouts are now unknown.

"If you encounter any Slaughter Jun Gate‚Äôs disciples or those of our Dao lineage elsewhere, please guide them back to the gate. I will surely repay your kindness!"

The crowd timidly agreed. Tu Longjian nodded and turned to head back into the mountain, leaving the cultivators dumbfounded. No one had expected that he would neither demand tribute nor speak of power consolidation. He had only made a strange request before departing.

Some among them wished to pledge allegiance to him, but none dared step into the red mist. After exchanging uneasy glances, they finally scattered like the wind.

Barely a few seconds later, a bright light appeared before the mountains and a Daoist Master manifested in the sky. It was a man with a kind, gentle appearance and willow-leaf eyes, though his voice was deep and weighty as he said, "I am Changxiao. May Fellow Daoist Tu Longjian reveal himself."

Before he was even finished, another figure appeared in the sky before the mountain. It was a woman in a simple, ancient daoist robe, holding a parasol.

She glanced coldly at Daoist Master Changxiao but then said softly, "Bi Hengxing of Hengzhu Dao Gate congratulates the Daoist Master on achieving divine ability!"
