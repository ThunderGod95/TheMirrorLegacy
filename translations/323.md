# Chapter 367: Guest from Afar

Li Jiman rode to Lijing Town on horseback but returned to Wutu City in a carriage. The Clan Affairs Courtyard's enforcer was an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. Despite Li Jiman's own cultivation, he was still flogged until his skin was torn and flesh lacerated.

Several unsmiling elders of the Clan Affairs Courtyard deliberated amongst themselves for a while before concluding with a judgment of negligence of duty and indulgence of the prominent families. Not only was Li Jiman flogged seventy times, but his reputation was also thoroughly tarnished.

The Tian Family members naturally rushed to the Clan Affairs Courtyard. Tian Zhongqing stepped forward and repeatedly apologized, and Li Jiman accepted it with a smile, but Tian Zhongqing felt a chill down his spine.

Meanwhile, even though the Clan Affairs Courtyard and Li Yuanping's central hall gave no specific instructions to his family, they still broke out in cold sweat.

As the head of the Tian Family in the eye of the storm, Tian Zhongqing felt a lump in his throat, and the joy of advancing to the Qi Cultivation Realm vanished. He drove back to Eastern Mount Yue overnight, smashing the porcelain in the courtyard in anger. He also had to stop his uncle, Tian Youdao, from slapping Tian Rong to death.

"Get out! You wretch!"

With Tian Youdao's roar, Tian Rong slunk away, clutching his swollen cheek. It was only then did Tian Zhongqing release his uncle's hand. Deep down, he did not want to stop Tian Youdao, thinking it would be better if his uncle could end Tian Rong with one slap...

When the old man's slap only made Tian Rong stagger, Tian Zhongqing knew that his uncle still cared for his only son. After finishing the act, he said in a low voice, "Uncle... what should we do now?"

Tian Youdao, an elder of the Li Family, had progressed from the Embryonic Breathing Realm to the Qi Cultivation Realm and held significant seniority in the clan. He sighed deeply and said glumly, "Li Jiman is a petty man who already held a grudge against our family in the first place. Now that this has happened, it has only deepened his grudge..."

The uncle and nephew were both Qi Cultivators and led the largest external force within the Li Family. They had always been cautious. Who could have imagined that while Tian Zhongqing was in seclusion and Tian Youdao was away, Tian Rong would cause such a disaster?

Tian Zhongqing sighed and said softly, "I clearly gave instructions. How did he manage to run off? Now Li Jiman has the support of many Mount Yue lords... If there are any changes in the future..."

Tian Youdao sat at the head, and he was now over seventy years old and well-experienced. Stroking his beard and pondering deeply, he said, "This matter is peculiar... Let me talk to the family head and clarify things. If the clan has any plans, we will cooperate accordingly!"

Since Tian Youdao was Li Xuanfeng's maternal uncle, he held significant seniority in the family, giving him the authority to speak on such matters. Seeing this, Tian Zhongqing could not help but feel a sense of relief.

Only uncle can speak like this in the clan...

"Zhongqing!" Tian Youdao called softly, and Tian Zhongqing quickly looked up. The uncle and nephew exchanged a solemn glance, and Tian Youdao said gravely, "Speaking of this... our family's current power and prestige seem to come from us breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm one after another, making the Tian Family a mainstay and earning the trust of the main family to control Mount Yue. But Zhongqing..."

He looked at his nephew and said softly, "You must understand... our family's power and prestige rest solely on me!"

Tian Zhongqing nodded heavily as he understood the gravity of his words. He had established his own family for many years. After fathering many children of his own, he had become much more mature.

He replied in a low voice, "The Ren and Dou Families are tied to the first lineage of the main family... Now that they have Lord Ximing, they eagerly follow him. The Liu Family has declined, and the Xu Family focuses solely on military loyalty, not leaning east or west, so there is nothing for them to worry about. But our Tian Family..."

Tian Youdao was Li Xuanfeng's maternal uncle, and the Tian Family had always been led by the third lineage of the main family. However, Li Xuanfeng had gone to Yi Mountain City in the southern border and had no heirs, leaving the Tian Family without support.

Li Xuanfeng said he was going to guard Yi Mountain City, but few who went there ever returned. Hence, everyone had silently assumed that he would never come back. The other prominent families were indifferent to this, but the Tian Family was secretly worried.

"Indeed..." Tian Youdao shook his head and replied, "I fear that one day if something were to happen to me, the Tian Family will be dismembered like the Liu Family."

Tian Zhongqing hesitated for a moment and asked softly, "Uncle, what do you think of the eldest son?"

Among the Xi and Yue generation of the Li Family, Li Xicheng was the eldest. Li Xizhi was the third, Li Ximing and Li Xijun were the seventh and eighth respectively, and the rest included one daughter and three sons who were all mortals and were sent down the mountain.

Li Xicheng was currently managing affairs in Mount Yue, making him the only son of the Li Family to work outside the mountain. He was from the second lineage of the main family‚ÄîLi Tongya's line.

Tian Zhongqing, who had frequent interactions with him, explained, "The eldest son is very magnanimous, generous, and kind. If the Tian Family were to marry a daughter to him as a concubine and I sincerely foster a relationship with him, aligning ourselves with the secondary lineage, we might find great support..."

"The second lineage had once declined, lacking support from the maternal family, making him an excellent choice!" Tian Youdao nodded as he took a sip of tea and replied, "Go ahead and give it a try. Establish a good relationship first. I see that he has more than enough magnanimity but lacks firmness, making him easy to rely on. If you gain his trust, the family will be secure for generations."

In the grand hall with many guards, Li Yuanping sat cross-legged in a brocade robe. The meditation cushion beneath him emitted white light, helping him concentrate and avoid distractions.

"Family Head! A letter has arrived from the western road..." a clan guard at the lower seat quietly announced, seeing that Li Yuanping was cultivating in the hall and dared not approach.

Li Yuanping had rare moments of leisure in recent days, which allowed him to cultivate. Although the gains were minimal, it was better than nothing.

"Bring it up."

Li Yuanping exhaled as he reached out to take the letter, using a specific spell to open the secret letter. He unfolded it and read, "Donghe has reached the western desert, a place called the Smoke Valley Desert. The two followers are respectful and without issue. There are many passes here and we are staying as guests at the Smoke Valley Temple under the jurisdiction of the Golden Feather Sect. The three of us will work together, and in seven years we can return with the qi."

"Excellent!"

Seeing that there was a way to collect the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi in the west, Li Yuanping was overjoyed. He looked at the small letter in his hand and asked, "Where did this come from?"
ùöèùï£ùïñùöéùö†ùöéùöãùöóùê®ùêØùïñùïù.ùïîùê®ùïû

"Reporting to Family Head, it was carried by an unrefined Qi Cultivator merchant on the road," the clan guard replied.

Li Yuanping nodded in understanding before taking a brush and wrote a large Excellent, along with some words of encouragement and language to express his gratitude. He sealed it with his own dharma seal and handed it to Dou Yi with a single command.

"Reward him with some Spirit Paddies and let him take it back."

In this world, communication was not supposed to be so troublesome. This was without mentioning ancient times where it was said that a thousand years ago, there were communication talismans and similar items. But later, for unknown reasons, these talismans either lost their effectiveness or became prohibitively expensive, and not many used them anymore.

Collecting his thoughts, Li Yuanping refocused his attention on family affairs.

"Mount Yue is easy to handle."

A few days ago, Li Yuanjiao mentioned this matter and had discussed it in detail with Li Yuanping before returning to the mountain for cultivation. Now, Li Yuanping focused his concentration on figuring out how to solve these two issues.

Li Yuanping had long been dissatisfied with Mount Yue and had secretly made arrangements. However, he found that dealing with the clan's many disciples was a headache.

"If it really comes to what Big Brother said... where would we find another place..."

Li Yuanping sorted the letters on the table, gathering intelligence from nearby families.

The Yu Family had been quiet recently. Yu Mugao was busy organizing the clan, killing some members some days and releasing others the next. Despite the numerous brothers, they could not fight back at all and were slaughtered like lambs daily.

"He really dares to kill..." Li Yuanping mumbled as he looked at the list of names and pursed his lips. He thought to himself and concluded that although Yu Mugao enjoyed the killing, he had left behind many hidden dangers. Shaking his head, he turned his attention back to the families on the eastern shore.

There were more than a dozen families scattered along the eastern shore, though most were small families at the Embryonic Breathing or Qi Cultivation Realms. The situation was quite complex with many entanglements, so few people dared to interfere.

Both the northern and eastern shores of Moongaze Lake used to be the territory of the Golden Tang Gate, and the eastern shore families had numerous connections with the Golden Tang Gate. Although the gate had weakened and lost this territory, some relationships remained. This was one factor.

Another factor was that the eastern shore families held several valuable ore veins and spirit springs, and all were secretly controlled by the Xiao Family from the west. Xiao Family members guarded these places under the guise of guest cultivators, enabling them the power to maintain the situation while profiting from it.

This arrangement should not have been allowed, but the Azure Pond Sect had turned a blind eye to this. The Xiao Family preferred to see the situation fragmented, and so this arrangement remained for years.

Moreover, Moongaze Lake bordered the Xiao Family's territory. These families maintained the buffer zone, bordering the Golden Tang Gate to the north and the Li and Ding families to the south. The competition among various forces made the area highly sensitive.

These factors combined to maintain the status quo among the eastern shore families, with no significant changes for a hundred years. When the Jiang Family prospered, they supported them; and when the Yu Family dominated, they supported them. Now, with the Yu Family's decline and a tripartite power structure on the lake, each family sought its own protector.

Back when the market collapsed and the Yu Family declined, our family had the opportunity to take over some tributary families. However, we were understaffed at the time and only wanted to bide our time, so we missed our chance.

Li Yuanping thought for a moment, his heart stirring with ambition. He thought to himself, Now that our family's finances are tight, if we could intervene... we could gain some tributes and support some forces on the eastern shore...

While considering the feasibility of this idea, he called to Dou Yi at the lower seat.

"Go to the Clan Affairs Courtyard and get me a report on the eastern shore families."

Dou Yi quickly nodded and hurried off. Unexpectedly, another person ran up from below and said respectfully, "Reporting to Family Head! There is a cultivator seeking an audience on the road!"

"A cultivator on the road..?"

Li Yuanping was slightly taken aback. Knowing that anyone who was reported up to the hall must not be any simple or trivial matter, he took this seriously. "What is their cultivation level? Are they seeking something?" he asked.

The clan guard hesitated and answered, "According to Master An, the person is likely not a Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivator. They wear a robe with cuffed sleeves and appear youthful. I heard that their aura far surpasses the Foundation Establishment Realm... As for their business here, they insist on seeing you personally."

An Zheyan had seen powerful figures like Yu Xiaogui and Li Tongya in the past and could roughly estimate the strength of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Hearing that this person far surpassed the Foundation Establishment Realm made Li Yuanping's expression fall solemn.

"Not a Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivator!? Seeking my presence?" Li Yuanping was momentarily stunned and then said sternly, "Go and inform Brother Jiao, but... no need to have him come over. Let him keep watch on the mountain... Have Master An and others ready to suppress this person in case they suddenly act up."

Li Yuanping's face looked somewhat grim. He always despised unexpected troubles, especially when the other party, despite politely visiting, had a cultivation far beyond the Foundation Establishment Realm. If they caused trouble, the Li Family could not handle it.

"Damn it!" he cursed in frustration, then exhaled and said softly, "Escort him to the side hall to wait."

"Yes!" Dou Yi responded as the others quickly retreated.

Li Yuanping sat back on the main seat, thinking to himself, Though he doesn't look like a Buddhist cultivator, he might be disguising himself... Maybe he's a devil cultivator... Our family has never encountered a devil cultivator from Jiangnan, but we've heard they look no different from ordinary people. We might not be able to recognize them.

He took two steps down the stairs. After all, it was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator visiting. In the Li Family, only he had enough weight to handle this, without risking too much loss if things went awry.

"This is not the time to show weakness... It would be bad if he became suspicious. I should go meet him," Li Yuanping mumbled to himself quietly as he walked to the front of the hall and stepped lightly toward the corridor. As he walked, he saw Li Wen following him, carrying a mace as big as a human head without saying a word.

Seeing Li Wen's immense figure, Li Yuanping felt a bit more confident and smiled.

"What a sturdy fellow you are!" he remarked.

"Hehe," Li Wen chuckled in response.

When Li Yuanping reached the side hall, he said gently, "You do not need to come in. Just wait outside."

After all, the gap between Foundation Establishment Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm was too vast. According to An Zheyan's description, if Li Wen went in, it would only take one palm strike from the visitor to send him flying, which would make them seem weak.

Seeing Li Wen nod dumbly, Li Yuanping pushed the door open and entered.

The side courtyard was simple and unadorned, with only a few wooden tables. Sitting by one small table was a young man with an ordinary face and a daoist crown on his head. A wooden sword rested on his knees, which appeared to be made of peach wood.

He looked to be only about twenty years old, wearing a plain Daoist robe with golden embroidery on the cuffs of an unknown origin. The peach wood sword seemed ordinary and dull, not like any precious treasure.

A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator at twenty years old?

Li Yuanping secretly assumed that this person must be using an illusion to disguise his appearance, becoming even more cautious.

"The Li Family welcomes you, Senior... May I ask how to address you?" Li Yuanping stepped forward with a smile, speaking politely yet confidently.

"Greetings, Family Head! I am Wang Xun from Yinghua Prefecture in Zhao State! Thank you for your hospitality!"

Unexpectedly, the young cultivator reacted with great enthusiasm, jumping up from his seat almost right away. The peach wood sword on his knees flipped in the air and floated lightly. Wang Xun, seemingly unaware, had responded courteously.

Seeing his response and demeanor, Li Yuanping felt slightly relieved. He glanced unobtrusively at the peach wood sword and smiled as he said, "Oh, a guest from Zhao State! I am Li Yuanping... Apologies for keeping you waiting."

"No need for apologies!" The man smiled in return. Seeing Li Yuanping not taking the main seat but instead choosing to sit to the side, Wang Xun's tense expression relaxed, and he also sat down.

Watching the young man's sincere reactions, Li Yuanping felt even more at ease and called out, "Serve the tea!"

The attendants quickly brought the tea, placed it before them, and left hurriedly. Li Yuanping smiled, observing the shy and bashful young man in front of him while still on guard. "May I ask, Senior... Where do you come from? Is there anything you need? If my family can help, we will certainly do so."

The young man seemed unaccustomed to worldly interactions and had not mentioned his background. Li Yuanping asked about his background to gauge if he belonged to a significant sect or family, which would inform his response.

Still smiling courteously, he poured tea from a jade pot.

The young man hesitated, nodding repeatedly, as though he had already expected to be asked about his family lineage. I come from the Wang Family in Yinghua, a great-grandson of True Monarch Xiaojin and the son of Daoist Master Yingyuan..." he replied hurriedly.

"Wow..."

Li Yuanping felt as if he had been slapped out of nowhere, and his head buzzed. His steady hand suddenly shook, spilling several drops of tea.

"True Monarch Xiaojin! A Golden Core Realm cultivator!" he exclaimed.

He looked up in shock and stammered, "Senior... you say you are the great-grandson of a True Monarch and the son of a Daoist Master?!"
