# Chapter 1132: Cultivation

"Oh..."

Li Ximing's heart jolted. Only after he had drained three cups did the woman before him finally relent. She set down the long-necked jade pot, glanced at him, and smiled.

"How is the taste?"

The Daoist Master let out a breath.

"The flavor isn't strong, but its potency is fierce."

Kuang Yu sat down beside him and smiled again.

"It was originally a spiritual resource, meant to blur the mind and make one forget their worries. It isn't truly wine, which is why it's refined rather than brewed. In the past, cultivators of Azure Profoundity were quite fond of this drink. A lesser cultivator need only drink a single cup and they'd collapse on the spot, drifting, with no idea of what year or month they might awaken."

Li Ximing took another drink, feeling a majestic dharma power rapidly mobilizing his divine ability. He closed his eyes slightly and smiled.

"Fellow Daoist Yin, you have something on your mind. Why not speak of it?"

Kuang Yu tugged at her sleeves. The color in her eyes gradually faded, replaced by a touch of resolve.

She smiled, "Fellow Daoist, do you understand... the full history of the Cultivation Transcendence dao?"

Li Ximing sipped his wine.

"I ask for your guidance."

The woman rose from her position. With her hands clasped behind her back, she began to pace.

"Those of Cultivation Transcendence were originally called 'Zhibei'. They are tied to the heavenly Xingbo star, which is born when the stellar order falls into disarray. Those in the world who follow this path change at the boundary of yin and yang. This dao thrives on perversity and incitement. Whenever there is a change of dynasty, a popular revolt, or the slaying of a general, this star will invariably shine."

Li Ximing looked thoughtful. The woman continued in a low voice,

"Before the ancient Zhou, there was another dynasty named Xia. They used wind and thunder as their totem and belonged to the Thunder Palace above. When the Xia collapsed, the Zhou rose, and the states fell into conflict. With the Thunder Palace fallen, this dao found its place in the chaotic world. It was unruly and wild, spreading wide among the common people. Cultivators of this path sowed discord between the states, shaking the world, and used the chaos to ascend."

"But at the time, the ancient cultivators all considered this dao inauspicious, finding it too steeped in warfare. They followed other paths, such as those aligned with Manifestations Earth, refusing to seek the orthodox way, and so the Zhibei dao gradually withered. This continued until its True Monarch was besieged and abruptly fell. In that same year, the Zhou Emperor obtained the Upper Rite, and with it, a third True Monarch. He then established the formal rites and etiquette, enfeoffing the lands, and the chaotic age finally came to an end."

Though she hadn't said it outright, the implication was clear. Li Ximing, holding his cup, felt a flash of clarity.

"So it was the Upper Rite."

Kuang Yu knew he understood.

"Precisely. Back then, the Upper Rite was the bane of Zhibei. But just as that dao declined to its absolute nadir, a True Monarch from an Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition unexpectedly claimed it first. His title was Zhidu, the Crossing Holder. He cultivated neither Zhibei nor the Five Elements, but Yin and Yang. He used a Quest for Gold method that the world could not comprehend to attain the Dao, calling it 'Holding Yang to Cross Yin'. Thus, he achieved 'Yue', or Transcendence."

"From that point on, the dao gradually grew docile and was assimilated into the Immortal Dao. Its name was changed to Cultivation Transcendence, and its relationship with the Upper Rite became far more manageable. This True Monarch lived in deep seclusion; it was only heard that he rebuilt the Green Pine Temple. As for what year he fell... that is lost to time."

At this, she raised her eyebrows, a speculative look in her eyes, and said softly,

"This True Monarch... Fellow Daoist should not be unfamiliar with him, I think."

Li Ximing frowned and shook his head.

Kuang Yu hesitated for a moment before replying,

"He... is the earliest traceable ancestor of the Immortal Mansion lineage. And I fear that today's King Wei has a very deep connection to him as well!"

Li Ximing's heart suddenly clenched.

"What makes you say that?"

Kuang Yu spoke in that same low, haunting tone.

"I once heard a legend. It's said that this True Monarch was cultivating within Green Pine Temple when a disciple returned from his travels to report, saying, 'Master, today the world is in disharmony, yin and yang are imbalanced, and the Great Dao is in chaos. Our dao exists to balance yin and yang; we should make a plan.'"

"The True Monarch replied, 'This Venerable One passed Mount Xiao last year and saw an illustrious aura like a canopy, with auspicious qi circling. An emperor is soon to appearâ€”a king of Bright Yang.'"

"The disciple pleaded for a method to balance yin and yang, but the True Monarch remained silent for a long time, pinching his fingers in calculation. The disciples kowtowed and begged for several days. Finally, the True Monarch drew a treasure from his sleeve. He studied it over and over, lamenting, 'A pitiable thing from the ancestors, soon to be lost among the common folk.' He then lightly tossed it down the mountain, where it vanished into the endless sea. Only then did he speak again."

"'The Bright Yang Imperial Monarch will be executed by it.'"

A chill shot straight to Li Ximing's mind. He stood up, incredulous.

"Azure Profoundity? How is that possible?"

Kuang Yu's expression turned mournful.

"The legend is widespread. Even though my family is of the Wei royal line, I heard it clearly. It's just that no one would believe it, and no one knew what the treasure was. In fact, this treasure was once obtained by the Wei Emperor and suppressed within the palace. Then, when Wei was destroyed, it was lost among the common people, only to eventually find its way back into the hands of Azure Profoundity."

But the man before her couldn't take in her words. The destruction of Wei... every single detail pointed to Comprehending Profoundity. How could Li Ximing possibly believe an Azure Profoundity cultivator was responsible? He was silent for a long time, but the woman gave him no respite. She took a step forward, staring into his eyes.

"But Mount Qusi has a record of this treasure. Fellow Daoist, do you know what it is?"

Li Ximing hesitantly shook his head.

She said, "The Sun Seeker Ring."

The Daoist Master's pupils dilated. He stared fixedly at her, his mind reeling.

'The Sun Seeker Ring... how could it be the Sun Seeker Ring? That item was obtained by my own family... though I was in seclusion at the time...'

His mind felt like it was collapsing. He suddenly recalled her words about a deep connection to Li Zhouwei, and the face of Li Xijun surfaced in his memory:

'When that Sun Seeker Ring saw the Immortal Artifact, its brilliance was infinite, like the sun scorching the earth! Ten thousand rays of light, endless yellow sand, orioles singing and deer calling, green mountains and trees bursting with life... It was as if Bright Yang itself had descended!'

'When I was condensing my immortal foundation, I saw many illusions of golden light, and the foundation condensed on its own, tens of times faster than my own efforts...'

'And the words written on that Sun Seeker Ring... "Green Pine Temple, Lu Jiangxian"...'

Li Ximing raised his head, his voice low.

"The Wei Emperor has not yet fallen."

"He has not."

"So the prophecy wasn't for the year Wei was destroyed. It was for the near future..."

The woman poured more wine, her expression somber.

"Correct. My family elder believes that the fall of Wei was indeed the work of Comprehending Profoundity, just as that True Monarch had long predicted. The Sun Seeker Ring can guide the favor of Bright Yang and give birth to the Mandate of Heaven. The line, 'The Bright Yang Imperial Monarch will be executed by it'... refers to the current King Wei."

"The one who will truly execute Him can only be King Wei."

Li Ximing's brow was furrowed in deep thought.

"I see... So the Sun Seeker Ring was always destined to fall into my family's hands. Only with it could King Wei come to be. The world's situation isn't a simple collision between Bright Yang and True Qi. It was meticulously arranged, layer upon layer, to ensure they would collide."

"The Underworld needs to shatter the order in Jiangbei and the north to re-establish True Qi. Meanwhile, Bright Yang's ascension to the Dao was the key to convincing Luoxia to yield its order... Both sides got what they needed. It's all interconnected."

He clutched his cup, silent for a long moment, his thoughts elsewhere. He muttered,

"There was no accident... Given the thinness of my family's ancestral bloodline, how could we possibly have produced a son of Bright Yang like Zhouwei without the Sun Seeker Ring? My family's entire purpose... was to raise him."

Kuang Yu sipped her wine, waiting for him to process the implications. When he fell silent, she spoke again.

"Cultivation Transcendence has been proven once more, by the current one who achieved the Dao when Liang was destroyed. Which path he walks, I need not say."

Ancient cultivators could be named freely, but it was inconvenient to speak of modern ones. Kuang Yu pursed her lips, watching him.

Li Ximing sighed softly. How could he not understand?

"You mean... the current situation with King Wei is highly beneficial to you."

Kuang Yu stared at him, her gaze unflinching.

"Yes. And not just me."

"The manifestations of Cultivation Transcendence are complex, its dao lineage obscure. Even a direct disciple of Lord Yingze had to rely on the fall of Liang to achieve the Dao. Although my own lineage possesses four nearly complete divine ability lineages, we have no True Monarch from the Yue Cultivating Sect to transmit the dharma. If I don't seize this opportunity, I will likely never master more than a few divine abilities in my lifetime, let alone step past the threshold of Purple Mystery!"

Her eyes were steel.

"My brother, currently in seclusion breaking through... is also cultivating Cultivation Transcendence! This matter benefits more than just me. Cultivators of this path are vital aides, extremely beneficial for The Recent Usurpation!"

Li Ximing fell silent for a long time. He realized that the Daoist Master from Qusi had laid more than one stone. While fulfilling his own desire for seeking the Dao, he had not neglected Qusi. If he could nurture two mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivatorsâ€”perhaps even two with the potential to reach Purple Mystery... With Daoist Master Liaoluo to guide the transition, both Mount Qusi and the Yin family would be secure for five hundred years.

He silently poured the last of the wine from the jade pot, filling a single cup.

"And what can I do to help you, Fellow Daoist?"

He saw the woman's hand, which she had held behind her back for so long, finally move. A jade talisman from her sleeve was extended toward him. Her fingers released it, and it landed on the table with a soft click.

Li Ximing gently picked it up. His hand suddenly clenched tight. As his spiritual sense flowed into it, a majestic torrent of information flooded his mind, coalescing into several large characters.

[Yin-Yang Mutual Refinement and Conjunction Method].

He froze, his brows shooting up.

Kuang Yu pursed her lips and suddenly leaned in, her face extremely close to his. He could see the blue-purple reflection in her pupils and smell a faint, clean fragrance.

She gritted her teeth.

"I need to borrow your manifestation."

The words exploded in his mind, and all the preceding information snapped into place. Li Ximing's emotions became instantly complex as he stared blankly at the Daoist Master before him.

'So that's the "borrowing" she meant... the dao of yin-yang conjunction...'

Li Ximing was not at all unfamiliar with this. His own earliest cultivation had been partially based on this very principle. But as his cultivation advanced, the Li family of that time could not find a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to practice with him. After he reached the Purple Mansion Realm, it became even more impossible.

Although the Bright Yang path had this benefit, he had long since cast it from his mind. As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had passed through countless illusions, he had abandoned such desires long ago. From start to finish, he'd held no improper thoughts toward Kuang Yu.

He remained frozen. Kuang Yu's eyes, though clear, now held a trace of confusion.

The atmosphere in the cave dwelling grew taut. Yin Xinyu seemed to misunderstand his hesitation, and her face paled slightly. Just as she was about to speak, the man before her picked the jade talisman back up, pressed it into her hand, and smiled.

"We are simply two people, each taking what we need. That is all."

Kuang Yu gave a curt nod, her expression still strained, but the tension in her brow visibly eased. She turned away on her toes, still avoiding his gaze, as she heard Li Ximing say with a light laugh,

"It is merely cultivation. Why hesitate? It makes me seem ungracious."

His words clearly defused her anxiety. Kuang Yu spun back around, gritting her teeth.

"You think this is easy for me? I have no idea what you're thinking. I've always heard how well you get on with this person or that one. Tinglan praises you constantly. If you favor someone else and hold reservations, and I just bluntly propose this, wouldn't I be humiliating myself? Matters of the dao cannot be spoken of lightly. If word got out and was twisted, I couldn't explain the truth even if I had a thousand mouths."

Li Ximing just shook his head.

"No wonder you brought up all that talk about Purple Yin."

Kuang Yu was already mortified. Hearing him mention it again, she snatched the jade talisman and tossed it at his chest.

"Just focus on your own cultivation!"

Li Ximing laughed, catching it easily. He raised the wine pot, filled both jade cups to the brim, and held his aloft, his eyes bright.

"Let's dispense with the pleasantries. After this cup, you owe me no favor, and I owe you no debt. We each walk our own path. This is for cultivation, and nothing more."

Kuang Yu stared at him, her expression complicated. The smile faded from her face, replaced by a solemn gravity. She raised her cup.

"Many thanks, Fellow Daoist."

Their eyes met. They drank together and fell into a long silence. Li Ximing, possessing the Life Divine Ability, processed the potent drink almost instantly. Only now did he begin to feel a slight warmth spreading through him. He smiled.

"I originally came to ask you for Pristine Water. I nearly forgot my purpose!"

Kuang Yu listened carefully to his intended use, then immediately retrieved a jade box from her sleeve. It was shrouded in a mystical white mist.

"This is Tangyi Pristine Water," she said softly. "It was a precious gift from Sister Hengxing when I achieved the Dao. Take it and use it as you need. Just be warned, this item must not go near fire. You must be careful to contain it. If you let it escape... it will be nearly impossible to find again."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly as he accepted it.

"Many thanks, Fellow Daoist."

"Such needless courtesy."

The spiritual drink's effects were not overwhelming, and Kuang Yu had already regained her composure. She escorted him to the main hall. Outside, the heavy rain continued to fall. She heard the man say politely,

"I will study this carefully. I shall return in three months."

"Oh, right."

Kuang Yu shut the hall door and hurried back to her cave dwelling. She pushed open the stone door and walked to the innermost chamber as the dharma lamps extinguished one by one behind her. She lay down on the couch, silently staring at the faint glint of light on the bed's edge.

After an unknown time, she suddenly sat up. She gazed at her pale, smooth face in the mirror, her expression calm.

"It's not so bad."

...

The rain pattered down. Li Ximing took a few steps on the stairs outside the hall, his mind churning.

'Diyan once mentioned that Kuang Yu is a key figure in the Qusi Daoist tradition Tradition... That means he intends to protect her. The implications of Yin Juexi cultivating Cultivation Transcendence are completely different from Kuang Yu cultivating it...'

'Yin Juexi is cultivating it to leverage the authority under Zhouwei, both to rapidly increase his own strength and to be useful to Zhouwei. That Great Daoist Master doesn't care if Yin Juexi survives the process. But Kuang Yu... she is the true pillar he left for the Yin family. This allows her to pursue the greatest benefits... while maintaining a clear separation from Ting Province.'

Every family had its own calculations. Li Ximing didn't find this offensive; in fact, seeing this clearly was what led to their agreement. Still, as he sorted through the schemes, his mind was turbulent. He stood for a moment with his hands behind his back, gazing at the downpour.

'Dao Mian's pill requires both Pristine Water and Mansion Water water. This is perfect. I can use the Vast Lake Array-Furnace from the Mansion Water Pill Formation Technique at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. I'll spend some time there to begin refining the pill, and I can stop back at Xinyu on the way.'

Just then, a happy voice called out.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

He saw a woman bowing at the foot of the steps. She was dressed in white, with a round, pleasant face. She wore no bright cosmetics, only a simple hairpin, yet she carried an air that was at once majestic and gentle. Li Ximing smiled in approval.

"Queyi, you carry yourself better and better!"

Li Queyi smiled politely, straightening up.

"Junior is running about on the seas all year and cannot serve the clan. I am deeply ashamed."

"Nonsense." Li Ximing waved his hand. "I hear you send things home every year and even consult with your brother Jiangzong on matters of trade. Having the heart to do so is more than enough. It's far better than some who stay in Jiangnan and don't return for a decade or more."

As one of the pair of treasured daughters who had left Moongaze Lake together, it was obvious that seeing Li Queyi made Li Ximing think of Li Quexi. His faint smile sent a chill down Li Queyi's back, and she bowed her head.

"Quexi is a Purple Smoke cultivator and a personal disciple; she must be terribly busy... I've heard... she also sends letters home often..."

After decades of trials overseas, Li Queyi had been completely transformed. She was decisive and capable. Perhaps as a young girl she had envied Li Quexi, but now that feeling had faded into simple melancholy. She still held out hope that her younger sister would align with Ting Province.

Li Ximing waved his hand, signaling that the topic was closed. He took a step, hands behind his back.

"I heard some days ago that nearly half of Jianghuai has been reclaimed and they need someone to assume the role of Holder of the Profound. How will Sima Xunhai reply?"

Li Queyi chose her words carefully.

"My husband declined the position and yielded it to the Chen Clan."

This was common knowledge. Chen Yin was the most desperate at the moment and had surely offered significant concessions. But even if he failed this time, the position would likely fall to Sima Xunhai next. Li Ximing changed the subject.

"Is Sima Xunhai good to you? Is there any trouble on the island? If a woman of our family is being bullied, I won't spare him."

A flash of gratitude crossed Li Queyi's face.

"My husband has been devoted and single-minded for many years, and he treats me exceptionally well. As for the island... there is occasional turmoil in the earth veins, sometimes quite intense. He always has to break seclusion to manage it, but the rest of the time, it is very stable."

Li Ximing finally relaxed and nodded. His form dissolved into light and traversed the Great Void, leaving the area. As he flew east over the vast sea, his expression slowly grew pensive.

'This issue with the earth veins on Xinyu isn't new. Tinglan has mentioned it several times... something about a cultivator breaking through... and talk of She Immortals.'

At that thought, he abruptly stopped. He looked down at the ocean, considered for a moment, and then his light plunged into the water.

The spiritual qi in this part of the sea was not abundant; most of it was concentrated on the island itself. In moments, he reached the seabed. Li Ximing scanned the area, then activated the Light of the Six Harmonies and performed a quick calculation. He found nothing out of the ordinary.

But it was this very result that put his casual mind on high alert.

'She just said there was turmoil in the earth veins. There should at least be a trace of Baleful Earth qi or leaking earth fire. How could it be completely normal? "Completely normal" is the greatest anomaly!'

He maintained a casual expression, shaking his head with a small laugh, but his spiritual sense flared.

'Spirit Probe!'

His vision instantly expanded. Layers upon layers of rock and sediment dissolved before his eyes. A massive formation base, glowing with purple light, flickered into view and then vanished as his senses pushed deeper.

But beneath that shimmering purple formation, there was an empty void of pure radiance.

At the base of this great array, there were no earth veins, no baleful fire. There was only another void, vast as a separate world, and within this endless radiance floated a single speck of colored light.

As his gaze fixed on that radiance, Li Ximing felt as if he were staring into roiling, endless lava. He could see nothing _but_ the light. A cool sensation surged from his Shengyang Acupoint, driving back the overwhelming pressure. The prickling numbness faded, allowing him to finally see the speck of light clearly.

The light was bizarre, a deep brownish-yellow, like a flame shining through a pinprick. It blurred at the edges, but the center was impossibly bright, illuminating a kaleidoscope of images.

At times, it showed earth and stone warping, baleful magnetism separating. At others, it showed the five colors layering and combining to form gods. He saw myriad ghosts and deities, wielding blades and halberds, their faces infinitely fierce. He saw Monarchs and kings offering sacrifices, slaughtering oxen and sheep, as heaven and earth became one...

This single point of light seemed as vast as the cosmos and as fine as a mote of dust. Vaguely, he could perceive countless divine beings suppressed beneath it, all in a posture of holding it aloft, their eyes crackling with lightning, their immortal might overwhelming.

It was this seemingly ordinary, palm-sized speck of light that sent a cataclysmic shock through Li Ximing's heart, forcing his mind blank.

His heart felt as if it had been seized by an unprecedented, violent impulse.

'This...'

A boundless, overwhelming wave of desire and awe rose from that mental void. An instant stretched into eternity. He saw the sun and moon fall, mountains and seas invert. An infinite, forgotten past seemed to stream past him, tumbling into the pitch-black Great Void.

The urge to _possess_ it was catastrophic, transcending all other desires. It converged in his mind, an instinct that needed no name or comparison. It was the cat seeing the tiger, the serpent meeting the dragon.

All these urges solidified into a single, blazing thought.

'Metallic Essence.'

'Manifestations Earth Metallic Essence.'

The ever-shifting light seemed to speak, pouring the unadulterated Great Dao into his mind, whispering the secrets of the cosmos.

'Seize it... You can be reincarnated... You can be invincible... You can dominate all living beings... You can establish new gods...'

But all he felt was an icy chill flooding the back of his neck.

'What "cultivator breakthrough"? What "earth vein trembling"? All of it... it's all because there is a Metallic Essence hidden here! A Metallic Essence potent enough to drive every Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in the world into a frenzy!'

'Whose Metallic Essence is this? It's so terrifying that an entire formation was needed to seal it away! All those Great Daoist Masters from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... could not a single one of them make use of it? And what is its relationship to the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition itself?!'

Yet, the cooling sensation in his Shengyang Acupoint, which had swelled from a trickle to a roaring river, kept his expression and actions perfectly neutral. He feigned a dismissive laugh, shook his head, and stepped back into the Great Void.

'Most importantly... this isn't just any essence. It's _Manifestations Earth_! It is the "She" Earth, the Altar Earth, one of the two ancient Sheji earths. The Altar Earth that almost no one in modern times dares to cultivate... Such audacity! Such terrifying power!'

He emerged from the Great Void, not knowing how far he had traveled, and flew east. After what felt like thousands of li, a chain of islands appeared on the ocean's surface. Their shapes were rugged and irregular, and cultivators could be seen flying to and fro.

This was the Deer Weeds Island, the location of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion.

But by now, there was not a shred of calm left in the Daoist Master's heart. He was utterly horrified.

'No wonder... no wonder...'

This was the first time Li Ximing had ever witnessed such a thing. Setting aside the rational temptation of a Metallic Essence, the mere act of _looking_ at it felt like staring directly into the boundless secrets of the cosmos, witnessing an infinity of Quest for Gold methods all at once.

'No wonder back in Anhuai Heaven, the instant a Metallic Essence appeared, all the assembled immortals, demons, and Maha lost their composure. They abandoned their factions and distinctions, fleeing recklessly into the grotto-heaven... Metallic Essence... _this_ is Metallic Essence...'

Excluding those of the Demon attribute, Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had all passed the trial of boundless illusions. Their mental fortitude was extraordinary. And yet, even they would be driven to such impulsive madness.

'If this Manifestations Earth Metallic Essence were to fall openly into the mortal worldâ€”I fear it could instantly refine an entire divine domain or immortal kingdom on the spot!'
