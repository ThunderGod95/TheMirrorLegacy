# Chapter 1104: Breaking the Siege

When Li Muyan heard this, he merely pressed his hand to his sleeve and fell silent, visibly hesitant. But then, a divine ability flared, capped with purple light. It enveloped Li Muyan, pulling him back as a low voice urged,

"Let's go... let's go. It's time to leave!"

The arrival of Hongyan was what finally made Li Muyan move. He realized this Daoist Master from the Ni family was covered in cold sweat, truly desperate to end the confrontation. By speaking first, Hongyan had shouldered half the blame for ordering a retreat. Li Muyan said nothing more, turning to depart with him.

Li Ximing simply maintained his divine ability, holding his ground in a silent standoff.

In the mortal realm, the armies began a near-simultaneous retreat to the west. Western Shu had a great number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and even with their morale broken, their hasty withdrawal was as stable as a mountain.

Hongyan and Li Muyan had just crossed the Western Mountains when a cultivator in blue-gray robes approached them on the wind. He cupped his hands in salute and said,

"I was sent on orders to receive you both!"

This was Daoist Master Guanlan, Qing Zhuo, a new-generation Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Qing family. He had possessed two divine abilities for some time, and his spiritual essence now radiated, his aura full. Clearly, his third divine ability was on the verge of completion. The Qing family had been reluctant to let him see battle. He was, Hongyan noted, far more approachable than Qing Jifang.

Hongyan gave a bitter smile.

"Retreating without orders was my counsel. It was not Li Muyan's decision alone."

Li Muyan remained silent, a desolate look on his face as he secretly clutched the jade talisman in his sleeve.

Qing Zhuo simply waved his hand in a dismissive bow.

"The two of you are overthinking. I was, in fact, sent to ask you to withdraw your forces."

This made Li Muyan raise his eyebrows in surprise. Qing Zhuo sighed.

"King Wei slew Vast Cicada at Baixiang. The Zhao army has suffered a massive defeat!"

Understanding dawned instantly in Li Muyan's mind. Hongyan, however, was stunned.

"I saw the white sands churning in the north and a multicolored light that reached the heavens. I knew someone had taken a heavy loss, but I never imagined it was Li Jieyi—a pity, I heard his Dharma Body was stolen from the Golden Land, so the loss isn't truly disastrous for him."

Qing Zhuo stared at him.

"Vast Cicada is dead."

The emphasis in that statement made both Li Muyan's and Hongyan's expressions change. They fell into a stunned silence. After a long moment, Li Muyan muttered,

"That Exiled Qi is truly formidable."

Qing Zhuo's lips twitched, but he offered no reply. It was the exact same thing Qing Jifang had said.

Within the Qing family, Qing Zhuo was known as a reasonable and generous figure. He understood the situation at Baixiang in detail, but he hadn't dared say much in front of Qing Jifang. He had no such reservations with Li Muyan, however, and replied tactfully,

"The Exiled Qi is formidable, to be sure. But King Wei perceived the true nature of Bright Yang within three moves. His Dao-Profundity has reached a level beyond the mundane, far beyond what ordinary people can comprehend."

His words made Hongyan turn his head, his expression fraught with worry, which quickly curdled into resentment. Li Muyan was still clutching that jade talisman from Qing Jifang. He could have still caused a great deal of trouble. If Hongyan hadn't intervened, they would have forged a much deeper enmity.

'Qing Jifang... so arrogant. His actions are utterly shameless... Even Li Muyan was having second thoughts... We may not have powerful backgrounds, but we are still Purple Mansion Realm masters! We are pieces on the board... If one day, in the middle of a great battle, we were to slack off, or intentionally hold back... could Qing Jifang truly execute us for it?!'

His line of thinking was correct. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was not some nameless soldier. A True Monarch would not personally intervene to punish them. If the Ni family's territory were to be conquered by the Song court, Hongyan would not hesitate for a second to change his allegiance.

The Daoist Master's gaze grew increasingly gloomy.

'I can only hope Qing Zhuo breaks through soon and can bring over some of his own people. I refuse to stay under Qing Jifang for a single day longer!'

---

...The Great Void.

The Shu army had retreated, but Li Ximing did not relax his guard. He silently maintained his divine ability, his spiritual sense already reaching out to the Immortal Mirror. The power of Spirit Probe swept across the Great Void as he pondered.

Li Ximing was, of course, aware that Li Muyan had been clutching something in his sleeve. His claim that Li Zhouwei was about to arrive had been a bluff... If a true fight had broken out, it was uncertain whether Shu or Song would have benefited, but it certainly would not have been either of the Li families.

'Li Muyan's retreat was within my expectations...'

Just as he was mulling this over, the woman in purple robes descended on a cloud. Daoist Master Wenqing, the graceful Ziyu longsword strapped to her back, bowed at his side.

"Many thanks, Senior! And congratulations!"

Her expression was one of clear envy.

"After so many years... the title 'family of Sword Immortals' is finally truly deserved!"

"Daoist Master, you exaggerate!"

Daoist Master Wenqing's beauty was considerable, enhanced further by her divine ability. Even now, slightly disheveled from battle, she was as ethereal as a fairy. Li Ximing smiled and quickly returned her bow.

"Is there any news from the west?"

Daoist Master Wenqing replied, "I heard the Great General had to use several treasures, but he held the line by himself. It was a difficult fight, but with Qinghu and Cheng Qian supporting him, nothing will go wrong!"

She could see Li Ximing was distracted and understood that the west bank of Moongaze Lake had just been ravaged. There was much to be done. With considerable tact, she offered,

"I will stand guard at the Western Mountains!"

"Good!"

Li Ximing didn't stand on ceremony. With a single step, he crossed into the mortal realm. His eyes immediately fell on Li Jiangchun, whose own were shut tight, a sword-shaped mark flickering faintly on his brow. With a wave of his sleeve, the Light of the Six Harmonies veiled them, pulling the young man behind him.

He studied him closely, his gaze fixed on that sword mark. He was silent for a long moment, visibly processing something. A look of sudden, shocking realization filled his eyes.

Yet the Daoist Master said nothing. He simply formed a hand seal, and light gathered at his fingertips, scattering downward like rain.

It was 'World's Radiance'!

The Light of the Six Harmonies from 'World's Radiance' was intrinsically tied to his authority, making it difficult to constrain by normal range. The moment Li Ximing took control of the west bank, his divine ability mirrored his authority, and he unleashed it with full power!

All the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators on the west bank froze. A brilliant radiance surged from within their qi seas, mending their wounds. Those with lighter injuries, like Li Minggong and Nantanchen, saw their complexions immediately improve. Those more severely wounded, like Ding Weizeng and Qu Bushi, instantly regenerated severed limbs, their faces flushing with renewed vitality!

This Bright Yang divine ability was incredibly domineering. Li Ximing stood within the mortal realm, his expression impassive, having already restored nearly every Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to combat readiness. Aside from those like Ding Weizeng, whose powerful Dharma Bodies required time to reconstruct, or those like Chen Yang and Nantanchen who cultivated Pit Water—on whom the light had less effect—every other cultivator was brought back from the brink!

As Li Ximing dispersed his divine ability, Li Minggong immediately hurried over, beaming.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing nodded, then noticed the second person to approach. He was a stern-faced, middle-aged man, his entire body covered in mottled patches of tender, new-grown skin. Not a single inch of his hands or feet was unblemished—a testament to the horrific battle he had just endured.

This man was none other than Li Ju, who had come from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm.

He was originally from Lingbei, a man of considerable skill and one of Vast Cicada's former subordinates. After being captured by Ding Weizeng, he had been 'washed' by 'World's Radiance'. He had completely lost his old self, cultivated to the late Foundation Establishment Realm, and become one of the Li's most loyal supporters. After so much time, he had been fundamentally changed to his very core.

It was the ultimate irony. In the entire battle for the west bank, aside from Ding Weizeng, who had held off multiple opponents at once, this man had fought with the most savage ferocity. Since joining them, his cultivation had advanced greatly, he was fully equipped, and he fought with every blessing they could provide. He battled with no regard for his lifespan or his own foundation, stunning the Shu generals who besieged him.

The price for that ferocity was enormous. Initially, Li Ju had burned through more than seventy years of his lifespan and nearly exhausted his immortal foundation. If Li Ximing had acted a single step later, Li Ju would have undoubtedly perished on that riverbank!

Yet even with the Light of the Six Harmonies saving him and the divine ability's timely restoration, he had still permanently lost over thirty years of his lifespan.

Li Ximing observed this with complicated feelings and nodded.

"Good."

Having received that single word, Li Ju needed no other reward. Overwhelmed with honor and joy, he prostrated himself on the ground.

Li Suining, following just behind, watched this exchange with a heart full of emotion.

It was fair to say that the west bank had held on this long thanks to the heroic efforts of Li Ju, Ding Weizeng, and the direct-lineage member, Li Zhouda, who fought with the most desperation... The bank had not fallen instantly as it had in his past life. It was barely breathing, but it held, all thanks to the addition of Ding Weizeng and Li Ju!

Li Ximing turned his head and asked in a low voice,

"What are the casualties?"

Li Minggong stepped forward.

"Per the Lord's command, the Zhuang family from across the Western Mountains was evacuated before the Song attack. Our losses are not catastrophic. The retreat was orderly... no major disasters. However, one Foundation Establishment Realm Guest Retainer was killed. His name was Pu Yu. He wasn't old... the new Family Head of the Pu family, just recently broken through. It's a great pity. The Tian family's Family Head, Tian Ling, who broke through at the same time as him... he was luckier. He escaped with his life."

"Otherwise... many Qi Refining cultivators were lost. That is the most painful part..."

Li Minggong glanced around and lowered her voice pointedly.

"Guest Retainer Ding's eldest son... Ding Yuming. It was his first battle. He also fell."

Ding Weizeng was usually the first to greet him, but his absence now meant he was obviously searching for his son's remains. Li Ximing was silent for a moment before dismissing the others. He took Li Minggong and Li Suining and descended on the wind, just as the burly man was ascending, clutching a jade box.

Inside the box was a mix of crimson blood and stark white bone. He was completely, irrevocably dead. Not even 'Valley Water' could bring him back.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

He had already composed himself and bowed respectfully. Li Ximing helped him up, simply patting him on the shoulder. The man waited a second. Hearing no command, he made a rare request.

"This subordinate must return to inform my wife and daughter."

Li Ximing let him go. Li Minggong said quietly,

"Guest Retainer Ding had one daughter and two sons. His second son rushed his cultivation years ago, failed to break through Qi Refining, and perished. Now his eldest son has also died young. Only his daughter, Ding Yujing, remains. Her talent is exceptional, and she's preparing to face the life-and-death trial for the Foundation Establishment Realm. Fortunately, his eldest son left behind a grandson, preserving the bloodline."

Li Suining remained silent. In his past life, Ding Weizeng had died far too early. Ding Yujing had been forced to manage the funeral, delaying her breakthrough. As a result, she died alongside Ding Yuming on this very day. The Ding family's brief moment of glory had faded, leaving only a widow and a young grandson.

That grandson was named Ding Weili. He had been in Li Zhouda's army and died at the hands of Wang Quwan—another loyal soul.

'Three generations of the Ding family, all loyal to the end. They died repaying a debt of kindness, without a moment's hesitation.'

As Li Suining saw it, the current situation was already infinitely better than his past life. Zhuang Pingye had not died. Most importantly, late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators like Miaoshui, Ding Weizeng, and Li Minggong were all unharmed. This was the best possible outcome.

As he was lost in thought, the Heavenly Light beneath his feet touched down on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Li Ximing first sent Li Jiangchun to his quarters before returning to the summit. There, he saw Li Jiangzong escorting a captive up the path.

The man was gaunt, middle-aged, and trembling. He knelt before the pavilion and kowtowed.

"This lowly one, Lin Yuan, greets the Daoist Master!"

The Shu general stammered, immediately trying to claim connections, saying his ancestor had followed a General Li and Zhuang Cheng to attack Chengshui.

Li Ximing had no patience for it.

"Raise your head!"

The cultivator didn't even dare to pause, letting out a wail as if his soul had fled his body. Li Ximing was in no mood for this. He waved him away.

"Go follow Li Ju."

The others trembled. Li Ximing took the casualty list from Li Jiangzong, reading it as he stood. He began to pace the mountaintop, his heart aching as he silently committed the names to memory.

He closed his eyes, his heart growing heavy.

Li Jiangchun's face remained vivid in his mind, that sword mark seared into his vision. His heart fell silent. He suddenly recalled that day, years ago: the longsword streaking across the sky, the bronze sword shattering, his own brother collapsing into his arms, gasping,

'Ming-ge'er, the Qingchi sword... it must still hold a trump card from the immortal who left it... or a legacy!'

Li Xijun's blood-streaked face flashed in his memory, those bright, ambiguous eyes staring directly into his soul. A cold caution gripped Daoist Master Zhaojing's heart.

'A legacy? A legacy left by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator? One that the Immortal Mirror cannot detect, and even my Purple Mansion Realm Life Divine Ability cannot perceive?'

'Is that right?'

The Daoist Master stood in silence, his expression perfectly calm. He extinguished the avalanche of doubt rising in his mind. His Life Divine Ability retracted, returning to a state of stillness.

'I was too foolish, Jun-ge'er... I didn't even hear the implication in your words...'

'You said "immortal," not "senior." That was it, wasn't it?'

He suddenly sighed, as if lamenting the lives lost on the list in his hand. Without a trace of strangeness, he turned back to the juniors.

"The Western Mountains needs a Purple Mansion Realm grand array."

---

...Tangdao Mountain.

Gray clouds roiled across the sky. Patches of auspicious, multicolored light sat within a deep darkness, where a colossal, terrifying shadow loomed. Countless golden bodies clung to it, resembling a supreme Buddhist Land in its magnificent, terrible scale.

On the other side of that darkness, a brilliant Jade True wheel spun, casting down its own motes of light, like tufts of cotton. These lights shifted and transformed in mid-air, intercepting and dissolving the incoming attacks, one by one, reducing them to a sky full of fragrant ash that drifted silently down.

The sword cultivator stood with his blade drawn, his face a mask of killing intent. Opposite him, the golden-eyed king held his halberd, Heavenly Light flashing around his imposing figure.

A stalemate.

Atop the Buddhist Land, a Maha golden body stood tall, looking down at the monk on the other side.

Jiang Toushou squinted, his expression dark and uncertain.

'Vast Cicada... is actually dead!'

Hearing this news, Jiang Toushou's heart grew heavy.

Both the Way of Great Desire and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm had a small claim to the Bright Yang opportunity, and neither wanted the other to seize it. Vast Cicada's death meant the value of the Way of Great Desire's chess pieces had just multiplied several times over. Tian Langzhi was probably weeping with joy. Jiang Toushou was no supporter of Vast Cicada, but the Way of Great Desire's recently revealed rebellious intentions left him with no reason to celebrate.

'Now Tian Langzhi can rest easy. He no longer has to fear that intervening too slowly will let the Great Adoration Dharma Realm gain an advantage. He'll just continue to sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight... Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain... it... it can't hold out much longer...'

He knew Tian Langzhi only wanted to reap the benefits. If the Baixiang front made gains, or even pushed south to isolate Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, Tian Langzhi would definitely have moved to claim a piece of the pie. But now, with the two sides locked in a stalemate, Tian Langzhi was content to wait!

'That day, he put on an act, strongly advising me to kill Minghui. I saw his high cultivation and thought he was a man of character, so I foolishly believed him. It's obvious now he was preparing for this... hoping I would shatter my relationship with the Lotus Temple... That was his true goal! Fortunately... fortunately, those disciple-brothers did not die...'

Jiang Toushou was struck by the realization, his heart filling with regret. But this was no time to remain in a stalemate. He could only say coldly,

"Tell General Touba and Zhelu... they no longer need to maintain the siege."

After an unknown amount of time, the light of the Buddhist Land was seen receding, bit by bit. The silent horizon grew dark and heavy. Liu Bai recalled his green-edged sword from the sky, shaking his head with a cold sneer.

"A pack of cowards, bullying the weak and fearing the strong!"

Li Zhouwei nodded, his gaze fixed with interest on the brocade-like divine ability in the sky. He retracted his halberd.

"Is that 'Pattern Brocade'? It doesn't resemble 'Jade True' anymore."

The fluid, shifting divine ability in the sky was indeed the Fei family's former 'Pattern Brocade'. The marvel that had once clung to Fei Wangbai like a cloak now bore no resemblance to its original form. Liu Bai nodded and smiled.

"'Pattern Brocade' is the aspect of Jade True favored by Prime Virtue. It possesses the nature of material change. My Dao lineage happens to have a few secret arts that can unleash its Material Transformation ability. I've made a fool of myself in front of King Wei."

Liu Bai's legacy was clearly profound. That sentence alone might hold inspiration for his own juniors. Li Zhouwei casually committed it to memory, nodded, and then looked toward the majestic mountain behind them.

At the mention of Situ Huo, Liu Bai's expression instantly turned cold. 

"Baixiang still requires a garrison. I must trouble King Wei with the matters here. If you have any arrangements, simply send a messenger to Baixiang."
