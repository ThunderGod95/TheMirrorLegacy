# Chapter 354: The Jade Buckle

The group of cultivators from Milin Prefecture paid their tributes. The Dawn Cloudliner, with its colorful radiance and long tail, docked in the sky, casting a beautiful golden-red reflection.

Meanwhile at the Li Residence...

In a dim room shrouded in white mist, a bluish-gray mirror slowly floated up, vibrating incessantly and emitting dazzling white light. Lu Jiangxian's divine sense suppressed the trembling of the mirror, and he was filled with suspicion and alarm.

"T-This is...!"

Various illusions appeared before his eyes—a rushing clear stream, a treasure vault glittering with mana lights, a young boy's tender face, fair arms, towering mountains with immortals traversing them, gushing spirit springs, and a cave-dwelling abundant with spiritual qi.

Finally... the vision lingered on the radiant Dawn Cloudliner.

"There is a mirror fragment on the Dawn Cloudliner!"

Lu Jiangxian had experienced this reaction before. The jade stones by the lake and the jade pendant in the old Daoist's hand had both caused similar feelings of trepidation. Now that the mirror's power had gradually recovered, these impulses had grown even stronger.

"Who is it..."

The mirror floated up again, with twelve ancient runes shining one by one on its surface. If not for Lu Jiangxian's suppression, it would have already flown away long ago, drawing the fragments together in reunion.

This sensation and phenomenon even emanated from the mirror, ricocheting within the sealed dark room and transforming into various mystical visions.

Patterns on the ground suddenly sprouted osmanthus trees with golden-white flowers hanging down from their branches. Their stamens were like gold, exuding a pleasant fragrance, and appearing particularly brilliant in the misty moonlight.

The rustling sound grew louder, and a few energetic and lively toads hopped out from the shadows, playing among the fallen osmanthus flowers. A jade buckle appeared in the reflection of the bluish-gray mirror.

"Yu Muxian..! It is on Yu Muxian!"

Amidst the illusions, Lu Jiangxian recognized the face resembling Yu Mugao's, exuding an ethereal aura. Who else could it be but Yu Muxian?

RUMBLE!

The sunlight above the Li Residence dimmed. The mirror's internal world shook, its tremors tracing back through the connection of the talisman seeds. Outside, the talisman seeds trembled, emitting white light.

Li Ximing, who was the closest, was quietly reading an alchemy text in the great hall. His qihai acupoint suddenly churned, radiating brilliant light that caused him intense pain, making him cry out in agony.

"AHH!"

He curled up in pain, breaking out in a cold sweat almost immediately.

Li Yuanping, who was reading a secret letter in the Clan Affairs Courtyard, was startled by the child's scream. He jumped up, not even bothering to put on his shoes, and rushed to the child's side.

"Ming'er! Ming'er!" he called out anxiously.

Li Ximing was Li Yuanping's only son and a precious asset to the Li Family. Naturally, his distress threw Li Yuanping into a panic. He reached out to touch the child's forehead and found it cold and clammy, much to his dismay. When he lifted his hand, he discovered it was covered in transparent mucus.

"This..."

The mucus was icy cold. As it dripped to the ground, it transformed into golden-white petals that scattered everywhere, leaving Li Yuanping stunned.

The petals were striking, shattering upon contact with the ground and rising as bright, moon-like yin energy. The sight blew Li Yuanping's mind.

Dou Yi, standing at the far end, was terrified by the scene. With Li Yuanping's lifespan limited and Madam Dou being heartless, the entire Dou Family depended on young Li Ximing. Dou Yi hurriedly rushed up the steps, alarmed by the turn of events.

"Young master?!"

As the Li Family ascended to the status of a clan, more and more rogue cultivators visited, and the standards for such visits were modeled after those of other clans in Yue State. The upper staircase had over twenty steps, and it took Dou Yi several moments to climb them all.

Dou Yi had just ascended the last few steps when he rushed forward to find Li Yuanping. Li Yuanping turned abruptly, his gray-black pupils dilated, and his forehead covered in a sheen of sweat. The gentleness in his face was completely gone, replaced by a grim and fierce expression.

"Get out!!" he shouted fiercely.

Dou Yi had been with him for almost ten years and had only ever seen such an expression on Li Yuanjiao's face. Li Yuanping was usually much more composed and gentle, and seeing him like this now made Dou Yi's heart pound in fear. He stumbled backward, missed a step, and fell, rolling down the dozen steps.

THUD!

Living a life of luxury and indulgence in recent years had left Dou Yi quite plump, and he rolled all the way to the bottom of the stairs with a heavy thud. Without daring to lift his head, he grabbed his robe and scrambled out of the hall hastily.

Li Yuanping stood at the top, his body trembling slightly. He dared not move an inch, using his wide robe to cover the trembling Li Ximing in his arms.

"Everyone, leave!" he instructed firmly.

It was not until the clinking sounds of armor had faded and the guards at the sides of the stairs had retreated did he quickly grab the alchemy book from the table.

In his haste, Li Yuanping knocked over ink and brushes which fell with a clatter. He paid no attention to the mess, frantically patting the few bright streams of moonlight-like energy beneath him.

Only when the last of the Supreme Yin Moonlight disappeared and the entire hall had turned cold did a bit of color return to his face.

"Father..."

Li Ximing attempted to rise amidst the scattered osmanthus petals.

Li Yuanping hurriedly embraced him, relieved to find that the boy was unharmed. He murmured, "Immortal Mirror... It's the Immortal Mirror..."

Meanwhile on Mount Wutu...

Li Xizhi suddenly looked up, staring at the scattered petals in his hands.

Hundreds of li away at the Cloud Crowned Peak market, Li Xuanxuan, who was bargaining with a customer, abruptly fell silent, hearing a faint rustling sound...

In the Yi Mountain City...

In the Milin Prefecture...

All those who received a Profound Pearl Talisman Seed looked up simultaneously, gazing into the distance pensively as an ethereal face and a translucent, smooth jade buckle appeared before their eyes.

————

Li Yuanjiao suddenly raised his head, the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his qihai acupoint vibrating intensely. A point of white light appeared in his eyes and he felt a strong attraction, his gaze fixed on Yu Muxian's white robe.

"Yu Muxian... Jade buckle..."

Seeing Yu Muxian seemingly sense something and look up, Li Yuanjiao slowly lowered his head. He had once read in the family's history about Li Tongya back when he was still a mortal, who had ventured into the reed marshes at night and found that jade stone, a feat that seemed impossible.

The vastness of the reed marshes made it akin to finding a needle in a haystack... How could a mere mortal find it? He had attributed it to Li Tongya's unique fortune, which was different from ordinary people.

Now, truly facing the legendary treasure that could fuse with the mirror, he realized its wondrous nature. Even without looking at Yu Muxian, he could feel the jade buckle in his hand.

At the top, Yu Muxian felt a sudden sense of unease, a fleeting pang that vanished as quickly as it came, leaving no trace behind.

Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who had refined their immortal foundations possessed certain mystic abilities. A sudden premonition was a significant matter, but after thoroughly inspecting himself and finding nothing out of place, he could only cast suspicious glances at those below him.

"Milin Prefecture's Yu Family!"

The attendant of the immortal sect began calling names, and Yu Muxian dismissed his distractions, quietly watching his brother bow and withdraw. He then stood upright.

His gaze lingered on Yu Mugao's gaunt cheeks and haggard figure. The burdens of thought and schemes seemed to have crushed the man. Despite being at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm cultivation, he was tormented to this state by the internal strife and intense struggles within the Yu Family.

With Yu Xiaogui severely injured and in seclusion, the various branches of the Yu Family, already dissatisfied with Yu Mugao's control, had erupted into chaos, each faction acting independently. If not for the absence of news confirming Yu Xiaogui's death and Yu Mugao's ruthless methods, the situation might have already turned disastrous.

"Sixteen stalks of Autumn Moon Grass, two thousand jin of Purple Jade Spirit Rice, ninety pieces of Azure Pool Essence Stones, seven Long Sea Pearls..."

Box after box of spirit items were carried to the stage. Yu Muxian, rubbing the jade buckle in his hand, reflected internally, If I had not found this treasure as a child, which allowed me to see through people's true nature and sever worldly ties, I might have ended up mired in the power struggles of the Yu Family at Moongaze Lake… facing a tragic fate.

"Li Family of Lijing!"

Yu Muxian was lost in thought when the attendant's voice brought him back to reality. A young man in black came forward, broad-shouldered with high-set eyebrows, exuding an ambitious air that made him seem untrustworthy at first glance.

"Li Yuanjiao of the Li Family greets the Emissary!" Li Yuanjiao responded with composure, his gaze fixed on Yu Muxian's robe.

Yu Muxian nodded and said warmly, "I have long heard of the Sword Immortal's fame."

He cupped his fist, smiling as he continued, "The Qingche Sword that the Sword Immortal wielded was crafted by my master's own hands. Yuanwu Peak has always had good relations with Qingsui Peak. There is no need for such formalities, fellow Daoist."

These words not only stirred Li Yuanjiao but also drew the attention of the various families around the lake. Yu Mugao slowly closed his eyes, saying nothing.

"So, there is such a connection…"

Yu Muxian's excessive friendliness made Li Yuanjiao uncertain of his intentions. He responded vaguely, and Yu Muxian said no more, simply standing there with his hands clasped behind his back.

As box after box of spirit items were brought up and all the families reported, an attendant verified everything. A young cultivator in green then stepped forward, respectfully addressing Yu Muxian, "Senior Brother, the three clans and sixteen prominent families of Moongaze Lake, along with forty-one smaller households, have all been checked. Please review them."

Yu Muxian took the record from him and read aloud the names of the families marked for discrepancies—either underreporting or for the poor quality of spirit items. Immediately, several disciples in green stepped forward and dragged the offenders out unceremoniously.

Thud!

The people from several families trembled and kneeled. Yu Muxian chuckled lightly and asked, "Junior Brother, how are these cases usually handled?"

The reporting disciple looked disdainfully at the families below and replied, "They shall be punished according to the severity of the discrepancies—some by executing their elders, others by removing their family name, and some by banishment to Yi Mountain City."

The crowd below immediately began to tremble with fear, begging for mercy out loud repeatedly. Yu Muxian glanced at them and saw that several families were under the jurisdiction of Daoist He on the western shore—most likely unable to pay double taxes.

He then said gently, "Just confiscate the storage pouches from a few people to make up for the shortfall. Otherwise, we'll have to require Senior He's advice and trouble him."

"Understood!"

As soon as he had finished speaking, several uniformed cultivators seized the storage pouches from those individuals. Despite their pleas and cries, the cultivators handed the pouches to Yu Muxian, who calmly tucked them into his sleeve. Then he said, "The clans should stay; the rest may leave now."

The smaller households felt as if they had received a pardon and they bid their farewells, then quickly scattered like the wind. In an instant, only the Azure Pond cultivators and the Fei, Li, and Yu families remained on the mountaintop.

Although the Fei Family had lost Fei Wangbai, they were still recognized as a clan by the Azure Pond Sect and therefore did not leave. Representing the Fei Family was Fei Tongyu, who had just reached the Qi Cultivation Realm. His aura was unstable, indicating that he had used some medicinal aid.

Yu Muxian swung his sleeve, stepped forward, and cupped his fist to Fei Tongyu. His immortal grace was evident as he said regretfully, "You must be the young master of the Fei Family… I have heard about Senior Wangbai's passing. As a cultivator under our sect, his death caused quite a stir within the sect, and we sent people to investigate."

Shaking his head with regret, he continued in a low voice, "Unfortunately, the culprit remains elusive, and we have not uncovered any information."

"Thank you for your effort..." Fei Tongyu responded, pretending to be moved by his words as he exchanged pleasantries with Yu Muxian.

Yu Muxian then said, "The Fei Family has provided tributes for many years. Our sect feels obliged to offer some compensation."

Fei Tongyu's eyes lit up, understanding that the crucial moment had arrived. Yu Muxian smiled and said, "My master has decided that the next disciple slot will go to your clan!"

These words shocked the three families. Several moments of silence passed, with only the whistling wind breaking the quietness.

"What?!" Yu Mugao was utterly stunned, his expression one of disbelief.

Li Yuanjiao appeared thoughtful while Fei Tongyu exclaimed in amazement, "Which peak would that be?"

"Naturally, it will be my Yuanwu Peak!" Yu Muxian announced.

After the initial shock, Fei Tongyu was visibly overjoyed. Fei Wangbai's greatest regret while he was alive was not being able to support a disciple within the Azure Pond Sect. Now, despite knowing Yu Muxian's likely had ulterior motives, he could not bring himself to refuse such an offer.

My family still needs to send disciples to the sect, so how could the Fei Family refuse? How could they possibly refuse…

Li Yuanjiao stared silently at Yu Muxian's ethereal profile, lost in countless thoughts. For a moment, he was speechless, only thinking to himself, This Yu Muxian... he is indeed a remarkable figure. With this single move, he has restored the tripartite balance on the lake and caused a rift between the Fei Family and mine... Even if the ancestors were still alive, there would be no changing this. He keeps that jade buckle hidden inside his robe, close to his body… It must have many miraculous properties! Obtaining it will definitely not be an easy task... I must plan carefully.

Meanwhile, Yu Muxian discussed some details with Fei Tongyu. Afterward, he turned to address Yu Mugao and Li Yuanjiao, saying softly, "Greetings, fellow Daoists!"

Yu Muxian was a Foundation Establishment Realm immortal cultivator, and both of them felt unworthy of being addressed as fellow Daoists by him. Before they could decline and refuse, Yu Muxian continued, "Every seventy years, the various peaks of the sect rotate their jurisdictions. Moongaze Lake now falls under the jurisdiction of Yuanwu Peak. In recent years, my junior brothers have been handling peak-related affairs, and we have not made proper agreements with you all. This has caused many disturbances on the lake, which is our peak's fault."

Li Yuanjiao dared not let him apologize and quickly brushed things off. Yu Mugao, on the other hand, stared at Yu Muxian in confusion and disbelief, as if he could no longer recognize his younger brother.

Yu Muxian then continued, "So I reported to my master, and Yuanwu Peak has re-evaluated the current situation and redefined the boundaries, which I have brought to you."

With a gentle pat on his silk pouch, three light green jade seals appeared in his hand, which he distributed to the three of them. His gaze finally carried a hint of warning as he said coldly, "With these boundaries set, minor conflicts between minor households will not be our concern, but the major clans must not engage in further disputes! This is also my master's intention..."

Li Yuanjiao received the light green jade seal and brushed it lightly with his hand. The seal emitted a golden light, revealing several large golden characters—Under the jurisdiction of Azure Pond Sect.

Immediately, the boundaries' outlines appeared in silvery light, encompassing Lijing, Huaqian, Huazhong, Yuting, and even including Mount Wutu and Eastern Mount Yue.

The Li Family had previously held a jade seal left by Si Yuanbai, which only marked the four towns of Lijing. It could not compare to this new one.

Now that Yuanwu Peak had acknowledged the legitimacy of the Li Family's territory, Li Yuanjiao felt a sense of relief and responded, "We will strictly follow the Daoist Master's decree!"

Fei Tongyu was even more overjoyed. Of the three major clans on the lake, his was the weakest. He responded eagerly and felt greatly relieved.

Seeing Li Yuanjiao and Fei Tongyu both agree, Yu Muxian nodded approvingly.

"Thank you, fellow Daoists."
