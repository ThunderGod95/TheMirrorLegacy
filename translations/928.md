# Chapter 928, Yuanbian

Li Ximing secretly sized him up. He sat upright, unmoving, and said softly,

"This pill is exceptionally wondrous, so you must understand how high the difficulty is. I have some friends in Jiangnan who possess a Purple Mansion Realm spirit furnace. If I call in a personal favor and borrow it, the chance of successfully refining the pill is at least seventy percent."

The Demon King let out a 'haha' and stood up from his seat, his face beaming with joy. He announced in a clear voice,

"If Daoist Friend can guarantee seventy percent, then this deal is definitely worth making!"

Seeing his eagerness, Li Ximing felt the Demon King was ready to go all-in on this gamble. But this wasn't a one-man affair. If the refinement failed, he would needlessly provoke a noble scion. Li Ximing feared the trouble. After careful consideration, he still tried to persuade him,

"Daoist Friend should be more cautious… After all, this is an incredibly precious spiritual object. If anything goes wrong, the pain will be immense!"

Fuxun, however, turned his red-and-white-streaked eyes upon him. His lips moved as he spoke in a low voice,

"I don't mind telling you, Daoist Friend, that this king has some small influence in this region. Near the Xipo Kingdom, there is a Demon Cave. The cave master is my dearest friend, his Daoist title is Qingyan, and he cultivates the Azure Manifestation path!"

"Oh?!"

Li Ximing's interest was immediately piqued. Azure Manifestation was a Daoist tradition that seemed both infinitely distant and yet right before his eyes. His own neighbors, the Yuan family, cultivated Azure Manifestation, which was once considered a marvel in Jiangnan. Yet, they had been unable to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm for ages, causing their illustrious Daoist tradition to lose its luster.

He had never expected to encounter a cultivator of Azure Manifestation in this remote Demon Kingdom. Li Ximing smiled and nodded, already understanding his meaning. He asked,

"Is it... an Invocation Art?"

The Great Suopo King nodded proudly, lifting his chin. "Daoist Friend is truly from the Immortal Dao of Jiangnan, so knowledgeable and experienced! Hardly anyone in the entire Southern Borderlands has even heard of the Azure Manifestation path!"

Li Ximing pondered this for a moment, then offered a reminder,

"Although traces of Invocation Arts still exist in Jiangnan, I have rarely heard of them being used to assist in pill refinement. We should still test it beforehand."

"But of course!"

Fuxun said solemnly,

"Of the so-called Three Shamans and Two Invokers, the two invokers are Hengzhu and Azure Manifestation. My brother is also of noble descent, and his Dao-Profundity is not shallow. Besides… Daoist Friend, don't forget about me!"

He smiled faintly, and his red-and-white eyes blinked, making him appear even more demonic,

"This king cultivates Auspicious Qi, which includes a divine ability to sense fortune and calamity, and to bestow good luck. With the three of us working together, if this pill still fails to form, I'm afraid there are no other methods left that could succeed!"

'That's true enough…'

The other party possessed an Auspicious Qi divine ability. Since their conversation was proceeding so smoothly, it meant the divine ability sensed no abnormalities; the venture itself was inherently beneficial. Li Ximing relaxed slightly. Looking at Fuxun, he said softly,

"Since that is the case, I will need to borrow that spirit furnace. As for your Spirit Fire…"

At this, Fuxun's energy returned. He stroked his chin, thinking hard. After a long while, he answered,

"Honestly, the most convenient way is to steal one. On the Western Heaven Plateau, in that White Victory Palace, there's a cultivator of 'Lesser Yang' who knows how to refine some pills. He definitely has a Spirit Fire, and it's quite strong. It's called the Palace-Aspect Fire of the High Formulae."

Li Ximing simply refused politely,

"There is no need to consider a Lesser Yang fire. The Spirit Fire I wish to obtain must at least be from among the Fire-virtue, and it cannot be a 'Merging Fire'!"

If it was absolutely necessary, he wouldn't shy from a fight. But the other party was clearly nursing plans to drag him into a conflict against the White Victory Palace. Li Ximing would never agree to that. He firmed his tone to pressure him.

Seeing that he had narrowed the scope, Fuxun racked his brain and finally found a target. He lowered his voice,

"If you travel south from here, near the northern part of the Southern Sea, there is a great nation of the Southern Borderlands. Its capital is on a large southern island. It's called the Vermilion Luo Kingdom. The king died long ago, his body transforming into a Spirit Fire that was carved up by various families. He left behind a new king who only just broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm. I suspect he still has a Spirit Fire."

Li Ximing saw his predatory intent at a glance and understood that this fellow was quite cunning. He frowned.

"Daoist Friend, either you go and get the Spirit Fire first, or we go and trade for it. You are not to use my name to intimidate or coerce him, which would only create an enemy."

"Naturally, naturally."

Fuxun cupped his hands, his tone almost fawning,

"After all, Daoist Friend still needs to refine the pill… How could this king possibly cause trouble in this matter…"

"What this king means is, that new king is in dire straits right now. If Daoist Friend provides some pills, and I promise him some conditions, like my protection for a number of years…"

The Demon beast gave a low, sinister chuckle,

"He's already in a difficult position and can't afford to offend me. With a bit of coercion and enticement, there's a high probability he'll agree!"

"Fine."

Li Ximing didn't care if the promise would be honored. As long as he provided his pills and was extricated from the affair, that was enough. He reminded him,

"If you go to negotiate with him, I must be present."

Fuxun agreed, then observed him silently for a moment before replying,

"It's just that he cultivates 'Li Fire'. Can Daoist Friend refine pills for that?"

"That is not a problem."

Although Li Ximing didn't have a pill recipe for 'Li Fire' pills, his own alchemy skills were profound, and he possessed the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art. He wasn't worried about failing to satisfy a Demon King from this impoverished backwater.

He said softly,

"Daoist Friend, go and ask him. If he doesn't have any pills he urgently needs refined, just have him tell me what he requires, and I will refine them for him. The number of pills I produce will not disappoint him."

At this point, he paused slightly and smiled.

"As for the resources for this refinement… that is something Daoist Friend will need to consider."

In truth, Li Ximing had 'Li Fire' Purple Mansion Realm resources on hand—the Surging Li Treasure Leaf that Ning Wan had gifted him back at Moongaze Lake. It was perfectly suitable for this pill.

But having reached his current cultivation, Li Ximing had long since mastered the art of taking the initiative. He was naturally going to make Fuxun provide the resources.

The Great Suopo King deliberated for a moment, looking somewhat helpless. He shook his head.

"I'm not afraid of you laughing at me, Daoist Friend. Some years ago, to trade for the Non-Falling Golden Cloud, I completely exhausted all the spiritual resources I had accumulated over the years… Otherwise, I wouldn't always be thinking of fighting and stealing…"

"But it is only right that I provide this… We shall see what he demands."

Seeing that he was being rather sincere, Li Ximing nodded in agreement. He was already getting impatient. "When will we go to see this Demon King?"

"There's no rush."

Fuxun chuckled and said in a low voice,

"I mentioned a friend from Jiangnan earlier, with the Daoist title Yuanbian. He was in seclusion, cultivating at sea, and only came out last year. I've invited him to come and make an appearance, to put on a show of force and intimidate that Vermilion Luo King."

Li Ximing nodded. He decided to just wait in the courtyard and discuss the Dao with him. It turned out this Great Suopo King truly had some Dao-Profundity. His 'Auspicious Qi' was also exceedingly rare in the world, and Li Ximing actually gained considerable insight from their talk.

The Demon King's temperament was not as savage as he had imagined; he was even quite witty and straightforward. As they spoke more, Li Ximing could still sense his extreme focus on this pill. Fuxun fiddled with his teacup, appearing very anxious. Li Ximing had no choice but to say,

"The spiritual object is indeed precious, and this pill recipe is too extreme. Have you considered trying a different method?"

Fuxun just shook his head, saying slowly,

"The Non-Falling Golden Cloud is no ordinary thing. It is recorded in my Daoist tradition that a certain True Monarch used this item before he achieved the Dao. At that time, he was only at the Purple Mansion Realm. He used three clouds and one stone, with Supreme Yin as the base, to finally forge a single talisman… And those 'three clouds and one stone' included the Non-Falling Golden Cloud and the Supreme Concealed Origin."

Li Ximing calculated this in his mind and couldn't help but laugh.
"Just at the Purple Mansion Realm… he used four top-tier Purple Mansion spiritual objects to refine one talisman?"

"Far more than that!"

Fuxun laughed heartily, his expression filled with reverence. "I heard that the material used for the Supreme Yin base was far, far superior to even the Non-Falling Golden Cloud and the Supreme Concealed Origin!"

"Otherwise, how could he have become a True Monarch?"

He shook his head silently, then continued,

"This pill is intended to imitate the forging of that talisman, taking the True Monarch's act as its precedent. Back then, the True Monarch refined a talisman; today, what we refine is a pill. As for the Azure Manifestation enhancement, even if you had a 100% chance of success, I would still invite him… After all, we must honor the tale…"

From a purely alchemical perspective, Li Ximing saw it as just a refinement. But the act of emulating a sage's precedent was never just for comfort; it definitely had a tangible, practical use. Even today, cultivators in Jiangnan had all sorts of strange rituals, some so inexplicable they would break a weapon before opening an array…

Barely two days passed when a clamor arose from outside. Someone called out,

"Is Senior Fuxun present? Yuanbian has come to pay a visit!"

The voice made Li Ximing look up. He frowned strangely, an inexplicable doubt rising in his heart.

'That is definitely a Jiangnan accent… It even has a familiar, hometown feel…'

When Fuxun heard the voice, he knew the reinforcements he had waited so long for had arrived. He was overjoyed and rushed out of the tower, calling,

"Brother, you've come!"

The door opened, and a Daoist Master flew in. He appeared middle-aged. While his features weren't particularly handsome, he was dressed in a white fur robe, a precious pearl hanging from his waist, giving him a refined and scholarly air. On his fair brow were three vertical and horizontal marks, the two on the sides short and the one in the middle long, all glowing with a brilliant silver color.

His eyes were bright and spirited. He smiled as he entered the tower, still speaking humbly,

"Senior is too kind! You are my elder by many years, I truly dare not call you brother. Just calling me by my Daoist title is fine!"

After saying this, the Daoist Master in the white fur robe finally noticed there was another person in the tower. He stiffened, his gaze shifting over in a daze. His pupils suddenly dilated, as if he had seen something utterly shocking.

The Daoist Master in the white-gold Daoist robes had already risen from his seat and walked to the front of the tower. Their eyes met.

Compared to the other's sheer disbelief, Li Ximing's expression was one of bewildered uncertainty. He seemed unable to confirm it, his gaze sweeping over the man's face again and again. The atmosphere instantly froze like stone.

Fuxun's smile was still plastered on his face, but in that same instant, his mind screamed in alarm, warning bells blaring,

'Oh no! These two are enemies!'

The thought had barely risen in his mind when faint fangs began to emerge from beneath his fair-faced scholar's visage. Only one thought remained in Fuxun's mind,

'What a pity! It will be impossible to find an Alchemist this good again!'

But in just a flash, the middle-aged man in the long white fur robe beside him was already red-eyed, weeping with joy,

"Ximing!"

That single cry made Fuxun's rampaging fangs quickly retract. He turned his head away, slightly embarrassed. Li Ximing's eyes were filled with utter disbelief. 

Only when the middle-aged man walked right up to him did he stammer,

"Can it be… Senior Changdie…"

This person was Liu Changdie!

Li Ximing couldn't be more familiar with that name. This man was not only acquainted with several of his own family's elders, but he had also built arrays for his family long ago. Before the Li family had risen to prominence, almost every one of their arrays had been constructed by this Array Dao Master… 

The Five Waters Imperial Heaven Grand Array still in use on Mount Qingdu was his handiwork!

He had heard that this man and his uncle, Li Yuanjiao, were inseparable friends. Back then, Liu Changdie had wept so hard at his uncle's grave that he'd cried more fiercely than most of the relatives…

But unfortunately, Li Ximing had been cultivating at the Xiao family in his early years and had never met him. The last time this man had come to build an array for Mount Qingdu, Li Ximing had been in seclusion, breaking through…

Therefore, among all the brothers, only Li Ximing had never met him. Liu Changdie had deeply regretted this at the time and had even asked Li Xijun about him… He never charged a single coin for his array work, due to a debt of gratitude. Thus, when Li Ximing came out of seclusion, Li Xuanxuan had specifically shown him a portrait of Liu Changdie, so he would remember the man…

'He actually reached the Purple Mansion Realm, in silence, here in the Southern Borderlands! As a rogue cultivator… How incredible!'

Although he knew this man had some peculiarities, the world was full of people with secrets. How many of them ever reached the Purple Mansion Realm! Liu Changdie had actually managed to do it in this desolate and remote place?!

He understood the deep friendship between his family and Liu Changdie. He was both shocked and overjoyed. Who could have known that the emotions of the man before him were far more complex than his own…

Li Ximing had never met Liu Changdie, but Liu Changdie had met *him*! In a past life, Li Ximing's concubine had been Liu Changdie's daughter! Seeing his face now, how could he not be lost in a daze! A sob caught in his throat, and in a voice choked with a mixture of grief and joy, he cried,

"Seventh Young Master!"

The moment the man in the white fur robe spoke, Li Ximing felt as if a lifetime had passed,

'How many years has it been since someone called me Seventh Young Master? Who would still dare to call me Seventh Young Master?'

With just this one sentence, he was almost certain that the man before him was Liu Changdie. He was momentarily at a loss, and could only sigh,

"Congratulations, Senior! This is truly, truly unexpected…"

Liu Changdie stared at him deeply.

'I have memories of my past life, giving me an advantage at every turn. But even so, I suffered countless hardships and was only lucky enough to find a spiritual object in the Southern Borderlands to break through. Without a great deal of luck, I might not have succeeded even now!'

'But he had to drag an entire family with him, cultivating in that perilous land of Jiangnan, where killing intent lurks everywhere. And he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm at an even younger age than me… The hardships he must have endured are unimaginable…'

He let out a long sigh. After a long moment, he finally said,

"If Brother Jiao knew this in the underworld, he could finally rest in peace!"

This sentence caused Li Ximing's recently calmed emotions to stir once more. He let out a soft breath as he listened to the man before him, who asked excitedly,

"Is Lord Xuanxuan in good health? How is Miss Yuexiang? Is Third Young Master doing well at Azure Pond? Has Xicheng reached the Foundation Establishment Realm? And Xijun must be at the point of impacting the Purple Mansion Realm by now…"

Li Ximing listened quietly until he finished, then said softly,

"The old master is well. Third Brother has gone to the Eastern Sea to cultivate. Sister Yuexiang, Eldest Brother, Eighth Brother… they… are no longer with us."

"Oh!"

Liu Changdie turned his head away, sitting down as if he couldn't breathe. Li Ximing forced a smile and replied,

"Let's talk about the business at hand first!"

Both men were already masters of the Purple Mansion Realm, and there was an outsider—a Demon beast—watching them. They adjusted their emotions within a single breath. Fuxun looked left, then right, and was suddenly overjoyed,

"You two knew each other all along! This makes things much easier!"
