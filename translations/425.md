# Chapter 568: Destroyed Body

"I knew it... It's an arrow... When did such a powerful archer with a golden bow emerge in the Eastern Sea to take my life for no reason?!"

Since Ewu could clearly see the enemy, the panic in his heart began to subside. In its place, a deep wave of hatred surged. Thanks to his vajra body, he survived the attack and was able to determine the direction from which the golden phoenix-like profound arrow had come from.

"This arrow came from the front... so the enemy must be in the east. Damn it... I came all the way here for nothing!"

Realizing the direction of the attack, Ewu immediately returned. He quickly turned and rode the dharma light, flying toward the west.

He performed a hand seal, and his two long staves began to glow with golden light, thickening and stretching outward. The smell of burning incense emanated from them, radiating arcs of light that gradually formed into a circular shield.

"Qinling Shield."

Ewu did not have many defensive spells at his disposal. With one staff behind his back while the other pressed against his chest, he made sure his heart and vital organs were well protected as he rode the wind.

Although Ewu had never seen this man before, he was betting that such a powerful attack should not be easy to execute. But just as he thought he was safe, a buzzing sound suddenly rang in his ears, followed by a sharp pain shooting through his chest and back.

The sound tore through his ears, echoing constantly and almost to no end, causing his ears to bleed. A wave of raw fear surged in his heart. Ewu realized this was not just any ordinary sound—it was the result of the enemy's immortal foundation or its supporting spell.

His mind raced.

It's someone from the immortal sect, but not the Golden Tang Gate... Which one has such a powerful disciple? Could it be the sword gate?

Then, a tremendous shock hit his chest. The long staff in his hand let out a mournful cry before flying out of his grasp, spinning twice in the air. Ewu clutched his chest, feeling a new hole the size of a cow's eye in his left chest.

A Buddhist cultivator's dharma artifact was inferior. By the time he recovered his long staff again, he realized that it was now slightly bent.

Ewu was filled with dread.

He attacked from the front again! He's doing this on purpose!

The man's archery skills were unmatched, and Ewu had never encountered such a terrifying immortal arrow before in his life. It felt as though the archer was toying with him, striking for amusement. No matter which direction he took, the enemy could seemingly hit him at will.

Having fought in countless battles before, Ewu instinctively dove into the depths of the sea to escape at this critical moment. But just as he did, a cold shiver ran down the back of his neck.

Here it comes again...

He tried to unleash another spell, but a burst of Astral Qi pierced through his body with astounding power yet again, creating yet another small hole. It moved through his skin and organs, interrupting Ewu's spell twice until he ultimately failed to perform it.

Panic surged in Ewu's heart, growing to an unbearable intensity. He performed another hand seal with both hands and then yelled, "Paramita Technique—Body Sacrifice!"[1]

In an instant, his pale face and body melted rapidly, transforming into a golden light that enveloped him completely. Ewu radiated powerful energy, yet he did not feel any sense of security—only a chilling sense of dread creeping over him.

The buzzing in his ears intensified, almost like a million birds chirping in unison, and blood continued flowing from both of his ears. He expended his dharma body so that he could focus his gaze to the maximum. Finally, he saw five golden lights streaking toward him like meteors, their tails glowing brightly.

Hummm!

Clouds of vapor rose from the seawater, and Ewu opened his mouth to let out a roar, finally releasing the primal fear that gripped his heart. The five golden lights seemed to vanish, but he realized he was now nothing more than a head attached to a pair of shoulders—the rest of his dharma body had completely vaporized.

At this point, Ewu's heart turned as cold as seawater. He raised his arms, and without waiting for the next golden blast to strike, he twisted his own neck with a sharp, deliberate motion.

SNAP.

Ewu snapped his own neck. He had intentionally avoided using his dharma body's power, choosing instead to kill himself in the seawater. The golden light raced in, turning his torso into all but a bloody puddle as his head flew into the air, causing a massive wave to form on the surface of the sea.

The waves churned violently before slowly calming down, leaving only thick, dark clouds overhead. A drizzle began to fall on the sea before the four gusts of dharma winds finally arrived.

The leader of the guest cultivators gulped nervously, looking at the three others standing beside him. None of them dared to meet his gaze; they all lowered their heads and kept their eyes on the ground.

While the group was at a loss for what to do, a dark golden light slowly emerged before them. A middle-aged man appeared, riding on a flying shuttle. He reached out, catching Ewu's severed head falling from the dark clouds, and with a wave of his sleeve, he collected his dharma artifact and coldly surveyed the group.

This man had a chilling presence, dressed in imposing-looking black-gold armor with a longbow slung across his back. One hand rested behind him, while the other held the severed bald head with terrified eyes frozen in time.

Ewu's head, still dripping with blood, stained the man's strong arm. He said nothing, merely gazing at the group in silence.

RUN!

That was the thought that crossed the minds of the group simultaneously, but none of them dared to move a finger. A chilling wave of fear washed over them as the middle-aged man approached, step by step. Each of them lowered their heads, staring at the surface of the sea. Finally, the leader of the group spoke.

"T-Thank you for your help, Senior... We were..."

He was sweating profusely, his voice trembling as he spoke. Behind him, a figure swiftly flew over. It was Master Zong, whom Ewu had sent away earlier. He circled around, eventually finding the group. Shock and excitement filled his face as he approached and began speaking to the group in a flurry of words.

"Master Fu! Lord Situ must have used some kind of talisman... Just now, during the fight, I..."

SLAP!

He had only spoken half of his sentence when he sensed the strange atmosphere. He was then slapped across the face unceremoniously, causing him to stagger backward in shock and confusion.

The guest cultivator surnamed Fu, already sweating bullets, quickly pressed his head down and continued speaking, "We are but humble cultivators from the cape. We didn't mean to disturb the immortal sect's emissary! Please forgive us, Senior..."

Master Zong, noticing the grim expressions of his colleagues that seemed like they wanted to devour him alive, quickly suppressed his anger.

Li Xuanfeng's cold gaze swept past him and warned in a dangerously cold voice, "Go back and tell Situ Mo this—if he dares take even half a step off this island, I will shoot his head off and kick it like a ball."

Master Fu nodded quickly, understanding the gravity of the situation. This was a conflict between immortal sects, and he was just a small cultivator from overseas with no power or influence. All he could do was deliver the message. He dared not even wipe the sweat from his brow, nodding frantically as he replied, "This humble cultivator understands..."

Li Xuanfeng's black-gold armor glowed slightly before he finally vanished into thin air. The oppressive atmosphere finally lifted, and the crowd's tense expressions began to soften.

Master Zong, still reeling from the unexpected slap, was left angry and confused. He looked around at the group, his eyes filled with bewilderment.

Master Fu wiped the sweat from his brows and scolded, "You should be relieved that you're still alive because you didn't say anything that would've made things worse!"

Master Zong sort of understood the situation and whispered, "Which immortal sect's lord was that?"

"Who knows? You thought that was a talisman attack, but in reality, it was just a few arrows released by that man! Looking at his appearance... he may be from the Golden Feather Immortal Sect..." Master Fu replied hoarsely.

1. Paramita is a Buddhist term that is often translated as "Perfection". ☜

Li Xuanfeng, who was now quite some distance away from the group of cultivators, took out his hand that he had been hiding behind his back. His wide palm was now covered by tiny cuts that were slowly opening and closing like a baby's mouth. Blood was flowing freely from his fingers.

"I was fighting pretty recklessly..." he muttered to himself.

With a swift motion, Li Xuanfeng put away the severed head. The five arrows in his quiver were still vibrating slightly, seemingly thirsty for more action. The golden light from them intertwined with each other beautifully, like twinkling lights following an invisible rhythmic dance.

Li Xuanfeng had five Profound Arrows, all crafted from refined gold. After being shot, the arrows would fly back to him obediently. After their flight earlier, the five dharma artifacts seemed particularly excited, constantly buzzing energetically in their quiver.

Raising his gaze, Li Xuanfeng glanced around him before raising his longbow again. This time, he did not use the golden arrows. Instead, he drew the bow, causing the mana on the bowstring to converge, forming an Astral Arrow.

Swoosh.

The arrow whistled through the air, flying a hundred li, passing through the dense forest on an island in the sea, and striking the sinister head affixed to a massive banyan tree.

BOOM!

The head on the tree exploded with a loud bang, now reduced to dust along with the swaying banyan tree, leaving only blood stains on the ground.

Earlier, Ewu had kept this Situ Family's member alive, deliberately grafting him onto a banyan tree to avoid raising suspicion with Mutuo. Now, with the situation settled, Li Xuanfeng ended it with a single arrow, sparing the man from his endless struggle on the tree.

Li Xuanfeng gently wiped his palm, ensuring that the surface of his hand showed no sign of injury. Thankfully, the wounds were not serious—just a month or two of healing would suffice.

Ewu, after all, was an old Master Monk. Despite his declining Dao lineage, he was not to be underestimated, unlike the weak Mutuo who was obliterated with just two arrows. Hence, Li Xuanfeng had no choice but to attack mercilessly before this thing had the chance to escape.

"Too bad. If he had hesitated just a moment longer, he could have been shot right here."

Though the Master Monk had chosen suicide to escape, Li Xuanfeng still had to make things unpleasant for him. Astral Qi was not easy to neutralize and would continue to worsen his injuries. Without external help, Ewu would eventually die, slowly and painfully.

Before Ewu could purge the Astral Qi from his body, Li Xuanfeng's Golden Age would have sensed his presence if he came even within a hundred li, and with a single arrow, Li Xuanfeng could have made him flee again.

Li Xuanfeng had spent decades on the southern border, disheartened before growing more proud and confident. The news he had heard from the Ning Family left him seething in resentment for the longest time. And now, after obliterating and gravely injuring the two Buddhist cultivators, the hatred in his heart had finally eased slightly.

He murmured, "Just you wait... this is only the interest, not the price..."

After killing his way through the battle earlier, most of his mana reserve had been drained. As he flew through the dark, swirling clouds, Li Xuanfeng squinted, carefully considering his next steps.

Situ Mo is cautious. Since he's already revealed his strength, I don't think I can hide things much longer given his family's influence. I might as well use this opportunity to deter him or make him too fearful to leave the island. That way, he won't be able to harass my family's descendants.

Situ Mo's caution was unexpected, and Li Xuanfeng decided not to make things more difficult for the island's guest cultivators. He was in no condition to continue fighting, so he might as well stay to intimidate Situ Mo.

Thunder rumbled more frequently overhead, and the sky grew darker with ink-like clouds. Looking up at the misty expanse, the rain showed no sign of stopping. Li Yuanjiao always handled matters with caution, and since he was unable to gather information on where the Li Family had settled down in the Eastern Sea, Li Xuanfeng could only return to Splitreed Island.

It was dark on the sea, and Li Xuanfeng continued flying in the rain for a long time before he saw Splitreed Island in the distance. Diving into the sea, he was greeted by Ning Heyuan, who approached him with a smile.

"Brother-in-law, how did it go?"

"Not bad," Li Xuanfeng replied vaguely with a nod.

Ning Heyuan did not press further, merely laughing in response.

"Fellow Daoist Qinghong has arrived at the marketplace and is waiting for you!" he informed.

"Qinghong is here?!" Li Xuanfeng responded as he finally smiled, hurrying a few steps forward before flying toward the marketplace.

————

Eastern Sea, Qunyi Strait.

The islands in Qunyi Strait were densely packed, scattered across every corner of the strait with sizable populations living on them. Since these islands were near Shiqi Island, many Sons of Diyang were cultivating there.

On a remote, narrow island, the highest mountain was covered with barren, exposed boulders. At the top of the mountain stood a small temple, where five or six locals were silently praying.

The statue before them was carved from a massive boulder but was strangely white. At that moment, it began to shake, causing fine stone fragments and dust to rain down on the worshippers.

Speechless and fearful, the locals continued kneeling and bowing in reverence. Suddenly, the statue exploded, and a tiny baby jumped out from the rubble.

He was covered in blood, but disturbingly had only a head and a pair of shoulders. Everything chest down was missing.

The baby fell onto the ground with a thud, and a voice that sounded like a middle-aged man's came out of his mouth.

"Ah! Ah! Damn it! Damn it! Which immortal sect's disciple is he from...?!"

This baby, of course, was Ewu. Tears of blood were streaming from his eyes. While the local worshippers were still stunned, Ewu went up to one of them and stuffed his hand into his small mouth.

In a swift motion, the baby swallowed an entire arm whole. As soon as he did so, he grew considerably, and it did not take long for him to soon reach the size of a seventeen or eighteen-year-old young adult.

Yet, his body was still horrifying to look at—it was only a head sitting on top of his shoulders. Ewu's expression changed as the moment when Mutuo was obliterated before his eyes suddenly flashed before his eyes.

"Damn... there's something strange about this person."

He beckoned the last remaining local worshipper over, then raised his hand with nails that were as sharp as knives. Without warning, he severed the man's head and shoulders with a quick, clean slash.

With his hands on the ground, Ewu launched himself into the air and landed on the bloody stump of the corpse's chest, seamlessly merging himself with the body.

"Ah... so much better!"

Ewu took two steps forward. A small smile briefly appeared on his face before it quickly faded and froze into a grim expression.

PFFFT!

An inexplicable fluctuation erupted through his upper shoulders, causing the mortal body below to disintegrate into pieces. Ewu landed heavily on the ground again with a thud, feeling as though he had fallen into an ice cellar.

"What a brilliant immortal art!"

No matter how powerful a Buddhist cultivator's life-preserving abilities were, they could not sustain him in this form for long. While the scriptures declared that the physical body was just a vessel for the soul—one that could be replaced at will—a soul without this vessel would eventually drown in the secular world.

In that moment, Ewu realized the grim truth—unless he found a treasured panacea that was suitable for blood nourishment, he would perish within two or three years. He simply could not afford to hide away and cultivate slowly; time was of the essence. With no other choice, he steeled himself, summoned the wind, and flew toward the nearest island.

Ewu's heart was originally filled with hatred, but now... only fear remained.

Good thing the eldest senior brother is dead and the Qinling Dao lineage is now in my hands. If I can survive this calamity... I'll leave for the southern sea and never return to this cursed place!

The body, now nothing more than two shoulders and a head, floated through the air, drifting westward.

Ewu was consumed with despair, silently praying, "Oh, Revered One, please bless me! There must be an island with mortals somewhere here that isn't guarded by Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... Whether or not I can restore the Qinling Dao lineage depends on this!"
