# Chapter 885: The Situation is Set

When Ding Weizeng heard this, his eyes immediately reddened. He dropped to his knees, his voice thick with emotion.

"Weizeng kowtows in thanks, Daoist Master! Years ago, the Ding family cultivated under the rule of the Golden Tang Gate. Situ Chen was a tyrant who persecuted us relentlessly. We only managed to survive because Senior Situ Ku navigated the situation for us... While my parents were alive, they constantly reminded me... I must never forget this debt of gratitude."

"He... he just failed to grasp the situation and opposed those on the lake. In the end, he was captured by Your Excellency. All Weizeng could do was offer him aid in secret... Daoist Master, you have allowed my Ding family to fulfill its obligation... I don't know how I can ever repay this kindness!"

The old man, Situ Ku, kowtowed alongside him, his back drenched in a cold sweat. In truth, this 'navigating the situation' had been the Ding family bribing him with extravagant gifts. Back then, plenty of families had tried to buy his favor, and the Dings hadn't even offered the most. But they had been the most reliable and obedient, which was why he'd chosen to protect them.

Of course, none of this could be said aloud. Situ Ku just mumbled his thanks obsequiously. However, the main reason Li Ximing had spared him was Ning Wan. He spoke:

"Enough. Consider his life spared by his own good fortune. The Situ family has no shortage of enemies. You keep a close eye on him."

Ding Weizeng nodded respectfully, rising to his feet and helping the old man away. Situ Ku clearly hadn't imagined he would be allowed to live after so many years as a captive of the Li family. Overcome with joy, he wept as he was led away.

Li Ximing turned to Li Que'wan, who was just putting away a talisman. She reported:

"Daoist Master, there are no direct descendants of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators here. I found only one or two female relatives with close blood ties... The men were likely either taken away or slaughtered."

"Handle the arrangements."

Li Ximing gave the order casually to Li Jiangqian. The Li Family Head nodded and added a reminder:

"It's just... This junior fears the collection of cultivation methods here is incomplete. The Golden Tang Gate was famous for techniques... far beyond just the *Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra*."

"Mm..."

Li Ximing nodded, his gaze resting on the pile of jade slips. There were many techniques, but the quality was wildly inconsistent.

"At the very least, the 'Smoldering Shadow Qi' is missing. If not world-famous, that technique was at least infamous. After all, Situ Tang didn't just acquire the Tianxu Daoist tradition; he also visited the Mirrored-Mirrage Grotto Heaven. Either those monks didn't hand everything over, or the last gate master of the Golden Tang Gate, Situ Mo, tampered with the collection and moved the valuable texts elsewhere."

Li Jiangqian bowed and said:

"Since it belongs to the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition, it stands to reason that the Golden Feather Sect took it beforehand. They were likely afraid it would seem unjustifiable to take *everything*, so they at least left the Tianxu Daoist tradition behind."

Li Ximing had seen the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition that Changxiao possessed. It was on a completely different level, leaving both his family's arts and those of the Buddhist cultivators in the dust. While the power of a Dharma Art ultimately depends on the user and their cultivation base, a superior technique is not to be underestimated.

"As for the dharma artifacts..."

The Golden Tang Gate had left behind a considerable number of dharma artifacts and pills. But for a sect in such decline, their pills couldn't possibly compare to those of the Li family, who boasted a Purple Mansion Realm alchemist. Thankfully, the pile of dharma artifacts was large, and most were still imbued with dharma power. It was impractical to have the others refine them one by one. Li Ximing simply flicked his finger. A streak of Bright Yang light swept over the collection, instantly refining every dharma artifact on the ground in a single pass.

"Merely average."

It was impossible to know if the Golden Tang Gate's truly powerful dharma artifacts had already been looted, or if Situ Tang and his "filial" descendants had sold them all off. Li Ximing's standards were high, and he couldn't help but frown at the selection. Fortunately, there was an abundance of feathered robes. The two best—a pair of Foundation Establishment Realm-level Metal Virtue robes—were of no use to Li Jiangqian or Li Minggong. Li Ximing gave one to Li Que'wan and had the other sent to the clan's treasury, to be awarded later based on merit.

Li Jiangqian rummaged through the items with some interest and managed to find a single fire token. A closer look revealed it was for 'Merging Fire'. While this Daoist tradition was disdained by most, it was undeniably useful in combat. He commented:

"The Golden Tang Gate specialized solely in Metal Virtue and didn't dabble in other paths. Any of these miscellaneous techniques were likely stolen. That 'Smoldering Shadow Qi' you mentioned also has a trace of Merging Fire's aura. It must have been stolen from some Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition."

"The Golden Feather Sect is a True Monarch Daoist tradition of Metal Virtue, yet they also cultivate 'Dawn Qi', Fire Virtue, and Ancient Merging. Who walks only a single path!"

At the mention of the Golden Feather Sect, Li Ximing's expression grew complicated.

"This current situation..."

Although the Buddhist cultivators claimed to occupy the north, they only had a few Dharma Masters. They were always deferential when facing Mount Luoxia. This business with the Golden Feather Sect... even if Mount Luoxia didn't order it, they were certainly informed. And Luoxia's silence was, without a doubt, tacit approval.

This incident with the True Monarch revealed that the Golden Feather Daoist tradition is, in fact, subordinate to Mount Luoxia. Possessing a True Monarch merely granted them a degree of autonomy. But now, with this affair involving the monks, it was clear the relationship between Luoxia and Golden Feather wasn't one of perfect harmony from the top down...

'This is an awkward business. Everyone tacitly agrees this is an internal entanglement of the Luoxia faction. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition has no grounds to interfere. After all, even in their usual skirmishes with the Buddhist cultivators, neither side dares to invoke Mount Luoxia's name... The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition may be noble, but this is no longer the era of the Six Scions of Green Pine.'

He felt the great pressure of his family's 'Wei-Li' title, a burden he couldn't seem to shed. As he sat silently, a bright light suddenly flared in the sky, causing him to raise an eyebrow.

Li Que'wan sensed it first. After a moment's judgment, she smiled.

"Jiangxia is out of seclusion!"

Li Ximing turned, glanced at the bright light in the sky, and nodded.

"Tell Li Jianglong... have them all come. I recall you have two younger brothers. One cultivates 'Li Fire'... and the other 'Jade True'. How are they doing these days?"

Li Jiangqian sent someone to fetch them and reported:

"Fourth Brother, Jiangliang, has grown into a dashing young man, but he's restless by nature... He's more or less mastered the Dharma Arts Protector Cui taught him. When I told him to start learning a trade, he refused. Now we barely see him. He's forbidden from going north, so he just wanders south. Sometimes he escorts spiritual goods from the lakeside market to the various markets around Azure Pond... He'll disappear for three or five days at a time."

He sighed heavily, looking guilty.

"Fifth Brother, Jiangnian, is the complete opposite. He holes up in his immortal's cave year after year and never comes out. If you ask, the answer is always the same: he's in seclusion and cannot be disturbed... It's my failing as their older brother. I haven't been able to teach them to settle their minds."

Li Ximing shook his head as he listened.

"Cultivation and practical experience are both good things. We didn't have the luxury for it before. Now that Azure Pond is relatively safe, it's good for him to get out and move around."

Beside them, Li Que'wan added with a hint of regret:

"It's just that our two brothers, Li Jianglong and Jiangxia, have never really gotten along, even as children. Thankfully, neither of them lets it interfere with important matters. But... you'll never see them act particularly close."

Li Ximing wasn't particularly concerned. He was, after all, in the Purple Mansion Realm, and his perspective on such things was vastly different from those at the Foundation Establishment Realm. He said softly:

"It doesn't matter if they don't get along. The family is large and its interests are vast. You can't expect perfect harmony everywhere."

Li Jiangqian cupped his hands in acknowledgment. Just then, the Bright Yang light in the sky flared, and a man descended from it.

The man was tall and clad in armor, holding a short spear in each hand. He had long eyebrows and striking golden eyes, and his entire bearing radiated a bold, cheerful energy. He landed in the courtyard with a rush, scanned the area, and immediately bowed.

"Jiangxia pays respects to the Daoist Master!"

He was tall, not quite as large as Ding Weizeng, but comparable to Li Wen. Li Ximing's eyes lit up, and he gave a slight nod. Just then, an attendant announced another arrival. A man in a feathered robe entered, wearing a jade crown and a sword at his waist. His features were less striking than Jiangxia's. He first bowed to Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan before finally bowing to Li Ximing.

Seeing the two emerge from seclusion one after the other, Li Ximing smiled.

"Now we have people to put to use."

He then turned to Li Jiangqian.

"You've been stalled at the early Foundation Establishment Realm for long enough. It's perfect timing. Your two brothers are out, and I am also out of seclusion to oversee things. Set aside your current duties and go focus on your breakthrough. The family's affairs can be left to Li Jianglong and Jiangxia for the time being."

Li Jiangqian seemed to have anticipated this. He reported:

"I will obey the Daoist Master's command."

He turned back to his brothers and smiled.

"Then I'll have to trouble you two."

Jiangxia stepped forward, his voice resonant and powerful as he voiced his assent. Li Jianglong was far more reserved, merely offering a bow. Seeing Li Jiangqian's ready acceptance, Li Ximing added one more instruction:

"Jiangxia spends his years on the eastern shore; he's more familiar with it. Have him oversee that area. The affairs here on the Island will be left to Li Jianglong."

Neither man showed any change in expression, bowing in thanks. Li Ximing proceeded to test their cultivation, finding both of their foundations to be very solid. Li Jiangqian then spoke quietly:

"Since both my brothers are here, I have some news to report."

Li Jiangqian retrieved a letter from his sleeve, his expression growing somewhat grim.

"Daoist Master, please look at this!"

Li Ximing took the letter. It was from Wang Quwan, written in his own hand.

"Wang Quwan..."

Li Ximing vaguely recalled what Wang Quwan looked like all those years ago. He was a famous cultivator in Jiangbei now. Unfolding the letter, he saw the tone was as respectful as ever.

In it, Wang Quwan inquired after the well-being of the lake territories and mentioned a certain woman.

'Wang Xiaoxiao of the Jiangbei Wang family.'

Li Jiangqian waited for him to finish reading before speaking, choosing his words carefully.

"This Wang Xiaoxiao is, as suspected, a very close blood relative of Wang Quwan. Furthermore, from what I've gathered, not only is she one of the Great One's people, but she even brought the Great One to meet Wang Quwan personally."

"Oh?"

"The Great One gave Wang Quwan several dharma artifacts as a betrothal gift for Wang Xiaoxiao, and he accepted all of them. What's more, this happened quite some time ago. We don't know the exact date, but the letter states, 'We have been in contact for many years, but out of awe, I dared not speak of it, much less send word to the lake.' This has clearly been going on for a long time."

Li Ximing's expression became unreadable, showing neither pleasure nor anger. He gave a noncommittal grunt and passed the letter to the two men beside him. As they read it, Li Jianglong frowned, and Jiangxia's face paled. Li Jiangqian continued:

"That's the first point. Second, when the True Monarch departed, someone—we don't know who—suggested he designate territory for the Wang family. They were given land bordering the north. This was *after* the True Monarch nearly eradicated Wang He's faction... Finally, the letter's most crucial claim: a member of the Wang family apparently accompanied the True Monarch across the river and into the north. We cannot confirm if this is true."

Li Jiangqian's intelligence network was certainly not as fast as Ning Wan's. Li Ximing himself had only just learned of the True Monarch's departure from her. Yet, by the time he reached the shore, Li Jiangqian already knew. That was remarkably fast. It meant Wang Quwan must have sent this letter the very instant Lin Feng left.

He casually put the letter away and asked:

"Who delivered it? Did they leave a message?"

Li Jiangqian replied respectfully:

"It was Wang Quyu. He's already at the Foundation Establishment Realm. He delivered it to the shore and left immediately."

Li Ximing sat down in the courtyard. He didn't say much, simply replying:

"The Great One is gone. Send a reply. Tell him our family is interested in those Dharma swords. Wang Xiaoxiao has likely seen them. Have him send over diagrams of every sword."

Li Jiangqian nodded repeatedly but still offered a respectful reminder:

"Yes... But about Wang Quwan. I fear we must make preparations."

Li Ximing knew this, of course. Li Jiangqian had likely been wary of Wang Quwan for a long time. With a placid expression, he asked:

"What are your thoughts?"

Jiangxia looked displeased. He had the most straightforward personality among the brothers, but also the most domineering. He hated hearing anything that went against his grain. He answered in a cold voice:

"This junior has never met Wang Quwan, but I've heard Lord Ding speak of him with high praise. From the sound of it, he has no intention of remaining on the lake. He's the type who only bows on the surface. We must guard against him."

Li Jianglong's expression was somber. He agreed without hesitation, his voice low:

"Third Brother is right. Wang Quwan has never held any true loyalty to our family. He was merely cautious and discreet, forced by circumstances to lower his head. He is not the sort of man to willingly serve under another; we have never underestimated him in that regard. However, he also values his reputation. The Daoist Master did him a great service. And while the Jiangbei Wang family is beyond our reach, he will still defer to us. Sooner or later, he will have to return to the lake."

"But who knows what benefits he received? The benefits the Great One gave him... even if he does return, it might not be a good thing for our family in the long run."

"In this junior's opinion, a man like that will never truly submit. Even if he returns, we can only suppress or appease him because he is at the Foundation Establishment Realm. If he ever breaks through to the Purple Mansion Realm, he will become a disaster. Why bother? We would just be acting as his shield. It's like cutting off our own flesh to feed an eagle—letting him shelter under our roof only until the day he's strong enough to soar away."

Li Jiangqian glanced at his two brothers. His expression remained respectful, his tone even, as he spoke:

"Exactly. The Jiangbei Wang family has been fractured for years; it's a quagmire. But he cares deeply for his kinsmen. It is better to leave him in Jiangbei. Let him remain with the Jiangbei Wang family, forced to struggle against his circumstances, fending off attacks, scrambling to curry favor between Capital immortals and the Chengyun Gate. Let the hostile environment wear down his fortune and drain his energy. Let his clan be chaotic and disunited. Let him toss and turn day and night, unable to cultivate in peace."

"All the while, the debt he owes our family will hang over his head. How can he erase that? Even if, by some miracle, a phoenix rises from the ashes and he reaches the Purple Mansion Realm in that desolate land, he will still have to respectfully call you 'Senior' when he sees you, Daoist Master. Is that not far better than him cultivating to the Purple Mansion Realm *within* our family, only for us to be forced into a bitter separation, where the bonds of blood and gratitude are twisted into accusations of betrayal?"

"And besides, there is Wang Xiaoxiao. She is also extraordinary. How can we underestimate her?"

He smiled.

"If Wang Quwan joins our family, he has the entire Jiangbei Wang family behind him, looking to him as their pillar, proud of him. But if he tries to establish his *own* clan in Jiangbei, he will be forced to unify the fractured Jiangbei Wang family. That is a completely different matter. He might just end up being hated by everyone."

Li Ximing remained silent, his gaze fixed on the Wanling Flower Tree in the east. His eyes seemed to drift, wandering along the distant horizon.

Li Que'wan stood behind Li Ximing, a chill creeping into her heart as she listened to their discussion. Her almond-shaped eyes flickered up, following Li Ximing's gaze for an instant before she lowered her head just as quickly. She heard the Daoist Master in front of her finally speak:

"The situation is already set. When the Great One returns to his mountain, I have other arrangements. I must retrieve the Dharma swords first, which means I cannot go to retrieve Wang Xiaoxiao. That woman will inevitably fall into someone else's hands. Do not think on it further."
