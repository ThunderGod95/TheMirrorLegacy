# Chapter 682: Ambush (Part 2)

'A fine talisman.'

The talisman in Chi Zhihu’s hand felt extraordinary. It was crafted from a bluish-white paper and inscribed with golden lacquer, but its grade, symbols, and activation incantation were all a mystery. It was useless to him.

Li Xizhi didn’t spare it a second glance. His fingers formed a new seal. He tapped two fingers with his thumb, then shifted his grip to point first toward Mount Luoxia in the west, then to Mount Duan in the east. Three specks of light—emerald, brown, and black-gold—ignited at his fingertips.

His three opponents weren't about to stand by and watch him cast a spell. Chi Zhihu immediately raised his hand, a gleaming white, needle-like Dharma artifact materializing in his palm. Spiritual qi surged into it, but he hesitated, unsure which of the dozen clones to target.

Wu Weibai watched, speechless and utterly exasperated.

'All those years I told you to study the properties of magical arts, but you just slept through the lessons, obsessed only with raw power... Now you’re paying the price!'

Normally, the type of artifact used for detection should have been able to see through Li Xizhi’s illusions. But of all the treasures Chi Zhihu could have brought, he had chosen the Qingmu Mirror, an artifact of Bright Yang profound light.

Many arts could create illusory clones, but when one tried to use an artifact of profound light to see through a technique based on Heavenly Glow, they canceled each other out. The user would see nothing.

'If he had brought the Flowing Light Mirror or the Grand Feather Sword, we wouldn’t be wasting our time on these phantoms!'

While Wu Weibai fumed, Chi Zhihu, though appearing calm, was cursing his luck. The mirror floating above his head shimmered, but he knew its limitations. He wasn't so incompetent as to overlook such a detail, even at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm.

'Ning Hejing borrowed the Flowing Light Mirror, and the Lingu family took the Grand Feather Sword to the Southern Sea to slay demons... The Qingmu Mirror was better than nothing!'

Wu Weibai’s eyes darted about as his hands moved. Being older, he had a wider array of arts at his disposal. While mentally cursing his master, he was already forming a seal. He raised his sword to his lips and chanted:

"Boundless fire, breathe forth the bright apricot... By my command!"

A torrent of apricot-yellow flame erupted from his mouth, swelling into a massive, incandescent sphere in the air. In an instant, it burst like a shattered silver vase, unleashing a countless number of Molten Fire sparks.

The fiery tide washed over the dozen Li Xizhi clones, each of them poised mid-incantation, treading on rosy light. Xia Yun, overjoyed, swiped his own weapon through a nearby clone, dispelling it. "A brilliant technique, Senior!" he shouted.

But then, each Li Xizhi clone formed a seal with one hand and cupped the other. Simultaneously, they all swiped their sleeves, conjuring a wall of iridescent light that met the tide of apricot flame and held it back.

"What?"

The sight made Wu Weibai’s face pale. He had fought Lingu Xia before and had even personally shattered her light clones. Since when could a light clone cast a spell?

Before he could react, Chi Zhihu rashly unleashed the art he had been preparing, striking a random clone. Xia Yun was still maneuvering his artifact, chasing down other phantoms, when Wu Weibai roared, "Defend yourselves!"

Li Xizhi had completed his incantation. Ninety percent of the phantoms in the formation had been dispelled, leaving only his true body and two clones, positioned in a triangle. The rosy light around them pulsed softly.

"Rainbow Pierce!"

The three specks of light—emerald, brown, and black-gold—leapt into the air. They streaked across the sky and descended upon Chi Zhihu, whose face lit up with triumph. "Excellent!" he cried.

A jade stone on the man’s necklace shattered with a crack. A halo of brilliant yellow light erupted from his body, coalescing in mid-air into a three-tailed, feathered beast. It let out a silent roar, and the incoming lights froze, held in place.

Seeing this, all three attackers were ecstatic.

Li Xizhi’s light art had seemed terrifyingly powerful. Wu Weibai was composed enough, having already deployed his own artifact and talismans, but Xia Yun had been scared witless.

He knew that of the three of them, he was the weakest link. By the logic of 'better to sever one finger than injure all ten,' he should have been the first target. The unknown power of the light art had filled him with dread.

But Li Xizhi had chosen Chi Zhihu. As a direct descendant of the Chi family, he was protected by powerful treasures. The rosy light had been instantly neutralized. Chi Zhihu was elated, Wu Weibai was suspicious, but Xia Yun was the most jubilant of all. He raised his Dharma sword and laughed.

"What kind of pathetic trick was that!"

He thrust his sword through a nearby light clone, only to hear Wu Weibai’s horrified cry.

"Look out!"

The old man shot forward, sword raised, but was blocked by a fan that glowed with a faint blue light. From behind the shimmering cover of the three-colored lights, a speck of gold emerged. Li Xizhi himself materialized right in front of Chi Zhihu, hand resting on the hilt of his sword.

"This is bad!"

Though they had witnessed his mastery of magical arts, none of them had forgotten that the Li family was a clan of sword cultivators. Furthermore, throughout the entire exchange, Wu Weibai’s swordsmanship had been a complete joke in front of Li Xizhi, easily parried. It was a clear testament to the young man’s skill with a blade.

The Dharma sword at the Peak Lord of Changtian's waist was no mere ornament.

'He's too close!'

The sight of his opponent appearing before him sent a chill down Chi Zhihu’s spine. His hair stood on end. He frantically reversed his incantation, forcing the fiery spell he had been gathering to dissipate unevenly within his meridians, and slammed his spiritual sense into his necklace.

"Return!"

As Chi Zhihu desperately recalled the three-tailed beast, Wu Weibai saw his master’s peril. Biting the tip of his tongue, he spat out a mouthful of essence blood and roared, "Halt!"

The old cultivator's experience showed. The shout was like a crack of thunder, focused into a single line of force that slammed into Li Xizhi, making him pause for a fraction of a second. It was the opening Chi Zhihu needed. His shock turned to relief, then to joy.

'A perfect chance!'

Wu Weibai had bought him a crucial moment at the cost of injuring himself. The three-tailed beast that had been suppressing the three-colored lights vanished from its spot and reappeared before Chi Zhihu. It lunged with a silent, spectral roar, spewing a mist of golden light that struck Li Xizhi squarely in the face.

'He's been hit by the Gleaming Gold Feather-Beast's pounce! Victory is ours!'

Chi Zhihu knew the power of his own treasure. The jade was an heirloom discovered in a grotto-heaven by an ancestor, and it contained the spirit of the long-extinct Gleaming Gold Feather-Beast. A single breath of its mist was enough to kill an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator. Even someone as skilled as Li Xizhi would not escape unscathed.

'What a stroke of luck...'

He had inadvertently dealt Li Xizhi a massive blow. But before a smile could form on his lips, it was replaced by sheer astonishment.

The Li Xizhi before him dissolved like snow under the morning sun, vanishing without a trace.

"A clone?"

Wu Weibai’s pupils dilated. A single thought consumed his mind.

'The Qingmu Mirror...!'

And indeed, reflected in the old man's eyes was the golden flash of the Gold in Cloud technique. A fair, strong hand materialized from nothing, shimmered into existence, and slapped a swath of rosy light onto the crystalline white mirror Chi Zhihu had left hovering in the air.

"Floating Light Gathering!"

Chi Zhihu's entire focus had been on the three-tailed beast; he was completely unprepared. He felt a sudden emptiness in his chest, then a sharp pang as his spiritual sense took a heavy blow. His connection to the precious mirror weakened.

'His arts... can be used like *that*?!'

With the Qingmu Mirror now in Li Xizhi’s grasp, the clear light that had filled the area vanished. Li Xizhi held the artifact as if it were a struggling sparrow, his grip alternating between light and firm. With his other hand, he unleashed a rosy glow he had already prepared, smashing it onto the mirror's surface.

*Clang...*

The arc of rosy light dissipated into mist. Li Xizhi took a step back and vanished from sight. Before Chi Zhihu could even react, a piteous scream tore through the air.

"Aaaargh!!"

When Chi Zhihu had recalled the Gleaming Gold Feather-Beast, the three-colored lights had been freed. They had immediately changed course and struck Xia Yun.

Xia Yun had only been promoted because of his good relationship with Ning Hejing, and he had opportunistically thrown his lot in with Chi Zhihu. He had some skill, but he never expected Chi Zhihu to retract the feather-beast, leaving him exposed to the attack.

He had amassed a small fortune over the past two years, and several layers of white light flared from protective artifacts on his body. They absorbed some of the impact, and a Foundation Establishment-grade talisman he'd deployed earlier nullified more of the force. But the attack was too sudden; he had no time to prepare further.

Chi Zhihu looked over to see a fist-sized hole blown straight through Xia Yun's head. He could almost see the ocean through the gap. The man stumbled back in a panic, pulling out healing salves and spirit meats to try and patch the wound.

'Zhao is still tangled with that Dawn Rayfish underwater...'

Chi Zhihu could feel the constant ripples of spiritual qi from below. The fight had dragged on, and his will to continue was gone.

'This man's skill with arts is profound... What is Liaokong doing? Why hasn't he acted yet? Does he want to wait until Xia Yun is dead?'

With the Qingmu Mirror stolen, Li Xizhi had once again vanished into the ambient rosy light. Chi Zhihu hastily raised a turtle-shell shield in front of him just as he heard Wu Weibai exclaim with delight, "Huh?"

Chi Zhihu looked up sharply. The figure that had dissolved into golden light had reappeared, stumbling out of the air. A thought dawned on him, and he grinned.

"The Qingmu Mirror is an ancient artifact. It can't be stolen so easily!"

'Gold in Cloud was interrupted...'

Li Xizhi had the mirror in hand. If he could have transformed back into light, his opponents would have been helpless. Unfortunately, the Qingmu Mirror was a high-quality ancient artifact from the Azure Pond Sect. It struggled relentlessly, breaking his movement technique.

As he materialized, Wu Weibai seized the opportunity and charged, his Dharma sword lunging like a venomous, gold-and-silver-ringed serpent. Its patterned blade shimmered, a truly sinister-looking weapon. "Activate the artifact!" the old man yelled.

Taking the cue, Chi Zhihu abandoned the spell he was forming. He closed his eyes and poured all his effort into activating the Qingmu Mirror. The struggling force in Li Xizhi's hand multiplied several times over, forcing him to divert his attention to suppress it.

Li Xizhi’s gaze swept across his opponents, his assessment clear.

'Chi Zhihu has many treasures but little combat experience. Xia Yun is just here to make up the numbers. Only this Wu Weibai is a seasoned fighter... His arts aren't refined, but his cultivation is deep.'

As Wu Weibai closed in, Li Xizhi formed a seal with one hand while his spiritual sense reached out, following the connection to his companion.

"Qiyun!"

*Clang!*

The serpent-like sword was upon him.

The Qingmu Mirror was still stuck to Li Xizhi's hand, so Wu Weibai wasn't worried about him retrieving his own sword. The old man’s eyes were fixed on the composed youth, who calmly held the mirror in one hand while the other rested on his sword hilt.

*Clang!*

An arc of sword energy shot toward the heavens. Wu Weibai's serpent sword was struck, its tail end flying up. Three more agile arcs of moon-white sword energy flew out.

Li Xizhi’s execution of the two stances of the Law of Celestial Moon lacked Li Xijun’s sharp, ethereal grace, but it was undeniably fluid. Wu Weibai didn't understand sword forms; his weapon was more of a spellcasting implement than a proper blade. He scrambled to defend himself.

*Boom!*

The sea below exploded. A column of snow-white water erupted into the sky, and a streak of rosy light shot out of it. The Dawn Rayfish, Li Qiyun, streaked past Li Xizhi, and in that instant, the Qingmu Mirror passed from one's hand to the other.

Freed from the burden, Li Xizhi immediately activated Gold in Cloud, his form once again splitting into dozens of streaks of rosy light that danced and circled within the grand formation.

'He got away...'

The moment Li Qiyun had the mirror, Guest Elder Zhao shot out of the water, his face a mask of fury. He was met by another brilliant blast of rosy light and was hammered back into the sea.

Having lost the Qingmu Mirror, Wu Weibai and Chi Zhihu grew even more cautious amidst the swirling light. Chi Zhihu’s expression was grim. Wu Weibai sighed.

"Your Highness... that spirit beast appears to be a Foundation Establishment Dawn Rayfish. It has little combat power, but it's incredibly difficult to deal with. Zhao Fu is completely tied up; he won't be getting free."

The situation was clear. The three of them were powerless against the master and his companion. If Liaokong didn't intervene soon, they would be lucky to escape with their lives.

"How can his mastery of arts be so profound?!"

Chi Zhihu understood the old guest elder’s implication perfectly, but he couldn’t fathom what madness had seized Liaokong. The monk was still hiding somewhere, refusing to show himself.

As they hesitated, two more streaks of rosy light shot toward them. They both raised their weapons and batted them aside, only to find they were mere illusions.

*Thump!*

A dull thud sounded nearby. Xia Yun’s spiritual presence weakened, and a burst of hazy flame erupted from his body, dispersing some of the rosy light. A deep sense of dread filled Wu Weibai. "Your Highness!" he cried out.

Chi Zhihu was at his wit's end. He possessed powerful artifacts and devastating techniques, yet it felt like punching cotton. He couldn't even find his enemy’s shadow. His anger and fear had reached their peak.

'Do I have to let him go? Was this all for nothing?!'

He stared at the sword energy lashing out from the rosy mist and roared, "Liaokong!"

The sound rolled like thunder, making Li Xizhi wary. The rosy lights pulled back slightly. But after several seconds, there was no response. Chi Zhihu, grinding his teeth, shouted again, "Liaokong!"

Only a dull echo answered him from within the grand formation. Wu Weibai's face changed, his expression turning ugly. "Your Highness, retract the formation and leave at once!" he urged.

Chi Zhihu also sensed something was wrong. Fear crept onto his face as he hastily formed a seal, his spiritual sense connecting to the formation disk in his sleeve.

The brilliant yellow formation in the sky remained perfectly still, an unshakable cage.

Wu Weibai almost coughed up blood. He felt faint. Chi Zhihu tried several more incantations, but the grand formation was as steady as a mountain, not budging an inch. The color drained from his face as well.

A rush of hot blood surged to Wu Weibai's head. He was terrified. The old man trembled, forgetting all decorum. "You couldn't borrow the Flowing Light Mirror and the Grand Feather Sword... could you!" he croaked.

Chi Zhihu looked at him, dazed, as if waking from a dream.

Wu Weibai raised his head in despair. Within the swirling rosy light, the three specks of color—emerald, brown, and black-gold—were gathering once more. Dozens of phantoms flickered with iridescent light, like a pack of starving wolves, poised and ready to devour them.
