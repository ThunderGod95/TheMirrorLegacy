# Chapter 735: Changxiao and Yehui

Yehui traveled through the Great Void for a time before returning to his own White Ye Mountain. Guan Gongxiao was kneeling before the monument at the summit, his forehead pressed firmly to the ground.

“Greetings, Daoist Master,” Guan Gongxiao said respectfully. “Your disciple has failed. We suffered heavy casualties and lost our Dharma Artifacts. I await your punishment!”

“Enough,” Yehui said, silencing him with a wave. His brow furrowed. “This wasn’t your fault. Our objectives were met, and the Profound Peak Gate sustained significant losses. We’ve reclaimed the territory we were due. What does it matter if we lost three Dharma Artifacts? It’s not as if they were ancient relics.”

Guan Gongxiao kowtowed again, about to say more, but with another flick of his hand, Yehui sent him away, leaving not even a shadow behind.

‘A pity about Guan Kan,’ Yehui mused to himself. ‘He was an old hand, yet Li Zhouwei managed to kill him. Still, he served his purpose. It wasn’t a total loss.’

Yehui poured a cup of tea at a stone table and waited. Within a quarter of an hour, a figure stepped out of the Great Void.

The Daoist Master wore a robe adorned with cloud patterns. His face was kind and gentle, giving him the air of a benevolent clan elder, though his eyes were a bit narrow. He sat down at the table, clearly in high spirits.

‘After all that scheming, the old scoundrel finally got what he wanted.’

Despite his cynical thoughts, Yehui smiled warmly. “Greetings, Daoist Friend Changxiao!”

This was none other than Chang Xiaozi, the master of the Changxiao Gate, a renowned figure who had carved a path to the Purple Mansion realm by fighting his way through the Three Sects and Seven Gates.

Changxiao smiled back. “Greetings, my friend. And how fares your third divine ability? The trials of the Purple Mansion are perilous. You must be careful.”

Yehui simply smiled without answering. Instead, he asked, “It has been many years since I last saw Daoist Friend Chengyan. I wonder how he is doing?”

Yehui was a relative newcomer to Jiangbei and hadn't been involved in the Anhuai Heaven incident, but he had heard the stories. He had no personal grudge against Chengyan; he just despised incompetence and enjoyed twisting the knife.

Changxiao understood his meaning perfectly. “Oh, him?” he replied casually. “He found a promising disciple a few years back and seems to think he’s on the verge of a breakthrough. He hasn’t been willing to leave the sect since, just waiting to perfect his second divine ability.”

After a moment’s hesitation, Yehui guided the conversation to the real issue. “We expended a great deal of effort, and my sect made significant sacrifices to achieve this. Did you see what you needed to?”

“I saw it clearly.” A strange, excited light gleamed in Changxiao’s eyes. “Li Zhouwei is indeed tied to a destiny of Metallic Essence. I observed from the side with my Life Divine Ability—it took the form of a White Qilin. My years of suspicion were not unfounded. At last, I have a lead!”

Yehui seemed uninterested in Changxiao’s affairs. He chose his words carefully. “To help you confirm this, I provoked the Li Clan for no reason, lost an elder, and suffered a blow to my reputation. I also failed to sow discord within the Profound Peak Gate, allowing the situation to change… The price was steep.”

“You have my sincerest thanks, Yehui!” Changxiao, still in a fine mood, laughed and cupped his hands. “Si Boxiu is always watching me, and the other clans around the lake resent my presence. Without your righteous assistance, I truly could not have investigated this matter on my own!”

Growing impatient with the pleasantries, Yehui offered a polite smile. “Daoist Friend Changxiao, surely you can give me the Crimson-Headed Profound Soul now!”

“Ah, not so hasty!” Changxiao chuckled. “This matter isn’t concluded yet. Besides, your third divine ability is still incomplete. Do you forget how difficult the path forward is?”

He paused, then shifted his tone. “The Soul-Summoning Lore is a Life Divine Ability. There are plenty of lineages in Jiangnan that teach such arts, yet you’ve never pursued them. You must look down on them, meaning you have something better in your hands—something so formidable that it requires a treasure like the Crimson-Headed Profound Soul. I imagine it’s no easy task. It will likely take you forty or fifty years. Why the sudden urgency?”

“Once this business is properly settled,” he concluded, “I will naturally hand the item over to you.”

‘Empty promises, you old fox.’

Though frustration simmered within him, Yehui merely nodded in agreement. “You may not be aware, Daoist Friend, but I’ve received word that the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea has been inactive for years. The thunder is about to fall, and the situation then will be far more complex. We should resolve this now, while we still can. In a few years, we can retreat into seclusion.”

As a cultivator from the Eastern Sea, how could Yehui not know this? “That’s hardly news,” he said flatly.

Changxiao, well aware of his companion’s prickly nature, simply continued, “But I do have a piece of good news for you.”

He smiled. “Xuanyi and the Chunyi Dao Gate got into a massive brawl. The fighting was so intense it roiled the seas, and even the Dragon King of the Crimson Reef Island had to intervene. If my information is correct, we won’t have to worry about Mount Jingyi for the foreseeable future.”

This, at last, earned a nod from Yehui. Xuanyi was a formidable opponent. If cultivators from Mount Jingyi had intervened, his own Capital immortals Dao might not have been their match. With Xuanyi out of the picture, it was unlikely the core disciples of Mount Jingyi would venture out. How could this not be good news?

After exchanging a few more words, Yehui politely saw Changxiao off. Returning to the table, he stared gloomily in the direction his guest had departed. A long while later, he muttered, “If the Crimson-Headed Profound Soul weren’t so incredibly rare, with that old bastard holding the only one he found in the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven… I wouldn’t be at his mercy.”

“A pity about my Capital immortals Dao lineage… So many of our arts have become useless with the decline of spiritual energy. Otherwise, I wouldn't be in this position. The Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven opens so rarely. Who knows when it will be accessible again? I can’t afford to wait.”

He let out a sharp breath and rubbed his temples, gritting his teeth. “That old scoundrel did this on purpose. Now the feud between my sect and the Li Clan has deepened. By the time this all comes out into the open… even if he doesn't give me a thing, I'll be forced to help him deal with them!”

Truthfully, Yehui had no desire to target the Li Clan. They were a useful buffer against the Azure Pond and Golden Feather Sects. But with Changxi constantly stirring up trouble and Changxiao applying pressure, he felt his options dwindling.

“Some things must be done. I’ll delay Li Ximing, handle this as delicately as possible. As long as Si Boxiu is still alive… I mustn’t push him too far.”

The Li Clan was wary of Yehui, but they didn’t know that the Purple Mansion Daoist Master of the Capital immortals Dao was just as wary of them. He hadn’t even used his full strength in the recent battle, doing just enough to fulfill his obligation to Changxiao.

“The moment I push Li Ximing into Si Boxiu’s arms, the moment I force the Li Clan back to the Azure Pond Sect, I can forget about gaining even the smallest foothold in Jiangnan. Si Boxiu will do everything he can to make the Li Clan dependent on Azure Pond and will interfere directly. Once that man gets involved, I can forget about ever getting my hands on the treasures of Xiaoshi Mountain!”

‘Besides… I came to Jiangbei to establish a sect, not to make enemies! Li Ximing is not even a century old. If Li Zhouwei can’t handle him… that’s even more unsettling.’

After pondering for a long time, Yehui finally set down his jade cup and drew his Dharma sword.

‘The only way to deal with Kong Haiying is through the Xuanmiao Temple. Eliminating him will not only remove a future threat but will also drive a wedge between Xuanmiao and Moongaze. Sumian is the type to appease and de-escalate. This won’t be difficult.’
