# Chapter 352: Arrival of the Cloudliner

The howling north wind was completely isolated outside the enclosed cabin of the Dawn Cloudliner. The wooden chairs on the Cloudliner were cushioned with brocade fabric and enchanted with spells, making them exceptionally comfortable.

"Yi Mountain City..."

Liu Changdie sank into the wooden chair as his gaze lingered on the majestic city below, feeling emotions stirring within him. He thought to himself, In my previous life, I came to this place as an insignificant Qi Cultivator of the second heavenly layer... In this life, I have already reached the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Looking at the ancient city before his eyes, the image of a golden longbow appeared in Liu Changdie's mind, causing him to frown as he was filled with deep confusion.

There are more and more changes... Li Tongya killed Yu Xiaogui with his sword... This is another event that never happened in my previous life. Could the formation I set up for the Li Family have changed everything?

Liu Changdie was originally an ordinary cultivator, but with these memories, he had been living his life smoothly. Now, everything had become unrecognizable, causing him to feel a fearful chill down his spine.

In my previous life, after Li Tongya killed the Maha, he disappeared. The Master Monks of the Lotus Temple besieged Mount Lijing. I had thought of saving them to make them owe me a favor... But now, Li Tongya is still guarding the Li Family, and the bald monks of the Lotus Temple seem to have become recluses.

The Yu Family not only failed to breach the Fei Family's defense, but they also lost Yu Xiaogui. The situation on the lake is entirely different now. My past life's memories are no longer of much use...

As the altitude continued to drop, he felt a sense of confusion, thinking, Now that Li Qinghong is not dead, the Li Family will be even more different. Without the previous life's knowledge and assistance, Li Yuanjiao may not consider me his brother... Fortunately, I have made friends with those from the Xuan generation, so it's not too bad.

Seeing the advantages of his rebirth gradually fading, Liu Changdie began to lose hope.

I do not know if Mufeng and Zhongqing have reached the Qi Cultivation Realm. It seems I still need to return to the Li Family... After all, I am not destined to roam the world alone.

Lost in thought, he felt a slight weight underfoot as clouds appeared beneath him. The man standing at the bow of the ship poked his head inside and said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoists, we have arrived!"

Liu Changdie quickly stood up as they descended upon the city below. He saw a majestic great wall stretching out and covered in intricate runes, forming a unified whole and turning the entire city itself into a grand formation.

"As expected of the city left by the Moonlight Origin Mansion. No other formations of the present era could be compared to it!"

Liu Changdie had lost count of the times he had climbed up and down these city walls in his previous life, but he was still filled with emotion. Looking up, he saw eagles and sparrows circling relentlessly above the land with bones scattered everywhere. In the distance, a dense forest raised waves of leaves in the north wind.

"This is Yi Mountain City!"

Following his memories, Liu Changdie landed at this first stronghold of the Yue State, and he saw the cultivators around the stronghold gathering. He searched carefully and finally saw a middle-aged man carrying a golden bow, who was smiling at him.

"Brother Xuanfeng!"

Liu Changdie ignored the others surrounding him and eagerly went over, saying joyfully, "Congratulations!"

Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow, his gaze lighting up with interest. He asked, "What is there to congratulate about?"

"Hahahaha," Liu Changdie laughed heartily and said, "Senior Tongya has slain the Maha with his sword and forced the retreat of a prestigious clan... His reputation is resounding!"

Most of the cultivators on the stronghold were from around Moongaze Lake. Hearing this, they were all stunned, finding it hard to believe and silently swallowing in fear.

Before Li Xuanfeng could speak, someone asked a question that caught everyone's attention immediately.

"Has Senior already broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm?"

"No..." Liu Changdie replied softly as he gathered everyone to sit down and began to explain in detail. The group listened, occasionally gasping and sighing.

When he mentioned Fei Wangbai's death, Fei Yihe suddenly stood up, his face flushed with disbelief. "How is that possible?! Our Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation isn't just for show! What nonsense are you spouting!" he exclaimed in shock and anger.

Liu Changdie smiled wryly, having anticipated his reaction.

"If you do not believe me, you can go to the other cities and ask around. There is nothing more I can do..."

Seeing Fei Yihe's incredulous expression, Liu Changdie thought to himself, Losing just Fei Wangbai is far better than the entire clan being wiped out!

Li Family.

In the hall, Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping stood with their cupped fists. The middle-aged man at the head wore several medicine pouches at his waist, exuding a gentle demeanor. He stroked his beard with one hand and placed the other on Li Ximing's back, his eyes slightly closed.

"The red haze in the Sea of Qi rises fourfold, Shenyang Mansion harmonizes water and fire, Juque acupoint's spiritual energy flows continuously, and twelve levels of the trachea align in harmony..."

Xiao Yuansi nodded lightly and said warmly, "Congratulations to both of you! This child indeed has a constitution suited for alchemy. His heart fire is balanced and just, making him particularly adept at refining pills that can enhance cultivation and break through barriers. This is quite rare!"

Xiao Yuansi was always gentle and scholarly. Even when facing two juniors, he remained courteous and calm. Li Yuanjiao was overjoyed upon hearing this and replied, "Thank you, Senior!"

Xiao Yuansi chuckled and shook his head, saying kindly, "No need to thank me... but I shall accept it."

He took out a jade slip from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing, explaining, "Your family's Snake Dragon Tree bears fruit annually, and it is a hassle to send it to me each time. I used a private recipe to exchange this Snake Essence Pill formula from my clan... Consider it a meeting gift for Ming'er."

Li Yuanjiao had always heard that this senior took great care of their clan and was trustworthy, which was why he dared to invite him. Unexpectedly, Xiao Yuansi presented such a grand gift, leaving Li Yuanjiao somewhat overwhelmed. "This is too much!" he exclaimed.

Xiao Yuansi laughed, shaking his head. He let out a sigh and said, "No need to be so polite. Since you invited me, I cannot be stingy! I promised Jing'er that I would take good care of your family."

The two brothers wanted to express their gratitude further, but Xiao Yuansi simply waved them off and said, "Our family's ancestor has been away for many years. I had just returned from gathering herbs in the mountains this month, only to hear about Tongya slaying the Maha and forcing the retreat of the Yu Family... What happened?"

Li Yuanjiao felt a chill run through him, thinking to himself, The Xiao Family certainly knows the truth about Li Tongya slaying the Maha... Even if they don't know the specifics of what happened in the end, they must know that our ancestor was used as bait!

Xiao Yuansi's gaze was calm and his eyes gentle, giving no hint of any hidden knowledge. This made Li Yuanjiao feel a cold sweat break out on his back, and he thought to himself, It seems the Xiao Family is intentionally keeping things from him... Should I tell him or not?

He hesitated for a moment, his mind racing with thoughts, feeling deeply apprehensive.

Our Li Family shouldn't be aware of this! Although Xiao Yuansi has good intentions, a gentleman should be forthright. Perhaps Xiao Guitu and the others are using this to test us...

He then shook his head and answered, "Our ancestor returned and immediately went into seclusion. We are not aware of the details; we only know that the Maha was merely a reincarnated body."

Xiao Yuansi gazed intently at him for a moment, then nodded thoughtfully before asking, "I received a letter from my junior sister a while ago. Is it true that you have a child studying under her?"

"Indeed!"

Li Yuanjiao was eager for the change in topic and quickly called Li Xizhi over.

Li Xizhi, dressed in a brocade robe, had a dignified appearance. Although he was not as impressive as his younger brother Li Xijun, he still stood in the courtyard with a certain grace.

"Xizhi greets Senior!" Li Xizhi greeted as he cupped his fist respectfully.

Xiao Yuansi nodded and mused, "Yuan Tuan owes your family a great deal... She will certainly take good care of this child. Do not hesitate to ask her for anything he needs!"

However, he soon let out a sigh.

He glanced down at the shimmering Dragon Coiling Pillar sword hanging from Li Yuanjiao's waist and nodded.

"This Dragon Coiling Pillar has been in the Yuan Family for many years... Even though they have no sword cultivators, they never let it go. Now it has easily come into your family's possession... That speaks volumes."

The Dragon Coiling Pillar was a congratulatory gift from the Yuan Family to Li Tongya when he had achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm. It eventually ended up with Li Yuanjiao, who had never thought much about it.

Xiao Yuansi continued to explain, "The Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest Plain owes your Li Family a great debt. Giving you Dragon Coiling Pillar hardly repays even a fraction of that debt... If you need anything, you can always ask the Yuan Family for help."

Li Yuanjiao felt increasingly suspicious. Instead of feeling pleased, he grew alarmed and narrowed his eyes, asking softly, "I was unaware of this matter... Could you enlighten me, Senior?"

"Well..."

Xiao Yuansi looked uncomfortable, pausing for several seconds before speaking vaguely, "I only recently learned of this... The Azure Crest Manifestation was... originally a substitute for Lake Moon Autumn, which is why my junior sister delayed for so many years... It is a complicated mess, and it is really difficult to explain!"

Seeing the puzzled looks on the faces of the two brothers, Xiao Yuansi changed the topic awkwardly but hastily.

"It has been many years, Yuanjiao. At such a young age, you have already reached the sixth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm!" he suddenly remarked with a forced smile.

"You flatter me, Senior..." Li Yuanjiao responded politely despite his confusion.

Xiao Yuansi chuckled. "Each generation brings forth new talents... Rare, indeed!" he commended, though his words hinted to a deeper meaning behind them.

He then looked at the two juniors with a smile and, with a playful tone, said, "Senior Mutian... he's probably more than just a simple Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, is he not?"

The two brothers exchanged glances, both equally confused. Li Yuanjiao respectfully replied, "The family records do not provide detailed information..."

Xiao Yuansi waved his hand and interrupted him before saying loudly, "I see, never mind then... I still have important matters to attend to, so I won't intrude any longer! Please inform me when Tongya emerges from seclusion."

"Of course!"

The two immediately responded before Xiao Yuansi left by riding the wind. Li Yuanjiao respectfully saw him off beyond the borders, then returned.

The affairs in the hall had already been taken care of. Li Yuanping was holding the alchemy recipe, reading it in deep thought. Seeing Li Yuanjiao stride in, he smiled wryly and said, "Senior Xiao has been so considerate, we have no way to repay him. The Xiao Family indeed has shown great kindness to our family... Moreover, we will still need to rely on the Xiao Family in the future."

Li Yuanjiao responded with a sigh, "Xiao Yuansi is Xiao Yuansi... the Xiao Family is the Xiao Family. Senior Xiao's intentions are protective and caring, but Xiao Guitu may not necessarily feel the same. This matter is not urgent... But how did the Yuan Family come to owe us a favor?"

"It seems to be related to the sword immortal... Lake Moon Autumn is the sword immortal's Dao foundation. Perhaps Yuan Tuan owed a favor? It is just a pity we cannot ask the ancestor..."

The two pondered about the matter for a little while longer but ultimately lacked information and could not deduce much, so they had to give it up.

Li Yuanjiao picked up a jade slip, assessed it with his spiritual sense, and said warmly, "This Golden Temple Radiant Origin Manual is indeed excellent, and the Radiant Origin Pass has many wonders. However, collecting the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth known as Golden Yang Radiant Origin is quite difficult."

Li Yuanping had also read this technique and immediately responded, saying, "This Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth indeed sounds extraordinary! Fortunately, the technique also includes methods for gathering this qi. Otherwise, such ancient spiritual qi would be impossible to find even if we turned Yue State upside down."

Li Yuanjiao laughed and shook his head, reading aloud, "Seek a pass extending for thousands of li in the desert... wait until dusk when the wind and sand are calm, and the sunset is half-set. Then, use your mana to extract the power of the glowing sun. There is only a moment to obtain this energy... requiring two years to get a wisp, and ten wisps to make one portion."

"Ancient methods are indeed troublesome!"

Li Yuanping sighed and reminded him, "It is even more than that. The Golden Yang Radiant Origin must not come into contact with gold, iron, copper, water, or wood; otherwise, it will transform into Scorching Smoke Qi... It also requires a fine jade box for storage."

"That is not a concern."

Li Yuanjiao still had a Purple Mansion Realm jade box that Li Tongya had found on the island in the heart of the lake, and it was more than sufficient to store the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi. He was now considering where to find such a pass.

"Brother, put these matters aside for now. The Dawn Cloudliner is arriving!" Li Yuanping said as he shook his head slightly.

————

The golden cloudliner glowed brilliantly, its golden wings cutting through layers of clouds. It glided over the dark green lake water, reflecting dazzling golden light.

At the front of the Dawn Cloudliner, a youth in simple green attire stood quietly. His features bore a strong resemblance to Yu Mugao, but while Yu Mugao's expression was often harsh and sinister, this man's face was calm and serene.

"Moongaze Lake, formerly known as the Moongaze Marsh..."

The Dawn Cloudliner docked slowly in Milin Prefecture. Yu Muxian stood with his hands behind his back, his ethereal demeanor making his simple clothing appear elegant and dynamic. Just by standing there, he drew the gazes of all the cultivators on the ship.

Yu Muxian had been away from home for over twenty years, making it hard to recognize the familiar landscape beneath his feet. He gazed down in indifference, continuously playing with the jade buckle in his hand.

The jade buckle was as clear as ice, emitting a faint moonlight-like glow as he twirled it in his hand. Yu Muxian's eyes gazed steadily forward, seemingly observing something in silence.

"Moongaze Lake... truly a blessed land."

The jade buckle in his hand glimmered faintly with colored light, and the immortal foundation within him, the Molten Metal Cave, continued to operate. Shadows appeared in his pupils as he counted silently, "The Yu Family's Jade Smoke Mountain, the Li Family's Qingche Sword, and Daoist He's Nine Gates Temple."

"Hmm?"

A trace of purple light flashed in Yu Muxian's eyes, and he smiled slightly, whispering to himself, "Oh... there is also a hidden spear!"

He withdrew his gaze and glanced around him, raising an eyebrow in curiosity.

"A minor Mount Yue cultivator possessing a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact... Ah, he must be from Duanmu Kui's Mount Wu, I guess it's no surprise they'd have one or two valuable items on hand!"

Yu Muxian examined for a while, then frowned with a hint of disdain in his eyes, envisioning the mountains of corpses and seas of blood. He thought to himself, The Mountain of Human Heads... what a sinister dharma artifact!

Despite his disdain, Yu Muxian could not help but admire the clever design of the artifact. He then mused, There are ten Foundation Establishment Realm legacies and five Foundation Establishment Realm artifacts around this lake. Aside from the three sects and seven gates, no place in Yue State is richer than Moongaze Lake!

While he was lost in thought, the Dawn Cloudliner came to a gentle stop. Yu Muxian disembarked slowly, hearing a chorus of respectful greetings from the mountain below.

"Welcome, Emissary!"

Yu Muxian looked up to see a crowd of bowing cultivators. He rubbed the jade buckle and responded, "No need for formalities!"

The cultivators straightened up right away and returned to their seats. A middle-aged cultivator with a haggard face but hawk-like, piercing eyes that were full of sinister intensity approached Yu Muxian, bowing deeply and cupping his fist.

"Yu Mugao of the Milin Yu Family greets the Emissary!"

This man was his older brother by blood.

"Rise."

Yu Muxian's icy demeanor faltered slightly as he gazed at Yu Mugao, who slowly lifted his head.

Yu Mugao spoke respectfully and courteously, "Thank you, Emissary."

The two brothers locked eyes for a moment, their gazes clashing in silence—one with a hawk-like gaze, the other as cold as snow. Their faces bore a striking resemblance, yet their auras were entirely different.
