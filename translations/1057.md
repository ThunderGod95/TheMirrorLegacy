# Chapter 1057: Silver Light

Simin.

The morning sun scattered its light across the stacked eaves of the grand pavilions, making the newly constructed official residence seem majestic and imposing. Several carriages hurriedly pulled up before the estate, and servants began unloading large, heavy chests, carrying them one by one into the mansion.

"Your Excellency, we've arrived at Adjutant Li's residence."

A servant leading the procession bowed his head and spoke softly. The carriage curtain was immediately drawn back, and a man stepped out. Dressed in robes of azure and white, with handsome features, his presence was unforgettable. A mark of violet-blue adorned the space between his brows, etched with the intricate pattern of a purple-gold python. He nodded to the attendant at the gate.

"Please inform your master that Li Jiangliang, Grand Emissary of the Profound from the Palace of Revering Martial Arts, requests an audience."

The attendant vanished inside, taking the steps two at a time. Moments later, a powerfully built young man strode out from the mansion's interior. Cupping his fists in a salute at the entrance, he said,

"Greetings, Your Excellency!"

Li Jiangliang raised an eyebrow. Their golden eyes met for an instant, and he smiled.

"It has been a long time, brother. You haven't changed a bit."

Li Jiangxia watched him quietly for a moment before breaking into a wide grin. 

"Please, come in, Your Excellency."

Li Jiangliang dismissed his entourage, instructing them to carry the lavish gifts inside. He followed his brother through the halls and into the main chamber. Once they were seated in the opulent residence, he sighed.

"You've grown so distant, brother."

"Oh?" Li Jiangxia heard this and let out a hearty laugh, his golden eyes radiating a frank and magnanimous air. He shook his head.

"I am not Li Jianglong. I don't hold such petty grudges. I am immensely proud of the heights you've reached today. This isn't distance; it's a matter of status. You dared to take risks, to forge your own path, and you obtained a divine ability. You have earned the title of 'Your Excellency.'"

The violet-blue mark between his fourth brother's brows had grown deeper, and his aura had clearly surpassed the Foundation Establishment Realm, pulsing with the might of a divine ability.

When Yang Zhuo became emperor, he was clearly one of the first to reap the rewards.

But Li Jiangliang disagreed with his words. He shook his head.

"You're wrong, brother. It has nothing to do with daring to take risks. The current situation simply has a use for me. I am well aware of my own capabilities."

Though Li Jiangxia was only in the Foundation Establishment Realm, his presence seemed even weightier than his brother's. He chuckled and replied, 

"The Emperor's rewards are generous indeed—power, a grand residence, spiritual resources, beautiful women... I feel I am unworthy of them."

At this, Li Jiangliang's expression turned serious.

"The Emperor has mentioned to me several times that among all his generals, he favors you the most. He intends to promote you past your rank, to have you enter the palace and become a Holder of the Profound... Compared to that, this residence and these resources are nothing."

The positions within the Purple and Gold Palace were not granted all at once but were awarded based on territory and authority. The highest rank was Holder of the Profound. Yang Zhuo's intention was clear: he wanted Li Jiangxia to be the foremost of his military commanders.

Seeing his brother's noncommittal expression, Li Jiangliang sighed softly. Li Jiangxia, however, was more interested in his divine ability. His gaze narrowed as he asked,

"What is your... current state?"

Li Jiangliang lifted his brows.

"My official post is Grand Emissary of the Profound from the Palace of Revering Martial Arts. I am also the Emissary of the True Light Cloud, the Founding Duke of Li Province, and a Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, blessed by the Tianwu divine ability. Though I don't have a specific, tangible ability, I possess the wonders of True Qi, the station of the Purple Mansion Realm, and the ability to traverse the Great Void..."

Li Jiangxia's eyes narrowed further.

"The Merciful One?"

His fourth brother shook his head, his tone grave.

"I should be a cut above that. Somewhere above the Golden Lotus Seat, but below Maha."

This made Li Jiangxia's expression turn solemn.

"That is more than enough... What about your own divine ability? I seem to recall... you cultivate Li Fire, do you not? Is there still a chance for you to attain a divine ability? What are your odds?"

Hearing this, a flicker of hesitation crossed Li Jiangliang's face.

"My immortal foundation is perfected, nourished daily by the wonders of True Qi. It grows more flawless by the day. But I know my own Dao-Profundity is lacking. I estimate... it will be at least a decade before I can attempt to break through to the divine ability level."

Li Jiangxia set down his cup, a trace of suspicion in his mind. He raised an eyebrow.

"You can still form a divine ability!"

Li Jiangliang did not deny it.

"Correct. In fact, this blessing is quite beneficial to my cultivation. Once I achieve my own divine ability, the two will combine, and my power will instantly surpass that of an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator with a single divine ability!"

Li Jiangxia was silent for a long moment before asking,

"How many official posts do you hold now?"

"The Emperor commands water and fire," Li Jiangliang explained.

"Water represents the civil ministers, and fire the military officials. The Palace of Revering Martial Arts, where I serve, is essentially a military institution for defending against external threats. If you really want to get into specifics, I suppose I'm half a military official now, with the additional honorary title of Founding Provincial Duke... You could say I am the head of all officials."

Li Jiangxia let out a heavy breath.

"Why did the Emperor send you here? What does he want?"

Li Jiangliang's face was serious.

"The Emperor wishes to welcome you as a Holder of the Profound but lacks a suitable pretext. He has considered that the various Shaman Kingdoms in the Southern Borderlands have yet to submit. He wishes to dispatch troops to pacify the six bordering states, thereby securing the rear for the Jinghai Military Commissioner."

He flicked his sleeve, extending his arm forward.

"The tiger tally and seal are outside," he said softly. "If you accept them, brother, you can depart as a Holder of the Profound and guard a domain. As long as the Emperor does not recall you, you may act as a Holder of the Profound in his stead, with the same authority as the rest of us!"

In Li Jiangliang's eyes, Yang Zhuo's favoritism toward Li Jiangxia was glaringly obvious. It wasn't just an appreciation for his character and conduct; it involved much more...

'Second Brother was brought back by General Yang and is clearly a trusted confidant, but I have no idea what benefits General Yang promised him... Second Brother is extremely cautious. After seeing the Emperor... he was quickly dispatched to lead troops, and we only met briefly...'

Whether his second brother had sided with Yang Ruiyi, Li Jiangliang couldn't be sure. But the Song Emperor was clearly uninterested in him. Instead, he showed great favor to this third brother, who had arrived in the imperial capital later and had a much bolder personality. Li Jiangliang wouldn't dare say there was a conflict between the Song Emperor and the Yang family, but at the very least... the Emperor did not want the Yangs to have too much influence.

For that reason, Li Jiangliang had long been certain that his third brother, Li Jiangxia, would become a Holder of the Profound before his second brother. Still, when he received the order this morning, he had been utterly shocked.

'This is far too rushed...'

His expression was complicated. Faced with the temptation his fourth brother presented, Li Jiangxia showed little excitement. Instead, he stared intently into those golden eyes and said softly,

"Liang'er, you're finally acting like one of our Li family."

The words caught Li Jiangliang off guard, but he recovered instantly with a slight smile.

"I thought you might say I was acting like Guest Retainer Cui."

Li Jiangxia laughed and rose to his feet, walking over to the window. He shook his head.

"Among us five brothers, only Jiangnian is unremarkable, a mere mortal. The one least like us is Li Jiangqian—you probably don't know this, do you? Our eldest brother is vicious. He is the most unscrupulous of all. When he gets ruthless, there is nothing he won't sacrifice."

He took a step forward, emphasizing his next words. "Absolutely nothing."

A thoughtful look appeared on Li Jiangliang's face. Li Jiangxia continued with a smile,

"Li Jianglong, your second brother, refuses to submit to him in his heart, but he knows he's just like our eldest brother. He cherishes his life and is selfish, but he lacks that final, cruel edge. That's why I don't like him."

"But you and I are more alike. At least... I've read the records. After the army passed, devastation was left in its wake, and only you and I would give any thought to the mortals. The messages you sent home, Eldest Brother sneered at them, but I believed you. You said you joined the Song to fulfill your ambitions, and I believe that too."

"I also know that you feel guilty."

Li Jiangliang froze as if struck by lightning, staring blankly at his brother, who simply smiled.

"But there is no need."

"With the rise of Tianwu, it's less that I was forced to come to Simin and more that I came with ambitions of my own. In this, we are both like our father."

He pushed open the doors of the hall. His gaze fell upon the golden tiger tally and the violet-blue seal resting on a jade platter, held by an attendant of the Profound. His voice was calm.

"Neither of us can just wait for our doom under his wings—no one's ambition is greater, more arrogant, or demands more sacrifice than his."

---

As the sun began to set, the white funeral banners before the hall fluttered, casting fragmented slivers of gold into the shadows. Li Suining had been waiting in the corridor for some time when he saw Li Zhoufang hurry out of the hall.

Li Qiuyang had been an important figure, but for most of the Li family, his life or death was of little consequence. No one truly cared. The funeral had taken on an oddly festive atmosphere. Even for a direct descendant like Li Zhoufang, there was little grief on his face as he emerged from paying his respects, only a hint of concern for Li Xuanxuan's health.

Following behind the middle-aged man was a youth who was looking around distractedly. The top of his robes was carelessly tucked into his sash, a sliver of the white inner lining showing, giving him a listless appearance.

It was Li Suiqing.

Li Suining sighed inwardly.

Li Zhoufang had been overjoyed when his son, Li Jiangzong, became the head of the clan. It wasn't about status among his peers; it was simple pride that his child was capable and could serve the family. But now, after several years in seclusion, Li Suining could see that Li Zhoufang had aged considerably. All that remained was a profound exhaustion.

He brightened slightly upon seeing Li Suining, but his grandson, clearly bored out of his mind, looked ready to bolt. Li Zhoufang shot him a glare, but the boy wasn't afraid. He stared right back, about to speak. Li Zhoufang gritted his teeth, a bitter feeling rising in his heart.

'My boy... your cousin here is exceptionally talented. You, a good-for-nothing, will have to rely on him in the future... If you don't build a better relationship now, what will you stand on later in life!'

But afraid of making a scene, he could only wave his hand in dismissal and tell him to get lost. Turning back to Li Suining's smiling face, he sighed.

"I've made a fool of myself."

Li Suining shook his head. The elder immediately took his hand and began walking, his voice laced with worry.

"Over the years, Suiqing's incompetence and foul nature have only worsened. Your Uncle Jiangzong only has this one son. I've tried to discipline him, again and again, but the more I try, the more I realize he's a lost cause..."

Just as Li Suining was about to speak, Li Zhoufang waved his hand.

"Don't you try to comfort me with stories about Zhouming. It's not the same. Zhouming might have been a bit of a troublemaker in his youth, but he always had a smile for us. His heart wasn't bad."

"But Suiqing... I don't know where he gets this stubborn streak. His mind is twisted, and the more you scold him, the more vicious he becomes. Even when we drag him to the Court of Justice, unless you beat him to death on the spot, he'll still have that fierce, malevolent look in his eyes."

He stared at Li Suining, his eyes glistening.

"The old master and I still think he can be saved, but your Uncle Jiangzong scolds him every time he sees him. He's told me in private more than once that he truly has the urge to kill him with a single palm strike."

Li Suining knew his younger cousin was a disappointment who had brought much gossip upon their family, but he didn't think killing him was the solution. He bowed slightly.

"Just keep him under restraint and don't let Uncle see him..."

Li Zhoufang shook his head bitterly.

"My talent is abysmal. I can't even touch the possibility of Foundation Establishment. A couple of years ago, I tried to advance by hastily taking some pills, but all it did was rattle my sea of qi and greatly damage my vitality. I can't avenge my blood feuds myself. Only King Wei remembered me and killed Nu Xiao for me. But I still harbor this hatred, feeling it's not enough, still hoping for a greater revenge. But seeing Suiqing in this state, I feel so ashamed, and my hatred feels even more helpless."

He vented his emotions in a rush of words, then shook his head, looking somewhat dazed, and forced a smile.

"You are about to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm... I have already reported it to the Daoist Master. He specifically asked for you to visit Gardenia Scenery Mountain. He must be preparing pills for you."

Li Suining felt a pang of sympathy for him, but he couldn't find any comforting words. He could only nod silently before riding the wind toward Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

From a distance, he could see the mountain covered in white flowers. He was in no mood to admire the scenery, his mind filled with troubled thoughts. He landed at a pavilion at the foot of the mountain and found someone was already there.

The man was dressed in a feather cloak of azure and gold and wore a dark green ceremonial cap. His attire was exquisitely crafted and magnificent, lending an air of authority that compensated for his otherwise average looks. His face was like white jade, his aura full and vibrant as he stood with his hands behind his back.

Li Suining was startled for a moment, but when he saw the man's golden eyes, he realized who it was and quickly spoke.

"Second Uncle!"

It was Li Jianglong, returned from the Song court.

With just a brief glance, Li Suining could tell that his cultivation was exceptionally complete, his presence formidable, and faintly connected to the Martial Cultivation Star in the heavens. He knew at once that his uncle had entered the Purple and Gold Palace. Though he was not yet a Holder of the Profound, a divine ability was within his reach. It was undoubtedly a joyous occasion. He immediately offered his congratulations.

"Congratulations, Second Uncle!"

A subtle shift occurred in Li Jianglong's expression, as if he were trying to discern the true meaning behind the words. He gave a slight nod.

"Thank you for your thoughts, Suining."

Li Suining smiled at him, but the smile slowly faded as a strange feeling crept over him. To be rewarded for military merit and given an important position should be a time of great triumph, yet his second uncle seemed far from pleased. In fact, he looked somber, almost melancholic.

Li Suining's arrival did little to distract him. His hand rested on his wrist, fingers tapping lightly, betraying an inner turmoil.

Just then, a garden attendant arrived at the pavilion, bowed, and invited them inside.

Li Ximing was not one for extravagance. The mountain retreat exuded the serene atmosphere of the Immortal Dao. The Daoist Master sat quietly, a tall alchemy furnace placed beside him. Lively red and white flames danced at its base, occasionally pulsing with a terrifying power.

To his surprise, another Daoist Master was seated at the table. Dressed in dark green robes, he had a smile on his face but seemed slightly reserved. The moment the two arrived, his eyes fixed on Li Jianglong.

It was Guo Nanwu.

Li Jianglong didn't recognize him, but Li Suining instantly grew wary.

'It's Daoist Master Nanwu. Did he join the lake this early...?'

Among all the Daoist Masters, Daoist Master Yuanbian was the closest to the Li family, but he guarded the Eastern Sea and never entered the mainland. Of those who did visit the lake, Daoist Master Nanwu and another, Daoist Master Kuang Yu, came most often.

But the power of a Daoist Master was immense. He didn't dare let his thoughts wander and quickly lowered his head.

Guo Nanwu had been handling a matter for the Li family. He had just returned from Poluoduo, where he had been sent to deal with the Radiant Crimson Fiendfire that Li Ximing had obtained from Minghui. The Radiant Crimson Fiendfire was a fine item, but it had been meddled with by Buddhist cultivators for a century, making it troublesome to handle. Li Ximing had consulted the fire sparrow, Huo Yang, but she had shown little interest.

It was understandable. Li Ximing was after other spiritual flames, and besides the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame, Huo Yang surely had others that were no worse than the Radiant Crimson Fiendfire. From her perspective, why would she go through the trouble of trading a perfectly good spiritual flame for one that had been tainted by Buddhists for a hundred years? Even Li Ximing would have difficulty purifying it, let alone anyone else.

The trip had been fruitless. He had only managed to acquire some spiritual materials from Huo Yang to refine pills for her. With Tu Longjian yet to return, Li Ximing had no choice but to accept the outcome.

'Finding a fool to take this off my hands is proving difficult. In the end, I'll have to deal with it myself. Once it's cleansed, I can use it or wait for a buyer... At least it will have a purpose, instead of being stuck in my hands like it is now.'

So he had tasked Guo Nanwu with traveling to the Eastern Sea to trade for some spiritual resources. Guo Nanwu had agreed but had lingered, asking about Li Jianglong's whereabouts.

The Song court still held many secrets from the Purple Mansion cultivators, and the Daoist Masters of the Southern Sea remained restless. It was clear that this Daoist Master had come specifically to see Li Jianglong. Since Li Ximing also needed to see him, he had casually invited him up.

"This is Li Jianglong," he said with a smile.

As he made the introduction, he examined Li Jianglong closely. He sensed that within the man's Bright Yang Qi, layers upon layers of the wonders of True Qi were faintly visible, constantly nurturing his cultivation. He placed two fingers together, and World's Radiance responded, a flicker of invisible light dancing at his fingertips.

Activating his Life Divine Ability, he finally perceived the abnormality in Li Jianglong.

'His fate is irregular.'

After achieving his Life Divine Ability, Li Ximing had secretly observed Li Zhouwei and found his divine ability to be overwhelmingly powerful, like a blazing sun in the mortal world. But Li Jianglong was different. A faint purple light clung to him, as if connected to some profound and mysterious treasury.

Li Ximing retracted his divine ability and asked,

"Nanwu, what do you see?"

Guo Nanwu nodded slightly. He cultivated the 'Heretical Seeking' path of the Lesser Yang Dao, giving him wondrous abilities in observation and travel, as well as the great divine art of transforming Lesser Yang into Yin. His insight was exceptionally sharp. With a single glance, a sense of crisis welled up in his heart. A sudden premonition struck him, and he transmitted his thoughts via his divine ability.

"If I were to kill him, a calamity would surely befall me!"

"How formidable... No wonder they aren't worried about the Buddhists making a move. Forget converting him... even harboring killing intent is extremely unwise."

Li Ximing's eyes narrowed slightly. He had already gleaned a great deal.

Guo Nanwu also felt the pressure of the Martial Cultivation Star, but this made him feel truly strange... for one simple reason: he felt absolutely no threat from the star itself.

Li Ximing watched for a long time without speaking. After his observation, Guo Nanwu seemed to have his answers. He stood up and took his leave.

Li Ximing's expression remained neutral as he bid him farewell with a smile, showing no sign of anything unusual. Li Jianglong, meanwhile, bowed deeply. 

"Congratulations on emerging from seclusion, Daoist Master, and for achieving your great divine ability!"

Li Ximing's smile widened. "I should be congratulating you! Tell me, how much wondrous power have you gained?"

Li Jianglong's expression was composed as he replied respectfully,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, this junior has only just entered the court. The Emperor has appointed me as an administrator in the Palace of Revering Martial Arts, a minor cultivator in the Purple and Gold Palace, and the Prefect of Jiangjuan Prefecture, to lead the Great Song's forces in defense, support Ting Province, and await the orders of my father and the Great General!"

The so-called Jiangjuan Prefecture was located in what was now the Wilderness, which meant it was close enough to be considered a support for Moongaze Lake. Li Ximing quickly understood the South's intentions.

"As for wondrous abilities," Li Jianglong continued, "I cannot compare to my fourth brother. I have merely gained control over a few methods of True Qi and some enhancement to my cultivation. I must achieve further merit to advance."

Li Ximing asked with great interest, "And how is Jiangliang?"

Li Jianglong lowered his voice.

"Fourth Brother is now the head of all officials, a Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, and wields the Tianwu divine ability! He is already in the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Li Ximing held his breath, his heart a storm of complex emotions. He sighed inwardly.

'The pursuit of the Dao... is nothing but the cultivation of one's life-mandate. But if this life-mandate is not cultivated by oneself, but is bestowed by another, how is it any different from the Merciful One or Maha!'

'And yet... it is achieved so easily! The entire world will surely flock to it in a frenzy.'

His expression was complicated. Li Jianglong, on the other hand, looked somewhat apprehensive.

"As for these wondrous abilities... I'm afraid I cannot demonstrate them for you, Daoist Master..."

Li Ximing frowned.

"Why not?"

Li Jianglong gave a helpless smile and shook his head.

"Father is blessed by the Mandate of Heaven and has been enfeoffed by the Emperor. Within the state, he is sovereign. The Martial Cultivation Star does not interfere. Even the highest-ranking immortal official of the court would be stripped of his power upon entering our state of Wei... Not only would he lose the status of Holder of the Profound, but even the divine abilities that aid cultivation would be gone!"

"Oh?"

A theory Li Ximing had been pondering was suddenly confirmed. Understanding slowly dawned on him, though a shred of doubt remained.

'So it's true? Does it really work like that? Even the North can be bathed in the light of the Martial Cultivation Star, yet this enfeoffment has such a strange effect... Does it only apply to lands granted through feudal partition?'

Though puzzled, his face remained calm. He put on a look of sudden realization and smiled.

"I see... It seems none of you brothers are suited to stay on the lake."

Li Jianglong lowered his head slightly.

"The Daoist Master's insight is sharp. The Great General's recommendation for me to be the Prefect of Jiangjuan Prefecture was made with precisely this in mind. I can both receive the light of the Martial Cultivation Star and watch over the lake. It's the best of both worlds..."

Li Ximing listened for a while, then turned his attention to the alchemy furnace as if to adjust the heat, leaving Li Jianglong kneeling. After a long period of contemplation, his mind was made up.

'I must use the Immortal Artifact to see the truth!'

With a thought, he shifted his gaze slightly. His spiritual sense converged, and he reached out to the Immortal Artifact.

The world before him opened up. The purple light around Li Jianglong grew thin, and he could see strands of purple silk erupting from his Shengyang Acupoint, scattering into the air like snapped strings.

'It seems that here, the power of the Martial Cultivation Star is like rootless water... unable to connect to the star in the heavens... It is just as he said, because this is the land of a vassal...'

He felt no joy, only a sudden chill.

'If so... do the rules of the Martial Cultivation Star even apply on the lake?'

If the rule that punished those who harbored killing intent was also nullified here, it meant the North could slaughter the people of Moongaze Lake with impunity...

His heart grew heavy, but he didn't press the matter. As he slowly averted his gaze, a flash of silver light suddenly slammed into his vision.

Kneeling to the side, as if he were part of the scenery, Li Suining's body was glowing with an intense silver light, a hundred times thicker than the faint martial cultivation light on Li Jianglong. It was so brilliant it was almost blinding.

In that instant, Li Ximing felt as if he had discovered a demon hiding beside his own bed. The hair on his body stood on end, and a thousand terrifying possibilities flooded his mind. A profound sense of crisis washed over him, and he almost leaped to his feet.

'What?!'
