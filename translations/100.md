# Chapter 105: The Great Drought

Mu Jiaoman sat in the huge empty carriage, enduring the countless jolts and shakes caused by the rough terrain in Mount Yue’s territory. The scene from the white jade platform was replaying endlessly in his mind.

Drawing back the curtain, Mu Jiaoman scanned the parched and cracked land with the scorching sun hanging in the sky.

“When was the last time it rained?” he asked loudly at the top of his voice.

“In four months, General!”

Mu Jiaoman pondered for a moment before he motioned for his subordinates.

"Withdraw the eastern defenses and drive the vagrants eastward, let them torment the strange people there,” he commanded.

One of his subordinates hesitated for a moment.

“But if we withdraw the eastern defense line and Li Xiangping escapes...” the subordinate’s voice trailed off, his tone filled with concern.

“That bastard is dead!” Mu Jiaoman roared, fury coursing through him.

With a violent motion, he grabbed the man by the neck fiercely with a scowl.

"How many times do I have to tell you?! That bastard is dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!” he screamed in anguish.

His eyes turned red from the anger and was just about to strike down on the man when he was stopped by his subordinates around him dropping to their knees.

“Greetings, Great King!” their voices crying out in unison.

Confused, Mu Jiaoman then slowly lifted his head to see Jianixi, who was looking down at him coldly.

Mu Jiaoman hurriedly flung the man aside and fell to his knees, pressing his forehead to the ground as color drained from his lips.

“Great King!” he stuttered.

Jianixi approached him, his gaze piercing and ferocious. Without a warning, he lashed out, delivering a strong kick to Mu Jiaoman’s body.

“Worthless!” he yelled angrily.

Mu Jiaoman was sent flying like a ball, crashing into several carriages. Rice and grain spilled onto the ground as he lay there, his men watching in fearful silence.

After tumbling a few times, Mu Jiaoman hurriedly scrambled back to his feet and slapped himself across the face.

Jianixi watched him for a moment before erupting into a scornful laugh.

“He was merely a cultivator of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, yet you and your men couldn’t even deal with him, and had to end up hiring a talisman shaman to kill him through a curse. You truly are a disappointment, Mu Jiaoman...” he sneered.

Mu Jiaoman numbly slapped himself as Jianixi’s voice echoed from above.

“You won’t be participating in the Great Sacrifice Ritual that’s happening in a few days. Use this time to stay in the camp and reflect on your actions.”

Mu Jiaoman snapped his head up suddenly, coming to a sudden realization.

But before he could speak, Jianixi struck him with a hard blow to his abdomen which immediately sent him into unconsciousness.

“Drag him away,” Jianixi ordered in a low voice as he watched Mu Jiaoman be hauled off to the camp.

Turning toward the towering Mount Wu,

“Live,” he murmured, his voice so soft it was barely audible.

————

After making a round in the mountain forest, Li Tongya rose from the desolate stronghold and pondered as the morning sun illuminated the sky.

“The absence of rising smoke in the east suggests that the Mount Yue Army has withdrawn... how could Mu Jiaoman allow Xiangping to return east so easily...?”

Swiftly traversing east, he noted the barren land beneath his feet, realizing it had been nearly half a year since the last rainfall.

“It’s no wonder there are so many Mount Yue vagrants.”

Li Tongya frowned, assessing the situation in Mount Yue’s territory and considering the likelihood of the stragglers crossing the border.

“The granaries of the Li Family have been abundant in recent years, capable of supporting a few thousand vagrants... however, a prolonged drought may deplete the Meiche River and threaten the food production...”

“The Ji Family’s letter also mentioned the sacrifice. I suspect Jianixi doesn’t have much time to spare...”

As Li Tongya ventured deeper into Mount Yue’s territory, he encountered increasingly parched land and trees that had no barks. In the distance, the imposing silhouette of the Great Jueting slowly emerged.

The lone city within Mount Yue bore the scars of time, its weather-beaten walls now showing signs of decay both inside and out.

At the edge of the city stood a towering altar made of soil, wood, and stone — its construction almost complete. It was rumored that Jianixi would be offering sacrifices to the heavens there, aiming to unite the world under a single cause.

Despite their weary appearance, the craftsmen laboring on the altar exuded hope and reverence, eagerly anticipating Jianixi to end the war and bring them stability.

“This is as far as I can go,” Li Tongya murmured to himself, coming to a halt. His search this time was as fruitless as his last. Deciding to turn back, he reluctantly retraced his steps toward Moongaze Lake.

Moongaze Lake had receded dramatically — its dry, cracked riverbed littered with the carcasses of dead fish and shrimp. The stench was so putrid and pungent that one could hardly keep their eyes open.

With jackals and vultures scavenging for food, the area looked no different than a desolate wasteland. Li Tongya only made one quick round around the lake before immediately making his way back to Mount Lijing.

Upon his return, Li Tongya was greeted by the sight of a massive black pig’s carcass sprawled in the courtyard. Its glossy fur still glistened in the sunlight and its tusks — long as an adult’s arm and as white as jade — protruded prominently.

Meanwhile, as Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan diligently performed the Spirit Sealing Technique on the pig’s joints and acupoints, Li Xuanfeng leaned against a huge rock and cleaned his bow.

“Second Uncle!” Li Xuanfeng exclaimed as he spotted Li Tongya’s descent.

With a bow in one hand and a hemp bag in the other, he pushed himself from the rock and straightened, his face beaming with excitement.

“This mountain pig demon is really huge, with strength at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm! It should provide a hearty addition to our meal!”

Li Tongya chuckled softly before inspecting the demon pig with his spiritual sense. He noticed a long, black, gleaming arrow embedded in its brain. It was the only mark of injury present in its otherwise pristine flesh.

“Just one shot?” he asked in surprise.

“Yep!” Li Xuanfeng confirmed proudly, his head held high. With one swift motion, he slung his long bow behind him and bent down, pulling out the long arrow from the pig demon’s empty eye socket.

He flung away the red and white matter that clung to it before continuing.

“I chased this pig demon the entire night! Finally at dawn, while it was gnawing on wood and bamboo, I shot an arrow that pierced its eye and its brain which killed it instantly!”

“Good job,” Li Tongya nodded approvingly as he heard this. However, he added a word of caution.

“Although this mountain pig demon may seem easy prey for your arrows, remember to stay cautious. Despite its swift demise by your hand, such creatures can still pose a threat. Be wary and hunt demons of the lower cultivation realm to hone your skills.”

Li Xuanfeng heeded Li Tongya’s caution, but a hint of defiance lingered in his expression.

“But this demon couldn’t even touch the hem of my shirt!” he said defensively.

Li Tongya chuckled and patted Li Xuanfeng’s shoulder affectionately, amused by his defiance.

“I know you’re skilled with your bow... in our family, only your youngest uncle’s swordsmanship could rival your talent. But you have to remember, the human body is vulnerable,” he emphasized once more, and his tone had a hint of gentleness.

As Li Tongya observed Li Xuanfeng’s serious demeanor, he decided to speak once more.

“Though cultivators at the Embryonic Breathing Realm possess strength akin to an ox, capable of feats like moving heavy objects and scaling walls, they remain far weaker than demonic creatures. I’ve faced many adversaries of the Qi Cultivator Realm, and do you know why those who lose often sustain serious injuries?” he added, an eyebrow raised.

“Is it due to the enemy’s spells?” Li Xuanfeng guessed, intrigued.

“Not entirely,” Li Tongya said as he shook his head.

“It’s because they fall.”

Li Tongya then went on to explain further.

“When cultivators engage in aerial combat, those lacking in mental fortitude are susceptible to the pain and fear inflicted by their enemies. As a result, they may lose control and plummet to the ground, sustaining severe injuries such as broken tendons and bones... in such a state, they lack the strength to continue battling their foes."

His words sparked contemplation among Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling who were gathered around Li Xuanfeng, nodding in understanding. He grinned and remarked, “I’m glad we still have you around to guide us, Second Uncle.”

“Sheesh.”

Li Tongya smiled wryly at the boy’s cheekiness, observing Li Xuanfeng as he picked up the sack with his right arm.

“Look, Second Uncle!” he said with a chuckle.

He untied the rope with a swift motion, releasing three small mountain pigs from the sack. Li Xuanfeng grabbed two of the pigs by the neck in each hand, holding them securely.

“I found three mountain pigs in that beast’s den. Can we raise them at home?” he asked.

Li Tongya nodded in response.

“We do have quite a number of Spirit Rice Bran and leaves, and also stuffed parts from the demonic beasts we’ve killed before... but then again, mountain pigs have a big appetite, and it might be challenging to raise even one of them.”

“That’s not a problem!” Li Xuanfeng laughed.

With a hard squeeze of his palms, Li Xuanfeng killed the two small mountain pigs in his hands instantly, leaving only the one in the sack still struggling to escape.

“These little demonic creatures are formidable opponents, we’ll need a cultivator outside of the main family to keep an eye on them.”

Li Tongya turned his attention to Li Xuanxuan who was busy performing Spirit Sealing Technique on the carcass.

“Xuan’er, how are all the cultivators in the side family faring?” he asked.

“Excluding Chen Donghe and Li Qiuyang, there are three cultivators that don’t bear the surname Li. One of them is from the Ye Clan, but they have been returned to the side family, the rest have also been married into the Li Family,” he replied promptly.

“Good.”

Li Tongya nodded approvingly. “How are their cultivations?”

“Not satisfactory,” Li Xuanxuan continued with a sigh, shaking his head. “The cultivation method they use is the Azure Essence Meridian Nourishment Technique, which we obtained from Senior Si Yuanbai. Compared to our Supre-...”

Li Xuanxuan intended to mention the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra, but before he could utter these words, the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his Qihai acupoint suddenly interrupted his thoughts.

It startled him so much that it also caught the attention of Lu Jiangxian, who was engrossed in his research. With his divine sense, Lu Jiangxian swiftly discerned the cause of the disturbance.

Realizing his mistake, Li Xuanxuan quickly corrected himself. “Compared to our cultivation speed and technique, the technique they use pales in comparison. Currently, the strongest among them has only condensed the Radiant Lure Chakra, the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. They mainly spend their days taking care of the Spirit Paddies and Wuzha Worms,” he explained.

Li Tongya nodded at his clarification, acknowledging the significant difference in cultivation levels between the main family and the branch cultivators as he nodded in understanding.

Maybe we should consider letting them use a better cultivation method for the Embryonic Breathing Realm... with only six Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds available, it’s inevitable that there won’t be enough for future generations of the major sect. We must avoid relying solely on common cultivation methods like the Azure Essence Meridian Nourishment Technique.

While Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling dealt with the mountain pig demon and summoned someone to carry it away, Li Xiewen approached to deliver news that the Liu family had visited to report a death.

Li Tongya’s uncle, Liu Linfeng, had passed away during the night.

While the younger members of the Li Family were seemingly unfazed by the news, Li Tongya felt a squeeze in his heart.

Now that he thought about it, he was already forty. Liu Linfeng was twenty-five years his senior and had lived to the ripe age of sixty-five. In their village, such longevity was considered remarkable.

“Don’t inform Mother about this,” he instructed.

His mother’s health had declined in recent years and it worsened after his father’s death, looking as though she had lost her soul. She found it difficult to focus, and would sometimes even wander off and get lost.

Li Tongya feared that this news would only add to the poor woman’s distress.

“I’ll descend the mountain to take a look.”

————

Chen Donghe followed the trail Li Xiangping had drawn on the map, noticing the absence of any large groups of Mount Yue soldiers or stationed troops.

Instead, there were only corpses scattered on the ground that were being scavenged by vultures and jackals. The cracked earth offered no water source except for a few small puddles remaining in the dry riverbed.

The group of people walked in silence, their only company being the sound of sobs and wails.

Out of the one thousand who had set out, only around two hundred had returned. Despite inflicting significant casualties and chaos on the enemy, those who had returned were wounded and filled with sorrow.

Glancing at Li Yesheng lying curled up on a stretcher nearby, Chen Donghe saw him stir finally after three days of unconsciousness due to his broken hip.

“Where’s the Family Head?” Li Yesheng asked weakly, his voice barely a whisper.

“Up ahead,” Chen Donghe replied, forcing a smile.

Seeing Li Yesheng smiling before shutting his eyes, Chen Donghe felt a pang of sadness. He noticed a tear leaking from the corner of Li Yesheng’s eye and could no longer hold back his emotions.

“I knew I couldn’t hide it from you, Uncle Yesheng,” he whispered as he choked back tears.

“How did he die?” Li Yesheng asked finally, his voice full of emotion.

“Killed by a curse,” Chen Donghe replied curtly, trying to hold his tears back.

Li Yesheng let out a deep sigh as tears began welling up in his eyes once more.

Li Yesheng mourned not only the loss of someone as powerful as Li Xiangping but also the end of his own power and influence. The complicated relationship between them only added to the grief.

Brother Xiangping, you and I are more alike than you think.

Li Yesheng reflected, knowing Li Xiangping better than anyone else.

When he was fifteen, he knew that the blood spilled on the rock was Li Yesheng’s, his elder brother. He saw the guilt in Li Xiangping’s eyes but pretended that he did not see it.

When he was twelve, Li Yesheng endured his elder brother’s abuse. He knew that there were three knives on Mount Lijing—two were big and one was small. If he needed to rid himself of his brother’s tyranny, he would have to cause a conflict between them.

Li Yesheng’s ears were constantly filled with rumors about Li Mutian’s family. He treaded cautiously for three years as though walking on thin ice before he finally got his older brother killed.

He had expected Li Mutian to take action, but it was Li Xiangping who ultimately became the instrument of his liberation.

In his gratitude, Li Yesheng spent a lifetime being Li Xiangping’s loyal dog. Knowing that he had outlived him caused him immense suffering.

“I wish to become your blood brother in our next life, Brother Xiangping, just like Brother Tongya and Brother Changhu...” Li Yesheng murmured, straining to reach for a bottle of poison at his waist.

He had prepared the poison in case he fell into Mount Yue’s hands and faced torture... and had yet to taste it.

“Surviving is merely existing in a state of lingering. Xiewen has grown up and has found a companion in Xuanxuan... I’ve done enough for him as his parent,” Li Yesheng muttered as he struggled to raise his hand, allowing the cold liquid to flow slowly through his lips.

As the numbness spread in his mouth, he began writhing on the stretcher, his head rolling side to side which disheveled his gray hair.

God damn, it’s bitter, he thought indignantly as he approached the end of his life.
