# Chapter 881: Acquiring the Item

Chi Buzi heard this and was entirely unsurprised. He replied with serene composure:
"Please."

Daoist Master Fuxuan, seeing his calm demeanor, was already seven-tenths convinced. Suspicion bloomed in his heart:

'The Taiqun Spirit-Mirror is a Spiritual Treasure left by the Ancestor to suppress the Daoist tradition. Because of the Ancestor's failed breakthrough and subsequent fall... it possesses a unique divinity far beyond ordinary Spiritual Treasures. Since Chi Buzi is this confident... it's likely he truly cultivated it himself!'

Even if Chi Buzi was now a Great Daoist Master who had mastered countless divine abilities and secret arts, deceiving the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror—a treasure intimately bound to the life of a direct disciple of the Supreme Yang and the Chunyi Ancestor—was absolutely impossible.

At this thought, his heart pounded.

'Could he truly have found a Daoist tradition cache left behind by the Ancestor?'

Daoist Master Fuxuan raised an eyebrow.

"Che Hong, go and retrieve the Spiritual Treasure!"

Che Hong bowed and departed. Daoist Master Fuxuan turned back to Chi Buzi, his expression far more complex. He said softly:

"It is an artifact of the Ancestor, after all. We cannot move it without proper ceremony. Che Hong must first burn incense and bathe. I must ask the Great Daoist Master to wait for three days."

Chi Buzi waved his hand dismissively, raising an eyebrow.
"It has been many years since I last saw Daoist Friend Fuxuan. I have missed you dearly since we parted ways at Songfang Mountain."

Daoist Master Fuxuan stared at him intently and replied:
"You missed one occasion, Daoist Friend. I came to your gates to plead on behalf of the Chen Taojing brothers. But Chi Wei refused to see me and sent you down the mountain to turn me away."

This was clearly an unpleasant memory, explaining why Chi Buzi had received such a cold reception. Fuxuan pressed on, "As for Songfang Mountain, or Yu Yuxie later, or even Li Chejing at the end... we gave our counsel. For the Azure Pond to have fallen to its current state, it has only itself to blame."

"Not so."

Chi Buzi did not agree. "The Chi, Tang, Ning, and Si... what a sight they were back then. The Three Yuans were magnificent. Under Tang Yuanwu, there was Tang Shecheng and Yu Xiuxian. In the younger generation, Chi Zhiyun, Ning Wan, Si Yuanli... which of them wasn't a Purple Mansion Realm seed? Tang Shecheng was even compared to me. Everyone believed the next generation would continue the Azure Pond's golden age."

"Back then, we only worried that we had too many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and not enough Spiritual Artifacts to divide among them. We felt outsiders who reached the Purple Mansion Realm couldn't be trusted; if they lived too long, they'd become a liability. Who needed them? Who could have predicted that Yu Xiuxian would be killed by Guo E, or that Tang Shecheng would perish while assaulting the Purple Mansion Realm? Just look at Yuanwu Peak—they then tried to nurture Tang Shejun, and he perished all the same. Finally, there was Yu Muxian, who was killed by Yuansu supporting the Li family."

He shook his head slightly, sighing.

"The blame cannot be placed on one man. Would it truly have been a good thing if we had a few more Daoist Masters named Yu or Li back then?"

Daoist Master Fuxuan fell silent. "The Azure Pond is, after all, *his* domain. Even if he doesn't care and won't show his face, his style of conduct is similar. You, Daoist Friend, are a seeker of the Dao. The Pristine Water path is locked... it cannot be easy for you."

Chi Buzi watched him quietly. Here, at the Chunyi Dao Gate, he was unwilling to say more. He only said:

"Seeking the Dao... this is not the only path before me. My lifespan is long. The celestial might of a True Monarch is unfathomable. Perhaps if I wait one or two hundred years, the True Monarch will ascend to a new height. The qi of the Purging Dew might become harvestable, and a path will naturally open."

"And if that opportunity never comes, if I cannot become the  True Monarch's subordinate, I am now diligently accumulating connections and spiritual resources. The path of reincarnation is also a valid way forward."

He seemed broad-minded and at ease, having clearly accepted this. Fuxuan nodded internally, opening his mouth to say:

"That is the only way. Speaking of subordinates, I heard a Daoist Master from the North Ring Sect is attempting to reach Golden Core and hopes to become a subordinate of 'Blazing Fire'. His chances are said to be high. I wonder if he will prove his Dao in this world, and what method that entity will use to assist him... I wonder if we will have a chance to witness such a spectacle."

The two quickly fell silent. Though these two Daoist Masters had known each other since youth, they were, in the end, different kinds of people. Their Daoist traditions were in conflict. The brief topics they could discuss were nothing more than idle chatter.

Fortunately, to Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, three days passed in the blink of an eye. Daoist Master Che Hong, now dressed in immaculate white robes, came forward. He held a jade tray, upon which rested a mirror.

The mirror's face was eight inches across and snow-white. Its surface was like a perfectly still lake, clear and bright. The top was adorned with auspicious clouds supporting a moon, while the back was etched with dense, coiling Hornless Dragon patterns and feather-like silver lines that glittered and shifted.

Chi Buzi, merely sitting in its presence without even facing it directly, felt a terrifying sensation. His Life Divine Ability throbbed, sending waves of crisis warnings from that direction.

'The Taiqun Spirit-Mirror!'

"As expected of a Spiritual Treasure bestowed by the Supreme Yang Dao lineage and personally designated by an Immortal... Its power is likely the absolute zenith of all Spiritual Treasures."

Chi Buzi understood how terrifying this item was. Ninety percent of the reputation of the Chunyi Dao Gate's Ancestor, "Jiequn," was built upon the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror. This was no joke.

When Jiequn received this item, the master had personally said it had the potential of a Dharma Treasure and to nurture it well. Jiequn bound his life to it, nourishing it day and night with his divine abilities. Although the Ancestor later perished, failing to break through to Golden Core, and the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror was forever barred from becoming a Dharma Treasure, in any situation where Dharma Treasures were absent, this mirror's power was likely number one in the entire Supreme Yang Dao lineage.

Daoist Master Fuxuan rose respectfully, bowed, and only then took the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror in his hands. Chi Buzi glanced at it and saw its surface ripple like water, revealing a world within—a faint, hazy image of a zither, an incense table, and a bamboo forest behind it.

Fuxuan held the Spiritual Treasure aloft. Chi Buzi cautiously took a step back, and without hesitation, four streams of divine ability—intertwined grey and azure, rippling green and white—flared to life in his hand. Fuxuan, meanwhile, secretly sensed the mirror's reaction, his expression growing grave.

'How can this *not* be our Daoist tradition? The Taiqun Spirit-Mirror not only detects no taint, no trace of abnormality, but it's even emanating a faint sense of intimacy. If not our Daoist tradition, what else could it be?'

The Xi clan's Pristine Water Daoist tradition, the Chou-Gui Hidden Form, originated from the Ancestor Jiequn, who had received it via oral transmission from the Immortal. After Jiequn perfected his cultivation, he specifically extracted this Dao and left it for his descendants. Later, after Du Qing achieved the Dao, no one in the Xi clan cultivated Pristine Water anymore. There was no reason for it to have ever been leaked.

'Chi Buzi has already mastered it, so he must have the manual. If he'd obtained it from some past senior, he would never walk right into my hands. This so-called "fortuitous encounter" must be real.'

Fuxuan's heart was torn between joy and worry.

This was a Daoist cache related to the Ancestor Jiequn!

Despite confirming that the other party possessed his sect's Daoist tradition, Fuxuan's expression remained largely unchanged. He said casually, "Daoist Friend has great fortune and great character. It is clearly self-cultivated. But this item..."

Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow, his voice cutting straight to the point.

"Is it, or is it not, your esteemed gate's Daoist tradition?"

Chi Buzi's question was sharp, leaving Fuxuan no room to evade. Fuxuan had to clench his jaw and nod.

"It is!"

Chi Buzi lowered his gaze, saying nothing. Fuxuan smiled bitterly in his heart. The sect's Daoist tradition could not be allowed to circulate externally. He had to say:

"This fortuitous encounter..."

Chi Buzi looked up cautiously, his eyes narrowing.

"My acquiring this encounter was not as simple as just taking an advantage."

He glanced at Fuxuan and said coolly, "This Daoist Master does indeed require the Chunyi Dao Gate's assistance. I need a member of your direct bloodline to help me willingly. However, the location of the encounter... I absolutely cannot tell your gate's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators."

Fuxuan frowned. Chi Buzi stated flatly:

"Your gate possesses the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror. If I reveal the location and we go together, you will undoubtedly use the Spiritual Treasure to ambush me. I do not wish to be injured, nor do I wish to perish."

Fuxuan opened his mouth, but Chi Buzi continued:

"I know, however, that the most precious item within this hidden cache is a Supreme Yin spiritual object. How about this... your clan sends one direct-line cultivator to accompany me. I will leave a Spiritual Treasure in your clan's hands as collateral."

"Once the cache is opened, I will retrieve the spiritual object. I will then use other items from within to trade back for my Spiritual Treasure. The direct-line cultivator who accompanies me can witness the contents, and we can then divide the spiritual items fairly."

Fuxuan's brow was tightly knit. He remained silent, seemingly unable to find a major flaw in the proposal. The Xi family had many direct-line cultivators, and no shortage of those whose Dao paths were already severed. He wasn't afraid of Chi Buzi harming one...

He pondered for a long time. He understood that Chi Buzi feared the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror and would never allow one of his sect's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to go. The so-called reputation of the orthodox path was useless in front of such a suspicious man...

After an unknown amount of time, he finally nodded slightly, his voice soft:

"One Spiritual Treasure is not enough... Our person will bring the sect's Pagoda Heart-Clarifying Talisman. They will not fear spiritual confusion."

Chi Buzi hesitated, then said reluctantly:

"I will add one Spiritual Artifact. No more. This isn't some grotto-heaven secret realm..."

Fuxuan nodded, thinking to himself:

'First, I'll ask him for his copy of the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method*. Since he got it from a chance encounter, it might be more complete than our version! I'll examine it carefully. It's a double guarantee!'

But before he could speak, Chi Buzi waved his hand.

"Daoist Friend... what you say may be true, but I am not a member of your Chunyi Dao Gate. I cannot see the changes in the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror. You and your people understand what it means, but the opportunity is in *my* hands. How can I not be on guard?"

"What does Daoist Friend mean by that?" Fuxuan frowned, clearly confused.

Chi Buzi said, "The opportunity only states it requires a bloodline descendant who cultivates this path. How do we know that this Chou-Gui Hidden Form is the same as the one in your Chunyi Dao Gate's possession? Who knows if your Chunyi Dao Gate even has that much face? What if it's not? I bring your man over, we fail to open it, and return empty-handed. Your gate could immediately renege on the deal. It's just the death of one minor direct-line cultivator, but you'll have swallowed my Spiritual Treasure and Spiritual Artifact. Wouldn't that be a massive profit!"

"Hsss..."

Fuxuan finally understood. He sucked in a breath of cold air, as if the possibility of such a scheme had only just occurred to him. He felt a chill, but also a sense of marvel. He cursed with a laugh:

"That is something only you, Chi Buzi, could cook up!"

He turned and ordered:
"Che Hong, go and fetch the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method*."

Daoist Master Che Hong, who had been listening all along, was now full of anticipation. He hurried off. Chi Buzi calmly sipped his tea. After a moment, the Daoist Master returned, holding a golden jade slip. He opened it with a secret art and handed it to Fuxuan.

"Please!" Fuxuan said, full of confidence.

Chi Buzi took it, frowning as he read it from beginning to end. A quarter of an hour later, having seemingly read it over and over without finding any discrepancies, he said with considerable relief:

"Indeed, it is correct!"

The moment he said this, the two Daoist Masters beside him secretly sighed in relief.

Chi Buzi handed it back. "My thanks. Please send the person up. Old is fine, just not so old they can't travel... I can't have them falling apart on the way."

Clearly, sending an old man near the end of his lifespan was better than sending a cultivator whose path was merely severed. Fuxuan gestured to Daoist Master Che Hong, who soon returned with an old man. The man bowed to the three.
"Xi Jiankuan greets the three Daoist Masters..."

"Why him?" Fuxuan seemed reluctant.

Che Hong whispered, "Many are cultivating the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method* right now, but he is the eldest. When we told him of the matter, he insisted on coming. He said he doesn't have many years left anyway and wanted to make one last contribution to the sect."

"Hah!" Fuxuan waved his hand, replying via a divine sense message:
'Based on this man's words and his divine ability, this matter is likely true. It's just a single trip... but it's a needless hardship for an old man...'

Chi Buzi looked entirely unconcerned, sipping his tea and glancing at Xi Jiankuan on the floor. He wasn't surprised. A man as shrewd as he had long since investigated and calculated this. This was the most likely candidate.

'He only has a few years left anyway. By the time he perishes, Du Qing have returned from the Outer-Heavens. Can a dead man from the Xi bloodline speak? Even if he could, and you tried to turn the Xi clan upside down... let's see if Taiyi would tolerate it!'

The thought flashed through his mind, but his face remained serene, a secret smile playing on his lips.

'The Chunyi Dao Gate... Fuxuan and Che Hong... they aren't fools, but they are traditionalists, bound by rules and reverence for the past. How can they possibly outplay me? It seems I'll have to part with that Supreme Yin spiritual object, but the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method* is now in hand!'

Everything Chi Buzi had done, all the maneuvering, was for the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method*. Even if he had to pay with a spiritual object from the heavens, it was a worthy trade. Seeing the man brought before him, he gently flipped his hand, and two items appeared on the jade table.

One was a small, azure cauldron shrouded in gray light. Runes swirled around it, and the moment it landed, an aura of damp, falling rain filled the air.

'The Rain-Watching Treasure Cauldron.'

The other was a string of dark, bluish-black prayer beads. Each bead was like a condensation of deep pool water—round, glistening, and looking as if it would burst at a single touch.

'The Motang beads.'

Fuxuan looked like he wanted to say something. He glanced at the Spiritual Swords used for spell arts at Chi Buzi's waist and sighed.

"You have picked the Azure Pond clean!"

Chi Buzi smiled lightly. Having obtained the *Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method*, his mood had clearly improved. "What is mine," he said coolly, "I will not leave a single piece behind. What is not... I will not touch at all."

...

Moongaze Lake.

The hot sun hung high in the sky, illuminating Gardenia Scenery Mountain. This was the place where Daoist Master Zhaojing had his breakthrough. The mountain was covered in gardenias that bloomed all year round. Now, with every flower on the mountain blooming simultaneously, it was as dazzling as new-fallen snow.

Amidst the gardenia petals drifting down like rain, a white-robed Daoist Master sat cross-legged atop a jade pillar. The Profound Light of the entire mountain range brightened and dimmed with his every breath. From time to time, purple flames would circle him, yet they never burned the white flowers drifting past.

After an unknown time, the Daoist Master suddenly exhaled. A fierce wind instantly tore across the mountain. The sounds of horses neighing, armor clashing, and war drums thundering rang out as golden-armored figures marched across the slopes in a brilliant display.

Li Ximing slowly opened his eyes, the Profound Light at the center of his brow gradually receding.

"Audience with the Celestial Gate is perfected!"

Perfecting Audience with the Celestial Gate had increased its power. Its suppressing and grinding force was more potent than ever. This was the specialty of this Divine Ability, and now, with a single reverberation of the gate, perhaps not even Chiluo could escape.

The power of its golden-armored figures was also much stronger. But their application was too specific; no one would ever use Foundation Establishment Realm-level summons to besiege a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. It remained useless, except perhaps against an opponent like Yehui, who could also create thousands of bodies with his Sorrowful Southern Water.

Aside from that, the power of the Divine Ability's purple flames had finally improved. But Bright Yang was not a fire-based Dao, after all. It still couldn't compare to the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire and was doomed to be a mere accessory.

But these were minor points. What mattered was that Li Ximing had mastered this Divine Ability to its absolute limit, fully refining and storing it within his Shengyang Acupoint. He could now begin cultivating his second Divine Ability: Sovereign's Perilous Tread!

His spiritual sense sank into his Shengyang Acupoint. He saw the Profound Light representing Audience with the Celestial Gate tucked into one corner, leaving more space to refine other abilities.

In the center, the Talisman Seed hovered softly, emitting a faint, cold light. Though far weaker than Audience with the Celestial Gate, it possessed an unshakeable, piercing might.

Li Ximing swept his gaze over it and withdrew from his Shengyang Acupoint. He looked down. Outside his seclusion, one large and six small jade talismans were hanging, indicating that one year and six months had passed. There were no other alerts. It seemed the clan had been peaceful.

He set his mind at ease and retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve.

*Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass*!

This was only a fourth-grade cultivation manual. While it would be considered a core text for a direct disciple in an immortal sect, it was nothing special for the current Li family, let alone the mighty Wei-Li Celestial Dynasty of the past. The name alone suggested it was not a key manual for the imperial family, but rather one for generals garrisoned at remote border passes.

Li Ximing had read it long ago. True to its purpose, the *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass* lacked the imposing, suppressive majesty of an imperial art. Instead, it was filled with the desperation of life-and-death struggle, of being trapped in hopeless situations, of asserting one's will through pure martial might.

Li Ximing's understanding of Bright Yang was considerable. Although he had never seen what a true imperial manual should look like, he could still discern many things. The *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass* leaned heavily toward injuring others rather than protecting oneself. He nodded inwardly.

'It's for border generals, after all. Their duty is to charge forward and kill. Why would they need so many defensive measures? A general must be willing to trade death for death.'

'Fortunately, it's a Body Divine Ability, so it's not bad. I already have Audience with the Celestial Gate for suppression. An offensive, charging focus is a good complement.'

He paused, retrieving a jade box from his sleeve.

Inside was the "Xuanguan Crimson Fire Qi."

This strand of Spiritual Qi had to be harvested from a "Xuanguan" (Profound Pass) personally established by a Bright Yang Dao cultivator. Furthermore, the pass itself had to be two hundred years old. The Cui family had been unable to cultivate this art in their early years. It was only after they constructed such a pass on Chongzhou Island that they slowly began to practice this manual.

The requirements were harsh. A Xuanguan took up a large area and was not easy to build. The Cui family didn't have much of this qi; they barely had enough for themselves. They had given Li Ximing one portion when they gave him the manual. The Li family had no surplus, which was why no one in the clan had been seen cultivating this art.

For a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had already formed one Divine Ability, forging a new Immortal Foundation was less complex than it was during the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The Embyronic Breathing stage required six rounds of cultivation. Now, his Dharma-body was clear of any foundation, and he could condense one at will. Moreover, guiding qi was not as troublesome as it was in childhood. By Li Ximing's calculations, what took three to five years during Embyronic Breathing would now take only three to five *days*.

Once these six rounds were condensed, he could consume the Spiritual Qi and easily break through to Qi Refining. The journey from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment Realm was not so simple, but with his Purple Mansion Realm Dharma-body, he could take pills as he pleased. He estimated it would take two to three years.

After that was Foundation Establishment Realm. With the help of his existing Divine Ability, it wouldn't be difficult. Although there was a chance of failure, by taking the tailor-made Essence Gathering Pills, the Immortal Foundation would form instantly!

The process of cultivating the Sovereign's Perilous Tread Immortal Foundation would likewise be much easier, similar to Qi Refining. It would likely take five to ten years. Once the Immortal Foundation was perfected, he just had to move it into his Shengyang Acupoint and follow the manual to forge the Divine Ability.

'Theoretically, this entire process, from foundation to Divine Ability, could be completed in under ten years!'

This was, without a doubt, a terrifying speed. Yet, Li Ximing had rarely heard of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator forming a new Divine Ability in just ten years. Even the fastest seemed to take twenty. The difficulty lay in the fact that the Shengyang Acupoint *already contained* a Divine Ability. Pushing a new Immortal Foundation into it was exponentially harder. If he failed... although his Purple Mansion Realm body wouldn't be seriously injured, the Immortal Foundation would be completely destroyed.

"That's equivalent to ten, or even more, years of work... all down the drain."

Although with every failed attempt to push the foundation into the Shengyang Acupoint, the residual divinity would adjust the position of the original Divine Ability, helping them adapt to each other and perhaps increasing the chance of success on the next try... failing time and again was a torturous ordeal.

As Li Ximing considered this, another realization struck him:

'If I suffer a grievous injury during this period, if my sea of qi is pierced... even if I can reform it easily, the Immortal Foundation within it would likely be destroyed by the attacker. No wonder these Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are so reluctant to fight, preferring to resolve matters through schemes...'

'And people like the Purple Mansion Realm rogue cultivators from the Eastern Sea... they might spend decades, even a hundred years, just failing to forge a new Immortal Foundation...'

'If a second Divine Ability is this difficult, what about a third or a fourth? It must be astronomically hard! No wonder some Purple Mansion Realm cultivators get stuck at one bottleneck for a hundred years...'

He lowered his gaze, a name flashing in his mind:

'Art of Rebirth!'

'The person who devised this method was a twisted genius!'

'No wonder everyone covets it! This is a massive convenience for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators! You cultivate the Immortal Foundation in your own body, while simultaneously raising a "genius medicine person" on the side. When it's time to break through... you refine them into a pill and consume it. It's equivalent to getting a free, extra chance to birth a Divine Ability!!'

'That's a saving of ten or twenty years of effort... Who wouldn't be tempted? Who *couldn't* be tempted? Even if you weren't tempted at first, after being stuck at a bottleneck for ten, twenty, or even a hundred years... how could you possibly resist?!'
