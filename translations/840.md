# Chapter 840: Baoqing

The sky was filled with Buddhist cultivators, their expressions as rigid and imposing as statues. Within the clouds, a brilliant golden light shone forth, revealing a colossal, golden-bodied effigy. Its face was serene—devoid of compassion, yet also of joy—as it loomed silently over the world below.

A palpable sense of fear and apprehension gripped the cultivators on the ground. The entirety of North Dan Island was bathed in the overwhelming radiance. Li Wushao took a step back with a deep frown, clearly repulsed by the celestial light. His face soured, and one could only imagine the curses running through his mind.

All eyes turned to Li Xizhi.

He remained perfectly calm. Crushing a jade talisman in his hand, he made a quick assessment before rising on a trail of rosy mist. Channeling his spiritual energy, he projected his voice, clear and strong.

"May I ask why the Great Konghai Temple has suddenly graced our Azure Pond's Shitang? I am Li Xizhi, Lord of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion."

None of the Master Monks in the sky answered. The Merciful One remained as still as a sculpture. Instead, a nun stepped forward, leading a contingent of her peers. Dressed in loose, dark monastic robes, she pressed her palms together and intoned:

"Our master, Lord of the Great Konghai Temple, through a profound karmic destiny, has attained the mystical Dao of the Five Skandhas and disseminated the wondrous teachings of the Three Vehicles. He has dispatched the Arhat Dharma Protector, the Merciful One and great cultivator of the highest order, Zhuzhen, to come and guard Beidan."

The moment she finished speaking, an uproar swept through the ranks of the Azure Pond cultivators.

The history of Buddhist cultivators was far shorter than that of Immortal cultivators, and their titles were consequently a mess of overblown and convoluted names. The Immortal Dao, by contrast, had inherited its traditions from a golden age in antiquity, and its conventions were firmly established. A cultivator in the Purple Mansion Realm was simply called a Daoist Master, and in many places, those in the Foundation Establishment Realm didn't even merit the title of Daoist.

This Buddhist cultivator, "Zhuzhen," was called both a "Merciful One" and a "great cultivator," titles that sounded ridiculously exalted. In reality, he was just a Merciful One. Many so-called "Great Master Monks" among the Buddhist cultivators were only at the level of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

What truly horrified the crowd was her final declaration—*to come and guard Beidan!*

What was the meaning of this? The Azure Pond Sect was, for all its troubles, part of the Supreme Yang Dao lineage. Although the Southern Sea had many powerful Buddhist and Daoist cultivators, and the Great Konghai Temple was backed by a Maha, there was no justification for such an arrogant, demanding attitude on another's territory. This was tantamount to a declaration of war on Azure Pond.

Li Xizhi raised his head, his eyes cool and composed. "I wonder what promise the Great Konghai Temple has received," he said in a measured tone, "and from which Daoist Master's immortal edict you derive the authority to simply take Shitang?"

"Beidan has received no such edict. If the Great Konghai Temple intends to seize Shitang while my sect is vulnerable after the fall of our Great Daoist Master, then forgive this junior for being unable to comply."

The nun in the sky returned his words with a cold glare. "With Lord Zhuzhen present, what right do people like you have to speak? Even with your great reputation as the Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow, do you expect a great cultivator to explain himself to you?"

Li Xizhi frowned. Seeing her obstinance and the way she twisted his words instead of listening, he knew they had come with ill intentions. Azure Pond was weak, and there was no way they could spare a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to intervene at this moment.

Just then, his wife, Yang Xiao'er, descended on a cloud of mist to his side. "Are all the members of the Great Konghai Temple so unreasonable?" she asked softly. "I am Yang Xiao'er of the Yang Clan from the Yue State…"

The nun was about to retort when the statue-like Merciful One in the sky finally spoke, his voice deep and resonant as thunder.

"So, an Imperial Scion."

His eyes were filled with a stern authority. "My Great Konghai Temple has crossed paths with Daoist friends Si, Tang, and Ning in the past," he said coldly. "Beidan itself was a treasured place where I discussed the profound mysteries with two of them. Shitang, moreover, was the very place where my master attained his enlightenment. A great battle was fought here long ago, and the three Daoist Masters declared that as long as they lived, Shitang would belong to Azure Pond."

He paused briefly. "Out of respect for the Azure Pond's lineage, my master promised to withdraw from Shitang. Now, your sect's karmic tie to this place has ended. We have simply come to take back what is ours."

Li Xizhi's expression darkened.

The Merciful One's meaning was clear: in his telling, the Three Yuans of Azure Pond had stolen Shitang from the Great Konghai Temple. Now that the Three Yuans were gone, they were here to reclaim it.

The sect's most secret archives were beyond Li Xizhi's access, but he had never heard any mention of Shitang being seized from others. If the matter had been so significant as to require the intervention of three Purple Mansion Realm masters, it was impossible that no record of it would exist within the sect. Even if this man wasn't lying outright, he was certainly omitting crucial facts.

But the facts no longer mattered. They were already surrounded, leaving no room for negotiation. They had come to strike while the iron was hot. How could Li Xizhi possibly debate the matter with a Merciful One?

Since they came with hostility, he dropped all pretense of politeness. "And what is it the Merciful One suggests?" he asked flatly.

Addressing him directly as "Merciful One" was a custom from Jiangnan. It was not common in the Southern Sea and carried a distinct flavor of the northern Buddhist Dao. The Merciful One's brow furrowed, and a Sanskrit chant escaped his lips. "My Great Konghai Temple has no desire for needless slaughter. Out of respect for Daoist Master Zhaojing and the Yue State, take your families and disciples and leave. Cede Beidan to us."

Li Xizhi fell silent.

Cede it? Or not?

The protective array on North Dan Island was formidable, but using it to resist a Merciful One was a fool's dream. Li Xizhi had no desire to die a martyr for Azure Pond, and he knew that Dantai Jin and the Ning Clan wanted him to preserve his life. He weighed his options, trying to gauge whether they would actually kill him.

'It wouldn't take long for Daoist Master Ning to get here from Jiangbei,' he thought, 'but notifying her is the problem. I've already crushed the talisman to alert Dantai Jin, but he might not have the nerve to immediately ring the bronze bell and summon a Daoist Master back.'

He quickly looked up. "We must have a Daoist Master's immortal edict to retreat," he said softly. "I must ask the Merciful One to wait. As soon as the edict arrives, I will have an answer for you."

For Zhuzhen to wait here would be a joke. The statement was a clear refusal. The golden light emanating from the Merciful One began to shimmer, a clear sign of his growing anger.

Furthermore, after so many years in the Southern Sea, it was impossible that Li Xizhi didn't know the local customs. His refusal to call him "Great Cultivator," using "Merciful One" again and again, was like adding oil to a fire.

"You've refused the easy way," the high-level cultivator snarled, "so you'll get the hard way!"

As he spoke, the surrounding group of Master Monks let out a unified roar. The sky thundered with a sound that shook the heavens. Li Xizhi swept his gaze across them and began to form hand seals.

A torrent of brilliant light descended from above as the Master Monks pressed toward the array. Li Xizhi remained motionless, but a host of rosy-hued doppelgangers leaped from his body, and a magnificent rainbow of light erupted.

"Rainbow Pierce!"

This Dharma Art, which had once failed to even scratch Tuoba Chongyuan's physical body, was now completely transformed. The splendid, colorful light coalesced into massive beams the size of houses, which danced and scattered through the air, streaking past the faces of the Master Monks.

As the spell arts shot toward the heavens, the nun attending the Merciful One was startled. She descended on her cloud, shouting, "Vicious fiend! You still dare to be arrogant!"

Even Zhuzhen frowned slightly, musing to himself.

'He truly is exceptionally skilled in spell arts… his reputation is well-earned… a pity he cultivates heavenly glow arts. With no path forward unless he joins Luoxia… he is indeed a sharp sword for any Immortal Daoist Master.'

He seemed less rash and unreasonable than he appeared on the surface. He was observing, scrutinizing. Seeing this, Li Xizhi felt his resolve harden.

"All cultivators on the island, join me in resistance!" he commanded.

The cultivators immediately descended onto the array platforms. The formation on North Dan Island had been constructed by an array master during Chi Wei's era, when the Azure Pond Sect was at its zenith with five Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters presiding over it. The materials used were of the highest quality. With more than ten Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators channeling their energy in unison, the great array blazed to life.

But the Master Monks in the sky were more numerous and more powerful, and the array began to tremble almost immediately. Li Xizhi took a step into the air, his hands forming a new seal as he chanted an incantation.

'Screen of Cinnabar Cloud, from light manifest as you will, embrace the nine mountains, connect with the Nine Serene and reveal the truth… light of misty clouds, emerge at my command…'

A six-colored radiance shot from his palms. It soared like a swallow toward the outside of the array, transforming into a rainbow mist that spread out to reinforce the formation.

This was Li Xizhi's immortal foundation, Universal Dawn Mist, which excelled at evasion, rainbow-gathering, and casting. It could coalesce rainbow mist to confuse enemies and fortify a location. He had rarely used it in recent years, but now, its appearance immediately weakened the momentum of the attacking Master Monks.

The disorienting power of the mist was formidable, and combined with Li Xizhi's potent spell arts, it threw the cultivators outside the array into disarray. Above them, Zhuzhen's eyelids twitched with annoyance. The nun beside him immediately spoke in a respectful tone.

"Great Cultivator, shall I…"

Before she could finish, Zhuzhen shot her a cold glance. It was clear the Great Konghai Temple was starting to lose face, but the Merciful One seemed preoccupied with something else, his gaze wandering over the island.

He observed Yang Xiao'er closely, as if trying to confirm something. Seeing her composure and complete lack of fear, he frowned inwardly. But he couldn't allow Li Xizhi to hold them off. The Merciful One finally had to act. He let out a soft, casual breath.

"Hah!"

With that single exhalation, a fierce gale swept across the island. No matter how powerful the rosy mist was, it was instantly dispersed by the Merciful One's breath, once again revealing the white-robed man at the heart of the array.

Li Xizhi's expression was grave. As the crowd of Master Monks closed in again, he finally placed his hand on the hilt of the longsword strapped to his back. His pale, slender fingers rested on the gem embedded in the sword, yet he hesitated.

Beside him, Yang Xiao'er's face was also tinged with anger. Seeing her husband's hesitation, she took a step forward. "Act freely, husband…" she said in a soft, warm voice.

The understanding between them needed no words. Yang Xiao'er knew he was unsure of the situation and worried that injuring these Master Monks would give the Merciful One a pretext to retaliate without restraint. And Li Xizhi knew that his wife was confident.

His trust in her was absolute. She had been his wise partner through countless near-death experiences over the years. He gave a slight nod, and with a flick of his wrist—

*Shing!*

The longsword, shimmering with colorful light, was drawn partially from its sheath, revealing a section of pure white blade, its edge sharp, smooth, and exquisitely curved.

Above, the previously distracted Zhuzhen's eyes suddenly lit up. He whipped his head around as if jolted by lightning and let out a thundering roar.

"How dare you!"

At the same instant, a brilliant, warm white light leaped from within the array. It split into yellow and white streams, which in the very moment they appeared, each divided again into three points of interweaving, fluid light.

'Flowing Light of the Triple Moon!'

The many Master Monks surrounding the array finally recoiled in unison, a heart-stopping sense of danger flooding their senses.

*Clang!*

A gigantic golden hand shot through the Great Void and materialized in front of the Master Monks. Rippling with immense spiritual qi, it shielded them all behind it.

Zhuzhen was a Merciful One, after all, and traversing the Great Void offered him immense advantages. The six points of brilliant, warm white light were seized at once. The nearest stream of light had almost reached a Master Monk's neck, making his spiritual body shiver and a faint red line appear on his skin.

A cold chill ran down the backs of all the Master Monks as they exchanged horrified glances.

'He almost killed someone…'

Only Zhuzhen's swift reaction had prevented it. If the Great Konghai Temple had arrived in force, only to have several of their Master Monks killed right in front of a Merciful One, the loss of face would have been catastrophic.

In that single instant, the golden hand had barely managed to grasp the sword essence. A series of fine, sharp, ear-piercing metallic clashes rang out. Then, like a rainbow appearing after a storm, multicolored lights intertwined as streaks of radiance seemed to fall from the sky.

Li Xizhi had already sheathed his sword.

'Autumn Moon's Accord!'

It was the third style of the Celestial Moon Sword Canon!

Li Xizhi had achieved his sword essence and crossed the threshold to practice this sword art more than twenty years after his younger brother, Li Xijun, had. He had only managed it with the aid of the Five-Colour Sinking Expanse Sword Art. But his innate talent was no less than his brother's. By combining the Five-Colour Sinking Expanse Sword Art with the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon, he produced six streams of sword light. Executing Autumn Moon's Accord on this foundation made it even more devastating.

The next moment, a violent, piercing, earth-shattering shriek erupted from within the palm. The sound was so sharp and brittle that the Master Monks winced in pain, while the monks below clutched their ears as blood trickled out.

The great golden palm flinched as if it had clamped down on a steel nail. It faltered in a pained reflex, then, as if in a fit of rage, it slammed down onto Beidan's great array.

*BOOM!*

The dozen or so Foundation Establishment cultivators within the array all spat blood and were sent flying like arrows shot from a bow. The great array of Beidan exploded with a deafening roar, emitting a thick golden smoke. Like a glass dome struck by a hammer, it was instantly covered in a web of fine cracks.

*BANG!*

A tremendous crash echoed from the main hall atop Beidan's peak as thick white smoke billowed out. The central array plate had clearly been shattered beyond repair.

Silence fell over the scene.

*Crack…*

The sound of the great array of Beidan breaking apart filled the air. Whether it was the monks on the sea or the cultivators on the island, no one had yet recovered from their stupor. They were not shocked that Zhuzhen had broken the array with a single palm strike—on the contrary, it would have been stranger if he couldn't.

What left them stunned was Zhuzhen's pained reaction.

'This is a great cultivator of the Great Konghai Temple…'

In the last few centuries in Jiangnan, only one person had fought a Merciful One as a Foundation Establishment cultivator: Duanmu Kui.

Li Xizhi had merely caused Zhuzhen a flicker of pain. If not for the array absorbing the blow, he would have been annihilated instantly. Of course, he couldn't be compared to Duanmu Kui, who, wielding an Immortal Scripture, had beaten a Merciful One from the south so badly he was forced to retreat.

But that was with an Immortal Scripture. And who was Duanmu Kui? He was a legendary figure who had dominated his era, a man who had almost single-handedly redeemed the reputation of the Locust Shade Ghost immortal foundation. Not just anyone could be said to have dominated an era. Even without an Immortal Scripture, how many in Jiangnan could have fought him?

The current scene left the entire area of Shitang speechless. No one dared to look up at the Merciful One. Even Yang Xiao'er was startled, not expecting her husband's sword strike to be so incredible. She immediately clutched a talisman in her hand.

'Please don't let him fly into a rage…'

The Merciful One Zhuzhen slowly raised his head, studying his palm.

The golden palm was perfectly smooth. Of course, there was nothing there. No matter how hastily he had acted, Li Xizhi could not possibly have broken through his spiritual body or even left a mark. But he had undeniably felt pain.

'It must be a sword art capable of harming the Shengyang Acupoint… such magnificent swordsmanship…'

Zhuzhen's guess was correct. The strike of Autumn Moon's Accord, followed by the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon, merged three into one to simultaneously extinguish the Shengyang, Qihai, and Juque acupoints. It required sword essence to execute. If combined with a sword intent that could pierce the Great Void, the technique would be even more terrifying.

'A shame the gap between us is too vast,' Zhuzhen thought. 'It was merely a surprise.'

His thoughts flashed by in an instant. His gaze fell upon the white-robed swordsman on the island, his face burning with rage, his voice turning colder.

"Good… very good… they all say your sword can shake the heavens and earth. You are truly a descendant of a Sword Immortal."

As his voice grew low, Yang Xiao'er slowly tightened her grip on the talisman in her sleeve. Li Xizhi had already given quiet orders for the other cultivators to retreat. He himself remained unhurried, cupping his hands in a salute.

"This junior was merely clever. I thank Senior for the guidance."

The next moment, a blast of black wind shot from Yang Xiao'er's sleeve. But at the same time, Zhuzhen's colossal golden body vanished from the sky. The other Master Monks gave chase to the retreating Azure Pond cultivators, while the sound of the array crackling and shattering continued. Swarms of monks began to climb onto North Dan Island like ants.

*BOOM.*

A great golden palm materialized and seized the black wind, its five fingers tightening and yanking it back forcefully. Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er, caught within the wind, both coughed up blood. Yet Li Xizhi saw that his wife was completely unafraid. She simply guided the wind calmly and whispered:

"Daoist Master Ning has made her move."

By his calculations, it was too soon for Ning Wan to have arrived from the north. Li Xizhi couldn't tell if 'Daoist Master Ning has arrived' or 'Daoist Master Ning was here all along.' Zhuzhen's behavior was equally strange.

'Is he unable to catch us, or unwilling?'

He could only lower his head slowly, pushing all such thoughts from his mind.

As soon as Yang Xiao'er finished speaking, flurries of cold snow began to fall from the sky. A woman in white emerged from the Great Void. Unlike Zhuzhen's posturing, feigned coldness, this immortal's chill was laced with genuine fury.

"The Great Konghai Temple certainly has a lot of nerve."

The cultivators on the island let out a collective sigh of relief. Li Xizhi and his wife also relaxed. Zhuzhen, secretly relieved himself, manifested his full golden spiritual body and replied:

"Daoist Master Ning, you've arrived just in time. Regarding the matter of Beidan, my Maha wishes to discuss it with you in detail."

He stood his ground, a pillar of golden light soaring behind him. A thin figure slowly materialized within it—a monk in grey robes, holding a staff.

The monk's eyes were set high on his face. He held one hand before him, and his chin was sharp, giving him a somewhat malevolent look. Unlike the colossal spiritual bodies of the seven Mahas of the north, he appeared to be an ordinary monk. But when he struck the ground with his staff, a crisp sound rang out, and all the wind and snow ceased.

Ning Wan looked at him quietly. "With the Three Yuans fallen," she said softly, "a creature like you comes out to make trouble."

An exaggerated expression of joy spread across the monk's face. He grinned, revealing a set of perfectly white teeth. "No matter how invincible they were, they are dead now, while I have become a Maha. My path to eternal life has just begun. That is the difference between Immortals and Buddhists. What's the use of letting you be proud for a few more years?"

"Beidan belongs to my temple, so we will naturally take it back. Daoist friend Ning, my temple will give the Supreme Yang Dao lineage some face and not harm anyone. Go back to where you came from!"

Ning Wan smiled faintly, a smile like the spring thaw, and her tone became gentle. "Even if Senior lives another four hundred years, you'll never erase the incidents of 'Yuanwu Treading on the Face' and 'One Talisman is Enough.' In the past, for the sake of friendship between our two houses, we didn't speak of it. But now that the world has heard that Baoqing has achieved the Maha realm, perhaps it's time to tell the old stories again."

Her calm words struck like a thunderclap. After all of Baoqing Maha's posturing, Ning Wan's single sentence made him clench his fists. A dangerous light gleamed in his eyes as he forced a smile through his rage.

"You bitch, you'd better worry about yourself!"

## Moongaze Lake

On the grand hall, light streamed and flowed. A man in black robes with crimson trim stood before the gallery, watching the heavy rain fall upon the lake. His hand rested on the stone railing, tapping lightly, a picture of leisure.

After a while, a white-haired old man approached from the other end of the gallery. The old man was small and thin, his face a web of wrinkles, giving him an extremely shrewd appearance.

He bowed before the younger man. "Reporting to the Patriarch," he said respectfully, "the Hall of the Locust Soul from Jiangbei… has taken the lands of Midong, expanding their territory by a thousand li. Many of the great families of Midong have already pledged their allegiance. Their strength has grown considerably."

Li Jiangqian nodded with great interest. "How did they manage it? Did the Capital immortals give Midong away? Couldn't Guan Gongxiao come up with a better plan?"

Qu Bushi quickly replied, "Patriarch, there was unrest in Midong. Several families defected to the Hall of the Locust Soul… Daoist Bai was initially unwilling to accept them… but those families brought news that the whole of Baijiang Creek was the territory of the Secret Diffusion lineage. Lord Guan simply went with the flow and gave them Midong… Daoist Bai didn't harm those families, seeming to intend to make use of them once the storm passes."

Li Jiangqian nodded. "That's a passable explanation. Daoist Bai isn't a fool, just exceedingly greedy. He won't do anything truly unforgivable, but for a small grievance, his greed will make him overlook it."

Qu Bushi nodded eagerly. "Precisely because of this news, I've heard… that in recent days, Daoist Bai intends to conquer Fanyun and unify Baijiang Creek."

"That Hall of the Locust Soul is leakier than a sieve…" Li Jiangqian sneered. "People are all the same. After one or two successful ventures, they think everyone is just like them. My family and the Capital immortals Dao have kept our distance, so he's gradually lost his fear of Purple Mansion Realm powers. He thinks they're nothing special. Seeing Chengyun Gate and Lotus Temple locked in a fierce battle, unable to even manage the chaos in their own territories, he decided to make his move."

"And Chengyun Gate is happy to let them fight. With the Secret Diffusion lineage gathered, Fanyun's purpose no longer exists. They can cleanly rid themselves of their vassals in the area. It's killing two birds with one stone. And they have the perfect excuse of being tied up by the Buddhist Dao… they have nothing to fear."

He surveyed the entire situation, thinking to himself:

'Chengyun Gate is truly formidable. Their planning, before and after, has been flawless, and they've managed to distance themselves from everything completely. After all, when orchestrating something like this, even the puppeteer has to be wary.'

Qu Bushi didn't know what he was thinking and dared not speak. He saw Li Jiangqian suddenly become thoughtful.

"Guan Gongxiao… I believe he has a sister, named Guan Lingdie? I hear she is quite beautiful… hmm… the Saintess of the Demonic Dao… Has she been in Jiangbei recently?"
