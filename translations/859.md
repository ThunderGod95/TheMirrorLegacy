# Chapter 859: Retreat

Five Merciful Ones. That was a formation designed to handle a late-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert. With good coordination, they could stall a Great Daoist Master for a short time, let alone a mere early-stage cultivator like her.

She had no choice but to summon her Divine Ability. Two spots of brownish-yellow light bloomed beneath her feet. She pressed her palms together about a fist's length from her chest, lifted her head, and recited an incantation in her heart:

'Earth of the high scorch, turn to the Wu Light! Reveal the ultimate earth, birth metal and yang!'

In that single instant, a hazy, deep brown radiance rippled out from her body, as thick and steady as the earth itself. It spread out on both sides, enveloping her completely.

The moment the incantation finished in her mind, the five different artifacts of the surrounding Merciful Ones struck the Wu Light in unison. A violent, muffled boom echoed through the clouds. Zhu Gong’s expression shifted; the strain was obvious.

Although the Earth Virtue was formidable, her Wu Earth was not as indestructible as the fabled Manifestations Earth, which could withstand even lightning. Worse, her path to cultivation had been unorthodox; her Wu Earth was impure, tainted by the methods of demonic cultivators.

Under the combined assault of five Buddhist cultivators, the light shield flickered unstably, and faint wisps of dark, abyssal energy began to seep out. Two of the Merciful Ones glared, their eyes wide with fury. One spat a stream of golden sand while the other unleashed a torrent of fire, both crashing down upon the shimmering barrier.

'Damn it!'

She had no experience fighting the Northern Buddhists. Forced to activate her Divine Ability again, her eyes glowed with a kaleidoscopic light. She held one hand to her chest and covered her mouth with the back of the other. Taking a short breath, she shouted:

"Begone!"

The flame-wielding Merciful One beside her had no time to react. He cried out in pain and collapsed, clutching his face like a common mortal. A flaw had appeared in their encirclement. Seizing the opportunity, Zhu Gong channeled her Divine Ability once more, her body dissolving into a streak of light as she broke through their lines.

The Merciful One who had been struck by her spell art remained kneeling on the ground, blood pouring from his golden lips in a panicked flow. But the sand-spitting Merciful One remained composed, his experience showing. He drew his sword and rose, calling out a reminder.

"That was the 'Subjugating Crest' of Wu Earth! Take to the air and do not touch the ground! We are Buddhist cultivators, so the pain is amplified. As long as you don't panic, the wound is not that severe!"

The one who spoke was clearly their leader, his status higher than the others. The injured Merciful One gritted his teeth against the pain and flew into the air as instructed, and sure enough, he felt some relief. Not far away, Zhu Gong’s face was grim. As she prepared another Dharma Art, she cursed inwardly.

'That bald-headed donkey is sharp…'

Zhu Gong had stumbled upon a Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition by chance. The technique she cultivated was indeed the 'Subjugating Crest'. However, due to her ignorant and undisciplined youth, her cultivation was a mix of impurities. Though she had switched techniques before reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, hidden dangers remained. The 'Subjugating Crest' had been instrumental in her repeated victories against stronger foes. To have it seen through so easily was like losing an arm. A Dharma Art flared in her hand.

"Bald donkey! Try this one!" she roared.

She coughed violently, spitting out a mouthful of blood. From between her crimson lips, a globe of Wu Light, tinged with a colorful, hazy mist, shot toward the flame-spitting Merciful One she had just injured. It shrieked through the air. The other two Merciful Ones nearby cried out in alarm and rushed to intercept it.

But Zhu Gong’s shout was a deliberate feint, a classic misdirection. The moment the Wu Light reached them, it dissolved into harmless, colorful mist. At the same time, a tremor ran through the Great Void, and the true attack—a treasure-yellow beam of Wu Light—shot out like a venomous snake, biting at the back of the lead Merciful One's head.

'I have to take him out first! If I can't break one of their fingers, they'll surround and kill me!'

She knew full well she was no match for the five of them together. Her current advantage came from possessing one more Divine Ability than her opponents, a fleeting upper hand. Thus, her strike was utterly ruthless, born of a kill-or-be-killed desperation. A small silver bell materialized in the sky, following the Wu Light in its descent.

For a moment, three of the Merciful Ones were occupied. The leader had no choice but to raise his golden sword and face the treasure-yellow Wu Light head-on. "Hold!" he bellowed.

The sky filled with a brilliant radiance as a phantasm of the Buddhist Land appeared. Layers of treasure light, like countless veils of shimmering gauze, drifted down, attempting to smother the Wu Light with a sizzling sound.

*BOOM!*

But the Wu Light was like a burning coal dropped into a pile of cotton. It tore through the layers of resistance and finally slammed into the Merciful One's Dharma Body. A heart-wrenching scream tore from his lips. The silver bell followed close behind, about to strike him down. But with a final act of defiance, the Merciful One forced his eyes open. Ignoring the gaping holes the Wu Light was boring through his Dharma Body, he clenched his steel-like teeth and caught the silver bell in his mouth.

Trapping a spiritual artifact in one's mouth could only end in disaster. Not even a cultivator with a Body Divine Ability would dare such a thing, let alone a Merciful One. As expected, his eyes instantly exploded into a shower of golden dust, and countless dark-gold cracks spiderwebbed across his Dharma Body.

Seeing this, Zhu Gong felt no joy, only a surge of shock and rage.

The last of the Merciful Ones, who had vanished moments before, had traversed the Great Void. He now appeared behind her, wielding two golden hammers. His three-headed, six-armed Dharma Body simultaneously produced two mirrors and a pair of wooden fish, locking her down from all sides.

'So fast! What a powerful Dharma Body!'

Only then did the Daoist Master realize that this silent attacker was the true combat expert of the group. But her own spiritual artifacts were still deployed, and she couldn't recall them in time. She had no choice but to draw her Dharma Sword and fling a spirit shield from her sleeve to defend herself.

*CLANG!*

Zhu Gong’s spell arts were decent, but her other abilities were clearly lacking. The two spirit shields struggled in the air, emitting plumes of black smoke. As blood-refined artifacts, they were naturally suppressed by the dharma light of the Buddhist cultivators. The shields failed to block the attack completely. The two mirrors unleashed a dazzling golden radiance that shot directly into her eyes.

The 'Subjugating Crest' was a pure spell-based Divine Ability; unlike 'Audience with the Celestial Gate', it offered no enhancement to one’s physical body. How could Zhu Gong’s eyes withstand such a blast? Sparks flew, and in an instant, her eyes were reduced to blackened, smoldering sockets, from which two streams of scorched blood trickled down.

At the same moment, the silver bell burst from the lead Merciful One’s abdomen, blowing him into a cloud of fragments that rained down as golden sand.

*BOOM!*

'Trapping a spiritual artifact with his body... his end was even worse than mine would have been! To think he just returned to the Buddhist Land like that!'

The four remaining Merciful Ones showed not anger, but joy. They swiftly broke through the Great Void and completed their encirclement.

Zhu Gong had rarely fought against the Northern Buddhists, but these five Merciful Ones knew exactly how to deal with cultivators of the Immortal Dao. From the very start of the battle, they had shared a tacit understanding: trade a life for an injury.

Their positions as Merciful Ones were granted by the Buddhist Land. If they died, they died in service to Taixi. They would be compensated with new Dharma Bodies after death. But what about Zhu Gong? How many second chances did she have? A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's Dharma Body was not as critical as it was in the Foundation Establishment Realm, but a major injury sustained in battle could take a year and a half to recover from, if not longer.

As soon as the four closed in, they began chanting scriptures in unison. The sacred words resonated with the lingering power in her eye sockets, causing bursts of golden fire to erupt from the wounds, exploiting the weakness of her Dharma Body to continuously disrupt her.

Zhu Gong finally understood their strategy. A chill ran down her spine. She was now completely surrounded. The piercing pain from her eyes was making it difficult to cast her spell arts, warning her with every throb.

'If I don't leave now, I might never be able to!'

She forced herself to weave another Dharma Art, creating a shield of light around herself that barely held back the four-pronged assault. Her spiritual sense soared upward, seeking out the battle between Maha Taixi and Daoist Master Kui Qi high above.

The Daoist Master from Xiukui, still clad in black with one hand behind his back, looked composed. His Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword danced and flickered, weaving through a myriad of illusions amidst an endless sea of colorful light. Meanwhile, Maha Taixi's renowned Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl was pinned in mid-air by a black cord. Though it struggled to break free, it was always a fraction too slow, completely neutralized.

Daoist Master Kui Qi’s free hand conjured a point of dark light, from which streams of brilliance shot out, layering attack after attack upon Taixi. The horse-faced Maha was besieged by both the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword and the dark light, barely managing a stalemate with his powerful Dharma Body.

It was clear that, compared to her own desperate struggle, Daoist Master Kui Qi was not finding his fight with Taixi difficult at all. Zhu Gong’s anxiety mounted. The longer she held on, the more her confidence waned. As her spiritual energy dwindled and new injuries accumulated on her Dharma Body, she finally caught Daoist Master Kui Qi’s eye.

The Daoist Master saw her plight but showed no surprise. The three Divine Abilities in his hand continued to flow, and his spell arts grew even stronger, slowly forcing a grim expression onto Taixi’s face.

'Daoist friend Zhu Gong! Hold on for just another quarter of an hour, until I can unleash my Divine Ability!' a message entered her mind.

Zhu Gong’s heart sank. Before she could even reply to Kui Qi, the light shield around her dimmed drastically. The Merciful One who had blinded her with the mirrors spread his six arms, his eyes glowing crimson-gold as he activated some secret technique.

Sure enough, after just a few more exchanges, the golden fire in her eye sockets blazed more intensely. With a muffled crack, her defensive barrier shattered into pieces. Zhu Gong gathered her breath one last time, her Divine Ability surging.

"Begone!"

This time, being so close, the shout hit all four of them at once, causing them to collectively falter. The six-armed Merciful One, who was the closest, had golden blood stream from his nose. His eyes widened in rage as he charged again. Zhu Gong’s silver bell flew out to intercept him, but the other three were already upon her.

The burning golden light in her eye sockets and the inherent fragility of her Dharma Body were now glaring weaknesses. The 'Subjugating Crest' was a Divine Ability that excelled in single combat, not group battles. She was completely overwhelmed. She coughed up another mouthful of blood, which dissipated into a shower of golden light.

But what Zhu Gong could never have anticipated was that at this critical moment, a richly patterned demon-subduing lotus staff, glowing with a brilliant golden light, would pierce through the Great Void and strike her undefended back.

*BOOM!*

A massive cloud of mist exploded in the sky, accompanied by the sound of a landslide. The rain dissipated, replaced by a sky full of shattered rock and sand. Zhu Gong reappeared some distance away, her face deathly pale, her form coalescing from a cluster of golden light. A gaping hole in her chest offered a clear view of the scenery behind her—a void in the perfect shape of a lotus flower.

'Taixi! How is that possible!?'

The demon-subduing lotus showed her no mercy. The brilliant gold Treasured Artifact, far more formidable than the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl, instantly broke apart into a storm of razor-sharp petals that descended upon her Dharma Body.

"Hmph!"

Finally, a black cord shot out of the Great Void, blocking the majority of the lotus petals. It then released a dense black light that bound the treasure light hiding within the void. Even so, Zhu Gong was struck by three or five petals. Overwhelmed by dizziness, she coughed up another mouthful of blood.

An endless white mist fell over Taixi, trapping him. Daoist Master Kui Qi had clearly been forced to unleash his technique prematurely. He materialized in front of Zhu Gong, the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword pointed forward, startling the Merciful Ones into retreat.

His gloomy gaze fell upon the dark-gold demon-subduing lotus, and a name surfaced in his mind.

'Zhelu! This is the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions…'

Meanwhile, Zhu Gong, finally given a moment's respite, ignored everything else. The gaping wound on her chest rapidly regenerated flesh and skin as she plunged into the Great Void and vanished without a trace.

High above, Taixi wore a broad, triumphant smile, clearly in an excellent mood. "Daoist friend Kui Qi! You were still one step behind me!"

Daoist Master Kui Qi’s expression was thunderous. He swept his gaze over the assembled monks and nuns, said nothing more, and his face grew cold with disappointment. He, too, stepped into the Great Void and disappeared.

"Haha!"

The horse-faced Maha descended from the sky, immensely pleased with himself. The four remaining Merciful Ones fell to their knees in unison, shouting, "Congratulations, my lord! Felicitations, my lord!"

Taixi’s triumphant expression slowly morphed into a cold, grim look. He glanced at the spot where one of his Merciful Ones had died—a veteran, at that—and felt a pang of regret. "Years of hatred have been partially repaid today," he muttered. "If I weren't wary of that missing old monster from the Purple Smoke Gate, and if I weren't afraid that acting too rashly would provoke the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition into using some ultimate trump card in retaliation… this wouldn't have been so troublesome!"

He slowly suppressed the hatred in his eyes and looked down at the dark-gold, intricately patterned lotus in his palm. His expression was a mixture of greed and regret.

'A pity… such a fine Treasured Artifact, and it isn't even mine.'

"Let's go! Follow me back!"

***

In the Great Void.

Daoist Master Kui Qi strode through the emptiness, his Divine Ability propelling him forward, his face a mask of fury.

After suffering such a grievous wound, Zhu Gong would certainly not show herself again. He and she had no relationship to speak of; she would never expose her heavily injured self to anyone, not even to the man who had just saved her.

This meant that even trying to reason with the Daoist Master from the Eastern Sea was now impossible, which only deepened Kui Qi's gloom. He ground his teeth in frustration.

'The 'Subjugating Crest' is a technique that puts her on par with any Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but all its abilities are geared toward individuals. It's incredibly powerful in a one-on-one fight, but she hasn't mastered it. It’s no surprise she ended up like this against a group of Merciful Ones… but the sudden appearance of that Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions was also a factor!'

As a Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery, Kui Qi naturally knew what kind of Daoist tradition the 'Subjugating Crest' belonged to. The Monastery itself possessed the immortal foundation for it. Kui Qi probably understood her Divine Ability better than Zhu Gong herself!

"Such a fine Immortal Dao Divine Ability, and she trained it into such a mismatched mess… It seems she obtained an incomplete Daoist tradition… How could a Daoist tradition of Wu Earth be so easy to come by?"

After observing her for just a short while, Kui Qi could already deduce the origin of her Divine Ability. He sighed inwardly.

'It looks like a substitute path, not the orthodox one. But a Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition is so powerful that even a narrow path is a highway to the heavens in this age, allowing her to reach the Purple Mansion Realm.'

His expression soon grew heavy. He pinched his fingers together, performing a quick divination, and his eyes narrowed.

"Zhelu is still just testing the waters. He might not dare to push Tinglan and Ning Wan to the brink… But allowing them to be trapped in the north, without enough manpower to make the enemy pay or to reclaim our honor… This would be a great blow to the prestige of the Supreme Yang Dao, and it would only make the Northern Buddhists more arrogant…"

Tinglan and Ning Wan both had plenty of trump cards, but Buddhist cultivators excelled at trapping people with formations. If one was careless enough to fall into their trap, escape was difficult. Daoist Master Kui Qi wasn't truly afraid for their lives; he was afraid this was a deliberate ploy to humiliate the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition.

'I absolutely cannot let this go! The other cultivators are unwilling to interfere in Jiangbei's affairs, but that doesn't mean you Buddhist cultivators can plot against us as you please…'

'It's a shame about Hengzhu. He's still resentful over what happened back then and has grown disillusioned. He refuses to get involved in these matters anymore… Otherwise, we wouldn't be in such a sorry state!'

'The Chen Clan has always been amicable; persuading them shouldn't be difficult. Old Master Yuming is also reasonable, and Daoist Master Shanbai by the coast is on good terms with my sect. They are all reliable. Daoist friend Lingmei is also very likely to lend a hand. If he makes a move, the matter is halfway settled. As long as we can break through Taixi's blockade, Zhelu, though powerful, cannot withstand an attack from both within and without.'

With the reputation of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the relationships they had built over many years, a call to arms against the notorious Zhelu would surely rally many Daoist Masters to their cause.

"But there is one problem. Daoist Masters Yuming and Shanbai are both near Cultivation Transcendence, which was once under the Northern Sect's jurisdiction. The relationship has been awkward for a long time. With the Monarch having gone beyond the heavens and the Yue Cultivating Sect sealing their mountains, it's probably inconvenient for the two of them to travel."

When Daoist Master Kui Qi mentioned Cultivation Transcendence, his tone was complicated—a mix of intimacy and awkwardness. And when he mentioned that True Monarch of the Yue Cultivating Sect, his use of the word "Monarch" was filled with profound respect.

But the Great Void was silent and empty. The thought passed in an instant, and Daoist Master Kui Qi's mind turned to Daoist Master Zhaojing from the lake.

"And of all times, he had to be absent… Every Divine Ability has its purpose. Perhaps in one-to-one combat, Zhaojing is no match for Zhu Gong… but against the Merciful Ones, 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' is far more useful than 'Subjugating Crest'!"

"Tinglan’s idea wasn't wrong. Li Ximing is a Li, after all. Though the entire Li family couldn't make half a ripple under Luoxia… it’s always good to avoid suspicion… But now, in this situation, a fight against Buddhist cultivators… The Li Clan would certainly be willing to lend a hand, which gives us a perfect excuse to bring him back…"

"Moongaze Lake…"

He flew from that spot, traversing the Great Void without a moment's rest, heading straight south. Soon, he emerged from the void and saw the lake being lashed by a torrential downpour.

Faced with such violent weather, the Li Clan was clearly on high alert. The glow of Dharma Arts flickered across the lake's surface, and he could even see many cultivators in the attire of the Purple Smoke Gate. Daoist Master Kui Qi observed for a moment before descending.

He was met by a man in black robes with gray eyes and long eyebrows. The man's eyes widened in shock upon seeing him. He flew up, performed a deep bow with the utmost reverence, and said, "Greetings, My Lord. This humble one is Chen Yang of Moongaze, currently on patrol. I never expected to encounter a celestial presence. If My Lord has any decree, please grace me with your words. This subordinate will surely serve as your steed and deliver your message with his life."

Kui Qi waved his sleeve. "Take me to your clan head," he said casually.

While those words, which showed a measure of respect, the Daoist Master had no intention of flying there slowly. Chen Yang felt the world spin, and in the next moment, he was standing before the main hall. Kui Qi said nothing more, and Chen Yang, taking the hint, went inside to announce him.

Kui Qi stood with his hands behind his back, studying the man's features. His own Divine Ability gave him some insight into such things, and he made a silent assessment.

'This man has a grim look. Bowing, he's a hawk or a hound; standing straight, he could be a man of character. For the Li Clan to have such a servant is as good as having a fine Treasured Artifact. Moongaze Lake gathers talent; its fortune and atmosphere far surpass the southern prefectures.'

The thought had barely passed when a figure in crimson robes hurried out of the hall. With head bowed and eyes lowered, he spoke respectfully, "I was unaware of which Daoist Master had graced us with their presence. This lowly one failed to welcome you from afar. I am filled with trepidation and beg for your forgiveness."

The robed Daoist Master strode inside, admired the hall's decor, and took a seat in the master's chair. He raised an eyebrow.

"Kui Qi, of the Great Xiukui Monastery."

Li Jiangqian had already guessed as much, figuring the situation in the north had worsened. He bowed respectfully in the hall. Kui Qi, however, observed him for a moment, frowning to himself.

'Li Zhouwei truly has some skill. I can't quite get a read on this eldest son either. But then again, few from the main line of the Wei-Li clan are good people…'

He quickly dismissed the thought, his eyes fixed on the teacup on the table. "Where is Daoist friend Zhaojing?" he asked.

Li Jiangqian was unsure of his intentions and had no idea if this man had been sent by Qian Lizi. He revealed nothing, saying respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, the Old Ancestor should still be in the Eastern Sea."

He made no mention of Qian Lizi's request for aid or talk of Zhaojing's return.

Kui Qi simply traced the rim of the teacup with its jade lid. His pale gray eyes darkened. "You must have felt it," he said softly. "Trouble has stirred in Jiangbei. The Buddhist cultivators started it, in retaliation against Azure Pond and Purple Smoke… Purple Smoke's grievances with the Buddhist cultivators have been complicated in recent years, and Ning Tiaoxiao left behind a great deal of trouble."

"As for the current situation in the north, Zhu Gong is seriously injured and will not be showing herself. The one who wounded her was Taixi, the same person who ambushed Tinglan. Do you know of Taixi?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head.

"Li Xuanfeng," Kui Qi stated. "He was the one responsible."

"Right now, Tinglan has been ambushed. I saw that her life is not in danger, so I presume they simply want to keep her out of Jiangbei's affairs. This Daoist Master hopes that Daoist friend Zhaojing will return. Your family cannot avoid this matter."

The Daoist Master stared at the tea, his tone seemingly gentler than when he was talking to Zhu Gong. "I understand your concerns. I am not asking you to manage the affairs of Jiangbei. Quite the opposite. Having Zhaojing strike at the Buddhist cultivators now is to prevent him from being forced to intervene later when Jiangbei spirals out of control. What is needed now is to land a heavy blow on the Buddhist cultivators. On this point, I imagine the Li Clan has hated them for a long time."

Kui Qi looked at the two men quietly. "Whether from the standpoint of personal relations or the larger situation, rescuing Tinglan now is the choice that best serves the interests of Moongaze Lake. It is the choice that allows Moongaze to avoid getting entangled in Jiangbei. If Zhaojing extends a helping hand at this time, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition will certainly remember it."

Having said his piece, he placed the jade cup down. "Moongaze Lake can weigh the importance of this matter for itself," he said softly.

It was obvious. While both he and Qian Lizi wanted Li Ximing to return to Jiangnan, Kui Qi's status and his argument were on an entirely different level. His words laid out the stakes and the benefits, making for a far more compelling case.

More importantly, this Daoist Master Kui Qi was the de facto master of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's Great Xiukui Monastery, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. When he spoke with such gravity, who would dare to say no?
