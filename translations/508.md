# Chapter 765: Great Supreme Chan

The Five-Eyed Merciful One twisted his fingers to seize Xu Mu’s fate and calculate. His vision turned hazy, and soon, a great lake emerged before him. The rippling blue waters of the lake formed the outline of a crescent moon.

Towering peaks surrounded the lake. The islets within were either sealed by thunder or lush with verdant grass. The scenery was as tranquil and clear as moonlight. He studied it carefully and thought to himself, This should be Moongaze Marsh, one of the ancient Seven Lakes and Four Marshes... Now it’s merely Moongaze Lake... The Water Mansion of the Five Water Virtues, the authority over lakes and marshes, no longer manifests, and thus it has declined to this state...

As he continued his deductions, he suddenly caught sight of a young man in white. The youth had sword-like brows and starry eyes, while his body was cloaked in frost and snow. In his hand, a green-white sword radiated a piercing light.

Just then, a voice called out by his ear, “Li Xijun!”

The Five-Eyed Merciful One studied his face. His heart stirred as his eyes burned with desire. He then revealed a look of joy, This... is good... A face as if carved, his brow cold and sharp, his heart pure and bones of ice. Adept at severing mortal ties, he’s cold as winter snow and utterly merciless. He suits my Way of Emptiness even more than Xu Mu! I lost a copper sword, yet gained a blade of frost!

His heart surged with joy, thoroughly satisfied, And to think this man killed one of my Arhats! To kill and create karma is the greatest kind of karmic link! I don’t even need to go through great lengths to sever his fate and convert him, there’s already cause for him to fall into my hands!

The Merciful One scattered the divination, formed hand seals and chanted incantations. Radiant light burst forth from the back of his head as he observed carefully from the great void. He reached into his robes with a golden-lacquered arm and retrieved a small copper sword.

The copper sword had already snapped in two. Holding it in his palm, he began to chant, “In this place, the first boundless life is born of the great void. The five-eyed one seeks the cause of the broken sword, to fulfill the fruit of my Dao lineage... and bring salvation to all beings...”

Golden light shone from the Merciful One’s face as his eyes grew hazy. Soon, Li Xijun’s face appeared before him, and he couldn’t help but nod slowly, To divine him so easily... indeed, someone with no background or entanglements... Good...

The Five-Eyed Merciful One was a seasoned and ancient being, and had attempted reincarnation twice already. His divination arts stemmed from the extremely effective prophetic techniques of the late Zhou dynasty, but if one miscalculated when it came to a True Monarch, it could very well cost one’s life.

He was experienced enough to be well aware of the taboos. First, he used Xu Mu to calculate the fate of the Yu Family, then conducted further deduction at Moongaze Lake. Aside from Li Tongya, who had killed a Maha and whose parents’ fate remained obscure, the rest of the Li Family were ordinary enough that drawing their names revealed their faces.

Then there is no need to worry! thought the Five-Eyed Merciful One

The youth’s complexion was pale, and his eyes were tightly shut. He must have suffered greatly at Xu Mu’s hands. The Merciful One found this entirely reasonable, and the finger that had rested on his middle digit gently lifted.

Rumble.

The Merciful One felt like the heavens themselves had collapsed beside his ears. A burst of golden-white sparks exploded before his eyes, sending pain slicing through his heart like a drill. In the span of a single held breath, the back of his head turned icy cold, as though a pair of massive hands had reached into his soul and forcefully yanked it upward.

Woe!

Once again, he felt both spirit and flesh shatter. Something misty spilled down his face, leaving his limbs limp. His soul seemed to fly from his body, yet also felt trapped within. Hallucinations flickered before his eyes, alternating between light and dark, and then, he lost all consciousness.

Within the mirror’s world.

“They’ve finally arrived!” Lu Jiangxian materialized in mid-air like mist. The azure sword in his hand let out a faint cry, easing the tension in his heart.

Chi Buzi and the Water Mansion Immortal Official had obtained numerous Foundation Establishment Realm techniques, many of which included spell arts. For instance, Li Xizhi’s Dawn Dew Gathering Technique came with six supplementary spells, three secret techniques, as well as a footwork technique, escape spell, and other spell types. There was everything one could need.

He had originally been revising these one by one within the Mirror World. Azure Pond had many techniques and spell arts, so modifying the techniques was simple enough. Remove the head and tail, repackage them, and they could be granted freely.

But the spell arts were far more conspicuous, since most had been created by Azure Pond Sect and had its own distinct personal flair. Some were even famous; one glance was all it would take to recognize them.

He had no choice but to select a few spell arts of suitable grade, cross-reference them, and make careful edits. Although he had seen countless techniques and spell arts, writing them wasn’t something that could be done in a day.

Who would’ve thought that barely any time would pass before a buddhist cultivator attacked the Li Family?

Xu Mu, or rather, Yu Mujian, did not have particularly high sword cultivation, but he had a unique mindset. Clinging to a single phrase Li Tongya once spoke, he had hidden that sword strike for decades. When it was finally unleashed, it bore all the sharpness and killing intent of a true killer blow. In that instant, its power had nearly rivaled Li Xuanfeng’s full-force attack, reaching the pinnacle of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Though several Golden Core Realm cultivators had gone to the Outer Heavens, they were all too familiar with the methods of Daoist Masters and True Monarchs. This could very well be bait to lure the snake from its den. Lu Jiangxian didn’t believe for a moment that no one from Yue State was watching him. It would be best not to use the Supreme Yin Profound Light if possible.

So, he fully activated the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed, calming Li Xijun’s mind to a state of perfect clarity. Then, by combining it with the azure sword left behind by Li Chejing, he achieved a state akin to possession, allowing the youth to comprehend and wield the sword.

This is the lowest-risk method I could come up with...

Were it not for the immortal art he possessed, he would never have been able to make it look so seamless. After all, this was only a minor move at the Foundation Establishment Realm, an inspiration-born sword strike that left no trace.

Li Xijun also carried a talisman seed within him, which theoretically should’ve concealed anything unusual. Since everything seemed under control, Lu Jiangxian had paused his work to assist.

But the Merciful One’s divinations had begun tracing their way back, testing each step cautiously. Lu Jiangxian watched coldly and thought, Even the Jinlian Maha back then couldn’t detect anything wrong. What can a mere little Merciful One possibly see?

Sure enough, a few seconds later, the Five-Eyed Merciful One boldly began his divinations. Lu Jiangxian’s heart stirred, and an idea struck him. He rapped the table and an endless white jade palace from years past appeared before him.

Now, the intricate incantations etched around the hall were no longer mere decorative script, but true spellforms calculated using Metallic Essence and immortal arts. They were enough to mesmerize any who laid eyes on them.

Even his immortal seat was different; it had been remodeled from an altar. It was majestic and imposing as it stood high above the ground. Below it, endless white mist poured forth, forming countless shifting shapes.

This white mist had come from years of observing Purple Mansion Realm breakthroughs and Golden Core Realm cultivators battle. Combined with immortal arts, it truly contained the wondrous nature of Metallic Essence. Even a True Monarch might be stunned upon seeing it.

After arranging everything with care, he sat calmly upon the throne, and brought the Five-Eyed Merciful One before the hall as a radiant light bloomed upon his face.

The Five-Eyed Merciful One slowly regained consciousness. The first thing that entered his vision was a radiant white surface. It was smooth and crystal-clear, though bright white patterns could be seen through the pale layer. Just one glance made his head spin.

The terror in his heart only rose as he gradually came to his senses. He dared not lift his head and simply stared at the white mist curling around his legs. His heart felt frozen, and the chill was not helping his dizziness.

His teeth chattered as he muttered, “It’s over... I’ve provoked someone far beyond me...”

Hearing no movement, the Merciful One slowly raised his head and his heart nearly burst from terror. A vast, boundless hall stretched before him. Pristine jade pillars soared into the clouds, and at the highest point sat a man clad in white.

His face radiated dazzling light, so white and brilliant that the Merciful One winced in pain. His garments exuded celestial grace as he leaned upon a lofty jade immortal seat. The light cascading from him transformed into the myriad forms of lifelike and vivid sentient beings once the rays hit the ground.

This... this! His eyes felt like they were on the verge of bleeding, and upon seeing the immortal seat soaring into the heavens, his heart went hollow. Only one thought remained in his mind, An immortal?!

Lu Jiangxian gazed at the Five-Eyed Merciful One on the ground. He rested one hand gently on the jade seat, composed and unhurried.

This was the second time someone had divined his true form. But he was no longer the Lu Jiangxian of the past; he had risen far above that. Moreover, what stood before him now wasn’t the Maha Jinlian who briefly could trap him, but merely a Merciful One of the Way of Emptiness. He was no better than a fish slab falling into his hand.

He gestured discreetly and a golden radiance bloomed in his palm. Morning mist churned and thoughts flickered within it. Bit by bit, the Merciful One’s memories surfaced, each idea from his mind laid bare.

I’ll just wait and watch, thought the Merciful One.

Lu Jiangxian remained silent, as if cultivating in seclusion. The Merciful One trembled on the floor for a moment, his terror far beyond its limit. When he looked up, he was struck again by the blinding brilliance of the immortal seat above. It was vast and overwhelming, so he could only lower his gaze to the floor again.

He squirmed on the ground for a moment, legs pressed together as he slowly scooted backward. Yet the hall held no other scenery aside from the radiance. It was so still that there was not a sound to be heard. He felt like he had moved for a long time, then he glanced around.

Nothing had changed in any direction. He was still kneeling in the exact same spot.

Putting on a full display of fear and dread, the Merciful One could only say in a sorrowful tone, “This humble cultivator greets the Exalted Immortal... I have sullied the immortal hall through my intrusion... and am stricken with shame and dread.”

At last, a cool and indifferent voice descended from above, echoing through the hall, “What era is this now...”

That one line sent thunder through the Merciful One’s heart and he immediately concluded, He’s not searching my soul; that must mean he’s a righteous immortal. And to ask about the state of the world... he must be an immortal from before the heavenly upheaval. Such divine power yet ignorance of worldly affairs, there must be a flaw. Most likely, he has been sealed in this hall! That’s the only reason for such a question!

He spoke in a low voice, “Reporting to the Exalted Immortal, the Wei Dynasty has been gone for over seventeen hundred years.”

A pause of silence from above, then another question followed, “Where is Li Qianyuan?”

The Merciful One felt a chill run down his spine. Trembling, he replied, “The Great Ancestor of Wei has long since fallen. In Mount Luoxia, a True Monarch stands just a step away from attaining the Bright Yang Fruition.”

Lu Jiangxian glanced at his palm; the memory was already half-recovered. He asked again, offhandedly, “I see the Fruition Attainments of old left hanging, do you know where they’ve all gone?”

The Merciful One was stunned by the question. Understanding dawned, and he thought, I’ve heard that even Dharma Masters cannot perceive whether the Fruition Attainments are occupied... He must be an immortal beyond doubt.

He kowtowed repeatedly, replying aloud, “This humble one has managed to live a little longer thanks to the art of reincarnation, over seven hundred years now! In my youth, I lived during the reign of Fu Qiyan, and heard many tales from that time.”

The five-eyed Merciful One continued quickly, “This humble one’s knowledge is shallow, but back then... I heard that among the Ancient Merging Techniques, the Yue Cultivating inheritance was seized by True Monarch Taiyue when Liang State fell and Zhao State rose. The Jade True figure relinquished their Fruition Attainment and departed, while the Whole Pill master was severely wounded and slain by Dongfang Weiming and Dongfang Weixi...

“As for the rest of the major events... I truly do not know...”

He trembled as he finished speaking. Lu Jiangxian listened attentively before casually asking, “What of the Buddhist Dao now?”

At last, this touched upon the Merciful One’s expertise. He let out a long breath of relief and answered respectfully, “Exalted Immortal! The Buddhist Dao has long been fractured ever since Suxikong and Shijiali, the last two Revered Ones, parted ways after a failed discourse, each leaving the realm. It is now divided into seven Daos...

“They are Emptiness, Virtuous, Wrath, Great Desire, Discipline, Compassion, and Dharma Realm.

“With the exception of the Way of Wrath, which was plotted against before and after, resulting in the Dharma Master failing to respond and all Mahas perishing... the rest still have Dharma Masters holding the line...”

Lu Jiangxian listened in silence, as the Merciful One gave him a general sense of the northern Buddhist sects’ current strength.

He asked softly, “How many Revered Ones remain?”

The Five-Eyed Merciful One lay prostrate on the ground, racking his brains. He rehearsed his words like lightning in his mind, repeatedly and with care, before answering with a trembling voice, “It is said... that one still responds.”

As soon as he spoke, the mist and radiance before him began to surge and shift, manifesting various forms. A voice drifted down, “Their title.”

The Merciful One’s lips quivered as if waging an internal battle. His mouth moved repeatedly before he finally replied, “Great Supreme Chan... Celestial Acarya.”

He dared not pronounce the full name, deliberately pausing in the middle. After finishing, his voice trembled uncontrollably, and he lay flat on the white tiles like a tiny, helpless ant.

From above, a voice slowly drifted down, “Oh?”

Though faintly surprised, the tone carried a trace of inquiry, and it stirred endless speculation in the Merciful One’s heart. Though he dared not dwell on it, a thrill surged through him, as though he had glimpsed some ancient secret that made his legs tremble.

Why respond this way... why such a reply... could it be that the Great Supreme Chan attained the Revered One’s seat by... At that thought, a sudden shiver ran through him. Terrified, he dared not think further, and the immortal above him remained silent.

The golden radiance in Lu Jiangxian’s hand had reached its fullness, and he now held the Merciful One’s complete memory. There was no need for further questions.

The question now is how to deal with him... he pondered for a moment.

Below, the Merciful One’s heart was in utter chaos. He opened his mouth to beg for mercy, only to find he could no longer speak. All he could do was kowtow furiously, slamming his head into the ground like he was pounding garlic.

Lu Jiangxian watched quietly as he calculated, This Merciful One’s physical body still resides in the Great Void. If I kill him outright, under the eyes of many, a single divination about his sudden death might reveal traces. Perhaps even a True Monarch or a Dharma Master is observing...

At the same time, wiping his memory... would be far too lenient.

The grand hall echoed with the sound of desperate kowtowing. Lu Jiangxian watched for a while, feeling somewhat like a man with tasteless food he couldn’t bring himself to throw away. He thought, One mere Merciful One... and one who served near a Maha at that. If anything goes awry, it’ll be noticed instantly! Any backup plans will be useless, leaving nothing but a trail of clues.

He waited a moment longer, as he continued to speculate, What’s more, from the buddhist cultivators’ perspective, Xu Mu died at Li Xijun’s hand. It’d be strange indeed if this Merciful One let him go so easily, Li Xijun walking away unscathed is suspicious in itself...

He paused, considering quietly, Either he dies swiftly and without a trace... or he must become utterly obedient.

Lu Jiangxian glanced calmly around. His tone turned colder as he spoke softly, “Five-Eyed!”

The Merciful One instantly felt his lips and tongue unseal. Overwhelmed with joy and tears, he cried out in misery, “Exalted Immortal...”

Lu Jiangxian’s voice was low and haunting as he murmured, “I have dwelled in this hall for many years... Though you are a heretical outcast... you may yet be of use.”

The Merciful One kowtowed in terror. “I shall act solely on the Exalted Immortal’s command!”
