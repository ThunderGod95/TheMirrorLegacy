### Chapter 736: Taking Stock

Li Ximing streaked across the Great Void, his form materializing in the sky above the untamed wilderness. He pushed up a sleeve, revealing the back of his hand where a speck of purple light pulsed with a sullen glow.

During the recent chase and clash, he had exchanged several blows with Yehui, who had managed to leave a wound on him. The injury was trivial, however, having almost no effect on his Dharma Body. He estimated it would take an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator half a month to heal, but his own Audience with the Celestial Gate technique was exceptionally skilled at grinding away foreign dharma power. It would likely take him only two or three days.

He examined it closely, then raised his other hand and swiped it across the back of the first, slicing off the afflicted piece of flesh. He held it up, studying it for a moment with a thoughtful expression before letting it merge back into his hand.

'For a typical Purple Mansion cultivator, if a part of their Dharma Body sustains too much damage, they can simply discard it and mold a new one. It's just a matter of which method is less time-consuming. But since I can suppress and nullify the damage, direct healing is usually faster. Other Purple Mansion cultivators likely have their own methods.'

With that thought, he descended. Below, cultivators moved to and fro. Not wishing to cause a scene with the requisite kneeling and bowing, Li Ximing casually veiled himself with an illusion and walked straight past the crowds.

He arrived before the main hall just as Kong Guxi was stepping out. The man named Fu Yuezi followed dutifully behind him, a golden spear and a golden axe strapped to his back. Of the other guest elders from the Profound Peak Gate, only a man named Sun Bai was willing to walk a few extra steps to offer some courteous words.

"Sect Master, please wait. Allow me to see to your injuries."

Sun Bai formed a hand seal and began to heal Kong Guxi. Li Ximing glanced over them. Among the Profound Peak cultivators, only Fu Yuezi and Sun Bai were truly presentable.

Sun Bai, a cultivator of the Verdant Grove lineage, specialized in healing and restoration. He had been protected as fiercely as any Li clansman during the battle, so his value was self-evident. As for Fu Yuezi, his Immortal Foundation was the Heavenly Gilded Helm, and he possessed considerable skill, enough to be ranked on the same level as Ding Weizeng within the Li clan.

Kong Guxi had performed exceptionally well in the great battle, advancing and retreating with sound judgment, but he had also sustained grievous wounds. Li Ximing naturally had to see him. He let his form become visible. Kong Guxi had been speaking politely with Sun Bai, but when his eyes caught the coalescing celestial light, he was so startled he immediately dropped to his knees.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

A wave of kneeling spread through the area. The Jade Court Guards on both sides dropped their polearms and knelt, the weapons clattering crisply on the ground.

"Rise," Li Ximing acknowledged.

The moment Kong Guxi saw him, the anxiety in his heart vanished completely, replaced by a surge of joy. The deep furrows in his brow smoothed out. But joy was swiftly followed by trepidation, and his face settled into an expression of reverence and submission.

Li Ximing had only recently reached the Purple Mansion Realm, while Yehui was at the mid-stage. Although Kong Guxi knew it was difficult for one Purple Mansion cultivator to truly defeat another, he couldn't help but worry. Seeing Li Ximing's calm demeanor brought him more relief than the successful defense of the wilderness. Yet, with the matter of Mount Jingyi still unresolved, he couldn't help but feel a sense of dread.

Li Ximing’s spiritual sense swept over him, taking in his condition at a glance. The man’s lower body was nothing but a skeleton, an injury inflicted by a Capital Guard Dao lineage that wielded sharp, baleful attacks.

'It must have been the Western Heaven Plateau.'

Kong Guxi himself cultivated the Fool's Mountain Chase, which offered no special resilience to his physical body. Li Ximing waved his sleeve, and the life-giving force of Bright Yang descended upon Kong Guxi. The man felt an itch at his wounds and a warmth spreading through him as his flesh began to regenerate, allowing him to stand firmly on the ground once more.

The power of Bright Yang could restore flesh and blood, but not one's cultivation. Still, it spared Kong Guxi the effort of taking medicine. The Profound Peak's sect master knelt again, his voice filled with gratitude.

"Thank you, Daoist Master!"

Behind him, the wounds on Fu Yuezi also began to close. However, his Immortal Foundation refined his Dharma Body to be ferocious in battle, which also made injuries harder to heal. The momentary recovery was only skin-deep; he would need to reforge the damaged parts later. He lowered his head and knelt alongside Kong Guxi.

'This one is utterly loyal,' Li Ximing noted. He had observed Fu Yuezi earlier. The man fought with true ferocity and had risked his life to save his fellow Profound Peak cultivators.

Li Ximing paused. Though he held out little hope, he still had to ask, "What is the situation at Mount Jingyi?"

Kong Guxi could only recount the news he had received. Li Ximing shook his head, thinking grimly, 'Shanji Prefecture is lost.'

Kong Guxi was still fraught with anxiety. Though the blame couldn't be laid at his feet, he maintained a fearful posture.

"I will make a trip to Mount Jingyi when the opportunity arises," Li Ximing said casually. "In the meantime, I need to borrow your Wood Virtue guest elder for a while."

Sun Bai was competent and his Immortal Foundation was useful. The Li clan's own Funan territory was a wreck, with everyone wounded. It was a request Li Zhouwei might find awkward to make, so Li Ximing made it himself.

His dismissal of the Mount Jingyi matter was a great relief to Kong Guxi. At the request to borrow Sun Bai, Kong Guxi pressed his forehead to the ground. "Daoist Master jests," he said respectfully. "Before his passing, our patriarch instructed that we are to obey all of your commands. Never mind Guest Elder Sun, all of the Profound Peak Gate's affairs are subject to the Daoist Master's will. This junior has no right to object and no desire to overstep. I only await your immortal command."

Li Ximing had long known the man was obedient and easy to manage, so he wasn't surprised. His gaze swept over the crowd. "The battle is over for now. All of you, go to the Xuanmiao Temple. Don't be shy with Sumian."

He transformed into a ray of celestial light and vanished, leaving the members of the Kong clan staring at each other. Kong Guxi, who was laughed at during Changxi’s death, had no real desire to go to the Xuanmiao Temple. But his people's injuries were truly severe, so he had no choice but to lead them there on the wind.

Meanwhile, Li Ximing phased into the main hall. Li Zhouwei's eyes lit up, and he stepped down from the main seat. Before he could speak, Li Ximing laughed heartily. "Such a magnificent display of power."

Li Zhouwei knew he was referring to the matter with Guan Kan. He chuckled in response and summoned an attendant. "Bring Miaoshui here."

Only then did he turn back to Li Ximing. "As expected, that Yehui was no match for you, Daoist Master. The old master sent me three consecutive letters. I can finally give him a proper reply."

Li Xuanxuan was back at the lake, but his thoughts were still on the riverfront battles. Li Ximing nodded with a smile. Li Zhouwei hadn't brought the matter up for no reason. He immediately followed up with a sigh. "Unfortunately... Elder Siwei was captured. I sent men to intercept them, but once Situ Mo left our territory, he retreated into his mountain gate and hasn't moved since. We sent messengers to inquire, but the Golden Tang Gate has given no response..."

"The master mentioned this repeatedly in his letters. I don't know how I should answer him."

'An Siwei captured...'

Li Ximing felt a headache coming on. Though An Siwei's strength was lacking and he had no special Dao lineage, he was a loyal retainer who had served for many years. The An family had intermarried with the Li for a century. In truth, An Siwei's status was no different from that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator with the surname Li.

He understood Li Zhouwei's meaning and said gravely, "We must first get a clear picture of the situation. If An Siwei is still at the Golden Tang Gate, or if he's been sent west, we might have a chance through the Golden Feather Sect. But if he was sent to the White Ye Immortal Sect... then things will be much more difficult."

Li Zhouwei nodded with a thoughtful look. "When I fought that Guan Kan, I reached a critical moment and a White Qilin phenomenon manifested. It saved me, but it also accidentally killed him. I have no idea what his status is in the Capital immortals Dao."

Li Ximing hesitated for a moment before Li Zhouwei continued, his expression serious, "Regarding the Profound Peak Gate, while our clan did act out of friendship, from another perspective... for all the powers surrounding them, this was nothing more than a feast to divide the spoils."

"The Capital immortals Dao came south. Whether they gained much or little, they still profited. The Xuanmiao Temple and our Moongaze Lake, who helped the Profound Peak Gate, were in a sense also encroaching. There were no losers in this great battle. The only thing that happened was that the Profound Peak Gate's centuries-old foundation was served up on a platter..."

He shook his head, a hint of unease on his face. "From Guan Gongxiao's attitude, the battle on the river was about flexing muscles and showing strength, to see who would get a bigger share. But now, a man with the surname Guan is dead. I'm afraid Guan Kan has some important bloodline or background. If this incites a true war between our two sides, that would be real trouble."

Hearing Li Zhouwei's analysis, Li Ximing nodded slightly. He had sensed something similar from Yehui's attitude. 'Compared to his callousness toward Changxi, Yehui seemed to maintain an ambiguous attitude of not wanting to completely fall out with me from start to finish... It seems that to these Purple Mansion cultivators... the lives of certain Foundation Establishment cultivators aren't worth a frown.'

The two conferred for a moment, and Li Zhouwei set the matter aside. "Besides," he added, "I revealed my phenomenon. I fear it has been noticed by those with ill intentions, which is not a good thing."

Li Ximing nodded and sighed. "Now I understand why these Purple Mansion cultivators need to raise capable Foundation Establishment subordinates. If we had one or two more skilled players, you wouldn't have had to enter the fray yourself! How are your injuries?"

"They are severe, but not debilitating."

Li Zhouwei's wounds were not light, but they didn't affect his daily functions.

"Have Sun Bai come see you," Li Ximing instructed. "Tomorrow, I'll take a trip to the Eastern Sea. I'll hunt some demons and refine their essences with the clan's treasure medicines. I'll have you healed in no time. Once you've recovered, take the Talisman Pill and enter seclusion. Your priority is to break through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment."

After settling these matters, Li Ximing looked around to ensure no one was listening in the Great Void, then spoke via a secret voice transmission technique.

"Regarding the Talisman Qi conferment, what are Minghuang's thoughts?"

Li Zhouwei had been wanting to ask about this. He seized the opportunity and replied, "Daoist Master, now that you've reached the Purple Mansion Realm, has there been any change in your Talisman Qi?"

Li Ximing paused for a moment, then shook his head. "None. It's the same as always. It can manipulate fire and draw in Qi to refine my dharma power. Before reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, I rarely fought, so I was the least skilled among my brothers at using the Talisman Qi. Furthermore, my Audience with the Celestial Gate technique can already command fire, so for the moment, I can't discern its full capabilities."

Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment. "This junior's thoughts are as follows... First, the clan's Purple Mansion grand array has not yet been constructed. The ritual to request the Talisman Qi is a major event that will attract a lot of attention. Many Purple Mansion cultivators are watching our clan because of me, so it's best to be cautious. If we absolutely must do it, it should at least be performed at the Profound Peak Gate's mountain."

"There is another point..." Li Zhouwei hesitated, then continued in a low voice, transmitting his words with dharma power. "Since this junior is about to reach the late stage of Foundation Establishment anyway, wouldn't the ability of the Talisman Qi to enhance cultivation be wasted? Why not wait until... this junior also breaks through to the Purple Mansion Realm. With two Daoist Masters in our clan, plus our immortal artifact, could we not plan a trip to the Southern Borderlands or the Four Seas to bring back a Purple Mansion demon..."

"At that time, we could also observe the differences in its various mystical properties... Perhaps this method could even aid in cultivating divine abilities... Used unexpectedly, it could even become a trump card."

"A Purple Mansion demon?!"

Li Ximing had never considered such a possibility. He was genuinely stunned. Having reached the Purple Mansion Realm himself, he knew how difficult it was to corner and kill a cultivator of that level. But as he thought it through, he realized that while difficult, it wasn't a reason to dismiss Li Zhouwei's idea. After all, the Talisman Qi for a Foundation Establishment cultivator could still advance one's cultivation. It would be better to use it to advance a divine ability than waste it on the final push to the late stage...

"Good..." he nodded repeatedly. The two of them reined in their thoughts just as Qu Bushi requested permission and entered from outside the hall.

"Greetings, Clan Head, Daoist Master," he knelt. "I have brought the Daoist Miaoshui."

Behind him was a sturdy-looking stone coffin. The old man opened the lid, revealing a woman lying within. Her body was severed into three parts at the neck and waist. Her abdomen was empty, with nothing but a shriveled heart left in her thoracic cavity.

"Daoist Miaoshui was cut into three pieces. Although we managed to neutralize the dharma power at the wounds in time and gave her a Wanling Flower, her life was still hanging by a thread. The Clan Head had Guest Elder Sun piece her back together... and with the secrets of my Palace of Concealed Storage art, we barely managed to preserve her."

The old man, though cunning and better at fleeing than fighting, possessed a compassionate heart. He frowned at Miaoshui's state and pleaded, "I have gotten to know her over the years because of matters related to the water veins. Though she had a rough past in the Eastern Sea and her dharma power isn't perfectly pure, she's a good child and has always been well-behaved..."

Li Ximing glanced at Miaoshui and nodded. "As long as she is not dead."

He took a pill from his sleeve and placed it in Miaoshui's abdomen. A ray of celestial light shone down from between his brows, and the life-giving force of Bright Yang bloomed. Miaoshui's complexion immediately turned rosy. She gasped, then suddenly sat bolt upright, her eyes looking around in a daze.

After a few breaths, she climbed out of the coffin, her clear eyes welling with tears. She kowtowed. "Thank you, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing gave a slight nod, a hint of surprise in his eyes. Having hovered at the edge of life and death, Miaoshui's gaze seemed clearer, her entire disposition transformed. As tears streamed down her face, Li Ximing said, "Your injuries were too severe. Your Juque Palace was damaged, so you will be unable to cultivate any related techniques or spells. Breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm is now impossible. Wait for some time. If an opportunity arises, I will help you heal your Juque."

Miaoshui wept uncontrollably. Having been hacked into three pieces, she had experienced the slow process of her own death, a torment and shock others could not comprehend. She simply kowtowed again. "Thank you, Daoist Master, for saving my life. I no longer hope for divine abilities, nor do I have any wondrous arts to cultivate. To be given a new lease on life is a fortune beyond words. All else is meaningless. I only wish to return to my mountain and see my parents, to embrace them and weep."

Li Ximing's expression was complicated. Li Zhouwei nodded and dismissed the two of them.

"Weizeng was a pillar of strength at Funan," Li Zhouwei said. "He fought many opponents at once and retreated with grace. If not for him and the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, we might have had to abandon Funan for a time. He is now severely injured."

He swept a hand across the tabletop, and three Dharma Artifacts materialized. All of them shimmered with brilliant light, their edges smooth and their inscriptions complex. They were clearly items of the highest quality among Dharma Artifacts.

Li Ximing nodded in approval. "The Capital immortals Dao has operated in the Eastern Sea for so many years and took a hefty prize from the northern bank of the river. They're truly swimming in wealth," he chuckled. "With these three Dharma Artifacts... our losses at Funan and in the wilderness are practically negligible!"

He was being conservative. The life of a single Foundation Establishment rogue cultivator from the Eastern Sea might not even be worth one of these items. The Profound Peak guest elders who died at the hands of the Capital immortals Dao were certainly not as valuable as these artifacts!

Li Zhouwei smiled. "It is precisely because these Dharma Artifacts are so powerful that they will take a long time to refine... at least a month or two for each."

"That's simple." Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. He gathered his divine power and dharma power in his mouth and blew gently. A bright light washed over the three items, and his divine ability instantly refined them. The celestial light lifted each one into the air.

The string of small, cold iron rings that Guan Kan had used was the first to react. There were eighteen silver rings in total, each no bigger than a fist and inscribed with the pattern of Pit Water. "This is the Pit-Metal Encircling Chain," Li Ximing said casually. "A high-grade Pit Water Dharma Artifact, primarily for binding and entanglement. It cannot compare to the Profound Punishment Talisman or the Profound Insight Screen, but it's on par with Minggong's Crimson Flame Brazier."
