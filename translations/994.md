# Chapter 994: Crimson Radiance

Brilliant radiance and pristine white light illuminated the path. After passing under the five-story platform of the side tower, a circular dais, one hundred and seventy feet wide, came into view. A gallery walkway, like a floating bridge, led past a grand hall of seven bays and twelve opposing towers before one finally arrived at the Crimson Radiance Hall.

The Crimson Radiance Hall was situated in the northern part of Tingzhou, second only to the main palace. It was a recent construction, built by Li Jiangzong to signify his subordinate position. Later, when the Li family was enfeoffed as rulers of Wei, Li Jianglong, also not daring to occupy the primary seat, moved here as well. Gradually, this place became the center of power for both Moongaze Lake and Tingzhou.

Though not yet as illustrious as it would one day become, the Crimson Radiance Hall was already taking shape. Li Suining, being the eldest of the children, walked closely behind Li Minggong. As they approached the pavilion, a long-robed old man stepped out to greet them, his face wreathed in smiles.

"Greetings, my lady!"

"Elder Qu, you are too kind," Li Minggong replied with a respectful smile.

The old man sighed. "To see another batch of children arrive… It feels like only yesterday that Jiangzong and the others were this small. I wonder how many more times this old man will get to see this sight…"

'Qu Bushi…'

Li Suining recognized him with a single glance and quickly lowered his head.

The old man had come from Jiangbei, having devoted his entire life to serving the Family Heads. His own strength was lacking, but he excelled at managing spirit fields and had no need for combat. When chaos later engulfed the lake, he was away and thus spared. He had wandered from place to place, gathering news, and somehow managed to find his way to the Southern Borderlands.

But his power was negligible, and he had no special skills or backing. When he reached Black Lacquer Ridge, he stumbled upon the Black Ape King on patrol. Though he invoked the Li family's name, it was useless in those days. He was captured with ease and thrown into the Black Ape King’s dharma artifact, the Pit Water Gorge, where his life ended amidst cruel laughter, dissolving into dust and blood.

The memory had been a source of deep regret for Zhouming, and for Li Suining, it was a source of helpless, gnashing hatred. Seeing the old man now, standing before the hall with his hands tucked in his sleeves and a smile on his face, Li Suining looked up and returned the smile with a respectful bow.

"Greetings, Senior Qu!"

Qu Bushi gave him a slightly surprised look, nodded repeatedly, and then raised an eyebrow.

"Go on inside, all of you…"

The children, big and small, filed in like a line of fish. Qu Bushi, however, held Li Minggong back. His expression turned serious. "Jiangzong is looking for you! The Second Young Master has come out of seclusion. Your timing is perfect!"

"Oh?" Li Minggong's eyes lit up, and she quickened her pace into the hall.

Li Suining had already reached the front of the hall. He lifted the hem of his robe and knelt, catching a glimpse of the two figures within.

One was dressed in predominantly white robes, with a collar of orange-yellow fabric. The cuffs of his sleeves were embroidered with patterns of True Fire and sparrows. His gaze was bright, and though his upper lip was still bare, he wore a stern expression.

This was the head of their affairs—Li Jiangzong, the only man of the Jiangque generation who was not a direct descendant of the Bright Yang line yet possessed outstanding ability.

This clan uncle had once been praised by the King of Wei as being "magnanimous, respectful, and diligent, sufficient to carry on the legacy." He had served as the Clan Justicar in Qingdu for many years, managing the internal affairs of the lake with meticulous order. During the Li family's decline, he had navigated complex relationships, calling in favors and coordinating with Zhouluo to ensure the survival of their bloodline.

Li Suining lowered his eyes slightly but couldn't resist turning his head to discreetly study the other man.

This man was robed in crimson, and a profound cultivation base caused a dazzling, golden-red light to shimmer around him. He sat in the main seat with a frown, a scroll in his hands, his gaze distant.

Beneath his brows was a pair of brilliant golden eyes!

'The Second Young Master…'

A fire ignited in Li Suining’s heart.

In the Li family’s golden age, they were known for having four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in a single generation, with three holding pivotal posts in the court. This Second Young Master was one of those three: Li Jianglong—Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, Emissary of the Palace of Revering Martial Arts, Prefect of Jiangjuan Prefecture, with a fief of thirty-five hundred households, the Emissary of True Radiance and Cloud!

The Li Jianglong of today was not dressed in the robes of purple light and golden patterns, nor did he wear the sash of his high office. He was merely a cultivator at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Yet, when he opened those eyes, their brilliant golden gleam was enough to strike fear into anyone's heart!

'The Song Emperor produced three worthy heirs, yet even that was not enough to rival Wei… The radiance of that time… it was too blinding…'

A wave of sorrow washed over Li Suining, and he lowered his head in dejection. Yang Zhuo, the Emperor of Song, a great figure destined to become a True Monarch, had only three accomplished sons. At the time, the court lauded this achievement, yet it was one less than the four sons of the King of Wei, each said to be a dragon among men.

'Thinking back now… the elders must have had their reasons, things that we juniors couldn't see. We were bathed in their radiance and felt proud, never knowing that disaster was just around the corner…'

He knelt on the steps, his movements practiced and familiar, appearing calm and composed compared to the other children. Li Jiangzong raised an eyebrow, and just as he expected, the golden eyes looked over.

"This is…"

Li Jiangzong glanced at the list in his hand, found the boy's position, and answered, "From the Eastern Residence… part of Lady Minggong’s line. There's also Suikuan, the direct heir, who appears to have greater talent. After so many years, their branch is finally showing signs of prosperity."

Li Jianglong understood from that single sentence that he was being tactful. Li Minggong was unmarried and childless; it wasn’t appropriate to call them her line. They were descendants of Li Xixuan.

'Unfortunately, that old man led the way back then, and the Eastern Residence was torn apart by my elder brother's schemes. Their origins are now tainted. This Li Suining is better off… Li Suikuan must be a descendant of Li Chengzai, from the main household… which makes things even more awkward.'

Li Jiangzong had deliberately omitted Li Xixuan's name to protect the two boys from the past's influence, but Li Jianglong understood perfectly. He lowered his head, took a sip of tea, and cast a glance in their direction, nodding silently to himself.

Below, Li Suining remained motionless, waiting in silence until everyone had assembled. Suddenly, a brilliant radiance flashed through the hall as a multicolored light converged, bringing a profound stillness. Everyone present was startled and bowed in unison.

"We greet the Daoist Master!"

Li Suining raised his head slightly and saw a platinum-colored figure now occupying the main seat. He dropped his head like a bolt of lightning, prostrating himself on the steps, unwilling to rise.

The Daoist Master stood before the steps, a faint smile on his face, and spoke in a leisurely tone. "Rise. There is no need for such ceremony."

The cultivators rose, the atmosphere turning solemn. A divine ability resided within the Daoist Master, and even without him speaking, an invisible pressure filled the hall. Li Ximing sat down in the main seat, his gaze sweeping over the children. He nodded.

"Excellent. These children all possess considerable talent."

Ever since the Chengming generation was cut down by the river, the Li family's succeeding generations had failed to flourish. Geniuses were few and far between. Both the Zhouxing and Jiangque generations seemed lackluster. If not for Li Zhouwei and Li Que'wan, who was brought back from the lakeside, there was only Li Jiangzong… a man of unique character, hard to judge. His talent was comparable to Li Chenghui's, but whether in experience or fortune, the current him was far inferior.

But now, looking out, he saw three to five children worthy of nurturing, and even some with truly exceptional talent that brought joy to his heart. How could Li Ximing not be delighted? His gaze swept across them but paused first on the face of a youth below, noticing his golden eyes. He pointed with a smile.

"You must be Suihuan?"

The youth had handsome eyes and brows, and his golden eyes shone with a noble air. He stepped forward and spoke respectfully, "Suihuan greets the Daoist Master!"

The youth was indeed Li Suihuan, Li Jianglong's own son. A part of the reason Li Jianglong had come out of seclusion was for his child.

His name was personally bestowed by Li Ximing. By now, he was thirteen years old, the eldest son of the Bright Yang bloodline, ranked fourth in the Sui generation. His cultivation speed was the fastest; he had already reached the Qi Refining realm, cultivating the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination.

With both Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei having reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the resources available to the family's disciples had improved dramatically. Starting their training at six, with sufficient cultivation methods and resources, Li Suihuan had completed the six cycles of Embyronic Breathing in six years, one per year. If not for the high difficulty of the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination, he would have broken through even sooner.

Standing before the other disciples now, he had an air of distinction that made the other cultivators take notice and brought a smile to Li Ximing's face.

"You have your father's bearing… With such talent and grace, not even the direct descendants of an immortal sect could compare!"

Li Suihuan was young, but not timid. Facing the stares of the assembled cultivators and the gaze of the Daoist Master, he raised his head, his eyes bright, and replied, "Which immortal sect's descendant would have dared to face my grandfather's halberd back then? As a descendant of the White Qilin, I will spread radiance for a thousand miles, elevate the Shengyang Acupoint, and bring brilliance to Moongaze. My divine ability will not be limited to two generations."

The cultivators exchanged astonished glances. A smile touched Li Minggong's lips. Li Jianglong’s eyelid twitched as he frowned slightly. Li Ximing, however, simply raised his eyebrows and laughed.

"Lofty aspirations."

"Come!"

He took a jade box from his sleeve and placed it in Li Suihuan's hands. "This is family's Li Fire dharma artifact, called the Splendor of Li-Light," he said with a smile. "I had it commissioned in my leisure time to test some divine abilities and spell arts. Now that I am finished with it, I give it to you… as an encouragement."

For a moment, the hall was filled only with the boy's thanks and the murmurs of admiration from the onlookers. Li Suining stood to the side, his head bowed. Hearing Li Ximing’s praise, he felt no envy, only a complex mix of emotions.

'Fourth Brother…'

Li Suihuan’s words were no idle boast, nor were they mere empty rhetoric. Later, even after the Eldest Young Master broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, people still spoke of his 'divine ability of two generations'. His fourth brother's own cultivation speed was incredibly fast. By the time the immortal decree reached the lake, his immortal foundation was perfected, his secret arts mastered, and he was but a single step away from the Purple Mansion Realm.

But… who could have imagined that the Li family, then at its zenith, would meet such an end?

He raised his head slightly, not daring to look directly at Li Ximing. Listening to his gratified tone, and perhaps because of his own foreknowledge, he sensed that Li Ximing's joy was not as deep as it appeared.

Li Ximing quickly turned his head, looked down, and pointed to Li Suikuan nearby. "And you are…"

"This junior is Suikuan… a disciple of the Yuanwan branch!" the boy immediately knelt and answered with utmost respect.

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully. "Impressive!"

In his past life, he had been naive, but now Li Suining understood perfectly. The reason Li Suikuan was singled out was because he appeared to be the most outstanding among the children—a fact he owed entirely to his foolish old grand-uncle, Li Chengzai.

That old man knew nothing of cultivation but was willing to put in the effort. He had called in favors to get spiritual resources from several Guest Retainers and had given them to Li Suikuan early on. For someone at Li Suikuan’s low level of Embyronic Breathing, it was like feeding a prized peony to an ox. How could a Daoist Master not see through it? On the surface, Li Suikuan's talent seemed far superior to Li Suining's, but Suining himself knew they were more or less equal.

Just as he expected, the Daoist Master's gaze swept past Suikuan and landed squarely on him.

Even though this was his second life, his awe of a Purple Mansion cultivator and his reverence for his own Daoist Master had not diminished in the slightest. Li Suining’s heart leaped into his throat. Li Ximing's gaze lingered on him for a moment before Li Minggong's gentle voice sounded from the side.

"This is Suining. His father was Jiangwu, who once cultivated the Xiaoshi Mountain Dao Lineage. He was severely injured by a Merging Fire during the turmoil in the Wilderness and passed away not long after. His grandfather, Li Zhouhuan, died of old age by the lake. He is the second son of my second elder brother, Li Chengdu."

This was the reason for Li Minggong’s kinder treatment of him. Li Ximing focused his gaze on the boy and smiled.

"Fourth level of Embyronic Breathing?"

Li Suining suppressed his excitement and answered respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, it has been half a year."

"Good…" Li Ximing glanced at Li Jiangzong. "Go to the clan stores and collect a portion of resources and two pills. You may begin Qi Refining… Do you have any learned Daoist Traditions or skills you excel at?"

Li Suining took a step back, knelt, and bowed his head to the floor.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, this junior has studied formations… I hope to learn the Dao of Formations!"

Having lived two lives, Li Suining knew exactly what the family lacked most right now! He also knew how to reveal his talent. In his past life, nearly every member of the Sui generation had read books on the Dao of Formations, and a full three of his brothers had been assigned to study it!

'Our family's Dao of Alchemy is renowned, and our artifact forging, led by Uncle Jiangzong, is quickly making a name for itself. Only the Dao of Formations is lacking! This has been a persistent worry for the elders!'

"Oh?"

But as soon as the words left his mouth, the Daoist Master's eyes opened slightly, a light glinting within them as he looked on silently.

"The Eastern Residence has long lived outside the island. It seems they've built up some savings, to be dabbling in the Dao of Formations."

There was little joy in Li Ximing's heart. He watched with a cool gaze and glanced at Li Jiangzong, causing the young man's expression to shift and his brow to furrow.

Of course Li Ximing knew they lacked Formations Masters; he had just been discussing it with Li Jiangzong recently. He had not expected to hear such an answer from Li Suining. He had been asking about skills with the saber, spear, or staff! How could a disciple from the declining, lakeside Eastern Residence, whose fourth-level Embyronic Breathing was already the result of constant effort, possibly have the energy to spare for the Hundred Arts of Cultivation? Let alone the Dao of Formations, which required expensive formation flags just to begin! Yet this boy had pinpointed the very talent the family was most desperate for and was preparing to cultivate… claiming to have 'some study' in it. How could it not be suspicious? He knew just how far those below him would go to curry favor.

Though he spoke no cold words, the mere presence of his suspicion instantly chilled the radiance in the hall. The atmosphere froze. The color drained from Li Minggong’s face, her eyes filled with worry.

The mood of a Purple Mansion cultivator with a divine ability could affect the very climate of a place. Most children, faced with such a scene, would have burst into tears and confessed everything. Li Suining, however, remained unfazed.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, when my grandfather passed away, I once came to the lake alone and met Dharma Protector Ren. My father once served under him, and they had a friendship of sorts. When he heard I possessed a spiritual aptitude, he gave me the various manuals my father left behind to take back and read. Among my father's belongings was a book, _A Comprehensive Guide to the Dao of Formations_."

"I was captivated by it and could not put it down… That was nearly ten years ago."

How could an ordinary child lie in his presence? Seeing the boy's unflinching expression, Li Ximing was already mostly convinced. His expression softened slightly, and he spoke in a neutral tone. "Oh? It must have been difficult for you, without any formation flags."

Li Ximing was right. In his previous life, Li Suining's perseverance was astonishing. He had studied the text for six or seven years, if not a full decade. But without formation flags, starting was incredibly difficult. Though the experience was beneficial for his future cultivation of the Dao of Formations, even on the day he first stood before this grand hall, his understanding was still hazy and nascent. He had never made a real breakthrough and hadn't dared to mention it, simply saying he would accept whatever arrangements were made.

But the him of today had a firm and calm gaze. He simply bowed again before rising to his feet and speaking with reverence.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, other objects can be used as substitutes."
