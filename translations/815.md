# Chapter 815: The Evil Cicada

Li Zhouming immediately flicked his sleeves, raised his head, and announced joyfully:

"So, news from Grandfather has arrived! I have been so worried about him, but it seems he has also been thinking of me. Does he have any decree?"

Only after saying this did he turn to Xia Shouyu and smile. "It's just... the Daoist Master arranged this marriage, but he never mentioned it to me. May I ask the lady's name?"

His words were polite. Xia Shouyu returned his smile but paused slightly, allowing the old man to speak first. Li Xuanxuan's expression softened a fraction as he replied:

"You do remember to worry about the Daoist Master. He is currently traveling in the Eastern Sea, and everything is going smoothly."

Only then did Xia Shouyu speak. "In response to the Young Master, this humble woman's surname is Xia, name Shouyu. I am a cultivator from the Eastern Sea."

Li Zhouming quickly unfastened his fan. "Please... Allow me to take you for a walk by the lake. It's the perfect chance to talk about the Daoist Master!"

Since it was only their first meeting, Xia Shouyu didn't sense anything amiss. She smiled and walked toward him. Li Xuanxuan felt a sense of strangeness in his heart, unsure what to say, and could only nod in acknowledgment. As the two left together, the old man didn't know whether to laugh or curse.

'This child is usually dull and mischievous, unreliable in all things. Nine out of ten sentences he speaks are nonsensical... But the moment he sees a woman, it's like he's suddenly enlightened—his eyes clear, his mind sharp, a completely different person. Every word he just said was perfectly on point... No wonder none of those girls by the lake ever caused any trouble. Hah...'

Li Jiangqian waited for him at the side, pondering deeply. After all, with two scrolls of decrees returning from Li Ximing, the main lineage descendants needed to gather and discuss. He entered the main hall with the old man and sealed the doors tightly. Li Xuanxuan sighed.

"It is best that the Daoist Master is fine. This Lady Xia was also his choice. I can see she is an extremely intelligent girl, and her family background must be good..."

Li Jiangqian guided him to the master seat. Once the old man sat down, Li Jiangqian stood to one side, poured him tea, and said in a low voice:

"She is very skilled in conversation. It was impossible to glean much in such a short time, but the subtle part is that we shouldn't be asking questions anyway, lest we expose the Daoist Master's whereabouts. However, I observed her attire... while elegant, none of it seems to be top-grade. If she truly had an extraordinary background, she should have at least one Foundation Establishment Realm dharma weapon, or perhaps spirit boots... yet I saw none."

"Perhaps my eyes are poor and I failed to recognize their value, or perhaps she simply hasn't brought out her powerful artifacts..."

Xia Shouyu was intended to be an elder (by marriage/status), so Li Jiangqian spoke extremely diplomatically. Li Xuanxuan, however, understood the implication and voiced his doubt:

"That is one point. But she repeatedly mentioned that her elders are cultivating on an immortal mountain and that her immediate family is not wealthy... That is also plausible."

Li Jiangqian nodded. Only when facing Li Xuanxuan did he dare speak so frankly. He replied:

"By my deduction, even if she has elders on an immortal mountain, Lady Xia must belong to a side branch or an impoverished main branch. The Daoist Master's trip overseas might not have been part of the original plan. Perhaps he made a compromise with a certain lineage, asking them for some assistance, which resulted in this marriage contract. Since we are the ones asking the favor, the other party naturally wouldn't send over their most talented or crucial direct descendant..."

"This is just my private speculation. Ultimately, this is probably for the best. Of all the female cultivators with outside surnames I've seen by the lake, not one can compare to Lady Xia. The Daoist Master's considerations are certainly more thorough than ours."

Li Xuanxuan nodded. He saw Li Jiangqian raise his head as if sensing something. A knock came from outside. With a wave of his sleeve, the hall doors swung open. Chen Yang was waiting outside. He hurried in and whispered in his ear:

"Patriarch... someone from the Azure Pond Sect has arrived."

Li Jiangqian frowned. "Who from the Azure Pond Sect? In what capacity are they here?"

Chen Yang whispered, "The visitor is Peak Lord Li Quantao of Fuchen Peak. He claims to be a good friend of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion Master."

Li Jiangqian had no recollection of the name, but Li Xuanxuan immediately nodded upon hearing it. "Ah, it's that young man. Quickly, invite him up!"

Although Li Quantao and the Moongaze Li clan didn't interact often, the gratitude between them ran deep. Their relationship went back to his father, Li Encheng, and Li Quantao himself had once saved Li Xizhi's life. Li Xuanxuan valued him greatly and turned to Li Jiangqian.

"We had such a good relationship back then. Now that our family has become a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan, we absolutely cannot make him wait. We must not let others think we are putting on the airs of an Immortal Clan and forgetting gratitude. It would cause a needless misunderstanding."

As they spoke, Li Quantao, dressed in blue robes patterned with waves, ascended the hall. The high-spirited youth of the past was now a middle-aged man, appearing far more reserved as he continuously cupped his hands in greeting.

Li Xuanxuan remained seated in the master chair while Li Jiangqian invited Li Quantao inside, taking a seat beside him to accompany him. The middle-aged man looked around the hall, his eyes filled with emotion. "Your clan... the changes are too vast. I hardly recognize the place."

"You and Xizhi are like brothers! You used to call him Brother Zhi. Why the formality..."

Li Xuanxuan replied with a smile, motioning for him to sit closer. "Have you encountered some difficulty? Or perhaps a junior disciple needs pills? Just say the word."

Li Quantao still couldn't relax. In the intervening years, he had married the sister of the Si family's Si Tongyi. With the Si family's support, his children did not lack for cultivation resources. Yet, his expression was somewhat desolate as he nodded.

"I was under sect orders to investigate matters in the Shanji area. Since I was passing the lake, I stopped by to visit."

He lowered his voice. "I just came from the Mushroom Forest Plains. It is chaos there. The Yuan Family Patriarch, Yuan Hudu, died suddenly when an old injury relapsed. Yuan Zibin has taken control of the family, imprisoned the elder Yuan Huyuan, and has hung several of his uncles, like Yuan Fuyao and Yuan Fuyi, from the mountain peak, whipping them for sport. He calls them his 'herd of swine,' letting them faint and reviving them repeatedly... It is too horrible to watch. He has also requisitioned over a thousand women into the mountains. The land is filled with misery."

Li Xuanxuan frowned. "Has Yuan Chengzhao made any statement?"

Mentioning Li Xizhi's junior brother, Yuan Chengzhao, Li Quantao just shook his head.

"He has not emerged from seclusion... This sort of thing isn't unique; it happens everywhere. It's only gaining attention because he imprisoned and humiliated an elder. Otherwise, it would hardly be news... It's nothing compared to the imperial descendants of Chu back in the day. My father used to say that patricide is not unknown even in immortal sects. And that Earth Virtue cultivator from Changxiao... his Dao companion is his own elder sister. It's common. In those sects and minor clans that have lost the suppression of a Divine Ability cultivator, the one who rises to power gains cultivation and authority, and their desires become uncontrollable, often leading to extreme brutality."

"In the past, the sect could manage these things. Now, we can barely manage ourselves, and such incidents are becoming more frequent."

Li Xuanxuan saw his hesitation and waved his hand, dismissing the attendants. Li Quantao was clearly agitated. Li Xuanxuan then found an excuse to send Li Jiangqian away as well. Only then did this Azure Pond Sect Peak Lord—this distant relative of the Wei-Li bloodline—let out a sigh. After a long moment, he whispered:

"There is some good news. Qin Xian, Peak Lord Qin, has been promoted to Peak Lord of Yuanxing Peak. He is preparing to select an auspicious day to marry Fellow Daoist Fei Qingyi..."

The affair between Fei Qingyi and the Si family confidant, Qin Xian, had been going on for a long time. That it was finally coming to fruition was significant news, but it clearly wasn't what Li Quantao truly wanted to say. Li Xuanxuan waited quietly. Sure enough, Li Quantao continued:

"A few days ago... just as Peak Lord Qin took his new post, I was also on duty. A blaze erupted on the main peak of the Azure Pond Sect, dyeing the heavens. I followed the disturbance and sensed an abnormal fluctuation in spiritual energy... A cultivator had fallen."

"But I was the first to arrive at that cultivator's cave-dwelling. I saw signs of excavation at the entrance gate and indentations from magic weapons striking it. The formation had been dispelled by an extremely skilled cultivator..."

Li Xuanxuan's heart trembled. He focused intently as Li Quantao, his face pale, whispered:

"I felt that something was wrong and descended the mountain quietly. But then... I saw my eldest son, Li Kan, and my second son, Li Xiangye, sneaking down the path. The cold white-iron swords they carried were broken, yet they kept them strapped to their backs..."

With the conversation having reached this point, Li Xuanxuan knew exactly what he meant. He remained silent. Frankly, Li Xuanxuan was surprised the Si family had waited this long to make a move. Li Quantao continued:

"The next morning, news spread through the sect. It was said that the former Sect Master, Chi Zhiyun, had failed his breakthrough and perished during the night. Although no one spoke out, I could see... most people wore expressions of sorrow."

At this, an exhausted look settled onto his features. He whispered:

"We all knew something would happen, but... I was still holding out hope that he would simply fail to achieve his Divine Ability on his own. My wife said they originally assumed the sudden change in spiritual atmosphere meant he was doomed to fail. No one expected him to reach the stage of Inward Heart Surging Profundity, which benefits the Fire Virtue. As the day drew closer, everyone grew anxious... leading to this."

Despite his words, his face was a mask of anxiety and fear.

In the end, Chi Zhiyun, the Sect Master of the Azure Pond Sect, had been generous, incredibly intelligent, merciful in judgment, and bold in promoting talent. He was truly a hero of his generation. Under his governance, the Azure Pond Sect was completely loyal; almost everyone had received his grace. Even after Chi Zhiyan's perverse actions had cost him all his confidants, and even with the Si family in power, everyone in the Azure Pond Sect knew Chi Zhiyun was in seclusion. They all felt guilty, and no one ever dared to bring him up.

Dantai Jin had promoted so many people, yet not one of them had been willing to act on his implied wishes. Now, he had been forced to rely on the hastily promoted confidant, Qin Xian, to plot the deed, using Li Quantao's two naive sons to carry it out. This revealed just how guilty the Si family and Dantai Jin truly felt. Even so, the Azure Pond Sect was still filled "with expressions of sorrow." The situation was awkward to the extreme.

Li Quantao grew even more distressed, his eyes welling with moisture. "He was a heroic figure. He was in seclusion, breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, pushing his Shengyang Acupoint into the Great Void. Everything was succeeding. He had broken his inner demons and was about to grasp Divine Ability... only to have his stone gate dug open from the outside. Two mere Qi Refining children broke in with swords, pierced his dantian, and severed his head. He died defeated and disgraced. If he bears a grudge, shaking heaven and earth would not be enough to appease it!"

"Senior, the elders in my family have all passed away. Brother Zhi and I are like blood brothers, and you are my elder... Speaking privately, back when my father was targeted by the Chi family, Sect Master Chi provided us much protection... I thanked him from the bottom of my heart then. Now... now, it wouldn't be wrong to call me ungrateful and perfidious!"

A dignified Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Li Quantao was covered in a cold sweat, tears streaming down his face. He bowed deeply, his voice trembling with terror:

"And those two were my own sons. They actually did such a thing... My conscience alone freezes my spine. I don't know what to do... I truly don't know what to do! Please, Senior... guide me!"

Li Quantao had grown up protected on the immortal peak, naive to the ways of the world. Although he had learned much since, he still acted according to his conscience. He was fundamentally a decent and kind man; otherwise, he never would have saved Li Xizhi all those years ago. His eyes were now filled with pure terror. The old man opened his eyes and asked softly:

"Do you know why they used your sons in this way?"

Li Quantao nodded stiffly.

"My father had a... misunderstanding... with Chi Wei. So they figured pulling me in was the most convenient option. It binds me tightly to them, making it impossible to leave. By involving Brother Zhi's connection, and then... I went into seclusion, and my two boys met someone... who instigated it... It doesn't matter who anymore."

Li Xuanxuan couldn't help but swallow a mouthful of hot tea to warm his stomach. He coughed.

"This is the karma of the past... It is all karma from long ago. The sin is not yours..."

Li Quantao's eyes widened, his lips trembling. "Senior believes in karma? I thought the Wei-Li were the last people to believe in it... If you believe that, you can forgive anything. That isn't good... If we must speak of karma, it was my father who committed the evil, who ambushed Chi Wei and stole the lineage..."

He seemed to have revealed something unintentionally. He lowered his voice, "Chi Wei was despicable, but Chi Zhiyun tried to dissuade him. He did much to remedy the situation and treated the victims kindly. I know Chi Zhiyun had to die. A clean execution, or even just explaining it clearly before killing him... but to harm him like *this*... I am deeply unsettled."

"Even revenge must have standards. If he harmed my family for personal gain, I would, at most, take revenge on him, kill him. I would not capture his great-grandson and dismember him. If I did that, wouldn't I be even more despicable than him? Shouldn't I suffer retribution for that? This is what I mean."

Li Xuanxuan listened, stunned. His heart sank. He took a medicinal pill from his sleeve, but Li Quantao waved it away.

"Senior, I am perfectly clear-headed. Lord Si is in the Southern Sea. What Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could possibly influence me through the grand formation of the Azure Pond Sect? This matter has weighed on my heart for a long time. This is not a momentary impulse."

His eyes dimmed slightly. "I understand that your esteemed clan also suffered greatly at the hands of the Chi family. The hatred runs deep in your hearts; you cannot understand me... But Senior is also correct. If there is karma, in the end, it will fall upon me!"

Li Quantao bowed deeply one last time and retreated from the hall. His hurried silhouette looked utterly defeated. Li Xuanxuan forgot to see him out. He picked up his tea and drank several consecutive mouthfuls before he felt the warmth return to his limbs.

After a long while, Li Jiangqian returned to his side, looking slightly surprised. "Why did he leave without even turning his head... Senior...?"

Li Xuanxuan rubbed his brow and said softly, "Chi Zhiyun... has fallen."

Li Jiangqian wasn't surprised. He nodded. "It was only a matter of time. That they dragged it out this long only shows the Si family was being careless."

He immediately grew suspicious. "Was he the one who told you? Was he involved? The Si family wanting to pull him in... they must be up to no good. They aren't trying to drag our family into this, are they..."

The old man seemed unsettled. He nodded silently, rising and walking down the steps. He glanced at Li Jiangqian and coughed.

"I was actually coming to find you... Sometimes I look at Que'wan's temperament and find it good; other times, I feel you are more reliable. You two siblings should complement each other more... Why don't you learn from your sister? Not everything needs to be taken to the absolute extreme, assuming the worst! There are benefits to interacting with sincerity... You trust people too little. You prefer to embellish everything with rhetoric. While it often wins you advantages, I fear it makes those around you—your friends—grow cold-hearted."

Li Jiangqian hadn't expected Li Xuanxuan to bring this up. He smiled naturally and replied:

"Toward my sister, and toward you, Senior, I have never been anything but completely sincere. My heart is clear on this. Any rhetorical embellishments are only seen by my elders, and they are always used to gain benefits for the clan... My conscience is clear."

The old man only walked down the steps, returning his smile. He nodded. "I'm old. These are the words of a dotard. The clan's affairs still require your full attention... This burdens you."

He descended the stairs but, surprisingly, did not return to Qingdu. Instead, he walked toward the bustling center of the island. Li Jiangqian accompanied him halfway before turning back to the hall. His expression serene, he sat down in the master seat, tapping the table lightly, his eyes turning cold as ice.

'I've never seen Senior act like this. Who had the audacity... who has been whispering slander about me in the old man's ear!'
