# Chapter 888: Golden Halberd

Azure and yellow patterns, like mountains and rivers, rippled into view, instantly sweeping aside the billowing clouds of dust and grit. The old nun could no longer maintain her disguise. She erupted in brilliant light, revealing her true form.

"The Buddhist Land lies to the east. You are bold indeed, Daoist friend!"

It was a female visage, overflowing with dazzling light. Behind her, a hundred slender arms fanned out like an ornate screen. Her primary, normal-sized hands were pressed together before her chest. Her eyes glittered with golden light, her expression solemn as she sat upon a pink lotus pedestal, hovering in mid-air.

The moment she appeared, the Heavenly Light between Li Ximing's brows flickered as it discerned her true nature. His heart settled instantly.

'This thing is barely stronger than those newly-advanced Merciful Ones who served Chiluo. At least she has something to sit on, though it looks like an inferior Treasured Artifact. I wasn't afraid of their kind back then, so why would I be today?'

'Still, its appearance is formidable. All those hands clearly set her apart from Chiluo's subordinates. She's likely one they've invested heavily in... otherwise, she wouldn't have landed this plush assignment as a guide.'

His Heavenly Light completed its probe. In the air, Reveal River spun, flashed, and suddenly erupted with light.

The power of Reveal River was directly related to proximity. The closer an opponent was to Li Ximing's body, the stronger its wondrous entangling and pulling force became. To fight him for Bai Yinzi, the old nun had been right in his face. And though she had retreated a couple of steps, she was still only a few yards away!

The old nun felt as if she had plunged into a swamp. The azure and yellow light layered beneath her feet, forming illusory mountains and rivers that clung and pulled, weighing down her dharma body. The light she had summoned to retreat was dragged apart and dissipated. For a crucial moment, she was held fast. Hatred flared instinctively.

'Damn this demonic cultivator... capturing people daily to refine artifacts, yet he possesses such an incredible treasure! From the looks of it... it must be modeled after the *Imperial Observation of the Origin* mentioned in the scriptures.'

How could Li Ximing waste such a perfect opportunity? At this range, whether he used True Fire or a Dharma Art, she had no chance to escape into the Great Void. His fingers were already pressed to his lips.

Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire!

The True Fire was blazing red on the outside, its core a brilliant white-gold. It bloomed in the air, erupting into a wave of pure golden flame, streaked with purple, that washed over the old nun.

The old nun instantly formed a hand seal, her first instinct to defend and retreat. But guarding against the True Fire cost her a fraction of a second—just enough time for a brilliant light to shoot toward her.

'Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!'

The old nun knew of Li Ximing's Divine Ability and had heard he'd refined a spirit embryo; that was why she had been so wary. She hadn't anticipated the sheer range of Reveal River, but she was not without her own resources. The hundred slender arms behind her glowed as one, casting a brilliant golden-yellow light.

This golden-yellow spell art had clearly been prepared in advance, stored within her many arms. It manifested with incredible density, momentarily holding back the flames. Simultaneously, the lotus pedestal beneath her feet emanated a pink glow, rising to block the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light.

But no matter how dense the golden light, a Purple Mansion Realm True Fire was not so easily denied. It burned with a sharp sizzle, rapidly thinning the defense. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light focused on a single point, causing the pedestal's pink shield to flicker between light and shadow.

'That damned spirit embryo...'

She had never expected such a relentless barrage of attacks. Worse, she had been caught by Reveal River from the start. One misstep had led to a cascade of failures. Unsure if the artifact was just stronger up close, she was consumed by the urge to flee and spat a mouthful of brilliant light.

But it all happened in the space of a single breath. While she was pinned by the True Fire and the Hidden Light, the Daoist Master in the white-gold robe appeared before her. He extended a palm, deceptively simple and unadorned.

"Not good!"

How could she dare take that strike? The most unassuming attacks were often the deadliest. Forgetting that the light in her mouth was still gathering, she sprayed it forth to block, simultaneously trying to twist away.

"Boom!"

The brilliant light was instantly overwhelmed by the dense flames. Li Ximing felt a brief sear on his palm as it grazed past her dharma body, striking the pedestal's pink shield and shattering it into nothing.

The old nun's face burned with heat. Though she had dodged the palm, the azure-yellow patterns of Reveal River surged again like an ocean tide, their power even greater than before. She tried to retreat, but the dragging force held her, allowing her to move only a few yards.

The old nun finally understood why the spirit embryo's power kept increasing.

'It's stronger the closer it is!'

She had always cultivated in the north, where Merciful Ones were plentiful and Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters were rare. The few times she had encountered one, there had been no need for conflict. Now, in her first true battle with one, she finally understood why Merciful Ones were always considered a step below.

'He hasn't even used *that* Divine Ability... We already have one less Divine Ability than they do, and our Treasured Artifacts are leagues behind their spirit embryos and Spiritual Artifacts. How can we possibly win a duel? It's always said that only by sitting on the Golden Lotus Seat and receiving the full blessing of the Buddhist Land can we make a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator hesitate. Without a truly precious Treasured Artifact, what else can we do!'

Li Ximing felt no regret. The palm had been difficult to land; its true purpose was to stop her from escaping into the Great Void. In that, it had succeeded, and her retreat had rendered the lotus pedestal useless.

The white light between Li Ximing's brows still shone brightly. Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was still active!

"Boom!"

The Heavenly Light finally struck her chest. Billowing, bright-white smoke erupted with a shower of sparks, and the creature spat a mouthful of golden blood.

While Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light wasn't his most powerful attack, its righteous nature was perfectly aspected against her, amplifying its effect. If not for the inherent resilience of a Merciful One's dharma body, that single blow would have been devastating.

By now, her golden defensive light had been burned away. The massive cloud of True Fire churned above, ready to descend. If that fire touched her, the pain would be unbearable, to say nothing of protecting Bai Yinzi. Losing her composure, she shrieked:

"Nuyan!"

As her cry faded, a hearty laugh echoed from the heavens. Another golden body emerged from the Great Void, this one as large as a palace. It had four arms, each grasping a glittering golden artifact. A brilliant light flashed between its brows, reinforcing the failing Dharma Art that held back the True Fire. Its voice boomed like thunder:

"Nuxiao, still trying to claim all the glory for yourself? You're about to be beaten to death!"

Li Ximing glanced toward the Great Void—the other Purple Mansion Realm expert was still observing. A faint golden light began to glow in his eyes as he fixed his gaze on the newcomer.

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

Instantly, iridescent clouds churned as Heavenly Light pierced the sky. The Celestial Gate materialized, its illusory golden-armored figures and flowing robes more brilliant than ever. Banners snapped and fluttered in the clouds as two massive, bright-white pillars descended from above.

Nuyan was clearly far stronger than Nuxiao. Although the increased power of Audience with the Celestial Gate made his eye twitch, he merely raised a hand, unleashing a beam of pink light and shouting:

"Come!"

A small kasaya robe flew through the air with astonishing speed, descending on a beam of light from the Buddhist Land. It enveloped Bai Yinzi, whisking the child from Merciful One Nuxiao's grasp. Nuyan's body erupted in golden light; he had clearly been prepared to channel the Buddhist Land's power all along, waiting for the perfect moment to intervene.

But the Celestial Gate didn't target Nuyan. The surging Heavenly Light smashed down toward Nuxiao instead, attempting to sever her connection to the Buddhist Land. Li Ximing himself shot directly at Nuxiao, completely ignoring Bai Yinzi.

'Hmph!'

Seeing that his opponent truly didn't care about Bai Yinzi and was instead focused on killing one of them—relentlessly pursuing Nuxiao before she could be reinforced—Merciful One Nuyan felt forced onto the back foot. He had no choice but to raise his hands to intercept the descending Radiant Pass.

'If Nuxiao is crushed, her dharma body will be destroyed. The master will think I let her die on purpose to steal Bai Yinzi!'

He sighed inwardly:

'He really abandoned Wang Xiaoxiao, abandoned his entire family, and ran all the way to the west... just for this one Dharma sword. It seems he sensed something. A pity, a real pity. This just got much more complicated.'

'He's already gotten what he came for. Bai Yinzi is useless to him. He just wants to kill us, and getting rid of Nuxiao is his top priority.'

The Great Desire and Way of Emptiness paths had been watching Daoist Master Zhaojing for a long time. In past years, he either stayed out of major conflicts or hid overseas, making it difficult for the two covetous paths to act. But now, he had flagrantly sided with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. A Wei-Li cultivator practicing Bright Yang... how could they not be tempted?

The Buddhist cultivators were not unaware of the Li Clan's search for Bai Yinzi. However, they also had agents in the Wang Clan and knew Wang Quwan was a Li operative, so they dismissed it as a feint. The Wang Clan, after all, had two individuals blessed by fate and possessed multiple Ancient Dharma Artifacts—the two sides were incomparable. Their forces elsewhere had even brought an Enlightened Artifact, lying in wait for Zhaojing. With the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition lurking, killing him was unlikely, but heavily wounding him would be an excellent outcome.

But Zhaojing had come here instead. While not entirely unexpected, it was certainly a disappointment.

'This place is too close to the Buddhist Land. He won't dare overextend himself. We just need to let him retreat.'

With Bai Yinzi secured, Nuyan wasn't afraid. Thankfully, he had arrived in time. He managed to hold back the Audience with the Celestial Gate, and under the suppressing light of the Buddhist Land, the gate's power was diminished by sixty or seventy percent as it began to close. Still, the force made his body sink, and he grimaced.

'Audience with the Celestial Gate plus a Purple Mansion Realm True Fire... It's truly unfair!'

Fortunately, his own abilities were extraordinary. All four arms pressed together, forming a spherical golden shield. An imposing, brilliant light, mingled with golden flames, surged upward, trying to topple the Divine Ability.

"Crash!"

As expected, the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire followed, surging into the base of the Divine Ability and pinning him completely. Even though Merciful One Nuyan was himself a master of fire, the heat seared his entire body.

Seeing this, Merciful One Nuxiao actually breathed a sigh of relief.

'With his most dangerous weapons, the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire and Audience with the Celestial Gate, both occupied... he's a tiger without its fangs!'

The light of Reveal River still flickered. Li Ximing sat ethereally in the air, formed a simple hand seal, and waves of Radiant Fire infused with Supreme Yang light descended. Merciful One Nuxiao glanced at the attack; its power was clearly inferior. But having learned her lesson, she dared not be careless. She used the momentary lull to try and escape Reveal River's range.

But Li Ximing wouldn't let her go. He instantly pursued her on a beam of light. Her lotus pedestal was for self-augmentation, not flight, and with Reveal River constantly dragging at her, escape was impossible.

Fury and hatred began to build in Merciful One Nuxiao. The thousand slender hands behind her lit up, and she spat in a low voice:

"What more do you want!"

Before her voice faded, Li Ximing's figure vanished.

Merciful One Nuxiao went on high alert. Ignoring the waves of Radiant Fire and Heavenly Light, she prepared the brilliant light in her mouth and charged her escape technique. As expected, the Great Void flickered, and from within the searing Radiant Fire, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light shot out again.

She remained vigilant, certain he was trying the same trick. She extended two fingers, casting a Dharma Art to temporarily block the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, while the golden light protecting her back held firm, guarding against Li Ximing's reappearance.

But the Heavenly Light before her rapidly dispersed. Amidst the scattered Radiant Fire, there was no one.

Her confusion lasted only an instant. She snapped her head to the east—where Nuyan, trapped beneath the Divine Ability and engulfed in True Fire, suddenly looked horrified.

"Not good!"

Almost simultaneous with his thought, the searing True Fire parted, and the Daoist Master in white-gold robes appeared before him.

His expression was glacial. The azure-yellow ruler by his side—Reveal River—unleashed its mountain patterns, covering the area. The power of the Divine Ability already crushing Nuyan intensified, becoming utterly unbearable.

But what truly captured Merciful One Nuyan's attention was his hand.

He was holding a three-foot-long golden halberd. The corners of its blade curved like crescent moons, and embossed beast-patterns rippled across the heavy, bronze-gold surface, reflecting a terrifying spiritual light.

A dense Bright Yang aura clung heavily to the golden halberd, so weighty it seemed to make Li Ximing stagger. Utter horror crept onto Merciful One Nuyan's face as a single term echoed in his mind:

"Spiritual Artifact!"

The Radiant Sun King's Halberd in Li Ximing's hand felt as heavy as the world. Audience with the Celestial Gate locked Nuyan in place, and the True Fire seared him. Merciful One Nuyan still had trump cards, but his heart plunged into an icy abyss, a cold that pierced his very bones.

'A Spiritual Artifact? Where did he get a Spiritual Artifact?'

He hadn't feared being trapped, because he believed his opponent lacked a decisive weapon that could truly harm him. Now, everything was reversed. Seared by the True Fire, he could only part his golden-red lips and forcefully spit out a round pearl.

The pearl was smooth, bright, and translucent, its surface awash with flowing runes. It was clearly a life-saving Treasured Artifact, one he had refined for many years.

A golden light simultaneously flared between his brows and poured into the pearl. His eyes widened, staring in horror as the short distance seemed to stretch into an eternity. The Spiritual Artifact finally struck.

"Peng!"

The pearl Treasured Artifact took the brunt of the impact.

The Treasured Artifact collided with the fully-charged Spiritual Artifact. A blinding light erupted at the point of impact, exploding in a shower of sparks. The Divine Ability and dharma power Merciful One Nuyan had frantically poured into the pearl evaporated instantly. As if struck by a colossal club, the Treasured Artifact was blasted away at imperceptible speed.

The Radiant Sun King's Halberd still glinted coldly. While the impact had momentarily dimmed its light, the defeated Treasured Artifact released a flash of radiance as it was sent flying, which the halberd seemed to absorb. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd flared with light, its power seemingly restored.

A vast, overwhelming golden light filled Merciful One Nuyan's pupils.

"Clang!"

An impossibly dense wave of brilliant light, entangled with Bright Yang, shot skyward. It surged up the white pillars of the Celestial Gate, climbing past layer upon layer of runes like a golden torrent rushing into the heavens.

The Divine Ability Audience with the Celestial Gate, hovering above, began to shake violently. It dissolved into a golden cloud that stretched to the horizon, and from it, sand and stone began to rain down.

"Crash..."

Sand and stone cascaded down Merciful One Nuxiao's golden form. Her face was bathed in the golden radiance, and the guiding Buddhist light from the sky above flickered precariously. A deep, profound dread filled her heart.

"A purely offensive Spiritual Artifact! One that resonates with Bright Yang!"

"There is no way he found that on his own... We've been set up by the Immortal Dao!"
