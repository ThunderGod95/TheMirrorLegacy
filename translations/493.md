# Chapter 735: Changtian Peak

Li Xizhi first arrived at the General Affairs Hall and returned the jade token. The cultivator in charge nodded politely and said respectfully, “Greetings, Daoist... your cultivation truly progresses with remarkable speed.”

Li Xizhi nodded slightly, and the man continued, “However, the merit you’ve earned will have to be withheld for now...”

Before Li Xizhi could ask, he quickly added, “The sect sent someone to investigate. They found that you hadn’t been on your peak for nearly half a year, and that you’d gone to Xia Mountain to gather glow for personal affairs, this was reported to the main peak.

“It was Daoist Chi Liangzhe of Hongda Peak who reported it... and the matter reached the sect master himself, who’s considering punishment.”

Li Xizhi had already expected someone would seize this issue to make trouble, so he wasn’t surprised. He asked, “Very well. Am I to be sent to Yuanxing Peak?”

The man shook his head repeatedly and said in a low voice, “This matter didn’t spread because the sect master suppressed it. He left a message here, asking you to visit the main hall upon your return.”

Li Xizhi nodded, said nothing more and rode his Heavenly Glow toward the Azure Pond Sect’s main hall. Mist swirled atop the jade tiles. A figure stood within. Li Xizhi waited a moment before the dragon-carved and phoenix-painted doors until he was finally allowed in.

He walked slowly into the hall, straightened his sleeves, and bowed loudly, “Xizhi greets the Sect Master!”

The man above had already risen and came down quickly, using both hands to help him up, speaking gently, “No need for such formality.”

Li Xizhi rose accordingly and met his gaze. He saw a face with upright features and a neatly trimmed beard, eyes full of warmth. He lowered his gaze and said, “I stand as one awaiting punishment! I dare not speak freely!”

Chi Zhiyun, however, took the chance to observe those handsome, slightly narrowed eyes, elegantly arched brows and composed bearing. Then he thought to himself, Just as the rumors say. He is not someone to provoke lightly.

Chi Zhiyun simply smiled and said, “I’ve long heard of your reputation, Xizhi, and have been looking forward to meeting you! But you’ve often been away on tasks, and we’ve kept missing each other, only now do I finally get to see you.”

Li Xizhi cupped his hands in salute, but Chi Zhiyun waved it off, cutting him short and pausing before saying, “That task at Xia Mountain was assigned by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it was no personal errand... but some petty men are using it to slander you...”

He lifted his head and said with a laugh, “If it had been them, they’d have offered up their lives and fortunes at a single order from the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. What face do they have to judge you? Of course I would never believe them!”

Li Xizhi made a show of gratitude, nodding with a slight bow. Chi Zhiyun came forward eagerly, gripped his arm, and said in a low voice, “I know you’ve heard all kinds of rumors, saying the Chi Family meant to harm you... Sigh, this really is my fault.

“Some in my family still hold grudges from the past, thinking Chejing shamed me. What kind of logic is that? They lack perspective. When I went into seclusion, they deliberately sent you away... and snatched Qingsui Peak.”

Chi Zhiyun looked deeply embarrassed, painting a picture of remorse on his face, though his eyes remained alert, quietly studying Li Xizhi’s expression as he said with a sigh, “As fate would have it, you never ended up going to the Qunyi... and it was the Han Family brothers who paid the price instead!”

Li Xizhi asked in confusion, “Qunyi? What happened there? I only heard the Han Family was present... Ah, they were searching for news of my master on Azure Pond Sect’s behalf.”

Chi Zhiyun sighed and said, “The Han Family’s master and servant both died! While investigating, they ran straight into the Dragon Clan’s hands! You weren’t there at the time... If you had been, you could’ve used your Azure Pond Sect’s credentials to get them out safely... What a pity!

“Those fools, in trying to push you aside and seize Qingsui Peak, ended up getting the Han Family killed instead!”

Li Xizhi appeared visibly shocked but inwardly applauded him, What a clever redirection! What a graceful misdirection about ‘saving them had I been there’... If I hadn’t actually gone myself, I really might’ve been fooled!

Outwardly, Li Xizhi only showed sorrow, saying softly, “It seems I’ve caused their deaths...”

Chi Zhiyun patted his shoulder and said gently, “This was my oversight in the end. I asked you here today to make it right, to restore fairness and return the peak master position to you!”

“I dare not!” said Li Xizhi. How could Li Xizhi accept that now? His heart turned cold. If he reclaimed the position so directly, that would no longer be a mere falling-out with the Yuan Family, it would be a full-blown feud!

From then on, the Yuan Family wouldn’t just distance themselves from the Li Family, they would truly hate them and the Li Family would find itself beset on all sides. So he let guilt fill his face, choking with emotion as he said, “I’ve thought it through... Putting aside grudges and resentment, my master always valued the family above all. The Yuan Family is in a difficult spot, if she could choose, she’d choose our junior brother too... I’ve toiled in the Eastern Sea all this time and still haven’t found my master, not even a whisper... I’ve no face left to be a peak master!”

Chi Zhiyun shook his head repeatedly and said in a sorrowful tone, “Xizhi... the world is full of helpless things. We must learn to let go... Back then... there was more to Chejing’s case than you know... I too was powerless!”

Li Xizhi showed just the right trace of curiosity on his face, and Chi Zhiyun immediately changed the topic, speaking solemnly, “Since you won’t take back Qingsui Peak, there are still empty seats among the Thirty-Six Peaks. Zhang Lingshu of Changtian Peak just died in the Eastern Sea, and his Dao lineage was severed. So I’m assigning that peak to you!”

Just as Chi Zhiyun finished speaking, Li Xizhi didn’t immediately give thanks. Instead, he feigned a look of being deeply moved and asked, “May I ask which Dao lineage it belongs to...”

“Oh, it came from a rogue cultivator. Zhang Lingshu was an only daughter,” replied Chi Zhiyun.

Li Xizhi nodded repeatedly, appearing touched as he said, “Thank you, Sect Master! I am truly grateful...”

Chi Zhiyun was smiling as he stroked his beard when someone below interrupted. An elegantly dressed man stepped forward and respectfully said, “Sect Master! To the east...”

Only then did he notice Li Xizhi in the room. Startled, he fell silent at once. Li Xizhi immediately recognized him as Ning Heyuan of the Ning family, now showing great deference toward Chi Zhiyun.

Chi Zhiyun said warmly, “Xizhi, you may go for now... My younger brother is already waiting below, just follow him.”

Li Xizhi bowed respectfully and withdrew. Ning Heyuan kept his gaze lowered in silence. Chi Zhiyun, smiling inwardly, waved his hand and listened as Ning Heyuan began his report, “Sect Master... there’s trouble at Crimson Reef Island and Great Xiukui Temple... Lin Chensheng killed Guo Hong’er on an Eastern Sea island. Red rain filled the sky and it caused quite a stir. It seems a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator intervened.”

Chi Zhiyun seemed to already know. He calmly turned the jade talisman in his hand and said softly, “The east and west sides of Crimson Reef have long been at odds. Guo Shentong hasn’t appeared for ages... this was bound to happen eventually.”

Ning Heyuan finished reporting a few other minor matters and gradually withdrew, leaving Chi Zhiyun seated alone. He quietly gazed in the direction Li Xizhi had gone, the smile on his face slowly fading.

A thought stirred in his heart, None of them are easy to handle... I thought Tang Shedu was already troublesome enough. But this Li Xizhi... he’s even harder to control than Tang Shedu. The Kong Family indeed needs Heavenly Glow. And Changxi did request it from Daoist Master Suiguan... Li Xizhi alone doesn’t have that much clout...

Chi Zhiyun pondered for a moment, then set the jade talisman aside, If Tang Shecheng and Yu Yuxie were still alive, with Xiao Yuansi and Yu Xiuxian also here... I wouldn’t have to rely on anyone in particular right now...

Among the many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, he actually preferred Yuan Su’s way of doing things and disliked people like Chi Wei, who fished the pond dry. But then he reconsidered and thought, Once I reach Purple Mansion Realm myself... perhaps I’ll think differently.

Back on Li Xizhi’s end, he descended through the wind. A young man was waiting on the mountain. He resembled Chi Zhiyun quite a bit, but had a gloomier air. Yet now his face bore a sincere smile as he said, “Zhiyan greets the Peak Master!”

Li Xizhi had heard of this man’s reputation and dared not take him lightly, so he waved his hands repeatedly in courtesy. Chi Zhiyan, however, was warm and talkative, rambling on at length.

Li Xizhi nodded politely and saw him off with a cupped-hand salute as they arrived together at Changtian Peak.

Changtian Peak wasn’t very tall, it was rugged and steep in places. Since it had been uninhabited for years, wild grass covered the slopes. Li Xizhi descended with the wind and saw that only a single, quaint little dwelling stood atop the summit.

Li Xizhi had intended to inquire about Zhang Lingshu, but didn’t trust Chi Zhiyan. So he exchanged a few polite words, then courteously escorted him off the peak.

Chi Zhiyan cupped his hands in farewell and still made bold assurances. He said, “Brother Xizhi! My elder brother’s always busy and can’t manage all his underlings... But if you face any trouble at all, just come to me, Chi Zhiyan! I’ll handle it myself! I won’t let Changtian Peak suffer the slightest indignity!”

Li Xizhi nodded and smiled, though he didn’t believe a word. He returned to the peak on the wind and began tidying up carefully.

Most of the formations within the pavilion were still functional. It looked elegant and refined. As he continued tidying the mountain, sure enough, a visitor arrived after just fifteen minutes.

The visitor was tall and, upon stepping into the mountain, he greeted with enthusiasm, “Xizhi! You’ve finally got yourself a fine mountain!”

“You’re quite well-informed, brother-in-law,” replied Li Xizhi, smiling faintly and showing a hint of genuine warmth. The man before him was Yang Ruizao, the older brother of his wife, Yang Xiao’er. He was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator with whom he had crossed paths a few times before.

Yang Ruizao looked around briefly, exchanged a few words, and before Li Xizhi could even ask, he smiled and said, “I’ve heard some things too. I don’t have much detail yet, but I’ve already sent someone to compile information on this peak. You’ll have it delivered tonight.”

Moongaze Lake.

The northern shore’s mountains were covered in pristine snow. Li Xijun had been silently observing the lake for several days and had already seen signs of more than a dozen skirmishes.

“The Fei Family is really in trouble,” muttered Li Xijun.

The north bank of Moongaze Lake bordered Xu State, and the Fei Family was the first to bear the brunt. The Buddhist and devil cultivators fleeing Xu State were split into two groups by Mount Xiping, heading separately toward Wu and Yue States.

Fortunately, the Fei Family’s formation was a legacy from ancient times, capable of withstanding Foundation Establishment REalm attacks. And with the cultivators in a rush to cover their tracks, unwilling to linger, nothing too disastrous had happened yet.

Even so, several members of the Fei Family who ventured out had been killed by devil or Buddhist cultivators. They had now learned their lesson and withdrawn entirely into the mountain, refusing to budge.

Li Xijun waited patiently. After a time, he saw two streaks of light flying past the lake’s central island. The one ahead emitted panicked dharma light and the one behind was dim and shadowy, its origins unclear.

Li Xijun looked at their trajectory and he was pretty sure that they were coming from Xu State. He thought, Just as the Yue Cultivating Sect pulled its forces back, Xu State’s cultivators are already fleeing into Yue State... they’re flying around blind. It’s clear how chaotic Xu State has become...

He had encountered five or six such cases over the past few days, but hadn't found the right opportunity to catch someone for questioning.

First, avoid Buddhist cultivators, they’re clever, love playing games, and have tangled history with my family. As for devil or orthodox cultivators, I must choose someone with low cultivation and no strong backing.

He had waited for days. Finally, these two came along. Their light-escape techniques were crude at best, likely devil cultivators or immortal cultivators. He rode the breeze and snow, instantly cutting off the one in front.

Li Xijun reached out and grabbed the man. The man’s light was instantly shattered. He had no time to react just like a lamb to the slaughter, he was caught. His cultivation was sealed and cast into the swirling snow.

The man turned out to be an old fellow in a tattered Daoist robe that was holding a fly whisk. His face was full of terror, but with his cultivation and speech both sealed, he could say nothing.

Though unable to speak, he curled up in the wind, pressing his palms together and pleading for mercy with frantic gestures.

The one behind reacted far faster. At the first sign of snow and wind, he turned tail and fled, erupting into a red mist. Clearly, he had used a blood-burning spell that consumed life force for speed.

Li Xijun nodded slightly, formed a seal with two fingers, and pointed gently at the fleeing figure.

A stream of white light, the Slaughter Jun Kui Light, gushed out like a flowing ribbon. It was as thin as silk and as swift as lightning. It flashed through the air, brushed across the fleeing light, and with a cry of pain, all of the man’s spells were wiped clean. He plummeted into the lake below.

The fleeing man turned out to be a young cultivator. His face was pale from the secret technique he had used. Clad in black, his blood qi surged, whether from his cultivation method or the spell itself was unclear.

Li Xijun reached out, sealed the young man’s cultivation and pulled him up without pause. Two Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators were nothing more than meat on the chopping block before him, they were entirely defenseless. Without saying a word, he took to the wind and flew south.

After around five minutes, Li Zhouwei appeared, clad in armor and standing with a halberd in hand. Behind him was Chen Yang, who had just broken through Qi Cultivation Realm and was now riding the wind as well.

As the years passed, the oddities in Li Zhouwei’s appearance had faded. Now, standing aloft on the wind, he looked no different from an ordinary cultivator except for a strange power in his gaze that made it difficult to look away. Everything else about him was well-concealed.

His features had matured, his shoulders had broadened and he now bore a resemblance to his father. The strange aura from his birth had mostly dissipated, though Chen Yang still stood at attention with proper form and discipline.

Li Zhouwei was now at the third stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He wasn’t rushing to advance further, as doing so might draw unwanted attention. Instead, he devoted most of his time to mastering halberd techniques.

After a short wait, Li Xijun arrived on the wind with a breeze of snow trailing behind. The young Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in charge of Qingdu wore a troubled look, and two cultivators lay curled up on a spirit wind beside him.

Li Zhouwei had now officially joined Qingdu’s ranks. With Li Ximing in long-term seclusion, Li Qinghong away across the outer seas, and both Li Xizhi and Li Xuanfeng stationed at Azure Pond Sect, only Li Xijun and Li Zhouwei remained on Mount Qingdu to manage family matters.

Li Zhouwei glanced briefly at the captives and understood at once. He said in a low voice, “Uncle, there was another disturbance just now. This is already the seventh Buddhist cultivator to fly across the border this month...”

The northern skies were dim and heavy. Li Xijun had just returned from visiting the Fei Family. Over the past few days, he had seen things clearly, and upon hearing this, replied, “That’s right. I came back from the northern shore. The Fei Family has already lost three Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators. I caught these two along the way. We’ll question them thoroughly about what’s happening up north.”
