# Chapter 107: Returning to the Market

Li Tongya had finished attending the funeral and had changed out of his white robe when he realized that it was about time for the market at Moongaze Lake to open. He packed up the leather of demonic creatures and materials he had gathered in recent days and headed north.

Patrolling the reeds a few times, he had hoped to seize the moment and gather a wisp of River Pure Qi in the river. To his dismay, he was greeted by a dry, withered landscape, forcing him to leave... empty-handed and disheartened.

“After months of drought, the rivers have dried up, and the once vibrant reeds have turned yellow. There’s no chance of finding any River Pure Qi in the river,” he muttered to himself in disappointment.

Leaving the reeds behind, Li Tongya rode the wind toward Moongaze Lake. The waterline had receded about thirty miles, revealing fish carcasses covered in maggots and many small islands that had revealed themselves now that the water had gone.

With a wave of his sleeve, Li Tongya activated the hidden formation in the air which emitted a bright burst of silver light.

This time it was different. With just a sweep of his spiritual sense, he had managed to locate the large boat on the lake. He quickly descended and headed in its direction.

A young man with cultivation at the third stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm rushed out from the cabin of the boat almost instantly.

“My lord, are you heading to Moongaze Lake’s market?” he asked inquisitively.

“Yes,” Li Tongya replied as he found a seat for himself. Seeing only the young man who promptly served him a bowl of tea and no signs of the white-haired old man who used to pilot the boat years ago, Li Tongya asked, “I remember the old man who used to drive this boat more than ten years ago. Has there been a change of ownership?”

The young man seemed surprised by the question. He set down the tea bowl before replying.

“That old man failed to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm and died of old age ten years ago... none of his children possessed any spiritual orifice, so his eldest son exchanged all his spirit items for fields. They’re now a wealthy family in their hometown.”

Li Tongya sighed inwardly. He picked up the tea bowl but refrained from drinking, setting it down cautiously.

“What a shame,” he murmured.

“Indeed.” The young man lowered his gaze before quickly adding, “But the old man did live to be a hundred and eight years old—his longevity was the envy of all of us here on the boat!”

“Oh?”

The young man observed Li Tongya quietly, who appeared to be only in his thirties but had already reached the Qi Cultivation Realm. He noticed the storage pouch and qi bottles tied to his waist, and the youth came to the conclusion that he was likely a descendant of a large family.

With a bitter smile, he said, “Senior... you may not be aware of this, but rogue cultivators like us mostly rely on a Grade One breathing technique of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. We can barely even condense a chakra in over ten years, hence it’s not uncommon for us to be stuck in the Embryonic Breathing Realm for a lifetime.”

“I see.”

The youth had worked on the lake for over a decade, encountering many Qi Cultivators who rarely bothered to engage in conversation. Li Tongya, however, with his focused demeanor and frequent nods, encouraged the youth to speak.

Taking this as his cue, the youth continued.

“Your talent is exceptional, Senior. Attaining the Qi Cultivation Realm at such a young age is remarkable! Rogue cultivators like us often live our entire lifetime with just a single technique of the Embryonic Breathing Realm in possession, unable to access techniques needed to draw talismans or refine pills... it’s a bitter reality.”

Upon hearing these words, Li Tongya’s mind immediately drifted to the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra at home.

I guess that cultivation method is worth more than the wealth of all the families in the entire Moongaze Lake combined! The cultivation speed seems to be at least ten times faster than ordinary techniques, not to mention the purity of the refined mana that far surpassed others.

Feigning ignorance, Li Tongya merely smiled.

“I wonder what grade of Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques the disciples from the sect are practicing...” he responded, leading the youth on.

The youth nodded enthusiastically in response as soon as the words left Li Tongya’s mouth. “I’ve been working on this lake for over a decade now and I’ve seen disciples of major sects who were as young as twenty and even the elderly at the first stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm in their nineties! Yet, all I’ve heard is that the Azure Pond Sect’s Embryonic Breathing Realm technique is the best among all the sects... it’s a Grade Five technique, four times more effective than ordinary ones!”

“That’s truly remarkable!” Li Tongya exclaimed in amazement, then steered the conversation toward Mount Yue.

“I’ve heard that Mount Yue in the west is quite formidable!”

The youth nodded vigorously. “Indeed! I heard that the Great King from Mount Yue has reached the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm! They’ve been targeting families under the governance of the Golden Tang Gate Sect on the west coast; three family heads of the Qi Cultivation Realm have already been killed. One can only imagine the significant losses those families have suffered...” he replied with a sad shake of his head as he spoke.

As Li Tongya listened, he noticed a few more people arriving on the boat, prompting the youth to reluctantly excuse himself to entertain the new patrons.

Li Tongya could not help but think to himself, That Jianixi is really powerful... I hope he dies soon so we can all sleep well at night.

Li Tongya listened to the conversation between the newcomers for a moment before feeling the boat jolting, realizing that they had arrived at the market.

Disembarking, he rented a stall using a Spirit Stone as the deposit and displayed an array of materials — which included the talismans Li Xiangping had acquired after killing the Old Daoist for sale.

Once the stall had been set up, he took out a wooden slip to fill up his time while waiting for customers to arrive.

Li Tongya had dedicated more than ten years to studying talismans by now, having honed his skills to the point where his success rate in drawing a talisman was one in ten.

While this could barely offset the cost of the talisman papers, it was still considered a loss if he were to factor in the expense of talisman ink. Determined to improve, he continued to practice in the hope that one day he could make a profit from his talismans.

Li Tongya glanced down and noticed the storage pouch and two qi bottles at his waist. After a few moments of consideration, he speculated that the boatman had probably identified him as a member of a prestigious family because of them.

To appear more inconspicuous, he wrapped the qi bottles in a piece of spirit cloth and tucked them into his chest pocket. Now without them, he looked like a convincing rogue cultivator.

Li Tongya came early this time, so there were still a lot of people shopping. Within two hours, he had nearly sold out of his goods and felt no inclination to wait around to sell off his last few items.

He closed his stall, retrieved the Spirit Stone he had deposited earlier, and paid ten jin of Spirit Rice as a rental fee.

“A profit of eleven Spirit Stones... That’s not bad.”

Li Tongya spent five of them on a Jade Sprout Pill. With the additional one that he had retrieved from the cave dwelling before, he decided to wait a few more months before attempting to break through to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Although the Jade Sprout Pills are effective, their toxic after-effects shouldn’t be underestimated. I must wait for a few more months until every trace of its after-effect has been detoxified before considering taking it again.

As he took a few steps, Li Tongya noticed a middle-aged female cultivator approaching. She seemed to have condensed the Jade Capital Chakra and attained the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

Her appearance suggested that she was around the same age as Li Tongya, but she cupped her fist respectfully almost instantly as she spotted him.

“Senior! Do you still remember me?”

Li Tongya thought she looked quite familiar, but her name eluded him. He could only reciprocate the gesture as he racked his mind. “If I may I ask...” he began, awkwardly.

“Market at the Cloud Crowned Peak... the Ebony Bow?” the middle-aged female cultivator reminded him with a smile.

It was then that Li Tongya recalled the Ebony Bow he had purchased for Li Xiangping at the market located at the foot of Cloud Crowned Peak, where he had submitted the tributes to the sect. The middle-aged lady was only a young girl when he had purchased that bow.

“It’s been more than ten years since I’ve seen you! How have you been, fellow Daoist?” Li Tongya inquired, though secretly puzzled as to why she had approached him.

The female cultivator wore a conflicted look on her face as she remarked, “It’s only been a little over ten years, yet you’re already a Qi Cultivator...”

“It’s just luck,” Li Tongya responded with a chuckle.

“I’m Lin Jingyu, my husband is a Qi Cultivator named Xu Yangping,” said the female cultivator as she introduced herself.

“Li Tongya,” he replied politely, nodding his head.

“We actually have found a cave dwelling... are you interested in exploring it with us, Senior?” Lin Jingyi asked in a soft voice.

“A cave dwelling...?” Li Tongya narrowed his eyes, suspicious of the offer.

How can there be such a good thing? We’re pretty much strangers to each other... can I really trust her? This person could not possibly be here to swindle me or kill me...

“Oh? That sounds like incredible luck,” Li Tongya commented with a chuckle.

Lin Jingyi quickly sensed his skepticism and whispered, “We’ve already checked the cave dwelling. It belonged to a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm from at least two hundred years ago... we have the means to enter, but we lack one cultivator of the Qi Cultivation Realm...”

Li Tongya laughed.

“You’re seeking my help... because a group of cultivators of the Embryonic Breathing Realm like you can’t break the formation of the cave dwelling?” he asked, amused.

He merely stared at her in silence and was ready to walk away.

“Not exactly...” Lin Jingyi replied with an awkward smile before continuing. “We already have two cultivators of the Qi Cultivation Realm... we’re just one short of entering this cave dwelling,” she explained.

After hearing that statement, Li Tongya was slightly more convinced and agreed to sit down with Lin Jingyi to further discuss the matter.

They found a bamboo building and ordered a cup of tea before continuing their discussion. Lin Jingyi then explained, “My husband and I have been active in the Mushroom Forest Plain and some years ago, it was invaded by the Golden Tang Gate. Since then, that area has been deserted, and the market there is no longer operating. Since my husband has attained the Qi Cultivation Realm, we decided to venture westward to explore Moongaze Lake... ”

“We didn’t expect that the drought would hit Moongaze Lake when we arrived. The water had receded a few miles, which exposed a cave dwelling in the lake. After being submerged for hundreds of years, the cave dwelling showed some defects that allowed my husband and I to notice it. We’ve cast a concealment spell there before coming here to seek help from others,” she elaborated.

“I see.” Li Tongya nodded slowly in understanding.

“Why me?” he asked doubt in his eyes.

Lin Jingyi hesitated before responding. “Because of your relatively low cultivation level... my husband is only at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and the person we found a few days ago was only at the third heavenly layer. We’ve witnessed enough ugly sides of cultivators, so we hope to find someone with a similar cultivation background...”

“I see,” Li Tongya replied, taking a sip of his tea. “Is that your husband waiting outside?”

Li Tongya had already noticed someone waiting outside and decided to point it out. Lin Jingyi nodded, then called out to the man.

The person then entered as he was summoned, cupping his fist as soon as he approached.

“I’m Xu Yangping. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Brother Tongya!” he greeted respectfully.

The man was quite good-looking and seemed to be in his fifties. Li Tongya returned the gesture.

“No need for such formalities.”

Xu Yangping nodded and straightened up before speaking.

“We’ve been waiting here for over ten days... if Brother Tongya hadn’t shown up, we would have had no choice but to seek help from nearby clans.”

“The mountain gate formations of those clans are tightly guarded, who knows how many Qi Cultivators there are... we’re reluctant to approach them unless absolutely necessary,” Lin Jingyi added.

Li Tongya decided to waste no time.

“Take a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath,” he demanded.

Xu Yangping nodded before performing a series of hand seals and repeated what Lin Jingyi had said earlier.

As he performed the final hand seal, he muttered solemnly, “In the name of the Profound Scenery, I swear that all that was said is true.”

Li Tongya listened to every word carefully. Upon detecting no omissions in the details and seeing that Xu Yangping’s powerful aura remained unchanged, some of his doubt had dissipated.

“When are we departing?” he asked.

“Right now!” the couple replied eagerly.

However, before they set off, Lin Jingyi turned to face Li Tongya.

“I’ll have to ask you to take an oath that you won’t harm us. Though the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath is primarily for safeguarding secrets and confirming truths and might not be entirely foolproof, it would still offer us some peace of mind.”

“Fine.”

Li Tongya then took the oath as well, wasting no time.

Once that was done, they then rode the wind along with Xu Yangping. Observing the man’s slightly mottled true essence, Li Tongya could tell that Xu Yangping had absorbed various unrefined qi and felt slightly relieved.

Conversely, the couple also noticed Li Tongya’s clear and bright true essence. This prompted them to look at each other, exchanging a bitter smile.

Meanwhile in Lijing Town...

Chen Erniu was seventy this year, with a head full of gray hair. Having lived twice the age of most farmers, his eyes had turned cloudy from old age and everyone in Lijing Town called him Grandpa.

He sat restlessly in his chair, haunted by nightmares brought on by the dry weather that reminded him of the huge sparrow that descended upon his hometown on that fateful day.

When Lichuankou Village was successfully recovered, Chen Erniu went off to search for his son, Chen Sanshui.

He never found any sign of him, apart from a tooth and a puddle of blood. The locals all claimed that Chen Sanshui had been captured by those from Mount Yue and taken to the west.

Chen Erniu merely snorted coldly, but still... he followed the horse’s tracks and searched in the tall weeds by the road until he came across a puddle of dried blood.

Upon parting the tall weeds at the roadside, he discovered a heartbreaking scene before him and cried out in anguish.

His eldest son, Chen Sanshui... had met a tragic end.

The arid conditions proved challenging for Chen Sanshui’s children, leaving the old man to oversee the vigil beside his son’s body most of the time during the funeral.

“I wonder if Donghe will make it home safely...” Chen Erniu’s frown deepened as he worried about his other son.

As he pondered, a commotion outside the courtyard caught his attention. A clamorous crowd was making a racket, their loud cries and shouts causing him to shudder.

Moving to the entrance of the village with the support of his cane, Chen Erniu found a crowd gathered. In their midst, a group of wretched, mud-covered men kneeled on the ground, surrounded by mournful wails.

“He’s back...”

Chen Erniu tried his best to straighten up and finally caught a glimpse of Li Xuanxuan and Chen Donghe.

Li Xuanxuan, who had already grown a light beard, stared incredulously at the Mount Yue men in front of him.

“Say... that again?!”
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝙬𝙚𝓫𝒏𝓸𝓿𝓮𝒍.𝓬𝙤𝓶

“He’s been killed by a curse... we couldn’t even bring his body back...”

Li Xuanxuan froze for a few moments before tears flowed like streams from his eyes, leaving streaks all the way to his neck.

“Donghe... ascend the mountain with me. The rest of you go home first.”

Li Xuanxuan had covered his face for a long time in silence before he could finally squeeze the words out of his mouth.

Chen Donghe’s face was also stained with tears and had a pained expression. The crowd silently parted a way for them and watched them leave in silence.

“Family Head...” Chen Donghe addressed Li Xuanxuan softly, snapping him back to his senses.

Li Xuanxuan looked at the Ebony Bow in his hand and could not stop his tears.

“Call me Young Family Head...” Li Xuanxuan replied, choking back tears as he wiped them away, stepping onto the stone path and clutching the bow tightly.

The two of them walked in silence with their heads bowed for a while before they ran into Li Xuanfeng, who hurriedly descended down the mountain. Li Xuanfeng froze when he spotted the Ebony Bow in Li Xuanxuan’s hand.

“No! How can this be?!” he cried out as realization struck him. Tears quickly welled up in Li Xuanfeng’s eyes as he viciously snatched the bow and yelled, “WHO DID IT?”

Chen Donghe felt even worse at the sight of more members of the Li Family.

“He was killed by Mount Yue’s curse,” he whispered hoarsely.

Li Xuanfeng opened his mouth but could not utter a single word. He looked at Li Xuanxuan whose face was full of tears, and slumped on a rock, the strength seemingly gone from his legs.

“How despicable.”

Li Xuanfeng gritted his teeth as tears finally streamed down his face.
