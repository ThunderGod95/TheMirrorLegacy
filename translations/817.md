# Chapter 817: The Secret of the Great Ancestor

"So it's the Beihai Sea Dragon King. A simple summons would have sufficed; there was no need for such a formal invitation."

The azure-robed demon soldier cautiously raised his eyes. He saw an imposing man in soft armor step out of the cabin, his attitude polite enough.

"Lead the way."

These few azure-robed demons were all at the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. Li Zhouwei used his ocular technique and discerned they were some kind of deep-sea green shrimp. To command such a presence in the Beihai Sea, they had to be serving a Dragon-kin. Li Zhouwei had a decent relationship with Dingjiao, and this Dragon King was considered an elder.

A massive, jewel-encrusted, high-backed chair rose from the sea, lifted by a host of demons. It was as large as a house, supported beneath by nine black-backed turtles. The armrests were fashioned from two white Hooked Serpent heads, polished smooth and inscribed with glowing blue runes, emanating a fierce aura.

The Dragon-kin had used Hooked Serpent nobles for decoration for ages. Guest chair armrests, in particular, often used their heads. They disdained black or gray serpents, insisting on using only white ones. Li Zhouwei landed on the seat; his entire human frame was smaller than one of the armrests. The crowd of demons swayed as they carried him forward.

Li Zhouwei had assumed some minor Dragon-kin official had detected him. He never expected the Beihai Sea Dragon King himself to send an invitation. It seemed like a great honor, but it was actually a headache.

‘Is this necessary? Unsolicited kindness is, nine times out of ten, a trap, especially coming from a Demon of this level. Dragons and the White Qilin share a bond, and Dingjiao even said this Beihai Sea Dragon King once met Emperor Gong of Wei. But if the relationship was truly that reliable, there would be at least a single White Qilin left in the entire Eastern Sea...’

He sat cross-legged, sinking into heavy thought. The seat beneath him moved slowly but covered ground rapidly. Hundreds of miles passed in what felt like moments. The water currents rushed by. The toad stationed beneath the seat called out obsequiously:

"Your Majesty, we’ve arrived at Changliu Mountain!"

‘Changliu Mountain?’

Li Zhouwei immediately sensed something was wrong.

‘If the Beihai Sea Dragon King invited me, why didn't he take me to his Dragon Palace in the Beihai Sea? Why call me to Changliu Mountain!’

He frowned. The azure-robed demon at his side was sharp. The instant the toad finished shouting, he immediately followed up, his voice soft:

"Indeed, that is Changliu Mountain ahead. Our Lord rarely emerges from seclusion. He is currently on the mountain discussing the profound with a Daoist Master. Knowing you were also in the Beihai Sea, he invited you to join them."

‘It seems this Daoist Master of Changliu Mountain... is truly intimate with the Dragon-kin.’

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully. The conveyance stopped at the foot of the mountain, where a young woman dressed as a Daoist nun waited. She looked sixteen or seventeen, her face rosy. The moment she saw him, she actually bowed low to the ground.

"Greetings, Your Majesty. The two lords are waiting for you on the mountain."

Li Zhouwei felt a slight shock, his expression shifting. He re-examined the immortal mountain but saw no one else, only this single Daoist nun. The two green shrimp demons followed him ashore. The Changliu Mountain nun bowed repeatedly to them, but the two demons merely offered a slight nod in return.

Li Zhouwei remained silent.

‘Changliu Mountain is also a Purple Mansion Realm lineage... yet they debase themselves like this. The Hetian Sea... it truly is nothing more than the backyard of the Dragon-kin...’

He proceeded up the mountain. Along the way, he saw no cultivators coming or going, nor any medicine gardens or pavilions. The spirit trees flanking the path were dense, obscuring nearly everything from view, which only intensified his feeling of unease.

They soon reached the summit. The two azure-robed demons moved ahead to guide him, and he finally saw a vast, luxurious palace. They passed through three successive gates, all guarded by demons. The pillars lining the path grew taller, painted with the wave patterns of Converging Water.

"My Lord! The White Qilin has been brought!"

The two demons spoke in unison, their voices echoing in the vast, empty hall. From the front, however, came the sound of sweet, high-pitched, rustling giggles.

Li Zhouwei performed his salutations and slightly raised his brow.

On the main throne at the highest point sat a robust, gray-haired man. He had a high-bridged nose, narrow eyes, and wildly disheveled hair. His eyes were shockingly large and glowed with a flashing red light. The light in the palace was already dim; viewed from afar, he looked like a fiend from a grim fog.

He wore a suit of silver-white soft armor. Long, gray-white fur spilled from the gaps in the armor plates, flowing down his body. His hands were as large as human heads, his claws gleaming coldly as they rested on the armrests.

This demon sat with his legs spread wide. Sitting on his left knee, which was as broad as a small table, was a woman. She had dark black hair and an innocent face, draped in a semi-transparent white gauze. Her pristine white thigh and most of her upper torso were completely bare. Her eyes were shaded and remote, their color indistinct.

Within the massive palace court, dozens of other Daoist nuns of varying beauty sat gathered below the main throne. Some held fruit platters, others raised golden jugs, all of them flirting and laughing, each displaying their own charms.

The rosy-cheeked Daoist nun who had greeted him at the mountain's base went up, smiled, and greeted her companions, joining her sisters to kneel and massage the Dragon King’s feet.

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze slightly, refusing to watch. The suspicion in his heart was suddenly confirmed.

‘Just as I thought...’

The one on the throne was undoubtedly the Beihai Sea Dragon King. The cultivator who met him had said, 'two lords are waiting.' The entire atmosphere of Changliu Mountain was one of dissolute indulgence. Who else could the Daoist nun on his knee possibly be?

She had to be the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master of Changliu Mountain, the Daoist Master Xiang Chun.

‘No wonder... No wonder Changliu Mountain receives such preferential treatment. No wonder the Daoist Master Xiang Chun treats humans and demons as equals. The demons in the Beihai Sea only dare to say the Daoist Master and the Dragon King are 'close'... This goes far beyond just being close...’

‘I heard Daoist Master Xiang Chun is mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm and not old; she only broke through in the last hundred years. The Beihai Sea Dragon King is old enough to be her grandmaster... Several of the Dragon Princes are probably older than Daoist Master Xiang Chun... She clearly isn't his official wife. Dragons are inherently lecherous... and no one dares to spread a single word of gossip about it...’

This was truly an awkward situation. The Beihai Sea Dragon King obviously didn't mind the relationship being known, or he wouldn't be sitting here so brazenly. What Daoist Master Xiang Chun thought about it, however, was hard to say.

Li Zhouwei couldn't fathom their motives. Having completed his salutations, he could only offer an ambiguous greeting:

"My respects to both the lords..."

The gray-haired man spoke. His voice was just as fierce as his appearance—gruff and deviant. "White Qilin... I heard Jiao'er mention you. I just finished my seclusion, and since you happened to be in the Beihai Sea, I decided to see you."

He loosened his grip, allowing Xiang Chun to slide off his knee. With a wave of his sleeve, the crowd of female cultivators below dispersed. The moment Xiang Chun’s feet touched the ground, a set of black-gray Daoist robes materialized, covering her completely. She took a seat to the side.

Only then did the Beihai Sea Dragon King continue, "This is Daoist Master Xiang Chun, the mistress of Changliu Mountain."

After he spoke, Daoist Master Xiang Chun replied in a soft voice, "Lieyun... so this is the White Qilin. I have read much about them, but this is the first time I have seen one."

Unsure what medicine these two were selling, Li Zhouwei could only maintain perfect etiquette and bow once more.

Dongfang Lieyun's status was clearly far beyond Dingjiao's. He didn't offer Li Zhouwei a seat, instead speaking with detached interest.

"I saw Emperor Gong of Wei in my youth. That one was a Golden Core direct descendant and the lord of a Immortal Dynasty. He was purer than this one. But his temperament wasn't much like a White Qilin. I imagine it was because the state's destiny was fading, and the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment was unstable."

Xiang Chun nodded, whispering, "That was during the Wei era. Today, he is a rare sight in the world, a White Qilin."

The gray-haired man blinked slightly, his glittering red eyes finally turning toward Li Zhouwei. Dongfang Lieyun smiled.

"I sought you out for Xiang Chun."

Li Zhouwei looked up. The Dragon King said flatly:

"Bright Yang and Veiled Yin are the foundation of Valley Water. Xiang Chun requires White Qilin blood to cultivate a divine ability."

A bitter chill shot up his spine. Li Zhouwei quickly composed himself. His expression remained unchanged as he replied, "To be able to help the Daoist Master is this junior’s honor."

Dongfang Lieyun laughed loudly and nodded slightly toward Xiang Chun, his voice softening.

"I will take him now. When the required years are fulfilled, I will refine a measure of White Qilin blood and send it over to you."

He then rose from the main throne, casting an enormous shadow over the hall. Without sparing another glance at anyone, he waved his sleeve. Immediately, azure seawater gathered at his feet, and they warped away through the Great Void.

***

The entire grand hall instantly fell empty. Daoist Master Xiang Chun remained standing in the same spot, staring coldly into the empty space. After a long moment, a slight smile touched her face.

"White Qilin blood... It’s mine!"

***

Amidst a blur of azure light, Li Zhouwei’s vision cleared, revealing a dazzling crystalline expanse. A palace seemingly made of crystal, with jade-like steps appearing one by one, filled his sight. He let out a breath. Not far away stood a jade platform.

An intense chill radiated from his side.

The Beihai Sea Dragon King, Dongfang Lieyun—who looked more fiend than man—was sitting sprawled on the steps beside him. His form was so massive that his legs spanned five or six steps at once. He held a jade pot, those crimson pupils fixed squarely on Li Zhouwei.

He glanced at Li Zhouwei, then stood up, his voice low.

"I called you here for a few things. In this world, only on the surface of the Hetian Sea can certain matters be discussed. It is fortunate we can settle them all today."

Dongfang Lieyun’s voice had changed, shedding its earlier deviant tone, becoming heavy and powerful. Li Zhouwei immediately understood.

"Your Majesty, please speak."

Dongfang Lieyun paced to the great doors of the crystal palace and stood with his back to Li Zhouwei, his voice deep.

"The Wei Great Ancestor, Li Qianyuan. Do you know of him?"

Li Zhouwei sensed the gravity in that low tone. A creeping sense of dread, a feeling of mortal danger, prickled his skin. "The founding monarch of Wei. Naturally, I know of him."

Dongfang Lieyun spoke quietly. "The Zhou Dynasty divided the world, sparking endless wars that could not be stopped. Finally, the True Monarch fell, and the state lineage was severed by Jin. From then on, the world knew no peace. Often, the death of one emperor meant the end of the dynasty. There was even a century that saw six changes of rulers. The Great Ancestor emerged from Guanlong to conquer Qi and Lu, unifying the north. He became the first emperor to verify Bright Yang, and the very first human master of the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment."

"Following that, he established the Immortal Dynasty. The Imperial Throne *was* the Fruition Attainment. To ascend the throne was to borrow the status of a Golden Core; to accept an official rank was to borrow the dharma power of Bright Yang. Although the Wei court was consequently brutal, it was a true Immortal Dynasty... Of Wei, Qi, Liang, and Zhao, only Emperor Wu of Liang learned his method. Only the Wei and Liang dynasties possessed this power. The others had only the name of a Immortal Dynasty, not the reality."

"As for refuse like Zhao and Yan, it is laughable. They were merely puppets of the Buddhist cultivators, yet they dared call themselves emperors!"

He continued to face away from Li Zhouwei, explaining as if to himself:

"Everyone believed the Wei dynasty he founded was the greatest method ever devised to solve the barrier between immortal and mortal, the best way to build an immortal kingdom... Yet such a figure, a man only half a step from the Dao Embryo, suddenly died a violent death. The Bright Yang Fruition Attainment returned to the Great Void. Because of this, Emperor Gong of Wei collapsed, exploding into a pile of rotten meat right in front of the court. The imperial majesty built over generations became a terrifying, horrific joke... The officials simultaneously lost their power, and thus, the nation disintegrated."

"This method of the immortal kingdom was subsequently stolen by the Buddhists. They studied and improved it, filling in the gaps generation by generation, which led to the Seven Phases Buddhist Land method they use today. Ultimately, the Northern Buddhists persecute the Wei Li clan so desperately not just because of karma. It is just like a common thief who steals another’s property, then jumps up and down, screaming accusations, desperately wishing they could kill the original owner so the stolen item truly becomes their own."

Li Zhouwei’s hair stood on end. Dongfang Lieyun finally turned his face, revealing an expression of grim, agonizing depression.

"It was Luoxia... You have met Li Xunquan. Mount Luoxia’s plot for the Bright Yang position is no secret. But the Great Ancestor's influence on the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment is too deep. He imbued it with too much meaning, and Heaven itself approved him. The Fruition Attainment recognizes only him. But he has lost his sanity, so he can only fall from the Great Void, again and again... Luoxia applies its influence bit by bit, using these repeated falls to wear away his divine power and his fate—and, of course, to torture Li Xunquan."

"The last one... your family is familiar with him. It was Chu Yi."

Li Zhouwei snapped his head up. Dongfang Lieyun continued, "After a thousand years, Bright Yang is finally, greatly corrupted. Luoxia has gradually seized the true initiative. They opened their grotto-heaven, leaking vast quantities of Bright Yang cultivation methods into the world. Normally, cultivating Bright Yang would help the Great Ancestor, but he is too defiled. When these cultivators impact the Purple Mansion Realm or the Golden Core, influencing heaven and earth, it instead helps to shake the Fruition Attainment."

"And you... you are a watershed moment."

Dongfang Lieyun’s expression was complex, tinged with a cruel venom. "The Bright Yang Fruition Attainment is finally willing to bestow its destiny upon another. That destiny is upon you. Your probability of successfully impacting the Purple Mansion Realm is enormous; you could even strike for the Fruition Attainment itself. You don't even need to succeed. The very act of *trying* will cause him immense damage... Although we lack the power to rescue the Great Ancestor, based on the meager strength we do possess, my hornless dragon lineage *should* kill you."

"But, inconveniently, you are a descendant of Wei Li. You can be considered a junior of Emperor Gong of Wei... From that angle, it seems we should help you. You must understand the hornless dragon lineage’s complicated feelings toward you... Ignoring you... already seems the best possible solution."

His voice gradually turned sinister. "My branch was closer to Emperor Gong of Wei. Some time ago, I sent Dingjiao to retrieve you, to slowly reveal the matter of the Wei Li, all while trying to avoid Mount Luoxia's notice. But things changed. You possess the body of a White Qilin. Changxiao covets your destiny. He chased Li Ximing all the way to the Eastern Sea, shamelessly probing with that dog face of his, while Luoxia watched from the sidelines."

"A spirit cultivator of my Dragon kin has deep ties to your Li clan and was forced to intervene and save him. She is intimately connected to the Dragon Monarch. The moment she acted, high-level cultivators could deduce exactly what step the Dragon Monarch’s secret affairs had reached. This situation twisted and turned, becoming Luoxia’s poisonous scheme to probe my hornless dragon lineage, allowing them to see the Dragon Monarch's true state. I do not know if Changxiao intended this, but the people from Mount Luoxia have already succeeded."

"This move put us badly on the defensive... This Venerable One sensed then that something was wrong."

Li Zhouwei’s expression changed drastically as he realized the Dragon King’s gaze was utterly bleak. Dongfang Lieyun’s voice dropped, turning cold as steel.

"It made This Venerable One consider a possibility. Mount Luoxia is extremely close to Bright Yang. They could not possibly be unaware of your destiny. So why didn't they come to collect you? Wouldn't it be far better to have you under their control? What if... what if this destiny of yours was *lured* out by them, deliberately bestowed upon a Wei Li descendant... specifically to trap my lineage in this dilemma? You... and the entire Li clan... what if you are nothing but a trap, deliberately allowed to exist by Mount Luoxia?"

The Dragon King’s pupils contracted, narrowing until they were almost two vertical red lines. He hissed, "You are the handiwork of Mount Luoxia."
