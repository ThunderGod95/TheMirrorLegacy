# Chapter 883: Golden Qi Soars to the Heavens

The Heavenly Light shone brilliantly. Atop the Viewing Pavilion Platform, flames raged, and at their center stood the red-robed Chu Minglian. His expression was one of intense concentration as he manipulated the billowing Radiant Fire.

In his lifetime, Chu Minglian had refined countless dharma artifacts. Even Li Xuanfeng's famous weapon, White Lightning, was his original creation. Although its subsequent upgrades had relied heavily on "Please Lord Take This Golden Talisman", the achievement had still brought him great renown.

This particular spirit embryo, however, was in a league of its ownâ€”an unprecedented creation that already transcended the very definition of a dharma artifact. For a cultivator who prided himself on refinement, forging it was an immense honor, one that demanded his absolute, unwavering focus.

After seeing his elder brother off from Moongaze, Li Ximing descended in a ray of light, landing on the platform. Chu Minglian immediately bowed.

"Congratulations..."

Li Ximing cut him off with a wave of his hand. He peered into the flames at the spirit embryo and asked: "How is the Shichuan progressing?"

Chu Minglian hurriedly offered his congratulations again. "Congratulations, Daoist Master! Everything is proceeding as planned. Although my humble skills are lacking, and I cannot claim to refine such an item effortlessly, the spiritual essences you provided are exceptionally potent. They have more than compensated for my shortcomings and have even elevated the spirit embryo's foundational quality to a new level."

Li Ximing nodded in acceptance. While he was no master refiner, he possessed the *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*. This allowed him to see through any dharma artifact at a glance. He observed the magnificent, pulsing crimson light within the flames and nodded again. "You have worked hard."

Chu Minglian humbly demurred. As he did, Li Ximing glanced over. A female cultivator in white robes, a sword strapped to her back, was descending onto the platform.

Her features weren't conventionally stunning, but she possessed an exceptional bearing. Her skin was as smooth as fine cream, and the absence of makeup only enhanced her clear, elegant beauty. She bowed to Li Ximing, her voice as clear and crisp as melting snow.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing looked at her, slightly surprised, and nodded. "Good! Your breakthrough was impressively fast."

This was none other than Li Xinghan, who had just emerged from seclusion after her breakthrough.

Li Xinghan had entered seclusion around the time the Hall of the Locust Soul was founded, over four years ago. It was indeed a rapid advancement. Li Ximing only needed a moment's thought to understand why.

'Xinghan cultivates the Jade True path. With the True Monarch having returned to their station, the world's jade energies are at an unprecedented peak. She also encountered the Inward Heart Surging Profundity, an event that benefits both the ancient paths and the Immortal Dao, especially for those in seclusion. Her breakthrough is no surprise at all!'

She was likely here at the Viewing Pavilion Platform to take over the watch. A pleased expression on his face, Li Ximing beckoned her closer. His gaze fell on the treasured sword she carried as he rose into the air on a ray of light, sighing.

"Good, good, good. The Old Master mentioned it long ago. With the return of the Jade True, several of the younger generation went into seclusion. He said you were the one he worried least about, but seeing you in person finally sets my mind at ease!"

"Among the Zhou generation, aside from Li Zhouwei, there really isn't anyone else who can shoulder the family's burdens. If only there were just one more with outstanding strength..."

Li Xinghan simply smiled and bowed. "This junior cultivates the *Jade Dao Unity True Art* and has achieved the 'True Dao Unification' foundation. There is a point of white brilliance in my Qi Sea that allows me to grasp the true essence of spell arts and pursue the pinnacle of any technique. It benefits my understanding of talismans, pills, and artifacts, as well as the arts of the sword and saber. When I cultivate a Dharma Art, I find it's especially effective if it's a movement technique or one cast through a dharma artifact."

"With the blessing of my Immortal Foundation, this 'True Dao Unification' allows me to enter an optimal state as a battle progresses. My eyes become clear enough to pierce illusions and perceive the smallest details..."

"Now that True Monarch Shangyuan has achieved Fruition Attainment, my 'True Dao Unification' has been greatly enhanced. It's completely different from the version the Yu family had. But..." She suddenly revealed a trace of confusion. "There is just one thing I still don't understand, and I wished to ask you, my Lord. My Immortal Foundation has another, stranger property. If I use a transformation art, the duration is not only greatly extended, but it's also far more difficult for others to see through... It sounds almost like... the Shamanic Talisman Dao."

Li Ximing led her further up the mountain, nodding slightly. He had, in fact, learned a fair bit about this from Zhusheng.

"'Jade True', although it has drawn closer to the Immortal Dao due to the Great One's breakthrough, is still, at its root, the 'Six-Nine Jade True,' one of the three great shamanic lineages. Transformation is a natural part of its power."

He smiled. "As for transformation arts, Que'Wan knows a few. They are far from useless. Furthermore, the old Eastern Yue Kingdom was infamous for its practitioners of shamanic arts; they were exceptionally fierce. Although a century of being... tamed... has left them as docile as sheep, their shamanic arts techniques are still stored in our vaults. If you have time, looking through them might prove beneficial."

"I will remember the Daoist Master's teachings!"

Li Xinghan affirmed. Since he was here, Li Ximing took the opportunity to ask, "I've been in seclusion for over a year. How are things with the family?"

Li Xinghan quickly replied, "It's not just this junior who broke through. Jianglong's breakthrough was even faster. He entered seclusion later than I did, but I had only just emerged when he broke through as well. He recently left for the Eastern Shore with Protector Chen."

"The Eastern Shore..."

As Li Xinghan spoke, she dutifully poured him a cup of tea. A theory immediately formed in Li Ximing's mind.

'That's not surprising. The Great One in the north is currently tempering himself in the mortal world. He even paid a visit to the lake. It's very likely he provided some assistance.'

He wasn't as familiar with Li Jianglong as he was with the young woman before him. Of all Li Zhouwei's children, only Li Jiangqian had met him more than a few times. Li Ximing quickly changed the subject.

"Our family still bears the title of a Sword Immortal Clan. Years ago, that name carried weight, but in the last decade or two, it's rarely mentioned. Very few of the younger generation even practice the sword. You are a rare exception. This legacy cannot be allowed to die. You must guard it well."

Li Xinghan accepted the charge. Li Ximing continued.

"I asked you some years ago... have you mastered the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon?"

Li Xinghan quickly replied, "The Sword Immortal's legacy is profound and difficult to fathom. After many years of study, this junior finally made some progress and managed to learn it a few years ago."

Li Xinghan drew the chilly blade from her back. With a gentle pull, a cold glint flared. A swath of sword light, as bright as moonlight on snow and as large as a ship's sail, flashed into existence. It shimmered for a brief instant before vanishing, immediately followed by three nimble streams of light, like shooting stars. With no target, they simply danced along the body of the blade.

Although her Way of the Sword already surpassed that of most sword cultivators, it still seemed amateurish compared to Li Ximing's two brothers. Her execution of the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon was precise, almost textbook-perfect, but it was too technical, lacking a spiritual edge.

Li Ximing silently watched the sword light fade. He glanced at the blade, *Hanlin*, in her hand, then lowered his gaze and took a sip of tea.

"Good... After all these years, the *Hanlin* has finally tasted the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon again."

His tone shifted. "However, I made you a promise. I said that if you mastered the Flowing Light of the Triple Moon, I would have a Dharma sword forged for you, one suited to the Jade True path. I will not go back on my word. The *Hanlin* is an extraordinary blade, but it is ultimately not a perfect match for your cultivation."

Li Xinghan quickly bowed in thanks. Li Ximing retrieved a jade box from his sleeve.

"Coincidentally, Chu Minglian is on the lake, and the spirit embryo is nearly complete. This is a Foundation Establishment Realm spiritual item, a Luminous Essence Flower. Take it to the clan treasury and exchange it for a treasure of the Jade True attribute. Then, ask the Old Master to retrieve the broken sword left by Yu Mujian after he surrendered to the Buddhists. With those, your new sword can be forged."

He didn't wait for Li Xinghan to respond, taking another sip of tea before asking abruptly, "I heard... Zhuang Cheng has a legitimate son... who seems rather taken with you. What is the situation now?"

Li Xinghan shifted, slightly uncomfortable.

"Actually, when I was on the verge of my breakthrough, he sent over a very valuable spiritual item of the Jade True attribute. I declined it. He is still on the Eastern Shore, and he often seeks me out to discuss sword techniques. Other than that... I haven't accepted anything else of value from him."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"What are your thoughts on him? Do you like him?"

Li Xinghan didn't seem to care much about marriage one way or another. "He seems to be deeply infatuated with me," she replied evenly. "And the family also feels he is a suitable match. As for whether I 'like' him... I can't really say. But he is exceptionally good to me, so it's difficult *not* to have a favorable impression. Since I certainly don't dislike him, and things have reached this stage, the rest seems to be a matter of course."

"After all... it's not right to keep him waiting indefinitely."

Li Ximing sipped his tea, giving her a surprised look. For a moment, he wasn't sure what to say. He had heard from Li Xuanxuan that this Zhuang Pingye was of top-tier appearance and bearing, with considerable talent as well. He mused for a moment.

"This isn't an overly serious matter. If, after a long time, you find you are incompatible, it can be... addressed then."

He poured more tea. "Since your mind is made up, I will have Jiangqian send them an implicit message."

As a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, Li Ximing didn't need to concern himself with Zhuang Cheng's opinion. A single command was all it would take. The Li family would relay the message, and Zhuang Cheng, despite being a famous figure in the Great Desert, would have to travel personally from the west to the foot of Gardenia Scenery Mountain and bow in gratitude to Li Ximing.

Li Xinghan quietly thanked him. "Cultivate well," Li Ximing said. "Don't let it weigh on your mind."

He picked up a brush, personally penned a few lines of instruction, and ordered Chu Minglian to prepare the spirit embryo for Li Xinghan's new weapon. Only then did he dismiss her. Li Jiangqian, who had been waiting at the foot of the mountain, then came up.

Li Jiangqian bowed deeply. "Reporting to the Daoist Master. During the year of your seclusion, the Great One has fully consolidated the north. He has hunted down and killed nearly every cultivator from the Hall of the Locust Soul. For the past year, strange omens have appeared in the sky almost monthly... The Hall has been utterly exterminated, root and stem."

Li Ximing wasn't surprised. "It seems both sides coordinated well. All those cultivators, unable to escape, were forced to remain and be slaughtered by the Great One."

Li Jiangqian said respectfully, "The Daoist Master is correct. Once the last of their leaders were dead, the Great One's anger finally subsided. The survivors at last scattered, fleeing toward the Eastern Sea. The Great One did not establish his own faction, instead choosing to elevate a few of the local clans... He also granted his most capable subordinates mountains of their own."

"The Great One declared himself the true heir of Secret Diffusion and distributed countless dharma artifacts and spiritual items. Song Yunbai and Xiao Yuan, among others, benefited greatly. More recently, someone has appeared under Xiao Yuan's command... using a false name. It is rumored they are connected to Li Quantao."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. Li Jiangqian continued his report. "As for the surrounding powers... the Capital immortals Dao has suffered heavy losses. Guan Gongxiao himself was nearly killed. The territories of Xuanmiao Temple were almost completely ruined by that Yaosa Chengmi... By the time the Great One arrived, Yaosa Chengmi had already fled to the far north. It's said the Great One is now considering a trip north himself..."

"It's also said that with no one left to lead the Situ family of the Golden Tang Gate, the sect has fallen into chaos, run by low-level cultivators. They've apparently been colluding with some Buddhist monks and have even invited them into their mountain gates."

Hearing this, Li Ximing shook his head and sneered. "None of the great families will bother with them now. It's just a gaggle of ignorant junior cultivators. The only question is whether Golden Feather will intervene."

He then asked the question that concerned him most. "What about Bai Yinzi?"

Li Jiangqian lowered his voice. "This junior searched for a long time without finding any trace. I repeatedly questioned the Zhuang family and investigated several groups of rogue cultivators. We mapped out several mountain ranges and searched them one by one. Finally, we found a range where local rogue cultivators recognized the description. The location should be west of the Tangdao Mountain Range and about a hundred li north of the riverbank."

"I am almost certain he is there!"

Li Ximing nodded, satisfied. This wasn't a discovery made through divine abilities or dharma power, but through pure intelligence gathering and manpower. It had saved him a great deal of effort.

"Such a large-scale search has naturally attracted the attention of watchful eyes. Fortunately, his quarry holds a Dharma sword, which makes our interest perfectly justifiable."

He presented a jade slip with both hands. "His suspected current location, along with several other locations we investigated and ruled out, are all recorded within. Just in case."

Li Ximing accepted it. After hearing a few more updates on family matters, he returned to his jade pillar, preparing to resume his cultivation.

But Li Ximing had barely settled when the spiritual energy of the entire Gardenia Scenery Mountain began to heave like a great tide. His eyes snapped open, revealing profound shock.

His spiritual sense, connected to both the Great Void and the spiritual energy of the real world, was usually calm and tranquil. Even a nearby Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough would barely cause a ripple in the Great Void...

But now, the Great Void was reeling as if from massive, repeated impacts. It roiled like a stormy sea, surging southward, cresting into towering peaks one moment and collapsing into deep troughs the next.

'What is this... Are the earth veins themselves turning over?'

The fluctuations in the mountain's ambient energy might have been subtle, but what Li Ximing perceived through the Great Void was anything but!

*BOOM!*

A deafening, thunder-like roar echoed across the heavens. Li Ximing instantly traversed the Great Void, reappearing on the North Shore and gazing northward.

In the next instant, a colossal pillar of pure golden, iridescent light erupted, as thick as a mountain, tearing straight into the sky. The entire northern horizon was instantly consumed by this pure, golden qi.

*BOOM!*

An absolutely terrifying tremor and roar echoed from the north. The golden qi existed for only a second; it collided with the clouds above and dissolved into a sky-full of autumn dew that began to patter down. But the source of the golden qi did not stop. The earth itself shook, and the Great Void continued to heave, sending one violent shockwave after another from the north.

Riding his Heavenly Light, Li Ximing was in utter disbelief.

'A Purple Mansion Realm expert has fallen? No, that's not quite right...'

He took a step forward, crushing a jade talisman in his hand. Nearby, he quickly found Ning Wan, who was also staring north, her gaze filled with the same stunned astonishment.

Seeing Li Ximing, Ning Wan's eyes lit up. "Congratulations, Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing waved her off, his expression full of questions. "This is..."

Ning Wan's expression was complex. "This phenomenon is... extraordinary. The soaring golden qi is incredibly pure; it must be related to the Purple Mansion Realm. And with the simultaneous tremor of the earth veins... I'm afraid... something has happened at the Golden Tang Gate."

"The Golden Tang Gate?"

Li Ximing had never considered that sect. Only now, connecting the tremor of the earth veins with the sky-filling golden qi, did he realize with dawning horror, "The Golden Tang Gate's Purple Mansion-level Grand Array?!"

"Exactly!"

Ning Wan seemed disconcerted. She stared at the scattered autumn rain falling from the north, clearly at a loss. This event had obviously surpassed her predictions. "The Golden Tang Gate's Purple Mansion Grand Array has shattered," she whispered. "The Sect-Guarding Spirit Array that Situ Tang established all those years ago... along with the one or two priceless treasures that served as its core... they've all just... sublimated. It first shook the earth veins to break the array's foundation, and then vaporized into that pillar of golden qi."

"Three generations of the Situ family, father and son both reaching the Purple Mansion Realm... they were once the preeminent sect of the Xu State. The glorious, unassailable Golden Tang Daoist tradition... Today, it is extinguished."
