# Chapter 800: Seeking the Dao

The long steps were translucent, and white mist churned. From a small pavilion at the edge of the heavens, the faint, clear chime of music drifted over. Inside, a row of emerald chimes sat by the inner hall. Two celestial attendants were playing, their long robes trailing the ground, hidden within the white vapors.

At the front was a long table where a woman in tea-white iridescent robes rested her chin on one hand, writing with a brush held in the other. She possessed an air of clear, otherworldly detachment. A pipa lay beside the table, faintly reflecting the light.

Shaohui had stood guard at the edge of the heavens for many years. Immortal traces rarely reached this place. Even the celestial attendants in the pavilions were spirits dispatched by the Palace of the Supreme Yin. They could not speak and were only capable of simple tasks; once they memorized a rhythm, they could strike the chimes.

She was responsible for eight courtyards and pavilions. The surrounding four courtyards housed minor functionaries and attendants, while the immortal officials from three of the four immortal pavilions had been assigned elsewhere. On normal days, none of them bothered her.

Shaohui was happy for the leisure. She had the patience for quiet cultivation. Furthermore, the immortal officials in these courtyards and pavilions were not her direct subordinates; this was, after all, someone else's territory. Zhengao had found her this quiet post, so she naturally avoided interfering. Only the official from the one remaining immortal pavilion occasionally visited her, and he was dreadfully talkative.

The brush in her hand paused. This manual on Lesser Yin arts was seventy percent complete. Setting the brush down, she looked toward an attendant maiden who entered and bowed in the center, reporting respectfully:

"Reporting to Your Excellency, Dangjiang has arrived."

Shaohui frowned slightly, looking rather helpless. Counting the days, it had been exactly thirty. The man had timed his arrival perfectly. She had no choice but to nod.

"Let him up."

The maiden attendant withdrew. Soon, a person strode in from outside the pavilion. He had the appearance of a youth, with a broad forehead and thick, flourishing hair and beard. He shook out his wave-patterned sleeves and bowed.

"Collating Immortal Official of the Profound Seven Pavilion, Dangjiang, pays respects to the Lord of Lesser Yin Wu-Gui."

"You're here again."

A stark white circular marking dotted Shaohui's brow. She looked over, her eyes weary.

"You. Instead of properly collating scriptures and correcting errors in the east, why do you keep coming here? What is it this time?"

Dangjiang had long since figured out Shaohui's temperament. Though her words were sharp, it was just complaining; she had no real intention of punishing him. Aside from her aversion to conversation, she was an excellent superior. He was currently riding a wave of success and replied:

"If only I were *actually* collating. Your Excellency knows I can't keep my mouth shut. I'm only checking the texts, not comparing them against copies. I'm constantly worried I'll make a mistake in the cultivation methods..."

Collation required two people comparing texts; Dangjiang was just looking for company. Shaohui knew he would just complain about being bored, so she cut him off rather than letting him ramble.

"Get to the point."

Only then did Dangjiang retrieve a token from his sleeve. It was the length of a forearm, pure white, and inscribed with the silver-white sigil of the Supreme Yin, which was currently glowing. He presented it with both hands. "I am here on official business. I must ask Your Excellency to escort me!"

Shaohui raised an eyebrow. She finally stood up, gathered the pipa from the table into her arms, and gracefully drifted down. "After all this time," she commented idly, "you finally have some real work to do."

"Hehe."

Dangjiang chuckled, then hesitated before speaking again.

"That subordinate of mine in the mortal realm... although he's nowhere near my level, he does have some skill. He contacted me at the turn of the year and said he could capture a peacock this time! And it's no ordinary peacock. I hear it cultivates the arts of the Northern Buddhist Lands... I wonder how much merit this one is worth, compared to the last demon..."

A tea-white cloud rose beneath Shaohui's feet, lifting him up as well. As they flew south together, she replied softly:

"That subordinate of yours... is he called Chi Buzi? The last demon he caught, how much merit did the palace record for it?"

Dangjiang quickly replied, "Three hundred immortal merits."

"Oh?"

Shaohui nodded lightly. "Then this peacock might be worth around three hundred and fifty immortal merits."

Dangjiang quickly looked up. He had been enjoying his days, but he hadn't forgotten his promise to Chi Buzi to seek out a path to the Golden Core. He had been holding it in, waiting to ask Immortal Official Liu.

But Immortal Official Liu had left and never returned, leaving his supposed connection useless. With the fire burning his eyebrows, Dangjiang could only turn to Shaohui. He hesitated, "My subordinate cultivates the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. He cultivates his own nature and has already passed the 'Comprehending Purple' stage. He only lacks the final Dao lineage. However, the mortal realm's Fruition Attainment for Pristine Water is already occupied..."

Shaohui reacted quickly, immediately making some deductions. "Occupied is occupied... but I fear the one holding that Fruition Attainment is unwilling to let him achieve the Dao. That makes things difficult. Why not seek the Metallic Essence first? What is the status of that Pristine Water cultivator?"

Dangjiang shook his head. "His condition is poor. He is currently engaged in combat outside the heavens and has no time to spare. This is exactly why I am anxious. Whether it's proving the final Dao of 'Purging Dew,' receiving the Supreme Yin's guidance, or abandoning this path entirely, a decision must be made now. If we wait for that True Monarch to return, there won't be many options left."

"I see."

Shaohui was quite interested. Although her previous incarnation had been an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm demon, condensed from a wisp of Lesser Yin, and her memories retained the influence of many immortal arts, solving this matter was still problematic.

"Since he's your subordinate, why not ask Zhengao? Although Pristine Water is in the mortal realm, there might be an Immortal General of this Dao in the heavens. You could inquire."

"I wanted to!"

Dangjiang couldn't travel far. He wouldn't see another soul for ten days or half a month. He couldn't even find anyone to swap the two male attendants in his courtyard for female attendants, much less inquire about something so important.

'That dog Chi... your cultivation path is truly a dead end.'

Shaohui clearly understood. She paused, then replied, "Just request an audience with Zhengao and ask him properly. Although it will cost quite a bit... Zhengao appears cold but is kind-hearted, and his cultivation is profound. He won't make things difficult for you."

"But... this lowly one has humble words and little influence... What path do I take to find the Lord..."

At Dangjiang's question, Shaohui nodded. "I also need to make a trip to the Supreme Yin Palace this time. Since you asked, you can just accompany me then."

Having secured a path, Dangjiang was overjoyed. Offering profuse thanks, he stood waiting atop the clouds. The vast, magnificent hall appeared once more, twelve white jade bridges arching across the sky, spanning a golden lake.

This time, Shaohui also descended from the clouds, and they proceeded deeper into the hall, eventually arriving outside that same courtyard. From a distance, Dangjiang saw the two attendant maidens still standing outside. The one who previously held the white-rimmed jade pipa now held a Pure Cloud Jade Vase, while the other still carried a flower basket. When they saw him looking, they even returned a polite courtesy.

'...'

He strode to the front of the courtyard, keeping his eyes fixed forward. Behind him, Shaohui stopped. Dangjiang scanned them with his peripheral vision. This time, the attendant's basket was filled with glistening little fruits, the kind of goods that looked like they could bankrupt a person.

Terrified that Shaohui would remember he still owed her a [Moon Laurel Golden Branch], Dangjiang practically fled into the courtyard. The four lamp stands within the yard were blazing brightly, and the central round pool had already turned a shimmering white. He quickly formed a hand seal and activated the token.

"Activate!"

The figure of a man in green robes materialized above the pool. Dangjiang was still somewhat distracted. Chi Buzi stepped out of the pool, glanced around, and noticed the idiot spacing out by the poolside. He frowned.

"What are you losing your mind about?"

Dangjiang laughed in exasperation and shook his head. "That 'souvenir' you suddenly demanded last time. You *will* compensate me for it!"

Dangjiang had suffered a huge loss that time and still held a grudge. He had mentioned it to him two years prior, but Chi Buzi had merely treated it as a joke. Hearing it again now, he laughed and replied:

"Serves you right."

He hadn't come here to argue with Dangjiang. Before the other man could erupt, he immediately frowned.

"I caught that peacock for you. Do you have any news on your end?"

Dangjiang raised an eyebrow. He noticed that Chi Buzi was not only completely unscathed but also radiating a powerful aura. It seemed he hadn't even expended much dharma power this time. Dangjiang was secretly impressed but remained stubborn with his words.

"Just based on the few things you've caught so far... your efficiency is pathetic. These one or two demons are just minor figures in the Purple Mansion Realm. Why don't you take a piss and look at your own reflection? Yet you have the nerve to rush me for news?"

Chi Buzi sneered. "Give me a break. With you trying to get something for nothing, the fact that I'm willing to catch *anything* for you means I'm giving you face. Do you have news or not? What 'connection'? Don't tell me you were just bluffing."

This remark set Dangjiang off. He cursed, "You ungrateful wretch! Do you have any idea how I've schemed and managed my relationships these past few years? I haven't slept properly for nights! Do you know how much I've spent out of my own pocket... just to get you this chance to meet an Immortal General? And this is the thanks I get..."

Hearing this, Chi Buzi raised his eyebrows slightly, surprised.

"Meet an Immortal General?"

Chi Buzi didn't believe for a second that this idiot was capable of any grand "scheming." When they corresponded two years ago, the man had been vague, clearly lacking any confidence. He probably hadn't made any progress at all. His claims of maneuvering now likely meant he'd just stumbled into some dumb luck and gotten it done.

'As long as it got done... it's a good thing. I'll meet this Immortal General first and see... Still, I should probably praise the idiot.'

Chi Buzi affected an expression of amazement, offering a few words of thanks that sounded like he was conceding against his will. As expected, Dangjiang burst out laughing, looking incredibly smug. After chatting for a moment, the man seemed to remember something and said grudgingly:

"Did you ever find Immortal Official Li?"

Dangjiang had tasked him with this some time ago. But unlike the Golden Core lineage, this matter had no definite leads. Chi Buzi was also far cleverer than Dangjiang and just smiled.

"So what if I found him? So what if I didn't? Am I supposed to explain the matter of reincarnation to him? If that messes up the arrangements of those Above, who gets punished? You or me?"

This shut Dangjiang up completely. He truly didn't want to keep toiling like an ox and a horse every day. He sighed for a long time before replying, "In any case... just look for him. If he has his memories, just ask around for me."

To Chi Buzi, this was utter nonsense, but he firmly committed this information to memory.

What family was the reason he, Chi Buzi, first came into contact with [The Heavens] and Dangjiang? The Li Family of Moongaze! And what was Moongaze Lake? It was the foothold of the Moonlight Origin Mansion back then...

Everything about [The Heavens] was related to the Supreme Yin. Although it bore no resemblance to the Moonlight Origin Mansion's [Donghua Heaven] mentioned in the records, there was no way the two weren't connected!

If this "Immortal Official Li" had been ordered to reincarnate under his original surname, Chi Buzi's first reaction was that it had to be Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun!

Daoist Master Donghua just fit too well... possessing transcendent Dharma Art techniques, astonishing sword intent and cultivation, *and* operating under the name of the Moonlight Origin Mansion. How deep did these waters run? Although the Chi family had experienced it firsthand, Chi Buzi hadn't received the details due to the prohibition on recording Golden Core matters. But he wasn't stupid enough to go probing into the reasons!

He brushed the other man off with a single sentence. Dangjiang, meanwhile, lifted his chin, speaking proudly.

"First, I'll take you to meet my current superior, the fairy who holds the position of Lesser Yin Wu-Gui. Try to suppress that stench of mortal dust on you. Don't pollute her immortal aura."

Chi Buzi was eager to meet more people. He followed Dangjiang to the front of the courtyard. Dangjiang took the token from his sleeve and placed it in Chi Buzi's hand.

"You don't have immortal registry, so you must hold this token. There are many important figures on the path. Don't look around carelessly."

This surprised Chi Buzi. Logically, since Yingze hadn't appeared in so many years—even ignoring the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven of the Green Pine Temple —there should be *fewer* great cultivators here. Otherwise, they wouldn't have dispatched an idiot like Dangjiang to receive him.

He hesitated briefly but ultimately followed him out of the courtyard. Sure enough, the woman in the tea-white iridescent robes was waiting outside, holding her pipa, the stark white circular marking on her brow. She was looking right at them.

"Greetings, Lord of Lesser Yin Wu-Gui!"

Chi Buzi bowed, immediately assessing her.

'A great cultivator of Lesser Yin. She also possesses a Divine Ability... she must be at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm...'

Before him, however, Shaohui froze, a doubt rising in her mind.

'How strange... why do I find him more and more disagreeable the longer I look at him? His appearance isn't that repulsive...'

She showed no sign of this outwardly. With a single glance, she turned and walked away. Dangjiang hurried to follow. Chi Buzi walked at the very back. Although two rows of celestial soldiers lined the path, solemn and imposing, the man in green didn't spare them a second glance, focusing instead on the other cultivators.

'No matter how solemn or imposing the guards are, they could just be puppets, or some kind of divine ability...'

As he walked, many cultivators paused to watch them. A few with higher status even greeted Shaohui. Chi Buzi swept them with a faint gaze, thinking:

'The idiot is just puffing himself up to look important... not a single person acknowledged him...'

The group arrived at a high platform, pristine jade-green and bright, inscribed with bright moon patterns. Frosty snow drifted down, encircled by spiritual water. They waited on the platform for a moment before a handsome Immortal General in silver armor zipped over. Shaohui smiled.

"Daoist Friend Zhengao!"

Zhengao looked over and nodded in reply.

"Shaohui, you've come."

The two exchanged brief pleasantries. Shaohui was clearly not one for fawning, so she quickly changed the subject.

"Daoist Friend, you placed Dangjiang in my hands back then. I have a few small matters to consult you about. Firstly, to fulfill my duty as his superior, and secondly, it concerns the affairs of the Supreme Yin..."

Zhengao nodded with a smile, his gaze sweeping lightly over the two of them. He listened as Shaohui finished explaining. The celestial attendant of the Lesser Yin Wu-Gui position then shook out her tea-white robes and cupped her hands.

"I ask the Immortal General to handle the matter. It is not appropriate for Shaohui to remain here."

She retreated gracefully. Dangjiang waited below. Although he had met Zhengao before, those had been private meetings, nothing like the solemn dignity of today. He felt a secret fear growing in his heart.

Chi Buzi, standing to the side, was much calmer. However, the status associated with this place had repeatedly shattered his expectations, and now his own Golden Core Dao path was involved. He couldn't help but feel a flicker of anxiety. Watching Dangjiang standing frozen in front like a turtle pulling its head into its shell, he felt a massive headache coming on.

'That idiot...'
