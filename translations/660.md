# Chapter 660: Seventh Cloud

Dongfang Heyun maintained his usual elegant and dignified appearance. This first wisp of cloud energy expelled when the Dragon Monarch achieved his divine position often acted in unexpected ways, harboring an obsession with his own appearance and being extremely particular about propriety. He stood respectfully at a measured distance, smiling warmly.

"Fellow Daoist, you have truly made remarkable progress. When I first met you, a single spell required several breaths to complete. Now I see you accomplish the same in but a single thought."

"Senior flatters me!"

Li Xizhi replied respectfully. Dongfang Heyun flicked his sleeves and stepped forward, approaching the Dawn Rayfish in just a few strides. He lifted it with one hand, turning it over to reveal the creature's bloodied belly, its eyes still wide and watchful.

Dongfang Heyun bowed slightly, speaking in gentle tones.

"This beast came from the north, crashing into Converging Water Sea's Forge Mountain`1. Several dragons were playing in the waters, chasing and frolicking about. I happened to be passing by when it fell into my hands."

"You contributed to the Touba Chongyuan affair and were injured in the process. I brought this along as compensation."

He chuckled softly before continuing.

"After circling around, I discovered you were here..."

Dongfang Heyun paused, and Li Xizhi quickly demurred.

"This junior merely fulfilled his assigned duties to the best of his ability, doing nothing more than preserving his own life. It was Senior's assistance that resolved many future troubles for me."

Dongfang Heyun shook his head, pacing closer as he spoke.

"Simply accept it."

His voice gradually lowered, a flicker of confusion crossing his features. He took two steps in place before speaking softly.

"I have something I must ask you, Fellow Daoist."

"Please speak freely, Senior!"

Li Xizhi responded immediately. Dongfang Heyun spoke in measured tones.

"Within this Earth Abyss, two energies and one radiance—malevolent energy, Radiant Essence, and Lesser Yang light—permeate everything. They invade the physical body and course through the meridians. Ordinary people cannot resolve such influences. Even those monks from the north cannot remain here for extended periods."

He paused, his eyes slowly meeting Li Xizhi's gaze as he spoke quietly.

"Yet Fellow Daoist Xizhi seems entirely unaffected?"

Li Xizhi understood his question halfway through and felt alarm bells ringing in his mind.

Li Xizhi knew that Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were monitoring his family, but the Earth Abyss was formed from the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch's transformation. At most, those in the Purple Mansion Realm could calculate his general location but couldn't observe specific details, nor would they necessarily watch him constantly.

Despite all his calculations, he never anticipated Dongfang Heyun would be waiting for him here. Waiting would have been one thing, but the fact that he had observed from nearby for quite some time and noticed Li Xizhi showed no adverse effects had exposed his unusual nature.

'How can I explain this... A cultivation method? Secret technique? Spiritual treasure?'

His mind raced for an instant before he replied in low tones.

"Replying to Senior, the rainbow light of my immortal foundation within my energy sea possesses the ability to neutralize malevolent energies that enter the body. Though it has limited effectiveness against the two energies and one radiance of this place, it can provide some relief."

"Additionally, there is a nearby cavern free from radiance and malevolent energy intrusion. This junior often takes shelter there to purify his spiritual qi, thus managing to survive."

Li Xizhi delivered his explanation in one fluid breath, his tone steady and respectful. Dongfang Heyun listened carefully, remaining silent for a moment.

Though immortal foundations each possessed unique effects, their specific details often varied considerably. Li Xizhi could only attribute his resistance vaguely to his foundation, his heart gradually growing heavy with worry.

Dongfang Heyun remained quiet for quite some time before laughing and responding.

"If you put it that way, Fellow Daoist Xizhi, it's because that master of Mount Luoxia gathered the northern dao lineages, embracing all with inclusive acceptance and preserving most of the northern immortal dao. Thus, the Radiant Glow Dao developed the ability to neutralize other dao methods."

Dongfang Heyun always spoke with natural elegance. Li Xizhi couldn't discern his true intentions or even tell whether he was being sarcastic or seriously elaborating. He could only respond quietly.

"This junior has learned much."

His response was deliberately ambiguous, acceptable whether interpreted positively or negatively. Dongfang Heyun chuckled twice, pressing two fingers together and pointing them at the Dawn Rayfish's head before flicking outward.

Within the dense radiance and malevolent energy, layers of mist suddenly appeared, with several blurred light shadows weaving through them. After Dongfang Heyun recited just a few incantations, he produced something glimmering bright, simply saying.

"Keep this safe!"

This was naturally the creature's spiritual essence. As a spiritual demon himself, Dongfang Heyun found extracting spiritual essence quite effortless. He required no spiritual artifacts or formations, simply drawing it out with ease and transferring it to another's hands—something likely beyond Foundation Establishment Realm capabilities.

Li Xizhi observed everything carefully, raising his estimation of the man's strength another notch as he accepted the essence into his brow center. Dongfang Heyun looked back at the Dawn Rayfish with a smile.

"Do you understand? Just follow him properly. I know you possess many techniques and your spiritual essence may not necessarily be easily bound, but if you don't serve well, the Dragon Monarch won't lack for rayfish delicacies."

The Dawn Rayfish nodded, turning its body over. Its voice rang clear as it replied.

"This little demon understands."

Dongfang Heyun straightened his sleeves and bowed politely before looking toward Li Xizhi with a smile.

"If the opportunity arises, please give my regards to Fellow Daoist Qinghong. I await her in the grotto heaven."

Li Xizhi's eyebrows shot up suddenly. Just as he was about to speak, Dongfang Heyun had already vanished from sight, leaving only scattered cloud fragments that dispersed cleanly in the bright Lesser Yang light.

The moment Dongfang Heyun disappeared, the Dawn Rayfish that had been playing dead immediately leaped up, transforming into a youth in colorful feathered robes. His face was small and slightly round, with clear, bright eyes and fine orange plumage at his temples. He called out in ringing tones.

"Seventh greets his lord!"

Li Xizhi's mind was heavy with concerns, feeling no joy at gaining a Foundation Establishment Realm Dawn Rayfish subordinate. He nodded silently and spoke gently.

"You're injured. Don't linger too long in this place. Come with me quickly to that area free from malevolent energy and radiance to rest and heal your wounds properly."

"Yes."

The youth followed behind him, circulating his radiant spiritual qi throughout his body to resist the penetrating light and malevolent energy. Li Xizhi's face remained calm, but his heart churned like turbulent waves, filled with worry and apprehension.

'Dongfang Heyun was teaching me... that explanation was quite reasonable, but what exactly is he thinking?'

He flew through the earth channels, his thoughts swirling.

Even now, Li Xizhi couldn't clearly discern Dongfang Heyun's exact status among the dragon clan. He could only continue flying silently, composing his emotions before landing back at his cave dwelling.

"Young Master."

Li Wushao was clearly somewhat surprised but didn't ask many questions, simply offering a greeting. Li Xizhi nodded, seating the colorfully dressed youth and providing him with healing pills before speaking softly.

"It's inconvenient to speak freely outside. This place is more secure. How serious are your injuries? If they're manageable, tell us about your background."

The youth nodded and replied respectfully.

"This subordinate was born in the North Sea, originally gathering radiance and absorbing energy with many brothers. We encountered the great upheaval of the heavenly breach and falling waters, gaining the opportunity to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Our clan was already sparse to begin with, and breaking through to Foundation Establishment was typically a one-in-ten-thousand chance. Unexpectedly, when heaven released its great waters, we broke through by following the momentum. After circling the waterspout in the sky once, most of us were captured, with only nine brothers successfully achieving Foundation Establishment."

"This subordinate is the seventh."

Li Xizhi nodded lightly. This matched his expectations quite well. To produce such Dawn Rayfish, nine times out of ten it was indeed due to that heavenly breach. The Dawn Rayfish continued.

"After our breakthrough, we scattered in all directions—east, south, west, and north. I wandered the Eastern Sea for two years before hearing that my eldest brother had become the spiritual beast of Sword Immortal Kufu. Wishing to seek him out, I journeyed all the way to the North Sea."

"Who knew I'd reveal my whereabouts at the North Sea's edge? After chasing and fleeing, running east and west throughout my journey, everyone I encountered would pursue me for hundreds of miles. Finally, I fell into the hands of the dragon clan... leading to today."

Li Xizhi nodded gently and asked.

"A North Sea Sword Immortal?"

"Precisely."

The Dawn Rayfish replied respectfully.

"My lord should have been in this area for some time. Over half a year ago, news came that North Sea's Kufu achieved enlightenment at the Jade Sea's Feather Dissolution Ground, thus gaining sword intent. The North Sea shook, and his fame spread across all four seas!"

Li Xizhi felt somewhat moved, nodding silently as he spoke softly.

"Sword intent... no wonder. What cultivation level is this Sword Immortal?"

"That I don't know..."

The youth shook his head gently, his orange plumage trembling slightly with the movement as he replied respectfully.

"I fear it won't be too high. When those dragon beasts brought me before Lord Heyun, we discussed this matter. They said that nowadays, those who comprehend sword intent are almost all before the Purple Mansion Realm, before divine abilities... I wonder what secrets lie within this."

Li Xizhi nodded lightly. His own ancestor had indeed comprehended sword intent during the Foundation Establishment Realm. He pondered silently.

'Since True Monarch Shangyuan achieved the dao, there should still be three Sword Immortals in Jiangnan, though none show themselves now. Excluding that one from Ten Thousand Radiance Sword Gate`1, the others are in Wu State. Among all the world's Sword Immortals, there probably aren't enough to count on ten fingers.'

He helped the youth to his feet, examined him carefully, and inquired thoroughly. This Dawn Rayfish's cultivation had only just reached the middle Foundation Establishment stage, but his speed was terrifyingly fast. If he exerted full effort, he could probably match a Dawn Cloudliner.

Li Xizhi spoke amiably.

"Since you're the seventh and were sent by Senior, you shall be called Li Qiyun. From now on, we're all family—no need for excessive courtesy."

"This subordinate obeys!"

Li Qiyun bowed in acceptance, quickly producing healing pills to treat his injuries in silence. Li Xizhi sat cross-legged beside the pool in the cave dwelling, quietly staring at the water's surface.

Li Wushao didn't know how this youth had appeared but didn't ask questions, silently closing his eyes to heal. Li Xizhi furrowed his brow.

'At least Dongfang Heyun had no intention of exposing me... Those in the Purple Mansion Realm cannot detect the mysteries of talisman energy. He still wants to use me, probably thinking it's some Purple Mansion Realm master's technique...'

After waiting a moment, Li Wushao asked.

"Young Master, will you be going out again?"

Li Xizhi smiled faintly. Though he felt no fear of the radiance and malevolent energy outside, he still needed to maintain the lie he'd just constructed. He replied.

"I'm feeling somewhat overwhelmed. Let me first neutralize the radiance and malevolent energy within my body and rest for a while before deciding."

The cave immediately fell quiet as everyone focused on cultivation, while the radiance and malevolent energy in the earth channels grew increasingly dense.

Thick radiance and malevolent energy coursed through the earth channels, flickering bright and dim. An elegant youth sat quietly upon a crimson boulder, one pristine hand resting on the other side, gently tapping.

If Li Xizhi were here, he would naturally recognize this person as Dongfang Heyun, who had not departed but remained lingering in this place.

"Such upheaval... West Yan`1 must be fighting someone."

Dongfang Heyun's eyes had lost their playful concealment, appearing more profound and seemingly caught in some dilemma.

"The Dawn Rayfish matter went unnoticed... delivering it to Li Xizhi was perfect timing, sparing this chess piece infiltrating Azure Pond Sect from suffering losses while thinking I only use him."

"It's just that he harbors quite a few secrets... can 'Universal Dawn Mist' truly neutralize radiance and malevolent energy?"

Dongfang Heyun was quite advanced in years. Though this type of spiritual demon maintained a youthful mentality, he had witnessed enough events and studied enough cultivation methods to rival an immortal sect's entire dao repository.

"Azure Pond Sect's 'Universal Dawn Mist'—Lingu Xia practiced it in his time, and it had no neutralizing effects... but Li Xizhi's ancestors were the Wei Li clan, masters of absorbing light and capturing flame. Neutralizing radiance and malevolent energy seems reasonable enough..."

He hesitated for a while. Indeed, he hadn't detected any signs of Li Xizhi using spiritual medicines or techniques—merely sitting cross-legged in meditation. That nagging suspicion finally began to recede. After waiting some time without seeing Li Xizhi emerge, he finally rose and headed deeper into the earth channels, lost in thought.

"Yingze spared Kuaili rather than killing him. Though Lesser Yang is difficult to judge for good or evil, Yingze is no pedantic fool. There must be other considerations."

Dongfang Heyun's figure gradually faded as the thunder above the sea grew louder.

...

Pingya Island.

Li Zhouwei entered the great hall as Chen Yang led three people from a side chamber—two women and one man. The leading woman wore white robes, her expression serene and bearing elegant, clearly indicating noble birth. She spoke softly.

"Jiangbei Shen clan's Shen Yanqing greets the family head."

Shen Yanqing was Daoist Master Zipei's disciple and a legitimate daughter of the Shen family. Her noble status went without saying, and her conduct was quite proper as she nodded toward Li Zhouwei.

The second woman wore yellow feathered robes and was somewhat petite, glancing around with a smile.

"Purple Smoke Gate's Wei Danying greets the family head."

The final man silently bowed, appearing to be a guard of sorts, lowering his head without a word. Li Zhouwei treated the group with reasonable courtesy, speaking gently.

"With distinguished guests gracing us, I failed to welcome you from afar—this is our family's oversight."

After exchanging pleasantries, Shen Yanqing took a seat nearby, offered some compliments, then spoke softly.

"Might I ask where Senior Qinghong is?"

Shen Yanqing had mentioned visiting the Li family long ago, but the northern and southern conflicts had erupted, with fierce battles raging along the river for a long time. Li Zhouwei knew she had come to see Li Qinghong and replied.

"I've already sent someone to request her presence. If Grand-aunt isn't in death-door seclusion, she'll arrive shortly."

Shen Yanqing nodded slightly, chatting about other matters while thinking to herself.

'With Eastern Sea affairs drawing closer, Senior shouldn't be in death-door seclusion.'

She sought conversation topics, speaking softly.

"I originally planned to come with my father to meet your noble clan, but unfortunately, he entered seclusion some days ago to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm and couldn't make the journey."

After chatting briefly, Shen Yanqing noticed that Wei Danying from Purple Smoke Gate beside her hadn't spoken a word and quickly turned to look. Wei Danying was staring straight ahead with a rather complex expression.

'This...'

She discreetly nudged the girl. Wei Danying finally snapped back to attention, lowering her gaze to the tea on the table.

Wei Danying tightened her sleeves, awakening as if from a dream as she pulled her gaze away from the youth at the head seat. Only then did a belated sense of fear arise in her heart.

'Ordinary men must expend considerable effort to attract women... yet he requires no effort at all. He can captivate women with merely a glance. At such a young age, where did he learn this intoxicating demeanor?'

She steadied her mind and looked at the youth again, finding that captivating quality had completely vanished. Breathing a sigh of relief, she sipped her tea, but in that dazed moment, something vicious and aggressively pressing emerged. Wei Danying broke out in cold sweat, terror filling her heart.

'How terrifying! That such a person exists in this world!'
