# Chapter 1260: A Similar View

Mount Liangchuan.

The mountain range of Liangchuan rose and fell, majestic and sprawling. It was located west of the Central Plains; one could see it upon leaving Mianchi.

In ancient times there was a place called Qu Nao Mountain, which originally stretched into the land of Jin, deep into the north, a true natural barrier. That year, the She Immortals verified the Dao in this place, and Qu Nao Mountain collapsed overnight, plummeting thousands of feet. This opened up transportation between the southern prefectures of Jin and the Central Plains, leaving only a small tail end of the mountain range. This was the location of the Liang Xiang Terrace, left behind by the Left Wall True Monarch. Thus, it was preserved and became the location of present-day Mount Liangchuan.

But as time passed, the Liang Xiang Terrace eventually vanished. The place gradually lost its reputation among the great powers of the world and fell into the hands of a Great Zhao general, Ju Huanyin. His son entered the mountain to cultivate the Dao and was illustrious for a time.

'Now, it too has come to nothing!'

The great formation was already operating at its peak, multicolored light seething. Atop a high platform, several cultivators stood guard under the night sky, gazing south into the distance. The faint red that had flickered on the horizon had already faded, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

The man in the lead frowned, his gaze fixed on the distance. He appeared deeply worried and said:

"Xiangxiang is under attack. I fear the south has instigated conflict!"

"Can you identify what kind of divine ability it is?"

The green-robed man beside him had a grim expression and seemed extremely anxious. He paced back and forth on the platform, asking his question in a rush. On the other side, a man wiped his eyes, seemingly circulating a spell art. After looking for a good while, he said:

"There is yin qi and killing intent, as well as flying sand. It is difficult to identify."

The green-robed man grew even more anxious.

"Lord Ju! My elder brother is still in seclusion, what are we to do!"

As he spoke, the men to his left and right fell silent. The man in the lead immediately turned to placate him.

"Brother Wei, please be calm. The flames of war will be extinguished as soon as they ignite. I fear this is merely a probe—the unending divine abilities to the east, however, that is the enemy's main force!"

This man, surnamed Ju, held extremely high prestige. As soon as he spoke, the other two showed expressions of agreement and admiration. The green-robed man, however, could not set his mind at ease so quickly. He said hurriedly:

"Do the two Daoist Masters have any news? Has the jade talisman on the mountain responded?"

The man surnamed Ju seemed to have known he would ask this and was already prepared. He said:

"Brother Wei has been in seclusion for a long time… Although the three generals are nominally stationed here, the Divine Martial General returned to his fief long ago, and the other two have always been stationed in Xiangxiang. They must have gone to reinforce the east. As for the jade talisman…"

After all, in Luoxia, they were all one big family. The various houses might have had some friction in private, but on the surface, their relations were excellent, often strengthened by marriage. He hesitated for a moment, then decided not to hide anything.

"It has already responded. That is why I activated the great formation, to guard against the enemy chieftain."

He understood why the other man was so worried and said in a low voice:

"Brother Wei, calm yourself. Has there been any word from your clan?"

The green-robed cultivator sighed heavily:

"No news at all!"

With Jia Zan, a Purple Mansion Realm expert, personally presenting the formation, Cui Jueyin and Cheng Qian had slipped into the two families' great formations without a sound. Controlling this group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators was as easy as flipping a palm. Naturally, there was no news!

As they were discussing, a divine ability suddenly flashed outside the formation. A patch of multicolored light descended, transforming into an old man with a half-white beard and hair. His gaze was grim and dangerous, and his divine ability carried a wave of sound that blasted into the formation!

"Open the formation at once!"

'Daoist Master Jia!'

If his elder brother Wei Dangshan was the future of the Jia and Wei families, then Jia Zan was their current pillar of support. Seeing him was like taking a calming pill for the green-robed cultivator. He was instantly overjoyed, yet he did not know why the Daoist Master had come to such a distant place. His heart seized with urgency, and he could only shout in a flurry:

"Open the formation!"

But he had only taken half a step before the Ju-surnamed cultivator beside him grabbed him. This middle-aged man was much calmer than he was, his face a mask of shock and uncertainty.

"Why is Daoist Master Jia here?"

"There is nowhere a divine ability cannot go!"

The green-robed cultivator kept trying to pull him along. The surrounding cultivators were also in a panic. The middle-aged man was both shocked and suspicious, his voice urgent.

"Brother Wei, wait! Behind Mount Liangchuan is Yinling, and the Tao clan has three divine ability cultivators there. The enemy only flickered in the south for a moment. Even if Xiangxiang fell instantly, the army would only be at Yinling's border. Why would he need to come here!"

The green-robed man was already deeply displeased at being pulled back. Hearing the doubt for his family's Daoist Master in the man's words, he erupted in fury, roaring:

"Ju Liangwang! What audacity!"

The roar shook everyone on the platform, and they all looked over amidst the chaos. Before Ju Liangwang could react, the figure outside the formation seemed to grow suspicious and muttered in a low voice:
"Hm?"

A divine ability cultivator was a divine ability cultivator, no matter the circumstances. To put it bluntly, with just that slight change in tone, the legs of most people within the great formation had gone soft. Anxious gazes shot toward Ju Liangwang.

Ju Liangwang, however, forcefully held on to the Wei clansman beside him, pressing his hand on the formation platform. He said in a low voice:

"The south is in chaos. The Daoist Master's divine ability is profound, and we juniors cannot distinguish true from false. I only fear we may fall for the enemy's cunning transformations. I must ask the Daoist Master to show…"

"Hmph!"

Jia Zan had never thought someone would dare to block him, but he recognized the man from his voice:

'Ju Liangwang… so he's Yu Xi's grandson-in-law… No wonder he dares to stop me!'

He no longer found it strange. He only felt the gaze from behind him like a sharp sword pressed against his spine, ready to run him through at any moment. He gritted his teeth and shouted:

"Wei Kanjiang! What do you think you're doing!"

The words exploded over the mountain like thunder, the tone utterly familiar. The green-robed cultivator shuddered, then turned and clamped down on Ju Liangwang's hand. His eyes looked as if they might split from rage.

"Ju Liangwang… are you mad! Who could possibly bypass the Tao clan to get in! And how would a divine ability cultivator from the south know my name!"

Before he finished speaking, the young man who had used the eye technique also stepped forward, eagerly chiming in from the side:

"Family Head, outside is the Pheasant Li March… it is the Jia family's technique…"

The other two men also came forward to persuade him, their faces filled with fear. Ju Liangwang was momentarily speechless, his expression wavering. The jade talisman in his sleeve flashed continuously, slowly growing warm. This made him remain stubborn and unmoving. In a low voice, he said:

"The jade talisman is lit! General Jiang will arrive momentarily. I must ask Daoist Master Jia to wait. If there has been a mistake, I will personally apologize to the lord!"

These words sent a chill down Jia Zan's spine.

'General Jiang?! Which General Jiang!'

'Jiang Fuwang? He came here? Or could it be… Jiang Yan!'

But Jia Zan had no time to think. Regardless of which General Jiang it was, who would believe the sight of him and Li Zhouwei arriving from afar in this state? It wasn't as if he, Jia Zan, was escorting Li Zhouwei to Mount Liangchuan as a prisoner!

His voice turned icy, filled with boundless killing intent:

"Liangwang! Li Zhouwei has already breached Xiangxiang and grievously wounded the two generals. He pursued me all the way here. The Tao clan is colluding with the south, sitting on the mountain to watch the tigers fight, cough cough…"

"If you do not let me in, the situation in Luoxia will be ruined at your hands!"

An uproar erupted on the high platform. Wei Kanjiang's face changed completely. Without a moment's hesitation, he channeled a spell art and struck Ju Liangwang. The middle-aged man was still in shock, never imagining someone beside him would attack so suddenly. He instantly coughed up a mouthful of blood as Wei Kanjiang took his position and pushed the formation node!

In that brief moment of laxity, the Great Void connected. The vision of the divine ability outside the great formation vanished. Ju Liangwang scrambled to his feet. He first looked carefully, confirming that it was indeed the Daoist Master of the Jia clan, before bowing down once more, not daring to lift his head.

"This lowly one is guilty!"

But the high platform was deathly quiet. The old man's gaze was somber, and he ignored everyone present. Instead, he flicked a sleeve, took the great formation's command token from Ju Liangwang's body, and strode forward. He pressed his divine ability onto the high platform, and a crimson light instantly enveloped it!

A bang echoed across the sky as a faint, brownish-yellow light gave chase. All the cultivators looked up. A flash of delight appeared in Ju Liangwang's eyes:

"Lord Jiang has arrived!"

It was Jiang Fuwang!

Jia Zan also raised his head, his eyes filled with a mixture of awe and complexity.

"So that's how it is!"

'Jiang Fuwang…'

This General Jiang had been injured by Li Zhouwei and had not received aid from the Tao clan. After finally managing to escape, his first reaction was not to flee to another prefecture or to reinforce another front—it was to rush north, to seize Mount Liangchuan first!

'He, Jiang Fuwang, is a great general seasoned by years of war. How could he not see the situation? When reinforcements didn't arrive, and seeing Li Zhouwei advance toward Yinling openly, his flames burning bright, he understood that the Tao clan had long been discontent with the other families and must have secretly surrendered to the Song!'

But even if he was wounded, even if the Tao clan had colluded with the south, as long as he could hold this position and wait for aid, the Great Song would absolutely not be able to conquer it quickly. Luoxia would retain a chance of being reclaimed!

So Jiang Fuwang had secretly traveled through the Great Void, bypassing Yinling, to come and defend Mount Liangchuan.

It was no exaggeration to say that this move by the Jiang clan's direct descendant showed great strategic vision, decisiveness, and courage. His perspective was much the same as Li Zhouwei's; he had understood from the very beginning where the initiative in the great battle for Luoxia lay!

'From beginning to end, the gazes of this King Wei and Jiang Fuwang… were fixed on the very same place!'

But Luoxia was rich and the Great Void was treacherous. Jiang Fuwang traveled through the Great Void, while Li Zhouwei openly crossed Yinling, walking the mortal world!

This not only drove a wedge between Jiang Fuwang and the Tao clan but also put Li Zhouwei in an invincible position—the heavily wounded Jiang Fuwang could never travel openly through the mortal world. Li Zhouwei was bound to reach Mount Liangchuan long before him!

'An open ploy…'

In that instant, Ju Liangwang found he had lost control of his body. Every cultivator on the platform was frozen, forced to watch as Mount Liangchuan's Spirit Formation of Profound Mist and Abundant Water activated at high speed. A sapphire-blue light shot out, stopping a speck of light in midair!

"Pfft!"

Mount Liangchuan's great formation was formidable indeed. The rapidly approaching light was caught off guard and interrupted. The faint sound of someone spitting blood could be heard as a man's figure tumbled out. His form flickered for just an instant in the mortal world, erupting in a bloody light, before he unhesitatingly changed direction and sped away to the east!

In a flash, the high platform fell silent. The light in Ju Liangwang's eyes dimmed, his face a ghastly mix of blue and white. A breath caught in his chest, and with a final sliver of hope, he said:

"Daoist Master Jia…"

Jia Zan's steps were heavy. He paid the man no heed, let alone turned around. The Daoist Master took a step back and bowed deeply.

"King Wei…"

The moment the words "King Wei" were spoken, Wei Kanjiang's expression also changed. Under the stunned gazes of the cultivators, a young man in black robes slowly materialized on the platform. The qilin markings on his face were gradually fading as he looked at them quietly.

To everyone's surprise, when Jia Zan made his bow, his voice was sincere:

"Many thanks, King Wei!"

That was right.

Could a single beam of light from a spirit formation truly harm Jiang Fuwang? Even if he was severely injured, he could not be taken down by a mere beam of light. Jia Zan's action was no longer meant to harm him, but to warn him!

Once Jiang Fuwang drew near and entered the formation, he would be facing Li Zhouwei, who was lying in wait!

'That is the true, mortal danger!'

And as for Jia Zan, after utterly disgracing his family, he would be scorned by all the great houses, and on top of that, he would have offended the entire Jiang clan of Gu Prefecture and Jiang Yan, who was on the verge of becoming a Great Daoist Master!

'One may surrender, but there must be a line one does not cross!'

He, Jia Zan, could be shameless. He could surrender in the face of such an overwhelming tide; the families of Luoxia and Gu Prefecture would understand. Objectively speaking, which family in Luoxia would not surrender? It was merely a question of when and how gracefully… To put it bluntly, for years, the great families had always surrendered to whichever dynasty came knocking!

But to surrender, to trick them into opening the formation, and then to be stained with the reputation of luring Jiang Fuwang to his death—that was going too far!

That was why Jia Zan had been so anxious.

Now, at least the Jia clan had retained some dignity. Jia Zan, prostrated on the ground, was truly covered in a cold sweat, his mind in a daze.

'How many years has it been? The days in Luoxia were prosperous and carefree. How many years has it been since I was in such a predicament? No wonder the south sees divine ability cultivators rise and fall every year. In a situation like this, what family could avoid such abrupt changes in fortune!'

Those golden eyes held a smile as they swept over him.

Li Zhouwei had no intention of killing Jiang Fuwang either.

He had never forgotten his purpose in coming here, and he knew his goal was to win a swift victory and seize the greatest benefit—he, Li Zhouwei, had to return to his seclusion. Capturing these strategic passes was to ensure the Great Song could hold this territory with minimal casualties!

Both Lu Fu and Jiang Fuwang were connected to the great families of Gu Prefecture, who were outside the current conflict. Killing them now would be satisfying, but once he returned to the lake, who would be able to handle the situation in Luoxia?

'Besides, I cannot waste my time here… I might as well use this opportunity to temporarily win this man over…'

He said quietly:

"Que'wan!"

As he spoke, a figure appeared beside him like a phantom. Li Que'wan stepped forward. Mansion Water rippled around her, and a sinister old demon materialized, its eyes scanning the crowd intently.

Jia Zan no longer had the energy to ponder how these two had been following him. He had suffered too many shocks and could only remain silent. Seeing her cold expression, she performed a quick hand seal and pointed at the formation platform. Jia Zan immediately took the hint, released his divine ability, and stepped back.

Seeing Li Que'wan take control of Mount Liangchuan, the King of Wei finally rose. The night had grown deeper. He glanced at the Daoist Master kneeling on the ground and said softly:

"Dignity… this king has given it to Daoist Master Jia. If you disappoint me, you will pay with your life."

"This subordinate understands!"

Jia Zan bowed deeply and did not rise for a long time. The man before him had already vanished. He heard only a woman's gentle voice:

"I am not familiar with this place, but Mount Liangchuan is crucial—I will need Senior Jia's guidance!"

"I would not dare!"

Jia Zan rose and finally turned around. The few Foundation Establishment cultivators behind him cowered with their heads down, not daring to look at him. Only Ju Liangwang stared blankly, looking at Jia Zan in utter disbelief.

The longsword in his hand rested limply on the ground. He tried several times to raise his hand but was forced back by the Daoist Master's gaze. Jia Zan said coldly:

"The day the formation is broken will be the day you and I die, and our families are scattered."

Ju Liangwang was a clever man; he understood the Daoist Master's meaning. He finally let out a long, low sigh and fell to his knees.

"Since Mount Liangchuan has surrendered quietly, Mianchi will be unaware. If General Jiang retreats, he will certainly go to Mianchi for aid. If the Daoist Master can intercept him in Huan Prefecture, you could gain several days of strategic advantage!"

Jia Zan's expression was uncertain. He stood with his hands behind his back and said in a low voice,

"He has learned his lesson. He will not be so easy to deal with now!"

Li Que'wan listened quietly, her hand behind her back lightly performing a divination. Though her face remained impassive, a flicker of doubt arose in her heart,

'Jiang Fuwang… he seems to be shrouded by something. I cannot divine his fate…'

…

The Imperial Capital of Great Zhao.

The night was deep, and the caws of cold crows were sharp and mournful. The palace felt cold and desolate. Pale golden pavilions glimmered faintly. Deep within the palace, lanterns still flickered, and waves of music could be heard.

Through the bright lights, one could vaguely make out the dancing calligraphy on a high plaque, as if etched in gold and iron:

Hall of Pacification.

This hall had been built under the personal supervision of Emperor Zhaowu of Zhao, situated next to the Palace of Utmost Merit. In those days, he had conferred with his generals here on matters of conquest, and it had been a place of great glory. After the emperor's fall, it became a place of confinement for a deposed emperor and the Ritual Sect. For generations thereafter, the emperors of Zhao indulged in revelry within this palace, and it became a place of song and dance instead.

Misty clouds drifted and immortal songs played. On the golden throne at the head of the hall, a middle-aged man was slumped.

The man's features could be considered bold, but his eyes were glazed over, his expression frivolous. The limp way he was sprawled made him seem debauched. His majestic robes had been cast aside, and he wore only a single layer of white, sitting in the seat of honor.

This was the current emperor of Zhao, Fuqi Wan.

Since the fall of Emperor Zhaowu, Great Zhao had long lost its imperial authority. The Three Departments of Great Zhao had been dissolved and imperial power had crumbled. The Metallic Essence of the Body of Kui, which had been placed on the main beam of the Palace of Utmost Merit, was personally offered by the puppet Zhao Ritual Sect to Yuan Shi of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. This led to the creation of the Golden Body Thunder Sound Flawless Dharma Idol.

That Dharma Master had gone to live in the Chandana Forest, leaving generations of Zhao emperors behind in this empty box, silently watching the song and dance before them.

Just like him, Fuqi Wan.

The emperor watched everything before him with drunken, hazy eyes.

'They always say Emperor Gong of Wei was pitiful, but it would have been a mercy to die like that. At least when people speak of the Great Wei and its emperor, there is awe, prestige, or even hatred.'

'Not laughter.'

As his consciousness drifted, the fierce clang of armor rang out, powerful and crisp. An armored general strode into the hall, causing the court ladies to stumble and fall in a panic. The hall was thrown into chaos.

Fuqi Wan remained drunkenly passed out on his throne.

Xiangli Heng strode coldly through the spilled wine, walking straight to the main seat. He gave a perfunctory cupping of his hands and said:

"Your Majesty, the ministers request your presence!"

Fuqi Wan's snores were like thunder.

Xiangli Heng was not surprised. He reached out, picked up the golden goblet beside the throne, and casually splashed its contents onto Fuqi Wan's face. He said coldly:

"Your Majesty."

Fuqi Wan jolted awake. He looked around in confusion as an iron hand gripped his back and lifted him like a chick.

Xiangli Heng was merely at the Foundation Establishment Realm, whereas the emperor of Great Zhao, Fuqi Wan himself—was only at Qi Refining.

It was truly laughable. When Fuqi Wan was the crown prince, he had completed six rounds of cultivation by the age of twelve, yet no one remembered this prince. It dragged on until he was sixteen, when he cried before his father, Emperor Ai of Zhao, Fuqi Quan. Only then did his drunken father remember the matter. He found a guard and had the man grudgingly produce a wisp of spiritual qi.

This was his Fuqi family—emperors under the heel of Buddhist cultivators.

Xiangli Heng hauled him up and threw him to the floor. Only then did the emperor hear the general's cold voice:

"Your Majesty! You are keeping the Purple Mansion Realm experts waiting."

"Isn't it not yet time for morning court…"

Fuqi Wan drunkenly pulled on his robes and staggered outside. The light at the entrance of the hall was blinding, and he could not help but shake his head.

But it quickly grew dim again; the imperial palace of Great Zhao was always dim. Fuqi Wan leaned limply against the imperial throne behind the curtain, feeling the bone-deep chill seep into him once more. He sat for a long while before suddenly realizing that no one in the grand hall was speaking.

He pried his eyes open and saw a host of monks seated high above, either chanting with their palms pressed together or drinking heavily. Only a few cultivators knelt silently in the hall.

"Your Majesty! The King of Wei… has conquered Xiangxiang!"

The voice echoed through the hall, its tone so polite it might as well have been announcing good news. Fuqi Wan shook his head sluggishly.

"We… do not recall enfeoffing a King of Wei…"

A woman's laugh came from the side. 

Zong Chang said, "Your Majesty, it is the King of Wei from the Great Song!"

Fuqi Wan seemed to sober up slightly.

"Oh… the one Toushou called… the Wei scourge…"

Zong Chang's laughter grew louder.

"Good…"

The monk seated to the side had his expression darken instantly. It seemed he had never expected this ant-like creature to have the capacity to disgust him at such a time. He shot a gloomy look at the curtain, then turned and asked,

"Where are cultivators Jiang and Lu?"

A man below answered:

"Their whereabouts are unknown. Daoist Master Lu Fu… appears to have been suppressed by the King of Wei!"

The words carried immense weight, silencing the hall. Jiang Toushou laughed with fury.

"He had at least two Purple Mansion Realm great formations. Even if he could not win, he could have retreated. He is a descendant of the Lu clan, yet he was suppressed just like that! Truly… a disgrace…"

He was about to say more, but he caught Zong Chang's eye and fell silent. He continued,

"The pseudo-Song has now divided its forces into three prongs to attack various territories. Touba Qiye is already tied down—is there any word from the Lotus Temple?"

The seat belonging to the Way of Joyful Bliss was conspicuously empty. Not only that, but none of the representatives from the other Ways dared to raise their heads.

If the various Buddhist sects had shown great interest in heading south during the Jianghuai conflict, now, after the two great battles at Baixiang Valley and Lake Xian, the Seven Aspects' desire to go south had hit rock bottom… let alone confronting the cultivators from the south!

For Buddhist cultivators, the benefits were few: either convert other cultivators and the common people, or expand the Buddhist Lands. At the very least, they could pick up a few promising disciples to bring back.

But what kind of place was Luoxia!

'To go there and risk our lives for nothing, we can't convert the cultivators, and the people of Luoxia would never be handed over to us. There is no chance to expand the Buddhist Lands… Even if we find a promising disciple, they would belong to one of those great families. Bringing even one back would be harder than ascending to heaven!'

Even the Way of Great Desire, which had always been enthusiastic about southern affairs, now sneered with lowered eyes. Luejin, who had followed Fachang south years ago and felt a certain kinship with Minghui, saw this and immediately spoke up:

"I hear Yehui has taken some men there. The Way of Joyful Bliss suffered heavy losses back then and has yet to recover its strength. I fear they cannot spare the manpower!"

'Nonsense, they are the best at hiding!'

Jiang Toushou was relatively friendly toward him. Seeing him speak up for the Way of Joyful Bliss, he did not bother to say more.

"The matter of Luoxia cannot be ignored. I request your esteemed Way to proceed to Mount Liangchuan first."

Luejin lowered his eyes.

"Since the loss of the Golden Land, our Way has been in an awkward position these past years. I am afraid we cannot spare many people."

Jiang Toushou did not answer him, turning instead to say,

"Zanmen will not fall easily, but the lands beyond it cannot be surrendered. Every family will send forth some people—lest I be forced to choose them myself!"

Zong Chang, seated to the side, said with a touch of malice:

"General Gongsun must certainly go!"

At these words, Gongsun Bei, who had been standing in a corner as if he did not exist, had his expression change drastically. He took a step forward, a look of displeasure in his eyes.

"Fellow Daoist Zong sits here so comfortably, while ordering the rest of us out to face the enemy!"

The Gongsun family had no powerful backer, and Gongsun Bei had always kept a low profile in the Zhao court. Years ago, if Zong Chang had ordered him to battle, he would have gritted his teeth and gone. But now?

'Li Zhouwei killed even Qi Lanyan! I have a long-standing feud with him. If I go out rashly, I will surely lose my life!'

He was ultimately the weaker party. After that single retort to Zong Chang, he immediately turned to Jiang Toushou and said in a low voice:

"I fear it will require a Great Daoist Master to lead the force if we are to stop this beast!"

Without the Profound Governance Pavilion, Jiang Toushou was well aware of how weak the Zhao court's cohesion was. Faced with Gongsun Bei's overture, he nodded repeatedly in agreement.

"Since Touba Qiye is occupied, is there any word from Daoist Master Chiguang? Isn't he cultivating in Mianchi? Ask him to go to Mount Liangchuan!"

"For that, we would still have to ask the Touba clan…"

After asking around the hall, Jiang Toushou felt a chill in his heart.

'The Yang clan's timing is impeccable… With Jiang Yan in seclusion, a surprise attack could find Luoxia completely undefended. Once we lose the initiative, what chance do we have of taking it back…'

'The best we can hope for is to hold Mount Liangchuan!'

His heart grew heavy.

'The Tao clan has been discontent for a long time. If we were prepared, we could have forced them to fight. But now, with the enemy at our gates, I doubt they have the will for a prolonged resistance. But Boye… we cannot lose Boye!'

He understood this point clearly. The Great Song was growing stronger. Xiangxiang bordered both the Song and Shu kingdoms. If they took Boye, they could potentially join forces with Shu. If Boye also fell, the two sides could only coordinate the timing of their future attacks!

He was able to sit in his position because he could see such things. He stood up grimly, his mind finally made up.

"I will take some men and go with you!"

At this, even Zong Chang looked over in surprise. Gongsun Bei, however, let out a long sigh of relief, his face beaming.

"With this, we can surely stop this scoundrel!"

But Jiang Toushou's expression was grim. He swept his gaze one last time over the families in the hall, his eyes lingering on the empty seats of the Compassion and Joyful Bliss houses. He gritted his teeth.

"You think you can hide by not showing up? Wishful thinking. Do you truly take my Mount Dayang for a mere decoration!"

The cultivators below all lowered their heads, unwilling to answer. Jiang Toushou grew even more furious and sneered:

"Just you wait—the day the White Qilin kills your Mahas and tramples your temples, do not blame my Mount Dayang for not doing its part!"

…

Leaving the region of Chengyun, the mountains began to level out. Temples dotted the landscape, surrounded by numerous tenant farms. After passing vast fields, rolling hills came into view, resplendent and magnificent. Twinkling lights shone through a drifting white mist, like a celestial paradise. Three characters were written above:

[Lotus Temple]

This place had always been filled with constant light, its lamps never extinguished. High monks preached the Dao upon stone platforms, and the atmosphere was lively. But as dark clouds loomed on the horizon, this temple, which had been untouched by war for many years, fell into disarray. A sense of unease spread as monks whispered among themselves or focused intently on their chanting.

High above, a tall, thin monk stood with his palms together, gazing gravely into the distance. He watched the dark clouds spread across the sky, his expression one of shock and uncertainty.

Beside him stood a young novice monk, remarkably handsome and with an extraordinary air. He too looked south, his expression hesitant as he occasionally glimpsed Buddhist light piercing through the dark clouds.

The tall, thin monk frowned.

"If Master were not in secluded cultivation, they would never have the chance to be so brazen here!"

The young novice said:

"First Disciple-Brother, calm your anger… I do not think they are coming for us. It is best if Touba Qiye is thrown into a panic…"

"Minghui… you are wrong. It is Mingmeng I am worried about!"

The first disciple of the Lotus Temple, Mingzang, let out a long sigh. His eyes were fixed on the clouds, as if ready to act at any moment.

"His cultivation is still low, and the Exiled Qi is terrifying. If anything were to happen to him, how could I possibly face Master!"

This young novice was none other than Minghui, who had escaped the great war years ago with his life!

The methods of the Way of Joyful Bliss were quite profound. He now had the appearance of one who had been broken and then reforged. But his injuries back then had been too severe, and he still looked very weak. Although his appearance had changed greatly, his furtive demeanor remained the same. Hearing his first disciple-brother's words, he gave a bitter smile in his heart.

'Oh, disciple-brother, even if Master were not in seclusion, he would be just like us, standing here watching… If we were to fly out and run into Li Zhouwei, would we fight or not?'

He tried to persuade him aloud:

"The letter Master left before his seclusion said not to cause trouble. He feared others would use us to interfere with him… First Disciple-Brother, you must not be rash—I believe they are merely testing the waters. Otherwise, why would they send these two female Daoist Masters at the early Purple Mansion Realm?"

Ultimately, these words persuaded Mingzang. His expression was complicated. He could only focus on being ready to provide aid at a moment's notice. Minghui, however, looked around secretively. Just as he was about to speak again, he suddenly sensed something. He made a quick calculation and was startled.

His disciple-brother beside him also turned. A streak of gold had appeared out of thin air before them, gradually coalescing into a talisman with clear patterns and shimmering golden light.

'An order from Mount Dayang!'

Though both of them held those people in contempt, Mount Dayang had been established by the Chandana Forest. It was, nominally, a place revered by all Buddhist cultivators. This command, delivered through the Buddhist Land, could not be easily disobeyed, unless the head of their Way, Liangli, personally gave a counter-order.

The two of them bowed. Golden light began to sprinkle down. Mingzang listened intently for a long while, then frowned.

"Luoxia?!"

Minghui's expression changed even more rapidly. He was horrified—this was an order deploying his disciple-brother, Mingzang, to Luoxia!

Mingzang was no ordinary person! As the first disciple of the Lotus Temple, he had lived through six lifetimes and was preparing to break through to his seventh. As the first disciple, Mount Dayang would not normally deploy him directly and disturb his cultivation. They would have invited him to the mountain for a detailed discussion!

He was aghast.

"They are taking advantage of Master's absence… This is intentional!"

Mingzang's expression was grim, and he did not answer immediately. Minghui's earlier ease vanished in an instant. He knew one thing with even greater certainty:

'Since they are attacking Zhao, the King of Wei must be involved. There is no sign of him here, so he has almost certainly gone to Luoxia!'

If Jinlian had not been in seclusion, there would have been room for negotiation. But just as the north could not have predicted the Great Song would launch its northern expedition at this time, Jinlian could not have imagined Li Zhouwei would attack Luoxia now—he was naturally using this time to perfect his Dharma Body!

Minghui was stunned for a moment. His gaze finally fell upon his disciple-brother, and a bitter feeling welled up inside him.

'Disciple-brother… the lives of everyone in our temple now rest in your hands!'
