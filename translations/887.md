# Chapter 887: Please

Shanghuo County, in the Youxiang Prefecture of the Zhao State.

Bitter winter had arrived, blanketing the world in a vast expanse of white. Youxiang Prefecture had once been under the jurisdiction of the Qinling Temple. However, the temple fell into ruin, leaving the region ungoverned for a time. Eventually, a Great Master Monk returned from the south after attaining his enlightenment and became a Merciful One, finally re-establishing the Qinling Temple.

This Merciful One, Liaokong, had peculiar beliefs. He held that intentionally seeking suffering, without also studying the scriptures, was an ineffective way to accumulate blessings for the next life. Consequently, the people of Shanghuo County no longer worked themselves to exhaustion or died from self-mutilation. Instead, they read scriptures and chanted holy names. This also meant they were spared the winter ritual of bathing in the wind and swallowing snow to prove their piety.

Of course, the number of people in Shanghuo County ascending to paradise had also decreased in recent years. The commoners dared not blame the Buddhist cultivators; they could only assume they themselves were not pious enough. If someone accidentally crushed a finger or broke a leg, they would be ecstatic, believing this unexpected suffering would surely accumulate blessings.

Into this peaceful land, streaks of colorful light suddenly split the sky. Over ten Master Monks descended, riding the wind, flanked by numerous other cultivators. Their leader shouted a stern command:

"He fled here! Find him immediately! Don't let him escape!"

The colorful lights immediately dispersed as the group of Master Monks and cultivators descended, searching everywhere. Though their robes were varied, showing they were clearly not from the same Daoist tradition, they had set aside their differences to corner their quarry.

After a short while, a brilliant golden light erupted with a tremendous roar, followed by an ear-piercing snarl:

"He really is here!"

In an instant, all the colorful lights in the sky converged on one spot. A large, shimmering array materialized out of the empty snowfield. Within it stood a long-bearded man in Jiangbei attire, clutching an array disc.

His expression was grim, his panic barely concealed as he stood rooted within the array. "How could they be so fast? Young Master Lin just entered seclusion..."

But the assembled Master Monks would not let this chance slip. They immediately surrounded the array, and their leader spat with hatred:

"Good... good! You fiend! All along your path, you destroyed mountains, felled temples, and ruined our legacies and monasteries! This is retribution! Fate has allowed us to corner you here!"

"We may not be from major sects, but we will not tolerate such humiliation! Fellow Daoists, attack together!"

Instantly, golden light flashed and white qi surged as all kinds of dharma artifacts hammered the array, creating a deafening boom. The man inside staggered, frantically pouring his dharma power into the disc. But alone, his dharma power was meager. How could he possibly resist the combined assault of more than a dozen cultivators?

'Han Li mentioned this,' the man thought, panic rising. 'This array's strength is its concealment, its ability to be deployed instantly on any terrain... It was never meant for defense!'

Despair washed over him. His name was Wang Changyan, and he hailed from the Wang Clan of Jiangbei. Years ago, his parents had traveled north to gain experience, but they had vanished without a trace.

As Wang Changyan grew, his own talent became apparent, and he was hailed as a local genius of the Wang family. This lasted until Lin Feng swept through Jiangbei. He, along with the rest of his family, had then submitted to Lin Feng's command.

When he heard Lin Feng intended to travel north, he was overjoyed. He had always wanted to search for his parents but lacked the strength to make the perilous journey alone. Now, he had seized the opportunity to follow Lin Feng, serving him faithfully.

But the journey felt cursed. They were constantly ambushed by demonic cultivators and other cultivators alike, all of whom Lin Feng summarily killed. After battling their way to this place, and seeing their enemies only increase in number, Lin Feng had decided to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm to make the rest of their travels easier.

"But there are too many of them, and they came too fast!"

Only fifteen minutes had passed, but the array disc in his hand was already flickering erratically. A web of fine cracks spread across its surface, and the disc grew scalding hot.

*BANG!*

The precious array disc finally succumbed to the strain, exploding into a thousand pieces. The shimmering array vanished, revealing Wang Changyan to his enemies. The leading monk, his face contorted in fury, stared at the lone man and roared:

"Only you, you whelp? Where is that fiend?!"

Wang Changyan knew Lin Feng was in seclusion in the cultivator's abode directly beneath his feet. He refused to speak. The monk didn't attack immediately. Instead, his expression filled with sorrow, and he spoke, tears streaming down his face:

"Ever since the Maha fell and the great lineages scattered, our small temple branch has had no desire to contend with others. We remained in these mountains seeking only to preserve our Daoist tradition. Who would have thought that you bastards would barge in, murdering our people and destroying our temple for no reason! What justice is there in that?!"

The others nearby were grinding their teeth in hatred. One cultivator stepped forward and snapped:

"Enough talk! Force the fiend's whereabouts out of him!"

He strode forward and, in a few swift moves, seized the dharma power-depleted Wang Changyan. But just as he was about to strike, the heavy snowfall abruptly ceased. The snow on the ground instantly melted, replaced by creeping, reddish flames.

"Who dares!"

A torrent of red flames erupted from the abode below, engulfing the crowd. The assembled Buddhist cultivators and cultivators could not withstand the divine ability. They all collapsed, their knees shattering, their bodies rupturing from the sheer pressure.

A man in red and white armor emerged, commanding the fire. He tilted his head back and let out a long roar that blasted the very snow from the sky, leaving only his proud, defiant silhouette.

"A swarm of ants dares to block my path!"

He pressed two fingers together, unleashing a jet of flame. In an instant, all the cultivators below were incinerated. The wailing monk, the vengeful cultivatornot even ash remained. The fire consumed them all and scorched the fertile, snow-covered earth beneath, burning away all moisture, turning rich soil to sand, transforming the land into a barren desert.

"Young Master Lin!"

Wang Changyan wept with joy. But then he saw dark clouds gather overhead, and a massive golden body gradually emerged. Its upper half was veiled in brilliant light, its feet resting on the clouds, trampling a mountain of fiends. Behind it, a thousand hands each gripped a long staff. A jade crown glowed upon its head, and nestled within that crown was another human head, its face contorted in rage.

This primary face had a jade-like complexion and a slightly open mouth. But upon its tongue rested another facepink and delicate, with two bulging, bloodshot eyes. This second mouth opened and bellowed:

"Demonic disciple! How dare you commit mass slaughter here!"

"I am the Maha of the Way of Wrath! I have descended from the rain of myriad blossoms specifically to subdue you, demon!"

Wang Changyan nearly fainted from terror. 'What kind of Maha is this?! It's hideous! A head growing out of another head... even a true fiend couldn't be this monstrous!'

The grandiose spectacle made even Lin Feng frown. He studied the being, unable to suppress a visceral disgust. A throbbing anger surged within him, a deep-seated loathing, as if he recognized this creature from a time long past. He replied:

"Maha my ass."

He immediately summoned a long, red-glowing saber. Gripping it tightly, he pointed it directly at the massive entity in the sky. Red flames billowed from his feet as he shot into the air.

"Flames, come!"

As expected of a person of his stature, he had summoned a Spiritual Treasure right away. The Maha in the sky was so terrified it almost dropped its illusory form and fled. But, having accepted this task, it could only brace itself, summon its own Treasured Artifact, and roar:

"Fiend, you still dare to act so presumptuously!"

The garish, multi-colored Treasured Artifact lasted only a single breath against the raging flames of the Blazing Fire Spiritual Treasure. It held on only because of the Maha's vastly superior cultivation and dharma power. But as the corner of Lin Feng's mouth curved into a smirk, the artifact emitted a tormented screech and exploded.

"Vicious disciple!"

The Maha didn't have time to mourn its artifact. It transformed into a streak of light and fled toward the horizon. Lin Feng, seeing it was all bark and no bite, laughed loudly and gave chase, shooting north at extreme speed. He left only a patch of lingering flames and a single sentence behind:

"Changyan, wait here! I'll be right back!"

The flames drifted down, enveloping Wang Changyan in a protective barrier. Filled with relief, he sat down cross-legged, overwhelmed with emotion.

'Incredible... That Maha was terrifying, yet Young Master Lin is chasing it down like prey...'

He sat for a while, his heart gradually calming as the wind and snow resumed their fall. Then, he spotted a small black dot moving through the blizzard. As it drew closer, he saw it was an old man leaning on a staff, walking slowly toward him.

At first, Wang Changyan worried for the old man in the cold. But as the figure drew closer, he saw the ordination scars on his head. He was a monk. Disgust immediately filled Wang Changyan. The old monk stopped, his staff planting itself firmly in the snow. He pressed his palms together and sighed.

"Fellow Daoist, you are here searching for your family, are you not?"

Wang Changyan assumed the monk had used some divine ability to discover this. He remained wary and silent. But the old monk continued:

"Your disciple-brother and disciple-sister came from the south all those years ago. They achieved sudden enlightenment and are now quite famous in the dharma-realm. Now, you too have been called by karma, traveling a thousand li to be here. You have opportunely borrowed this Great One's momentum to arrive. It is truly wonderful."

"Fellow Daoist... it is time for you to return to the Buddhist Land."

Wang Changyan stared at him warily, but the old monk simply smiled faintly.

"I am the abbot of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. Following the guidance of karma, I have come to receive you, Fellow Daoist."

In that instant, the wind and snow ceased, and a brilliant light flashed.

*

The snow over Shanghuo County flickered in and out of existence, but Lin Feng was already far away, having crossed one snow-covered prefecture city after another. Monks below would occasionally look up as he passed, but soon the terrain grew higher. The monks disappeared, and the air grew thick with immortal energy, wreathed in white mist.

After a long chase, Lin Feng pulled a small flask from his sleeve. He blew on it, and a jet of reddish flame leaped out. It swelled in the wind, instantly vaporizing the snow and cracking the earth below.

The Maha, having already lost one excellent Treasured Artifact, dared not block the attack with its dharma body. It desperately tossed out several more common Treasured Artifacts, but these flames were extraordinary. The fire curled in the air, instantly melting the artifacts into molten slag. This only seemed to fuel the blaze, which lunged for the Maha's back.

The Maha prepared to traverse the Great Void, but a sudden chill prickled its brow. The Spiritual Treasure saber was already there, waiting in the void, ready to drop on its head the moment it crossed over.

"Dammit..."

Choosing the lesser of two evils, it channeled its dharma power, streams of golden light pouring from its brow to form a shield against the inferno at its back.

But the Way of Blazing Fire was unique. A single drop of the flame touched the golden shield and instantly expanded, sapping the Maha's dharma power as if it were a karmic flame. Its dharma body began to crack all over, paralyzing it.

The shield was pierced like paper. The Maha's dharma body, renowned for its toughness, melted like wax where the fire touched. A large hole was burned clean through it. The entity flashed with brilliant light and howled in agony.

'They said Foundation Establishment Realm and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators weren't as terrifying as they used to be... What bullshit! What kind of Purple Mansion Realm cultivator pulls out two Spiritual Treasures and hunts someone down like this?!'

Despite its grievous injuries, the Maha's escape light never wavered, and it finally bought itself a moment's respite.

But the respite was brief. Lin Feng drew closer, the scorching flames almost licking the Maha's back. The spiritual energy in the air was growing denser here. The Maha stopped trying to weave through the Great Void and was now burning massive amounts of dharma power to flee in the real world, barely maintaining its distance.

Soon, as the terrain grew more complex, the Maha suddenly dropped its massive form, using the maneuver to dodge the flames. It transformed into a young monk with snow-white skin. He looked wretched. A large, smoldering hole was burned through the back of his robes, the edges blackened and red.

He even retained his mortal habits, sucking in sharp breaths against the pain as he hiked up his robesrevealing calves wrapped in white clothand stumbled onward.

They had reached a deep forest, and the faint song of a woodcutter drifted through the trees. Lin Feng felt something was wrong and stopped. He suddenly noticed two Daoists on a large rock up ahead, chatting and laughing.

The younger of the two, who looked middle-aged, stood beside the rock. He had a long face, phoenix eyes, and was dressed simply, with only six small, antique-looking decorative swords at his waist. He was bowing respectfully to the other.

The older one wore purple-black Daoist robes. Though his face was wrinkled, he exuded the transcendent aura of an immortal. He smiled as he gazed forward, seeming both amiable and approachable.

Lin Feng stopped. The fleeing monk collapsed to his knees with a thud, kowtowing frantically at the feet of the two Daoists. The middle-aged Daoist stepped right over the monk, approached Lin Feng, and smiled.

"Sir, please."

Lin Feng frowned slightly and took a step forward. The old Daoist hopped down from the rock and cupped his hands in greeting.

"Senior, please!"

...

Jiangbei.

This mountain range in Jiangbei was sparsely vegetated and covered in a thin layer of snow. It faced a small set of hills to the north and was only a few dozen li from the Golden Tang Gate. One only had to look up to the east to see Tangdao Mountain and the colorful, glowing Buddhist Land that reached into the clouds. Many monks had already begun building temples in the area, marking their territory.

There were no famous mountains here, and the Great Void was calm. Li Ximing rode his Heavenly Light, its colors muted, as he waited quietly in a corner of the void.

The Great One's time in Jiangbei was set at six years and six months. The disturbances in the north were significant, but too distant to discern clearly. The appointed time, however, was fixed. For the past month, Li Ximing had been out of seclusion, waiting here anxiously.

His greatest worry was the Buddhist Land to the east.

Bai Yinzi's cultivation spot was actually well-chosen: neither too close nor too far from the major sects, with only the Golden Tang Gate nearby. He himself was an old man, well past his prime, so when the various factions were vying for talents, he was naturally far less desirable than prospects like Xiao Yuan.

But then the Buddhist cultivators conquered the Golden Tang Gate and pressed south over the mountains. Suddenly, Bai Yinzi's location became extremely awkwardit was now right on their doorstep. This made Li Ximing, waiting in secret, deeply anxious.

'It was hard to tell before,' Li Ximing thought, 'but for the last month, a Merciful One has been active nearby, making a big show of it. Apparently, the Buddhist cultivators value this old man more than I anticipated.'

Bai Yinzi's path on the Immortal Dao was a dead end. His cultivation from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment Realm was based on laughably poor methods; he had reached his current realm almost entirely by luck. But the Buddhist cultivators didn't care about that. His old age was irrelevant. Once he entered the Buddhist Land, his lifespan would be greatly extended. They had time.

'Luckily, they only seem to have dispatched a single Merciful One. One is nothing to fear. I'll just grab the man and leave. No need for entanglement.'

With two great treasures in his possession, his confidence was high.

He waited silently for another moment, then recited an incantation to consult the Immortal Mirror. His sea of qi roiled, and his heart trembled.

"It really is Bai Yinzi!"

Bai Yinzi's abode was shallow and crude, more like a small hovel dug into the mountaintop. The old man was sitting inside, cultivating. Beside him lay a golden-sheathed sword.

Li Ximing almost jumped, but a closer look revealed the gold was just the scabbard, apparently crafted from some cheap, gilded metal. It was an insulting sheath for the dharma sword within.

Peering past the gaudy exterior, he could see the gray longsword resting within, exuding the clear, cold light of the moon. It was a complete mismatch for the old man and his crude surroundings.

'Falling Cassia!'

To put it bluntly, if you sold Bai Yinzi and all his worldly possessions, it wouldn't be enough to buy the raw materials for this blade. Yet this precious Secret Diffusion Supreme Yin longsword was just lying casually by the bed, like some common trinket.

'Unbelievable...'

Li Ximing saw it clearly. This was the exact sword that had appeared in everyone's minds back then!

"Excellent!"

His gaze shifted, focusing on the pommel. It wasn't bare. A Qi Refining-level treasure was tied to it, a tassel woven from glittering golden silkworm thread.

The discovery made Li Ximing's breath catch. He pulled his gaze away, a theory already forming.

'It's definitely the sword. Logically, the fragment should have been hanging from the hilt. When the Great One retrieved the sword, he would have taken the fragment with it and given them both to Bai Yinzi...'

'So... it's highly likely Bai Yinzi received it, put the original fragment away for safekeeping, and then ran off to commission this gaudy scabbard. He must have thought the original tassel was too crude and plain, so he replaced it with this flashy golden thread.'

'Rogue cultivators are frugal. Since he stored the fragment, it's almost certainly in his storage bag.'

He immediately scanned the Great Void again. He wasn't alone. Two Merciful Ones and a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master were also positioned near the mountain, motionless, just waiting.

"What a lively gathering..."

Thanks to the Immortal Mirror, Li Ximing knew the exact positions of all three. He calculated quickly. From his current position, if he descended now, he would arrive at the exact same moment as the old nun. He was fast enough.

The cold snow fell. As he pondered, a red glow rippled on the distant horizon, flashing once. At the same moment, a jade pendant in his palm suddenly shattered, disintegrating into fine powder.

"The Great One has gone to Luoxia!"

The breakthrough phenomenon appeared, and the pendant shattered at the same instant. It was the signal from Ning Wan!

He didn't know where she was, and she was likely fighting for her own resources, but she had still remembered to send the signal.

Li Ximing's mind cleared. Without a second thought, he strode through the Great Void. A brilliant Heavenly Light erupted from the mountainside, appearing at the exact same instant as the distant phenomenon on the horizon!

Bai Yinzi's defensive array was a child's toy. Traversing it through the Great Void was instantaneous. The heavy, sealed stone door was a joke, utterly useless against a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Li Ximing materialized directly inside the abode.

As expected, the abode was dim, shabby, and poor, lit only by a single, bean-sized flame. It contained nothing but a stone bed of the crudest make.

The old man, Bai Yinzi, was hunched over, cultivating cross-legged on the bed, completely unaware.

*BOOM!*

A brilliant Treasure Light erupted, no slower than Li Ximing. On the other side of the tiny abode, an ancient, frail-looking nun materialized. She wore gray robes, held a long string of prayer beads, and had a compassionate face, but her eyes were icy cold as they locked onto him.

"Fellow Daoist, wait!"

Both he and the nun lunged for Bai Yinzi at the same instant. Li Ximing's heart was in turmoil.

'When a Merciful One and a Purple Mansion Realm expert clash, Bai Yinzi will be killed in the crossfire. The nun is strong, and she's here for the man. Her first move will be to protect him with all her dharma power, even if it means letting me take the Falling Cassia dharma sword.'

He sighed. In that final instant, his Heavenly Light flickered, dodging the nun's divine ability and latching onto the sword's hilt, snatching Falling Cassia from the bed.

He was undoubtedly stronger than her. If they were alone, he could have used his Spiritual Artifact to suppress her and take both the man and the sword. But with two other "orioles" waiting in the hiding, Li Ximing had to take the sword first.

There was no other choice. Many eyes were on Li Ximing. The Li family had, under public scrutiny, received news of this sword from a True Monarch and had been publicly searching for it with a drawing, a search that had led them straight to Bai Yinzi.

Everyone believed the Li family's entire all-consuming searchthe reason Li Ximing had even abandoned Wang Xiaoxiao's familywas for this Supreme Yin dharma sword. That could be explained by the connection between the Celestial Moon Sword Codex and Supreme Yin. But if he *didn't* take the sword, and instead lunged for a storage bag? Forget the assembled cultivators, Merciful Ones, and Mahaseven an idiot would know something was amiss.

The resulting trouble would be endless; the others would fight him to the death for the *real* prize. If he took the sword, however, there would be plenty of opportunity to negotiate for the man later.

He had no choice but to feign ecstasy as he secured the sword, watching as the nun's divine ability enveloped Bai Yinzi. But even with this "concession," the old nun looked surprised. She stared at him coldly.

"Oh... the Li clan even abandoned Wang Xiaoxiao for this. There must be something truly special about this Supreme Yin dharma sword!"

Li Ximing wasn't the least bit afraid. He watched her calmly, determined to get what he came for. A thick killing intent rose in his heart as he said softly:

"You can't take him alone. Everyone else, come on out."

This statement was meant to justify his taking the sword. The old nun's face showed a trace of apprehension. She said nothing, but her hands immediately formed a seal. The prayer beads began to spin, releasing a massive amount of golden light.

"Just you?"

Li Ximing stood unmoved. The blue-and-yellow spiritual ruler at his waist floated up, spinning slowly. A two-colored, ripple-like pattern of mountains and rivers spread outward, obliterating the abode's array, stone door, and walls. The entire hovel exploded from the inside out like a firecracker, kicking up a massive storm of dust and pulverized rock on the mountaintop.

*BOOM!*

The overlapping pattern of mountains and rivers bloomed across the snow-covered peak like a mysterious, blue-and-yellow flower. The Daoist Master in his white-gold robes stood upon his Heavenly Light, his voice like thunder and brimming with killing intent:

"Do you really think you're one of the Lotus Seat's elite?!"
