# Chapter 1221: The Provocation's End

With the great matter here settled, the weight on the hearts of the Li family members was lifted. Li Jiangqian’s smile grew a few degrees more genuine as he paced a few circles with his hands clasped behind his back. Having gained control of the grand formation, he turned and said with a laugh:

“The disturbance just now was astounding; it was seen from both the north and the south. There will likely be probes, so I must ask fellow Daoist Cheng Qian to keep watch for us.”

Cheng Qian naturally agreed and left his aura on the formation plate. It was strange—not only was Liu Changdie's grand formation different from the common designs of Jiangnan, but even the auras left as records on the plate were divided into nine layers, each corresponding to a different level of authority. This was a remarkably useful feature.

The three of them stepped into the Great Void together and descended upon the lake. Liu Changdie's expression grew somewhat complicated. He pondered for a long while before finally taking a seat and saying:

“This formation… it was set up with remarkable smoothness.”

Liu Changdie had long held his suspicions. The formation's foundations in the great desert had been constructed with extreme precision, resolving the matter of the earth veins in only seven days. His words before the hall had been simple at the time, but logically, the difficulty of this grand formation was not something an ordinary cultivator could have a hand in…

'Perhaps Li Jiangqian was in a hurry and had Ning Wan assist with the foundations…'

Had it been only that, it would have been one thing, but the process of linking the various formation platforms to complete the grand array had still been far faster than he anticipated—this was no simple matter! The crucial junctures were mostly aligned with the auric signature he had left behind. Once or twice would have been fine, but by the time the formation was complete, he appeared unperturbed on the surface, but inwardly he felt as though he had seen a ghost!

'This isn't a matter of whether it could be done. It involves numerous proprietary designs from my tradition, secrets that should be completely unknown to outsiders… How could Ning Wan possibly know them!'

This touched upon the secrets of his tradition, and his heart was filled with suspicion. Though he was holding his tongue out of consideration for Cheng Qian, he could not bear it. After a brief salute, he immediately asked:

“Was this formation constructed under the supervision of Daoist Master Ning?”

Although Li Jiangqian was completely ignorant about formations, Liu Changdie’s question immediately made him raise an eyebrow. He said:

“Naturally, it was not entrusted to outsiders. The ones who supervised its construction were two juniors of my own family.”

“Juniors?”

A flicker of shock crossed Liu Changdie's face. Li Jiangqian took two steps with his hands behind his back and asked with a smile:

“Is that good… or bad?”

Liu Changdie sighed.

“It’s astonishingly good! It’s as if I had guided the work myself!”

A strange light flickered in Li Jiangqian's eyes, the doubt on his face instantly deepening. Fortunately, Li Ximing, who was beside them, smiled and replied:

“I understand… Uncle, do you remember… the Dao Lineage I went to the Eastern Sea to request all those years ago?”

“The Dao Lineage?”

Liu Changdie understood in an instant. He stroked his beard and nodded.

“The Sutra of Profound Iteration? Yes… so that’s how it is.”

A touch of delight appeared on his face.

“I had forgotten. Here on the lake… there is a junior who received my legacy. I remember… his name is Suining, is it not?”

Li Jiangqian nodded with a smile.

“Now that the grand formation is complete, it is the perfect time for you to meet.”

“Excellent!”

Liu Changdie was quite cheerful about it, but Li Ximing, standing to the side, frowned as he held his cup. He felt a slight sense of unease, but since the junior had inherited the man's legacy, it was only right that he appear. Thus, he held his tongue.

In a short while, a young man was seen ascending from the mountainside. He had long brows, handsome eyes, and a somber air about him, but the respectful smile he wore diluted the coldness of his expression. He bowed amidst the mountains and said respectfully:

“Greetings to the three Daoist Masters!”

Li Ximing smiled, beckoned him forward, and gestured.

“This is Daoist Master Yuanbian!”

The young man moved with great ease, stepping forward to bow again.

“This junior received the Daoist Master’s legacy and has studied it day and night without daring to be neglectful. I have benefited immensely each time and am boundlessly grateful. I have looked up to you as one looks to a great mountain. Now that I may finally behold your presence, please accept this junior’s bow of respect!”

These were no empty pleasantries. Liu Changdie’s Sutra of Profound Iteration taught true substance. Li Suining had already committed it to heart in his previous two lives, yet he could always glean new insights from it.

'But… this Daoist Master never involved himself in the affairs of the mainland. In this life, why has he returned to the lake!'

Liu Changdie studied him carefully and, for some unknown reason, felt a sense of familiarity. It caused him to pause for a beat before he finally nodded with feeling and praised:

“The younger generation is truly formidable!”

He said only those four words and nothing more. Li Suining bowed once again and replied:

“I have not achieved even a ten-thousandth of the Daoist Master’s skill!”

Li Ximing nodded with a smile.

“This was always the bond of a master and disciple, but it could not be fulfilled with the vast Eastern Sea separating you. Now that you have this rare chance to meet, why not formalize it? Let him become a nominal disciple, so that his inheritance of the Dao Lineage is not in vain.”

These words fell upon the Daoist Master’s ears, and a complex look entered his eyes.

'A disciple…'

In his previous life, Liu Changdie had heard a very similar proposal to take a disciple, also from the mouth of Li Ximing.

'Only… it was not Daoist Master Li Ximing, but Seventh Young Master Li Ximing.'

Across two lives, Liu Changdie had only ever had one truly devoted disciple: Li Chenghui, the eldest son of the Li Ximing from his past life. The boy had been exceptionally filial and brilliant, but was ultimately brought to ruin by Liu Changdie's own reckless deeds, and the Li family lost a pillar of their formation arts. When Li Ximing had come seeking the Dao Lineage, he had given the true teachings without hesitation, partly out of a desire to atone.

Though he had since moved past it, how could Liu Changdie not feel a pang of pain upon seeing this scene unfold once more? He shook his head, momentarily speechless, before saying:

“Since he has received the Dao Lineage, there is no need for him to be a ‘nominal’ anything… I have been a wanderer my entire life, with no immortal sect or peak to pass on, so I make no distinction between inner and outer disciples. Fortunately, I have no great troubles to my name either. To be able to accept you as my student is a stroke of luck for me…”

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully, a vague understanding of why Liu Changdie had appeared at the lake dawning in his heart. Li Suining, however, was shocked and terrified, joyful and worried, unable to fathom what he had changed this time. But with his Foundation Establishment cultivation, he truly had no say in the matter. He could not speak a single word of his thoughts and could only go with the flow, kneeling down and saying respectfully:

“Disciple greets Master!”

In the brief moment he lowered his head, he vaguely glimpsed a flash of gold to his side. From the moment he had entered the hall, this personage had not uttered a single word, his golden eyes fixed on him with a tight, focused, and thoughtful gaze.

“Good…”

A smile touched Liu Changdie's eyes as he nodded silently. He then took out incense from his sleeve and said:

“Since you have inherited my Dao Lineage, you should also pay respects to the founding master!”

At these words, Li Jiangqian’s gaze finally shifted, moving from the young man to the middle-aged Daoist Master who now spoke with a solemn expression.

“My Dao of formations came from the Eastern Sea, from an ancient cultivator of the Liang Dynasty, Daoist Master Zhou Rao. Though the diagrams are lost and the lineage does not prosper, with all traces of it gone, you must remember your heritage and never forget your origins.”

With its long history, the Li family had a considerable understanding of the Daoist traditions of the recent past. Others might not have caught the implication, but Li Jiangqian was already suspicious.

'I fear this senior… knows little about his own Dao Lineage.'

After they had performed the various rites and offered the incense, Li Ximing, who had been waiting for some time, finally found an opportunity to speak softly.

“Uncle, you have always steered clear of the mainland’s disputes, yet today you have come here… Was it because you feared our family’s formation might not be completed in time?”

At the mention of this, the smile on Liu Changdie’s face faded. He said quietly:

“It’s nothing, really. That lord of the Dragon-kin made things clear, which actually put my fears to rest. But it did make me think of something.”

“The path of Vault Metal cannot be used for verifying the Dao, but that does not mean it cannot be walked. Even if it is a futile effort, even if it means dabbling in other Daoist traditions, I will still walk it. With a few divine abilities at my disposal, I can at least be a thorn in the side of those great lords.”

He said with a smile on his face:

“Before, I only thought of my own troubles, and I was afraid of involving you all. Now I see clearly that you are also fighting with everything you have.”

At these words, not only did the two Daoist Masters present fall silent, but Li Suining, his head still bowed, was also shaken to the core.

'This Daoist Master Yuanbian… he doesn’t know any less than anyone else!'

Liu Changdie did not dwell on the topic, instead bringing up the elder Li Xuanxuan, whom he had evidently been missing for some time. Li Ximing nodded and accompanied him toward the center of the island, leaving the mountainside suddenly empty, with only Li Jiangqian remaining.

The crimson-robed young man stood up and paced a few circles on the mountainside, intrigued.

'I had long heard that this boy was highly regarded by my grand-uncle and father. I thought he was merely a formation master and paid it no mind… But now it seems he is quite interesting indeed, no worse than that good nephew of mine!'

His gaze was bright and his face held a smile. He stood there for more than ten breaths before his sister descended in a flash of clear light. He had just raised his head to speak when he saw Li Que'wan's solemn expression as she whispered:

“Someone from the Dragon-kin has arrived! I intercepted them at the foot of the mountain and led them to the Milin Mountains. I only came to see you after watching the two elders depart!”

“The Dragon-kin?!”

Li Jiangqian’s expression hardened. He narrowed his eyes.

“It’s about Fuxun… It’s a good thing you intercepted them.”

“It’s possible.”

Li Que'wan’s expression was equally grave.

“Fuxun is dead. We have already made our inquiries. They cannot remain silent forever; they must give us a response.”

Li Jiangqian closed his eyes for a moment.

“Leave it to me… You go to the island and remind Grand-uncle—do not let Liu Changdie go to Gardenia Scenery Mountain. His heart is full of resentment. If they were to meet, a conflict would be a disaster for either side, to say nothing of certain misunderstandings… that would be difficult to resolve.”

The woman nodded gravely and vanished. A moment later, a figure ascended the mountain path. Though he had the appearance of a Daoist, demonic flames roiled around his body. It was Ping Yan.

When he had visited in the past, he had carried himself with a dignified, if not imposing, air and had been on speaking terms with Li Ximing. But now, without his retinue, he looked like a wilted vegetable. Standing before the steps and seeing it was not Li Ximing who greeted him, his heart sank. He spoke softly:

“Ping Yan has come to deliver a message… And you are, fellow Daoist…?”

Li Jiangqian did not look at him, instead pouring himself a cup of tea and drinking it before answering coolly:

“Li Jiangqian.”

'Just as I feared!'

A bitter taste filled Ping Yan's mouth.

“So it is the Eldest Young Master!”

He had known this would be no pleasant errand, and being intercepted at the foot of the mountain was an even more ominous sign. Now, upon entering the mountain, the most reasonable one, Li Ximing, refused to see him, and in his place was the son of the White Qilin himself! Ping Yan felt as if he had been plunged into an icy cavern.

'Lu Xu… you've doomed me!'

But as things stood, he could only bite the bullet and force a smile.

“I was wondering… is fellow Daoist Zhaojing…”

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian knew that his family truly held the upper hand, and that there was likely discord within the Dragon-kin. He lifted his chin and said coldly:

“A certain senior could no longer remain in the Eastern Sea. With his dear friend fallen, he has come to the lake seeking refuge. My grand-uncle is currently entertaining his guest and cannot receive you.”

'So that Liu fellow really did come to Jiangnan to air his grievances!'

Although Ping Yan was a cultivator, within the hierarchy of the Dragon-kin, he was no different from a demon beast. Li Zhouwei’s noble blood was comparable to that of a Dragon King. The Li Jiangqian before him might only be an early Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but his status was at least that of a Dragon Prince. According to the demonic hierarchy, Ping Yan was not even qualified to stand and speak in his presence!

Realizing he had just touched a sore spot, the demon wished he could slap himself. He said awkwardly:

“I see… What unfortunate timing.”

Li Jiangqian glanced at him.

“What instructions does the master of the Eastern Sea have for us?”

Ping Yan sighed and replied:

“Your Highness speaks too gravely! Lu Xu neglected his duties, and the Dragon King was furious. He has been cast into the dungeons and has not yet been released. Although this humble cultivator did not neglect his duties, I was punished for bringing Ying Hebai along without considering the broader situation… I have come today to pay my respects as one who has been reprimanded.”

Lu Xu was a famous general under Dragon King Beihai, so this was indeed a sincere gesture. Li Jiangqian was inwardly moved, but his expression remained impassive as he sneered:

“Don’t beat around the bush with me. I have only one question for you—which Dragon King took that demon beast?”

The words were delivered with the true tone of the Dragon-kin, causing a cold sweat to break out on Ping Yan’s brow. He bowed deeply and said in a subservient whisper:

“In response to Your Highness, it was the Dragon King of the Si Sea. This lord… as Your Highness understands, the innumerable demon beasts in the sea are but rations for the great lords… He had been in seclusion for many years and was unaware of the changes in the world. He was passing through the area and, on a whim, simply ate it… This… this…”

Ping Yan, daring to offend neither party, chose his words carefully. He did not expect Li Jiangqian to laugh twice before retorting:

“Unaware? Feigning ignorance, more like! To which shrine does this personage belong?”

Ping Yan bowed.

“He is a descendant of the Daozhen Converging Water Sandalwood Hornless Dragon, and holds a position in the Red Dragon Shrine.”

Hearing this title, Li Jiangqian recognized a perfect opportunity to learn about the internal power structure of the Dragon-kin and sneered.

“And this Daozhen Converging Water Sandalwood Hornless Dragon, what is his name?”

Ping Yan lowered his gaze.

“His name is Tianye. He is the seventh son.”

'So it’s that seventh Hornless Dragon scion who died at the hands of the Liang Emperor…'

With this, the impatient look on Li Jiangqian’s face intensified as if he were suppressing a great rage.

“And what of the Black and White Dragon Shrines?”

Unsure what he was plotting, Ping Yan answered in a low voice:

“The White Dragon Shrine is descended from the Daoju Converging Water Sun Hornless Dragon; the lord’s revered name is Riju. The Black Dragon Shrine is descended from the Daozhu Converging Water Moon Hornless Dragon; his revered name is Yuezhu…”

'So they aren’t descendants of Beijia. And from his words, the Dragon-kin hold the ancestors of the Black and White Shrines in very high esteem. As for Dongfang Tianye, he isn’t addressed as ‘lord,’ but simply as Tianye. Relations might even have soured to an extreme degree…'

Without much hesitation, Li Jiangqian put on an expression of one so angry he could only laugh, and snapped:

“Though I have long resided on the mainland, even I know the Eastern Sea is territory divided between the Black and White Dragons! The Red Dragon Shrine lost its patron years ago, so how dare they throw their weight around! And you still dare to conceal the truth!”

Ping Yan felt a headache coming on. He said hastily:

“Your Highness… you wrong me, Your Highness!”

Seeing he could not evade the matter without taking a side, he could only grit his teeth and say:

“…This lord of the Si Sea cultivates the Lesser Yang, and his name was reported to Dragon Monarch Xiyang himself!”

'No wonder!'

Given how favored Dragon King Beihai was, how could the one who dared provoke him be an ordinary sort? Li Jiangqian understood at once, a flicker of interest in his heart.

'The demonic corruption in Fuxun’s body was very likely the work of the White Victory Dao. In that case, it all adds up.'

But his face remained displeased as he said with a cold glare:

“The Dragon King has certainly gone to great trouble.”

Seeing that he was finally relenting, Ping Yan quickly produced a casket from his sleeve and said respectfully:

“Lu Xu has been punished, but it was our lord who broke his promise. He therefore made a special trip to the Dragon Palace and carefully selected… a treasure for your noble family… as compensation.”

“Oh?”

Li Jiangqian felt a stir of interest and watched as the demon before him opened the jade casket. Inside, shimmering in watery light, lay a square, golden plate.

The plate was about a palm in length, no more than two fingers wide, and as thin as silk. Its markings were faint as it bobbed in the water, a truly peculiar sight. Li Jiangqian looked on with great curiosity as the demon beast hastily put on a fawning smile.

“There are not many items of Vault Metal left in the hands of the great lords. Most of what remains should now be with that personage of Metal Virtue in the north. After much searching, this was the only thing we could find of use. It is a Profound Vault Invitation Letter…”

'Compensation for Senior Liu!'

He feigned a frown.

“Oh? Is that all?”

Ping Yan was stunned for a moment before replying in a low voice:

“Your Highness, the value of this item is far beyond that of a mere mid-stage Purple Mansion demon beast!”

Li Jiangqian laughed.

“I understand. Knowing the Dragon King’s temperament, he would naturally not treat us poorly. But Senior Liu is merely a friend of my family’s elders. He no longer dares to venture to the Eastern Sea. So who, then, will guard our Wave-Suppressing Mansion? Might that Dragon King of the Si Sea come by one day and devour someone else?”

The Li family had not yet grasped Liu Changdie’s intentions, but in Li Jiangqian’s view, it was highly likely the elder was already considering a change and was no longer willing to stand guard over the Eastern Sea. He naturally intended to seize this perfect opportunity to secure a guarantee from the Dragon-kin.

This was a foolproof bargain. Even if the Dragon-kin went back on their word, with this guarantee in place, should disaster ever befall the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, the Dragon-kin would be obligated to provide compensation just as they were today—so long as the Li family still had a voice.

“This…”

Ping Yan pondered for a moment before speaking in a low voice:

“This is not a decision this lowly one can make. I’m afraid I must return and inquire.”

“By all means, ask.”

Li Jiangqian replied coolly. The demon stood there awkwardly as he continued in a quiet tone:

“Since Lu Xu has been cast into the dungeons, the matter my father previously entrusted to him now falls to you, fellow Daoist.”

Ping Yan readily agreed, not wishing to linger a moment longer. He hastily took his leave, leaving only the fluttering gardenia blossoms behind. The young man stood up, his gaze falling on the jade casket on the table with a hint of disappointment.

'It was to be expected…'

He paced on the mountain for a time, then suddenly sensed something and raised his head, looking toward the northwest.

On the distant horizon, a terrifying, sky-piercing storm was brewing. Boundless white light coalesced into clouds, and one could vaguely see an autumnal dew pouring down like a torrential rain, shaking the very heavens and earth!

'That is… the Long region!'

Even from his position above the lake, he could still hear a faint, piercing drone.

'Someone has fallen!'

The expression on his face froze for a moment.

'At this time, in this situation, who else could have fallen? It must be Western Shu!'

He was both elated and worried.

'Qing Jifang can’t hold on any longer!'

Without the slightest hesitation, Li Jiangqian stepped into the Great Void, arriving above the great desert in a matter of moments. The newly erected profound platform glittered with light, surrounded by cultivators gazing upward. Cheng Qian stood in the Great Void as well, his expression one of shock and uncertainty.

“Your Highness!”

Li Jiangqian gave a hurried nod and waited anxiously in the Great Void for a time. Liu Changdie rushed over to join them, steadying himself and looking at the two with a worried expression.

“What is it?”

Li Jiangqian gave a polite shake of his head. Liu Changdie realized that news from the Long region would not arrive so quickly. He adjusted his sleeves and said in a low voice:

“The Seventh Young Master has already returned to stabilize his pill furnace, so that he can come to the desert’s aid at a moment’s notice without ruining his elixirs. He said we need only use a jade talisman to notify him.”

The young man nodded. The three of them sat down on the profound platform and waited for the better part of a day before a brilliant golden light shot across the sky, coming to a halt before the grand formation.

Without the slightest hesitation, Li Jiangqian raised his hand, reached across the Great Void, and pulled the rapidly approaching Ding Weizeng onto the profound platform. He asked in a grave voice:

“What happened?!”

Ding Weizeng’s vision went dark and then bright again as he found himself in a brilliant hall, with three Daoist Masters staring intently at him. Fortunately, the man was resolute and brave. He grasped the situation in an instant, fell to his knees, and reported in a solemn voice:

“Reporting to the Daoist Masters, according to the Golden Feather, Western Shu was jointly attacked by the Xiangxiong Kingdom and Great Zhao. They attempted to retreat to the Shu territories but were repeatedly struck by the master of the Profound Governance Pavilion. They were routed all the way to the Tao River, where they were unexpectedly intercepted by a Daoist Master!”

“This man, Jiang Yan, brought two Daoist Masters from noble families with him. They secretly departed from Mount Xiao, slipped right under Daoist Master Sun’s nose to the Tao River, and launched a surprise attack!”

He seemed greatly agitated as he continued in a low, intense voice:

“Daoist Master Qing was caught completely by surprise and was cut off. This Jiang Yan fought many opponents at once, suppressing the Great Void with a single divine ability, and the forces of Shu were utterly defeated! The court’s Daoist Master Wang Long—was slain on the spot by Jiang Yan! Many of those with divine abilities were caught in a pincer attack, and most were injured…”

“I heard… I heard that even Daoist Master Qing suffered some injuries…”

Hearing this, a brilliant light burst forth in Li Jiangqian’s eyes. He began to laugh.

“Excellent! Excellent! This man is truly a force to be reckoned with! And that clueless Qing Jifang actually managed to stumble into such a major defeat! The heavens are truly on my side!”

Li Jiangqian had considered a stalemate, a negotiated truce, and even the possibility that Great Zhao would be unable to reclaim its lost territory. But ever since the Xiangxiong Kingdom’s Bright Ones had been blocked in the south by that Great Daoist Master Wu Gan, the only scenario that could have led to a decisive defeat had been closed off. Even when Li Que'wan had asked, he could only shake his head in disappointment.

He had never dreamed that Qing Jifang could conjure a crushing defeat at the Tao River out of thin air!

Beside him, Liu Changdie’s eyes shone brightly. He nodded repeatedly and asked:

“Will this be a crippling blow to Western Shu?”

Hearing this news was like drinking fine wine for Li Jiangqian. The joyous surprise in his heart almost rivaled that of seeing the grand formation completed on time. He shook his head again and again, smiling.

“Senior, you may not be aware, but this is not yet a crippling blow for them. However, they must guard against both the Xiangxiong Kingdom and Great Zhao, so the forces they can deploy to our lakeside were already limited. Now, with everyone injured, their morale is bound to collapse, and no one will dare fight with their full strength!”

“They are on the attack while we defend. With their strength waning and ours growing, what power can they possibly project!”

He sneered.

“His only chance of victory was to leverage this sudden, unexpected defeat to rush to the lake immediately and strike while our grand formation was still incomplete. If this formation had been finished a month or two later, he might very well have turned this disaster into a blessing…”

“But as it is… let us see how much strength he has left!”
