# Chapter 1067: The Alternate Body

Li Ximing gave the golden scroll in his hand a slight shake, and the lines of colorful, bold characters within began to glow with a brilliant light.

This scroll was profoundly mysterious, an artifact from ancient times. Even a cultivator like Liu Changdie, a Vault Metal cultivator with a exception dao lineage, had struggled to decipher it. The scroll itself felt soft and pliant to the touch, similar in form to the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll.

The Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was primarily a technique for preserving one's life, avoiding calamities, and furthering cultivation. The first step was to master the creation of a Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

This body was forged from various treasures. The specific materials required depended on the cultivator's own divine abilities, demanding adaptability and a deep Dao-Profundity. The methods were generally divided into three tiers.

'The superior practitioner forges a body from primordial gold to pursue the Dao in a state of selfless oblivion. The middling practitioner cultivates a spirit within a prepared vessel to evade disaster and ward off evil. The inferior practitioner merely molds a clay effigy to shield a limb or preserve the body!'

The highest tier involved using an ancient spiritual object to create a duplicate body for cultivation. A lesser method was to create a proxy to act on one's behalf in the mortal world, thereby avoiding calamities. Both of these methods held infinite, wondrous power, capable of being used not only for reincarnation but even as a true out-of-body avatar.

But the method the scroll's author disdained most was using this art simply to block physical attacks.

Without a doubt, that was exactly what Li Ximing intended to do.

'The requirements for these spell arts are far too high,' he thought. 'Or perhaps ancient cultivators simply had an overabundance of resources! I don't possess materials of that quality… The only thing I can use is the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. It’s a rare item today, but in the eyes of the ancients, it was nothing special…'

The scroll referred to it as Veiled Dusk Mulberry, a type of Renewing Wood that had since devolved into a substance of Exiled Qi. After comparing the descriptions, Li Ximing confirmed it was the very same Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood in his possession—though his was just barely at the introductory grade.

Li Ximing felt no regret, only joy. Even if this made him an "inferior practitioner" in the eyes of the ancients, the prerequisite was still a Life Divine Ability. Without his World's Radiance, he couldn't even attempt this lowest tier. In today's world, this "inferior" method was a top-tier technique! Back then, even the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was considered a heterodox path of the lowest order.

Besides, with his current understanding, he could grasp the true meaning behind the middle-tier method of "evading disaster." The proxy body couldn't fool other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. It was likely used to walk the mortal world while the true self remained in the Great Void, observing from a distance. This had two benefits: it minimized entanglement with wordly affairs and helped mitigate the karmic consequences of any killing one committed, offering a greater chance of leniency when the Thunder Palace came to pass judgment.

With the Thunder Palace long since fallen, this middle-tier method was useless to Li Ximing. Only one thought occupied his mind:

'To shield a limb or preserve the body!'

He didn't have much else, but he had an abundance of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. The moment he returned from the sea, he had taken out a head-sized piece and begun cultivating the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

Li Ximing had spent the better part of the last two years on this project. The body needed to be nourished with various spiritual items and elixirs. He had accumulated a decent surplus from his years of alchemy, so he took out a few cultivation-enhancing pills from his sleeve and placed the alternate body within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance to mature.

Li Zhouwei's warning from years ago was still fresh in his mind. He placed his alchemy furnace in the same space, allowing the alchemical flames to permeate the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body to prevent any abnormalities from showing.

'After two years, it has finally reached the initial threshold. It’s time to test it...'

The more he looked at it, the more satisfied he felt. He reached into his sleeve and retrieved a box. Opening it revealed a single, thumb-sized white flower petal, shrouded in a hazy gray light.

It was the Hundred-Heart Soul-Union!

He made a light incision on the chest of the 'Li Ximing' before him, revealing a dark, beating heart within. He placed the Hundred-Heart Soul-Union in his palm, blew gently, and watched it transform into a gust of white wind that swirled into the opening.

The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body required a great deal. Even this most rudimentary version had cost Li Ximing considerable effort. Only now, with the Hundred-Heart Soul-Union integrated into the body, was it finally ready for use!

He formed a hand seal, forcing a drop of essence blood from his fingertip. He channeled the Light of the Six Harmonies into it and tapped the forehead of the seated 'Li Ximing'. The various illusory colors instantly converged and vanished. The body shrank into an exquisite, palm-sized sculpture that landed in his hand. A sweep of his spiritual sense brought a look of delight to his face.

'With the Hundred-Heart Soul-Union integrated, it’s already effective. When activated, it will transform into a clay-like shell enveloping my true body, absorbing a certain amount of damage… Its only weaknesses are fire and metal, especially Merging Fire and Geng Metal. Merging Fire's ability to damage one's essence and life force is no joke. Plus, since I used Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, it won't offer any resistance against Merging Fire—in fact, the fire might even destroy the alternate body.'

'I've heard that Vast Cicada uses a Heavenly Light pagoda and a spear of Li Fire. This should be able to withstand them. For now, I must continue to nourish it and link it with my Life Divine Ability. If the connection is strong enough, its effects will be even greater.'

The artifact's full potential depended on its master's nourishment and Dao-Profundity. When used for defense, its connection to the master's true body was paramount, requiring the involvement of a Life Divine Ability. But Li Ximing already had a plan for this:

'My World's Radiance has a specialized effect that will save me a great deal of effort.'

With a flicker, he descended from the Great Void and stepped into the grand hall situated on the lake. The golden plaque above the entrance gleamed with three large words:

Crimson Radiance Hall.

After the Bright Yang heirs went their separate ways and Li Jiangzong emerged from his seclusion, both the title and the authority of Family Head of Moongaze Lake fell into his hands. He had chosen to reside in this side hall, the Crimson Radiance Hall, as a sign of deference to the main Bright Yang lineage.

Li Jiangzong had matured considerably. After his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm, his presence had grown even more imposing. Seated in the hall, he exuded an air of authority. At this moment, however, the usually respectful scion of the main lineage was seething with rage, his hands clasped behind his back as he paced, his eyes filled with disgust and hatred.

A man with graying hair, Li Zhoufang, stood to the side, looking helpless. Nearby stood a grim-faced Li Zhouda. Kneeling on the steps below was a young man, his face fixed on the floor, refusing to look up.

In a mere instant, a ray of Heavenly Light shone down, and Li Ximing's figure materialized on the main seat. The Daoist Master rested a hand on the armrest, raised an eyebrow, and asked calmly,

"What is all this?"

In an instant, the expressions of everyone present changed. They fell to their knees from where they stood and cried out in unison,


"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing lowered his gaze slightly. Li Jiangzong, his head pressed tightly to the floor, finally looked up. He now wore a beard, which gave him a steady and composed appearance. 

"Reporting to the Daoist Master... I was failing in my duty to discipline my son... I was reprimanding a junior and did not mean to disturb your immortal presence..."

"Ah, so it's Suiqing."

Li Ximing smiled. Li Zhoufang, who was kneeling at the bottom, was already drenched in a cold sweat. He risked shuffling forward a couple of steps and said respectfully,

"We dare not disturb your divine affairs, Daoist Master. This junior will take the boy to Qingdu at once!"

Li Jiangzong's heart sank. This was bad. Did they really think Li Ximing, who spent all his days in seclusion, wouldn't know who Li Suiqing was? Sure enough, Li Ximing's smile faded slightly as he turned his gaze to Li Zhouda. The man, kneeling before the dais, immediately spoke up.

"While patrolling the western shore, this subordinate received a report from the Jade Court. Young Master Suiqing's family servant, Yan Kuai, has a nephew who grew excessively close with Tian Pan, the supervisor of the White Rainbow Jade Mine on the western shore. He secretly sent various peak cultivators to purchase the jade with gold and deliver it to him, thereby monopolizing the entire output..."

"With the world in chaos and supplies scarce, any cultivator on the western shore who needs White Rainbow Jade must buy it from Yan Kuai at an exorbitant price. He has been profiting immensely from this..."

Li Ximing asked casually, "And what does the law dictate?"

Li Zhouda bowed.

"Young Master Suiqing, for colluding with a supervisor and manipulating prices, shall have his illicit gains confiscated, receive three hundred lashes from a thunder whip, and be confined to the mountain for ten years. Tian Pan will be stripped of his post and taken in for questioning. Yan Kuai and his accomplices will be executed."

But the young man on the floor gritted his teeth.

"I had the ability to buy it and the means to sell it! On what grounds do you accuse me of manipulating prices!"

A flash of alarm crossed Li Jiangzong's eyes. His face darkened as he gritted his teeth and spun around to snarl at him,

"What ability? You relied on the clan's power!"

Li Suiqing's cultivation was weak; three hundred lashes with a thunder whip was a death sentence. Clearly, though Li Jiangzong was verbally calling for his son's head, he couldn't bear to see him truly harmed, or he wouldn't have brought him to this hall for questioning.

But Li Suiqing just sneered. The boy's face showed not a trace of fear. A cruel smile cracked his lips.

"And the only reason you're standing here today—is that due to your own ability?"

The words struck like a thunderclap, an offense to countless people. Yet Li Jiangzong felt no anger at being slighted, only a bone-chilling terror that drenched him in a cold sweat. His world was crumbling.

'You... you... you ungrateful fool! You still refuse to yield? You still won't back down!'

Then, he heard a soft laugh from the main seat. The Daoist Master's smile had completely vanished, replaced by a cold amusement. He glanced at the boy with interest and said,

"Go to Qingdu and receive your punishment."

It was like an illusion. As those quiet words fell, the figure on the main seat suddenly became impossibly distant, floating ethereally at the edge of the sky. Or perhaps it was everyone else in the hall who had plunged into an abyss, falling farther and farther away from him.

In that instant, Li Suiqing's expression changed completely. The defiance in his dark eyes melted away like ice in a spring breeze. The arrogant, vicious malice vanished without a trace. He became like a docile lamb, kneeling on the floor in a state of bewilderment.

'Yes…'

He carefully shifted his knees, rose to his feet, and said respectfully, "This junior was ignorant and disturbed you, my lord."

He bowed low at the waist, facing the main seat, and began to walk backward out of the hall. At the entrance, he kowtowed three times respectfully. Only then did he turn to a nearby guard with a calm, gentle voice, much to the guard's utter astonishment.

"Please escort me."

A dead silence fell over the hall. The color drained from Li Jiangzong's face. Terror and anguish surged through him, making his nose burn and his brow freeze. He knelt there, stunned, and looked dazedly at his father.

Li Zhoufang’s forehead was pressed to the ground, and he was weeping silently.

As if waking from a nightmare, Li Jiangzong scrambled on his knees toward the main seat. His lips were white, his eyes bloodshot. He cried out, his voice trembling,

"Daoist Master... please, Daoist Master, spare him... No matter how insolent he is, he is my son... I am willing to imprison him for a lifetime... Daoist Master... I beg you... Daoist Master! I am willing to die in his place!"

Of course, Li Jiangzong wasn't worried about three hundred lashes. With his power and Li Suiqing's status as a direct descendant of the main lineage, no one would dare kill him unless the order was explicit execution. He might be crippled, but he would survive. But that single glance from Li Ximing, devoid from any leniency, was effectively a death sentence for Li Suiqing's very being.

At his words, the Light of the Six Harmonies flickering at the Daoist Master's fingertips seemed to react, pulsing with a silent warning, as if ready to leap out and devour someone at any moment. The Daoist Master slowly raised his head, his gaze sweeping over his juniors before finally locking onto Li Jiangzong's eyes.

The man who held power over the Li family's mortal affairs was covered in a cold sweat, yet he dared not break eye contact. Fortunately, the dreaded outcome did not occur. Daoist Master Zhaojing lowered his gaze, concealing the look in his eyes, and shook his head. "You misunderstand. It will resolve itself in three days."

Li Jiangzong shuffled back a step, kowtowing in confusion as he wept.

"Jiangzong thanks the Daoist Master! Jiangzong... Jiangzong has offended... Jiangzong is willing to accept any punishment!"

His words echoed in the hall, prompting a belated Li Zhouda to shut his mouth and kneel as well, unsure of what to say.

Li Ximing showed little amusement. He seemed almost bored by his junior's plea for punishment. He closed his eyes and said flatly,

"Bring me the items I requested. Then all of you, leave."

Li Jiangzong rose with a bow, turned, and took a step to a separate table. He lifted a tray of clothes, knelt respectfully to present it at the Daoist Master's side, and then hastily retreated, pulling the two large doors of the hall shut behind him.

The hall fell instantly silent. Only the gentle flicker of a spiritual lamp cast shifting shadows across Li Ximing's face. The Daoist Master didn't touch the jade tray. He sat motionless, his gaze fixed on the closed doors. After a long while, his eyes slowly shifted, hesitantly landing on the formless Light of the Six Harmonies dancing on his fingertips.

'World's Radiance…'

---

Outside the hall.

The guards had long since been dismissed. Li Jiangzong pressed his hands firmly against the hall doors, confirming that the protective arrays had activated before stepping back and kowtowing three more times.

Li Zhoufang stood silently behind his eldest son, his eyes closed, not knowing what to say. He reached out to take his hand and found it ice-cold, his knuckles white from clenching.

The sky had darkened. Father and son, without a word, supported each other down the steps of the main hall, watched by a wistful Li Zhouda. They walked for a time through the dim corridors and quickly entered a side hall.

Li Jiangzong's steps were rigid.

He noticed that only a single spiritual lamp was lit in the side hall. It stood perfectly in the center, its light not intense but enough to banish all shadows. Every corner, high and low, was clearly visible; even the patterns on the inner wall of an open teapot were sharp and distinct, making his eyes ache.

His father, Li Zhoufang, quickly closed the door. He shut his eyes, and tears streamed down his face.

"It's all my fault..." he lamented. "I never should have brought him here!"

Li Jiangzong seemed not to hear him. He stood frozen for several moments, his eyes vacant. Then, he grabbed his father's hand, squeezing it so tightly that Li Zhoufang winced in pain.

The eldest son took a long time to compose himself. He finally asked in a hesitant, low voice,

"Father, you know me best. You know me better than anyone. When you look at me... when you look at me..."

His pupils dilated, and his voice trembled.

"Do I still seem like Li Jiangzong?"

"Am I still Li Jiangzong?"
