# Chapter 1184: Myriad-Prosperity Heaven

At this, even Li Ximing found himself frowning. He pondered for a long while before sighing.

"In that case, this second method is clearly not ideal. While a lack of sentience has its advantages, the limitations are immense. It would likely only be useful for combat, and even then, it would possess no divine abilities… A Merciful One? Its strength would be limited at best."

When it came down to it, the Li family had no great need for a spiritual god that could only fight. The troubles Li Ximing faced with refining Spiritual Artifacts and certain other arrangements he had envisioned would be difficult to realize this way. After some thought, Li Ximing asked,

"These two methods… they can't be used at the same time, can they?"

Seeing Li Que'wan nod, the Daoist Master spoke softly,

"Then there's no rush. First, integrate your divine abilities. Spend a year or two refining a few portions of Profound Minister Moon Essence to extract the Supreme Yin spiritual essence. In the meantime, I'll deal with this furnace of Horn Wood treasured pills and have Minghuang consume one."

"Once he takes the pill, he can begin repairing his Dharma body. Whether he cultivates spell arts or practices divine abilities, at least he won't be waiting for nothing. After that, we can test this disaster-transmuting pill."

Li Que'wan nodded gently in response.

"I still have the Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure from the Nine Mounds. Its primary purpose is to suppress calamities. With King Wei inside the Grotto-Heaven, disaster cannot trouble him for now, so I will hold onto it to evade scrying."

"Once the Supreme Yin pill is complete and King Wei has taken it, I will use its divine mysteries to help him ward off disaster and avert calamity!"

Li Ximing nodded. A smile touched Li Que'wan's lips as she added,

"With the Grotto-Heaven available, this Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure is freed up. Not only can it evade scrying, but it can also aid in the generation of profundities. I stand to gain considerable benefits by keeping it with me."

Li Ximing nodded again, retrieving the East Life-Mandate Vase of the Azure Manifestation path from within his robes and handing it to her.

"Take a look at this."

Li Que'wan accepted it. With a casual sweep of her silvery divine ability, the entire glazed vase began to glow, overflowing with azure light. The woman nodded.

"A most interesting treasure."

She smiled brilliantly.

"The East Life-Mandate Vase. It harms enemies with Radiant Light, nurtures water with its East Life ability, and bestows the Blessing of Proclamation!"

Li Ximing's suspicions were confirmed.

He sighed, "Just as I thought! In your hands, the Three Shamans and Two Rites reveals another mystery!"

This new 'Proclamation' ability was simple on the surface—a concise blessing art—but its requirements were harsh, needing a cultivator of the Azure Manifestation path to use it. Hearing this, Li Ximing's face lit up with joy. 

"Perfect. Once this period passes, I will drink the refined East Life water, receive this blessing, and then take the final step in my pill refinement."

Li Que'wan said regretfully, "The Blessing of Proclamation is a fleeting mystery. Unless I stand guard over you constantly, it won't last through the entire refinement process. It's most suitable for me to use this mystery on myself while I'm preparing the spiritual materials."

Her tone shifted as she smiled.

"However… the East Life ability isn't so troublesome! The Dao of 'Awaiting the Supreme Divine' upholds the Whole Pill. My divine abilities can not only rapidly convert these Supreme Yin spiritual materials but can also act upon this vase."

As she spoke, a light of lead and mercury poured from her palm, resonating with the Azure Manifestation vase. Instantly, the vessel glowed with a deep, vibrant azure. It took the final step, achieving completion in a sudden burst!

She raised the vase, and a profound light shone forth as the Blessing of Proclamation took effect. For a brief moment, an intensely esoteric light radiated from between Li Ximing's brows. Only then did she return the vase, saying formally,

"This junior will take her leave!"

She then carried the Spiritual Treasure toward the island, clearly intending to enter the Grotto-Heaven and produce the Profound Minister Moon Essence. Li Ximing sat down, took the vase in hand, and contemplated for a moment. He formed a seal, creating a Light of the Six Harmonies.

"Write a letter to Simin," he commanded the light. "Order Li Wushao back to the lake."

With a flick of his finger, he sent the Light of the Six Harmonies speeding toward the province. Only then did he drink the East Life water from the vase in one gulp, seal the grand array, and press both palms upon the alchemy furnace, focusing his full attention on the refinement.

---

The world was a swirling expanse of cloud and mist, a canvas of pure white. A mountain peak drifted into view among the clouds, a tiny Daoist temple dotted upon it like a sesame seed in the snow. Under the howling wind, the temple door rattled faintly.

Behind the tightly shut door was a dim, spartan room with a simple dirt floor. In the center stood a mahogany table, worn with the marks of time. Incense smoke curled endlessly upward from a burner, and fruit offerings sat nearby. On the yellowed wall hung an old painting.

The painting was gray and faded, its colors long lost to time. One could vaguely discern an immortal temple in the background. A Daoist figure stood upon the bluestone ground, his posture erect, his back to the viewer as he faced a stone wall, a sword held in the hand behind him.

Suddenly, a ripple passed over the dirt floor, and an old man materialized from thin air. He shook his head, looking somewhat disheveled. As he took in his surroundings, he immediately fell to his knees and performed the grand ceremony of three bows and nine kowtows before backing out with his head lowered.

"Creeaak…"

The Daoist pushed the door open, and a blizzard roared in, forcing him to squint. His beard whipped in the wind, but his expression was one of deep emotion. He gazed at the sea of clouds for a long moment and sighed.

"I'm finally back!"

He let out a long breath, untied the silk ribbon from his wrist, and fastened the large gourd at his side. Then, shrinking the ground with each step, he descended the mountain. After a hundred paces, the forest turned green, and he saw a young man carrying firewood up the path.

When they met, the youth's expression changed in a flash of joy and surprise. 

"Martial Uncle Wang, you're back!"

Wang Ziya nodded with a smile. The young man hurried forward and circled him, marveling,

"Martial Uncle, you suffered a setback and sought an empty fate… your entire aura is astonishing!"

The old Daoist sighed.

"This is the way of a Left-Hand Path Immortal."

The youth laughed.

"Left-Hand Path? Who cares about that anymore? Whether it’s the grand Heavenly Glow, the somber Underworld, or the direct lineages of the great figures of our age, they all favor this path. Everyone under heaven cultivates it now. _This_ is the righteous path. Us, hiding away in a Grotto-Heaven… we might be the ones on the Left-Hand Path!"

Wang Ziya was silent.

In the past, any such talk from the youth would have earned a sharp rebuke and a roll of the eyes. Now, there was only silence. The youth glanced at him with a smile but suddenly felt awkward.

"This lowly one spoke out of turn…"

Wang Ziya sighed.

"I have read in the ancient texts that the Heavenly Embryo Dao was foul and corrupt, a repulsive sight. Yet from the belly of that demonic embryo was born a Purple and Gold Dao, brimming with immortal energy. I never believed it, but seeing it for myself today… I have no choice but to believe."

"The Divine Dao has collapsed, and the mortal realm has fallen. The Purple and Gold Dao can accomplish what ascetic practices like breathing qi and eating rosy clouds never could. How is that not a righteous path in its own right?"

The youth was stunned. He had always considered his martial uncle to be rigid and old-fashioned. He never imagined that a single trip outside could make his views even more radical than his own. He was speechless. Wang Ziya, however, was resolute.

"Never mind True Monarch Shangyuan. Even the likes of Li Zhouwei, Wei Xuanyin, or even Qi Lanyan and Bai Ziyu… figures like these cannot be nurtured in a thimble-sized Grotto-Heaven!"

The youth fell into silent contemplation. Wang Ziya continued to lead him down the mountain.

"Ever since Xue Linqing distributed treasures and disbanded the Tongxuan Palace, our Dao has been detached from the world for far too long. The more detached we become, the farther we drift from Fruition Attainment. Can't you see the problem? Not everyone is a Wandering Metal! And even the Wandering Metal has thoughts of separation!"

Though the youth did not reply, his expression showed his agreement. Wang Ziya then asked,

"Where is Master?"

The youth replied, "I have received no message. He should still be in Dongmu Heaven."

A cold wind swept through the mountains, setting the pine forest rustling. Beside them, a faceless man in white stood, descending the mountain in perfect sync with them, an attentive listener to their discussion.

But Wang Ziya was completely oblivious. He silently tightened his grip on the Crystalline Jade Branch hidden in his robes, where the speck of Qi Lanyan's True Spirit was concealed.

"No matter… I brought back a disciple-brother for you this time. If all goes well, he will soon be one of us in Myriad-Prosperity Heaven!"

At these words, the white-robed immortal's eyebrows rose. He scanned his surroundings and praised,

"So this is Myriad-Prosperity Heaven!"

This man was none other than Lu Jiangxian.

The great battle on the lake between north and south had ended with Li Zhouwei slaying Qi Lanyan. Though a sliver of Qi Lanyan's True Spirit had escaped into the Crystalline Jade Branch, it had long been recorded by the Name Ascending Stone. Now that Wang Ziya had completed his tasks and brought the artifact into Myriad-Prosperity Heaven, he had unwittingly exposed the Grotto-Heaven to Lu Jiangxian's sight.

'Myriad-Prosperity Heaven… this must be the Grotto-Heaven of the True Monarch of Nurturing Life and Prosperous Treasures, Xu Xiang!'

As far as Lu Jiangxian knew, while many spiritual items of Treasured Earth still existed in the world, most were ancient relics. The Daoist canons all indicated that the Fruition Attainment of Treasured Earth was vacant. Whether True Monarch Xu Xiang had abdicated his position or perished, he was no longer present.

Of course, as one of the earliest disciples of the Three Profoundities Daoist Tradition and one of the most famous figures of the Tongxuan Palace, the True Monarch's cultivation level in his prime was unknown. But if he were still alive today, he would almost certainly be a figure at the Dao Embryo level…

'He likely didn't perish… It’s more probable he reached the Dao Embryo or Origin-Infant stage…'

He followed the pair down the mountain, admiring the scenery. Soon, where the slope gentled, a Daoist temple came into view. Its buildings were mostly low and unadorned. The sound of high-pitched chanting drifted on the wind. Wang Ziya fell silent and led the youth inside with a smile.

The temple was simple, with green brick floors and mahogany beams. The main hall was filled almost exclusively with elders, their white hair a common sight. Each one looked like a lifelong scholar with an otherworldly air, but a scan with his spiritual sense revealed their cultivation to be truly pitiful. The one or two leading the chant were the youngest, appearing to be in their thirties or forties. They cultivated the ancient Immortal Dao and possessed, at most, the cultivation of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Even Lu Jiangxian, observing quietly from the side, couldn't help but sigh at the sight.

These cultivators were the inheritors of the Numinous Treasure Daoist Tradition.

Though Lu Jiangxian appeared to have a physical form, his divine sense was powerful enough to traverse the entire Grotto-Heaven in an instant. This Myriad-Prosperity Heaven was by no means small. As True Monarch Xu Xiang's former traveling palace, it was larger than Anhuai Heaven and Wanling Heaven combined, nearly half the size of the entire Jianghuai region.

And since True Monarch Xu Xiang had commanded the Treasured Earth—the aspect of Earth Virtue responsible for ceaseless growth and nurturing all life—the spiritual qi within the Grotto-Heaven was abundant. Although the Daoists here practiced a policy of simplicity, unlike the Li family's intensive development, the Grotto-Heaven was home to several million souls. It was the most populated Grotto-Heaven he had ever seen, a small world in its own right.

'A Grotto-Heaven with a population and spiritual qi surpassing Moongaze Lake, one that inherited a Dao Embryo-level tradition… yet in a single generation, across all its halls, there are fewer than ten cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm! Below that, there are less than seventy who can use simple Dharma Arts, equivalent to the Embyronic Breathing Realm of the outside world!'

While it was a Dao Embryo tradition, it possessed a respectable number of divine ability cultivators at the Purple Mansion Realm—four in total. But the dearth of mid- and low-level cultivators was terrifying. Moongaze Lake, with a slightly smaller population, could field thousands of Embyronic Breathing cultivators, each capable of casting spells daily for their work, unlike these people who had to concentrate for days just to use a single art.

'Those who can reach the Purple Mansion Realm through the ancient Immortal Dao could have done so with the Purple and Gold Dao as well… A pity for these Foundation Establishment cultivators. If they had walked the Purple and Gold path, who knows how many divine ability masters would have emerged…'

The moment Wang Ziya appeared, the hall erupted. Cries of "Martial Grand-uncle," "Martial Uncle," and "disciple-brother" rose from all sides. Wang Ziya waved his hands dismissively, a complex look in his eyes. In the past, this scene wouldn't have fazed him, but now, with his perspective so altered, he found himself at a loss for words. He let the youth handle the greetings and walked deeper inside, his heart a tangled mess.

He made his way to the deepest part of the palace, where a grand staircase of brownish-yellow jade ascended like a ladder to the heavens, its translucent steps disappearing into the clouds. The old Daoist offered a salute and began the slow climb.

The higher he went, the taller the steps became, until each was the height of a man. Wang Ziya walked for an unknowable amount of time, his divine abilities supporting him, until he finally reached an immortal seat as towering as a mountain.

The seat was carved with intricate patterns, like a great Jade Terrace. Clouds drifted above it, shimmering with rare treasures, immortal flowers, and auspicious mists. On either side, cushions of various colors were arrayed at different heights, as if thousands of lesser immortals were on a pilgrimage to hear the Dharma.

But the vast space was empty. Only Wang Ziya's figure, like a tiny ant, knelt at the base of the Jade Terrace. He took a few steps forward, entering the clouds, and approached an altar-like platform.

Behind a deep curtain there, a figure sat, indistinct but possessing a majestic jeweled visage and an aura like a waterfall. Wang Ziya performed a salute and bowed deeply.

"Greetings, Dao Rector," he said, his voice heavy.

From within, a divine ability stirred, and a white light flared, seeming to peer at him through the layers of fabric. There was no reply.

Wang Ziya kowtowed. He took out the tightly wrapped Crystalline Jade Branch of the Wu Earth Dao from his robes and placed it before the altar. Then he produced a small, brown ceramic urn. The fist-sized vessel was sealed shut with a ceramic lid and red lacquer, impervious even to spiritual sense.

He set both items down and returned to his kneeling position. Only then did a serene, solemn, and profound voice echo forth.

"How fairs the mortal realm?"

The voice reverberated through the heavens, impossibly lofty. Wang Ziya kept his head bowed.

"It has the air of heroes," he replied respectfully.

The words were clearly unexpected. The light behind the curtain wavered, and the profound voice spoke again.

"The one who went out before you was your Martial Grand-uncle. The age of chaos had just settled, and the suffering of the people was immense. He wept without end, as if their pain were his own. He said to this Venerable One: 'The Purple and Gold Dao is rampant, the Underworld plunders for its own gain, and the myriad paths sow chaos, feigning sacred rites. Dynasties rise and fall in a blink, false authorities ruling over the vast central plains, turning the land foul with their stench. Thus, slaughter is everywhere, and the names of gods and immortals are defiled.'"

The Majestic Jeweled Visage behind the curtain shook its head slightly.

"I never imagined that in your eyes, it would have 'the air of heroes'."

"Martial Grand-uncle was not wrong," the old Daoist on the floor said, his voice fearless. He raised his head, his gaze clear and bright.

"But this junior also has something to say."

"The north and south stand opposed, the Heavenly Glow shepherds an emperor, the various powers are aligning, and ambition runs rampant. The noble houses of True Qi raise their halls of war, and the fertile lands of Jianghuai once more march under the banner of Wei. Thus, flood dragons and serpents lie hidden, preparing to ascend upon the clouds!"

"Dao Rector, an age of chaos is coming!"
