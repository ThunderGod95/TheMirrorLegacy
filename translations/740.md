# Chapter 740: A Detailed Account

"I see."

Changyun was the one holding the fishing rod, so of course, he knew the situation best. Hearing his explanation, Li Ximing understood that these Purple Mansion cultivators only answered what they were asked. If he failed to consider every angle, he would have no right to a share of the spoils.

"So, the Hurricane Ghost Yin Dao lineage from Wenhu is in my hands," Li Ximing said. "And you, fellow Daoist, have been cultivating Pingwang Zi in preparation for opening the formation. It seems I'll have to raise one of my own people for this."

Changyun let out a hearty laugh. "That's easily settled. The Wenhu you have... he once searched the Southern Sea for a Secret Diffusion Dao lineage on behalf of the Capital immortals Dao... This was before the Capital immortals Dao had even entered Jiangbei, yet their search had already begun! It's clear they've been plotting this for a long time..."

Li Ximing's eyes narrowed slightly. "Oh? And what was the result?" he asked, looking up.

"They found another with the Floating Cloud Body! The Capital immortals Dao kept it under a thousand layers of secrecy, and very few people know about it. I only learned of it when I overheard another Daoist mention it in passing. In the end, they didn't gain much... but the person who obtained the lineage was thoroughly deceived by Wenhu and ultimately perished, his Dao erased! It's likely every secret art he possessed was tricked out of him!"

Li Ximing knew Wenhu was no simple character. By his calculations, the Floating Cloud Cave had been an ally of the Golden Tang Gate, which meant it was part of the Golden Feather Sect's share. Now that the sect had been annihilated, the matter was complicated.

"These three Dao lineages... how many factions are dividing them?" he asked.

Changyun seemed to see right through his concerns. "The Golden Feather Sect already claimed the Floating Cloud Body lineage; it was one of their own disciples who was cultivating it. The Empty Response Dispersion is Pingwang Zi's technique, so that share is mine... And the Hurricane Ghost Yin belongs to the Capital immortals Dao, who also possess a Floating Cloud Body. A few other factions have been waiting quietly in the wings, but the situation is now uncertain."

He glanced at Li Ximing and smiled. "It's not as if only one person can claim a share from each lineage. The Xiaoshi Spirit Trove was prepared by the former Secret Diffusion Temple for its descendants. Any Foundation Establishment cultivator who has practiced the lineage can go and try their luck. The size of one's share depends on the individual. A single powerful direct heir is worth more than ten useless fools."

"Fortunately, this opportunity has fallen into our hands," Changyun added. "It benefits our own people and can be considered a money tree."

Clarity dawned in Li Ximing's mind.

'So many opportunities... so many schemes. The Xiaoshi Spirit Trove of Secret Diffusion can only be entered by those who possess its Dao lineages, so it has become a treasure basin for several major powers...'

Having pieced together the cause and effect, Li Ximing finally asked, "I've often heard that the Secret Diffusion Temple had a powerful backer. Do you know which one it was?"

This was apparently not a great secret. "Secret Diffusion is a remnant of the Wanling Upper Sect," Changyun explained. "The Wanling Upper Sect was a power on the level of the Three Sects, and to this day, its Grotto-Heaven remains hidden within the Great Void."

"Ah!" Li Ximing understood immediately. "But given Secret Diffusion's background, won't stirring up such trouble lead to disaster?"

Changyun shook his head gently, but it was Minghui who chuckled. "Daoist Zhaojing! How can you be certain... that this wasn't a method left behind by the Secret Diffusion Temple to ensure its own continuation? Year after year, if one of these cultivators truly reaches the Purple Mansion realm, or if some unforeseen event allows them to escape the control of the Daoist Masters... wouldn't they have a perfectly legitimate claim to monopolize the Secret Diffusion Spirit Trove on Mount Xiaoshi? With such a golden, profound background, a prestigious banner, and a foundational Dao... would they not desire it after attaining the Purple Mansion? Could they simply ignore the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage?"

Li Ximing grew thoughtful. Changyun also smiled. "Daoist Minghui is correct. Although gathering all five Dao lineages would yield a great harvest, opening the spirit trove is impossible without the Purple Mansion Divine Ability of the Secret Diffusion lineage. We have divided the trove's contents several times and scoured it clean, but the remaining Purple Mansion section requires a much longer-term strategy. It's not something to be taken lightly."

With a clear picture in his mind, Li Ximing began to plan his next steps. After offering his thanks, Daoist Master Changyun said, "There is no need for such formalities! I think very highly of the boy Zhong Qian. He has forged a bond with your esteemed clan through Ning Tiaoxiao, and there will be many opportunities for mutual support in the future."

Li Ximing exchanged a few more pleasantries, listening as the two discussed who had broken through to the Purple Mansion realm and who had accumulated enough merit to become a Merciful One. Just as he was about to take his leave, Minghui spoke with great enthusiasm. "My Lotus Temple is just across the river! If the Daoist Master has any need for anything in the north, you must come find me!"

Changyun, taking this in, sipped his tea and said with a hidden smile, "I say... Daoist Minghui, you are a Merciful One and exceptionally skilled in the arts of calculation. Why not perform a divination for our fellow Daoist and offer him some tangible assistance?"

The words struck Minghui like a blow, and he gritted his teeth, a sharp pain stabbing at his heart.

'Divination? Divination my ass... You want me to risk my life with your constant 'divine this, divine that'... You sure have a lot to say!'

Though he desperately wanted to slap Changyun, he forced a dry laugh. "I cannot simply perform a divination on a fellow Daoist directly, and I fear he would not be at ease allowing me to do so..."

There was some truth to this. Li Ximing harbored no goodwill toward any of them and had already intended to refuse. He followed Minghui's lead and demurred. After several more cups of tea, he grew tired of their polite maneuvering and excused himself.

He had just stepped out of the pavilion when he saw the monk Minghui emerging as well. Unwilling to get entangled, Li Ximing stepped into the Great Void, but Minghui followed him.

"Daoist Zhaojing! Might I be so bold as to say one more thing?" Minghui called out, catching up to him in the void.

Since the other man had pursued him so persistently, Li Ximing felt he couldn't just keep avoiding him. "Great Master Minghui," he replied, "what can I do for you?"

"It is just one matter," Minghui said. "A friend of this humble monk has obtained a Dao lineage and wishes to become a Merciful One. To do so, he must construct a grand temple, a luxurious Dharma Treasure, but he lacks a single ingredient: Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, which is produced in the Southern Borderlands of the Azure Pond Sect... Si Boxiu despises Buddhists, making it difficult for me to go there. You, fellow Daoist, have connections in the Azure Pond Sect. If you have the chance, I would be grateful if you could keep an eye out for it..."

Li Ximing, curious to see if the monk could cross the river, traveled alongside him through the Great Void and gave a noncommittal reply.

Minghui continued, "My Lotus Temple is, after all, in the north. I have a Bright Yang Spirit Embryo. If you can acquire the wood, I am willing to trade it."

Li Ximing still did not trust the monk. Even with the mention of a Bright Yang Spirit Embryo, his response remained perfunctory. As they neared the Funan region, Minghui abruptly changed the subject. "I mentioned a divination earlier. It was not my intention to slight you, but I knew you would not permit me to perform one. How about this: instead of a disciple or a blood relative, choose a retainer with no significant connection to you. The divination will be easier and more detailed for me, and it will not put you in too difficult a position!"

Li Ximing glanced down at the land below. The Funan region was densely populated, and all these people were in Jiangbei. Whether he agreed or not, Minghui could perform a divination on them at will. "If that is the case," he said cautiously, "and you wish to perform a divination yourself, I have no reason to stop you."

He didn't dare let him divine An Siwei, who was currently his highest priority. Instead, he chose the person with the most tenuous connection. "My clan has an old retainer... his name is Qu Bushi."

Minghui's gaze pierced through the Great Void. With just a name, he located the man. He first calculated the man's Dharma artifacts to gauge the karmic consequences of the divination, and only when he was certain it was safe did he proceed to divine the man himself.

"He nurtures his life and preserves his years, growing stronger with age," Minghui said thoughtfully. "His fate is constrained by Pit Water, preventing him from taking a leading role, but he is a useful retainer."

Li Ximing, however, was paying attention to Minghui's position. Just as he'd expected, the monk stopped at the river's edge.

"I will see you this far."

With that, Minghui vanished into the Great Void. Only then did Li Ximing ponder his words.

'That monk was surprisingly courteous. Qu Bushi is ultimately just a retainer. His Art of the Palace of Concealed Storage excels at self-preservation, and he still has many years left to live. In the future, he'll become another elder like An Zheyan.'

Descending from the sky, Li Ximing found himself with a rare moment of leisure. Instead of returning to Gardenia Scenery Mountain, he flew toward the island.

In the center of the island's vast courtyard stood a white flowering tree, over thirty zhang tall. Its leaves were so glossy they appeared transparent, casting no shade beneath. The tree was dotted with palm-sized, five-petaled spirit flowers, their colors a mixture of crimson and white.

The Wanling Flower Tree!

Seated cross-legged beneath the tree was an old ape with snow-white fur, clad in simple stone armor with a staff resting on its knees. As Li Ximing approached, the White Ape opened its eyes, stood, and bowed respectfully. "Greetings, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing nodded. The White Ape's first task upon joining the Li clan had been to guard the Wanling Flower, a duty he had now performed for over seventy years. After the great battle on the river, he had returned here to recuperate and continue his watch.

Li Ximing gazed at the Wanling Flower Tree. Over the years, his clan had harvested at least eight hundred, if not a thousand, spirit stones from its flowers, not to mention the cultivators whose lives had been saved by it... even Miaoshui had relied on it just a few days ago!

"Even the scraps that fall from the fingers of a Golden Core immortal's descendant have benefited my clan immeasurably!"

On the other side of the courtyard stood another tree, this one the size of an ordinary tree. It was a Spirit Persimmon Tree, suffused with spiritual energy. It had been twisting and swaying in its corner, but the moment it saw Li Ximing looking over, it froze.

This was, of course, the Spirit Persimmon he had dug up from the Quanwu Mountains. Though its roots were ordinary, this Qi Refining-level tree had been blessed with no small amount of fortune. It had already become a spirit, possessing a cultivation base. It would occasionally nibble on spirit herbs and sip spirit water, and had now reached the mid-stage of the Qi Refining realm.

The Li clan also had a Snake-Dragon Fruit Tree, but it was of a lower grade and was kept in the island's spirit garden.

After observing them, Li Ximing retrieved a box from his sleeve and casually opened it. Inside lay a brilliant golden tassel needle of Horn Woodthe Horn Wood Golden Tassel gifted by the Sword Gate!

"This is an excellent item for nourishing spirit plants..."

The moment the box was opened, the Wanling Flower Tree began to stir. The Spirit Persimmon in the corner dropped its pretense and stretched its branches over, not daring to touch Li Ximing, but tugging furtively at the White Ape.

Li Ximing infused his divine ability into the tassel. With a wave of his hand, he broke the Horn Wood Golden Tassel apart, guiding the fragments with the Profound Light to shower down upon the two spirit plants, causing them to rustle with delight.

Li Ximing knew nothing of horticulture. He left the two plants in the White Ape's care and departed.

He landed on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. A short while later, a youth dressed in pleated, dark-red robes descended on a trail of Radiant Fire. He walked up from the mountain path, arrived at the courtyard, and bowed.

"Jiangqian pays his respects to the Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing had rarely seen Li Jiangqian. He beckoned him closer, offering a warm smile to the junior to whom he had bestowed a Talisman Seed. "Jiangqian is here. Why do I not see Que Wan?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master," Li Jiangqian replied, "my sister has encountered a bottleneck in her arts and has gone to the Northern Yue to collect shamanic techniques. She was unable to come. This junior has come up the mountain to deliver a message on my father's orders."

"Speak."

As Li Ximing poured tea, Li Jiangqian began his report. "The Wu Clan from the south of the Lixia prefecture came to visit a few days ago. Their peak Foundation Establishment patriarch came personally with a gift to thank you, Daoist Master, for eliminating demonic cultivators when you passed by their lands. Father was unaware of this matter and sent me to ask."

Li Ximing knew exactly what had happened. He sipped his tea. "I was fighting Yehui and happened to pass by the Wu Clan's territory. The light of my escape technique probably incinerated one or two of those demonic cultivators. Yehui, who was following behind, likely manifested his own divine ability and crushed a few Wu clansmen in the process. This Wu patriarch certainly knows how to use a bigger banner to his advantage. He's quite shrewd."

Li Jiangqian understood immediately. He showed no fear in the Daoist Master's presence. "I see. We have a Retainer Wu in Profound Peak who is related to the southern Wu Clan. He has been insufferably proud about this..."

"Just explain it clearly to your father."

"The Shanji Prefecture has been attacked several times recently," Li Jiangqian continued. "We were unable to defend the area, and a significant amount of resources were plundered. We also lost a town..."

This did not surprise Li Ximing. The Shanji Prefecture was a burden in their hands. "How is your father handling it?" he asked.

"Father has already begun relocating the people of Shanji to populate the wilderness," Li Jiangqian reported respectfully. "The morale of Profound Peak has not collapsed, and with our clan's support, many prominent families and even aristocratic clans are willing to move. Aside from the Sword Gate's territory, which has been left largely untouched, most of the common folk have begun their journey. Father sees this as a matter of great importance and is personally escorting them..."

"Good." Li Ximing nodded. "It is almost certain that Profound Peak will have to rebuild its foundation in the wilderness. This is a necessary task. Leave it to your father."

He paused for a moment, then asked with a somewhat inscrutable tone, "How is Chengzhi these days?"

His eldest son, Li Chengzhi, was a mortal. Li Ximing had seen him once after reaching the Purple Mansion realm. He had been with his early-stage Qi Refining grandson, Li Zhouming. Both were timid and sweating profusely. Li Chengzhi's hair and beard were completely white, and he hadn't dared to look his father in the eye. He had come up, made a brief circle, and quickly left.

Although Li Zhouming was a cultivator and had been sent to the clan by his father at an early age, Li Ximing's successive periods of seclusion meant they had rarely met. Yet, due to a deeper understanding and fear of the Purple Mansion realm, his behavior had been even worse than his father's.

At Li Ximing's question, Li Jiangqian answered promptly, "Clan Elder Chengzhi is advancing in years and is no longer very active. Clan Uncle Zhouming is currently serving in the Dense Forest Mountains..."

Li Ximing knew there wasn't much good Li Jiangqian could say. Although he was not close to his eldest son, Li Chengzhi was at least thoughtful. His lack of cultivation was his fatal flaw. As for Li Zhouming, Li Ximing had met him himself and knew him to be a truly mediocre child, with a somewhat greedy nature. The fact that Li Jiangqian didn't speak ill of him was already a show of respect; there was certainly nothing worth praising.

His expression unchanging, Li Ximing lowered his gaze slightly. "Let them be. Chengzhi is getting old and may not be able to control Zhouming at times. Do not let them think I am paying them special attention, lest it encourages him to do something foolish."

Li Jiangqian had thought Li Ximing's inquiry was a subtle request to look after them, but hearing this, he could only nod in agreement. A realization dawned on him.

'The Daoist Master is not entirely unconcerned with the clan... These few words strike at the very heart of the two elders' situations. It would be impossible to be so precise without paying some attention...'

Li Ximing waved him away, his mind already turning to other calculations.

'There are three urgent matters at hand. First, the Purple Mansion grand formation. I must wait for news and observe the changes. Second, resolve the issue with the Shanji Prefecture and properly garrison Profound Peak... And third... I must settle things with Yehui, to stop him from constantly working against my clan.'
