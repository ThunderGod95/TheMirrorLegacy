# Chapter 915: Clan Brother

The setting sun was like blood.

The blood on the ground slowly congealed. In the twilight, the residual light of a great array flickered. A man stood against the wind, draped in black robes, his hair a grizzled white. He was covered in blood. Though his thin beard gave him a serious, proper appearance, his face was a mask of utter ruthlessness, savage and
fierce.

His grey-black eyes reflected the blood-red sunset. Before him, the golden alms bowl magnified once more. The man had no choice but to raise his Dharma sword and meet it with a heavy blow.

"Clang!"

The black-robed man felt his arms go heavy. His head swam, and blood trickled from his nose. A medley of acrid, sweet, and bitter tastes rose in his throat. He couldn't stop a cough, spattering his robes with a fresh spray of blood.

"Sir!"

A voice echoed by his ear. The black-robed man forced himself to turn his head. Not far away, he saw his younger clan brother kneeling, vomiting blood.

His vision blurred, the scene pulsing near and far. The golden light in the sky intensified, growing so bright that Li Chenghao could no longer keep his eyes open.

At this moment, Li Chenghao knew all hope of survival was gone. He looked down at the blood on his robes, took a step back, and drove his Dharma sword into the earth, using it to prop himself up.

The man's robes, heavy with gore, no longer billowed in the wind. They clung to him, sticky and cold. He leaned heavily on the sword, a thought drifting through his haze:

‘How far have the Buddhist cultivators broken through… Is Li Minggong still safe…’

Of the family's direct line, Li Minggong was the one Tinglan had specifically instructed Wen Wu to place in the rear. Li Chenghao, a mere Qi Refining cultivator with poor talent, would naturally never have registered on Tinglan's radar.

Even so, Wen Wu had considered his placement, stationing him in the distant south, far from Luoxia, traveling with Fei Qing'yi. But it was a cruel twist of fate. Xiaoshi Mountain had been breached, exposing their position. The Purple Smoke Gate disciples stationed there had been annihilated. Fei Qing'yi had fled. Countless were dead or wounded, leaving only these few.

Through his stupor, Li Chenghao noticed the Buddhist cultivator opposite him hadn't seized the opportunity to attack. Instead, the man looked... vexed. This annoyance sent a jolt of alarm through Li Chenghao.

As a leader of the Yuandu branch and the paternal uncle of Li Zhoufang, Li Chenghao's status was not low. He simply didn't have an ingratiating personality. If one had to be precise, he could call Li Ximing 'Seventh Uncle'. After Li Ximing’s own son, Li Chengzhi, had died, Li Chenghao was, in fact, the closest male relative in that branch of the Chengming lineage. He had received no shortage of favors from them growing up.

A deep chill flooded his heart, snapping him to a dreadful clarity.

‘The Buddhist cultivators have endless methods. This will surely implicate my family… I must die quickly!’

He drew his sword. But the golden bowl flashed like lightning, smashing violently against the Dharma sword in his hand.

Sparks flew. Li Chenghao spat a mouthful of blood, nearly collapsing. He tried to circulate his dharma power, but the heavy golden light from the sky suppressed it, scattering it before it could even gather.

Li Chenghao’s hesitation was all it took. The Buddhist cultivator facing his clan brother attacked. Li Chengpan, who was beside him, was in even worse shape. He raised his spear horizontally, but the cultivator's staff struck it dead center. With a thud, Li Chengpan knelt, blood gushing from his mouth.

The blow didn't kill Li Chengpan, but it shocked Li Chenghao awake. A terrible thought struck him:

‘Chengpan's talent is a bit higher than mine, but he's cowardly and hesitant. He's not even as resolute as Zhouluo...’

Years ago, when Li Zhouluo was managing the clan, Li Chengpan had been wrongly accused. Li Chenghao would have stood up for any clan member, but Li Chengpan had been so moved that he had followed him ever since, respecting him as an elder brother. After all these years, how could Li Chenghao not know his measure?

‘He's grateful, yes,’ Li Chenghao thought, ‘but can gratitude overcome the fear of death? Will he... turn?’

He forced his body, which felt as if it were shattering inch by inch, to move. He lunged forward. But the golden bowl tore through the air again. It smashed against his Dharma sword. With a sharp, metallic crack, the weather-beaten dharma artifact finally broke.

"Clink..."

The sound of the blade hitting the ground was painfully clear. Li Chenghao was left holding a hilt with half a broken blade. He staggered back, retreating to Li Chengpan’s side. He dimly saw the younger man's blood-streaked profile as the youth choked out:

"Sir!"

Li Chenghao hesitated for just one fatal second. A golden light flashed before his eyes. The world spun. A colossal pain exploded in the back of his head, as if all his strength had been ripped away. He fell heavily to the ground.

Light streamed across the sky as a baleful aura roiled. Two figures, one black and one gold, descended. A devil-lord, clad in silver-black armor, trod upon the churning miasma. The Merciful One, shimmering with brilliant light, sat upon a pink-green lotus throne.

The world changed color. The rolling golden light blocked out the blood-red setting sun. Master Monks materialized in the air on both sides, their gazes fixed on the scene.

Li Chenghao swallowed the blood in his mouth and struggled to his feet. He heard the Merciful One in the sky laugh.

"We caught a Ning family member earlier, but only one. It seems our fates were shallow. Xuwang took him. Now, finding these two... this is an unexpected delight!"

Li Chenghao’s heart sank. In the distance, the other captured cultivators were already kneeling, many looking profoundly relieved. Nearby, Li Chengpan had dropped his spear, kneeling blankly.

The sky-borne Nuxiao laughed. "By thr great karmic affinity, allowing you to see the Way of Radiance and Great Desire! You are being turned from evil to righteousness. Why do you not bow and give thanks!"

"Dong..."

As her words fell, a deep, lingering bell tone sounded from afar. Cries of begging and gratitude rose from all around. Li Chengpan, weeping rivers of tears, slowly lowered his head, though he said nothing.

The Merciful One nodded, a look of gratification on his face.

The Buddhist cultivators had converted many; how could they not see the signs? True, sudden submission was rare. Most people were simply indecisive. A lowered head, a moment of silence, a flicker of hesitation... these were ambiguous acts, but the rest would always follow naturally.

Li Chengpan’s hands trembled. He could no longer find the strength to rise.

Suddenly, his collar tightened. An intense, icy sensation flooded him, as if something had struck the back of his head. Golden light flared. He heard a voice, ragged with a grief so profound it was like the cuckoo weeping blood:

"Get up!"

His grey-white hair wild, Li Chenghao’s dharma power was completely bound, leaving him as weak as a mortal. The broken sword he had tried to stab into the back of Li Chengpan’s head had been blocked by the golden light, the impact merely knocking the younger man forward. The old man could bear no more. The hilt fell from his hand with a clatter. He collapsed, roaring:

"Li Chengpan! Get up!"

His expression was as hard as stone, as resolute as the day on Mount Qingdu when he had shielded Li Chengpan from the clan. But now, it was overlaid with an icy chill, a bone-deep hatred, a heart-tearing anguish. Dark red blood trickled from his trembling lips.

"Li Chengpan!"

Li Chengpan, too, was just as he had been years ago. Kneeling. Silent. Weeping. Only his hands shook.

Tears blurred the young man's vision. The whispering clan elders from that day, seated in their great chairs, dissipated like smoke. They were replaced by the stern, standing figures of Buddhist devils—just as high, just as mighty, pressing down on him until he couldn't utter a single word. He didn't even dare to look back at the old man roaring behind him.

In the sky, Nuxiao cackled, deeply satisfied. Her pupils reflected the shimmering golden light as the legion of Master Monks began to chant sutras. Auspicious clouds gathered, and a droning hum filled the air as some great ritual began.

"First lose, then gain; only then is desire released. First gain, then lose; only then is the heart understood…"

As the chant rose, the distant bell was joined by the dense, rhythmic sound of wooden fish, drawing nearer. Li Chengpan's heart suddenly grew calm. The sound dulled his grief and filled the bottomless pit of his fear. It seeped into his very marrow, never to be removed.

He pressed his palms together and quietly bowed his head. The wind swept back his dark hair. There, in the radiant golden light, he found a sanctuary for his guilt.

Behind him, the old man thrashed on the ground like a dying fish. The distant wooden fish, rather than calming his fury, only inflamed it, making him more savage. It made his eyes spit a fiery, crimson venom that trickled from the corners of his eyes.

‘Your father died young, Li Chengpan! I was the one who supported you! You were like *my son*! And today, you surrender to the Buddhists! You were framed, and no one dared to speak. I was the one who, risking being dragged down by Li Xixuan, protected you before all the elders! And today, you surrender to the Buddhists! You betray all my care, betray all my support! You animal! I curse my own soft-heartedness! You have left me with no honor in life, and you deny me peace in death!’

Amidst the thudding wooden fish, Li Chenghao’s body began to twist. His blood-flecked beard lengthened. His body seemed to writhe, as if countless rats were moving under his skin. One moment he sprouted hooves, the next, scales; then, a forked tongue. He became a crouching, venomous creature, hopping erratically on the ground.

The chanting from the sky grew heavier. Someone shouted:

"Li Chengpan! The time has come to subdue this venomous creature, to sweep away your past and sever your mortal ties!"

Li Chengpan turned. Inside the old man’s empty robes, there was only a hateful, mindless creature. He grabbed the creature by its head and ran his other hand down its skin-bag, tearing away the extra, twisted limbs. Green blood pooled on the ground. With tears streaming down his face, he cried:

"Clan Brother!"

The cry was heart-wrenching, piercing the air like a suona. Li Chengpan's eyes, usually so cowardly and anxious, were suddenly clear. His back straightened. The venomous creature, as if struck by lightning, instantly lost its evil nature. Its demonic heart was pacified. It hung limply on him, dazed. Its scales began to glow with a golden light.

Li Chengpan pressed his palms together and bowed again. "Today, I have seen the true and bright Dharma and swept away the vexations of the six roots. I vow to follow you, my lord, and cultivate the true fruit."

The Merciful One laughed, overjoyed. "Wrong! Wrong! I never expected such profound fate. You are truly meant for my Great Desire. We must take you, fellow Daoist, to the Buddhist Land at once! We must see the great lord and ask if there is a place reserved for you!"

The sky filled with laughter.

"Wonderful! Wonderful!"

"He has seen the truth! He has broken through!"

But amid the joyous golden light, only Helian Wumeng’s face was dark. His hand tightened on his long-handled glaive, causing the Spiritual Artifact to hum. A grim light entered his eyes, and he looked utterly repulsed.

‘He is an Imperial descendant, after all…’

Although he himself had planned on capturing Li family members to trade for spiritual treasures, there were lines to be drawn. You either killed them, or you traded them back. Their ancestor had been one of the world's foremost figures. How could you torment them like this? His gaze turned icy.

"Nuxiao!" he snapped. "Did you invite me here just to watch this?"

Nuxiao faltered, forcing a smile. "I thought this might help you vent your anger, fellow Daoist…"

Helian Wumeng had indeed suffered a setback on the north shore, but he prided himself on being a man of stature. This... this was beneath him. He laughed, a cold, furious sound.

"Ridiculous!"

"Sir, please wait!" Nuxiao hurried to stop him, her smile obsequious. "Lord Wujiang is currently at my Maha's side, discussing the Dharma. Why don't you join them?"

At this, Helian Wumeng frowned, wondering what she was scheming. "Oh?"

Nuxiao smiled. "Don't be fooled because their array looks strong, as if it will take ages to crack. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is about to retreat! Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain will soon be ours!"

***

On the north shore, the clouds hung low and heavy. Streaks of light flew back from the north, cutting brilliant trails through the air before landing nearby.

"Clan Brother!"

A man in black robes stood waiting in the wind. He exuded a golden aura, his features dignified, one hand lightly tapping the hilt of his sword. Beside him, a woman in gorgeous robes, possessing a clear, refined beauty, smiled as she looked over with him.

The man he called 'Clan Brother' looked sincere and honest, and was clearly much older. He was being supported by a tall youth, a contrast that only made his own steady temperament seem heavier. His face, however, was pale. He looked back at the greeters and sighed.

"Zhouluo is back..."

"I was in the Azure Pond region and heard news of demon cultivators on the north shore, so I hurried over," said Li Zhouluo, the man in black. "I didn't expect the family to have already resolved it. And with such a joyous event! Congratulations on your triumphant return, Clan Brother..."

Li Zhouluo had been waiting nearby on the lake. When the family sent out a distress signal, his wife, Pang Yunqing, had just come out of seclusion. He brought her along, partly to lend the family aid, and partly to see everyone.

The joy on his face was genuine, without a trace of jealousy. With Li Zhouwei breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, their family was now an Immortal Clan with two such masters. This was a tremendous blessing for him and his descendants. How could he not be happy, especially when it was his own clan brother who had advanced?

But while his heart was full of joy, the man before him showed no sign of happiness. Hearing the congratulations, Li Zhoufang forced a smile. His face was filled with desperate hope as he asked:

"Have you seen Uncle on your way back? I’ve asked several times, but I haven't received any answer... Perhaps I should ask the Daoist Master..."

The 'Uncle' he meant was, of course, Li Chenghao. The 'Daoist Master' was not Li Ximing, who had yet to show himself, but Li Zhouwei, who was cultivating in the lake.

Ever since the incident on Mount Qingdu, Li Zhouluo, though always smiling, had held a poor opinion of Li Chenghao. Still, for such a major issue to be raised, he was taken aback.

"Uncle didn't return with you? I... I don't know where the Daoist Master is. It wouldn't be right to disturb him..."

He didn't know the specific arrangements—that Li Chenghao had been with Fei Qing'yi, from whom all contact had been lost. His first instinct was simply to avoid bothering Li Zhouwei. Listening from the side, Chen Yang broke into a cold sweat. He quickly stepped forward and said in a low, comforting voice:

"Even if there's no news, the Daoist Master has surely made arrangements..."

Li Zhoufang had been simmering with anxiety for too long and finally lost control. He covered his face and wept. "You only say nice things! I've asked, but I'm not allowed to see the Daoist Master! My uncle is lost somewhere out there—how could he still be alive! Besides his sister, Uncle has no other siblings who care! The elders are all on the lake. If we juniors don't keep asking, who in this whole mountain will even remember him!"

At these words, Li Zhouluo fell silent, lowering his head and hiding his hands in his sleeves. Beside him, Pang Yunqing, dressed in her green robes, immediately raised an eyebrow at him. The atmosphere became utterly still.

Fortunately, a streak of purple lightning split the sky. With a roll of dull thunder, a burly man descended, landing on the path. It was Li Zhouda.

He had received Li Chenghui’s legacy and had been brushed by the recent battle. But not only was he unharmed, he had distinguished himself with great merit. He was in high spirits as he cupped his hands.

"Brothers! The Purple Smoke cultivators have escorted us this far. The northern cultivators are watching us like tigers. Please, return to the lake at once, before something terrible happens..."
