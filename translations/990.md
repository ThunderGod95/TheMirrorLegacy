# Chapter 990: Si and Ning: To Stay or To Go

Si Yuanli smiled bitterly inwardly. He paused for a moment, his expression shifting to one of deep emotion.

"How could I possibly look down on you, Daoist Friend? The awe you inspired by reaching the Purple Mansion Realm in a mere ten years... I was consumed with envy back then. Knowing you are a person of such caliber, how could I cling to old perceptions?"

This middle-aged man had achieved his Purple Mansion Realm late in life. He looked even older and more weathered than Li Ximing. Stroking his beard, he continued:

"I am simply not like you, Daoist Friend, able to place your 'Bright Yang' pawn so early in the game. My current situation is... awkward. I am merely here to test the waters."

Li Ximing knew the 'Bright Yang' he referred to was Li Jiangliang, who was currently at Yang Zhuo's side. He understood Si Yuanli suspected his family had boarded the Underworld's ship long ago. He merely sipped his tea, saying nothing, as Si Yuanli continued:

"As for the Azure Pond... no matter what state it ends up in, it remains right on your clan's doorstep. If it's handled well, it not only stabilizes the situation but also prevents needless slaughter. It is a major affair for the peace of the common people."

Li Ximing shook his head inwardly. 'I'm not part of the Yang family... What's the use in asking me?'

He let out a heavy sigh and said in a low voice, "Daoist Friend, who truly controls the present situation? Do you think it's my Moongaze Lake? My family's position is even more awkward than yours. We have no intention of trying to 'balance' the Yue State."

This made Si Yuanli fall into thought. He took a sip of tea, his confusion evident. "Then... we just let it be? I fear we'll be burned if the fire spreads..."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow, his expression turning serious. "Daoist Friend, have you any intention of leaving the mainland? If you truly wish to have a proper discussion, let's stop beating around the bush. We can speak frankly about what clues Senior Yuanxiu left behind. There's no need for any more probing."

At these words, Si Yuanli choked, then shook his head decisively. "I have no such plans."

He paused, his tone melancholic. "Since you have asked, Daoist Friend, I will be clear."

"More than sixty years ago, just after Anhuai Heaven fell, my family's old ancestor issued a command: any young, talented cultivator practicing True Qi within the Azure Pond's jurisdiction was to be reported immediately. This order was of the highest priority, with dedicated personnel assigned to it. It was only rescinded after his fall..."

Li Ximing nodded silently, listening to Si Yuanli sigh. "Thinking back on it now, His Lordship must have foreseen this, or at least suspected it. Why else would he issue such a command?"

His expression was distant. "Since ancient times, nine out of ten who achieve Fruition Attainment do so by riding the tides of the world. Even a genius capable of weaving the heavens and earth or establishing their own Dao cannot escape this. Back then, when His Lordship ascended to the Profound Rank, the nature of the 'Jade True' position was clarified. The moment 'True Qi' descended, he knew this day would come."

"He often taught me: 'Entering the Dao is like choosing a master; cultivation requires seizing the opportune moment.' This is the directive my ancestor left for me: to preserve ourselves on the mainland, and nothing more than to not interfere with the Yang Clan!"

His expression was grave, revealing his resolve. "My Sima Family has migrated from north to south, moving countless times, but we have rarely left the mainland. We have always produced figures who could command the winds and clouds, all thanks to this one family precept. You are right, Daoist Friend. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator can be a pawn. But even a True Monarch won't kill a Daoist Master for no reason. Those at the Purple Mansion Realm have the right to pick a side. The only risk is picking the _wrong_ side!"

"Even if we pick the wrong side, we won't lose our lives so easily! But to pick _no_ side? To quietly take my clansmen and leave the Azure Pond? What would that make my Sima Family? If either side decided to settle accounts, would I still be left alive?"

Li Ximing's face showed deep contemplation. He watched Si Yuanli silently as the man continued in a heavy voice:

"Back in the day, the Gao Clan, the Helian Clan, even my own Sima Family during the Ning State era... did we pick the right side? Not necessarily. But when the dust settled, we still retained our status as King-Marquis and immortal sects."

"Even the Chen Clan of Mausoleum Valley—if they had just been willing to lower their heads back then instead of choosing death to prove their resolve, they would still be active in the Yue State today. But the Su family and the Lin family, who retreated from the mainland... is there any word of them now?"

He laughed, his face hardening with decisiveness. "Today, Daoist Master Ning Wan is trapped in her position at the Azure Pond, shielding me from disaster. If I still don't dare to make a gamble, I would be failing the charge of my ancestor. The Underworld wants to take the Yue State; how can they do so without assistance? My Dao lineage is complete, my inheritance orderly. This makes me all the more appealing to them!"

'Preserve ourselves on the mainland...'

Li Ximing pondered this, largely grasping Si Yuanli's line of thought.

'It seems that ever since Suiguan's remark—"What does it have to do with me?"—everyone has realized the Azure Pond is just a tool. The Underworld's move is bound to be a transaction, not a manifestation of a Golden Core-level conflict in the mortal world.'

'In this turbulent situation, "preserving oneself on the mainland" must mean throwing in with the Yang Clan. No wonder he's been running around, so eager to board this ship.'

'Ning Wan is taking the heat for him, and she has also entered the Pristine Speech Heaven. She likely has no chance to switch allegiances now. But he's in a fine position!'

He looked at Si Yuanli, who was sipping his tea, and considered.

'Yuanxiu may have fallen, but he left Si Yuanli with no shortage of opportunities and connections. If that old Daoist Master was so certain the Sima Family would profit by staying on the mainland, he must have had a reason... Building a good relationship with him now... might not be a bad thing.'

He decided to test him. First, he nodded in deep agreement, then smiled. "I had forgotten... Even if the worst happens, with the favor Senior Yuanxiu shared with the Dantai of Nine Mounds, the Sima Family will always have an escape route. You have nothing to fear."

Si Yuanli naturally had arrangements. He looked slightly surprised but still nodded. Li Ximing glanced at him and asked, "How many people have you sent to serve under His Excellency?"

Si Yuanli's expression turned a bit bitter. "The appointments in the conquered market cities were special. A few Sima juniors are among them... It's just that my family's talent is thin. We haven't managed to catch his eye. We've only managed to secure a few positions by relying on our connection to Diyun Peak."

His eyes lit up, and he said in a low voice, "Several of my Sima Family's direct descendants are leaving the mountain. If they could work under Jiangliang, that would be for the best!"

Li Ximing gave him an odd look. "You should rely on your own abilities, Daoist Friend."

He was, by comparison, more concerned about the Azure Pond's next move. "And as for the Azure Pond," he asked, "how do you intend to handle it?"

Si Yuanli clearly had a decision already made. He lowered his gaze. "Qin Xian will lead people to defend Simin. After this battle, the Azure Pond will seal its sect and close its mountains. We will disperse the disciples of the Thirty-Six Peaks and hand them all over to His Lordship for him to command. We only ask to seal our gates, isolate our Dao lineage, and not meddle in worldly affairs."

"As for what His Lordship decides... that will have nothing to do with me."

Li Ximing nodded and sighed. "We shall see how the situation develops!"

He changed the subject, bringing up Daoist Master Luo. Si Yuanli just shook his head in resignation. "One of his men did bring a request. My own eyebrows are on fire right now; what mind do I have to spare for him? When my elder was alive, he didn't dare show his face. Now that the situation has changed, he's getting ideas again."

Li Ximing smiled. "He found a treasure in the Grotto-Heaven. Coming at a time like this, perhaps it could be useful."

Si Yuanli naturally wouldn't rebuff him and nodded repeatedly. Li Ximing then took out the spirit jade and asked Si Yuanli about it. But when Zhusheng was mentioned, the Daoist Master's face darkened.

"At the battle of the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, Ning Wan deceived him. Even though she was forced to, it made him leave in anger, squandering all the friendship and goodwill they once shared. Now, Ning Wan remains in seclusion, and he has closed his doors as well, ignoring everything about the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Only I can use my ancestor's favor to request a meeting... I will mention it for you, Daoist Friend."

His meaning was clear: it wasn't status that would get a meeting with Zhusheng and facilitate this deal, but Si Yuanli's personal favor. Li Ximing poured him more tea and said casually, "Then I must truly thank you, Daoist Friend."

In truth, Si Yuanli felt a measure of relief. Back then, his cultivation had been sufficient, but Daoist Master Yuanxiu had suppressed him time and again, pushing back the year of his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm under the guise of deepening his Dao-Profundity. While it certainly increased his chances of success, looking back now, there was clearly a deeper meaning.

'If I had broken through a few years earlier, I would be sharing this blame! If I had broken through a few years later, who knows what the situation would be!'

The thought that Ning Wan was out front taking the brunt of it made Si Yuanli feel somewhat better. He remembered his own business and said seriously, "I came to find you today for another matter... I have a spiritual item called 'Hollow-heart Profound Mulberry'. I need to refine a medicine, a potent remedy for elevating the spirit and refining the soul, called 'Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder'. It's used to rapidly advance a Purple Mansion Realm's cultivation and quickly establish their immortal foundation... I hope you can produce six pills. I must trouble you, Daoist Friend."

He then took a jade slip from his sleeve. "Please, take a look."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing had seen his share of the world by now. He casually took it and read it. The difficulty was indeed high. Named as a 'powder', it was a type of medicinal powder-pill, and the requested quantity was large. But for him, this level of difficulty was nothing. He raised an eyebrow and teased, "So, cultivators from your Azure Pond are also resorting to these kinds of pills now."

Si Yuanli knew exactly what he meant. Truthfully, this pill was extravagant. It consumed precious spiritual materials for an effect that wasn't particularly remarkable—far less efficient than taking even a fraction of another's immortal foundation.

The Underworld of the past might not have cared, but True Monarch Tianwu was no ordinary figure. This new lord also cultivates True Qi, so who knows what they have in common. Si Yuanli was in a hurry to increase his strength, unsure of how the Underworld would operate in the future, yet he also clung to the fantasy of cultivating his own true nature. Thus, he sought to refine this pill. He sighed,

"Please, Daoist Friend, don't mock me."

Li Ximing let the sarcasm fade from his eyes. He accepted the spiritual materials with satisfaction, but then another matter came to mind. His expression turned serious. "Daoist Friend, do you know of Li Quantao?"

Si Yuanli certainly knew. He didn't just know Li Quantao; he even knew he had two sons. He understood immediately. Smiling and nodding, he replied, "Aside from Li Xizhi's few apprentices... it would have to be him, wouldn't it."

After all, a great chaos was coming, and many lives would surely be lost. One's posted location was therefore critical. The Azure Pond only had a few of their "own people." Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er would certainly be fine, but the same couldn't be said for others.

Li Ximing nodded. Si Yuanli smiled. "Rest assured. He will be transferred overseas. He won't be coming back for some time."

In that brief exchange, they had already secured the man's life. Yet the name of another person had surfaced in Li Ximing's mind long ago, but he couldn't bring himself to say it.

Li Yuanqin.

His young uncle was also part of the Azure Pond. He was in seclusion, so he wasn't in any immediate danger, but he was also a member of the Ning family. Although he was doing his best to protect himself wisely, he couldn't fight the tide of the era. His future was shrouded in uncertainty.

Si Yuanli was extremely sharp. He had clearly thought of this as well, but it involved the Ning family. Who knew if the True Monarch's act of framing them had a deeper meaning? It seemed faintly related to Daoist Master Suiguan's intentions. How could he dare make any promises? He could only pretend not to have noticed and immediately change the subject.

While Li Ximing was lost in thought, the man before him smiled.

"Si Xunhui mentioned to me that he and Queyi are getting along very well. That's good news. What's more... I hear Daoist Master Kuang Yu of the Xinyu Archipelago also thinks highly of her. It seems she is a fortunate one."

Li Ximing nodded. Li Queyi often wrote letters home, so he was well aware of the situation.

'Si Xunhui is good-looking, has a fine personality, and is clever and smooth. He has spent these years adventuring in the Yue State, frequently striking against demonic cultivators and correcting wayward Azure Pond cultivators. While he's clearly trying to build his reputation, he is, nonetheless, a rare and suitable match.'

He offered a few smiling congratulations, but Si Yuanli turned serious. "Since that's the case, I think we should settle this matter sooner rather than later. After all, as the two children's cultivation levels get higher and higher, having heirs will become more difficult."

Since the two were willing, and Si Yuanli had brought it up, it was difficult to refuse. A thought moved in Li Ximing's mind, and he spoke directly. "What you say is true! We just need to have the two juniors return for a visit, let the elders of the family meet them, and then the matter can be settled."

The trip back and forth wouldn't take much time. Si Yuanli saw no issue and nodded with a smile.

Li Ximing personally escorted Si Yuanli out. Only then did his smile fade, replaced by a grave expression as he returned to the mountain.

"Someone, come!"

He called out, giving instructions. "I am going to the Northern Sea. I will be gone for ten days at the shortest, or several months at the longest. Go and tell Jiangzong not to involve himself in any matters in the south. If something truly urgent occurs, he can request instructions from Daoist Master Minghuang. He is not to act on his own!"

...

Xinyu Archipelago.

The sea wind howled, and waves crashed. A woman in pink robes rode the wind, arriving swiftly. The cultivators on either side saw her and quickly moved aside, calling out respectfully. A woman in purple robes nearby exclaimed, "Junior Sister Queyi is back!"

This woman had a rounded, delicate face with small ears. Her features had matured with age, and she now carried herself with a dash of dashing grace. It was Li Queyi!

She stilled the wind, first nodding to the cultivators on both sides who had come to greet her. Only then did she glance at the purple-robed woman. "Ah, Dharma Protector Yang. You seem rather idle today."

The woman seemed not to notice her coldness. She stepped forward with a smile. "I was overjoyed to hear you were returning, so I came to welcome you at once."

Li Queyi smiled but said nothing, riding the wind forward. Just then, a man arrived on the wind. He was handsome and carried himself with an air of refinement. He stopped in front of her, a hint of doubt in his voice. "Why were you gone so long this time? I was worried something had happened to you."

Only now did a genuine smile touch Li Queyi's lips. "Sister Que'Wan is also in the Qunyi Archipelago! We hadn't seen each other in years, so we had to catch up... She has truly matured so much. The way she handles and plans things, she already has the air of an elder."

A look of astonishment crossed her face. "I'm only in the Foundation Establishment Realm... but Sister is already in the late stage!"

Si Xunhui nodded in approval. The nearby Dharma Protector Yang paid this little mind. She had heard that Li Que'wan's bloodline wasn't particularly noble and that she had been posted to the remote Qunyi Archipelago, so she guessed she was one who had fallen out of favor. She hurriedly chimed in with a smile, "Truly, you are all impressive figures! But high cultivation is one thing... I'm afraid it can't compare to Junior Sister's noble bloodline, being valued so by the Daoist Master, and having such a fine husband..."

Li Que'wan was the sister Li Queyi felt closest to in the entire family. These words were grating to the ear. The flattery had completely missed its mark. Li Queyi's expression turned ice-cold. She frowned, turned, and said sharply, "Dharma Protector Yang, since when do you have the right to sow discord in my family's affairs?!"

The purple-robed woman was startled, stammering a few words. The woman before her sneered, "The Daoist Master gave an order: all former disciples of the Purple Smoke Gate are to be assigned positions like Dharma Protector and Instructor. Dharma Protector Yang, you've just come out of seclusion and clearly don't understand the situation. It's one thing to run your mouth in front of me, but if the Daoist Master were to hear this, I wonder if you could bear the consequences. You had best watch your tongue!"

"And now you're trying to stir up trouble among the direct descendants of a Purple Mansion Realm family. Be careful, Dharma Protector, or you might forfeit your life!"

She turned her head, leaving the woman standing there, and headed straight for the interior of the island. Si Xunhui shot the woman a meaningful look before stepping up to follow, smiling. "To think there are people so incapable of reading the situation."

Li Queyi shook her head and sighed. "Her cultivation was higher than mine back then; she was from my Senior Sister's generation. I showed her some respect, and she began to presume upon it. Things are not as they were. If I let her cling to me, she'll end up losing her own life and dragging me down with her."

Si Xunhui smiled warmly. "Don't worry, she won't be bothering you again."

Li Queyi glanced at him, her voice softening. "Just... discuss things with me first."

Just then, another woman came forward to report. She was also one of the former disciples from the Purple Smoke Gate, but her attitude was extremely respectful.

"My Lords!"

This group of cultivators had endured several years of hardship overseas and were now thoroughly docile. Everyone had shed the pretense of being from a great immortal sect. The status gap between them and Li Queyi had suddenly widened to an infinite degree, becoming the difference between the clouds and the mud. All that was left was to address her as 'Lord'.

She said respectfully, "The Daoist Master is waiting for you in the main hall, my Lord!"

Si Xunhui's expression turned solemn, and he immediately withdrew. Li Queyi quickly changed direction and hurried forward. Arriving at the main hall, she paid her respects and entered, only to find there was more than one person seated inside. Besides Daoist Master Kuang Yu, who presided over Xinyu, there was also a beauty in white robes with a melancholic air.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Queyi had just bowed when Daoist Master Kuang Yu smiled and bade her come forward, introducing her affectionately. "Sister Wan'er, this is Queyi. She's a junior I'm very fond of."

This person was indeed Ning Wan, who had not been seen for a long time!

In terms of seniority, Ning Wan was actually a generation above Kuang Yu.

Kuang Yu had trained in the Hengzhu Blessed Land. She had been there when the previous generation's Daoist Master fell and Daoist Master Hengli achieved his breakthrough, a time when the Blessed Land was short on manpower. Furthermore, her father was also a Daoist Master. She had undoubtedly feasted on the resources of two Daos, and her breakthrough speed was naturally extremely fast.

Meanwhile, the Ning family's most critical figure at the time, Daoist Master Yuansu, had no heir. The Ning family was in sharp decline. Ning Wan, who had been reluctantly chosen, actually had less talent than Kuang Yu and the others. It had also taken her an exceptionally long time to break through her ignorance, which is why she was so far behind. If one were to be strict about it, Kuang Yu naturally had to call her 'Sister'.

Ning Wan nodded slightly. "Queyi... which lineage do you belong to?"

Li Queyi bowed low, replying respectfully, "This junior is a great-granddaughter of the Yuandu lineage. My 'Heaven' generation ancestor was of the 'Xuan' generation, named Li Xuanxuan."

"Li Xuanxuan..."

Ning Wan obviously knew of him. She said softly, "Ah, so you are that old gentleman's descendant."

She was in a poor mood and said only this, with nothing else to add. Kuang Yu, however, grew curious. "Oh? Is Daoist Master Zhaojing your direct elder? How are his descendants?"

Li Queyi didn't dare claim that. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, Daoist Master Zhaojing is of the Yuanping lineage... The Daoist Master... has one grandson, of the 'Zhou' generation, named Ming. He has no other heirs."

Ning Wan looked somewhat exasperated, transmitting her voice via divine ability: "Xinyu... the Sima Family's future is also uncertain. How can you promise a direct descendant to them?"

Kuang Yu just smiled and bade her rise, saying with regret, "It's just a pity you've already entered the Purple Smoke Gate and reached the Foundation Establishment Realm so early. I'm not familiar with the Dao lineage you cultivate, otherwise I would have been tempted."

"But since you're working for me, I can't treat you poorly. The Purple Smoke Gate's cultivation method isn't bad, but I know of a better one. More importantly, it has a path to the Purple Mansion Realm..."

At the mention of Purple Smoke, Ning Wan frowned. "I took a look. The Purple Smoke Gate members in your territory are living in wretched conditions... This doesn't reflect well on you."

Kuang Yu said seriously, "This wasn't my arrangement. It was a reminder from Senior Tinglan... I'm not the Purple Smoke Gate, and these aren't the wealthy days of old. If I don't suppress their tempers, and since I can't personally intervene in every matter, they will only end up bringing disaster upon themselves."

"Keeping them in check a little also prevents them from causing trouble outside."

She smiled, turned her head to Li Queyi, and said, "The one you're with is from the Sima Family. He has a good background. They went south back then to follow the Supreme Yang Azure Profoundity. Daoist Master Yuanxiu was also the last of his generation to bear the title of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition... What's more..."

Kuang Yu asked, "He has Dantai blood as well, doesn't he?"

This question was naturally not for Li Queyi. She saw Ning Wan nod and said casually, "It is the Dantai family. Their ancestors were connected, after all."

As Kuang Yu replied, she casually took something from her sleeve. Several glittering round pearls rested in her palm, radiating an icy aura. They looked to be of excellent quality. She smiled, "You're close with both of us. Since there's a happy occasion, take these for now."

Li Queyi's face flushed. She repeatedly said she couldn't accept, but Kuang Yu insisted she take them and smilingly dismissed her.

Ning Wan could only sigh. With Li Yuanqin in seclusion, the few useless people left in the Ning family didn't know how to handle anything. They probably wouldn't even send a congratulatory gift! And since Ning Wan was officially in seclusion herself, she couldn't say much.

"But Sister Wan'er... your situation..."

Hearing this, Ning Wan's expression was weary. She said faintly, "It's fine. I have to go back sooner or later. By remaining in seclusion, I can temporarily avoid the Yang family's affairs. As for the final outcome... that depends on the Azure Pond."

"If the Pristine Merging Owl Pool shows even the slightest reaction, I can keep my life..."

Kuang Yu understood her meaning, of course. But the situation was far from optimistic. That Lord Lushui had always been unpredictable. One could say he was one of the most difficult True Monarchs to serve...

'What's more, to push the enormous crime of the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter onto her... it's impossible not to be suspicious.'

Kuang Yu was worried. "No matter what, it's still His Lordship's Dao lineage. This mountain, this formation, this pool... so much effort was spent. To let it all be razed to the ground... wouldn't that be a terrible waste?"

Ning Wan said distantly, "What's the need? He can dispose of this place, make a new offering to Lushui, and rebuild the Dao lineage for His Lordship. Then he can retreat at his leisure. Even if everything is torn down, what does it matter? Someday, a 'Great Daoist Master Lushui' will walk out of the pool again, pick a few families to enlighten, and won't it all be re-established?"

Kuang Yu's expression tensed. "But... what about Chi Buzi? He also entered the pool!"

Ning Wan lowered her gaze. "But he is useful."

Her voice was flat, yet it drifted quietly through the great hall.

Kuang Yu froze, looking at her with confusion. The beauty before her raised her eyes, revealing the calm and sorrow within them. Her voice was ethereal.

"He saw it clearly, he figured it out. Cultivating by the pool, even with ten thousand different divine abilities, is all for the sake of cultivating a single _use_. Once you have that use, you can grasp that key, that seal."

"The Azure Pond is a pocket that is drawing tighter and tighter. In the end, it's going to be put away. The divine ability of the Azure Pond isn't for the Purple Mansion Realm; it is His Lordship's private property and his scapegoat. Only one person can survive... There is only enough room for one. That person walks out and gets that chance, and everyone else must stay behind in the pocket."

"For all these years, I never understood why he didn't cultivate divine abilities. Thinking back now, he must have seen it clearly too. He just didn't have Chi Buzi's ambition. He wasn't willing to walk away, so he just held onto that key, alone... until his death."
