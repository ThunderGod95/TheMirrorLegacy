# Chapter 1114: Shi'er

Clear qi drifted and swirled.

White mist drifted gently through the pavilion. On a jade platform with a bronze-like sheen, light shone with a burning radiance. A man in black robes stood by the platform's edge, his pupils reflecting slivers of abstruse runes.

A hint of a smile touched his eyes.

Back then, the clan had exhausted its immortal merits exchanging for techniques, leaving only twelve. Before he entered seclusion, he had defeated Taixi and crippled Chiluo, bringing the total to seventy-seven.

But now, a quick look revealed a full two hundred and ninety-six!

He had been in secluded cultivation, and Li Ximing hadn't made many gains. This meant that the battle at Baixiang Valley alone had yielded two hundred and nineteen immortal merits!

The number was staggering.

'Immortal merits are primarily awarded for kills. Back then, slaying Cheng Yan was only worth fifty-seven, and Nuxiao thirty-five. Even Taixi and Chiluo, whom I failed to kill, were only worth sixty-five combined...'

'This gives a rough estimate of the value of a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability and a Merciful One. Vast Cicada was a fifth-generation Maha and one of the Buddhist cultivators; his value should far exceed an ordinary mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert. Even so... it might not have been enough to reach over two hundred.'

'It seems his status as the favored of the Precious Tusk Golden Land, giving him the air of a minor master of a Buddhist Land, added quite a bit extra!'

Li Zhouwei mulled it over for a moment, thoroughly pleased. He gave a cold, inward sneer.

'I wonder how many immortal merits Sparrow Carp Fish and Jiang Toushou will get us!'

The Crimson Severing Arrowhead had compensated for his lack of flexibility. After slaying Vast Cicada in this great battle, Li Zhouwei's own gains were far from shallow, and a plan had long since formed in his mind.

"For charging assaults, I have Sovereign's Perilous Tread. For movement, I have Crimson Severing Arrowhead. For suppression, I have Audience with the Celestial Gate. All my bases are covered. Aside from a few Great Daoist Masters and Great Mahas, no one can claim to have me firmly suppressed. But I am not without flaws."

"I have more than enough power to overwhelm, but not enough killing power."

Li Zhouwei had only managed to slay Vast Cicada because the Spiritual Treasures in Yang Ruizao's and Tinglan's hands had played a major role. If he had faced the enemy alone, trying to suppress and execute him, he still couldn't bypass the clumsy, slow drawbacks of Audience with the Celestial Gate and the Radiant Sun King's Halberd.

'As of today, the fourth-grade Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light can no longer keep up with my divine abilities. Emperor Qi's Light, when boosted by the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, has decent power and can lock down a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert on Touba Ci's level. But it is, in the end, a light of the Yang Extremity. It excels at winning through unorthodox means, not at direct engagement. It lacks the magnificent, righteous power to execute an enemy head-on.'

'I need a spell art for direct, orthodox combat!'

But as Li Zhouwei searched, his brows knit tightly. He found nothing that truly satisfied him.

The spell arts available were broadly divided into two types. The first was the path of the Bright Yang Emperor-King, which used brilliant imperial might to suppress foes. Most of these, like Audience with the Celestial Gate and Sovereign's Perilous Tread, were variations on a theme. Ultimately, they couldn't escape the label of 'cumbersome'. If there were no flanking controls, an enemy could simply break apart, scattering like bandits into the common populace, making them impossible to constrain.

The second type, modeled on arts like Eternal Brightness Steps and Luminous Heart, was the path of luminous cultivation, of plucking yin to nourish yang. While flexible, versatile, and possessing subtleties that hardly seemed to belong to Bright Yang, they lacked any domineering, killing intent.

He kept searching, but the prices of the spell arts he reviewed climbed higher and higher. He had no choice but to relax his criteria slightly, expanding his search to include Radiant Fire arts. Only after considering what would pair well with his existing divine abilities did he find a few candidates.

A Radiant Fire Bright Yang art, the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method, and a Supreme Yang Bright Yang art, the Questioning the Sun Manifesting Yang Scripture.

The Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method was essentially a Radiant Fire art. It used one's life-mandate to resonate with the Great Void, constructing a snare of considerable power. Its true marvel was that it used the Great Void as its source; once summoned, it would appear from thin air and drop directly onto the enemy's head. Not only was it exceedingly difficult to defend against, but it also had a binding effect upon striking.

This point alone made Li Zhouwei extremely fond of it.

The Questioning the Sun Manifesting Yang Scripture used the Supreme Yang as its foundation and also possessed the ability to bind and separate. Based on the ancient Supreme Yang divine ability Gazing Heaven Governance and the modern Sun-Splitting Hairpin, it could shatter an opponent's divine abilities and lock down their physical form, making escape or concealment impossible.

Both had their merits. The Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method had a wider range of applications, but the Questioning the Sun Manifesting Yang Scripture possessed a deadlier killing intent. Li Zhouwei compared them for a long time before finally choosing the former.

'Radiant Fire Bright Yang is closer to my own affinity, after all. Supreme Yang isn't distant, but the difficulty is much higher. Furthermore, the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method uses my life-mandate to resonate with the Great Void. My personal destiny is extraordinary, which should make cultivating it more convenient.'

There was also one other, minor consideration—the Questioning the Sun Manifesting Yang Scripture was related to the Supreme Yang. Anything that touched upon Yin and Yang saw its value skyrocket. It was a full seventy immortal merits more expensive than the first art.

'Uncle-Grandfather still has several spell arts backlogged, enough to keep him busy cultivating for a century or two. He won't be needing new ones anytime soon. But the two juniors are coming out of seclusion, and I still need to acquire techniques for them... I must save where I can.'

He lit incense and prayed, awaiting a response from the heavens. After spending one hundred and ten immortal merits, he turned and returned to his cultivation abode, sinking into meditation.

---

The courtyard was magnificent.

A colossal, mystical tree stood in its center, its yellow-green leaves forming a canopy that blotted out the sky. Pale red flower buds hid among the high branches, a delightful sight. The purple-gold light of the great formation filtered through the leaves, sprinkling shattered patterns on the ground below.

The Wanling Flower Tree had bloomed by Moongaze Lake for generations, and the Li family had never neglected this spiritual root. In just over a hundred years, it had grown so thick that it would take several people to encircle its trunk, a picture of extreme prosperity.

The ground, usually immaculate, was now piled high with mounds of spirit rice that undulated like small hills, gleaming golden in the ambient light. A small, dark-light urn hovered in mid-air, inhaling the grains one by one like a great whale drawing in water.

Li Xuanxuan stood by the steps for a long moment, praising the sight, though his voice was tinged with a pained reluctance.

"A Purple Mansion Realm Spiritual Artifact... truly extraordinary!"

As he spoke, the green-robed Daoist Master beside him immediately chimed in with a polite laugh.

"Old Senior! It is a Spiritual Treasure, after all. Something an ordinary Daoist Master couldn't hope to obtain. Qinghu is truly envious!"

Although Li Xuanxuan's cultivation was low, his current status was sky-high. When Sima Yuanli had heard the news that Li Zhouwei had slain Vast Cicada, he couldn't even muster a trace of jealousy. He was entirely focused on currying favor, his attitude exceedingly deferential.

Li Xuanxuan shook his head repeatedly.

"Sir, you are too kind..."

Sima Yuanli was here to guard the lake. Li Ximing, however, had other plans and had specifically summoned him. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, a faint smile on his face. Watching the last wisp of spirit rice flow into the urn, he commanded,

"Come!"

At his word, the small urn dropped into his palm, glowing with a dim, hazy light. 

This Daoist Master explained, "Although this Sacrificial Millet Earth is refined, it cannot be without spiritual resources to nourish it. We'll let it eat its fill first. We won't need to bother with it for several decades."

Such a marvel was beyond the imagination of a minor cultivator. Li Xuanxuan let out a long sigh, his eyes fixed on the treasure.

"It is just like a living thing," he replied.

Li Ximing had already strode before the persimmon tree.

By now, the spiritual root was as thick as a water bucket, its branches lush and its leaves a vibrant emerald. Pale green fruits swayed, hidden among the boughs. Seeing Li Ximing approach, the tree immediately began to quiver, rustling like the sound of rain as it trembled in fear.

At the same time, the Life Divine Ability Li Ximing was circulating sensed the spiritual root's nascent consciousness. With a single thought, he could extinguish its mind, reducing it to a mundane object.

The Daoist Master raised the treasure in his hand and smiled.

"You have shared a bond with my Li family for many years. Today, that bond shall be fulfilled!"

In an instant, a furious wind roared. Boundless dark clouds gathered in the heavens as the earth began to tremble. Locked in place by the Bright Yang divine ability, the spiritual root was torn from the ground, every last fiber of its root system intact, and levitated shockingly into the air.

The spiritual root was frightened out of its wits. A faint, weak cry for mercy rang out, causing the old ape nearby to take a panicked step forward, its ancient eyes filled with worry.

The Daoist Master tossed the Spiritual Treasure. The fist-sized mouth of the urn instantly expanded, unleashing a powerful suction. Within its depths, a vision of fertile earth appeared, wreathed in clouds and mist, pulsing with a profound light!

Bright Alignment!

The massive spiritual root vanished in a flash. The profound urn, in contrast, spun in the air, its illusory colors growing more brilliant. The golden patterns running vertically down its surface brightened, making it look surprisingly more like a simple wooden urn.

Amid the dazzling green light, a few needle-thin, tender branches emerged from the urn's mouth. They coiled around and bloomed small yellow flowers, swaying joyfully. A clean fragrance instantly filled the air. Li Ximing caught the Spiritual Treasure as Sima Yuanli praised,

"Such potent spirituality!"

Li Ximing tilted the urn's mouth, and a projection of fertile earth appeared. The swaying persimmon tree stood within the multicolored light. Its branches and leaves looked the same, but its aura was now obscure and indistinct—utterly different from before.

Sima Yuanli saw this clearly and gasped in amazement.

"This spiritual root's life-mandate has become one with the Spiritual Treasure. It's completely changed! The designs of the ancient cultivators are truly astonishing!"

As the Spiritual Treasure's master, Li Ximing's perception was even clearer. The persimmon tree had lent its life-mandate, and the Heavenly Nurture Urn had provided its status. With the two combined, the nourishment the tree received was terrifying to contemplate. In turn, the Heavenly Nurture Urn had become brimming with spirituality, even gaining a measure of autonomy to face enemies on its own.

'They complete each other. The only pity is that if this Spirit Persimmon is ever to leave the Heavenly Nurture Urn, the spiritual root itself will likely not survive. Not only that, but it would require a great divine ability to re-nourish the Spiritual Treasure... Still... a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual root is hard to find. A Spirit Persimmon is more than good enough.'

Still unsatisfied, Li Ximing made a slight hooking motion with his finger. The multicolored light swirled, coalescing into a pair of shears that snipped a branch from the tree. He then retrieved a finger-sized piece of black wood from his sleeve, turned, and smiled.

"Daoist Friend Qinghu—if you would, some of your Valley Water."

Sima Yuanli understood at once. He summoned his gourd and, with a thought, a stream of Azure Radiance Pure Essence—famed for curing illness, restoring life, and recreating bodies—surged out. As it poured down, Li Ximing gathered his sleeve and intoned an edict:

"Today, I transmit a true law, teaching you to create an alternate body."

His fingertip blazed, and the Light of the Six Harmonies erupted.

'This light governs the six harmonies, balances heaven and earth, serves as a companion to gods, and questions the cosmos!'

A companion to gods!

In that instant, a brilliant, clear light shone. The Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood dissolved within the Valley Water. A new form coalesced, and a young acolyte seemingly appeared from thin air.

She had elegant features and a beautiful, jade-like face with ruby lips. She wore feathered robes, her hair was bound up, and her sleeves seemed to catch the wind. Her cheeks were adorned with five-colored makeup. Her bright eyes darted around, shining with a faint confusion. She quickly knelt and spoke in a crisp, clear voice.

"Greetings, Master!"

Li Ximing, thoroughly pleased, lowered his hand and laughed. Sima Yuanli, however, remained stunned for a long moment before stating, dumbfounded:

"Zhaojing... what a divine ability!"

Li Ximing, with a flick of his sleeve, plucked the profound urn from the air as if grasping the moon's reflection in water. He handed it to the acolyte to hold and smiled.

"It is merely an unorthodox trick!"

This truly highlighted Li Ximing's skill. World's Radiance and Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body were already exceptionally compatible; otherwise, he would never have mastered Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body so quickly. By turning World's Radiance outward, he had managed to align it even more perfectly with the 'companion' aspect of 'companion to gods'. He had actually managed to pull it off.

He looked the new acolyte up and down.

"Born from an urn... and a persimmon tree..."

The words inexplicably caused Li Xuanxuan to raise his head, his gaze questioning. Li Ximing hesitated.

"Wengshi (Urn-Persimmon) doesn't sound very pleasant. You... shall be called Shi'er."

Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan closed his eyes, looking as if he wanted to say something but was holding back. He mused internally,

'Wengshi... That ridiculous Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array... that really was this kid's naming. This time, Shi'er sounds much better...'

(AI/TL: Zhaoguang means Bright and Broad)

Li Ximing paid him no mind, listening as the young acolyte replied in her bright voice:

"Master, Shi'er understands!"

Li Ximing asked her a few casual questions, then turned away. Shi'er immediately lowered her head and made a face at the White Ape by her feet. The old ape shook its head in surprise, but its eyes glistened with the faint sheen of tears.

The old ape had watched over the plants in this courtyard for a hundred years and had developed a parent's affection for them. Seeing her achieve this fruition, how could it not be overjoyed?

Li Ximing had a good grasp of the situation.

'Her mind is that of a twelve or thirteen-year-old... She does have memories... At least she recognizes everyone.'

This was an excellent outcome. He hadn't used any precious materials for Shi'er's body; in a Purple Mansion Realm battle, it would be as fragile as paper. He could just retract her into the Spiritual Treasure. But for all other matters, she would be incredibly convenient.

'In a fight, she can't compare to Xuanyi's Bai Yinzi, but she has her own benefits. Her body is maintained by my divine ability, so she has no lifespan limit. If she's passed down for a few generations, who knows what she might become.'

He turned back to Sima Yuanli with a smile. Daoist Master Qinghu seemed lost in thought and had remained silent. At Li Ximing's gaze, he finally snapped out of it.

"The Severed Branch Spirit Molt that Zhaojing required. I have found it."

He produced a jade box from his sleeve and opened it gently. Inside were five or six short wings, clustered together like fallen petals. A look of joy crossed Li Ximing's face.

"Excellent!"

This item was a key ingredient for the Fading Sun Armour-Break Pill. Li Ximing had been unable to decipher the pill recipe for some time, only gaining enlightenment after receiving guidance from Li Zhouwei. Now that Sima Yuanli had brought the spiritual item, he said joyfully,

"As per our agreement, once the pills are refined, I will give Qinghu four!"

Sima Yuanli smiled and nodded, though his mind was clearly elsewhere. He didn't actually need the pills; he was merely returning a long-standing favor for pill refinement and hoping to strengthen their connection...

But before he could say more, Li Ximing smiled.

"I have a matter that I must trouble Daoist Friend Qinghu with."

Sima Yuanli smiled. He listened as Li Ximing continued:

"Since you have seen the Heavenly Nurture Urn, I will speak plainly. Within the urn is an art called Grand Sacrifice. It has the power to imprison and to strip."

Sima Yuanli's eyebrows rose, a look of confusion on his face. But the smile on the gold-and-white-robed Daoist Master's face turned icy.

"If one could imprison a divine ability, seize its marvels, and nourish the urn... would that not be a fine thing?" he asked softly.

Sima Yuanli froze, reacting only after a long moment, as if seeing this Daoist Master for the first time. A deep chill filled his heart. It was a long time before he finally spoke.

"That... would be truly difficult!"

Li Ximing smiled at him, then said with slow, deliberate care,

"I, Li Ximing, would naturally never capture a person for such refinement. But for certain Demon beasts whose crimes are too numerous to list... opportunities will arise. And if not, some of the Spirit Beasts and mounts from the Buddhist Land would also serve nicely."

Only then did Sima Yuanli lower his head slightly, sinking into thought. Li Ximing stood with his hands behind his back, smiling as he gazed out at the shimmering surface of the lake.

He had invited Sima Yuanli here not just to borrow his Azure Radiance Pure Essence, but more importantly, to say these words to his face, providing a pretext for his future actions. Of course, Grand Sacrifice was not his true goal.

Even without Grand Sacrifice, there would have been enmities and grudges, and a need for spiritual items. Li Ximing's trip to the Southern Borderlands all those years ago had been to lay the groundwork for this very moment. It was only ever a question of finding a good excuse.

'Before Jiangqian emerges from seclusion, the matter of the Azure Talisman must be settled!'
