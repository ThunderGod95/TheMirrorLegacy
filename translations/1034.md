# Chapter 1034: King Wei

The landscape was breathtaking, with vibrant clouds drifting lazily across the sky.

Figures milled about on the high platform between the islands. A Daoist Master sat in the main seat, while the cultivators of the Li Clan stood in their designated places, dressed in formal, ornate robes. They had shed their usual long gowns with water and moon patterns at the cuffs, put away their weapons, and unfastened the jade talismans from their waists.

In the distance, celestial clouds gathered and swelled, and a speck of golden light emerged, racing toward them. Li Suining focused his gaze. At the forefront of the procession were two jade horses, each carrying a man in golden armor. A long banner, inscribed with profound patterns, was strapped to each rider's back. In their hands, they held black flags embroidered with the character for 'Song' in white thread.

Trailing them were more than a dozen grand conveyances of golden light and profound jade, exuding an air of majestic power. Triple-eaved parasols of azure and white shielded them, while crimson banners trimmed in black fluttered in the wind. A retinue holding various ceremonial weapons—banners, parasols, halberds, and spears—flanked the procession, shimmering with multicolored light that represented the elements of wind, rain, thunder, lightning, water, fire, wood, and earth.

Li Suining lowered his gaze slightly and noticed Li Zhouda, who stood one position ahead of him, scowling. The burly man was clearly uncomfortable in the restrictive formal wear, which barely covered the bronze bell at his waist. He muttered under his breath, "What a grand display."

Li Suining knew Li Zhouda's fiery temper well. He didn't think much of the Song Emperor, and he certainly didn't believe some outsider had the right to bestow a kingship upon one of their own. This wasn't just an internal sentiment; in his past life, Li Zhouda had voiced it openly in private. Today, his displeasure with the ostentatious arrival was plain to see.

Fortunately, there were those present who could keep him in check. A single glare from Li Xuanxuan was enough to make the hot-headed man fall silent. Li Suining then turned his attention to the other side.

Li Zhouming stood further ahead, already some distance away. He was tilting his head back, gazing at the sky with a drowsy expression. He only seemed to snap out of his stupor when the lifelike jade horses reached the platform and a beauty in white disembarked from one of the carriages. His eyes immediately followed her, stealing glances.

'Daoist Master Ning…'

Li Suining quickly lowered his head. Li Xuanxuan had already stepped forward, even before Li Zhouwei, to greet the envoy.

"Greetings, Your Excellency!" he said respectfully.

The old man’s demeanor was as deferential as it had been a century ago when the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner had descended, and its aloof, green-robed messenger had appeared.

But as Li Xuanxuan spoke, a storm of complex emotions churned within Li Suining. He peeked around, observing the reactions. His younger uncle, Li Jiangchun, had turned his face toward the island’s edge. The disciples around him wore varied expressions. Li Minggong maintained a polite, accompanying smile, while Li Zhouming’s smile had faded. Li Zhouda didn't even look up, staring at the ground as if trying to bore a hole through it.

Ning Wan, her own expression complicated, accepted a shimmering white Immortal Edict from an attendant. She held it with both hands but didn't unroll it. Instead, she bowed her head slightly and presented it to Li Zhouwei, who had stepped forward to receive it.

"By the Mandate of the True Emperor," she began, her voice soft, "in recognition of the Li Clan of a former age, a celestial branch of the Bright Yang, a noble line that has endured hardship... Minghuang has defended Jianghuai and Ting Province, serving as a pillar of strength... It is fitting he be granted land and title to establish his house. Thus, we hereby enfeoff you as King Wei, with the authority to command campaigns beyond the borders..."

Her elegant brow furrowed, and her heart pounded in her chest. After a long moment, she saw the young man before her give a customary bow in acceptance.

"I have long served in the remote frontiers and am humbled by this immense grace," he replied. "Though I may find it difficult to repay such an honor, I vow to serve with unwavering loyalty and diligence."

His voice was calm yet powerful, resonating across the entire platform. In an instant, a wave of motion swept through the crowd as everyone dropped to their knees—the Song soldiers who had arrived on celestial light and the members of the Li Clan alike. In unison, they proclaimed: "We pay our respects to King Wei!"

The cry echoed to the heavens. A faint light flared within the golden pupils beneath Li Zhouwei's brows. The brilliance of his aura roiled, and his presence fluctuated wildly, as if some immense divine ability within him was being suppressed, yet still fighting to break free.

Li Zhouwei merely stood there, but Ning Wan felt the Immortal Edict in her hands suddenly grow dim and incredibly heavy, nearly slipping from her grasp. She instinctively channeled her own divine ability to hold it.

_Crack!_

The rollers at either end of the edict emitted a strained, cracking sound, threatening to shatter at any moment. The light flowing from it became searing hot, burning a patch of Bright Yang purple fire onto her fair skin. A sharp, piercing cicada-like drone erupted to her right.

"Hm?"

The flame and the sound vanished as quickly as they had appeared, a fleeting illusion before her eyes and ears. The moment Li Zhouwei took the edict from her, all the strange phenomena ceased. The scroll was merely a bit dimmer than before.

Once in the new King Wei's hands, the Immortal Edict seemed to gain some form of acknowledgment. It began to pulse once more with the brilliance of True Qi, lying placidly in his grasp.

'But how can someone in the Purple Mansion Realm experience hallucinations?' Ning Wan suppressed her shock and avoided looking too closely. Flustered, she turned to help Li Xuanxuan up, an awkward gesture to cover her unease. Glancing at Li Zhouwei, she said in a low voice, "There is no need for further ceremony. Please, let us speak inside..."

Li Zhouwei turned slightly to the side. "After you."

Ning Wan signaled to her retinue. Celestial luan birds descended one after another, landing softly on the platform. She dismissed her attendants and followed Li Zhouwei toward the rear hall, a wistful look on her face.

The Ning Wan of today was different from the woman who had emerged from seclusion years ago—cold as autumn, pure as snow, and seemingly untouched by the world. Years spent aiding a tyrant and walking the line between life and death had added a touch of melancholy to her aura. Yet, with her dark brows gently knitted, she was still a breathtaking beauty.

Li Zhouwei gestured for her to take a seat and said softly, "Congratulations, Senior."

Ning Wan couldn't decipher the full meaning behind his congratulations. She could only let out a faint sigh. "You are too kind, King Wei."

Li Zhouwei set down his cup. "And how should I address the envoy?"

Ning Wan’s expression turned serious. "I am no envoy. I am merely the Sect Master of Azure Pond Sect and a Daoist Master of the Song's Bureau of Immortal Rites."

She paused, then retrieved a command token from her sleeve. One side was engraved with the character for 'Song,' the other with 'Azure Pond,' both glowing with True Qi.

"The Emperor values the Immortal Dao above all. The Azure Pond Sect is still permitted to practice its teachings and cultivate in the mountains... I am both the Sect Master of Azure Pond and a Daoist Master in the Bureau of Immortal Rites. The two roles do not conflict."

She tilted her head. "Please have Chen Wenyao come forward."

A moment later, a young man entered the hall carrying a tray. He knelt at the threshold before proceeding forward on his knees, stopping before the two of them. He then knelt again, raising the golden tray above his head.

"King Wei, please look," Ning Wan said gently.

On the tray, beneath a veil of white light, lay a neatly folded feather cloak. Each individual feather was distinct, perfectly uniform in length and color. The tip of every feather held a hint of pale purple, and under the Heavenly Light, they revealed dense, intricate patterns of a rare, dark gold.

Merely resting on the table, the cloak radiated a mystical True Qi that washed over them in profound waves.

Ning Wan's expression was solemn as she announced, "This is a gift from the imperial family: the Campaign Cloak of King Wei. The base is woven from the great treasure of True Qi, the Divine Light Brocade, using Heavenly Li Crimson Gold for thread. It is adorned with one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two long feathers from the Purple Mi-Oriole, a beast of Purple Qi. It was crafted with a vast amount of spiritual resources."

She continued, "The Divine Light Brocade is renowned for being indestructible and for its light, which can dim but never be extinguished. This cloak has been enhanced with numerous wondrous arts. Unless it is utterly obliterated in a single blow, it will repair itself over time! It is a blessing, that King Wei may remain unharmed through a hundred battles and advance even further in his cultivation!"

Her tone grew more emphatic. "This is the most revered cloak among all the kings, second only to that of the Emperor himself!"

Regardless of its practical effects, the spiritual materials used were undoubtedly among the most precious. Furthermore, the sheer amount of Divine Light Brocade used was astounding—enough to craft three or four other Spiritual Artifacts!

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flickered, his gaze fixed on the cloak. He reached out, the texture smooth and delicate beneath his fingers.

"I shall present a memorial to express my gratitude," he nodded.

As he spoke, the cloak trembled of its own accord. A fine, feather-like flame rose from it, as if seeking to bond with him, but he pressed it down, holding it still.

"In the dao of True Qi," Ning Wan explained, "prestige is not determined by tokens or immortal thrones, but by feather adornments. Among these, the cloak is the most venerated. This Campaign Cloak of King Wei shall serve as your symbol of office. With it, you may come and go as you please, and you shall not be required to announce your name when greeting the Emperor."

The woman raised a delicate hand and produced a small banner from within the cloak's folds. It was no bigger than her palm, its base a deep purple with black and gold patterns, embroidered with the words: 'King Wei of the Great Song.'

"This," Ning Wan said, "is King Wei's Banner of Martial Governance in Ting Province. When planted in the Great Void, it can pacify the region's elemental disasters, evil demons, and savage tribes. It gathers the world's True Qi, which will greatly benefit your disciples' cultivation."

Li Zhouwei picked up the Spiritual Artifact and inspected it. Its wonders were far less impressive than the cloak's. Its primary functions were to manage spiritual veins, nurture a region's spiritual energy, and provide some measure of protection.

'The only noteworthy feature is its ability to be planted in the Great Void... When the army is on the move, raising this banner from afar would allow one to sense any Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who descend or attempt to spy on them.'

It was clearly an artifact forged for conquering the north. Li Zhouwei took a sip of his tea, quickly grasping the Song court's intentions. He asked casually,

"What matters does the Bureau of Immortal Rites oversee? And which houses are involved?"

"The Song court has Three Palaces and Six Bureaus," Ning Wan replied in a low voice.

"The Six Departments are now established to govern the court, but the Three Palaces remain dormant... It is said the highest among them will be the Purple and Gold Palace, which will have only a few members. Those who enter will receive immense benefits."

"As for the Bureau of Immortal Rites... it doesn't manage much. Its main purpose is to regulate the sects, but there aren't many sects left to speak of in Yue State now. It's mainly Azure Pond, the Snow Wings Sect, the Myriad Radiance Sect... and various smaller temples and monasteries..."

"The Myriad Radiance Sect?" Li Zhouwei inquired.

"Yang Ruiyi... has gone to Sword Gate," Ning Wan explained. "Sword Gate will have its inner disciples and Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators continue their seclusion. The outer sect, however, will gather at the Sword-Lifting Ferry, preserving the foundation of Sword Gate while also accepting the Bureau's direction."

"If I may add... the Sword-Lifting Ferry is filled with disciples from the Cheng Clan... many have already journeyed south. I believe they intend to seek official positions."

Her expression grew complicated.

"It's difficult to say! Sword Gate built its reputation on virtue. The Cheng Clan has always advocated for that virtue, preaching seclusion and ignoring the affairs of Jiangnan. Now, seeking office and governing a region has also become 'virtuous.' It seems... the Cheng Clan was the one least willing to follow its own rules."

Though Ning Wan had said she shouldn't add more, she was now one of the few in the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition who dared to speak so openly. Her expression calmed, and she sighed.

"It is a pity for Senior Lingmei... The elders of Sword Gate agreed to hand over Jingchuan Prefecture so easily because their ancient virtues did not endorse worldly governance. I wonder what he would think now, seeing so many Cheng Clan disciples emerge from the mountains."

Li Zhouwei had received a great kindness from Lingmei, a debt he had yet to repay. He had nothing to add on the matter and simply nodded in silence. Ning Wan paused for a moment before deftly changing the subject.

"His Majesty holds you in the highest regard, King Wei, considering you his right hand. I came today for two reasons: first, to perform the enfeoffment ceremony, and second, to discuss your fief."

"With the establishment of the new dynasty, the lands of Yue have been divided into six provinces and thirty-two prefectures. They are: Ting Province of Moongaze Lake, Xun Province of the Mushroom Forest Plains, He Province of the Cangwu Forests, Heng Province of the Eastern Hengzhu Plains, Min Province of the Simin Reeds River, and Li Province of the Lixia Mountains."

"The former territories of the Snow Wings, Purple Smoke, Myriad Radiance, and Xiukui sects have been designated as prefectures but not provinces... There are twelve such prefectures, most of which retain their old names."

The woman blinked.

"After all... most of those names were decided by the former King of Yue. Following the old system now, any changes made were simply to restore their original names."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. "How have the prefectures been divided?"

Ning Wan answered without much thought. "The Great Song has enfeoffed three kings. First is King Wei of the Li Clan, second is King of Yuyang of the Chen Clan, and third is King of Nanjia of the Lingu Clan... The other titles... are not worth mentioning!"

She hesitated for a second. "Actually, there is one other domain, called the Protectorate of the Tranquil Sea. It's in the old lands of Shahuan, overlooking Shitang, and is guarded by Protector Liu."

The "Protector Liu" she spoke of was, of course, Daoist Master Zhusheng. This made Li Zhouwei raise his brows and set down his cup.

'It's not surprising. Suiguan arranged this long ago... After all, this Daoist Master Zhusheng is also of imperial descent, a successor of the Chu State. Even the Xiao-Wu orthodoxy comes from Chu. They couldn't let him go. Combined with the strategic importance of Shitang... this domain was inevitable.'

'As for people like Sima Yuanli and Yang Ruiyi, they are the Great Song's true inner circle. Naturally, they wouldn't be considered for a kingship.'

Ning Wan glanced at him and continued, "Of the six provinces, only Ting Province has a king, and it belongs to you, Wei. The territory was demarcated by your own Li Jiangliang. The other kings receive only a single prefecture; their domains cannot be called provinces..."

"For the nobility in Ting Province, the difference isn't great. But the Chen Clan's fiefdom has been reduced the most drastically, by more than half, leaving them with just a prefecture city... The Lingu Clan fared better... losing only ten or twenty percent of their land."

"As for the rest... most of the prefectures in Min Province are state-owned, with a few small fiefs... I've seen the enfeoffment map. Past the Quanwu Mountains, it's a completely different picture... Numerous houses stand side-by-side, the land littered with so many minor nobles you probably couldn't count them all."

Li Zhouwei listened, then glanced at the map she handed him. He understood immediately.

'The "provinces" are under the Great Song's direct control, formed from the core territories of the old Azure Pond, Hengzhu, and Changxiao sects, including places like Manor Peak at Moongaze. The lands beyond are governed much like how the Li Clan managed the Wilderness...'

'The difference is that the former Yue State is vast. The twelve prefecture cities remain under the Great Song's control, with officials they appoint and dismiss. Outside those cities, they can freely grant land to noble families, encouraging them to develop the frontiers... The sheer number of them is staggering...'

He gave the overall map a cursory glance before focusing his attention on Ting Province. He found its area to be quite substantial.

'The northern border extends all the way to the banks of the great river, and the southern border rests against the mountains, so nothing has changed there. The eastern and western borders, however, start from the traditional eastern shore... stretch past the Western Mountains that served as the border between Wu and Yue, and even encompass a small slice of the great desert...'

The territory of Ting Province as defined by the Song court was larger, not smaller, than the Li Clan's current domain. The only real loss was the Wilderness, which had been re-designated as Jiangjuan Prefecture to the west and Baoshan Prefecture to the east.

'They only took the Wilderness.'

The Wilderness was not a desirable place at the moment, having been ravaged by the Way of Great Desire. The actual loss was minimal, though it complicated things for the many subordinate families whose roots were still there.

Li Zhouwei nodded, his gaze lingering on the very top of the map.

The black, curved line depicting the surging river connected to Lake Xian. Below the lake was Shanji Prefecture. This prefecture, lost for many years, was now specially marked as belonging to the Great Song.

Seeing Li Zhouwei's focused stare, Ning Wan followed his line of sight and understood at once.

'That's the nail planted by the Profound Governance Pavilion. The Song Emperor can't ignore it. A great war is inevitable...'
