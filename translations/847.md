# Chapter 847: Baiku

At Cold Cloud Peak, snow drifted through the small courtyard and thick frost clung to the steps. A group of cultivators in white robes knelt outside a cave dwelling. The stout man leading them pressed his forehead to the ground, his face a mix of awe and delight.

"Welcome, honored sir, from your closed-door cultivation!"

The wind and snow before him stirred slightly, and a young man emerged from the courtyard, the very elements clinging to his robes. He bent down slowly, helping the middle-aged man to his feet. He clapped him on the shoulder and chuckled.

"This is a day for celebration, Uncle Tongcai, there's no need for such formality," said Fei Qing'yi with a laugh. "The North-South conflict drained our family's vitality, and with only a few elders like you remaining, we must all shoulder the burden together."

Though a bit stout, Fei Tongcai had a certain mature charm. All members of the Fei family were blessed with good looks, and Fei Qing'yi, who cultivated the Cold Qi, possessed an added aura of cold sternness. Hearing his words, Fei Tongcai nodded repeatedly, reminding him, "The first thing... we must go to the main family..."

"I understand," Fei Qing'yi replied, his head bowed. "This matter can't be delayed. There are a hundred, a thousand eyes on the Lake. If not for the alliance our ancestors forged with the Lake, we wouldn't even have this single mountain peak to call our own. The venerable elder is a man who values old ties. Fetch some of the spiritual items from the mountain and come with me."

He continued in a low voice, "You are the only one left in our family who met Li Qinghong all those years ago. If you come with me to pay our respects to the Lake, you'll have an excuse to speak a few words with the venerable elder... That venerable elder... is truly our family's protective charm."

"Understood! Understood!" Fei Tongcai hurried to prepare the items. As he walked with his kinsman, he heard Fei Qing'yi's cold voice.

"In any case, since Fei Qingyi has clung to a powerful branch and submitted herself to the Si family, we can't count on her to help with family matters. We only have ourselves to rely on..."

After they had flown for a time and exited the great formation, they saw a man in black robes waiting quietly before it, his hands clasped. Upon seeing Fei Qing'yi, he lowered his head slightly and spoke in a calm voice.

"Fellow Daoist Fei, let us go to the island together!"

"Ah, it's Protector Chen," Fei Qing'yi said, forcing a smile. He nodded. "Yes, we were just on our way... just on our way..."

Chen Yang found him utterly displeasing. As the leader of a new generation of elders, including people like An Xuanxin, he had always regarded the Fei family as a thorn in his side. He could not tolerate this semi-autonomous clan in northern Jiangbei, yet he had never been able to find a pretext to act.

He had been sent to Funan to clean up the traces of past events and had handled the matter jointly with Li Jianglong. He was keenly aware of what had transpired in the north, especially concerning the True Monarch. With his cautious nature, he had wanted to turn over every single blade of grass in all of Funan at the time.

At such a critical juncture, Chen Yang had no goodwill whatsoever toward Fei Qing'yi. His hand tightened slightly on the hilt of his sword, but a smile bloomed on his face, and he chatted and laughed with them all the way.

Following behind Chen Yang, they flew into the Lake's midst. The hall they entered was utterly silent. Passing through the doorway, they saw the man in crimson robes who had been waiting for them. Li Jiangqian sat on the seat of honor, a smile on his face.

Fei Qing'yi was actually terrified of that smile; it sent a shiver down his spine. The Li clan had battled their way out of the remote and desolate lands of Eastern Yue to become the rulers of Moongaze Lake. This bloody history made everyone in the family, from top to bottom, seem utterly formidable. Even after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, Fei Qing'yi couldn't shake this feeling. He knelt on the floor of the hall, bowing respectfully.

Li Jiangqian offered a few words of congratulations, and Fei Qing'yi answered each one, steering the conversation back to how honest and loyal the Fei family was, and that they harbored no ulterior motives.

Li Jiangqian wasn't satisfied with his answers. He still had doubts about the younger man's breakthrough. He watched him for a while in silence before speaking.

"The Floating Cloud Territory in the north was once deeply entangled with the Fei clan. The Lake protected the north bank for ten years, allowing you to weather the storm. Now, that territory has been freed up for a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to work. The Fei clan should have withdrawn its hands from there. We've given this order before, but it seems it hasn't been carried out to our satisfaction."

The Fei clan should not have dared to act in Jiangbei, but the Fei family lacked the Li clan's efficiency and speed. Li Jiangqian guessed they still maintained numerous, unintentional ties. When Li Jiangqian asked about it, Fei Qing'yi didn't even know which aspect of his family's affairs was lacking. He simply answered, "This subordinate is incompetent. I will go back and take care of it properly..."

Li Jiangqian had no intention of letting him handle it blindly. The difference between the Fei family with and without a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was massive. He had specially sent Chen Yang to intercept Fei Qing'yi before he could head north. Now, he simply said, "That's not necessary. You will stay on the Lake for now. All news concerning the north will be sent to the island for us to handle. If you conceal even a single detail..."

Fei Qing'yi nodded frantically. Li Jiangqian's gaze, however, suddenly locked onto Fei Tongcai, who was sweating profusely beside him. He didn't have to say a word. The nearby Chen Yang immediately stepped forward, drew his sword, and placed it against the middle-aged man's neck, shouting, "Speak!"

Fei Tongcai glanced anxiously at his nephew, a sight that terrified Fei Qing'yi out of his wits. If not for the fact that cultivating the 'Snow on the Pine' physique prevented him from sweating, he too would have been drenched. He knelt down as well, giving Fei Tongcai a meaningful look before answering, "This subordinate... this subordinate has only just come out of seclusion... I don't know what news the family has received..."

Li Jiangqian watched the two men silently. Fei Tongcai began to kowtow, muttering timidly, "Reporting to the Venerable Sir... we received a secret letter a few days ago. A former clansman... is cultivating in Baihu County. They sent a secret letter back recently, hoping for assistance with resources and supplies..."

He called him a "former clansman," but Fei Qing'yi knew he was a descendant left behind by the older generation as a contingency plan. A feeling of dread took hold of him. Chen Yang, who held the sword, received a subtle cue from his lord. His face instantly turned grim and menacing. "We told your family to withdraw your hands long ago. To knowingly hide information and secretly contact others... you are truly rebellious!"

"This humble one didn't know about this before!" Fei Tongcai could only kneel on the ground, trembling. Li Jiangqian still wore a smile, but his heart was filled with dark clouds.

'Baihu County... so he is indeed in Baihu County. That means Protector Black Rat is in Baihu County. Wang Quwan and Wang He are also in Baihu County, and the core of the Wang clan of Jiangbei is in the area of Baihu County...'

But if the Fei family had someone in Baihu County, the matter was completely different. Li Jiangqian strode down, helped Fei Qing'yi up, and said with a hint of reproach, "Protector Chen is too harsh... this matter isn't clear yet, there's no need to rush."

Fei Qing'yi finally relaxed a little. Fei Tongcai stopped stuttering, and when Chen Yang asked, he spoke softly.

"That person is of my generation. He made a mistake years ago and was driven out by the family. He no longer keeps in contact with us. He once cultivated at Lake Xian, and later went to Baihu County to work as a tearoom owner."

"Recently... we heard that there was turmoil in the county. The great formation of the ore vein was destroyed, which angered Protector Black Rat. His business was affected, and he also reached a crucial period in his Qi Refining breakthrough... so he sought help from the Peak."

"Patriarch, please rest assured! Our family will no longer have any contact with this person!"

Li Jiangqian stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his fists clenched so tight that the veins on his knuckles bulged. A few wisps of Radiant Fire leaked from his palms, flickering erratically.

This matter seemed harmless—after all, the person had been exiled by the Fei family. If he happened to gain favor with the True Monarch, the Fei family would be in trouble, and if he offended the True Monarch, the Fei family would also be in trouble. But a little thought revealed that this "exile" was a pathetic ruse.

'What if this person was forced to be exiled due to my pressure, a part of a 'cunning rabbit with three burrows' plan? If he does gain favor with the True Monarch, it would mean my family will be a target for attracting hatred!'

He spoke with a gentle tone, "Why would you drive away a family member for no good reason? Speak the truth now."

His voice was faintly chilling. Chen Yang's face turned even darker, and he stood silently. Fei Tongcai finally couldn't hold on any longer. He kowtowed and confessed, "Reporting to the Venerable Sir... this was the doing of Fei Tongyu... back when he led our Fei family to swear allegiance to the Lake, he made a secret plan to send out four branches of our clan. He was even afraid of being discovered and didn't dare to contact them for all these years... He said... those who are outside only need to know they are of the Fei clan, and we don't need to know where they are. That way, if Cold Cloud Peak's Fei clan were to one day disappear, he would have a chance to rebuild the clan and continue the lineage!"

"This family... only recently made contact again..."

Li Jiangqian, a man of great cunning, understood immediately. Though Fei Tongyu had led his clansmen to pledge allegiance, he clearly held deep misgivings about the Li clan, fearing his family would be slowly worn away until the north bank was fully occupied. He had dispersed his bloodline as a contingency. As for why they hadn't dared to contact them all these years? It was to guard against the Li clan, of course!

That was the true meaning of the so-called "exile!" It was originally a backup plan, but now, due to the fate of Jiangbei, one branch had ended up in Baihu County. They might truly encounter the True Monarch!

He swept a grim look at Chen Yang, who also looked sullen. He was disgusted by Fei Tongcai. Chen Yang was no simple man; he had probably also guessed this layer of deception. Holding his sword, he said grimly, "The Lake has treated your family well all these years, haven't we?"

At these words, the two could only kneel and kowtow, unable to say another word. This was Fei Tongyu's doing, a mere retreat plan. Who could have foreseen that such a thing would happen in the future, or that it would cause trouble in this way?

'The Fei clansmen are all quite attractive. Perhaps one or two of the daughters will offer their beauty and be favored by the True Monarch. If he really lets this Fei Tongcai cut off contact, and the matter comes back to bite them, will it be the Fei family's fault? Naturally, it would be seen as my, Li Jiangqian's, persecution...'

Lost in thought, he returned to the seat of honor. He sat down and told Chen Yang to sheathe his sword. At the moment, he was wary of the True Monarch's methods, so he maintained a pleasant demeanor.

"This matter is simply a case of a predecessor being overly cautious. There is no need to dwell on it now. Qing'yi's breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm is a great blessing. There's no need for a clansman to be wandering about outside. Send someone to bring him back and have him complete his breakthrough within the Peak!"

This intention confused the two Fei clansmen. They didn't know if it was a good or bad thing, or why this order had been given. They could only kowtow and thank him. Chen Yang spoke in a low voice.

"And the person we should send..."

This was a critical matter. It would be best to send someone who knew the inside story. If it weren't so strange for Li Jiangqian to go himself, he would have considered making the trip. He, too, possessed a Talisman Seed.

He shook his head slightly, troubled by the thought. He sent the two men away to wait before answering, "Perhaps Protector Chen should go. There's no need for Fei Qing'yi to go. Take Fei Tongcai to gain his trust, and also find a few direct descendants of the Fei clan from the north bank who have been promoted because of their closeness to our family. Have them go together to welcome him. Using Fei Qing'yi's breakthrough as a reason to welcome him won't cause too much of a problem."

Chen Yang nodded respectfully. He did not take the opportunity to speak ill of the Fei family, but instead voiced his doubts. "This is bad news. I wonder if we will be in time... and as for the ore vein incident, there are almost certainly some tricks at play."

Li Jiangqian understood the trickery better than he did, which was why this Fei clansman had to be brought in. He shook his head and replied, "This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Jiangbei is so vast. The Capital immortals Dao and our family, our shadows here can't be erased. The True Monarch's script always needs actors. There's no way to avoid it, only to decide if the role is good or bad."

"If we can detect this in advance, it is a blessing in disguise. By bringing him in this way, we might not even run into the man himself. Things have only just begun to change. Everyone's cultivation shouldn't be too high yet. A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator at this time won't be an enemy, so nothing too terrible should happen... but if we don't bring him in, something terrible is bound to happen in the end."

Chen Yang nodded heavily, his head lowered, lost in thought. Li Jiangqian didn't really want him to go, but he didn't have many capable Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and each had their own shortcomings.

Cui Jueyin was skilled at internal affairs and acted with grace, but it would be difficult to get him to engage in deception or underhanded methods. Ding Weizeng was a fighting champion. Qu Bushi was clever, but old and cowardly, always trying to keep his head down. Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia had not yet broken through. He truly did not have a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator who was as steady and effective in both overt and covert actions as Chen Yang.

'It's best if I go with him in secret. I'll watch from the river. If anything truly happens, there will still be room to maneuver...'

As Chen Yang left the hall, Qu Bushi brought the Fei clansmen forward. They were all in high spirits after hearing the good news. Fei Tongcai had also collected himself and was waiting quietly outside the hall. Chen Yang put on a grave face, apologizing and sighing as if he had been overly impulsive just moments before, which made Fei Tongcai's forehead break out in a cold sweat, slightly easing the tension.

With a wide smile, Chen Yang took Fei Tongcai's arm and pulled him forward, offering a few words of congratulations. The Fei clansmen were soon full of laughter, and they flew north on the wind.

Upon reaching Jiangbei, the sun grew noticeably hotter, and the early spring chill was gone. Chen Yang chuckled. "The Capital immortals Dao is not on good terms with my family. All of you can wait on the riverbank while Fellow Daoist Tongcai and I go to retrieve him."

The purpose of the rest of the group was to prevent Fei Tongcai from having too much time alone with the other Fei clansman. Once he was retrieved, the clansman would simply be introduced to a group of Fei family members who had prospered under the Li family's rule. Chen Yang was too lazy to bring along this group of burdens, fearing they would stir up trouble.

When they reached Baihu County, the southernmost part of the Baiye Creek territory, the area was in utter chaos. The rule of the Hall of the Locust Soul was worse than no rule at all. Cultivators flew about the city as if it were an unowned realm.

Corpses littered the main road, a stench of death hanging in the air from the thick, yellow dust. There were no pedestrians, only a few people kneeling on the ground, groaning, whether from sickness or hunger.

Fei Tongcai frowned repeatedly at the sight. Chen Yang swept his spiritual sense across the area and said in a low voice, "It seems it's because the formation in Baihu County was destroyed... and the spiritual mineral dust from the ore vein has spread throughout the Baihu County area..."

Metal Malice and Metal Taint were lethal poisons to mortals. The former was often found in artifacts—the Li clan would even put away their artifacts when meeting mortals—while the latter was a cold and fierce toxin often found in ore veins. Back then, who knew how many people from the Rui clan had died mining Cuiyuan Copper Essence for the Xiao family due to this very toxin.

'This Protector Black Rat doesn't care about mortals... he'll just let them die...'

Fei Tongcai followed the instructions to the tearoom. The surroundings were indeed desolate. The courtyard was in disrepair, and the nearby streets were littered with corpses. It was impossible to find a place to stand.

Still, the tearoom was a place for cultivators and appeared clean and tidy. Standing far away, they saw a commotion. A group of people was kneeling on the ground, and a man in luxurious robes stood haughtily in the courtyard.

Amidst the kneeling cultivators, a slender figure stood. His handsome face was full of defiance as he listened to the man in luxurious robes shout.

"You dog! You dare to not kneel before me, the son of the esteemed County Governor!"

The handsome youth merely replied in a cold voice, "Why should I kneel to you? I, Lin Feng, only kneel to the heavens above and the earth below. Are you, a scoundrel who only relies on his father's prestige, worthy of making me kneel?"

He raised his head, and a certain imposing air emanated from his slender body. The scoundrel's face immediately contorted in anger. A retainer standing beside him stepped forward, his face grim, and said in a cold voice, "Kneel!"

Everyone was shocked. They saw that the retainer was a Qi Refining cultivator. A pair of delicate sisters nearby hurried to pull at the youth. "Brother Lin..."

But the youth stood unyielding. Soon, the crowd parted, and an old man came forward, whispering, "Please don't be angry... don't be angry. This old man is here to hand over the spiritual supplies to Protector Black Rat... please, for the Protector's sake..."

At his words, the retainer and the scoundrel hesitated, looking as if they were about to back down. But the youth took a step forward and shouted, "You, surnamed Wang! Do you dare to duel me?"

"Ridiculous!" The scoundrel named Wang's eyes turned cold. "You are just at the third layer of Embyronic Breathing! You dare to challenge my fifth layer? There is nothing I don't dare to do!"

"Good! Three months from now, you and I will fight a duel to the death right here! We shall not only determine who is superior but also who lives and who dies!"

Lin Feng's shout made the scoundrel named Wang laugh in anger. He gave the old man who had come to his aid a cold stare before flicking his sleeves and leaving, leaving behind a flurry of hushed discussions in the shop.

Chen Yang watched, frowning. He patted Fei Tongcai beside him, but Fei Tongcai just shook his head.

"This Baihu County is interesting. The stage is set so realistically... and the protagonist truly has a noble bearing. He is quite admirable."

Chen Yang gave him a quick look before slowly approaching. He nodded. "He is indeed an extraordinary person, one not easily seen on the Lake..."

Fei Tongcai had completely shed his previous caution and sorrow. He walked quickly into the tearoom, taking the old man's hand. "Hey! Second cousin, it's been a long time!"

The old man also recognized Fei Tongcai. He was full of shock. "Why have you come here... is the family...?"

"Qing'yi has broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm! We are here to bring you back to enjoy a life of ease!"

The two sighed with emotion. Fei Tongcai's face showed not a single trace of worry, completely immersed in the joy of seeing an old friend. Chen Yang, meanwhile, went to look at Lin Feng, his face now a picture of simple honesty. He patted the youth's shoulder and praised him.

"Good boy! I saw from afar just now. This is truly the demeanor of an Immortal Dao genius!"

"A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator!"

The courtyard erupted in a clamor. The group of cultivators knelt down in fear. While the son of the County Governor had only inspired fear of his authority, this person inspired fear from the bottom of their hearts. The two delicate sisters beside the youth also knelt, but the young man remained fearless, standing proudly. He bowed and said, "Greetings, Senior!"

Chen Yang nodded constantly, his expression full of admiration. He sighed. "In my life, I admire those who cannot be intimidated by power the most! And I despise those scoundrels and schemers with twisted minds! Good boy! For Jiangbei to produce such an unafraid person... it is indeed a blessed land!"

He pulled Lin Feng to a table and sat him down. "But in just three months, how can you defeat him?"

Lin Feng slowly shook his head, his eyes firm. "This junior has his own way!"

"Good!" Chen Yang praised him repeatedly. He reached into his sleeve and took out a talisman. "It's a pleasure to have met and spoken with you. If you ever face danger in the future, you can use this talisman to escape. Consider it a way to save a friend."

"Thank you, Senior!"

Chen Yang laughed heartily. "I am from Moongaze Lake. A cultivator from the Fei family has achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, and so has gained a higher status on the Lake. I am here to bring this elder back. He is about to have a breakthrough to Qi Refining... so he will cultivate on the Lake."

The two sisters by the youth's side gasped. Chen Yang smiled. "Seeing the two of you, you must also be from the Fei family. You are both truly beautiful... Do you have spiritual apertures? You can come and cultivate on the mountain as well."

The older sister hesitated, while the younger one looked disappointed. They spoke at the same time. "Brother Lin saved our lives. We only wish to cultivate by his side..."

But Lin Feng silently shook his head. "Qingya has a spiritual aperture and should naturally join the Moongaze Lake Sect to cultivate... as for Qingfei... she will have to suffer with me as we wander..."

The three of them became lost in their heartfelt conversation. Chen Yang watched with a smile, but drops of cold sweat rolled down his cheeks and into his collar. His lips trembled slightly, but he could not speak, only maintain the stiff smile on his face.

When Lin Feng's gaze finally turned to him, the subtle struggle on Chen Yang's face shattered instantly. A jovial smile appeared once more. He motioned to Fei Tongcai to come over, laughing.

"It's almost time to go. This is someone else's territory, after all, and our Daoist tradition is not on good terms with theirs, so we should not stay long..."

Fei Tongcai took the older of the two sisters by the hand, nodding repeatedly. His old cousin followed. Lin Feng sighed lightly, holding his sister as he saw them out of the hall. He spoke with deep affection.

"Qingya, don't worry... wait for me for three years! In three years, I will reach the Foundation Establishment Realm and personally go to Cold Cloud Peak to ask for your hand!"

The younger sister pouted with jealousy, while Fei Qingya's face flushed. His words were utterly absurd, yet no one present found it strange. Even Fei Tongcai nodded with a smile, his face full of gratification.

Chen Yang soared into the air with the group and flew south. Lin Feng silently put the talisman away. He raised his head and said in a cold voice, "The Wang Clan... covering the sky with a single hand, acting with impunity. Just you wait!"

Yellow sand swirled past him. He stood tall and proud as his cultivation rose. In just a few breaths, another Embyronic Breathing wheel had condensed within his body.
