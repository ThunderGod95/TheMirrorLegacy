# Chapter 786: Profound Adamant Essence Gathering

Xia Shouyu collapsed to the ground, kneeling, as the demon general writhed on the cave floor, screaming hoarsely.

"Daoist Master... Daoist Master, spare me..."

Li Ximing found him noisy. With a mere thought, the sound was muffled, sealed away from his senses. He smiled at the woman.

"Little Friend Xia, you chose well. This fellow is undoubtedly of the Valley Water attribute. Does he have any significant background? Any powerful friends or relatives? I would rather not make too large a disturbance and attract outside attention."

Xia Shouyu understood the implied meaning immediately. This old monster wanted to lie low and heal. Old monsters like this often had enemies, most likely powerful champions of the orthodox path. If she caused trouble that drew them here, she would be crushed like a bedbug.

She nodded repeatedly. "Daoist Master! This creature is just a demon general of Sea's Cape known as King Qiu. This area is simply too remote; even the Dragon-kin of the Admirable Sea never venture here. His only connections are with the few other Foundation Establishment demons that have passed through over the years and some local small-fry. Even if this whole group died, it’s unlikely anyone would notice..."

Li Ximing didn't fully trust the words of a mere Qi Refining cultivator.

'This lesser demon has some brains,' he thought. 'Although he didn't march here with drums and banners, he still brought his trusted subordinates. If they all die here together, it will certainly draw unwanted gazes. It is better to keep the ripples small.'

Seeing his silence, Xia Shouyu feared he was hatching some scheme and would use her as his vanguard. Hoping he would choose discretion, she quickly added in a low voice:

"This demon is manageable. But I have heard that if you travel due west from here, across the sea, you reach the Peacock Sea. Within that sea is Nine Mounds Mountain. A great power with divine abilities resides on that mountain, one whose might is infinite, capable of making the dead speak and the living ascend. An emissary from that mountain came to Sea's Cape over sixty years ago to accept disciples... so they are clearly still paying attention."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing deduced this must be a Purple Mansion cultivator, the closest one to this edge of Sea's Cape. "What is his name?" he murmured. "What does he cultivate? What else is he known for?"

Xia Shouyu quickly kowtowed. "This lowly one does not know! I only hear that a great power often travels to and from that immortal mountain. That great power possesses a gourd. More than a decade ago, a golden talisman lit up the sky above Sea's Cape, and shimmering light rained down like gauze. A gourd the size of a mountain appeared. It must have been him sparring with another great power."

Li Ximing had never heard of any expert with a gourd, but he noted the location warily. He waved his hand for Xia Shouyu to stop, then looked down at the sea earthworm.

"You monster. You just had to run straight into my hands. Who do you truly serve?"

The demon general wailed, "My lord! I am from the Zhu South Mansion Water! Daoist Master! I offended you unintentionally, please, on behalf of the Mansion Water... spare this lowly demon's life!"

As the demon shouted, he untied the storage bag from his waist and dumped everything out. A flashy, pathetic pile of junk spilled out, pathetically poor and sparse, mostly items corrupted with blood-qi. The worthlessness of the hoard was breathtaking; he was poorer than a standard Qi Refining disciple from a major Jiangnan sect.

Trembling, he plucked a single jade bottle from the mess and offered it up miserably. "This is something this lowly one acquired by chance. I offer it to the Daoist Master!"

"Haha!"

Li Ximing glanced at it. It was an ancient-method pill; there was no telling if it was even still effective. He found the situation laughable. He had intended to listen to the demon's pleading and see if he could be utilized, but he couldn't be bothered with such a clumsy lie. He lifted the lump of flesh, slightly relaxed the pressure of his divine ability to allow the demon to regain its humanoid form, and snapped:

"Utter nonsense! The Zhu South Mansion Water is far south of the Vermillion Sea. This is the Eastern Sea's Cape! It would take you a year and a half just to fly here from there, and you dare feed me this garbage!"

Li Ximing's own Zongquan Island was near the Zhu South Mansion Water; he knew the region far better than this demon. The effeminate man broke out in a cold sweat, trembling.

"Reporting to my lord! This lowly demon... once served under Lord Yun Shaozi in the Mansion Water. Later, I left to seek my fortune and eventually ended up here at Sea's Cape..."

"Enough!" Li Ximing cut him off, a mocking smile playing on his lips. "Call your subordinates down. Tell them you need to study this formation in detail and are dismissing them. Have them return to your mansion to stand guard. Leave two behind to watch this island, and let no one know you are here."

A thousand calculations and ten thousand schemes might have raced through the demon's mind, knowing his death was imminent, but he was completely powerless. Even if he wanted to furrow his brow or mouth a silent warning to his men, faced with a divine ability, he could not manage a single superfluous expression.

He could only meekly give the orders to the demons waiting above. Li Ximing, augmented by the Immortal Mirror and supervised by his divine ability, watched everything clearly. The demon general was unable to cause the slightest disturbance. The crowd of demons, suspecting nothing, departed together.

Using the Immortal Mirror to scan them from afar and confirming the group showed no abnormalities, Li Ximing returned to the cave. He retrieved a pitch-black alchemy cauldron from his storage bag. It landed with a thud. It was covered in complex patterns of ocean waves and fierce beasts, standing firmly on three legs.

The River-Center Cauldron.

In truth, now that Li Ximing had advanced to the Purple Mansion Realm, a cauldron was no longer essential for his alchemy. This was especially true for the River-Center Cauldron, which wasn't even a Foundation Establishment artifact. But this was a life-saving pill he was refining; he had to be exceptionally cautious.

The demon's face was ashen. In an instant, he reverted to his true form. Li Ximing lifted the carcass, commenting idly, "Yun Shaozi, really? That old cloud-octopus has been dead for years!"

The gap in information between a Jiangnan Purple Mansion cultivator and a Sea's Cape Foundation Establishment demon was simply too vast. What this demon general considered his most secret information was nothing but a joke to Li Ximing. As he inspected the carcass, he saw its dharma power churning violently, emitting pinpricks of gray qi. Li Ximing couldn't help but click his tongue.

'Such fine Valley Water potential, yet he failed to nurture it properly. He stuffed his cultivation with this much blood sacrifice.'

He pondered for a moment, adjusting his plan. He set aside the Serpent Origin Spirit Water he originally intended to use, replacing it with the Baleful Earth Coldspring and adding Clear Dusk Spirit Flower to neutralize the immense demonic qi in the body. Most of the Li family's valuable spirit items were on his person, so he quickly assembled the ingredients.

He opened the cauldron and began refining. Purple fire raged, casting his silhouette onto the stone wall, the shadow leaping and dancing. Xia Shouyu, still kneeling, grew increasingly uneasy. Her eyelids twitched, uncertain of the magnitude of the evil she had just facilitated.

'How long will this old monster refine this pill... If he buries his head in alchemy for ten or twenty years, I'll miss my chance... I'll be trapped in this place until I die.'

She knelt in the bright firelight for two full days and nights. Then, the flames unexpectedly began to recede. Xia Shouyu was astounded. She suddenly saw the old monster slap the cauldron lid.

"Rise!"

Instantly, a clear, pure fragrance permeated the cave. Xia Shouyu felt she had never smelled anything so wonderful. The rich medicinal aroma flooded her senses, rushing to her mind until she felt ecstatic, unsure of where she even was. Then she heard a dull *thud*.

*Bang!*

The cauldron lid flew high. A string of seven pills shot out, each one a blue-white orb etched with luminous purple patterns. They fell, one by one, obediently into Li Ximing’s palm, chiming against each other with the crisp sound of glass.

"Success!"

A sudden joy surged in Li Ximing. Seeing seven pills, he couldn't help but laugh aloud. With a flick of his finger, all seven pills rolled neatly into a jade bottle.

'A joyous surprise!'

What Li Ximing had just refined was not based on some long-existing recipe. He had used the Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill as a foundation, combined it with the profound Valley Water spirit pill method he had read about in the Purple Smoke sect—Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction—and tailored it perfectly to his own injuries. To refine seven pills in a single attempt was proof that his Alchemy Dao had already leaped beyond the bounds of the Xiao Clan lineage. He could truly be called a Purple Mansion Alchemist.

"Good... Based on the Profound Adamant (Xuánquè) refining method and gathering essence (Yùncuì) using the Heavenly Oneness technique... I will call it the Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pill!"

He roared with laughter, terrifying Xia Shouyu, who immediately began kowtowing like a pestle pounding garlic. "Congratulations, Daoist Master, on the creation of this divine medicine! Congratulations, Daoist Master, on taking another step forward!..."

Li Ximing found her praise bizarre and somewhat inauspicious. He stopped laughing. Without giving the woman another glance, he silently retrieved one pill. The purple patterns on its surface were still glowing faintly, exquisitely beautiful.

The moment the pill entered his stomach, pure Valley Water power began to circulate. Under Li Ximing’s guidance, it surged entirely toward his Juque Palace. The Juque Palace, acting as the "Valley", allowed the pill’s nurturing, latent power to disperse instantly, bringing a cooling sensation throughout the palace.

At once, the rushing gray water of the curse rose from within the Juque Palace, surrounding the technique-fire. Li Ximing seized the opportunity to suppress the external flames on his body. The Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art resonated inside and out, and the internal black fire immediately flared.

He sat cross-legged. The technique-fire that had been burning relentlessly on his Dharma body for so long was finally extinguished, transferred completely back into the Juque Palace. There, it was immediately suppressed by the Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pill, unable to spread.

Witnessing this, Li Ximing finally let out a long, heavy breath. When he slowly opened his eyes, the colorful light of a divine ability flashed within them. He exhaled slowly.

"Finally suppressed!"

The pill worked. This meant Li Ximing no longer had to walk around wreathed in flames; he could finally move freely. The Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pill was still slowly consuming the fire within his Juque Palace. While one pill wouldn't last forever, Li Ximing had six more. They could support him for a year, perhaps a year and a half. He might not even need to refine subsequent pills; the technique-fire might be completely extinguished by the combined efforts of his divine ability and the pills alone.

*BOOM!*

With the flames gone, the cave became vast and pitch-black. The black water vein on the ground was still erupting with a violent roar, and the spring water from the surface above began to pour back in, mingling green and black in a dazzling, chaotic display.

Li Ximing grabbed Xia Shouyu and flew out of the cave. The lake's temperature had already dropped. The vibrant green of Pristine Water rapidly faded to the black of Mansion Water water.

The two lesser demons were still standing guard dumbly by the lakeside. Li Ximing knew these two certainly captured humans to satisfy their cravings on normal days. He swept his gaze over them, and both demons’ heads fell to the ground. He tossed Xia Shouyu down.

"Collect their things. And move the people off this island."

Xia Shouyu was confused. Now that this devil was out of seclusion, eating everyone on the island—human and demon alike—would require less effort than speaking a sentence. She could only obey, packing up the two demons' remains, and said respectfully, "There are so many savages... I cannot move them alone... I must return and ask for help to transport them."

Li Ximing himself was poor and didn't even own a spirit boat. He waved his sleeve dismissively. "Fine, then! Forget it. Just lead the way..."

'Lead the way where... where else could we go... Naturally, to my lineage's home, Qingxu Temple...'

Xia Shouyu's heart hammered with anxiety. She glanced up and realized the old monster had grown facial features. His glabella shone with heavenly light, like a true immortal. His face was balanced and proper, his eyebrows smooth, but his eyes were a pale, unsettling gold.

What could she say? She was the one who had released this terrifying master of divine abilities. Was there a second path for her to walk now? She silently began to lead the way, her expression a mask of terror she couldn't control.

Li Ximing, however, felt refreshed and invigorated. Standing in the wind, the sea breeze had never felt so crisp. He took out the jade bottle the demon had given him.

Li Ximing studied it for a moment, his resolve hardening.

'I will absolutely not return to Jiangnan until this injury is healed! This Sea's Cape has a truly ancient feel. I will wander a bit and find a way to get news from home.'

Li Ximing possessed the Immortal Mirror. In a desolate place like Sea's Cape—where in some areas the Great Void didn't even exist—he feared no one. If Changxiao dared to chase him here, the Immortal Mirror would deal with him in a single exchange. His confidence was absolute.

As for the pill in his hand, it was worthless. However, the refinement technique was ancient, seemingly involving the gathering of the essence of heaven, earth, sun, and moon. Li Ximing saw this clearly and felt a stir of interest.

'The refinement method for this... I wonder if it still exists at Sea's Cape. If I could obtain a recipe for refining lunar essence into pills, that would be an infinite, endless supply of resources...'

A method for refining lunar essence into pills would, of course, require more than just moonlight. But Li Ximing considered himself a Purple Mansion Alchemist now. With such a recipe in hand, he could devise countless modifications. Even just using lunar essence to replace one or two key spirit items in other recipes would be an enormous gain.

Xia Shouyu did not dare to delay. After flying over the sea for some time, a peak rose from the ocean surface, crowned by a large complex of temples. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow and murmured, "Oh? A temple?"

Xia Shouyu felt a chill shoot straight to her brain. This man was clearly a great demon; he most likely despised Buddhists. Fearing a misunderstanding, she rushed to explain:

"Reporting to Daoist Master! My lineage is Qingxu Temple! We once worshiped a great divine power known as Xu Xiang, hence the temple... We are not related to the Modern Buddhists or the Ancient Buddhists! Please, my lord, see clearly!"

'Tongxuan Palace's Xu Xiang!'

Li Ximing was familiar with the name. Sumian's profound Dao lineage revered Xu Xiang of Tongxuan Palace as its patriarch. He nodded slightly. "Ah, the lineage of the True Monarch of Treasured Earth. Rare indeed."

Xia Shouyu clearly had not expected Li Ximing to recognize the name. Her heart skipped a beat as she mentally filed away the title "True Monarch of Treasured Earth."

The demon-like master raised an eyebrow. "You also know of Ancient and Modern Buddhists?"

Xia Shouyu said respectfully, "Reporting to Daoist Master, there are Ancient Buddhist lineages at Sea's Cape, but few Modern Buddhists stop here. Most of the lineages at Sea's Cape are temples, but they worship ancient great powers, not many actual Buddhist figures."

Li Ximing nodded at her words, a strange look in his eyes. He wondered if that flock of grasping Buddhists disdained coming here, or if they *could not* come here. He smiled.

"The Modern Buddhists are mostly shameless cowards who bully the weak and fear the strong. Since you all worship an Immortal Dao True Monarch, I suppose they don't dare to go too far."

He stood in the clouds, looking down at the layout below with keen interest. Xia Shouyu waited respectfully by his side, watching as the cultivator smiled.

"Shouldn't you go down first and prepare everyone? If I descend from the sky just like this, I'll frighten everyone in your lineage unconscious. That probably wouldn't be a good thing."
