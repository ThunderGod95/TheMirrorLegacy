# Chapter 668: The Heart of all under the Heavens

The young man was brimming with confidence, as if dispersing this motley crew of rogue cultivators was the easiest thing in the world. Li Qinghong was slightly taken aback.

"Fellow Daoist, what are you...?" she began softly.

Xi Zikang gave a soft chuckle and shook out his silver-white sleeves. He produced a small, gleaming silver chariot, no bigger than his palm. Two tiny blue-and-white flags, inscribed with runes, were planted on it. He intoned a command:

"By the authority of the Profound Thunder Division, by the command of the Northern Palace, ride the chariot, command the lightning, save the world and cure its ills!"

The thunder chariot trembled and instantly sprang to life. It leaped with the powerful, heavy momentum of a pouncing tiger, swelling in an instant to the size of a house. The two blue-and-white thunder banners fluttered high, crackling with silver lightning that stretched over a hundred feet in the wind.

"My Profound Thunder path whips the wind and commands the storm... scattering a few cultivators is nothing!"

Thunderclouds roiled in the sky as a storm began to churn the sea below. Xi Zikang landed on the chariot, gripped the silvery reins, and ascended with the tempest. "Senior," he called out, his voice clear and resonant, "I only need ten breaths."

The sea was already being torn apart by a raging gale. Darkness fell, so thick and gray you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. The only light came from the magnificent, ancient thunder chariot, which blazed with a dazzling silver brilliance. Its two banners trailed behind it like a pair of lightning serpents.

Clad in his shimmering silver robes, Xi Zikang looked like a god commanding the thunder, an image of awesome might.

'Of course,' Li Qinghong thought. 'He's from one of the North Sea's most renowned Purple Mansion immortal clans. His lineage must trace back to the Thunder Palaces... he's no ordinary cultivator.'

The boy was young, friendly, and respectful, with no extravagant adornments. For a moment, she had forgotten his noble origins. But now, seeing the majesty of his chariot, she realized it rivaled even the one Tuoba Chongyuan once possessed.

'The great lightning-wielding clans and sects of the North Sea are truly remnants of the old Thunder Palaces,' she mused. 'This magnificent chariot is proof enough.'

In a flash, Xi Zikang had driven the storm forward. A deep gloom fell over the Eastern Sulphur Islands, plunging the assembled cultivators into blinding darkness. They all looked up just as silver lightning rained down from the heavens, sending them scattering in chaos.

This group was a patchwork force from various powers to begin with. Seized by terror, they broke apart. The three Foundation Establishment cultivators among them shot into the air, ready to hurl curses, but the words died on their lips when they saw the noble, domineering chariot. Their expressions changed, and they hesitated, not daring to approach.

Xi Zikang, however, simply formed a seal. He tore a length of lightning from the sky as if ripping a bolt of white cloth and casually smashed it down on the three men's heads. "The Eastern Sea is full of demonic cultivators, after all!" he said coldly.

The three were rogue cultivators of the Eastern Sea. One reeked of blood qi, the other two of turbid energy. How could they possibly withstand such pure Profound Thunder? They were scared witless, crying out in misery as they turned to flee.

But the spell, though seemingly casual, was of an extremely high grade. The lightning was inherently swift. The three cultivators were instantly overwhelmed, trailing thick black smoke as they escaped.

Xi Zikang was momentarily stunned, thinking to himself in surprise, 'Their cultivation is pathetic... The Eastern Sea is vast, but it's the domain of the dragon lineage. The endless treasures of the deep are inaccessible, and they're isolated on these few islands... What good resources could they possibly have?'

He had misjudged. The three had no intention of fighting him. Most who survived in the Eastern Sea were cautious. Seeing such a grand display and such a luxurious vehicle, anyone could tell he was the direct descendant of an immortal clan. They didn't dare say another word, simply fleeing for their lives and praying he wouldn't give chase.

He had only meant to pin them down but had underestimated his own strength. Now, they had vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving the entire sea around the Eastern Sulphur Islands deserted. He circled twice in his thunder chariot before sheepishly recalling it.

"Impressive, Fellow Daoist."

Li Qinghong approached with a smile. Xi Zikang looked slightly embarrassed. Just then, the grand array below them flickered, and an old man in a red robe flew out. He glanced around cautiously before calling out from a distance.

"Which senior graces us with their presence?"

This was a Li family matter, so Xi Zikang remained silent, turning his head slightly. Li Qinghong simply nodded without replying. The old man looked at them for a few seconds, and then understanding dawned. He flew closer in a rush.

"So it is—"

"Ah," Li Qinghong cut him off. The old man caught his mistake and, upon reaching them, lowered his voice. "Seniors, please, come into the array to speak!"

Li Qinghong didn't want to waste time. "There's no need," she said gently.

The future of this sea voyage was uncertain. She had not only left the Chongming Profound Insight Screen behind but even the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman. She murmured something to Xi Zikang, who nodded in understanding. He then took a small, apricot-colored pagoda from his sleeve and activated it, enveloping them in a barrier that sealed them off from the outside world.

The action startled the red-robed elder, but he gritted his teeth and stood his ground, allowing the pagoda's light to surround them. Only then did Li Qinghong speak.

"May I know which Fellow Daoist you are?"

"This humble one is Han Shihai! I had the honor of meeting the Immortal once before..."

"It's you!"

Li Qinghong actually recognized him. This was the man who had received her during her last visit to the islands. But back then, he had been a middle-aged man. Now, his hair was white, and his aura was completely different.

A look of profound gratitude filled Han Shihai's eyes. "I have exhausted my lifespan maintaining the clan's array. I must be a laughable sight to you, Immortal..."

Han Shihai had reached the end of his rope. Tears streamed down his aged face as he poured out his story.

Han Shizhen and his servant had been the pillars of the Han family. After their abrupt deaths in the dragon lineage's territory, the family's strength had plummeted. The situation was already perilous when the Han family's patriarch, who had been in seclusion trying to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, was caught completely off guard by the celestial phenomenon of "water falling and thunder rising." He was cultivating the 'Returning to Earth' path of Earth Virtue. He lasted only a year before his own breakthrough failed, transforming into another celestial omen.

Neighboring powers had immediately pounced. The remaining Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Han family had been killed one by one, leaving only Han Shihai and a female cultivator. They were trapped, prepared for the clan's utter destruction, hoping only to escape with their lives.

Han Shihai could never have imagined, not in ten days and nights of thinking, that Li Qinghong would be the one to save them. Overwhelmed by joy and sorrow, tears flowed freely, and he nearly fell to his knees.

Li Qinghong held him up. "Your family has operated in the Eastern Sea for many years," she said in a low voice. "Do you have any information on the Miao family of the Southern Sea?"

Without asking why, Han Shihai searched his storage pouch and produced a jade slip. "My benefactor," he said solemnly, "the Miao family once had business dealings with us. Everything we know is recorded here."

Li Qinghong accepted it but didn't look at it immediately. "Good," she said softly. "We have only scared these people off for now. You must hurry and arrange for your clansmen to evacuate. If you delay, they will surely return the moment we leave."

"Ah?"

Han Shihai was utterly confused. He had already prepared himself for the Han family to be absorbed by the Li family and had been acting with the deference of a subordinate. Li Qinghong's words shattered all his assumptions.

'But! But why would they help us for no reason at all!'

His century of experience surviving in the Eastern Sea failed him completely. He stared blankly at Li Qinghong and stammered, "Immortal, you first covered for my family before the great sects, and now you have saved us from ruin... How could we possibly just leave..."

Li Qinghong laughed. "You are a cultivator of the Eastern Sea, yet you speak such words. I told you to go, so go. Did you think I came here just to take a pound of flesh from you?"

Seeing the deep confusion on the old man's face, she grew serious. "The deaths of your family members were connected to my clan's affairs... and our friendship still stands. It is a small thing to lend a hand now that your clan has fallen on hard times. Say no more, Senior. Go, quickly, and take your people."

Han Shihai could now hear the sincerity in her voice. He choked back a sob. "Immortal, your kindness is as immense as a mountain. My own lifespan is spent; I will be gone in a few days and can never repay this debt... This grace of rebirth, the Han family will remember it... If there is a next life, we will repay you, even if we must serve as horses or dogs..."

Saving the Han family was a matter of fulfilling an obligation, but Li Qinghong didn't want to become too entangled. "My clan is also treading on thin ice," she replied softly. "I likely won't live to see that day. Go now, and find another path for survival. Do not mention my Li family, lest you bring disaster upon your own."

Han Shihai was overcome with grief. He covered his face and bowed his farewell, then shot back to the island like the wind. Spirit boats rose into the air, and a procession of people departed in a flurry of activity. Only after they had vanished from sight did Li Qinghong and Xi Zikang ascend on a bolt of lightning.

The young man was visibly moved. He flew in silence for a long time.

"Fellow Daoist," Li Qinghong began, "do you know about the matter of the Thunder Palaces? The whole world seems to be in an uproar..."

"Of course, I know!" Xi Zikang answered, a little distractedly. "The Immortal Lords left this world, and two new Earth Virtue True Monarchs ascended at the same time. The sects and clans had been suppressed for too long. Heaven and Earth were of one mind, so the Twelve Thunder Palaces naturally collapsed. There's not much more to it."

Seeing her thoughtful expression, he seemed to know her next question. "As for the common people suffering under the Thunder Palaces for ages... Earth Virtue represents the state and the people's livelihood. 'The people hear what I hear, the people see what I see. My heart is the heart of the world.' With the world in turmoil, is their rebellion not normal? It was all decided in a single thought!" he said dismissively. "I know what you're thinking. I've heard all the arguments against the Thunder Palaces. I just smile and say nothing."

'My heart is the heart of the world... How utterly terrifying!'

Having lived on the mainland in the current era after the great changes, Li Qinghong had hardly ever met a proper Earth Virtue cultivator. The only one of any note was Changxi, a Purple Mansion cultivator who focused purely on arts and techniques. This was the first time she had heard of the true divine arts of the Earth Virtue path, and she was secretly horrified.

'If that's the case... it's no wonder that only the arts and techniques of Earth Virtue remain... A single thought to command the will of the people—which power could ever tolerate that?'

A heaviness settled in her heart. She was silent for a long time, other speculations forming in her mind. 'Qingxuan is also of the Earth Virtue path, but he doesn't seem to follow the way of state and people. Perhaps only two of the five types of earth possess such divine power.'

Of the Five Virtues, the Five Waters, Five Fires, and Three Metals were well-known, but the others were obscure. Li Qinghong tried to probe for more information, but Xi Zikang either didn't know or wasn't willing to say.

'I wonder what technique the Han patriarch was cultivating. Was the 'water falling and thunder rising' that killed him intentional or a coincidence? Only people like Xi Zikang would know such secrets...'

She was lost in thought. Xi Zikang, however, was still pondering Han Shihai's words. After a long silence, he said in a low voice, "I always thought that those who practiced demonic arts were all unpardonable villains. But to think they could have such devotion, to burn away their own lifespan to protect their kin... My clan practices the righteous laws of Profound Thunder... but it would be hard to find many who are like him."

Li Qinghong said softly, "The Eastern Sea is rife with Blood Pills. Demonic arts and techniques are widespread. Even a normal cultivator's hands are stained with blood. That is why they all seem like villains in your eyes..."

Xi Zikang paused, a pained look on his face. "But he consumed the Blood Pills. He cultivated the demonic arts. No matter how devoted he was, no matter his reasons, he cannot wash away the turbid blood in his veins. While I admire the man, if I were to meet him in the Northern Sea, I would still have to strike him down with my lightning."

"My clan's Daoist Master once said that the fault is not theirs, but the evil is. Even if we lack the power to cleanse the world of all demons and right all wrongs, we cannot turn a blind eye to the evils we can subdue."

Li Qinghong opened her mouth to speak, then fell silent. She didn't know how to respond. A dark thought crossed her mind. 'His ancestors followed the Dao of the Thunder Palaces. It seems they weren't as villainous as the Shen family's texts claimed, but they lacked compassion all the same. The entanglements of the ancient past are a mess. The Wei-Li name is no better... There's nothing to be said...'

She changed course, turning toward Yuezhou Island, the home of the Profound Peak Gate. 'This news is too important. I'll use the Profound Peak Gate to send a letter home.'

***

**Moongaze Lake**

Li Zhouwei had finished setting his affairs in order. With his father, Li Chengliao, in seclusion, he had arranged for his elders—Li Minggong and Li Chenghuai—to oversee things before heading to the main hall.

Bai Rong was wandering barefoot through the hall, with Li Xuanxuan following beside him. The old man seemed to be in high spirits, laughing and chatting.

There were very few people Li Xuanxuan could truly open up to. He loved to speak of the past, but there was almost no one left who could share those memories with him. By now, it was only Li Qiuyang, Chen Donghe, and An Zheyan.

But Li Qiuyang had been grievously injured and then burned by the Merging Fire; he now looked ancient beyond his years. When Li Xuanxuan visited, they could barely exchange a few words. Chen Donghe and An Zheyan were always too respectful to speak freely.

But this fellow Bai Rong, with his grumbling and muttering, had somehow managed to get Li Xuanxuan talking. From outside the hall, Li Zhouwei could hear peals of laughter and felt reluctant to interrupt.

He waited only a few moments before Bai Rong came scurrying out. After bidding the old man farewell, Li Xuanxuan, who would never dream of hindering the younger generation's business, saw them off with a smile.

Once they had taken to the air and left the lake behind, Bai Rong said grimly, "My white fox clan has some ability to read the hearts of men. That old man carries a great deal of sorrow. His later years have not been easy."

A rare shadow of gloom fell over Li Zhouwei.

Bai Rong began pulling artifacts out of his sleeves as he muttered, "You had better cultivate properly. Don't go out looking for fights. The hot-headed ones all die sooner or later. And don't be like those elders of yours, throwing their lives away for the clan... Live a long time, so you don't break that old man's heart again."

"I understand, Senior," Li Zhouwei replied with genuine sincerity.

Bai Rong tossed a spirit boat into the air. In an instant, it transformed into a simple, unadorned wooden pushcart. Its two wheels were crooked, the bark was crudely peeled in uneven patches, and a few branches still stuck out here and there.

Bai Rong introduced it with great pride. "This is my demon carriage! I used it to ferry the kits in my clan back in the Northern Foothills! When I came to the cave, I refined it into a proper vehicle. You are the very first White Qilin to ride it!"

"Right..."

Li Zhouwei found the situation rather bizarre. It was the first time he had ever seen anyone travel by pushcart. He sat cross-legged in the cart as Bai Rong settled beside him, grinning for reasons unknown as he summoned a gust of green wind.

"Let's go!"
