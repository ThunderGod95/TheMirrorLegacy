# Chapter 673: The Deer's Transformation

'Bai Rong holds no ill will toward me,' Li Zhouwei mused. 'But this involves Mount Dali. The dragon and fox clans had a poor relationship before, and now I'm the one tasked with conveying messages... perhaps this is their attempt to change that.'

He carefully recalled Bai Rong’s words, and the situation gradually became clearer.

'The main reason the two clans can even consider reconciliation is the death of their common enemy, Dongfang You. But a strained relationship isn't mended simply because a rival is dead. The fox clan is being proactive, and the dragons are being remarkably gracious. It's likely they are being pressured by an external force…'

'If they share a common enemy, and this new attempt at an alliance pivots on observing Mount Luoxia's secrets... and if I, a Wei-Li descendant with a deep-seated hatred for Mount Luoxia, am meant to be the linchpin... then the answer seems obvious.'

Li Zhouwei maintained a pleasant smile, his golden eyes betraying no hint of his sharp thoughts, but his mind grew ever more lucid.

'It's Mount Luoxia forcing them to turn from enemies to friends. But why act only now? Is it because of something Mount Luoxia has done... or is about to do?'

The Azurewater Scaled-Beast glided smoothly through the water. Melodious music filled the hall, mingling with the sweet fragrance of spiritual fruits and fine wine. Yet Li Zhouwei felt as if he were in the eye of a hurricane. The political storm was gathering, a tempest of shimmering clouds and radiant light, involving Mount Luoxia, the dragons, the foxes, and countless other powers lurking in the shadows.

'Compared to even the weakest of them, the fox clan, my Li family is no larger than an ant.'

'Most importantly... does Mount Luoxia know? And what is *his* perspective on all this?'

Dingjiao had repeatedly assured him that the day's events would be hidden from any divination, but Li Zhouwei didn't take the words to heart. He treated them as mere pleasantries, and his worries were not the least bit assuaged.

'When I was first invited to the Flood Dragon Palace, how could the Purple Mansion cultivators of Jiangnan not know? My family has sought out the foxes several times—how could the nearby Purple Mansion cultivators not be aware? Even my departure from the lake and boarding the Azurewater Scaled-Beast in the Southern Sea happened in plain sight! None of it was a secret!'

'Why would anyone need divination for this? A simple deduction of the cause and effect would reveal seventy or eighty percent of the truth! What exactly is Dingjiao trying to keep secret? Is it only our entry into the abyss?'

Facing the Dragon Prince, whose smile was so warm and inviting, Li Zhouwei felt no sense of ease. His heart was as still as a tranquil lake.

'This prince's standing is higher than that of an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator. While he is certainly trying to befriend me... could he have other motives?'

The mists of uncertainty before him offered no real clues. The black-armored demon had already presented the stone box, setting it before him and lifting the lid. A soft light emerged, shimmering within.

Li Zhouwei remained composed as he glanced inside. The box contained a casket of transparent, crystal-clear spirit water. Its color was so faint it was nearly invisible, with only a bright yellow reflection floating on its surface and nothing else.

He swept his spiritual sense over it and felt an overwhelming spiritual energy from the water, but the reflection had no apparent source.

Dongfang Dingjiao chuckled and waved his hand, silencing the music and dancing in the hall. "Minghuang," he said softly, "this is called Concealed Plunder Gold. It is formed when the sun's essence falls into the deep sea. It cannot be seen with the eyes or detected by the senses. Even placed right before you, unless you have cultivated a divine ability, you wouldn't notice a thing."

"The casket holds Serpent Origin Spirit Water," he explained. "My dragon lineage uses it to wash the horns on our foreheads, while humans often use it to cultivate eye techniques. The Concealed Plunder Gold only casts a reflection in this type of spirit water. We use the water to locate it."

Li Zhouwei had heard of Serpent Origin Spirit Water before. A similar, precious substance called Clear Origin Spirit Water was used within the sea for eye-cultivation techniques. Yet here was an entire casket of it.

'And it's just being used to illuminate the Concealed Plunder Gold. A thin layer on the bottom would have sufficed, yet he used a whole casket. The wealth of the dragons is truly astonishing.'

Dingjiao added that the dragons used it simply to wash their horns, implying it was no rare treasure. He showed no regret in using it so lavishly, focusing instead on the invisible gold. "This is a Supreme Yang spiritual item with a unique property. It can be placed within the Shengyang, Juque, or Qihai acupoints to assist in cultivating one's dharma light. It is of great benefit to almost all forms of dharma light!"

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei silently circulated the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light within him. Though his spiritual sense couldn't perceive the object, he could feel his technique stirring with anticipation.

'This is indeed a fine treasure. It must be a rare and special Supreme Yang item, otherwise a man of Dingjiao's temperament would never have brought it out.'

This Dragon Prince had offered an ancient spiritual artifact at their first meeting—how could any ordinary item catch his eye? Even the Serpent Origin Spirit Water was just a tool to reveal this true treasure. With a serious expression, Li Zhouwei nodded.

"I have done little more than make a trip, exerting no real effort. I am unworthy of such a gift, but I will remember this kindness in my heart. Thank you, Your Highness!"

Seeing that he didn't refuse, the frown that had started to form on Dingjiao's brow relaxed. He smiled and nodded, then turned to Bai Rong.

"This Mysterious Jin Purple Fire," he said softly, "was obtained by a Luan-Phoenix senior by chance during her travels in the Western Sea many years ago. A Fire Luan who visited me some years back gifted it to me."

"But after much thought, my dragon lineage commands the races of the water. We have no use for this Mysterious Jin Purple Fire. It is far more valuable to your fox clan than it is to us."

"The elders of our two families have already discussed this, so I won't say more. Bai Rong, please accept it."

Bai Rong was visibly taken aback, as if the value of the Mysterious Jin Purple Fire exceeded his expectations. He accepted with clear delight. Dingjiao, greatly pleased, clapped his hands, and a troupe of women in purple robes hurried into the hall.

"Come."

Dongfang Dingjiao raised his cup. The purple-robed women began to dance, their robes revealing purplish-green shrimp tails that swished back and forth. They were clearly a troupe of shrimp demons, and their dance was quite distinctive.

'He is a dragon, after all,' Li Zhouwei thought. 'Not once on this entire journey has the banquet's entertainment been repeated. There have been shrimp, clams, crabs, and snakes... the dragons truly put effort into these matters.'

Li Zhouwei raised his cup, and the conversation continued amidst the music and dancing. Dingjiao was keen on building a friendship, and Bai Rong and Li Zhouwei were happy to reciprocate. The atmosphere was joyful and harmonious.

Outside the hall, the water rushed past, a blur of turquoise and red. The Azurewater Flood Dragon was speeding towards the Eastern Sea under a sky thick with dark clouds, where bolts of lightning slithered and surged.

***

Moongaze Lake.

The great hall on Pingya Island was quiet. A few cultivators hurried past as Li Jiangqian strode swiftly down the long flight of stairs. His features had matured in the past two years. Behind him, several figures stumbled to keep up.

"Your Highness!"

The two men were not young, their hair white with age. Judging by their robes, they were tutors. But Li Jiangqian was nimble. He slipped through a group of guards with a swish, leaving the two men far behind.

The tutors could only stop, sighing in exasperation.

Li Jiangqian was growing older and had lost his patience for elementary studies. Skipping lessons was a common occurrence. They knew which direction he was headed—he was surely going to find Li Que'wan. Since they were forbidden from entering her inner hall, they could only stop here.

"I used to marvel at His Highness's intelligence... why does he dislike his studies so much now? It is Que'wan who is the diligent one, with a benevolent heart..."

"Indeed..."

The two sighed and had no choice but to retreat.

Li Jiangqian, however, ran all the way to a different hall, pushing the heavy doors open with a creak.

Inside, the desk was neat and the books on the shelves were perfectly arranged. As he opened the door, a ray of golden light fell upon the girl before him.

"Que'wan!"

Li Shuwan had been formally accepted into the clan at the lake and her name changed to Li Que'wan. Her attire was brighter now, her complexion much healthier. Her eyes shone, and a small peach blossom was pinned in her hair. She covered her mouth and giggled.

"Brother Qian, skipping class again... You'll get an earful tomorrow!"

"What of it? They'll just nag a little. As long as they don't report me to the elders, they can't do anything to me."

Li Jiangqian took a bamboo box from his sleeve and placed it on the desk with a clatter. He opened it to reveal several snow-white pastries. Li Que'wan thanked him but then furrowed her little brow.

"Brother Qian, the tutors are teaching the great principles of human relations, the separation of immortal and mortal, the unity of the great families, and the governance of the clan branches. You are to be the head of the family one day. How can you not listen?"

Li Jiangqian chuckled, looking at her with a smile. He pulled out a few of his own cultivation manuals and shook his head. "That's just the talk of a lacquerer. Hearing it once is enough."

The *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun* and the *Golden Book of Houshu* were Purple Mansion cultivation arts and naturally couldn't be left lying around in the main hall. They had been stored away long ago, and both children had already memorized them. The books they could study here were merely secret manuals on cultivation techniques.

Hearing his words, Li Que'wan looked at him, puzzled. As he flipped through a book to a note he had made previously, Li Jiangqian added casually, "All immortal clans and sects are like palaces. What those people teach is just the golden lacquer on the palace walls, used for decoration. Every family has its own principles, so they use their own lacquer. Some are bright, some are dark, but it's all just lacquer."

He raised an eyebrow, looking at the girl opposite him. He hesitated for a moment, then amended his statement. "Perhaps it is important. I'm just tired of hearing it."

But Li Que'wan didn't let it go so easily. She thought for a moment and shook her head. "Brother Qian, you are very clever, but I don't think it is just lacquer... and those words aren't just for decoration. Since those words have been spoken, the people of our family have something to rely on."

"Perhaps for you, what color the lacquer is doesn't matter. But the common people can only look up and see the color of the lacquer. To them, it is very important."

Her words made Li Jiangqian pause. He looked at her seriously, his brow furrowed. "But public sentiment is something that can be easily manipulated. A single spell or a divine ability is all it takes. What they think isn't important. It has no meaning."

"Look at the Buddhist cultivators in the north. How bitter and difficult are the lives of their people? How lost are they from birth to death? The lives they lead would be considered the worst of the worst in Jiangnan. And yet, they think only of their next life and worship their masters with all their hearts. What bad reputation could there possibly be?"

Li Que'wan was silent for a moment, her eyes quietly glancing at him. "But how they live," she said softly, "is very important."

Li Jiangqian thought for a moment, then realized her point. "You are right... after all, this is the foundation of our family."

The girl pressed her lips together. She knew he was thinking about the Talisman Seeds. She wanted to say more but held her tongue, then smiled to herself.

'It doesn't seem to make a difference. One is judged by their actions, not their thoughts. Brother Qian is brilliant, far beyond me. As long as his heart is in the right place, no one will be able to bully him in the future!'

Li Que'wan giggled. The thought of working together with someone like Li Jiangqian made the road ahead seem much smoother. She went back to her reading. Li Jiangqian, however, secretly glanced at her.

'She is exceptionally talented. I must maintain a good relationship with her. No matter what happens, having a genius on my side is for the best!'

Though they had just debated, they seemed to hold each other in higher and warmer regard. Li Jiangqian mused, 'We are both smart and talented. It is difficult for two intelligent people whose interests are naturally aligned to have any real conflict.'

After they had been reading for a short while, someone entered the outer hall and announced, "The Fourth Lord is here."

This referred to Li Zhouluo, the son of Li Chenghuai, who was technically their fourth uncle. Li Jiangqian put his things away and quickly stood up to go out. As he stepped out of the inner hall, he saw Li Zhouluo pacing anxiously.

"Fourth Uncle!"

Li Jiangqian was much more outgoing. Li Que'wan, still a bit shy, followed quietly behind him.

Li Zhouluo returned the greeting politely, but his expression was troubled. He sighed softly and shook his head. "Something has happened at the lake. My father was busy all last night, and the elders have all gone to Qingdu for a meeting. He sent me here first thing this morning... I am to wait here. The other cousins will be coming. Elder White Ape is going to take us to Qingdu."

"Oh?" Although young, Li Jiangqian was thoughtful. He simply asked, "What happened?"

Having been by his father's side, Li Zhouluo was more familiar with the clan's affairs. "A mortal deer was found on the eastern shore," he sighed. "It cannot speak, but it acts like a human, dragging several people along, kowtowing and weeping all the way to the foot of the mountain. Its hooves were stained with ink, and it could even write."

Hearing this strange news, Li Que'wan's eyes widened.

Li Zhouluo continued in a low voice, "My father studied it all night. None of the Foundation Establishment cultivators in the family could communicate with animals. Fortunately, Elder White Ape is a demon and knew a few methods. After a night of questioning, he learned the truth."

"The deer was once a mortal man who lived on the eastern shore. His father, a gambler, had just passed away. The family was destitute, and his wife was bedridden. He went into the mountains, hoping to hunt a couple of deer to help them get by."

"The hunter went into the mountains and, by a stroke of luck, managed to hunt two deer. He was rushing back, eager to save his wife, when he ran into a monk on the path..."

A look of anger appeared on Li Zhouluo's face. "The monk was furious that he had taken lives. The hunter immediately begged for mercy, but the monk said that he had harmed two lives to save one. And with that, he cast a spell and turned the hunter into a deer, saying he should experience what it feels like to be hunted."

"That's..." Li Que'wan looked confused.

Li Jiangqian's expression, however, turned dark. "Where did this bald donkey come from?" he muttered. "He might as well turn all the killers in the world into beasts. Where is Master Kongheng? Is there any news?"

Li Zhouluo's face was etched with anxiety. "That's the problem," he said, shaking his head. "Master Kongheng has already examined the deer. He said the one who cast the spell is extremely powerful. There isn't a single trace of magical energy on the deer. His cultivation is far superior to Master Kongheng's."

Li Jiangqian frowned.

Li Que'wan waited until they had finished speaking before asking softly, "Since he was turned into a deer, what about his bedridden wife?"

"She..." Li Zhouluo shook his head. "She was already gravely ill and hadn't eaten for a long time. By the time she was found... she was already gone."
