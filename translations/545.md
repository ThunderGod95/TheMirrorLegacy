# Chapter 832: Great Ning Palace

Li Wushao had his spirituality seized at an early age and was subsequently handed over to the Li Family. Later, when Li Yuanjiao died before he could transfer it, a wisp of the connection had been released.

Later, Li Xijun had used the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique again, and the spirituality was first with Li Xijun, then quickly transferred to Li Yuexiang. There was a connection between him and the spirituality; once the master died, the life-bound demonic creature would instantly perish. When he was with Li Yuanjiao, he often used this link to find his way to Li Yuanjiao upon being summoned.

The Xu State was in turmoil, so the connection couldn't be established, but if the spirituality had been extinguished, Li Wushao would have died instantly. Yet he had remained unharmed all along, and saw no sign of the spirituality being released and returning, so he felt secure and never truly considered that Li Yuexiang might be in trouble.

“She must have transferred the spirituality in advance... that’s why I didn’t notice.”

At that moment, a wooden talisman floated by. Caught off guard, Li Wushao froze. The words I’ve long awaited your return caught his eye, making him bare his fangs and let out a furious roar.

The demonic serpent swept his sleeve firmly, lifting a slab of broken stone to reveal scorched ashes that contained several delicate bone fragments. He reached out to brush away the ashes, staining his hand gray and black.

Though the weather was cold, his palm felt scorching hot. After turning the ashes over a few times, he used mana to shake out a few fragments. The fragments had a porcelain-like texture with a faint red hue. Li Wushao exhaled, circulating his mana, and quickly pieced the fragments back into their original form.

It was a red ceramic bead, covered in cracks. He recognized it as a personal belonging of Li Yuexiang, called Glazed Dusk. It had been seized by Li Yuanjiao during an attack on the Li Family by devil cultivators like Qiu Ji. Named by Li Qinghong, it had passed through many hands before ending up with Li Yuexiang. It served as a decent defensive dharma artifact in the Qi Cultivation Realm.

He gathered the fragments using mana. As someone from the Water Mansion lineage of Immortal Foundation, Li Wushao’s power conflicted with the Fire Virtue nature of Glazed Dusk, causing it to appear somewhat dim.

The old serpent tucked the cracked Glazed Dusk into his robes, then took out a jade box to store the charred remains and bones. He hastily stowed the box into his storage pouch. He stood there, staring at his hand for two breaths.

“Stupid thing...” murmured Li Wushao.

Li Wushao’s eyes were gloomy as he stared at the blackened mark on his palm. He began peeling the ashes off bit by bit with mana, then carefully placed it back into the jade box.

Chengshui Tomb.

The deep blue Converging Water gently rippled, reflecting the demonic clouds above. Several figures stood upon the clouds. Some of them were clad in golden robes, while others were in flowing black robes. Regardless, they all had an immortal bearing.

Three Daoist Masters conversed quietly in the front while Li Xuanfeng stood with his bow. The misty blue cloud surrounding Si Boxiu wafted upward along his robes, and Li Xuanfeng felt waves of refreshing energy flow over him, gradually restoring his depleted mana.

Li Xuanfeng had been waiting at Chengshui Tomb for several days while the Daoist Masters meditated with their eyes closed. A few days passed in the blink of an eye to someone at the Foundation Establishment Realm, let alone for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. A single blink might encompass entire cycles of day and night.

When the Daoist Masters began to speak, Li Xuanfeng knew the moment had come. Si Boxiu’s cloud had already fully replenished his mana. A buzzing sound filled the air as a golden cloud flew out from the great void.

A Daoist Master stood on the golden cloud, hands clasped behind his back. His eyes were slightly narrowed, and he had a somewhat somber aura. Several young cultivators stood beside him, radiating glimmers of spiritual light.

“Fellow Daoist Tianyuan.” Daoist Master Chang Yun called out, and Zhang Tianyuan landed before them, nodding toward Daoist Master Qiushui. He was none other than Daoist Master Tianyuan of the Golden Feather Sect.

Si Boxiu spoke softly, “Sorry to trouble you, fellow Daoist.”

Three people descended from his cloud and stood beside Li Xuanfeng. There was one middle-aged man and two youths, all wearing the Azure Pond Sect’s robes. None appeared arrogant, and they nodded slightly toward Li Xuanfeng in greeting.

The Golden Feather Sect’s territory now stretches from Yue State into central Wu State. Their current strength far surpasses the Azure Pond Sect’s... Li Xuanfeng thought to himself.

The Golden Feather Sect was at its peak. Qiushui and Tianyuan often traveled, laying out strategies everywhere. There were two other Daoist Masters within the sect, one with the Dao title Tianhuo, under two hundred years old and often in seclusion, and the other, Tianque, known for his violent temper, stationed in Wu State.

The sect had many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Notably, Zhang Yun, who was famous even during his Foundation Establishment Realm. He was now in seclusion for a breakthrough, reflecting a thriving, prosperous scene.

In contrast, the Azure Pond Sect had suffered nearly a century of turmoil under Chi Wei. The consequences were now clear; there was a dearth of strength. Chi Wei had fallen, Chi Buzi had disappeared, and both Yuanwu and Yuan Su had perished. In just a few decades, they had lost four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators! Once superior to Golden Feather Sect, they had now fallen to the level of a mere average sect.

As Li Xuanfeng’s thoughts ran their course, he saw Daoist Master Chang Yun raise an eyebrow and say, “So it’s the Gao Family of Qi State who arrives first.”

As his voice faded, the great void before them split open, revealing a man whose attire was quite ornate. His upper garment was crisp and snow-white, while his lower robes were a vivid red. He also had a black cloak draped over his broad shoulders. He had a prominent nose and dark red eyes.

Behind him stood another man in dark red and black robes, holding a cavalry lance. He was clearly Gao Fangjing from earlier. The man in front must be Gao Fu, the Bo Lie King who had forged his divine powers with True Flame.

“Greetings to Bo Lie King!”

Yuan Xiu and the others treated him with due courtesy, greeting him one by one. Bo Lie King Gao Fu nodded solemnly in return, performing a meticulously formal northern salute as he said in a deep voice, “I am Gao Fu. Greetings to the esteemed Daoist Masters.”

He had a handsome beard and thick brows, with a broad and powerful chest. His garments were dignified, and surging True Flame was suppressed within his eyes. He did not resemble a northern barbarian king, but rather a noble from the ancient Zhou Dynasty famed for their mastery of Fire Virtue.

Daoist Masters Qiushui and Chang Yun nodded slightly. Bo Lie King stroked his beard and took a close look at Li Xuanfeng, tilting his head slightly as Gao Fangjing mouthed something softly behind him.

Just as Bo Lie King Gao Fu arrived, several figures emerged from the great void. Most of them were shaped like vivid golden statues; some with three heads and six arms, while others had five eyes and seven legs, covered densely with eyes. They radiated warm golden light, but had a solemn and majestic presence.

Li Xuanfeng and Lingu Rao were not ignorant novices. They lowered their heads at once, avoiding the overwhelming golden light.

The buzzing sound of scripture chanting was blocked by Si Boxiu’s cloud, and then came a chuckle, “Has everyone arrived?”

“White Horse Temple has withdrawn... the rest are all here.”

After a short exchange between the voices, Bo Lie King Gao Fu, cultivator of True Flame, stepped forward, stroking his beard, and said, “I’ve long heard that Daoist Master Qiushui cultivates the Whole Pill Dao of Lead and Mercury. The transformations of elemental essence in this Dao are beyond us, might we ask for a demonstration?”

“Very well.” Daoist Master Qiushui nodded gently. She raised a hand, palm up, and released two faint golden gleams. One ascended and transformed into brilliant golden light, while the other descended into vermilion red. She spoke softly, “Azure and emerald blend as one, forming pure and bright Converging Water, capable of revealing the shattered remnants.”

She extended one finger forward and gently rested another finger upon it. The remaining three fingers were slightly curved as she pointed toward the dark blue Converging Water below, respectfully saying, “Behold the radiance of the embraced Supreme Unity.”

Chengshui Tomb had already been submerged by Converging Water. The terrain below them was especially low, with nothing left above the waterline. It looked like a small lake, the dark blue water opaque and jewel-like.

But once the Daoist Master gestured, the black clouds reflected on the water’s surface began to shift. Li Xuanfeng looked closely and saw a broken cliff reflected in the water, with scattered pavilions and towers, and billowing white clouds drifting to and fro.

The reflection grew increasingly vivid. The Converging Water beneath their feet had turned into a mirror, revealing a limited yet clear realm.

Daoist Master Qiushui withdrew her hand and said softly, “Let each of you send someone into the water.”

“What a divine ability...”

Daoist Master Qiushui had performed this with effortless grace, without the slightest strain. Even after letting her hand fall, the reflection remained perfectly stable on the water’s surface.

The Merciful Ones remained silent, while only Bo Lie King Gao Fu praised, “A most ingenious divine ability.”

Si Boxiu watched silently, tilting his head slightly before taking a golden talisman from his robe. It was only two fingers wide and etched densely with radiant markings. He handed it to Li Xuanfeng and said solemnly, “This is the Summon Golden Talisman. It can summon golden energy to aid in battle, but lasts no more than an hour. Its effects may be weaker in this realm, so use it wisely.”

He turned around and pointed out the three behind him, “This is Si Yuanli. These two are Chi Tianxing and Chi Fuju.”

Si Yuanli was the middle-aged man, who was already at the late-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. The other two were youths. Chi Tianxing had a calm demeanor and nodded politely, while Chi Fuju was equally well-mannered and pleasant in appearance.

Yuan Xiu said gravely. “Once he enters the water, I entrust his safety to you two.”

Lingu Rao and Li Xuanfeng immediately responded in unison, “We obey the Daoist Master’s order!”

The group descended from the clouds into the water with a wave of Yuan Xiu’s sleeve. Li Xuanfeng felt a moment of darkness followed by sudden brightness, and then nothing beneath him.

He channeled mana to ride the wind. Mist swirled ceaselessly below his feet. There was no sun or moon above, only an endless white haze. The black clouds, Converging Water, the Merciful Ones, and the Daoist Masters were all gone, leaving only vast skies and a chilling wind rushing toward him.

Looking into the distance, he saw a cliff rising steeply into the sky, adorned with staggered pavilions and towers. Ning State favored deep blues and glazed jewels, so it was no surprise to see these buildings constructed with black and dark blue hues. Colored glass twinkled in the distance, presenting a scene of rich splendor.

Li Xuanfeng paused briefly and looked around, but only found Si Yuanli beside him.

The middle-aged man was riding the wind, surveying the area. His green robe fluttered, and a jade-green longsword had already appeared in his hand. Seeing Li Xuanfeng looking over, he cupped his fists and said, “Apologies for the trouble, fellow Daoist!”

Yuan Xiu clearly has his own agenda!

Li Xuanfeng didn’t need to think long. Lingu Rao was certainly with the two Chi Family members and had separated the moment they entered the realm, leaving him with Si Yuanli. Li Xuanfeng found it hard to believe that this wasn’t orchestrated by Si Boxiu.

He returned the gesture and the two descended into the clouds. After observing for a while, Li Xuanfeng felt that this strange place resembled neither a grotto heaven nor a sealed world.

He asked softly, “Do you know where this is, fellow Daoist?”

“This is the Great Ning Palace.” Since Si Yuanli would need to rely on him later, he spoke with a gentle demeanor and answered thoroughly, “It’s not comparable to the grotto heavens of True Monarchs, though the naming conventions are quite complex. Some called palaces, others halls, caves, or chambers. The Immortal Mansions once had a formal system to classify such cave dwellings.”

He paused for a moment, noting they still had some distance to descend, then continued in a quiet voice, “To be precise, it was the dwelling of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. In ancient times, spiritual energy was abundant and the world was more complete. My family's Daoist Master says it was a time of ‘complete surplus in all things,’ with treasures everywhere. True Monarchs and Daoist Masters of those eras far surpassed those of today, and there were many who had mastered their divine ability. Power resided with multiple Daoist Masters, not just one per faction.

“When they combined their divine abilities, these figures could create dwellings on dharma artifacts or spirit items that were either large or small. Though not as refined as grotto heavens hidden in the great void, they had their own wonders.

“The Great Ning Palace is one such example.”

Li Xuanfeng thoughtfully looked down at the mountains beneath his feet, and asked, “It’s really that vast? That doesn’t seem right...”

The realm before him stretched beyond sight, making Li Xuanfeng suspicious. If every Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had such abilities, Azure Pond Sect and Golden Feather Sect would have countless such domains, yet he had never heard of them. Yuan Su hadn’t even mentioned it. Something felt off, and he stared intently ahead.

Very perceptive... Si Yuanli secretly sighed in his heart.

But he maintained a smile as he replied, “You’re right... After the changes in heaven and earth, constructing a dwelling with divine arts has become immensely difficult for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. In ancient times, three or five of them could build a small immortal palace. Nowadays, it might take more than a dozen. Aside from the likes of the Wang, Xie, and Luoxia families, who across the lands still has that kind of power?

“What’s more, today’s immortal palaces are said to be cramped and unimpressive. Few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are willing to pay the cost.

“As for the Great Ning Palace before us...” Si Yuanli continued softly, “It was constructed in ancient times with the aid of Anhuai Heaven, anchored to a grotto heaven rather than stored within a dharma artifact or spirit item. Then, a True Monarch intervened, which made it possible for such a vast territory to be formed.

“However, now that it’s been opened and connected to the present world, it will begin to collapse within a few months and vanish completely...”

The two finally reached the ground and landed upon pale blue lake water. The blue-black stones beneath were clearly visible. Shallow waters stretched away on both sides, presenting a picturesque scene.

“The Daoist Masters have plotted so carefully because they hope to trace the remains of Anhuai Heaven... While there are many grotto heavens in northern Jiangnan, such as the once-famous Donghua Heaven of the Yuan Prefecture, Anhuai Heaven was among the wealthiest.”

Si Yuanli’s personality, unlike his Daoist Master’s, was gentle and chatty. He smiled and said, “My elder brother is Si Yuanbai. He was once a sword immortal’s disciple and had close ties with your esteemed family...”

“I see!” Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly in acknowledgment. As they flew, they passed a green stone sculpture of a flying fish spouting water every half a kilometer. After dozens of kilometers, they finally saw a long, orderly jade road stretching over the lake. It was black on the outside and white within. The seamless road extended far into the distance.

“What a splendid view.”

Li Xuanfeng’s own home lay by Moongaze Lake, and his family soon to become the sole ruling clan in that region. So when he saw this immortal palace of Ning State, he nodded silently in approval.

Si Yuanli, however, could hardly wait. He picked up speed along the road, his blue robe fluttering as he said with a laugh, “Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng! Ning State is famed for its mastery of True Qi, and the Jiajiang Li Family even supported the nation. There must be many treasures here, we must hurry on!”
