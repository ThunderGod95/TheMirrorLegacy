### Chapter 805: The Register

Li Chenghuai listened quietly, tucked the letter into his sleeve, and replied, “I understand. When will Daoist Friend Yuduan be heading back for a reply?”

Quan Yuduan hesitated. “My junior brother is still in the north, so it should be some time yet. For now, I will remain here cultivating by the shore. The young master may take his time to consider... When you have word, simply summon me from the wilderness.”

Li Chenghuai gave a slight nod. Quan Yuduan retreated. As the hall doors opened, the voice of his eldest son, Li Zhouluo, could be heard cheerfully greeting Quan Yuduan. Then, with a creak, the doors shut firmly, sealing all the noise outside.

Li Chenghuai stood rooted to the spot. He kept his hand over his sleeve, motionless, his gaze frozen. He remained that way until the light in the room shifted. Li Zhouluo, having waited outside for a long time, finally knocked and entered.

“Father...” Li Zhouluo called softly.

Li Chenghuai was still clutching the letter in his sleeve. His lips moved, but he avoided the topic, asking instead, “Are you going to the Southern Sea with Quan Yuduan?”

Li Zhouluo was practically vibrating with impatience, wishing the days would fly by. The last three to five years had been nothing but bitter, grueling work, and he was thoroughly sick of it. At the mention of the trip, his voice filled with delight. “Exactly! I’m just waiting for them to return!”

Hearing that tone, Li Chenghuai understood. 'The child is just waiting to follow Quan Yuduan to the Southern Sea to enjoy himself and meet the fairy maidens of the various sects. He’s brimming with anticipation.'

It was only human nature. Had Li Chenghuai himself been blessed with such an opportunity in his youth, he too would have been restless and desperate with waiting. He poured a cup of tea. “Good. You must prepare well. Do not waste this opportunity.”

Li Zhouluo could see his father was unsettled and looked like he wanted to stop himself from speaking, likely wanting to ask about the letter. Before his son could voice the question, Li Chenghuai waved him away. Zhoulou had no choice but to depart, albeit reluctantly.

Once the hall was empty, Li Chenghuai finally retrieved the letter. He placed it gently on the table, face down.

He certainly knew the weight this letter carried. To put it bluntly, any one of the choices offered within it would make a cultivator from Jiangnan weep with joy. It was clearly something to be celebrated, yet he could not muster half a smile.

He stood alone in the hall for half the night until, at last, he heard movement at the entrance. An old man in blue-gray robes pushed the door open. Li Chenghuai bowed his head slightly.

“Greetings, Elder.”

Only then did he offer the letter. Li Xuanxuan sat down, poured some tea, and began to read it carefully. Li Chenghuai slowly shook his head and spoke.

“What does he owe me... What is there to owe? Those grievances from the days of living under another’s roof, without a father or mother... Can those wounds really be mended with these things?”

Li Xuanxuan remained focused on the letter, his gaze profound. Li Chenghuai’s expression, however, seemed almost detached as he said softly, “I might as well be frank with you. If this letter had arrived twenty years ago, I would have thrown it right back in Quan Yuduan’s face and told him clearly: I don’t want either choice.”

He let out a short laugh, then sighed. “But it came too late. I, Li Chenghuai, am already a father. Within the clan, I am considered an elder. I have far too much to consider now. How could I bear to throw it away? The days of youthful ignorance are long gone. To put it bluntly, my past resentment can now only be called petulance. That is the only reason I accepted this letter.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded heavily. “I understand...”

The old man filled the teacup. “Of the four in the 'Xi' generation... each had their duties back then. Never mind you; Ximing and Chengzhi were in the same position. Chengzhi is always respectful, but I know in his heart, he cannot feel close to Ximing either. This... it is an extremely difficult situation. Don’t say he doesn't understand you. In truth, you also do not understand your father.”

“At that time, there were far too many compromises to be made...”

The old man raised a hand to his cheek, feeling for a small, hard bump beneath the skin. He motioned for Li Chenghuai to look. “See this? Back then, my inner demons flared up. I sought help all the way to the Hengzhu Immortal Dao. They inserted five golden light pills into my flesh. I can still feel them to this day. The injury healed, but the mark left on my face is... unsightly.”

“Your situation is the same mold. Back then, the clan endured humiliation and swallowed its grievances, compromising itself into this state. Now, as you feel the rugged scars of the past, it is only natural to feel that imbalance in your heart. It is reasonable that you want to speak out, to ask questions... Your father is a reasonable man. Write a reply. Speak your mind, make it perfectly clear. You do not need to pretend you can’t feel the scars.”

Li Chenghuai remained silent for a moment. Li Xuanxuan had already pulled him toward the main seat. The old man pressed the brush into his hand while beginning to grind the ink, urging him, “Come. Write.”

***

When Li Zhouluo emerged from the hall, Quan Yuduan, dressed in his red robes, was still admiring the scenery on the island. Although Li Zhouluo was intensely curious about the letter his grandfather had received, he did not ask. He exchanged a few more pleasantries with Quan Yuduan before returning to the main hall.

As he settled into the main seat, Dili Guang approached to light the lamps. Li Zhouluo smiled. “What are your arrangements for the future?”

Li Zhouluo didn't need to elaborate. Dili Guang was exceptionally sharp; a man like him possessed a natural instinct and could sense that Li Zhouluo's time governing the clan was drawing to a close.

He understood precisely what Li Zhouluo was asking. He replied with deep respect, “Whatever the Clan Head arranges... this subordinate will follow. If I am fortunate enough to continue following the Clan Head, it will truly be a blessing I have cultivated...”

Only the direct inner circle knew of Li Zhouluo’s impending trip to the Southern Sea, but Dili Guang seemed utterly convinced that following him would lead to great benefits. His sincerity was palpable, making Li Zhouluo nod in approval.

Li Zhouluo was reading through scrolls when a report came from outside. Cui Jueyin had arrived to make a report.

In all the years Li Zhouluo had managed the clan, Cui Jueyin had always handled the matter of the Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails with methodical precision, reporting exactly once every three months. A sudden visit meant there was definitely a situation with the Purple Mansion array.

He shot to his feet. “Quickly, bring Protector Cui in!”

Dili Guang immediately went down personally to escort him. Once Cui Jueyin was in the hall, Dili Guang dismissed the other attendants, shut the doors himself, and stood guard outside.

Cui Jueyin looked much the same as he had three years prior. This direct descendant of the Cui family offered his customary humble salute and reported:

“Clan Head, the main bodies of the first twelve of the thirty-two profound needles are more than half-forged. However, the Purple Smoke Gate has already begun packing their baggage. The contingent of cultivators currently on the island is about to return to the sect, to be replaced by another batch. According to what Lord Wen Wu said, this is to prevent too much of the array pattern from being exposed.”

'Wen Wu is so slick-tongued he could talk the dead back to life,' Li Zhouluo thought. 'It’s impossible to know if he truly fears exposing the patterns or if this is just a scheduled rotation.'

Cui Jueyin continued, “He was mobilized back overnight and did not have time to pay his respects to the Clan Head, so he entrusted me with his apologies... He also asked me to pass on a message... He said that Li Quexi is already preparing to break through to Qi Refining, and the Purple Smoke Gate has prepared all the necessary pills for her.”

Li Quexi breaking through to Qi Refining was not surprising; Li Zhouluo actually felt it was slightly overdue. Regardless of whether the other party needed it, the clan had to send its portion. He nodded. “I will dispatch someone to the Purple Smoke Gate at once with a share of cultivation resources for her breakthrough.”

“Besides this matter, there is one other urgent affair,” Cui Jueyin said respectfully. “A Purple Smoke Gate cultivator, while traveling the region, mentioned that he had been guiding a child from a small household on the lake. Originally, he said he just found the child endearing... but after three to five years, feelings developed. When it was time to leave, he couldn't bear it. This time, he wishes to take the child back to the sect... and accept him as a disciple. He asked me to inquire with the Clan Head first.”

This was no small matter. Li Zhouluo was startled. “Which family? What is their surname?”

Cui Jueyin gave a bitter smile. “The Ding clan... A minor branch of the Ding clan that scattered to the lakeside... just a widow and an orphan. The mother has some minor cultivation, but in my opinion, this matter is not entirely... respectable.”

'The Ding clan!'

Suspicion immediately rose in Li Zhouluo’s mind. “Although this is somewhat abrupt, how is it not respectable?”

Cui Jueyin sighed softly. “That Ding family member died at the hands of the Floating Cloud Cave. Ding Weizeng even knows his name, so the widow and orphan have not had a difficult life. From what I observed, that Purple Smoke cultivator... harbors certain... intentions... toward the widow. He has stayed overnight. It is said that late one windy night, the sounds alerted the neighbors. Fortunately, no one recognized him. The child does not seem resistant to the idea...”

“This... He is a dignified Foundation Establishment cultivator. He didn’t even bother to set up a simple privacy array? Such indiscretion...”

Li Zhouluo’s expression turned strange. A cultivator from the Purple Smoke Gate could absolutely have concealed the noise. He could only sigh at the man’s peculiar habits. He understood the situation now. After a moment of hesitation, he said awkwardly, “This matter requires notifying Ding Weizeng... In any case, it can be counted as a good thing. What is the status of that Purple Smoke Gate cultivator? Is he known for being a fickle womanizer? My only fear is that he takes them there, and then cruelly abandons them after a few years. That would reflect poorly on us.”

Cui Jueyin replied, “The child is named Ding Mu. The cultivator is the master of Bell-Tether Peak at the Purple Smoke Gate. His name is Cao Chu, and his Daoist title is Huxizi. I have not heard rumors of him being fickle, but he already has one wife and two concubines at his peak. If she goes with him, she will also be taken as a concubine.”

This left Li Zhouluo with no recourse. Slightly embarrassed, he said, “If both parties are willing... we must still wait for an official representative from the Purple Smoke Gate to make the inquiry. After all, from my perspective, she is the one who stands to lose in this arrangement. This must be handled properly...”

“Indeed!”

Ding Mu was not of the Li lineage, nor from any famous family. His relationship to Ding Weizeng was distant, so the matter wasn't overly sensitive. But they were ultimately under the Li family's protection, so this naturally required official communication between the two Purple Mansion powers.

Cui Jueyin confirmed, “Daoist Friend Cao Chu has already reported this to his sect. Someone should be arriving soon to negotiate the matter.”

“Good.” Li Zhouluo let out a slight breath of relief. He watched Cui Jueyin depart, his mind already calculating.

'This Ding Mu will surely be isolated and powerless when he first arrives at the sect. This is the perfect time to provide timely aid. If we handle this well and he matures within the Purple Smoke Gate, we will have secured another stable connection. This is purely beneficial, with no drawbacks.'

With Li Jiangqian having emerged from seclusion, Li Zhouluo felt the pressure ease. There were only two major tasks left to handle: announcing the benefice register and conducting the ancestral sacrifice.

“Go and invite Jiangqian to come here,” he ordered.

A short while later, Li Jiangqian entered the hall. Li Zhouluo smiled and rose to greet him. “The date of the clan sacrifice is approaching. The usual procedures remain unchanged, which means we still need to capture a Demon beast. Will we be using a Foundation Establishment-level beast this year? Such creatures are rather difficult to find these days...”

The choice of sacrificial beast was usually decided by the clan's Foundation Establishment cultivators. With Li Minggong in seclusion, the decision fell to Li Chenghuai and Li Jiangqian. Li Zhouluo was probing for their inclination, suggesting tactfully, “The clan’s resources are currently quite strained, and you have only just broken through... In my opinion... perhaps it is best we keep everything simple this year.”

After all, Li Minggong was in seclusion. The clan's two early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators were unlikely to hunt together. The task would fall to Li Chenghuai, the stronger of the two. But whether fighting or just luring the beast, the current situation was unclear, making it an obvious risk.

In Li Zhouluo’s eyes, the sacrifice was merely a grand ceremony. At such a critical juncture, there was no need for such a high-profile display.

Li Jiangqian understood his concerns. He, however, still harbored thoughts of seeking out Talisman Qi.

'If I go to the Eastern Sea or the Helin Mountains, I wonder if I can even make it back in time...'

He wasn't afraid of failing to capture a beast; setting aside Li Chenghuai, he alone was more than confident of handling any wild Demon. The problem was that the clan's status had changed. In the past, they were a minor Foundation Establishment clan that nobody paid attention to. Now, they were a Purple Mansion power, and their Daoist Master was not on the lake. Many eyes were watching. Making a large commotion would certainly attract suspicion.

If Li Ximing were present, he could simply shuttle through the Great Void, grab a beast, and be back on the mountain for the sacrifice before anyone knew. Even if they found out, they would just assume it was for alchemy. But with Li Ximing absent, the sight of them hauling a massive beast back to the island would appear highly improper.

He frowned and finally replied, “Clan Head speaks reasonably. This matter requires further deliberation. This junior will first ask the Elder for his opinion before we make a final decision.”

Li Zhouluo nodded and pushed the register on his desk forward. The names were already recorded on a gold-bordered scroll. “This is the register for the benefice. Jiangqian, please take a look.”

But Li Jiangqian smiled and made no move to take the scroll. Instead, he bowed. “There is no need. The Clan Head may arrange it and announce it as he sees fit. I am just going to take a walk around the island.”

***

Elsewhere on the island.

The morning dawn was just breaking over the lake. A certain residence was already bustling with activity. The two imposing green-tiger stone statues flanking the entrance were draped in bright red silk, and servants, also dressed in red, smiled and offered congratulations to all arrivals.

The plaque above the main gate flowed with light, the two gilded characters for "Dongxu" positively glowing. The round, pale Li Xixuan stood before the gate, dressed in festive red robes, accepting the greetings of those who called him "Master."

The "Dongxu" Residence was the ancestral home of the Yuanwan Branch. It had once been quite spacious, but as the descendants multiplied, the courtyard had been divided into four wings, and each wing divided into four more rooms. While it looked magnificent from the outside, the interior was shockingly cramped. Every time Li Xixuan stood at this gate, he used to sigh. Today, he was not sighing. His face was beaming.

Waiting just inside was Li Minggong's younger brother, his face flush with success, wearing a colorful patterned headscarf. Guests treated him with marked respect. As one group entered, a man in short-cut robes hurried up to him, rubbing his hands gleefully.

“Brother Chang, several of your sons and nephews received the benefice this time! You’ll be needing good residences now, won't you? I happen to have some excellent locations available...”

The middle-aged man in the colorful headscarf was basking in his triumph. His good mood made him generous even to this opportunistic housing broker. He just laughed. “Wait a few days! There will be plenty of profit for you to make!”

He roared with laughter and pulled the man inside. Past the gate, the courtyard had been modified and was now extremely small, packed tight with well-wishers. He stuck his chest out, walking with an imposing air that stood in stark contrast to his father, Li Xixuan, who walked ahead of him, hunched over and casting suspicious glances at everything.

The son announced loudly, “In this round of the clan benefice, our Yuanwan Dongxu Residence has five members selected, totaling four branches! Everyone...”

He raised his cup, beaming. “The Main Branch cherishes its clan members, and all our families live in harmony! This is a toast to the Lake! A toast to the Island! And a toast to the Clan!”
