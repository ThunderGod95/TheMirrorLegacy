# Chapter 755: Shaohui

Dangjiang agreed readily. He felt his sleeves—they were completely empty. Broke as he was, his heart began to pound, but he wouldn't lose face.

"However, the rules in the heavens are extremely strict," he said with a practiced smile. "I cannot simply bring personal items with me to this palace. Fortunately, nothing here is mundane. Wait just a moment."

He walked quickly to the courtyard gate and pushed it open. Two attendants were standing just outside. They were beautiful, both clad in rainbow-like celestial garments. Though their clothes drifted like clouds, they bore no embroidery. One held a white-rimmed, green jade pipa, while the other carried a flower basket piled high with glittering qiong grass.

Dangjiang glanced at the basket. "What spirit grass is this?"

The attendant replied, "Reporting to my lord: Today the Dipper points to the Station of Virtuous Report, Yin crosses the Earthly plane, and the Time Ruler commands: Supreme Yang gathers the Radiant and Plunders Profound Flowers; Supreme Yin clips the Golden Branches of the Moon Laurel. The pivots move as normal, and the Twelve Qi are drawn from the celestial phenomena."

"Moon Laurel Golden Branches."

Dangjiang nodded and said, "May I have a branch?"

The attendant immediately retrieved a white laurel branch. Tiny white blossoms dotted the twig, and the cut end was golden-yellow, revealing spiraling, concentric rings that radiated a subtle chill.

Dangjiang hadn't actually been sure it would work. Seeing her comply so easily, he relaxed inwardly. He took the branch and turned back, only to see Chi Buzi thoughtfully savoring the words he had overheard:

"Supreme Yang gathers the Radiant and Plunders Profound Flowers, Supreme Yin clips the Golden Branches of the Moon Laurel..."

Dangjiang lifted his chin, his voice swelling with pride. "Daoist Master Chi, guard this well! A single Moon Laurel branch from the heavens is an extraordinary treasure down in the mortal world!"

Chi Buzi offered a sincere word of thanks. He took the spirit item, tucked it into his sleeve, and nodded slightly. "Then I shall depart. From now on, I will draw the array annually to contact you. If you find out anything about my path to Golden Core, please send word."

Dangjiang seemed reluctant to see him go. "How about once every three months? I could use the extra trips... at least it's something to do... And you can report to me about happenings in the lower realm."

Chi Buzi still wasn't used to the term "lower realm." He frowned. "Just focus on your work and don't get reprimanded. If that happens, I'll have nowhere to report my contributions..."

Dangjiang could only nod. He suddenly remembered something and said urgently, "I just recalled! There is an immortal official in the heavens, surname Li, who went to the lower realm to reincarnate for his cultivation. If you chance upon him, and if he still remembers his life in the heavens, please ask him something for me. Ask him when he is returning... I cannot take this job for one more day!"

Chi Buzi frowned, committing this to memory. "What exactly is this job of yours?"

"Organizing techniques and correcting Dao lineages," Dangjiang replied, his face a mask of misery.

Chi Buzi’s expression instantly turned bizarre. He stared at Dangjiang, his voice laced with the sound of grinding teeth.

Back in the day, Chi Buzi would have practically lived in the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, refusing to waste a single step outside its doors. Now, this was the library of an Immortal Lord's Grotto-Heaven, a place countless Purple Mansion cultivators would shatter their skulls trying to enter! Looking at Dangjiang’s miserable face, he could only curse:

"You worthless fool! Blessed with fortune and you don't even know it..."

He flicked his sleeve angrily, stepped into the pool, and his form dissolved like water.

Dangjiang trudged out of the courtyard, his face still long. The moment he pushed the gate open, the attendant stepped forward and bowed respectfully.

"Reporting to the Immortal Official: That Golden branch of the Moon Laurel has already been recorded under the Immortal Official's name. If the remainder is not required, this basket must be presented to the bureau for logging."

"Ah?"

Dangjiang froze. The words struck him like thunder, and his heart sank. Regret washed over him.

'Damn it... This stuff isn't free?!'

He had put on such a brave face for his guest, but now he regretted it to his very core. Dangjiang had only just attained the rank of immortal official. He had used what little merit he had earned to exchange for his attendants; he had no savings left. A chill shot through him.

"This item... how is it calculated... Why was it delivered here...?"

The attendant replied, "The products of the various domains and palaces are always delivered to the different halls. This was established by Immortal Official Liu some time ago. They are kept in regular supply in the courtyards for convenient access."

"Aiya... That dog Chi Buzi has ruined me!"

Dangjiang's face went pale with anguish. He immediately asked, "This item... can it be charged to that Chi Buzi's name? He was the one who took it... it has nothing to do with me!"

The attendant just lowered her gaze. "It was the lord who gave it away. Heaven and Earth witnessed it."

...

The Sea's Cape.

The depths of the ocean were utterly dark. Cold, icy currents flowed beneath the reefs. Spiritual energy here was almost nonexistent; a Purple Mansion cultivator would find no path forward here and would have to revert to flying through the physical world.

Deep within the Cape, the terrain rose, and the seawater cascaded into an endless abyss below, rising back up as mist. This place was extremely close to the beyond, yet cut off from the Great Void. There was no more hidden place between heaven and earth.

Inside a dark karst cave, bright white array patterns glowed faintly. Chi Buzi's vision slowly faded from the brilliance of the heaven back to the gloom. He scanned his surroundings, confirming he was indeed back in the secret cave he had formed using the *Heavy Murk* earth-escape art.

He let out a breath and felt his sleeve. He reached in, turned his palm upward, and a snow-white laurel branch lay in his hand. It emitted a hazy white halo, and the cut section of the stem glowed with golden patterns. It was clearly a treasure of the highest quality.

The young man's gaze lingered on the laurel branch for a long time. The cave began to fill with the chill of the Supreme Yin. He retrieved a jade box from his storage bag and placed the branch inside.

"It truly is a supreme treasure of the Supreme Yin lineage... Items from that place can be brought out... But... I wonder why I couldn't open my storage bag."

Chi Buzi held the jade box, looking down quietly, his mind racing. After a moment, his thoughts settled.

"This spirit item alone, in the current world, is worth no less than that demon beast. If that's the case... the *Ritual of the Celestial Seal and Profound Clarity* is indeed a way to contact a Grotto-Heaven... But the offering... must it be a demon beast?"

Chi Buzi’s expression grew contemplative, and understanding dawned.

"Counting every Purple Mansion demon beast in the Eastern Sea, there are few that aren't related to dragon-kind. I certainly can't kill them... But demons... spirit beasts also count as demons... Those Maha of the several northern Ways love to collect spirit beasts. Not only do they have demons who become Merciful Ones, but those long-cultivated Merciful Ones love to merge their lifeforce with their attendant spirit beasts, making the beast equivalent to a Purple Mansion life-pact... Aren't there far more of those than demon beasts?"

The more he thought, the brighter his eyes became.

'Yes, yes, good. Although a Merciful One is hard to kill, there are far more of them, and they are easier to deal with than a true Purple Mansion demon. Their backing is only a Maha. I wonder if they'll count as a full contribution? If not, even half a contribution would be good...'

He couldn't think of a more suitable offering than a Merciful One. A realization struck him:

'It seems this personage also looks down on the Northern Buddhists...'

He paused, sat cross-legged in the cave, and began to admire the Moon Laurel Golden Branch in the jade box. The grade of this spirit item was even higher than Supreme Yin Moonlight Essence; it was utterly rare in the world. Merely placing it before him caused Supreme Yin Qi to emanate.

The young man stared quietly at the clusters of white flowers on the branch, the ambition in his eyes startling. He propped his chin on his other hand, his voice growing softer, his cadence like the chanting of scripture:

"All Fruition Attainments of Yin revere the Supreme Yin, while the Supreme Yang is the first manifestation of the day, which all Yangs follow... The Supreme Yin's Profound Splendor falls upon the waters of Bing-Zi... guiding both the Pristine and the Converging..."

...

The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity.

White snow piled beneath the bright moon lamp pedestals. Lu Jiangxian sat at the table as the various illusions before him slowly faded.

"Chi Buzi... he really is something."

Currently, Lu Jiangxian naturally lacked the ability to pull people into the Immortal Mirror's world and have them take things back out. When Chi Buzi used the array to connect to the Immortal Mirror, his situation was effectively no different from that of Maha Jinlian or Five-Eyes; he was trapped in an illusion.

But the difference was that Chi Buzi had arrived as an intentional visitor, not someone kneeling in terror. He was able to move freely! He could even pick things up and put them down. If Chi Buzi had tried to take something from his storage bag, Lu Jiangxian wasn't incapable of making it manifest... but what then?

'Chi Buzi is cunning. I can't control his storage bag. Even if I manifested the item, the moment he gave it to Dangjiang or set it down, he would just feel his storage bag upon returning, find the item still there, and instantly know the trick.'

The Immortal Mirror did not yet have the ability to move physical objects in and out. This was a fatal flaw. Therefore, Lu Jiangxian had locked his storage bag from the start. But merely by Dangjiang mentioning it, Chi Buzi had still grown suspicious, wondering if the place was an illusion since he couldn't retrieve things. This is why he insisted on taking a souvenir. The moment he left, a simple touch of his sleeve would tell him if it was real or fake.

Lu Jiangxian could certainly have arranged for Dangjiang to stonewall him with various regulations, preventing him from taking anything. But Chi Buzi was not easily fooled. The entire point of letting him "arrive in true body" this time was to dispel the lingering doubts from the previous, dream-like illusion. Using the same trick twice on a Purple Mansion cultivator of his caliber would guarantee deep suspicion.

Thus, he specifically allowed Chi Buzi to 'take' a Supreme Yin spirit item back with him. This item was the only thing Lu Jiangxian could currently condense in the physical world. It was just enough to plug the hole in the illusion.

"But this method only works this one time. I managed to acquire the offering for free, using this extremely precious Supreme Yin spirit item to placate him. But... after this, he can forget about getting any response for future Purple Mansion demon offerings!"

He had only managed to pull this off thanks to having Dangjiang on hand. Dangjiang could drop the formalities with Chi Buzi, analyze the pros and cons, and talk frankly. If Lu Jiangxian had conjured a fake persona to handle it, Chi Buzi never would have spoken so deeply... and he never would have achieved the current effect.

"This, however, presents a new problem. Chi Buzi is sharp. Although he won't ask for cultivation arts again, his focus has shifted to the Golden Core path. If I can't provide sufficient guidance, it will inevitably stir up trouble."

Chi Buzi was a double-edged sword. He was incredibly useful, understood how to read situations, acted with caution, and possessed supreme strength—in Jiangnan, he was second only to Qiushui and Yuanxiu. His death would also be a major problem. For now, Lu Jiangxian still needed him.

That was a problem for later. Lu Jiangxian looked up. A large, blue-and-white-feathered bird was lying on the jade bricks by his feet. It was the size of a writing desk, its pale, gauze-like tail feathers spread in a circle on the ground.

This Lesser Yin demon beast was different from all the demons sacrificed previously. The Li family sacrifice used incense fire as a base, slaying the demon with the ritual blade and sending its soul, blood essence, and immortal foundation flying into the Mirror as a single, mixed lump.

This demon, however, had been sacrificed individually. It had bypassed the incense-fire refining part of the sacrificial rite. Its immortal foundation, blood essence, divine-ability body, and even the Shengyang Mansion within the Great Void had all been sacrificed whole and unharmed.

Even better, the soul of a Purple Mansion cultivator resides in their Shengyang Mansion; upon death, it leaves the body but is not extinguished. Thus, the spirit sparrow's soul was able to fly into the Mirror. It was right here, still possessing consciousness. In a sense, this demon was the first *living being* to ever enter the Mirror!

Lu Jiangxian’s gaze was fervent. This was new labor, on par with Dangjiang!

He lifted the soul and scanned it, quickly understanding its history.

'This demon was born in the Northern Sea. Its bloodline was average, but it struck fortune, ate a treasure medicine, and entered the path of cultivation. For the first two hundred years, it ate everything, raising several tribes for food. Gradually, it attained enlightenment in the northern deserts.'

'After gaining intelligence, it read a few books and realized humanity was dominant. It promptly transformed, becoming a protector spirit beast for a tribe, taking the tribe's name as its own, calling itself Fuyu.'

"By the time this demon emerged from seclusion after breaking through to Foundation Establishment, the Fuyu kingdom had long since been conquered. It emerged into territory belonging to the Lou family. It could only wander, yet it managed to acquire quite a few opportunities."

"Its talent for techniques is extremely high. It researched many techniques on its own, and by currying favor with the Luan-birds, it managed to visit Mount Taishi and successfully attained Purple Mansion..."

Lu Jiangxian looked closely. In its several fights with Chi Buzi, most of the techniques the demon used were its own creations. Unfortunately, a demon's Immortal foundation is rarely comparable to a human's. Although its talent for techniques was high, it hadn't read as many Daoist lineages as Chi Buzi, and it had only just broken through to Purple Mansion. Thus, it was no match.

He searched through its memories, finding them sparse. Looking closer, he confirmed someone *had* tampered with its mind. All memories concerning the Luan-birds were gone, and it had even actively forgotten events involving Golden Core matters from centuries ago. Stripped of this complex history, all that remained were a few cultivation arts it had acquired by chance.

It really did look like it had no background, which explained why it fell into Chi Buzi's hands. Lu Jiangxian reviewed it one more time, frowning as understanding settled in.

"This is good... very good... but if I use this soul here, the Azure Talisman side will be short one Purple Mansion soul. The incense fire is currently sufficient, but using this will leave the Azure Talisman lacking."

He thought for a moment and relaxed.

"However, there are still five years until the next sacrifice, and Li Zhouwei is also in seclusion. There is plenty of time. I will wait and see... After all, this creature's talent for techniques is extremely high. Adding such a person to my Mirror is an enormous boon."

He lifted his sleeve, and a bright Supreme Yin radiance appeared in his hand. He picked up the jade pot from the table and flicked a finger.

The spirit sparrow on the ground instantly dissolved into a sky of Lesser Yin splendor, which drilled into the pot. In an instant, the pot was filled to the brim with a blue-white, starry, ocean-like divine ability. Opening the lid revealed a small mansion floating within that ocean—the spirit sparrow’s Shengyang Mansion.

A faint, illusory shadow remained on the ground: the demon's soul. Lu Jiangxian flicked his sleeve again, and the soul immediately attached itself to a descending beam of celestial light, glowing brilliantly.

The Mirror was the seat of Lu Jiangxian's own divine abilities. He infused the soul with a wisp of Lesser Yin, condensing it into the form of a woman in tea-white celestial robes. She was petite, yet possessed a clear, otherworldly aura. She held a pipa, and a stark white circular sigil adorned her brow. Her bearing was extraordinary.

The woman blinked, seemingly confused as to why she was here. As her soul’s memories merged, she looked up in a daze. When she saw the person seated above her, the confusion and blankness in her eyes were instantly replaced by terror and awe. She knelt and bowed, her voice soft:

"Lesser Yin Wu-Gui Celestial Attendant, Shaohui, pays respects to the Palace Lord!"
