# Chapter 770: Ambition and Capacity

A brilliant white point of light flashed, rapidly expanding and transforming. A waterfall of lightning poured down, blocking the gray rope. Only then did the violent crack of thunder sound: "BOOM!".

The Secret Art of the Purple Talisman’s Primal Light was, after all, from the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring lineage. Intense lightning and a violent impact spread out simultaneously. It was far more powerful than his previous artifacts, clearly causing the gray rope to slow significantly, even knocking it backward.

But the thunder-waterfall's dominance didn't last long. The mountain patterns on the gray rope lit up one by one. The center of the lightning burst seemed to spring a leak and instantly deflated. All the purple lightning-plasma was sucked into the gray rope as if by a great whale drinking, vanishing completely in an instant.

'It's a Spirit Artifact of the Earth Virtue or Metal Virtue! Earth smothers rampant thunder, and Metal dissipates residual lightning—it perfectly counters my thunder techniques!'.

Li Chenghui saw it immediately. For years, his lightning, with its tyrannical speed, had been what he used to slay demons and restrain enemies. Now, he was finally the one being suppressed. He spun around, treading on lightning to retreat.

Ding Weizeng had already rushed to support him, striking the gray rope twice with his staff. The rope, however, acted unhurriedly and vanished into the Great Void. Situ Biao and the others pressed forward, intercepting Ding Weizeng. Situ Mo himself, his face cold, rode the wind to chase Li Chenghui.

One golden and one purple streak of escaping light shot toward the sky. Without a thought, Li Chenghui fled east. Above his head, a dark cyan radiance rose as the screen panels unfurled. The brilliance of the "Heavy Abyss Gale" surged out, rushing toward Situ Mo. But Situ Mo's escaping light was generated purely by his own cultivation, not an artifact, making it hard to shoot down. Furthermore, he had long understood the function of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen in the sky. He had already recalled his golden needles and golden saber into his sleeves. Facing the assaulting cyan light, he only paused for a moment.

Fortunately, Li Chenghui's escaping light was a notch faster, keeping him temporarily ahead. The Chongming Profound Insight Screen's light cycled back, but a patch of gold suddenly appeared before him, captured in his vision. It was an enemy technique that had secretly circled around. Li Chenghui gathered lightning in his palms and pushed forward, dispersing the technique.

As he raced onward, riding the thunder, a thought flashed through his mind like lightning: 'Situ Mo has a Spirit Artifact! A Purple Mansion cultivator must be involved!'.

Li Chenghui felt little panic; instead, his heart was heavy with grim realization. 'Who is behind this? Situ Huo? The Golden Feather Sect? The Capital immortals Dao? Changxiao? ...Perhaps it's not just one person, but the collective will of several Purple Mansion cultivators...'.

'This is for our clan's Heir... I'm just a thunder cultivator whose Dao path is already severed. Why would they need such a grand formation to deal with me?'.

'They are trying to force Minghuang to appear! This isn't just about Changxiao. I already knew that among the Purple Mansion cultivators, probably none of them wished to see Minghuang break through to their realm, but I never expected their actions to be this ruthless!'.

Li Chenghui had always been deeply baffled by Changxiao's sudden, lethally offensive move. Now, having reached this point, he finally understood.

'I suspected long ago that Changxiao, having acted against the "Son of Heaven's Mandate" repeatedly, held ill intentions toward Minghuang, but I never thought he would act so decisively and so quickly. It seems I underestimated the malice the other houses hold for my family. Changxiao is simply acting on the collective will! Regardless of whether other cultivators want Minghuang to fall into Changxiao's hands, in the matter of forcing our clan Heir to appear... there are far, far too many aligned interests.'.

'As for what happens after he appears, some will want to capture him, others will want him dead... Changxiao saw this clearly. As long as he forced Li Ximing out to sea and kept him occupied, even if Yehui was unwilling to act, too many other Purple Mansion cultivators would fan the flames. Never mind the Golden Feather Sect or the Crimson Reef—even the Si Clan of the Azure Pond Sect, who supposedly backs the Li family, don't they also harbor thoughts of pushing our family to the brink?! If they want the Li clan to submit fully to the Azure Pond Sect, this is the perfect time!'.

Although Li Chenghui didn't know about the events at Mount Luoxia, he interpreted this persecution as fear of his clan's leader, and the conclusion he reached was no different. He had slowly managed to sort through the complexities.

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Situ Mo, his expression savage, closed his fist on empty air behind him. He caught the gray rope in mid-flight, its bright mountain patterns flashing. His voice boomed like thunder as he roared, "Li Chenghui! Die!".

This shout snapped him back to reality. What was Situ Mo's situation in all this?.

The man, Situ Mo, was clearly recorded in the clan annals as a cunning and venomous individual. His own elder sister had dealt with him and confirmed he was a ruthless tyrant. Such a person, if he were to use a technique or sacrifice an artifact, would naturally do so silently, his expression calm, to prevent his enemy from preparing. Why would he be like this, with a savage expression and a voice like thunder, as if terrified Li Chenghui wouldn't notice him?.

In that instant, clarity dawned on Li Chenghui. He understood. 'Even though he's menacingly trying to kill me, it is only by me continuing to flee, making this commotion bigger and bigger, that I serve his interests! He needs to force Minghuang... he needs chaos! He needs everyone's eyes to fall upon my clan's Heir, satisfying the Purple Mansion cultivators! Only then does *he* have a sliver of a chance to live!'.

At this moment, Li Chenghui was like a black moth caught in a spider's web, beating its wings, struggling to survive. But wasn't the golden-skinned poisonous spider opposite him also trembling, caught in the very same web, just trying to stay alive?.

*BOOM!*

A torrent of purple lightning surged out, blasting backward into a wave of thunder. The golden needles retreated, but from their midst, the venomous snake-like gray rope shot out again.

Although Situ Mo appeared desperate and furious, and his vicious words served as a veiled hint, he understood even more clearly what must be done and what must not. His hands did not relax in the slightest. The Spirit Artifact that suppressed lightning continued to bind him.

Li Chenghui had already seized the opportunity to swallow a medicinal pill. A red glow immediately lit up his body as both his cultivation base and lifespan burned away to fuel his desperate flight eastward.

On the other side of the Funan region was the battle between Li Minggong and the Capital immortals Dao. Although that situation was also grim, it now seemed to be his only chance.

'How ridiculous... The Capital immortals Dao is my family's greatest public enemy since our Purple Mansion breakthrough, while all the other houses are polite and smiling. I never thought... that I would now have to rely on the "goodwill" of the Capital immortals Dao!'.

The world's affairs were truly profound; everything had been reversed overnight. Li Chenghui tore through the air, just beginning to ride the thunder, when he heard a maddened roar from Situ Mo behind him: "Run! Do you think you can escape!?".

This roar, powered by spiritual energy, echoed across the sky and pierced Li Chenghui's ears. The young man's expression faltered for a fraction of a second. Thoughts raced through his mind: *Can I escape?*.

Was merely having Situ Mo chase him enough to force Li Zhouwei to appear? This tiny Funan region was only the size of Moongaze Lake's northern shore—wasn't the distance too short? Thunder was fast; if there was any slip-up, or if the Capital immortals Dao decided to help, wouldn't the opportunity be wasted?.

'It isn't a chase... it's my life... Situ Mo's meaning is probably that he doesn't just have one Spirit Artifact... he has more... If he's pushed too hard, he *will* strike to kill first.'.

As Li Chenghui's thunder dissipated, the gray rope fell, blocking the path ahead. He forced himself to take a step, feeling his entire body grow heavy. He changed direction, heading toward the river. Across the river was Moongaze Lake—the place where Li Zhouwei was in seclusion!.

The moment Li Chenghui turned, Situ Mo knew his opponent understood, at least partially. He was overcome with relief, yet still broke out in a cold sweat. 'Thank goodness the Li family cultivators are smart!'.

He never in his life thought such a sentiment would cross his mind, yet there it was.

'Go south! Force Li Zhouwei out onto the lake! That is the only way we both live! Otherwise, you die... and I will be boiled alive!'.

Situ Mo's face remained savage and agitated, the anxiety in his eyes undiminished. But the hand seal he was forming paused for an instant—he had clearly breathed a sigh of relief. Even the gray rope slowed down. Li Chenghui rode the thunder forward several steps, with Situ Mo using the Spirit Artifact to "forcefully" push him across the river.

*BOOM!*

The wide river had just appeared before them when the Golden Tang Gate Master slowly raised his eyebrows. The gray rope erupted in brilliant light. Runes flowed out from the mountain patterns, coalescing in the air into falling streams of pale golden light, revealing the artifact's profound function.

It wasn't unheard of for a Foundation Establishment cultivator to use a Spirit Artifact to fight an enemy; Ning Heyuan back in the day was one such example, and he held an ancient Spirit Artifact at that. But whether in terms of cultivation, combat skill, or even the compatibility of the artifact with his Dao lineage, Ning Heyuan absolutely could not compare to Situ Mo.

Now, as this profound ability emerged, Li Chenghui clearly felt the space around him grow obscure, as if he were trapped in a mountain ravine. The gray rope continued to expand and spread, casting down pale golden light from the sky, using the Great Void to lock onto him.

Situ Mo was no easy opponent; Li Chenghui had no choice but to move forward. The Golden Tang Gate Master, growing more confident, was already plotting his next move: 'I absolutely cannot be left holding the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope. As soon as we are over the lake, Li Zhouwei cannot sit by and ignore this. Even if he is truly in deep seclusion, Li Xuanxuan will be forced to wake him.'.

'The moment he appears, I will smash the Rope onto Li Zhouwei, hit Li Chenghui with the Purple Mansion talisman, abandon the Spirit Artifact, and flee!'.

Situ Mo was confident that as long as the Rope was not in his hands, ninety percent of the Purple Mansion gazes on him would vanish.

'As long as I don't flee with the Spirit Artifact, and I don't hide in my own sect's formation in the Tangdao Mountains, but instead make a break for the Eastern Sea, I can definitely survive!'.

'Because—I can still be used as bait to lure out Li Ximing!'.

'As long as I am useful, I will live!'.

Situ Mo was truly worthy of the man who had climbed from the son of a concubine to the position of Gate Master. Even in this certain-death scenario, he had managed to find a path to survival.

He wasn't worried about what Li Chenghui might do; he just stared darkly at his back. 'Li Zhouwei has to show himself sooner or later anyway. His appearing doesn't necessarily mean anything fatal will happen to him, but it *will* save your life. No one in this world doesn't cherish their own life, especially when it's not even asking for Li Zhouwei's life in exchange!'.

Situ Mo's eyes remained fixed on Li Chenghui. He clearly had the Spirit Artifact for suppression and the talisman as insurance, and Li Chenghui knew that stopping meant certain death. But Situ Mo's suspicion surged again. 'But the Li family binds its disciples with clan bloodlines and ancient morals. Li Zhouwei is the clan head. How do I know Li Chenghui isn't some stubborn fanatic willing to throw his life away?'.

And so, the next moment, he silently hid a cluster of golden needles in his sleeve and poured his spiritual qi into them. A chilling voice suddenly emerged: "Li Chenghui! If you dare to die, I will turn around and kill Li Minggong!".

Li Chenghui's figure, flashing like lightning over the river, flickered and stopped dead. Situ Mo's cold voice arrived an instant later: "Don't think I won't do it. The Daoist Masters watching will only think I'm being sensible!".

Li Chenghui's eyes widened slightly, his ink-black gaze staring straight at his opponent. He held one hand, fingers pointed like a sword, two inches from his chest. His other hand was extended behind his back, fingers also pointed. Both hands pinched a glittering golden talisman.

The talisman in front of Li Chenghui suddenly flared, releasing a burst of deep cyan light, heavy as bedrock and solemn as an ancestral temple. It was the Rite of the Azure Manifestation Earth Virtue!.

The talisman behind his back, however, lit up with a dense black light, hidden as a forest shadow and eerie as a shaman's temple. This was the 'Concealment' ability of the Ancient Merging Shamanic Talisman Dao! Shamanic Talisman Gold Charms!.

This stack of Shamanic Talisman Gold Charms, brought back from the Great Ning Palace by Li Xuanfeng, was one of the Li family's great treasures. Several of the direct descendants carried them. Li Xijun had once used the 'Transformation' talisman to disguise himself as Guo Hongyao. Now, the two remaining types were finally being put to use.

Once the Azure Manifestation Earth Virtue 'Rite' was activated, it immediately flowed over him like a heavy golden liquid, causing little visible change. But when the Ancient Merging Shamanic Talisman 'Concealment' activated, a black light surged from Li Chenghui's body, causing the gray rope in the sky to freeze.

A Spirit Artifact locking onto a Foundation Establishment cultivator via the Great Void was an inescapable death sentence. But at this moment, Li Chenghui seemed to be hidden from the world, breaking free from that golden lock and soaring away on the thunder. 'Good! It worked!'.

Li Chenghui clearly remembered the talisman's function. When Li Xizhi brought it back, he had explained that 'Concealment' seemed to be a condensed form of the 'Untraceable Presence' Purple Mansion divine ability. Its greater function was escaping Purple Mansion-level scrying and calculations. 'They can't calculate my position anymore!'.

Li Chenghui understood perfectly. The current situation only existed because all the major powers were pushing and nudging each other, fanning the flames. This meant that no single Purple Mansion cultivator would personally use their divine abilities to lock onto Situ Mo or himself!.

'Our clan's Purple Mansion cultivator is out there, watching. No one wants their own Dao lineage to know no peace for the next four hundred years! If they cannot calculate my next move, I have room to act!'.

His figure had only just broken free from the golden lock when Situ Mo reacted in shock. But Situ Mo's eyes had already turned golden. He took a single step, and the cluster of golden needles flew from his sleeve, exploding into countless golden filaments that shot out in all directions like rays of light.

His reaction was astonishingly fast. He had already hidden the artifact in his sleeve, and the very instant Li Chenghui drew the talismans, Situ Mo began activating his own technique. He was so fast they had almost acted in perfect sync.

Li Chenghui's action was unexpected. Any other Foundation Establishment cultivator might have been lost for that crucial instant, creating an opportunity to escape. But the blade the Purple Mansion cultivators had chosen—Situ Mo—had been hammered, forged in fire, and forced to swallow his own hatred. He was too sharp, and too fast.

*TINK!*

The tens of thousands of light filaments released by the golden needles instantly extended for several miles. Far to the east, a faint, crisp sound of impact was heard.

The sound itself didn't travel back, but Situ Mo sensed it through the connection to his artifact. Before his body could even move, his head snapped around. His venomous eyes, completely bloodshot, focused their golden light, stabbing toward Li Chenghui like two arrows loosed from a bow.

A chill ran down Li Chenghui’s spine.

He suddenly recalled his time as a Qi Refining cultivator guarding that small island in the Eastern Sea. The sea was rough then, the setting sun a waxy yellow, and he would read the clan annals. He could recite every passage clearly:

"Later, Geng of the Jin approached the Eastern Sea, but Mo defended the island and would not come out. When Situ Chen arrived, Chen was tricked and killed by him, and thus did not return. When the news reached home, Cheng looked to him and said: When my uncle was still alive, he often worried about this man. He could not be removed, and he once warned me of him with a single sentence, which I have kept in my heart.".

"Liao said: I wish to hear the details.".

"He replied: Observe his ambition and capacity; he will surely become a future disaster!".
