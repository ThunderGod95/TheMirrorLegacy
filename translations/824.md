# Chapter 824: Harmonising Metal

The secret method Imperial Command served to increase one's personal might and compel others. While its utility was limited, commanding mortals or low-level cultivators posed no issue. As for the remaining two secret methods, he had made progress, but they were far from mastered and offered no tangible benefits.

Then again, secret methods were never intended to be Dao arts that enhanced one's combat prowess. He estimated that even mastering all nine would offer less aid in a real Dao battle than his Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts.

Li Zhouwei mused on this, suppressed the nagging doubts in his mind, and resolved to ask Li Qinghong about it later. For now, he immersed himself back into secluded cultivation.

Cultivating the Primal Yang was not difficult, and time slipped by in an instant. A faint vibration echoed from outside the immortal's abode, and he slowly opened his eyes. Yuanzi's respectful voice carried in:

"My Lord, the Lustrous-Head Clan has reported personally. The spiritual artifact is successfully refined, and they humbly request you come to inspect it."

The doors to the manor-cave boomed open. Li Zhouwei dissolved into a streak of light, reappearing at her side. Yuanzi bowed and began to lead the way. The old Daoist followed just as respectfully as before, though this time he was accompanied by a young man in a silver crown and feathered robes. He appeared to be a cultivator from the Xi Family of the Northern Sea, and he dared not speak, keeping his gaze lowered as he trailed behind.

Li Zhouwei deliberately slowed his pace, yet the young man remained silent. It wasn't until Li Zhouwei had stepped onto the ritual platform that the youth seized his opportunity:

"Xi Nanqing of the Firmament Cloud Abbey, greets you, my Lord."

Li Zhouwei acknowledged him with a simple sound. In the brief moment he turned to enter the carriage, he shot the youth a glance, lifting the curtain just slightly.

"The Xi Family of the Northern Sea. Your clan has cultivated lightning for generations, and you walk the Righteous Path. We should indeed interact more often."

Xi Nanqing offered a brief reply and fell silent, having nothing more to add. The carriage swayed as it rode the thunder upward, ascending through heavy layers of mist. Li Zhouwei glanced down. The Daoists on the mountain were dispersing in an orderly fashion. The old Daoist, meanwhile, was removing the cushions and table mats from the abode and distributing them among several nearby middle-aged cultivators, who were likely all advanced in years and without heirs.

He withdrew his gaze. Above, the purple-and-white brilliance of the Thunder Pool emerged from the cloud layers. Heavy black mist churned within it, seeming to brew infinite reserves of lightning, radiating an aura that was both dangerous and oppressive.

Following the familiar path, he stepped across the liquid lightning and ascended the silvery-white pavilion. Li Qinghong sat in the same spot as before, though this time her long hair cascaded freely over her shoulders. A blue-gold gourd now rested on the table. The woman’s pale lavender eyes locked onto him as she smiled.

"Minghuang, take a look at this spiritual artifact."

Li Zhouwei took his seat and lightly weighed the gourd. It felt significantly heavier.

Li Qinghong continued, "It is much as we predicted. The spiritual artifact has successfully transformed its nature to one of convergence, reinforced with Pond Sector Xin Metal of the Harmonising Metal. It is heavier by fourteen catties and seven taels. It has gained the ability to use Converging Water to erode an enemy's spiritual qi; it's far more potent than before. The Lustrous-Head Clan were here to construct formations, but their artifact refinement techniques and Dao attainment are truly first-class. This wasn't some casual patch job. Even the gourd's original owner wouldn't recognize it standing before him."

"Converging Water is the final destination toward which all rivers flow. By adding the Pond Sector Xin Metal—Harmonising Metal is, by nature, a metal of preservation and collection—the gourd can now contain spirit water. It will nurture the liquid within, slowing the dissipation of its spiritual essence. You can even store talisman water crafted from an immortal foundation inside it."

"Thank you, my Lady!"

Li Zhouwei nodded repeatedly as he listened. He accepted the gourd, stored it safely in his sleeve, and after offering several more thanks, he remarked:

"Harmonising Metal is certainly peculiar. I have rarely seen it within the Seas. If it is truly a metal of preservation, I suspect the few spiritual artifacts our family possesses capable of storing spiritual items must have been refined using this substance."

Li Qinghong smiled faintly. "Although I do not cultivate the Metal Virtue, I have been reading some hidden scriptures lately. Your guess is almost certainly correct. Harmonising Metal is exceedingly rare these days, which is precisely why ancient spiritual artifacts could often preserve spiritual items, whereas most modern ones cannot."

"Speaking of this... the matter of the 'Three Metals' has troubled my family for a long time. Even though the Water Virtue is incomplete, it is still referred to as the 'Five Waters.' Why, then, is Metal Virtue only the 'Three Metals'? Brother Wushao and I studied this privately several times but found nothing. I eventually asked..."

"It turns out both of those missing paths to Fruition Attainment are already occupied. Furthermore, their holders are both located Beyond the Heavens, and their current status is... difficult to articulate. The implication from the Dragon-kin is that these two paths are not only difficult to cultivate, they are currently impossible to *achieve*. This has led to the awkward, incomplete state we have today."

"Although spiritual items aligned with these two paths occasionally appear in the mainland and the Seas, cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm are pitifully rare. As for Purple Mansion Realm-grade spiritual items, they no longer manifest in the world; they can only be passed down as ancient legacies or extracted from ancient spiritual artifacts. In the last thousand years, I have heard of fewer than ten cultivators who attempted these paths. All were Heaven's Chosen prodigies, but they strayed onto these two divergent roads, only to languish and die during the early Purple Mansion Realm. Today, only one such person remains."

Doubt stirred in Li Zhouwei's heart. "I have heard that methods exist to convert between different daos, such as 'Refining Pristine Water into Converging Water' or the 'Art of Borrowing Geng for Dui.' Can these two missing Metal Virtues be obtained through similar means?"

Li Qinghong shook her head. "That, I do not know."

Li Zhouwei grew contemplative, his mind suddenly turning to the Jiang Family incident.

'No wonder... No wonder that Daoist Master from the Wang Family went so far as to destroy an ancient spiritual artifact just to extract the Six Xin Harmonising Metal. The empty husk is supposedly still in their vaults. So this is why: Harmonising Metal is no longer being naturally produced... The Wang Family commands the Wandering Metal in this age; if a conversion method existed, what element could they *not* create? Why would they need to travel thousands of miles just to destroy an ancient spiritual artifact? Since even the Wang Family resorted to that, it must truly be impossible to convert.'

Understanding dawned on him, and he felt he had gained significant insight. He nodded. "No wonder it is said that when the 'Three Metals' manifest, the Metal Virtue is considered proven. If this is the case, then it truly is all 'complete'—all that can exist, already does."

After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Li Zhouwei spoke again. "There is one other matter I must ask you, my Lady. What do you know regarding secret methods? Are there any known cases of a cultivator reaching the late Foundation Establishment Realm who has also achieved significant attainment in these secret arts?"

Li Zhouwei knew that asking Li Qinghong was tantamount to asking the Dragon-kin directly. Fortunately, the Dragon-kin were aware that he carried the burden of Fate, giving him the courage to ask. To his surprise, however, Li Qinghong merely paused, shook her head, and replied:

"I have never even cultivated an secret method, so naturally, I know nothing of such matters."

Li Zhouwei could only let the matter drop. They chatted for a short while longer within the Thunder Pool before he finally rose to take his leave.

"I am greatly indebted to you for this, my Lady. On my return, I will detour by Crimson Reef Island and stop at Tai'e Island to exchange for some magical implements. Afterward, I will follow the coast down toward the Vermillion Sea to trade for supplies before returning to the Zongquan Island region to enter secluded cultivation."

Li Qinghong nodded and walked him out of the pavilion. Softly, she said:

"The Old Master is advanced in years. Please, ask him to take good care of his health. I am confined to this pool and cannot leave, but I miss him terribly... I have now cultivated the Thunder Body. If a storm ever brews over Moongaze Lake and lightning flashes upon its surface, tell him to consider it me, visiting my great-uncle."

"This junior will certainly relay the message."

They walked all the way to the edge of the Lightning Pool. Her vermillion lips parted slightly, and she hesitated for a long moment. She seemed to have a warning or advice to impart, but, perhaps considering her station, she ultimately swallowed her words.

Li Zhouwei saw the hesitation. He offered a deep, prolonged bow, making no promises or oaths. He simply mounted his escaping light and departed toward the west.

Moongaze Lake.

Dawn rose as always. A young man in crimson robes stood at the highest point of the pavilion, gazing out over the entire lake prefecture. Behind him, a young man in black robes stood bowed, looking only a few years his senior. He wore a sword at his waist and held an extremely respectful posture.

The crimson-robed youth slowly withdrew his gaze, letting it fall upon the small letter in his hand. His brow furrowed, a trace of cold disdain touching his features as he spoke in a low voice:

"Kong Guli is dead..."

The young man behind him remained calm. He bowed and replied:

"This subordinate also received the news. The Sacred Writ Gate is handling the funeral with great fanfare. I fear we will be required to send representatives."

It had only been a few years since the Kong Family submitted to the Sacred Writ Gate when the turmoil in the Eastern Sea began. As one of the two surviving elders of the Kong Family, Kong Guli had been entrusted with heavy responsibilities there. He had been dispatched by the Sacred Writ Gate to reinforce Purple Smoke, only to be ambushed halfway by the Chunyi Dao Gate, dying on the road.

When the news returned, Kong Guxi wailed in grief. But before he had wept more than a few moments, Daoist Master Zhu Gong personally traveled to the Chunyi Dao Gate to confront Daoist Master Guanghou. The dispute lasted for several days. Upon her return, she immediately promoted Kong Xiaxiang to the powerful position of Protector and bestowed several marriage contracts with the direct bloodline, all by way of compensation.

Kong Guli’s funeral, meanwhile, was held with extravagant splendor and the highest possible honors. The elder’s children and grandchildren were nearly all gone. They found the youngest remaining boy in the Kong bloodline, whom Daoist Master Zhu Gong personally accepted as a disciple, and invited all the major families to attend the condolences and witness the ceremony.

This grand spectacle lasted for several days, and Li Jiangqian monitored it closely. He refolded the letter in his hand, shaking his head.

"Chen Yang, our delegation for the condolences must be impressive. The Sacred Writ Gate is trying to strengthen its bond with the Kong Family, binding them to the point where they are inseparable. My Li Family must, therefore, be extra cautious to avoid any suspicion. This requires you to lead the trip personally."

He instructed, "Also, be mindful... do not engage in idle chatter with the Kong Family members. Kong Guxi will not seek you out. And since our family has reached the Purple Mansion Realm level, they won't dare cause an ugly scene or sever relations. At worst, you will simply have to endure their cold expressions."

"This subordinate understands!"

Visiting the Sacred Writ Gate was certainly not a pleasant assignment. Li Jiangqian was privately wary that the Xuanmu Dao Lineage was attempting to drive a wedge between the Li and Kong families, forcing the Kongs to cling desperately to the Sacred Writ Gate's thigh. If someone hot-tempered like Ding Weizeng were sent, they would inevitably clash. Cui Jueyin's status, meanwhile, was too sensitive. Chen Yang, however, had always been thorough and perceptive. Entrusting this to him was the most appropriate choice.

Chen Yang accepted the command and withdrew. Li Jiangqian remained standing on the high platform. After a moment, he saw Cui Jueyin ascend from below. Cui Jueyin bowed, offering forth a jade slip with both hands.

"Reporting to the Patriarch: the Milin Dao Garden established some time ago has been attended by numerous mortal members of the clan. We tested them individually these past few days, and we now have the results."

"Even when mortals study the Dao classics, there are clear differences in their aptitude. Some, despite being unable to cultivate, demonstrate a strong comprehension of Dao methods. Others, through sheer diligence, can barely grasp a concept or two. And some have clearly received guidance from cultivators in their families and show minor achievements..."

Li Jiangqian frowned. "If they already have cultivators guiding them, what need is there to attend the Milin Dao Garden?"

Cui Jueyin looked slightly embarrassed. "The family established the Dao Garden intending it for the clan’s poorer disciples. But after several months, the majority of the clan members have enrolled... Firstly, the cultivators in their immediate families rarely have the spare time to instruct them. Secondly... they don't have much to teach."

Li Jiangqian paused, stunned, then shook his head. "It seems I overestimated them."

When it truly came down to Dao methods, the average rogue cultivator only knew one or two basic spells. Likewise, the family's Guest Elders, unless they specialized in talisman drawing, spirit plants, alchemy, or artifact refinement, possessed no meaningful Dao attainment even at the Qi Refining stage. Only upon reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm and forging one's immortal foundation does a cultivator begin to gain true insight into the world.

Although the Li Family was an Immortal Clan with abundant Daoist scriptures, even members of the direct bloodline only began gaining slight Dao attainment during Qi Refining. Of the clan's few Qi Refining cultivators, only the brothers Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang had any spare time. But no matter how much they cared for the junior clan members, they could not halt their own cultivation to instruct mortals.

Thus, the fact that the Milin Dao Garden was overflowing with students was simultaneously unexpected and perfectly logical. Li Jiangqian smiled and shook his head.

"This is an unexpected boon. The growing rift between the various courtyards might be mitigated by this... Separate the children into groups. Make sure to pair those from different branches who are unfamiliar with one another, and split up those from the same courtyard. Force them to get acquainted..."

Ever one to seize an opportunity, he implemented the slight change. Cui Jueyin carefully noted the instruction and continued:

"There are indeed a few individuals who show a profound understanding of Dao methods, often making astonishing insights. But since they cannot cultivate, their talent is ultimately useless."

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow, thinking to himself. 'The Talisman Seed functions as a spiritual aperture... Perhaps these children could seek it out... Unfortunately, by the time they demonstrate such academic talent, it is far too late. They are well past the age of six, and it has already been confirmed they cannot cultivate... It is of little use. Forget it. If any of them possessed truly transcendent talent, like Quewan, the Talisman Seed would have responded on its own...'

He waved Cui Jueyin away. Suddenly, he sensed strands of Clear Qi rising toward the zenith. Wisps of energy brushed aside the cloud layer, revealing the Azure Sky. The energy was light and gentle; it flashed for only a brief instant before rapidly wilting away.

Li Jiangqian pondered this, watching the phenomenon intently. "This is a celestial phenomenon I have never witnessed before."

Before long, a messenger arrived, bowing deeply before him.

"Reporting, my Lord. Old Master Tian Zhongqing of the Tian Clan has failed his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm. His body has perished, and his Dao has dissipated."

Understanding dawned on Li Jiangqian. He shook his head. "So, that was the sign of 'Clear Qi' failing a breakthrough... He was the only person in the entire lake region attempting to reach Foundation Establishment by cultivating Clear Qi. In those early years, the lake was impoverished, and he practiced the Clear Qi Dao Lineage. He simply grew too old. Although he changed his cultivation method since then, it was ultimately too late."

He seemed genuinely remorseful for a moment. "He managed to hold on for so long. While the Inward Heart Surging Profundity benefits the Immortal Dao and secluded cultivation, and it clarifies the Twelve Qi, all of which helped him immensely, it still wasn't quite enough... If he had practiced a third or fourth-grade cultivation method from the start, and had more resources, he might have attempted this breakthrough ten or twenty years younger. Back then, he would have had a chance."

"In the early days, our family lacked geniuses, but several of the stewards from external families were excellent. What a pity..."

The man from the Jade Court Guard bowed and retreated quickly. Li Jiangqian pondered this on the platform for a moment before someone from Qingdu arrived right behind him, reporting the news:

"Old Master Tian left final words. His immortal remains are to be buried by the Meichi River in Lijing Prefecture. It is said that Elder Chen shed tears upon hearing the news. Lord Li Wen and Old Master An have already set out."

Tian Zhongqing's great-aunt had been Lord Xiangping's wife; the old man himself called Li Xuanfeng 'Cousin-Uncle.' His status was prominent, and he had been an instrumental figure in the clan's rise. Li Jiangqian sighed heavily.

"Send some compensation to the Tian family. I recall the old master lost all heirs in his son's generation. The one currently managing the Tian family is named... Tian Ling. He is at the Qi Refining level. Although only a nephew, he served Tian Zhongqing as a son would serve a father. Bestow the gifts upon him."

He waved the messenger away, stepped down from the high platform, and added:

"I will go personally."
