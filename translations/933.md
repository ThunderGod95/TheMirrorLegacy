# Chapter 933: The Pawn

Purple-gold light swirled through the rising mists. A light breeze whispered through the high pavilion where a man in gold-flame robes stood, his hands resting on the railing. His magnificent robes fluttered as he gazed calmly at the towering, purple-gold pillars veiled in the ethereal clouds.

'The scenery on this island isn't bad... but the formation is mediocre. It's laid out according to the traditions of the Supreme Yang Dao. There are a few novel touches, but on the whole, it's far too rigid.'

The Daoist Master's gaze swept over the island, and a curious look entered his eyes.

'This tiny Moongaze Lake... it actually supports so many low-level cultivators. Its resources must be abundant. But unlike the Wei-Li immortal officials, who integrate with the populace, these cultivators are split up and managed by various immortal mountains. Even if the low-level cultivators are productive and don't require a huge investment... what's the point of raising them?'

'Even if the Buddhist cultivators invade from the south and bodies are needed to hold the line, only the lives of those in the Foundation Establishment Realm truly count. Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining cultivators... they're just useless fodder.'

The Daoist Master waited for a while. The man behind him remained perfectly still, head bowed. When a figure materialized nearby, the Daoist Master turned with a smile. Upon seeing it was Li Zhouwei, he felt a flash of disappointment, though his expression didn't change. He bowed.

"Daoist Friend Minghuang, I have long heard of your reputation!"

"Greetings, Senior Tianhuo."

Li Zhouwei replied, observing the Daoist Master from the Golden Feather Sect. He was strikingly handsome and carried himself with an elegant air, yet his casual, almost flippant demeanor matched the rumors perfectly.

'I've heard this Daoist Master Tianhuo was the late-born son of a great figure in the Golden Feather Sect and was thoroughly spoiled. He's known to be playful and informal... and even had a reputation as a wastrel in his youth.'

The youth following him was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator of the Jing Dragon King lineage. He appeared completely docile. This must be Su Yan. Capital immortals Dao had claimed his demonic arts were terrifying and that he was wild and untamable, but right now, there wasn't a trace of arrogance about him. He looked like any other well-behaved junior.

The fact that Tianhuo had reached the Purple Mansion Realm naturally disproved the worst of the rumors, but his troublesome personality seemed to be just as reported. He smiled as Li Zhouwei approached.

"When I came here years ago, I met Chen Taoping in the marketplace. He was just looking for a cultivation art to break through. He even asked if Golden Feather wanted Moongaze Lake. In his hands, this island was a wreck, so I refused. I never expected to see it again, shrouded in purple-gold light, with clouds wreathing a resting qilin. It is truly a blessed land. It just shows your esteemed clan's profound foundation."

"It is nothing, far inferior to Golden Feather."

Li Zhouwei gave a polite, formulaic reply and invited him to sit. Tianhuo smiled and entered, his gaze sweeping imperceptibly over the Spiritual Artifact at Li Zhouwei's waist. He noted the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, and his eyes shifted away, his smile never faltering.

Once tea was served, Tianhuo smiled. "I just came from the sect. I was originally coming to find *the* Daoist Master, as Zhaojing and I had some old arrangements... but I heard some news on the way."

"I am listening."

Li Zhouwei replied. Tianhuo said, "I hear the north has newly established the Huai River Dao. The Profound Governance Pavilion has been ordered to promote a dao lineage to serve as the Huai River Dao's orthodox governance. Daoist Friend Yehui has the highest cultivation, so he rushed to the capital overnight... There's still no word!"

Tianhuo's smile was unreadable. "His Capital Guard dao is at odds with the Buddhist cultivators, and he's standing in this position. It's no wonder he's in a hurry to see Wei Xuanyin. And Wei Xuanyin needs people in Jiangbei, so it's normal for them to hit it off."

Yehui had already come to discuss this. The man was only standing in the eye of the storm to seek his own Dao; he had no firm loyalties. Li Zhouwei wasn't surprised. He only asked, "Since Senior has news from the north, do you know what has become of the Valiant King?"

Daoist Master Tianhuo lowered his head to sip his tea. "No news on that. I only heard the capital plans to invite him back. As for whether they'll send someone from the Gao down... it's hard to say."

Currently, two figures were in charge of the lands north of the river: Fachang, the Buddhist cultivator from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, and the Valiant King. One was at odds with his superiors, and the other had no desire to stir up trouble. As a result, both sides remained quiet, which was a clear sign that the northern powers had no intention of crossing the river.

But if the Valiant King left, the peace on the riverbank would likely be shattered.

Seeing Li Zhouwei pause, Tianhuo smiled. "However, I *do* have a piece of good news for you."

He retrieved a jade box from his sleeve, set it on the table, and said in a more serious tone, "The Great River and Grand Mound Scripture has been unlocked. I am here to fulfill our promise to your clan."

Tianhuo had taken Su Yan back to his sect and borrowed the scripture precisely to use him to unlock the lineage. Now, he had finally succeeded. Tianhuo picked up the jade box, opened the lid, and took out a pure white jade slip. He smiled.

"Please."

"As expected of the descendants of the Golden Feather True Monarch. Your Immortal Dao inheritance is profound, to have unlocked this scripture... My family must thank you, Daoist Master."

Though Li Zhouwei's words were polite, he didn't immediately accept the slip. He studied it closely and smiled. "Daoist Master, you said that day that you were borrowing the jade slip and would return it after it was unlocked. But this one... appears to be a copy. What of the original Great River and Grand Mound Scripture?"

The only reason the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture had fallen into the Li family's hands was that the Golden Feather Sect had used their ancestor, Li Tongya, as a pawn, much like they were now using Su Yan. They had even taken a Spiritual Artifact from him, leaving behind the conspicuous Duruo Spear to draw the Miao Family's ire.

Back then, Li Tongya was just a minor cultivator and in no position to demand fairness. Since it hadn't led to disaster, the family hadn't pressed the issue. But the Golden Feather Sect had miscalculated, and the scripture now belonged to the Li Clan. It was clearly no simple item, and Li Zhouwei would not let it be taken from him so ambiguously.

As expected, Tianhuo looked slightly embarrassed. "Ah... once the jade slip was unlocked, it immediately transformed into a mote of Pit Water light and merged into Su Yan's Shengyang Acupoint. Su Yan is now an inner disciple of my Golden Feather Sect, and a talented alchemist. We can't very well... dismantle his Shengyang Acupoint."

He motioned, and Su Yan immediately stepped forward to bow. A golden glint flashed in Li Zhouwei's eyes. He could indeed see a speck of Pit Water light within the man's Shengyang Acupoint. It appeared to be some kind of inheritance, or perhaps a symbol of status.

'So the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture really did contain the inheritance of the ancient Chen Clan's immortal sect... Perhaps it's even the token of the Sect Master.'

This wasn't surprising. Otherwise, Chen Taoping wouldn't have spent his entire life searching for it, nor would the Golden Feather Sect have obsessed over it for four hundred years. Both men understood this perfectly without needing to say a word.

If the Li family cultivated the Pit Water Dao, this would be a painful loss. Fortunately, ever since they learned that Xiao Chuting was aiming to master the Pit Water Dao, the Li family's core lineage had steered clear of it.

It wasn't just the Li family. While common Pit Water cultivation arts were everywhere, profound lineages were rare. Cangzhou was far away in the Northern Sea, and the path was blocked by the terrifying Xiao Chuting. No one with any sense in Jiangnan dared to walk that path. But that didn't mean Li Zhouwei couldn't use this as leverage. He simply smiled.

"It seems the Daoist Master *does* have good news for me, then."

His accommodating attitude made Tianhuo visibly relax. "Thank you for your understanding, Daoist Master! I am indeed here to make amends."

Tianhuo continued, "That mote of Pit Water light settled, but it didn't do anything strange. I asked the elders in my sect, and they said it's related to the Great Ning Palace... Hah! What dynasty is that from? If Anhuai Heaven hadn't appeared, our two families could have used this to cooperate. But Anhuai Heaven has already come and gone, and the Great Ning Palace was destroyed long ago. What use is it now!"

Li Zhouwei considered this, then asked, "I heard the spiritual ingredient for the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill comes from a spiritual flower, described as: 'Yearly it blooms and withers, its fallen petals become armored insects'... It was originally obtained from the Eastern Fire. My family is interested in trading for it."

A treasure that "yearly blooms and withers" would produce at least one portion of a precious spiritual ingredient every year, making its value incomparable. He set a high bar by asking to trade. Tianhuo shook his head with a smile.

"Although Golden Feather obtained that flower, it is outside my cousin Qiushui's cave-dwelling. It belongs to her. Taking a few ingredients normally is fine, but she is currently undergoing Mercury Transformation to preserve her nature and cannot be disturbed. Even if I could, I couldn't bring myself to ask her. However, I *did* bring the Radiant Qilin Refining Art for the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill. It is my gift to you today."

Li Zhouwei had expected he might offer the art. He frowned slightly. "Senior, please explain."

Tianhuo's expression became serious. "This art has a long history. It was originally consumed in the Wei Imperial court and official residences, and it was protected by many secret arts. Several lineages have tried to unlock it, but failed. My Golden Feather Sect, however, has some ancestral inheritance that allowed us to open it."

"But after the fall of the Wei, the nature of Bright Yang itself changed, and the art became unusable. This copy, however, was modified by a Daoist Master of the Cui Clan, making it viable once more!"

"So it is a unique copy."

Li Zhouwei said quietly, "But without that spiritual ingredient, the pill art is useless to my family."

Tianhuo laughed. "As I said, the ingredients produced are all stored at Golden Feather. You need only come and trade for them."

He then reached into the jade box and withdrew a golden scroll, his expression solemn.

"Since we took an ancient art from your esteemed clan, we shall return an ancient art. This is the *original* text of the Radiant Qilin Refining Art from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. It is called the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll!"

The scroll was adorned with patterns at its four corners and felt as soft and fine as woven gold. His gesture was so considerate, and his excuse so plausible, that Li Zhouwei could hardly refuse. He accepted it with thanks, placed it back in the jade box, and said, "My thanks, Senior."

Tianhuo smiled. "I won't impose any longer. We are expecting important guests at the sect to discuss several urgent matters. I must return to greet them. It wouldn't be right to stay here."

Li Zhouwei's expression remained neutral. He raised his head slightly, his left hand gently closing the lid of the jade box. He left it on the table and asked, "It seems the trouble is in Jiangbei."

Tianhuo's smile held steady. "I think it's more than just Jiangbei."

Li Zhouwei's expression remained unchanged.

'What kind of guests would require multiple Golden Feather Purple Mansion masters to welcome them? What would require Tianhuo to rush back from his travels to be there on time?'

Li Zhouwei's breakthrough had been sudden. The lake had been peaceful since, and the north had shown no reaction. But this visit from Daoist Master Tianhuo had revealed the slightest hint of a gathering storm.

'It's not just Jiangbei. It's Jiangnan, too.'

He escorted Tianhuo off the lake. The Golden Feather Daoist Master's smile finally faded, and he grew silent. Just as he was about to depart, he spoke suddenly.

"Minghuang broke through in the Eastern Sea, yet you were willing to return... I presume you have no plans to leave again."

Li Zhouwei met his gaze evenly and smiled. "I only returned just in time to save our family members from Helian Wumeng."

Tianhuo gave him one last, deep look, then scattered like smoke and vanished.

...

Poluoduo.

When Li Ximing arrived on the wind, the Xipo Kingdom was still a vibrant, peaceful, and auspicious place. He had only just landed in the pavilion when the Demon King leaped up to greet him, overjoyed.

"Daoist Friend, you're here so quickly! Daoist Friend Qingyan hasn't returned yet!"

Even with Liu Changdie's guarantee, the fact that Li Ximing had already taken the Radiant Fire was a source of anxiety. Now, Fuxun rushed over, wreathed in joyous relief. Li Ximing kept it brief, stating he was there for the spiritual items as arranged.

"When will this other Daoist Friend be back?"

"I've already asked... He's in the Fenkuai region, searching for a spiritual item on an island. He's... well, he gets along well with humans and has a bit of a reputation. He can assist you. My own status is... sensitive. It wouldn't be good for me to enter Tiger's Frontier."

Fuxun looked awkward and glanced at Liu Changdie, clearly hoping he would offer to go to Tiger's Frontier as well. Liu Changdie, however, was perfectly relaxed. "Then let's set off," he smiled. "There's been a lot of trouble lately, and I need to go to Fenkuai anyway. That Vermilion Bird is stirring up trouble again. Since you've made a promise to Huo Yang, Daoist Friend Fuxun, you shouldn't leave the Xipo Kingdom. We two will go, make good time, and wait for Daoist Friend Qingyan in Fenkuai."

Fuxun had no choice but to retrieve the two spiritual items. He placed them in two glittering golden caskets, which he handed to Li Ximing along with a communication talisman. He also produced a storage bag, clearly filled with supplementary ingredients, and gave it all over, looking thoroughly dejected.

Li Ximing stifled a laugh and reached out to take them, but his arm immediately tensed with effort. He was surprised.

"Oh?"

Of the two golden caskets, one was as light as air, but the other was as heavy as a mountain. He had to channel his dharma power and divine ability, his fingers gripping tightly, just to lift the caskets with feigned ease and store them in his sleeve.

"We are relying on you, Daoist Friend!"

The two bid farewell to the Demon King and departed the Xipo Kingdom, riding the winds through the Great Void. Liu Changdie's mood had long since stabilized, and he began to ask curiously about Li Ximing's descendants.

Li Ximing, however, took the opportunity to smile and ask, "Senior, I heard you say before that your divine ability can nurture spiritual resources... I was wondering, does the 'Mansion Water' Dao conflict with your arts?"

Liu Changdie nodded. "Before the Harmonising-Vault Union, Vault Metal is a receptive metal. Aside from a few Water and Fire virtues it clashes with, it is compatible with most. As for various waters, besides Yin-Conjunction Clear Water, most waters benefit greatly from 'Vault Metal'."

"After the Harmonising-Vault Union, many of these traits become less distinct. The clashes aren't as violent, but the beneficial synergies aren't as strong, either... Still, it has its own unique marvels."

Li Ximing calculated that Mansion Water would also benefit, which set his mind at ease. Liu Changdie chuckled. "Is there some treasure you'd like me to see?"

Li Ximing smiled but said nothing. Liu Changdie understood that without a privacy formation, it was not the place to talk. The two continued their journey, parting ways at Linhai. Li Ximing sped directly to Tiger's Frontier. When he landed and inquired, he found that Houfu was indeed absent, but had left instructions: if Li Ximing arrived, he was to be given direct access to Kuidu Palace for his alchemy.

Kuidu Palace was located behind the main summit hall. It was not a tall structure, just a small, three-story pavilion. A Xiukui disciple led him inside, where a five-legged spiritual cauldron sat squarely in the center of the main hall.

Faint purple light pulsed from beneath it, suggesting it was currently nurturing a Spiritual Artifact. The Xiukui disciple bowed, withdrew, and sealed the hall doors. Li Ximing then turned his hand, retrieving a jade box from his storage bag.

Inside, three pitch-black scales shimmered faintly, emanating a dense, misty aura of Pit Water. It was the Cangzhou Serpent Scale.

'First, I'll fire up the cauldron and settle Dingyang Zi's fifteen pills. It will serve to warm up the cauldron and hopefully bring good fortune. After that, I'll wait for the others to arrive, and then I'll begin refining the great pill!'
