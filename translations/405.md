# Chapter 531: Huiyao

Li Yuanjiao stood with his hands behind his back, listening as Zong Yan introduced the island to him.

"There are more than five thousand people on the island, and most are fishermen. The island also cultivates rice and fruit, but the fields are sparse, so women and children handle most of the work..."

"There are many demons in the area, some of whom are the Dragon Son's lackeys. They tend to be greedy, so when some of our people don't return from venturing out to sea, we know they've been eaten."

After observing Zongquan Island for a while, purple and golden lights streaked in from the east and west. Zong Yan quickly opened the formation, and Li Qinghong and Kongheng landed one after the other.

Li Qinghong surveyed the surroundings and commented, "There are several islands to the east, but none are as good as this one. It's a pretty good size but the spiritual energy is weak."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement, while Kongheng clasped his hands together and spoke in a measured tone.

"I traveled westward. The sea was vast but without a suitable place to establish ourselves."

After hearing their conversation, realization struck Zong Yan and he felt a surge of excitement.

So, these cultivators of orthodox Dao from the mainland are looking for a place to settle! Wonderful! They appear to be disciples of the immortal sect‚ÄîZongquan Island's time has finally come!

Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong exchanged glances and came to a decision. Noticing her brother's stern expression, which made him appear fierce, Li Qinghong turned to Zong Yan, who seemed delighted.

"Fellow Daoist, as you can see, we intend to establish a base at sea. Zongquan Island is quite suitable for us. We would like to investigate further and discuss this matter in detail with you."

Since Li Yuanjiao intended to take on the role of a villain, Li Qinghong stepped in to chair the negotiation. Although she spoke politely and expressed her intention to discuss the matter in detail, Zong Yan understood that there was little room for negotiation due to the stark disparity between their strengths. It all came down to whether this group would ultimately decide to take over this island.

Zong Yan timidly agreed before Li Qinghong requested, "Well then, fellow Daoist, please accompany Kongheng and the other guest cultivators to survey the earth vein and assess the spiritual energy."

Kongheng excused himself and went off with the rest, leaving Li Yuanjiao standing alongside his younger sister.

He voiced his concerns and Li Qinghong contemplated for a moment before replying, "From what I've observed along the way, the Eastern Sea Dragon Clan treats the islands as fields and the people as livestock, much like raising pigs and cattle in a pen. Even the Golden Tang Gate and the Profound Peak Gate have to pay their tributes; it will be nearly impossible for us to avoid that."

"That's true," Li Yuanjiao agreed, lowering his gaze before saying, "I wonder if I could meet the Dragon Son or find a way to negotiate the matter... perhaps use other resources to pay. Regardless, I need to try."

Li Qinghong shook her head and said softly, "It'll likely be very difficult for you to meet the Dragon Son. Although he is only at the Foundation Establishment Realm, he is a noble dragon. I can't even imagine how many demon generals he commands. Even if we manage to meet him, we can't predict what kind of payment he might demand. It would be better to start with the lesser demons and bribe them with a generous sum, which may ultimately cost less."

The two of them rode the wind through the dark night, sinking into the sea without even realizing it.

Under the night sky, the Scarlet Pristine Sea sparkled with countless tiny green lights. The mana lights deep in the sea flickered like stars, creating a breathtaking sight in the darkness. The golden magnificence of the demon palaces could be seen from the distance.

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and remarked, "Only after leaving the Eastern Sea did I realize how small the mainland is and how powerful the demons are. The strength of the Eastern Sea demon clan alone can rival that of Jiangnan. It's even rarer to see such a unified command; they are deeply rooted and work together."

Sighing, Li Yuanjiao turned back to glance at Zongquan Island, while Li Qinghong said softly, "This island has no fire veins or earth veins; it offers little benefit other than a few sources of incense. The important thing is to establish a foothold overseas. Our family is gradually stabilizing as a prominent clan... we should consider reaching the Purple Mansion Realm."

"Without the right cultivation techniques and opportunities, it's all just empty talk," Li Yuanjiao replied, shaking his head before continuing, "In my opinion, our family can only improve significantly by obtaining what Yu Muxian possesses."

Given Yu Muxian's status, it was impossible for him to die on the mainland. If the Li Family wished to plot against him, their only option was to ambush him in the Eastern Sea with the help of the mirror, in a way that they could avoid Daoist Master Yuanwu's retaliation. This was also a troublesome matter.

Li Yuanjiao added, "Once the island matters are settled, you should return home first. I will stay here to guard, cultivate in seclusion, and try my luck to break through to the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Meanwhile, send people to the major markets to gather all available information about the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and their immortal foundations. These are classified information on the mainland, but there might still be opportunities to uncover them overseas," he said.

"All right," Li Qinghong replied.

Thunder immortal foundation was not highly coveted in Jiangnan, making it more suitable for her to remain on Qingdu. The siblings discussed for a while longer before landing back on the island.

Kongheng approached them and reported politely, "There are three relatively strong earth veins on the island, but the others are weak with shallow spiritual energy. It's impossible to establish a Foundation Establishment Realm formation; at most, it can only support one that is at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm."

After hearing this, Li Yuanjiao turned to Zong Yan and asked, "When will the Dragon Son's subordinates arrive?"

"In the next few days!" Zong Yan replied quickly.

At that moment, a cheer suddenly erupted on the island. A man arrived on the wind and whispered something into Zong Yan's ear. Li Yuanjiao cast a neutral glance at him and Zong Yan immediately caught on.

He bowed and said, "My lord, I practice the Six Yi All-In-One Technique on my island. I follow the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao but wield the shamanic spells and talismans. There are many Dao paths to raise medicine-humans... All this was granted by the Dragon Son, for the sake of raising them..."

"And we just found a baby born on the required day..." he added.

Zong Yan spoke vaguely, wary of offending the others. He lowered his voice and continued, "Each time the tributes are collected, the Dragon Son keeps the one with a specific birthday for the next collection. If no suitable person is found, he will use a hundred others to offset it. So... each time a suitable child is discovered, it's hard for us to contain our excitement."

Before Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong could respond, Kongheng could no longer restrain himself. He said in a sudden outburst of emotion, "Don't you have an ounce of compassion? Even if you're sacrificing one to save many, you shouldn't be so proud of it! Are you going to thank the evil dragon next year if it eats one less person next year?!"

Zong Yan dropped to his knees, horrified.

"Master Monk, you can't say that! If it weren't for the Dragon Son's protection, we would have been killed by passing devil cultivators or devoured by the demon generals... How can we not be grateful?"

Kongheng was taken aback. He stared at Zong Yan in disbelief for a few breaths before exclaiming, "So, you're saying that a minor crime isn't a crime?"

Zong Yan was confused by the monk's reaction. He raised his head in fear and mumbled, "But Lord Dragon Son saved us from a greater evil... Everyone knows we should choose the lesser of two evils. Why do you want to beat him down for it?"

"But he clearly eats people! How can you still be grateful toward him?"

"That's enough..." Li Qinghong interjected, trying to mediate. The perspectives of Kongheng and Zong Yan were so different that they would probably continue to argue until dawn without an outcome.

Zong Yan responded timidly, while Kongheng let out a long sigh before apologizing and appeared lost in thought.

The two men left and Li Yuanjiao stood with his hands behind his back, somewhat absent-minded before slowly closing his eyes. Li Qinghong looked back, and Li Yuanjiao murmured, "There is a demon outside."

The two of them rode the wind out and soon spotted a green fish hovering in the air. A pair of scaly wings grew from beneath its ribs, making it look particularly strange. Li Yuanjiao rode forward to meet it.

The fish's large eyes locked onto the two cultivators, its mouth opening and closing as it spoke in a clear voice, "Where do you come from, fellow Daoists? This is the territory of my Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace."

This fish demon was at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and had not yet achieved the Foundation Establishment. Both members of the Li Family were Foundation Establishment cultivators, and were much stronger than it was. The fish demon was quite polite, yet spoke to them as equals in conversation.

Li Qinghong spoke respectfully, "My brother and I were originally cultivators from a minor sect at Lake Xian. After our sect collapsed, we passed through here and considered settling down here. However, we are unfamiliar with this place and hope you can offer us some advice, fellow Daoist."

"You are too polite, fellow Daoist," the fish demon replied, folding its wings and stepping onto the demonic wind. Its fish lip curled up slightly as its scales flipped in the wind and dripped with mucus.

With a cryptic expression, it continued, "I am from the Hui Clan in the algae, patrolling the sea for the Serpent Dragon Palace. My name is Huiyao. If the two Daoists are willing to serve my Serpent Dragon Palace, I will naturally share everything I know."

The fish then retracted its tail and transformed into a half-man, half-fish figure, looking rather sinister and ugly. It wielded a fork and stared at the two of them. In this situation, the status of the cultivators from the mainland and the overseas demons was reversed; Li Yuanjiao and the others were now asking for favors, like Luken the deer demon from the past.

Nevertheless, Li Yuanjiao was not one to blow his own horn. Despite the fish demon's grotesque visage, he smiled and said in a deep voice, "This way please, fellow Daoist."

As soon as they descended together, Zong Yan approached and bowed, "Greetings, Grandpa Sea Patrol. I have prepared the tributes!"

Huiyao chuckled and happily replied, "Hehe! Good for you. After enduring for so many years, you're finally in charge of this place!"

"Y-Yes..." Zong Yan nodded, flattered, and signaled for his men to fetch the tributes. They entered the hall, and the servants quickly served them tea. Zong Yan kneeled beside Huiyao and presented a jade bottle filled with red blood.

Huiyao waved his hands, scolding, "You blind fool! We have a distinguished guest today; it is inappropriate to drink this!"

Realization struck Zong Yan as he retracted the bottle respectfully. Li Yuanjiao's expression remained unchanged, while Li Qinghong's smile grew more pronounced.

Huiyao continued, "My subordinate has embarrassed himself. Please forgive him, both of you."

Huiyao was not foolish. The faces of these two were filled with pure qi, suggesting they were mainland cultivators or disciples of some ancient sect. However, its own strength was currently inferior, and it was not foolish enough to offend these cultivators. If the two of them truly killed him and escaped, the Dragon Son might not necessarily chase them down.

After exchanging a few words with Huiyao, Li Yuanjiao cut to the chase.

"What is the expected tribute for Zongquan Island?"

Huiyao regarded him calmly and replied, "This place is barren, the Dragon Son has never bothered us. It has been given to my clan, so the tributes are for me!"

The siblings exchanged glances, realizing that Huiyao had the upper hand in the negotiation now. Li Yuanjiao felt a headache coming on, but the fish demon continued, "Are you cultivating Pit Water, fellow Daoist? Can you show me your ability?"

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, summoning a grayish-blue serpent dragon that rose gracefully in the courtyard before them. Huiyao glanced at it, nodded, and said, "I see, it's the Jing Dragon King! No wonder I felt a sense of familiarity the moment I saw you, fellow Daoist... The Dragon Son also practices this method‚Äîthe Jing Dragon King."

Huiyao pondered for a moment before speaking seriously.

"Since you would like to establish your base here, this arrangement is beneficial for both of us... I won't make it hard for your esteemed clan."

It stretched out its fish-like hand and casually continued, "One medicine-human each year, ten Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit items, and two Qi Cultivation Realm spirit items. Ores are acceptable too. As for the passing demons that seek bribes, that's for you two to handle."

The demon did not have much use for Spirit Stones, so most of its demands centered around spirit items and humans. This requirement was significantly greater than Zong Yan's original demand of three hundred people over five years. Huiyao said that it would not make things difficult for them, but his demands were far from reasonable.

Before either of them could respond, Huiyao stated directly, "By the rules of my Serpent Dragon Palace... No matter where you come from, you must obey the Dragon Clan's orders when you enter our territory."

Huiyao's statement was no different than a reminder for Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong to drop their arrogance. The words were harsh, and Zong Yan began to sweat nervously, fearing the siblings might lose their composure from this provocation.

He dropped to his knees, grasping Huiyao's fish-like leg, and cried, "Grandpa Sea Patrol! It's my fault for not gathering news properly. Please consider the many years of hard work I've put in and spare me..."

Huiyao pursed its lips and kicked him away. However, Li Yuanjiao remained calm and replied politely, "I understand your demands, fellow Daoist. It's just that offering medicine-humans goes against my family's rules. Can that be substituted with something else?"

"Substituted?" Huiyao repeated, then laughed sarcastically, "Others use medicine-humans as substitutions for spirit items, but you do the opposite. How foolish! Are you even aware of the cost? What can you offer year after year?"

Li Yuanjiao retrieved a jade box from his storage pouch and offered, "How about this?"

Hu Yao looked down to see a small flower resting inside the jade box. He sniffed it and exclaimed, "A Foundation Establishment Realm spirit item?!"

"Yes, one flower in exchange for five years' worth of medicine-humans," Li Yuanjiao replied, putting it away before Huiyao could inspect it further.

Huiyao wiped his drool but protested, "Five years? That's too much!"

"Think about it again, fellow Daoist. This is a spirit flower from the mainland. It makes a good present for a demon general. I acquired it through some favors with the Han Family," Li Yuanjiao countered.

Huiyao's face lit up with greed upon hearing that. Li Yuanjiao deliberately paused before asking, "Will this work?"

"Yes! Yes!" Huiyao replied eagerly, but Li Yuanjiao deliberately continued, "Alas, it's a pity that this cannot be shown to others... On second thought... Perhaps I should go with medicine-humans!"

"Fellow Daoist, what do you mean by that?!" Huiyao's expression shifted dramatically once more.

Li Yuanjiao explained in a low voice, "This flower was acquired through certain means... The Han Family has always kept its existence under wraps. If it becomes public knowledge, it could lead to serious trouble!"

The Wanglin Blossom was not exclusive to his family. Li Yuanjiao was an overthinker, so it was impossible for him to overlook this, so he made up a story to tempt Huiyao.

"Ah!"

Huiyao's expression changed completely as various possibilities raced through his mind.

Li Yuanjiao smiled, adding, "I came to the Eastern Sea merely to find a place to settle. If things don't work out, the worst I can do is leave and return home. The Serpent Dragon Palace cannot extend its reach to the mainland. Fellow Daoist, you better consider this carefully!"

His tone was gentle, but an underlying threat was evident. Huiyao fell silent for a moment, then realized that Li Yuanjiao had stepped closer, pressing his hand on the hilt of his sword.

Huiyao started, catching a glimpse of the green and white sword light flowing in Li Yuanjiao's grasp. For a moment, his legs turned to jelly, and panic set in.

The situation had shifted too quickly; in just a few exchanges, the power dynamic had completely changed. It seemed he had no choice but to comply with this person.
