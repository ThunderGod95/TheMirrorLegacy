# Chapter 255: Sent to Mount Yue

Xiao Chuting paused for a moment and then spoke softly, "Now that I have achieved the Purple Mansion Realm and mastered divine abilities, even having my name registered in the Underworld, there are many matters I must refrain from involving myself in now. Yuansi's idea of having me take action is too naive... the four Daoists of Azure Pond Sect are all watching. Using my abilities to influence the situation subtly is still acceptable, but personally taking action to kill Yu Yufeng would break the rules."

Li Tongya hastily cupped his fist in respect and replied, "We shall handle everything according to the Daoist Master's wishes... My family awaits your instructions."

Seeing his respectful attitude, Xiao Chuting nodded approvingly and continued, "I have reviewed the jade slip Yuansi brought back. It indeed contains the footwork technique of Daoist Master Xianyou, which is of great significance to us. Given the good relations between our two families and the fact that your Li Family is currently being oppressed by the Yu Family, it is only right that we offer our help. Although I cannot personally take action, I can still easily handle them."

As a Daoist Master of the Purple Mansion Realm, Xiao Chuting's mere words could make the Yu Family tremble with fear and apologize. Yu Xiaogui would personally come to apologize, not daring to secretly humiliate the Li Family. Such a statement was simply an excuse to suppress the Yu Family and support the Li Family at Moongaze Lake, hence, Li Tongya was naturally eager to hear it and listened respectfully.

"Our Xiao Family is now an independent immortal clan, no longer under Azure Pond's jurisdiction. We cannot arbitrarily send Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to kill Azure Pond's clan members. Fortunately, although our Xiao Family is not powerful, we have a few Foundation Establishment Realm guest cultivators. I will send them to deal with Yu Yufeng," Xiao Chuting said, speaking in a calm tone.

Li Tongya acknowledged this and then voiced his doubt. "However, Yu Yufeng is cautious and spends most of his time in seclusion within the mountain gate, rarely stepping outside. It will not be easy to encircle and kill him..."

"Indeed," Xiao Chuting agreed as he smiled faintly, gently lifting the white jade fishing rod in his hand. He pulled the baitless jade hook from the deep pool, causing ripples on the surface. A knowing smile crossed his face.

"Yu Yufeng will come out. Not only will he come out, but he will also follow the Guli Road eastward to a secluded, nameless hill in Mushroom Forest Plain and wait for us there."

Li Tongya felt a chill down his spine, his pores tingling as he thought to himself, The power of the Purple Mansion Realm's divine abilities is truly formidable...

His face remained serious as he nodded. Xiao Chuting's tone then shifted to one of earnest advice as he said, "As for your Li Family, you must carefully consider your future path. Once the Yu Family falls, there will be no prominent rivals at Moongaze Lake. You must think carefully about what your next steps would be."

"Understood!" Li Tongya nodded solemnly.

Xiao Chuting paused again and then spoke softly, "Someone from the Li Family must join the Azure Pond Sect."

Li Tongya's expression remained unchanged, but his mind was in turmoil. Without hesitation, he asked, "Who do you think is suitable, Daoist Master?"

Li Tongya recognized that Xiao Chuting's tone was not one of solicitation or discussion, but a calm instruction. Thus, he did not question or argue but responded directly.

Xiao Chuting paused for a moment because of Li Tongya's decisiveness, then chuckled softly. "You are a smart man; you should understand this matter. The case of Li Chejing was only because he possessed the Moonlight Immortal Foundation and extraordinary talent. Ordinary disciples would not face such a fate. This strategy is not about sacrificing your family's children for Azure Pond Sect...but rather, it is a threefold beneficial plan."

"Firstly, since your family is still under Azure Pond's jurisdiction, having disciples cultivating within the sect ensures a range of benefits for you—smooth communication, ease in handling matters, and a life-saving backing... all of which are excellent!

"Secondly, the disciples sent to the immortal sect do not need to be exceptionally talented, they just need to be above average. That way, they would not fall victim to harm while still able to contribute to the family. As they progressed to higher cultivation realm, they could even gain some power within the sect."

Xiao Chuting's tone remained polite as he continued, "Our family has separated from Azure Pond, our disciples have withdrawn and most of our informants have lost contact with us, this has left us unaware of their internal situation. If your family can send a disciple inside, it would greatly benefit both our families... As for who that may be, that decision is yours to make."

For a distinguished Purple Mansion Realm cultivator like Xiao Chuting to explain the matter in such detail surprised Li Tongya and left him feeling honored.

"But... it is not easy to become a disciple of Azure Pond..." he responded hesitantly after some time.

However, it seemed like Xiao Chuting had already arranged everything and answered simply, "The population on Qingsui Peak is sparse. Si Yuanbai has left the sect, and our Yuansi has also departed from Qingsui Peak, leaving only his junior sister Yuan Tuan there. Now is the time for assistance; if you send someone to be her disciple, Yuan Tuan will surely not refuse."

"Understood," Li Tongya nodded.

Xiao Chuting stopped speaking, glancing at him before continuing, "You may go now... I hope you will not fail in your duty and lead the Li Family well."

Li Tongya cupped his fists in respect and descended from the cliff, walking down the mountain. When he reached the pond, Xiao Yuansi nodded to him politely in acknowledgment. After watching Li Tongya leave, Xiao Yuansi soared up and landed beside Xiao Chuting, speaking in a soft voice.

"Ancestor... you called for me?"

Xiao Chuting nodded and asked, "Is everything arranged for Guiluan? Does she have any complaints or dissatisfaction?"

"Everything has been prepared. Guiluan has read the information about Li Yuanjiao's achievements carefully and expressed her willingness to marry," Xiao Yuansi responded respectfully.

Xiao Chuting then lifted the white jade fishing rod gently with two fingers and said softly, "It's about time she gets married. Back then, I had introduced her to many young talents in the prefecture, but she remained silent... I figured that she might be inclined to marry outside our family. Thankfully, the Li Family has enough standing."

Xiao Chuting's words clarified the intricacies. After all, the difference between marrying a rogue cultivator to live quietly on a small peak and marrying into another family as the principal wife with a grand dowry was significant.

Xiao Yuansi understood this well and replied softly, "Ancestor, you are wise. Knowing that the Li Family would not marry our direct daughter, you informed Yuansi in advance; otherwise, Yuansi would not know how to deal with Tongya."

Xiao Chuting shook his head and said softly, "Li Tongya is not foolish. The Li Family seeks an alliance, not subservience. Guiluan is sharp and intelligent, which is why she has this opportunity."

Xiao Yuansi, being straightforward and sincere, felt uneasy discussing these matters that stripped away the veneer of friendship. Thus, he remained silent. Xiao Chuting did the same, holding his white jade fishing rod silently.

For a moment, only the sound of the mountain wind howling through the trees was heard, causing Xiao Yuansi's beard and hair to flutter.

Meanwhile, as Li Tongya descended the mountain, he saw two figures waiting at its foot. One wore a brown bamboo hat and had a short, neatly trimmed beard, with long eyebrows reaching his temples. He held a knife in his hand and had a sharp look in his eyes. He was at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Upon seeing Li Tongya, he cupped his fists and said in a deep voice, "Greetings, fellow Daoist Tongya."

The other had white hair and a youthful face with a flowing beard, his eyes bright and penetrating. He cupped his fists in greeting as well and laughed lightly before introducing himself.

"I am Nanshan Weng[1]... Greetings, Fellow Daoist."

Li Tongya cupped his fists hurriedly in return. The swordsman nodded and said in a deep voice, "I am Chen Taojing."

These two were, of course, the people Xiao Chuting had sent to deal with Yu Yufeng. After exchanging a few words with them, Li Tongya saw Xiao Chuchou approaching from afar on the wind, smiling.

"Thank you for waiting."

The others quickly responded, expressing how it was no bother at all.

Xiao Chuchou pointed to the swordsman, Chen Taojing, and introduced him, "This is Chen Taojing, who was once a guest cultivator at Moongaze Lake market. After the market was destroyed, he settled with my family. He practices the River One Qi Technique and has established the Boundless Ocean... just like Brother Tongya."

Li Tongya nodded immediately, and the swordsman's eyes lit up. The two cupped their fists, and Li Tongya said with a smile, "I will need to seek much advice from you, Senior."

"We can learn from each other," the swordsman responded politely.

Xiao Chuchou then pointed to Nanshan Weng and introduced, "Nanshan Weng is an elder in our family."

With one at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm and two at the mid-stage, this was the force the Xiao Family had mobilized. Xiao Chuchou then introduced Li Tongya to the two, and with that, they all took to the wind and headed west.

1. Nanshan Weng actually means "Man from the southern mountain". So that guy is actually using a code name. ☜

After seeing off Tian Youdao, Tian Zhongqing tidied up the room right away. Not daring to waste any time at all, he made his way west toward Lijing Town hurriedly. With the dazzling morning sun slowly rising, he was bathed in the brilliant golden light. An image of Xu Gongming suddenly popped into his mind.

"I have the guidance of my elder and must still rush about... Who knows if I can avert disaster? Brother Gongming is all alone, how will he manage?"

A faint sense of guilt mixed with deep relief surged within Tian Zhongqing, creating a complex blend of emotions in his heart. This mixture of worry and conflicting feelings made the otherwise tedious journey pass quickly.

Between Lijing Town and the various towns of Huaqian lay Lidaokou Village, the original dirt road had been replaced by a beautifully paved stone path. Lidaokou Village was also home to a family from Moongaze Lake surnamed Xu, who later moved to Lijing Town.

Known for keeping a low profile, it was said that the ancestors of these families were refugees skilled in business dealings, and several of their descendants had even managed affairs with Mount Yue. Tian Zhongqing had never been to this place, so he just glanced around and continued west.

It was still early and Lijing Town was just waking up in the morning mist, with smoke rising from every household. Tian Zhongqing headed straight to the foot of Mount Lijing and spoke directly to the two clan guards stationed there.

"Please deliver this letter to my cousin."

The guards took a good look at him and recognized Tian Zhongqing right away, knowing that his cousin was Li Jingtian. They quickly nodded and took the letter, and soon, a message came down in response. They then collected Tian Zhongqing's storage pouch and dharma artifacts before leading him up the mountain.

Tian Zhongqing entered the mountain, walking along a small path for a while until he saw a small courtyard appear before him. He entered the courtyard respectfully, where there was only a small desk by the window where a woman in a palace dress, with a jade hairpin and a gentle demeanor, was seated. Beside her kneeled a young girl who stared at him curiously.

"Zhongqing greets elder sister!" Tian Zhongqing called out respectfully.

Li Jingtian, however, merely held the letter in her hand and said calmly, "Uncle sent you here. Is there something you need to ask?"

Tian Zhongqing was about to speak, but Li Jingtian waved her hand to interrupt him, gently patting Li Qingxiao's head and sending her off to study. Only then did she focus her attention on listening to Tian Zhongqing's explanation.

Raising her eyebrows slightly, she felt a mix of exasperation and amusement as she set down her tea bowl and criticized harshly, "How could you be this foolish!"

Li Jingtian frowned slightly. Though her temperament was gentle, she had a dignified presence when serious, startling Tian Zhongqing into a tirade of repetitive apologies.

"Indeed, I was foolish! I was foolish!"

Li Jingtian paused and then advised, "If you fear trouble, relinquish your position and take some of our clan's allied cultivators to Mount Yue to cultivate spirit fields."

Tian Zhongqing nodded repeatedly but hesitated before asking quietly, "When can I return...?"

Li Jingtian pondered for a moment and replied, "Focus on your cultivation. If all goes well, someone from our family will be sent to the Eastern Mount Yue to guard and establish a foothold. Your days may not be so difficult, but as for when you can return, that is not something I can predict."

Tian Zhongqing nodded continuously, seeing that Li Jingtian remained silent. Not daring to say more, he expressed his thanks and quickly left.

As Tian Zhongqing departed, the courtyard was left with only a gentle breeze. Li Jingtian waited quietly at the desk for a while, and soon enough, there was a knock on the door. She smiled warmly.

"Come in."

A young man wearing a black robe and matching black boots adorned with silver patterns stepped inside. He cupped his fists lightly and said with a soft laugh, "Auntie, what did you tell him?"

Li Jingtian smiled softly and replied, "I told him to go to Mount Yue."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, a hint of a smile appearing on his face as he said quietly, "Previously, people despised Mount Yue for its poverty and the fact that it was inhabited by uncivilized men with disheveled hair and tattoos... No one even wanted to go there to plant Spirit Paddies. Now, they have come knocking by themselves!"

Li Jingtian nodded silently and said softly, "They would rather engage in cockfighting and dog racing in the town than go to Mount Yue to manage spirit fields... This is the nature of these cultivators. In contrast, the impoverished cultivators of the Embryonic Breathing Realm work tirelessly, taking on multiple jobs just to earn a few more jin of Spirit Paddies."

"It is indeed human nature..." Li Yuanjiao said, laughing heartily before adding, "The influential families live without worries, provided for by their elders. Besides their daily cultivation, they naturally indulge in entertainment. This Tian Zhongqing is actually one of the better ones...

"Most cultivators of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, knowing they have no hope of breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, start to behave recklessly, indulging themselves in pleasures and vices, making them an annoyance to others. With this excuse, we can send the Tian Family's allied cultivators to Mount Yue to farm, preventing them from causing trouble under the pretense of residual favors."

Li Jingtian poured tea for Li Yuanjiao, startling the young man into repeatedly expressing his unworthiness. Li Jingtian then smiled and said, "My uncle Tian Youdao is loyal, but over the years, the Tian Family has grown increasingly arrogant, relying on his and my mother's past favors. They have taken in several Mount Yue cultivators and have become somewhat overconfident... This matter serves as a good warning to several families."

Li Jingtian's words were partly to absolve Tian Youdao, and Li Yuanjiao understood this clearly. He nodded, saying, "Granduncle and father have both noticed this, which is why they gave him the pill to help him break through. However, the Tian Family's ethos is not right. Even without Tian Zhongqing's incident, there would still be something to hold against them."

The two talked for a while before Li Yuanjiao asked, "How is Qingxiao doing now? Is she studying and practicing calligraphy?"

Li Jingtian replied softly, "Of course, she is studying and practicing calligraphy diligently. But... if she does not have a spiritual orifice, learning will not be of much use."

Li Yuanjiao fell silent as he heard this, picking up the tea bowl from the table and taking a small sip. He then said in a low voice, "Uncle Donghe is talented; Qingxiao will surely be fine."

Despite his reassuring words, Li Yuanjiao was anxious. The Li Family originally had no spiritual orifices, and Li Xiangping could cultivate only because he used a talisman seed. Besides, Li Jingtian also lacked a spiritual orifice. Whether Li Qingxiao possessed one was truly uncertain and unknown.

It was known that at that time, Li Xuanxuan had already reached the fourth or fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. The brothers Li Yuanxiu and Li Yuanjiao, one of whom had a mother with a spiritual orifice at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm and the other with the noble bloodline of the Mulu Clan, both had spiritual orifices.

However, even though Li Xuanling and his wife were both cultivators, they still gave birth to Li Yuanyun, who lacked a spiritual orifice. Clearly, the intricacies of this matter were indeed complex and difficult to predict.
