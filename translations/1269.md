# Chapter 1269: A Stalemate

Concealing herself with a Spiritual Treasure, Li Que'wan rode a heavy beam of Supreme Yin light eastward, soon spotting a torrent of multicolored light surging skyward like fire, sending sand and stones flying across a plain that was erupting with faint flames.

She stopped cautiously and saw a man sitting within the multicolored light.

The man was tall and thin, his hands pressed together and his eyes tightly shut. He held a candle lamp and did not utter a word, yet a fervent, bright radiance shone from him, making the entire plain glitter.

‘A Sixth-Generation Maha!’

Li Que'wan's heart trembled.

‘The Buddhist cultivators truly have deep reserves…’

In this era, a Sixth-Generation Maha was only a step below a Great Daoist Master; they could even contest the divine abilities of a Cold Qi cultivator like Tianwan. Zanmen had only just seen two retreat, yet here was another one!

‘And from the looks of it… his aura is overwhelmingly powerful!’

Beneath the suppression of his candle lamp stood an immortal cultivator. This person's divine ability was immense as he stood upon a light of pure yin, and though Li Que'wan did not recognize him by name, she could tell he was from the Tao family.

Below this Maha was another Buddhist cultivator with an enormous belly and a compassionate face. He sat upon a vast lotus platform, followed by two imposing, yaksha-like golden figures wielding halberds.

‘The Way of Compassion…’

It was Li Que'wan's first time seeing someone from the Way of Compassion, and she had a vague feeling there was more to his belly than met the eye. She frowned ceaselessly, sighing to herself:

‘He only seems to be a Fourth-Generation… yet he has an unfathomable air about him. It is often said that the Way of Compassion has the most profound methods among the modern Buddhists, and that their system is even more complete than the others. It seems to be true…’

This Maha was indeed suppressing Lin Chensheng of the Great Xiukui Monastery completely. Fortunately, a Supreme Yang Spiritual Treasure was providing relief, and second, the Maha himself had no true killing intent, which was why the situation had dragged into a stable stalemate.

Cheng Qian, however, was faring much worse. The Whole Pill cultivator was truly unskilled in combat, trading blows back and forth with two of the Merciful Ones—and they were merely at the Developing Wisdom seat!

The situation was quite stable, however, so she set her mind at ease and drew closer. Finally, she saw the flames that filled the Prefecture, where an immortal mountain had collapsed into ruins, revealing dense, bright silver formation patterns.

‘The Yu Clan's grand formation is broken after all!’

The flames covering the mountain were indistinct in shape and color, seeming both present and absent. They were the handiwork of the Way of Compassion, constantly interfering with the spiritual qi and the earth veins, yet leaving the mountain's vegetation completely unharmed. Li Que'wan peered at it, her curiosity piqued.

“How rare, it is actually the Exalted Purity Molten Flame.”

This flame was harmless to physical objects, yet it could disrupt spiritual qi, nullify spell arts, and indirectly influence the Great Void. However, while it affected the Great Void, it could not isolate it completely like the Immeasurable Water and Fire, which prevented enemies from escaping. Instead, it interfered with opponents through subtle, flickering changes in the spiritual qi, its strength lying in its vast range and excellent effectiveness.

This flame had little reputation nowadays, but Li Que'wan was able to recognize it because it had been utterly infamous in ancient times!

What all cultivators in the world sought was nothing more than divine abilities. Those who sought such abilities had to push their Shengyang Acupoint into the Great Void and were extremely wary of fluctuations in the Great Void and spiritual qi. Those with the means would often hide within a Purple Mansion Realm's grand formation.

A Purple Mansion Realm's grand formation could sever the Great Void, ensuring the space within was not connected to the space outside. This not only guaranteed that a cultivator could touch the Great Void to achieve a breakthrough but also protected them from external interference to the greatest extent… but this protection had its limits.

Once a grand formation was attacked, it would cause instability in the Great Void within, to say nothing of the formation shattering… Jia Zan had surrendered to Li Zhouwei because of this very concern.

But there were also special treasures, like the water and fire of True Qi, that could sever the Great Void. Just a single touch upon a grand formation could greatly affect those within. Back then, Chen Xuanyu of the Chen Clan had been killed by the Sun Clan using the Unfathomable Water and Fire!

The Exalted Purity Molten Flame belonged to a class of extremely high-grade Molten Fire, corresponding to Valley Water; it was a fire of concealment and interiority. Its range was also extremely vast. When it came crashing down, it could pass through a grand formation to directly affect the Great Void inside!

Often, when a cultivator wielded this flame in battle, there would be few casualties, but a year or so later, someone near the battlefield would inevitably perish from a failed breakthrough, making it naturally despised by all…

Upon seeing this flame, Li Que'wan already understood.

‘The Buddhist cultivators who came here must have known about the Yu Clan's mystic realm. They are continuously influencing the fluctuations in the Great Void, using the broken formation as an opportunity to try and force the mystic realm to reveal itself!’

Thus, she circulated her spell arts and noticed a faint stirring within the fluctuating Great Void. She casually plucked a thread of qi and made a quick calculation; there was indeed something there, so she focused her spirit and condensed her qi.

Spirit Probe!

The Yu Clan's mystic realm was undefended, merely obscured by the candlelight filling the sky. How could it withstand the Spirit Probe? Li Que'wan's vision immediately slipped through the entrance, where she indeed saw an immortal garden of medicinal herbs, vibrant with life, its formations shimmering. Two monks were smashing halls and toppling pavilions, their eyes red as they madly snatched everything in sight.

She laughed inwardly.

‘Well now, there really are two fat rats in here!’

But it was not the two Buddhist cultivators who captured her attention, but the scenery within!

The many immortal platforms and pavilions had clearly been built by the Yu Clan themselves, but the great hall suspended high above was of a completely different style. It was the color of Profound Yellow Qi, roiling with an unceasing surge of Profound Qi.

This combination of Profound Yellow Qi and Profound Qi was unique in the world. Adding to that the fact that the Yu Clan themselves could not control the mystic realm, Li Que'wan had already guessed the truth of the matter:

‘This thing… it was seized when the Great Liang fell, wasn't it…’

As Li Que'wan observed in silence, the clash of divine abilities in the sky grew increasingly fierce, the sound shaking the heavens. The monk clutching his belly, however, just chuckled and said,

“Fellow Daoist Tao, what remarkable skill!”

Tao Shidao impassively swept his gaze over the bronze lamp in the sky. Following his senses, the Spiritual Treasure struggled continuously, causing the scripture chants from Mingzang's lips to accelerate. Tao Shidao paid it no mind and said flatly,

“Beimei, if you do not retreat now, I fear there will be trouble.”

Beimei's smile was warm and friendly, and the prayer beads in his hand spun a fraction faster.

The great battle in Ruzhou was different from those in the past. Be it Tao Shidao or Yang Xuancai, who was injured and had retreated back into her formation, both were fundamentally northern cultivators. They even knew each other by reputation…

Only the Tao Clan had never associated with Buddhist cultivators, so they could be considered strangers, otherwise calling each other 'Fellow Daoist' a few times would not have been out of place!

This made Beimei turn his face slightly, noticing that Mingzang in the sky still had his hands pressed together, doing nothing but releasing candlelight to suppress Tao Shidao's Spiritual Treasure, looking as if he were facing a great enemy.

‘It won't be long now…’

Beimei and Mingzang naturally knew about the Yu Clan's mystic realm. Mingzang was quietly suppressing the Lacquer Cloud Branch, its candlelight flickering to block Tao Shidao's perception of the surroundings, while the two Merciful Ones under his, Beimei's, command had already snuck into the Yu Clan's Hall of Assisting Providence!

In Beimei's view, this was the reason he was fighting with all his might while Mingzang sat on high—there was no need to excessively bully and offend the Tao and Li Clans. Wouldn't it be the best of both worlds to just seize the Yu Clan's resources and leave?

But his smile had yet to last long when the candlelight in Mingzang's hand began to flicker uneasily. The monk's expression changed slightly, and he said,

“Leave.”

Beimei was stunned. The monk before him had already vanished abruptly, and the bronze lamp slowly faded as a speck of gray light finally blossomed in the sky.

It was a slender branch, the length of a forearm and crafted as if from white jade, on the verge of breaking free from its restraints!

‘You!’

Beimei had thought he and Mingzang had some tacit understanding, that they could just divide the spoils after the fight. He never expected that Mingzang, a dignified Sixth-Generation Maha, would have no intention of staying at all, fleeing faster than anyone!

How could Beimei not be frantic? He cursed inwardly as if his tail had been stepped on:

‘What Taixi said was right. This Lotus Temple… is truly full of beasts!’

But if he were to turn and flee now, wouldn't he lose both the lady and the soldiers? He was extremely decisive. The yaksha-like golden figure behind him strode forward, smashed toward Lin Chensheng, and violently self-detonated!

Thus, while issuing a warning with Buddhist light, he took a deep breath and forcefully exhaled, spewing forth a sky-blotting torrent of multicolored light!

The Way of Compassion did have some tricks up its sleeve. For a moment, the sky was filled with color, as if countless Arhats stood in the heavens, golden dragons coiled, and rainbow phoenixes danced. It actually managed to suppress the small branch for a moment, while he took a step forward, approaching the ruins of the Yu Clan's formation, a sheet of multicolored light extending out!

‘I only need one breath!’

But a sliver of silver light suddenly appeared in his pupils.

A woman had appeared in the Great Void at some unknown time. She sat sideways on a mystic tiger, a charming smile on her face, her hands clasped before her chest, perfectly still. The surging multicolored light drew near her, only to be blocked by flashing lightning, held firmly at bay.

And behind her floated an azure cauldron, firmly sealing the exit of the mystic realm!

“Insolence!”

Beimei’s eyes looked ready to split as he cursed,

“Bitch!”

A wind suddenly rose between heaven and earth.

The multicolored light that stretched to the horizon responded continuously, bringing with it a heavy warning. A speck of gold had already appeared on the horizon!

‘Why so fast!’

His anger had not yet dissipated, but his heart was already pounding like thunder.

‘Mingzang's Bright-Flame Sabre perception has an extremely wide range, how could it only react when they are right on top of us!’

Cold sweat instantly beaded on his forehead, but the golden light before him would not give him time to react. Beimei knew full well how Vast Cicada had died!

‘How can I possibly defend myself when I am here alone?’

Although that golden light was still some distance away, the range of Li Zhouwei's Crimson Severing Arrowhead was also not to be underestimated. Furthermore, who knew how many people had come. With a tiger in front and a wolf behind, by the time the sky dimmed and the evening sun rose, he, Beimei, could go down and share a drink with Vast Cicada!

The death of Vast Cicada, who possessed a Golden Land, had been too great a shock. For these Buddhist cultivators, it far surpassed the death of Qi Lanyan. In that instant, reason finally took hold. The Buddhist Land that filled the sky shattered with a boom, and this Maha decisively sacrificed his pawns to save his king, vanishing into the distance in a flash!

By now, Tao Shidao had already emerged from the shattered golden light and sent a sword strike after him from afar. With only the sound of shattering glaze, the multicolored light offered no resistance as its owner fled, wounded.

Li Que'wan paid him no mind either. The azure cauldron behind her had been pushed back several dozen feet, and two golden figures leaped out. Both had round bellies and furious, glaring eyes. They started toward Beimei while simultaneously preparing to end their own lives, their terrified gazes turning to confusion the moment they landed on Li Que'wan.

‘Just one early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?’

Worse still, the Exalted Purity Molten Flame burning fiercely all over the mountains chose this moment to slightly interfere with their connection to the Great Void. The two factors combined caused them to pause for a fraction of a second.

That pause, however, was enough.

Li Que'wan gave a deep bow and said with a smile,

“Greetings, King Wei!”

The two monks' faces stiffened. Only then did they realize their connection to the Great Void had been completely severed. An inexplicable, bone-deep chill crept up their backs.

A youth with golden eyes stood silently behind them.

Li Zhouwei's reputation in the north had always been considerable, especially now. His reputation among Buddhist cultivators was even greater. The two had naturally discussed him, but they never would have imagined that this King Wei would one day be standing so silently, so terrifyingly, right behind them.

“Thud!”

The one on the left was only at the Bodhisattva seat, while the other was merely at the Developing Wisdom seat. It was clear Beimei had long been prepared to abandon them. They dropped to their knees, their faces ashen, and trembled as they said:

“Lianfu greets King Wei.”

Li Zhouwei, however, was looking at the blazing flames all around, and said,

“The Lotus Temple has some skill.”

Tao Shidao also descended on a beam of light and said solemnly:

“Greetings, King Wei!”

Li Zhouwei nodded to him, swept his gaze over the two monks, and said,

“Take out the items.”

The two complied obsequiously. One began to pry open his jaw, the other to pull at his tongue. In an instant, a cascade of golden sand poured out, intermixed with jade and azure boxes, their treasure light dazzling. Cheng Qian, who had just arrived, was dumbfounded. Lin Chensheng shook his head slightly. Even someone of Tao Shidao's background felt his eyelids twitch.

How could such great immortal merits be passed up? Once the two had finished disgorging the items, Li Zhouwei had already drawn his royal battle-axe. With a swing, multicolored light shot into the sky, glaze shattered, and a shower of blossoms filled the air.

Li Que'wan, with a wave of her sleeve, caused the numerous spiritual items to leap from the golden sand and arrange themselves neatly. She said softly,

“This mystic realm…”

Li Zhouwei did not spare it a second glance. He let out a slow breath and said with inexplicable meaning,

“There is no need to touch the things inside.”

Only then did a gentle azure breeze arrive. A beautiful woman approached with a smile, performed a curtsy, and said in a soft voice,

“Greetings, King Wei!”

Yang Xuancai's injuries had not been light, but she cultivated in Horn Wood and was extremely skilled at healing. Her complexion was already rosy again, and she looked at Li Zhouwei with a piercing gaze.

To put it bluntly, the desire of her Yang Clan for Li Zhouwei to remain for a long time was no less than that of Yinling; it might even surpass the Tao family's!

The reason was simple. The Yu Clan seemed to have quieted down for now, but the fundamental problem had not been solved. Once Li Zhouwei left, no one would be able to suppress Yu Xi, and there was no telling what might happen!

She stared at Li Zhouwei with hopeful eyes, but King Wei merely glanced at the wreckage-strewn land of Ruzhou and, as if sensing something, raised his head to look south.

He saw a streak of flowing rainbow, its colors flashing, its azure light like a waterfall. A person was actually riding the wind, coming from the south!

This person had a long beard and a pale face, with a rather fine figure and a smile on his face. It just seemed he had arrived in a hurry and had sustained some injuries. His body was shrouded in a haze of divine ability. Upon drawing near, he gave a slight bow and said,

“Greetings, King Wei!”

Then he turned, scanned the surroundings, and continued,

“Qinghu of the Great Song, I greet all my fellow Daoists!”

This person was none other than Sima Yuanli.

This Daoist Master had unexpectedly been stuck on a single divine ability for many years, and his cultivation and injuries had fluctuated repeatedly. Now, however, he seemed to have calmed his heart. Although he was injured, one could see that his divine ability was stable, complete, and gentle. He had clearly been recuperating for some time and had not rushed to attempt another breakthrough.

At this moment, he arrived surrounded by a halo of azure light, appearing very solemn and serious as he said formally,

“The Grand General saw that Ruzhou was in peril and knew the situation was dire. However, the fighting in the east is extremely intense, and he truly could not spare anyone, so he had no choice but to send me. I never expected to be a step behind King Wei!”

When Li Zhouwei saw him, he smiled and said,

“Not slow at all, you've come at the perfect time!”

Although Luoxia could not be considered completely defenseless at the moment, it was ultimately lacking in divine ability users, forcing Li Zhouwei to rush for reinforcements everywhere. Sima Yuanli's divine abilities were not particularly brilliant, but he possessed many treasures and was extremely useful!

His mood improved considerably, and he simply said,

“Since that is the case, Qinghu, you can stand guard here. Jingzhao, Cheng Qian, you two will go with Kuang Hong to Liangchuan. This will shore up the defenses on all four sides.”

Li Que'wan, not hearing any arrangements for herself, looked up slightly, only to see the King of Wei say softly,

“Que'wan, you will go to Xiangxiang and quietly await the celestial phenomena.”
