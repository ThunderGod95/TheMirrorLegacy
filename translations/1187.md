# Chapter 1187: Dongjun

‘He once made the former sovereign of Penglai quake; He later made the sun and moon abandon the heavens.’

The fourteen words were spoken plainly, yet they left Tang Xie standing dumbstruck. The thoughts in his mind roared like thunder, grinding every stray notion to dust and leaving his mind a vacant, humming void.

‘Penglai… That’s the sect of Immortal Lord Chufu, a cultivator from Beyond the Profound. "The former sovereign" must be him… The host of this place is, at a minimum, equal to an Immortal Lord in divine ability…’

That first line was astonishing enough, but the second was even more horrifying.

‘The sun and moon abandon the heavens…’

‘His family… has an Immortal Lord who commands the sun and moon!’

Forget commanding both; individuals who could command either the Supreme Yin or the Supreme Yang alone were exceedingly rare in the river of history, to say nothing of one who had reached the level of an Immortal Lord!

‘But he didn’t say a patriarch of his tradition… he said… the host?’

The difference between the two was as vast as heaven and earth.

Most of the major Daoist Traditions prevalent in the world today could trace their lineage back to the Three Profoundities. Even those that couldn't were at least descended from some great devil or Buddhist patriarch. Back in its prime, his Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition had never been afraid to put on airs. If anyone dared to question their standing, they had a ready answer:

‘We serve the Profound Court’s First Earth above, and bestow a thousand hundred immortals upon the world below!’

But that prestige relied entirely on the patriarch of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition! With Xu Xiang’s passing, the tradition had fallen into decline. He, Tang Xie, could barely be considered its master… To put it bluntly, the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition couldn’t even grasp at a Golden Rank these days!

‘An Immortal Lord who hasn’t passed from the world… who controls the sun and moon… How is that possible?’

The two conditions combined completely overwhelmed Tang Xie’s ability to reason. According to his own Dao-Profundity, such a situation was absolutely impossible. And yet, the proof was laid bare before him—who else could have the power to pull him into another grotto-heaven across the boundaries of rank, without a single soul noticing?

_Clack._

The crisp sound of silver boots on the jade bridge startled Tang Xie from his stupor. He raised his head to see endless pavilions and galleries, and a palace of the sun that glittered more brilliantly than gold. Gazing at the vast sky on the other side of the bridge, a vista so magnificent it seemed like another world, a sliver of doubt finally entered his mind.

‘Is any of this real?’

The question lingered for a fleeting moment before he cast it aside.

There was no other explanation. Even if he dismissed the casual display of power—plucking him from one plane of existence to another—as an illusion… no matter how far he had fallen, he, Tang Xie, was still a being who had once wielded the authority of a True Monarch. Even with his five elements scattered, his soul had attained the purity of an immortal and the status of a True Monarch. The only being capable of deceiving his senses would have to be an Immortal Lord.

By the time he set foot on the overlapping white jade stairs and saw his reflection in a pool that shimmered like the bright moon, Tang Xie finally accepted the truth.

‘There is only one possibility…’

‘Some great personage announced their departure from the mortal world, yielding their venerable position to a successor, but in reality, they never left for the heavens beyond. Instead, they have been cultivating in this incomparably vast grotto-heaven all along!’

‘Who could it be?’

As far as Tang Xie knew, the Immortal Lord of Penglai had left the mortal world in an extremely ancient era. If this Immortal Lord had dealings with him, their age must be close to that of the original Three Profoundities or the three generations that followed. The most likely candidate was one from the Azure Profoundity, a tradition that had commanded the sun, moon, yin, and yang since time immemorial.

‘Could it be… Profound Monarch Changtang?’

Among the lineages of the Azure Profoundity, this Profound Monarch had inherited the Dao of the Supreme Yin and later attained the title of Immortal Lord. This seemed to match both the ethereal Dao of Supreme Yin and the transcendent power on display…

But this thought only made Tang Xie more conflicted.

‘Though Immortal Lord Changtang cultivates the Supreme Yin, he was never secretive about his name. His Daoist tradition has many branches in the world, from the Han Family of Chang Prefecture and the various Supreme Yin Pavilions on the lake, down to the Nine Mounds… I hear his followers in the mortal realm are numerous!’

What felt even more wrong was that Profound Monarch Changtang’s divine abilities had only advanced dramatically in a later era. He was a famously humble and low-key figure. During primordial times, he simply lacked the strength and motivation to contend with a great power like Chufu! Even when others praised him as having the substance of an Immortal Lord, he refused the title.

Though Tang Xie had missed the major historical shifts while sequestered in his grotto-heaven, he was deeply familiar with the era of his birth. And because he was an ancient himself, he knew even more about the ages that preceded it. In a mere moment, several candidates had already flashed through his mind.

Zhengao, having pushed the puzzle onto him, calmly sat down, dismissed the immortal soldiers at his side, and began to pour tea.

The light of the Supreme Yin, as clear as water, flowed into the cup, releasing waves of osmanthus fragrance. The immortal general smiled.

"The heavens have been sealed for a thousand years. I have nothing fresh on hand. Please make do, Daoist friend."

Tang Xie watched, wide-eyed, as the light of the Supreme Yin coalesced in the cup. The thread of logic he had just managed to grasp was shattered once again. He hastily accepted the cup, studied it closely, and said in horror, "What are you saying!"

Forget the thousand years he had been trapped; even back in the days when he followed his True Monarch disciple-brother to vanquish demons, he had never heard of drinking spiritual treasures of the Supreme Yin as if they were mere tea!

‘Extravagant… Far too extravagant… This absolutely cannot be the Changtang Daoist tradition! But it can’t be the Supreme Yang, can it? Don’t the legends say an Yingze appeared, who now holds the Supreme Yang Fruition Attainment?’

Lu Jiangxian, controlling Zhengao’s Dharma Body, said nothing and drank his tea in silence.

Although the other party's soul possessed a status too high to be casually analyzed, his True Spirit had already been recorded on the Name Ascending Stone. Listening to his innermost thoughts was still possible. He allowed the man's thoughts to run wild, refusing to say another word.

The cup of tea, however, only strengthened Tang Xie’s conviction. After a moment of deliberation, he spoke cautiously,

"I never knew the great personage in the heavens was such a major figure. Dwelling within yin and yang… Observing this immortal palace, I presume the Supreme Yin holds the primary position here…"

The question was incredibly clever. Few beings commanded both the sun and moon, but it was possible an Immortal Lord secretly held an Auxiliary Position that Tang Xie was unaware of. However, one could ultimately only occupy either the Supreme Yin or the Supreme Yang. If he could determine the Fruition Attainment, he could almost certainly pin down the being's identity.

But the immortal general simply blinked his sharp eyes and shook his head.

"Now that the Profound Court is hidden, it is natural for the Supreme Yin to manifest while the Supreme Yang is sealed. The Supreme Yin holds the primary position. But when yin and yang invert and we break into the mortal world, the Supreme Yang will naturally take precedence!"

Throughout this entire ordeal, Tang Xie’s worldview as an immortal had been shattered time and again. The mysteries piled one on top of another. But this last sentence sent a chill through his entire body, starting from the base of his spine and freezing him to the crown of his head.

‘What does that mean?’

‘Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang… He wants them both? It can’t possibly be that two Immortal Lords are residing in this place!’

His single copper-colored eye stared blankly at the immortal general before him. A new possibility suddenly erupted in his mind.

‘He’s saying this Immortal Lord resided in the Supreme Yang when he manifested in the world, but has now moved his residence to the Supreme Yin…’

This brought a sudden flash of insight.

‘Which means he yielded his former position as lord of the Supreme Yang, which is why the later Yingze could rise. Ultimately, he was still the master of the Supreme Yang in ancient times.’

Even among the direct disciples of the Three Profoundities, those who could be called Immortal Lord were few. For one to also reside in the Supreme Yang, the conditions were incredibly stringent. Tang Xie knew of only one. Combining that with the magnificent scale of these palaces and the awe-inspiring yet restrained demeanor of his host, Tang Xie found the possibility instantly taking root in his mind.

‘That most terrifying, most tyrannical, four-in-one monarch, the lord of the Azure Profoundity’s sun… the second disciple of the Azure Profoundity Master.’

‘The one known in the Profound Tradition as the "Great Sun, Clear Orthodoxy, Radiant and Flourishing Supreme Yang Profound Monarch"; in the Daoist Tradition as the "Sun Palace Supreme Yang True Monarch"; and in the Divine Tradition as the "Profound Aegis of All Flourishing Divine Monarch"—the Profound-Divine, Origin-Truth, Purple-Radiance Immortal Lord!’

‘It can only be Him! It can only be Him… The Heavenly Wolf was executed, and two generations of Great Sages were so terrified they paid homage to the Supreme Yang. It’s entirely possible He was the one who struck Penglai until it quaked. For Him, making the sun and moon abandon the heavens would be perfectly normal!’

Tang Xie held the cup, stunned, a phantom flame rolling in his throat. It felt like a dream. He swallowed the tea with difficulty, utterly at a loss for words.

This figure’s influence on the entire Dao of the Supreme Yang, and even on the principles of fire and yin-yang, was simply too immense. Having cultivated a supreme immortal art, his name was no longer recorded in modern Daoist texts. Yet any slightly more ancient text discussing the five elements and yin-yang would inevitably mention him, using a single title as a substitute.

‘Dongjun.’

The names of True Monarchs and Divine Monarchs were often long and convoluted. But when a being was represented by just two characters, it usually signified a terrifyingly condensed form of influence—his impact on the Three Realms was so vast that even after he cultivated a supreme art that erased his name, people still couldn't speak of these concepts without referring to him. So, they used those two words instead.

‘Even if Patriarch Xu Xiang himself were here, he would have to address him as Senior…’

This wasn't humility on his part; it was almost a boast. Forget the ancient immortal Xu Xiang, even if the first disciple of Comprehending Profoundity encountered Him, he still wouldn't be able to take the seat of honor. One was of the ‘Supreme Yang’, the other of the ‘Lesser Yang’. The hierarchy was innate.

This shockwave of realization washed away the sorrow and pain he felt over the fall of Myriad-Prosperity Heaven. The Dao Rector sat there in a daze, his myriad thoughts a tangled mess. A new question popped into his head.

‘Does the one on the Heavenly Glow know?’

The thought made him want to laugh.

‘The Three Profoundities under one roof… If he came here, he would probably have to address Him as "Your Excellency" as well. This great personage must have entered the Supreme Yin for secluded cultivation, to no longer meddle in worldly affairs. Otherwise… given the temperament of this Supreme Yang Immortal Lord…’

As his mind raced, Zhengao kept his gaze lowered, sipping his tea. The shock in his own heart was no less than Tang Xie’s.

‘To think that the Azure Profoundity lineage had such a figure…’

The most detailed and highest-status individual Lu Jiangxian had heard of before was Immortal Lord Qingyi of Encompassing Profoundity. The My Dao's Heaven-Governing Celestial Gate was already the pinnacle a minor cultivator could ever hope to glimpse. He never imagined that the Azure Profoundity, famous for its reclusive ways, would have such an anomaly!

‘Divine Monarch, Profound Monarch, True Monarch… these titles are indeed vastly different. Not only do they correspond to different domains, but a single immortal cultivator can actually unite all three within themselves…’

‘His divine abilities probably point directly to the true essence of the Supreme Yang itself!’

‘No wonder he could make a Great Sage retreat. No wonder Tang Xie claims the Yuyi Immortals wouldn't trade their position for even an Auxiliary Position… To hold the authority of the Supreme Yang under such a being, to guard the court of Dongjun, would command the utmost respect even from visiting True Monarchs.’

While Tang Xie was lost in the giddy thrill of discovering such a monumental secret, Zhengao was also processing the new information. The silence had stretched long enough. He finally spoke, his tone tinged with regret.

"The heavens have long been absent from the world. I myself only manifested from the Supreme Yin in recent years to take charge of this manor. I have been overwhelmed with duties, but I never imagined that the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition of old would be reduced to… just you, Daoist friend!"

Having just witnessed the splendor of another’s domain, Tang Xie felt a mix of bitterness and sorrow when the focus returned to his own. He was silent for a long moment before gathering himself.

"My Dao has many inheritances; our situation is not so dire. In truth… it’s not just those of us in the grotto-heaven. And I… I can only be considered a guardian of an old immortal ritual ground!"

"When I was cultivating, Myriad-Prosperity Heaven was filled with treasures and immortals. The Dao Patriarch had achieved the Dao Embryo and his divine abilities were vast. We were at the height of our glory. I was one who cultivated honestly and kept to myself, but even I knew of the splendor of my disciple-brothers…"

A pained smile touched his lips.

"I was a man focused on cultivation. I failed to obtain an Auxiliary Position on my own, but I caught the eye of an immortal and was able to learn to be a 'false immortal.' Not only did I receive the Metallic Essence of the Treasured Earth, but the Dao Patriarch himself personally concealed an Auxiliary Position within my heart and lungs for seventy-one days to forge my spiritual status. This granted me seven hundred and ten extra years of life. Hidden beneath the Dao Embryo, I was even spared a few of the Three Calamities from the Heavenly Dao. My life was carefree and proud…"

"But for all its glory, the prosperity of my Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition was short-lived. In truth, Dao Patriarch Xu Xiang left the world very early on. Fearing the worst, I dared not leave the grotto-heaven. He returned the first three times, but on his final visit to Myriad-Prosperity Heaven, he gathered the disciples, singled me out, and gave me a secret command: ‘The Three Profoundities will inevitably fall to internal strife. You are to guard Myriad-Prosperity Heaven. Do not leave, even if the heavens collapse and the earth sinks. After a hundred thousand eons have passed, there will be a new dawn.’"

Zhengao, seated opposite him, refilled his tea, his eyes shining with greater intensity as he listened.

"At that time, Comprehending Profoundity was at its peak. The scriptures and cultivators of the Dao were all in Tongxuan Palace, with my Grand-Patriarch presiding. But he perished when his attempt to seek the Dao Embryo failed. I sensed that things were turning dire, so my disciple-brother and I immediately sealed the grotto-heaven and hid inside…"

His words were flat and dispassionate, but Lu Jiangxian, sensing his thoughts, saw a vision that made even him look twice.

Raging winds howled. The disciple-brother used his very life as fuel to shift the plane of their grotto-heaven. Meanwhile, Tang Xie stood before an empty immortal throne and, with his own hands, severed his head, seizing the moment to place it within the shifting dimension. That single phrase, 'hid inside,' concealed this brutal reality.

‘Truly, some suffering cannot be shared with outsiders…’

Zhengao seemed to momentarily freeze. Tang Xie sighed and continued.

"We still had contact with the outside at first. My fellow disciples were doing well in Tongxuan Palace, and there was a steady exchange of lore and talent. But later, several of them perished one by one while seeking the Dao. Tongxuan Palace was disbanded, and its many Daoist Traditions scattered. Suddenly, the connection between Myriad-Prosperity Heaven and the outside world was severed…"

Tang Xie paused, finding the next part difficult to say.

"I know very little of what happened after. We locked the grotto-heaven for over a thousand years straight to prevent its location from being lost. I heard that during that time, as dynasties rose and fell, a great personage emerged in accordance with fate, known as the She Immortal. He integrated the scattered traditions into something called… what was it… the Emperor Xuan Dao Palace."

"The She Immortal!"

This wasn't the first time Lu Jiangxian had heard the name. He'd first heard it from Chi Buzi; this was the paramount leader of the Immortal Dao who had toppled the Thunder Palace in ancient times.

Hearing the name, his interest was piqued. Tang Xie was not surprised. He said with shame, "There's no need for you to guess, Daoist friend. This Lord She Immortal originated from my Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition. He achieved perfection in his divine abilities and, with the support of the Treasured Earth, was reborn to cultivate 'Proclaimation Earth,' attaining the title 'Emperor Xuan of the Central Earth's Practical Works Divine Monarch'… and he overthrew the Thunder Palace!"

"So he was a figure from the Numinous Treasure tradition…"

Faced with Lu Jiangxian's praise, Tang Xie showed no joy, only a deepening shame.

"He was, after all, reincarnated to cultivate another Dao path. The Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition was merely one of many integrated into his Emperor Xuan Dao Palace. That palace replaced Tongxuan Palace and for a time became the supreme leader of the Immortal Dao in the world. But its glory was fleeting; it collapsed from the top down…"

"With that collapse, the orthodox Numinous Treasure tradition outside of Myriad-Prosperity Heaven was almost completely wiped out. Only a few branch lineages survived."

A look of understanding dawned in Zhengao's eyes.

"No wonder…"

No wonder Tang Xie had hidden in the grotto-heaven for so long. And no wonder he had rebuked Wang Ziya by saying they could "contribute another great figure to stir up the world"… It turned out that a hero from the Numinous Treasure tradition had played a major role in the great Sheji turmoil.

‘So he was a key figure in overthrowing the celestial order…’

As he pondered this, Tang Xie’s face was filled with sorrow.

"Although my Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition can't claim the nobility of the four great lineages of Comprehending Profoundity, we were still granted the patriarch’s portrait. To have fallen to this state… I am truly ashamed to face my ancestors!"

Lu Jiangxian listened to this tale with a measure of genuine sympathy.

"That’s not the way to put it," he said. "You were given a command by a great personage. That Myriad-Prosperity Heaven has been preserved to this day is already enough to earn his praise!"

Tang Xie shook his head repeatedly, refusing to accept the compliment.

"The Tang Xie of today is but this remnant body… just like the Spiritual Treasure tradition of today. We are both just barely surviving!"

Zhengao sat back, hands behind his back, and watched him with narrowed eyes.

‘He’s having ideas.’

It wasn't surprising. For Tang Xie, Xu Xiang’s plans had come to nothing. Myriad-Prosperity Heaven was now completely defenseless against the forces of the sun-and-moon grotto-heaven, represented by Zhengao. Tang Xie was currently weighing Zhengao’s intentions, how to preserve the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition, and—how to borrow their strength.

From Tang Xie’s perspective, the power Zhengao represented was indeed unfathomably high. But Tang Xie was not Chi Buzi, nor Dangjiang, nor the fabricated Shaohui. He had a background, a patron, and a worldview to match.

‘I pulled him into this grotto-heaven for no apparent reason. I need a justification.’

Tang Xie cared less for his own life than he did for the continuation of the Numinous Treasure tradition. If Zhengao couldn't produce a reasonable and gentle motive, the man would immediately become suspicious.

‘I still need to handle Tang Xie carefully. Not only is he a priceless trove of spiritual knowledge, but he is also of immense research value.’

‘And his soul is of a noble rank; my current divine abilities can hardly tamper with it. If anything happens here, Wang Ziya will surely notice quickly. The death of a high-ranking Spiritual Treasure cultivator of great seniority who was acting on an immortal's direct order is enough to alert a True Monarch of Comprehending Profoundity. While I don’t fear exposure, the situation could spiral out of control…’

At that same moment, the immortal general seated at the table spoke, laying out the excuse he had prepared long ago. His voice was low and resonant.

"The reason I sought you out today, Daoist friend, is twofold. First, we share certain old karmic connections and feel a sense of affinity. Second… there are other karmic threads that must be resolved."

As if waking from a dream, Tang Xie nodded repeatedly. His patriarch, Xu Xiang, had always been affable and had a wide circle of friends, with connections among the Three Profoundities, the four major Dao paths, and even those from Beyond the Profound. This was not unusual.

"Please speak, Your Excellency!" he said.

Zhengao’s gaze flickered.

He said softly, "There was once an immortal official in my heavens who descended to the mortal world. He endured many hardships and was wounded by the Bright Yang, which in turn helped him achieve his destiny… But the bonds of the mortal world are a tangled web. They pulled him down into the cycle of reincarnation, and he fell into the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition."

Upon hearing this, Tang Xie understood.

‘No wonder they came looking for me!’

He considered for a moment, then asked, "Qi Lanyan?"

"Correct."

Lu Jiangxian was aiming for this very person.

Qi Lanyan had consumed a top-tier profound medicine from ancient times, affording him the same treatment as a reincarnating direct disciple of Comprehending Profoundity. With the added blessing of the wood virtue falling to earth, his future achievements were bound to be significant.

Moreover, Qi Lanyan’s True Spirit was recorded on the Name Ascending Stone. His very life-mandate was in Lu Jiangxian’s hands. Best of all, he was about to reincarnate. During this process, Lu Jiangxian could secretly modify his entire background without leaving a trace or directly interfering with the present world.

‘It was a classic case of swapping the plum for the peach, of borrowing another’s hen to lay his own egg.’

‘He can be Qi Lanyan, or he can be Immortal General Qi, reincarnated with the secret treasures of my Supreme Yin Immortal Palace—who’s to say he’s not? He can very well "remember" his many experiences from before he was reincarnated as Qi Lanyan!’

The place he was reincarnating to was Myriad-Prosperity Heaven, the most secret sanctuary of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition. There, he could cultivate in peace and regain his power. With Tang Xie’s cooperation, this reincarnated body could develop without disturbing any of his current plans in the mortal world, yet it would become an excellent pawn whose strength would grow at a terrifying rate, ready to be activated at any time. For Qi Lanyan to seek the Dao, the Comprehending Profoundity tradition would offer little resistance; they might even help!

Such a high-return, low-risk opportunity was one Lu Jiangxian would naturally seize. It also served as the perfect, unimpeachable reason for a mighty Immortal Lord’s domain to approach Tang Xie for no apparent reason.

As expected, upon hearing his explanation, Tang Xie’s expression cleared with understanding. He nodded slowly.

"I see… I wonder, does your esteemed tradition have any arrangements for him?"

The immortal general rose and paced a few steps in the courtyard, a smile on his face.

"Naturally, it is for him to reclaim the Two Earths of Manifestation and Return!"

Even though Lu Jiangxian controlled the Supreme Yin, he had no intention of pushing this pawn toward the three yin paths. For one, the man did not possess a Talisman Seed, making it impossible for Lu Jiangxian to personally guide him; he could only be a pawn to be pushed at critical moments. For another, the Comprehending Profoundity tradition had already arranged his destiny. The Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition was best at cultivating the Two Earths of Manifestation and Return. Any Supreme Yin techniques, spiritual qi, or even motivation would be impossible to explain…

Meanwhile, thoughts surged like a thousand rolling thunderclaps in Lu Jiangxian’s mind.

‘And the She Immortal’s inheritance of Proclaimation Earth… I have a copy right here!’

Beneath the Xinyu Archipelago lay a Sheji inheritance that manifested the Two Earths of Manifestation and Return. Not only that, but the location also held a 'Proclaimation Earth' Metallic Essence!

In an instant, high up in the courtyard, amidst swirling wind and snow, a blank jade slip appeared in Lu Jiangxian’s palm. It was the Secret Manual of the Baixiang Peak Matron Monarch's Dao Manifestation.

‘The only pity is… this Qi Lanyan fellow ultimately lacks a bit of weight… Even if he cultivates again, with the support of the Qi family, Guanhua, and the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition, and even with this Metallic Essence and secret art, his chances of attaining a Fruition Attainment are slim. He would need immense luck to even seek an Auxiliary Position…’

But at this stage, Lu Jiangxian would not pass up any opportunity that might yield a True Monarch-level ally, especially a deal like Qi Lanyan, where he could swap one for another without expending his own resources.

‘In short, he is a long-term, hidden piece—a bit of icing on the cake, an asset for a rainy day. He might have other uses later on, but for now, he’s just an excuse to mobilize Tang Xie. By the time he reincarnates and has a chance to seek a Golden Rank, Li Zhouwei and Chi Buzi would have already succeeded if they were ever going to.’

‘When that time comes, even if he fails, getting a few portions of Metallic Essence back would be a good thing! …But if I end up losing everything and have to rely on him, it means I won't be far from just barely surviving myself.’
