# Chapter 1123: A Scheme for Change

A faint, watery light flickered across the collapsed stone wall. On the mural, the mottled, winding body of a giant serpent was visible, and the Great Daoist Master’s shadow danced lightly upon the wreckage.

The smile on Suiguan's face broadened.

Simultaneously, the entire Demon palace hidden within the reflection began to tremble. Gushing light from the Pristine Water surged from every stone crevice, slithering up the fallen pillars like countless green serpents.

These serpents intertwined, wings bursting from their backs. They took flight with a rustling hiss. The reflection of the entire sea trembled and roiled, colors bleeding into one another, threatening to breach the surface at any moment and drag the two Daoist Masters down into its depths.

Even more fatal was the haunting music that echoed through the reflection—a mournful, gurgling melody that tugged at the heart, its notes calling and responding.

Yet the two Daoist Masters on the sea's surface remained utterly oblivious.

A flicker of doubt crossed Suiguan's eyes. He stood silently, hands clasped behind his back. In an instant, all phenomena vanished, and the watery light settled back onto the ruins.

'An illusion...?'

He was using his Spring's Echo to sense this place, a divine mystery he had borrowed. It wasn't something one could simply ignore. Even if Li Ximing was a Great Daoist Master, he should have shown some reaction, so long as he could see and hear.

'No reaction at all...'

'Am I overthinking... or did he truly sense my gaze just now?'

This was not the time for this place to reveal itself. If Li Zhouwei had come, Suiguan might have understood; that man's fate was strong, his eyes sharp. But Li Ximing... this was interesting.

'That's not right, either. The Xingyu Palace may be in ruins, but I am shielded by the Chou-Gui Hidden Form. Detecting my gaze should be nearly impossible.'

The man’s blue-purple eyes shifted, and he remained silent for a long time.

'This fellow has cultivated the Life Divine Ability. His World's Radiance... could it grant such perception?'

He pondered for a moment, a murderous smile touching his lips.

"Du Qingzang... I've been here for days. I didn't see Chi Buzi, but this Li Ximing pops up... Li Ximing... a probe from Moongaze Lake."

"According to Du's plan, if it wasn't Chi Buzi, I shouldn't bother. But Li Ximing... he might be in league with that other one. Whether he saw me or not, since he's appeared here, it's safer to eliminate him. It will also serve as a warning."

His blue-purple eyes scanned the area wantonly. He began to stroll, moving with deceptive speed, shuttling through the reflection to follow closely behind the two figures on the water. His gaze fixed on the man like a phantom.

But even a place as large as Little Mountain of Vast Jade was quickly crossed by two Daoist Masters. Suiguan stopped at the edge of the reflection, his expression turning cold. He hesitantly extended half a foot.

The instant he did, the watery light collapsed. Infinite illusory phases churned, and the entire world shook violently, as if mountains were crumbling and the earth splitting. The Demon palace itself began to disintegrate, issuing a cold, silent warning.

The Great Daoist Master's brow furrowed. He watched helplessly as the two divine ability-wielders vanished over the horizon. He quietly retracted his foot, his expression once again calm.

'That damned Du... I can't even kill him...?'

Suiguan squinted into the distance for a long time before turning away. He stepped through the void, rematerializing beside the throne. He stood silent. Only when the sky outside had grown completely dark did he quietly take a seat and speak, his voice flat.

"You think it will alert the enemy? What, Lord Pristine Water, is Chi Buzi himself more dangerous than the plans of the Underworld and the Immortal Mansion?"

As he spoke, the faint light of the Pristine Water began to flow through the ruins, illuminating countless buried treasures and golden artifacts. Suiguan watched with cold eyes, finally murmuring to himself,

"The True Dragons are imminent. This is the only time the Dragon-kin will be so lax about the Pristine Water position. Du Qing, ah Du Qing... you disdain the schemes of the great houses, yet you guard so fiercely against a mere cultivator surnamed Chi... Are you truly not... sacrificing the vital for the trivial?"

But the world of the reflection remained utterly silent. The brilliance of the Pristine Water rose, bathing the world in a pale, greenish-white light. The only answer was the cold sound of flowing water and the churning, primordial chaos coiling silently in the zenith.

...

The moonlight was bright and clear.

A cool breeze rustled through the swaying pines. Li Ximing landed atop another sect's mountain gate. Seeing the Purple Mansion Realm's grand defensive array close beneath him, he finally felt the relief of having survived a disaster. He secretly activated the Immortal Artifact.

'That ghostly thing... it didn't follow me.'

He had seen Suiguan appear below his feet and had immediately severed his divine sense. He knew nothing of what happened after, but that didn't mean he was unaffected...

Heavens knew how many thoughts had raced through his mind on that short journey. Why was Suiguan here? Was it an arrangement by that True Monarch? If he had been exposed... what would the consequences have been?

'The Dragon Prince's palace... the Pristine Water Golden Core... how many secrets does it hold...'

But what chilled him most was Suiguan’s reaction.

'How could he be so perceptive?'

Li Ximing had been using the Immortal Mirror to scan the area. Technically, it was the Immortal Artifact that had seen Suiguan, not him! It was impossible for Suiguan to have made any judgment based on the mere shift of his gaze.

'He must have seen me passing by and decided to test me...'

Even members of Azure Pond felt their hearts pound when they saw the demonic Suiguan. Li Ximing now understood that feeling deeply. A headache pulsed behind his eyes as he cursed inwardly:

'When I go back, I am _never_ flying over Little Mountain of Vast Jade again!'

He forced himself to calm down and surveyed his surroundings. He had arrived at a Daoist temple, but it seemed deserted. The mountains were quiet, with few people in sight. Presently, an old Daoist Master emerged to greet him.

The man wore simple robes, but his cuffs were embroidered with heavy gold patterns that seemed to glow in the night. A faint, multicolored halo shimmered behind his head, giving him a benevolent and extraordinary aura.

He was just extremely old, his face a map of hardships, and he appeared to be injured. He hurried forward and bowed.

"Dao Mian of Xinggong Terrace greets Your Highness!"

Li Ximing glanced at him, realization dawning. The man before him was an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Whole Pill path, and likely possessed two divine abilities.

'This is Xinggong Terrace?'

Li Ximing was genuinely surprised. He glanced at the desolate mountain beneath his feet. He suspected their very mountain gate had been stolen, forcing them to relocate here.

"Senior, you are too kind," he sighed.

Then, he forced a smile.

"My family also has a junior cultivating the Whole Pill, and she is near her breakthrough. Perhaps we will have much to discuss in the future!"

Liu Changdie hadn't arranged this connection with Xinggong Terrace just for resources. The Whole Pill path placed immense importance on lineage, inheritance, and specific spiritual items. This was all to pave the way for his family's Li Que'wan.

Dao Mian's eyes lit up with surprise and delight.

"Excellent... excellent..."

Xinggong Terrace was at the absolute nadir of its lineage. They had already traded away generations of their savings, and were still just barely clinging on. How could he not be thrilled? Even the deep lines of hardship on his face seemed to soften.

Daoist Master Bao Xiang led him inside, seemingly about to offer tea. But after the scare at Little Mountain of Vast Jade, Li Ximing wanted to get this over with.

"I presume Senior already knows the reason for my visit... I was wondering about the Wall-Sinking Water..."

Dao Mian clasped his hands.

"That is not difficult to acquire in the Western Sea. Using my lineage's methods, it can be produced in several locations. Although we have lost access to most of them, it wouldn't be hard to ask a few Daoist friends to... make arrangements."

Li Ximing sighed internally.

"Ideally... I would need one pool a year. That's approximately... one hundred portions."

"One... pool... _a year_?!"

Dao Mian had expected a large request, fitting for a Purple Mansion Realm expert, and one pool wasn't an absurd amount. But _one pool every year_ was terrifying. A thoughtful expression crossed his face.

"That... is somewhat troublesome," he probed. "I wonder... what fellow Daoist offers in trade?"

Li Ximing's expression turned serious.

"Our two lands are far apart. I will dispatch a Daoist Master to travel between them. Each time they arrive, they will supply your esteemed lineage with equivalent spiritual resources. Your troubles, compensation for the Material Transformation... be it pill refinement materials or Purple Mansion Realm resources, all are negotiable."

Dao Mian seemed unconcerned with resources. He sighed.

"The Western Sea cannot compare to the Eastern Sea. I will find a way to gather the spiritual water, I just ask that fellow Daoist give me time. As for compensation... it concerns this injury of mine."

"I was wounded by another, and Merging Fire seared my body. I have yet to recover. I've sought help from many, but nothing works. They say it's not a matter of healing, but of replenishing. It requires a pill."

Li Ximing was beginning to understand.

Dao Mian smiled.

"I cultivate the Whole Pill and am versed in transformations. I've tried mixing a remedy with spiritual items, but it's not as effective as a refined pill. Please, take a look."

He drew a silk cloth from his sleeve. It was covered in fine, golden script. Li Ximing read it several times over.

"Hm?"

His own skill in the Dao of pills was profound. As he read the Whole Pill profundities, his mind lit up, and inspiration struck. He was deeply impressed.

"Fellow Daoist... you are truly formidable!"

Dao Mian was not surprised.

"You praise me too highly. The Whole Pill path concerns itself with Material Transformation, so we have some small ability. There have been many great pill refiners, but few could write a formula that later generations could successfully replicate. Half the formulas passed down... were written by Whole Pill cultivators. I am merely dabbling in the art, and cannot compare to fellow Daoist."

The formula used Valley Water resources, combined them with Pristine Water transformations, nourished the mixture with Mansion Water spiritual water, and finally refined it into a medicine. The process was incredibly complex and clever. If successful, it could harmonize three different water virtues, producing an effect far beyond the sum of its parts. The refinement itself wasn't the hard part; determining the precise ratios would likely lead to countless costly failures. No wonder he hadn't attempted it himself.

But Li Ximing immediately thought of the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art. That secret art was perfect for this. With its aid, the difficulty of this refinement would plummet. He felt a craftsman's eagerness to take on the challenge.

"I will refine it for you," he said decisively. "You will provide the spiritual resources. As for the Wall-Sinking Water... I require six pools."

He didn't bother with a yearly arrangement. Collection would only grow more difficult. In a few years, they might not be able to gather a single pool.

Dao Mian made a quick calculation and nodded.

"Many thanks, fellow Daoist!"

With that settled, Li Ximing moved on.

"Then where is this Small Guang Kong Mountain?"

Bao Xiang, who was standing to the side, spoke up immediately.

"Further west. It's no place of any fame. It's just that Host Shehu of De'ai Temple, shamelessly clinging to the name, trying to associate himself with Little Mountain of Vast Jade."

Li Ximing grew suspicious.

"I heard it was a temple... Does it have any connection to Buddhist cultivators?"
Bao Xiang didn't seem to notice his odd tone and smiled.

"Not much. It's called De'ai Temple because Host Shehu was suppressed by a Maha from the Way of Emptiness for many years. He only escaped during a period of turmoil and has held a grudge ever since. So, he established this De'ai Temple. He treats the monks as slaves and takes the nuns as concubines. It's his... unique preference."

Li Ximing's expression turned strange. He hesitated, but Bao Xiang continued, speaking as if it were common knowledge.

"He has a taste for human hearts. He often sends the nuns to lure men into... copulation. After they have made love three times and the man's vital blood is hot, he immediately carves out the heart and plunges it into ice water. Then he slices it thin. When he picks it up with his chopsticks, the juices flow. It's said to be fresh, fragrant, crisp, and utterly delicious. Fortunately, he doesn't often go on a killing spree for blood; he's quite restrained. His reputation is actually decent. Many call him a 'good man'."

Li Ximing shook his head.

"What a 'good man'."

Perhaps sensing the tone in his voice, Bao Xiang glanced at Dao Mian, then felt compelled to add,

"The Western Sea is barren. When you stand so high, your food and clothes are bound to be stained with blood. Shehu doesn't meddle with those beneath him, so De'ai Temple is actually... less bloody than most."

Bao Xiang was still young. Hearing this, Dao Mian quickly chimed in.

"Every realm has its rules. Back when the Immortal Mansion ruled, even entering the mortal world to govern was considered a demonic act. The lines are truly blurred."

Li Ximing hadn't expected his casual remark to provoke such an explanation. He smiled.

"Zhaojing has no authority to correct the world's morals. I just wonder... how powerful is this Host Shehu? And how many friends does he have?"

Only then did a trace of hatred surface in Dao Mian's eyes.

"That Demon's connections run deep. He's good friends with Chi She, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the West Mansion Grotto Sect. That's the biggest problem. It could drag in several other Purple Mansion experts. Even if you catch them when they're out, Chi She is almost always at the sect. He _must_ be dealt with."

"There's also an old early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Demon in Fangya Province. And Daoist Xie Hu, a mid-stage expert from Tanping Desert, owes him a favor... There may be more."

Listening to the list, Li Ximing felt a headache coming on. Bao Xiang had gone completely silent, letting Dao Mian, who held the grudge, do the talking. It was clear she wanted no part in this.

'If all of them show up... success will be uncertain, but it will definitely be a world-shaking battle. Everyone for leagues around will know...'

He fell silent, but Dao Mian spoke again, his voice low.

"If fellow Daoist is determined, though I am injured and cannot fight, I know an old enemy of the West Mansion Grotto Sect. He is called Yin Qin. He can hold off Chi She."

Li Ximing nodded slowly, a plan forming. He asked about the other mid-stage expert.

"This Daoist Xie Hu... what is he like?"

Dao Mian sighed.

"He is one of the few orthodox figures here. Though he cultivates the path of the Upper Shaman, he has a noble heart and doesn't touch blood-qi. He dislikes Shehu, but he values relationships and honors his word above all. Even as my friend, I know he cannot be persuaded or moved on this."

His face was lined with worry. He wasn't trying to incite Li Ximing out of personal hatred; he was giving a genuine warning.

"He is the most formidable cultivator to rise in the Western Sea in years. His cultivation is advancing rapidly. If fellow Daoist insists on killing Shehu in front of him, you will make a terrible enemy... That would not be good for your future."

Li Ximing listened to it all, his plan solidifying. He smiled.

"That's easily handled. I have a way to ensure he won't be able to interfere."

ps: Host Shehu is at De'ai Temple. Baiyan Temple, which appeared once before, is a different place and has been corrected.
