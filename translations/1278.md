# Chapter 1278: Rise and Fall

The celestial light was brilliant, a spring breeze gracing the four realms. Above the lake island, streaks of escaping light rose and fell, passing by purple-gold profound pillars on their way forward to a tower filled with gold and jade, where guests gathered like clouds.

Li Suining returned from the island's sacrificial rites and quelled the winds, descending toward Fullness Palace. He saw a massive beast statue being moved into place beside the palace tower. Gold-patterned jade talismans and cloud-colored golden gauzes were also on display, hung one by one between the corner towers like countless vibrant waterfalls of spectacular beauty. A woman in a red skirt stood before the palace with her arms crossed, directing people to adorn the structure.

It was his own grandaunt, Xia Shouyu.

Because Li Suining possessed memories from a past life, he had run errands under her and knew that while she appeared unassuming, her methods were actually quite formidable. Thus, he said with a smile:

"Greetings, Grandaunt... You truly are remarkable. When I came here yesterday, the pavilion was still empty, and now everything is already perfectly arranged."

"Ning'er, you're here!"

Xia Shouyu was warm and enthusiastic toward everyone. Hearing his words, she quickly shook her head and replied with an amused laugh:

"There have been many joyous occasions in recent years, arriving one after another. All these decorations were already prepared in the storerooms. The family dislikes extravagance, so the dimensions were custom-made long ago. We just make a few alterations and hang them up each time..."

He then noticed two young, girlish cultivators standing near her. One wore a golden flower, the other bore tassels. Upon hearing Xia Shouyu's words, the one with the golden flower turned and said with a smile:

"You may not know this, clan brother, but we have great fortune here. Everyone says that the Li family of Moongaze has always known joyous occasions, never calamities. Once the gongs start sounding, it's either a small blessing or a great one! The people below are used to handling these events, so they're well-practiced. How could they not be fast?"

The other girl, who was a little younger, added with a smile:

"Isn't that the truth. I heard from my cousin that the jade basin placed before the steps is for burning golden incense paste, something only used for happy events. In the past, some of the lesser sects and clans would ask to borrow it from us, but now they can't get it even if they ask. We don't even have to extinguish the flame in our own courtyards—as soon as one celebration ends, the next one arrives overnight."

After they spoke, the two began to laugh, pushing each other playfully. The elder one chuckled and said:

"You little minx, where did you hear such nonsense."

The younger one, unconvinced, retorted:

"What nonsense! That Chen fellow definitely borrowed it before. No matter how favored they are, they can't jump ahead of our turn!"

The elder girl was taken aback by this and could only tease her:

"He must still be thinking of you, so of course he wouldn't compete with you!"

Having listened to their exchange, Xia Shouyu simply waved her sleeve to dismiss their chatter, saying with a laugh:

"Enough of this 'you' and 'me.' The hour is almost upon us. Go find your own seats instead of standing here and blocking the guests."

The two were still afraid of her, so they meekly dispersed. Li Suining remained silent for a long moment before asking:

"Whose family's younger sisters are those two?"

Xia Shouyu smiled.

"They're Zhouda's granddaughters! He has a bold and generous nature, and his children's talents are decent. The whole family has a lively temperament, so don't mind them."

Li Suining watched from a distance as the two girls went up to the palace tower, greeting the arriving guests with bright smiles. They were lovely in appearance and came from a good family, so all who passed by praised them with a smile.

Li Suining said:

"That's Granduncle Zhouda's temperament, all right. He was always talkative back then and often offended people."

Xia Shouyu smiled without a word. While stepping forward to offer a salute, she patted his shoulder. Li Suining turned his head and, sure enough, saw the old man. He hurried forward and said:

"Old Master!"

Li Xuanxuan was now beaming with smiles, looking almost spirited and vigorous. Li Zhouming, who was always by his side supporting him, raised an eyebrow at Li Suining as he listened to the old man ask:

"Who has all arrived?"

Li Jiangzong had already emerged from the palace tower to greet them. He gave a slight bow and said:

"Everyone has arrived."

Those three words were spoken with a steady and unhurried confidence, as if it were only natural, yet they held an undeniable power. This direct descendant of the Jiangque generation, who had managed the family for many years, seemed unfazed and simply added:

"Only Uncle Zhouluo is on duty in the new capital, and Jiangchun is in seclusion, so they haven't returned... Suihuan is still inside receiving guests."

Li Xuanxuan then ascended the palace tower. The interior was extremely lively, a web of conversations at its most convivial point. A cultivator in purple robes, however, had been waiting respectfully by the entrance. Upon seeing Li Xuanxuan, he smiled and said:

"Old Master, do you still recognize me?"

Li Xuanxuan laughed.

"Ding Mu! Of course, I remember you!"

This man was indeed Ding Mu, a Purple Smoke cultivator from Moongaze Lake. In his early years, he had been sent by Purple Smoke to guard the river on the lake. After Jianghuai was pacified, he had not been to the lake for many years. He bowed deeply and said:

"This junior is currently stationed in the market city with my master. When I heard the good news, I came at once to pay my respects..."

Before he could say more, a middle-aged man who seemed to have been waiting at the entrance for a long time hurried forward. As he was wearing the attire of the Purple Smoke Gate, no one stopped him. He was heard saying:

"Master... Master, do you still remember your old friend, Ling Yanzi! This humble cultivator has come on behalf of my late master to congratulate you, senior..."

Ling Yanzi was someone their family had known from the very early days. Li Xuanxuan had originally felt a degree of nostalgia for him, but that sentiment had faded because of the matter with Li Queyi, and they had lost contact afterward. He was slightly taken aback and said:

"Of course, I remember... How is he?"

The cultivator said:

"He passed away long ago! I heard that before he died, his mouth was parched and he wanted to drink wine. I was in seclusion in my cave dwelling, so no one paid him any mind. Only two young attendants heard him, but he was always prone to shouting and making a fuss, so no one knew he was truly dying."

He seemed equally unconcerned, his gaze earnest as he continued:

"This humble cultivator's surname is Huang... It's about Senior Disciple Queyi! I haven't seen her for a long time. I only heard that she came once when our master died, bringing a jar of wine... I've looked around twice, but I still haven't found her!"

Li Xuanxuan gave a dry laugh as a clamor arose from all sides. Someone announced:

"The people from Xiukui have arrived..."

Ding Mu, who was already frowning, immediately cut off the man surnamed Huang, forcefully holding him back. Only then did a married couple come forward. They offered a toast together and said respectfully:

"We pay our respects to the Old Ancestor!"

The woman was reserved, with her eyes lowered, while the man was dashingly handsome. He smiled and said:

"Caiyin pays his respects to the Old Ancestor."

The members of the Lin family were all remarkably attractive, many possessing a handsome, celestial air. Lin Caiyin, with his tall and slender figure, stood out in particular. The old man was quite fond of him, so he took a cup of wine from Li Minggong beside him and offered a word of congratulations.

Thus, the members of each family came up in succession. Li Xuanxuan was in poor health and only took a small sip from each offering. By the end of the grand feast, he had not finished a single cup. At last, he extricated himself from the event and stepped outside.

A spring rain was drizzling down. The old man used a spell art to disperse the worldly aura clinging to him and changed his robes, only then heading toward Qingdu with Li Zhouming's support.

At this moment, Mount Qingdu was a place of utter silence. The faint, elegant scent of incense, barely perceptible, drifted through the spring rain that covered the mountain. As the old man ascended the azure stone steps one by one, the fragrance of incense slowly grew stronger.

A large hall to the side stood empty, faintly emanating a gloomy, cold air. A wine table could be vaguely seen in the center of the hall, which made the old man pause and gaze at it silently for a moment.

'Xuanfeng...'

That year, Li Xuanfeng had returned to the lake and fallen in this very hall—right before his, Li Xuanxuan's, eyes.

His footsteps were heavy. He walked forward several dozen paces and soon saw the main hall of the compound.

This hall bore no profound patterns, nor did it emit any dazzling spiritual light. Its roof tiles were pitch-black, its twelve pillars vermilion, and its steps were polished from azure stone. Beneath the deep eaves hung a plaque, appearing somewhat old and weathered. The wood was dark, its characters faded.

【Li Clan Ancestral Hall】.

It was the calligraphy of Li Tongya, brought back from the shore. The brushstrokes, which moved like a dragon, still looked fitting hanging here.

The spring rain dripped down. The renowned King Wei, whose fame shook the north and south, stood quietly before the hall's entrance. Beside him, the radiance of Bright Yang shifted and morphed, leaping into various phenomena. A man in crimson robes leaned under the eaves, toying with a purple-gold gourd in his hand, from which a ring of blazing fire could be vaguely seen circulating, an astonishing sight.

A gentle and beautiful woman, draped in the light of transmuting lead and mercury, her profound divine ability restrained within, had already extended her hand to respectfully support him. Li Ximing, looking the same as always with the Heavenly Light flickering between his brows, stepped down and said softly:

"Grandfather..."

This grand ceremony of the Li clan was neither large nor small. The Daoist Masters of the Great Song were all guarding the eastern frontier, and the Li clan had never been fond of ostentation. Although nearly all the major and minor powers of the entire Song nation had arrived, no divine abilities were displayed.

But within, four cultivators with divine abilities and four who had received the investiture of the Purple Mansion Realm were gathered in this one hall!
Li Xuanxuan nodded quietly, his gaze sweeping across them, and said softly:

"I have truly troubled all of you."

"What is the Old Master saying..."

Li Jiangqian smiled faintly and led him inside.

Within the ancestral hall, the lamplight was hazy. Deep in the back hung six profound niches. A level below, one could see the spirit tablets placed on high, their lacquer black and their lettering crimson.

'The Spirit Tablet of Honored Father, the Late Lord Li Mutian.'

'The Spirit Tablet of Honored Mother, the Late Matriarch Liu of the Li Clan.'

Li Xuanxuan could see clearly that it was Li Tongya's handwriting, very similar to the plaque outside. It was just that Li Mutian had passed away early, when Li Tongya was still young, so his calligraphy possessed an extra touch of unrestrained spirit.

He took some incense sticks, lit them with his dharma power, and walked forward respectfully. Just as he had done thousands of times over the years, he first offered incense to Li Mutian, followed by Li Tongya, Li Xiangping...

Only after he had finished did he return to his spot as the various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators came forward in turn. Li Xuanxuan watched blankly, as if he had returned to that small courtyard, watching the old man who had remained hunched in his seat, never stepping out for decades. He could not help but begin to weep:

"Two hundred years!"

"Grandfather! Second Uncle!"

Since Li Tongya's passing, Li Xuanxuan had never again had the chance to utter this address that had once brought him such immense peace of mind. He called out twice through his tears, saying:

"Second Uncle, Ximing has succeeded. Zhouwei... Xuanling's great-grandson has also succeeded... And Jiangqian, and Que'Wan, they've already caught up to the Azure Pond Sect of old..."

The old man sobbed softly for a time, then said:

"But I grow more terrified with each passing day."

He knew that the Li clan had escaped the predicament of its past, but to have reached its current heights left him at a loss for how to speak to the hall full of spirit tablets. He could only gaze at them in silence.

The hall full of spirit tablets was equally silent, watching him from amidst the fragrant smoke.

Li Ximing stood at the back, his gaze somewhat dim as he moved it away from one of the tablets. After an unknown amount of time, he turned to find Li Zhouwei standing motionless in the center of the hall, his head lowered in silence. It was unclear if he was deep in thought or simply quiet. After a long while, he finally raised his eyes and let them fall upon a certain spot.

'The Spirit Tablet of my Late Father, the Lord Li Chengliao.'

This was written in his, Li Zhouwei's, own hand.

Since birth, Li Zhouwei had been a White Qilin. At his birth, he could not control the strange phenomena. He was innocent and ignorant, and everyone around him was afraid; even his own mother regarded him as an anomaly.

Only his father, Li Chengliao—perhaps his emotions were also complex, a mixture of a father's feelings and the clan's expectations—but regardless, it was his father, Li Chengliao, who taught him the proper way to conduct himself in the world, causing him to become more human as he grew.

Li Jiangqian stared blankly toward the high tablets, while Li Que'wan kept her attention fixed on the old man's trembling back. In this moment that seemed both brief and eternal, everyone was lost in their own thoughts, shrouded in a long, heavy silence.

"Cough, cough..."

The old man, after kneeling for a long time, finally rose. The smile on his face was somewhat pale. He scanned the room and said in a low, somber voice:

"You Daoist Masters enter seclusion to cultivate, refining your divine abilities, and years pass in the blink of an eye. This old one's lifespan is nearing its end, and my only fear is facing my ancestors in terror... In the presence of our forebears, I have one or two questions to ask of King Wei and the Daoist Masters."

A look of bewilderment filled his eyes as he lowered his gaze and said:

"It is often said that rise and fall are fated. The rise of the Li clan is due to the enterprise of the Supreme Yin, but I do not know where its fall may lie... Besides King Wei, besides Bright Yang, does the Li clan have another path?"

Li Zhouwei watched him quietly.

"Rise and fall rest on me alone."

Li Xuanxuan was not surprised, but he had to hear the words himself to be at ease. He asked in a hoarse voice:

"Lament for the Fleeting River, whose will is it?"

Li Ximing's lips moved slightly, but he ultimately remained silent. Li Jiangqian savored those four words, his gaze sharpening bit by bit. Li Zhouwei, however, spoke softly in reply:

"It is the north, and also the south; it is the Rosy Heavens, and also the Underworld; it is Ting Province, and also the world."

Hearing the final phrase, the old man trembled slightly and looked up in disbelief. The King Wei before him had a piercing gaze, filled with an unquestionable calm:

"To hesitate in decision is to court swift disaster."

Li Xuanxuan's lips turned pale. He nodded and said:

"It is all for King Wei to decide."

He coughed twice, then finally said in a low voice:

"I have troubled you Daoist Masters. To have four with divine abilities meet with the ancestral spirits, this old one will have face to see the elders in the netherworld... Please... allow me to have some private words with the lords."

Li Zhouwei nodded silently, then bowed and withdrew. He waited until the last person had exited the ancestral hall. A sudden gust of wind seemed to come from nowhere, causing the vermilion doors to slowly swing shut, and only fragments of the old man's words could be heard, carried on the breeze.

"...the Li clan... for many years... has not sought... eternal... longevity..."

"I pray... you spare... our life-mandate..."

His words were exceedingly respectful, like a prayer, yet also like a dialogue with someone else. They were filled with pleading, carried low on the wind, mingled with the faint sound of choked sobs.

The vermilion doors boomed shut, sealing everything away as if in an infinite distance, and no other sound emerged. Li Zhouwei stood with his back to it all and asked quietly:

"How much time does the Old Master have left?"

Li Que'wan's eyes were dim as she answered softly:

"When I was helping him just now, I made a silent estimate. He originally had ten years left, but the old man has not been resting peacefully these past years. He has exhausted his heart and spirit, leading to his haggard state. If he recuperates well, he might last another seven or eight years. But if he continues like this, I fear it will only be three to five."

Hearing this, Li Ximing immediately grew anxious. He clasped his hands behind his back and paced for several steps.

"How can this be!"

Li Zhouwei, however, simply shook his head gently and murmured:

"He has so few years left. Let him be. The Wanling Flower can make one forget their sorrows, yet he is unwilling to use it... There is no need to force him."

He gave Li Jiangqian a deep look and said:

"Set up the inner formation at Qingdu. The ancestral hall... from now on, no one but the Old Master is to enter. If he is burning incense and praying, you must not, and are not permitted to, disturb him."

Li Jiangqian nodded gravely, understanding his meaning. The atmosphere between the four with divine abilities froze for a moment before they sensed a disturbance from down the mountain. Li Zhouming came rushing up, and upon seeing Li Zhouwei, he immediately fell to the ground in prostration, at once shocked and overjoyed.

"Your Majesty! Daoist Master Xiao has arrived!"
