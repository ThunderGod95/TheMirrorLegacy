# Chapter 1195: The Demonic Embryo

Tianque’s tone was glacial, yet Sumian feigned ignorance, his voice a low drawl.

“Incredible… Golden Oneness’s schemes truly are incredible. To think that something like the Qi Stone Demonic Embryo could be refined through the hands of another. I always said that Kong Changxi, from that fallen house, couldn’t have possibly obtained it, no matter how capable he was. It seems your esteemed clan’s Great Daoist Master of the Whole Pill laid the divine groundwork and prepared the very marrow, leaving only the bloody sacrifice for someone else. All the dirty work was pawned off on others. Marvelous. Truly marvelous.”

His years spent wandering the world had clearly not been peaceful. The old layman’s detached, wandering spirit had faded, replaced by a weary worldliness born of toil and strife. He let out a single, sharp laugh, suppressing a well of emotion.

“I was wondering how a man as cautious as Changxi could have been exposed so inexplicably. It must have been the work of your esteemed sect. And in the end, you send me on a trip to Jiangnan, and the whole affair is washed clean, flowing right back into your hands…”

This, however, did not seem to be the source of his rage. As he finished speaking, a deep resentment finally smoldered in his eyes. He offered a humorless smile.

“I came here to find the woman favored by the Bright Yang on behalf of Golden Oneness, to see to this final step. That was fair. I have no desire to meddle in the affairs of others. But while I may be incompetent, I am still of a branch of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition! Looking at the situation in Jianghuai today… if not for Kong Tingyun, if not for my own caution—if I possessed even a sliver less experience or a sliver more greed—the one to die in Shanji today would have been me, Qi Wu’an!”

He sighed in disbelief. “Truly a breathtaking spectacle… you people…”

‘You have to bleed me dry, squeeze every last drop of value from this humble cultivator!’

Sumian choked back the words flooding his heart. But as he spoke, the gaze of Tianque before him grew unnervingly calm. The old Daoist Master hesitated, then swallowed the rest of his sentence.

After a deadening silence, the Great Daoist Master above finally descended, deigning to explain.

“Daoist Friend Qi, Guanhua’s interference in Jianghuai was no ordinary event. The one who acted was a figure from the heavens themselves. Not even Qiushui could predict it, much less know if that man Kong would succeed. What use are all these hypotheticals?”

“As for Changxi, his fate was part of a different design. He was moved by his own greed to refine that object. Had he been willing to dismantle it, it would have been his good fortune. Why must you drag his name through the mud to cover for yourself?”

His gaze deepened.

“Back when you were merely in the Foundation Establishment Realm, you wore the false mantle of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition, bluffing your way into the presence of Qu Tan’s own disciple. You had no idea that his master was a true, orthodox heir of the lineage. You were utterly humiliated, besieged on all sides. Who was it that guided you then? Later, when you, Qi Wu’an, returned from the Eastern Sea with nowhere to go and no successor to your name, how was it that you found your way to my gates? Do you still remember?”

“You cultivate the Treasured Earth and possess the virtue of nurturing. We had but one request: for you to assist in the matter of the Bright Yang’s reincarnation and retrieve the Qi Stone Demonic Embryo. Did Golden Oneness bar your way? Did we use some leverage to chain you to Jiangnan? We did not. Your fortunes and your tribulations are your own. How can you lay the blame at our feet?”

As he finished, his presence swelled with power. He advanced on the old Daoist Master, his voice dropping.

“My clan is not Luoxia, with their grand obsessions with the Immortal Dao. Nor are we the Underworld, as cold and cruel as any specter. For those who cooperate with Golden Oneness, we have only four words: you rise and fall by your own merits. Forget that you stand here today, safe and sound. Even if you had been a step too slow, caught in the undertow of some scheme and left to die, I would still have only four words for you.”

He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his eyes devoid of emotion, and smiled.

“You would have brought it upon yourself.”

Sumian was silent for a long moment, making no attempt to argue the truth of the other’s words. The truth was meaningless now. For years, he had lived in constant fear overseas, thinking he had escaped the Zhang family’s clutches, terrified that Zhang Yige would crush him like an ant. And to them, it was all just a joke.

‘So arrogant… then and now, they’re all the same. Each more arrogant than the last. It would have taken but a single word… just one word! And they still blame me for not contacting them. How could I have possibly dared!’

But just as the Zhang family had never feared his desperation, Sumian, despite his endless grievances, had ultimately returned with his tail between his legs. Tianque had made his stance clear, so Sumian folded.

“Great Daoist Master, you misunderstand!” he said with a sudden smile. “Every man has his own destiny. This humble cultivator was merely awestruck by the profound, inscrutable nature of your sect’s arrangements. How could I ever presume to point fingers at Golden Oneness?”

Tianque swept a glance over him but said nothing. The old Daoist Master, however, seemed not to notice.

“I came to the mountain today to deliver a report.”

At this, Tianque finally showed a flicker of interest. He returned to his seat and listened as the old man spoke.

“That mortal woman, Fei Qingfei, who served as the vessel… I carefully opened her meridians and infused her with your sect’s Praise Cliff Pure Origin. Within days, it was no longer blood that flowed through her veins. Then I placed the demonic embryo inside her. It took a full five or six years of nurturing before the thing even began to take on a human shape, and by then it was about to tear her apart…”

The Daoist Master spoke simply, but the profound nurturing arts involved had utterly drained even a seasoned Treasured Earth cultivator like Sumian. For Fei Qingfei, the vessel, those years must have been a living hell.

Tianque, however, only heard the weariness in his voice. His expression soured. 

“I tasked you with nurturing a demonic embryo, not mastering some esoteric art. Your Treasured Earth cultivators are supposed to be adept at this. Why did so many complications arise?”

“How could a single divine ability of mine possess such power?” Sumian said awkwardly. “I was simply bracing myself and doing what I could…”

“That’s not what you promised!”

Tianque shook his head, though he knew there was nothing to be done.

“What is its condition now?”

Sumian puffed out his chest.

“After all this time, it is ninety percent human in form. I have it submerged in the Mansion Water, sealed within my cave dwelling, awaiting the appointed day. As for the woman, Fei… her belly swelled so much it dragged on the ground, leaving her barely human, but the Valley Water nourished a flicker of life within her. I sent her to a small island overseas to live out the rest of her days in peace.”

Tianque couldn’t be bothered to question the veracity of his tale. The woman was little more than medicinal dregs now; it was entirely possible Sumian had already refined her into a pill. He paused briefly.

 “Where is it?”

This was the heart of the matter. A weight settled in Sumian’s chest, but his smile remained.

“It is being nurtured in my cave dwelling. I was wondering… what are your esteemed sect’s arrangements?”

Tianque gave him a long, knowing look.

“Qi Qiuxin has yet to master the secret art. You were willing to return today because your lifespan is nearing its end, is it not?”

His words hit their mark. Sumian fell silent for a moment before finally nodding.

Tianque smiled.

“I will not only guide Qi Qiuxin into the grotto-heaven, I will send him to the Esteemed Upper Azure Palace to cultivate. I will even prepare a spiritual item, tailor-made for him to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm.”

“Once he enters our sect’s immortal palace, his period of unenlightened struggle will be drastically shortened. When the day comes that he reaches the Purple Mansion Realm, I will give him what you hold, along with a Spiritual Treasure from our own Dao path.”

Sumian was stunned.

‘Aside from not being formally accepted as a disciple of the lineage, this treatment is nearly on par with that of their most important direct heirs!’

As a rogue cultivator, Daoist Master Sumian had toiled his entire life to amass a meager fortune of two Spiritual Artifacts and a single spirit embryo, none of them of high quality. If not for his skill in alchemy and the favor he’d received from Golden Oneness, he wouldn’t have even managed that. A Spiritual Treasure was beyond his wildest dreams! The Li family had King Wei and stood at the forefront of the new era, yet even they possessed only a handful!

Tianque’s offer was so lavish it felt unreal. Sumian calmly raised his head. 

“And in return… what must this old man provide?”

Tianque’s smile faded.

“You will deliver the Qi Stone Demonic Embryo for us,” he said softly. “Deliver it into that man’s hands.”

Sumian felt as though he had misheard. He shook his head in disbelief.

“Simply deliver it? Has Golden Oneness suddenly been struck by a bout of charity?”

He obviously didn’t believe it, and Tianque knew he wouldn’t. The Great Daoist Master rose to his feet with a smile.

“I swear this upon my very chance to attain the Dao.”

Tianque had just promised him a king’s ransom, and Sumian hadn’t flinched. Yet this one sentence struck the old Daoist Master, a man with centuries of experience, like a bolt of lightning. He shot to his feet, his expression shaken.

“Are you serious?!”

The path of cultivation was intertwined with one’s life-mandate; nothing was more sacred than the attainment of the Dao. No cultivator with true ambition would ever wager it. During the Quest for Gold, even a fleeting memory of such an oath could distract the mind and invite failure. Tianque was already a Great Daoist Master, a figure Sumian believed had a genuine chance at ascension. And though he knew the man to be temperamental, he was not one to make light of such a solemn vow.

Seeing the other man nod, Sumian’s heart surged with a mixture of elation and bitterness.

“I fear it won’t be as simple as just delivering it.”

Tianque smiled.

“The man I will direct you to is exceptionally cautious. My clan has dealt with him for years and gained little ground. All of our current arrangements are designed to make him feel secure enough to use this Qi Stone Demonic Embryo.”

“But he has grown quite capable. Any method of delivery is bound to arouse his suspicion. So why not… Daoist Friend… use your life to win his trust?”

His voice grew softer, his tone chillingly calm.

“How about you feed the Dao with your body?”

***

Moongaze Lake.

The sky was clear, the air crisp. A white-robed Daoist Master stepped out of the Great Void, riding the wind. The treasured vase at his waist pulsed with light, and the ethereal cloud beneath his feet roiled gently. As the landscape below came into focus, he couldn’t help but exclaim his admiration.

‘What a magnificent lake. I can only imagine its splendor before it began to wither.’

He oriented himself and soon spotted the small, gardenia-covered mountain he remembered. He activated a divine ability to announce his visit, and the grand array shimmered in response, granting him entry. But the figure seated within was no longer Li Ximing. Instead, a young man with golden eyes, dressed in crimson robes, regarded him with a faint smile, the Radiant Fire around him pulsing gently.

‘Another young prodigy!’

Xuanyi himself was not old; both he and Li Ximing were considered part of the new generation of Purple Mansion cultivators. But the speed at which the Li family scions achieved their divine abilities was simply astonishing, making Li Ximing seem far older by comparison.

He adopted a respectful demeanor and smiled.

“I am Xuanyi of Mount Jingyi. And you, Daoist Friend, are…?”

The young man’s smile was warm and earnest. He parted his lips, his voice soft but steady.

“It is an honor, Senior Xuanyi. I am Changli, son of King Wei. Daoist Master Zhaojing is my great-granduncle.”

Xuanyi had, of course, known who he was, but hearing it confirmed, he offered the customary praise.

“So it is Changli! As the saying goes, a tiger does not birth a dog.”

Li Jiangqian, who was appraising him just as carefully, returned the smile with a sigh.

“Senior is too kind. I was merely blessed by the Bright Yang at birth and have been buoyed by my family’s endless resources to reach my current station. I am unworthy of such praise.”

“And Daoist Master Zhaojing…?”

At the question, a deep sorrow instantly clouded Li Jiangqian’s features. He shook his head with a heavy sigh.

“He is preoccupied with my father’s condition… *sigh*… it has brought such suffering upon our family.”

Xuanyi had heard of the infamous Crystalline Jade Branch. Thinking on it now, he felt a pang of sympathy.

“A truly troublesome affair.”

Prompted by his words, Li Jiangqian seemed unable to contain his grief any longer.

“This thing burns my father so that he cannot rest,” the young man lamented. “He cannot heal, let alone cultivate. And it worsens with each passing day. No spiritual medicine we try is more than a drop in the ocean. My great-granduncle is working frantically to refine a pill for him.”

Hearing this, Xuanyi sighed inwardly and decided not to delay.

“I’ve come on a simple matter. I am here to deliver something from Daoist Master Guo. Your family once entrusted him with refining a Spiritual Artifact. Considering his involvement with Qusi, he was meant to deliver it himself. However, he paid me a visit first and was struck by a sudden enlightenment. He passed the items to me and rushed into seclusion.”

A look of understanding dawned on Li Jiangqian’s face, though inwardly he shook his head.

‘He’s merely entering seclusion to refine his second divine ability. He was afraid that if he came himself, my family would impose another task on him—one he couldn’t refuse due to obligation and his sect’s orders. Far easier to send someone in his stead and avoid the awkwardness.’

Outwardly, however, he expressed profound gratitude.

“The elders of my family are deeply moved by the consideration of the two Daoist Masters.”

Xuanyi smiled.

“There is no need for thanks. My Dao lineage shares deep roots with Qusi, though our origins led us to form our own gate. It is a long story, but the bonds of apprenticeship remain. Now, have a look at these treasures!”

With a flick of his sleeve, several items materialized on the jade table.

The short, demonic-qi-wreathed blade now revealed its true form. Its body was a fusion of black and gold, etched with profound patterns that radiated a chilling aura. Beside it, the long whip lay coiled into a palm-sized disk.

But in addition to these two, there was a third item on the table: a small, exquisite object of glazed crystal.

It was no bigger than a thumb and shaped like a lotus blossom, so clear it seemed to hold flowing spiritual water within, giving it a mystical appearance. 

More peculiar still, two rays of golden light intertwined at the lotus’s heart, casting off mesmerizing halos of light.

Li Jiangqian stared, momentarily stunned.

“Do you recall when King Wei eliminated Vast Cicada?” Xuanyi explained with a smile. “Daoist Master Zhaojing retrieved the Valley Water Lotus from his remains, refined it into the Returning Creek Valley Water, and combined it with the Long Yue Variable Gold. He then entrusted them to my disciple-brother.”

“He was deeply grateful to receive such precious spiritual items from your family. After consulting with his Great Daoist Master and enlisting the help of several other Daoist Friends, he has finally completed the refinement. Congratulations!”
