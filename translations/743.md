# Chapter 743: Arranging Affairs, (Part 2)

Li Xinghan offered his thanks, earning a nod of approval from Li Xuanxuan.

"Do you have a Dharma Sword?" he asked.

The question made it obvious that a gift was forthcoming. Li Xinghan answered respectfully, "I have a lower-grade Qi Refining sword called the 'Northern Jade.' It was from my uncle's collection, originally a Dharma Artifact of the Yu family. It's quite old, likely forged back when the Jiang Clan was prominent, but it serves me well."

"The Yu family," Li Ximing remarked, raising an eyebrow. Since Li Xuanxuan had brought it up, it was only natural for him, the Daoist Master, to bestow the gift. "Back then... Yu Mujian had a sword named 'Bronze Hoard.' Your Uncle Xijun shattered it, but the remains are still in the treasury. It was forged from the bronze of Yan Mountain and the Water of the Drifting Nether. The craftsmanship was average, but the materials are of exceptional quality."

Everyone listened intently as Li Ximing continued, "Once you master the 'Flowing Light of the Triple Moon,' come up the mountain. I will personally find a smith to forge a new sword for you using the Bronze Hoard as the core material."

Li Xinghan bowed deeply in thanks, a genuine smile gracing her face. The promise of this new sword seemed to excite her even more than the Daoist Master's personal guidance.

Li Ximing then turned, his gaze sweeping over Li Zhouluo. The young man already wore a Foundation Establishment-grade sword at his waist, one cast in a brownish-yellow hue. It looked familiar to Li Ximing; it was likely the standard-issue 'Xushi Sword' his elder brother, Li Xizhi, had once used. Though made from Foundation Establishment materials, its quality was merely adequate, making it a suitable weapon for Zhouluo.

In recent years, Li Chenghuai had grown closer to Li Xizhi and his wife, so the family didn't need to worry about Li Zhouluo's cultivation resources or artifacts. His grandfather provided for almost everything, ensuring his supplies were on par with, if not better than, the direct descendants of the Azure Pond Sect. Within the Li family, he was in a class of his own. Thus, Li Ximing only asked a few questions about his cultivation before dismissing the two juniors, keeping only Li Quewan behind.

"You and Jiangqian wait for me down the mountain," he instructed.

Once the younger generation had departed, Li Xuanxuan finally spoke. He didn't ask about An Siwei, instead choosing a different topic. "Those two are promising children. And then there are Zhoufang and Zhouyang... Your younger brother once remarked that the only noteworthy thing about those two was their honesty. Yet now, aside from Zhouwei, Zhouluo, and Xinghan, they're the only presentable ones of the 'Zhou' generation..."

His tone held no anger, only a trace of melancholy. "Of the dozen or so others... the ones who are half-hearted, foolish, or incompetent are the better of the lot. Then there are those who lock themselves away, indulging in their own pleasures, secretly lost to wine and women... As long as they don't harm the common folk, Mount Qingdu can't punish them too severely. We can only let them be. As for the last one or two... they're still locked in a cell!"

At these words, Li Chenghuai quickly bowed his head in apology. "It is our failure as elders... My brothers and I have been negligent in their education..."

"Your Chengming generation is either cultivating or fighting. There are hardly any of you left. This blame doesn't fall on your shoulders..." Li Xuanxuan waved his hand dismissively. "It's that boy Zhouming's wretched nature... that is the real trouble."

Hearing his own grandson's name, Li Ximing understood at once. He glanced at Li Chenghuai and said, "Grandfather, you're blaming me... What foolishness has Zhouming committed now?"

Given that Li Ximing had just mentioned Li Zhouming, any misdeed that failed to reach his ears would be Li Chenghuai's responsibility. But Li Chenghuai was just as clueless; he had no idea what this person had done wrong! The last person who had deceived a Daoist Master had been reduced to ash. That single glance from Li Ximing, even coming from his own elder, was enough to make him freeze.

Fortunately, Li Xuanxuan's age had granted him sharp insight. A single look between the two was all he needed to grasp the situation. "This matter isn't under Mount Qingdu's jurisdiction, so the blame should fall on me."

Li Xuanxuan lowered his voice. "A few years ago, while you were in seclusion, Zhouming's cultivation was lagging. I thought to help him, so I had Jiangqian arrange a position for him. But he refused to go, and the matter was dropped. No one else in the family knew."

"Later, when Chenghuai came out of seclusion, he assigned him a task directly. He went, albeit reluctantly. I worried his cultivation level wouldn't command respect, so I secretly gave him a spiritual item to aid his practice... But... when I checked on him a few days ago... his cultivation showed no change."

Li Ximing sat up straight and poured Li Xuanxuan a cup of tea. "This junior has been lax in his upbringing."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head. "A direct descendant of a Daoist Master being supported by the family is one thing. We don't lack for one more mouth to feed... whether it's shameful or not is another matter. But I want what's best for him, so I have to say a few more words."

Silence fell upon the mountain. Fearing he had angered Li Ximing, Li Xuanxuan added, "I'm not saying he's completely useless. Among the juniors, Zhouwei is exceptional, of course, but the only others who have truly amounted to anything are Fang, Yang, Luo, and Han. Zhouming at least listens to his father a little. Compared to his brothers, he isn't the worst."

Li Ximing understood his grandfather's meaning. "Just give him an idle post. I never expected him to achieve anything great. We only need to manage the few who have ambition. Does Grandfather truly expect the family to prepare resources and send people to supervise his cultivation day and night? Our family has always selected the best based on talent and wit. We cannot break that rule."

Li Xuanxuan could only sigh and change the subject. "Chenghuai, though your Immortal Foundation is formidable, in my opinion... you shouldn't use it for every little thing."

Li Chenghuai looked slightly surprised.

Li Xuanxuan continued, "There are some things you can't perceive. As the saying goes, the water is too clear for fish. In the two years you've overseen Mount Qingdu, both the guest retainers and the family's direct line have grown timid, as if treading on ice. They've started colluding to find ways to evade your scrutiny. On the surface, things appear more peaceful, but in reality, their dealings have become more secretive. This is not a good sign."

"It's one thing if we can see their clandestine actions; a few grievances and injustices are acceptable. What I fear is that their activities become so cautious and hidden that neither of us can see them clearly. Then we'll have to expend twice the effort to investigate. There are countless wondrous arts in this world; they will eventually find a way to understand and bypass your divine ability. If we become too reliant on your Immortal Foundation, we will be the ones deceived and manipulated."

Li Chenghuai bowed his head in thought.

The old man went on, "Secondly, you should be focusing on your cultivation right now, not neglecting the root for the branches. Only involve yourself as a witness in major affairs concerning the direct lineage. After all, this current situation, where every single matter is brought to Mount Qingdu for a final judgment, has also broken the rules."

Li Chenghuai had just finished refining two new Dharma Artifacts and had yet to explore their many wonderful properties. He had been holding his post at Mount Qingdu purely out of a sense of duty. He now sensed the old man had been aware of this for some time and was offering him a way out. He couldn't help but marvel internally.

'The old master says nothing, but he is the one who sees things most clearly in this family... He has been watching over us for more than a century, after all...'

With a newfound sense of respect, he declared, "Chenghuai will obey. I will relinquish my authority at Mount Qingdu as soon as I return!"

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard and smiled. "In that case, let Zhouluo take charge of Mount Qingdu."

"Old Master!" Li Chenghuai tried to object, but Li Xuanxuan simply waved his hand. Seeing this, he had no choice but to take his leave.

Alone now, the grandfather and grandson sat in silence. Li Xuanxuan glanced at the Daoist Master, who was quietly sipping his tea. "Ming'er, what do you think is the main flaw of the 'Zhou' generation?"

The celestial light between the white-robed, gold-patterned Daoist Master's brows subsided. He took a sip of tea. "They are too good-natured... and I fear they will be deceived."

"Precisely," Li Xuanxuan said with approval.

Li Ximing's voice was low. "Father told me from a young age that Moongaze Lake is a wicked land. He said that a ruler must be the most adept at misdeeds, cunning, and deception to control such people and bring peace to the populace. Zhouluo and Xinghan are talented, but they were born into privilege. Everything has come easily to them. They are fine for cultivation and combat, but if they encounter someone like Wenhu or Chen Yang, I'm afraid they will be easily manipulated."

In truth, Li Ximing was being gentle. Li Zhouluo wasn't a fool, but if he were to truly face Wenhu, he would almost certainly be played for one. This was exactly what worried Li Xuanxuan. "Who can say? People grow with age. When Chengdang was young, he was just a quiet boy among the Chengming generation. No one thought he would amount to much. Let's just wait and see."

Li Xuanxuan had been on the verge of asking about An Siwei several times, but in the end, he held his tongue. He simply stood up. "This old man has spent too long on the peak. It makes me want to meddle in family affairs. Don't mind my rambling."

"Grandfather's guidance is an endless benefit to the family."

Li Ximing saw him off. Down at the foot of the mountain, Li Jiangqian and Li Quewan were waiting, and behind them stood a broad-faced man. Feeling no need to return to the summit, Li Ximing sat down in the pavilion at the mountain's base.

"How are things progressing with the Secret Diffusion lineage?" he asked.

Li Jiangqian answered respectfully, "The Wang family members have arrived. This is Wang Quwan. He's from a different branch than Wang He, but he is still from the direct line of the Jiangbei Wang Clan."

The Wang Clan was a special case. They were an important local power, having migrated from the lands of Qi in the State of Zhao. Their numbers were significant not only in Funan and Midong, but their clan had once stretched all the way to the Tangjin region. Because of this, the Wang family could no longer be treated as ordinary guest retainers.

Li Ximing glanced at Wang Quwan. The man was dressed simply and had an unremarkable appearance. "Jiangbei is in turmoil. Now that the Wang clansmen have newly relocated to Funan, are you facing any difficulties?"

Wang Quwan clasped his hands and bowed, his eyes lowered respectfully toward the ground. "Midong was turbulent and dangerous. It is thanks to the main family that the Wang Clan was able to escape that sea of bitterness. Now we have been granted new lands. Everyone has a spirit field to cultivate and receives a stipend. The common clansmen are living and working in peace. We face no hardships."

His attitude and choice of words made the Daoist Master pause. Li Ximing noted that the man before him was neither young nor old, perhaps nearing fifty. "What arts have you studied? Do you have any skills? What crafts does your clan practice to sustain itself?"

Wang Quwan's gaze remained fixed on the ground, his posture one of ultimate deference. His etiquette was more impeccable than anyone Li Ximing had met. "Reporting to the Daoist Master," he said in a steady voice, "this humble one has practiced the sword since childhood and has achieved some small success, cultivating sword Qi for many years. My elder brother, Wang Qudao, is also nearby in the Funan region. He has some skill in alchemy, which he uses to support his family."

Li Ximing sensed a calm and composed mind, neither servile nor arrogant. This was no ordinary man. His words were precise and measured, which sparked a faint sense of unease in him.

'He's no simple character either... Wenhu, Ding Weizeng, Gongsun Bofan... and now Wang Qudao and Wang Quwan... This land of Jiangbei is truly blessed by the heavens. It's unusual... far too unusual.'

Li Ximing remained silent, and Wang Quwan could only continue to kneel. A strange premonition suddenly struck the Daoist Master.

'How does my family compare to the Xiao Clan of the past? Back then... did the Xiao Clan look upon my ancestor, Tongya, the same way I am looking at Wang Quwan now?'

'Did the Purple Mansion cultivators of that era think the same thing when they looked at my familyfirst there was Wan Huaqian and Yu Yufeng, then came Li Chejing and Yu Muxian, and then there was Li Tongya... This land of Moongaze Lake is truly blessed by the heavens!'

A myriad of thoughts raced through his mind. After a brief pause, he nodded. "Very well. Since you are willing to serve my family, you will be treated with the same consideration as our own clansmen."

Wang Quwan bowed respectfully. Just then, the Daoist Master flicked a finger, and a jade slip landed before him. "My clan has a technique called 'The Xiaoshi Art of Clearing the Heavens and Scattering Clouds.' It is far superior to whatever third-rate manual you're practicing, and it even includes the Foundation Establishment portion. You may begin cultivating it."

A flicker of joy lit up Wang Quwan's eyes. He understood the Daoist Master's intentions almost instantly. The Wang family had Wang He, a cultivator of the Capital immortals Dao, in Jiangbei. They were also the largest clan by far, with numerous direct branches. To stabilize their rule, the Li family needed a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Wang Clan. He accepted the jade slip with reverence. "This junior thanks the Daoist Master. The Wang Clan in Jiangbei will serve as loyal vassals to the main family, stabilizing the region for the Daoist Master and the clan head. We would die ten thousand deaths without regret."

Seeing that he had grasped the surface meaning, Li Ximing spoke more freely. "The family's 'Three Perfection Breakthrough Pill' and 'Pill of White Breath and Golden Sprout' will both have a share set aside for you. When you are ready to attempt your breakthrough, make a trip to Gardenia Scenery Mountain."

Wang Quwan expressed his gratitude once more and departed down the mountain. As he watched him leave, Li Ximing turned to Li Jiangqian. "Have you selected the candidates from the clan to cultivate the Secret Diffusion arts?"

Li Jiangqian nodded. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, I have just checked. Unfortunately, the most talented one, my younger sister Queyi, has already broken through, so it's too late for her. There are three members of the Jiangque generation at the fifth and sixth layers of Embyronic Breathing. This technique requires time to gather Qi, but fortunately, the Wang Clan had a stockpile that we've reclaimed. We'll have one of our younger clan brothers start cultivating it first, and then decide on the others."

Having seen Wang Quwan's capable demeanor, Li Ximing felt more at ease. In a few years, once his cultivation was higher, he would surely be a valuable asset. "Wang Quwan is a man of substance. It seems the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage is destined for him, which means his fortune is strong. You must watch him closely. The Wang Clan of Jiangbei is too large to tie down completely, but if we can make good use of Wang Quwan, he will be no less valuable than Ding Weizeng."

"This junior will remember!"

With the matter of the Secret Diffusion lineage settled, Li Ximing retrieved a stone box from his sleeve. Inside was Changxi's final testament. He handed it to Li Jiangqian. "I'm going to the Purple Smoke Gate, and I may have to make a detour to the Xuanmiao Temple to deal with Shanji Prefecture. I want you to inform Cheng'en to gather the people from the Profound Peak Gate. Have them retrieve the item from beneath the seat of the Head of the Hall of Resting Peaks and verify it against this testament."

Without another word, he transformed into a streak of celestial light and departed. Li Jiangqian maintained his bow until the light had vanished over the horizon. Only then did he straighten up and turn to Li Quewan.

"Sister, how has your progress been these past few months?"

"Not much to speak of," Li Quewan replied, her expression tinged with worry. "It seems we can no longer hold Shanji Prefecture. We're about to lose the entire prefecture, and all of the Profound Peak Gate's foundations will be scattered. I wonder how those few from the Kong Clan will react."

At the mention of this, Li Jiangqian said, "How else could they react? Has my Li family not been benevolent enough to them? Look at the Xuanmiao Temple, then look at Mount Jingyi. We are saving their Dao lineage. What cannot be defended must be abandoned, no matter how precious. Do they expect our family to protect it with our own lives?"

Li Quewan sighed. "Brother Qian, what you say is logical, but when you are caught in the middle of it, it's impossible to see clearly. From the Profound Peak Gate's perspective, they may not see this as a rescue. They might see it as something their ancestor earned by trading away spiritual artifacts and treasures, something that wasn't given to any other family... It all depends on whether Kong Guxi can make sense of it. If he can't, his fate will be far worse than Yuan Fuyao's!"
