# Chapter 1078: Diyan

The Southern Sea was vast and its waves turbulent. Beyond the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, which was encircled by islands, and past the strait between Songzhou and Danrong Wuluo, lay another sea, eight hundred miles wide.

Peaks jutted from this sea, with a few small islands dotting its northern reaches, very close to Danrong Wuluo. Guo Nanwu's clan was established here. His family line was thin, so he had recruited many rogue cultivators. The grand formation they were building was just taking shape, and the area bustled with activity.

Li Ximing did not see him there. Past this island, the mountains pressed closer together, narrowing the waters into a river-like channel. Even at its widest, it was merely a series of small, interconnected lakes, stretching barely a dozen miles across. This region was called the Southern Anchorage Sea, though it resembled a continent more than a sea.

Mount Qusi was located in this Southern Anchorage Sea.

Li Ximing had made inquiries before arriving. This place once had much more water, and the sea level hadn't been so low. It used to resemble the Crimson Reef Island to the north. But after the water level dropped twice, it looked even more like a landmass. Consequently, many cultivators who traveled here now referred to it as the Southern Anchorage Continent.

This was his first time here, and his first time crossing the long, narrow Danrong Wuluo. He looked around with a sense of novelty, noticing the lush, green mountains were home to many immortal cultivators and Daoist practitioners. Most resided in immortal palaces and halls. Fairies of stunning beauty were often seen flying among the peaks. In a Southern Sea teeming with Buddhists and demons, this place was truly a paradise apart from the world.

At its very center, Mount Qusi coiled like a magnificent beast, its strange, rugged stones piercing the white clouds that wreathed it. Immortal pavilions dotted its slopes. The Daoists entering and leaving all wore dark purple robes, their attire and adornments identical to those from the north.

'Mount Qusi follows a Great Dao of upholding righteousness, balancing yin and yang, and harmonizing water and fire. Many of its disciples cultivate the male and female principles, yin and yang... It truly has the atmosphere of an immortal sanctuary.'

He paused among the mountains and politely made his inquiry. Immediately, a white wind swept out from the peaks, solidifying before him into a man in long robes. His features were proper, and he smiled warmly.

"Senior, you've found your way here!"

"So, it's Nanwu..."

Li Ximing nodded to Guo Nanwu, only to realize another person had emerged with him. This man was far more handsome, dressed in an azure Daoist robe with profound patterns, a vermilion mark on his brow, and the Black Cloud Silver Sparrow Bottle hanging from his waist. He looked dashing and carefree, smiling as he spoke.

"It's been a long time!"

It was Daoist Master Xuanyi.

Both men belonged to the Mount Qusi faction, so their presence here was not surprising. After Li Ximing greeted them, Guo Nanwu smiled.

"Senior, please follow me inside!"

Guo Nanwu had spent years running errands for the Li Clan, and Li Ximing had never treated him unfairly, refining every pill he requested without complaint. Compared to Daoist Master Xuanyi's polite courtesy, Guo Nanwu's demeanor showed a clear measure of gratitude and warmth. He immediately led Li Ximing inside, descending into a magnificent palace.

On a jade table, black and white stones were scattered in a complex pattern, and steam curled from cups of tea. A game was clearly at a critical juncture. Two beautiful women came forward, collected the game board, and departed. Daoist Master Xuanyi turned to give instructions.

"Nanwu, hurry and call your sister Xinyu back!"

Understanding dawned on Guo Nanwu, and he left with a smile. Li Ximing, however, gleaned a great deal of information from that single sentence. He sat down, lost in thought.

'The relationship between these families is even closer than I imagined... Guo Nanwu almost acts like a junior disciple of the sect... And Daoist Master Xuanyi, despite belonging to the Mount Jingyi Dao lineage, clearly holds significant influence here.'

The two sat. Daoist Master Xuanyi seemed somewhat melancholic. He poured the tea and said,

"Kuang Yu is currently in Tongmo Prefecture, Yu Province. It will take her some time to return. I must ask Daoist friend to wait."

Li Ximing was puzzled.

"Tongmo?"

Daoist Master Xuanyi sighed.

"You may not know, Daoist friend... The other day... a torrential rainstorm inundated Yu Province. The flash of water was so intense, the phenomenon so vast it covered several regions, reaching a point where a Purple Mansion Realm expert was needed to suppress the celestial phenomenon. We later heard news that someone from the Chen Clan perished while failing to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. His name was... Chen Xuanyu."

Li Ximing's heart clenched. He closed his eyes, as if recalling something.

"Chen Xuanyu?"

He remembered that swordsman. They had fought side-by-side to kill Wang Fu. Though they had only met once, he had left an excellent impression. Chen Xuanyu was, without question, the leader of his generation in the Chen Clan, their most outstanding junior in a century. His status in the Chen Clan was identical to Li Zhouwei's former status in the Li Clan—the undisputed pillar of the next generation!

Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin, had mentioned him before. While not effusive with praise, it was clear he held Chen Xuanyu in high regard. For him to die so suddenly was a devastating blow. Li Ximing frowned, perplexed.

"He had been in seclusion for a long time. Logically, he should have already passed the most dangerous period. How could he fall at this juncture..."

Daoist Master Xuanyi's expression dimmed. He shook his head.

"It seems Daoist friend went into seclusion immediately after your great battle... While you were on the lake fending off Vast Cicada, the Shu State to the west was not idle. An army marched from the Huayan Three Prefectures to attack Yu Province."

"The one leading the army was Daoist Master Shen Sou of the Miao Province Sun Clan, the head of the Nine Surnames of Wu State. He was assisted by Daoist Master Shangguan Mi of the Shangguan Clan. Daoist Master Shen Sou and the Chen Clan have been at odds for a long time, nursing old grievances. He seized the opportunity of leading a great army to use the 'Unfathomable Water and Fire' to destabilize the Great Void over Tongmo..."

Li Ximing understood the gist of it. Chen Xuanyu had greatly admired his younger brother, Li Xijun, and had even invited him for a visit. He hadn't expected his brother to die suddenly. Chen Xuanyu had even come to pay his respects, which left Li Ximing with a very favorable impression of the swordsman. A pang of regret struck him as he listened to Daoist Master Xuanyi continue.

"The 'Unfathomable Water and Fire' is also a True Qi treasure, but its effect on the Great Void is even greater than the 'Immeasurable Water and Fire'... It forced the venerable Daoist Master Chen to expend his own vital energy to repel the man. After Daoist Master Shen Sou withdrew, there were no further disturbances. They thought the crisis had passed, and he was secretly relieved. But they never expected that a year later... that junior ultimately couldn't hold on."

"He actually managed to hold on for an entire extra year..."

Li Ximing fell silent. After a long moment, he said,

"His fate was just not strong enough. It's the same as Senior Cheng Gao."

Daoist Master Xuanyi didn't elaborate. As was his custom, he untied the jade bottle from his waist, tossed it lightly, and released Bai Yinzi to serve them tea. Li Ximing knew this was partially a gesture to prove his innocence. He asked a few perfunctory questions, listening as Bai Yinzi smiled and said:

"This humble one now keeps busy inside the bottle for the Daoist Master, mostly gathering and absorbing qi, divining fates, and refining spiritual light. My life-mandate is secure, which is already a wonderful outcome."

Li Ximing replied casually, then cut straight to the point.

"Is the Venerable Daoist Master in the mountains? I've come this time specifically to pay my respects and express my gratitude."

Daoist Master Xuanyi was not surprised.

"The elder spends all his years cultivating in the mountains and never goes out. He's locked within the Profound Chamber, and it's difficult for even us to see him... We need Kuang Yu to request an audience."

"After all, Xinyu is his blood descendant, and some matters are their clan's internal affairs. I have already left the Southern Anchorage Sea with my Master to establish my own Dao Lineage, so it's not proper for me to disturb him rashly."

Seeing Li Ximing nod and sip his tea, he added with a candid smile, 

"Furthermore, the Venerable Daoist Master's presence is... extremely heavy. I... don't really dare to bother him."

Hearing this, Li Ximing suspected this Venerable Daoist Master Diyan was likely not in good condition. He replied calmly. Before he could say more, Daoist Master Xuanyi, as if he had been hesitating for a long time, asked:

"Zhaojing... after Tingyun achieved the Dao, has she... has she sought you out?"

Li Ximing paused, sensing something.

He sighed, "Of course not... From what I can see, she is no longer in control of her own actions."

Daoist Master Xuanyi looked anxious.

"My disciple... Kong Gumo... she hasn't asked about him even once. After she emerged from seclusion, she heard that Gumo remained completely silent during the entire Profound Peak crisis. He even turned away the messengers sent to ask for aid. She was furious. She had him struck from the clan register, declaring that the disciples of the Kong Clan should never see him again!"

Years ago, when Daoist Master Changxi fell, one of the contingency plans he'd laid was to have Kong Gumo enter the Mount Jingyi sect. Daoist Master Xuanyi, coveting the Yuezhou Island and being at odds with Yehui, had specially accepted him.

'Now it's become a problem!'

Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then asked,

"How did Kong Gumo reply?"

Daoist Master Xuanyi shook his head. "He just laughed, tossed the letter aside, and went back to his cultivation."

Li Ximing met his gaze and raised an eyebrow.

"This is also a bond of friendship. No matter what happens to the Kong Clan in the end, it shouldn't affect your disciple. I hope, for the sake of your master-disciple relationship and the Kong Clan, you will continue to protect him."

Li Ximing knew, of course, that Kong Tingyun wasn't the type to make such a drastic move. This so-called severing of ties and removal from the ancestral hall was merely a ploy to shield the junior from the fallout. He still cherished the old friendship between Kong Tingyun and his own elders, so he offered these words of counsel.

Daoist Master Xuanyi understood his position and no longer tried to hide his feelings. He let out a deep sigh.

"How could I not see it? ... When Senior Kong came to me back then, she had only one request: whether the mainland was drowning in blood or the Kong Clan emerged unscathed, I was to ignore it and teach Kong Gumo to sever all ties. At the time, she even tempted me, saying that if I protected Gumo, he might be able to fight for the Kong Clan inheritance in the future, just to spite Yehui... But Gumo has cultivated on my mountain for many years. It's impossible to say there's no emotional bond."

A shadow of worry gathered on his brow.

"I originally intended to protect him and let him sever those ties. But I never expected... I went into seclusion for just a few short years, and when I came out, he was already in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, cultivating the 'Converging Water' art!"

Li Ximing's mind suddenly cleared, and he grew vigilant. He hesitated.

"Daoist friend, you mean..."

Daoist Master Xuanyi paused, then said with some difficulty,

"Based on my understanding of his aptitude, as the most talented disciple of his generation in the Kong Clan, his willpower is strong. He has a hope of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, but it's not a large one. And I don't have the spiritual item for the 'Converging Water' art to give him... But I'm thinking about Kong Tingyun... She may not want Gumo to seek a divine ability..."

"And even if he _does_ seek this divine ability and fails to break through, what will Kong Tingyun think of me? I'll never be able to clear my name. How would she know I didn't secretly interfere?"

Li Ximing held his breath, understanding his dilemma. Daoist Master Xuanyi hesitated, then whispered,

"I was rather hoping you could meet with her on my behalf..."

He finally lowered his head, sipping his tea in silence, his mind heavy. But the matter of Chen Xuanyu had reminded Li Ximing of Li Xijun. The two discussed some Daoist theories, and the atmosphere grew somber.

Fortunately, time passed quickly while they discussed the Dao. A gray-white cloud was seen descending rapidly among the peaks. A woman riding the wind landed before the palace and hurried inside. The deep worry that had been on her face vanished, replaced by a smile. The blue-purple light in her eyes flickered.

"Ximing, you're here!"

Li Ximing quickly stood up and smiled.

"You've mentioned it several times... If I didn't come soon... I was afraid you'd start to blame me."

Kuang Yu beamed at the sight of him, crossing her arms.

"So, you're blaming me for being petty."

Kuang Yu had the liveliest personality, and her words were playful. Her retort left him momentarily speechless, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Daoist Master Xuanyi, meanwhile, stood with his hands behind his back, looked between the two, and shook his head with a smile as he walked out. Guo Nanwu had just stepped back over the threshold, looking confused, only to be grabbed by the shoulder and led back out by him. Only Daoist Master Xuanyi's laughing voice drifted back:

"Please, take your time! I'll go with Nanwu to check on the grand formation!"

As soon as the two were gone, Kuang Yu naturally led him deeper inside. The smile vanished from her face, and the worry she'd had before returning resurfaced. She spoke in a low voice.

"I just returned from the Chen Clan... I'm sure you've heard. But I also saw Sister Tinglan... She..."

Li Ximing frowned.

"Tinglan?"

Kuang Yu pressed her lips together.

"Daoist Master Chen Yin is devastated. I heard he coughed up blood the moment the celestial phenomenon appeared. Sister Tinglan and I happened to be nearby, so we went together. But... the Venerable Daoist Master Chen claimed his injuries had not recovered and refused to see her."

This silenced Li Ximing. A troubling thought surfaced in his mind.

'Tinglan is guarding the Mushroom Forest Plains...'

Mount Dali was the natural barrier between the Shu and Song states. The Mushroom Forest Plains, located behind Mount Dali, could reinforce Tongmo to the south or Moongaze to the north. Yang Ruiyi had stationed Tinglan there precisely to support either side at a moment's notice... And the first place Tinglan had raced to support was Moongaze Lake...

'Which means Chen Yin was left with no assistance.'

A bitter taste filled Li Ximing's mouth, but he didn't know how to respond to her. He could only walk forward in silence, heading deeper into the mountain. They soon arrived at a high platform where clouds and wind converged. Sixteen long staircases ascended it from each of the four cardinal directions, and the opposing forces of water and fire, yin and yang, bloomed with a hazy, multicolored light.

Kuang Yu bowed, produced a talisman, and floated it toward the high platform as a formal request. A moment later, a woman descended from the platform. She was beautiful, draped in a misty red gauze that hinted at the snow-white skin beneath. She whispered,

"Daoist Master Zhaojing, please follow me."

Kuang Yu smiled and nodded at her, then stepped aside. Li Ximing already sensed something was wrong. He discreetly sized up the woman before him and braced himself, following her forward.

The sixteen steps passed in an instant. At the top of the platform, a middle-aged man was sitting cross-legged. He was quite handsome, and his eyes were tightly closed, as if in silent cultivation. He was likely a capable junior.

The main hall beyond was deep and dark, lit by thirty-two tall bronze lamps. Each lamp was tall and branched, with two or three smaller lamps perched on each branch, swaying like small birds. He took another step forward and looked up.

A young man was standing on the high seat!

He was tall and powerfully built, handsome and unrestrained. He wore no opulent robes, only a simple, thin white robe, open at the front to reveal his strong chest and abdomen. A long, wide sash was tied at his waist, its ends trailing on the floor like a coiling golden snake.

He was fully focused on adjusting the wick of a bronze lamp, his profile to the hall entrance. The flickering light cast his nasal bridge in sharp, high relief. His eyes were the color of dark gold, as if forged from bronze.

Li Ximing was stunned.

'Diyan... This Great Daoist Master is no simple character.'

After all, both Guo Nanwu and Daoist Master Xuanyi had spoken of him as a "Venerable Daoist Master," making him sound benevolent and near the end of his lifespan. Li Ximing had been expecting an old man like Lingdu. This sudden disparity was jarring. The young man turned his head. In the dark hall, his bronze eyes seemed demonic. He smiled.

"And who might you be, standing there in the hall? Come in and speak."

"Junior Zhaojing of Ting Province, greets Senior Diyan!"

Li Ximing stepped inside, his heart thumping. He felt a vague sense of discomfort.

This place felt like being trapped within sweltering earth veins. The flickering bronze lamps were like springs of terrestrial fire, forcefully spewing dawn light thick with Molten Fire. The light was almost tangible, brushing against his cheeks with the metallic clang of striking iron.

This Great Daoist Master... cultivated 'Dawn Qi'. Dawn Qi and Bright Yang were incompatible, so the aura naturally made him extremely uncomfortable.

Li Ximing froze for that brief instant, his heart pounding. Diyan, however, stepped down from the dark red radiance. His eyes, like burnished bronze, fixed on him.

"The title of 'Senior'... I dare not accept it. My surname is Yin, and my given name is Huan. If Your Highness must address me, it would be better to use my name."

Li Ximing then understood that his first "殿下" (dianxia) was indeed meant as "Your Highness." Before he could say more, the Great Daoist Master had already turned and led him into the depths of the hall. He sat on the steps below the main throne and gestured.

There wasn't a single jade table or chair in the entire magnificent hall. Li Ximing had no choice but to sit with him. Daoist Master Diyan smiled.

"It has been many years since I've seen an Imperial Descendant. How have we become so estranged?"

Li Ximing looked up, startled. Daoist Master Diyan was staring straight at him, his level voice cutting through the dense Dawn Qi light.

"The former Immortal Emperor Gong Xu slew Tu Shuyang, taking his scaled armor and his two _bo_. He left a descendant, enfeoffing him in the land of Li. Thus, he was named Boli. His heir rendered great service in pacifying the Long region to the west, so King Zhou granted him domain over Guanlong, to rule the Six Surnames, becoming Wei."

The intense dawn light crashed down. Diyan continued in a haunting voice, 

"The Six Surnames warred against the other states, accumulating merit. My Yin Clan was one of the Six Surnames. My ancestor, Yin Ni, was granted the title of King Zhaoming and cultivated the Dawn Qi Dao."

Most of Li Ximing's confusion was instantly resolved. He remained silent for a long time.

'So what?'

'The Wei State has been destroyed for years. The Long Wei, the Donghuo... which of them wasn't stronger than the solitary Li Zhouwei? Those who were loyal have already shown their loyalty! Even the Cui Clan, which was once granted the position of two True Monarchs, hesitated and watched from the sidelines. If Li Zhouwei hadn't personally paid them a visit, they would still be observing... What of the other so-called Six Surnames?'

'As a Great Daoist Master, he couldn't possibly be unaware of the conspiracies between the north and south. He must know of Mount Luoxia's plans. If he truly holds any loyalty, it should be to the Wei Emperor. Why would it fall to me?'

In his current situation, encountering an old acquaintance of the Wei State only made Li Ximing more wary. He remained respectful on the surface.

"So we are old friends from our ancestors' time. Junior is endlessly grateful that the Great Daoist Master still remembers these old ties."

Diyan seemed unsurprised. He stared at him quietly and smiled.

"It seems the Cui Clan talks a big game, but ultimately amounts to nothing... That's normal, too. Yangya is a reclusive coward. He would never dare to get close to you. It seems he has thoroughly disappointed Your Highness."

Li Ximing couldn't discern his intentions and didn't dare to be careless. He stood up and said in a low voice,

"Senior misunderstands!"

He spoke solemnly.

"The Bright Yang lineage has suffered many setbacks, rising and falling three times. The Cui Clan has been loyal and filial, aiding us with all their strength all three times, exhausting their foundation to the point of bare survival..."

"Even so, when I went to pay my respects, the Cui Clan was still generous, taking out their cultivation arts for me. They have already done everything they possibly could! Later, when Daoist Master Yangya recalled his clan disciples... he had no other choice."

Li Ximing intentionally said a little extra, trying to test the Great Daoist Master's reaction. As expected, the man's face, which had been as placid as an old well, shifted the moment he finished speaking. His brow twitched.

Diyan's eyes narrowed slightly, a flicker of emotion—anger like a raging current beneath ice—surfacing for just an instant. His tone turned cold.

"Cui Yushan has some nerve."

His words were light, but they caused the bronze lamps throughout the hall to flicker, and a terrifying aura began to emerge. Li Ximing broke out in a cold sweat, a dreadful guess flashing through his mind.

'I heard this Daoist Master passed the stage of Purple Mystery long, long ago. Could it be...'

Diyan was already on his feet, standing with his hands behind his back, looking at him again. His voice was calm but powerful.

"Longhu, the North and South, Wuzhe—none of them can be trusted. Even the current Yang Clan is only capable of cowardly compromises, trying to turn major problems into minor ones and minor ones into nothing. When the critical moment arrives, they won't hesitate for a second to betray King Wei."

Evidently, this Great Daoist Master was no fool. Li Ximing had only prodded slightly, but he had easily detected the test. Diyan said softly,

"Your Highness need not be suspicious. The Six Surnames have fallen. There is no outstanding talent among them. Even the Cui Clan, descendants of a True Monarch, has been reduced to this state. To put it bluntly, in this day and age, the only person King Wei and you can trust is me."

His gaze was intense as he emphasized,

"Only me."

Li Ximing raised his head. He moved his lips, finally asking the question that had been buried in his heart for years.

"Back then, Hengzhu..."

Diyan said softly, "That's right. I was the one who sent Kuang Yu for the Radiant Sky Stone. Without her persuasion, it would never have fallen into Your Highness's hands—even if Tu Longjian had intervened, the Radiant Sky Stone that reached you would not have been the real one."

Li Ximing snapped his eyes shut.

He had harbored this suspicion for more than a day. It was true that Tu Longjian had helped him obtain the Radiant Sky Stone, but now, as a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of many years, he understood the true value of a Purple Mansion spiritual item... How could the Hengzhu Dao, even as a righteous path, simply allow two Purple Mansion spiritual items to fall into the hands of a mere Foundation Establishment Realm clan...

Li Ximing finally met his gaze. After a long time, he asked, "Senior, what is your current cultivation level?"

Diyan's gaze was like iron, like radiance. He stared straight at Li Ximing, his voice quiet and steady. 

"When King Zhaoming received his title, the 'Dawn Qi' Dao was perfected. 'Plea to Supplant the Night' is its vestment, the dawn light honoring the Bright Yang's brilliance. 'Blazing Return' is its mandate, the subject's heart revering the Emperor's majesty. I cultivate 'Stifling Bitterness' for self-reflection, and 'Pavilion of Bestowed Blessings' for edicts..."

As he spoke, one ray of dawn light after another lit up above his head. One held the might of the rising sun, killing frost and stilling water. Another held the mystery of supplanting the night, quietly submerging the Celestial Yang. Rolling colors converged at his side, filling the entire hall, igniting all thirty-six bronze lamps at once, turning everything an unbearable, brilliant white!

Even though the power wasn't directed at him, the might of these four divine abilities was still terrifying. Li Ximing, standing within it, felt a sharp, stinging sense of crisis wash over his face. But the man before him wasn't finished.

Something suddenly leaped from that brilliant white light. Golden-white stone bricks materialized one after another, fitting together perfectly. A towering city gate rose, covered in profound patterns. All the light contracted inward, revealing a shimmering, hazy radiance within, directly facing a blazing sun. To the right was 'Radiance Forged into Glory', and to the left, 'Brightness Culminating in Splendor'!

Radiant Origin Pass!

"With the 'Radiant Origin Pass' as the northern gate of the Celestial Dynasty!"

"Thus, my divine abilities are perfected!"

The Diyan before him had perfected his divine abilities, possessing all five arts!

In that instant, all the Dawn Qi light softened, becoming as clouds and mist, as support and aid, all of it converging within that Origin Pass. The stinging sensation on Li Ximing's face vanished completely, replaced by a sense of affinity, like that of Li Fire.

Even the wild, untamable man himself seemed to soften. His bronze eyes stared at Li Ximing, a smile playing on his lips.

Li Ximing's eyes were filled with profound shock. He stood up, speaking in disbelief.

"Senior... you intend to use four Dawn Qi arts and one Bright Yang art... to attain the Dao?!"
