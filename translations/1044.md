# Chapter 1044: Immortals and Buddhists

Zong Chang’s words echoed in the night. Wei Xuanyin, his white robes fluttering in the breeze, watched her quietly and spoke in a low voice.

“Since you’ve brought up my disciple-nephew Qi… there’s no need to sound me out.”

“Qi Lanyan is indeed my disciple-nephew and a cultivator of the Profound Governance Pavilion, but he is also the head of the Qi family. What he does and how he does it are his own affairs. You know that Li Zhouwei’s hands are tied by his position in the Bright Yang, but how many people on either side of this river are truly their own masters? Everyone is trying to forge their own path. Where is there room for so much freedom?”

“I only learned of his arrangements on the riverbank a moment before you did.”

The Grand Preceptor of the Zhao State took a step forward, his expression finally showing a trace of complexity. His words were laden with meaning.

“He has found his own destined opportunity and wishes to change things. Perhaps he even thinks he is helping me. But from our perspective… what we seek is of such immense value that success means everything and failure means annihilation. The myriad threads of cause and effect are rooted in ourselves alone, unswayed by external forces.”

“And as for Li Zhouwei…”

His expression was solemn as he continued calmly, “He will eventually reach the same step as me, perhaps even seeking the metallic essence a step faster. I know, of course, that he is doomed. But the workings of heaven value that single thread of variance. If there is even the slightest possibility… that he truly succeeds under the watchful eyes of all and brings radiance to the world, then that is his skill. That is his Dao. I would congratulate him on attaining his rightful fruit and, admitting my loss, hold not a shred of resentment.”

Zong Chang stared at him coldly, her lips parting as if to speak, but she remained silent. Wei Xuanyin shook his head with a faint smile.

“You are cultivating the Veiled Yin, while I am seeking the Dao—that is the difference between us. The Dao I seek is one of yin and yang in harmony, of peace throughout the world. It would be better if Li Zhouwei attained his Dao. In fact, never mind Li Zhouwei; even if Li Qianyuan himself were resurrected, I would still pursue my path.”

The mountain fell silent. Wei Xuanyin took another step, his gaze fixed on Zong Chang.

“Fellow Daoist Zong, the Dao of the Veiled Yin is a mothering path; it should not bring ruin to living beings. I understand you wish to convert to the Buddhist cultivators, but their way is one of great indulgence. It feigns the release of desire, but in truth, it clutches the greatest desire of all to its heart. If you join them, you will be nothing more than a weapon in another’s hand…”

“Better to cultivate the righteous path of the Immortal Dao. Perhaps there is still a chance for redemption.”

Zong Chang gave him a stunned look, then laughed with a hint of contempt.

“Wei Xuanyin, don’t you hold that immortal-seeking heart of yours a little too high? Do you think everyone was born into a great sect as you were? That we all practiced at Profound Governance, poring over the great Daoist Classics and enjoying boundless resources? Every word you speak today drips with freedom, but the very ground you stand on is built upon the bones and blood of the great families, common folk, and minor sects of Jizhong, who have been exploited by your Viewing Pavilion faction for a thousand years. We both hail from the State of Chen. Who do you think you can fool with that stench of yours?”

“Back then, I was just a minor cultivator in the Long region, hoping only for my family to live in peace. But every river-mulberry flower I grew was bought from me at a pittance by your people, who threw their weight around and bullied us. I had no choice but to leave my home. With nowhere left to turn, I killed for blood just to survive, and that is how I clawed my way to where I am today. If not for my master’s guidance, I would have been just another demonic cultivator in Long, living on borrowed time. When you cultivators of the Viewing Pavilion speak so grandly of seeking immortality, do you think I, Zong Chang, remain silent because I do not desire it?”

“And now you have the gall to lecture me. I bring ruin to living beings? Could it be because the seats of the righteous path have been occupied by you for a thousand years? Occupied so firmly, so impenetrably! The world turns to the Buddhists and the demons precisely because of the incompetence of your so-called righteous path, your so-called Immortal Dao!”

The woman’s face was like ice. She tossed aside the wine flask in her hand, her feigned demeanor vanishing. She rose to her feet and cursed,

“Wei Xuanyin! If you fail to attain your Dao, how will you ever show your face again?! All that will be left of the Viewing Pavilion are wine-sacks and rice-bags… the likes of Qi Lanyan and Yin Baiyue, who will do nothing but lord over others for a mere five hundred years! What good is that to this world?”

With a final, sharp flick of her sleeve, she stormed away, leaving a faint demonic wind lingering in the air. A desolate expression fell over Wei Xuanyin as he stood alone on the mountain, watching the moonlight spill across his robes.

He gathered all the light, drawing it into his sleeves. An unknown time passed before his figure, too, disappeared into the night.

---

Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain.

Temples stood in dense groves, their multicolored light forming a gentle mist. At the base of the mountain, the long flight of stairs was silent and deserted, shimmering with a glazed, colorful sheen. Two monks, one tall and one short, were making their way up the steps.

Maha Minghui wore a strange expression, his hands tucked into his sleeves. He smacked his lips, a bitter taste filling his mouth.

‘What a damn mess…’

Beside him, Mingxiang stood a full head taller. His jade-like face glowed with a faint crimson light. He rubbed his cheek as if in pain and looked at his disciple-brother’s distracted state, shaking his head with a chuckle.

“Minghui… look at your disciple-brother. I took a halberd strike from Li Zhouwei, and my cheek is still burning with Bright Yang. But you’re perfectly fine! Safe and sound.”

Minghui turned to look at him, a flicker of exasperation in his heart.

‘Why didn’t he just run you through…’

Despite his thoughts, Minghui simply shook his head and asked, “How is the White Qilin? I saw his injuries were not light.”

Mingxiang stroked his chin. “Far from it…”

A look of alarm crept into his eyes as he continued, “My three guardian treasures were refined in the incense burner for over three hundred years. My master said that these three items are no ordinary Enlightened Artifacts. Combined with my cultivation and spell arts, even an average mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would be no match for me… Yet he resisted them with ease. Even suppressed by that Li Fire Spiritual Treasure, the strength of his Dharma Body was clear to see.”

Mingxiang seemed regretful. “Somehow, he learned a Dharma Body from the Touba family. It looked familiar… The Touba hold three of the Twelve Dharma Bodies of Demonic Contemplation. It must be a variation of one of them.”

“That Dharma Body can suppress Dawn Qi. Otherwise, how could a treasure as renowned as the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform, which even Li Shu died beneath, only manage to inflict him with a body full of Dawn Qi?”

As Mingxiang sighed with great feeling, Minghui’s heart ached as if he had suffered a great loss. But Mingxiang just laughed and sent a telepathic message,

“Didn’t I handle it well? I even got revenge for you against Taixi… He’s not having a good time right now! It’s just a shame I couldn’t snatch a Spiritual Artifact or two back…”

“This outcome is for the best. Though the White Qilin was cornered and forced to endure our attacks, he wasn’t pushed to fight to the death. Taixi took the brunt of the losses… We, on the other hand, are doing just fine.”

Minghui pressed his palms together, crying ‘what a sin’ in his heart. They took a few more steps and saw the monk Yanbai descending the mountain. He nodded to the pair and said in a low voice,

“Thank you for your hard work!”

Feeling a pang of guilt, Minghui nodded silently. In truth, with the Martial Cultivation Star shining brightly and the troops storming the banks being from the Way of Great Desire, he had had little impact on the casualties of either side. But he had a thick skin and felt no shame, returning the greeting with a smile.

Yanbai, however, added casually, “The great one in the hall just saw me to ask about the situation on the lake shore. Now it is your turn, fellow Daoist. Please.”

Hearing this, Minghui’s eyes flew open, his mind instantly clearing.

‘A great one? Someone has arrived? And they want to question me?’

He was startled and alarmed, but managed a strained smile.

“Thank you for informing me, Great Monk…”

Yanbai’s face was expressionless.

“They are all watching you. Go on in.”

A cold sweat broke out on Minghui’s brow. Beside him, Mingxiang’s eyes sharpened.

“Which great one?” he demanded in a low voice. “And why would they need to see my disciple-brother?”

Without another word, Yanbai turned and walked away. Minghui had no choice but to push his disciple-brother aside.

“Fortunately,” he said with a wry smile, “this won’t involve you.”

He then strode forward, passing through a corridor shimmering with brilliant light. Pushing open a pair of massive golden doors, he was met with a breathtaking sight. Golden pillars soared to the heavens, the ceiling was a canvas of radiant light, and the floor was as clear as crystal. In the center of the hall sat a large bronze cauldron. Flanking it were countless Dharma Bodies of all sizes, arrayed in various poses. Densely packed, they were organized by rank and status, their sizes reflecting their power, stretching from the entrance all the way to the main seat at the far end.

The solemnity of the occasion was clearly far greater than when Zhelu had presided. The golden figure on the highest throne was immense, touching the sky, its form seeming to dissolve into the heavens. Its massive hand was raised high, like a small mountain, the jade-white lines of its palm as distinct as ravines.

On a slightly lower seat to one side, however, sat the only normal-sized figure upon a tall golden lotus. He held a bowl in his hands, studying it intently as if no one else existed.

‘They’ve connected to the Buddhist Land… Jiang Toushou is here too. This is trouble…’

With just a single glance, Minghui dropped to his knees with a thud and kowtowed.

“Minghui pays his respects to the great virtuous ones!”

The hall was utterly silent, save for the gurgling sound from the bronze cauldron. After what felt like an eternity, the colossal golden figure stirred, its voice booming through the chamber.

“Jiang Toushou… this is Minghui.”

Minghui knew full well that the one seated on the main throne was the master of the Sea of Desire and the Way of Great Desire, Tian Langzhi, also known as Maha Liangli. His scheme against Taixi had been subtle, but there was no way a being like this wouldn’t know!

He couldn't help but raise his eyes slightly. He saw that the bronze cauldron before him was filled with boiling oil, and a person was thrashing within it, their skin split and flesh raw, white smoke rising from their body.

‘Five-Eyed.’

The one in the cauldron was none other than the Five-Eyed Merciful One!

This was no ordinary pot. Once inside, all divine abilities were sealed, rendering one a mere mortal unable to use spell arts for protection. The pain of being deep-fried was bone-deep. The sight made Minghui’s eyelids twitch.

‘He slacked off too… but I have my master and the Way of Joyful Bliss as my backing. No matter what, there has to be a trial… But Zhelu is incompetent. How could he possibly protect him? Of course he’d end up in the boiling oil!’

As Minghui pondered this, the man in the sky spoke again, his tone indifferent.

“You’re too polite, Liangli. I know of him.”

Tian Langzhi laughed, his voice flat.

"The battle went poorly… Not only did we fail to secure any benefits, but we also lost the Maha of the Way of Emptiness. From what I hear of the situation, it seems Maha Minghui held a grudge against him and secretly plotted his demise.”

“I have long heard that the disciples of that one from the Lotus Temple are all unusually close to the Immortal cultivators. They were reprimanded for it at Mount Dayang, and it seems nothing has changed. The Lotus Temple is ineffective.”

At these words, Jiang Toushou raised his eyebrows, looking down from his great height.

“Mingxiang, at least, tried his best. This Minghui… he is famously reckless. He should have been punished at Mount Dayang, barred from returning… or even executed to embarrass Jinlian. But now that he holds the rank of Maha, he is a significant figure in the Way of Joyful Bliss. It wouldn’t be proper to execute him.”

Minghui listened with a mixture of fear and confusion, not daring to overthink it. Panic began to set in.

‘What is going on? Why are they talking about beating and killing!’

What they said wasn't wrong. He, Minghui, had shirked his duties countless times. And while the Way of Emptiness was now jointly controlled, the losses hadn't truly damaged the foundation of the Way of Great Desire. Why were they being so severe?

‘This doesn’t feel like a punishment for slacking off. It feels more like I ruined someone’s grand plan… Qi Lanyan… his sudden transfer of manpower must have had a reason. It seems many people had schemes centered on this Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, and I’ve somehow damaged someone’s interests…’

But Tian Langzhi did not appreciate Jiang Toushou’s words and fell silent. The emissary from Mount Dayang smiled, his voice dropping to a whisper that only the two of them could hear.

“Liangli… have you heard about the Liao River? Of the disciples from back then… only one remains. After winding his way across the world, he has actually returned to the Liao River.”

Tian Langzhi’s expression changed, turning cold and sharp.

“Him? With a fate that precludes him from becoming a Dharma Master, how did he manage to walk right into a trap?”

Jiang Toushou shook his head grimly.

“It’s a long story… That fool who was the manifestation of Wrath… ran off to find him and was used to calculate the state of the Wrath Dharma Master. My lord also went to take part in the planning. That person… should be gone.”

“And since he’s gone, things are different. My lord and the one from the Murong family acted together and have temporarily fixed the location of the Buddhist Land. Now, it is a matter of who this heaven-sent opportunity will fall to…”

Tian Langzhi’s heart pounded. At the same time, realization dawned. “No wonder… I suspect the great one from my Dao is also busy with this matter. Otherwise, why would he let Peacock… alas!”

Jiang Toushou pursed his lips noncommittally.

“There are several candidates right now. The consensus among the great ones is… the Wrath position has been vacant for a long time, and the matter must be handled discreetly. But whoever we send in must be capable… I, for one, still think Yaosa Chengmi is worth a try…”

Tian Langzhi immediately understood.

“At the next Dharma Assembly, I will certainly recommend him.”

Jiang Toushou smiled and shook his head, continuing smoothly,

“It was precisely that fool’s actions that caused a great change in the successor of the Liao River. Now, not only is the Way of Discipline protecting him, but the Great Adoration Dharma Realm also values him greatly. Two of their leaders personally went to the Liao River, stirring up the entire situation…”

“Think about it. How many things are in motion right now? Gao Fu seems to have found his opportunity and has entered seclusion. The Purple Mystery has held him back for so many years, but he’s finally broken through. The power of the Qi region will rise again… and his relationship with our Daos is not good…”

“The Dragon-kin are in conflict with Compassion over the Hetian affair. Although Compassion has been powerful these past years, they still fear the Dragon-kin. The Great Adoration Dharma Realm is in a precarious position, and without the help of the Way of Joyful Bliss, things will be difficult going forward…”

Tian Langzhi shook his head slightly, a faint anger in his eyes. He replied in the same low voice,

“We need people at a time like this, but do we really need him? Gongsun Bei is inclined to side with us. I went to great lengths to persuade Qi Lanyan, and now this mess has made everything uncertain. How am I supposed to explain this to them!”

Jiang Toushou’s gaze was icy. “Qi Lanyan isn’t worried, so why are you, Liangli? If you want to kill the White Qilin, how can you do it without one or two great ones to suppress him? Right now, all the great ones are occupied elsewhere. This prize is so rich, you mustn’t go offending people carelessly!”

Hearing this, Tian Langzhi finally fell silent. Jiang Toushou placated him,

“It’s not that he can’t be killed. At worst, it’s just another fight with Jinlian… but Mingxiang is a diligent one. If the Way of Joyful Bliss throws down their responsibilities in protest, we will be the ones to suffer.”

Tian Langzhi closed his eyes for a long time, then suddenly sighed.

“If the mountain doesn’t intervene in this, what happens once will happen again. News of today’s events will surely reach the ears of every Dao. When they all send their people, won’t we have just been a stepping stone for them? I’m afraid we’ll have exhausted ourselves for nothing… only for another family to reap the benefits!”

His gaze was frigid as he lamented,

“Believe me, once the Murong family finishes with their business, even they will come south. With their strength, if they cannot convert Li Zhouwei, do you think they cannot convert the likes of Li Jiangqian?”
