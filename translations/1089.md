# Chapter 1089: Five Virtues and Five Manifestations

The undulating ranges of Mount Dayang were draped in azure and gold. Azure was the lush, vibrant forest, a tapestry of myriad forms. Gold was the brilliant, boundless splendor of the grand halls, their light shining like suns. Colossal statues stood sentinel between the peaks, completing the magnificent vista.

"The Zhao State... its court is in chaos, its mechanisms of control, both internal and external, have failed. The ruler is no ruler, the ministers no ministers. The territory is shattered. They cannot pacify the Yan-Liao region, nor can they stabilize Monan or reclaim the Long-Liang region. The various kings rule their own lands. Even Jiangbei, so recently reclaimed... is nothing but a bargaining chip for the Immortals and Buddhists."

"Consider the northern dynasties of generations past. The Zhou pioneered with kings, established the Hua states, and revitalized the Xia descendants. The Wei established an imperial line, pacified the east and west, and founded an celestial dynasty. The Liang expanded the borders, absorbing Mobei and Monan, their armies reaching the Northern Sea. It is truly difficult to say which was superior. But if one had to choose the most useless... today's Zhao State is undoubtedly the first."

"Yet here, in the heartland of Zhao, the ancient capital, there exists a paradise. That paradise is my Great Adoration Dharma Realm!"

The black-robed monk in the grand hall pressed his palms together, his expression serene. He plucked a flower and took his seat. Below, the assembled monks whispered amongst themselves in admiration. The monk merely kept his palms pressed, raising an eyebrow with a faint smile.

"That which the Immortals cannot govern, cannot manage, and cannot remedy... that is where we Buddhists shall be!"

The Buddhist cultivators all assumed expressions of deep, pained contemplation. One, however, rose from his seat and stepped forward. He had a kind and merciful face and was draped in a verdant green meditation robe. His expression was solemn as he asked:

"This junior cultivator has a doubt, one that has been buried in my heart for many years. Day after day, I cannot resolve it... I dare not resolve it. Seeing you, Great Virtue, come to preach the Dao today, my heart is filled with admiration. I must be so bold as to ask!"

The black-robed monk above nodded. The green-robed monk continued:

"I venture to ask the Great Virtue! Today, there are heretics who slander us, striking at the very root of the Buddhist Dao. They claim our foundation lies in 'gathering,' 'essence,' and 'position.' They call 'gathering' a 'collection,' 'essence' a 'splendor,' and 'position' a 'body.' By this logic, they claim that Buddhism is, in truth, just another form of Immortal cultivation! How... how should this be answered?"

The moment he spoke, the mountain forests trembled. Tigers and leopards roared. The sound of shattering fire-prisons and striking staves echoed from all around. The cultivators erupted in chaos, terrified by his blasphemous words. Yet the monk in the high seat merely clapped his hands and sighed.

"To stare at the position and invent a meaning... it is absurd to the extreme. What Immortal cultivators 'gain,' we 'lose.' The two are mutual expressions, an inside and an outside. Only an ignorant fool would try to conflate Immortals and Buddhists."

He rose to his feet, speaking with perfect ease.

"In ages past, during the great Dao debate at the Kongtong Sea, the Immortals spoke of Five Virtues and Five Manifestations. The Five Virtues are the horizontal, the Five Manifestations are the vertical. When horizontal and vertical interweave, they become the warp and weft of Heaven and Earth. That is the Great Dao."

His words were empowered by potent techniques, ensuring all could hear. They struck the courtyard like thunder and fire, seeming to stir the very fabric of the world. A relentless torrent of hail began to hammer the hall from outside, drawing the stunned Buddhist cultivators to watch.

"Heavenly Awakening further stated, The Five Virtues are solid; the Five Manifestations are empty. The height of the Virtues cannot surpass the Manifestations. One must follow, obey, and accept them. Thus, the Five Manifestations are the root of the Virtues, and the Virtues are the expression of the Manifestations. The pinnacle of the Virtues is 'solidity' and 'existence.' The pinnacle of the Manifestations is 'void' and 'emptiness.' Our cultivation lies in the Five Manifestations."

"This is the inner and outer!"

As he finished, the sound of thudding jade pearls filled the air. A white deer galloped past. Snow began to fall in the four corners of the realm, and beneath the snow, golden jade and precious pearls emerged, a scene of infinite prosperity. The monk spoke again,

"Thus, all perceptions and all forms are ultimately empty. It is only that the common man cultivating Buddhism cannot use emptiness to achieve Empty Attestation. So, the heterodox paths teach them to rely on 'offerings'â€”using form to make offerings to feeling, perception, impulse, and consciousness. This is using one emptiness to sustain four, one nothingness to sustain four, all in the seeking that all things are empty. All save a single point of truth, attested in the Chandana Forest... and this Chandana Forest is, itself, also empty!"

This declaration was like iron boulders, smashing into the stone floor and gouging deep dents, scattering everywhere. His direct claim that the Chandana Forest was empty caused blood to trickle from the ears and noses of the monks. The green-robed monk was thrown back nine steps before collapsing headfirst to the ground!

"Boom!"

Thick, dark clouds instantly materialized above the golden hall. A beam of auspicious light searched frantically, but it was blocked by the hall and could not descend. Disappointed, it quickly turned and scattered like the wind.

The green-robed Buddhist cultivator silently climbed to his feet, his heart pounding with terror.

'What... what manner of being is this!'

It was a long while before the scattered monks managed to stumble upright, each still feeling as if they bore the weight of iron, unable to move. Then, a long sigh cut through the silence.

"Martial Grand-Uncle Kongshu... is truly... his wisdom encompasses heaven and man! And he is so generous, so selfless!"

The one who sighed was none other than the Great Adoration Dharma Realm's own Maha Fachang.

This man had once been in Jiangbei, where he had single-handedly maintained a fragile peace for many years. Later, as the conflict between north and south intensified, he was driven back to the Dharma Realm. Cultivating here, his status was clearly profound.

Yet even for someone of his lofty origins, hearing such a discourse on the Dao filled him with a solemn awe. His mind felt infinitely liberated, yet simultaneously shrouded, as if by a single leaf, leaving him speechless.

He stepped down from his platform. The worries that had been piled high on his brow were forgotten, his mind consumed by contemplation. He looked up to see the black-robed monk raise an eyebrow, smiling.

"Fachang, what is this?"

The simple question shattered his mental barrier, pulling him back to the present. His anxieties rushed back in. Maha Fachang lowered his gaze.

"Reporting to Martial Grand-Uncle... it is news from the Way of Great Desire. That Maha Liangli Tian Langzhi... he wishes to recall Yaosa Chengmi!"

The black-robed monk pressed his palms together, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"That is only as it should be... is it not?"

Fachang remained silent.

The matter was not complicated. Years ago, Jiang Toushou had been ordered south to the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain to join forces with Maha Liangli Tian Langzhi of the Great Desire. The two had supposedly reached a consensus: the Way of Great Desire would release Yaosa Chengmi to participate in the affair concerning Wrath.

But this was hardly a favorable outcome for the Way of Great Desire. Mount Dayang was deeply invested in reviving Wrath and had orchestrated the entire affair. The figure they propped up was one of their own. If Yaosa Chengmi attained the Dao, he would undoubtedly seek to escape their control and align himself with Mount Dayang. How could he possibly remain subservient to the Great Desire?

Tian Langzhi had feigned agreement, only to ambush Jiang Toushou at the critical moment. The betrayal cost Jiang Toushou the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain and caused Mount Dayang's prestige to plummet...

Burning with rage, how could Jiang Toushou and the others possibly allow Yaosa Chengmi to return now?

'It's bound to be another internal struggle... The Way of Great Desire is growing stronger by the day. That great personage is facing increasing pressure from that peacock... He's already been forced to cede so much of the Way of Great Desire's power...'

A sorrowful look crossed Fachang's face. The black-robed monk did not press the issue.

"You returned quickly, Fachang. Did you witness the breakthrough of that cultivator from the ancient Woven Jade Dao?"

Fachang moved respectfully to his side, palms pressed.

"Reporting to Martial Grand-Uncle, I did."

"And how was it?"

Kongshu's question drew a sigh of deep emotion from Fachang.

"Formidable. Utterly formidable... Even the [Exiled Immortal's Resentful Abode] took some time to supress him. In my opinion, if he were given just a little more time to recover, he might not have lost to Guanyu or Li Yuanwei..."

Kongshu merely shook his head.

"I have never personally witnessed the events of ancient times, but from your words, this current affair is causing just as great a stir."

"Naturally!" Fachang's expression was complex. "After I watched his breakthrough, I journeyed straight back to the Dharma Realm. I spent three years discussing the Dao with Great Tushou before departing to return here. I only just received new information. It is said that just before his death, he consumed a pill... a very powerful pill."

"For some reason, the Exiled Immortal's Resentful Abode did not sever his connection to the world. It seemed to be using him for some purpose. As a result, every word he spoke was leakedâ€”he directly proclaimed that the Chunyi Dao Gate was innocent... Who knows what that is about?"

Kongshu's gaze flickered, as if he understood something.

'The path of Immortal cultivation... the Supreme is without emotion. Master once mentioned... he said the Chunyi Dao Gate was merely a tool for probing. It was likely for the sake of the Supreme Yin. That pill... its delivery was ingenious. If he refused to take it, one of his descendants would. And it might not even be a descendant of the Chunyi Dao Gate.'

Seeing him lower his gaze in silence, Fachang waved his sleeve, dismissing the many disciples from the hall.

"Was there something unusual?"

The black-robed monk narrowed his eyes slightly. He was remarkably handsome, but not with the delicate, statue-like beauty common among Buddhist cultivators. His was a heavy, profound elegance, like that of a worldly and romantic elder. The narrowing of his eyes only made him seem more imposing.

"I discussed the Dharma with Master for thirty years. We once spoke of the Woven Jade Dao."

The 'Master' he spoke of was no ordinary figure! It was the current Realm Lord of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, a being at the Dharma Master level! Hearing this, Fachang stood bolt upright in shock and bowed.

"This junior cultivator respectfully listens to your teachings!"

Kongshu's lips were crimson, his teeth like pearls, and his eyes bright. "It is the True Method of the Wall-Below Woven Jade! Tracing its roots, it can be tracked to a great cultivator of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Traditionâ€”True Monarch Yuanxia."

"When the Three Profound Great Daos first appeared in the world, various Immortal Lords accepted disciples. Three of those disciples attested their Daos in the Three Yins. The first was True Monarch Yuanxia of Encompassing Profoundity. The second was True Monarch Guanhu of Comprehending Profoundity. The third, also of Comprehending Profoundity, was True Monarch Shoulou."

His voice was deep.

"True Monarch Shoulou attested in the auxillary of Veiled Yin. True Monarch Guanhu attested in the auxillary of Lesser Yin. The former's disciple, Loutai Min, and the latter's disciple, Xu Che, became the ancestors of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao. That is the origin of Lord Wei's Dharma lineage!"

"This Lord Xu Che... his innate talent is unmatched today, but back then, it was considered the lowest of the low. True Monarch Guanhu cherished him and sought an alternative Dharma Art. Finally, from the hands of True Monarch Yuanxia... he obtained this very True Method of the Wall-Below Woven Jade! He had him switch to cultivating as a Lesser Yin Woven Jade Immortal. This has been passed down as a celebrated tale ever since."

"The lineage held by the Chunyi Dao Gate, which resembles the True Method of the Wall-Below Woven Jade, was passed down from the Green Pine Temple. It must have been obtained from Lord Yingze."

Fachang's brows shot up. He was exceptionally bright. Hearing the mention of Wei Xuanyin and the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao, he instantly understood. He lowered his gaze, his expression serious.

"So, this method is common to all three Yin Daoist Traditions. As expected of a method passed down from a True Monarch of the Three Profound Dao. Truly extraordinary!"

He offered this praise before voicing his doubt.

"Martial Grand-Uncle... are you saying that Wei Xuanyin... also possesses the True Method of the Wall-Below Woven Jade!"

Kongshu's expression grew taut.

"He must..."

Fachang pressed his palms together and sighed.

"But he cultivated Veiled Yin. I heard he intends to hurl himself against it... There is no one above to guide him. How can he..."

Before he could finish, the sky filled with golden qi. Gray fire descended like rain, forming into the shapes of birds and sparrows, all converging on the mountaintop. The phenomenon forcibly cut off his words, causing both monks to raise their heads in unison.

They watched as a rain of fiery ashes, all shaped like birds, filled the skyâ€”a magnificent, imposing sight!

A figure walked out from within the swirling gray fire. He was tall, with exceptionally narrow eyes and pale red pupils. A sash of green silk was tied at his waist. In the center of his brow, a golden lotus mark glowed brightly. The mere act of him standing there caused the illusory, colorful light of the entire mountain range to tremble and freeze.

Fachang was horrified.

"Sparrow Carp Fish!"

This was, astonishingly, Sparrow Carp Fish, who had claimed the guest position of True Qi!

"He emerged from seclusion so soon!"

Back then, Sparrow Carp Fish had gone south. Relying on years of meticulous scheming, he had successfully entered the guest position of True Qi, becoming the vessel for the reincarnation of True Qi known as 'curbing indulgence with righteous nature.' Not only had he achieved his seventh reincarnation, but his already considerable fate had soared to terrifying new heights.

Buddhist cultivators had flooded south like a river of carp, too numerous to count, all hoping to claim a piece of the great tide and elevate themselves to a supreme position. Most, however, had been crushed and broken. To this day, the only one to have gained anythingâ€”and the one who had gained the most... was him.

Now, his bearing was that of a supreme cultivator. His face was white as jade, the lotus mark on his brow a clear sign of an extremely high-level Dharma body. The sound of Dharma conchs echoed around him, as if he could command all present to bow in worship at any moment. His arrival caused all the surrounding peaks to turn their gazes and break into hushed whispers.

How could Fachang fail to see what this meant?

'I fear even the Undefeated King of Brightness of old... was no more than this! As long as the Way of Great Desire's Buddhist Land has a seat for him, it is almost certain he will become a new Dharma Master!'

'In the current Buddhist Land, who below the rank of Dharma Master dares to challenge him?'

Even with Fachang's exceptional composure, he couldn't hide his shock. All of Mount Dayang erupted, the air filled with the sound of bowing.

"Greetings, Lord!"

Sparrow Carp Fish's gaze swept impassively over Mount Dayang, his expression flat. Only when his eyes met Kongshu's did he nod slightly in acknowledgment.

He descended from the sky step by step, landing in the main hall. With a casual wave of his hand, he plucked a figure from the mountain below. It was, surprisingly, the green-robed disciple who had asked the question earlier, his features now appearing fresh and refined. It was Yaosa Chengmi.

As he acted, all the Buddhists on Mount Dayang lowered their heads. Not one dared to speak.

The youth with the golden lotus on his brow stood with his hands clasped behind him, his aura lofty and aloof. His gaze was cold as he spoke.

"My Way of Great Desire has issued summons for its disciple time and time again. I wonder... who has been obstructing this?"

He glanced around. He saw that Kongshu, the only one who might have intervened, was staring at him with a strange intensity, but remained silent. Sparrow Carp Fish sneered, understanding perfectly.

'That Lord has advanced another step. This group of Mount Dayang masters would never dare cause trouble over a minor Merciful One... And this Kongshu is a Dao-maniac. Why would he ever involve himself in such matters?'

With a flick of his sleeve, he stepped into the Great Void. Behind him, Yaosa Chengmi appeared perfectly respectful, bowing.

"Lord, you have liberated me from the sea of suffering!"

Sparrow Carp Fish looked back, his expression playful.

"Liberated? Not necessarily. I'm taking you back this time to be delivered into our Lord's stomach!"

Yaosa Chengmi was a figure who had emerged from the affair of Luoxia herding the Bright Yang. His fate was extraordinary, and many had coveted him for a long time. Yet, hearing these words, his expression did not change. He smiled.

"This junior cultivator respectfully accepts!"

Sparrow Carp Fish smiled, his eyes narrowed. He raised a hand, as if performing a divination. Only when golden lotuses began to bloom brilliantly beneath his feet did he continue,

"My Lord has a joyous occasion today. It has been calculated that he shall become pregnant with three sons. I must trouble you to take a trip into our Lord's stomach. You will wait there for six years, and then you shall be born from the Merging Fire!"

...

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

Colors swirled through coiling clouds and mist. The courtyard was bathed in clean, bright light, a jade well gleaming in its center. A jade box sat before the door, holding three or five letters, new and old, jumbled together. They looked as if they had not been touched in a very long time.

The spiritual energy of the realm flowed freely. A violently fluctuating aura poured from the doorway, only to be swiftly pacified by the balanced yin-and-yang presence of the world. The blood-red light that streamed through the door dissolved into patches of sunset-colored radiance, neutralized and dispersed.

The door itself trembled faintly. From within, one could hear the indistinct sounds of battle cries and marching armies, echoing and overlapping.

"Creak."

As the courtyard door was gently pushed open, all sound and light ceased. The moon-lamp flickered. The stone bricks were immaculate. On the couch, a green-black gauze curtain swayed in the breeze. It was a tranquil, cool night in the small courtyard.

The hand on the door gave a firm push, and the man stepped out. His golden pupils reflected a hellscape of broken blades and shattered halberds, mountains of corpses and seas of baleful energy. An endless Celestial Yang set upon a blood-red desert, and in the heart of that blood, a single point of radiance.

"Crimson Severing Arrowhead!"

He exhaled slowly, the vision in his eyes retracting.

"...Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm... achieved today!"
