# Chapter 1257: As Before

As the southern gateway to Luoxia, Xiangxiang was populous and rich in spiritual resources, so it naturally hosted even more cultivators. Today, the esteemed Daoist Master Lu of Gu Prefecture had come to preach the Dao, drawing a sea of people that filled the entire city.

Lu Fu sat upon the Jade Terrace, like an immortal deity moving amidst an aura of golden qi.

Yet in that very instant, the multicolored lights of divine abilities twinkling in the sky vanished. A rolling crimson tide submerged the horizon. The divine ability did not envelop the common folk and cultivators on the ground, but it laid itself bare across the heavens. It was as if an endless desert of blood had appeared in the sky, with smoke and sand churning and the setting sun hanging low.

This hazy red light fell into every pair of dazed pupils.

‘It is not too late to verify this now.’

The voice was deep, steady, and exceedingly magnetic, transmitted through the Great Void to everyone’s ears. Within the great prefecture of Luoxia, there was naturally no shortage of knowledgeable people; these disciples of esteemed families raised their heads in a daze and looked toward the sky.

‘What else is there to verify?’

The blood-desert churned, long trails of smoke stretched across the sky, a dying sun cast its pall, and the clamor of armies rang out.

Crimson Severing Arrowhead.

This crimson light, like blooming blood-amber, shimmered in tens of millions of pupils. Their stupor lasted only a moment before being replaced by boundless, unending terror and panic.

The fame of Crimson Severing Arrowhead was of course resounding, but for a long time, those who had mastered the art were few and far between. The Li Jieyi of yesteryear was a descendant of the Bright Yang lineage with outstanding talent who had entered the Great Dao of Comprehending Profoundity, yet he still hit a wall when faced with this art; he cultivated bitterly to no avail, so much so that he was ultimately forced to become the Maha Vast Cicada!

Whose divine ability could this possibly be?

Only one person roamed the north and south with it now!

‘That King of Wei!!’

No matter how impossible the conclusion, the divine ability manifesting across the sky had already revealed everything: this King Wei, the White Qilin who had shattered Jianghuai, had come north alone and now stood silently upon the soil of Xiangxiang, coldly watching this Daoist Lu critique his divine ability.

The people on the high platform exchanged glances, a chill running down each of their spines as if they had just brushed past the Underworld. Yet they had no time to savor this terror, as a more dangerous problem was already upon them.

This King of Wei couldn't possibly be here to discuss the Dao with Lu Fu, could he?

‘A Purple Mansion Realm duel!’

In the next instant, the entire Jade Terrace shattered like exploding pottery, erupting with countless streaks of escaping light in all directions. Every single cultivator mounted their dharma artifacts and fled for their lives into the distance, with no fewer than a hundred of them erupting in resplendent bloody light.

They had already resorted to secret arts that damaged their own cultivation!

These thousands of fleeing figures were like a tidal wave in the desert. A terrifying pressure spread everywhere. The streets were thrown into chaos, and the common people had nowhere to hide, able to do nothing but fall to their knees, not daring to move. Only a woman stood silently amidst the tide, clutching a Spiritual Treasure, allowing the light of the Supreme Yin to slowly envelop her body.

She raised her head, earnestly observing the sky.

Besides her, someone else stood unmoving.

Lu Fu.

The Daoist Master stood somewhat rigidly within the blood-desert under the setting sun, his eyes wide with a trace of disbelief. His gaze was locked on that enormous setting sun. For a moment, he even thought he had fallen victim to some prank or illusion.

‘Wasn't Li Zhouwei afflicted by the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth?’

But he had no time to respond. The golden light before him was magnifying at a terrifying rate. Lu Fu’s spiritual sense told him with absolute clarity that this was Crimson Severing Arrowhead.

‘And it's an extremely profound technique... on the level of the Wei Emperor's direct lineage...’

At this moment, Daoist Master Lu knew not whether to feel bitter or pained, but the pride of being from the Lu clan's direct line and the dignity he shared as a master of a divine ability allowed his expression to only shift slightly. He brought his hands together before him, and all color coalesced in his palms, summoning forth a golden tripod.

At first, this treasure was no larger than a fingernail, but it grew rapidly amidst the vast golden qi. Yet what came faster was that long halberd. The piercing tip of the halberd flickered with an incomparably dazzling radiance. The golden tripod only had time to swell to the size of a fist before it was struck with a resounding clang.

‘Too fast...’

Not only was Li Zhouwei wielding Crimson Severing Arrowhead, but he was also empowered by Sovereign's Perilous Tread, the scales of his armor glowing like flames. Although Li Zhouwei's current aura was different from the roiling power he exhibited in past perils, how could he possibly be underestimated?

Back then, even Changyun had been unable to react in time to a full-powered strike from Li Zhouwei. Lu Fu, also a practitioner of Geng Metal but with a lower cultivation level and fewer preparations than Changyun, had no hope of dodging.

In an instant, the golden tripod was sent flying like a comet. The golden halberd's edge pierced through Lu Fu's chest, shattering all his spell arts, and exited from the back of his dharma body. The crescent-shaped blade then carried his body aloft, rushing toward the sky.

Lu Fu felt a chill rush to his head. Only now did a faint bitterness rise in his mouth. He felt as if his dharma body was being consumed by a raging fire, his entire being wracked with agony.

But he had, in the end, blocked it.

He clasped his hands together, golden light flowing smoothly. His divine ability responded, and all its power converged between his palms:

Present Departs Old!

Whether he was willing or not, whether his heart was filled with bitterness or sorrow, the words he had just spoken were now coming true one by one. Rolling golden qi poured from his palms, drizzling like autumn dew before erupting as an endless white mist, spreading out at a vast speed to cover all the crimson.

Lu Fu’s figure vanished.

Ever since Li Zhouwei had mastered Crimson Severing Arrowhead, his attacks had been invincible. Even Valley Water's Sunless Deceit could only linger within ten yards of him in a reluctant stalemate. Finally, a Daoist Master had managed to escape this divine ability, silently and without being broken.

Only a thick white fog was left lingering within the Crimson Severing Arrowhead. As Lu Fu escaped, the fog shed its previous gentle, dawn-like appearance and began to writhe and brandish its claws. The clash of weapons resounded, as if it intended to tear this blood-colored world to shreds!

And just like that, Lu Fu abruptly vanished from the halberd, stepping out to walk across the sky. The massive wound in his chest was slowly shrinking, but his face remained grave.

In that instant, the setting sun dipped below the horizon, and the bloody desert faded away.

The King of Wei, however, remained where he was, even though the Jade Terrace was empty and Lu Fu was already far off in the sky.

‘So that's what makes Present Departs Old so powerful...’

It was close to his guess; Present Departs Old did indeed have an escape capability. But unlike Valley Water, this divine ability's escape left behind a lingering autumn rain within the world of Crimson Severing Arrowhead. This rain of Geng Metal transformation continuously wore down the aura of Crimson Severing Arrowhead and, more importantly, obstructed its Light of Karmic Dissolution and Pure Yin!

Li Zhouwei's figure, which should have appeared behind Lu Fu like a sliver of heavenly light, was now still rooted to the spot.

Yet this Daoist Master Lu showed not a hint of pride. Seeing Li Zhouwei's contemplative expression, he felt a chill creep further down his spine.

His saying "the outcome is yet unknown" did not mean he actually wanted to fight Li Zhouwei—at least not one-on-one! This White Qilin was likely on par with a Great Daoist Master. Even if he was a descendant of the two Lu patriarchs, without access to cultivation in a Grotto-Heaven, he was ultimately a secular disciple. Facing this man meant risking his life!

But this King of Wei would not wait for him. The thoughtful expression was merely an afterimage; an intense golden light was already rushing toward him. The shadow of a qilin leaped forth, like a ferocious beast pouncing upon him.

Sovereign's Perilous Tread!

Lu Fu certainly knew that the divine abilities of the Bright Yang lineage were unreasonable, just as unreasonable as the Wei Emperor himself. When they charged, they were simply unstoppable. Even with his many techniques at his disposal, he could only raise his hand and grit his teeth.

"Profound Golden Light of Excellent Virtue, by imperial command!"

A brilliant radiance lit up from his palm. Li Zhouwei likewise raised two fingers, holding them before him. There was no great display of power, only a single, brilliant, clear, and bright flame dancing upon them.

Radiant Fire—Southern Emperor's Profound Snare!

The Great Void around Lu Fu trembled violently as Li-Light erupted from all four directions—above, below, left, and right. Golden locks intertwined, forming a net of golden chains that imprisoned him where he stood. Although the mysterious light of Metal Virtue burst forth, it only produced a fierce dissolving sound as it passed through the net, scattering in all directions.

In this exchange where Radiant Fire countered Geng Metal, Lu Fu was suddenly at a disadvantage!

And against Li Zhouwei, every mistake was potentially fatal.

Because in the next instant, a kaleidoscope of colors exploded before his eyes, leaving his mind dizzy and muddled, as if infinite heavenly lights were shooting through it. He could not even see the scene before him clearly.

Pure Yang Bracelets.

Li Zhouwei's figure was already before him.

In a flash, all the illusions in Lu Fu's eyes faded away. His body became like flying sand, and in an instant, he escaped from the golden net, simultaneously breaking free from two of Li Zhouwei's greatest killing tools. He shifted a step, narrowly avoiding the whistling halberd!

‘Hm?’

A look of surprise finally rose in Li Zhouwei's eyes as he watched Lu Fu retreat several yards, riding a flickering white light. This Daoist Master was, after all, of the Lu family's direct lineage; he had a few tricks up his sleeve. He drew his sword with a flourish and shouted sharply:

"Go!"

In an instant, the sword transformed into a sky full of flying feathers, descending upon Li Zhouwei like a world-sweeping storm. It was as if countless golden sparrows were circling in the air, clanging and striking against his dharma body. Li Zhouwei finally let out a muffled grunt, but his eyes shone with astonishing brightness.

He simply endured the sky full of golden feathers, brought two fingers to his lips, and ignited that bright flame of his life-mandate.

It was still the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare.

Lu Fu's expression changed slightly.

Golden Li-Light erupted from all around him. The value of this art lay in its instantaneous arrival, making it difficult to block. Even though he was prepared, he was still temporarily locked down by the overlapping waves of Li-Light.

And Li Zhouwei, his armor gleaming, had already activated the divine Primal Molt and strode forward.

As a divine ability of his spiritual armor, it was one of Li Zhouwei's only two escape methods. Although it was inferior to the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, taking advantage of Lu Fu's distraction to cross the distance of the spell art was more than enough!

But this time, facing Li Zhouwei, Lu Fu failed to transform into scattered white mist. Instead, he was solidly locked within, frantically activating his divine ability as his Daoist robes transformed into a brilliant gold:

Heavenly Gilded Helm!

‘As expected!’

Li Zhouwei, however, began to laugh.

‘The Valley Water divine ability could only break my suppression, and even it had to pause for a moment against the Pure Yang Bracelets. If your Present Departs Old could dissolve all divine abilities and escape all dangers, what need would there be for Valley Water!’

"The so-called Present Departs Old is to depart from the old and establish the new. While it can respond to all things, once you enter a perilous situation and flee, you cannot return to it!"

‘Since you have 'departed the old,' you must maintain that state. You just escaped the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare only to fall into it again, greatly damaging your momentum. You can't break free a second time! The same applies to the Pure Yang Bracelets!’

The golden eyes, now at arm's length, were filled with mirth and cunning. The King of Wei's expression was serene yet glacial:

"Daoist Friend Lu, I've figured it out."

In that instant, Lu Fu's heart felt as if it had been plunged into ten-thousand-year-old ice.

He of course understood what the other was saying.

His Present Departs Old was also from a top-tier divine ability, rare in the mortal world. When an ordinary enemy fought him, they would inevitably use a series of consecutive techniques. As long as the interval between two attacks was long enough, his divine ability would neutralize them one by one. Even some opponents who had fought him several times couldn't see the flaw!

‘Within a few moves, he has already seen through my divine ability... Such Dao-Profundity and Dao-wisdom would have made him a top-tier prodigy even before the world changed!’

Lu Fu had the illusion that he wasn't facing a cultivator of the same level, but a slow, methodical predator—a White Qilin toying with its prey.

‘He was truly just testing my divine ability!’

This filled his heart with a sense of powerlessness. Although he practiced many transformative and life-preserving arts, and was protected by Heavenly Gilded Helm and Present Departs Old, allowing him to survive most dangers with his life intact, and even had many techniques yet to be used, he also understood that with such a disparity in their divine abilities and Dao-Profundity, having his most crucial point seen through meant he had no strength left to fight back before this King of Wei.

‘Unless... I can master Breaking the Broken!’

In the next moment, his figure, like a brilliant golden meteor, streaked across the sky under the gazes of the assembled cultivators and crashed violently onto the Jade Terrace, kicking up flying sand and stones, and sending shards of jade everywhere!

Daoist Master Lu had been pinned to the ruins of the Jade Terrace by the long halberd!

The King of Wei stood beside him, poised silently in the air. His golden pupils shifted slightly, locking onto a certain point in the Great Void.

Then came his calm voice:

"If Daoist Friend Jiang does not act, this King is about to kill someone."

...

Yinling.

The lands of Yinling had low, narrow mountains and a long, turbid river. The air was frigid and grim. The Tao clan had resided here since the time of Great Liang, building up their estate for generations. It was now deeply entrenched, with every pavilion and tower exuding a noble and ancient air, reflecting a superior dignity.

Atop these hills stood a pavilion of white, chillingly cold jade, carved with profound and mysterious designs. The spiritual qi here was extremely abundant, forming a rolling white torrent that cascaded down, submerging the jade tables and chairs at the foot of the mountain, creating a scene like a celestial paradise.

A plaque hung above the pavilion, bearing three characters:

Yinling Pavilion.

A youth stood at the foot of the steps, his features refined and otherworldly, his eyes shining with a brilliant divine light, yet he stood there in silence. Beside him stood another man, dressed in worldly attire with his sleeves rolled up. He had a smiling face, and even his usual expression looked solicitous as he spoke:

"Jiexing... Senior... when will he emerge from seclusion..."

The youth with the brilliant eyes was none other than Tao Jiexing. At this moment, however, he seemed quite worried and sighed.

"It should be soon..."

Tao Jiexing seemed somewhat distracted, only saying:

"Senior Jia comes day after day, yet is always unable to see my elder. It inevitably makes this junior feel guilty..."

"I wouldn't dare!"

This Daoist Master Jia just smiled, a hint of hesitation in his eyes as he said:

"I just wanted to ask you, Daoist friend, I heard... that Lord Wei left instructions for you. I wonder... what are the arrangements..."

Tao Jiexing was taken aback and sighed inwardly.

The ancestors of the Jia and Wei families had also produced heroes, but they had since fallen into decline. The two families had been joined by marriage for many years, yet had produced only one Daoist Master, Jia Zan, whose talent wasn't particularly good. Unwilling to part with their former prestige and go out to seek opportunities, they could only endure year after year.

But now, things were different!

‘Great Song has broken through Jianghuai in one fell swoop, and the flames of war have reached the north. Xiangxiang is in the south; once the fighting starts, his two families will bear the brunt of it!’

If the days before could be endured with a measure of dignity, the trouble now was truly at their doorstep. Jia Zan naturally couldn't sit still any longer. For two of the last three years, he had been visiting Yinling, appearing very anxious.

Tao Jiexing, however, seemed somewhat unconcerned. He frowned and said:

"You... why must you be like this? You have the Wei family under you, and you yourself are a nephew of the Wei clan. Although Senior Wei died seeking the Dao, he was still a True Monarch's disciple no matter what. If you just ask a single question up on the mountain, no one will make things difficult for you..."

Jia Zan's brow lowered, and he sighed softly.

"Everyone says that, but my surname is Jia after all. The Wei bloodline down here on the mountain isn't pure, and the mountain doesn't like to make distinctions based on surnames. I can't even leverage this bit of connection, let alone appeal to any sentiment!"

Hearing this, a hint of displeasure flickered in Tao Jiexing's eyes. He said casually:

"Do they truly not make distinctions based on surnames?"

Although the words were somewhat veiled, they ultimately expressed dissatisfaction. Jia Zan simply lowered his head and smiled to himself, speaking softly:

"I just pulled some strings and managed to find that Martial Uncle Wang of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition. Before leaving, I asked him, and he said..."

"Senior Wang Ziya?"

Upon hearing "Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition," Tao Jiexing's eyes lit up. This Daoist tradition was rumored to have a True Monarch in the mountains. Though he never left his Grotto-Heaven, he was a True Monarch all the same!

Jia Zan gave a bitter smile.

"He said: 'Avoiding brings no disaster, not avoiding brings fortune.'"

Tao Jiexing said:

"He is asking you to decide for yourself."

Jia Zan shook his head and said seriously:

"That's not right. My Jia and Wei families, where can we possibly avoid it? Daoist friend, think about it. For anyone here in Luoxia, which of their ancestors wasn't distinguished? Either the successor of this Daoist tradition or the descendant of that great lord. Although that distinction is gone now, and we can't compare to Gu Prefecture... we still have a bit of face left."

"And once you have that face, things get complicated!"

His expression was a half-smile, making it unclear whether he was being sarcastic or genuinely amused. He continued:

"Take my Jia family, for example. If something were to happen, if some divine ability were lost, and people heard about it, they would sigh and say that our calamity has arrived. But if you were to retreat without a fight, abandon your noble status, and go hide somewhere, that would be a disaster! If the disciple-brothers and disciple-sisters of my ancestors were to hear of it, wouldn't they lose face?"

He smiled.

"That kind of thing just can't be done."

Evidently, these scions of esteemed families, having been left to fend for themselves in Luoxia for so many years, harbored some resentment. Jia Zan's words sounded reasonable, but they were laced with sarcasm. Tao Jiexing simply said:

"Then there's only one thing to do: sit and wait for death."

Jia Zan had tested him several times, and now he had his answer. He was secretly alarmed.

‘After a trip to Profound Governance, this kid is clearly resentful. Who could he be resentful toward? It must be an injustice for that Wei Xuanyin, which shows that the mountain does not support him...’

‘Then the Tao family has no backer to speak of either!’

He was, after all, a century older and already had a good grasp of the situation in his heart. But before he could say more, both Daoist Masters raised their heads in unison, looking toward the south as if they had sensed something.

The sky was low and oppressive. Through the hazy white qi, they could faintly make out a rolling blood-desert and a murderous intent that soared to the heavens.

This scene was like a great stone thrown into a lake, shattering the peace of mind of both men simultaneously. Tao Jiexing was simply stunned, but Jia Zan had already leaped from his seat, exclaiming in horror,

"Crimson Severing Arrowhead?"

"The King of Wei?! His injuries have healed?!"

Luoxia was not large, far smaller than Jianghuai. A battle had just started in the south, yet the divine ability was so world-shaking that they could see the spectacle in the sky even from within their sect's gates!

He turned his head dazedly and met the eyes of the youth beside him, crying out in shock,

"Great Song is attacking!"

Jia Zan had never thought this day would come so quickly. He felt as if the sky was falling, wailing in his heart:

‘That's right, the Tao clan can't even protect itself, how could they possibly give me any warning!’

As if to confirm their thoughts, streaks of flying swords crossed the sky. The sound of jade talismans shattering in their sleeves rang out one after another. The urgent toll of a bell suddenly rang out over Yinling, echoing through the sky.

"Dong, dong, dong..."

Jia Zan hastily took half a step forward, then spun around like lightning and grabbed Tao Jiexing's hand.

"Xuanwei! Senior Xuanwei!"

Tao Jiexing immediately understood his meaning.

Against Li Zhouwei, the two of them alone wouldn't even have the right to stand their ground, and it was impossible that Li Zhouwei had come alone!

At that moment, the face that appeared in his mind was Wei Xuanyin's. The youth's gaze shifted slightly as he said in a low voice,

"My elder has not yet emerged from seclusion. I will go into the pavilion to call him now. I must ask Senior to go on ahead!"

Without Xuanwei, how would Jia Zan dare to stand against Great Song? Hearing this chilled him to the bone, but he couldn't just sit there idly. He immediately became restless and could only say,

"I will go and observe the situation first!"

He stepped into the Great Void and disappeared. Only then did Tao Jiexing stand up. He paced anxiously beneath the pavilion for a few steps before he could no longer contain himself. He hurried upstairs and gently pushed open the door.

"Creeak..."

To his surprise, a middle-aged man was already seated inside the pavilion. He had a scholarly and refined appearance, though his expression was quite stern. He was holding a cup of hot tea and sipping it slowly.

"Martial Uncle..."

The middle-aged man glanced at him and said faintly:

"The armies of Great Song have arrived."

Tao Jiexing lowered his eyes.

"Yes..."

Xuanwei rose, his expression complicated.

"Fast... too fast... The north is still endlessly debating who can replace Qi Lanyan, who dares replace Qi Lanyan, and he has already... trampled upon Luoxia!"

The middle-aged man said melancholically:

"He is the White Qilin, after all."

Tao Jiexing didn't know how to answer him and could only wait silently by his side. The middle-aged man walked step by step to the windowsill, pushed open the white jade carved casement, and let his gaze drift lightly into the distance, falling upon the blood-desert that pierced the sky.

‘Crimson Severing Arrowhead.’

Daoist Master Xuanwei's eyes gradually darkened with a complex mix of emotions and disappointment. This was the first time he had seen this divine ability of the Bright Yang lineage, yet it was already so familiar.

His disciple-brother, the former Daoist Master Xuan Chan, had visited this place time and again, explaining this divine ability to him with hope or disappointment, his eyes blazing with a golden yearning.

This disciple-brother had been a guest in the Tao family, his ancestors for several generations having been unremarkable mortals, to the point that his generational standing was even far lower than his own... but in his early years, he had been extraordinarily determined, studying diligently and earning Xuanwei's deep admiration. More than once, Xuanwei had studied painstakingly just to offer his disciple-brother a sentence or two of inspiration. Seeing him studying the Way of Bright Yang so much, Li Jieyi was deeply moved and declared:

"Crimson Severing Arrowhead surges through yin to ferry across karma, its aura is heaven-shaking! I swear I will let my disciple-brother see it!"

Until their master fell, his disciple-brother came to Yinling one last time. He seemed to have just met some people from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. His composure was lost, and his voice choked as he said:

‘Master warned me many times before his death, fearing I would be harmed by Crimson Severing Arrowhead. It seems now that there is an obstacle with Bright Yang; this threshold I shall not cross! I will join the Buddhists, I will... join the Buddhists!’

Xuanwei had been obstinate by nature even in his youth. He flew into a rage on the spot, feeling utterly ashamed. He cut ties with him, saying hatefully:

"I would rather believe my disciple-brother died while comprehending the Purple Mystery! That is why you cannot let me see the light of surging yin that ferries across karma!"

After speaking, he held a funeral for his disciple-brother on his own, making it known to all cultivators. Li Jieyi lost all face. He dared not see him again and left with his face covered. From then on, there was one less Daoist Master Xuan Chan, and one more Maha Vast Cicada.

Xuanwei never saw him again, right up until his death. But now, for some reason, Xuanwei just stood there blankly by the window, staring fixedly at the light in the sky.

‘Crimson Severing Arrowhead... Disciple-brother has seen it. Its aura is indeed magnificent, world-shaking…’

‘Disciple-brother... Master was right. You... were ultimately killed by the Crimson Severing Arrowhead after all!’
