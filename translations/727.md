### Chapter 727: The Battle of the Golden Tang Gate

"The Golden Tang Gate."

The name alone was enough to make An Siwei’s expression change drastically. Li Mingguang hesitated for only a moment before taking out her jade pendant again and crushing it. She issued an order for all the Qi Refinement cultivators in the territory to retreat to the main peak of Funan.

"Withdraw everyone and hold the line with the formations," she commanded. "The harvest in Funan is already accounted for. Losing a few years of production is nothing. Situ Mo has powerful backers; he'll be smart enough not to touch the spirit veins."

Li Zhouwei had, in fact, already discussed the Golden Tang Gate with Li Mingguang and Li Chenghui, so this development was not a complete surprise.

Ever since the death of Situ Tang, the Golden Tang Gate had been on a steady decline from its peak as the number one sect in the State of Xu, boasting three Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. When the Li family had first risen to prominence, the reputation of the Golden Tang Gate’s young master still carried some weight. But even then, the sect was a hollow shell, its glory fading with each passing day.

After the Lixia Prefecture disaster and the death of Chi Wei, the sect’s sole remaining Purple Mansion cultivator, Situ Huo, had managed to provoke Xiao Chuting, a master of the Life Divine Ability. Terrified, he hadn’t dared to return to the lands of Jiangnan or Jiangbei. The Golden Tang Gate became a mere stage for the political games of the Azure Pond Sect and the Golden Feather Sect. The subsequent conflict between the north and south had hit them hard. To put it bluntly, the current Golden Tang Gate was weaker than even the Profound Peak Gate.

Their handful of guest elders were no threat, and they only had two newly advanced Foundation Establishment disciples. Their two most presentable cultivators were Situ Ku and Situ Biao, and Li Zhouwei had already captured Situ Ku. The sect could barely fill the seats in its own main hall.

The only one worth any caution was the sect master, Situ Mo.

As Li Mingguang led the retreat, she spoke in a low voice. "Situ Mo is from the same generation as my great-aunt. He is an incredibly suspicious and treacherous man. Years ago, my ancestor went to their Golden Pocket Island with his bow and killed a beast called the E'wu. The display of power frightened him so badly that he didn't dare leave the island for over twenty years. Only after he was certain my ancestor had left the Eastern Sea did he scurry back to the Golden Tang Gate."

"He never took a single step out of his sect until he heard the news of my ancestor's passing. It's only now that we’re hearing from him again... For him to cross the mountains now, he must have found some courage."

At the mention of the name, a nostalgic look appeared on the face of the nearby An Zheyan. He swallowed a medicinal pill and said, "This old man… I discussed him with Elder Xuanxuan once. His uncle is Ji Dengqi, who was quite a figure in his own right."

An Zheyan spoke with authority. As the former head of the An family, he had not only spoken with the old Ji family master but had also participated in the siege against Ji Dengqi. Li Mingguang, however, was unfamiliar with this history.

"Situ Mo was stuck at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm for decades," she said. "It's possible he cultivated some secret art. And the Golden Tang Gate's *Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra* is a renowned Geng Metal cultivation method. The few of us will have a hard time holding him off. I've already sent a message requesting aid."

Just as her words fell, a brilliant, dark-red illusory light flashed from the main mountain of Funan. A tall man flew into the formation. His heroic eyebrows arched upwards as he cupped his hands and announced in a deep voice, "Weizeng pays his respects to you, my lady!"

"You're just in time!" Li Mingguang’s face lit up with joy.

But as she beckoned him over, a golden aura was already speeding toward them from the horizon. An Siwei frowned. "They're here already."

Ding Weizeng glanced over and, to everyone's surprise, recognized the newcomers. He pulled a bright red staff from his storage pouch and planted it on the ground. A layer of fine, intricate runes spread out from beneath his crimson armor, crawling up his arms to his palms. The runes in his pupils grew denser.

"It's the Situ family!" he declared.

It wasn't strange that Ding Weizeng recognized Situ Mo. His Ding family had once been a powerful clan in the Funan territory, and Fu Dou had frequent dealings with the Golden Tang Gate. As a capable general, Ding Weizeng had even been acquainted with Situ Ku.

He raised his staff. In the sky, a middle-aged man appeared, a golden ring in his hand. He had a longish face and thin eyebrows, and his feather-adorned robes were embroidered with rhombus patterns and hung with glittering golden hooks and rings. He stood before their formation with his hands behind his back.

This was undoubtedly Situ Mo. Behind him stood his Foundation Establishment guest elders, and beside him was the elderly Situ Biao, who bore a slight resemblance to the Situ Ku held in their dungeon. Without a single word of prelude, Situ Mo gave a simple command.

"Attack!"

In an instant, a torrent of spiritual light rained down, hammering against the grand formation with a deafening clang. The faces of the Qi Refinement cultivators on the formation platform turned pale. An Siwei, holding the formation disc, staggered back a step, his own expression grim.

The formation on Funan's main mountain was top-tier for Qi Refinement cultivators, but it could never withstand an assault from multiple Foundation Establishment masters. If not for the fact that nearly every Qi Refinement cultivator in the Funan territory was present to share the burden, the formation would have shattered from that first blow.

But numbers alone were not enough to guarantee a defense—otherwise, there would be no need for Foundation Establishment-level formations. Even with ample spiritual qi, the array would break after two more hits. Ding Weizeng hurriedly flew out on the wind to buy time.

"Sect Master Situ," he called out, "why do you attack our Funan territory?"

Situ Mo raised an eyebrow and looked at him, drawing a golden blade from his waist. A sharp, golden aura immediately erupted, swirling around him like a white wave. "So, it's Weizeng," Situ Mo said in a placid tone. "You are also a cultivator of Funan. We are here to conquer this land. Why don't you surrender to my Golden Tang Gate? I can recommend you to the White Ye for further cultivation. Your contributions will be noted, and you'll have nothing to worry about. There is no need to die here."

Of course, the Golden Tang Gate wouldn't dare to recruit Ding Weizeng on its own; he had to use the name of the White Ye Immortal Sect. But Ding Weizeng knew where his loyalties lay—not only were his family members still on the lake, but he also remembered the immense kindness Li Ximing had shown him by seeking out four Daoist Masters just to heal a single injury. He refused, but as he did, he noticed Situ Mo's hands.

Situ Mo rested one hand on his blade while the other formed a complex seal within his robes. His ring finger crossed behind his middle finger to hook his index finger, while the others pressed together. A smile touched his lips as he whispered, "Go!"

A blade of golden light, sharp as a dagger, shot out from his sleeve. A piercing shriek filled the air as the golden aura descended. Ding Weizeng's reaction was swift. Gritting his teeth, he let out a great shout.

"Hah!"

The shout transformed mid-air into a tiger's roar that shook the forest, momentarily halting the golden blade. Ding Weizeng stared straight at Situ Mo. The sect master found his gaze locked, unable to look away. A powerful force slammed into him, making him stumble back a step, his vision filled with stars.

His retreat caused the golden blade in the air to slow for a fraction of a second, just enough for Ding Weizeng to dodge. But behind Situ Mo, the elderly Situ Biao, who knew his master's temperament well, was already attacking, swinging a golden hammer straight at him.

Instantly, all the golden aura in the sky converged on Ding Weizeng. Fortunately, a sheet of True Fire surged up from below. Li Mingguang's Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier had arrived. Countless red and white plumes of Pure Feather Li-Fire erupted with the flames, soaring into the sky to shield him.

"The Golden Tang Gate attacks our territory without provocation!" Li Mingguang shouted. "Do you wish to challenge the might of a Purple Mansion cultivator?"

Situ Mo and the Li family were long-standing enemies. He knew that the Li Clan would never let him off, regardless of whether he attacked or not. He was secretly hoping for a war to break out between the Li and the White Ye Immortal Sect so he could find a secure backer. Though inwardly delighted, his words were cautious. "You young woman! My Golden Tang Gate is acting on the orders of a Daoist Master from the White Ye Immortal Sect to take control of the Funan territory! What do you mean, 'attack'?"

As they spoke, the True Fire and the golden aura had already collided.

True Fire, one of the Fire Virtues, was the ultimate refiner of all things metal—it was precisely why Li Zhouwei had assigned Li Mingguang to defend this location. Amplified by the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, the fire, though weaker in terms of raw spiritual qi than the golden aura, was able to whittle it down continuously. The remaining golden aura that struck Ding Weizeng only produced a series of metallic clinks against his protective spiritual arts.

Situ Mo had already recovered. Drawing his blade, he commanded coldly, "Capture him, quickly!"

Led by Situ Biao, the six Foundation Establishment cultivators immediately surrounded Ding Weizeng, with one peeling off to intercept An Siwei. Situ Biao even produced a golden token that shone down, trapping Ding Weizeng in its light.

Though a skilled warrior, Ding Weizeng was only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment. He was no match for six opponents, especially with Situ Biao being his equal in cultivation. He immediately fell into a disadvantage, gritting his teeth and blocking desperately.

With Ding Weizeng in peril, Li Mingguang was also having a hard time against Situ Mo. His blade techniques suppressed her, and the corrosive golden aura he emitted spread like a mist, chilling her to the bone.

How could Li Mingguang, who had only been a Foundation Establishment cultivator for a few years, be a match for a veteran like Situ Mo? Fortunately, her True Fire countered his metal element. Relying on the flames from her Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, she managed to dissolve the golden aura, but she was forced to block Situ Mo's blade qi with the artifact itself, which rang out with loud clangs under the assault.

'The Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier was a gift from the Golden Feather Sect… it’s sturdy enough… It shouldn’t break right away…'

Li Mingguang had no time to worry about damaging her artifact. The golden blade that had missed Ding Weizeng had already circled back and was stabbing toward her back.

Before the blade arrived, a cold dread prickled her skin. Li Mingguang spat a stream of fire from her lips, barely forcing back the blade in front of her, and spun her brazier around to block the incoming attack.

*Clang!*

A soft chime echoed as a shower of sparks exploded in mid-air. The golden light retreated at high speed. Li Mingguang let out a muffled grunt; a wound so deep it revealed bone had been carved into her arm.

The Golden Tang Gate might be lacking in talent, but their techniques were formidable. This Golden Radiance Blade technique was simply too fast. Even though she had turned her artifact to block, its edge had only barely caught the blade, deflecting it to slice her arm.

A cold, metallic poison immediately tried to invade her meridians, but Li Mingguang's True Fire foundation surged, easily dissolving it. She looked up to see Situ Mo forming another seal, a brilliant golden light gathering in his hands.

'He's no ordinary cultivator…'

She had been injured after just a few exchanges. If not for her True Fire's advantage over metal, her condition would be far worse. Realizing the gap between herself and these veterans, she quickly retreated, activating several protective talismans.

But in the space of a breath, Situ Mo's spell was complete. He made a throwing motion, and countless golden needles flew from his hand, so dense they hurt the eyes. They swarmed toward her like a flock of birds returning to the forest, aiming for every part of her body.

'I can't hold back anymore…'

Li Mingguang knew she was outmatched. Her cultivation and techniques were far inferior to these old masters. The incoming needles were lethal. She had no choice but to take an object from her sleeve and toss it into the air.

An eight-paneled folding screen materialized in the sky, each panel depicting a different scene. A cyan light flickered across its surface, and a dark, cyan radiance flowed out, falling like rain.

The Chongming Profound Insight Screen!

The screen was imbued with the heritage of the Green Pine Dao Lineage, making it highly effective against the sects of Jiangnan. Coincidentally, the White Ye Immortal Sect was not of that lineage, so Li Zhouwei had not taken it with him.

He had left it with Li Mingguang for one specific reason: the screen's 'Heavy Abyssal Gale' ability—the power of the Deep Abyss—was the perfect counter to the Golden Tang Gate!

The ancient artifact unleashed its might. As the dark cyan radiance washed down, the thousands of golden needles seemed to be caught by the throat, freezing motionless in mid-air.

The cyan light rippled outwards, and incredibly, it forced two more hidden, squirming golden blades out of thin air nearby. They struggled fiercely, but were held fast. Li Mingguang stared for a second, a cold sweat breaking out on her brow.

'There was another one! If I didn't have this artifact, the blades would have struck one after another. I would have been killed!'

She had only reached the Foundation Establishment Realm a few years ago and lacked combat experience; otherwise, she wouldn't have found herself in such a difficult position. Having saved her life with the artifact, she saw that Situ Mo’s expression had finally turned sour. He glanced at the screen.

"The Great Wind of Abyss? What a domineering artifact…"

While Situ Mo and Li Mingguang’s clash had paused, Ding Weizeng was having a much harder time. Dark red spiritual qi surged around him as his long staff parried two golden spears. His eyes had turned blood-red. The gaze of the Palace-Yang Tiger was a potent weapon; none of his opponents dared to meet his eyes, resorting to bombarding him with ranged attacks instead.

With just his spiritual body, he was holding back six people. Situ Biao had taken a blow from the staff earlier, and his face was still pale. Situ Mo narrowed his eyes.

"What a fine Palace-Yang Tiger."

Seeing Ding Weizeng’s desperate situation, Li Mingguang immediately activated the screen's 'Dao Metal' protective power. She broke free from the cloud of golden needles and rushed to his aid.

Li Mingguang and Ding Weizeng together, True Fire and the Hengzhu Rite, plus an ancient artifact that specifically countered the Golden Tang Gate—this was no laughing matter! Situ Mo was the first to react, drawing his blade to block her. "Don't let them join forces!" he shouted coldly.

His reaction was lightning fast, intercepting Li Mingguang just in time. At his shout, Ding Weizeng also began to move. The Golden Tang Gate's guest elders exchanged a look and shouted in unison.

"Bind him!"

Several streams of golden light erupted from their hands. Situ Biao once again used his golden token, releasing a restrictive light. In an instant, Ding Weizeng was assailed by restraining forces from above, below, and all sides.

"Hahahahaha!"

This only made Ding Weizeng laugh. His dark red eyes shifted. He held one hand out in front of him and chanted:

"The crimson tiger flees, the monarch leaves his court, fasting in repentance, and granting amnesty to all under heaven!"

His figure dissolved into a dark red gust of wind, howling out from the surrounding barriers as if they didn't exist. The wind circled once in the sky before landing beside Li Mingguang, reforming into Ding Weizeng.

For a moment, everyone from the Golden Tang Gate was stunned. It had happened too fast. Even Situ Mo was momentarily dazed. Then, he and Li Mingguang understood at the same time.

'The Palace-Yang Tiger excels at combat, escaping confinement, shattering cages, overcoming adversity, and striking foes with its gaze.'

The encirclement by Situ Biao and the others had created the very concept of a 'cage,' and their combined efforts to stop him formed a 'confinement.' For the Palace-Yang Tiger, which overcame adversity, this was the perfect catalyst for its immortal foundation's divine ability to activate.

The situation had reversed dramatically. Situ Biao's face turned white as a sheet. Ding Weizeng's laughter continued, but Li Mingguang's expression suddenly changed. She desperately recalled the Chongming Profound Insight Screen.

'Siwei!'

While the main battle had raged in the sky, An Siwei was still fighting alone against a single guest elder from the Golden Tang Gate!

She was a step too late. Situ Mo’s reactions were terrifyingly fast. He was already stepping on a current of golden qi, appearing beside An Siwei. Before the Chongming Profound Insight Screen could arrive, he struck An Siwei with his palm, sending him flying and spitting blood toward the Golden Tang Gate's group. With time to spare, Situ Mo even turned to block the incoming artifact, his eyes cold and defiant.

An Siwei's immortal foundation was ordinary, and his cultivation methods were average. He had been completely focused on his opponent. How could he have possibly reacted? In the blink of an eye, he was caught in the six-man encirclement, completely immobilized.
