# Chapter 741: A Cunning Defense

Although the Capital immortals Dao had retreated, their southern advance was a matter of when, not if. Li Ximing could not afford to ignore the threat.

Fortunately, the battle on the river had left its mark. While Guan Gongxiao, Guan Lingdie, and the other core disciples were relatively unharmed, figures like Gongsun Bofan had sustained serious injuries. The Capital immortals Dao’s techniques were not known for their healing properties. Bright Yang cultivators at least possessed some regenerative abilities, but Yehui’s path was likely even less suited for recovery, his only advantage lying in his formidable vital energy.

‘They won’t be making any major moves in the short term,’ Li Ximing mused. ‘Once Shanji Prefecture is dealt with... the conflict in the wilderness will become a prolonged war of attrition. As for what other schemes Yehui is plotting, I’ll have to investigate further.’

‘And then there’s the matter of Wenhu’s Dao lineage...’

Now that he knew the Secret Diffusion Temple had a hidden spiritual repository on Mount Xiaoshi, Li Ximing had no intention of letting the opportunity pass him by.

"Bring Wenhu to me," he commanded.

At his word, Li Chenghuai descended the mountain on a gust of wind and returned moments later, dragging a dishevelled man by the chains that bound him. The prisoner’s hair was a tangled mess, and the iron links clanked with every step, leaving a trail of blood on the ground.

Wenhu had not been subjected to excessive torture in the dungeons, but his cultivation had been sealed, preventing the wounds he sustained over a year ago from ever fully healing. Despite the Li family’s rudimentary medical treatment, the gashes would still weep blood from time to time.

The man was a master of calculation. He had intentionally allowed the Li family to take Hongfu Mountain, a decision that had directly contributed to their ability to defend the Funan territory with minimal casualties. In a stroke of genius, he had managed to avoid earning any deep-seated enmity from the Li clan, lowering his presence to a minimum and surviving comfortably until today. If not for the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion lineage he possessed, Li Ximing might have forgotten him entirely, letting him languish in the dungeons indefinitely.

Looking at him now, Li Ximing could only think that the man’s luck had finally run out. An idea flickered in his mind.

‘After I extract the Dao lineages from him, perhaps I could offer him to Yehui in exchange for An Siwei. Given that this involves Mount Xiaoshi, Yehui might actually agree. Hah…’

His gaze fell upon Wenhu, whose cultivation was sealed and whose lips were bound to prevent him from casting any incantations. Li Ximing illuminated him with the Profound Light from between his brows, then silently dismissed the thought.

‘This man is no fool. And with his connection to the Secret Diffusion secrets of Mount Xiaoshi, handing him over to the White Ye Capital immortals Dao could create a significant threat down the line. Still... better to kill him.’

With a flick of his hand, Li Ximing released the seal on Wenhu's mouth. He remained seated in the position of authority, watching impassively as the man writhed on the floor before struggling to his feet.

"This sinner, Wenhu, pays his respects to the Daoist Master!" he rasped.

Wenhu’s supposed crime was merely "deceiving" a Purple Mansion cultivator—that is, for the absence of Daoist Chidu of the Capital immortals Dao. As the one who had made the promise, the blame had fallen squarely on him. Wenhu had never once proclaimed his innocence, accepting his fate in silence.

Li Ximing said nothing, his gaze fixed on the prisoner.

Deep down, he felt a flicker of appreciation for the man's talents. Wenhu was undeniably cunning and resourceful. But this was a conflict between Purple Mansion masters, a game far beyond what Wenhu could hope to influence.

To a Purple Mansion cultivator, most Foundation Establishment disciples were mere pawns. What truly mattered was face and reputation. Wenhu had been one of Yehui’s men; in Li Ximing’s hands, he was a bargaining chip, but he could never be a chess piece.

If Li Ximing were to brazenly take him in, it would create a true blood feud. Not only that, it would be a breach of unspoken rules. The moment Wenhu reappeared in public, Yehui would be justified in personally tearing through the Great Void to retrieve him.

But that single glance from Li Ximing was enough. Wenhu immediately understood his predicament. The executioner’s blade was already at his neck.

"This lowly one pays his respects to Daoist Master Zhaojing," he said, bowing his head. "The Secret Diffusion lineage never intended any disrespect. I was merely relaying a message under the guidance of a predecessor. I never imagined it would lead to this."

Even as he spoke the words, a bitter taste filled his mouth. He had clearly taken a stand for the White Ye Capital immortals Dao. No matter how he tried to excuse his actions by blaming his lineage or the Floating Cloud Cave, it would be nearly impossible to win Li Ximing’s trust.

As expected, when he shifted the blame to the Floating Cloud Cave, Li Ximing’s expression remained unchanged.

"Where is the lineage of the Dense Cloud Cave?" the Daoist Master asked flatly.

Wenhu’s heart pounded in his chest. He knew his end was near. Sweat beaded on his brow and streamed down his back. But what power did he have against a Purple Mansion master? His only chance, his only breath, came from the fact that this particular cultivator was conservative, perhaps hesitant to damage his own karma by immediately resorting to soul-searching.

But the specific mention of the *Dense Cloud* lineage sent a shiver of terror through him. A thousand thoughts raced through his mind.

"In reply to the Daoist Master," he stammered, "I can transcribe the Dense Cloud lineage for you this instant. And not just that lineage… Wenhu has also found traces of the other Secret Diffusion lineages of Mount Xiaoshi."

Li Ximing’s expression turned strange. He had an inkling of what Wenhu was about to say, but he frowned at the cultivator’s sharp-wittedness. Unseen, the killing intent in his heart grew heavier.

"Oh?" Li Ximing smiled faintly. "And which lineage might that be?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master," Wenhu answered with utmost respect, "while cultivating in the Southern Sea under Daoist Chidu’s orders, I was tasked with searching for traces of the Secret Diffusion lineages. I found something near Danrong Wuluo... but I concealed my discovery. No one knows of it."

Suspicion bloomed in Li Ximing’s heart. He could already see the outlines of Wenhu’s desperate ploy, but he played along. "And why did you not report this to Daoist Chidu?"

Wiping the sweat from his brow, Wenhu replied, "Daoist Master, having received a Secret Diffusion lineage myself, I am not entirely ignorant of the great masters’ schemes. Therefore, I communicated privately with my fellow disciples and was reluctant to report back to Daoist Chidu…"

"The Dense Cloud lineage," Li Ximing interrupted softly.

Li Chenghuai immediately produced a jade slip. Wenhu had no choice but to take it and begin engraving with frantic speed. A quarter of an hour later, a text titled *The Xiaoshi Manual of Guiding the Netherwind* was complete.

As Wenhu continued to carve into another slip, Li Ximing casually took the first one, his spiritual sense sweeping over its contents. The Profound Light between his brows pulsed faintly.

‘*The Xiaoshi Manual of Guiding the Netherwind*. It leads to the fourth-grade Foundation Establishment, Hurricane Ghost Yin.’

With his current level of spiritual attainment, Li Ximing could easily discern the authenticity of a cultivation manual. He waited as Wenhu finished a second text, this one titled *The Xiaoshi Art of Clearing the Heavens and Scattering Clouds*. This must have been the one Changyun said was obtained through murder.

‘*The Xiaoshi Art of Clearing the Heavens and Scattering Clouds*… Fourth-grade Foundation Establishment, Floating Cloud Body.’

Li Ximing asked pointedly, "Where did this one come from?"

Wenhu, still sweating, wore a mask of pure terror. "I obtained it from Fu Dou," he said respectfully. "I used certain methods to make him talk quickly…"

A faint smile touched Li Ximing’s lips. "I heard you took the mountain in less than a quarter of an hour. Your methods must be impressive indeed."

The man’s blood ran cold. He presented the jade slip and began to write again. After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, he presented another.

"*The Feathered Adept's Chant*."

This finally piqued Li Ximing’s interest. It was half of a secret art, and it appeared to be quite profound.

Wenhu prostrated himself, his words flowing with practiced ease. "This was passed down to me by my master just before he died. He said a predecessor obtained it from the body of a fallen direct disciple of the Wanling Upper Sect. It is meant to be a powerful defensive art that allows one to weave feathers into a protective robe…"

"As the Daoist Master can surely see, this is likely a Purple Mansion-level technique, somewhere between the fifth and sixth grades. This is only half of it. The rest…"

He looked up, a calculated gleam in his eyes. "Through my own secret investigations, I believe the other half is in the possession of that Secret Diffusion direct disciple in the Southern Sea!"

Li Ximing shot him a look, tucking the jade slip away. He watched Wenhu, who was now trembling in a full kowtow on the floor. His voice was light, almost conversational, but to Wenhu, it was a thunderclap that threatened to shatter his very soul.

"You dare to lie to me," Li Ximing said with an air of profound amusement.
