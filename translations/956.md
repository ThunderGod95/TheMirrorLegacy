# Chapter 956: Revealed

'You!'

'The Great Void is severed!' Xindu's heart filled with despair. He spun around. Someone was standing right behind him, an icy presence at his back. Yet when his spiritual sense swept the area, there was no one there!

'It's over!'

Xindu hailed from Mobei, originally a tribesman who had relied on a few strokes of luck to cultivate to this day. He had some skill, and truth be told, his relationship with the Zhao Court was rather close. The most formidable figure he had ever met was Maha.

It wasn't until he followed orders to head south, arrived in Luoxia, and met Wei Xuanyin that he finally laid eyes on an immortal cultivator at the level of a Great Daoist Master. Moreover, this person was from the Viewing Pavilion faction, which had shaken him to the core.

But now, the azure-robed man before him stood silently in the air, his blue-violet eyes icy. A terrifying divine ability flickered around him, registering in Xindu's spiritual sense and filling him with utter disbelief.

'Perfected all five divine abilities... How is that possible? Who in this world with a perfected divine ability doesn't have a famous name? If such a person could have acted, why would Murong Yan and Shilou Yingge have needed to risk their lives? Who is this?'

His body began to tremble, and he dared not move a muscle. The riverbank fell utterly silent.

"Boom!"

Dark light gathered in the sky. Ning Wan silently lowered her head. Chen Yin was stunned, completely at a loss. The man's eyes swept the surroundings, where the four Merciful Ones were still clutching their bellies, roaring with laughter.

They seemed completely unaware that anything was wrong. The four massive golden bodies lifted their legs and waved their arms, rocking back and forth in the air with comical laughter. Yet the entire sky was eerily silent. These Merciful Ones produced no sound at all, nor did they show any sign of stopping.

"We respectfully welcome Lord Suiguan..."

Ning Wan's pleasant voice echoed in the air, striking Xindu's ears like a clap of thunder.

Xindu certainly understood what this level of cultivation meant. In the current age, short of a True Monarch descending, a perfected divine ability was the absolute apex of power! But when the name 'Suiguan' emerged, it filled his heart with a bone-chilling, absolute despair.

'Suiguan... the one who descended from Pristine Speech Heaven, transformed from a divine ability... the inhuman Suiguan...'

Although the gap in strength was immense, they were all in the Purple Mansion Realm. A perfected divine ability and mastery of all five methods was terrifying, but as long as it wasn't an expert on the level of Mount Luoxia, Xindu had specifically borrowed a treasure. If he immediately shed his dharma body, he should have a chance to live. But it just had to be Suiguan!

Suiguan's pupils didn't even register Xindu's presence. He just quietly admired the surrounding scenery. It seemed like a long time, or perhaps only an instant, before he finally raised his hand.

Xindu felt hot blood rush to his head. He knew this Pristine Water Great Daoist Master with his perfected divine ability wasn't here to chat! He was here to take his life-mandate!

He finally retrieved the purple talisman that had hung in his sleeve for years, always ready. It leaped out, transforming into streams of brilliant, flashing light in front of him. Simultaneously, his hands formed a seal.

'Pureheart Light-Shift Art!'

All the divine ability and dharma power in his body surged into the spell arts as he executed the escape arts he had prided himself on for so many years, the very technique that had saved his life time and time again!

A blinding white light erupted from his body. It resonated with the divine ability he had cultivated, the Floating Cloud Body, and was about to transform him into a streak of white light to flee!

But the talisman's light had barely flared before it froze under Suiguan's mocking gaze. It fluttered lightly away from Xindu and drifted into Suiguan's hand.

He pinched the talisman between two fingers, glancing at it briefly. Xindu finally had his chance and shot into the air. But a dot of greenish-blue light suddenly appeared before him.

The light was no bigger than a thumb, but in his eyes, it transformed into a vast, azure barrier that sealed off heaven and earth. Xindu's pupils dilated. He didn't know whether to advance or retreat. Despair consumed him.

But an icy chill was already on the back of his neck.

In his endless despair, a single conviction remained. A speck of bronze light, the size of a thumb and shaped like a hexagon, flew from the robes at his chest.

As it unfurled slightly, it became recognizable as a tiny bronze sparrow, no bigger than a fingernail. Its form was fluid, dotted with pinpricks of silver light. It shot quickly into Xindu's mouth.

This item had an extraordinary origin. He had spent a fortune to borrow it from a Daoist Master in the Zhao Court, precisely as a life-saving measure for his trip south! Once activated, not even ghosts or gods could find him!

All his divine ability surged to the tip of his tongue, attempting to pour every last bit of his cultivation and power into this one gamble...

But the instant the thought formed, those blue-violet eyes flashed. He felt a heavy, stagnant sensation flood his mind, and the large hand was already clamped around his neck.

As the heavy glow of Pristine Water enveloped him, the divine abilities coalescing on his body were like lingering snow meeting a blazing sun. They all melted into the glow and vanished, leaving him captured, solid and helpless, in that grip.

This demonic cultivator from the north hadn't even lasted three moves before he was captured alive, limp as a dead dog.

The azure-robed man before him still hadn't spared him a single glance. He held him casually, his gaze fixed on the far distance, his face filled with a chilling smile.

No one spoke. Only Li Zhouwei silently composed his expression.

The Great Void was sealed, and none of the divine ability experts present could peer into it. But Li Zhouwei, using an Immortal Artifact, could see clearly. At this moment, more than one great divine ability wielder was already standing within the Great Void!

The Great Void was a chaotic mess. Myriad golden lights, patches of dissipating clouds, a manifested Buddhist Land flowing with radiance, a gloomy, ghastly cold, surging white light... Whether they had arrived earlier or just now, they all stood quietly, faintly surrounding Suiguan, watching him in silence.

Suiguan, however, just smiled and looked up.

At some unknown point, a dense fog had covered the entire riverbank. The demonic cultivators, rogue cultivators, Buddhist cultivators, and immortal cultivators fighting in the north were completely oblivious to the roiling mist around them, their battles within it only growing more intense...

The fog grew thicker and thicker, soon bringing with it billowing waves of black vapor. It swiftly crossed the northern side of the great river and rushed toward the Funan region, submerging the dark, oppressive mountain ranges, the newly built temples, and the countless villages.

"Drip. Drop."

The dark light in the sky intensified. A fine rain began to fall across the land. It was not a heavy rain, but it was piercingly cold. Just two or three drops made one's body feel sluggish and heavy.

Suiguan bathed in the rain, appearing relaxed and at ease. Xindu, however, began to tremble violently in his grasp.

Specks of blackness slid down his cheeks. His black hair was quickly washed away, revealing a sparse, pale skull beneath. His flesh rolled and dissolved into white vapor, streaming down his face. His hands remained locked on Suiguan's wrist, struggling weakly.

Even though his struggles were useless, his intense will to live made him keep the bronze sparrow clamped firmly in his mouth. He poured his divine ability into it ceaselessly, heedless of the cost, begging for a single chance at survival.

Countless silent and profound gazes watched from every direction. The dense, dark light completely obscured the sky, plunging the entire battlefield into darkness, black as night. The only things with any light were those four massive golden bodies, each standing in a different direction, merely laughing.

Everything was soon swallowed by a heavy darkness so thick one could not see their hand in front of their face.

'It must be the Heavy Murk!'

After an unknown amount of time, Ning Wan lowered her head slightly. There was no longer any movement from the mist at her feet. From the bank of the great river all the way to the expansive lands of Baijiang Creek, there was likewise no sound, as quiet as an uninhabited Wilderness.

The four enormous golden bodies began to waver. Their massive forms trembled in the black vapor, as if the majestic statues had been struck by heavy hammers. They emitted dull sounds of pain, followed by a violent shattering, like countless boulders tumbling down.

"Crash... Rattle..."

The hiss of sand and gravel mixed with the sound of shattering glass, becoming the only sound in the dark world. And in this pitch-black land, only one point of light remained: the bronze sparrow in Xindu's mouth.

Suiguan's expression was peculiar. He laughed out loud.

"To think he even prepared a Stargazing Bronze Sparrow for himself!"

Hearing this name, an incredulous light flashed in Ning Wan's eyes. She suddenly raised her head, staring blankly at the small bronze sparrow in the demonic cultivator's mouth.

Suiguan finally released his grip. Xindu's body, tattered like crumpled paper, collapsed. A dense white light gathered upon his remains, and finally, endless clouds and mist drifted up from his body, scattering toward the heavens.

The celestial phenomenon of his fall surged into the sky, causing waves of ripples. The billowing clouds drifted, appearing exceptionally dark and somber within the black aura of Pristine Water, devoid of any divine mystery.

"RUMBLE!"

A dull roar surged up from the earth veins. Clear spring water burst forth from beneath their feet. A fierce wind suddenly rose, and the mist that had covered the battlefield began to advance northward at incredible speed.

Suiguan stood silently amidst the roiling, northward-rushing mist, his eerie, blue-violet eyes narrowing with satisfaction.

Before him, the dark sea of mist receded like a tide, revealing inch by inch of bare earth, clear spring water, and endless white bones in countless different postures.

The vast lands north of the great river were now devoid of life.

Some of these skeletons still held dharma artifacts; others were kneeling on the ground, their bones gleaming with a gentle light. But even more numerous were the countless corpses still standing in the distant Baijiang Creek basin, their reflections captured in the fragmented pools of spring water.

In recent years, the Way of Great Desire had relocated millions of temple tenants from the north. Within dozens of breaths, they had all been silenced. White bones filled the fields, and spring water surged in waves.

The radiant light of the divine ability that constantly shrouded Suiguan finally dispersed. The familiar Great Void reappeared in everyone's vision.

The ten-thousand-zhang golden light, the layers of Buddhist Land—all had vanished. Every Purple Mansion Realm expert present was stunned, staring silently at the Great Void.

In the always dark and silent Great Void, a change had finally occurred. A sliver of bright light appeared.

This light was like a new moon, revealing a very shallow arc, blue on top and white on the bottom. It hung in the Great Void, sometimes blurring, sometimes sharpening, but it held everyone's gaze.

The arc of light seemed to be suppressed by something, flickering in and out of view. The remaining parts of it would occasionally emerge, only to be plunged back into darkness so quickly it was as if they had never appeared. But these were Purple Mansion Realm masters—how could they not see it clearly!

They could all see dense clusters of Daoist temples and palaces flickering within the light. The pavilions and towers were a stark, clear white and a deep, grayish-black. They could even faintly discern countless long feathers hanging beneath the eaves, dancing in the wind.

Suiguan's blue-violet pupils silently reflected the scene in the Great Void. A low chuckle escaped his lips.

"Its reputation is well-deserved... truly well-deserved. Worthy of the Wanling Upper Sect. How difficult... The light of Primordial Magnetism, the air of the Merging Owl, the aura of the Floating Cloud... still, it refuses to enter the world. But... as long as it has revealed its location... everything else becomes simple."

Li Zhouwei's grip on his halberd tightened. Understanding dawned in his heart.

'Wanling Heaven.'

His gaze fell on Suiguan's azure-robed back, and the words from that day echoed in his ears once more:

'Now, I want to cross the river to handle some business. And also to tidy up the scenery.'

'Suiguan's words weren't wrong... or rather, Pristine Water... how could he be the one to contend with Luoxia? Suiguan was just using the situation from start to finish. He might have even arranged this with the Viewing Pavilion faction long ago...'

'Ever since he arrived with the scroll and found Qi Lanyan and the others absent, Li Zhouwei had a premonition. After secretly observing the Great Void, he now understood. Suiguan's scheme... was merely to bring the final act of this grand play in Jiangbei to a close.'

'Those so-called "left on the north bank"... Xindu was a pre-arranged sacrifice. Murong Yan, Shilou Yingge, and the others... they were all targets to be eliminated or disciplined...'

'Why were there explicit prohibitions against destroying the earth veins and spiritual meridians during all those battles in Jiangbei, despite the fertile spiritual energy of the land? Everyone thought it was for Li Qianyuan's reincarnation, but the truth was the exact opposite... Even Li Qianyuan's presence in Jiangbei... was all for the sake of the Secret Diffusion.'

'Everything in the Tangdao Mountain Range was part of the plan long ago... True Monarch Taiyuan might have even been one of the great powers who facilitated this... He alone controls all the Reflecting Metal under heaven. If there was a hidden threat of Primordial Magnetism on his doorstep, how could he not eliminate it!'

Li Zhouwei looked down at the bones littering the field at his feet, his gaze lowering in silent contemplation.

'Kui Qi... Did Kui Qi understand? His final shout before death... had he already foreseen this day? His choice to die in the Tangdao Mountain Range... was it compromise, or helplessness...?'

The piercing light continued to drift through the Great Void, reflecting in Ning Wan's eyes. In that instant, her heart leaped into her throat. She finally understood.

'So that's how it is!'

A chill bored its way from her heart deep into her mind. The woman hesitated, her lips trembling as if she wanted to speak.

But Suiguan seemed not to notice. He just stood quietly, admiring the scene before him. Soon, he looked up, smiling as he observed the grotto-heaven in the Great Void.

The world remained dark and heavy. Ning Wan slowly closed her eyes. After a moment's hesitation, her voice trembling slightly, she spoke:

"My lord... since Baijiang Creek is settled... Senior Tinglan and Senior Houfu are fighting in the Profound Territory... I request you send aid..."

Her trembling, melodic voice scattered in the wind. Suiguan, however, continued to stare at the Great Void, offering no reply. After a long time, he finally turned back, smiling.

His face showed no sign of ruthlessness or malice. From beginning to end, there was only that faint smile and an eerie, Flood Dragon-like quality. He spoke:

"What does that have to do with me?"

"BOOM!"

Following a deafening crack of thunder, a torrential downpour descended. Lightning flashed through the clouds, illuminating Ning Wan's already pale face, turning it stark white.

In the gloom, the cultivators from the south, awed by the divine ability, had begun to tentatively cross the river. One or two of them stepped into the clear water and stood dumbfounded amidst the endless bones, utterly bewildered.
