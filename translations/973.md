# Chapter 973: I Command the Laws of Heaven

Billowing Li Fire surged, gushing from the eight apertures. A host of divine abilities converged with the descending white light, casting a murky haze. This descent, however, stirred the crimson sea below, causing five streaks of red light to leap out in response, as if answering a call.

The Daoist Master withdrew his spiritual sense from his sea of qi, his heart swelling with joy.

'Six of them. All gathered!'

Six motes of Great Parting's Red Radiance. He was only a short way from the full set of nine. Including the one he had already condensed using Talisman Qi, mastering this cultivation technique was finally within reach. Li Ximing, inwardly ecstatic, slowly opened his eyes.

The violet-gold light before him still flickered, but looking through the Great Void, he could see the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter below had been utterly transformed. Mounds of white bones now lay crushed beneath the ruined walls of immortal palaces. The dense, opulent ruins shimmered as intricate, profound patterns crisscrossed their surfaces, weaving a tapestry of breathtaking beauty. The thick, cloying aura of resentment was now completely concealed beneath this immortal sheen.

It was as if this place had never been the graveyard for millions of souls.

Remnant formations and restrictive seals twisted together in a chaotic dance of multicolored light, still struggling for stability. The moment one settled, a new minor Mystic Realm or spirit hall would come crashing down, rendering the entire Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter complex beyond description. Despite the chaos, countless beams of light—cultivators—darted through the ruins, risking life and limb. They scrambled to snatch treasures before the seals could stabilize, frequently breaking into vicious fights that showered the ground below with blood and gore.

Meanwhile, the glow within the Great Void pulsed as the violet-gold Mystic Realm slowly sealed itself. Li Ximing sighed to himself.

'That's the third one.'

Tianhuo's estimate had been correct. As Wanling Heaven drew ever closer to the mortal world, three major Mystic Realms had fallen in succession.

All three followed the same pattern. First, the Purple Mansion Realm experts allowed their core disciples inside to feast. Next, an entrance to the mortal world would appear, allowing countless clans and Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivators to flood in and fight over the scraps. Finally, what little remained of the realm—the dregs of the soup—would crash into the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter. This ignited a desperate free-for-all among the Qi Refining cultivators, even as the accompanying minor Mystic Realms rained down like meteors, a chaotic finishing touch.

These three Mystic Realms were the Southern Township Hall, the Capital-Return Tower, and the Gorge Mountain Palace. They fell in perfect sequence. They not only filled the former territory of the Three Secret Diffusion Caves near Baijiang Creek, but a large part of the Capital-Return Tower even spilled over onto Xiaoshi Mountain. If the Gorge Mountain Palace before him finished its descent, it would likely claim a significant portion of the Capital immortals Dao's territory. Calculating it carefully, the three realms now formed a ring around the entire Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.

Li Ximing watched these three acts conclude, an unnameable feeling stirring in his heart.

'How perfectly orderly.'

The Capital-Return Tower and Gorge Mountain Palace were both smaller than the Southern Township Hall, making the competition inside even more brutal. The Li family's harvest from the Capital-Return Tower had been substantial; their Foundation Establishment Realm experts had secured two spiritual pills and a spiritual resource. The Gorge Mountain Palace, however, was a different story. Valuable items were scarce to begin with, and Su Yan had nearly swept the entire place clean! The Li family only came away with a clutch of dharma artifacts and the single spiritual pill Li Ximing had located himself...

He couldn't blame the younger generation for this. The Gorge Mountain Palace was the only Mystic Realm in the north where they had truly failed to secure a major prize. Besides, the Li family contingent was exhausted and simply couldn't compete with the manpower of the other factions.

The three spiritual pills were the 'Hundred-Night Heart-Glimpsing Elixir,' which dispelled illusions; two 'Treasured Star Body-Spirit Pills' for healing injuries to one's dharma body; and a Blazing Fire spiritual resource called the 'Rising Warmth Stone,' which could likely be used in artifact refining. All in all, the haul was quite satisfactory.

Thanks to Spirit Probe, and factoring in their harvest from the Southern Township Hall, the Li family's total gains were still respectable. They had even managed to build Ding Weizeng's reputation as the Palace-Yang Tiger. Tianhuo had offered his congratulations several times, calling Ding Weizeng a 'lucky general.' But Li Ximing knew the truth. A significant gap remained between Ding Weizeng and the truly elite disciples. Against a powerful opponent, Ding Weizeng's strengths couldn't even match their shortcomings, while his own flaws were ruthlessly exploited. He had only survived by being adept at escaping during a chaotic melee.

'Lucky general? Hardly. If it weren't for his own solid cultivation and the Palace-Yang Tiger's uncanny ability to escape confinement, he never would have lasted. He would have lost his treasures and been forced out long ago.'

As the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators retreated, wondrous phenomena continued to fill the Great Void, yet no new Mystic Realm descended. The expressions of the assembled Purple Mansion Realm experts slowly turned grave. Li Ximing stroked the jade pendant at his waist, but refrained from crushing it, his gaze fixed intently on the Great Void.

_Om—!_

Time passed in a blink. After only a few months of quiet, a faint arc of light emerged from the Great Void. The surrounding spiritual energy erupted into a violent frenzy, and far below, the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter began to shake violently!

Water and fire wove through the sky, metal and earth transmuted, spontaneously creating new spiritual phenomena. Several streaks of light pierced the distance, hovering on the periphery. Li Ximing frowned as he scanned them; he recognized several 'acquaintances.' That fiend, Daoist Master Luo, even shot him a leering, conspiratorial grin.

'Even that fiend knows better than to approach...'

He was still processing this when a woman flew out from the Great Void. She wore a pale cyan Daoist robe and had a tall, slender figure. Her features were gentle—a soft, rounded nose and kind eyes that crinkled at the corners, which even her cold, formal expression couldn't fully conceal. She smiled warmly.

"Fellow Daoist Li!"

Li Ximing looked, and recognition dawned. He quickly returned the smile.

"So it is Fellow Daoist Kuang Yu!"

This was none other than Daoist Master Kuang Yu, the cultivator who had claimed the Xinyu Archipelago. Li Ximing had enjoyed their conversation back then and was surprised to meet her here. She smiled playfully.

"I came across a pool of Wall-Sinking Water the other day and just so happened to be bringing it to you."

She retrieved a small, sky-blue pot from her sleeve. It was only an ordinary dharma artifact, nothing particularly valuable. As she placed it in his hand, her gaze met Tianhuo's, who was standing nearby. The woman's smile instantly stiffened with awkwardness.

In the past, Hengzhu and Golden Feather had been rivals, and Kuang Yu had been a firm follower of Hengxing. Now, with Hengzhu in deep seclusion, she had just run into a representative of the monolithic Golden Feather sect. 'Awkward' didn't begin to cover it.

Li Ximing had a good impression of her, but sensing the palpable tension, he didn't dare speak. Suddenly, the heavens rained down illusory flowers as violet-gold light flooded the Great Void. A violent tremor, so powerful it seemed to pierce his very spiritual sense, rang in his ears.

_BOOM!_

The shock made his ears ring and his nose sting. He snapped his head up, his eyes widening. The world before him had exploded with light. The Purple Mansion Realm experts exchanged glances, and in an instant, several of them transformed into streaks of light, hurtling toward the violet-gold radiance. Li Ximing glanced to his side—Tianhuo was already gone!

'The Grotto-Heaven is opening?!'

But he held back, his gaze sweeping the area. He noted that many cultivators from the north remained stationary in the Great Void, their expressions grim. He heard Kuang Yu's low voice beside him.

"There's a window of about a quarter-hour before the Grotto-Heaven fully manifests. Those with special Great Void movement techniques or Spiritual Artifacts can slip in early... Those major powers have their methods, so they're naturally taking the lead."

"Oh? Doesn't that mean they'll get first pick?"

Li Ximing frowned.

"That's not a problem," Kuang Yu continued softly. "It's not that easy to force an entry. We probably have another fifteen minutes. It takes them a good while to find an opening and bypass the barriers. At absolute best, they get a seven- or eight-minute head start. Usually, it's even less."

'That's still a significant advantage...'

Li Ximing was still mulling this over when Kuang Yu, beside him, suddenly stiffened and choked, as if a red-hot blade had been thrust at her face. A wave of intense heat washed over them. She snapped her head up, her face ice-cold.

"Who!"

He saw an arching bridge of True Fire blaze across the Great Void. Flanking it, phalanxes of armored soldiers that writhed like dragons charged forward. His vision was filled with a sea of deep red. At its center, a middle-aged man trod the flames, sword in hand, its tip leveled directly at them. The golden-red patterns on his regal robes seemed to writhe, and his eyes were devoid of all warmth. He was charging them!

The man was silent, but the scorching intent from his blade felt like a physical spike stabbing into Li Ximing's eyes, sending a chill down his spine.

"Shilou Yingge?!"

This was none other than the Gao family's mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm True Fire expert from the north—Shilou Yingge!

'What is this madness?!'

In full view of everyone, while all the Purple Mansion Realm experts were waiting to enter the Grotto-Heaven, he had waited for Tianhuo to leave and then launched a vicious ambush. His blade, brimming with a ferocious True Fire divine ability, stabbed forward with undisguised, full-powered killing intent. Instantly, every expert present turned to watch, their eyes cold and detached.

Li Ximing was stunned. The Heavenly Light between his brows flared instinctively as Monarch's Balance materialized in the void. Its cyan-and-yellow patterns of mountains and rivers rippled outward. But the attacker's pupils swirled with golden light. The deep-red, fiery bridge had already torn a path through his defense, shattering the mountain patterns and allowing the sword to continue, unimpeded, straight for his chest!

_BOOM!_

A burst of Heavenly Light erupted in the Great Void. Audience with the Celestial Gate manifested, resisting the cascading torrent of True Fire. The clash instantly drew every eye. Shilou Yingge pressed his attack relentlessly. A golden-red True Fire treasure seal dropped from his sleeve, instantly swelling to the size of a mountain as it smashed down on Li Ximing's divine ability.

Shilou Yingge was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. The force of the blow made Li Ximing's chest tighten, and he was so furious he almost laughed. He glared coldly at the descending golden seal.

'Your divine ability is far stronger than mine, I'll grant you that. But you're Shilou Yingge, not Wei Xuanyin! You think you can shatter the Bright Yang Audience with the Celestial Gate in just a few moves? Do you really think I'm made of mud?!'

As the two powers clashed, Kuang Yu's expression changed. Shilou Yingge's mountain-sized golden seal had targeted her as well!

"What is the meaning of this!"

The woman clapped her hands before her chest and gave a gentle push. With that single motion, she broke the seal's lock on her and vanished. But that soft push carried deceptive power, causing the massive golden seal to visibly tremble.

In that brief moment of instability, Li Ximing felt as if the entire seal had been momentarily displaced from the Great Void. He seized the opening in a flash. His divine ability dissipated, the Heavenly Light flowing back into his body.

He took the opportunity to retreat a step, his face grim. Shilou Yingge's expression was utterly unchanged. Ignoring the vanished Daoist Master Kuang Yu, he raised his longsword, which now pulsed with the full, unadulterated power of his True Fire divine ability, glowing a pure, incandescent red. He pressed two fingers of his other hand to the sword's pommel.

"Strike!"

The True Fire divine ability flared, and the golden seal hovering in the Great Void shot forward. Li Ximing faced the Gao family's Daoist Master with a cold, fearless smile.

Light bloomed from the shadows. A beam of Heavenly Light pierced the void, taking the shape of an iridescent, crescent-moon blade that chimed musically. With a resounding _clang_, it struck the attacking sword, causing the True Fire to detonate prematurely, sending shockwaves in all directions.

_BOOM!_

A pair of impassive golden eyes reflected in Shilou Yingge's gaze. An even more intense aura of True Fire blazed to life behind the newcomer, framing him like a god of flame. He saw a long halberd flick, casually slinging aside a sheet of True Fire, its blade gleaming with its own inner light.

The golden-eyed youth advanced, treading on white light and purple flames, wreathed in resplendent Heavenly Light. His expression was severe, his grip firm on the halberd's shaft. Its tip, sharp as a pinpoint of pure radiance, was aimed directly at Shilou Yingge's throat.

"If the Shilou family is so eager to pledge its loyalty, you can prove it inside the Grotto-Heaven. There is no need to stand here and bark before the assembled powers."

Shilou Yingge's face contorted with rage, but his eyes remained dangerously cold. In that instant, every gaze was fixed on the confrontation—some observers smirking, others carefully assessing. Countless hushed messages passed through the void.

'It's the Bright Yang's qilin-son...'

...

Far from the confrontation, in the vastness of the Great Void, a colossal violet-gold arc was silently manifesting. Blue and white light intertwined within it, reflecting myriad scenes from the mortal world. The obfuscating colors, which moments ago had baffled divination arts and concealed divine abilities, were now fading. Layer upon layer of light was revealed, and piercing through them, one could glimpse rows of ancient palaces.

Long, carved feathers beneath the eaves swayed gently. The great halls were eerily empty. Compared to the imperial grandeur of Anhuai Heaven, these palaces were less imposing but far more exquisite, suffused with a transcendent, immortal air.

'This is a true immortal abode, after all!'

Furthermore, unlike the imperial, structured layout of Anhuai Heaven, this place was a landscape of towering peaks and sheer cliffs. The mountains were spaced far apart. At their summits sat immortal thrones, meditation cushions, jade tables, lotus platforms, or Daoist couches. The more distant peaks showed wildly different architectural styles, each unique.

Lu Jiangxian, veiled as a wisp of white light, had already been observing this place for some time. His Divine Sense was far more potent than ordinary Spiritual Sense, and his Immortal Mirror now possessed the ability to traverse the Great Void, allowing him to scrutinize Wanling Heaven in detail.

He drifted idly through the domain. Nearly every immortal peak was deserted, empty of life. All that remained were skeletons and the shed husks of immortals, most of whom had clearly died from grievous, untreated wounds or the simple exhaustion of their lifespans.

'Empty... just like the others.'

He moved, reappearing at the foot of the central, highest peak. This mountain was set apart; the nearest peak was over a hundred _li_ distant, leaving the mountain to stand alone in a vast, open plain. But as he passed through the remnants of a great formation, he saw the plain was nothing but ruins. The once-exquisite Daoist palaces and high platforms had been violently toppled, the wreckage crisscrossed with vicious sword scars. The entire plain was a field of rubble.

Lu Jiangxian stopped, his gaze complex as he stared at the scene.

It wasn't treasure that made him stop. It was the skeletons. The ruins were filled with a dense, countless mass of kneeling skeletons. They were entirely different from the scattered, misshapen, resentment-filled bones in the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter. These were packed body-to-body, pressed tightly together, yet every single one was frozen in the identical posture: kneeling, hands placed on their knees, torsos bowed in deep reverence. Their bones gleamed with a faint, crystalline light. But as his gaze traveled upward, past their ribs, he realized that every last skeleton was headless.

The plain held tens of millions of skeletons, arranged in concentric circles, all kneeling _toward_ the same direction—facing the central mountain peak as if in supplication.

The skeletons were clad in tattered armor or Daoist robes; some still clutched weapons. Lu Jiangxian passed through this dense sea of bone in silence.

The deeper he walked, the more he encountered the shed husks of cultivators in spiritual robes, some in magnificent vestments adorned with thirty-six spiritual feathers—clearly the remains of high-level disciples. Finally, at the very foot of the central mountain, he saw the only figure left standing.

This figure stood guard at the base of the path. It was clad in a deep-red, velvet-trimmed crane cloak embroidered with golden scriptures, the sleeves spreading wide like wings. A ritual sash draped down its back. The figure was tall, standing in silent vigil. But at its neck was a perfectly clean, horizontal cut. The head was gone.

On the ground nearby, a head lay rolled in the dust. It had a high-bridged nose and long brows, its features handsome and severe. But its eyes were closed tight, concealing whatever charisma it once possessed.

The headless corpse held a longsword, its tip angled toward the ground. Streaks of crimson blood had run down the blade, coagulating at its point, where they formed an intricate pattern that pulsed with a terrifying, condensed divine ability.

Yet another corpse.

He swept his gaze over it. The Spiritual Sword in its hand, though its light was dim, was of exceptionally high quality—likely a Spiritual Treasure. The various other Spiritual Artifacts on its person were, without exception, all first-class items.

'This was at least a late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator... possibly even at the peak.'

A wind rose, whistling as it brushed past the sword's edge, creating a sharp, humming keen. The robes on the thousands of surrounding corpses billowed and flapped limply in the breeze. A dense, heavy Sword Intent still permeated the air.

'This lingering Sword Intent... this person was a master. Stronger than Chi Buzi or Wei Xuanyin.'

Lu Jiangxian stepped past the headless guard and ascended the stairs. His divine sense had already surged over every corner, comparing the sword scars on the ruins with the wound on the guard. A grim understanding slowly formed in his mind.

'The same sword destroyed this place, slaughtered all these people, and killed this guard. And this cultivator... he likely killed himself.'

Lu Jiangxian had not seen a single other living soul. Piecing the clues together—the lingering Sword Intent, the nature of the wounds, the arrangement of the dead—he made a swift deduction.

'The Wanling Upper Sect was famously a loose coalition of minor temples. The time for Wanling Heaven to seal itself must have arrived. This cultivator... he must have been at the end of his life. He feared the Grotto-Heaven's many factions and worried that his descendants would rashly open the realm, compromising with the True Monarchs of the outside world... So, he used some divine ability to lure everyone here, slaughtered them all, and then took his own life.'

'How ruthless... to wipe them all out in a single stroke. No wonder there has been no word of the true Wanling Daoist tradition for all these years. Only a few of the Four Secret Dao Lineages managed to survive in the outside world.'

He continued up the mountain path. The summit was marked by four towering pagodas, one in each cardinal direction, each built in the image of the four divine abilities of the Capital Guard. The pagodas were filled with spiritual items and resources, but more importantly, each one was actively suppressing a Spiritual Treasure!

He scanned them with his divine sense. They were: Mansion Water, Merging Fire, Treasured Earth, and Gathering Wood.

'Truly, an extravagant display!'

This was a world apart from the sealed Anhuai Heaven of Ning State. The great families of Ning State had been scattered, and even the royal bloodline had reappeared in the outer world. Anhuai Heaven had been picked over by those families, its value greatly diminished. Only those three items of Metallic Essence had been precious enough to cause an indecent brawl. But Wanling Heaven had sealed itself abruptly, trapping sixty or seventy percent of its entire wealth within!

Furthermore, these four Spiritual Treasures were only honored with pagodas due to their ancient legacy. He could sense other Spiritual Artifacts scattered on the other peaks! Lu Jiangxian did a quick mental tally. There were nearly enough for every Purple Mansion Realm expert waiting outside to get one.

He gave the treasures a cursory glance, crossed a series of blue-and-white tiled platforms, and stopped before a massive, heavy gate of pure white jade. This was the true mountain gate of Wanling Heaven. Two columns of ancient script were carved into the frame.

The right: 【Alchemists Must Hearken to Me】
The left: 【The Two Poles Grant Me Mystery】

He looked up at the plaque above the gate, which bore four golden characters:

【I Command the Laws of Heaven】

The words radiated an inviolable, chilling majesty. Beneath the golden script, violet-white lightning flickered, a faint echo of the ancient Thunder Palace Emissaries who once decreed the laws, commanded the storms, and suppressed all under heaven.

"'I Command the Laws of Heaven...'"

His gaze was heavy. He took another step, passed through the gate, and entered the most sacred, secret heart of the Wanling Sect.

【The Lingyang Immutable Palace】

Behind the gate, colors swirled and silver light pulsed. His view was filled with a cascading, overlapping vision of gold and white. Ninety-nine white arches were layered, one within the other, interlocked and resonating in harmony with the palace itself. The entire palace... it was a single, unified Dharma Treasure!

But Lu Jiangxian did not spare the Dharma Treasure a single glance. His gaze was fixed, locked onto the silver radiance imprisoned within the ninety-nine arches. This silver light was like a web of silk, bursting from a single point in the void and fanning out in gossamer filaments. All the light pulsed from a single source, trembling eagerly as it radiated an intense, overwhelming pressure.

Around this silver light, illusory scenes fell like waterfalls: flashes of purple light dissipating as a Grotto-Heaven collapsed; water and fire merging; metal and earth transmuting; a surge of blood-red light as a divine ability was extinguished. It seemed to be broadcasting an endless stream of warnings.

But the Lingyang Immutable Palace was utterly empty.

That familiar, pulsing light... it radiated a profound mystery he knew well. His expression was complex. He recognized it at a glance.

"The Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination!"

This was the source of Liu Changdie's delusions of reincarnation, the very same Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination that had aided him countless times in his early cultivation! The object he had sought for so long was finally here. It truly was inside Wanling Heaven!

"'A Golden Core-level Talisman Qi!'"

It wasn't that Lu Jiangxian had never encountered a Golden Core-level clue before. During his previous journey to Eastern Yue, he had distantly sensed a Golden Core-level Talisman Qi. But by the time his Divine Sense had expanded and the Li family had taken control of Eastern Yue, that aura was long gone. Even from that fleeting glimpse, he had known it wasn't the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination.

But this, the true, tangible body of the Talisman Qi—the Yellow Register at its core—this was the first time Lu Jiangxian had ever truly seen it!

"'So it was suppressed and guarded by the Lingyang Immutable Palace all this time. No wonder my search throughout all of Jiangnan yielded nothing!'"

He stared for a long moment, careful not to alert the Dharma Treasure. He carefully sensed the changes within the Talisman Qi, and a strange suspicion began to grow in his heart.

'This Talisman Qi... it feels as if it has already formed its own body...'

The Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination before him felt fundamentally different from the unbestowed talismans he possessed. It didn't feel empty or untethered. It felt solid, rooted, like a stabilizing pillar set in the ocean. It felt... as if it already had a master.

His Dao-Profundity was worlds beyond what it had once been. Even without touching the Talisman Qi, he narrowed his eyes and focused his senses. Slowly, a series of anomalies became clear to him.

"'It's been tampered with. Extensively. Perhaps some True Monarch found this and studied it in secret, using countless methods, spiritual items, and even Metallic Essence to forcibly refine it into a Dharma Treasure! That would explain its stable, corporeal nature—why it's so solid it requires another Dharma Treasure just to suppress it!'"

He calculated silently, the truth becoming clearer. He could indeed sense the aura of Metallic Essence within it. Unlike other Dao Lineages he had encountered, this Metallic Essence originated from Ancient Merging and was exceptionally rare.

It was called... Heaven–Governing.

The Dao Lineage of the Mount Dali Fox Clan!

'All these methods, woven together around this Talisman Qi and this specific Metallic Essence... the sheer skill of the cultivator who did this is truly rare in this world!'
