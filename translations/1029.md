# Chapter 1029: Who is the Bright Yang?

The pavilion fell silent. Maha Minghui shot to his feet, not daring to remain seated. He stood aside, his mind already a torrent of curses.

‘What is that fiend Ping Yan thinking, causing all this trouble! Everyone knows this man is a close friend of the White Dragon Crown Prince... and there's no love lost between the various branches of the Dragon-kin... Is Ping Yan trying to get himself killed!’

Ping Yan didn't belong to any particular branch on Yinzhou Island, but even if this stunt managed to please the Black Dragon Guangfou, how could Dingjiao possibly let him off easy? It was utterly foolish!

Though a storm of curses raged in Maha Minghui's heart, and a thousand hesitations plagued him, he kept his mouth shut and stood silently.

It wasn't for lack of courage. High as Maha Minghui's status was, he too dared not offend the Dragon-kin, especially here on Yinzhou Island. If a Dragon-kin slapped him to death, Jinlian would have no recourse—would Mount Dayang stand up for him? Impossible! They'd be more likely to applaud his demise and punish Jinlian for the trouble.

The monk, thoroughly intimidated, simply stood with his head bowed. Yet his heart was restless, and he could only mutter to himself.

‘It’s not that I dare not help, but my position is unclear. I fear I might ruin the lord's important affairs!’

As these thoughts raced through his mind, Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes slowly brightened. He felt the thick killing intent rolling off the Dragon Demon and his gaze turned icy. He watched quietly as the Dragon Demon stepped into the pavilion garden, stopping nearby.

Master Ping Yan, that fiend who had been in the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm for years, pressed his forehead to the ground, not daring to look up.

Though the Dragon Demon Guangfou had taken human form, his body was immense. His massive shadow fell over the garden, making the entire pavilion feel cramped and oppressive. The roiling demonic energy from his breath condensed, flowing past him on both sides like a current of water.

"Li Zhouwei..."

His voice was somewhat hoarse, his tone flat.

"So you are the immortal cultivator who has been usurping the White Qilin's name. Where are the Pure Yang Bracelets?"

The moment he spoke, a chill shot through Maha Minghui's heart.

‘He's... refusing to acknowledge the reality of the Bright Yang.’

This was an extremely dangerous signal!

The Dragon-kin had deep ties to the Wei-Li, a relationship once so intimate that the Dragon-kin's eldest princess, the Zhaohe Dragon Princess, entered the Wei palace to cultivate. The Dragon King Beihai himself had followed Dongfang into the palace, addressing Emperor Gong of Wei as an uncle.

No matter how desperately the Dragon-kin wanted to prevent Luoxia from shaking the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment, they couldn't afford to lose face by acting against a descendant of the White Qilin unless absolutely necessary! Yet, they couldn't just sit by and watch Li Zhouwei grow stronger. The only crude and direct way to eliminate him was simple—just refuse to acknowledge him as the White Qilin!

If Li Zhouwei had no connection to him, Maha Minghui would have been thrilled to see the situation escalate. But his heart was already pounding with uncertainty. He maintained a false calm, but his decision was made in an instant.

‘I could intervene for him, even if it means destroying this manifested body... but I have no grounds to stand on!’

As a thousand hesitations warred in his mind, the golden-eyed youth above raised an eyebrow. Mysterious golden patterns surfaced on his neck as he spoke coolly, 

"I wonder, Dragon King, do you despise the Bright Yang of Wei-Li, or are you simply blind? Fate has decreed this. Can you not see what is so plainly manifest, that you must resort to such taunts?"

The youth had already risen from his seat. He met the chilling gaze in Guangfou’s cyan-black eyes as a golden light condensed in his hand, forming a bright white halberd section by section. A surge of multicolored light erupted from behind him.

The halberd was already braced before him. A torrent of demonic energy submerged the entire mountain range, and the Dragon Demon’s figure seemed to magnify infinitely within the black mist. Guangfou’s cold laughter spread with the darkness across the sky, plunging the mountains into pitch black. All that remained were a pair of luminous golden eyes shining in the dark and a single, icy statement.

"The Pure Yang Bracelets? I'll let the Dragon King have his fill."

Guangfou’s laughter rolled like thunder, cold and tinged with the Dragon Demon's strange hoarseness.

"Such audacity!"

A crescent-shaped halberd hung in the air. The black energy in the sky cascaded down like a waterfall, a massive, brilliant saber aura pressing down like a mountain upon the halberd, forcing it to slam into the ground and erupt in a dazzling flash of golden light.

This Dragon King had no regard for propriety; the saber and demonic energy at his waist had clearly been brewing for some time!

"BOOM!"

The brilliant golden light exploded, striking like a massive, heavy hammer. It pierced through the mountain, driving deep into the earth. At the same time, all the black energy lifted from the mountain, soaring into the sky and transforming into a colossal dragon of clouds coiling in the heavens. As Guangfou sheathed his saber, the cloud dragon let out an earth-shattering roar.

The surging demonic energy forced Maha Minghui back three steps, a chill filling his heart.

‘They're actually fighting! A Dragon King with two divine abilities...’

Dragons, masters of the Eastern Sea, descendants of Dao Embryos and Great Sages—an unblemished, direct bloodline. They were the noblest of Demon beasts in the current world!

Throughout history, there have only been a few Great Sages among the Demon beasts. The bloodline of the Yuwu bird was nearly extinct. Even the peacocks, not considered a pure lineage, earned the utmost respect of all cultivators by siding with the Buddhist path. And these were nothing compared to the Dragons!

And what kind of Demon beast was Guangfou? A noble Dragon Prince from the Black Dragon branch. Even with only two divine abilities, he was enough to leave Maha Minghui helpless. Forget his divine abilities... the Spiritual Treasures he carried were more than enough to ensure his utter demise here!

In the brief moment it took to think this, a brilliant gold light shot up from the ground, becoming a golden meteor that tore through the sky with a powerful shockwave.

"ROAR!"

But the black-robed Demon King in the sky merely opened his mouth. Vicious scales and long, sharp fangs appeared as he spat out a beam of pure black flame, as thick as a mountain peak!

"Huala..."

The golden radiance was instantly swallowed, but the roiling, multicolored clouds continued to gather in the sky. Guangfou’s dragon eyes grew brighter, and a hint of a smile crossed his savage face.

‘Sovereign's Perilous Tread...’

He suddenly raised his hand, blocking in front of him, and caught something with a fierce grasp. A crack of thunder sounded as he intercepted an incoming fist.

Li Zhouwei had emerged from the flames, his golden eyes blazing, now just inches away.

The radiant struggle of dharma power and divine ability flared between their palms. The flames from Guangfou’s mouth instantly ceased, his face returning to its majestic, domineering appearance. Behind him, the colossal dragon formed from his divine ability and dharma power raised its head high and once again spat fire!
Demonic flames, thick with demonic energy, poured down. The patterns on Li Zhouwei's face grew brighter. His Bright Yang dharma power and Illuminating Sun and Moon technique worked in unison, refining all the demonic energy before him. Yet the surging power of the divine ability still washed over his face, threatening to melt his manifested body.

"Despise the Bright Yang of Wei-Li?"

Guangfou stared at him with his cyan-black eyes and sneered, his voice hoarse. 

"When Emperor Gong was on the throne, my grandfather visited the palace three times. Li Guangheng was my father's sworn brother. The Pure Yang Bracelets were personally retrieved by my family. When the Wei-Li rose and fell, my father was the only one willing to stand up for them, and for it, his dragon tendons were ripped out and he perished. To this day, Dragon-Trapping Ridge in the lands of Long is a grotto-heaven of the Chen Kingdom... And you want to talk to me about the Wei-Li?"

"Who despises the Bright Yang of Wei-Li? Is it Dingjiao, or is it me? Li Zhouwei... you'd better think carefully."

The Dragon Demon's words were heavy with meaning. His black pupils gave Li Zhouwei a warning look before he cracked a smile, demonic energy snaking from his nostrils.

"Are you the Bright Yang of Wei-Li... or is the Wei Emperor the Bright Yang of Wei-Li?"

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes slightly, a smile also appearing on his face. The spot between his brows brightened rapidly as Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light poured out, neutralizing all the demonic flames. A low, roar-like laugh rumbled from the young man's throat.

"You talk of the Wei-Li? Today, the Heavenly Glow shepherds the Wei Emperor, and the rising sun's chains bind the Qilin. What is there to talk about! If you truly had a way to save the Wei Emperor, there would be no need for me to be here today!"

The radiance between his brows swiftly transformed into a bottomless darkness. A torrent of Emperor Qi's Light surged forth, and countless streams of gold and black light blotted out the sky, suppressing all the demonic energy. At the same time, the White Qilin's cold voice rang out:

"Who is the Bright Yang of Wei-Li? Hierarchy is Bright Yang, and for a son to slay his father is also Bright Yang. The Wei Emperor holds the seat of honor, but does he possess any honor today? The mandate of Bright Yang has descended upon me, to occupy the position of opposition, to slay the Monarch-Father, to seize authority. I stand at the Yang Cusp. If I am favored by the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment and defy the Emperor, then upon my ascension, I am the Bright Yang!"

He burst into laughter, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

"If I truly become this Bright Yang of Wei-Li, will you eliminate me, or will you aid me?!"

The demonic energy in Guangfou's eyes surged. He was momentarily speechless, the muscles on his face twitching. His skin tore open as black, horn-like ridges grew out, and two long, horned whiskers sprouted from the corners of his lips, unfurling in the demonic flames.

Li Zhouwei's words were not without reason. A son honoring his father is Bright Yang; a son slaying his father is also Bright Yang. Guangfou claimed to defend the Bright Yang of Wei-Li and wanted to kill him to help Li Qianyuan. But Li Qianyuan, though seated upon the Fruition Attainment, was an emperor without a empire. He could no longer be the Bright Yang Monarch-Father!

And though Li Zhouwei was below the Fruition Attainment, for a uniquely sovereign Fruition Attainment like Bright Yang to favor someone outside it could only mean one thing—it wanted him to slay his father.

If Li Zhouwei obeyed the will of the Fruition Attainment, he would perfectly embody the inverted, rebellious position of the Bright Yang—the Yang Cusp. He would be the one to represent the Bright Yang!

Black, mist-like energy churned in Guangfou's eyes. His body, which had already begun to transform during their exchange, continued to shift. His large hands became massive, savage demon claws, scattering demonic flames.

The clouds in the sky thickened, revealing glimpses of scales and claws, long horns, and sharp white fangs. Deep black dragon eyes, like pools of water in the mist, blotted out the sky.

A pitch-black fog enveloped everything. Guangfou's dragon head, savage and immense, slowly lowered toward the tiny speck of golden light. The Dragon King's voice held a mix of amusement and madness.

"Do you dare ascend the throne?!"

Li Zhouwei stood amidst the infinite darkness. He raised his halberd, aiming it directly at Guangfou's true form. Black flames surged from his body, the long blade gleaming with a blindingly cold light. He smiled calmly.

"I am capable of slaying a Monarch."

---

The black clouds in the sky dispersed like mist. Guangfou was gone. In his place stood a powerfully built, gray-haired man, his eyes glowing with a deep red light. Patches of grayish-white fur were visible in the gaps of his armor. He stood with his hands behind his back, as imposing as a mountain.

Behind this man stood another figure, clad in armor that shimmered with a faint blue light. His face was hidden beneath a helmet, his features obscured.

Li Zhouwei relaxed his grip, and the halberd vanished from his palm. He cupped his fist in greeting.

"Greetings, Dragon King Beihai."

Dongfang Lieyun's gaze was dark as he stared into the distance. "The White Qilin is too polite."

He looked directly into Li Zhouwei's eyes.

"I have not managed Yinzhou Island well and have made a fool of myself before the White Qilin. Fortunately, I was nearby in the sea. I heard the qilin's cry and the dragon's roar and rushed over from the Beihai Sea. I am not too late."

"More eyes are turning this way. Let us head into the mountains first."

Dongfang Lieyun's expression was ugly, as if he had lost a great deal of face. He simply led Li Zhouwei deeper into the island. Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal and descended on a beam of light, sneering inwardly.

‘Right on time.’

Master Ping Yan's spirit mountain had been flattened. The earth and rock had crumbled, pavilions had collapsed, revealing the stark white bones within the mountain's core. A sea of crimson blood gushed out, pooling on the ground. A swarm of Demon beasts had gathered like flies at the mountain's edge, greedily drinking the blood, refusing to leave even when driven away by Ping Yan's disciples.

Master Ping Yan was kneeling firmly amidst the ruins. Maha Minghui stood respectfully to one side, his head bowed, trying to shrink into a corner in the hope that the Dragon King wouldn't notice him. Dongfang Lieyun indeed didn't spare him a single glance. Instead, he stared coldly at Ping Yan.

"Useless."

The fiend didn't dare breathe, remaining prostrated on the ground. "Greetings, Beihai Dragon King! Greetings, Xu Water Demon King!"

Dongfang Lieyun didn't utter a word in reply. He strode past him, and the Xu Water Demon King behind him also remained silent. They led Li Zhouwei through a golden palace and a golden hall, deep into the island, until they reached a palace as massive as a mountain.

The Dragon-kin were just as they always were. The main seat in the hall was as large as a house. Dongfang Lieyun sat down, his expression cold, and said gravely,

"You've seen a joke."

Li Zhouwei shook his head, his tone flat.

"I learned a great deal from my exchange with the Dragon Prince."

His golden eyes were calm, showing no sign of anger or offense, but they held a cold glint. He showed no fear, even before this Dragon King, and instead asked,

"I wonder about the origin of these Pure Yang Bracelets. To think they would cause trouble for the Crown Prince!"

Dongfang Lieyun's strange, red-glowing eyes stared at him.

"Back then, the Wei Emperor bestowed three sets of bracelets. One was the Pure Yang Bracelets, which you now possess, given to his younger brother, Li Guangheng. The second was the Everlasting Peace, given to Touba Changming. The third was the Exalted Harmony, given to Shilou Chongyang of the Gao family."

"Bracelets were originally used during the Zhou dynasty to bind slaves, locked around the wrist. They are not a good omen. Bestowing them upon a subject was a way to ensure they would pacify a region without fleeing or betraying..."

"The Touba and Shilou families are major tribes on the border, leaders of the Sixteen Tribes of the Eastern Hu. Giving them these bracelets was naturally a way to ensure they would obediently guard Wei's borders and not entertain any other ideas, promising them great rewards in return."

Dongfang Lieyun smiled.

"Giving them to Li Guangheng... carried a similar meaning."

Li Zhouwei's expression tightened slightly. He remained silent.

‘So, it was a warning to me...’

If the Wei Emperor used them to warn his subjects and kin, what did it mean for the Dragon-kin to gift them to him now! The implication was all too clear.

Dongfang Lieyun, however, appeared perfectly calm as he watched him.

"Dingjiao has also achieved a divine ability now. Unfortunately, an old ancestor in the sea is celebrating a birthday, so he could not come to meet you, which is a great pity. He told me personally that your affairs were to be left for him to arrange."

"You can consider it a gesture of concern."

Dongfang Lieyun's expression was placid. Li Zhouwei cupped his fist in thanks and smiled casually.

"That's right. After all, the Crown Prince's subordinates are all in Zhulu. If I need to prepare for my own funeral, I will certainly need their help. It's just that with the great chaos just beginning, my family is short-handed, so it hasn't been put on the agenda."

The Dragon King's expression was unreadable. He leaned back in his great seat and said softly,

"That's no matter. You don't need to worry about Guangfou's faction. They can't change anything; they can only cause you some justifiable trouble here. There's no rush. At the very least, wait until you have three divine abilities before proceeding..."

He shook his head.

"Dingjiao's Life Divine Ability is not yet complete, making this matter very inconvenient. But he insists on handling it personally, so we will wait for him for a few years. It also gives you time to free up your hands!"

Li Zhouwei nodded. He took a box from his sleeve. Inside, shimmering with a myriad of enchanting colors, lay a piece of water-gold.

"This is Sinking Savage Aged Gold, a spiritual item from the Purple Mansion Realm of the Converging Water. It came from a grotto-heaven and is quite rare. Since the Crown Prince has achieved a divine ability, please accept this humble gift. The item may be small, but the sentiment is deep."

Dongfang Lieyun reached out, pinched the jade box between his nails, and tucked it into his robes.

"I thank the White Qilin on his behalf," he said casually.

The Dragon-kin would certainly look down on such a small item. To put it bluntly, it wasn't even enough to fill the gaps between their teeth. Li Zhouwei's gesture was purely one of sentiment. He turned his gaze to the general at the side.

"Are you the Xu Water Demon King?"

The general was startled for a moment, then bowed his head respectfully.

"Reporting to the great king, this subordinate is Lu Xu, humbly serving as king in Xu Water."

This general, a dignified mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast, could have swaggered through more than ninety percent of the lands as an overlord. Yet he stood so deferentially behind Dongfang Lieyun, and his attitude toward Li Zhouwei was as respectful as a minor demon's. A thought stirred in Li Zhouwei's mind.

‘Although Demon beasts are sometimes weaker than humans in combat, and occasionally even a notch below Buddhist cultivators, they have long lifespans, and those with good bloodlines break through with ease. With generations of accumulation, the power of the Dragon-kin beneath the Eastern Sea... is truly unfathomable.’

His expression remained calm as he smiled.

"Years ago, there was a White Brocade River King who saved one of my most capable generals. He has been wanting to repay the favor all these years but has had no news of him. I heard recently that he is now under the Demon King's command. If there is an opportunity, perhaps the two could meet."

The Xu Water Demon King lowered his head slightly.

"This humble demon understands."

Seeing that he understood immediately, Li Zhouwei rose and bowed.

"Since I have already fought on Yinzhou Island, I fear others may have noticed and will take the opportunity to invade my lake while it is undefended. I shall not impose any longer!"

Dongfang Lieyun nodded. Seated on his throne, he watched him depart, his dragon eyes filled with a cold light as if pondering something deeply.

‘Li Zhouwei... now that he has a divine ability, his bearing has changed. I fear he has ambition... I just hope he doesn't cause any trouble for me when the time comes!’

His gaze grew colder, and the atmosphere in the great hall became stagnant. After a long time, he finally spoke coldly,

"Xu Water!"

The general at his side bowed his head.

"Your subject is here."

"Make a trip to the Lie Sea."

---

Li Zhouwei left the palace and returned to Master Ping Yan's mountain gate. He found that the collapsed mountain had been piled back together, though the pavilions and buildings were still under construction. The fiend hurried to greet him on the mountainside, a fawning smile on his face.

"My deepest apologies for the offense. Please do not take it to heart..."

Li Zhouwei's mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, and he had no patience for him. With a flick of his sleeve, he asked,

"Where is Minghui?"

Ping Yan quickly replied,

"The battle between the two great kings scared the living daylights out of him. When he saw you being led away by the Dragon King, he fled outside at once. He said he would wait for you outside the island."

Seeing him point the way, Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. He rode the wind up from the demon's lair, finally leaving the gloomy, blood-soaked demon island.

As he flew outward, he soon spotted the monk waiting in the sky on an auspicious cloud. He had already reverted to his true form, surrounded by a pile of golden artifacts, eagerly looking out for him.

The moment Li Zhouwei appeared, he eagerly flew over on his cloud, bowed limply, and quickly smiled.

"Great King... Your prowess is truly divine! That was a noble Dragon Prince, yet you fought him to a standstill..."

The shock had been too great for him. Even with his eloquent tongue, he was at a loss for words. But Li Zhouwei knew the truth.

‘Neither of us used any Spiritual Artifacts or Spiritual Treasures. We didn't even use our divine abilities. It was just a brief exchange. If we had truly fought, given the immense size of his dragon body and the depth of his dharma power, he could have pulled out three to five Spiritual Treasures at once. How could I have fought that...’

This was a case of flattery falling flat. However, since their cultivation levels were similar, Li Zhouwei just saw it as mutual praise and couldn't be bothered to listen. He said:

"The items you promised my great-uncle back then, how much of it have you managed to retrieve today?"

The question made Maha Minghui smile nervously.

"I have it prepared... all prepared!"

He flipped his sleeve and took out a crystal-clear, glazed bead. Placing it in his palm, he smiled.

"Great King, take a look!"

Li Zhouwei frowned and looked at it for a moment. He felt rays of golden light piercing his eyes, all refracting into a glazed luminescence that could confuse the mind. He asked:

"What is this?"

Maha Minghui smiled.

"Following your request, fellow Daoist, I sought out many people. First, I needed to trade for a spirit fire, and second, for some Spiritual Artifacts... but I couldn't make a big fuss about it, so I asked around quietly, here and there, and managed to find something good."

"This is Blazing Fire. I've heard it can ward off cold and draw out baleful energy... It's sealed within this glazed bead and has been refined through various transformations. It can be considered an Enlightened Artifact. As for its name... I'm not entirely sure."

Just one look, and Li Zhouwei knew something was wrong. He frowned.

What had he given Maha Minghui? Some golden artifacts confiscated from the Merciful One. At most, the golden ring taken from Maha Taixi and the kasaya robe from earlier held some value... But what was this in Minghui's hand?

Buddhist cultivators were already poor in good items, let alone an Enlightened Artifact painstakingly forged from a Purple Mansion Realm spirit fire? This Enlightened Artifact would be extremely valuable in the north. If it had the status of a Spiritual Treasure, then the items he had given were at best a spirit embryo or a Spiritual Artifact...

‘Who trades like this! This is almost like my family trading away the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument for trinkets like the Reveal River, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, and the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman... Aren't you getting ripped off!’

Although the two couldn't be considered perfectly equal—this bead was far inferior to the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument—the analogy was very close. It made Li Zhouwei frown, and he immediately became wary.

"Maha is quite the businessman!" he said coldly.

The remark left Maha Minghui speechless. He looked at him with an awkward expression.

"Great King, please let me explain..."

He gave another awkward smile and continued,

"I received news from Mount Dayang. In a few days, they are sending me south to be stationed in Jiangbei..."

He stopped there, but Li Zhouwei's face showed understanding. Maha Minghui said ingratiatingly,

"As you know, fellow Daoist, my Lotus Temple has always been close to immortal cultivators and has never had any intention of heading south. Because of this, our relationship with the other paths has become increasingly tense in recent years. For Mount Dayang to send my disciple-brothers and me south this time, we will surely be the vanguard... They might even send us to the lake!"

The monk rubbed his bald head and smiled.

"I beg the Great King to show mercy..."

Li Zhouwei felt a bit troubled. He shook his head.

"In the heat of battle, divine abilities have no eyes. How can there be mercy? It's either you kill me, or I kill you. If I show you mercy, who will show my family mercy? What's more..."

His golden eyes narrowed as he stared at him intently.

"Anyone who dares to run rampant on my lake will certainly have to leave something behind. Either their manifested body and golden artifacts, or their life-mandate."

Minghui's heart pounded as he listened. He had made up the part about being sent to the lake, but on second thought, was it really something his fellow disciples wouldn't do? He said awkwardly,

"I understand! I understand!"

His eyes darted around, and he smiled.

"Since the great one has sold the golden artifacts to me, I will go back, melt them down, sell them, and then forge a new one. I will absolutely not let the great one break his rules. When the time comes, you can just take it! Bundle it together with the golden artifacts from those fellow disciples, ah, fellow practitioners, and then sell them back to me... Wouldn't that be the best of both worlds!"

Li Zhouwei's expression was strange as he heard this. He sized up the monk carefully and smiled.

"What if I want a life-mandate?"

"Eh!"

Minghui chuckled.

"What's so difficult about that? I certainly won't be the only one coming! Fellow Daoist, just focus on those... those from the Way of Great Desire, the Way of Compassion, and that... that what's-it-called Earth... the Great Adoration Dharma Realm! Just beat them up. You can take as many life-mandates as you want!"

"As for me... hehe, just let your elder fight with me. I guarantee I won't hurt him!"

Li Zhouwei's mouth twitched. He sized him up while pondering, his expression growing stranger. Finally, he said,

"I wouldn't be so sure. I don't think you can beat him."
