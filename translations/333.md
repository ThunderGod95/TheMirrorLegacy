# Chapter 391: The Rui Family

Li Xicheng wandered in the forest for a whole day. The clan soldiers complained endlessly, feigning illness and refusing to move. Li Xicheng continued on his own, with only about forty percent of the troops remaining, until they finally reached the hills bordering the Li Family's territory.

These hills contained a Qi Cultivation Realm spirit jade mine, jointly controlled by five Embryonic Breathing Realm families who mined for the Xiao Family, known as the Five Spirit Jade Families.

A few more li brought them into the territory of the Rui Family, which bordered the Li Family. There, they saw two small fields of Spirit Paddies. The remaining soldiers immediately scattered, jumping into the fields to pull up the paddies, leaving only a hundred or so following behind him.

"These are Spirit Paddies!" one of the soldiers shouted jubilantly.

The four previous groups of clan soldiers had passed by without touching the Spirit Paddies, but now it was being trampled on and destroyed in the blink of an eye. Li Xicheng reined in his horse and shouted a few reprimands.

Although Li Xicheng cherished the talented members of his clan and often provided them with money and food, he had no sympathy for these wastrels who tarnished the family's reputation. He continued riding along the narrow path, thinking to himself, The lazy and foolish ones already ran off on the way here. Now we have gotten rid of a batch of greedy and foolish ones, and what remains are...

As he was contemplating, a group of soldiers came forward, respectfully reporting, "Young Master, the formation has been broken. Please ascend the mountain."

Li Xicheng nodded and surveyed the terrain, then spurred his horse forward, wondering aloud, "With such a large spirit jade mine, why is the local earth vein and spiritual energy so impoverished?"

The spirit fields here were so poor that even the humblest Li Family member would not bother planting them. Yet, the Rui Family used them for growing Spirit Paddies. It was evident that the spiritual energy here was severely lacking. Li Xicheng thought to himself, This land probably takes seven or eight years to mature a single crop... No wonder the Five Spirit Jade Families haven't produced a single Qi Cultivator in all these years!

At Rui Family Peak.

The grand formation on Rui Family Peak had long since collapsed, not even broken by the Li Family. Chen Mufeng had symbolically attacked a few times, shouted out the Li Family's name, and the Rui Family had hastily opened their formation.

Li Xicheng, remembering his family's instructions, first went to check the spirit spring at the mountain's peak.

The spirit spring on Rui Family Peak was a pool of green jade. It was slightly chilly, and the spiritual energy content here was slightly lower than that of the Li Family's Mount Huaqian. He filled a small jade bottle with it to take back for examination.

After handling the most important matter, Li Xicheng finally crunched through the snow and entered the Rui Family's main hall.

Before him stood a young man clad in armor, holding a long halberd‚Äîit was Chen Mufeng. After breaking the mountain's defenses, he had been waiting here for Li Xicheng obediently, standing in the main hall with two rows of clan soldiers, their drawn swords glinting coldly.

Chen Mufeng was a junior relative of Chen Donghe and Li Qiuyang's son-in-law and disciple. Although the Chen Family did not have many descendants with spiritual orifices, those who did possessed outstanding talent. At twenty-seven, Chen Mufeng has already condensed the Jade Capital Chakra and reached the fifth stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm.

Though he had only recently broken through and his cultivation was not yet stable, he had a thirty percent chance of reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm in the future. The Li Family valued him highly, and he was considered a rising star within the clan.

As soon as Li Xicheng entered, the Rui Family members scrambled down hastily to kneel before him, some rolling and some crawling. An old man with white hair, holding a jade seal high, bowed his head and said, "The Rui Family respectfully welcomes the great family's commander! We humbly present the Azure Seal, willing to serve as your loyal dogs and horses, forever at your service..."

This old Rui Family Head appeared to be the strongest cultivator in his family, at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, even lower than Chen Mufeng. They dared not offend the Li Family, which had a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator and many Qi Cultivators, hence they surrendered the jade seal inscribed with Under the Governance of Azure Pond Sect.
ùêüùê´ùïñùó≤ùòÑùöéùóØùïüùê®ùïßùêûùöï.ùïîùï†ùê¶

Chen Mufeng, who had once served as a servant in the market and later led troops to slaughter the lords of Mount Yue, had become a general. With his rich experience, he watched the Rui Family Head's lip service with disdain, remarking, "Your words are pretty, but..."

Li Xicheng sighed but did not respond to him immediately. He looked around and saw two small piles of Spirit Paddies set aside, presumably as offerings. The amount was pitiful, even less than the Li Family's regular tributes. He glanced at it and moved on.

However, what caught his eye were dozens of small, white, fleshy objects arranged on jade plates, looking quite delicate and lovely, along with five or six jade bottles filled with blood qi.

Having spent a few years in the Eastern Mount Yue, Li Xicheng had learned about various spirit items but had little exposure to the clandestine transactions among cultivators. He asked with some confusion, "What are these?"

The old head of the Rui Family brought them over to him hurriedly. The pinkish, fleshy items looked cute and delicate. He respectfully said, "These are called rice meat, something the Yu Family demanded as tribute in the past."

Li Xicheng stared at them, feeling a vague sense of unease. He waved them away, and Chen Mufeng, who already knew what it was, whispered with a grim expression, "This so-called rice meat was made from those who were fed rice, likely mortals refined through a secret method... Blood slices are just a refined term for blood qi."

Li Xicheng's face turned pale though he maintained his composure. The old head of the Rui Family, seeing their expressions, realized his flattery had backfired. He quickly stammered, "I did not know that your esteemed clan disdains these items! I beg your pardon! My name is Rui Qiongcuo... My ancestors were enlightened by the Xiao Family."

Rui Qiongcuo was trying to align himself with the Xiao Family for protection. Chen Mufeng merely threw him a glance and ignored his existence.

The Rui Family and the other families around the spirit jade mine were early vassals of the Xiao Family, mining for them. Though called vassals, they were more like mining slaves. Hence, surrendering to the Li Family was nothing to be ashamed of.

Even though the Xiao Family had not issued any official certificates, the Li Family would not annex its own supporter's vassals. Chen Mufeng, seeing Li Xicheng remain silent, also stood still.

Rui Qiongcuo was getting nervous. He knew about the attack on the Xiao Family but did not know their current status. He thought to himself, The Li Family is also supported by the Xiao Family... so maybe there won't be any problems?

As he was thinking this, another person arrived outside the hall. Rui Qiongcuo, who had not developed his spiritual sense, heard Chen Mufeng respectfully address the newcomer as Master, indicating the person was likely a Qi Cultivator. He quickly bowed his head in silence.

The newcomer was Li Qiuyang. Since these small families only had Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, it was not necessary for a Qi Cultivator from the main family to come, so Li Qiuyang was sent instead.

Li Qiuyang adjusted his robe which was still covered with snow, and appeared deep in thought, holding a light green, diamond-shaped piece of ore. He said softly, "I was ordered by the clan to investigate the spirit jade mine shared by the five families."

"Thank you, Clan Elder," Li Xicheng replied, noting Li Qiuyang's hesitant expression.

Li Qiuyang put the ore away and said sternly, "Since the Rui Family has joined our Li Family, you should adhere to our rules. You must no longer use humans as spirit materials to make rice meat or blood slices. Our family places great importance on this matter, so do not test us."

This matter was not honorable to begin with, and now that Li Xicheng had bluntly pointed it out, Rui Qiongcuo felt deeply embarrassed. He nodded repeatedly, inwardly complaining, How domineering... The Yu Family demanded blood qi as tribute, and now the Li Family bans rice meat. Each clan has its quirks, huh? But this land is so barren; without using the old and infirm as medicine... What else can we do?

Although there was a valuable spirit jade mine in the area controlled by the five families, the spirit veins and spiritual energy seemed to have been concentrated around the mine, leaving the rest of the land barren and severely lacking in spiritual energy. This made it extremely difficult for the Rui Family to grow Spirit Paddies and other spirit crops, forcing them to resort to various means to barely survive.

Seeing Rui Qiongcuo's submissive demeanor, Li Xicheng organized his thoughts and continued, "Our family head understands your situation. We are not demanding tribute from you for nothing. We permit the Rui Family to send people to our Yuting Peak to cultivate paddies and study. Our family will only take a twenty percent tax."

The old man was stunned for a moment, his eyes no longer showing his usual cunning but rather a deep confusion. He looked at Li Xicheng, somewhat dazed, and murmured, "To Yuting Peak to grow paddies...?"

Rui Qiongcuo muttered these words twice, his eyes reddening, and he quickly asked, "What kind of tribute does your esteemed clan require?"

"We only ask for the water from your spirit spring and the twenty percent tax as your tribute!" Li Xicheng declared as he waved his hand dismissively. Rui Qiongcuo still could not believe these words and stared at him in a daze.

Rui Qiongcuo was well aware of how fertile the lands of clans were and how abundant their spiritual energy was. He had once harbored greedy thoughts, but during his tenure, the Ji Family was at its peak, especially Ji Dengqi, who was particularly domineering, leaving no room for Rui Qiongcuo's ambitions.

Later, when the Ji Family was replaced by the An Family and then the Li Family came, with their White Jade Fist and Celestial Moon Sword, they were even stronger, capable of obliterating the Rui Family with a mere breath.

As for secretly selling the ores, the Xiao Family had a profound technique for detecting veins. They knew exactly how much was missing from the mine and how much was delivered. If discovered, it would lead to the extermination of the entire Rui Family.

The Rui Family had thought about escaping from this impoverished place, but the Xiao Family sent people annually to collect the ores, making them too afraid to act. They could only struggle year after year.

Now that there was hope, decades of hardship welled up instantly, and tears streamed down the old man's face.

"Thank you, young master!" he exclaimed gratefully.

Seeing the old man prostrate himself on the ground in deep gratitude, Li Xicheng was somewhat surprised.

The order was given by Li Yuanping, and he had not thought much about it. The Li Family was short on manpower, and there were still large tracts of vacant spirit fields under Yuting Peak, so it was merely a matter of renting them out instead of leaving them idle.

"That is enough."

The old man had become a kowtowing worm. Li Xicheng ordered someone to help him up. The old man's face was covered in tears, and he seemed genuinely moved.

The Rui Family's gratitude did not mean much to the Li Family, but Li Xicheng had a kind disposition. Seeing the old man's emotional state, he felt rather warm and said some comforting words. Meanwhile, Tian Zhongqing also arrived with his men.

The Pu Family similarly expressed their profound gratitude and sent two Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators.

"Let us return home then."

After settling everything and repeatedly warning the Rui Family, Li Xicheng transcribed their techniques. As expected, they were common and already present in his family, so he led his men back to their clan.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

This expedition felt like a lot of noise for little action. In just one day, they subdued two families and returned triumphantly. The Li Family took the nearby Rui and Pu families as vassals, tying them together through land leases, which were far more binding than usual tributes.

Li Xicheng returned with over a hundred men. Over a thousand were executed by the Jade Court Guards due to disregarding military and family laws, while the rest were expelled to Mount Yue, thus purging the clan.

The charges were securely placed, so Li Yuanping did not have to argue with the clan elders and uncles. He even took the opportunity to rectify the family's moral conduct. Feeling a great burden now lifted from his shoulders, his steps were lightened.

"Though these elders and uncles are not fools, they have noticed my actions, and my reputation has undoubtedly suffered."

Although Li Yuanping had heard some insults about himself, he paid them no mind. He spent a few days appeasing the clan elders and uncles before putting the matter behind him.

Sitting at the wide desk, Li Yuanping picked up a small letter and frowned.

This letter was from An Zheyan, who was stationed at Mount Huaqian. The Rui Family's spring water had been sent over, filled into seven or eight bottles, but the old monkey had resolutely thrown each one out of the cave.

An Zheyan, chattering with the old monkey for half a day like a monkey himself, finally understood that the Rui Family's spring water was too cold and carried some metallic poison. If it were used to water the spirit root, it could potentially destroy it.

Li Yuanping was immediately covered in a cold sweat upon hearing this news, silently feeling grateful. If not for the old monkey's vigilance, they might have wasted this Foundation Establishment Realm money tree.

Mentally giving the old monkey credit, Li Yuanping pondered on whether to send someone to investigate the spring water while summoning Li Qiuyang, who claimed to have important matters to report.

Li Qiuyang, with a serious expression, took out a light green ore from his storage pouch and said in a low voice, "Reporting to the clan head, we examined the ore samples claimed to be spirit jade from the five families, and brought one back."

He handed over the ore. Li Yuanping examined it, noticing its light green hue with traces of gold. This ore was a Qi Cultivation Realm spirit item, potentially harmful to the body. Li Qiuyang, fearing it might harm Li Yuanping, had sealed it with a spell.

Unable to discern much, Li Yuanping heard Li Qiuyang say solemnly, "This is not spirit jade; it is Green Origin Copper Essence, a rare spirit item. I learned about it during a chat with a cultivator from the Xiao Family."

"Green Origin Copper Essence is a Qi Cultivation Realm spirit item that requires Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators to mine... Its cold and fierce nature harms the body. Without reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm, mining it impairs one's cultivation path and lifespan, making it increasingly difficult to break through," Li Qiuyang explained as he continued to report, "Year after year, the Five Spirit Jade Families mined it without realizing this. The copper essence also contaminated the spirit fields, damaging the spirit plants. This explains why the five families' Spirit Paddies and crops yield so poorly."

Li Yuanping felt a chill down his spine as realization dawned upon him. He set down the copper essence, nodding as he said, "No wonder the Five Spirit Jade Families have remained at the Embryonic Breathing Realm for so many years without producing many Qi Cultivators... No wonder the Xiao Family sought to enlighten other families! On one hand, the Azure Pond Sect strictly forbids cross-peak and inter-prefecture activities... This is done in order to avoid provoking the sect. On the other hand, the Xiao Family does not want to send their people to mine."

With a bit of thought, Li Yuanping's previous doubts were resolved, and he mumbled, "No wonder the spring water had metallic poison... it must have been contaminated by the Green Origin Copper Essence."

Feeling much relieved now, he asked, "Have the cultivators from the Rui and Pu families been settled?"

"They have been arranged at the Yuting Peak to cultivate Spirit Paddies," Li Qiuyang responded with a nod.

Li Yuanping then picked up a vermillion brush, wrote a few words on An Zheyan's letter, and handed it to Li Qiuyang.

"Please have this delivered to Wutu Peak, Clan Uncle."
