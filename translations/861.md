# Chapter 861: A United Front

## Lin'an Prefecture

The domain of the Great Xiukui Monastery was a secluded world of its own, a rugged landscape of hills nestled between mountain and sea. Temples and shrines dotted the entire region, each a self-governing entity within a Daoist tradition that clung to ancient customs. Though the cultivators here rarely ventured beyond the prefecture's borders, this adherence to the old ways had allowed a hundred flowers to bloom.

The night was pitch-black when a sliver of bright light streaked from the north, gliding toward the central mountain range. Below, a dense forest marked the entrance to the Great Xiukui Monastery. The light, appearing slow but moving with incredible speed, soon solidified before the mountain gate, revealing a man in a white-gold robe. He carried an air of serene confidence. Beside him, a scholarly man stood with quiet respect.

Li Ximing glanced around and saw a stone stele standing before the gate, upon which two large, black characters were carved with wild, aggressive strokes:

[Tiger's Frontier]

The calligraphy bore no signature and seemed dull and lifeless. A young man in a black robe waited at the foot of the stele. Seeing them, he bowed respectfully.

"You must be Daoist Master Zhaojing of Moongaze... my master ordered me to wait here and respectfully greet you upon your divine arrival."

Li Ximing gave a slight nod. Cui Jueyin stepped forward and smiled. "Please!"

The youth led them onward, and only then did they see the characters inscribed at the true center of the mountain gate:

[Supreme Works That Level the Seas]

The foundational pillars of a grand gate remained on either side, but the vertical plaques that should have hung from them were long gone. All that was left were two stone pedestals of extraordinary quality, from which hung a pair of lanterns that cast a dim, golden glow.

Li Ximing took this in, his mind already turning. He had been to the Nine Mounds, where the gate was inscribed with [The Nine Daos of the Supreme Mound]. Seeing these words now, [Supreme Works That Level the Seas], a realization dawned on him.

'Perhaps it's like the Daoist tradition of Comprehending Profoundity, where they love to begin everything with the character for 'profound.' The Supreme Yang and Supreme Yin are one family, so it’s perfectly reasonable for them to claim the character for 'supreme.' '

'But the Azure Pond Sect... I've never heard of them having such a gate... very strange.'

As for what had happened to the missing plaques, it would be an awkward question to ask. He feigned ignorance and followed the youth inward. The path was paved with ancient, unadorned stone bricks that exuded a timeless aura, and Daoist flags fluttered in the wind. Snow began to fall, growing thicker as they ascended. At the highest peak, he was surprised to see several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators chopping firewood, sweeping snow, and tending to fields.

The summit of a Daoist tradition of this caliber should be precious land, every inch coveted for disciples to use for secluded cultivation. Yet here, several tea trees had been planted—ordinary, mortal plants devoid of any spiritual energy.

Upon seeing Li Ximing, the group of cultivators paused their work to bow before immediately returning to their farm chores. A pile of firewood lay scattered on the ground, and two Foundation Establishment cultivators in servants' attire hurried over to gather it.

Cui Jueyin had followed with his head lowered the entire way. Seeing this, he quickly moved to clear the path. They arrived at a hall in just a few steps. There, a Daoist Master in a black robe was brewing tea amidst the falling snow.

"Zhaojing, your timing is perfect!" he said with a smile.

Li Ximing had always known that the Xiukui were proud, but he hadn't realized their pride ran this deep. Cui Jueyin brushed the snow off a seat for him. Li Ximing accepted the tea, sat down, and smiled. "You must be the esteemed Kui Qi. I have long heard of your great name. I hope to benefit from your guidance."

Kui Qi waved his hand dismissively. "Zhaojing, you have come to lend us your strength. It is the Xiukui who should be thanking you. There's no need to speak of guidance..."

Seeing Li Ximing nod, the Daoist Master finally brushed the snow from his own robes and said with a gentle smile, "Some years ago, when the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven fell, my monastery also had some gains. We acquired a treasured pill from within, a Bright Yang artifact. We do not follow that path, so in a few days, I will have it sent to you, Zhaojing, as a small token of our gratitude."

Self-interest has always been the greatest motivator. Kui Qi offered the pill right away, and Li Ximing saw no reason to refuse. "Thank you very much, senior!" he replied with a grin.

The mention of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven's fall was a dagger to Cui Jueyin's heart. His own ancestor's grotto-heaven had been carved up and divided, and the Cui Clan hadn't even been allowed to ask a single question. The bitterness he felt was palpable. He could only stand with his head bowed, silent.

Li Ximing noticed his distress and waved a hand, dismissing him.

"Yes, sir."

Kui Qi's expression turned serious. "That pill was once appraised by Daoist Master Yuandao himself. It is a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm spirit pill. A single one can nourish the dharma body and suppress curse-inflicted wounds. If used for cultivation, it could probably enhance one's divine abilities by a fair amount... It is quite extraordinary. Only a few ancient pills could surpass it."

Evidently, by offering such a pill, Kui Qi was implying that any injuries Li Ximing might sustain in the coming battle could be healed, ensuring his cultivation would not be hindered.

'A fair amount...'

Had Li Ximing heard this a few years ago, he would have been overjoyed. But he had grown accustomed to fine things overseas and had just consumed a pill to advance his cultivation; it wasn't wise to take another so soon. He felt a pang of disappointment.

'Still, it's not bad. The other two spirit pills I have aren't for raising cultivation level anyway. Using this as a substitute saves me from wasting them. As for healing... I have my own methods.'

He sighed internally. Though he smiled on the outside, his lack of genuine excitement did not go unnoticed. A thought flickered in Kui Qi's mind.

'It seems Li Ximing's knowledge of alchemy is quite profound... He's no ordinary, half-baked Purple Mansion cultivator. Spirit pills of this grade won't be enough to move him.'

But whether it moved Li Ximing was one thing; given the stature of the Great Xiukui Monastery, offering the pill was the absolute minimum courtesy when inviting someone to fight for them. He stroked his beard and said, "Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities are difficult to cultivate... Zhaojing... take a look at this."

He retrieved a golden box from his sleeve and casually opened it. Inside rested a disc-shaped treasure. It was a brilliant golden-yellow, engraved with runes in eight directions. The outer edge of its face was encircled by a ring of fine, pale-white sigils that pulsed with a soft, rhythmic light. Its center blazed with a dazzling golden radiance, as if a tiny sun had fallen into the box.

'A Bright Yang spiritual artifact!'

This was something Li Ximing could not remain indifferent to. His eyes burned with desire, and he cursed inwardly.

'What a ridiculously wealthy sect, this Great Xiukui Monastery! I couldn't find a single trace of a spiritual artifact like this, yet he keeps one tucked away in his sleeve like it's a common cabbage... The old, established powers... they truly are different.'

Desire was one thing, but a spiritual artifact was an object of immense value. This Daoist Master couldn't possibly be giving it to him for free. Though his eyes were glued to the treasure, Li Ximing managed to exclaim, "What a magnificent treasure!"

Kui Qi lifted his head slightly, a smile playing on his lips. "This is the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, a first-tier spiritual artifact and a registered treasure in the Xiukui archives. It is a superb instrument, equally adept at offense and defense. We are about to face the Buddhist cultivators in a great battle. Zhaojing, you shall take it with you."

Li Ximing could hardly tear his eyes away. He listened as Kui Qi explained, "You see the face? That is the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Chart. It can unleash a destructive Bright Yang light, led by the Upper Shining Star at its apex. When held upright, its power is limitless. If you spin it downward, with the Upper Shining Star at the bottom and the Yang Extremity Star at the top, holding it inverted will allow you to throw the stars into disarray, to escape peril and overcome danger."

He couldn't help but sigh with emotion. "The ones who forged this compass back then were Su Jun and Chen Xuanli, as a symbol of Ning State's fealty to the Wei court and its adoption of the Wei calendar. For a time, it was the heirloom of the Su family of Jiangbei. After the Su family was destroyed, it eventually found its way into the hands of my Great Xiukui Monastery."

Li Ximing nodded silently. Kui Qi smiled nonchalantly and hinted, "I've heard that this spiritual artifact was inspired by the Crimson Severing Arrowhead and the Sovereign's Perilous Tread. Not only are its abilities formidable, but its aid to one's cultivation is also immense. When the battle with the north begins, Zhaojing, you can experience it for yourself."

He added with a smile, "The Radiant Fire is a baleful convergence; it neither wanes nor waxes. One who holds the true position of fire makes neither pills nor artifacts. The Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven may have been powerful, but in the Dao of pills and artifacts, they were ultimately inferior to others. Dharma Treasures aside, the spiritual artifacts that fell from the grotto-heaven back then were, in truth, not as good as this one of ours."

Li Ximing simply lifted the spiritual artifact, holding the disc and admiring it fondly. He turned it over. The back was as smooth as a mirror, reflecting the heavy snow falling from the sky.

'If I could just study it for a bit...'

Li Ximing was still a long way from mastering Sovereign's Perilous Tread and Crimson Severing Arrowhead, so how could he not covet a Bright Yang spiritual artifact? But the man had said it was a registered item, making it a difficult topic to broach. He smiled and said, "It is truly powerful! A single word from Senior Kui Qi is more enlightening than ten years of studying Daoist scriptures."

This was no mere flattery. The man's description of the Radiant Fire revealed his profound understanding. Li Ximing infused the spiritual artifact with his divine ability and thought to himself:

'Once the fight starts, I'll see how magnificent this spiritual artifact is and then test his intentions. If the price is something I cannot afford, I can always try to ask for one of the spiritual artifacts from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. Having a spiritual artifact is better than having none at all.'

Just as he finished this thought, an old man in a gray robe approached through the snow. He had a sword on his back, a gentle expression, and an utterly unremarkable face. He landed on the platform and clasped his hands.

"Daoist friend Kui Qi!"

The man's demeanor was so unassuming that if not for the powerful aura of his cultivated divine abilities, one would never guess he was a person of significance. He first bowed to Kui Qi, then turned. "Daoist Master Zhaojing! It is a pleasure to finally meet you!"

This was none other than Chen Yin, Daoist Master Yushui of the Yuyang Chen Clan, one of the three great Immortal Clans of Yue State!

This Daoist Master was even older than Xiao Chuting and had mastered two divine abilities. His swordsmanship was renowned. Li Ximing quickly rose and offered a respectful salute. "Greetings, senior!"

When Chen Yin had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the Li family were likely little more than minor landlords. The title of "senior" was well-deserved. Chen Yin sidestepped slightly and said with a meaningful smile, "We should have met long ago!"

Li Ximing felt a sense of shared history and nodded. "Indeed... Back when I was breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Chen Xuanyu of your esteemed clan also lent his aid. I have not forgotten this. Our two families have always been on the same path..."

Li Ximing had obtained his Radiant Sky Stone from Wang Fu, and Chen Yin had dispatched Chen Xuanyu to assist at that time. Though it was a matter of competing interests and not necessarily born from goodwill toward the Li family, the Chen Clan was now at odds with the Changxiao Gate, making them a natural potential ally for the Li family.

Hearing this, Chen Yin sighed. "Xuanyu is a rare talent in our clan. He is currently in seclusion and has yet to emerge. Who knows how many years it will be!"

Kui Qi smiled and waited for the two to finish their reminiscences before speaking. Chen Yin's voice grew somber. "I have already inquired. Daoist Master Zhusheng of the Southern Borderlands is not in his estate, but Daoist friend Luo was very enthusiastic and has already gone to Jiangbei."

Kui Qi looked slightly surprised. "It is indeed inconvenient for Daoist Master Zhusheng, likely because of that family on North Dan Island. But this Luo fellow actually dares to come? Fine, fine. It is good that he has the courage. These demonic cultivators are just opportunists, they won't be of any real use."

The way he spoke of him made it clear that this person did not walk a righteous path. In his mind, he was in the same despicable category as Zhu Gong. The Li Clan, with its ancestry tracing back to the Immortal Dynasty's imperial line and its fame as a bastion of the righteous path, having lost generations fighting Buddhist cultivators, was afforded his gentle treatment. What backwater demonic cultivator could possibly earn his respect?

Because of this, even though the man was coming to help, he didn't dare set foot in the Great Xiukui Monastery, instead waiting in Jiangbei. His fear and wariness were plain to see.

After a moment, Chen Yin shook his head. "It's all to curry favor with Daoist Master Qiuhu. He desperately needs the Si family's Daoist tradition. The barefooted aren't afraid of those with shoes. When the time comes, he can just flee south, and there will be nothing the Way of Emptiness can do."

Kui Qi nodded in understanding. Li Ximing couldn't help but ask, "Senior Houfu..."

Kui Qi shook his head. "When True Monarchs fight, the mortal world suffers for it. There is a great drought in Shu, and the demonic cultivators of the Western High Plateau are invading from the east. This matter is not normally our concern, but those demonic cultivators are descendants of the Lesser Yang. Our Supreme Yang Dao split from the Lesser Yang, and we have a duty to defend the Western High Plateau in turns. It is now the Xiukui's turn, and we have strength to spare. Houfu must go, and he cannot be easily moved."

He seemed pressed for time. As soon as he finished, his expression turned serious. "Time is short, so I will be brief. This time, I have invited Daoist friend Lingmei to support us from the rear. Several Daoist Masters from Jiangbei will also assess the situation and lend their aid. Now, take this Xiukui spiritual artifact with you... We must slaughter a few Merciful Ones to consecrate our banner!"

His expression grew progressively colder, his voice a low growl. "When the Buddhist cultivators entered Xu all those years ago, we fought a great battle. The Yue Cultivating Sect beat them so badly they were crying for their mothers. They schemed to eliminate Jingzhan, the most zealous advocate for pushing south, and only then did they behave for a few decades. In the conflict between north and south, a few Mahas suffered setbacks, but no blood was shed. And now they have the audacity to test us."

"If we don't beat the dog brains out of these Buddhist cultivators, they will walk all over the Daoist traditions of Jiangnan!"

He took a step and soared into the Great Void, his face grim. The other two followed closely behind. Li Ximing glanced silently at Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin. The old man's eyelids were drooping, and he seemed to let out an almost imperceptible sigh.

***

## Jiangbei

Dark clouds blanketed the sky, and the torrential rain continued unabated. The storm grew more terrifying, and while Baijiang Creek held, its downstream tributaries, the Baiye and Baihai, had broken their banks and changed course multiple times, killing an untold number of common folk.

Only because the great river flowed east, connecting Lake Xian to the Eastern Sea, did the water levels remain stable enough for Jiangnan to be spared. As the Purple Mansion cultivators flew north, the lands of Baiye Creek were littered with floating corpses. The sight darkened Kui Qi's already grim expression. He stared for a long while before speaking.

"What a tragedy! Jiangbei was once so densely populated, and now one can travel for miles without seeing a single household. Apart from a few great clans, there are no common people left to speak of!"

Neither of his companions dared to respond. When they reached the area of Xiaoshi Mountain, they remained concealed. Kui Qi drew out several ink-black jade talismans, pinched his fingers in a divinatory gesture, and gave a meaningful look to Chen Yin, who then crushed a talisman, evidently summoning the Daoist Master who had come to help.

While performing his divination with divine abilities, Kui Qi seemed to be observing their surroundings. He let out a breath and turned to whisper, "We will certainly encounter Taixi first. I will leave him to Senior Yushui; a sword cultivator is always more efficient against him. The Merciful Ones will be for Zhaojing to handle. Zhu Gong eliminated one, so there should still be four of them."

"Don't even consider that Luo fellow. The Zhelu will certainly send someone, but unless their leader makes a move himself, they are no threat!"

He spoke with grave importance. "There is only one thing you must guard against: the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions. That Treasured Artifact is not what it once was. After years of refinement, even I could fall victim to it if caught unaware. Always hold back a portion of your strength!"
