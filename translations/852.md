# Chapter 852: Unyielding Pride

The windswept expanse of Baiku Prefecture.

A haze of yellow sand and dust swept across the city, rising into the sky on a fierce gale. The air, thick with a corrosive Metal Taint, forced passing cultivators to narrow their eyes and squint.

Through the swirling grit, a white-robed old cultivator rode the wind, a frown creasing his brow as he had to close his eyes against the onslaught. He looked down upon the city below.

'This is strange,' he thought. 'This place is near the Capital immortals Dao, a force of the Purple Mansion Realm, yet they allow the Metal Taint to rage like this? Who knows how many thousands of common folk have died... Truly a failure of governance.'

With a trace of pity, he descended, muttering to himself:

'Then again, it's no wonder. I heard they are facing off against the Moongaze Immortal Clan across the river. The two sides have reached a point of fire, and they no longer care about a little Metal Taint... Hmm... The Li Clan is a renowned righteous power, they wouldn't do something like this. So it must be the Capital immortals Dao deliberately stirring up trouble to force the Li Clan to divert their attention to a rescue...'

'What a tragedy!'

He sighed deeply, hesitating for a moment before finally shaking his head.

'I should go down and take a look... When I followed the General to repel the Buddhist cultivators, we never let the local people suffer so grievously. Now the Immortal Dao flourishes, yet such calamities still exist...'

The old Daoist passed through the clouds, and sure enough, he saw scattered corpses on the streets. Not a soul paid them any mind, as if they couldn't see these mortals. Instead, everyone was flocking toward a teahouse in the city's center.

He halted his Dharma Art and landed on a roof, where he saw a Qi Refining cultivator locked in a fierce duel with an Embryonic Breathing cultivator.

"Ah?"

He stared in disbelief. The Embryonic Breathing cultivator, wielding a Dharma Art sword, was parrying and destroying every incoming attack. Though he appeared to be struggling, he was not only holding his own against the Qi Refining cultivator, but doing so with a surprising, fluid grace.

"Oh!"

The old Daoist took two steps forward, stroking his beard as he watched.

The youth had a few streaks of blood on his face. He stood on the stage, a picture of dignity, his unyielding pride like a sharp sword piercing the heavens. The long sword in his hand danced with increasing ferocity, a sight worthy of high praise.

In stark contrast, the robed young master facing him had a face like thunder and trembling hands, barely able to form his techniques. His eyes were wide and reddened as he roared:

"You... you... what kind of Demon art did you use! How can you stand against my Qi Refining Dharma Art!"

The young man across from him was only at the peak of Embryonic Breathing, yet his demeanor was extraordinary. Despite his torn robes, his expression was tenacious and unyielding as he replied with haughty defiance:

"A frog in a well! Have you never heard that man's will can conquer heaven? I possess a valiant spirit, an unyielding pride, and an ambition that soars to the clouds. With these three alone, even if I were a mere mortal, the greatest divine ability could not harm me in the slightest, let alone a petty Qi Refining cultivator like you!"

"You couldn't do anything to me at the peak of Embryonic Breathing, and now that you've become a Qi Refining cultivator, you're still a worthless wretch!"

"Witness my blade!"

As his words fell, streamers of white energy surged from his sword, not only shredding the incoming Dharma Art but also flying forward to slash the robed young man.

A spray of blood erupted, and the young man fell to the ground with a pale face, writhing in pain. He spat out venomously:

"Why! I've been cultivating for ten years without a single day of rest... Losing to you once was bad enough, but I even paid a countless price to get that one spiritual resource, and barely managed to break through to Qi Refining in three months. Why did I lose to your three months of cultivation!"

The swordsman stepped slowly forward, his blade aimed at the other's throat. His voice was cold and mocking.

"How laughable. You ask me why? Why not ask... why those cultivators with less talent still fall behind you after ten years? Why those cultivators with less family support still fall behind you? Only useless scions like you, who have never tasted the world, would plead for fairness... Tomorrow, a beggar on the street might stumble upon a treasure and with the flick of a finger, turn your ten years of effort to ash! Will you ask 'why' then?"

The scion was struck speechless, dragging his body two inches on the ground, leaving a trail of blood. The people around them stood still as statues, rooted to the spot. The swordsman stepped forward, placing his foot on the scion's face. He let out a light laugh.

"If the world's cultivation depended on effort, the donkey that pulls the millstone would be the top Immortal in the world. I have the ambition to touch the clouds, and six months of cultivation is enough for me to kill you. All you can do is accept it, for you have no other choice."

"You people simply pretend you don't see what you can't change. You should be complaining about spiritual aptitude and fortune, as those are the things that are truly unfair! How many people have you crushed with your family's influence? And now, it's your turn to complain about your own family and fortune, and you feel jealous and resentful..."

The scion's eyes were about to burst from their sockets. He groaned, "I didn't..."

But before he could finish, his expression shifted. The looks of pity from the surrounding crowd turned to disgust, and a look of shame appeared on his own face. The youth kicked him hard in the chest.

*CRACK!*

An unknown number of bones broke, leaving the scion unable to move. The youth slowly lowered his head, staring at him. The defiant look suddenly vanished from his face, replaced by a strange, knowing smile.

"The present world doesn't change according to your wishes, understand? Nothing is unfair. My standing here is the greatest fairness."

The scion didn't understand what he was saying. When he saw the youth raise his sword, his face twisted in terror, and he quickly began to beg for mercy. A look of utter disdain appeared on the young man's face. He sneered:

"Wang Jie! You lose the fight and then kneel to beg for a pathetic life. You have no unyielding pride, no heart for the Immortal Dao, and no soaring ambition. You only possess the demeanor of a groveling rat, wagging your tail for a bit of pity! I spared your life once, but you have still not learned. You deserve death!"

The scion screamed in utter despair, but then a powerful roar came from the sky above.

"How dare you! Harm my son and die!"

A figure appeared in the heavens, a colossal hand descending from the sky with a crushing pressure! The crowd below gasped in unison.

"It's Baiku City Lord, Wang Bakong!"

"Lin Feng is in trouble now!"

Lin Feng stood his ground, completely unafraid. On the other side, an old Daoist appeared, gently catching the man's Dharma Art. The corpses on the ground were swept away, and black blood splattered everywhere.

"This one is Bai Yinzi! I rarely see a genius like this, so I ask that you hold your hand, fellow Daoist!"

Wang Bakong's normally dignified face was twisted with rage. He bellowed, "What kind of rogue cultivator are you! How dare you interfere with my affairs!"

Bai Yinzi had only become a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator by a stroke of luck, and his strength was no match for the other man. But seeing such an unpolished gem, he was unwilling to let go. His scalp tingled, and he quickly scooped up the young man below, riding the wind to escape. He called out, "Your esteemed son is safe, so a simple apology will suffice! Why the need for such a great battle, City Lord!"

The youth stood silently behind him. He cupped his fists and thanked him.

"Thank you, Senior, for your righteous intervention. Lin Feng thanks you!"

"Hey."

Bai Yinzi shook his head, keeping an eye on their pursuer. "It was nothing more than a passing fancy! Let's find a place to land in Jiangbei so we can have a proper talk!"

He had completely forgotten about the Metal Taint problem. Behind them, Wang Bakong's eyes were wide with fury, and he was about to give chase when he heard his son groaning on the ground. The young man, relieved of the pressure, fainted. Wang Bakong had no choice but to stop, his eyes red with heartache. He cried out, "What a malicious trick that little beast used!"

Tears welled in his eyes as he helped his son up. He gritted his teeth and said, "Wang He wouldn't see me... he made me wait at the foot of the mountain for months... which allowed this person to take advantage and cause you such great harm..."

He held his eldest son with a grim expression, a vicious thought in his heart.

'So be it! So be it! I thought that since this place is near the Capital immortals Dao and my line is close with Wang He, we should stay close to the Capital immortals Dao... But I never imagined this man would be so heartless!'

Wang Bakong's gaze swept over the crowd. The people below immediately scattered, muttering among themselves. The two guards on either side of the stage stepped forward, only to be harshly slapped by the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. They fell off the stage, spitting up blood.

'Useless fools!'

He called for someone else, his expression dark. He lowered his voice. "Is that Wang Quwan... also cultivating in the Jiangbei area now?"

A nearby cultivator nodded quickly, whispering, "I heard he's cultivating in this area... I don't know why he hasn't returned to his own clan's mountain... but I've heard that he's refused to see anyone who goes to see him..."

"Got it."

Wang Bakong turned around, holding his son. The unconscious Wang Jie was covered in cold sweat and suddenly stirred, muttering in a trembling voice about unyielding pride and soaring ambition.

Moongaze Lake.

Early autumn had arrived again, and the leaves on the trees by the lake were turning red and yellow. The old man rode the wind, speeding toward the main hall. He landed outside and, without stepping over the threshold, bowed from a distance. He could see two figures standing within the hall.

The person at the head of the hall wore crimson robes and was holding a writing brush, lost in thought. The other, wearing a court dress, was dignified and held a small cyan-colored orb in her hand.

Seeing Qu Bushi bow, the man at the head of the hall raised his eyebrows, then spoke to Li Minggong:

"Great-aunt's words make sense. Since Zhuang Pingye is returning to the Great Desert, it's only right to give him a reminder. Tell him to pass on a message to Zhuang Cheng... to tell them not to go to Jiangbei."

He mused, "Tell them that our family's war with the Capital immortals Dao is dangerous and involves Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. It would be best if the Zhuang family didn't come East to avoid any accidents... Zhuang Cheng is a famous person in the Great Desert, so he should listen to the warning... As for how effective it will be..."

Li Jiangqian let out a slight sigh and replied, "That depends on the intentions of those above. If they already intend to get involved, they won't be able to escape no matter how much they try to hide."

Li Minggong nodded slightly. Li Jiangqian then said, "Report."

Only then did Qu Bushi enter the hall to bow. He said respectfully, "My Lord, Wang Jie has been defeated for the second time... I heard this time he almost lost his life. It was only because his father returned in time that he was saved. He intended to seek revenge, but Lord Lin... Lord Lin was rescued... by an old Foundation Establishment Realm Daoist."

Qu Bushi was not foolish. He had been involved in the affairs of the North and was in contact with the Capital immortals Dao. Although he didn't know the full truth, he had already guessed that Lin Feng's identity was extraordinary. When he said "Lord Lin," Li Jiangqian paused for a moment. He didn't correct him, nor did he ask about the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's identity. Instead, he asked with a serious expression:

"Was it done according to my instructions?"

"Your subordinate followed the command precisely! All the information was gathered from casual chats in taverns. It's strange, but perhaps because the story is so entertaining, it's spreading at a startling speed... as if everyone enjoys talking about it..."

Li Jiangqian nodded silently. Qu Bushi continued, "On another matter... the message has already been passed to Lord Gong. He was very grateful and asked me to tell you... that he received news that the Protector Black Rat has figured out the source of the mineral veins and suspects Lord Lin. He has personally gone to Baiku Prefecture and should be meeting with Wang Bakong."

Li Jiangqian waved his hand, dismissing the man. He then looked at Li Minggong and said softly, "The North Shore has always been under the care of Chen Yang. I hear that Fei Qingya's cultivation speed is astonishing. She was only at the fifth layer when she arrived, but she has already broken through to the sixth layer of Embryonic Breathing. She's more talented than most of our direct descendants."

"Daoist Master Tinglan didn't give any instructions on what kind of spiritual resource to give her... and Daoist Master Qiuhu hasn't sent any directions either... so we'll have to decide for ourselves on how to let her consolidate her cultivation."

Li Minggong pondered for a moment before replying, "What's your idea?"

Li Jiangqian smiled faintly. "The River-Center Clear Qi."

How could they miss such a perfect opportunity when the Li family's Great River and Grand Mound Scripture has yet to be unsealed? As long as Fei Qingya takes the River-Center Clear Qi, she will eventually need the subsequent cultivation methods. If she emerges from seclusion within three years, even a slight hint could make it very likely that Lin Feng would solve the problem for her!

A task that a group of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators couldn't accomplish might not be so difficult for a True Monarch!

Li Minggong's eyes lit up, and she nodded repeatedly. Li Jiangqian leaned back in his chair and laughed.

"Protector Chen takes great care of her. He's worried she won't have a good cultivation method, so he will not only give her a portion of the River-Center Clear Qi but also find a suitable matching cultivation method for her..."

"He said... since their cultivation methods are similar, it would be easier for him to offer guidance."

Li Minggong looked at him, shaking her head with a helpless smile. "What can you say? Our Protector Chen is just so warm-hearted."

Li Jiangqian chuckled. "But Protector Chen also laments that the clan's inherited cultivation method is sealed by a secret art, and the method to open it has been lost. It's a great pity that it would take a genius to unlock it!"

With the matter settled, Li Jiangqian put down his brush. He said, "By the way, Protector Chen's family has raised good children. They are now adults and their talent is quite high. They have already reached the Qi Refining stage. The one who came to the clan to report his breakthrough is his second son, Chen Jinxi. He also has a nephew named Chen Jinbao, and both are very promising. According to the Old Master, they're no worse than the An Xuanxin brothers."

Li Minggong was hearing this for the first time. Se looked up in slight surprise and nodded. "The Chen family is very low-key... I only knew that those people existed, but I never knew they could be compared to the two An brothers... What great talent!"

Li Jiangqian nodded silently, stroking the jade cup. "Jiangliang has also entered the Qi Refining stage. It's a good time to assign him a subordinate. The members of the Chen Clan are known to be capable and efficient officials, and you rarely see a useless one among them, so it's a suitable match."

Li Minggong smiled and nodded, feeling a sense of relief.

'How lucky that Zhouwei has so many children. If he had one less, with only Xinghan, Zhoufang, and at most Jiangzong and Zhouda, we wouldn't be able to keep so many geniuses in check...'

Li Jiangqian didn't seem to be thinking about anything in particular. He said casually, "Fei Qing'yi is still quite obedient. He doesn't dare return to the North Shore anymore, and spends his days diligently working in the island. It's as if he wants to make up for his mistakes. He's a bit clumsy, but his attitude is very proactive."

Li Minggong sighed. "How can he not be proactive? The entire Fei family is watching him, terrified that you won't be satisfied."

Li Jiangqian scoffed. "The matter doesn't concern me. The Fei family has good fortune. Whether they are good or bad, Fei Qingyi, Fei Qing'yi, and Fei Qingya, at least these three have managed to continue the family's legacy!"
