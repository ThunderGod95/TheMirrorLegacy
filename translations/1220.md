# Chapter 1220: Seeking Evil

Over the great desert, yellow sand rolled as a vapor like white mist drifted from the west, pervading the air like cotton wisps until it struck a towering platinum stage and scattered to the four winds, while high above, the grand hall shimmered with interwoven gold and white, imposing and majestic.

Bright lamps dotted the grand hall's interior, where a man in crimson robes sat in the host's seat, set down his jade cup, and smiled.

“My apologies for the trouble, Daoist Cheng Qian.”

The Daoist Master before him sat cross-legged, a ball of silver light hovering above his left hand, upon which a potent divine ability coiled as it was continuously nurtured; upon hearing this, he raised his eyebrows and smiled.

“This is nothing—it was for my own safety, so how could it be considered a bother? Senior Yuanbian is still rushing about outside… I am truly ashamed.”

Cheng Qian possessed neither Li Que'wan's Shaman-Register Dao-Profundity nor the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron, so even with a talisman refined by Li Que'wan for him to nurture, he still found it strenuous; while it didn't completely divert his focus, he still couldn't manage the task with Li Que'wan's effortless ease.

Li Jiangqian observed this with a faint smile, just as he heard footsteps outside the hall.

It was Liu Changdie.

He had only guarded the great desert for seven days before seeing the fur-clad Daoist Master arrive at the hall, travel-worn and with a thoughtful expression on his face. Li Jiangqian had heard his estimate of thirty days and never expected him to arrive in just seven, understanding that something had most likely gone wrong with a critical juncture of the cultivation. His heart immediately sank, and he rose in a hurry.

“Senior, this is!”

He stopped in the main hall and, seeing Li Jiangqian come down the steps to greet him, waved his hands repeatedly and offered his congratulations with a smile.

“Your Highness, it is good news!”

Liu Changdie’s expression was a mixture of joy and doubt as he spoke softly.

“I have already surveyed all the points and linked them one by one with my divine ability… It is truly remarkable. The inscription of your clan’s formation patterns and their connection with the qi of the formation points are extremely precise, with the largest error not exceeding a single step… I only needed to connect them one by one with my divine ability… I had originally thought it would take at least thirty days, but I never imagined it would be finished in seven!”

“The formation can be established now!”

He was clearly puzzled by something, but noticing Cheng Qian to the side, he did not elaborate and instead revealed a formation diagram in his hand. Li Jiangqian loved this kind of straightforward efficiency, and his eyes lit up.

“Excellent! I will dispatch men to act as Dharma Protectors for you, Senior!”

And so, the arrangements were made. Liu Changdie burned incense and bathed, entering a meditative state for three days to bring his aura and spirit to their absolute peak—although his vital blood was damaged and his divine ability weakened, he still summoned every ounce of his concentration.

He stepped into the Great Void, appearing in the skies in an instant. Below his feet, fierce winds roiled and sand flew across the great desert. Groups of cultivators had already taken their positions on the stage. Liu Changdie pressed his palms together and performed a grand salute to the starless, boundless sky, only then activating his divine ability and respectfully chanting.

“Let the body dissolve into concealment, and the treasury be established to invite the metal.”

He formed a sword sign with both hands, each pointing in a different direction, and the two formation platforms below instantly lit up. The light of the Lesser Yang surged forth, transforming into a thick, flowing radiance that moved in accordance with his two fingers.

This flowing light was ethereal and natural, emitting a dense white qi. As his fingers moved, the formation platforms lit up one by one, and the cultivators below formed hand seals in coordination.

When all seven formation platforms were shining brightly, Liu Changdie’s figure vanished in a flash. The dense light of the Lesser Yang rushed back, and in an instant, seven pillars of light shot up from the land, connecting with the sky!

“Boom!”

The fierce winds in the desert intensified in an instant as lights of various colors bloomed one after another across the sands. At the center of the grand formation, flying sand and profound stone gathered, finally raising an eighth profound stage!

This stage rose with a great rumble, golden sand cascading down its sides like a waterfall. It ascended to a height of over two hundred and twenty ren before showing any sign of stopping. A silver light flickered indistinctly above, and his profound furs fluttered as the figure of the formation master finally appeared.

He raised his hand, and the formation core shone as brightly as a star. Beneath that star, however, an intersecting brilliance shuttled back and forth, shimmering like water and jade. Beneath the water, a restless fire even flickered, ever-changing!

It was the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance, stimulated into radiance!

Liu Changdie's robes billowed, his divine ability already pushed to its limit. He cupped the edges of the formation core with both hands and, using all his divine ability and dharma power, pressed it down inch by inch, embedding it into the gap reserved on the high stage.

As the final gap was filled, the earth suddenly roared. The seven pillars of light that reached the sky transformed into seven golden chrysanthemums. Myriad golden threads fell one by one, connecting with the formation points on the ground below. A pale white light barrier, unified and colossal, finally stood erect upon the great desert!

The Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil Spirit Formation was complete!

This colossal structure flickered for but a moment under the scorching sun before gradually fading away. The numerous buildings and figures on the ground seemed like an illusion, erased completely from the desert, leaving only the roiling sand to rise in the air.

Li Jiangqian felt a fire in his heart, overjoyed.

“Our family’s second Purple Mansion grand formation… is finally complete!”

To put it bluntly, the Li family had invested more than enough resources into this formation. The top-tier spiritual item, the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance, was of course the core of the formation plate. The supplementary materials for the plate alone included precious spiritual items of ‘Dawn Qi’ and ‘Wandering Metal,’ not to mention the vast amount of spiritual resources expended…

‘Although the ‘Still Earth’ grand formation on the island was built easily, it was ultimately something obtained from another family. The family was in dire straits back then, so we just modified it for our use. How can it compare to this one, into which we’ve poured our heart and soul!’

He descended on a trail of fire, passing through the grand formation. As far as his eyes could see was a surface of platinum jade, and from it, faint cheers rose and fell. When he landed on the central high stage, he found Liu Changdie sitting by the threshold, his face pale, clearly exhausted.

Li Jiangqian rushed to help him up, but his own divine ability and dharma power were of the fire virtue's true nature and could not be transferred to this man of the Vault Metal Dao. He was about to take a medicinal pill from his sleeve when the middle-aged man stopped him.

Fortunately, Cheng Qian, who had followed him in, cultivated the ‘Whole Pill’ and helped him regulate his breathing for a quarter of an hour. Liu Changdie’s complexion visibly improved. His expression was weary but his eyes were bright, filled with a mix of joy and shock. He looked elsewhere and smiled.

“Seventh Young Master, congratulations!”

On the high stage, the radiance of Bright Yang flickered, and a Daoist had already strode in. He was wreathed in the aura of alchemical fire, his face a complex mixture of gratitude. Who else could it be but Li Ximing?

Li Ximing had originally been refining pills in the grotto-heaven. He had already melted the medicinal liquid in recent days, and the rest was just a slow simmering over a gentle flame. Now that it had formed a pill embryo, things were more relaxed. Hearing Li Que'wan’s report, he simply couldn't sit still.

‘This… this friend of my uncle… their friendship is truly like that of family!’

Thus, he tasked the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire to watch over his alchemy furnace, freed himself for a day or two, and rushed to this place. Hearing himself addressed as Seventh Young Master, he sighed faintly.

“My head has been spinning these past few days, with matters of utmost urgency, busy refining pills… These young ones didn't dare disturb me, and I have neglected you, Uncle. A great offense… a great offense indeed!”

He was a Purple Mansion cultivator, after all. Liu Changdie had already recovered his breathing, and his complexion returned to normal. But hearing his words, he frowned.

“Since you are busy refining pills, why did you come out to see me? If you ruin King Wei’s affairs, what is to be done!”

Li Jiangqian understood that his grand-uncle's pill refinement had passed its most difficult stage, but he feared it would be difficult for him to answer. Hearing this, his expression fell, and he spoke with a desolate air.

“One more or one less furnace won’t make much of a difference. Besides, a day or two won't be a problem… Why don't you listen to the wonders of the grand formation before you return, Grand-uncle, lest there be a miscalculation in battle.”

With an outsider present, Liu Changdie couldn't ask too many questions, so he could only nod and say seriously.

“This formation is called the Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil. It is the third Purple Mansion grand formation I have established, and arguably the most valuable one in recent years. Since we are on the topic, there is something I must say.”

Seeing that all eyes were on him, Liu Changdie said:

“I am not of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and I constructed this formation according to the principles of my own lineage. Therefore, this formation has no internal and external division; it cannot partition off a separate world for an inner formation. The sole nexus is this profound stage.”

“This location can sever all internal and external perception, the formation core is also sealed here and serves as the focal point for its many profound abilities, and the spiritual qi of the entire grand formation is channeled here, exclusively for a Purple Mansion cultivator to use!”

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully.

His family’s Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array was a typical grand formation of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, with a clear division between inner and outer. The inner formation could support a complex of palaces for disciples to cultivate in and conceal the Daoist tradition and its spirit ponds. But this Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil Spirit Formation lacked such space; the entire formation’s spiritual reserves were dedicated to supplying the single grand hall on this high stage!

‘This way, although it lacks a place for disciples to cultivate, the benefit to a Purple Mansion cultivator is clearly greater, allowing the spiritual qi supplied to one location to be even more concentrated.’

Seeing Li Ximing nod, he then said:

“The first is the ability of the Ministerial Fire.”

Mentioning this art, a hint of pride appeared on his face.

“Concealed within is a beam of Profound Formation Ministerial Fire Light. It is born from the interaction of Dawn and Wandering, stimulated by the Lesser Yang. It is no bigger than a palm, and though called light, it is in fact neither fire nor light, but belongs to the category of profound lightning. It is impossible to resist. Once struck by the fire, the flames of the Lesser Yang will immediately envelop the body, difficult to dispel and hard to resolve.”

“More importantly, the Ministerial Fire light strikes from within. Although it doesn't have the power to kill an enemy in a single blow, one who is hit by this art will be greatly inconvenienced when they next face an enemy.”

Li Ximing's eyes lit up, and he nodded slightly.

“After all, a grand formation’s purpose is protection, not slaughter. This ability is quite impressive.”

Clearly, this art was far superior to the Purple Qi light from the island. Although the radiance of the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array could reach the Purple Mansion level, in the eyes of the current Li family, it was at best a profound ability comparable to a Spiritual Artifact. But this Ministerial Fire, merely with its effect of being neither fire nor light and impossible to resist, was something no ordinary Spiritual Artifact could achieve.

Liu Changdie, however, shook his head with a smile.

“But that is not all. When I, Liu, set up a formation, I would never create something so mundane. This second ability, the Ministerial Seal, is one such example. Once a cultivator is struck by the Ministerial Fire, this second profound ability can be activated. It will resonate with a certain spiritual item within this formation core, causing the opponent’s divine ability and dharma power to stagnate abruptly. The closer they are to this grand formation, the more effective it will be!”

Because Cheng Qian was present, Liu Changdie did not mention the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance, but the two members of the Li family present understood immediately. Li Jiangqian gave a rare nod of praise.

“With these two abilities, it is already quite formidable in a fight.”

Liu Changdie stroked his beard.

“I am not versed in the ‘Lesser Yang,’ so this is the best I could do; even if I wanted to add more, I couldn't. The key lies within the formation—I have also seen your clan’s formation on the island. Although it has the effect of nurturing a treasured land, the ‘Still Earth’ was only halfway infused with Purple Qi, and the effect is not optimal. So, I have added a formation eye for Your Highness in this formation, which can gather the baleful earth from the desert’s earth veins for cultivation!”

When speaking of formations, the middle-aged man’s face brimmed with confidence, and he smiled.

“I put a lot of thought into this part. ‘Radiant Fire’ is not skilled at nurturing. A singular Radiant Fire grand formation often focuses solely on attack. Even if you were to find a Radiant Fire grand formation, its assistance to cultivation would not be much better than the effect of my interacting Dawn Qi and Lesser Yang—it’s just a pity about one thing.”

A trace of regret appeared on his face.

“Due to the various connections within and its establishment upon the great desert, Dawn Qi had to be used as a medium. I’m afraid it cannot be a place of cultivation for King Wei or the Seventh Young Master…”

“That is of no concern.”

Li Ximing shook his head, his hands behind his back.

Ever since the advent of the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, the foundation of the Li family's Purple Mansion cultivation was no longer on the lake. The spiritual qi of that heaven was inexhaustible, its density rarely seen in the world. In the strictest sense, the direct descendants of the Li family who had received the talismans no longer needed to rely on the lake.

But this could not be seen by others, and it was even more impossible, logically, for the four of them to huddle together on the island. With a place like this to cultivate, Li Jiangqian would be better able to guard the west in the future.

‘What’s more…’

Li Ximing glanced at Cheng Qian with a slightly complicated look.

‘In the future, the lake will probably be even livelier.’

Liu Changdie, unaware of his thoughts, nodded in agreement and smiled.

“But there is more. I won't even mention the minor profound abilities. There is also the ability to Absorb Yang, which has a sensory effect. I refined it by using ‘Vault Metal’ to sense ‘Wandering Metal.’ This profound stage can nurture and store items of the Metal Virtue, which is quite helpful for artifact refinement. If there are any spell arts that need to be cultivated and completed within the body, one can also come to this high stage.”

“There is only one thing: this profound ability cannot be used at will. Therefore, cultivators who have been injured by Metal Malice cannot enter this stage. If they were to step inside, I fear their injuries would never recover and would instead worsen!”

Although this drawback was almost negligible, Liu Changdie still gave a solemn reminder. Li Ximing was no stranger to this—back then, the fact that Li Zhouwei was able to kill Qi Lanyan owed a great deal to this ‘Wandering Metal’ Dao!
Just as he noted this down, Li Jiangqian’s eyes deepened as he secretly pondered:

‘It’s not entirely a drawback. This is clearly a good place to suppress cultivators. As long as they have suffered a metal-attributed injury, just lock them in here. It won’t even take much divine ability to suppress them; the person will weaken day by day on their own.’

Furthermore, there was one profound ability that Liu Changdie had mentioned long ago, which was to use the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance to ambush anyone who tried to break the formation. It was hidden as a trump card, and with Cheng Qian present, it was not mentioned.

After they finished speaking, the three had already walked to the base of the high stage. It was built of golden stone, with intersecting long corridors. High above, the light of the Lesser Yang glittered, illuminating a golden profound plaque hanging in mid-air. Liu Changdie said:

“Since the grand formation is complete, a plaque should be inscribed.”

Li Ximing smiled and shook his head, looking at Li Jiangqian.

“Senior Liu has considered much for you. In the future, this will also be your seat of governance. It should be you who inscribes it.”

The young man took a step forward, his golden eyes gazing at the profound plaque interwoven with platinum and white. He did not refuse. Raising his hand, characters like iron strokes and silver hooks appeared one by one, and the young man smiled.

“I don’t have any particular thoughts. Everything simply follows what is here. The formation follows the desert, and the profound stage follows the formation. Since it is the Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil Spirit Formation, let’s just call this the Seeking Evil Stage!”
