# Chapter 920: The Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul

Cold snow fell thick and fast. A man in white robes leaned against a jade platform, a circular screen of light flickering before him. It revealed a vision that pierced heaven and earth from within the Great Void. Myriad marvels manifested within, all perfectly reflected by the screen, leaving nothing hidden.

Streams of golden radiance descended from the sky, coiling around his body. They continuously converged and merged, forming layer upon layer of brilliant light.

Lu Jiangxian gently extended his hand. A single point of incomparably brilliant gold emerged from his palm, shifting and changing unpredictably.

'The Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence!'

The Immortal Mirror's power had already reached a bottleneck. Even with Li Zhouwei achieving his divine ability, the feedback and subsequent enhancement were not significant. It merely made the world within the mirror feel more spacious, flickering with profound light. The most dramatic reaction, however, came from the Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence right in front of him!

This Bright Yang Metallic Essence glittered, pulsing with inexhaustible energy. As if triggered by something, it surged and climbed, but it was suppressed by the world within the mirror. Unable to break free, it could only release its radiance in futility.

'More than ninety percent of this Bright Yang Metallic Essence was left behind by Li Qianyuan...'

Lu Jiangxian was no longer the same person he was when he first obtained this item. His expression was heavy; he understood the implications of this Metallic Essence.

'If the Metallic Essence in the Sun Seeker Ring belonged to Li Qianyuan, then it is absolutely, one hundred percent, one of Emperor Wei's contingency plans!'

The fact that this item had fallen into his hands, and that the current Li family was even considered part of Emperor Wei's bloodline, all pointed to an extraordinary relationship between the two. The thought left Lu Jiangxian silent.

After an unknown amount of time, he finally focused his mind and peered into the mirror.

The unfathomable Great Void was a stretch of profound darkness. As he concentrated his gaze, the Great Void itself faded, and the dim, lightless scene gave way to an immense yellow radiance that connected heaven and earth, shining brilliantly.

In the distance sat an immense Dharma Body.

The body towered into the clouds, entirely earth-yellow in color. Its lower half was sunk deep into the ground, growing directly from the earth veins. Behind it, rings of multicolored light radiated outward like halos, each as large as a mountain, forming a barrier that nearly sealed off the world. Boundless radiance rippled across its form, swirling around its sides like rolling wind and smoke.

Its eyes were obscured within the dense layers of fog, their expression unreadable. Its pupils were perfect, pitch-black orbs, so dim they held not a single trace of light. Yet, from these same pupils, nine streams of multicolored light manifested and scattered, covering the land below.

This Dharma Body sat quietly cross-legged, its form impossibly vast, positioned directly upon the Luoxia Plain. The entire thousand-li fertile plain seemed to wrap around its smooth belly. Its body was hunched slightly forward, its hands placed in front of it on either side. In one hand was Caishan, and in the other was Xiaoshi Mountain.

And Tangdao Mountain, the very place all the cultivators were defending, rested squarely in its lap!

This Dharma Body was both terrifying and bizarre. It looked like a greedy child hugging half a watermelon, staring at it intently, unwilling to let go.

From start to finish, whether it was Kui Qi, Li Ximing, Tinglan, Che Hong, or Helian Wujiangâ€”all of these cultivators from both north and south were fighting their battles right under its nose, right within its grasp!

Lu Jiangxian watched with extreme caution, careful not to reveal his presence in the Great Void. He calculated silently:

'It looks like a True Monarch of Earth Virtue, but not one who has reached Fruition Attainment... It must be some Wu Earth Auxiliary Position.'

'The Luoxia Wu Light path has positions for both Heavenly Glow and Wu Earth. Needless to say, this True Monarch must have descended from Mount Luoxia, coming to Luoxia specifically!'

'What is he doing here...'

'With a True Monarch standing guard, no matter how intense this war becomes, the spiritual energies and earth veins of the various lands will certainly be safe. But surely a True Monarch wouldn't need to come here personally just for that?'

'I wonder who he's waiting for. What an impenetrable defense.'

He heavily averted his gaze, letting it fall upon the table before him.

On the white jade platform lay a short sword. It was entirely silver-white, with a hilt one inch long. It rested flat, close at hand. The cold snow drifting down from the sky landed on the blade, only to slide off an instant later.

For a long time, Lu Jiangxian had been unable to interact with the outside world, forced to rely on spiritual items of the Supreme Yin lineage to make any exchange... But now, following the enrichment of the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, he could finally create things beyond the scope of Supreme Yin spiritual items!

This Sorcery Blade before him was the masterpiece of all his shamanic arts and Dao-Profundity!

'Chi Buzi... I must try to save this chess piece. But whether I succeed or fail, I cannot expose myself... This sword is the key!'

...

Inside the Supreme Yin Manor.

The moment Chi Buzi heard his smug tone, he poured a bucket of cold water on him, sighing:

"Easy for you to be smug! We've heard no news from above, yet the deadline approaches day by day. This time we managed to send up one of the Buddhists, but where are we going to find the next one?"

In the past, such a reprimand and a healthy dose of anxiety would have instantly ruined Dangjiang's mood, sending him into a spiral of frowning, overthinking, and muttering. But this time was completely different. The man just sneered and replied:

"Who the hell do you think I am? You do the labor, I do the thinking. We're not even on the same level! I already took care of everything!"

"Oh?"

Chi Buzi felt a flash of pleasant surprise, but immediately suspected he was bluffing. He asked, intrigued:

"And what exactly does that mean?"

Dangjiang laughed. "Hurry up and come with me! Immortal Attendant Shaohui instructed me long ago... As soon as you succeeded and came to the upper realm, I was to bring you to see her!"

"Excellent!"

Chi Buzi was overjoyed. He might be bluffing about other things, but a meeting with their superior was not something you could fake. Filled with delight, he followed him out and once again saw the two attendant women at the hall's entrance.

The one holding the pipa was still holding her pipa, but the attendant who had carried a bamboo basket now held a jade tray. On it were wisps and tufts of something like white cotton, each about the length of a finger, glowing faintly.

Having learned his lesson from the 'Golden Branch of the Moon Laurel,' Chi Buzi's eyes burned with fervor. His stare made the hairs on Dangjiang's neck stand on end, who quickly tugged his sleeve and whispered:

"You still haven't finished paying off the last one!"

Chi Buzi silently shook his head. As he followed him out, he whispered back secretly:

"It's only right that I haven't! What do you think that thing was? Up here, they keep it simple and call it the 'Golden Branch of the Moon Laurel.' But to those bastards at the Chunyi Dao Gate, it's known as the 'Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch'!"

The moment he heard the name from the Chunyi Dao Gate, he knew it was an extraordinary treasure. Many spiritual items are recorded in the ancient texts of various Daos, but only those who specialize in that path can recognize which item corresponds to which name. He narrowed his eyes slightly and cautioned:

"That name sounds vaguely familiar to me. Do you know of it?"

Dangjiang shook his head. "I'm a relic from ages ago. How the hell would I know!"

Seeing he wouldn't say, Chi Buzi grew more suspicious. "I never thought about it before. This time, when I go out, I absolutely must investigate this clearly."

The two walked through the corridor together. Chi Buzi's powers of observation were incredibly sharp; he immediately noticed that there seemed to be fewer people around. He whispered, "What's going on?"

Only when reminded did Dangjiang realize it himself. He was alarmed, but shook his head silently. The pavilion to their side was already upon them, leaving no time for more questions. Chi Buzi could only brace himself and push the door open.

The pavilion was much messier than before, with numerous attendants bustling about. The two made their way to the highest floor and saw the Immortal Attendant in tea-white robes sitting at a desk, intently focused on a scroll in front of her.

"Your subordinates pay their respects, Immortal Attendant!"

The two paid their respects from the side. Shaohui immediately looked up and forced a smile.

"Ah, it's you... Rest assured, I've called you here this time with good news."

Chi Buzi hurriedly expressed his thanks, listening as the Immortal Attendant above spoke to him with rare politeness:

"You found a hidden place last time, do you recall? Why don't you tell me about it?"

How could Chi Buzi possibly forget something that concerned his own life-or-death arrangements? He immediately replied with utmost respect:

"Reporting to Your Excellency, the place is within an immortal formation, situated beneath the 'Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance.' A certain highness once said personally that not even a True Monarch can perceive it or enter it. It is an excellent refuge!"

"Oh..."

Shaohui said softly, "You are quite clever. The Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance is the supreme and wondrous light of the Supreme Yang. That location is of considerable importance, and the jade tablet there is even more critical. An authority in the manor specifically sought me out to record a great merit in your name!"

The moment Chi Buzi heard this, he knew why he had been summoned. Dangjiang's bragging was just hot air, but Chi Buzi already knew his character and didn't care in the slightest. Overjoyed, he replied:

"Thank you, Your Excellency! This was all due to Your Excellency's guidance. How could it be considered my merit..."

Shaohui, however, was not in the mood for pleasantries and didn't take his bait, merely shaking her head.

"You are correct, it is a place that not even a True Monarch can perceive. Since such a location exists, I will not go back on the promise I made you. I have already procured what you need."

She retrieved a small box from her sleeve. Lifting it gently, she placed it on the desk. An attendant immediately came forward, picked up the box, and carried it down to him.

Chi Buzi's mind reeled from her words. A look of deep, ecstatic gratitude spread across his face as he thanked her profusely. Only when the box was in his hands did Shaohui speak again.

"There are two items inside."

"First, the 'Morning Rain Clear Cloud Art.'"

As soon as she said this, half of Chi Buzi's anxieties were settled. He listened as the female cultivator continued:

"For this, I requested an Immortal General to modify the 'Dao-Seeking Clear Cloud Art' belonging to 'Morning Cold Rain,' which was in the repository. We incorporated some of the essence of Pristine Water and changed it into the current 'Morning Rain Clear Cloud Art.' In your lower realm's terms, it's considered an ancient method and not particularly powerful, but I specifically sought approval from the authorities. It is usable."

Chi Buzi sighed. "To revise a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation art is something only a great cultivator with vast divine abilities can accomplish, let alone one that travels such a narrow and difficult path. That it could be successfully created is already miraculous. This lowly cultivator is filled with boundless admiration. How could I dare speak of it being 'powerful' or 'not powerful'..."

Shaohui smiled. "You're right about that. The main thing is that this touch of Pristine Water essence looks very promising in the eyes of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Conversely, in the eyes of a True Monarch... they will just think you are walking the dead-end path of seeking the Purple Mansion Realm through Pristine Water."

Chi Buzi nodded quickly. Though his heart was pounding with anticipation, he continued to hold the box respectfully, not moving a muscle until she had finished speaking. Shaohui continued:

"The second item is the 'World-Borrowing, Mind-Detaining Sorcery.'"

"Please elaborate, Your Excellency!"

Chi Buzi quickly bowed his head, watching as Shaohui gave a quiet order. "Bring the item here."

An attendant came forward holding a jade tray. In the center lay a short sword, no longer than a palm. It was entirely silver-white with a one-inch hilt. It had no dazzling radiance; its light was restrained, flowing subtly over the blade.

"This is the 'Profound Blade of the Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul.'"

Chi Buzi's fervent gaze swept over it, but he couldn't detect the slightest aura from the treasure. Though light flowed across its surface, it looked ordinary. Only the occasional flash of silver light hinted that this item was anything but simple.

"This item is the perfect match for the 'World-Borrowing, Mind-Detaining Sorcery.' All the wondrous effects you desire, this art can achieve!"

Shaohui's tone was calm, but her words were unbelievable:

"I understand your plan. The 'World-Borrowing, Mind-Detaining Sorcery' is a profound and wondrous soul technique. It can wash away memories and store them elsewhere. And the 'Profound Blade of the Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul' is a marvelous treasure that can store those severed memories within itself! Including your memories from the heavens."

Chi Buzi's eyes narrowed slightly. He understood. He met the woman's gaze, then immediately bowed deeply, his voice low.

"Your Excellency is brilliant..."

'The 'Profound Blade of the Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul'... Good... very good... And the immortal formation. Now, everything is ready!'

Who was Chi Buzi? In that instant, he had already sorted through the entire sequence of events and devised a foolproof plan:

'I will hide the 'Profound Blade of the Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul' within that immortal formation. I just need to leave a single breadcrumb, a small clue. I'll arrange it so that, just before I make my final decision, I meet with someone who cannot possibly be divined. They will give me a hint, prompting me to visit the formation, and I will retrieve my memories!'

And if he asked someone for a hint, that interaction also wouldn't remain in his memory. Even if Pristine Water itself inspected his soul, he would find no clues. As a Great Daoist Master of the Purple Mansion Realm, there were far too many people he could, and would, interact with.

Putting others aside, he wouldn't even need to 'accidentally' visit Penglai. If he just met with Pu Yu, he was confident he could leave some verbal cue for his future self, and then calmly forget it.

His mind raced. In a corner of the pavilion, unseen by all, the man in white sat, watching him quietly.

'For a clever man, you don't need to say much. Just giving him the tools is enough...'

The body of this sword was formed from a Supreme Yin spiritual item and a Lesser Yin divine ability. He had imbued it with all manner of shamanic arts to grant it the wondrous power to evade inspection and divination, as well as the divine ability to cleanse a soul... And that peacock soul of the Merciful One, which he had acquired long ago, had also been placed inside.

All of this was merely a vessel. The most crucial component was the Talisman Seed carried by that peacock soul!

This was the origin of the sword's power to evade inspection and divination. It was less a short sword and more the reincarnation of that Demon beast. It used the divine abilities on the sword as its body, possessed a soul, and was bound by a Talisman Seed! Naturally, it was impossible to inspect and impossible to divine!

'This way, with a single thought, this sword will instantly vanish without a trace, carried by the Talisman Seed back into the Immortal Mirror... leaving nothing behind!'

The so-called memory storage operated on the same principle. Lu Jiangxian had no 'metal and stone' on hand to refine a proper artifact, and he absolutely could not leave any traces. These heavenly matters could not be recorded on any jade slip, nor could Chi Buzi split his own soul. Instead, he could entrust his memories to the soul within the sword, thereby gaining the ability to 'carry' them. If there was even the slightest chance of exposure, Lu Jiangxian could make it all vanish with a single thought!

And that soul, bound by the Talisman Seed, was conveniently undetectable and undivinable!
