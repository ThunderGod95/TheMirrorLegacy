# Chapter 719: When Heaven Leaks, The Sea Rises

Li Xizhi was suddenly moved. He opened his mouth slightly, then simply pulled her into his arms and spoke gently, "Xiao'er, if it weren't for you, I would have perished in that sea long ago..."

His gentle words made Yang Xiao'er smile sweetly. She wrapped her slender hands around his neck, nestled into his embrace and whispered softly, "Don‚Äôt say that... please don‚Äôt blame us for not sending word to warn you... After all, those at the Purple Mansion Realm had just suffered a loss, and several brothers were reassigned..."

Li Xizhi shook his head and hurriedly instructed, "This matter is most likely the doing of the Chi Family. It must not be revealed. Act as if it never happened, I only used an excuse to come to this Xia Mountain..."

He explained the events in detail, leaving out what was in his qihai. Yang Xiao'er, clever as she was, understood and said with a nod, "Alright, I understand."

As the two spoke in detail for a while, they suddenly felt the mountains beneath their feet begin to tremble. White mist rose into the sky, blanketing the clouds and transforming into various illusions.

White petals, trailing smoke, drifted down, making the sound of jade pearls colliding. A cold and calm voice echoed, as if emerging from the void. It was neither loud nor soft, just perfectly clear beside the ear.

"I am Shangyuan. Today in the Northern Sea, I have attained the Dao and achieved the Jade True Unified Void Essence, ascending to the rank of True Monarch..."

Though the voice was not forceful, it made both of them rise with shock on their faces. The couple exchanged glances and quickly bowed, "Congratulations to True Monarch Shangyuan, the Jade True Unified Void Essence True Monarch..."

As the two offered congratulations from afar, a scene of bowed figures offering blessings spread across heaven and earth. Not only were all manner of people and demonic creatures on Xia Mountain solemnly saluting, but cultivators across the mainland and the four seas also looked up, respectfully sending their congratulations.

He has truly become a True Monarch... Li Xizhi sighed lightly, filled with emotion. The Heavenly Glow in his hand rose, still carrying disbelief. When he looked back at Yang Xiao'er, she too wore a shocked expression.

Over the years, many true cultivators had attempted to break through to the Golden Core Realm. Chi Wei and Duanmu Kui of Yue State were prime examples. Even in Wu State and the outer seas, both humans and demonic creatures had tried, but none had succeeded.

Even Dongfang You, a descendant of the Dragon Monarch, with terrifyingly deep reserves, failed in his breakthrough and burst into black clouds.

Though Shangyuan had long been regarded as the foremost of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and drew the most spectators to his ceremonies in recent years. So many before him had held that same title, yet he alone truly broke through in the end, which was still astonishing.

Li Xizhi, a disciple of Azure Pond Sect‚Äôs Immortal Peak, now on the verge of becoming its peak master, had some understanding of the Purple Mansion Realm and the Golden Core Realm.

The Golden Core Dao refined the Metallic Essence, and those who gained Fruition Attainment were remarkable beings. Writing carelessly about them could have offended a True Monarch, so there were no detailed records within the sect. Most knowledge was hearsay.

Once one achieved the Golden Core Realm, the Metallic Essence would remain in the world and the physical body would last a thousand years. The spirit would persist through reincarnation and be nearly indestructible. Each Golden Core corresponded to a Fruition Attainment of heaven and earth, and occupying that position granted powers akin to immortals.

In his heart, he thought silently, I've heard that the Jade True Fruition Attainment has long been vacant. Doesn't this mean that True Monarch Shangyuan, having broken through, can now ascend to that position and become the Master of Jade True...

Daoist Master Shangyuan has always hated evil with a burning passion. How could the northern Buddhist cultivators tolerate him... Of the Seven Daos, Wrath has already fallen, and at least three of the remaining six daos harbor deep hatred for him...

Li Xizhi looked northward and saw a bright, dazzling comet falling from the sky. It streaked along the heavens toward the north and plunged into the Northern Sea.

As soon as the comet fell, the Taibai Star began to flicker. It looked like an eye that was blinking rapidly. Emerald light streamed across the sky, it was intense and turbulent.

Li Xizhi's eyes grew blurry, as if he were in a half-dream, unable to tell what exactly he was seeing. Until the talisman seed in his qihai flickered, sending a wave of clarity into his mind. Only then did he gradually come back to his senses.

A Golden Core battle spell!

With the aid of this clarity, he could faintly make out the distant scene. After a few breaths, the stars in the sky reversed their motion, and another star lit up blindingly, blooming with red-tinged white light.

Li Xizhi studied it closely as he had never seen this star before. Looking at its sector of the sky, he saw three subsidiary stars trailing behind it, though only one was lit.

One of the three...

Thanks to the talisman seed within him, he was not overwhelmed by the distant might. He quickly took mental notes and saw a massive figure flicker into view in the distance. It appeared to have six arms and was holding a lotus-shaped dharma artifact.

Could it be a Buddhist cultivator...

But the figure only flashed for an instant, then emerald light flared, the comet fell and the red-white star blazed. The brown light streamed, the six-armed figure instantly deflated and exploded into a sky full of golden essence.

The comet's light was extremely intense, as if in a furious rage, it even wiped clean all the scattered golden essence in the sky. Lights twisted and tangled, shaking the very mountain beneath their feet.

Seeing this, even with the clarity preserving his awareness, Li Xizhi's eyes stung with tears. He feared that looking any further would damage his perception technique and he had to lower his gaze.

He wiped his tears and took a brief rest, but the sky dimmed. In the north, a pitch-black hue appeared, and meteors streaked across the heavens, trailing flames as they shot southward.

Beside him, Yang Xiao'er tugged at him with some concern. Suddenly, they heard the sea roar. The waves parted sharply and from within rose a massive creature, a white-gray scaled beast.

The beast had four strong limbs, each stepping on a cloud. Its waist and belly were long, and its tail was covered in densely packed scales the size of tabletops. It sped through the mist, letting out a long, echoing howl.

Li Xizhi quickly bowed his head and said quietly, "Greetings, great demonic beast..."

The scaled beast circled in the air, gazed carefully toward the north, then rode the clouds swiftly in that direction.

Li Xizhi looked north with concern. Beside him, Yang Xiao'er watched the great demonic beast of the Purple Mansion Realm depart and said softly, "Husband, something major is happening... I fear the True Monarch Shangyuan has started fighting the Buddhist sects."

Li Xizhi had already expected this after what he saw, but could not explain much to his wife. He merely shook his head in silence and watched as the meteors rained down, falling across the mainland and the four seas.

He stepped forward hesitantly. The couple rode the wind down from Xia Mountain, approaching the water's surface which reflected countless rays of Heavenly Glow. Li Xizhi wore a solemn expression, while Yang Xiao'er looked startled, "Huh?"

Xia Mountain was a columnar peak rising from the seabed, with smooth and delicate cliffs covered in iridescent layers of Heavenly Glow. It was exceptionally beautiful. She flew all the way to the point where the mountain met the sea and saw a swiftly descending waterline along the cliff face. In a serious tone, she said, "Husband... the waters of the Eastern Sea are receding..."

Indeed, the highest tide mark on the cliff wall and the current waterline differed by an inch. Li Xizhi examined it closely and said with a grave expression, "No wonder the great demonic beast was alarmed. The Converging Sea is the most stable region of the Eastern Sea, and Xia Mountain is a wonder of heaven and earth. Under normal conditions, the sea level never fluctuates more than a finger's breadth. If even the Converging Sea is like this, one can imagine the state of the other seas!"

Yang Xiao'er pressed her lips together and asked, "Then what should we do now..."

"Xia Mountain is the safest place," said Li Xizhi. Then, he flew back to the mountain with her, worrying in his heart, I wonder how things are back home...

Coincidentally, Yang Xiao'er beside him also looked concerned. She thought, The ancestor broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, yet just so happened to encounter such heavenly changes... who knows if it affected him!

Northern Sea.

When Li Xuanfeng woke, the sky was dim. He opened his eyes and looked toward the horizon where the stars and moon still hung properly in the sky. The once-blue havenly sea had vanished and the comet was nowhere to be seen.

Everything that had manifested faded into nothingness, leaving only the distant north where dark shadows of various sizes lingered between the stars. The moonlight and starlight had both dimmed.

Li Xuanfeng slowly raised his arm. Most of his golden armor had turned a brilliant white, glowing intensely. The iron hooks that once connected the armor plates had all solidified, rendering most of his body immobile.

He struggled twice and sat up. A quiet voice drifted from beside him, "The Golden Supreme Origin Green Core True Monarch of the Golden Feather Sect made a move. Your cultivation and armor were affected. The armor, originally made of Black-Hook Profound Gold, has mostly transformed into White-Bore Origin Gold, it needs to be reforged."

It's Yuan Su. Li Xuanfeng recognized the voice and turned his head in response. Yuan Su was quietly sitting beside him. The earlier image of a face streaming with blue tears seemed like an illusion. He now looked clean and calm, his round face relaxed.

Yuan Su noticed his expression and said with a smile, "Just now, when the True Monarch struck suddenly, I lost control of my emotions for a moment. I felt a flash of hatred and was nearly consumed by the backlash of the Metallic Essence. I almost turned into cave spring water."

Though Yuan Su said this lightly, given that he had reached the end of his lifespan, he clearly didn‚Äôt care much for his own life. Li Xuanfeng responded with lowered eyes and noticed that the reef beneath Yuan Su‚Äôs white robe had turned jade-green.

Li Xuanfeng responded respectfully and asked softly, "May I ask, Daoist Master, have the True Monarchs decided the outcome yet?"

"Not yet." Yuan Su propped his chin with one hand and said softly, "How could it be settled so quickly? Only a few of the True Monarchs showed glimpses of their power and clashed briefly in the Northern Sea."

He pointed toward a patch of darkness in the northern sky, signaling Li Xuanfeng to take a look. Li Xuanfeng squinted and saw the black voids of various sizes scattered among the stars which he had already found strange earlier.

Yuan Su said in a low voice, "The True Monarchs fought for several days and punched holes in the sky above the Northern Sea. They've ascended to the Outer Heavens now.

"I couldn't see too clearly, but during about half an hour of battle, a northern Buddhist cultivator, perhaps a Dharma Master, made a move. He received a sword strike from True Monarch Taiyue and fled in disgrace."

After hearing this, and seeing Yuan Su in such a talkative, relaxed mood, Li Xuanfeng quietly asked, "True Monarch Taiyue is that powerful?"

"Hmm?" Yuan Su laughed and replied softly, "There's no comparison. The Immortal and Demon Daos have produced multiple Dao Embryos. In the Primordial Era, Dao Embryos led the battles. The Buddhist cultivators only have a few Revered Ones, and though they've claimed the North and remain untouchable in their sacred lands, if they step outside to provoke others, the outcome becomes uncertain.

"Besides..." He paused, quietly gazing at the black void in the distant sky, then answered, "In the end, this is a private matter between the Green Pine Dao lineage and the Immortal Mansion‚Äôs decree. Though the lineage has now scattered, they once worked together. Only Dragon Monarch Xiyang came because of an old karmic tie. How could Buddhist cultivators have any right to meddle?"

After he said this, Li Xuanfeng noticed that in just the time it took for one incense stick to burn, the waterline on the reef had already risen by two inches. Yuan Su smiled and said, "The waters of the Four Seas fell into the Earth Abyss and then rose again. With holes torn open in the sky canopy, seawater began falling early. Those celestial voids continue to pour water down, filling the Northern Sea.

"At present, the surface of the Northern Sea is still rising, while the other three seas are gradually receding."

Li Xuanfeng squinted as he listened. Though he had time and again magnified his understanding of Golden Core Realm‚Äôs power, he was still shaken by the might of the True Monarchs. In a hoarse voice, he said, "They can truly change heaven and earth."

Yuan Su seemed in high spirits, smiling as he said:, "Don't underestimate it. In several great wars between immortals and demonic creatures, the mainland was reduced to barely one-tenth of its former self and more than half of the outer seas vanished. How vast heaven and earth once were!"

Yuan Su paused for a moment, then said quietly, "I am about to enter final repose. Pu Yu saw it long ago, but couldn't bring himself to say it directly in front of me, so he made excuses... Judging by the time, it should be soon.

"Li Xuanfeng, I didn‚Äôt bring much this time. I only intended to slap Situ Huo a few times, so I brought the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal."

He removed a small, pale gold seal from his waist and placed it into Li Xuanfeng's frozen left hand. He said with a smile, "This seal was gifted to me by Li Jiangqun. Chi Wei was jealous for quite a while. Back then, the few of us were carefree. Chi Wei would say anything. He claimed the seal had good flair, drew plenty of attention and that it was his favorite."

Li Xuanfeng saw tears fall from him, dripping onto the reef with a crisp tick-tick sound. Ning Tiaoxiao continued, "Thinking back on it, Xiao Xianyou, Zhang Qiushui, Chi Wei, Zipei... they were all drawn into the game. At first, we thought it was camaraderie. But in the end, it was the Golden Cores scheming. Only in this way could it all happen without a trace. But one must not hate."

A faint sound of a flute came from Yuan Su, echoing gently through the air. He leaned close to Li Xuanfeng and whispered in his ear, "You must not hate, Li Xuanfeng."

After saying this, Yuan Su slowly lowered his eyelids and closed his eyes as if drifting into slumber.

Li Xuanfeng lowered his gaze, looking at the hem of Yuan Su‚Äôs robe. The flute music in the sky grew louder and louder. Before him, Yuan Su transformed into a pool of clear water and vanished. Beneath the reef, the waters of the Northern Sea let out a mournful wail and the ground underfoot rumbled violently.

The entire reef began to rise rapidly. The place where Yuan Su had entered repose sank inward, becoming a pitch-black pit. After a dozen breaths, a burst of bluish-green spring water surged forth.

The spring gushed high into the air, then poured back down like rain. Mist filled the air, spreading with the sea breeze, until a bluish-green fog blanketed a hundred-mile radius.

Li Xuanfeng removed his armor and stored it in his storage pouch. He raised his brows and looked upward, seeing five or six figures gathered in the sky. They were men and women, young and old. All of them stood upon radiant divine lights, each of a different hue.

He vaguely recognized Xiao Chuting and Daoist Master Pu Yu, both bowing their heads solemnly. Another person had a mature face, stiff and unreadable, but wore the uniform of the Azure Pond Sect.

The remaining two were female cultivators. One dressed in golden robes with a veiled hat, her face obscured by flowing white silk. The other wore purple robes and tilted her head slightly, lost in thought.

Clutching the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal, he knelt quietly before the spring with head bowed. The figures in the sky remained silent. Li Xuanfeng waited, his heart cold as he thought, Half of Daoist Master Yuan Su‚Äôs legendary reputation rested on this little seal. It‚Äôs anything but ordinary. I wonder how many among those in the sky harbor greedy intentions.
