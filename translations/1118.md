# Chapter 1118: The West

"This is a critical matter."

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly.

"The number of disciples on the lake has grown over the years. With Mount Qingdu managing them, things won't be too bad. The only fear is that they aren't close. As long as the Old Master is here, the four branches will always have a measure of harmony and tolerance..."

Hearing this, Li Ximing grew melancholic. Standing in the pavilion, he lowered his gaze and said,

"Although I've cultivated to the Purple Mansion Realm, my descendants are few. On the lake, far more people fear me than feel close to me. Grandfather can persuade and smooth over any matter, but none of it ever reaches my ears. If something truly happens to the old man..."

This was the unbridgeable chasm between a cultivator with a divine ability and a mortal. To a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, even a noble Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was merely an ant that could be extinguished with a single breath. No matter how much Li Ximing cared for the clan, it was difficult to genuinely invest himself in the teeming masses of juniors. Even when one of them successfully refined Qi or reached the Foundation Establishment Realm and was presented to him, he would, at most, offer a word of casual praise.

Even his own grandson, Li Zhouming, who was also a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, had pitifully few opportunities to meet with him. But Li Xuanxuan was different; he held them in his heart and doted on them. Every time someone achieved a breakthrough, he would summon them, look them over, and speak heartfelt, intimate words. This was something Li Ximing was utterly incapable of doing.

The Daoist Master stood with his hands clasped behind him for a moment before speaking with genuine conviction.

"The Li family stands strong today because of the Old Master's countless contributions, which no one can replicate! I am thinking... if it truly comes to that, I would not hesitate to use this pill in my hand, even if it only saves Grandfather for three to five years!"

The pill he spoke of was the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill, entrusted to him by Tinglan years ago. It was exceptionally precious, formed from the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness, and possessed the miraculous efficacy of reviving the dead and regenerating flesh on bare bones. Taking it could also extend one's lifespan.

Logically, even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would covet such a pill. A few years of life for a Purple Mansion Realm expert could change many things; it absolutely should not be wasted on someone merely at the Qi Refining level. Li Zhouwei, however, was not surprised.

"Curing injuries is nothing special," he said. "The Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill is precious because it elevates one's immortal foundation. Our family's cultivation arts are complete and our Dao Lineage is precious, with no unorthodox or flawed methods. Therefore, this is its only remaining use. It is fitting to retrieve it."

Li Ximing understood he was being comforted. He merely nodded silently and replied,

"First, we will try the usual life-extending remedies. I will go find that 'Horn Wood' elder, Daoist Master Shanbai. I'll invite him to the lake to draft a conditioning formula first."

Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement.

"It is inconvenient for Daoist Master Xiang Chun to come to the mainland. It would be better to arrange this at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. I must ask Grand-uncle to find a reason to invite the Old Master out to the Eastern Sea. Take the pill there, and ask both of them to examine it and jointly create the formula."

This was an undeniably impressive lineup of experts. Li Ximing finally relaxed. 

"That's simple enough. The old man has never been to the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. Although he doesn't say so, with Li Wen and An Siwei both there, he still worries about them. We'll just say we are taking him for a visit."

The two finalized the plan, both feeling a sense of sorrow. Li Xuanxuan's cultivation was too low; his body lacked the foundation to withstand many remedies. Even if his life was extended, it wouldn't be for long. At the Qi Refining stage, even the method involving Daoist Master Xuanyi's artifact spirit was impossible... And even if it were possible, they still had to consider the Talisman Seed within the old man's body.

They fell silent for a moment. Li Ximing quickly changed the subject, recounting the events at Mount Qusi.

"A major event occurred while you were in seclusion. The Western Shu suffered a heavy loss on the Great Western Plateau. Even figures like Qing Jifang were injured... and a Daoist Master has fallen. When it rains, it pours... Qize has also become unstable."

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei asked with interest. He listened as Li Ximing continued with a hint of schadenfreude.

"In Qize, there is a Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal... Do you remember him?"

Seeing the golden-eyed youth nod, Li Ximing smiled.

"This Sword Immortal is at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm and has been stuck at the threshold of the Purple Mystery for a long time. It seems he has finally made progress. Once he breaks through, he will be a figure capable of influencing the entire world... The Qing clan has always been careful to stay on his good side..."

"But who knows what trouble they stirred up. The Shu State has been plagued by disturbances. In a place called Xunyang Pool, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator appeared, claiming his surname was Xu. Wielding Sword Intent, he announced he was there for revenge. He stirred up roiling golden qi in the sky and took the head of the local County Governor... It was a blatant provocation against the Qing clan's authority. A Purple Mansion Realm expert from the Shangguan family rushed to the scene and they fought for hours, only to suddenly disengage. It was only later we learned that it was the cultivator backing the Xu-surnamed expert who intervened..."

"The incident caused a huge sensation but ultimately fizzled out. However, rumors are spreading everywhere that the one who intervened was the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal."

Li Zhouwei frowned as Li Ximing sighed.

"The Shu lands are famous for their sword cultivators; their Sword Immortals were once the greatest of all provinces. They have fallen into decline in recent years, leaving only the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal. It's not surprising that another has now appeared."

Li Zhouwei, however, suddenly recalled the Sword Immortal he had briefly glimpsed within the grotto-heaven.

'He wore the attire of the Shu lands,' he mused, 'and possessed the Metal Virtue. It might very well be him.'

Li Ximing seemed hesitant.

"I paid close attention to this news, particularly the name... Xunyang Pool."

This made Li Zhouwei raise his eyebrows. He listened as Li Ximing continued,

"I heard Daoist Master Guansue fell at Xunyang Pool... and back then, Daoist Master Donghua's Immortal Sword was also lost there. Now, two Sword Immortals have clashed in that very place. Could these events be related?"

Li Zhouwei understood at once. Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun, was strongly suspected of being a figure from the heavens. Naturally, Li Ximing would scrutinize any information related to him. He pondered for a moment before replying,

"It is an excellent thing that the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal cannot be used by the Qing clan. Otherwise, the price of attacking Shu in the future would increase tenfold... As for Xunyang Pool... we will have to attack Shu sooner or later. I should go there personally."

Li Ximing nodded discreetly, then said,

"This is just news for now... During the days of your seclusion, I have not been idle. Using the pretext of the Heavenly Nurture Urn, I've gathered a great deal of information and found a suitable sacrifice for the Azure Talisman!"

"While the situation between the north and south is temporarily stable, we must arrange this. I fear that once the wars begin again, this will be endlessly delayed."

This piqued Li Zhouwei's interest. He raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"That couldn't have been easy to find!"

Li Ximing shook his head helplessly.

"The first place I considered was the Southern Borderlands."

"That Bifeng Mountain Lord has a natural enmity with our family, making him an excellent target. He even has an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Demon King under his command... The problem is, the Bifeng Mountain Lord never leaves the Southern Borderlands, and his Demon King doesn't stray far either. If we try to suppress him in the Southern Borderlands, it will inevitably draw out Can Lufu."

"If we were extremely lucky and one of them happened to leave the Southern Borderlands, we could capture him in the Eastern Sea. That would solve the Azure Talisman's needs. But it would also alert the Bifeng Mountain Lord, making any future plots against him incredibly difficult."

He said grimly, "Relying on luck is never a sound strategy. Perhaps we could lure him out, but I've placed the Bifeng line as the last resort... It would be best to resolve this elsewhere."

"Furthermore, most Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the world have both power and backing. I've asked around carefully, and it's a thorny issue. We can forget about the ones controlled by the Dragon-kin, and there's no need to even consider the Northern Sea. The only places we might be able to make a move are the Southern Borderlands, Poluoduo, and the Western Sea."

A trace of melancholy crossed the Daoist Master's face.

"There's another problem. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are not minor figures. Even if they lack a powerful background or overwhelming strength, they always have a friend or two, or are backed by some power... They are not people one can simply attack at will."

Li Zhouwei frowned as Li Ximing continued.

"For example, there is a white elephant in the Southern Sea that cultivates Baleful Qi. Few pay him any mind, but his ancestors had connections to the Buddhist cultivators. The Mahas of the Southern Sea all know of him, and he has several friends of his own. If we were to travel all that way to kill him for no reason, it would be impossible to justify, emotionally or rationally. Someone would certainly intervene, and it might even destroy our reputation."

"Poluoduo is the same."

"In other words, while these Purple Mansion Realm experts may lack a formal background, their network and their divine abilities _are_ their background. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator relies on their personal divine ability; they are anything but ordinary. Even a Golden Core-level power wouldn't casually kill one without a major conflict of interest."

"Furthermore, if the target were to escape, any friends or family they have... would only lead to more trouble."

His words sent Li Zhouwei into deep thought. He finally replied, "What about a Merciful One?"

Li Ximing nodded at once.

"I had the same thought. A Purple Mansion Realm expert is hard to find, but a Merciful One is easier. The one we are most familiar with is at the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour. We already have an enmity with them, so killing two of their peacocks in our own interest would be perfectly reasonable..."

But he gave a bitter smile.

"Unfortunately, something strange happened. The Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour lost two peacocks in succession a few years ago. Both died unnatural deaths, and the cause couldn't even be investigated. It nearly left the temple's master completely alone, which made the Way of Great Desire extremely dissatisfied. It will be very difficult to make a move on the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour now."

Li Ximing lowered his voice.

"I asked Sima Yuanli. After careful thought, he said there is a demon beast temple in the Western Sea that we could try. But it presents its own set of problems... namely, we would be offending people."

"I tested the waters. If we decide to go to the Western Sea, Guo Nanwu can be persuaded by calling in a favor. But people like Sima Yuanli are unwilling to go. They have no grievance or enmity with that power, and they won't proactively offend them just because we need to refine a Spiritual Artifact... They might even see us as greedy and reckless, and offer words of caution."

Li Zhouwei was about to speak, but Li Ximing quickly continued,

"There is one other method: relying on the conflict between the north and south. The problem is, not many Buddhist cultivators have mounts, and even fewer are willing to bring them south. I had Guo Nanwu make a trip to Yinzhou Island and entrust the Daoist Master there to ask around. The Way of Great Desire has a newly promoted Maha named Bashan. Due to his promotion, his mount has also become a Merciful One. It could be a target."

This made Li Zhouwei's eyes light up. He silently calculated the pros and cons for a long time before speaking.

"In terms of convenience, using the North-South conflict is both reasonable and justifiable. But we would have to wait for some time, and there's no guarantee we could even capture that Merciful One..."

"Since Jiangqian and Que'wan's seclusions are close together, let's use the next few years to take care of that demon beast in the Western Sea. We'll secure one sacrifice first. Then, when the north and south begin to fight, we will try our best to capture the other one as well. It will be useful eventually."

"If these two matters are handled properly, our family won't need another Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast for a while. The only one remaining is Jiangchun... His spell art is difficult, and we haven't secured the secret method for him yet. We can afford to wait a bit on his account."

They exchanged a look, and Li Ximing understood Li Zhouwei's meaning.

'Our family has the Talisman Seed to aid them and break through their ignorance. They don't need to wait all those years. This means the breakthrough time for both children is tied directly to their personal Dao-Profundity and the difficulty of their cultivation arts. Que'wan's cultivation art is much more difficult, but given her Dao-Profundity, she won't be that much slower... We truly must consider them together.'

Li Ximing nodded.

Li Zhouwei mused, "We must try to handle this cleanly and not alert the target. As it happens, there is the matter of the Wall-Sinking Water. I'll have to trouble Grand-uncle to make a trip to the Western Sea to deal with it. You can inquire about the local situation at the same time. It's two birds with one stone."

"This junior recalls that the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron has the 'Renew' ability, which we have never had a use for. The Water Mansion is in the west, and Pit Water is in the north. Grand-uncle can use this as a pretext for the visit, which might also earn us some local favors. You can say you are refining a spiritual water... If it succeeds, it will be another boon."

Li Zhouwei, having settled the matter, began to ponder.

"As for Sima Yuanli... whether he joins the fight is irrelevant, as long as he is willing to lend us that Spiritual Treasure."

Li Ximing smiled.

"He treasures that thing! He doesn't even dare show it in my presence!"

Hearing this joke, a faint smile touched the golden-eyed King Wei's expression. 

"No matter. I will ask him personally."

...

The rain and snow began to subside.

Inside the cave-dwelling, a green lamp flickered. Scrolls large and small were piled high on the stone platform and the floor. A youth in white robes stood among them, his brows tightly knit in thought.

'If I had known...' he thought, 'I would have memorized a few more spell arts...'

Compared to his first life, Li Suining's second life had not lasted long, and events had developed with shocking suddenness. It was nothing like the first life's long wandering to the Southern Borderlands... but that didn't mean Moongaze Lake was at peace.

'Constructing the Mystic Realm... it consumes a vast amount of resources...'

In his previous life, Li Zhouwei had given him the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence and the method for constructing the Mystic Realm. Li Suining had been stunned when he read it, treating it as a supreme treasure that could bring about great change. But the spiritual materials required to build the Great Void's Profound Foundation were simply astronomical.

'This grotto-heaven method nearly exhausted the energy and resources of three generations. The sheer variety of ratios and the rate of consumption... even if we poured in everything left over from the Changxiao Gate, it wouldn't be nearly enough... And to make matters worse, Chengyun surrendered, so we can't plunder it...'

What he had to do now was write down every detail of his experience from his past life regarding the construction of this mystic realm, to prepare for what was to come.

'The Profound Foundation's formation structure and the ratios of spiritual materials are incredibly complex, with several thousand types that must be matched. Fortunately, as a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, I can recall them all one by one, and I can deduce the rest by visualizing the materials. That's the secondary part. The most important thing is the Great Void's anchor points that Aunt Que'wan spent two years calculating!'

He was writing silently when he heard a sound at the cave-dwelling's entrance.

"Knock, knock..."

Li Suining frowned and looked up, only to see a young man in black robes walking slowly inside. Startled, Li Suining shot to his feet and bowed deeply.

"Greetings, Your Majesty!"

In truth, seeing King Wei at this moment, Li Suining's heart filled with a profound sorrow, and even more, the shame of having betrayed his trust. He shut his eyes tightly, his voice catching in his throat.

Li Zhouwei simply sat down at a nearby desk, his gaze sweeping over the scrolls piled everywhere. He didn't ask about them, only smiled.

"You've been in seclusion for quite a while. The Old Master has been asking about you."

Li Suining felt a pang of guilt and hurriedly bowed again.

"I... I lost track of time. Fortunately, the gains were not small!"

King Wei smiled, still not asking about his work. He stood with his hands behind his back, raised an eyebrow, and said,

"This King and Daoist Master Zhaojing have a plan in the Western Sea... but we are concerned about a potential ambush, which gives us pause. I came here specifically to ask your opinion."
