# Chapter 871: Breaking The Formation

"Oh?"

Yu Jiang’s face was completely different from when he had faced the Li Family just now. His skin was light brown, typical of a Southern Sea cultivator. He already knew what Xuwang was plotting, so he sat down, one hand resting limply on the armrest, and said casually, "Grievances are grievances, but there’s no reason to expect something for nothing."

The situation in Anhuai Heaven was uncertain. The various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Mahas might emerge at any time. Master Monk Xuwang was all smiles on the surface, but inwardly he was extremely anxious, If those few come out right now, everything in front of me will fall back into the game of high cultivators. That would be troublesome! I absolutely cannot delay any longer... If this person doesn’t have any excessive demands, then I’ll agree to them...

Xuwang’s current actions could be seen as testing his superiors’ intentions, but they might also be interpreted as acting on his own authority. He had been stuck at Master Monk for over a hundred years, and only needed one opportunity. Once he took Mount Bianyan, not only would his breakthrough be within reach, but he’d also obtain great merit... at that time, it would be all benefits and no losses.

But if he failed to take the mountain, or if someone from Anhuai Heaven came out halfway, then he’d be roasted alive. The competition for the northern seat was already fierce. No matter what attitude the Azure Pond Sect’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivators held, the various Merciful Ones would rather watch him fall than offer a helping hand. They certainly wouldn’t protect an ambitious junior hoping to carve a share for himself.

Only by standing out and catching Maha’s eye can I claim the position of the Merciful One... then who would dare not smile when they see me?

He was much stronger than his fellow disciples, and he had already calculated everything in his mind, A Li Xuanfeng, powered by the Huai River Map, is not someone any one person can defeat. If it weren’t for a group of cultivators surrounding him, who could possibly take his life? Even if Tuoba Chongyuan were reborn, he’d have to die a few more times!

But if it’s a group attack, how much merit will I even get out of it? That’s no fun!

His ambition was boundless. Since heading south was no longer possible, and he didn’t want to fight for Li Xuanfeng’s life, taking Mount Bianyan was important for his own survival.

He said at once, "Time is pressing. Fellow Daoist, if you have any requests, just state them."

Yu Jiang smoothed out his expression and replied, "I have a way to break Mount Bianyan. I only need one blossom of Lesser Yang Fire."

As soon as the name of this item was spoken, the eyebrows of the man in the python robe sitting nearby slowly rose. Xuwang, of course, recognized the item, and quickly whispered to him, "Quite a bit of this Lesser Yang-type item was acquired when Great Zhao broke Liang. The imperial line is weak, and the attendant over there should have seen it. Please lend a hand..."

He spoke softly, with all the polite words he could muster. The python-robed man finally spoke, his voice sharp and thin, "Once the item is given, it’s considered the Daoist Master’s will. Fellow Daoist Xuwang, you’d better understand the Dao you must walk from now on!"

Faced with the pressing situation, Xuwang could only nod and agree, taking out a stone vial and handing it to Yu Jiang. The others also understood that this was something that had to be done decisively or not at all, so they said nothing more and quickly flew off together.

They were only a few hundred kilometers from Mount Bianyan. Once they passed through the billowing demonic smoke, they arrived at the front of the formation, where countless Buddhist and devil cultivators had already surrounded the formation and were attacking it with all their might.

The grand formation glowed pale green, concealing the scenery within, yet it was incredibly solid and reliable. Despite the cultivators besieging it for so long, it still shone brightly, as unwavering as a pristine green lotus amidst the surging demonic abyss.

A circle of cultivators had already formed around the formation’s perimeter, with even more cultivators who had failed to head south gathering here. The three of them all turned to Yu Jiang.

Xuwang’s heart leapt into his throat as he whispered, "From here on, it all depends on your skill, fellow Daoist."

"Give me the jade talisman!" Yu Jiang demanded, and the monk hurriedly handed over a jade talisman. It was indeed the talisman for entering and exiting the formation before them; it had been taken from a certain immortal cultivator. But this formation was so sophisticated that it required every talisman to be officially recorded for entry, so it was of little use.

Yu Jiang took the jade talisman, unhurriedly using his hand as a blade to lightly slice his chest open. He reached inside and groped around twice, then carefully took out several talismanic implements one by one.

These talismanic implements came in various shapes, but they were all smooth and bright. He selected three long plates of beast fangs from them, placing one in front of him first.

"Respectfully welcoming Supreme Shaman Thirty-Nine."

Then he placed one on each side and recited, "Respectfully inviting Jade True Sixty-Nine.

"Praying to Merging Owl Nineteen."

The three fang plates glowed together. He then took a white talisman from his sleeve, pressed it between his palms, and, with the tiger’s mouth facing his lips, exhaled twice, murmuring, "Sacrificial Talisman Whole Pill, combining ancient methods, transformations beyond measure... There is one here, grant me an arrow, lost first then returned, a temporary borrowing, they come to me and I to them, I also borrow..."

His words were vague, interspersed with many incantations that the others could not clearly hear. Strange sounds of bones cracking emanated from his body. His eyebrows grew longer and sharper, and his eyes turned a pale gray. A dignified, commanding aura radiated from between his brows, sweeping over the few people nearby.

"Li Xuanfeng!"

One look nearly scared Xuwang out of his wits; he hurriedly stepped back a pace. The man in the python robe even pulled out a long whip. Xuwang exclaimed in shock, "Fellow Daoist, what a skillful art of transformation! Th-this..."

Yu Jiang’s appearance as Li Xuanfeng was not just a mask, even his aura was exactly the same. When they probed him with spiritual sense, no matter how they looked, he seemed to be Li Xuanfeng himself! If not for the absence of his signature Astral Qi, they might have truly thought Li Xuanfeng was present!

Xuwang clapped his hands together at once, a sudden realization dawning on him. He sighed and said, "I was wondering why fellow Daoist insisted on seeing Li Xuanfeng that time! So it was to use the Southern Sea cultivator’s appearance to get close to him, just to perform this spell at this very moment... Fellow Daoist planned this all along... and fooled us all so thoroughly!

"Fellow Daoist, so perceptive!"

Yu Jiang nodded, outwardly displaying a look of praise, though he thought, If I truly needed his appearance, I wouldn’t need to rely on anything. It’s just to dispel suspicion...

He coldly glanced at all three of them. When they couldn’t help but avert their gazes, he finally picked up the jade talisman, rose on the wind, and said softly, "I will enter the formation. I will open the formation gate before Chi Zhiyan can react. All of you, stay sharp! Do not miss this opportunity!"

His transformed face gave his words an added air of authority. The others felt uneasy in their hearts but nodded in response.

Yu Jiang entered the formation. After just three breaths, the green-lotus-like formation began to flash, its light flickering on and off, revealing several openings.

A roar rang out from within, "Who?!"

"Kill!" The voices of demon cultivators instantly shook the heavens, and countless black clouds poured through the portals. Xuwang laughed heartily, shouting, "My opportunity to attain the Dao has come!"

***

The green lotus in Jiangbei gradually dimmed, while the radiant light in Jiangnan grew ever more brilliant. The sky was already shrouded in all sorts of Buddhist light, and the sharp energies of spears, staffs, knives, and swords interwove. Lake water poured from a bottle, surging and roaring in the sky.

All the Master Monks had appeared together, yet Li Xuanfeng remained as cold and hard as iron. He seized the Master Monk’s crescent shovel with one hand. Bright light shone, and wrapped around his body. But his other hand pierced straight through, and exploded the Master Monk’s head with a loud boom.

Splash!

The blood of the burly Master Monk transformed into countless drifting, fragrant lotus flowers. His headless body was now covered in cracks. The Master Monk abandoned even his dharma artifact, hurriedly flying downward, grateful that Li Xuanfeng had used his fist instead of his arrows.

The two small Master Monks used as bait had both lost the bodies they had cultivated for a hundred years and fled in panic. The fourteen Master Monks in the sky, who had specifically targeted him, finally took the opportunity to step forward.

Their faces were filled with rage as they bellowed, "Bold demon, how dare you act so wildly?!"

Boom!

Countless dharma artifacts fell together, producing a deafening roar. Blades, spears, axes, and clubs all struck at once, bursting with a dazzling brilliance that made one’s eyes spin. The sharpness of metal intertwined with the colorful light of the Buddhist cultivators, but everything was blocked by a single golden bow.

"Ha..."

Li Xuanfeng’s figure sank, and his aura finally faltered. Blood appeared faintly at the corner of his mouth. The brilliant light under his feet soared as the Huai River Map’s mysteries operated, allowing him to break free from the encirclement of over a dozen people. He reappeared on another pass, the celestial bow in his hand gleaming sharply.

Clang!

A sword light suddenly leapt upward from below. Si Yuanli lifted his sword essence, but two Master Monks purposely separated from the group, each holding a bottle designed to absorb sharp energy, and tied him down.

These two bottles were unusually shaped; they were not for spraying out but for absorbing. Clearly they were specifically designed to counter sword cultivators like him. It only took them a second to swallow all his sword qi, producing a metallic grinding sound.

Pinewhite Full Essence Sword Art!

Si Yuanli’s azure sword flipped in his hand, weaving bits of ethereal sword brilliance. Although the two before him clearly targeted sword cultivators, he was no ordinary man. He fearlessly conjured countless drifting sword lights.

He encircled the two Golden Body Master Monks before him, his expression steady. His vast and mighty swordsmanship grew ever more fluid as he seized the opportunity to observe the entire riverbank’s situation.

There were many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from the north below. Li Qinghong, wielding thunder and lightning, was the most dazzling. Li Ximing held the Radiant Origin Pass, suppressing several opponents on his own. Li Xizhi’s spell arts were nimble, toying with groups of cultivators in the palm of his hand.

All of them displayed remarkable skill, which made Si Yuanli secretly startled, The Li Family of today already has the strength of the Xiao Family of the olden days. Li Ximing is comparable to Xiao Yuansi, and Li Qinghong is on par with Yuan Chengdun... As for Li Xizhi, he’s also in the sect, and his tactics and scheming surpass even Xiao Yuansi...

Having grown up around the internal struggles of a minor sect, he always viewed things from the perspective of factional disputes. Even now, that was his first reaction. The more he thought, the more astonished he became, and he mused silently, I don’t know if Buzi has fallen, but now that my family has taken this step, we’re bound to offend the Chi Family in the future. Since we’ve already taken this step, we must draw the Li Family in as an ally...

All the other cultivators had to deal with enemies, but only he had the chance to help Li Xuanfeng, so he observed more closely. Yet most of his attention remained focused on Li Xuanfeng.

"Brother Xuanfeng..."

The man in white-gold armor had rings of light spreading out behind him, pushing back the rushing water from the spirit bottles. The longbow in his hand was drawn to a full moon as it flickered with golden light.

On the other end, the Buddhist light seemed to dye the sky in colors. Twelve Master Monks of the Buddhist cultivation each took their seats, their voices buzzing in the air in unison, "Huixu Demon Subduing Grand Formation!"

A faint and ethereal bell rang out as deep golden patterns mingled with colorful brilliance in the air, forming a massive grand formation. Each Master Monk settled into their assigned positions, their dharma artifacts shining even more brightly as a terrifying amount of power coalesced.
