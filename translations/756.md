# Chapter 756: The Opening

"Shaohui."

Lu Jiangxian studied the Lesser Yin attendant he had manifested. Although the bird demon Fuyu's memories had been washed away, her core Dao lineage of Lesser Yin remained within the celestial attendant's new memory. Her celestial title and even her name were details she had supplied herself based on that inherent lineage, and they certainly sounded appropriate to the Lesser Yin path.

Only her tea-white robes set her apart from the original demon, looking far more dignified. The pipa in her hand was also a treasure, one that would rival any ancient spirit artifact in the outside world. Lu Jiangxian could create as many as he wished, purely according to his preference.

He looked at the celestial attendant, the second true living being within his Mirror. The stone sprites and celestial soldiers he had shaped previously possessed only basic instincts and acted only on orders. While they filled the celestial court and made it look bustling, they were really just extremely advanced puppets.

'The affair with Chi Buzi was a matter of putting out a fire, but I never expected to follow through with it this far. It may not be a bad thing. In the future, whether exploring ancient secrets or recruiting subordinates, I will need to manifest a background sufficiently convincing and impressive to support both the reception rites and the sacrificial arts.'

'Slowly filling this place... it might have greater uses in the future. And at least I won't have to endure the silence in the Mirror alone.'

Seeing the white-robed attendant bowing respectfully in the court, Lu Jiangxian said softly, "The Lesser Yin path has not yet returned to its station or opened its palace. A turn of fate and opportunity allowed you to return to your celestial station early. For now, report to Zhengao, receive your duties, and temporarily follow the orders of the Supreme Yin Palace."

Shaohui bowed deeply. Although the personage above her was not her direct superior, he was clearly among the foremost of the Palace Lords. She naturally obeyed with reverence, clutching her pipa as she withdrew.

She exited the grand hall, descending the white jade steps shrouded in ethereal mist. The immortal officials on both sides bowed their heads in greeting. Although Shaohui was a Lesser Yin attendant, many here were from the Supreme Yin Palace. She nodded, dismissing them, and proceeded by familiar paths to a high platform engraved with bright moon patterns.

The platform was beautiful and pristine, dusted with falling frost-like snow and encircled by flowing spirit water. Several imposing celestial soldiers guarded the banks. She stepped onto the path toward the platform and saw, just as expected, a handsome celestial general reading a book.

"Daoist Friend Zhengao!" Shaohui called out respectfully.

The handsome man looked up, slightly surprised, and replied, "Long time no see! Has the Daoist Friend returned from reincarnation? Congratulations, congratulations!"

Although Shaohui’s celestial rank was equal to his, she was, firstly, not his equal in the sharpness of her celestial sword or the power she wielded, and secondly, she was essentially a guest in another’s palace. She spoke graciously:

"It was not a return through cultivation, but an early arrival. My memories are unclear. It must be due to a shift in the Lesser Yin Wu-Gui path. My own Palace Lord has not returned to his station, so I know even less."

Zhengao nodded, his armor exuding an icy chill. "The Lesser Yin path has not recovered. It seems the Revered One wishes you to serve the Supreme Yin Palace for now."

"Your insight is like a torch. I am here to receive my orders." Shaohui's personality was not reserved, and she smiled brightly.

Zhengao consulted a scroll on his desk and nodded. "You are of the Lesser Yin station, after all. It would be awkward for you in the Supreme Yin Palace. I will not make things difficult. I will select a small tower for you at the edge of the heavens. Your duty will be to revise the Lesser Yin lineages and manage the nearby immortal officials."

Shaohui smiled gratefully and thanked him repeatedly.

"There aren't really any immortal officials nearby to manage," Zhengao clarified. "It's just a nominal position. There is only one minor deity who was promoted from below. You just need to hand off some work to him."

He paused, then added with a hint of exasperation, "The fellow is a silver-tongued chatterbox. Right now, he's sitting in the East Third Prefecture, agonizing over the cost of three branches and two leaves. You might as well retrieve him on your way. It will serve as an introduction."

Shaohui was quite satisfied with this. If she had been assigned actual Supreme Yin officials, their conflicting stations would have made managing them difficult. A promotion from the world below came with no such concerns. She accepted the token and thanked him again.

"Many thanks, Daoist Friend! In the past, I only heard of your great reputation, but I never knew you were so amicable."

Zhengao pulled a jade box from his desk and smiled. "Don't thank me yet. This box is full of Lesser Yin techniques and cultivation arts. They need you to revise them."

Shaohui readily agreed.

"Only one thing," Zhengao added. "The Heavenly Gate is not open, so you cannot come and go freely. If you travel to the outer heavens, you must return via my Supreme Yin Palace and receive clearance to enter."

She smiled. "The Lesser Yin Palace isn't even open, so I have no desire to wander about. Spending my days in a pavilion reading and writing, increasing my Daoist cultivation, rather than wasting time outside... this is exactly what I would have wished for."

Shaohui was nothing like the flighty Dangjiang. Having settled her affairs, she left the high platform to find him.

She descended to the designated area and, sure enough, saw a young man standing near an attendant, anxiously inquiring about something. When the attendant saw Shaohui descend, she immediately bowed in fearful reverence, not daring to make a sound.

Dangjiang, having reported his merit, had returned to ask about the price of the Moon Laurel Golden Branch. Seeing the attendant drop to the ground, quieter than the dead, he felt a jolt of alarm. He looked up and saw a celestial attendant in tea-white robes holding a pipa. Her features were still youthful, but judging by her garments, her status was extremely high.

Dangjiang instantly knew he had run into a major figure and hurried to bow with the attendant. "This lowly official pays his respects to the Celestial Lady!"

He was an absolute wreck. Bowing on the ground felt humiliating.

He had casually given away a celestial treasure, and while this was within Lu Jiangxian’s calculations, if the fellow wasn't taught a lesson, the first time would lead to a second. If he started grabbing random things to send down—items that were *not* Supreme Yin spirit matter—Lu Jiangxian wouldn't be able to manifest them!

Now, Dangjiang was penniless. He had carelessly gifted the spirit item, and the heavens did not offer credit. As soon as the attendant had reported back to the palace, someone had immediately come looking for him. Dangjiang hadn't even warmed the seat of his new post, and now he was facing dismissal. How could he remain calm?

In her mortal life, Shaohui had been a playful bird demon. Her memories were washed, but her personality remained. She immediately asked, "What is all the noise about? Let me hear it."

Dangjiang quickly recounted the entire affair.

Shaohui laughed. "The Moon Laurel Golden Branch? You really know how to pick them. There are only a few days in the entire year when the Supreme Yin and Lesser Yin treasures are at their most valuable, and you managed to pick one."

Dangjiang grew even more embarrassed.

Then Shaohui said, "Immortal Official Liu is away. From now on, I am your superior. I can't just watch you wringing your hands. Put it on my account for now. When you have the savings, you can pay me back."

Dangjiang froze, stunned, then overcome with gratitude. He kowtowed. "Thank you, my lady! Thank you! May I know my lady's esteemed name?"

Shaohui smiled. "I am not from your Supreme Yin Palace. I hold the Lesser Yin Wu-Gui station. My Daoist name is Shaohui."

Only then did he realize she was a figure on the same level as Zhengao. He scrambled to his feet, still miserable.

'That dog Chi Buzi... hurry up and kill some more Purple Mansion demons! I need a cut of that light! If this keeps up... how many cultivation manuals will I have to write to pay this debt?!'

Dangjiang fell silent, following obediently behind the celestial attendant in tea-white robes. Crushing anxiety and awe for his superior kept his mouth shut for once. His surroundings blurred, and in the next moment, he was dropped back into his own courtyard.

His heart still ached.

'I'm going to pester him in a few months! Definitely!'

...

Moongaze Lake.

White blossoms drifted down from Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The Daoist Master in white and gold robes sat at his table, dense white light flowing like water across the ground, brushing past several jade pillars and pulsing with halos of light.

Li Ximing cultivated quietly. More than half a year passed like flowing water. His cultivation had advanced slightly, and his divine ability had condensed further. His cultivation talent was, after all, quite good; his efforts were not wasted.

The heavenly light was bright, a perfect time for cultivation, yet he suddenly opened his eyes. He took one step forward, manifesting over Moongaze Lake and gazing toward the east.

Over Shanji Prefecture, an ink-like purple qi was gathering, staining the entire sky a gloomy shade. With his Purple Mansion-level sight, he could even see streaks of light rising rapidly at the horizon, speeding toward Moongaze Lake.

'Yehui has made his move.'

Sure enough, a streak of light shot up urgently from below. Li Jiangqian stopped before him, his expression grave. He bowed. "Reporting to the Daoist Master: Daoist Master Yehui has appeared at the Profound Peak mountain gate in Shanji Prefecture. He is suppressing the grand array with his divine ability. The entire eastern bank is in turmoil, and messengers have arrived from several territories."

Li Cheng arrived a step behind, riding lightning with several others, his expression equally heavy.

Compared to the anxiety and tension of the others at the lake, Li Ximing was perfectly calm. "Were the personnel inside the mountain gate evacuated long ago?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master: As ordered, they were all withdrawn six months ago. Only a few Profound Peak elders remained, refusing to leave."

Li Ximing had not shared the details of the Xuanmiao Temple affair with his family. Firstly, neither Li Minggong nor Li Chenghui possessed a Talisman Seed; hearing such secrets would only become a liability. Secondly, the matter didn't require much participation from his family cultivators. Some things were calculations left to the Purple Mansion realm, and Li Ximing felt it best to carry the burden alone. If something went wrong later, at least it wouldn't make things too difficult for the Li family.

The horizon was already pulsing with the deep purple brilliance of a divine ability. Li Ximing remained unhurried. The Hundred Mountains Concealed Storage Spirit Array of the Profound Peak Gate was not something Yehui could break in a moment, and the Profound Peak cultivators no longer had the ability to open it anyway.

He only asked, "What of Profound Peak's spiritual resources and supplies?"

Li Jiangqian answered respectfully, "Over the past half-year, Kong Guxi moved three mountains' worth of assets to the wilderness. He only stopped when the earth meridians in that part of the wilderness could no longer bear any more relocation. Most of the treasury has been moved, and the entire inheritance of techniques was transferred. Most of what could be moved was moved. The majority of low-grade supplies required the grand array to remain sealed, and the wilderness is ill-equipped, so they were not moved."

"Good."

Li Ximing understood. The Li family did not lack those spirit grains and herbs. Leaving them at Profound Peak also aligned with the story about the spirit items. As for the losses from the rest of the treasury, they were acceptable. He gave the order:

"Withdraw all personnel from Shanji Prefecture."

The moment the words fell, his figure vanished from the lake. He crossed the Great Void, instantly manifesting over Shanji Prefecture.

Black-purple qi roiled across the prefecture, shrouding the entire region in darkness. Below, Capital immortals Dao disciples surrounded the mountain base. The mountain range, the life's work of Daoist Master Changxi, was protected by a pale-yellow shield of light. The shield brightened, only to be immediately suppressed by the overwhelming dark purple divine ability.

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

Pressed down upon the Profound Peak gate was another, separate mountain peak condensed of pure white qi, soaring into the clouds. It presented a majestic, magnificent posture amidst the swirling darkness. A few fleeing Profound Peak disciples scrambled like ants through the black qi.

He stepped forward, appearing closer. Half the sky above the mountain gate abruptly brightened as radiant clouds surged, pushing back the black qi, drawing a clear line between them. Those disciples, as if seeing a life-saving rope, fled into the heavenly light.

The Capital immortals Dao cultivators behind them, who had been toying with them like cats with mice, immediately wiped the sneers from their faces, turned, and fled. The few who had been leading the chase respectfully called out "Daoist Master" before bowing and retreating.

Li Ximing didn't spare them a glance. He stood alone, facing the behemoth manifestation of the Eastern Feather Mountain and the assembled Capital immortals Dao cultivators in the sky, yet his aura lost nothing. Heavenly light illuminated the sky, claiming half of it.

No matter how many Capital immortals Dao cultivators were present, at this moment, the field belonged only to Yehui and Li Ximing. As disciples of famous sects, how could they not understand this? Every one of them was silent as cicadas in winter, not daring to speak.

Li Ximing looked at Yehui, who stood atop his divine ability, the Eastern Feather Mountain. The Bright Yang Purple Flames rose gently behind him.

"Senior Changxi has only just fallen, and already Daoist Friend rushes to swallow Profound Peak. This is overly hasty. Have you asked Senior Sumian about this?"

From above, Yehui laughed. "Daoist Friend misunderstands. I am acquainted with a demonic disciple hidden in these mountains and have come only to eliminate the threat. If I bore any ill will toward the Profound Peak lineage, would it not be easier to go directly to the wilderness? I am not here for the mountain gate. Once the search is complete, I will naturally withdraw."

'A fine excuse...'

Li Ximing knew exactly what was happening, but he hadn't expected Yehui to turn the plot back on him, assuming such a mask of righteousness. He sighed.

"Daoist Friend is merely here to eliminate a future threat. There is no need for such accusations. I shall accept your challenge!"

"Please!"

Yehui's tone held little anger. The two spoke as calmly as friends catching up. The moment the word fell, both men vanished with their divine abilities, disappearing into the Great Void.

The vast purple qi and radiant clouds that had split the sky instantly vanished. The towering white mountain peak dissipated like smoke. A clear, bright sky returned, causing the trembling, terrified mortals of Shanji Prefecture to kowtow.

It had all happened too fast. All that remained was an empty sky, where only the Capital immortals Dao cultivators hovered on the wind. Their leader, clad in black Daoist robes with a silk belt and silver trim, was high-browed and deep-eyed: the Capital immortals Dao Head Disciple, Guan Gongxiao.

His eyelid twitched. He was clearly just as stunned as everyone else. He stood silently before the massive Purple Mansion array. The cultivators on either side looked to him. Guan Gongxiao knew what they were thinking. He, too, was staring blankly at the array.

'They left us? To attack a Purple Mansion Grand Array?'

Yehui and Li Ximing had blithely flown off into the Great Void to fight, apparently giving no thought to the fact that their disciples had come here to attack a mountain. What could a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators possibly do to a Purple Mansion Grand Array? No matter how weak the Profound Peak array was at offense, if it counter-attacked, few here would dare to receive the blow!

Guan Gongxiao could almost picture Li Zhouwei bursting from the array with a contingent of troops and slaughtering them. He nearly lost his composure but forced himself to state flatly:

"Maintain the perimeter and drain the array! The Daoist Master has a plan!"

He said this aloud, but Yehui always acted on whims. He had brought them here the moment he emerged from seclusion. Not only did Guan Gongxiao know nothing of the plan, but he also had no tools for breaking the array.

'How can one guess the thoughts of a Daoist Master... What is the point of us staying here? Aren't we just revealing our weakness? Surely this grand array isn't just going to unlock its seals and collapse on its own while they fight?'
