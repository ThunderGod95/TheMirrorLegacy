# Chapter 865: Flying Snow at the Purple Pavilion

A torrent of golden flame poured down, cascading over Chiluo’s golden body. The protective treasured light around him, already fractured by a blast of Bright Yang energy, had only a moment to flicker back to life before the scorching True Fire incinerated it completely. He let out a blood-curdling roar.

Li Ximing countered the descending pagoda with Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, but his own divine ability, Audience with the Celestial Gate, wavered violently from the blast of his opponent’s Treasured Artifact. He was forced to retract it, pulling the shimmering gate back to shield himself just as two more assailants closed in, ready to smash into the weakened ability.

At that critical moment, a disc reappeared in Li Ximing's palm—an artifact of brilliant gold, etched with runes of the eight directions.

The three-eyed Merciful One was the quickest to react. He instantly abandoned his Treasured Artifact and retreated, shielding himself with a wall of spiritual energy. The sword-wielding Merciful One, however, had no time to pull back. He could only brace himself and slam his full power into Li Ximing's divine ability, triggering an explosion of Profound Light.

Yet Li Ximing’s Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass remained dark, emitting no radiance at all. He was merely holding it. How could he possibly have the energy to power such a precious spiritual artifact?

'Damnation...'

The Merciful One's clumsy momentum, which had been his undoing, now ironically became his saving grace. His desperate, all-out gamble paid off. Audience with the Celestial Gate shattered into scattered Profound Light. Li Ximing’s vision swam, his divine ability dimming as his already frail state worsened. Fortunately, one of his opponents had managed to pull back. He fumbled at his waist, popping a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill into his mouth.

Though he hadn't suffered any major injuries, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass had drained his reserves. Compounding that with the forced use of a divine ability and the backlash from his enemy's final, desperate attack, his spiritual energy was in chaos, the Profound Light around him thin and weak.

But his opponent, Chiluo, was in no better shape. The Merciful Ones were relentless, and the successive impacts from the Bright Yang light, the Audience with the Celestial Gate, and the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual fire had taken their toll. More than half of the runes covering his body had been burned away, leaving his form a wretched patchwork of black and gold.

Seeing his two companions fail so spectacularly, Chiluo was so furious he could have laughed. If even one of them had a shred of experience, they wouldn't be in this mess. If he could trade these three for a single Five-Eyed Merciful One from the Golden Lotus Seat, Li Ximing would already be grievously wounded.

Chiluo had not underestimated Li Ximing from the start, but he had never anticipated the existence of the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. He had taken the last blow almost completely undefended. Even now, chaotic Profound Light ravaged him from within while True Fire licked across his skin. His eyes burned crimson as he bellowed, "You fools! Use your treasured light on him!"

Just as he'd suspected. After only a brief exchange, Chiluo had already identified the weakness of the Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption. At his command, the three-eyed Merciful One, Pingling, began to gather a white brilliance between his brows. The sword-wielding Merciful One surged forward, determined to give Li Ximing no time to recover.

Li Ximing cursed inwardly. He raised the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen, which was already showing signs of fatigue, and met the attack with the Sun's Resonant Parting Art. The advantage of a golden body became apparent at close range; his foe remained a potent threat, tying him down for the moment. Although Li Ximing’s spiritual energy was rapidly recovering, he couldn’t risk summoning a major divine ability to suppress him just yet.

As the white light on Pingling's forehead grew ever more intense, Li Ximing was forced to tear his gaze away and assess the wider battlefield.

Kui Qi had clearly played some kind of trump card. Black energy spewed from him, his face veiled in a gray mist, and he had fought Vija to a standstill. But he wouldn't be free to help anytime soon.

Chen Yin was faring much worse against Taixi. His Water Mansion divine ability seemed to be completely neutralized by the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl. If not for the threatening, razor-sharp chill of his sword keeping his opponent wary, he would likely be injured by now.

As for Daoist Master Luo, he was proving to be just as useless as Kui Qi had predicted. He was entangled with three Merciful Ones—and these three didn't even have a Golden Lotus Seat powerhouse like Chiluo leading them. Yet they fought him to a standstill. It was impossible to tell if he was simply incompetent or holding back his strength, but either way, he was accomplishing nothing.

His survey brought no good news. Worse, the eight-spoked dharma wheel hanging in midair began to flicker erratically before a golden body leaped out from its center.

This new figure was magnificent, a full size larger than Chiluo, and radiated a dazzling light. Its face was a mask of savagery, and it clutched two charred, broken clubs.

'What now?!'

Li Ximing was stunned. The three he was already facing had pushed him to his limit. If another one joined the fray, his life would be in genuine danger. He swept his spiritual sense over the newcomer and frowned, his feelings a mixture of relief and dread.

The new arrival, for all its ferocious appearance, was wreathed in flames and howling in agony. The fire coiled around its golden body in two distinct layers: one of deep azure, the other a vibrant blue.

The moment he saw those flames, Chiluo looked as if he might leap out of his skin. His face turned ugly. And if others could see it clearly, how could Li Ximing not? He had wielded that fire himself—it was Tinglan's Immeasurable Water and Fire!

His heart filled with both joy and worry. He was glad that Tinglan seemed to be holding her own inside the formation, but he was deeply concerned that this powerhouse of a Merciful One was now his problem.

The hulking creature’s face was ashen, but as it took in the battlefield, its eyes fell upon the man in white and gold. After a brief pause, it kicked off the air and transformed into a storm of golden sand, hurtling toward him.

'He knows a movement technique... completely different from Chiluo.'

A chill shot down Li Ximing’s spine. Ignoring the turmoil in his spiritual energy, he forced his power. Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light and his Purple Mansion Realm True Fire erupted forth as he re-manifested his divine ability, suppressing the churning in his core. The Bright Yang rose high, and he finally reseated himself within its light.

But before Audience with the Celestial Gate could fully stabilize, the treasured light from Pingling shot toward him. Pingling might not have been the strongest, but he had the keen eyes of a Merciful One. He had waited for the precise instant Li Ximing manifested his ability to strike.

This time, however, Li Ximing’s Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass was already glowing. The thick ring of white runes around its edge spun, separating into four distinct circles. As the outermost ring dimmed, he inverted the compass. Four points of golden light detached once more. Though dimmer than before, they formed an inverted celestial image: Heavenly Radiance above, the Yang Pole below.

The brilliant light in the sky instantly converged. Audience with the Celestial Gate dissolved into a shimmering, colorful haze. The sky flashed as four golden stars rose, dragging trails of light behind them. They drew in all the surrounding Profound Light, plunging the world into an artificial twilight.

The treasured light from Pingling’s third eye slammed into the four stars and was halted for a barest fraction of a second. The stars pulsed, as if taking a breath, and then detonated.

*Clang!*

A cascade of Profound Light, fluid as water, poured down. While it lacked the overwhelming force of the Bright Yang's destructive light, it carried a limpid, binding quality that swept across the field. It not only forced the hulking Merciful One out of his sand form but also brought all four of his attackers to a stunned halt.

Li Ximing flickered, reappearing a short distance away. Before he could even think of summoning Audience with the Celestial Gate again, he sensed a change. His gaze hardened as he stared at the space before him.

A single, small, eight-sided snowflake drifted down, spinning gently in the air.

He raised his eyes. Snow was falling across the entire mountain range, slowly blanketing the landscape in white. A wave of pure terror washed over him, his mind going blank for a second before realization flooded back.

'No pine scent! Thank goodness, no pine scent...'

Across Xiaoshi Mountain, every cultivator looked up, their faces etched with surprise. The eight-spoked dharma wheel in the sky, finally unable to bear the strain, emitted a series of sharp cracks. A bitter cold swept across Xiaoshi Mountain, carried on a howling wind.

The dharma wheel dimmed to its faintest point before erupting in a violent torrent of white snow. The deluge escalated at a terrifying rate, becoming an avalanche that formed a towering pillar of light and snow. A final, sorrowful cry echoed through the air.

*Crack!*

The radiant light of the formation was suppressed and scattered. From within the snow, a soaring killing intent, born from Cold Qi condensed to its absolute limit, surged forth. The sky filled with countless iridescent clouds, and a towering golden body manifested—a majestic Dharma Body covered in a dense pattern of innumerable eyes.

"Zhelu!"

The foremost master of the Way of Emptiness, a true Buddhist cultivator who had attained the rank of Maha and sat upon the Buddhist Land, had appeared. His presence was immense, his power overwhelming. He was clearly unharmed. As he manifested, an infinite rain of lotus blossoms fell around him, followed by the appearance of one Merciful One after another.

Beneath Zhelu's golden form, nestled in the falling snow, stood a small purple pavilion. Inside, a celestial maiden with a tight frown and blood at the corner of her lips held a sword pointed toward the sky.

The sword was pure white. It had a long blade and a short, square, unadorned hilt that was barely thicker than the blade itself. One side was etched with the emblem of Profound Snow and the Supreme Yin ascending the cosmos; the other depicted the scene of autumn yielding to winter, a harmony of heaven and earth. As its light pulsed, an indomitable killing intent soared into the heavens.

'A Purple Mansion Realm spirit sword!'

Seeing this, how could Li Ximing not guess the sword's origin?

'That's the Azure Pond Sect's legendary blade, Great Snow's Severing Edge! She must have used its power to shatter the formation from within!'

When Great Snow's Severing Edge first became famous, the Li family hadn't even settled at Moongaze Lake; his ancestors were still wandering who-knows-where. Back then, the sword had a different name, but it was already known as the Azure Pond Sect Master's ultimate treasure, one of the most renowned spirit swords in the world. Legend said that after the chaos at Moongaze Lake, it had gained some immense benefit, unlocking countless new wonders, and was thereafter known as Great Snow's Severing Edge.

By the time the Li family rose to prominence, the sword hadn't been seen for years, yet its legend persisted throughout the lands of Wu and Yue. Even common rogue cultivators knew its name.

This was the first time Li Ximing had ever seen the spirit sword. The sheer killing intent and spiritual snow radiating from it told him this was an incredible spiritual artifact, perhaps the finest he had ever witnessed. But he was no sword fanatic. Instead of getting lost in admiration, his eyes darted around at the growing number of Merciful Ones, some in good shape, others battered. He immediately turned his attention back to the immediate threat.

In the midst of the chaos, he saw Chiluo’s eyes light up with feverish greed. The Merciful One’s gaze swept the field and landed on a new golden body descending through the snow. This one had three eyes on its face and two more on its chest. Its numerous arms were arranged around its body like the petals of a lotus, and the light fortifying it was exceptionally potent. Its aura seemed even a fraction stronger than Chiluo's.

His eyes gleamed. He let out a great roar.

"Five-Eyes! Quickly, join me! We'll kill this remnant of the Wei-Li!"

The situation was now painfully clear. With the Wisdom-Void Demon-Subduing Grand Formation broken, and with Tinglan and her companion wielding the Immeasurable Water and Fire, the Buddhist cultivators wouldn't dare press them to the point of death and risk them unleashing the full power of their Supreme Yang heritage. Even in their weakened state, escaping would be easy for them.

For the Merciful Ones, the most valuable and most vulnerable target on the field was now, without a doubt, Li Ximing.

The newly arrived five-eyed Merciful One, his hands arranged like a wondrous lotus, had just set foot on the ground when he heard Chiluo’s cry. He looked up, stunned, his gaze falling on Li Ximing in the distance. He felt as if he’d been struck by lightning. His legs went weak.

'Oh, gods... it's him! The one from the Immortal Clan at Moongaze Lake!'

Ever since he’d been captured by that Immortal Lord, he, Five-Eyes, had been living the life of a rat. For centuries, he had done as he pleased on his own territory. But now? Now he couldn't even leave his temple! He was too scared to even collect rent from his tenants.

He was keenly aware of the sins his disciples had committed over the years and had started finding any excuse to execute them, leading everyone to believe he'd become unpredictable and cruel. He spent his nights tossing and turning, unable to find a moment's peace.

'Who? Li Ximing? He wants me to kill *Li Ximing*?! That animal! If he wants to get himself killed, fine, but he wants to drag me down with him?!'

He was beside himself with rage and panic, a storm of emotions churning within him. His face twisted into a mask of furious, bulging-eyed savagery. It was genuine, heartfelt rage, but Chiluo mistook it for a display of divine power. Thrilled to have found a kindred spirit, he cried out, "Excellent!"

Li Ximing had been watching the entire exchange. With the Merciful Ones just arriving and still disoriented, and with his own escape secured by the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, his first instinct was to flee into the Great Void.

These new arrivals were every bit as dangerous as Chiluo. If they surrounded him, he wouldn't just be injured; he could be targeted and finished off by Taixi and the others. But most of them were still afflicted by the Immeasurable Water and Fire. As long as that flame burned on their bodies, entering the Great Void would be suicide. They would never be able to follow him.

But the moment he slipped into the Great Void, before he even had a chance to recover, his vision filled with light.

A middle-aged man stood there, clad in Daoist robes, his hair and beard streaked with gray. He held a sword to his chest, his gaze as sharp as its edge. A black talisman was tied to his waist, shrouding him in a dark, cloying mist that made him nearly impossible to detect.

'Senior Lingmei!'

Li Ximing was overjoyed, but he saw at once that the kindness and courtesy the Daoist Master of the Sword Gate had shown him in the past were gone. His eyes were now filled with killing intent. He shook his head slowly at Li Ximing, one hand already gripping his sword's hilt, waiting.

Only an instant passed before a magnificent, multicolored light pursued Li Ximing into the void. It expanded dramatically, crossing the roiling expanse of the Great Void to reveal an enormous golden body. Its long, horse-like face and black, empty eyes were especially terrifying in this empty space.

It was Taixi... and judging by his speed, this had been planned all along.

The shimmering, golden-tinged light seemed to have eyes of its own as it descended directly upon Li Ximing, revealing within it a densely patterned, demon-subduing lotus.

The Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions!

From start to finish, Taixi had been playing his own game, his focus clearly fixed on Li Ximing all along. He had wanted him dead from the beginning. Now, with the battlefield in chaos, the Maha hadn't waited for the other Merciful Ones. He had lain in wait within the Great Void, his Treasured Artifact fully charged.

*Clang!*

At that exact moment, Lingmei, positioned behind Li Ximing, finally let out a cold sneer and flicked his wrist. A surge of golden energy and a lattice of cold light erupted. As if in response to the falling snow and the purple pavilion in the mortal world, a vast, stark-white tide of sword light flared to life in the Great Void.

The Sword Gate was the foremost offensive branch of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and Lingmei was the Sword Gate’s greatest swordsman. Though worldly affairs in his youth had prevented him from mastering sword intent, his skill with sword arts and divine abilities was second to none. He had been preparing this strike for who knows how long. Li Ximing's vision was consumed by white light as a crisp, clear, and melodious sword hum filled his ears.

*Omm...*
