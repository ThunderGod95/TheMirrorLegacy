# Chapter 789: The West Bank Blood Petition

Chen Yang’s face lit up with joy. "The Capital immortals Dao retreated overnight! They’ve vanished completely. The entire wilderness is empty. We weren't stopped until we reached Shanji Prefecture. It seems both Shanji and the Profound Peak mountain gate have been occupied by someone else."

"Kong Guxi and the others were overjoyed and returned to the wilderness. They left only two people behind to reorganize their forces. The rest followed Kong Guxi here to the lake to offer their congratulations and thanks. They are waiting outside the island."

"Excellent!" Li Zhouluo stood up, beaming.

Chen Yang bowed, equally full of smiles—the two actually bore a slight resemblance in that moment. Chen Yang presented a jade box. "Clan Head, both Dharma Artifacts are inside, returned to the clan as requested."

He offered the jade box first, then retrieved a dark, black pearl from his robes, reporting respectfully, "Clan Head, some days ago, demonic cultivators came to raid us. I, the Kong family members, and Lord Ding worked together to set an ambush. Although we were unlucky and the demonic cultivator escaped, we had an unexpected gain."

"This is the Dharma Artifact that cultivator used to cover his retreat. It was originally intended to self-detonate, but unexpectedly, Sect Master Kong summoned a spiritual mountain and barely managed to suppress it, allowing the artifact to survive..."

He knelt with profound respect, hands raised, presenting the black pearl in his palms. "This item is called a [Mishui Pearl]. It was forged from extremely pure Mishui Cold Iron. While the material itself isn't extraordinary, the refinement technique is brilliant. It is a Dharma Artifact of Cold Qi."

This was also exceptionally good news. Li Zhouluo nodded cheerfully. The Li Clan rules were strict; he could not immediately inspect a tribute item himself. He had Dili Guang take the pearl and examine it while he asked, "I often hear that these demonic cultivators travel in small groups. It’s surprising that Protector Ding acted and still let them escape. They must not be simple characters. Did you notice anything else?"

Chen Yang nodded repeatedly. "The Clan Head sees clearly. Protector Ding and I both attacked, only to find that while they were covered in demonic aura on the surface, their cultivation underneath was extremely pure. We fear they aren't rogue demonic cultivators, but rather practitioners from another Dao lineage in disguise. Fearing trouble, even though we had a chance to encircle and kill them, we only forced out this Dharma Artifact and let him go."

"These people are formidable. They weren't using their full strength in the previous raids, but we cannot identify their lineage. Protector Ding and I discussed it; they are most likely cultivators from overseas."

Li Zhouluo nodded slightly and glanced at Dili Guang. The Northen Yue youth replied, "Clan Head, this Dharma Artifact is indeed exceptionally pure. There are no traces of blood-qi refinement."

Only then did Li Zhouluo speak. "The clan will render a decision on this matter later, but your merit has been recorded. As for the Capital immortals Dao retreat, it must be the result of calculations among the Purple Mansion ancestors. They must have negotiated the handover of Shanji Prefecture... You have worked hard, Protector. Several elders wish to see you. For now, please send the Kong family members in."

Chen Yang bowed and retreated. Li Zhouluo waited a moment before Kong Guxi hurried in from outside the hall, hiking up his robes as he ran.

"Greetings, Clan Head!"

Kong Guxi’s eyebrows were arched high, his eyes shining brightly, and the wrinkles on his face had smoothed out. His aged face seemed a perfect barometer for Profound Peak Gate's fate, now radiating a bright, excited vigor. He knelt solidly on the floor, proclaiming respectfully, "The Capital immortals have withdrawn! Congratulations, Clan Head!"

Kong Guxi had no regard for saving face. Despite being a mighty late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, he dropped to his knees before Li Zhouluo without hesitation. This forced Kong Qiuyan, standing behind him, to kneel as well. Where previously this woman had always kept her head bowed and eyes nearly shut in the presence of the Li family, she now looked up, her gratitude unmistakable. Beside them, Fu Yuezi knelt like a stone statue, his eyes calm, as if this concerned him in no way whatsoever.

Li Zhouluo helped the sect master up, smiling. "This is a joyous occasion for you as well, Sect Master. All of Profound Peak Gate's former institutions in the wilderness will be returned to your control. The agreement between our two families remains in effect. The Lake will not occupy a single inch of Profound Peak Gate territory."

Kong Guxi agreed obsequiously, but the Li family clearly wanted nothing more to do with this mess. Li Zhouluo said gently, "Since the enemy has retreated and the wilderness is back in your hands, you cannot let the hearts of your people scatter any longer! The banner of Profound Peak Gate must be raised again as soon as possible... Sect Master, you should delineate your territories, recruit a new batch of disciples, and rebuild Profound Peak Gate immediately!"

Hearing this, Kong Qiuyan was stunned. There was no such thing as a free lunch in this world. They had received such an immense favor; she expected they would have to leave behind most of their Daoist texts and send away all their guest elders just to escape Moongaze's grasp. She thought freedom would come at an unimaginable price, yet here it was, laid out before them. She stared at Li Zhouluo, lost in confusion and shock.

Even Fu Yuezi moved for the first time; the face beneath the golden mask seemed to quirk into a smile.

Only Kong Guxi remained kneeling blankly, answering nothing.

To the other two, those words were heavenly news. But to Kong Guxi’s ears, they meant something entirely different.

'The agreement between your ancestor and our Daoist Master has been fulfilled. My family has done more than enough. Our Daoist Master is still missing; how can we spare the effort for you? We are handing the wilderness back. Rebuild your sect quickly. After this, Profound Peak Gate's affairs are yours alone!'

The fate of the Profound Peak Gate mountain gate was still unknown, and the Capital immortals Dao was still watching like a tiger. The Kong family had only Fu Yuezi, who excelled at combat. What could he possibly accomplish alone in the wilderness? Raising the sect banner now was undoubtedly an extremely dangerous proposition...

Looked at another way, Profound Peak Gate had nothing left for the Li family to exploit. Their mountain gate was gone. Their Purple Mansion spiritual artifacts and resources had been presented to the Li family. Their Purple Mansion Grand Array was lost. All that remained was the 'Fool's Mountain Chase' Dao lineage, a handful of Foundation Establishment treasure medicines, Dharma artifacts, and basic supplies—things the Li family probably wouldn't even want.

He could only bow and say, "The wilderness is currently in chaos and ruins. We must reorganize thoroughly before we can consider rebuilding the sect."

Although Li Zhouluo was also waiting for news from Shanji Prefecture, his attitude remained firm. "Sect Master, you needn't be so modest. My family has no intention of interfering with the Profound Peak Gate Dao lineage. The territory in the wilderness will be transferred to your sect. The resources stored on our mountain will also be returned by the Jade Court Guard, not one item missing. All subsequent arrangements are entirely up to your sect."

Kong Guxi’s expression was awkward and uneasy. Unable to remain stubborn, he said shamefully, "I ask only that the Clan Head grant us some time..."

Li Zhouluo nodded, lowering his voice. "Rest assured, Sect Master. Focus on cleaning up the wilderness. With the three great mountains moved from Shanji, Profound Peak Gate's foundation still remains."

Hearing this exchange, Kong Guxi estimated the Li family wasn't forcing him to establish the sect *immediately*, and he breathed a sigh of relief. Li Zhouluo didn't waste any more words, gave his instructions, and politely dismissed him. The other two, however, seemed to be in high spirits as they followed Kong Guxi out of the main hall.

Li Zhouluo ordered someone to investigate the situation in Shanji Prefecture. The Capital immortals Dao, a weight pressing on his mind, was gone, and the Profound Peak Gate clan, which had been stuck to his hands, was about to be sent away. His mood soared. "I heard Xinghan just returned from the west. I have good news for her. Hurry and send her in!"

Dili Guang left immediately. Before long, Li Xinghan entered the hall, travel-worn and carrying a sword on her back. She announced respectfully, "Greetings, Clan Head!"

"Sister, please rise!"

Li Xinghan had indeed just returned from the great desert. She had also heard the news of the Capital immortals Dao's retreat and was overjoyed. After congratulating Li Zhouluo, he looked at her and asked, "How are things in the desert?"

Li Xinghan knew her brother had likely already been briefed, but he wanted to hear it from her, who had participated personally. She sighed. "There are numerous demonic cultivators. Protector An mentioned that the desert never used to have so many; they've only increased in recent years. We expelled them, but that section of the city wall has completely collapsed. We can no longer harvest Qi there."

"What a pity." Many of the Li family’s Bright Yang cultivation arts relied on harvesting Qi from that ancient wall. With the Purple Mansion ancestor gone and the source now severed, it was a serious problem. "I also received reports," Li Zhouluo lamented, "that the desert outpost is separated from us by the Western Mountains, making it difficult to maintain. The family has always seen it as a hardship posting; the direct descendants all dislike going. Now that the wall is down, everyone is saying we should just abandon it."

Li Xinghan frowned at this. "Clan Head," she advised, "our market has been delayed because of the conflict with the Capital immortals Dao. It’s ninety percent complete but sitting idle in the dense forest. While now isn't the right time, we will eventually open it. If we can hold the desert outpost, the increased traffic will be highly beneficial for the market."

"The talk in the family is just elders worrying about their descendants. We don't need to heed it." Li Zhouluo laughed aloud. "I heard you brought something back for Fifth Brother, is that true?"

Li Xinghan wasn't surprised. She had acquired the White Falcon Gold openly, exchanging her own resources with the clan stores to get it, so of course, Li Zhouluo knew. "That's correct," she replied. "I obtained seven liang of White Falcon Gold in the desert. It’s for Fifth Brother. I already sent someone to deliver it."

Li Zhouluo shook his head. "You send it over today, and in a month, it will probably be a hairpin on some beauty's head. You don't know his personality. He asked me for various types of metals several times in the past few years... He’s useless at most things, but he has a real talent for forging hairpins."

Li Xinghan sighed at this. "I suspected it was for such a purpose. But this was the first time he ever asked me for anything; I couldn't just ignore him. It’s not a critical item anyway. Consider it material for him to practice his craft."

Li Zhouluo, still in good spirits these past days, chuckled and shook his head. He picked up a black scroll with silver borders from his desk. "But let’s not talk about him. I have some excellent news for you."

He smiled. "A few days ago, several of the clan elders were talking and you were mentioned. The Old Master brought up the topic of your Dharma Artifact. Since the Daoist Master isn't currently in the clan, and your sword requirements are very high, he suggested that you inherit one of the family's blades."

Li Xinghan loved the Way of the Sword. Hearing this, she grew visibly excited. "Heavens... Which one could it be?!"

Li Zhouluo untied the scroll in his hand, slowly unfurling it as he smiled. "Three chi, nine cun, and three fen long. Ninety-two jin and twelve liang heavy. Bright as flowing water, pure as white frost..."

'Hanlin!'

Li Xinghan knew the dimensions of every artifact-sword in the clan by heart. The moment Li Zhouluo recited the length, she knew. She was simultaneously stunned and overjoyed. "How... how can it be Hanlin?"

Many in the Li clan practiced the sword, and Hanlin—known as the sword "Colder than Winter Snow, Sharp as the Autumn Harvest"—was highly revered. Its previous owner, Li Xijun, had managed the clan's affairs, lending the blade an extra aura of authority. Since Li Xijun left no heirs, it had remained in the treasury... This sword held a unique weight among the clan's blades. Excluding the sword on Li Zhouluo's desk—Coilling Dragon Pillar—which was more symbolic than practical, Hanlin was second only to Qingchi.

Li Xinghan had imagined that Li Zhouluo might get a new blade and pass the Xushi sword down to her, or perhaps that Li Chenghuai would give her his Darksea Serpent. She had never dared to covet Hanlin. She stood frozen in place.

Li Zhouluo gave a long sigh. "When Grand-Uncle Xijun fell, the Old Master took this sword back. No one from the Second branch was qualified to take it. Thus, the Old Master overruled all objections and decided to entrust it to you first."

Li Xinghan accepted the scroll with both hands, her head bowed low. This kind of precious artifact could not be transferred by proxy; she would have to take the scroll and retrieve it herself. Her eyes reddened. "I must go thank the Old Master personally."

Li Xinghan was part of the First branch. If any other elder from that branch had tried to designate Hanlin for her, it would have invited gossip and criticism. Only the Old Master, Li Xuanxuan, could make such a decision with absolute authority, beyond all reproach.

Li Zhouluo nodded, watching her leave. He processed affairs in the hall for the better part of the day, his mood excellent, realizing he hadn't rested in days. Sighing, he finally decided to allow himself a short walk.

He had barely stepped out of the hall when he saw several of his uncles waiting before the palace, all wearing bitter expressions. He stopped immediately, frowning. "What is it?"

Dili Guang shook his head.

Li Zhouluo had learned well the tenacity of these clansmen in recent days. When it came to begging for resources or positions, each was more shameless than the last, yet they were all his elders. Seeing them gathered like this could only mean trouble. "We'll use the side hall," he said darkly. "Do not let them see us."

He had just turned when Li Wen approached with a steady stride. Li Wen bowed before the hall. "Clan Head, the Jade Court Guard has received word. A large group of cultivators ascended Mount Qingdu to submit a report. They presented a joint blood petition, claiming that the leaders of the Four Prefectures of the West Bank are colluding, deceiving their superiors and oppressing the populace. They plead for Mount Qingdu to intervene and administer justice."

Li Zhouluo’s heart seized. The joy vanished from his face, replaced by utter disbelief. "What?! The Four Prefectures of the West Bank?!"

He froze, asking in a low voice, "Where are they now?"

"They are all on Mount Qingdu," Li Wen replied. "It coincided with several elders emerging from seclusion. Even Lord Chengzhi has been summoned up the mountain. The matter has blown up."

Although Li Chengzhi was a mortal, he was the Daoist Master's direct son, so the loyal Li Wen still referred to him as 'Lord'. Li Zhouluo suddenly broke out in a cold sweat. The Li family consisted of Sixteen Prefectures, Two Peaks, and One Mountain; the West Bank accounted for four of those prefectures. To put it bluntly, nothing this serious had happened at Mount Qingdu since the prefecture system was established, let alone a blood petition from all the cultivators of the West Bank!

He gritted his teeth. "No wonder that crowd was waiting at the entrance..."

The names of the Sixteen Prefectures, Two Peaks, and One Mountain were all clear in Li Zhouluo’s mind. He immediately identified the individuals responsible: "An Xuanxin, Ren Ting, Li Chengpan, and Li Hun... They went to Mount Qingdu, not the Jade Court Guard... This means Li Chengpan and Li Hun are the ones pulling the strings..."

The West Bank was populated by the scattered, minor clans left behind from He Jiumen’s era. They had always lacked a voice within the Li family, ignored by every major faction. Yet, the region was rich in spiritual ore, and its prefectures were always carved up as spoils by the different cliques...

"An Xuanxin represents the Huayu faction. Ren Ting’s Ren Clan belongs to the Lijing faction. Li Chengpan is a direct descendant who was pushed into his position, and Li Hun is from a branch family... Good. Everyone’s involved."

He closed his eyes briefly. "I'm heading to Mount Qingdu immediately... You've heard the details. Is the evidence conclusive?"

Li Wen replied respectfully, "It’s about eighty or ninety percent certain."

"Are Mount Qingdu and the Jade Court Guard blind... "

Li Zhouluo felt this news was a bolt from the blue. He rushed over, listening as Li Wen replied earnestly, "My lord, the situation is complex. I didn't understand it all. It is better if you hear the details on the peak."

Li Wen was honest and loyal, but it was precisely this honesty that frustrated Li Zhouluo now. He had no chance to slow down and prepare on the way. He could only steel himself and fly over. Moments later, he landed on the summit of Mount Qingdu. As expected, it was crowded everywhere.

"The Clan Head is here!" Cries rose from all over the peak.

The main hall at the highest point was already full. The elder Chen Donghe stood off to the side, while the white-robed An Siwei stood with his head bowed. The others seated were all seniors—some with cultivation, some without, some looking ancient beyond measure—all occupying the head seats.

Li Zhouluo’s gaze swept the room, landing on the key figures.

First on the left was the Daoist Master’s direct son, the aged Li Chengzhi, who looked terribly weak and seemed to be slumped in his chair. Standing beside him, powdered and painted, was his own Fifth Brother, Li Zhouming.

Below them sat the elder Li Chenghao. This man was the uncle of his elder brothers, Li Zhoufang, and had recently broken through to Qi Refining, granting him new status in the clan. Middle-aged and strong, his hair only lightly grayed, he stared intently at Li Zhouluo.

On the other side sat elders of an even higher generation: the gray-robed, severe-faced Elder Li Xi’e, who was Li Cheng’s father and held immense status. Slightly below him was the rounded, pale-skinned Li Xixuan, the father of his aunt, Li Minggong.

'This is a disaster.'

Among the oldest generation of elders, these four were the only ones who really mattered. Li Zhouluo sighed internally. Fortunately, Li Xuanxuan’s expression remained normal, which calmed his nerves slightly. He walked to the main seat amid the greetings and only then noticed someone kneeling on the floor.

The man appeared to be a minor family head from the West Bank, surnamed He, distantly related to the He Jiumen of old. He must have been the one who led the petition. But he had no right to speak here. Chen Donghe had already presented the silk document.

The first item listed accused Li Chengpan and the others of soliciting bribes when collecting spiritual grain and ore, amounting to a staggering thirty percent cut.

This wasn't unheard of; such things happened in every prefecture and peak. The Jade Court Guard was spread thin across the lake prefectures and mostly just monitored the final year-end collections. After being caught a few times, most officials learned to steal small amounts—one or half a percent—during normal times, unlike Li Chengpan, who was blatantly arrogant.

"It's only because the West Bank has no backing... they are just lambs to the slaughter."

Li Zhouluo skipped past that line. The next accusation was far more severe: The He family accused Ren Ting of tyranny, abuse of power, and forcing a woman of the He family to become his concubine.

The final item concerned the West Bank's mineral veins, which were complex and shifting. New branch veins often appeared, sometimes changing monthly. An Xuanxin and the others had colluded to conceal these new veins and embezzle the ore... They had sent people from the East Bank to do the actual mining, but someone with intentions had recorded it all.

He finished reading, set the letter down, his heart sinking. 'These four... their connections run too deep...'

Before he could speak, the rounded, pale Li Xixuan said in a low voice, "Clan Head! The Jade Court Guard already investigated the matter regarding Ren Ting. The He family sent that girl over themselves! Now they’re turning around and slinging mud... We have the marriage contract and the letters. The man’s fawning words are written right on them. We can bring them out for confrontation!"

Li Zhouluo looked at the stack of letters presented to him and paused. The Ren Clan was part of the Lijing faction and also part of the First branch. Li Xixuan's wife—Li Minggong's mother—was surnamed Ren. This Ren Ting was Li Minggong's biological uncle...

The others remained silent, clearly confident in their own positions, waiting for him to deal with the letters. Li Zhouluo could only brace himself and question the kneeling Clan Head He.

The old man just lamented, "Those above us are Immortals and officials. When they give us so much as a look, what choice do we have but to fawn over them?"

His words left Li Zhouluo speechless. Nearby, Li Chengzhi hesitated, but Fifth Brother Li Zhouming smiled. "Clan Head, the matter of An Xuanxin’s mines is also suspicious. All records have been retrieved from Yuting. Those minerals *were* delivered to the island."

Li Zhouluo finally found an opening. "Why did they not follow standard procedure?"

Li Zhouming hurried to explain, "At that time, we were in the middle of the war with the Capital immortals Dao. There was no reply from the island for days, and that branch vein was about to shift and disappear. An Xuanxin feared the resources would be wasted. He submitted a separate letter after the excavation, which the family did review at the time."

Li Zhouluo did recall these items. But such reports came in every year; minor branch veins that appeared outside the main records were impossible to verify. Whatever amount they reported was the amount recorded. Before he could respond, the displeased-looking Li Chenghao spoke up: "I personally trained Li Chengpan! Everyone in this family knows his character! He is incapable of doing such things!"

This was the uncle of his elder brothers, the Li Zhoufang brothers. Li Zhouluo was already feeling numb. "There is evidence for every matter. How can this be settled with a simple 'impossible'?"

Of the group, only Li Chenghao's father, the gray-robed Elder Li Xi’e, had not spoken. Now that all his allies had said their piece, everyone turned to look at the old man. Li Xi’e coughed once and said quietly, "We ask the Clan Head to investigate clearly."

"..."

The entire group of elders stared at him. Li Zhouluo studied the letter, suppressing his irritation.

'Father is already in seclusion, otherwise, I would fetch the Talisman Brush and test these people!'

Li Chengzhi and Li Zhouming, as direct Purple Mansion descendants, likely couldn't be tested accurately, and Li Xixuan was probably the same. But he didn't need to test the elders. Li Zhouluo ignored their words and simply ordered, "Bring the four individuals in question up."

A "Yes" echoed from far below. The four men entered the hall and knelt one by one. Li Chengpan knelt at the very front. He was Li Zhouluo’s clan-uncle, and handsome enough, but he kept his head down and said nothing.

Among the three behind him, the one with the highest status was An Xuanxin. The young man's answers were fluent; according to him, every single mine vein had been reported, and he could even pinpoint the exact date for each.

Li Zhouluo asked a few more questions. The four either remained silent or stubbornly stuck to their stories. The atmosphere in the hall finally grew awkward. The elders fell silent, carefully listening to Li Zhouluo's interrogation.

Li Zhouming, who had been looking around enjoying the show, seemed to wake up as if from a dream. He finally sensed the shift in the atmosphere. He stood up straight, studying the expressions of everyone present, and muttered internally:

'Aren't they just making things difficult for Fourth Brother... What are these elders plotting...'
