# Chapter 927: Restored Honor

'Jianghuzi's original intentions were likely good. Otherwise, she wouldn't have stubbornly kept silent for so many years. Gao Fu must also genuinely feel a sense of old gratitude. If not, as a man of his stature, a king, there would be no need for him to silently show goodwill to me, a descendant of Wei-Li, at such a sensitive time. There must be some helplessness involved, but someone in the north definitely exploited the situation...'

Li Zhouwei waited quietly, his heart gradually settling.

'But neither Tinglan nor Houfu are fools. A hundred years ago, perhaps, but now? The death of Kui Qi forced them to drop their high-and-mighty airs. If they think they can use the same old tricks to deal with them... it won't be so easy!'

Sure enough, after a short wait, the Great Void rippled. A waterfall of purple light streamed down, revealing a woman in purple robes. Her features were lovely, with fine brows and elegant eyes. She gave a slight bow and said softly:

"Greetings, King Bolie."

Her attitude was very respectful. The king before her nodded slightly and replied:

"So, it is Shuxiu. Congratulations on achieving your divine ability! After you left the lands of Qi, several of the old masters of the formation dao there still miss you. When they received news of you some years ago, they were overjoyed. They even sent word straight to my royal palace."

Li Zhouwei suddenly understood.

'This Daoist Master Tinglan was originally from Qi State! She was the apprentice Daoist Master Zipei went to recruit! And now, it seems she knew this King Bolie from long ago... Listening to his tone, unlike the other cultivators of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, she, Tinglan, might even share a bond of Monarch and subject with Gao Fu!'

Then, Daoist Master Tinglan blinked gently and said in a low voice:

"Your Majesty is too gracious. Shuxiu is deeply grateful. That is why today, hearing that the King's chariot was crossing the river, I came specially to welcome you. If I have offended... please forgive me."

With a light gesture, she guided them. The three of them broke through the Great Void and landed on a mountain cliff by the river.

This spot directly faced a sandy beach and the surging river waters. A pavilion stood tall on the cliff's edge, guarded by two attendants. As they landed inside the pavilion, Li Zhouwei secretly let out a sigh of relief.

He had to admit, Tinglan's arrival was timely. Only she could have invited Gao Fu to land. Otherwise, the two of them would have had to continue their awkward standoff in the Great Void, and worse, they would have had to consider the feelings of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition.

The woman skillfully defused the situation, taking a seat in the pavilion and beginning to brew tea. She spoke softly,

"King Bolie has traveled all the way south. Have the matters been settled?"

Gao Fu had a powerful build. Seated in the pavilion, he possessed a truly imposing aura. He stroked his beard and said:

"It went... adequately. The Huai River Dao was established by Emperor Zhaowu of Zhao back in the day. For all these years, it has existed mostly in name, comprising just one or two prefectures. After the violent death of the Duke of Xu, the capital had long intended to conquer it, but it has been delayed for so many years..."

"Now, the three sects—Chengyun, Capital immortals, and Xuanmiao—have all pledged allegiance to Zhao Shuo and have been reformed into the Huai River Daoist tradition. Fortunately, the matter was resolved easily, without many casualties."

In truth, Gao Fu's journey south was a policy of appeasement toward the three immortal sects. It was also the result of internal disunity among the Buddhist cultivators, with various factions working to restrain each other. This was already the best possible outcome amid misfortune. Tinglan held no great resentment toward Gao Fu, only asking in a low voice:

"I wonder, for the three sects of Jiangbei, how was the Profound Governance Pavilion recorded?"

The two seemed to have no north-south divide between them at all. Gao Fu sipped his tea naturally.

"Daoist Master Changyun of Chengyun Gate cultivates 'Geng Metal.' His Daoist tradition has now been verified; it originates from an ancient lineage and is subordinate to Encompassing Profoundity."

"Daoist Master Yehui of the Capital immortals Dao cultivates 'Capital Guard.' His origins are even clearer—unquestionably of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition."

"As for Daoist Master Sumian of Xuanmiao Temple..."

Gao Fu's expression turned solemn. He paused slightly before answering:

"I am acquainted with this Daoist Master Sumian. It is now said throughout the mountains that he took Qiuxin and went overseas, seeking a place for secluded cultivation to help Qiuxin break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. He even took that Grandmaster statue with him, leaving behind only a handwritten letter."

He spoke with a trace of amusement,

"If the Buddhists come, he joins the Buddhists. If Qi comes, he joins Qi. When the Dao sects are extinguished one day, he will move to Gehu Peak."

Li Zhouwei frowned inwardly.

'Sumian really has some skill, to have predicted so long ago that Gao Fu would be the one to come south and clean things up...'

The so-called 'If Qi comes, he joins Qi' referred to King Bolie, who was the King of Qi. It was just that there had once been an Emperor of Qi who met a bad end. The Gao family shared no Daoist tradition or bloodline with him, so they naturally couldn't use the 'Qi' title, opting for 'Bolie' instead...

And the so-called Gehu Peak was the very spirit mountain formed from the death of Changxi!

After all, Xuanmiao Temple belonged to the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition and held no strong bias between the north and south. They had even befriended many northern cultivators. With their Purple Mansion Realm expert away, no matter what trouble Xuanmiao Temple got into, the consequences wouldn't be too tragic. The final path of retreat Sumian had left for them was that very mountain.

Li Zhouwei merely frowned, while Tinglan offered her thanks. Just then, a group of people quickly ascended the cliff. Chen Yang came forward, holding a metal box, and said respectfully:

"Greetings, Daoist Masters!"

Unsure of King Bolie's attitude, the Li family subordinates naturally wouldn't send a direct descendant. They only allowed Chen Yang to approach, presenting the box respectfully.

"Jianghuzi passed away some days ago. Before her death, she exhausted her cultivation, creating seven talismans. She died from the complete depletion of her cultivation essence and blood. The phenomenon was not significant. Everything she left is now in this box."

Li Zhouwei took it from his hand first. In that brief moment of contact, his spiritual sense swept over it lightly before he passed it to Gao Fu. The King Bolie accepted the golden box and opened it gently. Inside lay seven golden talismans and a small letter.

'Golden Armor Mystic Art Talisman.'

Li Zhouwei already knew what was inside, so he wasn't surprised. Although the Golden Armor Mystic Art Talisman was a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman, it wasn't particularly remarkable. It could only condense a suit of dharma power armor to defend against an enemy's Dharma Arts.

Gao Fu's pupils, however, dilated. He stared in silence, choked with emotion. He put the talismans away, his formidable eyes immediately shutting tight, and he kept them closed for a long time. Finally, he looked at the last letter. It contained only eight words:

"Jiangnan is at peace. I was fortunate to meet a good end."

She hadn't mentioned a single thing about the Gao family, yet she emphasized that her end was 'good.' King Bolie closed his eyes, accepted the letter, and gave a slight bow:

"Many thanks, Young Master!"

After saying this one word of thanks, he spoke no more. He tore through the Great Void and disappeared.

Li Zhouwei bowed in farewell. Beside him, Tinglan flicked a finger, and a purple barrier of light instantly enveloped the pavilion. She said softly,

"Fellow Daoist Minghuang is truly extraordinary!"

"Greetings, Senior."

Li Zhouwei's eyes shone as he replied:

"Thank you, Senior, for resolving the situation!"

Hearing this, a chill rose in Tinglan's eyes. She closed them and let out a heavy sigh.

"If I hadn't come, this would have been troublesome..."

She seemed somewhat vexed, saying in a low voice:

"I had no idea that Senior Gao Xijiang was in your esteemed clan's territory! Thankfully, your clan handled it well. Otherwise, I don't know how this could have been explained!"

Li Zhouwei's eyes darkened. He asked:

"Does the Gao family have a divine ability expert with the surname Shilou?"

The question was deeply meaningful, striking right at the heart of the matter.

Li Zhouwei didn't understand the internal workings of the Gao family, but the will of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was law. This King Bolie clearly felt gratitude for the old Wei-Li, yet there was still opposing sentiment within the Gao family. There was only one possibility—the opposing voice was also at the Purple Mansion Realm.

'Within the Gao family, there is at least one Purple Mansion Realm expert who wishes to restore the Shilou name and sever all ties with the Wei State. They probably used Jianghuzi's status as an elder to demand he cross the river... This also happened to align with the North's need to sow discord. With pressure from both sides, King Bolie was forced to make this trip south...'

'If Gao Fu hadn't come personally, someone from the Gao family with the restored surname 'Shilou' would have come instead. The scene would have become extremely ugly. That is why he *had* to come himself!'

Tinglan stared at him for a moment before replying:

"Precisely. Shilou Wei and Shilou Yingge are both influential figures in the Gao family... For many years, the Gao family has been conflicted over the matter of their allegiance to Wei..."

Hailing from the lands of Qi, she naturally understood this matter well; otherwise, she wouldn't have rushed over. Her eyes now held a cold light as she said in a low voice:

"Senior Xijiang held great prestige. Her only remaining wish was simply to see a descendant of Wei..."

"If that senior had died at your hands, or suffered any harsh treatment, the northern powers would have immediately sent a Shilou Purple Mansion Realm expert charging south to raise hell and seize the opportunity to sever the relationship between Gao and Li with one stroke!"

"But they waited and waited. Jianghuzi remained safe and sound at your home. She even held on long enough to distinguish right from wrong and leave a final statement. They had to settle for the next best thing: forcing Gao Fu to come himself. On one hand, it sowed discord. On the other... this pawn was instead turned against King Bolie himself!"

She had only said half, but Li Zhouwei understood. His eyes narrowed.

"The northern factions just finished scheming together against the Buddhist cultivators and reaping the rewards. Now, retaliation comes immediately, forcing King Bolie to cross the river, yet no one steps up to support him. The severity of the plotting and backstabbing in the north is plain to see!"

Given the awkward position of Wei-Li, King Bolie—a king of the Zhao State with a different surname—was already under considerable suspicion. Yet, he still treated the Wei-Li with courtesy... This King Bolie, Gao Fu, was a man of thick righteousness and gratitude. He couldn't even bring himself to call him 'Fellow Daoist'...

'And this King Bolie, and Jianghuzi... they bore my family no malice. Jiang Huzi's original intention was probably just to see my family for herself...'

Tinglan nodded gently, her voice soft.

"As it stands, word will inevitably spread through the Huai River Dao that the Gao clan still harbors feelings for Wei-Li. For King Bolie, this is truly not a good thing."

Li Zhouwei clasped his hands behind his back, gazing at the surging river below the mountain. He remained silent for a long time before speaking softly,

"King Bolie has great bearing. He persuaded the three immortal sects and holds no malice toward the south. Naturally, there is a crowd of people who want to force him out! They cannot tolerate his presence for even a moment."

Daoist Master Tinglan sipped her tea in the pavilion, finally setting the matter aside. She asked:

"Why is Zhaojing not here?"

Li Zhouwei understood her meaning. If they had known the situation beforehand, it naturally would have been better for Li Ximing to come and greet Gao Fu. But first, they hadn't known Gao Fu was coming south, nor the significance of his trip, so they couldn't have prepared. And second... Li Ximing wasn't here. He replied:

"My elder wishes to find a spiritual fire. He has already gone overseas and will not be able to return for some time."

"Spiritual fire..."

When Li Zhouwei said this, Tinglan looked slightly puzzled.

"Is he searching for you...? There's no need to be so hasty..."

Li Zhouwei saw her concerned expression and had an idea. He replied:

"Not at all. There is an ancestral secret art that requires Radiant Fire to be performed. We have been unable to obtain it for a long time, so he went out to search for some clues."

Only then did Tinglan understand. She pondered, "The Radiant Fire... in the Yue State, it is confirmed that only Hengzhu possesses a portion. As for the Wu State, the Qing family also had some back then. But every one of them is arrogant and haughty. A spiritual fire is not like other things; it is not easily bartered for."

She spoke of Radiant Fire, but in reality, as long as his family obtained *any* spiritual fire, they could likely use the Intercalary Sun Art to trade for Radiant Fire. But Li Zhouwei understood the value of the Intercalary Sun Art and wouldn't reveal it easily, so he just shook his head, feigning disappointment.

Tinglan, however, took it to heart. She said seriously:

"I previously mentioned the Southern Borderlands to him; he could go take a look. I will also make some inquiries on his behalf. As soon as I have news, I will let him know."

Li Zhouwei was a little surprised and nodded. He was just about to take his leave when Tinglan said softly:

"These past few days... Zhu Gong's injuries have been constantly worsening. Compounding old wounds with new is already troublesome, but a few days ago, her Dharma Body began to show signs of collapse. She won't be healed anytime soon."

"Back in the Eastern Sea, Hengxing was already very displeased with her and absolutely refuses to pay her any mind. We asked Houfu to look at her some time ago, but it was difficult to treat. I came this time hoping to find Zhaojing."

Li Zhouwei frowned inwardly. He wasn't familiar with this Zhu Gong, nor would he make decisions for Li Ximing, and he certainly didn't want to get involved. He replied:

"My elder won't be gone for too long. When he returns, I will be sure to inform him."

Tinglan nodded silently and quickly departed from the pavilion, leaving Li Zhouwei standing in the mountain wind. Below his feet, the river surged past jagged rocks, white waves churning. Not until the sun had set did he let out a heavy breath.

"Who in any family is truly free!"

...

Southern Borderlands.

Mountain ranges rose and fell, dense jungles stretched out, birds soared, and packs of Demons roared. One after another, range upon range, Demon mountains pressed against Demon mountains, and Demon kingdoms bordered Demon kingdoms.

Li Ximing crossed thousands of miles, traveling first from the Vermillion Sea to the Southern Sea, then from the Southern Sea to Shahuan. He bypassed the Piaoren Kingdom and flew all the way to the myriad Demon ranges bordering the Great Western Plateau.

The journey was filled with the stench of slaughter and blood. Near the borders, there were still a few kingdoms ruled by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. But in the depths, it was truly the dominion of Demons. They governed their kingdoms with iron fists. The native peoples were scrawny and emaciated, treated like cattle or sheep, scurrying with their heads bowed. The Demon beasts, in contrast, were fat and imposing, riding in tall carriages that sped past.

There were many native peoples here, but none who spoke the language of the central lands. They all used their own native tongues and had customs similar to the Demons. They didn't know how to use cups or chopsticks, eating only with their hands. Most practiced some form of Buddhist arts, though they couldn't even be considered monks.

Li Ximing took one look and understood.

'In the end, Buddhist arts are useful. They allow people to await death in peace, praying for the next life. Even the Demon kingdoms enjoy using them.'

From this, it was clear these native peoples were not living well. The common folk in the north, who only wished for death, at least had land to farm. But the people here were numb, begging for the scraps of Demon beasts to survive. They were worse off than those in the north!

Demon beasts were not skilled in formations, so there were few restrictions in these areas. Li Ximing shuttled through the Great Void and soon arrived at the so-called Xipo Kingdom.

This kingdom was opulent and magnificent, built around a high mountain. Unlike the pavilions and courtyards of Jiangnan, this place was filled with tall pagodas and bell towers. Gemmed trees swayed in the wind, shrouded in five-colored mists. A thousand varieties of strange flowers bloomed everywhere. There were hardly any human figures to be seen; instead, all sorts of Demon beasts, dressed in clothes, moved about in a bustling spectacle.

But a thousand miles beyond this mountain, one would witness a living hell. Smoke and fire were everywhere as tribes of Demon beasts slaughtered each other, all to offer up blood sacrifices to the central city-state.

'Here, it is Demons enslaving other Demons. There are no traces of humanity. This is a true Demon kingdom...'

Li Ximing descended on a beam of light. From within the magnificent pagoda, a pair of Demon generals immediately rode the wind to greet him. After just one glance, one Demon bowed to him, gesturing for him to wait, while the other immediately turned and shouted into the pitch-black doorway of the pagoda.

Great bells chimed from within the pagoda. Two rows of Demon generals rushed out. Clouds gathered in the sky, and auspicious mists descended. A loud cry echoed from the depths of the pagoda, shouting in some unknown language.

"Awoooo..."

At this, Auspicious Qi surged, and a blinding golden light flared. A man flew out from the pagoda. His pupils were a mix of white and red, and his face was both wickedly handsome and demonic. He wore armor of white bone and robes of blood-red silk, his ominous might palpable and terrifying. A pair of golden wings grew from his back, and he stood upon surging golden clouds, staring fixedly at Li Ximing.

This Demon's aura was immense, brimming with auspicious light. He held a glittering long saber in his hand. His cultivation was at the early Purple Mansion Realm, but with a divine ability flowing in his eyes and auspicious clouds beneath his feet, he gave Li Ximing an extremely dangerous feeling.

This Demon was none other than the Great Suopo King of the Xipo Kingdom!

'A figure who could fight his way to the top in the depths of the Southern Borderlands and establish his own Demon kingdom... none of them are weak. This is completely different from the Eastern Sea and Southern Sea, where the Dragon-kin rule. This one is not only of noble blood, but he is likely terrifying in combat!'

Li Ximing sized up his Dharma Body, then bowed slightly.

"This humble one is Zhaojing, from Moongaze Lake."

The Demon beast was stunned for a moment, then realization dawned. He opened his mouth, and surprisingly, spoke in perfect, formal court language—and with a Jiangnan accent, no less:

"So, it is a Fellow Daoist! Please!"

Li Ximing was inwardly astonished. The Demon, however, seemed to understand Jiangnan etiquette quite well. He did not invite Li Ximing into the pagoda, but instead pointed to a small, iridescent pavilion over a pond.

"I was unaware of the Daoist Master's celestial arrival. I have truly been rude!"

With a spin, he transformed into a white-robed scholar. Yet, he still had that wickedly handsome face and red-and-white pupils. He looked less like a scholar and more like a demonic advisor intent on bringing ruin to a kingdom.

He invited Li Ximing to sit and smiled.

"I am Fuxun, Lord of the Xipo Kingdom... That tiger demon claimed he had a Daoist Master backing him, and it turns out it was true. Today, I get to see you in person! My divine ability must be shining, bringing me such good fortune. But I must also thank the Daoist Master for being willing to make the trip to my humble wilderness!"

The other party cultivated Auspicious Qi, so it wasn't wrong to say it was due to his divine ability. Li Ximing hadn't expected this Fuxun to be so eloquent. His Jiangnan accent even sounded quite familiar. He replied:

"Your Majesty speaks Jiangnan's dialect so well. It is truly familiar to hear!"

Fuxun shook his head and smiled.

"I have a good friend who hails from Jiangnan. He settled here some time ago to manage some affairs for me and, along the way, taught me some of the Jiangnan dialect."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing's interest was immediately piqued, but Fuxun cut him off with a smile.

"Since Fellow Daoist is here, shall we get down to business?"

Between the two of them, there was naturally only business to discuss. Li Ximing didn't stand on ceremony either. He said seriously:

"Please, Fellow Daoist, show me the outline for the alchemy. I must examine it closely to ensure this pill can be refined. Only then will we have a reason to continue this discussion..."

"Good!"

The scholar-like Demon laughed and retrieved a wooden slip from his sleeve. Before Li Ximing even touched it, he felt a jolt of surprise and asked, astonished:

"Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood?"

The slip in the Demon's hand was indeed made from Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood and looked ancient. Hearing the question, the old Demon wasn't surprised. He just held the slip in his hand and smiled.

"I've heard that the Yue State is the territory of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. I wonder, where does Fellow Daoist rank in the Dao of Alchemy?"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

Truthfully, among all the alchemists in Jiangnan today, perhaps only Xiao Chuting and Hengxing were his equals. Everyone else was either a step below him or had long since been left in his dust. He took a modest position and said humbly:

"I wouldn't presume to be the best, but I am ranked third."

Fuxun's eyes lit up. He felt Li Ximing was being modest.

"Please!"

Li Ximing's spiritual sense moved. As expected, the latter half of the wooden slip was locked. He read the accessible part carefully, his brow furrowing in silence.

Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill!

The refinement method for this pill was unlike anything he had ever seen. It was extremely ancient, a method for creating a Mystic Pill. It didn't pursue the creation of as many pills as possible in one batch, but rather sought to condense all the medicinal power into a single point, taking the meaning of 'profound unity.' If it succeeded, it would form one pill. If it failed, there would be nothing left at all.

The current Dao of Alchemy had already reached a pinnacle. An expert Alchemist like Li Ximing could produce six or more pills in a single furnace. Even a poor attempt would yield one or two. There was no precedent for a refinement leaving *nothing* behind.

And the main ingredients for this pill were even more peculiar. It required the heart of a Purple Mansion Realm-level Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat, paired with a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item of the 'Auspicious Qi' variety called Non-Falling Golden Cloud... The difficulty was astronomical, even higher than Tinglan's Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill back in the day!

Li Ximing stared, wanting to speak but stopping himself. His first reaction was:

'This Demon! What an astonishingly deep foundation!'

Fuxun saw his expression and grew anxious. He clearly understood just how demanding his request was. Li Ximing shook his head.

"Fellow Daoist, this pill is truly... awkward!"

One had to know, the Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat was already extinct. Even in ancient times, it was a noble of the Purple Mansion Realm, just one tier below the Dragon-kin. It was on the same level as the Surging Li Wuping Fire-Yang Luan Wu Pian that Li Zhouwei had seen. This was equivalent to digging out Wu Pian's heart and then refining it with the Non-Falling Golden Cloud, a substance that feared not the Mansion Water and could discern good from evil!

In other words, if this refinement failed, it wouldn't just be a waste of spiritual resources—it would be the literal destruction of two *extraordinary* Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items. Forget Fuxun, a Demon from the savage lands; even Li Ximing himself would spit blood and fly into a rage if someone wasted two such items!

Questioned like this, Fuxun looked embarrassed. But he couldn't afford the loss either and absolutely did not dare to offer any guarantees. He could only sigh in silence.

'No wonder no one has been willing to refine this for the Demon after all this time!'

Li Ximing cursed inwardly. He made a quick calculation, hesitating slightly.

'It's not... impossible. If I could borrow Xiukui's spiritual furnace... it might just work... But the probability is only seventy or eighty percent...'

But in the end, the matter was too troublesome. He had to see the payment first. He replied:

"This Daoist Master made a special trip to the Southern Borderlands because I require a Purple Mansion Realm-level spiritual fire."

He understood how precious spiritual fire was, so he immediately added:

"Even a clue to its whereabouts would be good."

As soon as he said this, Fuxun's red-and-white pupils stared at him. He rested one hand on the table and tapped the armrest with the other, seeming to judge his sincerity. He quickly replied:

"I won't hide it from you, Fellow Daoist. To the west of my Xipo Kingdom, there is a place called Baijia Kingdom. The ruler of Baijia Kingdom is a Vermilion Bird. She has a fire in her possession called White Xi Karma Fire. If Fellow Daoist is interested, you can kill that bird and take her flame!"

This statement made Li Ximing shake his head. He wasn't some naive fool. How could he get entangled in the struggles between these Demon kingdoms for Fuxun? He only said:

"I currently have no intention of killing a Demon King or disrupting the balance of power. I am only looking to trade."

"That will be difficult!"

Fuxun sighed heavily. But then he looked at Li Ximing's face, unwilling to let this opportunity slip by. He grit his teeth and said:

"Fellow Daoist, give me a straight answer! If you make the attempt, what are your chances of success!"
