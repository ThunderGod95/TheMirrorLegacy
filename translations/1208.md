# Chapter 1206: Divine Splendor

Myriad-Prosperity Heaven.

White clouds billowed across a wondrous immortal realm, where vast, empty celestial thrones sat vacant. High in the swirling mists rested a small sacrificial altar. A thin veil of gauze shrouded the cavernous black void of a jade disc, and from within, a head with copper-like eyes gazed toward the horizon.

'The matter of Qi Lanyan has been settled...'

The affair of reincarnation was truly difficult. Not only did it require a specific profound medicine, but the demands on one's life-mandate were also substantial. This man lacked the aid of a Metallic Essence, but having participated in the war between north and south, his life-mandate was considered significant.

As Qi Lanyan departed for his next life, Tang Xie fell into silent contemplation:

'I wonder if they intend for him to cultivate the way of Purple and Gold... or the orthodox path...'

For a reincarnated cultivator, if their Dao lineages were connected, cultivating a shortcut like the way of Purple and Gold was not a bad choice. Progress would be exceptionally rapid after achieving a divine ability, and some methods could even elevate one's divine abilities with startling efficacy.

Pondering this, the old man who clung to the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition still felt a lingering fear. Recalling the event, it still felt like a dream.

'The Daoist tradition of Dongjun...'

He had pondered it for hundreds of days and nights, constantly replaying the scene from that day in his mind.

'Even though the Lord of Supreme Yang Azure Profoundity rarely entered the mortal world in ancient times... no matter the reason, He could not have allowed the present age to fall into such a state... It would be one thing if He ignored the first great war, but with the heavens collapsing and the earth sundering in the subsequent two, it would have been impossible for Him to remain indifferent.'

'Only the possibility that He had entered the Supreme Yin Dao and had been slumbering until now could explain it.'

This line of reasoning was indeed irrefutable, yet as he considered it more carefully, doubts began to surface.

'Rumor held that Dongjun ultimately vanished, which would suggest he abandoned the Supreme Yang to dwell in the Supreme Yin. With his status, only a Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment could have possibly supported him. However, several True Monarchs had since achieved the Supreme Yin, meaning the position was already occupied. Where, then, could such an exalted personage reside? There must be some place to uphold his station...'

This left him unable to comprehend for a long time, his heart filled with suspicion:

"If he were occupying some Supreme Yin Auxiliary Position... which Auxiliary Position could possibly contain Dongjun?"

After hundreds of days and nights spent meticulously unraveling this mystery, a glimmer of understanding finally came to him:

'What if this was merely a wisp of a contingency plan, a single profound incarnation? A great master exists... but this master might not be the Lord of Supreme Yang Azure Profoundity, but someone else entirely, residing within the Supreme Yin. Someone of a lower generation than Dongjun, who, even when faced with a mere sliver of his power, could not presume to be the master...'

He mulled it over and over, concluding this was perhaps the only possibility. After all, rumor had it that Dongjun had neither children nor disciples, making it highly probable that he had cultivated the Supreme Yin and vanished, unnoticed by the world.

This deduction did not stir any great emotion in him; to Tang Xie, there was no difference between an Immortal Lord and an Immortal Lord's contingency. The only distinction was whether this contingency would serve to deter the Underworld or to forge an alliance with the Wu Earth:

'Sometimes... a mere sliver of a divided soul can be more fearsome than the original body. After all, the Heavenly Dao moves in cycles and permits nothing to last forever. The original body is bound by its Daoist tradition and Fruition Attainment; even if it is invincible, it must eventually depart...'

He thought on it further and realized it was not his place to worry, yet his restless heart could finally be suppressed no longer. Sensing the faint hint of elevation from within his soul, he remained silent.

Though Tang Xie wished he could re-enter the Immortal Palace the very next day, the decorum of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition compelled him to wait here quietly, using an endless stream of thoughts as a distraction—to show desire was to be manipulated, and Tang Xie had no wish to debase his tradition.

And so he waited for several hundred days, an agonizing wait that felt like a rat gnawing at his heart, until he finally let out a long sigh and thought:

'Since Qi Lanyan, their hidden pawn, has been put in place, it wouldn't be improper to report back to the heavens...'

He placated himself and sank deep into his soul, gradually sensing that point of light. To his surprise, the whiteness merely circled in the hazy distance, refusing to accept him, which made Tang Xie frown:

'Right... that Immortal General mentioned that travel to the heavens is time-restricted... missing the window means a long wait.'

Instantly, a sense of disappointment washed over the Divine Core cultivator. He lingered before the point of light for a moment, feeling unfulfilled, yet he faintly perceived a slight pull from within the hazy glow.

"Hm?"

...

The sky was perpetually dim and colorless. The ruins beneath the pavilion had been cleared away, revealing a smooth, clean floor of jade. A nearby doorway had grown faintly more brilliant, casting slivers of radiant light.

When Yuanshang returned from the heavens with their approval, he discovered a great change. The land itself seemed to have transformed, now suffused with surges of spiritual energy. He also felt a certain authority had been bestowed upon him, from which a divine ability spontaneously arose.

This divine ability was not particularly powerful, but he could faintly sense its immensely high station. Even rarer was that it had been granted to him out of thin air, requiring no cultivation on his part. He found it endlessly profound and incredible, marveling at it in silence.

Possessing a divine ability born of his station as guardian of the Hall of Final Vastness, Yuanshang naturally began by exploring the realm. Besides the main hall, thirteen floating islands dotted the sky, most of which were in a state of utter ruin. Only one smaller pavilion appeared relatively intact.

Yuanshang, of course, did not dare reside in the main hall. Since this was the most complete structure and also the one of lowest rank, he moved into the pavilion. He busied himself repairing the wreckage while also composing secret arts and supplementing the Daoist repository—these were the duties of an Immortal Official, as well as the mandate of the Supreme Yin, and Yuanshang performed them with the utmost respect, daring not to be negligent.

Unlike the impetuous Dangjiang, Yuanshang had spent his later years in the confinement of a single courtyard, so these days were a rare and fulfilling period of tranquility for him. Possessing a higher-level essence gave him a commanding perspective; while completing the Daoist repository, he also restored the pavilion to a state of classic splendor, erasing all traces of its former appearance.

During another day of contemplative work at his desk, Yuanshang was startled by a rare disturbance. Vaguely sensing someone had entered the realm, his expression stirred with a mix of apprehension and delight. He stepped outside the pavilion and called out softly:

"Which Daoist friend has come to visit!"

He saw a Daoist with a copper beard and wide robes standing on the steps, surveying his surroundings with considerable surprise. Seeing someone approach to greet him, he offered a polite salute and replied:

"I am Tang Xie of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition. I have stumbled into this treasured land by mistake... please do not take offense!"

In truth, Tang Xie should not have been so surprised. As an ancient cultivator, he had seen his share of grotto-heavens, which were never without their attached mystic realms, great or small... His own Myriad-Prosperity Heaven once possessed one hall, nine chambers, and seventeen caves. Alas, he had been forced to make a painful sacrifice back then, casting them all into the Dongwang Sea. Later, when the heavens fell and the earth sank, the four seas abruptly receded, and the Dongwang Sea, being a great sea on the edge of the Eastern Sea, was destroyed in the cataclysm.

But what truly astonished him was that this place did not feel like a mystic realm at all. Instead, it gave him the impression of a grotto-heaven of exceedingly high station, one that was perhaps not even inferior to the 'Heavens' itself!

'This is beyond belief...'

Yuanshang's eyes, however, lit up. Concealing his excitement, a look of admiration appeared on his face as he spoke:

"So you are Senior Tang Xie! I've heard of you from Daoist friend Zhengao! To think you are an ancient cultivator from the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition."

This pulled Tang Xie back from his survey of the surroundings. The ancient cultivator stared at the man before him, discovering that he could not see through him in the slightest, and said cautiously:

"Is that so... And you are, Daoist friend...?"

Yuanshang offered a polite salute and smiled.

"I am Yuanshang, merely a Woven Jade of this realm. I was entrusted by Daoist friend Zhengao to guard this land of the Supreme Yin. Daoist friend Zhengao once mentioned that... should the heavens be sealed, this place alone would remain accessible. If you came to visit, Senior... you would undoubtedly arrive here..."

'A Woven Jade, as expected.'

Tang Xie nodded slightly and returned the salute.

A Divine Core cultivator like Tang Xie should have deferred to a Woven Jade, but the Numinous Treasure tradition was, after all, an ancient immortal lineage, and the station of its master was not so far removed. Though his tradition had declined, this manifested externally as a resilient pride.

He had, however, encountered Yuanshang, a cultivator who had risen purely in a later age. Never mind an Immortal Lord, he was not even entirely clear on what a Divine Core cultivator was, and merely estimated that the other party was also at the level of a True Monarch.

'A True Monarch... a figure who can toy with divine abilities in the mortal world as if they were ants, who can suppress the fortunes of millennia... and yet here, he is nothing more than a guest...'

His own mentality was still stuck at the Purple Mansion Realm; just standing to the side made his scalp tingle. He was filled with a complex mix of emotions, so how could he possibly notice whether the other man was merely putting on a brave face? As he entered together with him, he was surprised when the Daoist before him immediately spoke in a low voice:

"May I ask which branch of the Woven Jade you belong to, Daoist friend?"

Yuanshang faltered for a moment and did not reply. Tang Xie's mind raced, and he immediately leaped to the wrong conclusion, thinking he had failed to recognize the man's robes from having been secluded in his grotto-heaven for so many years. He hurriedly tried to recover:

"Since you serve under the Immortal Palace, you must be of either Donghua or Gonghua. It is only that I have been in seclusion for a long time and am not familiar with the great Dao-paths."

What was bound to come had come. Yuanshang sighed softly and answered:

"In terms of Daoist tradition, I am indeed on the Gonghua Dao-path. As for my specific lineage... have you ever heard of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, Daoist friend?"

Those words struck Tang Xie like a bolt of lightning. He stood frozen by the pavilion, his gaze sweeping stiffly over the young man before him as he asked in horror:

"Jiequn?!"

'Hm?'

Since arriving in the heavens, aside from that Immortal Official Dangjiang, this was the first time Yuanshang had met someone who recognized his grandmaster's name. His heart pounded and his eyes blazed with light, but he was a formidable character himself and did not reply at once. Instead, he asked:

"You recognize the name, Senior?"

Despite having just grasped a link between the heavens and the mortal world, Tang Xie was seized by an ominous premonition. He murmured:

"Of course, I do. A... junior from my tradition once ventured out and heard the name of the Supreme Yang..."

He stopped abruptly. Yuanshang's gaze was intense as he pressed,

"And which Daoist friend might that be?"

Tang Xie recovered from his thoughts in an instant, shaking his head with a smile.

"He never mentioned his Daoist title. Besides, this old man spends his days in seclusion within my grotto-heaven. I know a bit if you speak of ancient matters, but when it comes to this Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, I'm afraid I'm not very clear."

Yuanshang could only let the matter drop, but the anxiety in Tang Xie's eyes seemed on the verge of spilling over. Unable to wait another moment, he asked:

"Which master from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition are you, truly?"

Yuanshang sighed to himself and saluted.

"You've misunderstood, Senior. Daoist Master Jiequn is my grandmaster, but this junior only became a Woven Jade through the Chunyi Dao Gate. My Daoist title is Yuanshang!"

'Yuanshang...'

Tang Xie's heart sank as a memory surfaced with sudden clarity:

'Yuanshang... Chunyi Dao Gate... Jiequn's tradition... I feel like I've heard this before. A cultivator who was seeking the Dao failed and transformed into a demonic aberration, then was suppressed and killed by the Underworld...'

A hint of shame colored Yuanshang's words, but he never imagined that the man before him would react as if he'd heard world-shattering news. He sat stunned in his seat as if countless thoughts were racing through his mind. After a long while, he turned his head stiffly and asked abruptly:

"Were you... suppressed by the Underworld... or did the Underworld secretly let you go?"

Yuanshang hadn't expected the other man's thoughts to move so quickly, much less that he would pinpoint his greatest fear with a single question. He answered evasively:

"The Supreme Yin did not answer, and the Underworld mistook me for a demonic aberration."

The statement was not direct, but neither of them was a simple man. It was more than clear enough!

'The Supreme Yin did not answer. The Supreme Yin does not manifest in the world, so of course it would not answer. But a Dao-fruit without a position is still a Dao-fruit! At most, he should have been taken to the Underworld for supervision. What logic is there in treating him as a demonic aberration!'

'Although this Daoist Master Yuanshang appears to be without backing, and the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in the mortal world is like a guttering candle, how could there be any other explanation for his presence here...'

Tang Xie's ominous premonition was finally confirmed, and a chill spread through his heart:

'In other words, he never failed and transformed into a demonic aberration at all—he truly became a Woven Jade... The Underworld concealed the truth and brutally murdered him... To strike down a Woven Jade Immortal who had yet to secure his footing... a few millennia ago, such an act would have been enough to ignite a great war between Golden Cores, or even Dao Embryos!'

At that moment, Tang Xie finally understood the position he was in.

'The 'Heavens' has remained hidden until now, making no move. It is not here to jest with the Heavenly Glow or the Underworld! To coldly watch a Woven Jade Immortal die a violent death, to secretly collect his True Spirit and amass power... it means the conflict between the three powers has likely intensified to a point beyond reconciliation...'

'And I have been unwittingly dragged into the center of it.'

After all, matters of the Immortal Dao are often handled with subtlety. Tang Xie had initially believed he could play both sides, wait for the Supreme Yang's return, and perhaps even secure a seat in the heavens—but what if this was not a simple redistribution of benefits, a contest for certain positions, but a life-and-death struggle that would decide the fate of True Monarchs and even greater beings!

Which side his Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition chose was no longer a matter of sentiment or decorum. It was not even a question of old loyalties or being ostracized by his peers in Tongxuan. If he chose the wrong side, the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition would be utterly destroyed by his own hand!

'This isn't some new monarch of the Treasured Earth seizing a throne, nor is it the Sheji stirring up turmoil. The Underworld and the heavens are fundamentally different powers. The Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition has no one to rely on, and the figures in the heavens can disregard Rank Designations as if they were nothing...'

'And that must be why, out of all the traditions in the world, the heavens chose my Numinous Treasure... because the exceedingly safe Myriad-Prosperity Heaven, shielded by its Rank Designation, is the last place they would look... Luoxia, or the Underworld, must have misjudged the power of the heavens, or else made a grave strategic error...'

This old fox, from just a few words, had managed to spin a long series of deductions, most of which hit upon the most crucial points. It was this speculation that made him realize the danger he was in. A tremor shot through his heart, and his vision swam.

'This is not the rise of a single Daoist tradition, nor the establishment of a new Fruition Attainment... This is likely a brutal, internal—Dao war.'
