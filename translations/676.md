# Chapter 676: Kongheng's Story

Li Ximing's suspicion wasn't just a baseless hunch. At first, not knowing Fu Xia’s true power, he had managed to suppress the monk with the Radiant Origin Pass. But now that Fu Xia had escaped and revealed himself to possess the Dharma Body of a Merciful One, the doubts only grew stronger.

'My Radiant Origin Pass is a powerful suppression technique, but every strength has a weakness,' Li Ximing reasoned. 'Since he has the body of a Merciful One, wouldn't it be far simpler for him to just smash my radiant pass with a single punch?'

A blow from a Merciful One was nothing a Foundation Establishment cultivator could withstand. A direct hit on the core of his immortal foundation would, at best, leave him vomiting blood with seventy percent of his strength gone, utterly incapable of fighting. At worst, it would mean instant death.

'He spits venom at me with every word, and my ancestor killed the Four Wrathful Demon Emperor he reveres. How could he possibly harbor any goodwill? His path is one of demon-subduing ferocity.'

'Even if he wouldn't kill me, intimidated by the Purple Mansion cultivators of Jiangnan, he could have just knocked me aside with one punch. That would give him the upper hand in every way. This constant running and evasion… it's not the way of a Merciful One!'

The battle had unfolded in a blur, and few possessed Li Xijun’s sharp tactical mind. But with a moment to breathe and think things through, Li Ximing’s suspicion hardened into certainty.

When he voiced his thoughts, Kongheng nodded in agreement.

“Very well. I will test him again.”

Kongheng pressed his palms together before his chest, chanting an endless stream of incantations. A five-colored brilliance bloomed from his hands as a vibrant, rainbow-hued rain began to fall from the sky once more. Lotuses blossomed across the lake's surface, filling the air with a rich fragrance.

"Still struggling futilely!" Fu Xia scoffed at the sight, though a flicker of delight shone in his eyes. He allowed the tiger-pelt robe to drape back over his shoulders, letting the colorful rain cascade over him. It shimmered across his gilded skin, creating ripples of multi-hued light.

'Another orthodox restraining technique,' Fu Xia thought. 'His background is truly extraordinary!'

The binding force was immense, but Fu Xia neither dodged nor resisted. He hailed from a great and renowned sect himself; just as his own incantations had little effect on Kongheng, Kongheng's arts were equally limited against him.

Besides, he possessed the Dharma Body of a Merciful One.

Seeing Fu Xia stand firm under the shimmering rain, Kongheng’s expression remained solemn and dignified. Golden chains swirled around him as the Six-Armed Vajra Guardian behind him released its grip, bringing all six arms together before its chest to cradle him. The five-colored light in his hands never dimmed.

A resplendent glow covered the lake, but Li Ximing ignored Kongheng, his gaze locked on Fu Xia. The old monk stood unshaken amidst the downpour. Concentrating the radiant light in his hands, Li Ximing’s mind raced.

'The old monk has barely used any techniques! He's just relying on this Dharma Body.'

Seeing Fu Xia remain motionless, he formed a hand seal and shouted, "Five Waters Imperial Heaven!"

At his command, the great formation of Mount Qingdu roared to life. A dense gray fog surged across the water's surface, obscuring the sky. From within, countless water serpents leaped forth—nimble, cunning creatures wielding weapons condensed from lake water. They charged the monk with reckless abandon.

This was the Five Waters Imperial Heaven Formation of Mount Qingdu.

The activation of the Foundation Establishment-level formation was an impressive sight, but Fu Xia didn't grant it so much as a second glance. "The tricks of an insect," he sneered.

And so it was. The roiling gray mist had no effect, and the water serpents within were exposed by the radiant light of his body. Before they could even get close, they were blown into clouds of white steam by the shimmering phantoms emanating from his gilded skin.

The formation was Liu Changdie's masterpiece, but its core aspects, 'Morning Mist' and 'Serpent Flow,' were designed to handle Qi Refinement cultivators. Against the Dharma Body of a Merciful One, they were utterly useless. Undeterred, Li Ximing watched with a cold expression, his hand seal abruptly changing.

“Non-Buoyancy!”

He touched two fingers together. As the seal formed, a white radiance spread out from beneath his feet. Kongheng and Li Ximing were unaffected, but Fu Xia paused for a fraction of a second, his eyes narrowing.

“Now!”

In that same instant, the radiant pass materialized once more—white bricks stacked high, bright corner towers, and a celestial gate that blazed with blinding light. It slammed down from the sky with a deafening crash, its brilliance forcing the surrounding cultivators to shield their faces with their sleeves.

"Master Kongheng!"

Li Ximing hadn't missed Fu Xia's momentary hesitation. He pushed the Radiant Origin Pass to its absolute limit, radiant light flaring in his eyes as he shook a small flag from his sleeve.

The flag was no bigger than his palm, a fiery crimson-yellow cloth embroidered with shimmering gold thread. It depicted a lifelike crimson sparrow, wreathed in five overlapping rings of red light, its beak open as if breathing fire.

It was a Dongli Sect artifact—the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner!

Unleashed for the first time, five palm-sized rings of red light shot from the banner. They surrounded the ornate base of the Radiant Origin Pass and pulsed in unison, spewing five different kinds of flames.

"By the heavenly pattern, let the Yang-Li execution flames descend!"

The five flames—brown-yellow, pale-yellow, goose-yellow, bright red, and vermillion—pressed down with overwhelming force. A pillar of fire shot into the sky, instantly forming clouds of red and yellow above the lake.

The clouds blazed with crimson light, drawing in the surrounding spiritual energy. Kongheng, still maintaining his restraining spell, had the Six-Armed Vajra Guardian behind him reach out. This time, however, it did not release its golden chains.

'That is a Dongli Sect artifact, and those are Radiant Fire flames. If my chains enter that inferno, they will eventually be melted down!'

His mind worked quickly. All six of the guardian's arms descended at once, pressing down on the radiant gate.

*BOOM!*

The flames raged. Through them, Li Ximing could see the color draining from Fu Xia’s face. A cold sneer touched the young man's lips. "Just as I thought!" he bit out. "I knew something was wrong with you!"

From the moment Fu Xia had appeared before Mount Qingdu, he hadn't used a single spell. Even his escape with the Horned Tiger had relied on an artifact. He clearly possessed the strength to defeat them both with two punches, yet he dragged out the fight, avoiding any real action.

Though Li Ximing was no expert in Buddhist techniques, he had pursued the Dao of the Purple Mansion for years and was well-versed in the theory of spells and cultivation arts. His suspicions had been raised early on.

The most precious and unique aspect of his Five Waters Imperial Heaven Formation was the ‘Non-Buoyancy’ technique. It was crafted from a rareMansion Water material obtained by Yang Xiao'er and was incredibly valuable.

"And its value lies precisely in this," Li Ximing realized. "It excels at draining an opponent's dharma power and disrupting their flight!"

'The problem is his dharma power!'

Connecting this with Fu Xia’s previous actions, the answer struck him in a flash.

"His cultivation has fallen back to the level of a Master Monk! Though he possesses the empty shell of a Merciful One's body, its divine power is lost! This kind of collective Buddhist cultivation, without any personal foundation—it must have severely impacted his own dharma power. With no divine abilities and a body that's incredibly difficult to command, he's just a paper tiger!"

Such beings were not unheard of. He recalled how Li Xuanfeng, in order to channel the power of Geng Metal, had been forced to burn both of his immortal foundations as fuel. How could Fu Xia be any better off?

As Li Ximing explained, Kongheng immediately understood.

"I underestimated the impact of the Four Wrathful Demon Emperor's fall!"

"And this is a Dharma Body that Fu Xia cultivated himself! Having fallen from the rank of a Merciful One, he has the experience and a deep understanding of the Dao. If not for that, he would probably be completely immobile!"

Kongheng was not foolish, merely bound by precepts that forbade him from judging others with a suspicious heart. But with the truth laid bare, it was like a sudden awakening.

"When he arrived on that piece of driftwood, was it purely an act of asceticism? I think not! The body of a Merciful One is immensely heavy. He was afraid his dharma power was insufficient to sustain flight. By riding the wood, he had a physical anchor, allowing him to conserve what little power he had!"

Yet even now, with his pure heart, Kongheng was unwilling to believe Fu Xia had been deceiving him from the start, chalking it up to his journey being "not solely for asceticism."

With this new understanding, they both realized Fu Xia's evasions and his robe-turned-tiger were largely bluffs. A wave of relief washed over them.

*BOOM!*

Fu Xia strained with all his might, struggling to rise. A violent tremor shook the radiant pass, making it sway precariously. Li Ximing showed no mercy. Now that he had his opponent's weakness in hand, he pushed one part of the Five Waters Imperial Heaven Formation to its limit while pulling a small vial from his robes.

"Profound Pattern Vial!"

A torrent of radiant light erupted from the vial, layering itself over the Radiant Origin Pass. If the 'Sun Return' disc wasn't a defensive artifact, Li Ximing would have thrown that on top as well.

'A pity the Chongming Profound Insight Screen is with Zhouwei, or I'd be even more certain of victory.'

Now pressed down as if by a mountain, the Radiant Origin Pass began to stabilize. The five Radiant Fire flames burned fiercely. As Li Ximing's own dharma power plummeted, Fu Xia's struggles grew weaker. He knew his secret—the lack of power to command his Dharma Body—was out.

The old monk sighed and shook his head.

"When it comes to schemes, this old monk is no match for you followers of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao. I had hoped to keep it hidden, but I am not accustomed to deception. You saw right through me."

Li Ximing paid the old monk no mind. He swallowed a pill and focused his entire being, converting all his dharma power into radiant light and pouring it into the radiant gate.

Fu Xia, enduring the raging Radiant Fire, tried his old trick again. He formed a lotus mudra with his fingers, puffed out his cheeks, and spat a mouthful of pink mist.

But Kongheng had been watching him. He would not let him escape again. With a sharp cry, he exhaled several rays of golden light that shot like comets toward the base of the gate. His hands tightened, and the five-colored light in the sky vanished as he made a grasping motion.

With two sharp *clinks*, a pair of golden rays met the pink mist before it could spread. Like a gale scattering clouds, they completely neutralized it.

Fu Xia’s hands were still in a seal, his expression unchanged, but he stopped chanting.

If the Four Wrathful Demon Emperor had not fallen, he wouldn't even need his divine abilities. In terms of spellcasting alone, a hundred Konghengs would be no match for a single of his incantations. But now, Fu Xia had to admit he was powerless.

With the death of the Four Wrathful Demon Emperor, the Wrathful Path had suffered a devastating blow. While smaller, less orthodox temples still had their own independent techniques, a major temple like his, whose most powerful arts were all connected to the Maha, found their wellspring had run dry.

It wasn't that Fu Xia couldn't cast a single spell, or that he couldn't smash the radiant pass with one punch. But his dharma power was already strained. If he used it so recklessly, he might not have enough left to return to the north with Kongheng...

'Besides, the Abbot predicted that I cannot kill this Li Ximing... it would be best not to even injure him!'

The situation seemed dire, but the old monk was unconcerned. He simply sat down cross-legged in the middle of the raging Radiant Fire, formed a seal over his dantian, and said nothing more.

'Why should I even try to cast a spell to get out?'

He sat quietly within the radiant pass, allowing the five-colored Radiant Fire to scorch him and the radiant light to refine him. He withdrew all his magical radiance, becoming like a golden statue sitting motionless in the fire.

Seeing this, Li Ximing paused, instantly understanding.

'You cunning old monk!'

They had seen through Fu Xia's bluff, knowing he lacked the dharma power to break the gate. They had confidently suppressed him.

But Fu Xia had turned their plan against them, calmly taking a seat.

The reason was simple. He had the body of a Merciful One. The Radiant Fire and the radiant light, no matter how powerful or divine, were less than a nuisance to his true form. He didn't need to break the suppression; he only needed to endure it.

Li Ximing's dharma power, however, was not infinite. The longer this went on, the more of his energy would be wasted, and eventually, he would be exhausted.

Silence fell over the lake. Li Ximing's brow furrowed. He gradually reduced the power of the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner, stopping only when the radiant pass began to tremble slightly, maintaining a minimal level of suppression.

"Master," Li Ximing said in a low voice, "is there a solution?"

Kongheng saw the stalemate clearly. He sighed softly. "At least now I can speak with him as an equal. Allow me to try and persuade him."

He walked across the lake's surface, passing through the billowing steam and the intense glare of Radiant Fire and radiant light, until he stood before the Radiant Origin Pass.

Li Ximing was horrified. "Master, be careful!" he called out urgently. "The Radiant Fire and the radiant light have no eyes! Your body is precious; you cannot be in the same place as that man!"

The space beneath the Radiant Origin Pass was terrifyingly dangerous. Fu Xia was not afraid because of his Dharma Body, but an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator wouldn't last three seconds in there.

Kongheng looked back at him from a distance and smiled gently. "Do not worry, Ximing," he replied with a bow. "This is my tribulation. I have traveled thousands of miles south precisely to face it."

Li Ximing stared, dumbfounded, as Kongheng stepped into the flames. Enduring the scorching heat of the Radiant Fire and the dazzling radiant light, he made his way under the Radiant Origin Pass.

Fu Xia sat with his eyes closed, deep in meditation, not saying a word.

"Venerable senior," Kongheng said softly, "you did not tell the whole truth earlier."

Fu Xia knew he was referring to the driftwood. Sensing the hint of accusation, he answered gruffly, "I am a Dharma Protector, not a fool. Why would I tell you everything?"

"I understand." Kongheng sat down cross-legged before him, his voice gentle. "All seven paths have their selfish desires. In this age, one cannot survive without them. Kongheng has long known this. Even when the Mahas met with my master, they too had their own motives."

This statement, bordering on slander against the Mahas, made Fu Xia’s eyes fly open in anger.

A faint smile touched Kongheng’s face.

"When the Mahas visited my master back then, the sky over the Liaohe River was filled with five-colored light that night. I stood behind my master as the Mahas tried to entice me with celestial flowers falling like rain, with wondrous words and profound teachings of the golden lotus. They spoke of primeval chaos until the unfeeling stones shed tears, of delving into boundless heavenly realms to behold the ultimate essence of all things. But they did not succeed with me."

"But my five senior brothers, who came before me, were all lured away."

Kongheng's words touched upon hidden matters and mentioned the Mahas, causing the colorful clouds in the sky to churn and the golden lotuses on the lake to bloom in profusion. This finally made Fu Xia treat him with solemnity. "So what?" he asked in a low voice.

"Abbot Fuyan," Kongheng said calmly, a smile still on his face, "is my third senior brother, Kongyan."
