# Chapter 729: The Halberd's First Display of Might

Guan Gongxiao was Yehui’s personal disciple, and he cultivated the foundation his master was most proud of: Sorrowful Southern Water. He seemed more aligned with the Water Virtue than the Capital Guard. Standing in the gray, murky water, he faced the celestial light descending from above and flicked his hand through a series of seals.

"Go."

He was clearly prepared. A bronze mirror flew from his sleeve and swallowed the celestial light whole. With his other hand, he unleashed a sheet of talismans.

The talismans shimmered with white shadows, accompanied by the profound, mystical sound of chanting sutras. A gust of wind and sand then swept from Guan Gongxiao's sleeve, merging with the white shadows as it rushed forward.

Though the sandstorm appeared unremarkable, it cut through the Bright Yang celestial light with unstoppable momentum. Li Zhouwei recognized it at a glance as a technique from the Radiant Essence lineage, specifically designed to counter his own. He immediately formed a new seal.

"Celestial Art Unleashed, Yang-Li Execution Fire!"

Five different flames—ochre, pale yellow, bright gold, crimson, and vermilion—roared downward in a towering inferno, instantly suppressing the sandstorm. In the next moment, Li Zhouwei had already charged to the front lines, his halberd swinging in a wide arc.

Celestial light blazed upon Li Zhouwei's halberd, wreathed in swirling umbral shadows. The technique he cultivated was the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts, an art that used the destruction of sects and clans to temper the halberd itself. He had first gained an elementary mastery of it during his Embryonic Breathing phase when he annihilated the royal court of the Mountain Yue—a minor power composed of Qi Refining cultivators. Later, after he reached Foundation Establishment and wiped out the Dense Cloud Cave, a major power in Jiangbei, his mastery of the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts had soared.

Now, umbral shadows leaped from the weapon, filled with the phantom cries of battle. Before the halberd even arrived, the force of its swing sent the waters of the White Waterfall River churning violently. Guan Gongxiao was a pure arcanist, and his years of fighting in the Eastern Sea had taught him never to let a martial cultivator get close. He pressed two fingers to his lips and blew hard.

His breath instantly formed a solid barrier of white light. The halberd swept past, gently pushed aside by the flexible ward. Guan Gongxiao had used this spell to deal with countless cultivators and thought little of it, but a sudden chill ran down his spine. He caught a glimpse of a dark, flickering flame that had appeared on Li Zhouwei's hand.

*Clang!*

He had no time to ponder it. Li Zhouwei’s next attack was faster and fiercer, a thrust aimed directly at his face. Guan Gongxiao had no choice but to block with another spell. As he pushed the attack away, a second umbral flame ignited around Li Zhouwei. A sense of dread washed over him.

As a personal disciple of a Purple Mansion master, Guan Gongxiao had witnessed a vast array of techniques. Seeing Li Zhouwei's umbral flames, he guessed they were some kind of stacking self-enhancement spell. He knew he couldn't allow his opponent to keep building momentum.

He immediately activated his artifact. A black bell materialized behind him and chimed, then turned to project a gray screen that surged forward. Li Zhouwei countered by unleashing a torrent of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light from between his brows.

Although the black bell looked strange, it was a genuine Capital Guard artifact. Unlike the flimsy equipment of the cultivators Li Zhouwei had faced before, it didn't shatter on impact. The bell let out a mournful cry as Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light slammed into it, but it held firm.

Guan Gongxiao seized the opportunity to retreat. He took two steps back and activated his Sorrowful Southern Water immortal foundation, his body dissolving into magical water that merged with the gray torrent pouring from the Daoist scripture in his hand. He reappeared a short distance away.

Having created some distance, Guan Gongxiao began forming a new seal while covertly studying the umbral flames on his opponent. They hadn't vanished; they continued to burn brightly. He frowned.

'I don't know what kind of art this is.'

The unknown was always the most terrifying. His retreat gave Li Zhouwei an opening. With a flick of his fingers, Li Zhouwei launched a beam of solar light, which erupted outward with a torrent of Li Fire.

The Sun's Resonant Parting Art!

This technique was fluid and adaptable, with no fixed form. Li Zhouwei used it to pin his opponent down while a small banner embroidered with a crimson sparrow flew up from the red and yellow flames at his feet, diving toward the gray water.

It was the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner! Guan Gongxiao's sandstorm had just been a spell, a rootless creation. And though Li Fire held no intrinsic advantage over Radiant Essence, it was quickly worn down and the banner now flew free.

Li Zhouwei timed it perfectly. His body transformed into a streak of celestial light, and he reappeared before Guan Gongxiao, his halberd thrusting forward to smash against the gray screen with a sharp crack.

*Clang!*

Guan Gongxiao's face paled. The feedback from the black bell told him just how immense the force behind that attack was. Previously, his spells had blunted the impact, but now, taking a direct hit, his spiritual energy plummeted. A chill crept into his heart.

'That halberd of his must be an ancient artifact…'

His gaze swept across the battlefield. His side had a clear advantage. The only competent fighters on the Li Clan and Profound Peak side were Fu Yuezi with his golden axe and that scholar-like figure. The rest were collapsing like scarecrows, many of them already wounded. He felt a wave of relief.

'I just need to stall him!'

In the brief moment that thought crossed his mind, his gray screen was struck three more times. Another umbral flame ignited on Li Zhouwei's body. Unaware of the shift in his own mentality, Guan Gongxiao began casting again.

Li Zhouwei saw the state of the battlefield as well. He glanced around, then pulled his halberd back. To Guan Gongxiao's shock, he ignored him completely and turned to strike at Gongsun Bofan.

Gongsun Bofan was a skilled bladesman, but as a rogue cultivator, he was no match for Cui Jueyin, a direct disciple from Chongzhou Island. Cui Jueyin was silently weaving around him with his Eternal Brightness Steps, casting spell after spell that left Gongsun Bofan disoriented and unable to advance or retreat.

Li Zhouwei's sudden attack made the bladesman’s face drain of color. Ignoring the backlash of spiritual energy that made him cough up blood, he spun around to defend himself, only for the gleaming halberd to swerve, causing his desperate parry to meet empty air. The awkward movement threw him further off balance, and Li Zhouwei easily pulled him into his attack range.

"He intends to fight us both!"

How could Guan Gongxiao not understand? Fury rose in his heart at the sheer audacity. The spell in his hands grew faster, more vicious. Cui Jueyin, however, read the situation and wisely retreated to help the beleaguered Profound Peak cultivators.

Gongsun Bofan lacked the backing of a powerful lineage. He clashed with Li Zhouwei, his long blade meeting the halberd several times. He saw the umbral flames growing more intense and felt a sense of unease. Guan Gongxiao, still in the middle of casting, had no time to warn him and could only manage a sharp shout.

"Halt!"

A burst of crimson light shot from his mouth. A solemn expression appeared on Li Zhouwei's face. He forcefully pulled his halberd back, silently channeling the Sun's Resonant Parting Art to form a celestial screen before him.

The crimson light was incredibly sharp. It paused for a fraction of a second against the celestial screen before shattering it. As Li Zhouwei blocked the attack with his halberd, he had a sudden realization.

'This crimson light is a profound technique from the Capital Guard Dao, and he'd been charging it for a while. I cast my Sun's Resonant Parting Art in an instant… yet it was able to slow it down. It seems the Supreme Yang Dao has a slight advantage over the Capital Guard Dao!'

He had used the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner before, and he knew the Capital Guard Dao was not weak against Li Fire. Therefore, the advantage must come from the solar aspect of his power. Li Zhouwei felt a surge of delight.

'This is a major discovery!'

Li Zhouwei had always been at a disadvantage when fighting cultivators from the Capital immortals Dao. The reputation of his Bright Yang Dao was so great that any cultivator with a decent heritage knew that Radiant Essence countered it. Guan Gongxiao had come prepared with his sandstorm and likely had other tricks up his sleeve.

The Capital Guard Dao, however, was ancient and obscure. Few cultivators even knew it existed, let alone its weaknesses. Now that he knew this, he had a way to fight back, whether with artifacts or spells.

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, a dull thud echoed. The Grand Ascension Halberd was sent flying high into the air. Li Zhouwei finally spat out a mouthful of blood, but the scales of the Yuane Armor on his chest flared with a brilliant light.

The Yuane Armor had been commissioned by Li Xuanfeng, forged by the full might of the Azure Pond Sect. Its first ability was to assist Li Zhouwei in teleporting with celestial light, enhancing his footwork to a phantom-like speed. His earlier teleportation was accomplished through a combination of the Flowing Sun Refraction art and the Yuane Armor.

Its second ability was to reinforce his spiritual energy and defend against spells. Except for techniques from the Radiant Essence lineage, all other incoming arts were evenly distributed across the armor's 6,200 scales, giving him extraordinary survivability.

This armor had been instrumental in his repeated escapes from Fu Dou.

Now, even after taking a direct hit from Guan Gongxiao's spell, he was only forced to cough up a mouthful of blood. The white blood transformed into a mist in mid-air, releasing the strange fragrance of peonies. Guan Gongxiao felt a secret relief seeing him injured, but then his eyes widened as a massive, dark mountain peak materialized in the sky.

"Someone from Profound Peak has fallen!"

Li Zhouwei realized it even faster, and he knew the situation was far worse than a single death. Two of their guest elders had been gravely wounded and forced to retreat. Their forces were down to twelve, and every single one was injured. Fu Yuezi and Cui Jueyin were each desperately holding off four opponents, barely maintaining the line.

Meanwhile, not a single cultivator from the Capital immortals Dao had suffered any serious injuries.

Just then, the sky crackled with thunder and silver lightning. Li Chenghui descended, locked in battle with two other cultivators, fighting as he advanced. Cui Jueyin glanced up and finally understood why he had been so late.

"The Capital immortals Dao had an ambush waiting!"

The two cultivators Li Chenghui was fighting were direct disciples, not mere guest elders. The pressure on him was immense; it was clear he couldn't break away to help. Li Zhouwei took in the scene with a sweep of his gaze, blocked incoming attacks from Guan Gongxiao and Gongsun Bofan, and sent his Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner streaking toward Guan Lingdie.

Seeing the aggressive flames bearing down on her, Guan Lingdie let out a scornful laugh. After a moment's hesitation, she turned to the people beside her.

"You, and you. Go stop him!"

The two direct disciples at her side were reluctant to face Li Zhouwei. As they hesitated, an old man named Guan Kan moved past them, intercepting Cui Jueyin to block the banner himself. Li Zhouwei watched this and shook his head.

'The Capital immortals Dao is an Eastern Sea power. Their people are strong, but their command structure is a chaotic mess.'

Guan Kan was a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. With him joining the fight, they finally managed to pin Li Zhouwei down. He rode a current of water as he sped forward, pulling a dozen interlinked rings of cold iron from his sleeve. The old man squinted, then lightly tossed the artifact. Taking advantage of the moment Li Zhouwei was blinded by Guan Gongxiao's Radiant Essence sandstorm, he chanted in a loud, clear voice:

"Light embraces ten thousand leagues, a verdant river topples a thousand peaks. By the power of Pit Water, bind all tribulations."

His immortal foundation, Grieving River Departure, activated at full power, resonating with the iron rings in the air. Beams of watery light converged within the dozen rings, which then unleashed chains of rushing river water that snaked toward Li Zhouwei.

Li Zhouwei retreated on a beam of celestial light, but the iron rings were no ordinary artifact. The water chains they produced were incredibly fast, wrapping themselves around his weapon.

'This old man is not simple… he must be an elder in the Capital immortals Dao.'

The water chains dispersed and reformed, impossible to shake off. Empowered by the spiritual energy of a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator and his immortal foundation, they had become his most difficult problem. With his Yuane Armor and the Sun's Resonant Parting Art, Li Zhouwei wasn't overly threatened by Guan Gongxiao or Gongsun Bofan, but he feared a soft power that could counter his hard strength.

He urgently pushed his spiritual energy, recalling the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner to fight Pit Water with Li Fire. Guan Gongxiao reacted instantly, his black bell about to fly out and intercept it, when a deep shout echoed through the air.

"Descend!"

'Another artifact?'

Guan Gongxiao was stunned for a second. A brilliant light shot into the sky, revealing billowing, colorful clouds. As the clouds parted, a celestial gate descended from the heavens, its corner towers looming high. The sight was so bright it made Guan Gongxiao's eyes ache. He cursed under his breath.

"I forgot about the Li Clan's suppressive immortal foundation!"

His own Capital immortals Dao had a similar foundation, Eastern Feather Mountain. Ultimately, it was just a specialized divine ability, but such foundations were incredibly powerful during the Foundation Establishment stage, providing a significant advantage. The two white corners of the gate slammed down squarely on his black bell artifact, which he had nurtured for years. The impact was so jarring it made him spit out a mouthful of blood.

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

Li Zhouwei had achieved this through the Radiant Essence Scripture. In the past, he had thought his foundation was the Radiant Origin Pass and that it was quite different from Li Ximing's. It was only after Li Ximing reached the Purple Mansion realm that he understood the true name and power of his immortal foundation.

Li Zhouwei's figure materialized atop the celestial gate. Guan Kan's iron rings were also pinned down beneath it. The old man finally nodded, shook out his sleeves, and descended from the sky to fight with talismans instead.

Although Audience with the Celestial Gate was of an extremely high grade, it was fundamentally a suppressive foundation. Li Zhouwei's combat experience far surpassed that of the Li Ximing; he hadn't played his trump card at the start, keeping it hidden until the perfect moment.

Now, having suppressed his enemies' two most powerful artifacts in a single move, he recalled the freed Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner. Fighting under the brilliant light of the celestial gate, his own power resonating with his immortal foundation, he managed to hold his ground, though the battle remained perilous.

With Guan Kan's entry, he was now facing two late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators and one mid-stage cultivator. Both late-stage cultivators were direct disciples of their sect. In terms of opponent quality, it was a fight comparable to the one Tuoba Chongyuan had faced years ago.

However, Guan Kan was a step below the Li Xizhi of that time, while Guan Gongxiao was far stronger than Yu Wei had been, and Gongsun Bofan was leagues ahead of Quan Yi. Unfortunately, Li Zhouwei's cultivation was also a step below Tuoba Chongyuan's. While Tuoba had been able to suppress his three opponents, Li Zhouwei found himself fighting for his life, occasionally spitting out more of the white, fragrant blood.

But Foundation Establishment cultivators with true ability were not so easily killed. Those with powerful physical bodies or deep reserves of spiritual energy could fight against superior numbers for a short time. The trio could only force Li Zhouwei onto the defensive, slowly grinding him down. Yet, despite the seemingly inevitable outcome, Guan Gongxiao's brow furrowed deeper and deeper.

The reason was simple: the umbral flames surrounding Li Zhouwei were now soaring into the heavens.

"Don't meet his halberd head-on!"

Guan Gongxiao shouted sternly. Gongsun Bofan knew the warning was for him; he had been responsible for provoking half of those flames. But he was a bladesman—how else was he supposed to fight? He couldn't just let his opponent cut him down.

Gritting his teeth, he parried a few more blows, intending to fall back and let someone else take over. But Li Zhouwei pressed his attack, ignoring the other two to focus entirely on him. Finally, the umbral flames surged like a flowing river. A smile touched Li Zhouwei's blood-flecked lips. He took a light breath, and all the umbral flames streamed into his mouth and nose.

The Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts!

The unease in Guan Gongxiao's heart finally came to pass. Li Zhouwei pulled his halberd back. Then, from between lips stained with his own white blood, he exhaled the umbral energy. The moment it left his mouth, it expanded rapidly, showering the air with tiny sparks.

*BOOM!*

A dense torrent of umbral, shadowy flame erupted. Li Zhouwei turned his head, and his slightly savage eyes locked onto Guan Gongxiao, sending a chill deeper than any cold gaze ever could.

"He..."

In Guan Gongxiao's dark pupils, the reflection of Li Zhouwei's raging umbral flames danced. Two new arms, forged from the same shadowy fire, burst from Li Zhouwei's ribs, their hazy umbral light reaching for the sky.

The flames he had exhaled coalesced into two new halberds, which fell into the grasp of the shadowy arms. The arms slowly straightened, angling the halberds toward the ground. Guan Gongxiao's throat felt bone dry.

"What demonic art is this? ... Isn't his clan supposed to be on the righteous path? ... I thought *we* were the rogue cultivators from the Eastern Sea!"
