# Chapter 415: Dawn Colored Qi

In the Azure Pond Sect...

A brisk breeze swept along the quiet path as a cultivator, covered from head to toe, sped along the road. The white glow beneath his feet was a clear sign that the Divine Movement Spell was activated.

Finally back...

Li Xizhi looked weary with a furrowed brow as he navigated the path at the base of Qingsui Peak, his black robe tattered and dusty.

This assignment lasted two whole months! There are countless matters to address below the mountain... without my prior experience at home, this would have been quite the challenge.

Not every disciple of the Azure Pond Sect could focus solely on cultivation; worldly distractions often interrupted their practices.

The nature of these distractions varied—some trivial, others troublesome—and their assignment typically depended on the influence of their immortal peak within the sect.

Qingsui Peak had been in decline for years.

Under Si Yuanbai's protection, Li Chejing could cultivate in peace most of the time. Si Yuanbai's profound skills in the way of talisman and his backing in the sect shielded his disciples from menial tasks.

But now, since Yuan Tuan lacked significant influence or backing in the sect, Li Xizhi often got the shorter end of the stick. His responsibilities often required him to leave the mountain and work his fingers to the bone.

Moreover, with the arrival of more sword cultivators to the other peaks, Li Xizhi dared not reveal himself and could only lament his plight inwardly.

These swordsmen were primarily qi cultivators who liked to challenge him to duels, promising to suppress their cultivation to make it a fair fight. They had trained with the sword for a few more decades than Li Xizhi.

Putting aside their profound mastery of the sword, with the viciousness gleaming in their eyes alone, Li Xizhi knew that he was no match for them.

Fearing he might embarrass himself and Qingsui Peak, Li Xizhi always made his journeys up and down the mountain as inconspicuous as possible, wrapped tightly in his cloak to maintain a low profile and avoid trouble.

When he finally reached the platform on the summit, he took a deep breath and looked up.

The bamboo forest before him swayed in the wind, leaves fluttering down and surrounding a green deer that was as tall as a human.

Atop it sat a Daoist woman with a lovely face, who was watching him silently.

"Master!" Li Xizhi greeted her respectfully.

Yuan Tuan nodded but said nothing about his unusual attire, seemingly unsurprised.

"I've brought you the cultivation technique," she said softly.

She extended a slender arm, presenting a pale yellow jade slip. Li Xizhi accepted it eagerly, and a quick scan with his spiritual sense revealed its contents—Dawn Dew Gathering Technique.

Instant relief washed over him as Yuan Tuan continued, "This is also a Grade Four technique. While it may not rival the teachings exclusive to the immortal peaks of direct lineage, it is on par with the sect's standard cultivation technique. It's challenging to master, which deters many from practicing it... The content is only available up to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

Li Xizhi listened in silence, not questioning why his master had not chosen the superior Clear Essence Rain Control Technique.

Yuan Tuan moved her lips slightly but her whispers seemed to echo directly in his ears.

"Most of this cultivation technique's Dao Partners are lost... Only several incomplete legacies remain in Wu State, so there's no cause for concern."

Li Xizhi could not fathom the trouble Yuan Tuan had gone through to secure this cultivation technique. Moved, he began to express his gratitude.

"Master's kindness is..."

However, Yuan Tuan cut him off abruptly with a gentle voice.

"It is what I should do."

She locked eyes with him as she continued, "This cultivation technique requires you to gather Dawn Colored Qi, but it's a rather troublesome process as it requires one to ascend to the clouds and descend into deep valleys. The sect would never hand over the qi gathering technique to your family so they could help you collect it either... The only option is to purchase the spiritual qi from the sect—and at a steep price."

Li Xizhi looked up, his voice tense with unease.

"About the price..."

"A hundred and twenty Spirit Stones."

Yuan Tuan's voice was cold, tinged with a hint of vexation.

The amount shocked Li Xizhi, causing him to bow his head as a tumultuous conflict waged within him.

Yuan Tuan added, "Should your family coffers fall short, I will provide the remainder."

"Thank you, master!"

Li Xizhi kneeled and bowed deeply in respect. When he rose, Yuan Tuan had already vanished.

He wandered to his small courtyard in a daze, wordlessly lighting a lamp and spreading out a sheet of letter paper, yet he just stared at it for a long time and wrote nothing.

Under the flickering yellow lamplight that cast a golden-red glow over his face, Li Xizhi pursed his lips.

A single drop of ink fell from his brush.

Setting the brush aside, he replaced the spoiled paper with a fresh sheet, but his anxiety persisted and he began zoning out once more.

————

Li Ximing bid farewell to his family and relatives at the Li Residence and set out to return to the Xiao Residence.

Although he had yet to achieve Qi Cultivation Realm, the dharma artifact on his wrist—the Azure Manifestation—had transformed into a barking deer with vibrant green markings, playfully bounding along behind him.

Concerned for his safety in a region now teeming with devil cultivators, the Li Family refused to let Li Ximing return to the Xiao Residence alone.

Although the deer was a lot faster than Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, the journey would still take several days and was fraught with danger.

Without needing any suggestion from the clan, Li Yuanjiao decided to personally escort Li Ximing on the wind.

Winter had arrived early this year, bringing flurries of snow.

After Li Yuanjiao departed with Li Ximing, Li Yuanping assigned tasks to the other men. Just as they were also about to disperse, a streak of white light appeared in the distance, rapidly descending upon the grand formation.

"Yuan Huyuan from the Yuan Family has come to pay his respects! Please open the mountain gate!"
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝙤𝓿𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝙤𝓶

His voice, amplified by mana, echoed as Li Yuanping watched from within the mountain, momentarily startled.

Yuan Huyuan...? Why is he here?

Yuan Huyuan, a peak qi cultivator from the Yuan Family's direct lineage, held an esteemed position despite little hope of achieving Foundation Establishment Realm. He stood outside patiently, clad in dharma clothes.

With Li Yuanjiao away, Li Qinghong took charge. She rode the wind and exited the grand formation, clasping her hands together and greeting the man in a clear voice.

"Li Qinghong of the Li Family greets Senior..."

Clad in jade armor and carrying a spear on her back, her appearance was striking. Although Yuan Huyuan was nearly a century old, his eyes shone brightly with recognition.

He stroked his beard and smiled.

"Ah, so you're the thunder cultivator of your esteemed clan... I've heard much about you."

He politely reached out with his spiritual sense and quickly retracted it. A look of surprise appeared on his face.

"To think you've reached the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm already! And at such a young age—barely thirty! That's..."

Li Qinghong, uninterested in prolonging the discussion about her accomplishments, which she assumed he mentioned out of courtesy, offered a polite smile.

"What brings you here, Senior...?" she asked politely.

"Ah."

Regaining his composure, Yuan Huyuan retrieved a sealed letter from his sleeve, despite the lingering look of disbelief on his face.

"My family received a few letters, one of them was from Xizhi, so I came to deliver it," he explained.

Given Yuan Huyuan's stature, Li Qinghong surmised that there must be a significant reason for his personal visit. He must have something important that could not be discussed outside the formation. She accepted the letter and swiftly stowed it in her sleeve pocket.

"Please come in and have a seat, Senior," she invited with a smile.

"Sure!"

Yuan Huyuan accepted the offer immediately, and the two flew into the formation together. Below them, Li Yuanping had already tidied the hall. By the time they stepped inside, even the spirit tea had been prepared readily.

Yuan Huyuan exchanged a few pleasantries with Li Qinghong before smoothly transitioning to the main topic.

"How is Senior Tongya these days?" he asked softly.

Yuan Huyuan's initial visit to the Li Family was to escort Li Chejing home. At that time, his cultivation had already reached the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, while Li Tongya was merely a humble Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. Now that he was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Yuan Huyuan had to address him as senior with due respect.

Li Qinghong chuckled and replied, "I'm sorry that his absence disappoints you, Senior. You've come at the wrong time, and our ancestor is currently cultivating in seclusion."

"Ah..."

Yuan Huyuan gave her a look but did not dwell on the subject. Instead, he changed the topic.

"Your family's Xizhi has been cultivating at Qingsui Peak and has become quite formidable, now at the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. I've come on behalf of Ancestor Yuan Tuan to ask this as both of us are Xi Zhi's elders—with the child close to advancing to Qi Cultivation Realm, does your family have any plans for him?"

Li Qinghong feigned surprise before responding without hesitation.

"The cultivation techniques available in the sect are certainly superior to those of my humble clan... We shall let your family ancestor decide."

"Haha," Yuan Huyuan chuckled dryly and replied, "Our ancestor, of course, wants the best for Xizhi. The Grade Four Clear Essence Rain Control Technique is naturally a good choice, but she is thinking of trying out a Grade Five technique..."

"Among the Azure Pond legacies, the Grade Five Dark Floating Compliant Cloud Sutra is exclusive to the Chi Family's direct lineage, and the Heavenly Pronouncement Sutra is a secret that we guard closely..."

Yuan Huyuan shared several points before pausing. He chuckled and then continued, "There are many ancient techniques available though. I wonder how your esteemed family views them..."

Li Qinghong sipped her tea and eyed Yuan Huyuan, who nearly had the Supreme Yin Moonlight written across his forehead. With a resigned thought, she mused, Does he think I'm gullible? This is all too obvious!

A soft chuckle escaped her vermilion lips and she replied, "The Li Family is of humble background, we put our faith in the Old Ancestor."

"Very well... You're an understanding person, young lady."

Yuan Huyuan nodded, despite being secretly surprised. He was a seasoned cultivator now over a century old, and usually treated people with generosity and kindness. His venerable status also carried considerable influence across various families.

Had it not been for the Ancestor Yuan Licheng's greedy scheming, Yuan Huyuan would never have stooped to such measures. With a sigh of relief, he smiled and said, "I have some good news to share with you, young lady."

Li Qinghong gestured for him to continue and Yuan Huyuan announced, "Fellow Daoist Li Xuanfeng from your esteemed clan has successfully established his immortal foundation, Engraved Stone, in Yi Mountain City!"

"What! Uncle Xuanfeng has achieved Foundation Establishment Realm?!" Li Qinghong exclaimed, her face lighting up with a genuine smile.

"Many thanks for this joyful news, Senior Yuan!"

Yuan Huyuan nodded, his face beaming as he replied, "Congratulations! Your family now boasts three generations of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators—truly the mark of a prestigious clan!"

Although the inclusion of Li Mutian in his statement stretched the truth somewhat, it was meant as a felicitous remark. Li Qinghong smiled and thanked him, then heard the rustling sound of falling snow as a man dressed in a black robe entered the hall.

Li Yuanjiao had just returned from escorting Li Ximing. Along the way, he encountered and defeated a devil cultivator. He was merely at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, far below his own capabilities. With a decisive palm strike, Li Yuanjiao ended the confrontation almost instantly and seized the cultivator's storage pouch easily.

Shaking the snow from his cloak, he tossed the blood-stained pouch onto the desk, exhaling warm breaths into the cold air. Glancing at Yuan Huyuan, he asked, "And you are...?"

"Yuan Huyuan from the Yuan Family," the man replied. After Li Qinghong explained the situation to Li Yuanjiao, he smiled at the man and said, "Greetings, Senior."

Li Yuanjiao was not surprised by the news, having already anticipated it.

Yuan Huyuan added, "Furthermore, Senior Xuanfeng has been promoted by Daoist Master Yuan Su and serves as a general in Yishan City... He could be considered a distinguished member of the Azure Pond Sect now."

The siblings exchanged a glance with each other. Given their family's unpleasant history with the Azure Pond Sect in the past, they had already lost their trust in those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators long ago. They could only muster a strained smile, bracing for potential complications.

Yuan Huyuan then mysteriously remarked, "Daoist Master Yuan Su has always been a loner and kept his distance from the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators within the sect. He has neither immortal peaks nor prestigious clans under his command. Your family could seize this opportunity..."

Seeing the thoughtful looks on the siblings' faces, Yuan Huyuan laughed heartily and cupped his fist.

"Well... I've delivered the message. I shall take my leave now!"

After the siblings had escorted Yuan Huyuan out of the formation, they returned to the hall, still puzzled.

Li Yuanjiao then mused, "I heard that Daoist Master Yuan Su's immortal foundation is Spring's Echo, which has completely nothing to do with Engraved Stone... This immortal foundation is probably only valuable in the Golden Tang Gate..."

A thought suddenly struck Li Qinghong as she remarked, "Spring's Echo? Our family has a cultivation technique related to that—Uncle Xuan's Cave Spring Clear Spirit Technique, though it's merely Grade Three and can only be cultivated to the Foundation Establishment Realm. If it's from the Azure Pond Sect, even the technique to form this immortal dao will surely surpass Grade Three."

Realizing their speculation led nowhere, they finally gave up in resignation. Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao pulled out a green-colored jade bottle from a storage pouch.

"Take a look at this," he said with a grin.

His journey to the Xiao Family involved more than just escorting his nephew.

Back then, Li Xuanxuan had unknowingly acquired a spirit water of heaven and earth from a devil cultivator's storage pouch in the marketplace. For a long time, they had not been able to identify it. So, Li Yuanjiao had taken the opportunity to consult Xiao Yuansi himself.

Xiao Yuansi, well-versed and insightful, quickly referenced several books before determining the substance's nature.

Seeing Li Qinghong's baffled expression, Li Yuanjiao explained, "This spirit water of heaven and earth is comparable to a treasured panacea. Named Earth Fiend's Cold Spring, it could quench fire poison, replenish baleful qi, and harmonize with numerous techniques—truly valuable spirit water!"

"Comparable to a treasured panacea..?" Li Qinghong repeated, tightening her grip on the bottle.

A Treasured panacea was far more significant than mere spirit items of the Foundation Establishment Realm. While items like Wanglin Blossom qualified as a spirit item of the Foundation Establishment Realm, they could not be called treasured panacea.

The distinction was profound—Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items benefited only cultivators in that realm, whereas the treasured panacea possessed miraculous properties that even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators coveted.

The two siblings put away the spirit water of heaven and earth and took out Li Xizhi's letter, carefully reading it.

After a moment, Li Yuanjiao silently put the letter away. Li Qinghong stood up, holding her spear. Having scanned the letter with her spiritual sense and read its contents, she clenched her jaw and said gloomily, "A hundred and twenty Spirit Stones? Are they crazy?! What kind of spiritual qi of heaven and earth costs that much? It's extortion!"

Although that was what she said, Li Qinghong looked at her silent elder brother, unsure of his thoughts. She then asked tentatively, "Are we still amassing the funds for Zhi'er?"

Li Yuanjiao put the letter away gently, then gritted his teeth. He raised his eyebrows, looking somber as he replied, "Yes... Even if it means selling off all the spirit items in our treasury."

He paused and then asked in a deep voice, "How many Spirit Stones do we have in our family's savings?"

Li Yuanping, who was nearby, stepped forward and replied, "More than eighty."

As soon as Li Yuanping answered his question, he quickly added, "It's almost time to pay our tributes though, Big Brother! After we gave Qingxiao a sum of Spirit Stones, we're already struggling... We can't afford to spend these savings!"
