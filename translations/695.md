# Chapter 695: The White Qilin's Gift

Li Ximing knew that the cultivators of Floating Cloud Cave were terrified and desperate to serve him. His clan had a sterling reputation, after all. He was reminded of Fei Luoya from Mount Wu, who had lingered by the lake for decades, hoping for a chance to serve a Purple Mansion cultivator. It was the same principle at play now.

But just because they wanted to pledge fealty didn't mean Li Ximing was inclined to accept. Taking in cultivators of unknown origin without a Life Divine Ability to see through them was asking for trouble; it would almost certainly lead to disaster down the line.

He didn't want the men, but the land they occupied in Jiangbei was prime territory. "What is the status of Floating Cloud Cave's territory?" he asked.

Pingwang Zi hurriedly replied, "It has all been seized and secured, awaiting your command, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing sipped his tea in silence.

In truth, he had heard of Mount Xiaoshi long ago. The Li clan had secret records mentioning it, records that predated the establishment of the three sects. During the great war in Jiangbei, a master monk of the Way of Emptiness had arrived on the wind and landed on Mount Xiaoshi, causing the various Dao lineages there to scatter in terror. One of them, a Daoist Fuyuan, had fled all the way to the lake.

The Daoist had been grievously injured by the master monk and died shortly after. But in his dying pleas, he had revealed a great deal of information, which Li Xuanxuan had later recounted to Li Ximing in detail.

A cultivator from Floating Cloud Cave on Mount Xiaoshi had once come to the lake's shore and been slain by Lord Xiangping, who wielded a powerful mirror. From the man’s body, they had recovered a jade pendant. That very pendant was a component needed to repair the Immortal Mirror—a piece of the same quality as the one Yu Muxian had once possessed.

It was because of this component that Li Ximing was so fixated on the name Mount Xiaoshi, and it was why he had personally summoned the two cave masters for questioning.

'What a coincidence,' he thought, 'that the White Ye Immortal Sect, the Chengyun Gate, and the Golden Tang Gate all chose cultivators from Mount Xiaoshi as their proxies in Jiangbei. Surely that isn't by chance.'

Li Ximing was already deeply suspicious of Mount Xiaoshi. The fact that all three Secret Diffusion sects hailed from its Dao lineages only confirmed his belief that something was amiss.

'Finding the other components would be ideal, but even a clue would be a start. Besides, several Purple Mansion cultivators are playing this game in Jiangbei with pieces from Mount Xiaoshi. There must be something valuable at stake.'

'And even if none of that were true, Floating Cloud Cave is located right across the river from the northern shore of Moongaze Lake. It's practically on my doorstep. I cannot allow another power to remain there.'

He took a sip of tea, waved his hand, and said, "Very well. We'll leave this matter for now."

The two men departed as if they had received a royal pardon. Li Ximing hesitated for a moment in the hall, then drew a jade slip from his sleeve. In a small corner, the words *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light* were carved.

He rubbed the jade slip for a moment, his brow slowly furrowing.

'Zhouwei is still in Jiangbei... I hope nothing's happened to him. This isn't the time to be studying cultivation arts. I need to make a trip to Jiangbei first.'

***

Meanwhile, the two Daoists left the hall and flew out of Moongaze Lake toward their own territories, both feeling as if they had been given a new lease on life. Pingwang Zi was relieved, but Daoist Wenhu felt as if a mountain had been lifted from his shoulders, and he was overcome with emotion.

Although both were pawns of Purple Mansion powers, they had run afoul of Li Ximing. If he had killed them, it would have been justified. Their backers might have been displeased and lost face, but they couldn't have raised any real objections.

Pingwang Zi spoke softly, his voice laced with meaning, "Whether this is a big deal or a small one is entirely up to the Daoist Master's whim. He said he's leaving the matter for *now*... but he didn't say he's dropping it forever. You'd best be careful from now on, elder brother."

Pingwang Zi could say this because the Chengyun Gate behind him had some prior dealings with the Li clan. The same couldn't be said for the White Ye Immortal Sect. It was hard to say what their Daoist Master thought, and Daoist Wenhu's path forward looked treacherous.

Daoist Wenhu clearly understood this. The joy vanished from his face, replaced by a look of confusion. He replied in a low voice, "I can't afford to offend either side. It's like walking a tightrope. I'm caught in the middle, and it's not something I can control."

Pingwang Zi, thoroughly enjoying the drama, found Wenhu's predicament amusing. He cut to the heart of the matter. "Are you tired of living? A bird seeks a forest, a man seeks a master. You don't have the luxury of playing both sides."

Daoist Wenhu was speechless. If he had to compare them, the master of the White Ye Immortal Sect was far more difficult to deal with. Li Ximing, on the other hand, had just reached the Purple Mansion Realm and seemed to conduct himself with more righteousness. He didn't yet view Foundation Establishment cultivators as mere blades of grass. Wenhu sighed with a hint of resignation.

"Sigh... Just you wait. Only when you've truly offended someone of their stature will you understand what it's like."

He saw they were approaching his territory and fell silent, letting out another sigh, which greatly pleased Pingwang Zi.

***

In Jiangbei.

Night had fallen over the territory of Floating Cloud Cave. A shadow flitted through the mountain forest. Shrouded by overlapping layers of cloud-like gauze, an old man with a goatee flew close to the ground, glancing around cautiously.

"Li Ximing... a Purple Mansion cultivator... It's preposterous!"

A look of disbelief was still etched on his face. But the facts were the facts: the master of Floating Cloud Cave was dead. The man, Situ Ku, had relied on a magical artifact to sneak away, and he didn't dare take a single unnecessary step.

Floating Cloud Cave had close ties with the Golden Tang Gate. Its master, Fudou, had been backed by them, and Situ Ku was naturally stationed there as the Golden Tang Gate's representative. Now, his face was a mask of bitterness.

'At least I never showed my face...'

Situ Ku knew that Wenhu and Pingwang Zi wouldn't want to offend the Golden Tang Gate, so they wouldn't go out of their way to hunt him down. Their best course of action was to pretend they hadn't seen him, which was how he had managed to escape.

'A pity... I doubt I'll get such a lucrative assignment again.'

Situ Ku traveled for a while before emerging from the woods. Before his eyes could even focus, his spiritual sense flared. He detected a young man in white and gold armor sitting beneath a pine tree on a distant mountaintop.

From a distance, the young man sat cross-legged with his eyes closed. A great halberd with a bright gold, crescent-shaped blade was planted in the ground beside him. His hands rested on his knees in a meditative seal, perfectly still.

Situ Ku froze. The young man's eyes snapped open. Golden pupils pierced the darkness, locking onto Situ Ku. The uniquely shaped halberd beside him began to vibrate softly.

"Senior Situ, I have been waiting for you."

A chill shot through Situ Ku's heart, and his mind reeled.

'Li Zhouwei! Wasn't he supposed to be in the Eastern Sea fighting demons?!'

The next moment, the great halberd swept toward him. Before its brilliant light even reached him, Situ Ku broke out in a cold sweat. Terrified, he activated several talismans on his chest, conjuring a tortoise shell shield in front of him and spitting a mouthful of blood essence onto it.

*Pfft!*

*BOOM.*

But Li Zhouwei's halberd slammed into the ground in front of him, sending stone chips flying. The tortoise shell missed its mark. Situ Ku saw that Li Zhouwei was now forming a seal, a wisp of Radiant Fire dancing in his hand.

'Sun's Resonant Radiance Art!'

The only sixth-grade art in the Li clan's possession was the Great Radiance of White Brilliance, but it required a Purple Mansion-level spiritual fire to cultivate, which the clan lacked. Therefore, Li Zhouwei had cultivated the fifth-grade Sun's Resonant Radiance Art instead. The art was powerful and, more importantly, versatile. A fifth-grade art was considered a trump card even for the direct lineage of the Azure Pond Sect. Li Zhouwei had cultivated it for over a decade and had relied on it to escape dangerous situations many times.

In an instant, a brilliant white light rose before him, rippling like water before shifting to an apricot hue. The tortoise shell was knocked aside and trapped, struggling within the raging flames.

*Bang!*

Li Zhouwei's hand pressed against the protective barrier of light from the talismans. The entire barrier immediately burst into Radiant Fire. The scorching flames seared Situ Ku's vision. He broke out in another cold sweat, having just finished forming a seal for his own art.

*BOOM!*

Situ Ku knew exactly who he was facing. When Li Zhouwei had just reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, protected by his treasure armor, even Daoist Fudou himself had only managed to injure him before he escaped. Situ Ku's cultivation level was similar to this Li clan's White Qilin, but he was inferior in every way—arts, techniques, and artifacts. What was the point of fighting?

He made a split-second decision. The black, mist-like gauze artifact exploded, shattering with a deafening roar. A thick gray light erupted as the power of the Xiukui lineage surged, forming a massive mountain of shadow that came crashing down.

Situ Ku knew he only had one chance to escape. He poured out all his spiritual qi, mixed with his own blood essence, igniting a powerful flame beneath his feet that launched him into the sky like a bird, speeding away.

Li Zhouwei remained silent. He swung his inverted halberd, and from the crescent blade, streams of illusory Bright Yang light shot out, slowing the descent of the shadow mountain. Then, a small banner flew from his sleeve.

The Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner.

"By the Heavenly Form, I invoke the Yang-Li flame of judgment!"

Five colors of Radiant Fire—ochre, pale yellow, goose yellow, bright red, and vermilion—leapt up to hold back the black mountain. The halberd thrust forward again, like a pillar supporting the heavens, propping up the massive shadow.

But this power came from a self-destructed artifact. Situ Ku had already fled a full li. A chase would invite unforeseen complications. Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes, calculated the distance, and chanted coldly, "Light illuminates the eight directions! All kings bow before me! Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light... Manifest!"

A point of bright light emerged from between his eyebrows. The entire forest flashed brilliantly, illuminating everything before plunging back into darkness. In the distance, caught in the heavenly light, Situ Ku fell from the sky like a bird with a broken wing.

The old man, focused solely on fleeing, had offered no resistance. His lower body had been pierced through. The searing heavenly light pulsed in his wound, then rippled outward, transforming into two soldiers in silver scale armor. The faceless soldiers each took one of his arms and flew back with him.

In no more than ten moves, the nearly dead Situ Ku was dragged before him. The mountain-sized black light had been burned down to the size of a writing desk.

Of course, the old man's single-minded focus on escape played a part, as did the power of Li Zhouwei's arts and artifacts. Still, it was a testament to his strength, which now rivaled that of Tuoba Chongyuan in his prime.

After staunching Situ Ku's bleeding, Li Zhouwei sensed something and his eyes narrowed sharply.

'A Purple Mansion cultivator?'

The Great Void rippled before him, revealing a man in a white and gold Daoist robe. He was beaming, his voice filled with pleasant surprise.

"My dear White Qilin is truly formidable!"

Seeing it was Li Ximing, Li Zhouwei let out a breath of relief. He clasped his fist in salute and laughed heartily. "Greetings, Daoist Master! Since you have made your breakthrough, I couldn't possibly return empty-handed. So... I've captured a man from the Golden Tang Gate as a congratulatory gift."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing gave him a look full of praise. Only then did he realize the man on the ground was from the Situ family. Li Zhouwei's eyes flickered as he said in a low voice, "This is Situ Ku, also an elder of Floating Cloud Cave. Wenhu and Pingwang Zi let him escape. I was half a day late, so I've been waiting for him."

Li Ximing understood immediately. His gaze on the captive grew intense. This wasn't just a guest elder; he was valuable leverage. He smiled. "A fine... a fine gift indeed!"

He flicked his finger, and a beam of bright light shot out to bind Situ Ku. Then he took Li Zhouwei's hand, looking him over, and sighed with feeling. "I've reached the Purple Mansion Realm, and you are safe and sound. Nothing is more important than this."

Li Minggong and the others hadn't gone into detail, but Li Ximing knew how difficult the past decade had been for Li Zhouwei, navigating the four territories. He had likely needed a great deal of help, and now he was forced to fake a trip to the Eastern Sea just to return in secret.

Li Zhouwei just smiled. Li Ximing glanced at the sky, then pulled him into the Great Void, and they vanished. A dozen breaths later, the sky rapidly brightened.

***

An Siwei escorted the two cave masters into the hall and returned quickly to find a young man wandering around. Li Minggong stood to the side. The spiritual items that had been on the table were gone.

An Siwei bowed his head and clasped his hands respectfully. "Second Young Master!"

"Lord An..."

The young man had a clean-cut appearance and was dressed smartly. He was otherwise unremarkable, save for the golden eyes that met An Siwei's gaze. He smiled as he responded. This was Li Jianglong, Li Zhouwei's third son.

The four brothers born after Li Jianglong were not named according to the traditions of the Li clan's Second Branch. No one dared to ask why, and no one mentioned it. Li Jianglong was now eighteen or nineteen, but his cultivation was not as advanced as his older brother's; he was still only at the Qi Refining stage.

He blinked slightly and smiled. "I heard from Lord An what happened. With such wonderful news, when will Father return?"

"It should be very soon," Li Minggong replied.

Li Jianglong shook his head and said, "That Daoist Wenhu really doesn't know how to give a gift. He's probably never been so aggrieved. The item was a medicinal herb that looked like it had been stored for a long time. It was mixed in with the other confiscated spiritual items and sent to the clan's treasury."

An Siwei nodded. "I understand."

Li Minggong watched Li Jianglong with a smile. The young man bid them both farewell, saying he was going to the edge of the island to welcome his father, and left quickly, full of joy. Li Minggong chuckled.

"He means well. Uncle An rejected Wenhu's gift, but then I kept it here. Now that it's gone, he was afraid you would think I secretly accepted a bribe, so he made a point of clarifying."

An Siwei understood, of course, and his expression was one of approval. He said in a deep voice, "The Second Young Master is magnanimous and astute. He is a blessing to our clan."

'It's not just Jianglong,' Li Minggong thought, then said aloud, "Jianglong and Jiangxia are older and are already showing great promise. Jiangliang is a few years younger, and I've met him as well. They each have their own unique qualities..."

"All of the Radiant Splendor generation are talented," she continued. "If they had been born in my Chengming generation, the conflict between north and south would surely have gone much better. That would have been a great thing."

A bitter expression crossed her face, and she lowered her eyes gracefully, careful not to be impolite in front of her elder. An Siwei was getting on in years and didn't dare discuss such topics with her. He just clasped his hands and said, "I'll go and prepare the reception for the other Purple Mansion cultivators. I asked the clan elders, and they said holding it on the island is inappropriate. The current plan is to hold it in the Helin Mountains, where the terrain is most open and the spiritual qi is most balanced."

Li Minggong was familiar with the clan's affairs and understood immediately. She nodded. "This is a good opportunity to renovate the old Helin Mountains. And since the matter with Mount Xiaoshi and the Secret Diffusion sects is settled, I don't need to go back. I can stay and help with the festivities."

An Siwei nodded. They went outside together. The Helin Mountains by the lake were already being decorated with countless golden floating murals. Cultivators flew to and fro, and the air was filled with joyous celebration.
