# Chapter 818: White Dew Blood

Li Zhouwei stared opposite the red-eyed Dragon King, a peak Purple Mansion cultivator who possessed five complete Divine Abilities. Dongfang Lieyun’s ferocious aura seemed to overflow. As his emotions shifted, the entire crystal palace trembled slightly, letting out a low hum.

He had spoken quickly and at length, stacking one deduction and calculation upon another. The interrogation was imminent. Li Zhouwei barely had time for a lightning-fast review of the situation before he answered:

"Since Your Majesty believes I am the result of Mount Luoxia influencing the bestowal of the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment, and the Great Ancestor is already so weakened... even if I were to die suddenly, would they not simply bestow a second attainment? If Mount Luoxia placed that second chance within their own mountain, wouldn't killing me be nothing more than drinking poison to quench their thirst?"

"Furthermore, ignorance was one thing, but now that Senior has revealed these secrets to me, is seeking that Fruition Attainment... truly something this junior should attempt? Failure to achieve the Fruition Attainment means death. But if I succeed, could Mount Luoxia bear to watch a Fruition Attainment they plotted over for a thousand years fall into the hands of a Li Qianyuan descendant? The Bright Yang lineage values hierarchy and orthodoxy above all. If this junior becomes a True Monarch, how could this Fruition Attainment possibly satisfy Mount Luoxia’s ambitions?"

Dongfang Lieyun had yet to reply. Li Zhouwei maintained his calm expression and continued, "This junior knows nothing of destiny’s calculations. I only know that as a White Qilin—even if I truly was born of Mount Luoxia's influence—cooperating with the dragon lineage to protect the Great Ancestor’s position is the only logical path. No matter how powerful Mount Luoxia is, they ultimately have no place for me. If Your Majesty truly intended to kill me, there would be no need for this long discussion. You merely wished me to understand the stakes."

For the dragon lineage, the worst possible outcome was Li Zhouwei failing to achieve the Fruition Attainment, which would mean all their efforts had been for nothing. Conversely, Mount Luoxia was the one who *most* desired Li Zhouwei to make the attempt... Dongfang Lieyun’s expression remained grim, his deep voice resounding:

"Once the Dao path is severed, how could a White Qilin accept it? Will you not also perish when your lifespan ends? Any ambitious cultivator would rather test the Bright Yang against Mount Luoxia. If you maneuver against them and actually succeed in becoming a True Monarch, the wonders of such divine abilities are profound. Might there not be a way to reconcile? Even if you perish, you gain infinite chances at rebirth. That is far better than dying as a Purple Mansion cultivator."

Li Zhouwei did not back down. "If I become a True Monarch and then perish, I will surely be suppressed by Mount Luoxia for eternity, never to see the light of day. As a Purple Mansion cultivator, I still have the option of seeking Intercalary or Auxiliary Positions. At worst, if the dragon lineage grants me a measure of Metallic Essence, I can reincarnate and escape this cage entirely."

Li Zhouwei had made the outrageous demand of exchanging for Metallic Essence, yet Dongfang Lieyun showed no surprise. Standing far off at the front of the hall, the demon ignored the mention of the auxiliary positions and spoke in a quieter voice:

"If you reincarnate and cultivate another path, you may never again touch the realm of Five Divine Abilities."

Li Zhouwei fell silent for a moment. The demon took a step forward, the vicious light in his eyes having faded significantly. He finally took the initiative again:

"Whether you are Mount Luoxia’s gambit or not, I have no reason to kill you. I brought you here this time to clarify the situation... Although Mount Luoxia will certainly seek you out once you break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, the true ownership of the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment is not something you alone can decide."

"By the time you reach the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, the Great Ancestor’s condition will remain unknown. Whether you intend to seek an auxiliary position, an intercalary one, or—left with no other choice—reincarnate, will all depend on the situation at that time."

Li Zhouwei silently exhaled in relief. He bowed and replied, "The Great Ancestor was harmed by Mount Luoxia. The dragon lineage has been an ally for a millennium. Zhouwei can still distinguish right from wrong."

The Beihai Dragon King did not answer him, instead walking step-by-step up to the highest jade platform. His already massive body cast immense shadows. Standing at the edge of the dais, he looked up and said softly, "I must collect this [White Qilin Blood]. First, I have my own use for it. Second, it serves as an excuse to deal with Xiang Chun. But rest assured, you will not suffer a loss in this matter. I will have someone bring you spiritual items..."

Li Zhouwei looked up. He knew this trial was unavoidable, but he still had an unconfirmed suspicion. Sensing the Dragon King was currently amenable, he seized the chance to ask, "There is one thing I am unsure if I should ask... Among the dragon lineage... which one has such close ties to my Wei Li clan that they would intervene to save me?"

Dongfang Lieyun glanced at him. "That is a long story... It has much to do with Daoist Master Zipei from years past, and it is not convenient for me to speak of it here. If you are interested in investigating, continue heading east. Past the Crimson Reef Island region, there is a sea to the north called the Lie Sea. Go there and ask yourself."

The Dragon King's expression darkened slightly. "That dog Changxiao, however, is sharp. He sensed something was amiss. Whether he intended to or not, he understood he had become Mount Luoxia’s pawn, and now he’s hiding... I wonder who he is colluding with in the shadows..."

Li Zhouwei understood the implications of this. He bowed. "Many thanks to the dragon lineage for intervening!"

Dongfang Lieyun gave a slight wave of his hand. Wind and clouds surged through the crystal palace. Tides of white vapor poured in from outside, swiftly climbing the jade-green steps until they swirled past their calves.

Dongfang Lieyun and Li Zhouwei stood together within this white vapor, as if atop the highest peaks of the sky. The surrounding crystalline, emerald scenery was completely obscured, leaving only an endless white expanse and the nearby jade platform.

The vapor instantly coalesced, condensing beside them into the form of a young man. He was dressed in immaculate white robes, his hair neatly combed. His face was slightly round, his eyebrows short and delicate, and his eyes pure black. He offered a classic, elegant bow:

"Dongfang Heyun greets Your Majesty."

The Dragon King shifted his red eyes. "I have told you several times, there is no need for such courtesy. You are now master of your own divine abilities. If you continue this way, I will be the one who feels awkward."

Dongfang Heyun smiled slightly, but his bowed back did not straighten. "Proper etiquette must be observed. This is something I learned from the human clans in ancient times, and I have benefited from it ever since. I cannot simply discard it just because my strength has increased and I have learned a few divine abilities..."

The demon was very polite to him and didn't argue, merely nodding. Dongfang Heyun then turned his gaze to Li Zhouwei, nodded slightly, and smiled. "So the White Qilin is here. It truly has been a long time... I wanted to visit Daoist Friend Xizhi several times, but he is always in the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, and it is inconvenient for me to see him there."

Logically, the dragon lineage had no fear of the Azure Pond Sect. There were few places in the Eastern Sea or Southern Sea that a dragon could not go. At the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, the most he might encounter was Si Boxiu, and to put it bluntly, Dongfang Heyun really didn't need to give Daoist Master Yuanxiu much face.

Yet Dongfang Heyun said it was "inconvenient," making it unclear if he was just being polite or if there was something preventing him from entering the Shitang. Li Zhouwei bowed, offering a casual courtesy: "My clan elder has also mentioned Senior’s grace and holds you in high esteem. If Senior wishes to meet, you need only send word, and we will naturally select a place to host you."

Dongfang Heyun smiled and nodded politely. High above, the Beihai Dragon King gestured. The white-robed young man retrieved a dark gold box from his sleeve, adorned with the subtle etching of a rampant qilin.

Dongfang Heyun gently stroked the box, seemingly chanting an incantation. The dark gold box popped open automatically. Inside, nestled on folded black silk, sat a round porcelain dish the size of a pastry, filled with a shimmering, golden-white liquid.

The moment this golden-white spiritual item appeared, it was as if a sun of the same color had risen in the clouds. The light was dazzling; ten thousand rays of dawn burst through the vapor, illuminating the entire white domain.

Dongfang Heyun extended a hand, and a fierce wind instantly gathered the clouds from all directions, forcing all the nascent sunlight back into the box. Only then did the surrounding scenery return to normal. He smiled.

"This item is surely familiar to you, Daoist Friend. It is called [White Du Blood]. In ancient times, it was known as the [Shuyang Victorious Qilin Light]. The beast of the Bright Yang is the [Shuyang]. The Shuyang's eldest son was called [Shengming]—that is, the very first White Qilin. During a solar eclipse, the light that falls from the White Qilin becomes [White Du Blood]."

The Li family was indeed familiar with the name [White Du Blood]. Years ago, when Li Ximing was preparing to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, this was one of the Bright Yang spiritual items on his list. No wonder they had never found a trace of it; if the White Qilin was extinct, how could [White Du Blood] exist? Although there was often more than one way to condense a spiritual item, this one was almost certainly tied to the White Qilin.

But Li Zhouwei had a more pressing concern. He looked up, seizing the chance. "You all refer to me as a White Qilin. How do I differ from [Shengming]?"

Dongfang Heyun chuckled. "You possess the destiny of a White Qilin, and that destiny is abundant—so rich it is as if you are the reincarnation of the White Qilin itself. However, you lack the *essence* of the White Qilin. That is why you cultivated the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao, to complete that essence. Once you break through the Golden Core, you will be no different from the Victorious Qilin... When that time comes, during an eclipse, the [Shuyang Victorious Qilin Light] will fall from you as well."

"It is only because you already possessed such a complete White Qilin destiny that the Life Divine Ability of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao came so naturally to you... If you had entered the Buddhist Dao, you would have instantly attained a position. The Undefeated King of Brightness was just like that."

This was rare information. Li Zhouwei quickly asked, "Is the Life Divine Ability the same as destiny?"

Dongfang Heyun patiently explained: "The Life Divine Ability is still a divine ability. Possessing the destiny makes cultivating the Life Divine Ability easy, but the Life Divine Ability cannot create destiny. Once one ascends to a Fruition Attainment, it will naturally be conferred upon cultivators of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao. The Metallic Essence is not the point; the *position* is the key. It is only rumored that the great cultivators of antiquity—figures at the Immortal Lord level—could rely on Metallic Essence to birth destiny."

Li Zhouwei was extremely sharp. Hearing this, he immediately understood. 'It seems the key to everything is attaining the Fruition Attainment. Seeking destiny through essence... is perhaps truly seeking the Fruition Attainment through essence, and then gaining destiny via the Fruition Attainment. Thus, completing both...'

Since the Beihai Dragon King was still waiting above, he said no more. Dongfang Heyun continued, "Preparation prevents calamity. We are taking this measure of [White Qilin Blood] from you not just because Lady Xiang Chun requires it, but because His Majesty must also inspect it. We are primarily examining the bloodline; we do not need this item for its spiritual properties. Doing this *before* the Purple Mansion Realm is an act that damages your foundation, but if we waited until *after* the Purple Mansion, the damage would be extremely difficult to remedy."

Dongfang Heyun maintained his amicable attitude and offered the explanation. Li Zhouwei finally understood.

'So that's how it is! They are truly cautious. Even now, they still need to inspect my bloodline... Xiang Chun needing the spiritual item is just a pretext. The dragon lineage is extracting it themselves, verifying that I am truly the White Qilin of the Wei Li clan, and then casually gifting it to Xiang Chun. The intermediate process is what matters most!'

Dongfang Heyun brought the small, pastry-sized porcelain dish over. "With this [White Du Blood], you only need to refine it. When I extract your essence blood from the outside, it will not harm your foundation; it may even consolidate and deepen your cultivation."

The young man was, as ever, courteous, even making a small joke. "Of course you cannot use this much. Just a drop on your glabella is more than enough. If you had waited until after the Purple Mansion Realm, you would have needed the entire portion."

He seemed hesitant to touch the spiritual item directly, merely offering it forward. Li Zhouwei extended his index finger and touched it. His fingertip grew intensely hot. When he brushed it against his glabella, no liquid remained on his hand, but a surging radiance emerged from the spot between his brows.

Li Zhouwei sat cross-legged on the jade platform. Dongfang Heyun formed seals nearby, seemingly examining something, as dots of golden liquid quickly gathered at the tip of his other hand.

The Beihai Dragon King observed from his high seat with lowered eyes. Time passed. Dongfang Heyun retracted his hand, now holding a golden bead of liquid the size of a fingernail.

Li Zhouwei remained seated with his eyes shut tight, his face pale. The Profound Light from his glabella enveloped his entire body, rapidly replenishing his vital energy. This was clearly not a process that would end quickly. Dongfang Heyun raised his hand, and the sea of clouds swiftly surged to cover him, isolating and protecting him.

He hurried up the platform, offering the golden bead with both hands. "Your Majesty, please inspect it."

Dongfang Lieyun, on the main seat, gently took the bead and examined it in his palm. After a long moment, the red-eyed Dragon King said in a low voice, "Although this is not a detailed inspection... it is, at the very least, of the orthodox Bright Yang lineage. There is no mistake..."

He pondered for a long time before speaking again, quietly. "Heyun, I find his personality lacks the dominance and ruthlessness... it does not resemble a White Qilin... yet it also lacks the insidious volatility of a White Cicada. If I had to say... he reminds me more of Emperor Gong of Wei."

Dongfang Heyun smiled slightly and bowed. "In this subordinate’s view... that is perfectly normal. After all, the Great Ancestor of Wei is in an abnormal state, and the Bright Yang has likewise been affected. The signs were already present during Emperor Gong's time. For him to resemble Emperor Gong now, is that not perfectly logical? Lacking dominance and tyranny is actually better. We need not worry that his temperament is too fierce, causing him to rush headlong for that Fruition Attainment... This is truly ideal."

"Indeed." The Beihai Dragon King couldn't help but nod. "No matter how much they influence the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment, they cannot bestow several lines of destiny at once. Calculating the days, Mount Luoxia is about to move on the Bright Yang's descent again. We must watch over this side; how much can they manage over there? One Li Zhouwei is the most they can handle, and he is safe right under our noses..."

Dongfang Heyun nodded respectfully. "The Bright Yang Auxiliary Position is extremely difficult to obtain. The Dongli Sect has researched the Radiant Fire Intercalary Position, but it is no simple matter either, especially right under Mount Luoxia’s watch, and having to cultivate the divine abilities... I just wonder what the North will say of this."

At the mention of this, the demon on the high seat clearly hesitated. He lowered his voice. "It is still early, but we had to mention it to him first, to make him wary and vigilant toward Mount Luoxia... lest he be too passive later..."

He put away the golden droplet and stood. "I am making a trip to Yinzhou Island. If he emerges from seclusion, explain things to him and send him on his way."
