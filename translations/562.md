# Chapter 867: Urgent Persuasion

Yu Jiang lifted his head to gaze at the Astral Qi tearing through the sky, trailing a long golden flame. Its golden light was as brilliant as a sword that split a dark cloud in two. His expression remained unchanged, but he silently stepped back as the golden light manifested before him.

Clad in thunder, Li Qinghong twirled her slender hand, retracting her long spear, which now hung upside down behind her as purple lightning rained down. A man in platinum armor appeared beside her.

The man had a broad chest, sharp eyes, and was slightly taller than Li Qinghong. He was clad in armor and wielded a massive, fierce golden bow. He hovered in the air, invisible Astral Qi spreading around him.

His eyes under long eyebrows opened like an eagle’s, scanning the heavy demonic clouds.

"Second Uncle!" Li Qinghong said delightedly, and the man in platinum armor nodded slowly, raising his gaze to meet Yu Jiang’s eyes.

His eyes were only slightly cold, but Yu Jiang involuntarily gritted his teeth, feeling as if ice and snow had fallen on him from head to calf. The young man forced himself not to look away and quietly met the gaze.

He saw the man’s brow twitch upward, his black-gray pupils slowly dilating, and all the fierce killing intent dissipated. The man’s lips trembled, and Yu Jiang heard a hoarse voice, "You..."

The youth felt frozen stiff all over, but that single word made hot blood surge to his head. His hand clutching the talisman twitched twice, and a strange thought crossed his mind, His voice sounds much older than his face.

Yu Jiang raised his hand and touched his storage pouch, taking something out. He tried to steady his voice but couldn’t help the slight tremble as he said, "Senior."

He produced a golden arrow, heavy and cold, with bright feathers at the tail. Its arrowhead was finely polished and shining with a faint glow.

A few small characters were carved on the shaft, Li Xuanfeng of Yi Mountain.

The bold script revealed the owner’s spirit. The man’s gaze fell on the arrow, and the youth even felt it grow heavier in his hand. Li Xuanfeng then intently examined Yu Jiang’s eyes and brows.

The youth maintained his composure and spoke softly, "This is yours, Senior. I am returning it."

Li Xuanfeng’s gaze lingered on the arrow for a moment. Yu Jiang vaguely heard his restrained breathing, then that slightly hoarse voice sounded again, "So it was you."

Those words felt like they burned the youth, and he immediately closed his eyes. His figure turned from black to gray, then slowly faded away, leaving behind a wisp of black smoke that drifted away in the air, vanishing without a trace.

Li Xuanfeng still stood steadily, the dimly glowing arrow floating in the air. His emotions were hidden beneath his iron-hard demeanor, and no one could see anything from his face.

Astral Qi twisted in the air, occasionally brushing against Li Qinghong’s Cyan Sparrow Plume and producing a sharp, grating sound. Li Qinghong carefully studied Li Xuanfeng’s face, then recalled Yu Jiang’s face, her expression turning thoughtful.

Li Xuanfeng maintained his rigid posture, his voice slightly hoarse as he spoke softly, "So it was you..."

Li Qinghong stood beside him as a beam of green light streaked across the sky and landed nearby, revealing a middle-aged man with a sword at his waist, exuding a touch of elegance. He stared solemnly at the dark clouds in the north, his expression grave.

This is bad!

"Brother Xuanfeng!"

This man was naturally Si Yuanli. He and Li Xuanfeng had just escaped from Chengshui Tomb in Great Ning Palace and rushed over just in time to see the rolling demonic smoke.

He knew well the filth between the various sects and the schemes between the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. When he saw the rolling demonic smoke along the way and recalled that all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were trapped inside, his heart trembled.

He whispered, "Brother Xuanfeng... I fear this is the plot of another sect! This is trouble..."

Si Yuanli glanced carefully across the river, then immediately turned to look at Li Qinghong behind him and asked quietly, "Where is Chi Zhiyan? Is he stationed at the rear? Who is in charge of the riverbank defense? Have him come out to see me at once!"

Though Si Yuanli had recently kept a low profile in Great Ning Palace, in the end, he was highly valued and Si Boxiu’s direct descendant. Even though he usually held no position within the sect, he did not need to bow to Chi Zhiyun!

Moreover, although the Si Family was small in number and usually kept a low profile, Si Boxiu was fiercely protective of his own. Even Si Yuanbai, known to be kind, once threw twelve Rain Summoning Talismans at Yuanwu Peak in a fit of anger and nearly flooded it.

His words were cold and instantly revealed his status, but Li Qinghong returned the courtesy with a light bow and said gently, "Reporting to Senior, there is no one in charge of the riverbank."

Si Yuanli seemed to vaguely understand and replied coldly, "Where is Chi Zhiyan?!"

"My Lord is still at Mount Bianyan." Li Qinghong’s voice was gentle and her etiquette impeccable as she politely replieddaid, "My Lord took his trusted followers to guard Mount Bianyan to observe the situation within the devil cultivators, so as to better plan for us."

She spoke politely, but when he saw Li Xizhi beside her look away and Li Ximing curl his lip, Si Yuanli immediately understood and laughed in anger. "What a coward! He’s not even worth a hair of his brother! He’s still worrying about that at a time like this? Sitting back while the riverbank collapses and all the cultivators rush in to seize Jiangnan’s lands?"

Si Yuanli’s eyes narrowed, and a chill suddenly crept into his heart, "The man may be greedy and timid, but he’s no fool... Could it be that he knows Chi Tianxing and others died in Anhuai Heaven, leaving the Chi Family without Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Does he now fear losing control, and wants to cut off branches to preserve the trunk?

"But Chi Zhiyun is still around... Could Chi Zhiyun have already gone into seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm?"

Growing up in the sect, Si Yuanli was especially sensitive to these factional struggles. The Si Family was small in number, and the Chi Family wasn’t much better. However, the Chi Family’s internal struggles had grown increasingly intense in recent years. It was a dire situation.

He felt uneasy at this thought. He lightly brushed the silk pouch at his waist, took out a small bright bead, and blew on it, instantly releasing a wisp of white wind.

The wind enveloped them all, isolating them from the outside world. Only then did Si Yuanli’s expression darken as he spoke, "I just remembered something... The Chi Family only have a few direct descendants from two generations, and now they’re dead in Anhuai Heaven. Daoist Master Buzi has been missing for years. How could Chi Zhiyan not be afraid?

"Although the devil plague was terrifying and many direct descendants from various families died, the best among them survived thanks to Li Xuanfeng holding off Tang Shedu at Chengshui Tomb. Instead, they seized a lot of resources... completed many cultivation techniques, and even learned many secrets...

"There aren’t many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in these families, but every one of them clawed their way up. There aren’t any disposable guest cultivators among them. Just look at your esteemed family, and you’ll understand..."

Si Yuanli’s eyes narrowed as he spoke in a low voice, "The Azure Pond Sect is different from the Golden Feather Sect, it exploits far too harshly. The Golden Feather Sect has plenty of family and rogue Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators they can throw at the slaughter. But which Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator left alive in the Azure Pond Sect’s territory is an easy target? They can only carve flesh from their own bodies...

"Most of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators lost in the north-south struggle were the Azure Pond Sect’s guest cultivators and Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Once Chi Zhiyan counted the losses, he must have realized he couldn’t afford any more. That’s why he’s consolidating power and using this crisis to cut away everyone’s strength!"

Si Yuanli’s voice remained quiet. "I understand now... The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were simply convenient meat for the Azure Pond Sect to carve up. Chi Zhiyan reacted quickly, immediately choosing a method that balanced gains and losses to minimize his own damage."

Li Qinghong’s heart cleared. How could she not understand after that? She thought silently, So some of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who bear deeper grudges against the Azure Pond Sect are not satisfied!

Li Qinghong glanced silently at Li Xuanfeng, and suddenly understood the message Kong Tingyun had brought from Daoist Master Changxi. She thought to herself, Perhaps that message wasn’t meant for me at all... but for Second Uncle!

She used a secret technique to transmit her voice, "Second Uncle! I passed by Profound Peak Gate earlier, and Daoist Friend Tingyun brought a message from Daoist Master Changxi..."

Li Xuanfeng listened carefully, and at last his expression changed. His sharp brows relaxed, and his voice turned deep and hoarse as he muttered, "Flooding the seedlings and wiping out a hundred years of harvest is certainly satisfying. But when the river flows back and drowns the steps of the courtyard, that’s even more gratifying."

His words seemed like a recitation, but they made Si Yuanli shiver in fear as he turned to stare blankly at Li Xuanfeng. How could he not understand the meaning of those words? As long as the riverbank was harder to swallow than Mount Bianyan, then naturally the river would flow back to attack Mount Bianyan in the devil cultivator’s isolated heartland!

But Mount Bianyan contained the Chi Family’s direct descendants! Compared to the severe losses the Azure Pond Sect families suffered from the flooding of the seedlings, it was truly drowning the courtyard steps, the Chi Family’s direct line. It would truly wound them to the bone!

When Si Yuanli heard this, his heart was pounding like a drum, and all the blood rushed to his head, River flowing back... river flowing back...

Such a counterattack was extremely brilliant. It was so legitimate that even Chi Zhiyan couldn’t pick a flaw in it. Yet Si Yuanli hesitated, to the point that the dharma light on his body flickered faintly...

He certainly enjoyed seeing the Chi Family make a fool of themselves; he’d even laugh heartily at the deaths of Chi Tianxing and Chi Fuju. Yet in the end, the Chi, Si, Ning, and Tang families were all one body. Though he’d suffered much oppression in terms of benefits, he’d never harbored the intention to actively persecute them...

This method was good, even legitimate, but who with eyes couldn’t see it? Making that decision meant offending the Chi Family! When he heard those words spoke aloud, even someone as composed as he felt a sense of panic in his heart. Though his face remained calm, the hand gripping his sword hilt turned white.

Li Xuanfeng slowly raised his head, his eyes sharp enough to terrify and his voice cold and hoarse, but his words struck right at Si Yuanli’s heart.

"Daoist Friend Yuanli... why would the Daoist Master give the Huai River Map to me?!"

This is an ancient spirit artifact originally meant to guard the riverbank... guard the riverbank! Could it be for this very moment?!

That straightforward statement shattered Si Yuanli’s psychological defenses, as a cold fear, like ten thousand years of black ice, rose in his heart. The meaning was perfectly clear, Si Boxiu himself also supported this move!

But the Daoist Master clearly didn’t tell me beforehand!

Si Yuanli was instantly thrown into confusion. Yuan Xiu had never shown any dislike towards the Chi Family, and he’d even often treated them courteously. He’d even gone so far as to ask people to bring the Chi Family to Great Ning Palace, he couldn’t have tried harder...

But the thoughts of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are unfathomable. Who knows what the Daoist Master was really thinking...

His heart sank. Across from him, Li Xuanfeng’s gravelly voice aligned perfectly with his own thoughts, Chi Tianxing and Chi Fuju were also specifically invited by the Daoist Master...

The same words, from his mouth, carried a completely different flavor. Chi Tianxing and Chi Fuju were now probably unrecognizable corpses in Anhuai Heaven. Si Yuanli couldn’t help but feel suspicious, Could the Daoist Master have done this on purpose?

All the evidence pointed to Si Boxiu’s instructions, yet Si Yuanli couldn’t help but feel a lingering doubt. Every clue now darted through his mind along with Li Xuanfeng’s words, making his head pound as though it might split open.

Li Xuanfeng simply spread his hands, revealing a small golden talisman in his palm that was only two fingers wide and filled with pure white patterns. He said coldly, "Brother Yuanli! You can see for yourself; this talisman was handed to me privately by the Daoist Master! Perhaps it was for this very moment! It shouldn’t be shown in private, but the urgency of the situation leaves no choice!"

He spoke solemnly, "The Daoist Master saved my life from Maha’s hands and helped me greatly. I remember that in my heart. As long as Brother Yuanli gives the order, I will certainly act! But if Brother Yuanli wants to abandon the river and leave..."

Li Xuanfeng’s expression was calm as he spoke quietly, "Of course, I will hand over the spirit artifact and talisman to Brother Yuanli. But I cannot disregard the millions of people behind me. I will stay here and defend them to the very end!"

Si Yuanli didn’t even need to look closely. This talisman was extremely powerful, and he’d personally seen the Daoist Master refine it with his divine abilities. He never expected to find it in Li Xuanfeng’s hands.

He silently took a breath, unable to find words, and murmured, "How can this be..."

Beside them, Li Qinghong had understood everything. She stepped forward and urged softly but urgently, "Senior... I won’t speak of my own private concerns in my home region. Even if we can’t hold this place, my family still has the means to protect itself! But behind this river are millions of common people... all depending on us!"

Si Yuanli fell silent, but the devil cultivators across the river could no longer hold back. The heavy devil winds slowly approached. The white mist dissipated, returning into the bead in Si Yuanli’s hand.

Li Xuanfeng turned slightly, and finally took action.

Clang!

He raised his bow, brilliant golden light gathering along the string. A sharp buzzing sound rang in everyone’s ears, and the man’s eyes filled with a fierce killing intent. His voice thundered like rolling lightning, carried by the wind.

"Li Xuanfeng of Bianyan is here. Step forward and die!"

The voice, powered by mana, rolled through the thick black smoke like thunder rolling in the clouds.

"Li Xuanfeng of Bianyan is here. Step forward and die..."

"Step forward and die..."

The voice spread among the demonic sounds, actually halting the restless demonic clouds on the horizon. The gathered cultivators looked at each other, but no one dared take the first step.

Only the river below continued to flow. The man in platinum armor hovered above, his cold eyes watching. He had halted the cultivators with a single shout. He regarded the thousands of devil cultivators before the river as if they were nothing.

He slowly turned to look back, his sharp eyes calm, and spoke in a low voice, "Intimidation can only work for a moment. Brother Yuanli, make your decision quickly!"

His voice spread through the air, prompting Lingu Lanying and the others not far away to raise their heads. Si Yuanli’s face flushed faintly.

He exhaled heavily from deep in his chest and said solemnly, "Hold!"

As his words fell, the eyebrows of the man before him slowly rose. The icy calm demeanor faded away as a savage expression, like that of a tiger or a leopard, took over his face.

A smile slowly curved his lips, and he showed the same wild arrogance he’d worn at the age of six when his uncle had pulled him from a mountain of corpses.

Golden light flared, and a frozen voice rang out, "Xuanfeng obeys."
