# Chapter 936: Lament for the Fleeting River

'How can a ghost compare to an immortal's make?'

The actor's melody still hung in the air. Li Zhouwei stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his index finger resting on the opposite wrist. He tapped silently, seemingly matching the rhythm of the pipa playing below.

Below, the middle-aged man’s phoenix eyes narrowed, a hint of a smile touching his lips. He remained silent, but brought his hands from behind his back. One hand moved to untie a small gourd at his waist.

The gourd was small and charming, its contents a mystery—wine, perhaps, or some other brew. The man took a sip, then rested his other hand on his hip, his forefinger casually hooked over the hilt of the central blade among the six small swords at his belt.

His relaxed, almost careless posture was that of a minor official from a neighboring town, the sort who might tend his own small vegetable garden. As if, having finished his duties and tilled his fields, he had simply wandered over to enjoy the music.

But Li Zhouwei did not relax in the slightest.

In his golden pupils, however, the man before him pulsed with five terrifying streams of multicolored light. They were like a dragon lying dormant in the abyss, concealed within the deep darkness of the Great Void. They resided within his flawless dharma body, perfectly integrated and harmonised.

'A Great Daoist Master... A Great Daoist Master from the "Rainbow Glow" Dao! A grand cultivator who has achieved perfected divine abilities!'

When Jiangnan cultivators celebrated a new divine ability, they often spoke of "Achieving the Five Methods." The more ancient and esteemed cultivators would speak of the "Five Methods Perfected, Averting the Great Calamity." This referred to the very first step toward Fruition Attainment—the state of perfected divine abilities that this man had reached!

This was, without a doubt, the highest level of cultivation in the present age beneath that of a True Monarch. The number of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who had reached this state and could still walk the world could be counted on one hand. Even within the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, only the "Two Purples" of the legendary "Three Yuans, Two Purples" had ever achieved it. Today, the only one known to be alive at this stage was the elusive Zimu, whose movements were shrouded in legend... Outside that tradition, there was Jiang Boqing, but he was a figure from an age long past.

As for the others, whether it was Chi Wei from earlier times or Si Boxiu more recently, they had all only managed to complete their five great divine abilities at the very end of their lives. And as for what supplements or substitutes they used to get there, and what effect it had? Only they themselves knew if they could truly boast of perfection.

A peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had perfected their divine abilities while still possessing a long life, one who had the leisure to stroll through the mortal world... the Li family had never encountered such a person in all their years. This was the first. The last person known to walk the world so freely with such power was now the Jade True Six-Nine Void True Monarch, one of the "Three Shamans and Two Rites," a being who sat upon a divine altar!

And that "Rainbow Glow" affinity... which sect could it be, other than... Mount Luoxia!

'Ghosts... Is he hinting at the Underworld? ...Forget what the Underworld feels about Li Qianyuan, why would they ever back me? They're just hoping a few more cultivators break through to True Monarch so they can harvest the Metallic Essence left behind!'

He had been cultivating on the north shore when he suddenly felt a pull from the unseen world, as if destiny itself were guiding him. At the same time, an unrelenting chill radiated from his Shengyang Acupoint, giving him the feeling that his life was hanging by a thread. He had no choice but to ride the winds and silently follow that pull...

He already knew someone was coming. Tianhuo of the Golden Feather Sect had even sent a veiled warning, telling him a "distinguished guest" was heading south and asking if he truly needed to remain here... But seeing him now... what a truly formidable figure!

'Is he here for me, or just passing through on his way south to watch?'

'What does he mean by acting so unhurried? How long have I been at the Purple Mansion Realm! At the speed of a divine ability, I'd have had enough time to fly to the Sea's Cape and back several times over! If Mount Luoxia truly wanted to keep me on the mainland, to force me to break through right under their nose, why are they dragging their feet like this?'

'It's like they were hoping I'd leave, but reluctantly. Now that they see I'm not leaving, he 'conveniently' drops by. But what would have happened if I had *actually* fled overseas?!'

His expression darkened, his golden eyes fixed intently on the man below. His thoughts churned, rising and falling like an uncertain tide.

'They casually dispatch a Great Daoist Master with perfected divine abilities... Just how many Daoist Masters, how many True Monarchs, does Mount Luoxia command?'

The Dawn Guest Tower was filled with noise, but his thoughts remained ice-cold and clear. Beside him, however, Li Zhouluo was covered in a cold sweat.

Li Zhouwei had suddenly appeared in this tower, using a divine ability for no apparent reason, and had then secretly arranged for the two of them to be led away. Something was definitely wrong.

For a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to act so personally... could it be that another master of divine abilities was hidden here?

He had no choice but to put down his chopsticks. He exchanged a look with Li Jiangzong and they quietly stood up. The proprietor of the Dawn Guest Tower, who should have been waiting on them, was nowhere to be seen. Li Zhouluo let out a silent breath of relief. Feigning some errand, the two of them slipped away down the nearby stairs.

Their table was in the very center of the tavern, the most conspicuous spot where every movement would normally be watched. But right now, the actor's tragic wail was at its peak, and no one seemed to notice the two empty seats.

Li Zhouwei raised his head slightly, listening to the actor on stage plead with the heavens, begging for the return of his kinsmen. The actor sang:

"Bones overflow, blood freezes in spring.
A river of red tears flows; I am a lonely ghost...
Oh, father and brothers! Where have the old days gone?
My spirit is all that remains, cold...
A body like deadwood, rootless, adrift,
Tattered rags offer no warmth...
Whose wretched child is this..."

The middle-aged man listened and sighed silently. Two more actors in splendid costumes appeared on stage. They wore white silks around their waists, symbolizing that they were riding the clouds. A voice sang out in recitative:

"Invited to the immortal peaks, seated on the golden dais,
Watching the glows of dusk, half-hidden from heaven's light.
Snow-white candles, robes of vibrant spirit,
Are all affairs in the mortal world settled?
I lament I am not a floating cloud.
My retainers ride qilin-hoofed steeds from the mountains,
From dark windows, the lower world looks up in awe...
Oh, my descendant! How did you become a ghost!"

As Li Zhouwei listened, the hand that had been tapping on his wrist stilled. He said nothing, but the people around him began to clamor. Every other word was about immortals and ghosts. Someone even sighed:

"If you don't seek immortality, what's the point of even living!"

As they spoke, the old man playing the Demon ghost returned to the stage, hissing menacingly as he tempted the protagonist:

"Raise the jasper palace, pave the jade tower,
Let your light reflect the blood on the ghostly wind's brow.
The three great halls, the moonlit rain,
Control your nature, and you too can become a golden rainbow.
If there were truly a path to immortality,
Why would they ever let *you* have it?
I fear it is all... a flute playing chaos on the wind,
The deceptive scent of a drooling dragon."

This was always the most thrilling part of the play. The audience craned their necks, eyes glued to the stage. They were terrified the protagonist would be swayed by the demon ghost, but also afraid the immortals would give up in disappointment and leave him to his fate.

The actor immediately broke into a tearful plea. The two sides went back and forth, one singing as the other finished. The music's pitch climbed higher, pushing the atmosphere to its absolute peak. Everyone in the audience stopped, cups and chopsticks frozen in mid-air. They stared at the stage, silent and motionless.

Li Zhouwei’s expression grew complicated. As he shifted his gaze back to the middle-aged man, he found the man was no longer focused on the play. He had turned his head slightly, revealing a dignified and righteous profile.

And those phoenix eyes... they crossed the distance between them, locking onto him with a quiet, steady gaze.

Within his brown pupils, strands of multicolored light erupted, swirling like a vast, turbulent vortex of Heavenly Glow. In that instant, the distance between them seemed to stretch to the ends of the earth, yet also felt as close as breathing.

'Sword...'

From those pupils, Li Zhouwei felt a piercing sharpness that made his own eyes ache. It was a power that was clearly contained, yet it felt as if it could soar to the heavens at any moment. This sharp aura was hidden within the Heavenly Glow, like a coiled dragon floating just beneath the surface, revealing only a single scale, a single claw.

The Li family had risen to prominence as a clan of sword immortals. They not only possessed a Sword Codex that anchored the clan's destiny, but also had many ancestors who were masters of the Way of the Sword. Li Zhouwei was naturally familiar with it. From this one glance, he sensed something profoundly different.

'It's not Sword Intent... It's another path, different from Sword Intent. It is still the sword... but it is a sword of Dao-Profundity, a sword of spell arts, a sword of divine ability.'

Li Zhouwei knew that Li Xizhi possessed a sword technique called the Five-Colour Sinking Expanse Sword Art. It was immensely famous, and it, too, was related to Heavenly Glow!

'Perhaps this is that very kind of sword technique, cultivated to an unfathomably high realm. The Way of the Sword is hidden within the divine ability itself. Wherever the divine ability passes, the brilliance of the sword technique shines!'

And this aura of Rainbow Glow sword qi sent a profound, life-threatening sense of danger rising from the depths of his heart, forcing him to make an instant assessment:

'This sword is in no way inferior to ordinary Sword Intent, and its power is simply immeasurable... Mount Luoxia... I fear... I fear neither Chi Wei nor Jiang Boqing would be his match. Even Duanmu Kui, who dominated his entire generation... was probably no better than this!'

The vortex of Rainbow Glow sword qi vanished as if it were an illusion, flickering before his eyes for only a fraction of a second before disappearing, revealing the man's brown pupils once more. The Great Daoist Master, perfected in his divine abilities, showed no other unusual signs. He simply continued to gaze calmly at the pair of golden eyes hidden in the upper gallery.

The cheers of the crowd swelled around them like a tidal wave, but the two men seemed separate from the world, cut off from time. They formed their own universe, locking everything into that single, shared gaze.

And yet, one clear, melodic voice from the stage—long, drawn-out, and beautiful—drifted through the air and echoed in his ear:

"The handsome youth of Long Prefecture,
Officials in his line for generations.
He attained the Roc's ocean, held the Phoenix's marsh,
If not for one family ruling the prefecture alone...
How could they be wiped out in ten generations?
Immortals not respected, gods not revered,
No need for ghosts or monsters to act...
Without you, oh!
How could a single disciple of your house still live?"

In that instant, Li Zhouwei’s brow lowered slightly. At his waist, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd gleamed a dull, brownish-gold in the shadows. The cheers in the tower grew louder, roaring like a landslide, like a tsunami.

"He crossed the straits to Penglai,
As the morning light first dawned.
A sword bound by one hundred twenty chains,
The qilin weeps, leaving its home.
But as long as the throne has an owner,
Who is to say who cannot sit on it!
The old father's heart wished to slay the son,
A pity immortals guarded the underworld springs...
If not for the flying glow watching from the heavens,
How many in the prefecture would still survive!"

Li Zhouwei’s pupils widened slightly. He gripped the railing, his expression growing heavier, which only made the gold in his eyes burn brighter. He narrowed his eyes, but still said nothing.

'The old father's heart wished to slay the son...'

The ethereal voice of Qingyu Qian echoed in his mind, along with those chilling words:

'Son slays father, father kills son, father steals son's love, son seizes father's power...'

'The son is strong and the father is weak; how could he not seize his position? ...But Bright Yang detests inversion; how could he not fear his own son!'

A cold glint flashed in Li Zhouwei’s eyes. He seemed to understand many things in that one moment. But the middle-aged man before him slowly averted his gaze, turning to look somewhere else.

His gaze was like a sharp sword, parting the sea and cutting through the waves. It compelled one's attention, forcing them to ignore the surrounding noise and chaos, and follow it to a small table on the far periphery.

The table was barely two feet square, one of the cheapest seats in the Dawn Guest Tower. A youth in a white robe sat there, holding a small cup in one hand and chopsticks in the other. He was studying a small saucer on his table.

On the saucer were two very thick slices of pickled radish. He seemed at a loss as to how to begin, turning them over and over with his chopsticks as if researching their purpose.

As the middle-aged man’s gaze fell on him, the youth gave up and dropped his chopsticks. He looked up, revealing a face of cold, delicate beauty, almost feminine. His black hair fell like a waterfall, his demeanor as still as ice.

He was handsome, with normal hands and feet, but for one thing: he had an extra ear on each cheek. They were long and pointed, following the curve of his jawline back toward his normal ears. This feature instantly transformed his aura, making him appear both aloof and demonic.

Though he sat perfectly still, a faint halo of multicolored light flickered behind his head. It radiated outwards, fading in and out of view, mitigating much of his demonic aura and lending him an air of sanctity instead.

Compared to the other man’s relaxed ease, his expression was cold, even grave.

But the moment he looked up, all sound vanished. The entire Dawn Guest Tower fell utterly silent. The surrounding patrons were frozen in a tableau of myriad expressions—some craning their necks to shout, some shaking their heads and sighing, some whispering, others critiquing loudly. All of them were stopped like statues. A piece of meat, halfway to a mouth, hung in the air. Wine, pouring from a jug, hung like a crystal thread. Even motes of spittle were frozen in mid-flight.

The actors on stage, however, were completely unaware. They performed with growing fervor as cascades of golden flowers and colorful silks, prepared in advance, rained down from above. This signaled the bestowing of immortal blessings and the retreat of the demon ghost. The protagonist had finally achieved immortality, and the surrounding actors all bowed down in reverence.

"He receives the immortal's station, bathed in divine light!
True devotion earns the immortal's reward!
Sunny mists, dragon banners flying,
Grand music soars on the wind and clouds!
For half an incense stick, the bell rings, we kowtow,
This one spark of immortality is the truest of all!"

A faint, amused smile appeared on the Great Daoist Master's face, as if lamenting the other's dramatic display. His interest in the actors was clearly greater, and the disturbance immediately made him turn back.

He glanced at the stage, saw with some regret that the play was ending, and murmured a few words of praise. He re-fastened the gourd to his waist, brushed the dust from his sleeves—and with it, the aura of the mortal world—and gave Li Zhouwei a faint smile.

In the next instant, the spot where he stood was empty. Not a shadow of him remained.

Li Zhouwei immediately snapped his gaze to the corner. That table, too, was empty. Even the wine was gone. Only the two slices of radish remained.

"Bravo!"

A single shout of praise shattered the silence. In that same instant, the tower burst back into motion. The suspended wine splashed into the cup, the airborne meat finally reached its destination, and an endless wave of noise erupted once more.

"Bravo!"

The clinking of copper coins rang out as audience members rushed the stage to offer tips. After some time, the crowd escorted the actors out, and the noise finally began to subside. Then, the entire tower suddenly grew dark.

But on the highest gallery, the man in scaled armor still stood motionless. As darkness enveloped everything, only his golden pupils continued to glitter, emitting a chilling, dreadful light.

The tower became utterly silent, so quiet that not a sound could be heard. A man in black robes crept up the stairs, trembling, and knelt before Li Zhouwei. He spoke in a respectful, fearful voice:

"Daoist Master..."

Li Zhouwei’s expression was unreadable, but his voice was slow and heavy when he spoke.

"What was the name of that play?"

As he spoke, Chen Yang buried his head even lower.

"It was... *Lament for the Fleeting River*."
