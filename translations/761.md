# Chapter 761: Thunder

The thunder roared. Silver-white lightning flowed backward along the spear's tip, extending six feet into the air. Though the storm still poured in the distance, the nearby rain suddenly suspended, each drop becoming a crystal-clear sphere that evaporated and shrank within the lightning's aura.

The glow from Changxiao’s lantern intensified, steadily wearing away the electrical glare. He saw the spear was held in a slender, pale hand. The thunder climbed affectionately around the wrist, leaping onto a sleeve cuff adorned with purple-and-white feathers.

Only then did he clearly see the female cultivator standing before him. She had a high-bridged nose, willow brows, and apricot eyes, but within those pupils, purple qi flowed like mist. Her black hair fell like a waterfall, her brow marked by a purple sigil. The dense lightning climbed her body, converging behind her to form an immense, purple-and-white circular disk.

Whether this disk was a divine ability or a spiritual artifact, it was vast as a mountain, covered in dense, fractal patterns of lightning. Suspended over the sea, the woman at its center looked like a mystic bird floating within the eye of the storm, her long spear leveled directly at Changxiao’s glabella.

The churning waves below rapidly ceased, and the sea grew preternaturally calm. The rain that should have been falling was caught by primordial magnetism, the drops hovering above the surface before shrinking into nothing. In an instant, the ocean became a perfect mirror, reflecting the mountain-sized thunder disk and the mystic bird of a woman within it.

Changxiao held his lantern as the dense white smoke gathered around him once more. His pupils reflected the purple-and-white lightning filling the world as he asked softly, "Are you a dragon?"

*Boom!*

A vast thunderclap answered him. The silver spear reversed, planting itself in the air with a metallic clang. The woman stood clad in purple-and-white feathered thunder-robes and boots etched with fine silver patterns, floating in the void. The long feathers of her outer robe began to lengthen, trailing behind her in the lightning.

Her voice was clear and icy, ringing out in harmony with the heavens: "I am Thunder."

Instantly, a silver-white thunderbolt as thick as a water bucket dropped from the sky. Changxiao reacted immediately; the silver disk etched with profound patterns flashed overhead. Its Supreme Yin light held against the lightning for only a fraction of a second before flaring brightly, clearly reinforced by Changxiao’s own divine ability and Dharma power.

*BOOM!*

The sound of the impact arrived a moment later, far louder and more majestic than the bolt itself. The silver disk shook violently, flashing in protest.

Changxiao watched in silence as the purple-and-white lightning gathered like a tide, surging within the dark clouds and reflecting the hazy figure in the sky. The lantern in his hand grew steadily brighter.

The mirror-like sea was completely covered by the purple-white lightning, reflecting the giant thunder disk from both above and below. But at the far horizon, a speck of brilliant gold began to rise.

"Daybreak," Changxiao observed.

The morning sun breached the horizon, signaling the end of the long night. Sunlight pierced the dark clouds, illuminating Changxiao’s face and the deep calculations within his willow-leaf eyes.

The Daoist Master understood that as time passed, the chase had become meaningless. Even if he suppressed this woman, he would never find Li Ximing’s trail further east.

Although the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* was a lock, Li Ximing was also a Purple Mansion cultivator. He wouldn't be stupid enough to double back, and his *Audience with the Celestial Gate* specialized in suppression and refinement. He must have been suppressing the curse while fleeing, and by now, the trail was cold.

Changxiao’s experience and cultivation base were profound, and he quickly reached a judgment: the dragon clans would absolutely not intervene in this situation. The woman before him could only be a lucky beneficiary of some thunderous fortuitous encounter within a Grotto-Heaven.

Changxiao raised his head and said coldly, "Presumably, Daoist Friend, you gained an opportunity by swallowing thunder, becoming an agent of Thunder for the dragon clans. You've barely reached the Purple Mansion realm, yet you wield such astonishing majesty."

"I was merely passing through the sea territory you guard. You wish to help someone from your human bloodline; that is reasonable enough. Out of respect for the dragon clans, I will no longer pursue the matter of Li Ximing."

He raised his lantern, preparing to tear through the Great Void and depart, only to find the world erupting in thunder. Purple-and-white lightning fell like a waterfall. Changxiao’s expression frosted over as he turned his head.

The thunder that had been gathering in the sky began to move. The sea below surged with an incalculable number of aquatic beings; countless silver and green scales and fins breached the surface before vanishing back into the depths.

The woman hovered in the center of the massive, purple-white Thunder Pool disk, which blazed with fractal patterns. All the storm clouds in the sky converged toward it, like myriad stars paying homage to the moon, arraying themselves around the Thunder Pool, holding it between the heavens and the sea.

"Then *I* must pursue this matter," her clear voice echoed across the world. "After all, the dragon clans have face. You, Daoist Friend, do not."

***

East of the Eastern Sea.

The immense thunder storm had just passed, and the torrential rains over the Quhai Sea had stopped. The only thing left on the water's surface were a few pieces of splintered wood, spinning in small whirlpools. A damp, cold wind blew from the coast. Upon the shore, the Great Void fluctuated, and a brilliant light emerged.

The moment this Profound Light appeared, raging flames manifested around it, searing the sea surface and sending up clouds of white steam. It sped across the water and landed on a nearby island.

The light resolved into the cultivator in the white-gold Daoist robes, who staggered several steps before collapsing to his knees.

Earlier, Li Ximing had been fleeing the storm when he sensed Changxiao had run into trouble. He immediately seized the opportunity, fleeing headlong without ever looking back, and plunged back into the Great Void.

Out here, in the vast seas east of the Eastern Sea, his travel speed within the Great Void was astonishingly fast. He did not sense his pursuer's aura, and trusting that detection grew fainter the further east he went, he kept his Supreme Yin Profound Light hidden and focused only on speed.

He didn't know how long he had flown, but spots began to appear in the void ahead, and he could faintly perceive the end in the far distance. Li Ximing had a sudden realization: 'I’ve reached the Sea’s Cape!'

The Great Void behind him was utterly silent; it seemed Changxiao had not given chase. Still, Li Ximing dared not relax. Dragging his heavily injured body, he changed direction in this desolate region, flying south for the better part of a day. Only after using his Immortal Mirror to scan the area and confirming no one was present did he finally emerge into the physical world.

He knelt on the sandy ground, stirring up a cloud of dust that revealed the stark white bones hidden just beneath the surface. The wooden fragments still drifted on the sea. Li Ximing couldn't stop himself from coughing.

"Cough... cough..."

He spat out a mouthful of brilliantly shining blood. When it struck the sand, it sounded like stones colliding, shattering into a dense white powder mixed with tiny insects that immediately scattered. The few drops that pooled in hollows instantly grew into clams, remaining motionless among the rocks.

The flames of the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* still flickered on and off across his body, melting the surrounding sand into patches of crystal. Li Ximing felt a searing heat throughout his body; the damage to his Dharma Body was clearly significant.

"Hahaha... *cough, cough*... Hahahaha!"

Li Ximing laughed even as he coughed, feeling not distress, but overwhelming relief at having survived the calamity.

He had been fully prepared to sacrifice his spiritual artifact, even his Dharma Body itself. He had been ready to leave behind just a single sliver of his Shengyang and use the Supreme Yin Profound Light to take Changxiao down with him.

Once Changxiao was dead, the resulting trouble would have been just as severe as if he lived. But now, Changxiao was alive and he had escaped, saving both the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger and his Dharma Body. Although he was heavily injured and afflicted by the curse, this outcome was far, far better than his grimmest expectations.

He stood up. The ground was covered in the white insects, still waving their slender, pale limbs. Li Ximing suppressed the searing pain in his spiritual sense, glanced at them, and whispered, "Return."

The instant he spoke, a wind swept the ground, scraping all the scattered white powder and stone fragments toward him. The countless white insects swarmed back, and even the clams leaped from the rocks, gathering into a single mass at his feet before self-immolating in a burst of purple flame.

'This blood... corrupted by the curse... it cannot be reabsorbed into the Dharma Body or refined into Bright Yang materials. Normally this wouldn't matter, but in my weakened state, I absolutely cannot leave a single trace behind that someone could use for divination.'

Taking a step, Li Ximing noticed a sand-louse type of Demon beast burrowed beneath the sand. It had not yet developed true intelligence, but its cultivation wasn't bad; it knew a terrifying presence had arrived on the shore and was trembling in its hiding spot. The bones he had seen earlier... they were likely this creature's leftovers.

Unwilling to leave any trace of his presence, Li Ximing suppressed the urge to cough and stomped his foot once. The sand-louse was instantly incinerated into nothingness. He turned, found a reef, and leaned against it to inspect his injuries.

His Dharma Body had been roasted by True Fire multiple times, leaving his entire back slightly cracked. His shoulder was pierced by several holes from the Supreme Yin light. Changxiao’s arts focused on yin-aligned powers and curses, so while his body had no massive missing sections, his overall condition was far from optimistic.

His Shengyang, a key Purple Mansion acupoint, ached under the influence of the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art*—he still didn't know what medium Changxiao had used to inflict it. Black flames roiled within his Juque Palace, while both invisible and deep-black flames intertwined on his skin, steadily draining his divine abilities and Dharma power.

He gathered his thoughts, his gaze sweeping over the wooden fragments on the sea. "I don't know which outer sea this is, but people clearly live here... That’s convenient enough."

Li Ximing was not afraid of encountering some powerful expert here at the Sea's Cape, where spiritual qi was thin. Even if he was so heavily injured that his Dharma power failed and his body collapsed, killing a Foundation Establishment cultivator was merely a flick of his sleeve. As for Qi Refining or Embryonic Breathing cultivators, it would take nothing more than a puff of air or a sharp glare.

"Unless a Purple Mansion cultivator happens to be passing through, only then would I need to be cautious."

The flames on his body raged. Unwilling to scorch the coastline and leave obvious traces, Li Ximing used his Bright Yang divine ability to suppress them. But as he took two steps, the black fire within his Juque Palace surged, rising to contend equally with his own Bright Yang Purple Flame.

Li Ximing focused his divine ability inward to suppress it. Yet, the moment the black fire in his Juque Palace dimmed, the flames on the surface of his skin suddenly swelled, nearly breaking his containment and threatening to incinerate his surroundings.

"What a bizarre art. The inner and outer flames are a single entity. Suppress the external fire, and the Juque fire flourishes. Suppress the Juque fire, and the external fire rages... This must be from the Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage."

It was too inconvenient to deal with now. Li Ximing could only let the flames inside his Juque Palace rage temporarily as he rode his escape light forward, stepping once to appear in the forest at the island's center.

This forest was dotted with numerous villages. They had pale yellow thatched roofs and were mostly wooden structures; the better ones were merely crude stone-framed houses. Li Ximing scanned them. Based on this level of architecture, even if cultivators were present, they wouldn't exceed the Jade Capital Wheel realm.

As expected, when Li Ximing landed for a look, the inhabitants were all savages. They had no cultivation and were shouting in some barbarian tongue, babbling incomprehensibly.

His injuries were worsening, and he couldn't spare them much thought. He scanned again. There were over ten thousand savages gathered below. Though they lacked cultivation, they had their own survival methods, including a stone altar that was covered in bloody offerings from dissected animals. Red blood flowed down its sides, where a powerful-looking tiger demon crouched, lapping up the blood.

This tiger demon seemed to be at the Qi Refining realm. It looked like some wild, backwater species; not only was its cultivation impure, it didn't even know how to properly refine the blood offerings, merely lapping them up raw. Li Ximing couldn't be bothered to give it a second glance. He raised a finger and blew lightly.

A wisp of purple flame shot from the air and landed on the ground. The tiger demon had no time to react; it was still lapping at the blood when it was instantly incinerated into ash. The area below exploded into chaos. The crowd of kowtowing savages stared, dumbfounded. After a moment, seeming to conclude their god had departed on the wind, they gathered the remaining offerings and quickly retreated.

'It’s lucky for them it was me who arrived. Had it been another Purple Mansion cultivator, this group of barbarians—not even my own species—wouldn't have amounted to two mouthfuls.'

Li Ximing glanced away, then activated the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, channeling the *Mountain-Chasing Profound Evasion* art to escape into the earth beneath the island.

He had spent a long time searching in the Great Void before selecting this specific island. Although its spiritual qi was thin, its earth veins, water veins, and fire veins were all complete and sufficiently complex. The terrain was also stable and wouldn't be easily disturbed, making it suitable for his recovery. After all, he didn't know how to set up arrays, and he was injured; if he healed in an ordinary place, the leakage of his power would soon sprout Bright Radiant Sky Stones, gray cicadas, or gardenias, attracting unnecessary suspicion.

After traveling deep into the earth veins, Li Ximing found a gentle junction where the earth and water veins intersected. He casually set down a simple array disk and sat cross-legged. The fire in his Juque Palace was already burning uncontrollably. He activated his *Audience with the Celestial Gate* divine ability, and it flashed, slamming down hard internally.

*Boom!*

Intense black flames instantly erupted from his body, accompanied by a violent tremor that spread outward. The fire, deep within the earth, immediately began to gather the earth-baleful qi, roasting the surrounding veins until they roiled.

The *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* was clearly extraordinary, especially having been cast at full power by a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator like Changxiao who had already crossed an immortal threshold. The curse was astonishingly stubborn. His attempt to suppress it not only failed to wear it down but instead stimulated its full power, causing turmoil throughout the earth veins.

Li Ximing couldn't stop himself from spitting out another mouthful of blood, which he instantly incinerated. He activated *Audience with the Celestial Gate* at full power, forcing all the black flames out of his Juque Palace and redirecting them to his sides.

Although Li Ximing had never studied the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art*, he was beginning to understand it. The curse was clearly designed to grow stronger and stronger after impact, but his own *Audience with the Celestial Gate* divine ability specialized in suppression and refinement, which was the only reason the curse hadn't been able to advance an inch.

He was not afraid. Activating *Audience with the Celestial Gate* fully, it manifested within his Juque Palace as the ornate, bright-white celestial gate. The dragon banners and luan-drawn chariots within its heavenly glows all transformed into pure light, beginning the arduous process of grinding the curse down, bit by bit.

Bright Yang was, after all, the core Dao lineage of the former northern hegemon, the Wei state. Barring a few specific counter-lineages, its flaws were pitifully few. *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was not only supported by his Dharma Body, it could stand against a tyrannical curse like the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* without backing down. As one of the premier divine abilities for suppression and refinement, it immediately bore down on the black flames, causing them to dim and begin fading at an agonizingly slow, but steady, rate.
