# Chapter 1002: Divine Sequence

A solemn stillness filled the great hall. Li Ximing listened silently to the report from below. At his side, Ding Weizeng spoke, his voice low and heavy with grief.

"Daoist Master," he began, "for the past two years, Xuanxin has been by my side, guarding the riverbank. He fought back the demonic cultivators and hunted down subversive Buddhist cultivators. His contributions were immense...

"Today, I received an order from Young Master Zhoufang to report to the Milin. I left him waiting alone on the mountain... I never imagined he would be struck by the karmic fire."

Below the dais, Li Jiangxia kept his gaze lowered. A young man in white robes, adorned with jade, stepped out from behind him. He was handsome, but his face was slick with tears. He fell to his knees beside Ding Weizeng and spoke through his sobs, his voice respectful.

"My younger brother died serving Moongaze Lake. He has honored the trust of our fathers!"

The An family's bloodline was known to be exceptional. This was An Xuantong, An Xuanxin's older brother, who had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm at nearly the same time. He had served Li Jiangxia for many years and was the Third Young Master's most capable aide.

As for the Third Young Master himself, normally known for his hearty and forthright demeanor, his face was now dark, his eyes filled with sorrow.

Li Jiangxia had managed the Wilderness for many years. The karmic fire had burned it all to cinders, and his losses were catastrophic. Whether it was the trusted aides he had personally promoted or the network of support built by his mother's family, everything was wiped out in a single stroke.

His only stroke of luck was this: Li Jiangxia had worried his second brother would reassign his core followers while he was in seclusion. So, apart from An Xuanxin, who was with Ding Weizeng, his other key subordinates like An Xuantong and Wan Qi had already returned to the mountain to enter seclusion. They had been spared from the Wilderness disaster. If not for that, Li Jiangxia would truly have no one left to command.

By the same token, the loss for Li Jiangxia's maternal clan, the An family, was even more devastating. It wasn't just the death of their new generational talent, An Xuanxin. Forty percent of the An family's entire network of retainers and allies had been stationed in the Wilderness. Now, they were nothing but ash. If An Siwei hadn't taken a large group to the Eastern Sea, the situation would be even more calamitous.

An Xuantong's heart felt like it was bleeding. He remained kneeling, his head bowed to the floor.

While Li Ximing didn't often concern himself with the clan's internal appointments, the political undercurrents here were obvious. If Li Jiangxia and the An family hadn't held such significant power in the Wilderness, his own confidant, Ding Weizeng, wouldn't have been stationed there. Nor would Li Zhouwei have arranged for Li Jiangliang to train under Cui Jueyin, who oversaw Milin. The Daoist Master knew exactly which faction had been hit the hardest. He sighed softly.

"You may rise."

The two men quickly rose. Li Ximing surveyed the hall.

"This fire in the east will not burn for long. For now, wait patiently. No one is to leave..."

He closed his eyes for a moment in thought.

"Weizeng... you said it was Zhoufang who summoned you to Milin? Where is Zhoufang?"

At his side, Li Minggong stepped forward and said respectfully: "When the turmoil began, Hall Guards were dispatched to secure the peaks and retrieve the cultivators from the various islands. He is currently taking inventory of the direct-line disciples from each branch. I will fetch him."

"That won't be necessary."

Li Ximing, however, recalled something. Years ago, during another disaster in the Wilderness, the brothers Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang had been stationed there. They should have been caught in the slaughter, but Li Zhoufang had a last-minute mishap that delayed his departure, allowing him to escape...

'That child has some real fortune about him... If not for him, Weizeng would most likely be dead as well.'

He pushed the thought aside, filing it away in his mind, and said softly:

"Although the great formation over the lake is now active and its purple light protects us, we cannot lower our guard. Everyone is to remain on the island. Send more scouts out to gather information."

"Yes."

Li Jianglong stepped forward and answered respectfully. Li Ximing then turned his head to Li Jiangzong.

"Jiangzong, you may take your medicine and enter seclusion. Great turmoil is coming. If you do not break through now, you may not find such a favorable spiritual environment again."

"Yes!"

After Li Jiangzong affirmed, Li Ximing's gaze shifted to Li Zhouda. He was surprised to find the young man's cultivation was solid, his Thunder Pool dense, and he possessed a notable presence. Li Ximing nodded in approval.

"The same applies to you. Once you are past the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, stabilize your cultivation for two years, then come find me on the mountain."

Li Zhouda had been unremarkable in his youth; no one had expected him to possess such prowess. Li Ximing was pleasantly surprised. Reaching the Purple Mansion Realm was clearly unrealistic for him, but there was no need to be frugal. A single Talisman Pill could elevate Li Zhouda to the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm, adding another capable fighter to their ranks.

He settled the affairs for each of them, bestowing dharma artifacts and medicinal pills as needed, and then dismissed the assembly. Only Li Xuanxuan remained. At last, Li Zhouwei spoke.

"Demon King Qingyan from the West Sea sent word, inviting you to visit, Grand-uncle. Given the current situation..."

Li Ximing simply shook his head. "I was already hesitant. Now, it is impossible to leave."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "While you were away in the Eastern Sea, Grand-uncle, Daoist Master Zhong Qian of Chengshui Marsh broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm."

"Zhong Qian..."

Li Ximing's brows shot up, but he quickly shook his head with a trace of regret. He watched as Li Zhouwei turned to Li Xuanxuan and offered, after a moment's hesitation:

"Our family has a deep connection with him, but Chengyun has sided with the North. The future is... difficult to say. Back then, Azure Pond ordered our ancestor to use him to enter the grotto-heaven, yet he ended up helping our ancestor inside the Great Ning Palace. I remember our elder mentioned this to me... Perhaps he didn't know he was being used when he was at the Foundation Establishment Realm. But now that he's at the Purple Mansion Realm and allied against the South, he must be aware of the truth."

"Now that we stand on opposing sides, I fear our past relationship is meaningless. We may even face each other in battle. I have already repaid the favor we owed him with a gift of spiritual resources, clearing the debt. This way... if we must fight, there will be nothing outstanding between us."

Li Xuanxuan could only nod and sigh. Li Ximing looked at him, but decided against mentioning the matter of the "conversion," saying only:

"I went to the Eastern Sea, but I only managed to retrieve a single [Neck Feather]. Firstly, [Wall-Sinking Water] was exceptionally scarce. Secondly, the Eastern Sea itself is in turmoil. That Daoist Master Miao of Thunder-Hearing Island is in open conflict with the Southern Songzhou Luoshe, and chaos has broken out in several other areas. Many of the major markets have closed."

He shook his head, lamenting, "It is truly an age of great chaos. I asked Senior Liu about Daoist Traditions related to formations, and I swallowed my pride to request an inheritance in the Dao of Formations from him. Fortunately, Senior Liu is as generous as ever and did not disappoint. He immediately brought out what I asked for."

"According to him, one of the foremost is the 'Vault-Beam Silver' path from his 'Vault Metal' tradition. While the art is profound, it's unsuitable for cultivation—even if one wished to, the necessary qi no longer exists. However, he did have a copy of the precious [Sacred Scroll of the Star Court], which belongs to the 'Dwelling in the Southern Balance' path of the Heaven–Governing Dao."

"As for the other Daoist Traditions that aid in formations, there are two more from the Heaven–Governing: 'Celestial-Awakening Ear' and 'Divine Sequence.' There is also 'Attaining Brightness' from the Upper Rite tradition, and the Wandering Metal path, though its lineage is now severed. And of course, one of the Wu Earth paths... but those are far beyond our reach."

Li Ximing set down his cup. His divine ability rippled faintly as he gave an order.

"Have Suining come up."

The attendant outside the hall hurried away. Li Xuanxuan's expression turned serious.

"Minghuang! I've asked around! This child's ability to comprehend formations just by reading is in no way inferior to your own talent in the Dao of Alchemy back in the day. He is an exceptionally rare genius!"

Li Zhouwei looked thoughtful, but Li Ximing just laughed.

"We are all family here, Grand-uncle, no need to spare my 'face.' Do I have the talent to create pills just by reading a book? He achieved this while struggling by the lake. Even Ning Wan was only his equal back in her day. If not for this, I would never have made a special trip to the Eastern Sea just for him!"

Before long, someone arrived. He paid his respects outside the great hall, his voice trembling with barely contained excitement:

"Junior Suining pays his respects to the two Daoist Masters!"

"Enter."

Li Ximing inclined his head slightly.

The young man pushed open the door and entered. He glimpsed the Heavenly Light from beyond, but dared not raise his head. He walked to the foot of the dais and kowtowed again, pressing his forehead to the cool floor. Only when he was close did he hear an old man's kind voice.

"Rise."

Li Suining felt a light touch on his arm. The old man had risen and was helping him up. Li Suining finally raised his eyes and saw the elder before him, dressed in ink-blue robes. His hair was gray, but his eyes were sharp and full of spirit as he smiled down at him.

In his past life, Li Suining hadn't met him many times. But at every meeting, the old man had always helped him up, and he would feel the weight of pills and resources slipped into his sleeve. Later, Li Xuanxuan's health had failed, and he rarely made public appearances. Suining had only heard that he returned to Lijing the day before he passed. Li Suining had been away and never saw him a final time.

"A fine child, truly rare!"

"Mm."

That sound was gentle yet profound. It came from Li Ximing on the dais, and Li Suining immediately turned his head.

Radiance rippled through the hall. Blinding Heavenly Light spilled from behind the main throne, silhouetting the Daoist Master who sat there, dressed in white and gold. A brilliant light shone from his brow, making him appear like a god.

Standing beside him was a tall young man in opulent black and gold robes, turned partially away. His powerful, steady hands held a teapot, pouring a stream of clear tea into a cup with a soft, trickling sound.

Li Suining hadn't seen him in so many years. His heart trembled, and he was so overcome with emotion he wanted to weep. He quickly lowered his gaze.

'King Wei!'

The young man before him was the White Qilin Among Men, the warlord who had carved a bloody path from Jiangbei to the lands of Dai. He was the only King-Marquis in the world who could force the great powers of both North and South to retreat, a man truly worthy of being an emperor...

But all those titles were not what moved Li Suining so deeply. The Li family of that era had grown accustomed to it; accustomed to this King Wei suppressing the North and South, forcing the Zhi Xuan, Feng Wu, and Zheng Huai clans to bow their heads. They were accustomed to his invincibility... until the day the news reached Moongaze Lake that the Second Manifestation had appeared over the Wei capital, and the Supreme Yang had lost its light. On that day, the spirit of the entire Li family broke. A terror unlike any before seized them. Even the clan factions, who had been arguing red-faced with each other, were utterly lost, weeping and clinging to one another in despair that night...

How could Li Suining, who had lived through those three sunless days, not be shaken? He prostrated on the floor, a new fear rising in his heart.

'Can I really hide anything from him?'

Drip.

The tea filled the cup seventy percent. The young man set down the pot. His golden eyes turned, flashing with faint surprise. He took a single step forward, his gaze landing on Suining, but he did not speak.

Li Ximing had met Suining earliest and was more familiar with him. He nodded with a smile, retrieving a stone box from his sleeve. With a wave, the box opened, revealing three jade slips. He placed them gently on the table, his expression turning serious.

"I went to the Eastern Sea and procured three cultivation arts for the family."

"The first is the Art of the Star Court, obtained from Daoist Master Yuanbian. It leads to the 'Profound Dipper's Balance' achievement, known in ancient times as 'Dwelling in the Southern Balance.' It allows one to calculate positions, arrange forces, and shift spiritual energies. It is said to be immensely beneficial for controlling formation flags."

Hearing this, Li Suining knew his previous guess had been correct. It was all clear now.

'The Art of the Golden Tablet was sent from the Eastern Sea! In this life, because the Daoist Master went personally, they avoided the dangers of my past life and definitely retrieved the complete [Sacred Scroll of the Star Court]. The Art of the Star Court must be the Qi Refining portion of that scroll!'

He breathed a sigh of relief, but a new surge of joy and doubt immediately followed.

'Three arts? That's one more than in my past life?'

The Daoist Master before him continued calmly:

"This second art, also from Daoist Master Yuanbian, is called the Great Void Revolution Art. It leads to the 'Divine Sequence.' It allows one to calculate profound orders, shift the tides of worldly affairs, and even serves as a divine office."

'...Calculate profound orders, shift the tides of worldly affairs, and serve as a divine office...'

Those words made Li Suining freeze. An impulse rose from deep within him, making his skin crawl and his heart pound.

"Finally... there is the 'Attaining Brightness' path from the Upper Rite tradition. The art is decent, and the Spiritual Qi it requires is easy to gather, but it would take a year or two... It can alter terrain and spiritual veins to form arrays. And then there is the Art of the Watchful Awakening Star, an ancient art already in the clan's vault. It allows one to perceive the words of others, but unfortunately, its grade is not high."

Li Ximing looked at him with a smile, as if asking for his choice, but also as if posing the question to the old man and Li Zhouwei.

"You must choose carefully!"

Li Zhouwei's gaze swept over the slips, his thoughts clear.

'Since Grand-uncle brought them out, he must have consulted the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. There must be follow-up Dao Lineages for these arts available for trade. Otherwise, he would never let this child cultivate a mere third-grade art...'

The three of them pondered, but Li Suining, kneeling below, had heard Li Ximing's words clearly. He analyzed them, his mind racing at full speed.

'In my past life, time was short. Just delivering the art was enough. It was sufficient for the next generation; it wasn't meant for me...'

'But now, the Daoist Master went himself, so he brought back two extra arts. These two... perhaps they are even more helpful to the Dao of Formations, or perhaps they are better suited for Moongaze Lake's current situation. But it most likely means that even Daoist Master Yuanbian doesn't have the follow-up paths for them...'

But for him, Li Suining, did the follow-up path even matter? He knew his own cultivation speed. Although he had wasted a lot of time in his past life, by the day he was forced to flee to the Southern Borderlands, he was still only at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. Even if he truly had the chance to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm in this life, amidst all this turmoil... could he really enter seclusion with a clear conscience?

Even if he succeeded, it would help the situation, but it would still be insignificant. Where would he rank in the wider world? But if he failed, the entire clan would inevitably slide back into the abyss of his past life!

He didn't hesitate. He instantly gave up on the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court—which was actually a fifth-grade art with a higher potential future—and raised his head, his eyes burning with conviction.

"Daoist Master, we are in an age of upheaval! This junior wishes to cultivate the Great Void Revolution Art. With a greater ability to calculate and predict, I can better contribute to the clan!"

Li Ximing smiled and glanced at the young man beside him. Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod.

"Good."

Li Ximing said warmly, "Have your grand-uncle take you into the inner formation to prepare for seclusion."

"Yes!"

Li Suining's eyes were slightly red. He gave a deep bow to all three figures and respectfully retreated from the hall. Not until his shadow had vanished down the profound steps did the old man speak in praise.

"Remarkable!"

Li Ximing chuckled and stood up. He took a jet-black jade slip from his sleeve and handed it to Li Xuanxuan.

"This is Senior Liu's [Sutra of Profound Iteration]. It is the culmination of his life's work in the Dao of Formations—unfathomably profound and extremely precious. I'll entrust it to you, Grand-uncle. Give it to the child when he emerges from seclusion."

The complete inheritance from a Purple Mansion Realm formation master was priceless. Li Xuanxuan hurriedly stood to receive it, tucking it away with extreme care. Li Zhouwei, meanwhile, casually stepped down from the dais.

"[Sacred Scroll of the Star Court]... We'll hold onto it, then."

The young man and his grand-uncle shared a look of perfect understanding. He heard Li Ximing's voice transmit via divine ability:

'The scroll in the vault that resonates with the Great Void Revolution Art is called the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence. Go and exchange it for him.'
