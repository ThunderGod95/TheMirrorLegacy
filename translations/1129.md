# Chapter 1129: Duty and Private Sentiments

West Curtain Sea.

The moonlight was clear and bright, casting shimmering reflections across the undulating waves. Suddenly, a divine ability streaked through the air, resolving into two figures, one chasing the other. Two Daoist Masters had arrived.

The one in front wore a Daoist robe, three brocade pouches tied at his waist. He carried a long, green-bamboo-like staff over one shoulder. Tied to its end, a cluster of small, jade-carved swords clinked crisply against each other.

His attire was rather strange. He had the look of a middle-aged man, his skin reddish, his expression severe. His eyes were half-closed, lost in thought.

Following him was an old man in magnificent, formal robes. His face, however, was deathly pale, and a look of pained reluctance flickered in his eyes. Seeing the first man remain silent for so long, he finally ventured,

"Daoist Friend Xie...?"

The Daoist Master he called Xie seemed to snap out of a trance. He let out a long breath.

"Senior... truly incredible!"

"The shamanic talismans in that abode are astounding, and the mystic realm of the abode itself is no less so... If someone with sufficient Dao-Profundity were inside... they could even use it to evade or repel an enemy... I even suspect... that the entire abode can be taken and stored!"

These two were none other than Yan Dushui and Xie Hu.

The distance between the Western Sea and the West Curtain Sea was vast. The Li family had long since concluded their business, but it seemed these two had only just now seen the immortal abode. Daoist Master Xie Hu's eyes were slightly red as he spoke, deeply moved.

"May I ask... that expert your ancestor met all those years ago... what was he like?"

This made Yan Dushui fall silent. After a long time, he said:

"For generations, my ancestors have guessed he was a figure from the Underworld. But at the time... the word he spoke was 'Immortal'."

Xie Hu's expression was grave.

"This person, I'm afraid, is not one of the Three Profoundities."

"My Dao Lineage cultivates the Shaman-Register. Our ancestral inheritance is ancient. My own grandmaster once sparred with that Duanmu Kui; they had something of a friendship. He had a deep understanding of both the Three Profoundities and the Shaman-Register's legacy."

"Whether this expert was from the Underworld, I do not know. But even if he was, he must have been an unorthodox practitioner who became a ghost and joined the Underworld."

Although Yan Dushui had guarded this treasure land for many years, his family line was not of the Upper Shaman or Merging Owl Dao Lineages. He couldn't distinguish the subtleties, nor did he particularly care. After listening, he just sighed.

"I only hope it was of some help to you, Daoist Friend..."

"Help... that's hard to say."

Xie Hu's expression was complicated, half-joyful and half-sorrowful.

"My grandmaster once discussed the Profound Dao with Duanmu Kui. That Daoist Master, whose name once shook the north and south, said this, 'The Upper Shaman appears empty but is truly obscure, existing only to answer the fallen. If I were to master it, I fear I would lose my life-mandate."

Though Yan Dushui lived at the edge of the world, he had heard of Duanmu Kui. He was stunned.

"I heard he was utterly tyrannical, obstinate and arrogant, claiming to be enlightened by an immortal, his power endless. He actually said something like that?"

"Immortals... there isn't just one. If the Underworld had no immortals, how could it have survived from antiquity until today?"

Xie Hu's expression dimmed.

"My grandmaster tried to persuade him, 'The immortal spoke of obtaining gold, but must it be the gold of the Upper Shaman? There are other paths above, great hope remains.'"

"But you are right. That senior was obstinate and arrogant, tyrannical and arbitrary. He charged down that single road to his death. Even someone as brilliant as him... could not achieve the Dao. Who else in the world would dare try?"

The middle-aged man turned to look at Yan Dushui and thanked him solemnly.

"Old senior, the supreme profound talismans carved in this abode contain great meaning in subtle words. This junior has benefited immensely. But no matter how profound the talismans, they cannot compare to the immortal scripture of that era. Duanmu Kui failed. What hope does this junior have? I cultivate the Upper Shaman, but my path of seeking the Dao lies outside it. This talisman does not aid my quest!"

Yan Dushui stood frozen, speechless for a long time, a pang of sorrow welling in his heart. But then Xie Hu's tone shifted. He lowered his gaze.

"However, with this wall of profound talismans, passing the Purple Mystery is now possible! This is an immeasurable kindness!"

The old man finally let out his breath, overjoyed.

"That's wonderful... wonderful!"

A wave of delight washed over him, and he was already scheming how to report the good news to Li Ximing, to squeeze every last drop of benefit from the information Xie Hu had provided.

Seeing the old man's deathly pale face, still muttering to himself, a trace of pity flashed in Xie Hu's eyes.

"I know what senior seeks," he said softly. "But senior... seeking the Dao is for oneself, to roam the heavens and earth. That is the true Great Dao of cultivation. Why must you place your hopes in your descendants? It is a grave error. You possess a divine ability, after all. If you are willing, I can use certain shamanic arts to dissolve that divine ability. You could live for several more decades... perhaps a new opportunity would arise?"

Yan Dushui's face lit up at the first half of the sentence, but the second half made him turn and stare blankly at Xie Hu. Seeing the man standing high-spirited under the moonlight, the old man laughed.

"Without your grandmaster, how could you be here today, seeking the Dao for yourself, roaming the heavens and earth? Be it a Dao Lineage or one's descendants, it is not a 'placed hope,' it is a fulfillment. It is in no way inferior to you Dao-seekers. A pitiful, prolonged life is useless. If achieving the Dao cannot be for myself, then it will be for those I entrust!"

Xie Hu watched him quietly. He could see the man's divine sense scattering, his dharma essence fluttering, even causing snowflakes to drift down around them. Yet the old man's face was wreathed in smiles, his words landing with unshakeable force. Xie Hu nodded gravely and cupped his hands.

"This junior has been taught."

...

Simin.

The sky was just beginning to brighten, but the road had grown cold again. The rumble of wheels echoed before the gate as a young man in profound-black robes stepped down from a sedan. The great crimson doors swung open, and a young boy was the first to run out.

The child was delicately featured, his steps light. A heavy, golden light settled in his eyes, but his face was all smiles. He stopped excitedly before the gate, staring at the young man.

"Fourth Uncle... you're back from the court assembly."

A smile instantly bloomed on Li Jiangliang's face. He took the boy's small hand.

"It's Suichu's birthday. Fourth Uncle didn't forget..."

He slipped an object from his wide, blue-black sleeve. It was a round, walnut-sized pearl, glowing with an intense radiance. The child accepted it with pure delight. As they walked inside together, a girl stood by the threshold of the inner courtyard, hiding behind the doorway. She showed only half her face, smiling shyly at him,

"Fourth Uncle..."

Her smile was expectant, her eyes fixed on his sleeve. Li Jiangliang's smile widened. He retrieved a small, palm-sized mirror.

"I could never forget Zhi'er!"

The child's eyes lit up as she took it. After a polite thank-you, she lifted the hem of her dress and ran to chase her brother. Li Jiangliang watched with a smile as the two children vanished, roughhousing, into the depths of the corridor, before he finally entered the courtyard.

His elder brother was in simple, plain clothes, his cuffs rolled up. He held a pair of small, white jade scissors, his head bowed as he inspected the plum blossoms in a porcelain vase. Pink petals were scattered around him.

Li Jiangliang stepped forward and bowed. Li Jiangxia smiled.

"It must have been difficult for you... insisting on having me transferred back to the capital so I wouldn't miss the little ones' birthdays. Suichu is easy enough to handle, but Zhi'er is terribly hard to please..."

Compared to when they had first entered the court, the two brothers were clearly much closer.

"Both children are close to you, and they have gentle temperaments," Li Jiangliang replied. "Lady Zou has taught them well."

Li Jiangxia led him to a seat and shook his head.

"You're wrong there. Suichu is mischievous, not nearly as steady as Suihuan. Li Jianglong might not have much else to his name, but he's truly gifted at siring sons. That's the only thing I envy him for."

This prominent official of the Great Song, the Emissary of the True Light Cloud, received the rebuke without the slightest change in expression. He only sighed.

"Big Brother's divine ability is imminent; he won't be having any more heirs. Suihuan is being raised as the main heir of the Li family, and he's living up to it. He has the makings of a divine ability... Suichu was born in the imperial capital... he hasn't experienced as much..."

His brother just laughed, not holding back.

"You're being far too polite. Everyone says our Li family has three Holders of the Profound. You rule the court, and I have illustrious prestige. But we both know that those of us who end up as Holders of the Profound here... are the ones who already lost the fight on Moongaze Lake. We're a step behind."

"And Suichu? Born in the imperial capital, everyone calls him 'Young Master.' Is that a good thing? He's a Bright Yang blood descendant, same as the others, but my son growing up in the deep palace courtyards. He has shouldered no responsibilities, seen nothing of the world. When he meets his clan cousin in the future, he'll be consumed by his own inferiority."

"It's just Li Jianglong's dumb luck. He had a child early and got the Daoist Master himself to bestow a name."

Hearing his brother say all this, Li Jiangliang found it difficult to respond. He shook his head.

"I heard... Father went to the Western Sea."

Li Jiangxia's expression turned solemn.

"Your information is sharp, as always... Did something happen?"

Li Jiangliang gave a bitter smile.

"What else could it be... My wife complained about the matter of the bestowed treasure. She said the Heavenly Nurture Urn was the Emperor's own fortunate encounter, not something from the Yang family, and that it has a wondrous power to... store, suppress, and seize essence..."

He raised an eyebrow and sighed.

"You know Father's personality... He went all the way to the Western Sea and captured a Demon King with two divine abilities. I heard he didn't even lift a finger—just one divine ability and one Spiritual Treasure. He scared the robes off that crowd of rogue cultivators."

Li Jiangxia was silent for a moment.

"With Father's current divine ability, I'm afraid even the Grand General wouldn't dare claim a certain victory against him!"

Li Jiangliang sighed.

"Isn't that the truth? And just when Western Shu is stretched too thin and Northern Zhao is a headless horde..."

Li Jiangxia shot him a glance.

"The stronger Father's divine ability becomes, the more they'll be wary of the consequences, and the more helpless they'll be against him. The day he reaches the Eastern Sea, none of you will even be able to see him clearly!"

Li Jiangliang was taken aback. He raised a hand.

"They are also acting out of good intentions."

His words were an explanation, but his brother didn't press the point.

"I hear the abbot of the Great Konghai Temple has returned to his position, and there are rumors stirring in Shitang again..."

Li Jiangliang gave a few distracted replies, seemingly lost in thought. After a long while, he asked,

"Since you came from the north, did you pass over the lake? Did you see Father?"

Li Jiangxia paused.

"Naturally, I passed over the lake... but Sima Yuanli was on guard. I didn't see Father. Isn't he still in the Western Sea?"

This made the young man lower his gaze slightly, though he smiled.

"That's also a matter for congratulations. The Grand General is transferring me to the north to assist with the defense. I'll have to travel via the lake as well. It will be a perfect chance to see Father and offer him my congratulations."

His brother laughed.

"Then you'd better be careful! Ting Province is a land where Martial Cultivation doesn't shine. The feeling of being knocked from the Holder of the Profound realm is not pleasant!"

Li Jiangliang just smiled, said his farewells, and stepped back into the sedan. He heard the crack of a whip and a shout. An illusory, multicolored light flashed, and pedestrians on both sides turned to stare.

Radiance flickered outside, but the inside of the sedan was dark and gloomy. A woman in white sat quietly, her expression heavy. The moment she saw him, she spoke,

"How did it go?"

Li Jiangliang shook his head.

"You're overthinking. Even if Father saw my brother, he would just offer words of encouragement. At most, he'd ask about the two children. Why would he possibly speak about his gains?"

The woman's expression remained heavy.

"I can't help but be suspicious. That Qu Qian of Mount Luoxia was from the same era as the Six Scions of Chongming, a cultivator who listened to lectures at the True Monarch's side. His power was immense, and it's highly likely he was acting on the True Monarch's instructions... It's a play by the Lesser Yang lineage."

"That's precisely why that little demon Shehu, with no backing and no obvious divine ability, was able to survive for five hundred years. The business with Daoist Master Zhaojing was an accident... but I fear there's something fishy about it."

Li Jiangliang lowered his gaze, his tone calm,

"What could possibly be fishy?"

Yang Tianyou paused, sensing his discomfort, and lowered her voice.

"Mount Luoxia always acts in extremes. Either they play at being lofty immortals, or they bring out their Dharma Treasures and doom people to eternal ruin. Even... even True Monarchs face the peril of ancient powers reappearing to fight over the five forms... With all those Dharma Treasures high above, how can we not be cautious?"

"Lesser Yang is practically Comprehending Profoundity's forbidden preserve. And given the current situation—Veiled Yin has collapsed, Lesser Yin has departed, Bright Yang has fallen, Lesser Yang is divided, and Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang are annihilated from history... This is not something we should be touching. Especially anything related to the complete Lesser Yang."

Li Jiangliang frowned.

"The items have already been divided by Father. What is there to worry about? I'll make the trip and ask him clearly. As for what else might have been in that abode, Mount Luoxia itself knows best!"

This high official of the Great Song always presented a gentle face, but her repeated attempts to make him probe his own family had clearly crossed a line. A sharp light flashed in his golden eyes, and he gritted his teeth.

"They plot against my family, and in return, my family has to live in fear, worrying if we've displeased them in some small way... In my opinion... that Wu Light is more tyrannical than any Bright Yang!"

As soon as he said it, Yang Tianyou subconsciously scanned the black qi swirling around them, terrified a third person might hear.

"The mainland is 'on the board,' so anything goes. But the Western Sea is 'off the board,' where any trick is permissible. I just hope that when you go back and ask, you'll warn Zhaojing to be careful..."

Li Jiangliang shot her a glance and sighed.

"The Daoist Master is your elder, too."

Yang Tianyou realized that in her anxiety, she had misspoken, using Li Ximing's Daoist title directly. She lowered her gaze.

"I... misspoke..."

She was quiet for a long moment, then said, sounding wronged,

"My love... I'm... I'm only thinking of you. Besides me, who cares if Ting Province interferes with the Lesser Yang's plans? I overhear a few scraps of their idle talk, and I have to come and ask you in secret..."

Li Jiangliang's brow relaxed.

"I know what's in your heart," he said softly. "I just... I can't stomach the injustice of it."

Yang Tianyou wiped her tears and leaned against his shoulder, a secret sorrow in her heart.

'In the entire Yang family, the only one who hopes King Wei achieves the Dao—who dreams of surviving after he achieves it... is me. My sisters all laugh at my naivety... But am I doing this just to have a Bright Yang True Monarch as an uncle-in-law? I am a person of the Underworld. Sooner or later, I must return to it. I don't care about the Li family at all... I am only thinking of your life-mandate...'

Her tears fell like rain, spattering on the man's blue-purple robes. Held aloft by dharma power, they glittered like pearls. Li Jiangliang stroked her hair.

"You'er," he said softly, "I know your heart."
