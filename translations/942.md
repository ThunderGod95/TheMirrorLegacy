# Chapter 942: The Valley Water Dao

The moment he opened his mouth, a whistling wind rose from the pitch-black void within. Shadowy forms coiled like serpents, accompanied by the faint _drip, drip, drip_ of water. The ambient light in the sky dimmed once more, eclipsed by the deepening abyss of his maw.

But those golden eyes weren't the only things illuminating the heavens. A brilliant light flared to life between Li Zhouwei's brows!

**[Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light]**

Murong Yan's Spiritual Artifact had struck the Pure Yang Bracelets, its power neutralized. After a fractional delay, Li Zhouwei's divine ability flared in response. His power surged to the point between his brows as he instantly activated Concealed Plunder Gold to augment his attack—the most profound Bright Yang spell art he had mastered since he began his cultivation!

A resplendent golden radiance erupted, forming an inverted, cone-shaped halo of divine ability at his brow. It expanded to the size of a large basin before solidifying into a massive golden pillar of light that blasted downward.

Murong Yan was ready. His eyes shifted to a pure, violet-black. His mouth swelled instantly, tearing open from ear to ear. Refusing nothing, he lunged forward and swallowed the entirety of the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

The violet-black energy swirling within his mouth spun like a deep-sea vortex, constantly interfering with the radiance blasting from his opponent's brow, attempting to twist it, shatter it, and break the casting.

"Boom!"

In an instant, the cultivators stationed on the riverbanks threw up their hands to shield their eyes, their faces awash in blinding light. The sky was split in two, as if by a knife's edge: one half blazed with brilliant radiance, the other was plunged into starless dark, a division that stretched far along the river.

"Omm..."

The intense glare faded as quickly as it came. All eyes on both banks immediately locked onto the incomparably brilliant pillar of light in the sky. The iridescent glow from Li Zhouwei's brow was incredibly stable, pulsing steadily as it resisted the torsional force from his opponent's maw, demonstrating an exceptionally high degree of control over his Dao arts!

Yet Murong Yan neither dodged nor retreated. His cavernous mouth, like a bottomless pit, continued to devour every last ray of the incoming light.

Thick, bright light and fire began to overflow, streaming from the corners of his torn mouth. They trailed behind him like two long, silken waterfalls before breaking apart into a meteor shower of fire that rained down upon the earth.

These two cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm... in their very first exchange, they were already locked in a direct contest of divine abilities and dharma power!

The cultivators on both banks held their breath in unison. Even the man on the distant, flame-arched bridge abruptly rose to his feet, his gaze fixed on the sky.

"Bang! ...Omm..."

A violent, searing sound echoed through the air. Li Zhouwei's entire face was illuminated by the radiance blazing from his brow, yet his golden eyes remained sharp and clear. They grew steadily brighter, his pupils shifting from a dark, antique gold to a brilliant, living gold.

As he poured more of his divine ability into the attack, the pillar of light at his brow expanded, swelling in size and power!

A grating, ear-piercing screech filled the air. Though the fiend in mid-air, wreathed in roiling grey smoke, remained expressionless, his burly form was being forcibly pushed backward, inch by inch, as he struggled to dissipate the surging radiance of the divine ability.

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was only a fourth-grade spell art, but with the augmentation from Concealed Plunder Gold, it was already comparable to an average fifth-grade art. Furthermore, Li Zhouwei had cultivated it for many years.

More critically, Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was, at its core, an art of Bright Yang radiance. Its power _increased_ in a direct confrontation. As the stalemate continued, the might of the spell art was still climbing, moment by moment!

Murong Yan's own arts were clearly profound, as he still appeared to have energy in reserve. But how could he simply watch as his opponent's divine ability climbed to new heights? He allowed the force to push him back a yard or so, a controlled retreat to help dissipate the power, while his eyes abruptly blazed with a new light.

But Li Zhouwei had already acted. His arms relaxed, extending straight out to his sides, his fingers splayed. In the center of each palm, a lustrous, silk-like golden light shimmered into existence.

**[Radiant Celestial Wave Art]**!

The silken strands shot out like agile serpents, coiling around Murong Yan's body and binding him fast, dragging him closer. Simultaneously, Li Zhouwei's own divine ability surged to its absolute peak. A faint, ethereal celestial gate even began to manifest behind him as he pushed Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light to its very limit!

Murong Yan's expression finally shifted. A torrent of demonic qi erupted from his body, coalescing into silver, viper-scale armor that covered him in an instant. It was a suit of spiritual clothing!

'A spirit embryo...'

The Radiant Celestial Wave Art was not a high-grade art to begin with. Faced with the wondrous vibrations of a spirit embryo, Li Zhouwei's hastily-formed attack couldn't hold. In an instant, the golden silks shattered into glittering motes of light and dissipated.

'What a pity...'

A flash of regret crossed Li Zhouwei's eyes. The fiend had finally gained a moment's respite. A silver arc of light flared, blocking the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. It vanished as quickly as it appeared, exploding with a deafening thunderclap. In that instant, the Heavenly Light and purple flames surged forward, pushing the dividing line between the two celestial phenomena several feet further, casting the bright radiance all the way out over the great river.

But Murong Yan himself had vanished.

"Whoosh!"

An instant later, a chorus of whistles filled the air. Vaguely, a phantom maw opened somewhere along the riverbank. From it erupted a shower of crimson-red, dazzlingly bright meteors, all tinged with the color of Bright Yang! In a flash, they became a deluge raining down from the heavens.

'What a formidable spell art!'

This rain of light was none other than the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light that Murong Yan had just swallowed. He had somehow converted the spell art, turning it into a sky-filling deluge of radiance and roiling flames that illuminated everything.

On both banks, cultivators and monks alike paled and scrambled for cover. Li Zhouwei, however, remained motionless on the mountainside, letting the shower of fiery light streak past him. He simply raised one hand, palm up. A speck of brilliant gold, mixed with an inky black flame, rose swiftly in his palm. From nothing, it began to coalesce, bit by bit, into a long halberd the color of the Golden Crow.

"Huu..."

Li Zhouwei flexed his long, powerful arm. He spun the newly-formed halberd, its tip pointing diagonally toward the ground, as he fixed his gaze on his opponent, who had reappeared in the distance.

'This is certainly an awkward time.' His primary weapon was currently being refined at the Viewing Pavilion Platform. Even with the addition of a priceless spiritual extract, the refining process was measured in _years_. And even if it weren't being refined, after the damage it sustained in the battle with Helian Wumeng, he wouldn't risk bringing it out just to be wasted.

As for his suit of scale armor, while he had secured a path to obtaining it, the forging itself could be months or even years away.

To make matters worse, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd at his waist was highly specialized. It was not only cumbersome, but its power would actually _decrease_ if an attack missed. It could only be used as a final trump card, not as a standard weapon.

He was, at this moment, effectively empty-handed. Even this temporary weapon had to be condensed into profound unity using a combination of the Sun's Resonant Radiance Art, his Bright Yang divine ability, and the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts!

How sharp was Murong Yan's gaze? He perceived Li Zhouwei's predicament at a glance. It wasn't that he didn't want to press his advantage, but he could only exhale deeply, coughing up two small specks of golden light.

'Supreme Yang power... That radiance didn't seem to be of a high grade, yet it packed quite a punch...'

Still, he cultivated Valley Water. When facing Supreme Yang power, he was far less vulnerable than Helian Wumeng was with his Baleful Qi. Murong Yan's own spell arts were of a higher grade, and his Dharma Art hadn't been broken—it was just a minor cough. What truly made him cautious, however, was that faint trace of fiend-breaking power embedded within his opponent's divine ability.

If not for that, Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light would never have affected him so strongly, forcing him to take a full breath to recover—a breath that gave his opponent just enough time to form a new attack!

'He has a strong foundation, after all. It carries a hint of the divine.'

He circulated his dharma power, quickly dissolving the last of the Supreme Yang power within him. As he did, Murong Yan's pupils constricted—the man wasn't retreating or defending. He was charging, halberd leveled straight at him!

"Good!"

The Spiritual Artifact in his hand, the River Wall Rod, snapped upward. Infused with the dense power of Valley Water and glowing with a metallic sheen, it met the oncoming halberd's thrust just in time.

"Screeech..."

Heavenly Light and purple flames erupted at the impact. The black-flamed halberd bent precariously as it clashed with the genuine Spiritual Artifact, but it held. Li Zhouwei's expression was impassive. With a slight twist of his wrist, he deflected the halberd. The tip scraped against the rod, kicking up a shower of violet sparks as it slid past the Spiritual Artifact. The shaft instantly snapped straight, and he redirected the thrust straight at the fiend's face. The divine power in the attack was undiminished—if anything, it was even stronger than before!

This single exchange piqued Murong Yan's interest. That was no ordinary weapon, and it had just clashed with a true Spiritual Artifact. The maneuver _looked_ simple, but to execute it required a high degree of both Dao-Profundity and weapon mastery. His thoughts raced.

'His skill isn't just in Bright Yang spell arts! His weapon mastery is impressive as well!'

Facing the glittering halberd tip, he tilted his head back slightly, exposing a thick, bullish neck as wide as his head. In a flash, his larynx tore open. From the fleshy rift emerged a woman's face, pale and beautiful, framed by unbound hair.

The woman smiled faintly. As the halberd's divine-ability-infused tip arrived, her ruby lips parted to reveal eight sharp teeth. With the speed of a thunderbolt, she bit down hard on the blade.

"Boom!"

Violet fire erupted as black qi billowed. Li Zhouwei's halberd felt as if it had been plunged into deep water or wedged in a crevice of solid steel. It was completely immobilized. The woman's hands, white as jade, emerged from beneath Murong Yan's armpits to grip the halberd's blade tightly.

Murong Yan's barrel-like torso rapidly deflated. His entire coarse skin-bag, like a set of ill-fitting clothes, hung from the woman's frame, revealing her own slender, elegant figure. Her beautiful eyes were a milky white, yet they radiated an icy chill.

"Kk-crack..."

It was, after all, only a weapon condensed from a divine ability. It emitted the sound of catastrophic failure. Li Zhouwei's eyes narrowed. He slammed his elbow down onto the halberd's shaft, putting his full weight behind it. The weapon could no longer bear the strain. The halberd's head _banged_ and exploded, showering the sky in black flames.

But through that cloud of dark fire, Li Zhouwei had already reversed his grip on the now-bare shaft. His thumb locked tight, he thrust forward in a sudden, violent motion—a hammer-strike aimed directly at the woman's brow!

"Splash!"

A spray of Valley Water scattered. The woman, who seemed to possess only the strength for that single bite, had no time to react before the hammer-blow shattered her into pieces. Amidst the exploding spray of Valley Water, the empty skin-bag drifted free, caught by a gust of wind and swept high into the sky.

Yet where she had stood, a large, jade-white hand shot out and seized the broken halberd shaft.

Murong Yan had reappeared. He was visibly leaner now, his bare upper body revealing defined, jade-white musculature. His face, too, had transformed into that of a handsome, sharp-featured, and martial man.

Only his eyes remained that deep, violet-black, radiating a billow of demonic qi.

His hand crushed the remnants of the halberd shaft, a sharp grinding sound coming from his palm. Far below, the fat skin-bag, carried by the wind, flopped down onto the brown rocks by the river like a discarded sack.

"Good... Even without a proper weapon... you are still this ferocious!"

He relaxed his grip slightly. A jade-white powder—the pulverized remnants of the shaft—drifted from his fingers, dissolving back into black flame and Heavenly Light. Murong Yan's eyes were now incredibly sharp and imperious, and a small smile touched his lips.

"Again!"

The shaft in Li Zhouwei's hand was now only three feet long. A scorching battle intent rose in his own eyes, and the flashing Heavenly Light around him was blinding. Diamond-shaped fragments of light appeared from the void, flowing along the shaft. As if time were reversing, the broken weapon reformed, restoring itself to its original state.

The long, rod-like weapon was once again in Murong Yan's grasp. His entire aura shifted. He soared into the air, gripping the rod with both hands and raising it high above his head. Every muscle in his body strained in unison. The Spiritual Artifact—not quite a sword, not quite a staff—suddenly changed. As he dove, it condensed a demonic blade of black qi as large as a house, and he brought it chopping down!

The halberd thrust straight up to meet it, tip against demonic blade. They exploded in mid-air. The halberd bent for a single, fleeting breath before a sharp _snap_ echoed through the sky.

"Twang!"

The condensed halberd could not hold. Starting from the tip, it disintegrated into a cloud of glittering fragments. The shaft in Li Zhouwei's hands exploded along with it, dissolving into motes of light. The River Wall Rod, its path now clear, whistled downward!

"Boom!"

A fog of black flame erupted, and the Heavenly Light in the sky dimmed abruptly. The aura of Sunless Deceit flared, causing all color to drain from the riverbanks below.

When the smoke cleared, Li Zhouwei was revealed, his two hands crossed in front of him. The River Wall Rod was pressed firmly against his open palms. A dense black qi surged from the point of contact, flowing over his hands and down his powerful arms.

Four slender, golden-white arms then burst from Li Zhouwei's back, bracing themselves in front of him to grip the jet-black River Wall Rod. Both men's divine abilities flared wildly as they became locked in a stalemate, frozen in mid-air.

Below, there was only silence. The battle between the two in the sky was fierce, and every spectator held their breath. Far beyond, in the Great Void, hidden gazes met in silent acknowledgment.

Murong Yan, however, seemed unconcerned. His first misjudgment was from not knowing his opponent's full arsenal; he wouldn't be fooled a second time. He had easily evaded the grasp of those extra arms, forcing Li Zhouwei to catch the rod with his palms instead.

But as he stared at those four slender, golden-white arms, his expression became uncertain for the first time, mirroring the reaction Helian Wumeng once had.

"A Profound Qi spell art... Is that the path of the Touba family?"

"Helian Wumeng never mentioned this!"

He was stunned for only a fraction of a second.

The stalemate broke as quickly as it had formed. The River Wall Rod leaped back of its own accord, spinning twice in the air before landing in its master's hand. But Murong Yan had already snapped his head up, his face illuminated by a new, brilliant light. The colorful clouds above were roiling as a behemoth, like a meteor from beyond the heavens, tore through the sky and descended!

_Audience with the Celestial Gate_!

A brilliant radiance flared, banners fluttering in an unseen wind. A corner of the pure-white gate, as massive as a courtyard, blazed with a meteor's tail of fire as it appeared directly above his head.

Li Zhouwei had taken that blow head-on precisely for this moment—to instantly switch from defense to offense!

Amidst the billowing white steam, Murong Yan's violet-black eyes remained calm and cold as he gazed into the distance. The golden-eyed young man had already retracted his palms, shaking off the last of the black qi.

Li Zhouwei was not unscathed. His palms were covered in a radial pattern of glazed, glass-like cracks, with traces of black qi still crawling within them. He paid it no mind, however, and with a simple flick, he dispersed the lingering demonic energy.

The fiend-dispelling wonder of Illuminating Sun and Moon!

His hand drew back, coming to rest on the hilt of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd at his waist. But his expression was far from relaxed. His golden eyes swept the scene, his gaze lingering for a moment on that large rock far below on the riverbank.

'My reach is too short... He's incredibly cautious.'

Just as he thought, Murong Yan, who appeared trapped beneath the celestial gate, showed not a trace of panic. He turned his head slightly, and the aura of Sunless Deceit circulated around him, neutralizing the torrent of Heavenly Light. He let out a short laugh.

"You fulfill the meaning of my valley."

He looked up again, his throat turning a bloody red. The woman's form surged from his larynx once more, and his entire body exploded into a cloud of colorless, hazy flames. The flames evaporated instantly in the searing purple fire of the descending gate, leaving no trace of him behind.

The wind howled. Far below, the skin-bag lying draped over the river rock suddenly inflated as if filling with air. Flesh and blood regenerated from the marrow within. It flipped itself over, straightened its clothes, and vanished.

Simultaneously, all the celestial phenomena—the descending gate, the purple flames—vanished. Li Zhouwei's figure was also gone. Only the sky remained, its colors growing steadily more vivid. Within moments, it was as if nothing had ever happened. Everything on the two riverbanks gradually returned from shadow to light.

"Good."

The man on the distant, flame-arched bridge offered his praise, shaking his head with a sigh. He watched as the figure in the skin-bag strode back and sat down carelessly at the table. Shilou Yingge laughed.

"You underestimated him, didn't you!"

"He has a few tricks. It was a good chance to test his methods while he's without a proper weapon."

Murong Yan had reverted to his original short, stout, and coarse appearance. The fit, martial man with the cold, violet-black eyes seemed to have vanished completely. He casually produced a pair of silver chopsticks and replied, "His eyes are the most formidable part. His dharma-body is at the level of a Body Divine Ability, but those eyes... an ordinary cultivator, even one who had mastered a Life Divine Ability, wouldn't be able to see through my outer form. Yet he spotted that the Valley Visage was on the riverbank. I was hoping to bait out the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, to see what kind of power it has... A pity. He didn't take the bait."

He said no more, and Shilou Yingge tactfully avoided mentioning the four arms that had appeared on Li Zhouwei's back. Seemingly in a good mood, Shilou Yingge laughed heartily.

"He's unarmed and clearly doesn't want to escalate things. A brief clash and mutual retreat is the best outcome. After all, he has trump cards, but you also have your Vast Water Seal Art, which you never used. A true fight would be troublesome for you both."

"Still... once he gets a suitable weapon, I'm not sure you'll be able to take him down so easily."

For once, Murong Yan held his temper in check. He just chuckled and replied, "The Spring of Rebirth is almost finished. I can't afford to be injured right now. A simple probe was for the best."

This gave Shilou Yingge a jolt.

'So fast... He looks completely confident. He's going to succeed this time. To think I'm only five or six years ahead of him on this step... The foundation of the Murong family is so much deeper than my own!'

Murong Yan seemed oblivious to his thoughts, focusing only on his food. After a long moment, he set down his chopsticks and said quietly, "The timing is wrong. If I were perhaps two hundred years older, it would be ideal to wound him, shave off a bit of his destiny, and use it to try for the Buddhist Land. As it stands... unless I can kill him outright, it's not worth the effort. And I have no confidence I can."

"For now... we'll just have to wait for our Lord Qi."

...

On the north bank.

The mountain wind was bitingly cold. The crimson-robed man stared intently at the sky, finally releasing a long, heavy breath. He stood silently beside the small pavilion, his mind reeling.

'So this is the Purple Mansion Realm... Until one reaches this realm... one is nothing but a speck of dust beneath the Heavenly Light and celestial flames!'

He lowered his head. Li Zhouwei had reappeared in the pavilion.

"Father..." Li Jiangqian said hurriedly.

Li Zhouwei shook his head and held up his hand. The glazed cracks remained on his palm, now stretching to his little finger. All the demonic qi had already been expelled, but it took another long moment before the last trace of Valley Water power was finally dissolved.

"A truly formidable individual."

As the last of the invasive energy dissipated, a faint grinding sound, like stone on metal, came from his palm. The skin was already knitting itself back together, smoothing over to its original, unblemished state.

This was the restorative power of Illuminating Sun and Moon, which tied his life-mandate to his single mansion.

Unless his arm or hand were severed and stolen away, he couldn't suffer a truly debilitating injury. For wounds from impacts or shattering forces, as long as the foreign dharma power was dissolved, healing was a simple matter.

This was not a serious injury. Even though the opponent was a demonic cultivator, the damage had been mitigated by his own dharma-body and Illuminating Sun and Moon. With the added boost from the Profound Vastness Art, his recovery would be even faster. He wouldn't even need to actively circulate his divine ability; it would heal on its own in three to five days.

But Li Zhouwei wasn't focused on the injury. He was analyzing his opponent's spell arts and Dao Lineage.

'Valley Water... The divine art, Audience with the Celestial Gate, has always been unfailingly effective. Grand-Uncle built much of his reputation in Jiangnan upon it. Now, I've finally encountered a divine ability that doesn't fear it. Valley Water... it is water in a deep gorge, water that is inherently hidden. The moment you try to suppress it, it's like a fish returning to water...'

'This doesn't just counter Audience with the Celestial Gate. I fear _all_ suppression and sealing-type arts are likely ineffective against Valley Water...'

He had seen something similar once before: Ding Weizeng's Palace-Yang Tiger, which also had the uncanny ability to escape confinement. But that was a specific art from the Hengzhu, not a broad counter to all suppression arts like Valley Water seemed to be.

By the same token, Murong Yan's staff attack must have been a demonic art of transformation. It was primarily demonic spell arts, mixed with just a fraction of his own divine ability and dharma power. Yet even after the demonic qi was stripped away, that tiny fraction of power took him significant effort to dissolve. This proved that when the dharma power of the Valley Water Dao invades a body, it uses the concept of 'Valley Water' to linger indefinitely, inflicting insidious harm.

'As expected of a dao long-established in this world by a True Monarch. Truly formidable. I wonder if he has combined it with the demonic dao. From what I saw, his arts for escaping and preserving his life are also first-rate. And Valley Water is notoriously exceptional at healing. It cannot be called weak! Its only flaw is a lack of offensive power...'

That skin-bag replacement technique of Murong Yan's, that art of concealing one's true form, was incredibly profound. That move alone was enough to reveal the brilliance of both his clan's inheritance and his own personal cultivation.

'This was a significant gain... After all, without having experienced this firsthand, both Grand-Uncle and I would surely have suffered a great loss if we were ever caught off-guard by a Valley Water cultivator.'

While he was lost in thought, Li Jiangqian spoke up from the side.

"Father... the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition showed no reaction..."

Li Zhouwei waved his hand, unconcerned. Whether they were being detained or were simply observing, this was all just the beginning. He shook his head, his voice low.

"The great clans of the north, the scions of King-Marquis lines... none of them are mediocrities. Their Dao arts are profound, their innate talent superb. The cultivators of the south, I fear, are inferior. As for those overseas, the likes of Zhu Gong and Changxi, they merely borrow power from the Great Void to preserve their own lives..."

His hand rested on the table, his voice laced with a grim exhilaration and a sharp killing intent.

"From this day forward, the banks of this great river will see the esteemed King-Marquis of the northern court, the sons of imperial bloodlines, the heroes of the Viewing Pavilion, and the surviving lineages of countless Daos. I wonder how many will come to test themselves against my life? How many families will seek to cross this river and do me harm? The river flows on, day and night, just as it did a hundred years ago!"

Hearing his father's words, Li Jiangqian lowered his head even further, a sinister, venomous light glinting in his golden eyes. Li Zhouwei paused for a moment, then said quietly, "We just have to wait. A change is bound to come."
