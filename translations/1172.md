# Chapter 1172 Elucidation of the Law

The Supreme Yang sun shone brilliantly, its light filtering through wisps of purple smoke.

High in the sky, a talisman sealing six streams of Supreme Yang Sun Essence shimmered, blazing like a second sun above the mountain gate of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. Billowing white mist drifted above as a Daoist Master in feathered robes ascended the steps of azure jade. He soon arrived outside the highest cave dwelling, where another Daoist had come out to greet him.

This Daoist wore a tall crown and white robes, a gentle smile on his face. Seeing the master in feathered robes, he nodded.

"Yun'er, you've returned!"

Hearing this, the feather-robed master bowed deeply. When he straightened, revealing a face that was more distinguished than handsome, his eyes were filled with emotion.

"Greetings, Venerable Forefather!"

It was none other than Daoist Master Changyun—Zhang Yun!

Daoist Master Chunshuo sighed deeply and helped him up, leading him toward the entrance.

"As a direct descendant of our clan, you should have been cultivating peacefully in Azure Revolution Heaven. It truly pains me that you had to toil in the mortal world, suffering the schemes of others."

Zhang Yun's expression was complex.

"Everyone has their own destiny and opportunities," he replied. "It cannot be considered a grievance. Though there were many ups and downs, the outcome is not too poor."

The elder and the youth entered the cave dwelling. After they had passed through three thresholds, Daoist Master Chunshuo finally spoke, his voice tinged with curiosity.

"That fine disciple of yours—have you not brought him back for a visit?"

At the mention of Zhong Qian, Zhang Yun looked quite pleased. He smiled. 

"His skills are remarkable and his intellect is extraordinary. He is a talent unseen in a century, truly worthy of entering our clan. He has now achieved a divine ability, cultivating the Dao of Primordial Lightning. With time, he will surely become a prodigy of his generation!"

Chunshuo listened and pondered for a moment.

"So it is the Great Dao of Primordial Magnetism, the anomaly among the three lightnings. Excellent, that is excellent indeed…"

Although Zhang Yun had long known his elder possessed immense Dao-Profundity, listening to him speak now revealed a profound and thought-provoking quality.

He asked casually, "The elders of the clan are truly farsighted. You had me retrieve the Heavenly Yin Primordial Pearl from Miao Dushan all those years ago, and it was used for him. And giving up Tangdao Mountain to facilitate the transformation of Metal Malice to magnetism also helped him achieve the 'Shedding the Malice Embryo' for his Primordial Lightning divine ability. This is also known as the Baleful Lord's Rite, forged amidst Demonic Malice. Now that his divine ability is complete, he has already manifested primordial magnetism."

"However, this junior knows nothing of the Dao of Primordial Lightning. I fear I may lead him astray."

His words made Chunshuo laugh unexpectedly.

"Our Shangqing Daoist Tradition views the three lightnings through the lens of yin and yang. The Profound and Celestial lightnings are yin and yang, hence they are a pair. Primordial Lightning governs magnetism, thus it is the anomaly. Change arises from the interaction of the pair and the anomaly, giving birth to lightning. The clan has legacies for him; he need only come and claim them!"

Zhang Yun was instantly overjoyed and thanked him profusely. They continued deep into the cave dwelling, where they saw a man who carried himself like a debauched young master sitting upon a high seat. Beside him stood a Daoist Master in blue robes, holding a sword in silence.

Zhang Yun hurried forward and bowed respectfully.

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

Tianhuo turned and stepped down from his seat, a smile playing on his lips.

"Your divine abilities now surpass my own. How could I possibly accept such an honor?"

Tianhuo had a strange temperament. After so many years, his first words were a joke that was not particularly funny, startling Zhang Yun into proclaiming his unworthiness. Tianhuo waved his hand dismissively and looked toward the man at his side.

"This is Daoist Master Changyun. In the future, you may rely on him for much assistance on your path."

The Daoist Master in blue was, shockingly, Su Yan!

Tianhuo watched as the two politely acknowledged each other. The brow of this noble, direct descendant of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition was not filled with joy, but rather a knot of frustration.

"Having won the White River, the Song Emperor will surely enfeoff you as a king. From now on, your path is your own to walk."

The two of them served different kingdoms, yet Zhang Yun had arrived at the Golden Feather Sect's territory with ease, and Tianhuo spoke as if they were family. Whether it was the Song or the Shu, in the eyes of these direct descendants of the Golden Oneness, such allegiances were hardly worth mentioning—even Su Yan, who had just met with the Shu Emperor, did not seem to mind!

Zhang Yun cupped his hands.

"This junior understands… I suspect Yang Ruiyi intends to enfeoff me at the White River. If that can be accomplished, it will be most convenient in the future."

Tianhuo gave a casual "mm," his expression growing heavier.

"Shanji has been destroyed," he said faintly. "Did Cheng Xunzhi show up?"

A subtle shift occurred in Zhang Yun's expression.

"I did not go, nor have I heard any news of him. After all, Changxi does not have a clean background. Lending him Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain was the extent of our benevolence; we would not go so far as to shelter him."

Tianhuo narrowed his eyes, staring at the jade cup in his hand. His voice was icy.

"I fear he has grown suspicious."

Chunshuo looked as if he wanted to speak but held his tongue. Zhang Yun, however, showed little hesitation.

"This matter… I would never believe that the Way of Great Desire is acting without someone pulling the strings from behind," he said in a low voice. "They are provoking the Underworld, and they are scheming against us. I feel… that at this point in time, they believe we have grown too close to the south."

He sighed. "An ordinary cultivator with a divine ability can be manipulated like a chess piece. But he is a Great Daoist Master and a sword immortal, which makes him far more troublesome. He is already at the peak of mortal divine abilities, and his intellect is anything but ordinary. Plus, he has that old tree of profound cultivation guiding him…"

"Once his divine abilities reach perfection, he will be even harder to deal with. Such figures are already seeds for becoming a True Monarch. With various factions fanning the flames, and with some powers not wishing to see him succeed, his perspective will be vastly different from before."

Tianhuo let out a heavy breath.

"So what if it is? And so what if it isn't?" he said coolly. "He might not even live to see his divine abilities perfected!"

Zhang Yun seemed lost in thought, but the dashing man before him was unwilling to speak of it further.

"Let's not mention him… Are you aware of Li Ximing searching for medicine?"

"This junior has heard of it." Zhang Yun's expression flickered slightly. 

"He has visited all manner of powers and even sent men deep into the Eastern Sea in search of the Nine Mounds Daoist Tradition. It appears he is truly desperate."

Hearing this, Tianhuo looked up and exchanged a glance with Chunshuo. They both saw the contemplation in the other's eyes. Chunshuo chose his words carefully.

"In that case… the Immortal Mansion's intentions are rather intriguing."

Tianhuo frowned for a long time.

"Something is wrong."

He stood up and began to pace anxiously within the cave. He hurried to one end, then paced back.

"Impossible," he said gravely. "Supreme Yin methods are precious, but they shouldn't be difficult for the Immortal Mansion to obtain. If the Fox-kin don't have them, does that mean the Immortal Mansion doesn't either? Why would they need to search externally for arts to avert calamity?"

Zhang Yun stroked his beard, his eyes narrowing.

"They are unwilling to give it?"

His words plunged the two men in the cave into silence. Tianhuo spoke in a haunting tone,

"Although… for a lesser cultivator to fathom the will of the sacred is like gazing at the moon from a well—a fool unaware of his own ignorance—since we have seen this moon, we cannot help but speculate… As I see it, regardless of how slim the chances of success, supporting Li Zhouwei's ascension to the Bright Yang realm is completely in line with the Immortal Mansion's wishes."

Chunshuo frowned as Tianhuo let out a deep breath.

"I can think of no motive for them to harm Li Zhouwei. Since they have the Sun Seeker Ring, and since the Azure Profoundity faction went to such lengths to seize this initiative, it's impossible that they wouldn't hope to produce a True Monarch."

"Unless…" he said softly, "unless even the Fox-kin can no longer contact the great personage behind them."

Chunshuo's expression grew complicated. Tianhuo stood with his hands behind his back, silent for a long moment. Zhang Yun, likewise stroking his beard in thought, added,

"Venerable Forefather means to say… that figures like Qingyu Qian, who appear grand, are in fact trapped in their mystic realm, unable to communicate with Donghua Heaven. Although they wish to help, they are powerless to do so…"

Tianhuo nodded as he paced, a look of dawning realization on his face. 

"Anything we say now is mere speculation. Let us wait and see how Ting Province responds."

The colors in his eyes shifted, his expression growing ever more enlightened.

'No wonder, no wonder the Underworld maintains such an attitude… That one's condition has deteriorated to such a degree. If they are pushed too hard, it could very well backfire… No one wants to see Donghua Heaven suddenly open in both the north and south when no one is prepared!'

---

Moongaze Lake.

A fleet of cloud-faring vessels sailed slowly through the air, their decks alight with the flashes of cultivators' arrival and departure. A man in gleaming copper armor, crackling with lightning, stood at the prow of the lead ship. Beside him, a cultivator with a lowered gaze gripped his sword, lost in thought.

'A triumphant return…'

'Qi Lanyan is dead…'

The news was earth-shattering, sending waves of celebration across the lake. Everyone was overjoyed. Li Suining, however, was the most incredulous of all. His first thought was that a lesser cultivator had misjudged a battle between Purple Mansion Realm experts. But when he looked carefully toward the east and saw the sky filled with the aura of Horn Wood, he had no choice but to believe.

'Did Qi Lanyan truly die, or was it a ruse to escape? Can the Profound Governance Pavilion hold on no longer?'

'If he is dead, who will control the situation in Luoxia and Bolie?'

He mulled it over and found he wasn't too alarmed by the prospect of large-scale changes—it wasn't the first time something like this had happened. Upon quiet reflection, he realized this might not be a bad thing.

'If Qi Lanyan is dead, the Guanhua Daoist Tradition won't be able to interfere in Jianghuai for some time!'

No matter how paranoid or stubborn Qi Lanyan was, he was still a figure whose identity, background, and strength were widely recognized. In his hands, the north's full power could be wielded at eighty percent effectiveness. If he fell, who could command such respect? Whether it was Touba Ci or Shilou Yingge, neither could unite the factions. They would be lucky to wield sixty percent of that power!

'This Battle of Baihai was more thorough and intense than in my previous life. It has completely crushed the northern powers in Jianghuai. Forget about retreating to the central plains to eye the south; they won't even be able to make a ripple…'

'I just wonder… how are King Wei's injuries.'

He had waited here specifically for this moment. Seeing Li Zhouda return on a chariot of lightning, he stepped forward with a smile.

"Congratulations, Uncle-Grandmaster!"

"The congratulations are for all of us!" Li Zhouda boomed with laughter, gesturing to the spiritual materials piled high on the profound vessel. 

"They are not the finest of treasures, but their sheer quantity makes up for it!"

Xuanmiao Temple had been abandoned by Sumian for many years, so its resources naturally couldn't compare to those of the former Changxiao Gate. Still, it was the entire foundation of a sect. Even Li Suining couldn't help but smile.

'Our family needs to establish its mystic realm, and building the Profound Foundation will be incredibly expensive. Our clan's power has expanded rapidly over the years, and with the costs of maintaining our army, sixty to seventy percent of Changxiao Gate's resources have been spent. This new supply will restore us to eighty or ninety percent of our former wealth.'

And with Li Suining's rebirth, many tedious trial-and-error steps could be skipped. By his estimation, this eighty to ninety percent would be enough to construct thirty or forty percent of the Profound Foundation.

This was already a considerable sum. The Li family itself was still a massive entity. If not for the fact that Li Suining knew Li Ximing intended to establish a formation in the west, the family would only need to tighten their belts for a dozen years or so to have sufficient resources for the Profound Foundation's base.

'But factoring in that spiritual formation, the situation becomes precarious.'

Establishing a spiritual formation before the mystic realm was a terrifying expense. Worse, once the construction of the Profound Foundation began, it couldn't be stopped. There was a real danger of depleting all their resources and still failing to complete it…

Furthermore, he was aware of his family's dealings with the Western Sea's Xinggong Terrace. With the wealth of Jiangnan, supporting a few minor Dao lineages was no problem in normal times. But in his past life, during times of hardship, it had become a burden.

'After all, we're trying to compress decades of preparation from my past life into a short period. It's bound to be a stretch. If we could just wipe out another Dao lineage somewhere… that would solve everything!'

This Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator appeared harmless, but his mind was plotting deeds that would horrify anyone. It seemed perfectly natural to him. However, with a Daoist Master in the family injured, this matter was not urgent. He turned his attention back to Li Zhouda.

"How are King Wei's injuries?"

Li Zhouda's smile vanished instantly. He sighed.

"His body is covered in colorful patterns. I heard he was struck by a Wu Earth art. Judging by the reactions of the various masters, it's likely a serious matter."

Li Suining already had his suspicions. Hearing this confirmed them, and his heart clenched with shock and pain.

'It's true! The Light of the Crystalline Wu Earth! Since Qi Lanyan is dead… he must have released the Crystalline Jade Branch!'

How could Li Suining not know of this treasure's fearsome reputation?

'He needs a Supreme Yin art that can avert disaster and calamity!'

He hesitated for a moment.

'I'm afraid… even within the clan's vast, sea-like collection of Daoist scriptures, there is no such thing…'

Li Suining was an intelligent man who had now lived two lives. Comparing his experiences, how could he not see that the clan's seemingly endless and rootless collection of arts was unusual? He had long had a suspicion. 

'The clan must possess a secret repository of scriptures! My cultivation technique, and those of the other Daoist Masters, all originate from that place!'

When he had retrieved the Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam in this third life, he understood that the repository had its limits. In his past life, Li Que'wan had suffered the same injury while defending Luoxia. She had lost her sight, and her wounds were so severe that her cultivation stalled. She had to enter seclusion for over half a year just to keep her condition from worsening. Li Ximing had run himself ragged searching for a cure, and Li Zhouwei had even gone to Chang Prefecture to consult the Han clan. It had taken a tremendous effort to overcome it!

'Since they had to search for a cure in my past life, it means we don't have one now. And King Wei doesn't have an Un-harming Stone to block the blow… In the heat of battle, how much could he have possibly dodged!'

The Han clan Li Zhouwei had consulted was a True Monarch Daoist Tradition. Although they couldn't directly impart a secret art to resolve calamities, they had provided a highly sophisticated alchemy formula and a secret method, which included one of the 'Six Elucidations.' Li Suining had read it, but his heart was far from calm.

'This isn't something that can be solved with a single art like the Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam. Back then, they relied on that art to transform spiritual materials, refining all sorts of precious items into pills to get through it… I doubt the family has so many treasures on hand now!'

'It was easy for King Wei to rescue others, but now he is the one who is injured. The other Daoist Masters may not possess his great divine abilities…'

He hesitated for a moment, reconsidering. He hadn't wanted to disturb Li Zhouwei, but now he was conflicted.

'At this point in time, the family should already have one of the Six Elucidations, the Elucidation of Chongyuan's Supplemental Law. They shouldn't have the others… But as for the spiritual materials, that's truly hard to say.'

'Considering the timing, perhaps I should try to request an audience with King Wei again and give him the art… It would also be a good opportunity to ask about his condition…'
