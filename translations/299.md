# Chapter 333: Choice

By the time Li Yuanping arrived, the street had already been sealed off. Both ends stood empty, the road deserted except for two rows of clan soldiers that were standing in formation.

The demon in the Qi Cultivation Realm emanated strong demonic qi that posed a danger to mortal humans. Even slight exposure to it could cause sickness, while severe contact could prove fatal. As a result, none of the townspeople dared to stay in its vicinity.

The fox sat cross-legged, anxiously waiting at a wonton stall by the roadside. The stall's owner had long fled in a panic, leaving only a mess behind him.

Standing beside the fox was Chen Donghe, his sword held in silent vigilance, his expression solemn. He had ascended to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, placing him among the foremost in the family.

Sitting opposite the fox, An Zheyan grinned broadly, holding a bowl of wontons while he chewed enthusiastically. Despite nearing a hundred years old, his appetite was undiminished. The aroma of the grease from his meal made the fox gulp with envy.

Li Yuanping observed the fox from afar and confirmed that it matched the rumors.

"Yuanping greets Senior!"

He hurried forward and cupped his fist respectfully, prompting the fox to emit a high-pitched squeak.

"Where's Li Tongya?"

Seeing Li Yuanping's arrival, An Zheyan tossed aside his bowl immediately, rising to his feet. Chen Donghe nodded to him before they said in unison, "Greetings, Young Master."

Li Yuanping acknowledged them before addressing the fox politely, saying, "Senior, the Old Ancestor is currently meditating in his cave dwelling. You will have to ascend the mountain to speak with him."

The fox twitched its muzzle, casting a wary glance around it. Its narrow eyes then took in the pale golden formation on Mount Lijing and hesitated momentarily before glumly saying, "But first, let's be clear... I am a close friend of your family's Old Ancestor and the demon den knows about it. If this is a ploy to ensnare and kill me within the formation, Mount Dali surely won't let this matter slide!"

"Oh, we would never dare to deceive you, Senior," Li Yuanping assured with a smile. He gestured to dismiss the clan soldiers trailing him and An Zheyan, then led the fox away.

As they passed through the shimmering barriers and entered the mountain, the fox muttered with a hint of annoyance, "Is he really that badly injured that he can't even descend the mountain to meet me?"

Li Yuanping knew that Li Tongya received about fifty percent of his information from this fox. Hence, the fox was likely aware of the Li Family's situation.

In his heart, Li Yuanping could only muster a bitter smile and thought to himself, After all, foxes are known for being cunning and calculating.

However, he replied, 'You'll see him soon and find out, Senior. The last time I saw the Old Ancestor was when I ascended the mountain a few months ago to send him healing medicine... so I am unsure of his current condition.'

After they walked the winding mountain path for a bit, the cave dwelling's entrance eventually came into view.

Li Yuanping hesitated before the sealed stone door and said respectfully, "Please wait here a moment, Senior. My elder brother will arrive shortly to unlock the door."

Despite the long friendship between the White Banyan Fox and Li Tongya, Li Yuanping could not dismiss his reservations—after all, the fox was still a demon, and Li Tongya was seriously injured. If the fox harbored ill intentions, it would be difficult for him to handle the situation.

Li Yuanjiao, at the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and possessing talismans of the Foundation Establishment Realm, was the best candidate to escort this fox into the cave dwelling.

The fox nodded, seemingly oblivious to Li Yuanping's thoughts, but just then, a loud, grating sound erupted as the stone door creaked open.

"Let it enter."

The hoarse voice of Li Tongya rang out. With no other option, Li Yuanping nodded and gestured for the fox to enter. It hurried into the cave without any further hesitation.

Inside, the cave was filled with abundant spiritual qi and illuminated white by a dharma lamp on the wall. Li Tongya, seated cross-legged on the stone bed at the center, smiled warmly at the fox.

The stone table before him was piled with a variety of spirit elixirs and pills that glowed faintly, most of which remained untouched.

"Li Tongya!" the fox exclaimed when he saw Li Tongya, looking at him with gentle eyes. His white hair and withered face shocked the fox, who hurried forward a few steps and grasped his hand, sniffing anxiously before exclaiming, "T-This... This is..."

Li Tongya chuckled and responded, "Thanks to the information you gathered, I managed to survive the wrathful Maha!"

"Why the hell are you still laughing?!"

Li Tongya had no idea where the fox had learned to say that, but its face quickly fell as it squeaked, "Your Dao has been destroyed..."

"More than that."

Li Tongya rolled up his sleeve, revealing the cracks that covered his arm, oozing droplets of light green liquid. He dabbed the liquid away and continued softly, "My cultivation has been damaged too."

Pointing at the spirit items on the stone table, Li Tongya shook his head in resignation. "I had told them not to send these things.... I know the juniors mean well, but most are of little use. This is just a waste of resources," he said dejectedly.

The fox silently gulped but squeaked, "In my opinion... This is a manageable situation! Your five organs are damaged, hence leading to the imbalance of five qi. I have a technique that involves extracting organs from people to replace your heart, spleen, stomach, lungs, and liver. You can get your disciples and grandchildren to gradually gather qi over a few months... Within three years, you'll be as good as new!"

The fox grew more animated with each word, gesturing eagerly as it continued, "As for your destroyed Dao, we can search for a horned flood dragon and feed it 6,600 people to create a blood pool. As long as we do this every three years..."

The fox's voice trailed off as Li Tongya shook his head and interrupted, "Your proposed technique involves using the internal organs of a living human, right? By gathering qi, you're essentially suggesting a blood sacrifice... And by creating that blood pool to renew my Dao... That's nothing short of dark arts."

He chuckled wryly and continued, "I, Li Tongya, hail from humble peasant origins. My life is worth nothing. Though I have taken many lives, they were mostly evildoers or cultivators, individuals who posed a threat. I've never entertained thoughts of senseless slaughter... All I seek is survival."

"This is a clan rule passed down by my father... and the moral boundary of my family."

The moment Li Tongya said "moral boundary", memories of a shiny mirror flashed through his mind.

After a brief pause, he concluded, "The Li Family may not be virtuous, but we won't resort to such dark arts... Forget it."

"You...!"

The fox froze in irritation. "What's wrong about eating people? It's all just about the survival of the fittest! Isn't it always like this? Just because you refuse to eat people doesn't stop others from doing it!" the fox hissed.

Seeing Li Tongya's silence, the fox grew even more frustrated. It rose from the stone bed and snarled, "Stubborn man! That old-fashioned thinking has prevented you from seeing my good intentions!"

Li Tongya remained seated calmly, watching the fox with a smile. It ranted on for a while, then let out a loud wail of frustration and cried.

"I still have over a hundred years to live... how am I going to continue living?!" the fox grumbled to itself for some time more before eventually falling silent.

Opening its mouth wide, he spat out a fruit the size of a jade bead that emitted a clear, cool light.

The fox cleaned its saliva off with its paws before explaining, "This is my prized Huashang Fruit, it's a precious medicine even among human cultivators. It enhances mana and vitality. If you ingest it, you might sustain yourself for a few more years and regain some strength."

Li Tongya was taken aback, unsure about how to refuse the fox. Before he could respond, the fox jumped off the bed, swinging its tail as it grumbled, "What a great loss... I thought we promised to keep ourselves safe. Now, you're going to kick the bucket in a few years..."

Without waiting for Li Tongya's response, the white banyan fox jumped and exited the cave.

Left alone in the cave, Li Tongya gazed silently at the Huashang Fruit glowing softly in his hand like a luminous pearl. A myriad of emotions flooded through him, but all were condensed into a single sigh.

Li Yuanping waited respectfully inside the cave, his heart pounding with apprehension until the fox finally emerged, looking dejected.

Rushing forward, Li Yuanping's eyes burned with anxiety.

"Senior! How is my family's ancestor?" he blurted out.

"Our family's ancestor..?"

The fox glanced at him, then straightened up suddenly. Its eyes darted around before it spoke, its voice heavy with sadness.

"There isn't much time left for him..."

"What?!"

Li Yuanping was dismayed. Li Tongya had clearly spoken of several more years... How could time be running out for him when only less than a year had passed?

The fox seized the moment to continue, "I have a way that could save your ancestor."

Upon hearing this, Li Yuanping's eyes widened with hope.

"Please tell me, Senior!"

"We'll need fresh human hearts, spleens, stomachs... totaling six thousand for each. Bring them here, and I will teach you the method to gather blood qi. In less than three years, we may heal Li Tongya's injuries."

Li Yuanping stood there in shock as he listened to the fox. Thoughts raced through his mind as he tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword until his knuckles turned white. His lips trembled for a few moments before he finally let out a sigh.

"Senior, my family forbids the practice of blood sacrifice..." he said softly, his face turning pale.

The fox was crestfallen and fell silent. Together, they descended the mountain in silence. As they reached the foot of the mountain, the fox deliberately paused and said with a slight smile, "I'm always on Mount White Banyan. Feel free to come visit if you need anything."

Li Yuanping nodded lightly. The White Banyan Fox clicked its tongue twice, then vanished into the wind.

Li Yuanping's bottom lip nearly bled as he bit down on it, watching as the fox disappeared. Finally, after a long moment, he released his grip on his sword and left the mountain.

His mind was in turmoil. Not only Li Tongya's injuries but even his own frail health and damaged root bone could also be remedied by these methods...

"Yuanping, send a hundred jin of Spirit Rice to the Elder White Banyan Fox every year."

Li Yuanping's heart felt heavy and unsettled when Li Tongya gave him this instruction. It rang in his ears like a warning bell, momentarily clearing his mind. Nevertheless, he heeded it respectfully before quickly descending the mountain.

"Quite an intriguing fox..." Lu Jiangxian remarked as he leaned against the jade table leisurely, watching the fox depart reluctantly.

In his sight, the fox shimmered with pure Dharma light from head to tail, exuding a calm and neutral aura. Such an aura was quite uncommon for a demon.

"This fox told Li Tongya that it was born in the wild, but its body radiated with mana light—clearly indicating an inherited lineage and profound background."

Though Lu Jiangxian had yet to recover to the Purple Mansion Realm and could not predict the demon fox's fate, he could already discern this fox's extraordinary background.

He silently pondered to himself, Judging by its insight and knowledge, this fox might be backed by one of the top Purple Mansion demons from the demon den... I wonder what its purpose is in approaching the Li Family.

Even though the Wrathful Maha had perished and Lu Jiangxian had saved Li Tongya, the matter was far from over.

Wrathful Maha, who had dedicated years to his cultivation and amassed a wealth of golden essence, carried a formidable fate. Upon his death, his fate scattered and dispersed throughout the great void, wandering aimlessly.

Daoist Master Shangyuan, either disdainful or no longer finding these fates useful, sheathed his sword and departed. Meanwhile, the nine Purple Mansion Realm cultivators pursued them through the great void, creating a grand spectacle that Lu Jiangxian found interesting.

"The Golden Feather Sect and Azure Pond Sect seem to have gained the most from this affair. Xiao Chuting, if not for his lack of combat prowess due to Man On Creek, could have benefited even more."

His intervention this time had thoroughly exhausted Lu Jiangxian. Yawning, he felt a weariness seep into his heart. He glanced at Li Tongya, who held the night pearl-like Huashang Fruit in his hands, then condensed a talisman pill and sent it into the great void with a flick of his fingers.

"I can't let you suffer too greatly either," he mumbled.

The pure talisman qi obtained through the ritual and condensed by the mirror could enhance the cultivation and the root bone of the demon fox once infused into its body.

Behind the demon fox likely lurked at most a Purple Mansion Realm demon cultivator.

Judging by the look of things, the fox had roamed freely for many years, so Lu Jiangxian had nothing to worry about the Purple Mansion Realm demon detecting something in it.

"I wonder if I've grown more cautious due to my prolonged stay with the Li Family..." Lu Jiangxian mused silently, a faint smile playing on his lips.

In the secret chamber of the Li Family's ancestral hall, the bluish-gray mirror slowly floated into the air, releasing ethereal wisps of moonlight. Like mist, the wisps filled the dark room. From the surface of a shattered mirror emerged a brilliant, radiant stream of light.

This luminous stream seemed to be imbued with a life of its own, meandering through the air with purpose. It effortlessly traversed through thick stone walls, passed through layers of dense formations, and penetrated the golden Sun Rite Profound Light Formation, finally catching up to the demon fox.

The stream of light pulsated with a rhythmic beat and then entered the back of the White Banyan Fox's head. The fox remained oblivious to its presence, continuing on its silent flight toward Mount Dali.

Meanwhile at the Yu Residence...

"So you're saying that... Li Tongya has either perished alongside that Maha or suffered grave injuries?" Yu Xiaogui asked in a hushed tone, narrowing his eyes at Yu Mugao who was dressed in white.

Yu Mugao shook his head, gazing at the folding fan in his hand. Absent-mindedly, he traced his finger along its cool, smooth guard.

He replied casually, "It was just my speculation. Who knows, maybe Li Tongya sustained irreversible damage during the process of slaying the Maha?"

Yu Mugao's face, once marked by a red palm print, had regained its usual pale complexion. Despite his middle-aged appearance, he spoke with a deliberate calmness.

"I heard that no one had seen him ever since he slayed the Maha, so I dispatched someone to investigate the Li Family's store in Cloud Crowned Peak's marketplace..."

"Store?" Yu Xiaogui frowned, pausing briefly before Yu Mugao chuckled and added, "Reports indicated a shortage of healing and invigorating spirit item supplies."

"Oh? You're quite thorough!" Yu Xiaogui praised as he raised an eyebrow and delight filled his eyes.

Observing Yu Mugao leisurely sipping his tea, Yu Xiaogui continued thoughtfully, "Your attention to detail is impressive. Back in the day, the only one capable of managing every aspect of the household without a leak, and even capable of betrayal, was Li Yuanxiu. Even Fei Wangbai had his vulnerabilities."

Yu Mugao's expression hardened slightly and muttered, "If not for our family's constraints and internal strife, Fei Wangbai wouldn't have managed to hold us back for so long... allowing the Li Family to flourish for naught."

Yu Xiaogui seemed uneasy, reminded of the lingering troubles from his tenure as family head. Each mention of these matters by his eldest son left him silent, prompting a quick change of subject.

"These are mere speculations on healing spirit items... Li Tongya's absence may simply be due to secluded cultivation."

"Agreed," Yu Mugao nodded gently, prompting Yu Xiaogui to inquire further, "What are your intentions?"

A faint smile played on Yu Mugao's lips, years of setbacks having sharpened rather than dulled his resolve.

"Test the waters."

The father and son exchanged glances as a servant hastily entered the room.

A fleeting look of surprise crossed the servant's face upon seeing Yu Xiaogui. He quickly bowed his head and respectfully cupped his fist to Yu Mugao, reporting, "Family Head... The Fei Family has sealed their mountain!"

"What?!"
