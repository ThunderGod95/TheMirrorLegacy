# Chapter 903: Raging Thunder Quelled by Earth

Fei Qingyi rode the wind all the way. The lake rippled beneath her as cultivators wearing jade pendants at their waists passed through the scattered islets that dotted the waters. Flags fluttered on both shores. She looked up at the land before her.

There was Milin Prefecture, Jade Court, Glacial Clouds Peak, Huazhong, but all she saw was the word, Li. She hadn’t returned for decades. When she had left, the three families had agreed not to fight within the lake, an agreement personally established by Yuanwu Peak. And now, everything bore the Li surname.

Fei Qingyi only felt a faint chill on the lake breeze. As she made her way to the northern shore, the people who came to greet her didn’t recognize her, addressing her as milady one after another. She simply waited in silence for Fei Tongyu.

Soon, an old man approached. His face was weathered, eyes slightly bulging, fingers maimed, and one foot still bandaged and suspended. He was clearly not yet healed. From afar, he looked utterly wretched.

She had left home at the age of six. And so, much like the current Fei Family, the old man before her felt like a complete stranger.

Suppressing her tears, she followed her father into a small courtyard filled with plum blossoms and asked, "Why don’t I see any of the uncles?"

"They died by the river." Fei Tongyu replied dismissively, not the least bit sorrowful. A ferocious hatred blazed in his eyes, his mind entirely fixated on the sword-wielding enemy by the river. He asked urgently, "Have you confirmed it? That man is Si Yuanli! From the Si Family of the Azure Pond Sect!"

Fei Qingyi felt everything around her was unfamiliar, and the old man before her even more frighteningly so. She silently nodded, while Fei Tongyu grew visibly excited.

His hunched body straightened abruptly as he asked, "Yuan Xiu? How many members does the Si Family have? What’s their strength... their lineage?"

His questions came like a barrage of arrows. Fei Qingyi answered them one by one, a growing terror gripping her heart. Her delicate hand, hidden in her white robe, was clenched so tightly that it turned pale.

There were no questions about how she had walked on thin ice all these years within the sect. Her father Fei Tongyu was consumed entirely by hatred. Fei Qingyi had spent three years on Yuanwu Peak. She had seen Yuanwu grow increasingly deranged as his lifespan dwindled.

She gradually sensed the signs of downfall, but what could she say? The Fei Family dared not associate with the Li Family when Yu Muxian was alive. After Yu Muxian’s death came Tang Shedu, and when Tang Shedu left, there was still Yu Su. For years, the Fei Family had no contact with the Li Family, partly thanks to her own persuasion. But it was all for self-preservation, nothing more.

However, Fei Tongyu paid no mind to her daze. His questions grew increasingly reckless, forgetting the situation entirely, until he finally asked something that sent a chill down her spine. He asked urgently, "How much lifespan does Yuan Xiu have left?"

Fei Qingyi finally lowered her head, closed her eyes to hold back her tears, and replied softly, "Father, that’s the Si Family... do you not realize whose formation lies beneath our feet... don’t you have even a shred of caution?

"You’ve never been to the Azure Pond Sect, nor seen Purple Mansion Realm cultivators... you don’t understand the dread of the Chi and Si Families, nor what the Purple Mansion Realm truly means. Father, that is the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Her words stunned Fei Tongyu. He frowned and said, "Of course I know the formation isn’t right. But who in the Fei Family hasn’t raged in hatred all these years? If it really had any eavesdropping ability, we’d have been destroyed long ago. Besides, this courtyard has its own warding formation!"

Seeing that he completely ignored the second half of what she said, the woman wept as she said, "I’ve seen Tang Yuanwu; he was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. In their eyes, we’re not even ants; we’re tools, and objects. Father, what we think, he can perceive in a single thought. What he thinks, he can transform into what we believe. Father... that is the Purple Mansion Realm...

"Yuanwu isn’t even as formidable as Yuan Xiu. Lord Si is a late stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Fine, say you’ve stirred up hatred in the Fei Family, and in me—then what? The moment I re-enter the sect, maybe Si Yuanli won’t notice, but Lord Si will know instantly, and disaster will strike out of nowhere. It might even be the extermination of our family."

Fei Tongyu’s lips trembled. He snapped and said, "He, Si Boxiu, is so lofty, how could he ever probe the mind of a junior like you?"

Fei Qingyi took a deep breath. Her slightly reddened eyes stared at her father as she said, "But he would. If he couldn’t, he wouldn’t be worthy of the Purple Mansion Realm. That’s what’s terrifying."

Her voice rang through Fei Tongyu’s mind, freezing him where he stood.

Fei Qingyi had come here from the edge of death, with one foot still in the underworld. She no longer had the will to argue. Her eyes revealed her deep exhaustion, and her voice grew quieter, "Father, the deaths of our predecessors were already enough. It was the force of fate. The Jade True Immortal Foundation can be consumed by Shangyuan. He may not do it, but the other sects must still guard against it.

"If not the Si Family, then others... The Li Family is fearsome, yes, but have you ever considered how different the Yu Family’s Yu Mugao and Yu Muyuan are? Why did the Xiao Family and so many other forces behind the scenes all choose to side with the Li Family?

"It was because back then, all who cultivated Jade True were destined to die, whether it be the Lord, or Yu Yufeng. The tide of fate compelled them. You may be unhappy with our family’s decline, but from the moment True Monarch Shangyuan decided to break through to the Golden Core Realm..."

She paused for several seconds, then said heavily, "Whether it’s the Fei Family or the Yu Family, we’ve long been kicked off the table of power on the lake. Our decline was inevitable."

Fei Tongyu looked at her in disbelief, but Fei Qingyi didn’t even wait for him to speak. She hurriedly said, "Now the Si and Li Families are on good terms; they may even join forces in the future. If this matter reaches the Li Family, what will become of us? Li Qinghong is more lenient, but Li Xijun is ruthless and capable. How will he see our family then?"

Seeing her father sitting silently beside the jade table, saying nothing, she softened her voice, "Father... it’s enough... I truly think it’s enough... Please rest well, forget these matters, stop stirring trouble... Leave a breath of life for our family, will you?"

Snowflakes drifted down on Glacial Cloud Peak. Fei Tongyu stood like a broken statue, frozen in place. Fei Qingyi waited in silence. Only after half a cup of tea’s time did she rise and say softly, "Father, I will return to report."

Fei Tongyu remained motionless and unresponsive. The woman paused for half a step, then turned, brushing the snow from his shoulders one flake at a time. Only then did she rise on the wind and vanish toward the south.

Mount Qingdu.

Li Xizhi and Yang Ruizao were pressed for time. After a brief inspection of the lake's grand formation, they prepared to depart. Fei Qingyi had made a quick return from the Fei Family and now followed respectfully behind them.

She was strikingly beautiful, dressed in white robes. When a large boat revealed itself in the air and everyone gathered before it, Fei Qingyi bowed and said respectfully, "There is an item that originally belonged to your esteemed family, but long ago fell into the hands of Yuanwu Peak and has yet to be returned. It came into my possession by chance, and I have come today to return it to its rightful owner."

"Oh?" Li Xizhi nodded, while Yang Ruizao smiled and asked, "What item?"

Fei Qingyi lifted both hands, and a stream of white light emerged and coalesced into a jade mountain. It was no larger than a fist, exquisitely carved with cranes and ancient pines, all shrouded in mist. Its translucent glow radiated a brilliant jade luster that was truly eye-catching.

"Jade Smoke Mountain!"

All eyes fell upon it. Li Xizhi took it and examined it closely. There was a faint sword mark halfway up the Jade Smoke Mountain.

"As expected, that mark must have been left by the Celestial Moon Sword, Li Tongya?"

Yang Ruizao sighed, and Fei Qingyi replied softly, "Indeed. This item is forged from Supreme Radiant Profound Jade, incomparably durable and impervious to all forms of mana. Only a figure of his caliber could leave a mark on such a dharma artifact."

Li Qinghong couldn’t tear her eyes away from the sword scar. Fei Qingyi’s words were only half-true. Now that Jade True had been restored and the jade veins were thriving, the Jade Smoke Mountain was naturally immune to ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm mana. But back in the day, this dharma artifact would have been far less durable. There was no longer a way to verify how strong it truly was now.

The dharma artifact held special meaning for the Li Family, but Li Xizhi was in no rush to accept it. He turned to Li Xijun, and the white-robed young man immediately said softly, "This item was once borrowed by Yu Su, so this counts as its return. The Yu Family has since fractured among the outer branches, and only a few direct descendants remain. Most have already married into the Li Family, perhaps it’s best to store it here for now, for future generations."

Though the Yu Family’s downfall was closely tied to the Li Family, ultimately it had been carved up by various outside surnames, and their descendants no longer bore the Yu surname. Li Xijun had chosen a tactful way to put it as he received the Jade Smoke Mountain.

Fei Qingyi finally let out a breath of relief as Li Xizhi accepted it, and quietly settled into a corner of the flying boat. Yang Ruizao glanced at her with mild interest and exchanged a few polite words. The spirit boat started heading south, returning to the Azure Pond Sect.

The Li Family’s forces had already entered Nine Gates Peak, and the various households were being accounted for. Li Chengliao and the others would handle matters thoroughly, so there was no need for the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to make another trip. Li Xijun and his companions escorted the guests out of Moongaze Lake and turned with the spirit wind toward the central islet. Just then, An Siwei approached on a current of spirit wind, with several people following behind him, all bearing respectful expressions.

He said in a low voice, "My lord, the masters have all arrived."

Li Xijun did a mental count and said in surprise, "That quick?"

An Siwei nodded, stepped closer to Li Xijun, and said quietly, "We searched a few marketplaces for those capable of breaking forbidden formations. These few were found immediately, and they came eagerly and with utmost courtesy."

Li Xijun raised an eyebrow slightly and turned to look at the four formation masters. All of them were at the Qi Cultivation Realm, elderly, with unremarkable clothing and middling mana cultivation.

He inspected them with his ocular perception technique, seeing through them clearly. He only relaxed a little when he noted that none of them were using any illusion arts. When they noticed Li Xijun looking their way, the elderly men all bowed respectfully and said, "Greetings, my lord!"

The Formation Dao was as deep as the sea, and one of the most complex among the hundred arts of Immortal Cultivation. If a rogue cultivator had any achievements in it, it almost certainly meant they had no fate with the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Even among the great sects, formation masters rarely excelled in their cultivation realm. Not everyone could be like Wan Huaqian or Liu Changdie. Li Xijun didn’t belittle them for their realm and asked, "Have the masters already seen the formation?"

They all nodded, and one of them even looked visibly excited as he said softly, "To be able to crack such a forbidden ancient formation is a rare blessing for one such as Lin!"

This formation master Lin was the oldest among them, and clearly held the highest status. He followed half a step behind Li Xijun and respectfully said, "We are all cultivators from Yue State. We’ve long heard of this forbidden formation and are all lovers of the art. Years ago, we each came to study it, so we’re not unfamiliar with it. When we heard your esteemed family was going to unravel it, we were overjoyed!

"We discussed it briefly and concluded that this type of thunder-domain formation should be suppressed and broken using items of the Metal Virtue. The best would be to use both Geng Metal and Reflecting Metal, as these are rare spiritual items that can neutralize thunder."

"Oh?" Li Xijun raised an eyebrow, his gaze turning sharp as he asked, "Our family also has cultivators of the Thunder Dao, and we’ve only ever heard that Earth Virtue can suppress thunder. We’ve never heard that Geng Metal could do the same."

Formation Master Lin paused for a moment. Some things were unspoken secrets of his Dao lineage, but how could he afford to be vague when a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was asking?

He could only explain in a hushed tone, "There is a saying, 'Raging thunder is quenched by earth, remnant lightning falls to metal.' The forbidden formation is the remnant left after the main formation is broken, and thus belongs to residual lightning. This concept doesn’t exist in cultivation, but it does in formation theory."

Li Xijun silently memorized the phrase and thought to himself, Raging thunder is quenched by earth... No wonder! The dragon clan seeks to devour lightning, and it’s often said that Azure Proclaimation is of Earth Virtue. Yuan Tuan and Yuan Chengdun both cultivated Azure Proclaimation and were considered keys to unlocking the thunder arts grotto heaven. This might be connected.

But even though Azure Proclaimation is Earth Virtue, it often gets entangled with blessing arts and shamanic arts... I still don’t understand why...

Since he was silently pondering, Master Lin assumed he was still listening and began his explanation, "To break this formation, one must use Metal Virtue tools, along with several Metal Virtue spiritual items, where half of them should be Geng Metal and half Reflecting Metal. These must be used together in the formation, and I’m afraid it will require several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators working in concert."

Li Xijun nodded inwardly and asked, "How many?"

Master Lin looked a little hesitant. After exchanging glances with the elders behind him, he said nervously, "It depends on the quality of the dharma artifacts and spiritual items used. If there are excellent Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts of Metal Virtue, the number can be reduced to six or eight. If the spiritual items are especially good, even four or five might suffice. But if none are available, then perhaps over ten would be needed..."

He quickly added, "It’s not that my skills are lacking but ancient forbidden formations are always difficult to resolve. If greater convenience is desired, one might have to seek a higher cultivator from a major sect..."

Li Xijun gently shook his head. "Of course I know that. If this formation were that easy to crack, the Yu Family would have broken it years ago and moved into the lake."

The others nodded repeatedly, and Master Lin reminded him, "This formation method comes from my Dao lineage and is designed specifically to break remnants of forbidden thunder formations. According to ancient texts, half of the Reflecting Metal used will be transmuted into Geng Metal. If your esteemed family has any particularly rare or important Reflecting Metal spiritual items, you must not use them carelessly."

Li Xijun naturally possessed quite a few spiritual items himself, most of them brought back by Li Xuanfeng. He had originally planned to borrow from a few friendly clans if they were insufficient.

But hearing this, he frowned and asked, "How many spiritual items are needed?"

Master Lin replied, "The more, the better. Two, four, six, or eight. Reflecting Metal and Geng Metal should be matched in pairs. That will suffice."

Li Xuanfeng had brought back Reflecting Metal type spiritual items like Zimu Profound Gold and Heartsway Gold. The household also had a Geng Metal item, Black Profound Gold. If they borrowed one more piece of Geng Metal, they could assemble four types.

They had enough Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of their own. There were already four at home, and more could be called upon. After calculating everything, he felt confident.

Yet the formation masters still looked somewhat uneasy. Clearly, it wasn’t the family’s connections they doubted. Master Lin hesitated a few times and thought inwardly, I’m afraid he’s underestimating what I meant by good dharma artifact. Ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm tools won’t suffice. It might embarrass him when the time comes...

Then he hesitated again, recalling the rumored celestial bow. It was said that the man cultivated Geng Metal. The Li Family likely possessed more treasures than outsiders imagined, so he stayed silent.

But Li Xijun was in no rush. A Metal Virtue weapon?

Across all of Jiangnan, aside from treasures held by major sects, what Geng Metal artifact could compare to the spirit bow, White Lightning? It had been empowered by Li Xuanfeng’s full cultivation and refined with the ancient shamanic tool Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman. It was a weapon that truly claimed the rightful position of Metal.

If the spirit bow, White Lightning, wasn’t enough, the Li Family still held another treasure. Though it had lost much of its former brilliance, its core remained something of exceptionally high inherent rank.

The Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token might be worth trying as well! thought Li Xijun.
