# Chapter 1105: Turning Point

Li Zhouwei retrieved his golden halberd and smiled.

"The Protector-General is certainly carefree, but I, on the other hand, must see him."

He had a good impression of Liu Bai. It was just a pity that a sword cultivator who was meant to be free-spirited had been thrown into such a grand, complex situation. Everyone saw him as the 'Jade True', a beacon of integrity brimming with vigor, but in Li Zhouwei's eyes... he was actually a man of unfulfilled ambitions, burdened by deep frustrations.

Liu Bai immediately sighed. He had a feud with the Situ clan and knew the Li clan's relationship with them wasn't any better. He simply sheathed his sword and shook his head.

"King Wei, your esteemed status surpasses all other generals. You have only just slain Vast Cicada and are at the height of your prestige. You should be the one to guard this mountain..."

He first stated this righteous justification before finally getting to his point.

"I am, after all, a sword cultivator. I prefer to vent my frustrations. If I see him, it will only stir up conflict. This matter... I must trouble King Wei with it."

Li Zhouwei clasped his hands and smiled.

"It's no trouble. I was ordered to enter Tangdao in the first place. But... there's no need for the Protector-General to return to Baixiang. Yang Ruizao is already in Baixiang, commanding the Exiled Qi. He is awaiting orders and ready to move at any time."

Hearing this, Liu Bai seemed to understand something. He realized Li Zhouwei had other plans. He gave him a look and said,

"In that case, I will wait for King Wei outside the mountain."

Li Zhouwei immediately strode into the mountain on a beam of light. He saw a grim landscape of metal and stone. Overhead, there was not a trace of Heavenly Light, only a thick, bottomless, and profound yin mist. An Azure Nether Bronze chariot stood in the sky, radiating a brilliant glow.

A woman hovered in the air, her feet treading on an owl-wind. She lowered her gaze, adopting a very humble posture, and said,

"Greetings, King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei nodded. "Ah, it is the King of Nanjia. There is no need for such ceremony."

This woman was precisely Lingu Lanying. The Lingu family had relied on the good fortune of the old sword immortal from the Great Xiukui Monastery to barely manage to raise her, allowing the Lingu family to be enfeoffed as the King of Nanjia. Yet, seeing Li Zhouwei, she was deeply ashamed.

"I am merely a minor king 'within the jurisdiction.' I dare not accept praise before King Wei. Please, King Wei, omit my title. You may simply call me Yingjia."

Li Zhouwei merely strode up the mountain, smiling.

"'A minor king within the jurisdiction'... Interesting. Whose turn of phrase is that?"

Back then, when Ning Wan had come to Moongaze Lake to grant fiefdoms, she had declared Moongaze Lake autonomous. All matters, high and low, were to be decided by Li Zhouwei. Later, it became known as the 'Land Beyond Martial Cultivation's Reach.' In contrast, these so-called kings like Lingu Lanying... were naturally 'within the jurisdiction.'

His words made Lingu Lanying slightly nervous. She only replied,

"It cannot be attributed to anyone specific... just some folk rumors..."

Li Zhouwei, however, had already arrived before the golden hall. He saw the great doors were wide open. An old man walked out from within, descending the steps. He carried a gold-red blade on his back, held a long-handled spear, and his scarred face was wreathed in smiles.

"Greetings, King Wei! Many thanks to King Wei for lifting the siege!"

Li Zhouwei glanced at him, then surveyed the surroundings.

"General Who Pacifies the Huai, you are truly capable. With so few soldiers and generals, you still managed to hold out for so long."

Situ Huo was clearly a senior, yet he put on no airs at all. He nodded and smiled.

"It was all thanks to this great formation! The Great General personally laid this array, calling it the 'Great Ye Profound Exiled Spirit Formation.' It is truly one of a kind, designed specifically to deal with Buddhist cultivators. Ordinary formations are nothing but useless decorations in front of it!"

His gaze shifted, turning to the faint Underworld chariot in the sky. He changed the subject.

"The second reason... was the Daoist friend in that chariot. But... she should be returning to report by now."

The treasure was submerged in the quiet darkness, and the Exiled Qi had sealed off all information. Li Zhouwei secretly consulted his Immortal Mirror and swept the area. As expected, the chariot was empty.

Situ Huo, however, stared at his golden pupils. Waiting for Li Zhouwei to retract his gaze, he led him forward to take a seat in the main hall. Only then did he speak.

"King Wei, you routed the Zhao army, slew those vile cultivators, and stabilized the war. But the orders from above have not yet arrived, and the surrounding cultivators are watching us like tigers. I wonder... what are King Wei's intentions?"

Li Zhouwei shot him a glance and replied, "I was just about to address that."

Situ Huo raised an eyebrow. He watched Li Zhouwei stand up and retrieve a token from his sleeve. It was black with intricate golden patterns and inscribed with golden characters. Li Zhouwei said:

"I want the General to leave the mountain with me and head south. This place will be handed over to Protector-General Liu to guard."

Situ Huo glanced at the command token and lowered his gaze.

"Oh? And what of Baixiang?"

Li Zhouwei said flatly, "If Baixiang can be held, hold it. If not, give it back to them."

Situ Huo's expression immediately darkened.

"Does King Wei understand what he is saying?" he said coolly. "Baixiang and Xiaoshi are the supporting flanks for Tangdao Mountain. We barely managed to block the north's southward route. If you let it go... the north will have a new passage to bypass Tangdao and advance south..."

He paused, recalling Li Zhouwei's words about heading south. He looked up at him, raising an eyebrow.

"King Wei... you intend to attack the Capital immortals mountain gate?"

Li Zhouwei nodded. "Correct."

This made Situ Huo fall silent.

The three points of Xiaoshi, Tangdao, and Baixiang formed a sprawling, twisted barrier that shielded the plains behind them. Critically, their earth veins and spiritual energy were all strong. With the Purple Mansion Realm formations locking them down in unison, all sensed by Exiled Qi, they could almost completely sever the north's route to attack the Moongaze Lake Wilderness.

But this solid barrier had one weakness: the Baiye region, located at its eastern flank. No matter how strong the defense line was, the passage of Bianyan, Chengyun, and Capital immortals was backed by Xuanmiao and Shanji. If a large number of northern cultivators gathered there, they could thrust straight through and pass unhindered.

Li Zhouwei stared into his eyes.

"We are short on manpower. Baixiang's earth veins are poor, and it lacks a spirit formation like Tangdao's. Not only can we not hold it, but it would also tie up a large number of our forces. Worse, with Baiye at our flank, we'd be exposed on both front and rear. There is nothing stopping Vast Cicada's surprise troops from trying again."

"But if we abandon Baixiang to seize Baiye, relying on the Capital immortals mountain gate, we would gain immense freedom. Although we couldn't keep the enemy out of Jianghuai, we could retreat and use the White River region as a pocket to bleed them dry. Or, we could advance to seize Xuanmiao, cut off Shanji's escape route, and conquer Jiangnan in its entirety."

Situ Huo already understood his meaning. He said nothing for a long time before finally sighing.

"I am well aware that the Great General wishes to reclaim Shanji above all else. But this matter is of vital importance. I cannot make this decision."

Li Zhouwei gave a cold laugh and slammed the command token onto the table.

"Cannot make the decision? Or _unwilling_ to make it!"

Li Zhouwei knew exactly what Situ Huo was thinking. He was simply clinging to the power he held as the General Who Pacifies the Huai and the Military Commissioner of Tangdao!

The greater the power and status one held in the Martial Cultivation's light, the greater the blessing they received. Both were Holders of the Profound, but the difference between the low-titled Li Jianglong and the high minister Li Jiangliang was immense!

'Now that the Zhao troops have retreated, the three-point line of Xiaoshi, Tangdao, and Baixiang is complete. Holding this position requires nearly half of the Great Song's entire strength. As the Military Commissioner of Tangdao, I wield total authority here. My status is naturally supreme, rivaling that of the First Minister!'

'If we abandon Baixiang to take Capital immortals, it's equivalent to splitting the entire Jiangbei defensive line in two. Whether it's Liu Bai or someone else stationed at Capital immortals, I'll suddenly have an equal, and that will greatly dilute the glory of my Martial Cultivation position.'

And that was only if the plan _succeeded_. Situ Huo's heart was filled with even greater suspicion.

'I am the General Who Pacifies the Huai. My fief is Tangdao. He wants to let Liu Bai guard Tangdao Mountain for me? What if something goes wrong with the Capital immortals Dao? What if we fail to take it and suffer a major defeat? If the north counter-attacks, Liu Bai will just abandon this strategic mountain and flee south. All of the Great Song's gains will be lost. And I, as the Military Commissioner, will have lost my own territory. What future would I have left?'

This suspicion was hardly surprising. Li Zhouwei sneered internally.

'They always say the northerners are disunited... as if the south is any different! No one is ever truly working toward the same goal. They were just gasping for air before, forced to temporarily set aside their own interests and squabbles!'

Facing the accusation, Situ Huo lowered his gaze, feigning doubt.

"Why would King Wei say such a thing! I cannot abandon my post without authorization. I must trouble King Wei and Protector-General Liu to make the trip instead."

In Situ Huo's eyes, this was the perfect solution. He, Situ Huo, would not get involved. He would just let Li Zhouwei and Liu Bai go attack the Capital immortals Dao and deal with Qi Lanyan. Wouldn't that be the best of both worlds? Why should he have to go personally and invite all this mutual suspicion?

But the coldness on Li Zhouwei's face faded, replaced by a deepening smile. He didn't bother arguing.

"General Who Pacifies the Huai... you had best think this through."

As the token in his hand began to glow, the Underworld chariot in the sky seemed to tremble faintly. Situ Huo's expression began to change.

Li Zhouwei had, of course, anticipated this. If possible, he wouldn't have wasted a breath on this Daoist Master from the Situ family; he would have just gone with Liu Bai. But the Xuanmiao region was full of cultivators and perilously close to the Capital immortals Dao. In his and Yang Ruiyi's strategy, the Capital immortals Dao was easy to attack but difficult to defend. When the time came, Yang Ruiyi was prepared to abandon all of Jianghuai in exchange for Shanji! And the Great Song's primary concern in that scenario... was guarding against Situ Huo himself.

'If the war situation changes and the order is given to abandon Jianghuai, Liu Bai, guarding Tangdao, will definitely abandon the mountain and retreat south... But what about Situ Huo?'

'That old bastard doesn't have Liu Bai's integrity. He might just hold out until the very last second. Then, when things go wrong and the tides turn, he could 'reluctantly' defect to the Buddhists. By exploiting the chaos, he could still secure an extremely high position!'

This was one of Situ Huo's own schemes all along. The treacherous, two-faced Daoist Master was always waiting for the highest bidder! His ideal path to maximize profit might be to first use True Qi to break through to the Purple Mystery realm and _then_ defect to the Buddhists during a decisive battle. But Yang Ruiyi was no fool. Given the right opportunity, Situ Huo was entirely capable of defecting to the north.

When the Buddhists besieged this mountain earlier, who knew if Situ Huo was already weighing his options? Yang Ruiyi worried day and night in the Wilderness, and more than half of that worry was directed at Situ Huo himself!

And so, as Li Zhouwei's words fell on Situ Huo's ears, accompanied by the trembling of the Underworld chariot high above, understanding dawned on Situ Huo in an instant. He met Li Zhouwei's gaze—a pair of bright golden pupils, stabbing toward him like swords.

'That Yang family member who arrived in the Underworld chariot... she wasn't just guarding the mountain to keep the north guessing. She was also here to intimidate me...'

'And Li Zhouwei, arriving with this token to forcibly transfer me, is the Yang clan's warning!'

The old Daoist Master's gloomy expression flickered for a moment. It was impossible to know what he was truly thinking. His face remained perfectly composed as he smiled, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

"Since King Wei insists, I will naturally obey the order!"

The moment his voice fell, Li Zhouwei's token tumbled from his grasp, dissolving into a cascading waterfall of grey wind. It instantly submerged both their figures in the churning, uncertain currents of Exiled Qi.

A shadow of the Great Void faintly materialized. Situ Huo stood with his hands clasped behind his back, while Li Zhouwei remained silent, his expression tranquil.

'In truth... there was one other candidate to guard Tangdao Mountain.'

Li Zhouwei himself.

Unfortunately, Situ Huo and Liu Bai's relationship was abysmal. Situ Huo was a despicable and sinister man, perfectly willing to grovel and humiliate himself, but Liu Bai found it impossible to get along with him. Yang Ruiyi, fearing this would ruin things, refused to let Li Zhouwei guard the mountain.

And Li Zhouwei was more than happy with that arrangement.

'Breaking mountains and exterminating sects... that suits my Dharma Body perfectly!'

...

Xuanmiao Temple.

The lamps were dim, and Dharma light flickered. A youth with an ethereal brow stood on the mountainside. His eyes, once bright with divine light and natural ease, were now filled with gloom.

Tao Jiexing had returned to Xuanmiao Temple, his expression utterly changed. A faint, lingering despair floated in his eyes. He pushed open the door and entered. The person in the seat of honor was different now, too.

The young man at the head of the hall stood quietly to one side, his face dark with melancholy.

Qi Lanyan had always been proud. His origins in the Profound Governance and the Viewing Pavilion, combined with his fortunate encounter with the Heavenly Element, had pushed his self-satisfaction to its absolute peak. Now, that easy confidence of a master strategist with the world in his grasp was gone. In its place was a deep, disbelieving gloom.

'Vast Cicada has fallen... This is a disaster... Yang Ruiyi...'

The death of Vast Cicada was a world-shattering shock for Qi Lanyan. It wasn't just that a cultivator of Vast Cicada's caliber had been felled in a single blow; what terrified him more was the complete loss of control over the situation and the avalanche of troubles that followed!

Qi Lanyan's heart was a storm of gloom, anger, and urgency. But when he closed his eyes, he found that beneath it all, a faint trace of fear had settled.

This only made him angrier.

The atmosphere in the hall was suffocating. Tao Jiexing, however, could not remain silent. He took a step forward and said through gritted teeth:

"Junior saw that the celestial phenomena in the north were wrong... I suspected my cousin's... Dharma Body had been broken. But... but I performed a divination, and it was obscured by Exiled Qi. I couldn't see clearly. I came specifically to ask Senior..."

Qi Lanyan was speechless for a moment. He could only suppress his surging anger as he replied,

"Your cousin... has fallen."

Tao Jiexing and Li Jieyi had been as close as blood brothers, with a bond that was almost like that of an elder and junior. He had already suspected it, but this sentence confirmed his fears. He immediately bowed his head and began to weep, crying out in grief,

"Cousin... you lost your way! I told you... it was an unjust war! And now it has claimed you! What a tragedy!"

Tao Jiexing had no grasp of social graces. His words were pure gasoline on a fire, causing a Daoist-robed man prostrating nearby to tremble.

'Only he would dare to speak like that... To dare say such things and still have no one reprimand him... It's just too brutal!'

Sure enough, the words sent pulses of rage throbbing in Qi Lanyan's heart. His temples pulsed visibly.

But the Tao family was no ordinary clan. While not on par with his own Martial Uncle, Wei Xuanyin, they were still descendants of a True Monarch. Many of the Tao elders hailed from the Seeking the Purple Pavilion and had extensive connections. He could only force himself to say,

"Jiexing, what is this talk? He was tricked by the Yang clan!"

Tao Jiexing's face was streaked with tears. He looked up, his gaze instantly rebuffing Qi Lanyan's words. The youth gritted his teeth, his usual humility and simplicity shattering to pieces as he sobbed:

"Senior Qi! My cousin wasn't just a Maha of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm! He was a member of my Tao family! He was my cousin! He was Daoist Master Xuanwei's disciple-brother and Daoist Master Shaoxun's disciple! This matter doesn't just concern the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and Mount Dayang!"

Qi Lanyan's expression changed instantly. He hurriedly stepped forward.

"This was the scheming of Li Zhouwei and Yang Ruiyi!"

But the normally timid Tao Jiexing stood up, his brow filled with resolve. He said coldly,

"I will be reporting my cousin's death to my family. Senior Qi... you had better start thinking about how you are going to explain this!"
