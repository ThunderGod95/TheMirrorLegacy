# Chapter 1041: The Battle Ends

Audience with the Celestial Gate descended from the heavens, wreathed in roiling, iridescent flames. The Maha’s face was a mask of terror. Gritting his teeth, his body swelled rapidly in mid-air as he thrust his golden palms upward, forced to meet the attack head-on.

“Clang!”

The divine ability was undeniably cumbersome, but the moment it struck, an overwhelming suppressive force washed over him. His hands seemed to melt, sinking under the weight as an inferno of vibrant flames engulfed his body.

He was completely immobilized.

His golden form, as massive as a mountain, flickered and dimmed within the black-gold radiance of the Emperor Qi's Light. At this critical juncture, two more arms sprouted from Taixi’s back, clasping together before his chest to reveal a soft, pink luminescence glowing between his palms.

This pink light bloomed like a lotus flower, revealing countless silver specks within, like the flower’s stamens.

The Secret Art of Defiant Rebirth!

The Way of Emptiness was, after all, one of the Seven Phases. Even though the Daoist Tradition had collapsed when its ancient Dharma Master attempted to advance further, only to succumb violently to his own ego, and the entire Kosa Temple Sect had perished with him, their esoteric arts and secret texts had survived through the ages. Taixi, having cultivated for many years, had naturally picked up a technique or two.

As the lotus blossomed, the immense repulsive force it generated was completely neutralized by Sovereign's Perilous Tread. Yet, another stream of light erupted from its center, surging forward like a torrential river.

But Li Zhouwei was prepared. His old suit of armor, the Primal Summit Armor, had been reforged by Dingyang Zi into a true Spiritual Artifact. The process had been long and costly, and Li Zhouwei had kept it in reserve for this very moment. How could he possibly allow Taixi to cast another spell?

The black-gold armor instantly erupted with boundless, colorful flames. Surging umbral fire coiled around his body, making him appear several times larger as a baleful, demonic light gathered upon the tip of his halberd.

Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body!

The searing light of Profound Qi, imbued with a power that sundered all Dharma Arts, instantly diminished the lotus’s glow by a third. In the next moment, the golden, profound markings on the armor itself flared to life!

‘Divine Art: Pivotal Radiance.’

Illusions swarmed around Taixi. A brilliant, setting sun appeared in a vast and desolate landscape filled with the cries of battle. A searing crimson light materialized from nothingness, descending wrapped in the splendor of the Emperor Qi's Light and crashing down upon the lotus!

Taixi’s expression changed drastically. He urgently tried to recall the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl, but the shadow of karmic fire flickered into existence. A golden afterimage had already returned—the Pure Yang Bracelets descended, smashing violently against the bowl!

Without Taixi’s support, how could the mere demon-pacifying bowl possibly contend with the Pure Yang Bracelets? It was sent flying with a mournful wail.

Taixi was already struggling to fend off the Emperor Qi's Light with the bowl. The brutal impact sent a shock through their spiritual connection, and he let out a muffled grunt. Straining to maintain the spell in his hands, he was caught off guard and could no longer block the crimson light. The magnificent lotus instantly shattered with a deafening blast.

“Crack!”

The sound of shattering glass echoed as the halberd, like a venomous serpent, plunged into the chest of Taixi’s golden Dharma Body.

“BOOM!”

A cloud of lotus-pink dust and radiant, glazed light erupted from the wound, only to be instantly incinerated by the surging umbral flames. Taixi’s two hands snapped together, clamping down on the Grand Ascension.

But the long halberd wavered, held by no one!

Taixi’s eyes shot open. The Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body had already coalesced in the air above into a six-armed demon. The Profound Yellow Qi, differentiated from the Profound Qi, flooded the space around it as its six arms merged into one, gripping a massive battle-axe.

The axe was a deep, heavy brown-gold, its surface etched with a gleaming qilin pattern. Its bright white blade radiated an aura of terrifying, absolute sharpness.

It was the Radiant Sun King's Halberd!

“Clang!”

A jade skull, having finally arrived from its journey through the Great Void, appeared in front of the axe to block it. It lasted only long enough to produce a sound like shattering glass. The light paused for a bare instant before continuing its descent unimpeded.

Audience with the Celestial Gate trembled violently. For a moment, the sky above the entire lake shore blazed with light. Intense Heavenly Light flooded every corner, and the cultivators locked in combat high above were struck blind. Their flying dharma artifacts shuddered and began to plummet from the sky like dumplings dropped into a pot.

Taixi’s colossal body shattered. The enormous axe blade clove through him from his left shoulder to his ribs, splitting him clean in two. Boiling white steam rose from the ground as the massive golden form fell from the sky, crashing uncontrollably by the riverbank.

But Audience with the Celestial Gate was still pressing down!

High above, the Maha Mingxiang lowered his gaze slightly, his hands forming a seal.

‘Disciple-brother should be satisfied now.’

Though everything had happened in a flash, Mingxiang was not powerless to intervene. But why should he, the esteemed second disciple-brother of the Lotus Temple's Way of Joyful Bliss, save a Maha from the Way of Emptiness? Especially one who clearly harbored a deep enmity for his own junior.

While he didn't step in, he hadn't been idle. He had timed everything perfectly. A brilliant radiance gathered at his fingertips, and with a gentle flick, it shot forth.

On the other side of the battlefield, the churning river waters were violently parted. The general, Gongsun Bei, also wielded an axe. He cleaved through a gourd that blocked his path and rode the wind to press his attack, his brow etched with killing intent. His gaze was fixed unwaveringly on the Radiant Sun King's Halberd in Li Zhouwei’s hand.

A cyan jade bottle engraved with dazzling patterns suddenly fell from the sky. Gongsun Bei raised two fingers to the space between his eyebrows, focusing his dharma power to project a ray of clear light.

‘Plea to Supplant the Night.’

Bathed in this radiance, the jade bottle underwent a wondrous transformation. Seizing the moment when Li Zhouwei was fully committed to his assault, it tipped over, and a single, emerald-green droplet, like liquid jade, fell from its mouth.

“Drip!”

The moment the bead fell, a gloomy, sunless wind began to blow. The very air grew chaotic as a chilling rain fell, altering the flow of ambient qi. The Heavenly Light that had saturated the riverbank was suddenly suppressed and weakened, as if the remnants of night had been crossed, transforming it into a tranquil, blue-green light of the Lesser Yang that settled upon the land.

The overwhelming splendor of Audience with the Celestial Gate dimmed. The phantoms of phoenixes and luan birds vanished, and the golden-armored celestial soldiers and generals collapsed into dust. Li Zhouwei had already withdrawn his halberd and turned. Facing the incoming divine ability, he took a step forward to meet it, but instead staggered back as if drunk, coughing up a mouthful of blood.

“Cough, cough…”

A brilliant, lotus-shaped light clung stubbornly to the space between his eyebrows. Mingxiang’s expression grew grave. He exerted his power as if trying to restrain a ferocious beast, his usually calm face flushing slightly as his composure broke for the first time.

This gave Gongsun Bei the opening he needed. He strode forward, his red axe held high, and brought it down in a vicious arc!

Even at this point, Li Zhouwei refused to lift Audience with the Celestial Gate.

Taixi had been cleaved in two and his Dharma Body was shattered, but his spiritual consciousness, anchored to his ruined form by the Secret Art of Defiant Rebirth, refused to let his True Spirit return to the Buddhist Land. His heart was consumed by such extreme hatred that he would not yield!

‘He schemed against me… he just had to scheme against me! So many hidden trump cards… with a single axe! Just a single axe!’

His mind was a whirlwind of terror and madness.

‘You destroyed my Dharma Body, so I’ll be damned if I let you get off easy!’

The Secret Art of Defiant Rebirth was the ultimate life-saving technique of the Way of Emptiness. It used one’s connection to fate to preserve the spiritual consciousness and True Spirit within a cultivator’s remains, allowing one to survive a calamity and later be reborn from the corpse, a miraculous method that saved the immense cost of reincarnation. But Taixi knew that none of his supposed allies in the sky wished him well. Otherwise, how could he have ended up in this state? Who would bother to look after his remains?

Since reincarnation was no longer an option, his thoughts turned even more malicious.

‘I’ll detonate my remains with a sacred art and cripple your divine ability!’

Yet, the instant this thought formed, a profound terror arose within his True Spirit. A faint vision flickered before him: the stars in the sky were gazing down at him with cold indifference. He finally understood.

‘The battle is taking place by the river, which is teeming with mortals and low-level cultivators. There was a reason Li Zhouwei suppressed me here… He was waiting for me to self-destruct! He wanted me to harm countless innocent lives so the Star of Martial Cultivation would descend to punish me!’

The dawning fear, however, could not extinguish the venom in his heart. Believing he had seen through his opponent’s plan, Taixi felt a wave of smug satisfaction and watched with cold eyes.

‘He definitely doesn't know I have the Secret Art of Defiant Rebirth. Mingxiang and Gongsun Bei are fighting, so he absolutely has to recall Audience with the Celestial Gate! When he does, whether I choose to harm him or save myself will be entirely up to me!’

As the remnant on the ground spun his webs of intrigue, Li Zhouwei simply endured his discomfort and began forming hand seals. The light between his brows surged like a flood, only to be swiftly cut apart by the red axe, which was wreathed in the protection of the Dawn Qi divine ability. It bought him only a single instant.

He had no idea what Taixi was plotting on the ground. To him, under the scrutiny of the Immortal Artifact, the situation was perfectly clear. The man still refused to abandon his physical shell. Perhaps he had simply grown tired of living and was waiting for death.

Whatever his opponent's scheme, Li Zhouwei had only one response.

In that same moment, Sima Yuanli, who was being besieged by two Buddhist cultivators, heard a sharp and commanding voice ring in his ear.

“Daoist friend Sima! Lend me the Huai River Map!”

Upon hearing the call, the middle-aged man in green robes had a flash of understanding. His expression hardened as he reached for the Spiritual Treasure at his waist and untied it.

The movement was subtle, but how could the Buddhist cultivators under the effects of the divine ability not notice? Taixi, still clinging to his ruined body, was jolted to his senses. His mind reeled as if the heavens were falling.

‘Oh, hell! Damn it all to hell!’

Wait? What was there to wait for?

If he waited any longer, he would truly be dead!

The cautionary tale of Nu Xiao was fresh in his mind. Taixi was scared out of his wits. To hell with revenge, to hell with everything else! He couldn't even detonate his own body. All thoughts of enmity were but floating clouds in the face of annihilation. He decisively released the Secret Art of Defiant Rebirth, allowing his True Spirit to return to the Buddhist Land!

But in that exact, fleeting moment—in that split second—Sima Yuanli hesitated.

He paused for the briefest of instances. The scroll at his waist finally flew up, transforming into a colossal city wall that stretched across the sky. It shone with a thousand brilliant lights as it moved to intercept the jade bottle.

By then, however, Taixi’s mangled corpse had already collapsed. His point of True Spirit flashed through the Great Void like a reflection in a mirror before vanishing softly into the infinite darkness. On the other side, the battle-hardened Gongsun Bei would not grant his opponent a moment of hesitation. He strode forward, completely abandoning the jade bottle in the sky, and shoved the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform forward—a weapon he had held in reserve until now. Instantly, the entire battlefield was flooded with rolling waves of Dawn Qi!

Li Zhouwei’s face remained calm, but inwardly, he sighed heavily.

‘Sima Yuanli! Your mind is too clouded with trivialities… You’ve ruined my great plan!’

Li Zhouwei’s shout had carried several meanings, and he had guessed eight or nine-tenths of Sima Yuanli’s thoughts. The Huai River Map was an object of immense importance. If it fell into Li Zhouwei’s hands, even if only borrowed, its connection through the threads of fate could make its true ownership… uncertain.

Li Zhouwei had no intention of stealing it, but the situation on the field was deteriorating rapidly. Even with Taixi gone, their side was at a disadvantage. Gongsun Bei possessed a treasure that suppressed enemies with Dawn Qi. Even if Li Zhouwei managed to escape, he would have to pay a steep price. A Spiritual Treasure like the Huai River Map would make the perfect sacrifice to ensure his getaway.

If Sima Yuanli had retained control of the map, he would not have been stingy, using it to retreat at a moment's notice. But when combined with the potential for a power struggle against the Bright Yang Dao, Sima Yuanli had hesitated. In the end, he chose to use the Huai River Map to defend against the Spiritual Artifact and aid Li Zhouwei.

This could loosely be interpreted as “lending the Huai River Map,” but it undoubtedly caused the battlefield situation to worsen.

‘Sima Yuanli isn't normally an indecisive man. If he were, he wouldn't have rushed here without even stopping to rest, ignoring the Song court’s decree… He lacks true boldness. Too much petty thinking…’

‘Well, at least I managed to scare Taixi away. That’s one less thing to worry about!’

Fighting off a wave of intense dizziness, Li Zhouwei felt a pang of regret but did not waste energy on blame. He forced himself backward, raising the Grand Ascension to defend. Axe and halberd clashed. A brilliant light flared, only to be swiftly extinguished.

Gongsun Bei was no common foe. Li Zhouwei was still contending with Mingxiang’s pressure and now lacked support. He had raised his halberd in haste, with the enemy holding a clear advantage. In the end, he could not parry the blow. The red axe swept the Grand Ascension aside and struck him square in the chest.

The first thing to flare up was the surging umbral flame. The dense Profound Qi of the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body produced an unexpectedly miraculous effect, neutralizing the bulk of the divine ability’s radiant power. Only then did the light of the armor itself shine forth.

This suit of Primal Summit Armor had been utterly transformed. Its second divine art, the one that came after ‘Pivotal Radiance,’ activated, causing his entire body to flash with the light of the Yang Cusp.

‘Primal Molt!’

Li Zhouwei’s face flushed a deep crimson as he coughed up another mouthful of blood. The Yang Cusp light on his armor flickered, but it had greatly mitigated the force of the divine ability. Moreover, he rode the burst of light to propel himself away, throwing the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform into disarray. For a moment, it couldn't lock onto his position.

‘You think you can run?’

Gongsun Bei was already prepared. He once again touched two fingers to the space between his eyebrows. The cold, clear light of ‘Plea to Supplant the Night’ shone down again, instantly and completely dissipating the layers of Yang Cusp light around Li Zhouwei.

But in the instant ‘Primal Molt’ had activated, Li Zhouwei was already charging forward. In concert with the immediately responding Sovereign's Perilous Tread, he shattered all the restraints around him and shot directly toward Mingxiang!

Mingxiang raised a hand to intercept him, but his heart suddenly stirred, as if he were listening to a distant voice. The mudra his hands were forming naturally shifted. The monk raised an eyebrow, his gaze shifting to the distant, calm-faced Gongsun Bei, who had just shaken a talisman from his sleeve.

Talisman of the Pacified Frontier and Boundless Night!

An overwhelming torrent of cold light poured down, but it wasn't aimed at Li Zhouwei. Instead, it swarmed into the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform, causing it to shine with infinite brilliance. It locked onto Li Zhouwei from afar and descended upon him.

For a moment, the sky was ablaze with light. The pale golden platform enveloped the heavens. Two short halberds soared out from it like a pair of wild geese, moving with a deceptive speed that was both slow and fast. At the very edge of the platform, they finally intercepted the long halberd.

“Clang!”

Li Zhouwei gripped his weapon tightly, watching as the sky was rapidly sealed by Dawn Qi. He finally let out a long breath. The Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body swelled, transforming into a ferocious, jet-black demon wreathed in raging umbral flames. Pushing back against the heavy golden chains raining down from above, his voice echoed, deep and resonant:

“The Northern Cultivators and Northern Buddhists have truly gone to great lengths. This king shall see for himself just how capable General Gongsun truly is!”

Gongsun Bei’s gaze was cool and calm. “It is my mission,” he said in a low voice. “I have no choice but to be meticulous.”

The platform in the sky became a uniform color as a pale yellow light screen enveloped all Heavenly Light. Gongsun Bei and Li Zhouwei were both submerged within it. Mingxiang sighed under his breath and rode his lotus platform into the light screen as well, after which all color and sound vanished completely.

Sima Yuanli saw it all happen, and a sense of dread filled his heart. Fearing the worst, he redoubled his attacks, unleashing his treasures with even greater ferocity. Yet Minghui and Five-Eyed were both clearly distracted. He was somehow pressing them both back single-handedly, putting them in constant peril.

As the Huai River Map slammed down, Five-Eyed was finally jolted back to his senses. The profound umbrella he had been suppressing with all his might was suddenly loosened. A rope had materialized from nowhere and bound it. With a sharp tug, the umbrella was ripped from his grasp.

As he pulled the treasure in, Sima Yuanli was drenched in cold sweat, his heart pounding with relief.

‘Just making up for my earlier blunder…’

Unexpectedly, the Merciful One’s face twisted in rage, but inwardly, he too felt a wave of relief. He began to wail and cry to the heavens.

‘Immortal Venerable above… I didn't do it on purpose!’

Just then, at that precise moment, streaks of white qi shot across the sky. A golden Dharma Body, glowing with pure white light, descended from the heavens, bringing with it a blinding radiance that drew the gaze of every person present. They all felt a collective jolt of shock.

This Maha arrived riding the wind, his expression solemn and majestic, his tone as cold as ice.

“Fellow Daoists, Yanbai has come to assist!”

But as this Maha from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm surveyed the scene, he saw Five-Eyed gritting his teeth at Sima Yuanli while Minghui chanted sutras with his head bowed, his fists clenched tight. They were all completely absorbed in their own affairs, as if they had no time to spare him a glance. A strange feeling crept into Yanbai’s heart.

‘How odd,’ he thought to himself. ‘Why is the atmosphere here so bizarre…’
