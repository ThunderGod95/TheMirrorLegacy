### Chapter 784: Settling Matters with Purple Smoke

Li Zhouluo walked ahead, introducing Wen Wu to several of the isle’s cultivation spots. Wen Wu was exceedingly gracious, nodding repeatedly.

"I have heard of this place!" he said. "Rumor has it that this was once a market city. My master cultivated here in her youth and often told me what a fine place it was. She said its key locations were no worse than those in our Blessed Land."

Li Quewan listened intently, but she noticed that Li Quexi, at her side, was walking with hurried steps. The girl was nearly a full body length ahead of her, trying to stay close to Wen Wu.

"Eldest Senior Brother," she asked with great curiosity, "how does this place compare to Mu Zuo Peak?"

Wen Wu chuckled and gave a vague reply.

"Mu Zuo is the second peak of the Blessed Land. Its spiritual energy is so abundant it ranks among the best in all of Jiangnan. However, according to my master, back when she cultivated in the market here, the most expensive location was every bit as good as Mu Zuo Peak."

Pingya Isle was an excellent place, its spiritual energy far more balanced and potent than the surrounding lakeshore. But Li Zhouluo knew it was no match for the Purple Smoke Blessed Land, let alone one of its immortal peaks.

Wen Wu's words were diplomatic. The isle may have been comparable in the past, but after the great war to eradicate the Chen Clan remnants and years of suffering under a great sealing formation, it had long since lost its former glory.

"There is no comparison, of course," Li Zhouluo said with a smile. "The Blessed Land belongs to the Green Pine Supreme Yang Dao Lineage, a heritage a thousand years strong. My family falls far short!"

Since Li Zhouluo had stated it so plainly, Wen Wu could only swallow the awkwardness and reply, "Your noble clan rose from humble beginnings. The bearing and ambition of your ancestors are things we at Purple Smoke have long admired."

The younger girl had now moved a full step forward. As she was not the primary host, Li Quewan couldn't very well walk ahead of their guest. The angle became awkward, and she had to release Li Quexi's hand, holding only her sister Li Queyi's.

Soon, they arrived at Li Quexi’s family home. Li Zhouluo and Wen Wu led the girl into the small courtyard, where they were met with a chorus of joyful laughter and effusive compliments. Li Quewan, holding Li Queyi, stopped outside, deciding not to enter. She straightened her younger sister’s collar and spoke softly.

"Your sister Quexi is still young and doesn't understand many things. A girl not yet of an age to wear hairpins... this is a time of vanity. You can't expect her to handle things perfectly. In the Blessed Land, she will have few to guide her. If you get a chance to see her, you should offer her some reminders."

"Elder Sister..."

Though Li Queyi had a sweet appearance, she was older and understood the subtleties of the situation. "I saw the Blessed Land on our way," she said tactfully. "Ziqi Peak is not faring well... For them to form a connection with our family, the immortal gate likely felt they couldn't neglect the favor owed to the Daoist Master. Quexi's acceptance was genuine; mine was merely an excuse to round out the deal. Once we enter the gate, our statuses will be very different. I'm afraid I will be the one needing her to remember the bonds of sisterhood and help me. Even though I am a few years older, it would not be my place to lecture her."

Although the Purple Smoke Gate honored ancient customs and did without the formal division of inner and outer disciples, the distinction between the strong and the weak was everywhere, giving rise to countless differences in status. Li Quewan understood this perfectly and sighed to herself.

'Sister Quexi is still a child, after all. She believes her talent is exceptional, that she is different from ordinary people, and that she earned the favor of a great cultivator through her own merit. She has no idea it was all because of the Daoist Master's connections... If Queyi had been born three or five years later, this opportunity would never have been hers.'

Li Quewan waited for a moment before raising her head. She had cultivated an ocular art, and her vision was superb. She spotted Li Xuanxuan and Ling Yanzi strolling not far away, clearly having followed them.

She quickly pulled her sister along to greet them. "Greetings, esteemed Senior! Greetings, esteemed Elder!"

Ling Yanzi nodded repeatedly. Li Queyi also greeted him as "Master." Seeing the heavy atmosphere between the two old men, Li Quewan, ever the elder sister, quickly tried to smooth things over.

"For my sister to receive the esteemed Senior's guidance is truly her great fortune. If she faces any difficulties within the sect, or if our family fails to provide sufficient cultivation resources, she is young and shy and may not speak up. I ask that Senior please write to us."

Normally, once a disciple entered a sect, the family's provision of resources was carefully considered; there was no logic in giving too little or too much. But Ziqi Peak was so poor that Ling Yanzi had to fight for his own Foundation Establishment resources. By having her family supply Li Queyi's needs, she could share with her fellow disciples, which would naturally earn her their goodwill.

The suggestion to "write to us" was also a way to offer Ling Yanzi a graceful exit, so he wouldn't lose face by asking a disciple for resources. He could simply request them from the Li family directly. Ling Yanzi understood perfectly and nodded slightly.

"Her senior brothers and sisters are all good people. Queyi will not be wronged on my peak."

Li Xuanxuan walked beside them with his hands behind his back, his earlier joy having completely vanished. Li Zhouluo soon returned to escort Ling Yanzi and Li Queyi to meet her family elders.

When all the arrangements were finally settled, Wen Wu and his contingent prepared to return to their sect. After tearful goodbyes between the two families, Wen Wu walked briskly to Li Xuanxuan's side.

"Venerable Senior, please join me in the hall for a private discussion," he said with a smile.

Li Xuanxuan understood at once. He dismissed his attendants and entered the hall with Wen Wu.

"Venerable Senior," the man began politely, "Daoist Master Zhaojing left a Purple Mansion formation with my master. He was to provide medicinal pills, and in return, she was to come to the lake to set up the formation. But now that the Daoist Master is away, this matter has been delayed..."

"A Purple Mansion formation?!"

The words caught in Li Xuanxuan’s throat, and his heart pounded. His grandson had not communicated much with the family since becoming a Daoist Master; he had no idea he had secretly arranged for such a powerful defensive array. The old man's voice trembled with surprised delight.

"The Daoist Master's meaning is...?!"

Wen Wu lowered his voice. "My master inquired about the situation. Seeing that Daoist Master Zhaojing has not returned and knowing this is a critical time, she thought to find an opportunity to come to the lake first and set up the formation for you."

Li Xuanxuan was now truly overcome with a mixture of shock and joy. "My family's Daoist Master... has been gone for so long, he cannot fulfill his promise," he hesitated. "For Daoist Master Tinglan to show such profound generosity, Moongaze Lake... is both deeply grateful and terribly anxious. I do not know how we can accept!"

Whatever deal Li Ximing had struck with Tinglan, the alchemy was surely part of it. For her to offer to set up the formation first was completely unexpected. Li Xuanxuan voiced his disbelief, and Wen Wu replied:

"This matter... has long been on my master's mind. That day, I was with her when she met your Daoist Master. She sighed repeatedly, saying that Changxiao's actions were unexpected and that it was her own miscalculation that she could not help him. Setting up this formation first is her way of making amends."

"My Purple Smoke Blessed Land follows the righteous path; we are not like those who have migrated from overseas. Venerable Senior, please do not worry."

Seeing the old man nod, Wen Wu continued, "There is just one thing I must make clear. My master is currently occupied with an urgent matter. It will take about a year. After that time, the Capital immortals Dao will have retreated."

With this information, Li Xuanxuan finally felt a sense of security.

"Now that the two young ladies have entered the Blessed Land," Wen Wu went on, "the gate's rules are clear. Since they are women, their entry does not prevent them from continuing your immortal clan's lineage. However, the matter of their marriages will be decided by them and our Blessed Land. They are now people of the Purple Smoke Gate, and we will not permit them to be engaged in arranged alliances."

"That is only natural," Li Xuanxuan's voice was low and hoarse. "Ever since the example set by my own sister, our lake has largely abandoned that practice. Unless it is by mutual consent, I have put a stop to any such notions. Later, when Qinghong and Minggong succeeded in their cultivation, we had their examples to follow, and the clan no longer placed limits based on gender. It is only because the Veiled Yin is not prominent that we naturally have fewer female cultivators, making it seem as if the men are more numerous."

Li Xuanxuan knew that Purple Smoke was a sect led by female cultivators and chose his words with extra care. Wen Wu nodded gently, clearly already aware of this.

"Although the Blessed Land follows ancient customs, most things must still be earned through one's own efforts. The young ladies will inevitably face some hardships. I ask for your understanding."

His words were not directed at anyone else but Li Queyi. The two of them walked out together. The spirit boat was waiting for Wen Wu alone. The deck was silent, with no sign of impatience. Li Queyi stood to one side with Ling Yanzi; since he was familiar with the Li family, her position was even better than on the journey there. Li Quexi, meanwhile, stood at the prow. Her eyes were red, but she was the center of attention, a figure of glory.

As the purple mist drifted away, most of the cultivators left behind looked on with envy. Only Li Zhouluo glanced once before turning back. He followed Li Xuanxuan into the hall, and once they were alone, he frowned.

"Elder, it seems to me that the girl Quexi is a bit too frivolous. Now that she has obtained a Dao lineage, I do not know if it is for better or for worse."

Li Xuanxuan, in his old age, had seen it all quite clearly. But the news of the Purple Mansion formation had put him in a good mood. "It is human nature," he said in his weary voice. "Do not be too harsh. It's not just Quexi. Which of our juniors, having received such favor, wouldn't hold their head a little higher standing on that prow? It's just that she appears a little too eager."

Li Quewan added in a gentle tone, "I think we must treat her well from now on. Regardless of whether she cares for the family, the family must be good to her. Even if she becomes a high-level cultivator of the Purple Smoke Gate, her name will still begin with Li."

The other two nodded in agreement. The old man asked about family affairs.

"All is peaceful," Li Zhouluo reported. "We received news from the Xiao family. The Yushan branch wished to return for a visit, but that area has been unstable recently, and they have been unable to make the trip."

"Qingxiao... tell her to take care of herself."

Seeing they were alone, Li Xuanxuan recounted what Wen Wu had told him. The other two were equally overjoyed. Li Zhouluo paced around the hall twice before whispering, "Another year or two... I wonder if it's because Changxiao has yet to reveal himself... I only hope we can pass this time safely."

Li Quewan offered her thoughts. "Since the Capital immortals Dao is retreating, the wilderness they vacate should be returned to the Profound Peak Gate. Our family has done all we can in this matter and should not interfere further. In this junior's opinion, we should place them back in their original territory and let them re-establish their sect. Let this matter be concluded. We should not waste any more effort on it."

"Agreed," Li Zhouluo replied. The Profound Peak Gate was endlessly grateful, and the Li family had profited greatly from their decline. But with their own Daoist Master missing, they had grown fearful of further entanglement, regardless of whether Li Ximing's disappearance was intentional or part of some deeper plan.

As the three were talking, a shout came from outside. Li Zhouluo dispelled the privacy formation and frowned. "What is happening?"

The newcomer was Dili Guang. He dropped to the ground in a deep bow, his voice filled with joy.

"My Lord, Elder Lord... Lord Cui has returned to the isle with Protector Ding!"

"Excellent!"

With the return of these two powerful, Foundation Establishment-level combatants, Li Xuanxuan felt a great weight lift from his heart. Li Zhouluo strode forward, beaming.

"Have them come in at once!"

A moment later, the magnificently robed Cui Jueyin entered. Following behind him was a burly man with the jaw of a swallow and the whiskers of a tiger. He was powerfully built, his eyes sharp and imbued with a mysterious power that sent a chill down the spine of anyone who met his gaze.

It was Ding Weizeng.

"Excellent, excellent!"

Li Xuanxuan, hearing one piece of good news after another, descended from the dais. Cui Jueyin immediately bowed his head in a deep salute, while Ding Weizeng moved forward to gently support him.

"With the two of you back," Li Xuanxuan said, "the lake has nothing to fear!"

Ding Weizeng looked slightly awkward, but Cui Jueyin recounted the full story of their experiences. Hearing it, Li Xuanxuan’s old eyes grew red. "As long as you returned safely..."

But Ding Weizeng dropped to his knees with a thud. "Reporting to my lord! This subordinate has returned only to make adjustments. Once I have prepared enough pills and resources, I will immediately depart for the Eastern Sea to find the Daoist Master!"

"What?"

Li Xuanxuan was stunned, momentarily thinking the man meant to abandon them for another clan. Cui Jueyin had to explain his intentions. The old man sighed repeatedly, but Ding Weizeng remained kneeling stubbornly.

"Protector Ding," Li Quewan tried to persuade him, "if you go to the Eastern Sea and someone traces you back to the Daoist Master, won't your good intentions backfire?"

Ding Weizeng shook his head gently. "Weizeng is not of the lake's bloodline, so I cannot be easily traced. The Daoist Master would not meet with me. But if I venture determinedly deep into the sea, I can draw the attention of other Purple Mansion cultivators, easing the pressure on him."

Li Quewan was about to say more, but the old man stopped her. Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard. Though he worried for his grandson, he understood that Ding Weizeng’s journey to the Eastern Sea would, in all likelihood, stir up immense turmoil. It could not only cost the man his life but also cause untold trouble.

'If Ximing can escape, what need has he of him? If he cannot, what use is he?'

'Judging by the soul lamp, Ximing is not yet at death's door. The Eastern Sea is vast. Where would one even begin to look for him?'

He spoke with a calm voice. "Did the Daoist Master leave any orders for you?"

"He did not..." Ding Weizeng hesitated slightly.

"Since you received no orders," Li Xuanxuan continued, "how can you know he is truly injured? Could it not be that he is feigning injury, hiding in the sea to lure out his enemies? If you rush to the Eastern Sea and ruin the Daoist Master's plan, what crime would that be?"

At these words, understanding dawned on Cui Jueyin's face. Ding Weizeng was shocked speechless. Even Li Zhouluo and Li Quewan stood frozen in place, the hall falling into a sudden, deep silence.

A cold sweat broke out on Ding Weizeng's back. He bowed low, his voice trembling with lingering fear. "Thank you for your guidance, my lord! If not for the Elder Lord's prudence, Weizeng would have made a grave mistake! From now on, this subordinate will focus solely on protecting the lake and await the Daoist Master's return!"

***

On the Purple Qi Spirit Boat.

The Purple Smoke Gate's spirit boat was quite spacious, its interior much larger than it appeared from the outside. While it couldn't compare to the Azure Pond Sect's world-famous Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner, it was still a luxurious Dharma Artifact of the highest order.

It departed from the lake and soon reached the untamed wilderness. After seeing to the other passengers, Wen Wu returned to the prow, where his new junior sister, Li Quexi, was leaning against the railing, watching the scenery.

Wen Wu clasped his hands behind his back and strolled over. The girl immediately looked up, her smile as innocent as a child's, reminding him of his own daughter. "Eldest Senior Brother!" she chirped.

Wen Wu nodded slightly. "Junior Sister, why aren't you with your sister?"

Li Quexi lowered her voice. "I am not very familiar with my sister. I was only brought to the main isle when I was nine and my talent was deemed sufficient. That was the first time I met her. We only exchanged simple greetings. So many people flocked around her back then; I never joined the crowd. We've barely spoken a few sentences."
