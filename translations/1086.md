# Chapter 1086: Comings and Goings

Chi Buzi watched him, his expression serene.

'I considered countless ways to phrase this on my way here,' Chi Buzi thought.

'But it doesn't matter. This mountain is undoubtedly crawling with the eyes and ears of those great figures. I cannot reveal too much. If I say anything that even touches upon the plans of the patron backing the Li Clan, I'll be inviting a fatal disaster!'

'My lack of memory about the lake incident reveals two things.'

'First, this powerful being is likely confined to that lake. He must have made an immense sacrifice during the fall of the Immortal Mansion, so great that He cannot even show His face. Why else would He need to be so secretive? Second, He don't want to expose our connection... or perhaps, His "compromise" was a calculated move, designed to use me to acquire even greater benefits.'

'Since the power behind the Fox-kin is an Immortal Mansion cultivator, what other reason could He have for using me? It's clearly for the restoration of the Mansion Water!'

'The station of the Mansion Water is far from ordinary. In the eyes of a cultivator like me, Chi Buzi, with my deep Dao-Profundity and ancient lineage, it is exceptionally special. The Mansion Water has lost its vastness... that phrase is no empty talk!'

'In ancient times, there was a great upheaval. Dongfang Rijiu, the leader of the Hornless Dragon lineage, secretly lent his aid to the master of the orthodox 'Pit Water' position. Together, they slew the Profound Giant Turtle and borrowed the very essence of the Mansion Water's vastness...'

'The master of Pit Water seized that vastness, but then failed in his breakthrough to the Dao Embryo realm and perished. Ever since, that essence of vastness has been locked within the Pit Water Fruition Attainment, unable to be released.'

'The consequence of this 'Orthodox Position Seizing the Abyss' is that the true Pit Water position became nearly impossible to attain. Subsequent Mansion Water cultivators could not claim its full inheritance. Instead, they mostly achieved Leap positions, subservient to the Three Yins. The Dao became twisted and perilous, its masters ephemeral. But it is not a dead end! It is a path I can successfully claim!'

Thus, the purpose of the Fox-kin placing him into the hands of the Dragon-kin became clear,

'Judging by what Dingjiao implied, it's highly likely this Lord Xuan'an is no longer willing to guard the Immortal Mansion and has decided to seek His own fortune. That's why He placed a wager on me, hoping to cultivate an allied True Monarch. But even though the Mansion Water has lost its vastness and is a shadow of its former self, there are still countless people who would prevent the Immortal Mansion's remnants from rising from the ashes. He must have concealed this scheme beneath the Dragon-kin's plot to eliminate the Pristine Water Feathered Serpent. That explains the whole arrangement!'

Having clarified this, his, Chi Buzi's, objectives narrowed down to two crucial points.

'First, for my own survival, I must find a way—in full public view—to officially align myself with the Dragon-kin.'

'In the current situation, before I attain the Dao, there's no guarantee someone won't try to harm me. Only Du Qing and the Dragon-kin have a vested interest in protecting me. Since that great figure exposed my weakness to the Dragon-kin, it was a signal for me to seek refuge with them. This is my lifeline, and it's also a cover for that great figure... After all, Du Qing's influence is limited to the mainland. To operate overseas, I must rely on the Dragon-kin!'

'Who Li Zhouwei actually supports is irrelevant. What matters is using his words to drape this dragon's hide over me, Chi Buzi!'

'Second, and only then, can I show my loyalty to that great figure.'

He, Chi Buzi, had to make his allegiance crystal clear. Only then might he obtain the most important thing of all:

The Quest for Gold method!

An Immortal Mansion-grade Mansion Water Quest for Gold method!

'But to pledge my loyalty here would destroy Xuan'an's scheme and be the end of my own life. I will not underestimate the perception of these great figures. When I finally face Xuan'an, I only need to indicate that I've successfully allied with the Dragon-kin. Anything more, even one extra word... would be exposing His entire plan!'

It was this complex web of considerations that led Chi Buzi to adopt the Dragon-kin's stance.

As for mentioning Li Jiangqun, that was to confirm whether Li Ximing truly knew who stood behind him.

'A great figure?'

But when Li Ximing heard this, his mind became perfectly clear, and a name surfaced in his thoughts.

'Is it Lord Zhengao? Or... which great figure could it be?'

'I haven't forgotten where the token for the High Firmament Pavilion in my possession came from! It was left behind by Li Jiangqun all those years ago, and my clan even used his immortal merits... But behind that Immortal Mirror isn't just one great figure. It's the entirety of the Heavens!'

'In terms of Dao-Profundity, spiritual lineage, and even our true political backing, you could say my clan has inherited Li Jiangqun's mantle!'

'For Chi Buzi to mention Li Jiangqun specifically... it's hard to say it isn't a hint!'

He fell silent for a moment, his brow furrowing slightly, and then replied,

"The great lineages have already made contact several times. It's surprising they'd trouble the Daoist Master to come and read another decree."

Chi Buzi needed only that one glance to understand.

'Assuming Li Ximing isn't trying to be clever or deliberately deceive me, he has likely grasped something. He isn't completely ignorant of who is behind me. He might even be a participant.'

He lowered his gaze slightly and said casually,

"There are differences between the ancestral branches."

Li Ximing stared at him intently. Chi Buzi had already stepped forward, speaking softly,

"I have served under the Dragon King for many years, avoiding calamity and seeking but a single opportunity to pursue the Dao. But I have not ignored worldly affairs completely. If King Wei hadn't met with the Dragon Prince long ago, how could I have sat by and done nothing for all these years? And how else would your esteemed clan have survived peacefully to this day?"

Li Ximing frowned and looked up, inwardly alarmed.

'An opportunity to pursue the Dao... No wonder. He threw in his lot with the Dragons!'

Chi Buzi simply stared at him, his eyes narrowed slightly, as he listened to Li Ximing's cold laugh.

"No wonder you don't dare return to the mainland. I wonder how many people there would tolerate your presence, 'Daoist friend'!"

He had probed four times in a row. With just this one sentence, Chi Buzi had finally distinguished truth from falsehood. His mind cleared, and everything became obvious,

'Li Ximing might know a few scraps, but he absolutely does not know the real key. The true master of the Li Clan, the one who actually serves that great figure, must be Li Zhouwei. This Alchemist has only heard fragments and rumors!'

'It's simple. Li Ximing almost certainly assumes I am seeking the Pristine Water! He also must not know about the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. Otherwise, why would he even mention me returning to the mainland?!'

'The Dragon-kin and the Pristine Water are at odds, so it's perfectly logical for them to support me. Li Ximing's judgment is sound. But the illogical part of this whole affair is that the Pristine Water also supports my Quest for Gold!'

'In that case... if I want to safely connect with that great figure, the only suitable target is Li Zhouwei!'

As his thoughts reached this point, he sensed Fuxuan behind him, his face twisting in discomfort. He had opened his mouth several times and was now visibly agitated.

'No matter. I've already managed to probe a few things. Since he's useless... talking to him any further will only arouse unnecessary suspicion.'

The two of them were probing each other covertly, much to Fuxuan's misery.

'These two... these two! They're really treating my Chunyi Dao Gate like it's just any old place!'

'Even they know that my family's Great Daoist Master Yuanshang is on the verge of a breakthrough, and that a host of great figures from the Great Void and Beyond the Heavens will be watching. How could I, Fuxuan, not know?! Every word they say makes my heart pound and my head split!'

'If I let you two keep talking, are you going to drag the Pristine Water and the Dragon Monarch into it? Do you know how many great figures are staring at this tiny little place right now? If a Heavenly Glow descends on my mountain because of this, how is my Master supposed to complete his breakthrough?!'

His expression was awful. He shot Chi Buzi a venomous glare and was just about to speak when he saw a man in white robes hurrying up the mountain path. The man wore a robe patterned with waves and crescent moons. It was Daoist Master Che Hong. He bowed to the two of them and said,

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing... The Great Daoist Master requests your presence!"

Li Ximing's face turned solemn, though he sighed inwardly. He turned to Chi Buzi, his eyes narrowing slightly, and replied,

"Daoist Master, serving under the Dragon-kin now... you've certainly found yourself a fine master. We shall see how this plays out!"

Chi Buzi just roared with laughter. Under Fuxuan's murderous gaze, his form shifted, transforming into a splash of clear Pristine Water, and vanished into the depths of the Great Void.

Li Ximing flicked his sleeve and followed Che Hong deeper into the mountain. His heart grew heavy once more, and he remained silent for a long time.

'Chi Buzi... is he even the same person anymore?'

'The man before me was definitely not the half-human, half-ghost Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from all those years ago. But after that encounter, Chi Buzi couldn't have remained completely unchanged... It's possible he's been possessed by that Immortal Official, merely wearing his original appearance as a disguise!'

'What shook me even more was what I saw through the Immortal Mirror's sight: a vibrant light emanating from his body! The light was a hazy gray, yet it was incredibly dense, pulsing with a vigorous might!'

'He is the second person I've seen with a shimmering radiance under the Immortal Mirror's sight...'

'The first was Li Suining, who is still under house arrest back home. And I saw it clearly: although the colors of their radiances were different, the form was identical. They shared the same root, the same source!'

'What does this mean?!'

Li Ximing was instantly silenced by the thought.

'If Chi Buzi has likely been possessed, becoming a hidden agent of that Immortal Official from the Immortal Mirror, or perhaps of the Heavens themselves... then is it possible that Li Suining, back home, is also a pawn of the Heavens? Or that the opportunity he gained was a boon granted by the Heavens?'

The uncertainty lingered in his mind, leaving him distracted and shaken. He didn't snap out of it until Che Hong, leading him, stopped before a stone gate. He heard the white-robed Daoist Master say,

"Daoist friend, please!"

He looked up and saw, hanging in the depths of the cave dwelling, a mirror shimmering with silver light!

The mirror was no more than eight inches across. Its frame was snow-white, its surface as clear as moonlight, and it was adorned with patterns of auspicious clouds supporting the moon. The frame itself was carved with coiling Hornless Dragons. Merely hanging there, it emanated an aura of terrifying power.

'A Spiritual Treasure!'

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow slightly, marveling at the treasure's power, but he also felt a twinge of something else.

'It really is a spiritual mirror.'

Che Hong bowed deeply. A cascade of silvery light sprinkled down, and layers upon layers of osmanthus blossoms piled up like snow. The two of them passed deep into it, as if entering an entirely new world.

Before them stood a simple table and a single chair. An old man stood beside the round table.

He was not tall, with snow-white hair and a full, rounded forehead. His eyes were ancient and filled with vicissitude. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back. When the two approached, he turned his head slightly and spoke,

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

This was none other than Daoist Master Yuanshang!

Che Hong had already bowed and stepped aside. Li Ximing hurriedly returned the courtesy, saying:

"This junior is unworthy!"

As he bowed, he raised his eyes to look. The Great Daoist Master was also looking at him.

This Great Daoist Master's divine ability was clearly perfected, yet his appearance held no trace of profound mystery. His gaze was exceptionally gentle, tinged with a look of gratified joy. His pair of gray-black eyes gazed over, allowing Li Ximing to relax somewhat.

Yuanshang lowered his head and said,

"That is not quite accurate... You and I... we should be considered family."

Li Ximing was slightly taken aback. He saw Daoist Master Yuanshang smile.

"When the Great Ning State was founded, the Xi Clan and the Ning-Li Clan were joined by marriage. My grandmother's surname was also Li."

Li Ximing had actually anticipated something like this, but he still hesitated, saying,

"These days, the world knows my family as part of the Wei-Li Bright Yang bloodline..."

Daoist Master Yuanshang waved his hand, motioning for him to sit. "The Wei-Li are not necessarily the Ning-Li, but the Ning-Li are definitely Wei-Li. Back then, among the Bright Yang Wei-Li, a branch cultivated in the Immortal Mansion. Among them was a great figure who, while traveling, came to study under the Wandering Immortal Wu Che. His surname was Li, and his respected name was Hengqing. He was a great figure who had perfected the Supreme Yin and ascended to the pinnacle."

Li Ximing's breath caught in his chest. He hesitated, stunned.

"To think... such a noble origin!"

He had imagined many possible origins, but he had never once thought that an ancestor of the Ning-Li Clan was actually a True Monarch!

"How could we have... fallen to such a state!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang shook his head and sighed.

"Later, it seems this True Monarch perished in his pursuit of the Dao, but he left behind his bloodline. They received a mandate from the Wei and were enfiefed in Jiangbei, becoming the Jiangbei Li Clan. Over the years, they produced numerous geniuses, including many who perfected their divine ability!"

"And Daoist Master Donghua was the most outstanding among them!"

Yuanshang turned, a profound depth entering his gaze.

"Yuansu... Yuansu knew all along! He used the name of the Bright Yang Li Clan merely to protect you!"

Yuanshang was younger. In the era when he cultivated, the Chunyi Dao Gate was still very weak and not even recognized by the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. But even so, he had met Yuanxiu and Yuansu. How could he not be moved?

Hearing this, Li Ximing rose to his feet.

"So that's how it was..."

The old man's expression dimmed. He turned to look at Li Ximing, his lips moving.

"That matter, all those years ago... it wasn't that we didn't know. In fact, Fuxuan went to inquire! But... by that time, we could no longer persuade Chi Wei... and we couldn't risk a major conflict..."

Li Ximing understood he was speaking of his ancestors. But having seen so much indifference in the world, he actually felt Daoist Master Yuanshang was being too hard on himself. He raised his brow.

"How can this be blamed on you, Senior!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang took a step forward and said simply, "This blame falls on me."

His eyes were filled with sorrow, even a deep-seated shame. His lips trembled as he spoke.

"Back then, the last Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Ning-Li Immortal Clan... Great Daoist Master Guanyu... entered seclusion in my sect. He entrusted the last of the Ning-Li legacy to us. He not only filled in the many missing and altered cultivation methods in our lineage, but he also used his vast resources to help our sect survive its darkest hour... This debt of gratitude... I should never have forgotten it!"

"But at that time, I was still focused on refining my divine ability... and Fuxuan... he did not dare to offend that fiend!"

The old man took a step back and bowed deeply.

"This is truly my sin."

Li Ximing was stunned by this barrage of revelations, unsure how to react. Honestly, whether it was the Ning-Li or the Wei-Li, it was all too remote. The Li Clan was already collapsing under the weight of the Wei-Li legacy; how could they possibly bear the karmic burden of the Ning-Li as well?

He stepped back from his seat and stood, lowering his gaze.

"Senior, you overstate things!"

But Che Hong, who had been watching from the side, felt his heart ache. He moved to support the old man.

"Great Daoist Master... didn't you also take out all the scriptures from our sect for him to study? Didn't you gift him secret methods and that precious Mystic Pill from our treasury? Even if there is a debt, how great can it be!"

Hearing this, Yuanshang's expression grew even darker. He was silent for a long moment, his eyes filled with a long-accumulated gloom. He whipped his head around, hissing through clenched teeth,

"Ignorant child... You are an ignorant child!"

The old man's expression flickered, and it was unclear who he was cursing. But Che Hong, having been rebuked so harshly, looked terrified. His hands trembled, and he didn't dare to support him, crying out in alarm,

"My lord... compose yourself... my lord!"
