# Chapter 671: Inquiry

Dingjiao spoke in a low voice. Bai Rong glanced at him, a flicker of hesitation in his eyes. After all, some things were not meant to be heard by just anyone. "Your Highness," he whispered, "do you have any information? This place is strange. If the one below has too powerful a background, we could break a serious taboo."

'So Bai Rong doesn't know who it is either…'

Of the three, he was the one who had to personally listen. If anything went wrong, Bai Rong would be the first to suffer. Dingjiao naturally understood his concerns and kept his voice low. "Don't worry. An elder once mentioned it. The person below is not a Golden Core cultivator. If a Golden Core master were crying out in pain, how could we possibly still be alive? Uncle Heyun would have appeared to warn us long ago…"

Bai Rong's greatest fear was a Golden Core cultivator. Listening in on the affairs of an ordinary Purple Mansion expert wouldn't pose much of a threat to a Plain-Hearted Fox like him, but once a Golden Core was involved, even the powerful figure backing him might not be able to protect him.

"The fact that Uncle Heyun hasn't shown himself means there is no danger here." Dingjiao softly reassured them both. He put away the jade bottle in his palm, revealing a bright white stone pearl underneath.

The stone pearl was a milky white, inscribed with three faint yellow lines. It was shrouded in a soft glow, devoid of any spectacular radiance. Dingjiao explained, "This place is so deep that even a Purple Mansion cultivator can't probe its bottom. The further down you go, the thicker the malevolent qi becomes. An ordinary Purple Mansion expert coming here would only hear a single shout. That's why I made a special trip to retrieve this ancient spiritual artifact."

"This once belonged to the Jixian Immortal Dao. It's called the Yinqi's Earthen Word. It's been stored in my residence for a long time; it's rare that I have a use for it."

Hearing of its grand origins, Bai Rong couldn't help but steal a glance, his expression tinged with envy. "An ancient spiritual artifact of the Earth Virtue path is a true rarity," he said softly. "The Jixian Immortal Dao was supremely powerful. Only a dragon prince like Your Highness would have such a thing in his collection."

Dingjiao seemed slightly embarrassed. He lifted his chin, his twin dragon horns emitting a faint light, almost the only source of illumination in the entire abyss. "The Earth Virtue path is formidable," he replied, "but this item is too ancient. In that era, cultivators didn't forge artifacts with combat as the priority; mystical function came first. This thing is of little use in a fight."

Bai Rong looked somewhat puzzled, but Dingjiao didn't elaborate. He casually tossed the stone pearl, and it began to spin in mid-air. A murky yellow light immediately emerged from it. Li Zhouwei frowned slightly, but Dingjiao remained silent.

The murky yellow light flowed in a circle, sweeping across the stone wall like a shadow. Wherever it passed, the earth and stone trembled and rustled. Dingjiao's voice was low as he chanted an obscure and unintelligible mantra.

With a crackle, a mouth no bigger than a palm split open on the adjacent stone wall. It had distinct lips and teeth, and a thick, buzzing voice emerged from it.

The voice was hoarse, like the grinding of stones, deep and layered. It sounded ancient and hesitant, but offered no further reaction. Bai Rong watched thoughtfully and chuckled. "Jixian Immortals, after all."

Dingjiao waited a moment longer before giving up. He passed the stone pearl over with a smile. "Minghuang, this artifact can hear the speech of the earth and make stones speak on our behalf. But the Jixian Immortals were the leaders of the immortal dao, and this spiritual artifact has too much pride; it won't accept my demon power. You do it."

'How interesting.'

Li Zhouwei finally understood their reactions. He gently took the pearl and infused it with his dharma power. The pearl instantly brightened severalfold, becoming much more animated. The mouth on the stone wall called out eagerly, "Greetings, my lord!"

Li Zhouwei swept his spiritual sense over it and nodded. "Are you the spirit of this wall?"

The stone wall replied respectfully, "Replying to my lord... it is indeed this humble spirit, awaiting the celestial decree of your lordships."

"Good." Dingjiao nodded in satisfaction and gave his instructions. "Go down and take a look. Report back what you find... and remember, you are not to listen or look. Just speak as commanded. I fear a single glance or sound might shatter what little divine power you have, and I'd have to summon you again."

"Thank you, esteemed immortal."

The minor spirit within the stone wall expressed its thanks, and the mouth immediately slid down the wall. Li Zhouwei offered a word of praise, glancing at the Yinqi's Earthen Word in his hand. He noticed the stone pearl was simple and unadorned, not looking at all like an ancient spiritual artifact.

Meanwhile, Bai Rong's ears twitched. He formed a seal, preparing to cast a spell. On high alert, he began to chant in a low voice, each word like a soft sob, grating and sharp.

Soon, a purple radiance flew from his fine fur, flitting like sparrows and flowing around their ears. Li Zhouwei suddenly felt his hearing clear, and a cacophony of sound emerged, coming from a distance, rising and falling.

"Bound... too tightly, I beg... for some relief!"

Bai Rong's description had not been an exaggeration. The voice was heart-wrenching, a continuous howl of agony, as if the speaker were suffering the ultimate torture, wanting to scream his very heart out.

With everyone at their posts, Dingjiao finally focused his mind and spoke softly, "Who are you?"

All sound by Li Zhouwei's ears ceased abruptly. The mournful cry was finally cut off, replaced by a silence so profound it was unnerving.

A dozen breaths passed before a shriek that could shatter metal and stone erupted, shaking the entire abyss. The man's voice was as sharp as a ghost's wail. "Who are *you*? Where is Yao Chenlin? Where is Yao Chenlin?! I beg... for some relief! I beg... for some relief!"

The force of the cry made Bai Rong grunt. Li Zhouwei felt the Yinqi's Earthen Word in his hand suddenly grow heavy; the stone pearl, which had been steadily drawing his dharma power, abruptly severed its connection. Dingjiao's face went pale.

*Pop!*

A faint noise sounded by their ears. Li Zhouwei was only supplying the power; the artifact was still under Dingjiao's control. He saw Dingjiao frown and knew without needing to be told: the minor spirit must have been destroyed by the psychic shock.

Without a word, Dingjiao summoned another mouth from the opposite wall, gave it its instructions, and sent it down. His tone was somewhat grim. "There is no Great Void here. Not only does it take a great deal of dharma power to summon a mountain spirit each time, but I also have to instruct it all over again..."

Bai Rong was doing his best to regulate his breathing, his expression complicated. "He might be at the bottom of the abyss, an unknown distance from here, yet the moment Your Highness asked, he was able to instantly send his roar back up with his dharma power! In just a few breaths! That level of strength..."

Dingjiao had clearly thought of this as well, his brow deeply furrowed. Bai Rong pondered for a moment before continuing, "I'm afraid my master couldn't do that. Perhaps only my grand-matriarch could even try..."

When cultivators like Xiao Chuting attained the Purple Mansion Realm, they could instantly transmit their voices over thousands of miles, but that was by using the Great Void. Anyone who achieved divine abilities could do it; it wasn't particularly difficult. But there was no Great Void here. For this person to project his voice all the way up relying on raw dharma power alone was something else entirely.

The group waited for a while before Dingjiao spoke again. "Who might you be, sir?"

After a few breaths, the man's voice indeed sounded by their ears again. This time it was much calmer, his tone hoarse and powerful, yet laced with the sounds of gritted teeth and coughing blood.

"...I am Li Xunquan."

Bai Rong was stunned. Dingjiao looked up. Beside them, Li Zhouwei's eyes widened slightly. The voice struck his heart like a great bell.

'The former Crown Prince of Wei, Li Xunquan!'

The one bound at the bottom of this abyss was the former Crown Prince of Wei, Li Xunquan, whose head had hung over the city of Dianyang for nine years!

Li Zhouwei's eyes flew open, his golden pupils fixed on Bai Rong and Dingjiao. Both demons wore expressions of shock that did not seem feigned. An emotion flashed across his own face, followed by a torrent of questions.

'Is this the real Li Xunquan or an imposter…'

'If Li Xunquan was killed at Dianyang, why is he here... and who did this…'

'What is the dragon race's intention!'

The thoughts flashed through his mind like lightning. Dingjiao glanced at him and said in a low voice, "Li Xunquan? My name is Dongfang Dingjiao. My grandfather is Dongfang You... Who bound you here?"

The voice from below paused, trembling with the effort of enduring excruciating pain. It cried out hoarsely, "Uncle? The pain is unbearable... I beg you, Uncle, loosen them for me!"

Li Zhouwei listened in silence. Li Xunquan had clearly only heard half the sentence and mistaken him for Dongfang You. Dingjiao looked vexed. He asked several more questions, but no matter what he asked, the man only fixated on the loosening of his bonds.

After a full quarter of an hour, Dongfang Dingjiao tried again. "What is it that binds you? How long have you been here?"

Li Xunquan seemed to have reached the limit of his endurance. His voice became a sharp shriek that pierced their ears. "The Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope... Where is Yao Chenlin?! Loosen this rope for me!"

"Hmph..."

Dongfang Dingjiao grunted, his brow furrowed. The mountain spirit had evidently been destroyed again. An endless wail of agony rose from below. Li Zhouwei remained silent throughout, watching quietly.

The white flood dragon paused, then said softly, "My power is running low. Let's go up for now."

As he finished speaking, the spiritual artifact beneath their feet began to rise. Bai Rong withdrew his divine ability, and all the noise and cries of pain vanished from their ears. Li Zhouwei cast his gaze into the endless depths of the abyss.

Dingjiao seemed somewhat somber. "Minghuang," he said in a low voice, "I had only heard that there was something unusual here, that an elder was imprisoned underground. The clan never spoke of it, so I decided to take a look. I never imagined it would be him..."

Strictly speaking, Dongfang You and Emperor Gong of Wei were friends. Dingjiao's father, the Dragon King, would have to address Emperor Gong as 'uncle', which meant Dingjiao should, at the very least, call Li Xunquan 'uncle' as well. The relationship was only a generation or two removed, making them quite close—he fully qualified as an elder.

Though friendships often fade when people are gone, Dongfang Dingjiao had only brought up the connection to get closer to Li Zhouwei; it wasn't a tangible favor. But Li Xunquan was different... the former crown prince might have even had pleasant conversations with Dongfang You in the past.

Therefore, Dingjiao's mood was now very complicated. Though he had been mentally prepared, seeing this scene still stirred his emotions. The prince had rarely suffered any setbacks in his life, let alone been powerless while an elder was imprisoned deep underground. He said in a muffled voice, "His mind is already gone... He can only react to a few names. He must have been tortured for a very long time."

Bai Rong, having expended the most demon power, was a little listless. He murmured, "It has been fifteen hundred years since the fall of the Wei's Li dynasty. His head hung in Dianyang for nine years. He was probably captured and brought here right after. Fifteen hundred years of agony... no one could withstand that!"

Of the two demons, Bai Rong's words were pure sentiment, whereas Dingjiao felt a genuine, indignant sorrow. The dragon prince said coldly, "Although the Qi Emperor was cruel and vicious, the Jie clan had at least received Emperor Gong's favor. He only killed my uncle and his partisans, hanging his head in Dianyang. Even privately, he was unwilling or unable to kill my uncle. He would never torture him in a place like this. Besides, the Qi Kingdom was destroyed by the Tuoba family long ago…"

"The one who imprisoned him here must be a major immortal Dao power in the north today, one that was at odds with the Wei's Li family, and one that covets the Bright Yang!"

Bai Rong's heart pounded with fear as he listened. He screamed internally, 'This kid isn't stupid! By being so specific, you've practically spelled out the name of Mount Luoxia! Dingjiao, oh, Dingjiao…'

Bai Rong knew that the relationship between Mount Luoxia and the dragon race, and indeed the entire demon race, was far from good. His own Mount Dali had suffered its share of setbacks at their hands. But Mount Luoxia was protected by a Dao Embryo; it was not a lineage one could speak of so casually!

How could Li Zhouwei not understand? The state of Zhao was now merely a plaything for Buddhist cultivators. The major immortal Dao powers in the north could be counted on one hand; you could guess the name just by thinking about it. Although he filed the information away, he couldn't properly respond. He only asked in a grave tone, "Your Highness, the affairs of Wei, Qi, Liang, and Zhao are rarely recorded in the south and are difficult to discern... What Dao did the Qi Emperor cultivate?"

Li Zhouwei knew quite a bit by now. At his question, Dingjiao sighed. "The Qi Emperor, Shi Chang, cultivated 'Dawn Qi', which is complementary to 'Lesser Yang'. They have always been intrinsically linked. This Dao can transform Bright Yang into Lesser Yang... which fits the situation perfectly."

Bai Rong, hearing this, feared Dingjiao was about to mention Mount Luoxia again. He quickly interjected, "Isn't that right. The sun can be divided into Lesser Yang, which gives birth to Dawn Qi, and Dawn Qi can in turn transform Bright Yang into Lesser Yang. The Dao of mutual generation lies therein."

Li Zhouwei committed this to memory. Since his own cultivation was of the Bright Yang, he would have to be wary if he ever encountered a practitioner of Radiant Essence in the future. He then saw Dingjiao clasp his hands behind his back and say softly, "Thank you both. This matter can be considered to have a conclusion. Although it's not entirely satisfactory, I now have a clearer picture."

Dingjiao observed their reactions, knowing his earlier words had been understood. He didn't spell it out further, merely nodding slightly. The spiritual artifact beneath their feet flew faster and faster, transforming into a white shadow as it shot upwards. Dingjiao said softly, "However, the matter within this abyss is a secret, and not a glorious one. I must ask you both to keep this information confidential, for your own sakes as well."

"Of course."

Li Zhouwei and Bai Rong agreed. Dingjiao smiled. "Rest assured, there is no Great Void here, and I chose a special day to come. Cultivators within the seas cannot divine the affairs of my dragon race today. Besides, those lineages are arrogant and usually ignore matters within or outside the seas, let alone try to scry our movements."

The meaning behind his words was now even clearer: he was telling them not to worry. Bai Rong smiled and nodded, while Li Zhouwei began to ponder his words.

'A special day…'

Li Zhouwei paused for a moment, then immediately understood. A quick mental calculation brought a flash of admiration.

'It's the Dragon Monarch's birthday!'

When Li Zhouwei and the others had gone to Thunder Island, they had happened to hear Miao Ye and his men mention the Dragon Monarch's birthday. At the time, Li Zhouwei had asked Bai Rong, who said it was still about half a month away.

'And with all the time we've spent, it's been exactly twelve days. The time we spent at the bottom of the abyss just now was precisely the second day of the second month of the season!'

He glanced at Dingjiao. Bai Rong was also silent. Li Zhouwei understood completely.

'The fox clan of Mount Li also knew this was the most suitable day... That's why Bai Rong was in such a hurry. The travel time of the Azurewater Scaled-Beast was calculated in advance. It seemed like Dingjiao came and went as he pleased, but that couldn't be further from the truth…'
