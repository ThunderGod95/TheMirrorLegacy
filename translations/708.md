# Chapter 708: The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate

With the decision made, Li Jiangxia reported to Li Zhouwei, took the offered token, and departed, his spirits high as he went to assemble his forces for the eastern shore. Li Zhouwei raised a hand and turned to his other son.

“Jianglong,” he began, “the Profound Peak Gate has requested a marriage alliance. We must send a young woman and betroth one of the brothers. Excluding the youngest, Jiangnian, who do you think is suitable?”

Only then did Li Jianglong bow formally, his tone respectful. “Father, in my opinion, this alliance is merely a gesture of goodwill. The future is uncertain. We should choose one of the younger brothers and postpone the wedding. This will give us room to maneuver if circumstances change, avoiding any future difficulties.”

“As for which daughter to send,” he added, “that will depend on the proposal the Profound Peak Gate brings.”

“This is meant to reassure them,” Li Zhouwei countered. “It cannot be a perfunctory gesture. Your suggestion lacks sincerity.”

Li Jianglong bowed again. “Then I am willing to go to the Profound Peak Gate to cultivate as a direct descendant. This will put their minds at ease. As for the marriage, I implore you to arrange it for one of my younger brothers. I fear my own involvement could lead to disaster!”

Li Jianglong’s reasoning was sound. Once Changxi died, the fate of the Profound Peak Gate was unknown. In the worst-case scenario, if the gate was destroyed, having an adult heir like Jianglong or Jiangxia married to one of their direct descendants would only burden their own children with a legacy of vengeance.

In contrast, Li Jiangliang was still a child. A wedding would be at least a decade away. By then, Changxi would be long gone, and the situation at the Profound Peak Gate would be clear, preventing the Li family from becoming too deeply entangled.

His offer to go there himself, however, was unexpected. Li Zhouwei looked up at his son, his voice deep. “I had planned to give you authority over the dense forest and the one hundred and eighteen families once the eastern shore was settled, and send your brother in your stead. You wish to go to the Profound Peak Gate instead? Are you certain?”

All of his sons were capable leaders. As descendants of the Bright Yang lineage, they were ambitious and had already formed their own factions—a stark contrast to the deferential humility of previous generations. Li Zhouwei knew that even young Li Jiangliang harbored great aspirations. In this new, vibrant era of the clan, distancing oneself from the center of power was a major disadvantage. Li Jianglong's proposal was truly surprising.

Li Zhouwei asked again. Seeing his son bow low, he heard him say, “I have considered it carefully. I believe this journey will greatly benefit Moongaze Lake. I ask for your permission, Father.”

“Very well.” Li Zhouwei gave him no chance to equivocate, nodding immediately. “Go and choose two companions for your studies. I will speak with their Daoist Master myself. When you arrive at the Profound Peak Gate, be humble and cautious. Do not disgrace our family’s name.”

“You have my word, Father!”

Li Jianglong expressed his thanks and withdrew. Li Quewan, who had been listening quietly in her long, cloud-silk dress, found her opinion of him rising. She did not expect Li Zhouwei to turn to her next.

“Wan’er, regarding the eastern shore, who do you think should be sent to govern it?”

“This junior wouldn’t dare overstep… It would be a breach of protocol.”

“Speak freely,” Li Zhouwei insisted.

Li Quewan had no choice but to bow. “Clan Head, the elders are needed to guard the northern shore and cannot be easily moved. Now that Grand-uncle Chenghuai has taken over Mount Qingdu, Uncle Zhouluo is available. However, his cultivation is at a critical stage, and I worry this might hinder him.”

“Uncle Zhouming also reached Qi Refinement a few days ago,” she continued, “and there is also Aunt Xinghan. Both could contribute.”

She couldn’t help but acknowledge a harsh truth: the conflict between the north and south had devastated the Chengmíng and Zhouxing generations. With Li Chenghuai, Li Minggong, and others already assigned crucial roles, the only remaining member of the Zhouxing generation with notable cultivation was Li Zhouluo. After him was Li Xinghan of the First Branch, a quiet cultivator who was rarely seen outside of her seclusion.

As for Li Zhouming, though he was a direct grandson of the clan’s Daoist Master, his talent was lackluster. He was over thirty and had only managed to break through with the aid of a talisman pill, making him less accomplished than even the brothers Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang.

Li Zhouwei sighed inwardly. The Zhouxing generation’s talent was on par with that of an ordinary noble house, but lacked any truly outstanding figures. They had come of age during the tumultuous north-south conflict, a time of instability that not only deprived them of practical experience but also left many of them orphaned, with nothing but a storage pouch to inherit.

The vassal families had fared no better and had yet to recover their strength. The An clan was fortunate to have produced a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and the Chen clan had Chen Yang, with Chen Donghe still at the Jade Court. But the other prominent families of Lijing, despite their outward splendor, were suffering from a decline in talent, their prestige slowly fading.

“Uncle Chenghuai is now at Mount Qingdu, so it would be inappropriate for Zhouluo to enter the dense forest… For now, send one of the old masters to oversee things. Have Zhouming and Xinghan accompany them to learn.”

Having issued his orders, he finally set down his brush. “I will be traveling to Jiangbei in a few days,” he said softly. “I am leaving Jiangqian in charge of clan affairs. I want you to assist him. With Uncle Chenghuai here, there shouldn’t be any trouble.”

Li Quewan bowed her head in assent. Li Zhouwei then took the Mountain Ghost Talisman from his sleeve and placed it in her hand.

“This is a Mountain Ghost Talisman. It holds the power of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Study it. It can also serve to protect you.”

**The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate.**

The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate was located in Jingchuan Prefecture, a region of rolling hills and lush vegetation. The sect’s mountain, Yuchuan Sword Peak, rose from the earth like a greatsword piercing the heavens. From its summit, the Eastern Sea, less than two hundred miles away, stretched out in a vast, breathtaking panorama.

Atop the sharp, sword-like main peak grew a Profound Horn Treasured Tassel Pine. Unlike ordinary pines that grow straight and tall, this one spread out like a magnificent canopy. Its needles, clustered like tassels of emerald jade, marked it as a Purple Mansion spirit pine of the Horn Wood path, famed throughout Jiangnan.

The Sword Gate was a place of quiet cultivation. Pavilions were scattered across the peak, yet few people were about. Only one person came to greet Li Ximing—Cheng Jinzhu, who had attended the Dharma Assembly. With a sword on his back, he led Li Ximing up the mountain. A southeast wind rustled through the pine needles, scattering iridescent light.

The Profound Light in the center of Li Ximing’s brow stirred. He sensed something unusual about the wind, a verdant, life-giving quality that resonated with the Dao of Horn Wood.

“A fine Horn Wood spring breeze,” he remarked.

His Profound Light divine ability could detect anomalies, and he had noticed it at a glance.

“The Daoist Master’s perception is truly profound,” Cheng Jinzhu said quickly. “This is indeed of the Horn Wood path. We call it the Treasured Tassel Spring Breeze. Whenever the wind blows from the southeast and passes through the branches of our Ancestor Tree, it transforms, gaining the power to nourish the people and the land.”

He elaborated, “The wind travels from the southeast to the northwest until it reaches Lake Xian. There, it merges with the sea breeze, turns west, and follows the river, bringing life to Jiangnan.”

‘So that’s it,’ Li Ximing thought with a quiet sigh. ‘No matter how many demonic or bloody calamities the Azure Pond Sect suffers, its population always recovers quickly. This Purple Mansion spirit tree must be a major reason why!’

Just as the thought crossed his mind, a figure materialized beneath the tree. He was a middle-aged man in a Daoist robe, his hair and beard streaked with white. He held a sword in his arms and wore a faint, surprised smile.

“I am Lingmei,” he said. “Greetings, Zhaojing.”

“Greetings, Senior!” Li Ximing returned the bow. The cultivators of the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate were renowned for their combat prowess, and few were willing to offend them. He was naturally polite.

Daoist Master Lingmei approached and made another introduction. “And this is Senior Tianjiao.”

Li Ximing then understood he was referring to the Profound Horn Treasured Tassel Pine before him. He quickly offered a respectful bow. “This junior pays his respects.”

Li Ximing had three spirit trees of his own: a Snake-Dragon Fruit Tree and a Wanling Flower Tree, neither of which had gained sentience, and a Spirit Persimmon Tree from the Quanwu Mountains. Though the persimmon’s origins were far humbler than the other two, it had developed a nascent consciousness.

The Profound Horn Treasured Tassel Pine, however, gave no response.

“The old senior sleeps often,” Lingmei explained. “He hasn’t stirred in nearly fifty years. Please do not take offense.”

Li Ximing nodded and followed him forward. Daoist Master Lingmei gestured for him to sit. “This senior has quite a history,” he said with a smile. “When True Monarch Taiyu cultivated on this mountain, the golden qi he radiated was so intense that it left the land barren for hundreds of miles. He had to plant this tree to shield the area. Later, when the founder of our sect, the Myriad Radiance Sword Cheng Liuxing, became the True Monarch’s disciple, he had to address this tree as Martial Uncle…”

“Planted by a True Monarch!”

Li Ximing was stunned. True Monarch Taiyu was a legendary figure. The power of this ancient tree had to be supreme among Purple Mansion cultivators. As long as it stood here, who would dare attack the Sword Gate?

A clear note of pride entered Lingmei’s voice. “Our swords may cleave the sky and our golden qi may be overwhelming, but we have never brought harm to the people of Jingchuan Prefecture, all thanks to this old senior!”

He led Li Ximing to a table beneath the tree, its surface covered in jade-like pine needles. With a sweep of his sleeve, Lingmei cleared a space and poured tea. “I must say, your visit is quite a surprise, Zhaojing!”

Li Ximing merely smiled and replied courteously, “My ancestors were renowned as sword immortals, their names recorded in Chenghua Hall’s *Myriad Radiance Sword Tome*. Now that I have reached the Purple Mansion Realm, it is only right that I come to pay my respects. Furthermore, my family has practiced swordsmanship for generations, sharing a spiritual lineage and a righteous bond with the Sword Gate. How could I not visit?”

“Indeed.” Lingmei nodded, looking pleasantly surprised. His face was squarish and honest, but his eyes shone with approval. “Our founder once said that anyone whose name is recorded in the *Sword Tome* is an honored guest of our gate. In matters of life and death, they may call upon us for aid.”

A pained look crossed his face. “Though many years have passed and our founder is long gone, our gate still considers the world’s sword immortals our friends. It is a great regret that by the time we learned of your ancestor’s plight… he had already been slain!”

Li Ximing sighed. “The affairs of the world are unpredictable…”

Lingmei did not dwell on the past. He changed the subject, his voice softening. “Fate works in strange ways. You and I, Zhaojing, share the same family name.”

“Oh?” Li Ximing was taken aback. “Is the Daoist Master not named Cheng?”

Lingmei laughed heartily. “My birth name is Li Mei.”

He paused, observing Li Ximing’s expression, and stroked his beard. “In the path of cultivation, when one person achieves the Dao, their entire lineage benefits. The descendants of cultivators are born with exceptional talent that mortals cannot match. Thus, most sects and clans are built upon bloodlines.”

“But the talent for the sword is different,” he continued. “The son of a farmer might draw a treasured sword of immense power, while the child of a Purple Mansion cultivator might not be able to wield a simple three-foot blade. Our Sword Gate honors swordsmanship above all, so it is common to see Qi Refinement cultivators as Peak Lords and Embryonic Breathing cultivators as Guest Elders.”

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing.

Lingmei went on, “Our sect follows the righteous path, and our core disciples come from many families. The Cheng clan are the descendants of our founder, so they are naturally respected and often represent us, holding the position of Sect Master.”

“A truly righteous path!” Li Ximing praised, finding it hard to believe.

Lingmei, however, looked weary. “Perhaps not… It has its own flaws, hardships only we can understand, though the other sects can see it plainly enough… As I was just explaining to you.”

“Our gate honors those with exceptional swordsmanship and virtue. But how many cultivators are there to begin with? To find someone who excels at both, and also possesses supreme talent for cultivation… you might not see one in a century!”

“As a result, the truly talented often lack resources, while the mediocre squander countless treasures just to take a single step forward. To gain resources, one must first practice the sword, then go out into the world to help the common people and demonstrate virtue. But with the exception of a few geniuses, swordsmanship deepens with age. By the time they have perfected their art, they have missed their window for a breakthrough. This has thrown the entire sect into chaos. There have even been cases of Embryonic Breathing elders enjoying the resources of a direct disciple for a hundred years, only to die upon breaking through to Qi Refinement…”

“That…” Li Ximing frowned at the thought.

Lingmei sighed. “I lived through that era. After I reached the Purple Mansion Realm and took charge, I used the founder’s grace as a pretext to strongly promote the Cheng clan and change the situation. I enacted many reforms and ignored countless objections. That is how we came to see the rise of talents like Cheng Mianfu, Cheng Gao, and Gu Pang…”

“Even so, to this day, most of our direct disciples are weak in cultivation, skilled only in swordplay… or in some cases, possessing only virtue. The mess left behind, the countless bad debts from those who consumed resources without contributing… it’s a reckoning that can no longer be calculated!”

Hearing this, Li Ximing finally understood why the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate—a lineage of sword immortals and successors to a Golden Core cultivator—was unable to contend with Crimson Reef Island and the Chunyi Dao Gate, leaving them floundering in the Eastern Sea. His heart sank.

“The righteous path is difficult,” he said. “It is fortunate you appeared to set things right.”

“It’s too soon to say,” Lingmei replied, shaking his head. “I have not yet changed the fundamental law of selecting disciples based on virtue. There are already undercurrents of resentment against me within the sect. If I were to touch that core principle, I fear they would all go to Chenghua Hall to prostrate themselves before Senior Tianjiao and demand that the *Sword Tome* be used to execute me as a heretic. How history will judge me is anyone’s guess.”

Daoist Master Lingmei was entirely different from Si Boxiu or Xiao Chuting. Perhaps because the Li family also followed a righteous path and was a clan of sword immortals, his attitude was far more earnest. His cultivation of both the sword and virtue gave his words a steady, sincere weight.

“In any case, your visit at this time has truly helped me. There are many stubborn elders in the sect who hold the Li family in high regard… especially after the Celestial Moon Sword sacrificed themself to slay the Wrathful Manifestation, an act that has been recorded in Chenghua Hall and earned great renown. For this, I thank you, Zhaojing!”

With that, the mighty mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator rose from his seat to offer a formal bow.

Startled, Li Ximing shot to his feet to avoid it.

“However,” Daoist Master Lingmei said humbly, “my family has a rule. We do not participate in the struggles between sects and clans, nor in the schemes of Purple Mansion cultivators. We aided the Green Pine Temple because they sought to retrieve an artifact of their founder, a justifiable cause. Otherwise, our gate would not have acted… If you have other intentions, Zhaojing, I am afraid you will be disappointed!”

No one who reached the Purple Mansion Realm was a fool. Lingmei’s words were sincere, but he was well aware of the unspoken currents in any meeting between cultivators of their level. His statement drew a clear line. His gratitude might be genuine, but it also served as a polite refusal that Li Ximing could not take offense to.

The thanks had been solemn, but the boundary had been drawn with unimpeachable righteousness. What could Li Ximing possibly say? He had come to the Sword Gate precisely to avoid choosing between the Golden Feather Sect and the Hengzhu Immortal Dao, and he had never expected them to forge an alliance with his family.

He replied respectfully, “Senior, you misunderstand. I have come this time only to pay homage to the sword intent of my ancestors. I have no other motive. I only ask to be allowed to see the true face of the *Myriad Radiance Sword Tome*.”
