# Chapter 448: Serpent Dragon's Water Wisdom

"Can my family benefit from this?" Li Xuanxuan asked, his heart pounding with anticipation. He was wary of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' schemes but also intrigued by the potential gains.

"The Dongli Sect was once a prominent immortal sect. Putting aside the treasures inside the grotto heaven, even the spirit water, spirit fire, and spiritual qi outside it are all exceedingly rare," he remarked softly.

"Could we send a few guest or external cultivators to the area around the cave to compete with the rogue cultivators? If we manage to obtain one or two of the treasures, it would greatly benefit our family's future development!"

Li Qinghong, listening to his proposal, raised an eyebrow.

"It's difficult to say. If you really want to involve our family, whether you send guest or external cultivators, it's essentially the same as sending our direct descendants," she replied.

She continued, "Moreover, these guest or external cultivators who acquire some spirit water or spirit fire won't simply hand it over. They'd more likely escape with it..."

Li Xuanxuan was at a loss for words until Li Qinghong added, "Of course, we shouldn't risk our family members' lives. Even though Chu Yi has entered the grotto heaven, who can guarantee the rest could leave safely after harvesting the resources outside? They might be dead upon reaching Mount Dongli... The rogue cultivators don't have much to lose; they're simply looking for a chance. But...our family is a different story."

After a few moments of thought, Li Qinghong spoke softly, "While our family can't afford to risk entering Mount Dongli, there are plenty who are willing to take the risk. If hawks can't risk it, perhaps we can benefit from the sparrows."

She pulled out a map from her storage pouch and pointed to Mount Dongli.

"Mount Dongli is located on the border of Yufu, surrounded by large prefectures to the northwest. Fleeing there would be unwise. If the rogue cultivators find the treasure and leave the mountain, they will likely head east, not northwest.

"East is the best direction to flee, toward the loosely controlled territory of the Purple Smoke Gate. Given that the Purple Smoke Gate is weak and preoccupied with dividing the treasure in the grotto heaven, their territory is sparsely guarded due to a shortage of manpower..."

Li Qinghong concluded confidently, "If I were a rogue cultivator with the treasure, I would definitely flee east, leave the Purple Smoke territory, and travel along the edge of Shanji Prefecture. I'd hide my identity in the Eastern Sea and establish a Dao lineage..."

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard and fell silent for a moment before whispering, "Are you suggesting we ambush them in the territory of the Purple Smoke Gate?"

"No," Li Qinghong replied with an excited smile, "It's better to position ourselves at the mouth of the river. The Purple Smoke Gate is too close to Mount Dongli, it's too dangerous there. I'll use the mirror to scout the river. With its ability to see thousands of miles away, no Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator will be able to catch me, and no Qi Cultivator will be able to defeat me."

"Right now, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' attention is focused on Mount Dongli. The entrance to the sea is winding and difficult under the rule of the Yue Cultivating Sect. We can wait nearby. If we're lucky, we'll profit. If not, it's no great lossâ€”just a matter of waiting for a few days."

The plan seemed reasonable to Li Xuanxuan, but his advanced age and frailty had drained his courage, worn thin by past trials. He tried to speak but remained silent.

Understanding his hesitation, Li Qinghong pursed her lips and refrained from speaking further.

Uncle Xuanxuan is quite old and has faced death several times. He must be weary and likely has little desire for further risks...

Li Qinghong thought for a moment before Li Xuanxuan finally spoke.

"Jiao'er is in seclusion, and his fate is uncertain. If something were to happen, it could spell disaster for the family. Moreover, it may not be wise to use our family's resources for such a distant venture."

"Alright, I will heed your advice," Li Qinghong replied, smiling with disappointment.

"But there's no rush. I've heard that the grotto heaven hasn't been opened yet. Many are still waiting..." she added while cupping her fist. Just as she was about to withdraw, the calm surface of the courtyard's clear water suddenly rippled. A wind swept in, dispersing the dark clouds overhead.

Rumble!

A muffled sound resonated from the clear sky, and the sky darkened abruptly. The water in the courtyard leaped up from the ground, disappearing into the cracks and fissures.

"Brother! Big Brother has made a breakthrough!"

Li Qinghong was momentarily stunned as the cave's stone door swung open with a gust of strong wind, stirring up a grayish-green water mist. Li Xuanxuan stood up with excitement and moved forward a few steps.

Indeed, a young man in black emerged from the gray mist, carrying a sword on his back. He stepped forward with a beaming smile, his face radiant with joy.

"I have formed the Boundless Ocean!"

Li Yuanjiao's voice was unusually cheerful. The emotions he had suppressed for years finally surfaced, and he felt a surge of confidence this time.

Looking at his father and younger cousin in the courtyard, he smiled and announced, "I have established the immortal foundation and am now a cultivator in the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

Li Xuanxuan laughed heartily. He stepped forward and said with genuine happiness, "Of course, I knew it was only a matter of time before Jiao'er established his foundation! With this new strength, there are many things we can now attempt that we previously avoided!"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head slightly, his face showing a hint of relief. Reflecting on the trials he had faced during his seclusion, a cold sweat broke out on his back. He replied, "Father, you speak lightly, but it wasn't easy. I narrowly escaped death... If not for my good fortune and youth, I might not have survived this life-or-death ordeal."

Li Xuanxuan had seen several elders establish their foundation relatively easily and assumed that Li Yuanjiao's success was assured. He had not expected his son to look as though he had survived a great trial.

He responded, puzzled, "How could it be so difficult? If even you faced such challenges, how many in the family could hope to establish their foundation?"

"Not many," Li Yuanjiao replied as he continued, "Father, never underestimate the difficulty of establishing a foundation... Just look at how many from the Fei and Yu families died trying to achieve it."

Li Qinghong, who had been listening, appeared unfazed. She smiled at her brother and asked, "How does it feel, Brother? How different are you from my grandfather back then?"

Li Yuanjiao's smile faded, and he became serious.

"That's exactly what I'm wondering..."

With that, he slowly extended his hand. His black robe fluttered gently in the wind as the immortal foundation within him began to resonate and the sound of a rushing waterfall filled the air.

Splash!

The gray spring water surged from between the floor tiles and rock crevices. It spiraled around the feet of the three, wrapping around Li Yuanjiao's robe. The water swiftly transformed into a serpent dragon that bared its fangs and claws, its scales clearly defined as it coiled beside him.

Li Yuanjiao murmured, "The immortal foundation I formed doesn't possess the ability to condense talisman water, but I've acquired another ability known as Serpent Dragon's Water Wisdom...

He continued, his expression unusual, "This ability allows me to communicate with water beasts, befriend underwater monsters, control clouds, and rain, and activate water veins..."

Li Qinghong was momentarily stunned as a word suddenly popped into her mind. She exclaimed suddenly, "Jing Dragon King?!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded approvingly and replied in a deep voice, "I agree. Jing Dragon King seems to fit better than Boundless Ocean. However, everyone knows that this is just another name for this immortal foundation... Jing Dragon King is the ancient name for Boundless Ocean..."

He then furrowed his brow and voiced his main concern.

"I've also compared it with Grand Uncle's description from back then. After condensing Boundless Ocean, I don't feel the improvements he had described. The recovery speed of my true essence and the qi is only half of what my granduncle's was..."

Li Tongya's impressive suppression power wasn't solely due to the Law of Celestial Moon but also his extraordinary recovery speed of his true essence.

Even the fact that he could take Huashang Fruit, the treasured panacea

without dying, was due to the profound power of Boundless Ocean...

With his different ability and effect compared to Li Tongya, Li Yuanjiao's excitement waned. After a moment of contemplation, he sighed.

"Perhaps this is Jing Dragon King after all... It is different from the Boundless Ocean."

"Could it be due to the pill..?" Li Qinghong asked softly, and the three fell into silence.

Seeing Li Yuanjiao emerge from his seclusion, Li Qinghong felt renewed confidence in her plan. She outlined the changes within the family, shared the previous plan with a smile, and then asked, "What do you think, Brother?"

Li Yuanjiao nodded and responded softly, "The plan is feasible, but divine abilities are mysteriously strange... How can we determine if one's action is under the influence of one or if it comes from the heart?"

Li Qinghong hesitated for a moment before answering with uncertainty.

"With the talisman seed we have... we should not be affected..."

"Not necessarily," Li Yuanjiao countered thoughtfully.

"In my opinion, the talisman seed can resist divine ability but only if it's triggered through divine ability itself. If it's triggered by fate, it might be unstoppable. If this weren't the case, why did Granduncle always say that he was led by a divine ability? Why did Uncle Xuanling inexplicably wish to go to Mount Luoxia? It must be related to fate!"

Li Yuanjiao, having broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, now saw many things with a new perspective. Mysteries that had eluded him before became clear now in his mind.

Li Qinghong frowned and asked, "If fate controls everything, how can anyone dare to act in this world?"

"I know right... If the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators truly wielded such formidable divine abilities, the Xiao Family wouldn't have been able to exist. My family has suffered twice at their hands, making it hard not to be apprehensive."

Li Qinghong glanced at both men and gritted her teeth.

"Anyone who can't become a Purple Mansion Realm is destined to be an ant in the grand scheme of things!"

Li Xuanxuan sighed, his face growing more despondent with age. Li Yuanjiao, having just achieved Foundation Establishment Realm and freed from long-held frustrations, gently touched the sword at his waist and reassured, "Don't let fear overwhelm you."

Li Qinghong turned to him, and Li Yuanjiao added, "Offer a sacrifice to the mirror to clear your mind. If it confirms our path, then proceed."

Li Xuanxuan, though listening, struggled with his anxiety. His hands trembled, haunted by memories of the market's flames and devil qi.

He sighed heavily.

The catastrophe in the market had drained him physically and mentally. He had been trembling with fear for years, often dreaming of Li Tongya and Li Mutian, waking up with a racing heart from his meditation.

After watching the two juniors perform the ritual and receive guidance from the mirror, Li Xuanxuan sat down wearily and made a decision.

"Qinghong will stay behind. Jiao'er, you'll go alone."

â€”â€”â€”â€”

Mount Dongli, located in the north of Yue State, was a rare mountain covered predominantly with maple trees. At this time of year, streams of lights interspersed with the mountain's red foliage, creating a picturesque scene.

The mountain was sparsely populated with demonic creatures. A hundred years ago, the Azure Pond Sect surrounded it, and when the Dongli Sect was destroyed, many forbidden formations were left behind. It became a favored spot for the three sects and seven gates to train their disciples, with even peak master-level figures occasionally searching for spirit items.

Prior to the grotto heaven's fall, numerous rogue and devil cultivators had already begun roaming the area. Streams of light were periodically seen entering the mountain to explore the forbidden formations.

The sky above Mount Dongli was clear and cloudless. A figure descended from the great void, clad in light golden armor and holding a large halberd, with a jade seal hanging from his waist.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator hovered in the air for a moment before another figure appeared. This person wore a golden robe, and though the robe was loose, it was clear that the figure was a woman. She was veiled, with white gauze obscuring her face.

The Purple Mansion Realm female cultivator called out, "Tiaoxiao."

Yuan Su turned around and glanced at her calmly before saying, "Ah, Master Qiushui. Congratulations on your mastery of the divine ability and breakthrough to the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm."

The female cultivator remained silent.

The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stood quietly, their gazes fixed on the grotto heaven floating in the great void.

Yuan Su spoke softly, "Senior Dongli has been hiding it for so many years, but it still came to light in the end... After all, it is Mount Luoxia. Among the visible Daoist sects, Luoxia is the only leader..."

The Purple Mansion female cultivator listened in silence and succinctly added, "The local Daoist sects."

The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators conversed casually as the Azure Pond Sect's Dawn Cloudliner broke through the heavy clouds and slowly descended onto Mount Dongli, casting shimmering light all around it.

Li Xizhi stood on the large vessel, watching the cultivators below. He murmured, "Another bloody storm has passed... I wonder how many cultivators have fallen to the devil plague. Given the current state of affairs, how many are left in Yue State?"

Yang Xiao'er, who was standing beside him, smiled and replied, "Brother Zhi, you may not know this, but for the three sects and seven gates, rogue cultivators are plentiful. The Eastern Sea is vast, and as long as the coast's guardians relax even slightly, hundreds of Eastern Sea cultivators, lured by Yue State's wealth, will rush in as rogue cultivators."

Yang Xiao'er glanced at those around them and transmitted with her divine sense, "Once cultivators in Yue State obtain the treasure and leave, without suppression from the three sects and seven gates in the Eastern Sea, it's natural for them to establish their own sects. The Eastern Sea cultivators are used to being impoverished and will be eager to come in. After all, not every place could grow Spirit Paddies..."

Li Xizhi nodded and responded softly, "I've heard that Changxiao Gate was relocated here only in the past two hundred years. The seven gates can be moved or dispersed, but never the three sects."

Yang Xiao'er seemed to suddenly recall something and asked in confusion, "But... Brother Zhi's ancestor... is Li Mutian, right? It is said he followed my ancestor to conquer Mount Yue..."

The alarm in Li Xizhi's heart blared. However, he remained calm and replied nonchalantly, "That's correct."
