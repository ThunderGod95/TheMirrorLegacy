# Chapter 828: The Manifestation of Earth Virtue

The East A-Wang Sea.

Within the deep, dark veins of the earth, only the faint, flickering glow of flames could be seen. A massive, man-high alchemy cauldron stood upon the primary earth-vein, its surface covered in complex patterns. Intricate carvings of ocean waves and fierce beasts adorned its body, and it rested solidly on three ancient, unadorned legs.

The spirit fire blazed. A ring of bright, surging flames encircled the jet-black cauldron, while a brilliant white inferno leaped and danced beneath it.

Li Ximing had been refining this pill for nearly two years. Though he was confident in the completeness of his alchemical theory, this was his first time attempting to form a pill using the Heavenly Heart Oneness technique. The path had been fraught with peril, but thanks to his exceptionally solid foundation, he had overcome each obstacle one by one.

‘The power of the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was unexpectedly potent and a great help,’ he mused. ‘But the sheer dominance of the Heavenly Heart Oneness technique was just as formidable. Without both, this pill would have been impossible to refine.’

‘Everything is going well, with one small exception… this cauldron can’t take much more.’

The River-Heart Cauldron before him was an ancestral heirloom, acquired by his ancestors during the market place catastrophe. It was merely a Qi Refining grade tool. It only survived to this day because it was an ancient artifact forged from incredibly sturdy materials.

But no matter how sturdy, it couldn't withstand the combined power of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator’s divine abilities and True Fire. The intensity was enough to melt the cauldron into a liquid state; it was only holding its shape thanks to the protection of his power.

‘After this batch, this cauldron will be completely unusable.’

The pill’s refinement was now approaching the final nurturing stage, and he could finally relax his focus. Li Ximing formed a hand seal and cast a spell. The divine ability enveloping the cauldron flashed, and he rose to his feet. Pressing two fingers to his lips, he spat out a speck of purple light.

This spark of Bright Yang flame, infused with his divine ability, pulsed with spiritual energy. It dove under the cauldron and merged into the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire. Li Ximing then chanted:

"Three-Garrison True Fire, nurture this precious pill. With utmost care and focus, await the dawning of its light."

With that, he withdrew his consciousness completely, leaving only his divine ability to shield the cauldron. The spirit fire obediently took over the task of nurturing the pill.

The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire had, after all, been praised even by the Daoist Master Yuandao, Dantai Lingtong, as an exceptional alchemical flame. It had been an immense help during the refinement process, and its own spiritual nature was gentle and not overly destructive, making it perfectly suited for this kind of nurturing work.

"Hah…"

A wave of relief washed over him. He had spent nearly two years in a state of absolute concentration, blending spiritual materials with a alchemy art he had never used before. Even for a cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm, the strain was considerable, and he couldn't help but let out a long, heavy sigh.

He took out a few spirit-nourishing pills and consumed them, nurturing his divine abilitys. Thirty-six days passed. A faint flicker appeared between his brows, and a sudden premonition struck him. He opened his eyes.

‘Tinglan of the Purple Smoke Gate has found me.’

Before entering seclusion in the East A-Wang Sea, he had left a jade pendant with Houfu, imbued with a wisp of his divine ability. They had agreed on a meeting point at the border of the two seas. Now, his Profound Light sensed that it had been crushed.

During the Foundation Establishment Realm, items like this spirit jade needed to be constantly nurtured to maintain a long-distance connection, and they would often lose their efficacy after a few years. Now that he had achieved his own divine abilitys, a single touch was enough to maintain the connection for over a decade. It was far more convenient.

He enveloped the area with a formation, reinforced it with a warning art, and then tore open the Great Void to traverse space. From within the Great Void, he first observed the meeting point. Sure enough, a purple cloud carriage was parked at the border of the two seas, golden ribbons fluttering in the wind. It was unmistakably a Daoist Master from the Purple Smoke Gate.

He didn't approach rashly. Only after confirming there was no ambush did he transform into a ray of Profound Light and descend, materializing before the carriage.

A young woman stood before the vehicle, her features pure and charming. The Profound Light revealed her to be a rabbit Demon beast in human form. She bowed repeatedly upon seeing Li Ximing. Before he had a chance to speak, the carriage curtain was whisked aside. Tinglan, still dressed in her autumn-yellow satin robe, emerged with a slightly embarrassed expression.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing had barely survived his encounter with Changxiao, and his losses were surely not small. The incident had stemmed from an arrangement made by Purple Smoke, and though it was only a catalyst, Tinglan felt responsible. She offered a slight bow.

"It's been too long… The matter at Profound Peak has concluded. I'm so glad you're safe and sound, Daoist Friend. Otherwise… I truly wouldn't have known how to face you…"

Li Ximing didn't blame her much. The fault lay with his own lack of caution; the Purple Smoke Gate could never have predicted such an outcome. Furthermore, now that he was gradually learning of the domineering origins of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, he knew he was in no position to blame them. He replied, "Changxiao's attack was unexpected. Your gate is not at fault."

Unwilling to attract attention here, and still concerned about the unfinished pill in the earth-vein, he continued, "The treasure medicines in my cauldron are not yet finished. I must ask Daoist Friend Tinglan to rest at my humble abode for a while."

Tinglan nodded in agreement. The purple cloud carriage immediately flew toward the sea, descending all the way to the seabed of rolling white sand. Tinglan dismissed the carriage and instructed her attendant, "Wait for me here."

The spirit beast acknowledged the command. Li Ximing activated his Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger technique, and a shroud of earthy yellow light enveloped him and Tinglan, carrying them deep into the earth-veins. Tinglan’s eyes scanned their surroundings.

"The Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains certainly has its merits. Earth-burrowing is no small feat, yet this Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger dharma treasure allows you to travel through earth-veins as if you were an Earth Virtue cultivator. It speaks to the excellence of your lineage."

Hearing the full name of Profound Peak's Dao lineage for the first time, Li Ximing remarked with curiosity, "A Comprehending Profoundity lineage… no wonder they are so close to the Xuanmiao Temple."

Tinglan chuckled. "It can't be called a Comprehending Profoundity lineage. Each of those lineages is distinct and meticulously recorded. The Encompassing Profoundity category is a bit looser, but Comprehending Profoundity is the strictest. Daoist Friend Sumian at least possesses an ancestral portrait; Profound Peak has nothing of the sort."

As they descended, Li Ximing recalled the shady Qi-Stone Demon Embryo that Changxi had given to Sumian, but he remained noncommittal. Tinglan sighed. "An island belonging to my Purple Smoke Gate in the Vermillion Sea has run into trouble. We've been investigating for some time, but it's become quite vexing."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing prompted her. A suspicious look crossed Tinglan's face. "At first, we thought it was a shift in the earth-veins, a problem with the volcanic activity on the seafloor. But after several sweeps with another Daoist Friend, we found traces of an Earth Virtue divine ability. We asked Zhu Gong to take a look, and she suspects a cultivator broke through to a new realm there."

Li Ximing frowned. "The number of Earth Virtue cultivators seems to be growing these days…"

In truth, most demonic cultivators could be considered Earth Virtue cultivators, but people like Li Ximing naturally didn't count them among the ranks. When they spoke of Earth Virtue cultivators, they were referring to figures at the Daoist Master level of the Immortal Dao. Tinglan nodded in agreement, her voice growing somber.

"Indeed. And the geological signs are somewhat similar to 'Manifestations Earth'—one of the two ancient daoist traditions of Sheji, specifically the She daoist tradition, also known as She Immortals. This matter has been a headache for me for a long time. I discussed it with several other Daoist Friends, and their consensus was… the She Immortal dao is a leader of the Immortal Dao. It's best not to dig too deeply."

The daoist traditions of Earth Virtue were numerous and complex; Li Ximing himself had heard of at least six. He could faintly grasp how prominent this Dao must have been in ancient times. The two daoist traditions of Sheji were particularly famous. Although her own Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was noble, its backers were either missing or in seclusion. It might even be a step lower than this She Immortal path. It was no wonder she felt uneasy.

Soon, they arrived at his cave dwelling. Tinglan's eyes lit up in surprise. "What a potent True Fire! This is… from the Three-Cycle lineage, isn't it? That is truly ancient."

That single sentence revealed the depth of knowledge possessed by the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Li Ximing gave a slight nod. His divine ability had already concealed the cauldron completely. Tinglan swept the area with her spiritual sense and smiled. "Such skill and daring. To think a simple Qi Refining cauldron is enough for you to refine such a top-tier spirit pill!"

It was a prettier way of calling him poor, but Li Ximing took it in stride. "I came up with the formula for this pill on a whim, and it is not yet complete. Fortunately, it has reached the nurturing stage. The pill you require needs the Immeasurable Water and Fire and a different cauldron, so there is no conflict."

Hearing him finally bring up her pill, Tinglan crossed her arms and smiled. "Your formations were so well hidden with those mountain-piercing nails, I couldn't even find a trace of you. If I hadn't gotten word from Houfu, I might have ended up doing all this for nothing."

Tinglan's words were spoken in jest, but there was a kernel of truth in them. Li Ximing apologized profusely. "Although there was a delay, it was a blessing in disguise. My skill in the Dao of alchemy has greatly improved, and I am now far more confident in refining your spirit pill."

Tinglan laughed, then her expression turned serious. "We can't delay any longer. I need this pill urgently. Otherwise, considering your recent troubles, I wouldn't have chased you all the way out to this remote sea."

"I have brought the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness and the Immeasurable Water and Fire. As for the cauldron…" Tinglan's already beautiful face became solemn. "I have even managed to borrow the spiritual artifact, the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron, for you."

‘What a grand display… this pill is no ordinary thing.’

Li Ximing was already very confident he could refine the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill, especially with the aid of a better cauldron and Talisman Qi. He nodded slightly. "Then let us choose a place and begin… refining the ingredients for your pill will be a time-consuming process. The sooner we start, the better."

He considered for a moment. "Refining such a spirit pill is best done in a suitable treasure land… I wonder if the East A-Wang Sea has such a place."

Li Ximing was an alchemist, after all. At his words, Tinglan began to ponder. He glanced at her and smiled. "How about this? Refining the spiritual ingredients is a lengthy process, but fortunately, it isn't picky about the location. I will begin the initial refinement here while you take your immortal carriage to search for a suitable place. Once I have finished with the ingredients, we can move to the treasure land for the final step of forming the pill."

Tinglan nodded slightly, thinking it was a reasonable plan, but she remained cautious. "The method is good, and it's not that I don't trust you, Daoist Friend. You can keep the Immeasurable Water and Fire here for refinement. However, the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron was borrowed from the Great Xiukui Monastery and cannot be left behind. I can lend you my Treasure Elephant Cauldron to use instead. It's a Foundation Establishment Realm-grade furnace."

With his own pill on the verge of completion, Li Ximing's real intention was to send her away. The primary ingredient of his pill was a Supreme Yin spiritual item, and since her sect was once a subordinate of the Immortal Mansion, he was afraid she might recognize something. Hearing her offer, he could only grumble inwardly.

‘Wonderful. Even a non-alchemist's cauldron is better than mine.’

Whether it was the Treasure Elephant Cauldron or the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron, both were leagues better than his own River-Heart Cauldron. He had no objections. "That's fine," he said with a smile.

Tinglan produced an earthen pot, no bigger than her palm. Its surface was smooth and engraved with many gold and white patterns. Holding it, she explained, "This Supreme Minister's Gourd is also a spiritual artifact, crafted by Martial Uncle Zimu back in the day. The Immeasurable Water and Fire within it cannot be removed or escape. Even if lost, it will find its way back from the Great Void."

The Immeasurable Water and Fire was, after all, a precious item. Her words were a subtle warning. She opened the lid, and a ball of radiant flame immediately leaped out. Hues of azure and indigo, the colors of the two primal forces, swirled together. The spiritual energy in the cave dwelling instantly withered. His nearby Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire began to hum, its flames distorting rapidly, threatening to ruin his pill.

But Li Ximing simply reached out and gently grasped it. The Immeasurable Water and Fire instantly grew docile, settling quietly in his hand, its two colors stabilizing into a multicolored sphere.

Tinglan let out a visible sigh of relief, her hand that had been tensed over the lid finally relaxing. She nodded in surprise. "Impressive skill, Daoist Friend!"

The Immeasurable Water and Fire was inherently violent, and having been bound to a spiritual artifact, it couldn't be truly refined, only borrowed. This added another layer of difficulty to controlling it. Tinglan's earlier repeated warnings were not without reason.

Seeing Li Ximing handle it with ease, she felt the endeavor was already halfway to success. Overjoyed, she took out a treasure box from her sleeve and said in a low voice, "The spiritual ingredients for the pill are all in this box. There are two portions for most of them. For the few that are exceptionally rare, if the refinement fails, please adjust the formula as you see fit."

Li Ximing scanned the contents with his spiritual sense and was left speechless. A sense of caution rose within him.

‘This thing is far too important to Purple Smoke. Success would be wonderful, but failure would be both awkward and an offense.’

The woman in autumn-yellow robes beckoned lightly, and a massive cauldron woven from gold and ivory hues appeared from her sleeve. The heads of elephants were cast on its four corners, shimmering with spiritual light. This had to be the Treasure Elephant Cauldron.

Tinglan passed the dharma artifact to him as if shedding a heavy burden, her tone becoming much livelier. She quickly said her goodbyes, took a few steps back to exit the range of the Immeasurable Water and Fire, and vanished into the Great Void.

Li Ximing observed the azure and indigo flames of the Immeasurable Water and Fire swirling in his hand, a hint of envy in his heart.

‘This spirit fire wasn't made for alchemy. Wielding something like this in a fight would make one virtually invincible. No wonder Zimu went to the trouble of binding it to a spiritual artifact. If you sever the connection while fleeing, an enemy can't just appear next to you. And for ambushes, it's even more potent…’

He could feel the raw, untamed nature of the flame, but with his Valley Wind Guide-Fire technique, controlling it was still effortless. The Supreme Minister's Gourd was an ingenious, masterfully crafted item that granted the Immeasurable Water and Fire a degree of autonomy. Even though Tinglan had left with the main spiritual artifact, what remained in his hand was not a mere magical flame, but the Immeasurable Water and Fire itself.

‘The work of Daoist Master Zimu… judging by his age, he must be quite old now. Whether he's truly missing or just in hiding, it's hard to say…’

He activated the Immeasurable Water and Fire, moved the Treasure Elephant Cauldron into place, and sent a stream of spiritual ingredients flying into it.

‘Refining the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill is a troublesome task. This will give the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire more than enough time to finish nurturing my own spirit pill!’
