# Chapter 1116: This Life's Affairs, Concluded

The snow whispered down.

The lake water near the shore had frozen into a solid sheet. A sky full of heavy snow cast a deep gloom over the world, and the roads were empty of figures. Li Suining stood silently in the storm, draped in a thick cloak.

_Crunch._

The sound of breaking ice and snow was both muffled and sharp. He trudged a few steps, sinking deep with each footfall, before stopping. He stared into the swirling blizzard.

'So this is how the Heavenly Element is used?'

Rebirth into a second life had sent Li Suining into fits of near-maniacal joy. Countless threads of thought had unraveled for him in that instant. Even looking back on the past few years, he found new clarity.

'The Vast Cicada affair was never just my doing. I am not the only one who has changed things between this present world and the first. At Xuanmiao Temple... beside Qi Lanyan, there is someone else!'

This solved so many of the mysteries that had plagued him.

'Gongsun Bei's baffling arrival at the lake wasn't random, either. It wasn't an impact I caused. It was him... Fan Kang...'

As far as he knew, this Fan Kang was a disciple of the Profound Governance Pavilion. All of Qi Lanyan's recent actions were because of him! It had been an intractable problem for Li Suining, right up until Zhao State lost Jiangnan. Qi Lanyan was forced to flee, suffering defeat after defeat, and finally, Fan Kang died at the hands of his own people.

But soon, another layer of confusion clouded his mind.

'This is the third life, though.'

'Do all Heavenly Element Scions have this ability, or is it just me?'

Li Suining had never left Moongaze Lake, so he'd never had the chance to meet any of these others. Even if ordinary people knew they were reborn and possessed memories of the future, they wouldn't just randomly wonder how many times they had been reborn... or what changes had occurred...

He remained silent.

'If it happened twice, will it happen a third time? When I arrived... it was five years before the Yang clan took the throne... plus ten years of Martial Cultivation meditation, for a total of fifteen years.'

'Is it triggered by time? Or a specific action? When will it be next...'

His gaze drifted, lost. Ever since his rebirth, Li Suining's eyes had always been firm and calm, but standing here in the vast, swirling snow, he felt a sliver of doubt.

'These fifteen years... was I right or wrong?'

He had believed he could reverse everything. The events of his second life had seemed to confirm his impact. He had saved almost everyone who could be saved in Moongaze Lake. The harm from the Murong clan's Compassion Dao bringing the Changhe Rebellion south was also minimized...

In matters concerning the Underworld, his own junior martial uncle hadn't died, which prevented the incident of King Wei entering the imperial court. The relationship between Song and Wei grew even closer. Even Situ Huo's rebellion was strangled in its infancy, forcing that old man to remain reluctantly with the Capital Immortals Dao.

The Dragon-kin were also brought into accord. The Dragon King finally abandoned his plans. The tomb for King Wei, originally planned for the Eastern Sea, became a mere bluff. That Dragon King Danhai, Guangfou, even came to the island personally to present King Wei with the Quest for Gold method of the Wei lineage, which had been lost in the dragon palace!

They had even obtained the crucial Quest for Gold method! His own Daoist Masters had poured out their blood and sweat, doing almost everything that could be done. His King Wei's achievements and reputation were several times greater than in the first life!

But then, someone on Mount Luoxia made a move.

And so, the entire situation collapsed like an avalanche. Li Suining, who had expected to witness King Wei's Quest for Gold, ended up dying even earlier than Li Zhouwei. In fact, almost the entire Li family was wiped out at the very moment Li Zhouwei was verifying the Dao!

Li Jiangchun fell in battle in Jianghuai. Li Que'wan, rushing out of seclusion, was forced to face Yao Guanyi, who had perfected his divine ability. As for their forces in Zhao State, it was a disaster. King Wei's sons were surely scattered, unable to even see one another. Of the remaining troops, who surrendered to the Buddhists and who to Zhao... it was impossible to know.

'Luoxia and the Underworld definitely have Dao Embryo wielders. In other words, immortals.'

The absolute gap in power between them made him feel as if he'd been plunged into an icy abyss, cold to the bone. Li Suining realized he didn't just need to _change_ things; he had to _defeat_ them. And blindly increasing his own strength wouldn't be enough.

He stared grimly at the lake's surface, a trace of regret in his eyes.

'Wei Xuanyin.'

In the first life, Wei Xuanyin, the Grand Preceptor of Great Zhao, had died while seeking the Dao. It was said he was only a single step from the Golden Rank, a fact that had once shaken the world.

But in the second life, King Wei defeated the Zhao army ahead of schedule, invaded the lands of Qi, contended for the Central Plains, and entered Guanlong. His cultivation speed doubled, and his presence reached its zenith. Li Suining was overjoyed at the time and immediately plotted with the Profound Governance group to ambush and kill Wei Xuanyin, proposing,

'Your Majesty must kill Xuanlou. Retread the path of imperial might and seek the Golden Rank.'

Yang Zhuo gave this matter his full support, even emphasizing it several times. But when they were gathered in the mystic realm, King Wei was clearly displeased. He had said,

'Xuanlou seeks to uphold the balance of yin and yang. His Dao is righteous. There is no benefit in eliminating him.'

But Li Suining was driven by two things. First, he wanted King Wei's path to enlightenment to be smoother, and removing this man would also fulfill the Song Emperor's wish. Second, he felt that Wei Xuanyin's fated death while seeking the Dao would unleash a wave of yin energy that would affect Li Zhouwei. If he could be eliminated, even if only to accumulate prestige, it would be for the best.

He had been blinded by the favorable situation. After all, in Li Suining's eyes, the second life was proceeding perfectly under his guidance. The relationship between the Yang and Li clans was excellent, and the Song Emperor was friends with King Wei. That emperor was destined for greatness and was known for honoring his word. With a Golden Core expert providing shelter, his family's future was secure.

With a safe retreat, the natural next step was to ensure Li Zhouwei could succeed in-attaining the Dao.

He deliberated for three days before finally hardening his resolve. He said:

'If we do not kill Xuanlou, the northern lands cannot be pacified. Your Majesty has already mastered all five methods. Removing him would be a favor to the Song Emperor and would protect our clan.'

Simultaneously, the storm in the northern lands intensified, pushing the situation to a peak of chaos. Aided by various factors, the Great Daoist Master Xuanlou fell in the imperial capital of Great Zhao.

But now, as he stood in the snow, a bitter realization struck him.

'Wei Xuanyin didn't represent Great Zhao, or the Profound Governance Pavilion, or even the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao!'

'He didn't seem to have close ties to Luoxia, but he _represented_ the ideals or plans of a certain faction on Mount Luoxia... His death ripped away their 'face' entirely...'

'That wasn't a good thing... In fact, it was a warning. A warning that mortal affairs had spun out of control and were threatening the grander scheme! It made Luoxia turn its gaze this way!'

'The sudden collapse of the situation in my previous life... his death was the starting point. Once Yao Guanyi took charge of the mortal realm, it was just as he said... things were already irreversible!'

Even thinking of it now, his gaze dimmed.

'Qi Lanyan, having been protected by Xuanlou, should have understood. Wei Xuanyin was actually trying to control the situation, to keep it from escalating. When King Wei said he sought to uphold the balance of yin and yang, this is what he meant. Wei Xuanyin was the last person who wanted to see yin and yang destroy each other...'

'Looking at the final result of the second life... Yang Zhuo wasn't comfortable with it either. The emperors joined forces, and after all that struggle, it was the Underworld that profited most. The radiance of Martial Cultivation was several times brighter than in the first life. Meanwhile, certain people from Luoxia lost both 'face' and followers.'

He closed his eyes, thinking for a moment, then shook his head.

'But Yang Zhuo isn't safe, so the Yang family must be suffering too. In truth, the real winners are still Luoxia and the Underworld. The only ones who lost out were the minor factions beneath them...'

He had only been standing for a short while, but the snow had already buried his boots. Li Suining didn't notice, his gaze fixed silently.

'The Underworld is indifferent, but Yang Zhuo isn't evil. The Dragon-kin are fickle, but Guangfou can be reasoned with. Luoxia's power is immense... but fortunately, King Wei doesn't have to defeat that immortalâ€”just the one giving Yao Guanyi orders.'

'The only way to break this stalemate is to make _Him_ miscalculate.'

He stood in the snow for a long time, sorting through his thoughts.

'Regardless, I absolutely must not leave Moongaze Lake. I shouldn't even go north. Staying on the southern shore is best... I'll wait until our Daoist Masters break through, until the mystic realm is established and our life-mandates are secure. Things will be much more stable then...'

...

Profound Governance Pavilion.

The winter snows had lasted an unusually long time this year. Below the immortal platform, everything was a vast expanse of white. Snow and frost caked the stairs, yet a small black shadow could be seen moving upon them.

It was a monk in black robes.

The monk's robes were simple, even thin for the weather. His calves were wrapped in white cloth, a stark contrast to his black shoes. Beside him, Maha Fachang supported him, his face etched with guilt.

"I apologize for troubling you to make this trip, little Martial Grand-Uncle..."

The black-robed monk shook his head, seemingly unbothered. In fact, he looked to be in high spirits as he climbed the steps. Halfway up, he saw a man in white robes strolling down to meet them.

The man's black hair was unbound, his eyes gentle. Against the vast white snow, he had an ethereal, immortal bearing. It was none other than Wei Xuanyin of Great Zhao.

He smiled.

"Forgive me for not welcoming you sooner. I am Xuanlou, a disciple of the Transformation."

The black-robed monk smiled in return.

"You honor me. I am Kongshu of the dharma realm."

This monk was none other than Kongshu, the disciple from the dharma realm with the highest Dao-Profundity and the most vast divine ability!

Fachang watched this, and beyond his surprise, he felt a surge of joy, even excitement.

The Profound Governance Pavilion belonged to the Viewing Pavilion faction. If one traced its Transformation Daoist Tradition all the way back, it had deep connections, claiming lineage from a direct disciple of the Master of Comprehending Profoundity. It was a noble heritage, and as a result, the cultivators there held Buddhist cultivators in low regard.

Even Buddhist cultivators with connections, like Vast Cicada, wouldn't be offered a seat here, let alone be welcomed personally by the host!

Wei Xuanyin had always been humble, so the greeting didn't seem out of place. But for the guest to be a Buddhist cultivator... the implication was profound.

'At least... the Profound Governance Pavilion acknowledges our little Martial Grand-Uncle's status. They recognize his Dao-Profundity... No wonder they deferred and delayed, finally forcing him to be the one to come.'

At this thought, Fachang felt a bit more confident about their objective. He fell in silently behind Kongshu as the black-robed monk sighed.

"Senior, you are too formal."

Wei Xuanyin replied,

"Liaohe Temple is the orthodox line of the Buddhist Dao. Furthermore, it is the place where Zhizhan Tianjia succeeded in verifying the Dao. It is only right to offer such a welcome."

As soon as he said this, Fachang's heart sank. All the joy he'd felt was instantly drained away, replaced by a bitter taste.

'So that's it... _that's_ the status they're acknowledging!'

When Kongshu heard this, he fell silent for a moment. For the first time, a flicker of confusion crossed his brow. He pressed his palms together and replied, 

"Liaohe Temple is in the past. Senior Xuanlou need not dwell on it."

Wei Xuanyin didn't answer, merely leading the two to the top. He stopped before the main plaque. The monk Kongshu pressed his palms together.

"There is no need to go inside. We can spare Senior Xuanlou the trouble."

Wei Xuanyin hesitated for a moment. The heavy snow drifted down around them. He lowered the hand that had been resting on the hall door.

"Very well."

The three of them began to walk casually through the snow on the wide platform. The black-robed monk seemed lost in memory and grew very quiet. After a long time, he spoke.

"Mount Dayang has had some disputes with my realm. We have... disagreements... about the south. This is not something my realm can resolve alone. We must ask Senior Xuanlou to help us deliberate."

Wei Xuanyin shook his head.

"Great Virtue, you came because of Vast Cicada. It seems Mount Dayang cannot swallow this loss. They want to use this as a pretext to force my hand, to have me reclaim the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple for you."

Kongshu did not deny it. He pressed his palms together.

"I am ashamed. We were busy settling the dharma lineage and gathering the dharma corpses. Disputes arose within the dharma realm, and the matter was delayed time and again, bringing us to this day."

Wei Xuanyin's eyes grew colder, though he smiled.

"I thought monastics were above worldly affairs. And yet, here you are, shirking responsibility."

The sarcasm was biting, but Kongshu merely shook his head.

"Being unstained by the world... our disciples' cultivation is insufficient. They cannot achieve it. Their Dao-Profundity is lacking. They do not have the state of mind to make a boat of the bitter sea, so naturally, they dared not respond."

"Hm?"

Wei Xuanyin froze, frowning at the monk. He saw only frankness in the man's expression. His eyes were bright and clean, without a trace of hypocrisy. Wei Xuanyin realized he had misjudged him and nodded to himself.

'He really is more capable than Fachang.'

Before the black-robed monk could speak again, Fachang chimed in with a sigh.

"Daoist Qi oversaw the situation that led to the violent death of our Dao's Maha. Though he had no intent to harm, the karma remains. This cannot be dismissed lightly... Within the dharma realm... there are many voices questioning Lord Wei..."

Wei Xuanyin blinked.

"Me?"

His Dao-Profundity was immense, and he was an exceptionally sharp man. He understood the implication immediately and burst out laughing.

"Oh? You think I'm the one destroying the Bright Yang? Using it for my own cultivation?"

"What a joke!"

Kongshu shook his head and held up a hand, cutting Fachang off.

"Senior Xuanlou, Vast Cicada fell to his own karma. No one else is to blame... Kongshu merely has one question."

Wei Xuanyin looked up as the black-robed monk continued.

"What is it you are waiting for, Lord Wei?"

The monk pressed his palms together, looking directly at Wei Xuanyin.

"Since the Profound Governance group was entrusted to you, the intentions of the mountain should be clear. Yet you seem reluctant to be the enemy of the Bright Yang. If you had been willing to act, the situation would not be as it is today."

A smile touched Wei Xuanyin's lips as he listened.

"I've heard the Realm Lord has many Golden Lands, and vacant positions as well. Why do you, Kongshu, delay? Why do you remain, listening to sutras and pondering Zen? If you were willing to step forward, I imagine you would already be a great personage."

The monk didn't seem surprised. He finally smiled, though his expression was tinged with regret.

"Lord Wei, today the Bright Yang rises only to fall. It is not an auspicious time. Why not temporarily retreat to a yin position and serve the greater good? Seize your destiny, and seek the Dao in the next life. Is that not the favored method of your tradition?"

Wei Xuanyin sneered.

"If this life is defiled, how can the next be free of it? Every one of you hopes I will join you in the muck, that I will walk a heretical path. Even the Zhao Emperor schemes against me, deliberately granting me the title of King. I understand. You are all betting that I will fall, that I will be killed, that I will seek and never find."

"But my life-mandate is my own. If I am to succeed, who can plot against me? And if I am not..."

He lowered his gaze, brushing the snowflakes from his sleeve.

"This life's Dao will be settled in this life."
