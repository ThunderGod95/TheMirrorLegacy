# Chapter 965: True Qi

"The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal..."

The Great Void was dim and somber. Faint illusions shrouded the scene. The grand array’s crimson light blazed, and though the Great Void appeared empty, bursts of brilliance would surge forth, only to be extinguished an instant later.

An endless, pale-yellow iridescence descended, a near-infinite phantom brilliance. The clouds and mists of the Great Void drifted, rapidly dissipating as Chi Buzi departed.

When the radiance faded, a man was revealed, sitting cross-legged.

He had a youthful face, with fine brows and large, elegant eyes. He gazed intently into the Great Void before suddenly turning his head to ask:

"Fellow Daoist, what do you make of this treasure?"

Thunder rumbled in response. On the other side, purple lightning and smoky clouds coalesced, revealing a heroic woman with willow-leaf brows and almond eyes. She held a silver spear, exuding a formidable aura.

"I did not get a close look."

"But the Dragon Monarch said... this item definitely has a connection, though we don't know to where."

The two of them traversed the Great Void. With a single step, the surrounding scenery fell away like a black curtain. Illusions shifted infinitely. Purple lightning sparked in the darkness, and the void itself swelled, transforming into a vast, violet-white circular pool.

A dense, viscous liquid of violet-white lightning floated up. Purple bolts of thunder crashed down into the pool. Deep-azure copper and iron surfaces emerged, covered in lightning patterns, from which a silver-white palace leaped forth.

They had arrived at the Thunder Pool.

Dongfang Heyun’s expression was calm. He sat down in a small pavilion within the palace. The woman formed of purple lightning picked up a teapot—it was none other than Li Qinghong.

She poured the tea, filling cups for them both, and spoke softly:

"This original master of the Jade True... was he truly so remarkable?"

Dongfang Heyun chuckled twice, raised his cup, and said in a low voice:

"To put it bluntly, among all the heroes of history, those who could definitively surpass him... you wouldn't need more than ten fingers to count!"

The dignified man lowered his head to sip the tea, but the taste was so surprisingly potent that he winced for a moment.

He smacked his lips, set the cup down first, and only then continued:

"I have followed my Lord for a long time. I can tell you a few things."

"The foremost figures in this world, past and present, are the Immortal Lords. This title usually refers to cultivators who existed before the birth of the Five Virtues and the Five Waters and Five Fires. As for their Daoist Tradition, the Dragon Monarch calls it..."

He said slowly, "Orthodox Origin Yin-Yang."

Dongfang Heyun paused slightly before continuing: "Later, the Five Virtues were born, and the Five Waters and Fires descended upon the world. Fruition Attainment became possible. The Three Profundities successively produced True Monarchs and Immortals. Although their strength was outstanding, they no longer called themselves Immortal Lords. Many Demon beasts also achieved Fruition Attainment. The very strongest among them was the True Hornless Dragon, hailed as the First Demon, whose cultivation was so profound it topped the ranks of Immortals."

"'Pristine' and 'Converging' colluded, and the Nine Sons were born. The master of the Converging Water was the Dragon Monarch of the Eastern Sea, honorably named Dongfang Rijiu. He was often suspected by ancient cultivators to be the reincarnation of the True Hornless Dragon... From the moment of his birth, he was at the peak of the Golden Core."

"The so-called Nine Sons of the True Hornless Dragon consisted of six 'Converging' and three 'Pristine'. The 'Pristine' were all Intercalary Positions, and the 'Converging' were all Auxiliary Positions. Later, they were all killed, one by one. The Dragon Monarch of the Eastern Sea fell at the hands of the world's first Sword Immortal... And this second Sword Immortal..."

He looked gravely at Li Qinghong and replied, "Later... was the master of the Jade True."

Li Qinghong was thoughtful. "So that's how it is... In that case, did this current Jade True's attainment of the Dao also benefit from the status of a Sword Immortal?"

Dongfang Heyun nodded. "Precisely!"

He sighed. "Furthermore, the Jade True is one of the Three Shaman Daos, and also controls the Great Dao of real and illusory, true and false. The transformations are incredibly difficult. That person is already an Immortal; when he transforms into something, even another Immortal wouldn't be able to see through the illusion!"

Li Qinghong frowned. "Therefore, the methods of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal..."

"The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal cannot be divined."

Dongfang Heyun shook his head, speaking softly. "The story of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal wasn't divined by any Lord. It was told by Immortal Yingze to the Six Sons of Chongming back in the day!"

Li Qinghong nodded silently. She recalled the details for a moment, then frowned and asked, "The Dragon Monarch of the Eastern Sea... fell to a Sword Immortal... This must involve a conflict between Daoist Traditions. What Dao did that Immortal cultivate?"

Dongfang Heyun's expression grew distant. "His title can no longer be mentioned... That Lord achieved 'Empty Attestation'!"

"'Empty Attestation'?"

Li Qinghong pressed, and Dongfang Heyun explained: "Empty Attestation means to use 'what is' to prove 'what is not.' This Fruition Attainment did not originally exist. Whether by borrowing or concealing, one is able to attest to it through the Great Dao, forcing the world to recognize one additional position!"

"What?"

Li Qinghong understood a great deal about Fruition Attainment now, but this sounded utterly bizarre. Dongfang Heyun shook his head, a deep horror surfacing in his eyes.

"This is a matter of ancient history; just listen to it as a story. This position was for the Way of the Sword... It is the source of all Sword Origin and Sword Intent in the world, and simultaneously, it is the fundamental root and status of a Sword Immortal!"

"The saying 'The sword is the monarch of all weapons' comes from this."

Dongfang Heyun was silent for a long time. At last, he sighed. "I've heard there are different types of Empty Attestation, but this Lord was truly terrifying. He did not borrow, nor did he conceal; he attested to it from thin air. You could say he was one of a kind. During the war between Immortals and Devils, he successively slew two Wood Virtue cultivators, injured countless other ancient cultivators, and then departed freely. From ancient times to now, he is worthy of being called the number one..."

His voice dropped. "He is also the reason the Wood Virtue has been in decline ever since."

Li Qinghong was dumbstruck. She pondered this, and after a long moment, said, "This is the fundamental root and status of a sword cultivator... No wonder... No wonder Sword Immortals can annihilate divine abilities and slay those at the Purple Mansion Realm. So this is the reason!"

Dongfang Heyun shook his head with a wry laugh. "Do you know why a Sword Immortal must always achieve their status _before_ attaining a divine ability?!"

Li Qinghong's pupils widened slightly as she looked at the refined man before her.

"A divine ability embodies a Dao lineage. Sword Intent is also an extremely unique and domineering wondrous power. It cannot tolerate a cultivator who has already set foot on another path to come and seek it!"

Li Qinghong let out a long breath, a wave of realization hitting her. Her mind was quick, able to draw inferences. She immediately countered, "If that's the case, True Monarch Shangyuan possessed two Sword Intents back then... Does that mean he had two wondrous powers of the Way of the Sword?! His strength must not have been underestimated, surely?"

Dongfang Heyun's expression was hesitant. He lowered his head and thought for a long while before shaking his head. "I don't think it can be understood that way. That Sword Immortal's path was unique; one Sword Intent is already the absolute limit. All the Lords today actually suspect that True Monarch Shangyuan's two Sword Intents were a transformation from the Jade True's dao of illusion and reality..."

He sighed faintly. "Besides, once one ascends to Fruition Attainment, the help from Sword Intent is not as great as it was in the Purple Mansion Realm..."

The two changed the subject. Just then, a sound echoed in the Great Void. A woman with narrow eyes materialized, her robes fluttering. She had a dignified air, with two long strands of hair falling beside her cheeks.

The two rose together, seemingly to greet her, but the woman waved her hand repeatedly, signaling for them to sit. "Fuxin has come to relay a message on behalf of my Lord. There is no need for ceremony!"

She was quite imposing and stern. Even her polite words didn't sound very polite. She immediately got to the point, continuing:

"I've heard there are movements from both Mount Changhuai and the Underworld. The general situation on the mainland is becoming clearer. My Lord has been gestating the thunder for a long time, and the nature of the True Qi is about to manifest. I must ask you two to take the various Kings on a trip."

...

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

"RUMBLE!"

The rolling sound of thunder echoed from within the clouds. It spread from the dark storm clouds over the mountain peak and quickly reached the turbulent lake below. Yet, the cultivators coming and going passed by, accustomed to it, flying past the base of the mountain without even raising their heads.

The mountainside, however, was covered in surging purple fire. A small, pure-white vase hung in the air, tilted as if pouring. From its mouth, slivers of radiance fell, mixed with Baleful Fire Qi, raining down below.

On the other side, eighteen copper-gold boxes hovered, their colors deep and heavy. They rotated in the air, and spiritual thunder rose from them one by one, descending in sequence, all of it converging between those two fingers.

Radiance and thunderfire intertwined, erupting with Baleful Fire Qi. All of it was gathered by the divine ability and drawn into the solemn Juque Palace.

Within the palace, a great hall stood, five bays wide and three bays deep, supported by eight inner pillars. It was magnificent, a blend of gold and red, their lusters reflecting each other. The thunderfire, radiance, and Baleful Fire Qi were all drawn into the hall, forming a spinning vortex of thunder and fire that swept through the space.

An unknown amount of time passed before the Juque Palace suddenly shuddered. The great hall standing tall within it burst into brilliant color, emanating a wondrous aura. A man opened his golden eyes and exhaled a breath of Baleful Fire Qi.

**"[Emperor Qi's Light] is complete!"**

The eighteen copper boxes fell, one by one. The Profound Pattern Vase in the sky also retracted its brilliance, no longer pouring out radiance, and floated lightly down onto the desk. With a thought from Li Zhouwei, the vase leaped up and flew into the baleful spring on the mountain.

Nine of the eighteen copper boxes still shimmered with lightning, clearly not yet depleted.

Li Zhouwei calculated with his fingers. Only nine months had passed.

'Emperor Qi's Light is complex, but it wasn't too difficult for me. Not to mention I had an endless supply of radiance, lightning, and Baleful Fire Qi...'

He had taken a full eighteen streams of spiritual thunder, but this spell art didn't have a high demand for it. Even with the extra consumption from rapidly advancing the art's progress, he had only used nine in the end.

As Li Zhouwei exhaled the Baleful Fire Qi, the spot between his brows brightened slightly. A speck of radiance flashed and then sank deep within, and all sorts of new insights welled up in his mind.

Although it also originated from the Juque Palace and was emitted from the glabella, it was different from the 'Radiant Chamber' of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. The description for Emperor Qi's Light was 'Divergent Light Streams'. Once activated, it could shoot beams of light and electricity from between his brows, numerous and incredibly fast.

'It seems to have compensated for some of the clumsiness...'

His mood improved considerably. He had someone store the copper boxes, and then saw Li Que'wan come forward to report.

Li Zhouwei's gaze was sharp. He scanned her up and down and nodded.

"Your cultivation is solid, and your spiritual sense is condensed. Your current cultivation base is stable. You can take the pill and break through to the late stage."

The Li family had the support of the Talisman Pill, so each stage of cultivation was like skipping a minor realm. This was less obvious in Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining, but the effects were immediate and drastic in the Foundation Establishment Realm and Purple Mansion Realm. Li Que'wan understood he was referring to the Talisman Pill and acknowledged.

"This junior has come to report... In recent years, many of the non-family cultivators went into seclusion to attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, but most failed and perished... However, there is finally good news. A few days ago, An Xuanxin and An Xuantong of the An family both successfully broke through."

Li Zhouwei was naturally aware of this. Most of those who had entered seclusion at this time were older cultivators whose innate talent and cultivation methods were poor to begin with, so their chances were naturally low. The success of the rising generation was much higher, which was undoubtedly good news. He nodded.

"The An family bloodline is truly extraordinary."

But Li Que'wan continued in a gentle voice, "Aside from them, there was also one from the Eastern Yue. He had earned the right to attempt the breakthrough long ago, but he requested a compatible cultivation method from the clan and spent time converting all his dharma power. After a long seclusion, he had a fortunate breakthrough a year ago. His name is Dili Youjie. He has been wanting to pay his respects to Uncle, but didn't dare to disturb you..."

Li Zhouwei was rather surprised. He replied, "I know of him... His talent is poor; 'hard-working' is the only word to describe him. He's quite lucky... to actually break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

"He's an old-timer. Very well, I'll see him."

Li Que'wan nodded and withdrew. Before Dili Youjie even had a chance to come up, a young man in crimson robes who had been waiting for some time hurried up the mountain. He bowed before him and said respectfully:

"Your son has already been to the Mushroom Forest Plains and has returned to report to Father!"

Li Zhouwei immediately raised his eyebrows, listening with full attention as he recounted the entire experience.

"Crystal brine, white cranes, intertwined serpents, water and fire..."

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain, radiance flickered, and white flowers drifted like waves. Li Zhouwei listened, his expression turning grave.

"'True Qi'..."

"Reporting to Father, yes, 'True Qi'!"

Li Jiangqian's words were filled with suspicion. He said in a low voice, "This person has a rounded brow, short, sharp eyes, and an extraordinary presence. He has the aura of one destined to achieve the Dao, yet he harbors the ambition to conquer and pacify a region. The Yang family's intentions are clear as day."

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze, lost in thought. "He's no ordinary character. It's possible he's a manifestation of that one fiend that escaped!"

The True Monarch Tianwu, who held the 'True Qi' position, once left three suits of armor in the grotto-heaven to guard Anhuai Heaven. Later, when Anhuai Heaven fell, the three suits of armor transformed into three streams of Metallic Essence.

Of these three streams of Metallic Essence, two were obtained by Mount Changhuai and Purple Smoke, respectively. The remaining one escaped into the Great Void, instantly transforming into a fiend and killing a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Southern Sea. That cultivator hailed from the Jingyi Daoist Tradition, a fellow disciple of Daoist Master Xuanyi.

Once Metallic Essence transforms into a fiend, it can only be handled by the Underworld. The Yang family has always had unclear dealings with the Underworld. For a 'True Qi' figure to appear now... it's likely the manifestation of the 'True Qi' that the Underworld obtained!

Li Jiangqian nodded silently. Li Zhouwei said in a low voice:

"Pacifying the Yue State... What great skill. What perfect timing."

What kind of state is the Yue State in today? The Three Sects and Seven Gates are collapsing one by one. Hengzhu, Purple Smoke, and Xiukui have all gone into seclusion. Changxiao has vanished. Azure Pond doesn't even have a Daoist Master to preside over it...

Now that this Yang Zhuo has appeared, who is left to stop him?

Li Zhouwei held a golden slip, tapping it lightly on the desk. He sorted through the various threads of information in his mind, and things became clearer. He said calmly:

"Yang Zhuo's trail didn't just appear today or yesterday. Ning Wan must have been aware of him long ago. No wonder as soon as Suiguan left, she simply abandoned Azure Pond and went into hiding... She can't afford to provoke him either!"

Li Jiangqian's gaze was heavy. "As your son sees it, this plan wasn't hatched in a day or two... Being in Jiangnan, the Yang family must have been the first to know about our Wei-Li bloodline. The incident with Yang Tianya back then was foreshadowing. It was a subtle hint... all so that today, our family would feel at ease letting people go, and not interfere with the Yang family's grand plan!"

"Mmm..."

Li Zhouwei glanced at him and replied, "As for what you said... about him and I being the same kind of figure... that's not accurate."

"I merely received the passing favor of a Fruition Attainment. He, on the other hand, is very likely the sole focus of a Tianwu Metallic Essence. It might even be on his person, or inside his Shengyang Acupoint, making him no different from a fiend. And with the Underworld backing him... there are probably few in this world who can compare to him."

"But..."

Li Jiangqian's gaze darkened. "If that's the case... how should our family position itself?"
