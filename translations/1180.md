# Chapter 1180: The Spirit Within the Corpse

'The deaths of two mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators… This must be the result.'

A wave of emotion washed over Li Que'wan. She scanned the transformed landscape, her slender fingers moving through a series of calculations.

'In the heavens, a wind still howls with the lingering grievance of Horn Wood's fall. In the earth, a killing aura festers from a shattered divine ability. The two forces are locked in a grim balance, their influence poisoning several realms. Without outside intervention, this turmoil will not subside for three centuries, and the Baleful Earth energy will not dissipate for five.'

Qi Lanyan’s divine ability had been the stronger of the two, but the verdant wind was merely one facet of the power unleashed by his demise. Suspended high in the sky, it was vulnerable to interference and thus would fade sooner. The baleful aura, by contrast, steeped itself deep within the ground, nurturing its strength and proving far more difficult to eradicate.

'This land has every advantage… save for one. The Baleful Earth is too dense and the earth veins too shallow. With no great mountains, it's easy to attack and impossible to defend. If we cannot claim Baihai Creek as a natural barrier, we will be at the mercy of others. I only wonder… which Dao Lineage will be fortunate enough to claim such a rich and blessed land in the end?'

She withdrew her gaze and pressed onward. After crossing a surging river, a familiar great lake slowly came into view. Her eyes reddened with emotion.

'I haven't been home in decades!'

Li Que'wan rode the winds over the water's shimmering surface, where she could just make out the distant figures of her family's cultivators absorbing spiritual qi. A pang of nostalgia struck her; everything was so familiar, yet so foreign. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she dared not reveal herself, instead guiding her descent toward the immortal mountain blanketed in fragrant gardenias.

---

The Daoist Master in the white-gold robes had just finished refining a batch of spiritual materials and was contemplating a jade slip. Suddenly, he felt the grand defensive array stir. He frowned, his gaze sweeping over the mountainside, but the path below was empty save for gardenia petals drifting like freshly fallen snow.

The sight gave Li Ximing pause. He swiftly brought two fingers together, unleashing the Light of the Six Harmonies. A crystalline glow, as pure as snow, bloomed in the air before softly melting away to reveal the figure of a woman.

She wore a simple dress, her smile gentle and her arched brows framing eyes that shimmered as if on the verge of tears. A single dot of crimson adorned her forehead. Yet for all her delicate appearance, her aura was a tempest of a thousand changes, a brilliant divine ability that could turn sand to mercury.

A warmth spread through Li Ximing’s chest, and he nearly fumbled his pill furnace. His normally placid face lit up with profound surprise. Meeting her tear-filled, excited gaze, he let out a sound that was half laugh, half sigh.

"So, the cultivator of our family's Whole Pill divine ability has returned!"

Li Que'wan pressed her lips together and nodded, her voice soft.

"I have not disappointed your faith in me, Daoist Master… My only regret is that my breakthrough was too slow. I was unable to lend my strength during the great battle!"

Before Li Que'wan's return, Li Ximing’s mind had been a tangle of thoughts, preoccupied with the Hengzhu Spiritual Treasure and the Art of Demoting Yin. But now, seeing this junior standing before him, radiating the power of her new divine ability, all other concerns vanished. Overwhelmed with emotion, he folded his sleeves.

"That you could achieve your divine ability and return safely puts my heart at ease. That is more reassuring than any Spiritual Treasure or immortal art!"

The young woman nodded forcefully, the redness in her eyes quickly receding.

"King Wei…"

Li Ximing knew Guo Nanwu must have brought her the news. He chose his words carefully.

"He is stable for the moment."

The words were a balm to Li Que'wan's anxiety, and the tension left her frame. Li Ximing extended two fingers, directing a stream of Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire into his furnace before hurrying with her toward the main island.

"I have just come from the sea," Li Que'wan sighed. "Lake Xian has been transformed into a vast plain. It is truly a work of heaven and earth, a worthy foundation for a sect."

Li Ximing had been secluded and hadn't yet heard of this. He was struck with a sense of sorrowful wonder.

"In his life, Changxi was always troubled by the inadequacy of his mountain gate and the poverty of Lake Xian. He spent years moving mountains and shifting ridges, pouring his very soul into the effort, yet it could never be considered a grand foundation. What a pity… what a tragedy. The grand foundation he dreamed of was built upon the ruins of the Profound Peak Gate!"

Though she didn't know the full history, Li Que'wan had seen enough on her journey to understand. She said nothing as they entered the dimly lit hall.

"Come," Li Ximing smiled. "I will teach you the incantation."

He formed a seal with his hands, creating a connection to the grotto-heaven. Li Que'wan respectfully mirrored his actions and began to circulate her energy. Her vision flared with light as a spiritual essence of incredible density and perfect balance washed over her, causing her hair to drift and her eyes to shine.

'The Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance!'

As a cultivator of the Whole Pill Dao, Li Que'wan was exceptionally sensitive to spiritual atmospheres. Her training demanded constant control over the balance of yin and yang, giving her a familiarity with it that surpassed even the Daoist Masters. The profound nature of this place stunned her.

"Yin and yang are in perfect equilibrium…"

Li Ximing turned and saw the excitement on her face, which was now tinged with a faint blush. She formed another seal, murmuring,

"This is… absolute equilibrium of yin and yang…"

A flicker of confusion crossed Li Ximing’s face as Li Que'wan spoke with urgency.

"My cultivation of the Whole Pill is all about regulating yin and yang, lead and mercury, water and fire, Valley Water and Molten Fire. I understand balance intimately. For a Whole Pill cultivator, performing any secret art, or even just certain forms of cultivation, begins with adjusting yin and yang. Only by first achieving that balance can one begin to precisely control increases in yin or decreases in yang, creating specific environments to achieve myriad transformations."

"You could say that over seventy percent of the first step in any Whole Pill transformation is simply finding that balance!"

"But no matter how fine the adjustment, it's impossible to achieve this… this mythical, absolute balance that exists in this grotto-heaven!"

She had known the grotto-heaven maintained a yin-yang balance, but she had never conceived of a perfect equality that should only exist in theory. She formed and released her hand seals several times in disbelief.

"This means… when performing arts within this grotto-heaven, I can simply draw upon the ambient spiritual qi and completely skip the first step required in the outside world. The result would be infinitely more precise than even my most careful preparations…"

Li Ximing didn't understand the intricacies of such transformations and found her explanation mystifying. He grasped only that it was a very good thing, which bolstered his confidence.

'In that case, the Art of Demoting Yin will be even more effective!'

He nodded with a smile and led the still-reeling Li Que'wan down to the lowest level of the pagoda. There, King Wei, Li Zhouwei, sat cross-legged in silent cultivation.

Li Que'wan's gaze passed over the network of scars covering his body. A pang of sympathy made her lower her head as she bowed respectfully.

"Junior Que'wan has forged the divine ability, Awaiting the Supreme Divine!"

The man on the Jade Terrace had already opened his eyes. His dark pupils fixed on her, and a faint smile touched his lips. Though the motion pulled at the blackened wounds, lending his features a grim cast, his expression held a disarming warmth.

"And what of your divine ability?"

Li Que'wan answered with reverence. "Awaiting the Supreme Divine draws upon the nurturing aspect of the Whole Pill Dao. Its primary focus is on longevity and the path of the Immortal Dao!"

"Once the divine ability was forged, my life-mandate expanded, extending my years. As I nurture it, the ability will accumulate power and, by verifying itself against the great Dao, give birth to a body of lead and mercury. It is called the Divine Corpse."

"A Body Divine Ability?" Li Ximing asked, confused.

Li Que'wan shook her head.

"Not exactly. This body is nurtured within my divine ability and possesses its own life-mandate. My power is not meant for combat, but it is of an exceptionally high quality. Thus, the Divine Corpse offers some aid in battle. After being concealed for a long time, it can be revealed in an instant through an art, unleashing a flash of divine power that can shatter an opponent from the inside out."

"But its true purpose is realized after my death."

"After your death?" Li Ximing sounded alarmed.

The woman, however, smiled.

"If I should die of natural causes, free from outside interference, the Divine Corpse will rise from my bones and continue my life-mandate, living just as I did. It will have a lifespan of one hundred twenty-eight years. For every additional divine ability I possess, it gains another twenty. That is why it is known as the Aegis of Life!"

The revelation was enough to stir even Li Zhouwei. His voice was raspy as he spoke.

"No wonder you call it a path of longevity. With this, your lifespan will be at minimum six hundred and twenty-eight years, and at most seven hundred and eight!"

That was over two centuries longer than a typical Purple Mansion cultivator.

Li Que'wan nodded hesitantly.

"The divine ability specifies a natural death. But, elders, do you recall that I possess a spell art granted by the golden book, called Scattering White Falling Feather? If I can master that art, then even if I am slain, so long as I escape with a sliver of my life-mandate—or even just evade my foe for a moment—I can still manifest the Divine Corpse and survive!"

This escape art dramatically expanded the utility of Awaiting the Supreme Divine. Both Daoist Masters nodded, their faces filled with admiration.

"In my view," Li Que'wan added with a smile, "with Scattering White Falling Feather complementing Awaiting the Supreme Divine, I can escape from ninety-nine percent of the world’s cultivators, even if I cannot defeat them. Unless I face an absolute prodigy from a place like Mount Luoxia or the Underworld, I will always be able to preserve my life!"

Li Ximing smiled and nodded at her words, but King Wei’s eyes remained dark and he gave no reply.

Li Que'wan continued, "The second aspect of my ability is the wondrous use of conjuring a mystic light to seize the power of pills and artifacts. When I consume a medicinal pill, as long as it doesn't conflict with the Whole Pill Dao Lineage, I can always derive some benefit from it. The same is true for Spiritual Artifacts!"

She opened her pale hand to reveal a two-finger-wide, intricately carved moon talisman.

"The Nine Mounds Dao Lineage heard of King Wei's injuries and entrusted me with this Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, an artifact they use to anchor their own destiny. Normally it would require a Supreme Yin cultivator to wield, but with Awaiting the Supreme Divine, I need no one else's aid!"

'A Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure!'

Li Ximing stared at the jade ring in her hand, utterly astonished. Li Zhouwei, however, was more captivated by her divine ability. His speech quickened.

"Seize the power of pills and artifacts? When you use a Spiritual Artifact from another Dao Lineage, how much of its intended power can you command?"

His question cut to the heart of the matter. Li Que'wan’s expression turned serious.

"Setting aside conflicting Dao Lineages, I can wield artifacts from distant traditions at seventy percent of their power. For those more closely related, like the Two Aspects or the Water, Fire, and Metal branches of the Five Virtues, I can command eighty percent or more. And for the most compatible, such as the Three Shamans and Two Rites, it is ninety percent from the moment I touch them!"

"As my Awaiting the Supreme Divine divine ability matures, these figures will all increase by ten percent. Once I pass the Purple Mystery stage, it will increase again. When my divine ability is fully perfected, I will be able to wield any Spiritual Artifact as if it were from my own Dao Lineage, with the sole exception of those from conflicting lineages!"

Li Ximing's eyes blazed. He had spent his early years making do with artifacts from other traditions and knew all too well that an incompatible weapon, if it was of anything less than supreme quality, was barely more effective than a Bright Yang spirit embryo.

"Does that mean… you can take any of the incompatible Spiritual Artifacts in the family’s treasury and wield them to their full potential?"

Li Que'wan smiled and nodded.

"There is one caveat: yin and yang. While not entirely distant, my mastery of them is capped at ninety percent. For Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang specifically, the limit is eighty percent."

Li Ximing frowned.

"But you just said the Whole Pill Dao is about yin and yang, water and fire. How can they not be closely aligned?"

A trace of helplessness crossed her features.

"The Whole Pill Dao looks to Yin and Yang as one looks to the sun and moon. We may bask in their light and borrow their mysteries, but we dare not claim kinship, nor presume to wield their authority."

The sheer audacity of such a concept left Li Ximing speechless. It did not, however, diminish the awesome power of Awaiting the Supreme Divine. He couldn't help but sigh in admiration.

"The Dao of the Whole Pill… It is truly the Great Dao of material transformation. No wonder it is called the origin-embryo of Prime Virtue!"

Changing the subject, Li Que'wan said, "Those are the two most profound aspects. The others—nurturing the various mansions, refining golden mercury—are also part of the Great Dao, but they apply to the esoteric arts of material transformation and are difficult to explain. Beyond those, there is one other minor wonder, an art for commanding beasts…"

When she first broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Que'wan had hinted at these wonders. Now that they had manifested as a divine ability, each was more astonishing than the last. Li Ximing's interest was piqued.

"What kind of art is it?"

The woman smiled.

"It's nothing remarkable, really. It grants some ability to tame Demon beasts, but it’s in an awkward spot—too trivial for a Foundation Establishment cultivator to bother with, but not potent enough for a Purple Mansion cultivator. It also allows me to collect a Demon beast's spiritual nature. With a flick of a finger and a single word, I can strip a sliver of it away. And because Awaiting the Supreme Divine reflects it back, the beast’s life-mandate is not harmed, nor is its path to achieving a divine ability obstructed."

Spiritual nature, as it was called, was said to be unique to Demon beasts. It was an incomplete fragment of their life-mandate, hidden deep within their soul, that would normally be absorbed and condensed when they formed a divine ability.

If a Demon beast's spiritual nature was stripped away and not returned, its life-mandate would be diminished, and it would typically be unable to form a divine ability. The only exceptions were creatures like the Dragon-kin, who spontaneously condensed powerful divine abilities upon reaching maturity.

Of course, no one in the current age would dare to steal the spiritual nature of a Dragon Prince. But Spirit Beasts with abundant life-mandates, like the Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beast or the Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat, could still form divine abilities. Indeed, the ancient cultivators had called them Spirit Beasts precisely because they could attain such power and still remain under control.

Even so, their spiritual nature could only be taken before they broke through. Once it was absorbed into their divine ability, their power would surge, and no one could ever strip it away again.

Li Que'wan's ability seemed useful on the surface, but it was fraught with complications. The only Demon beasts capable of forming divine abilities were usually these Spirit Beasts of noble lineage. Giving an ordinary Demon a chance was likely a waste of resources and, more importantly, time. Demon beasts couldn't practice cultivation arts; if their bloodline was common, they could only grow their Dao-Profundity through the slow passage of years.

'Even our family's Guest Retainer, Li Wushao… we poured a fortune of Supreme Yin Moon Radiance into him to strengthen his life-mandate, but his chances of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm are still slim, and who knows how many decades it will take.'

For that reason, Li Que'wan spoke of this final ability with a hint of disappointment. But to Li Ximing, it was a revelation. He began to ponder.

'A minor wonder, she calls it… but if our family had a limitless supply of Supreme Yin resources, pushing a few Demon beasts into the Purple Mansion Realm would not be impossible. The time investment is still an issue, however…'

'Furthermore… the Mystic Tablet Edict Pill is used to seize life-mandates and command spirits, and it specifically targets Demon beasts. And since Hengzhu is of the Three Shamans and Two Rites Dao Lineage, there’s no doubt it will be useful!'

At this thought, Li Ximing could no longer contain himself. He retrieved a purple jade slip from his sleeve and pressed it into Li Que'wan’s hand.

"This," he said with utmost gravity, "is the Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method. It is a supreme incantation of transformation. Read it at once!"
