# Chapter 748: Tuoba

Xu State.

The cultivators of Azure Pond Sect had gradually gathered, while in the north, only the occasional streaks of devilish and colorful light flashed by like flying shuttles, hidden deep in thick haze, making it impossible to see clearly.

But Li Xizhi had received word that both buddhist cultivators and devil cultivators from the north were gradually arriving in Xu State. Of the Seven Daos, three had already come, and even the Yan State had sent a group of devil cultivators, all silently surveying the surroundings.

Mount Bianyan was shrouded in mist. Li Xizhi had been stationed here for several days and had learned much. He and Li Xuanfeng were both guarding the eastern flank, not too far and not too close from their Moongaze Lake.

“We are stationed in this area. Those minor buddhist and devil cultivators coming down from the south are of little consequence. The main forces we must face are two.

“The Dao of Great Desire and the Tuoba Family of devil cultivators from Yan State...”

Li Xizhi’s strength was already quite formidable; ordinary cultivators couldn’t keep him in check. Only Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from these two Immortal Sect could truly threaten his life, so he paid extra attention to them.

“The Baixiang Valley I’m heading to is often frequented by devil cultivators, and even direct descendants of the Tuoba Family have made appearances there...”

He checked the time, cultivators from the rear should be arriving soon. After landing in the formation, he watched the comings and goings of cultivators and, after a moment, found Yang Ruizao.

His brother-in-law was seated upright in the courtyard, holding a small letter in his hand, frowning deeply.

Seeing Li Xizhi approach, Yang Ruizao quickly flipped his hand to put the letter away, stepped forward, and said softly, “Xizhi... the assignments for each peak have been issued, and the cloudliners should have already arrived.”

“I wonder how things are at home...” Li Xizhi hurried to ask, and Yang Ruizao responded, “Moongaze Lake was assigned to the Moon Lake Peak of the Ning Family... Though it’s technically a return to its rightful owners, I heard the Ning Family pulled a lot of strings to force out several ambitious immortal peaks.”

As expected, it fell into the hands of Moon Lake Peak. Li Xizhi had somewhat anticipated this and instantly felt a headache coming on. He thought to himself, But the Ning Family already has their hands full with staffing Yuanxing Peak and Cave Spring Peak... and now they’ve added Moon Lake Peak on top of that... how will they have enough manpower...

The Ning Family is short on manpower. To guard all these territories... they’ll surely need to draw heavily from my family’s forces...

Li Xizhi gave it a brief thought, and quickly gained a clear grasp of the situation. It all became evident to him, Moon Lake Peak of the Ning Family got Moongaze Lake just as they wished. This must be Chi Zhiyun’s deliberate scheme... With the Ning Family short on manpower, they’ll inevitably offend my family by heavily demanding reinforcements...

If the Ning Family fails to defend the place and people die, they’ll be severely punished by the sect and secretly blame our family for not putting in enough effort. Meanwhile, if our dispatched members suffer casualties, the Ning Family will just come asking for more reinforcements. Resentment in our household will be inevitable...

He found the whole thing rather thorny as he thought, Shifting Azure Pond Sect’s internal conflict onto the families... What a troublesome move...

With Li Xijun at home, Li Xizhi wasn’t truly afraid of open conflict with Moon Lake Peak, He just needed to see how far they could compromise. After all, if the Ning Family couldn’t hold the land, his own family wouldn’t benefit either...

Li Xizhi understood this clearly and stayed silent for a moment. Yang Ruizao was still reading the letter with furrowed brows, speaking in a low voice, “As for the sect’s other territories... grievances are running high. And yet the Ning Family wants to send people here to borrow manpower from us... What kind of logic is that...”

Azure Pond Sect had divided territories among the peaks, allowing each to conscript people to head north. Initially, the command was to conscript forty to fifty percent. The peaks accepted the orders and set out by boat.

But upon arriving at the territories, they found vast stretches to defend. Except for a few peaks of major families from large commanderies, almost none had enough people. They had no choice but to increase conscription to sixty or seventy percent. Smaller families with no backing were pushed to the point of sending eighty to ninety percent of their cultivators, with some migrating entire families.

Li Xizhi was aware of these reports. He had seen much sorrow and hardship in the formations these past days. After a moment of silence, he quietly said, “The sect mainly values the Eastern Sea. Many fellow disciples are still guarding the islands there and haven’t been recalled. Naturally, there’s a shortage of manpower everywhere.”

Yang Ruizao understood what he meant and softly said, “In the past few days, many cultivators have voiced complaints, but this mountain simply must be held. If the buddhist and devil cultivators cross the Great River, they may not be able to breach Mount Azure Pond but the bloody storm will surely engulf most of Jiangnan.”

Li Xizhi nodded. He had gotten the information he needed and said simply, “I’ll head out for Baixiang Valley now. I came to say farewell.”

Yang Ruizao had been assigned elsewhere, and upon hearing this, he quickly stood up with a solemn expression and said softly, “I’ve already asked around about Baixiang Valley for you. It directly faces the Tuoba Family’s territory. That family has been orthodox devil cultivators since ancient times, and even produced a Golden Core Devil Monarch...

“Though they’ve declined terribly, even a broken ship still has iron. Be extremely careful. With your cultivation, as long as you stay cautious, you should avoid any serious harm.”

Li Xizhi had also made his own inquiries. He nodded silently, bid a peaceful farewell, and rode the wind into the skies, leaving Mount Yan behind and heading east.

After traveling a few hundred kilometers, the sky suddenly brightened, pouring glaring light across the land. Li Xizhi dimmed his rainbow light and flew over several cities to the south, slowly spotting a gorge ahead.

The gorge was filled with golden-yellow maple trees. Several escape lights drifted from north to south across the sky, and formations below glowed with light. Li Xizhi descended with a stream of Heavenly Glow, arriving just as a few devil cultivator-looking figures were snooping around the formation’s edge.

As Li Xizhi landed, his concealment techniques were superb. The group noticed nothing and continued moving through the grove below.

He simply flicked his sleeve, releasing several streams of Heavenly Glow. The glow had brilliantly colored, softly drifting through the forest, spiraling a few times before darting toward each of the men.

Those at the rear couldn’t react in time and were instantly bound tight, immobilized and tumbling to the ground. The ones in front turned back alertly, but with only Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivation, they couldn’t withstand it and fell one after another like rolling gourds.

Only the leader had mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivation. He reacted faster, drawing a dharma sword that shimmered with red light, blocking the oncoming glow with a reverse slash.

Clang!

With a crisp sound, the leading devil cultivator staggered from the impact. The rainbow light recoiled just an inch, then lunged forward again.

“What is this thing? Could it be spell art?”

This devil cultivator was from Zhao State and had spent the first half of his life dueling buddhist cultivators. He had never seen an immortal cultivator before and froze for a full breath, during which a figure stepped into view, treading on Heavenly Glow.

“Crap!”

The figure flashed before his eyes for only an instant, then his sword vanished from his hand and landed in the other’s. Just as fear struck him, his body was already tightly bound, unable to even activate his escape light.

Li Xizhi examined the dharma artifact he took. It was indeed unbearably crude, forged from blood qi and soul remnants. It emitted a faint bloody glow in his hand but had nothing worth praising.

Li Xizhi rode the Heavenly Glow to the front of the formation, the captured men still bound behind him. Using a command token to activate the formation, he saw an unbelievably small marketplace nestled in the valley. A few figures rode the wind to welcome him.

This marketplace consisted of no more than a few courtyards, it was extremely crude in appearance. The formation looked newly set, likely placed by Azure Pond Sect.

As the group reached him, they all bowed deeply. Li Xizhi examined them. One was at the mid-stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, three were early-stage, and the rest were only at the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

How pitiful.

He felt somewhat troubled as these cultivators of Baixiang Valley were so overjoyed they hadn’t slept for days, each of them eagerly addressing him as Peak Master.

The mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm old man seemed to be the overseer of Baixiang Valley. He was moved and emotional, saying, “Peak Master, sir... I’ve long heard that Jiangnan is a flourishing land of immortal cultivation. To come such a long way to aid us... I, Bai, am deeply grateful... Please accept my bow...”

Li Xizhi was momentarily stunned. After asking a few questions, he realized all of them were surnamed Bai, they were the local cultivators of Xu State. Apart from establishing a formation in Baixiang Valley, no other Azure Pond cultivators had arrived yet.

He chuckled and shook his head, letting out a breath of relief and thought, Of course... Baixiang Valley is a crucial defensive point. They wouldn’t leave just a few Qi Cultivation Realm disciples for me... I’ve just grown too wary after being schemed against by the Chi Family...

With the rest yet to arrive, Li Xizhi wasn’t in a rush to interrogate the devil cultivators. He had them clear out some rooms and waited quietly.

Just as the night passed, two escape lights flew in, one ahead and one behind.

First came a white-haired old man, neatly dressed, looking even older than Li Xuanxuan. He was in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and appeared to be about a hundred years old. This meant he was likely over two hundred by cultivator standards.

The old man cupped his hands in greeting. Right after, a middle-aged man with mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation, neatly groomed beard, stepped forward and said loudly, “I am Quan Yi of Linghe Peak. Greetings to you both, fellow Daoists.”

The old man followed with a hoarse voice, “Yu Yuwei of Panqi Peak. I have three disciples, they will arrive one by one in the coming days.”

Li Xizhi didn’t know Quan Yi well, but he did recognize the Yu Family and Panqi Peak. He nodded and smiled, “Changtian Peak, Li Xizhi.”

After exchanging names, Li Xizhi pointed to the devil cultivators on the ground and said, “Two seniors, I arrived a bit earlier and happened to run into this group of devil cultivators skulking around. I brought them back on the way.”

Quan Yi gave a small smile and said, “I know a few spell arts that are just right for interrogation.”

He conjured a pale blue flame, pressed it to the captive’s forehead, and began questioning in a low voice. After about five minutes, he said in disappointment, “Just a petty scavenger trying to take advantage of the chaos! They are not from the Tuoba Family.”

As he withdrew and stood up, the man before him slumped to the ground in a daze. The surrounding devil cultivators looked increasingly terrified, but they were still sealed by Heavenly Glow and unable to move.

Li Xizhi, ever thorough, casually picked up the devil cultivator’s storage pouch. After rummaging through it, he found nothing more than some blood qi, tattered clothing, and a few worn-out cultivation manuals.

Inside the clothing was a hidden letter. He opened it in front of the two others but it was nothing more than a family letter with handwriting that were blurred and aged.

Quan Yi turned away in disappointment. The three of them clearly understood where the true threat in this region lay. Yu Yuwei gently shook his head and stroked his beard, saying, “Fellow Daoist... if these were truly spies from the Tuoba Family, they would never leave behind anything incriminating. The Tuoba are extremely skilled in manipulating souls, it’s difficult to detect. Even though Azure Pond Sect’s techniques are excellent, I fear we still fall short of their level.”

These words didn’t give Quan Yi much face, but he didn’t mind. He nodded, seemingly enlightened, and casually slapped the captives to death.

The captives let out a brief gasp of terror before their lives were snuffed out. Only then did he smile and say, “I was too rash. Senior, you’re well-experienced, having served as peak master for many years and coming from an esteemed family, could you explain a bit more about the Tuoba Family?”

Yu Yuwei nodded slightly and said, “The Tuoba Family has a grand background. Though they are now in decline, they were once a first-class great family... Are you aware of how Northern Qi replaced Wei, and then Great Liang destroyed Qi?”

Both nodded. When Yu Yuwei mentioned the rise of Northern Qi over Wei, Quan Yi cast a subtle glance at Li Xizhi. Yu Yuwei continued softly, “Emperor Taiwu of Liang was surnamed Tuoba, with given name Xuantan.”

“So they were once the imperial family of the Northern Dynasties,” muttered Quan Yi as his expression grew increasingly grim, he was clearly shaken by the name. Li Xizhi hadn’t expected the Tuoba background to be this deep either and fell into silent thought. Yu Yuwei continued softly, “Later, the Emperor of Liang perished, and the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch died as well. Great Liang reached its peak and then fell hard.

“With Great Liang’s territory shattered, the Tuoba Family suffered heavy losses. Only by relying on the Shengle Heaven did they recover slowly over the years. Now, they have reestablished themselves in Yan State.”

“They even have a grotto heaven!” Quan Yi looked at the two with a complicated expression, calculating with his fingers before speaking in a low voice, “With the three of us, plus senior’s three disciples, if the Tuoba Family sends just one person, we might be able to fend them off. But if three or five come... resisting would be pointless. Better to face punishment than lose our lives...”

Yu Yuwei laughed heartily and patted him on the shoulder, saying, “Fellow Daoist, you worry too much! So many years have passed... The Tuoba Family is no longer what it once was. Even if they have a few prodigies left, they wouldn’t send them to a place like this...

“If just hearing a surname is enough to shake us, then there are countless more people surnamed Li, Fuqi, Tuoba... than Xie or Wang...”

Quan Yi merely waved his hand and nodded in reply, “What you say is true, Senior... but my heart still feels uneasy.”

His mood never picked up. After a few perfunctory words, he found a side room to rest. With two calls, the family head–looking elder of Baixiang Valley hurriedly offered up his own cave dwelling.

The old man, however, took the opportunity to slowly approach Li Xizhi. Yu Yuwei asked, “Fellow Daoist Xizhi, are you from the Li Family of Moongaze Lake?”

Seeing Li Xizhi nod, Yu Yuwei smiled and said, “What a coincidence.”

Li Xizhi looked slightly puzzled, then saw the old man continue leisurely, “Back in the day... the Yu and Ning Families were quite close. Some from the Ning Family cultivated on Panqi Peak. By seniority, one of them was my martial uncle.

“Later, when the position of Moon Lake Peak master became vacant, my uncle took the seat. While cultivating over the lake, flying by on the wind, he once saw a woman at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. She was very beautiful.”

He chuckled and continued, “He was quite the romantic, and quickly fell in love with her. They spent a passionate night, and he couldn’t let her go, so he brought her back to the sect. It was quite the scandal. There were many nights of indulgence and much gossip.

“In the end, the woman’s talent was too poor and she died young. Before her death, she entrusted her family to him. My uncle agreed, but after he died, Moon Lake Peak saw it as a scandal and barely took care of her brother.”

Yu Yuwei looked up, as if reminiscing, and murmured, “I believe his name was... Lu Sisi, wasn’t it? Have you heard of him, Daoist?”

Li Xizhi fell silent and said softly, “I’ve heard the name...”
