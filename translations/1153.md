# Chapter 1161: Resonance

A torrent of Baleful Qi cascaded from the heavens. Amidst the gloom, the long halberd stood like a solitary, brilliant sun, impervious. Rose-hued light and plumes of baleful fire surged past it, unable to draw even an inch closer.

Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes swept across the sky like lightning. Through rising veils of Profound Qi and shifting curtains of Valley Water light, he identified one face after another.

Before Helian Wujiang, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and the early-stage Helian Wumeng stood Situ Huo, wielding a crimson-gold blade. Both Helian cultivators were wreathed in Baleful Qi. Not far from them, the two Purple Qi cultivators, Tinglan and Wenqing, darted forward to shield Murong Yan, painting the sky in shades of black and purple.

Sima Yuanli, perched atop a green gourd, used the Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch to force back the Maha Zhelu. As waves of Valley Water rolled forth, Ning Wan had already ensnared Nuzi of the Way of Great Desire. Lin Chensheng’s expression was grim, his gaze fixed on the clasped hands of Mingxiang as if facing a mortal foe.

Below, on the surface of the lake, one Holder of the Profound after another revealed themselves. The three scions of Bright Yang led the charge with fire, while newly advanced Holders of the Profound like Chen Wenyao and Sima Xunhui followed behind with their treasured artifacts. Sheets of fire and water rained down, riddling the compassionate Buddhist radiance with gaping holes.

‘I can’t tell what’s happening on the lake, but Shanji… Shilou Yingge should be holding the line!’

He watched in silence as Touba Ci landed beside Zhelu. He stared at Li Zhouwei from afar, his gaze complex. The arcane platform in his hand shone with a dazzling light—it was unmistakably the Spiritual Treasure suffused with Dawn Qi.

The waters of Lake Xian were already in turmoil. Suppressed by the weight of countless divine abilities, the lake’s surface receded in terror, exposing vast, shattered tracts of the lakebed. The shore crumbled at an alarming rate while the mouth of the river connecting it to the sea widened. The lake was on the verge of collapsing into the ocean!

The divine abilities crackling through the heavens hung in a tense, eerie stalemate.

‘If this battle breaks out, Lake Xian will be shattered, the very earth will sink, and the sea will pour inland. Sword Gate, Shanji, and Xuanmiao Temple will become nothing but broken islands!’

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze, waiting.

Then, in a flash, the water that had been crushed to the lakebed, even forced back into the subterranean veins, suddenly broke free. It surged upward with a deafening roar. Every inch of soil began to glow with a profound light, as if forged from pure steel.

The divine abilities illuminating the sky flared as one, and their wielders attacked in unison!

“BOOM!”

The first to scream was the Great Void itself.

Every divine ability pulsed with power, each claiming its own distinct territory in the sky. The Great Void fractured under the strain, splintering into a canvas of voids large and small.

A ray of golden light shot forth.

“Dong!”

The Supreme Yang radiance surrounding Zhelu had not yet fully dissipated when he felt something golden shatter before him. It was as if a dyer’s workshop had been overturned; a kaleidoscope of phantasmal colors exploded in his vision, leaving his eyes aching and sore. He was secretly horrified.

‘The Pure Yang Bracelets!’

Pitch-black darkness consumed the sky as King Wei leaped into the air. His golden halberd, like a sliver of solid gold clutched in his hand, descended with majestic force. The Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions was too far to intervene, but a figure in feathered robes appeared, fingers flashing through hand seals to summon the immense Profound Seal of Great Liang!

Li Zhouwei’s long halberd vibrated, a dense power gathering within its length, yet it emitted no light. Instead, the air lit up with the magnificent rivers and mountains of the Huai River Map!

The Touba clan’s treasured seal was renowned throughout the lands. Now, having gathered its power for so long, it was not something a single divine ability could withstand. But as the Spiritual Treasure came to life, it transformed into a radiant golden pass weaving through layers of crags and peaks. It intercepted the descending seal and bathed Li Zhouwei in a brilliant radiance.

The divine ability, Radiant Surge!

As a Spiritual Treasure, the Huai River Map possessed limitless power, and its first layer was the Radiant Surge!

This ability could only be activated by a Bright Yang cultivator. It resonated with the three Bright Yang divine abilities within Li Zhouwei, reinforcing his life-mandate and amplifying his dharma power. In fact, it conjured three Celestial Gates behind him!

The Celestial Gates, each a Radiant Pass, overlapped one another, their centers a hazy blur. They projected their light downward, straight toward Zhelu. The Maha, still reeling from the Pure Yang Bracelets, had no control over his body and no time to react. He took the full force of the blast.

He felt as though a great hammer had struck his face, leaving him paralyzed. The darkness blanketing the sky vanished in an instant. Li Zhouwei’s gaze was placid as his long halberd swept forward, arriving before Zhelu in a heartbeat.

Touba Ci’s expression shifted. He took a step forward, his eyes blazing with the color of Profound Yellow Qi as he unleashed his divine ability.

“Calamity of the Shrouded Sky!”

Li Zhouwei felt a chain of golden rings slam down before his eyes. A devastating power flooded his mind, only to be neutralized by a cool sensation as Profound Qi surged from his limbs.

His Sovereign's Perilous Tread, active during a charge, should have possessed the power to dispel such effects. But the divine ability of Profound Qi was endlessly variable. As Touba Ci’s fingers flew through a new seal, it unexpectedly resonated with the divine ability Substituted Hindrance, causing the power of Dawn Qi to manifest both inside and outside Li Zhouwei’s Dharma Body.

But Li Zhouwei was unmoved.

“Illuminating Sun and Moon!”

His absolute control over his Dharma Body, a product of his life-mandate being anchored in a single spiritual mansion, caused the erupting Dawn Qi to stagnate. The golden patterns of his Sovereign's Perilous Tread, however, flared brightly in response to being besieged. The tip of his halberd was already at Zhelu’s throat, while his other hand drew a golden axe.

Zhelu was truly a Maha of long-standing fame. The Pure Yang Bracelets had been charged for some time, and he could not break free in that brief moment. But thousands of his rose-colored eyes reacted in unison, flashing before him to form a white lotus as bright as a star.

Each of his thousand eyes possessed its own spiritual essence, entirely independent of his soul!

“BOOM!”

The long halberd slammed against the lotus, exploding in a shower of cyan and white light. The Maha, lost in the dazzling colors, was violently jolted back to awareness.

Zhelu had long since mastered various life-saving Dharma Arts, and this was one of his greatest trump cards. This wondrous lotus, formed from his eyes, had been crafted using a spiritual item of Manifestations Earth. The moment it shattered, it would, in turn, awaken him.

He didn't hesitate. A burst of pink light erupted as he shot several dozen zhang away, his face etched with lingering fear. He immediately reached out with his life-mandate, attempting to connect to the Buddhist Land.

Even with the Buddhist Land of the Way of Emptiness in decline, as a Maha, Zhelu could still borrow immense dharma power and divine abilities from it.

But his spiritual sense was met with emptiness. Darkness stretched out in every direction. He could only vaguely discern a nether palace of Exiled Qi, locked away in some unseen, abyssal place.

‘Exiled Qi!’

His expression changed drastically. His hands flew into a seal, preparing to summon a golden mountain.

But that short delay was all it took. The sky was already dark. King Wei’s gaze was glacial as he charged, halberd and golden axe in hand, his Campaign Cloak billowing behind him. He held two fingers before him, and a bright flame the size of a bean leaped into existence.

The Dawn Qi fire within his Dharma Body was unleashed, erupting with maximum force. He coughed up a spray of golden blood that fell directly onto the flame.

Southern Emperor's Profound Snare.

Instantly, Li-Light materialized, like rays of golden sun precipitating from clouds, and descended upon Zhelu’s Dharma Body.

Zhelu had faced this Dharma Art before and had a sense of what was coming. He never expected that what fell was not a net of golden light, but a surging wave of Li-Light that resembled a living flame.

The Li-Light was fire, yet not fire. It was more like a flickering ember, but its color was terrifying. It bored viciously toward his forehead.

Zhelu scented mortal danger. The color in the depths of his eyes shifted, his face a mask of terror. The thousands of eyes on his body swiveled in unison, casting a hazy purple light to try and hold the attack in place.

But this Bright Yang Li-Light was like a skiff in a tempest; no matter how the waves crashed, it could not be overturned. The purple light he had cultivated for years was utterly useless, allowing the attack to descend like a coiling dragon.

‘Ah?!’

The horror on his face instantly seeped into his very soul.

‘This is… Sovereign's Perilous Tread?!’

But his thoughts were swiftly extinguished. Pinpricks of Li-Light landed first on his golden forehead, then shot downward with terrifying speed and burrowed deep into his Dharma Body.

“BOOM!”

A colossal storm of Li Fire, wreathed in the Heavenly Light of Bright Yang, erupted across the sky. The terrifying blast caused nearly every cultivator to turn their heads, their hearts seized with shock.

‘How many exchanges has it even been?!’

When Li Zhouwei had first chosen this art, he had prized its affinity for life-mandate resonance. It could trap and kill, and its resource requirements were remarkably low. Furthermore, his own life-mandate was unique, and the two were mutually reinforcing.

In Li Zhouwei’s hands, the art bloomed with an entirely different splendor.

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, absorbed into his glabella, amplified his power. The Huai River Map strengthened his life-mandate. And most importantly, under the pressure of the siege, he had already resonated with the fate of the White Qilin!

If Li Jiangqian’s Talisman Qi art, Greedy Snare of Profound Li, was the result of greatly amplifying life-mandate resonance, then Li Zhouwei, by channeling the fate of the White Qilin, had boosted the power of his art from its very foundation. He had crossed the profound threshold and truly mastered the art, achieving its second stage: the murderous Li-Light!

This was precisely why he had chosen to charge while activating the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare! The Li-Light was an extension of his own life-mandate. With his advanced Dao-Profundity, forcing out his own essence blood forged an even deeper connection. And since he was already charging forward, the power of his Sovereign's Perilous Tread was layered directly onto the technique.

This was how he had caught Zhelu off guard.

As the wisp of Li-Light detonated, the Maha’s head was vaporized into dust. His empty neck was a ruin of shredded flesh from which flickered strings of brilliant Li Fire. Horrifying trails of Li Fire streamed down his golden body, searing molten, golden-red wounds into its surface.

The thousand eyes that had always been open now squeezed shut, weeping tears of light.

Li Zhouwei had only resonated with forty percent of the White Qilin’s fate, but the Li-Light strike had been completely unexpected, and for the first time, Zhelu’s very foundation was shaken.

Though the tremendous drain of the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare left Li Zhouwei’s face pale, the King of Wei was far from done. He rode the momentum of his Sovereign's Perilous Tread forward. The divine ability of his Crimson Severing Arrowhead moved with a profound weight, yet he was as nimble as one riding an immortal chariot, effortlessly dodging the descending Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform.

He drew his thick, dark-gold halberd. The qilin patterns on its surface seemed to leap to life as his killing intent flared.

It all happened in the blink of an eye. Only now did the phantasmal light of Bright Yang finally register in Touba Ci’s pupils. The heart of this descendant of Great Liang grew heavy. For the first time, he felt utterly powerless.

The Bright Yang path favored the exalted and disdained the lowly. This hadn’t been obvious when Li Zhouwei possessed only one or two divine abilities, nor was it so terrifying when he had just broken through to three. But now, wielding an array of Spiritual Treasures and Spiritual Artifacts, Touba Ci finally understood the oppressive suppression wielded by a high-ranking Bright Yang cultivator. For the first time, he felt a profound sense of defeat at the hands of a fellow mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

‘Give a Bright Yang cultivator the slightest advantage, and the situation becomes an avalanche!’

Touba Ci was lost in a daze for a moment.

‘The Bright Yang favors the Qilin. How can a mere mortal ever hope to compare?’

Seeing King Wei’s bright halberd, Zhelu’s headless body began to tremble violently. But the searing Li-Light still coursed through him, paralyzing his thousand eyes.

The Southern Emperor's Profound Snare was not just an art of slaughter, but also one of subjugation!

At this critical juncture, a length of purple silk shot through the air. It coiled around Zhelu’s waist and, with a sharp tug, pulled the Maha away.

Li Zhouwei’s reaction seemed even faster. The instant he saw the purple silk, the emblem on his glabella flared.

The Sun-Surging sigil grew incredibly complex. Its outer ring darkened, its inner profound patterns spun, and four points of golden light separated from it, forming an inverted constellation with the Upper Shining Star below and the Yang Extremity Star above.

The Apex of the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!

Just as the four glittering golden stars rose, a slender, silver baton struck the surface of a drum.

“Dong!”

Brilliant silver light exploded, streaking across the sky and shattering the four nascent stars. In the very next instant, it struck the spot where Li Zhouwei had just been, unleashing a thunderous storm that swept out in all directions.

The Profound Thunder was savage, imbued with the majestic might of the heavens. The faces of the assembled experts changed. The uncle and nephew duo of Helian Wujiang, who commanded the baleful winds, were especially horrified and scrambled to retreat. On the edge of the battlefield, Sima Yuanli was locked in a fierce contest of strength with Bashan; neither could dodge in time. They were sent flying, both coughing up blood.

The power of a single drumbeat was immense!

With his Spirit Probe active, Li Zhouwei reacted with incredible speed, avoiding the epicenter of the blast. He was knocked from the air, wreathed in silver light, and spat out a mouthful of crackling lightning.

As expected, a shimmering golden light emerged and bound him in place.

A youth appeared beside him, cold and aloof. He wore a tall crown and a robe of black clouds embroidered with profound patterns, his lips crimson and his features sharp.

Qi Lanyan!

The youth’s movements were swift and agile. He held a sword in one hand. It was about four chi long, plain and unadorned, with a simple, ancient design. It was a sword technique, and a red ribbon tied to its pommel fluttered in the electric air. An obscure incantation condensed around it.

“By the august position of Zhengxing Palace, I call upon water and fire, and channel them through Dui Metal.”

Droplets of water and fire dripped from the sword. A wave of Dui Metal energy surged forth, at its center a point of pure light as unyielding as metal. It shot toward Li Zhouwei’s glabella.

Before the light even arrived, a piercing sense of danger washed over him. Li Zhouwei’s pupils became pure gold as his gaze met Qi Lanyan’s.

Both were perfectly calm.

‘There is nothing left but to fight!’

His black robes suddenly blazed with light. Elegant yet imposing armor materialized over it, every golden pattern flaring at once.

“Primal Molt!”

A brilliant Yang Extremity light flared. The moment it pulsed across his armor, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing sigil on his glabella lit up in unison. Mutually amplified, they shattered the golden light binding him, and he vanished.

Qi Lanyan, however, was unperturbed. With a slight tremor of his other hand, the profound drum sounded again.

This peal was not as loud as the last, but it condensed into a bolt of tangible lightning that streaked after him. Li Zhouwei had just reappeared a short distance away when the lightning was upon him, seeking to bind him once more.

‘What a formidable Spiritual Treasure!’

Li Zhouwei seized the brief moment of respite. His eyes lit up, and a torrent of black flame erupted. The Celestial Gate appeared from thin air, descending from the heavens to meet the lightning and smash down upon Qi Lanyan!

“BOOM!”

The silver-white lightning detonated. Qi Lanyan’s footwork was a blur of profound, unpredictable steps—he was clearly prepared. With a flick of his sleeve, he produced a piece of white porcelain. Dawn Qi gushed from it, shining toward the Celestial Gate.

He coldly brandished his sword. As he raised it into the air and prepared to chant, an autumn wind brushed his face, and for a moment, it seemed as if crystalline motes were drifting past his eyes.

Qi Lanyan’s expression changed slightly.

“Drip.”

A single drop of autumn dew materialized from nothing, landing on the spine of his blade and sending out a ripple of cold.

The successor of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao felt a jolt in his heart. He silently gripped the jade talisman hidden in his sleeve and slowly raised his head. He found the world blanketed in black clouds. Not far off in the darkness, there was a glimmer of autumnal white.

It was the light of a sword.

And behind that light was a pair of bright white, sword-like pupils—a pair of long, sharp eyes, frigid and sharp enough to pierce him through.
