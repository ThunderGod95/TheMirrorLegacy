# Chapter 939: Disciple-Brother

Heaven-Probing Pavilion.

A commotion stirred within the pavilion. Windchimes hanging by the racks tinkled, mixed with the sounds of a scuffle. First came the clang of swords, then a surge of azure clouds, twisting and colliding with a whistling gale.

In the center of the tower, a man in silver robes and a red cloak sat in meditation. His hands formed a seal over his Dantian as he quietly regulated his breath. Hearing the wind rise, he lifted his handsome, rounded face and asked:

"What is all that noise?"

A voice called from outside the door:

"The disciple-brothers are just sparring for fun outside!"

Quan Yuduan smiled and hopped down from his seat. Pushing the door open, he laughed, "Master went to the Eastern Sea for secluded cultivation, and now they decide to raise a racket! So early in the morning, too. They’re disturbing my cultivation!"

The moment the tower door opened, he saw a cultivator in black robes sitting on the steps of the hall. Hearing the door, the man turned, shook out his robes, and stood. He spoke with a hint of resignation:

"These days, one of them is in the north, the other in the south, and they’re always running off to the Eastern Sea. It's been a long time since they last met... They have to fight to find out if they've made any progress or if their cultivation has regressed."

"True enough!"

Quan Yuduan laughed heartily and walked out of the courtyard, crossing the steps in two strides. "Uncle Wushao, it's rare to see you! How has Zhouluo been these past two years?"

Li Wushao folded his arms, a rare smile touching his lips. "Just cultivating, what else? Yunqing needed a suitable spell technique, and I needed to train my movement techniques, so I came to the Heaven-Probing Pavilion... After all, this place has a vast collection. Your Master has accumulated a mountain of merit, and with his status as an Azure Pond Guest Elder, we might as well take advantage of it."

In the years Li Wushao had followed Li Xizhi, he had reaped enormous benefits. Whether it was spiritual items or the spirit pills casually tossed his way, these were things an ordinary Demon beast might not gather in one or two hundred years. Silently, his foundation had become incredibly robust, and he had reached the Peak Foundation Establishment Realm.

Furthermore, the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance he received long ago, combined with numerous spiritual items, had been converted by the Six Dams Matched Life Method into the marvels of the Azure Manifestation Dao to nourish him. Through multiple refinements, his bloodline had grown increasingly pure. It wasn't obvious in the early years, but now, as his cultivation base neared completion, his formidability was becoming more and more apparent.

He rarely took action, however, having spent all these years silently protecting Li Xizhi's descendants. Although Quan Yuduan could sense his profound dharma power, he didn't know Li Wushao's true strength. He pondered inwardly:

'Uncle Wushao may have humble origins, but looking at him now, I fear even an average disciple of the Azure Pond Sect wouldn't be his match...'

For a Demon beast, this was already an extremely high evaluation. To be able to challenge a disciple from an Immortal Sect without being from a noble bloodline... such Demon beasts were likely few and far between, even in Jiangnan.

Looking into the courtyard, he saw Zhao Junwei, cold steel in hand, locked in a fierce battle with his Little Disciple-Brother, Si Xunhui. Sword light and spell arts intertwined, causing the courtyard to flicker between light and shadow.

Although Quan Yuduan was the Eldest Disciple-Brother, his mental fortitude couldn't compare to Zhao Junwei's, and his background was leagues behind that of Si Xunhui. Witnessing the sword techniques and Dao-Profundity of the two, he felt a wave of shame and lowered his head in silence.

Zhao Junwei's disposition and willpower had earned Li Xizhi's greatest approval, but Si Xunhui's own fortitude was not lacking. He was equally hardworking, and with the backing of his aristocratic clan, it was naturally more than Zhao Junwei could match. After fighting for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Zhao Junwei was defeated. He sighed:

"Little Disciple-Brother, your spell arts... they truly live up to Master's reputation!"

Si Xunhui quickly pulled back, shaking his head. "I can't possibly compare to Master! At my cultivation level... he was already fighting for his life on the river, his talent still unknown to the world... _That_ is the true path of concealing one's strength and protecting one's destiny."

The disciple-brothers sat in the hall, chatting eagerly. Zhao Junwei chose to speak of matters in the Eastern Sea. "I just returned from the Crimson Reef Island area, and I heard something unusual. The people from Crimson Reef Island and Thunder-Hearing Island got into a massive, earth-shaking fight over some treasure. They battled until the Dragon-kin intervened to mediate. Nobody knows who ended up with the prize... but... it seems an important direct-lineage member from Thunder-Hearing Island died in that battle... In any case, all pretenses are gone now."

Neither of those families was any good, so the two listened to the news with simple amusement, thinking it a good thing. Quan Yuduan, however, motioned for them to look at him, his expression serious.

"I have some news of my own."

Both looked over. Quan Yuduan lowered his voice. "Do you still remember the Qingsui Peak Master?"

"Of course!"

Si Xunhui was less familiar with him, but Quan Yuduan and Zhao Junwei could never forget the name Yuan Chengzhao. How could they forget this Martial Uncle who had repeatedly tried to harm their Master? Quan Yuduan sneered.

"We all saw him go silent these past few years, not emerging from his seclusion for days on end. Even when the Yuan Clan fell into chaos, it didn't stir him... But a few days ago, Qin Xian seemed to get wind of something. He sent people to adjust the formation and discovered that the cave-abode hadn't been accessed in years... Even the cultivation resources sent over were untouched."

"Oh?"

Their expressions shifted slightly. Quan Yuduan continued his cold laugh, "Qin Xian was worried something had happened to him, so he ordered the manor door forced open. But they found it completely empty!"

"It seems he sealed his manor in secret and slipped away to roam the world at some unknown time!"

This was significant. With Si Boxiu dead, Yuan Chengzhao naturally had reason to be afraid. Even if Li Xizhi said the matter was settled, how could someone who had offended an Immortal Clan ever feel at ease?

Li Wushao, who had been listening, revealed a sarcastic smile and turned away, thinking to himself:

'With Qin Xian and the others watching, the Si Clan had to save some face. They couldn't just discard him after he'd served his purpose. So, they gave him an early chance to get out. As for his ultimate fate... Si Tongyi doesn't have the nerve for that. He most likely just let him go, to fend for himself!'

Li Wushao turned back, preparing to go select his movement techniques. But just then, the quiet discussion of the disciple-brothers drifted over on the breeze, flowing past him.

"Have you two disciple-brothers heard... at the Pristine Merging Owl Pool... there seems to be some... movement!"

This sentence struck Li Wushao like a bolt. The foot he had been lifting over the threshold froze. After a moment's hesitation, he stepped inside, stopping in front of the rows of shelves.

But he didn't close the door, and the disciple-brothers' voices still floated faintly to his ears:

"Eldest Disciple-Brother, your news is always timely... I live overseas, so I don't know the details... What kind of movement?"

Then came the clear, deliberately hushed voice of the youngest, Si Xunhui:

"I heard from my clan's elders... It seems a Great Daoist Master has returned."

The words hit Li Wushao like a peal of thunder, nearly making him lose his composure.

'A Great Daoist Master?!'

'An elder... which elder does the Si Clan even have left?'

"Daoist Master Suiguan!"

Quan Yuduan's shocked voice echoed Li Wushao's inner thoughts. The name clearly struck fear into all of them. This Daoist Master Suiguan had emerged from a Grotto-Heaven, rumored to possess an inhuman demeanor. Forget the people of today; even the Chi Clan of old had regarded him with both suspicion and fear!

The pavilion fell utterly silent. The three disciple-brothers sat clustered around the table. Zhao Junwei sighed and refilled their cups. Quan Yuduan's expression was complicated. "It's him..."

He turned his head slightly, seeming oppressed. "I only heard... that Daoist Master Qiuhu summoned Lin Wuning and Qin Xian... The two showed no change in expression when they came out... I just heard they are reallocating manpower, shrinking the scale of several markets, and increasing the tributes. I didn't hear anything more... Little Disciple-Brother's information is truly formidable."

It wasn't just the two of them; Si Xunhui's own expression was grim.

The Azure Pond Sect was indeed in a troubled era and badly needed someone at the Purple Mansion Realm. Having a Great Daoist Master for backing was naturally a good thing, but Suiguan was no ordinary person! Not only did he have a deep relationship with True Monarch Lushui, but his appearance was ageless, and his divine ability was perfected.

Forget the current Ning Wan... even if Si Boxiu were resurrected, he would have to bow his head obediently before such a figure. And now, Ning Wan had said nothing, nor given any instructions... The implications were terrifying to consider.

Seeing the other two speechless, Si Xunhui spoke in a low tone, "According to the ancient rules of the Azure Pond Sect, all Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who achieve the Dao must walk through the Pristine Speech Heaven once..."

He hesitated for a long time before finally sighing. "And suspended within this Pristine Speech Heaven is an object called the 'Pristine Terrace Heart-Awakening Sword'. For any Purple Mansion cultivator who enters the Grotto-Heaven, this sword will hang above their Shengyang Acupoint and leave a sword imprint within their Shengyang Acupoint Manor."

"This object is mysterious and unfathomable. It is still debated whether it is the Lord's divine ability or some kind of Dharma Treasure..."

He continued, "However... my ancestors always regarded it as a Dharma Treasure. In today's terms, it would be a Golden Core Dharma Treasure, but in ancient times, it was classified as a 'Rank Designation'. Because it originates from the Pristine Water Dao, it is called a 'Pristine Water Rank Designation'."

His Si Clan was an ancient lineage and knew far more than the other two. He spoke with a solemn expression, capturing their full attention. "As for the function of this imprint, others do not know. It is only said that it can protect the soul and prevent others from performing a soul-search. For all these years, Chi Wei, the Three Yuans... all of them have entered..."

Quan Yuduan was silent for a moment before whispering, "I had only ever heard of the Golden Bridge Lock! I never knew of a Heart-Awakening Sword."

Si Xunhui sighed to himself. After this discussion, he felt he had said too much. Feeling uneasy, he quickly tried to cover his tracks, "How could we have known? That genius in the Pristine Speech Heaven is the subject of much envy, and not without reason."

He stopped abruptly and changed the subject, turning back to Quan Yuduan. "Shrinking the market scale and increasing the tributes... what kind of arrangement is that?"

Quan Yuduan shook his head slightly. "I only know about the area I'm responsible for. According to the arrangements from above, for the next six months, the budget and manpower for maintaining the markets, harvesting spiritual items, and ensuring stability within the prefecture will be cut in half. And it might be reduced further in the future..."

"The sect has suffered heavy losses over the years, and our numbers were already low. Now, looking at the new arrangements, the requirements for recruiting disciples have been raised again... Not only will we fail to fill the quotas for each peak, I'm afraid we'll end up with even fewer people!"

Si Xunhui silently committed this to memory. His gaze shifted naturally past Quan Yuduan to the open doorway of the pavilion, where numerous jade talismans tinkled in the wind. He lowered his head and sipped his tea.

... The Northern Shore.

Flurries of lingering snow drifted down, mixing with the moonlight on the steps. The main hall atop Cold Cloud Peak was brightly lit. A man in fine-scaled armor, seated in the main seat, slowly opened his eyes.

Li Zhouwei had been cultivating on the Northern Shore for some time, focusing on the Profound Vastness Art. Normally, this art progressed faster in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. However, the Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia had only just left. Unlike others, his situation was precarious. Coupled with the constant changes in the north, he decided to forgo that small advantage and cultivate here instead.

At this moment, his practice of the art concluded. He parted his lips slightly, and a plume of white qi surged from his breath. It morphed into various shapes in the air before being struck by the cold, dissipating without a trace.

'The Profound Vastness Art is difficult, but not so difficult as to be impossible. Now that I can form this plume of white qi, I have officially crossed the threshold!'

He sent his spiritual sense moving, elevating it to the Great Void. Closing his eyes, he looked inward and saw strands of pure, snow-white qi circling his Shengyang Acupoint Manor, supporting it like a cluster of stars orbiting a moon.

This was the "Vastness Pure Qi" produced by the Profound Vastness Art, which could heal the body. He had only formed one portion so far. At his current Dao-Profundity, he could gather three portions at most, with each one taking about a year to form.

The prerequisite for gathering the "Vastness Pure Qi" was a "flawless" body—that is, one free of injury. It didn't require his constant attention like active cultivation. Once the art was mastered, the qi would accumulate automatically. The speed of this accumulation was related to his Dao-Profundity; Pure Qi was naturally the best, followed by the "Twelve Qis".

Bright Yang wasn't the fastest, but it was sufficient. Li Zhouwei silently estimated that three portions might be useful for an ordinary cultivator, but for him, it was a trivial amount, barely enough to heal a minor wound.

'In any case, it accumulates on its own. I just need to cultivate the art and let it be. The sooner I master it, the more time it has to build up. The deeper my comprehension of this cultivation method, the greater its eventual effect.'

He walked out of the hall and saw a robust, white-haired old man approaching from the side. The man bowed and said in a gruff voice, "This subordinate has returned from the Northern Foothills with a reply. The masters of Mount Dali are in seclusion. Although I met several Demon Generals, the date their lords will emerge is unknown. According to Fellow Daoist Lu, it will likely not be a short wait."

The last time the Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia appeared in Lijing Town, a four-eared man in white had appeared. Li Zhouwei had inferred at the time that this must be the Fox Clan expert from Mount Dali with even greater divine abilities. Although the Northern Foothills had always been Fox Clan territory, and it was only proper for them to investigate the appearance of a Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia, Li Zhouwei felt—connecting this to the earlier words of the Demon King Qingyu Qian—that part of the reason was for his sake. Naturally, he had to go and offer his thanks.

'But having a connection is one thing. The Fox Clan will absolutely not get involved in this matter! If I go to pay a visit right after the Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia leaves, the timing will be far too sensitive!'

Therefore, he had dispatched the White Ape to test the waters, under the guise of visiting a friend. As expected, they had long since entered seclusion and would see no one. He understood their position clearly.

"I understand..."

Li Zhouwei was not surprised. He dismissed the White Ape and, stepping into the Great Void, began to ponder. He withdrew a jade slip from his sleeve.

The Great River and Grand Mound Scripture!

The seal on it was now broken. It was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method from the Vast Ocean Daoist Tradition, a full fifth-grade art. It was surely the ultimate legacy of the Chen Clan of Ning State! It also came with various movement techniques and spell arts, all quite profound. Unfortunately, its elemental affinity did not match his.

'Daoist Master Xiao is widely known to cultivate Pit Water. My family has always had ties with the Xiao Clan. I must give him a copy of this. It's just... it's inconvenient for me to go. My Grand-uncle has interacted with him several times. It's best to strike while the iron is hot and have my Grand-uncle make the trip... He is the best person to deliver it.'

But he had only just stepped into the Great Void when his expression suddenly changed. In the physical world, the very earth began to shake, forcing him to step back onto the lake's surface. His golden pupils snapped toward the southeast.

There, the southeastern sky was filled with roiling qi. Thunder boomed, and the wails of ghosts and howls of wolves echoed through the air. A purple rain began to fall from the heavens as Spiritual Qi surged violently, throwing the surrounding spiritual energies into chaos.

'Someone failed their breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm!'

Li Zhouwei knew with a single glance that this person's foundation had been extremely deep. They had likely reached the final step but unexpectedly failed to cross the threshold, perishing in the attempt.

Amidst the falling rain, a mountainous phenomenon of white, wave-like qi was surging into the sky. It was visible from afar, shattering the thick rain clouds as it stood tall above the cloud layer.

The dawn was just beginning to break, casting a golden-yellow hue upon this mountain of clouds.

'Such a vast expanse of purple rain and white peaks! I'm afraid half of Yue State can see this!'

But before he could even marvel at the sight, a massive, pitch-black object suddenly appeared within the misty purple rain, rising slowly but surely.

Pavilions, towers, and halls were all present on this behemoth. Snow-covered pines and cypresses stood tall, winding paths were visible, and cultivators in feathered robes could be seen circling it. It was a scene of bustling activity.

A cry carried from the distance: "A mountain?! What a massive mountain!"

A majestic mountain peak had actually taken to the sky, riding the momentum of the failed breakthrough.

_RUMBLE!_

Only then did Li Zhouwei understand the source of the earlier earthquake.

'Someone is moving a mountain!'

Looking into the distance, countless cultivators flew up from the ground like ants, staring, dumbfounded, at the unprecedentedly massive peak in the sky.

The white qi in the clouds, however, seemed to have spotted something incredibly enticing. It poured down from the sky, attaching itself to the mountain peak and holding the entire structure aloft!

The wind and rain had now stopped. Specks of dirt could be seen falling from afar. The mountain hovered in the air for a brief moment, then, supported by the white qi, it drifted away, vanishing into the heavy layers of mist.

Li Zhouwei stared at the peak ascending into the heavens, his pupils narrowing. A name slowly surfaced in his mind:

"Mount Xianyou!"
