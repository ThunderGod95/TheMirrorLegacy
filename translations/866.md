# Chapter 866: Return to the Mountain

"Five-Eyed! What in the world are you doing!"

Chiluo could have never imagined this. The Merciful One before him, whose back shimmered with hands like a blooming lotus, stood frozen in the air, a furious expression on his face but utterly motionless.

The Immeasurable Water and Fire on Five-Eyed had long been extinguished, and his aura was at eighty or ninety percent of its peak—he was in the best condition among all the Merciful Ones present. Yet the old fool refused to move a muscle.

"You—"

Before Chiluo could finish his curse, the Great Void trembled. A deafening roar, like a clap of thunder, exploded by his ear.

"ROAR—"

On Xiaoshi Mountain, the assembled Buddhist cultivators looked up. The sky was tearing apart, riddled with black fractures of all sizes that connected to the Great Void. Dazzling golden qi mixed with a treasured glow shot forth, transforming into swaying pink lotuses and a fine shower of golden sand as it entered the mortal world.

A bright golden streak of light escaped from mid-air. Amidst the scattering petals and sand, the intricately patterned Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions circled with a sorrowful cry, its form especially stark against the white snow. Chiluo stared, dumbfounded, and cried out in horror, "Taixi is wounded!"

That single streak of light seemed to signal the collapse of the entire battlefield. The purple immortal pavilion floating in the sky grew brighter. A middle-aged man with salt-and-pepper hair stood upon it, positioned just in front of the Autumn Lake Fairy, Ning Wan.

And the Purple Mansion Realm spirit sword—snow-white, its body etched with the profound snows of the Supreme Yin, its surface depicting the passage of autumn into winter—was now in the middle-aged man’s hand.

‘Lingmei!’

Daoist Master Lingmei of the Sword Gate! Lingmei, wielding the Great Snow's Severing Edge!

The difference between the Great Snow's Severing Edge in Ning Wan's hands versus Lingmei's was like that between heaven and earth. The Buddhist Land in the sky vanished almost instantly. The rainbow lights, the treasured thrones, the golden bodies—they all fled faster than they had arrived, leaving behind nothing but the gently falling snow.

Only now did Chiluo belatedly understand Five-Eyed's inaction. Lingmei must have used Li Ximing as bait, wounding Taixi and his Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions with the very first strike. If he, Chiluo, had been the target, he might not have even had the chance to escape back to the Buddhist Land!

For centuries, he and Five-Eyed had been at odds, yet today, he owed his life to the other's caution. A complex feeling washed over him as he fled into the Great Void.

‘How cunning. They say the old fool has been moody and unpredictable lately, even harming his own disciples. This is hardly the behavior of a senile man… he’s only getting craftier… He must be plotting for the next Maha position in the Way of Emptiness…’

He didn't know that Five-Eyed was just as terrified, his limbs weak with fear. Not daring to look back, his mind racing with scattered thoughts, he scrambled into the Great Void. The other Merciful Ones scattered like startled birds, each fleeing for their lives.

Who would dare to stay? Hadn't they seen Zhelu dissipate his own Buddhist Land? That Maha only remained to prevent the complete annihilation of the Merciful Ones from the Way of Emptiness! Otherwise, against a Supreme Yang Daoist tradition Daoist Master of the Metal Virtue, wielding a famous Purple Mansion Realm spirit sword with a reputation built over centuries, it would likely cost several Golden Lotus Seats their lives to appease him.

At the same time, the grim, black-robed Daoist Master Luo was also fleeing in terror. The moment he saw Lingmei, he felt half his life drain away. Pushing his divine abilities to their limit, he abandoned all thoughts of claiming credit and simply ran.

The snowfall intensified. The Maha Zhelu was now clearly on guard. The thousand eyes on his body blinked in unison as pink and golden light converged. Daoist Master Kui Qi’s expression relaxed as he landed beside the purple pavilion, standing with his sword cradled in his arms.

Zhelu was obviously different from Taixi. His golden body was profound and majestic, reaching to the heavens. His voice, like thunder, boomed down from the heavy clouds.

"So, it is fellow Daoist Lingmei. Seeing such a divine ability of the Sword Dao, this one mistook you for Lou Xing."

Lingmei remained silent, but golden qi began to gather on his blade. The Great Snow's Severing Edge hadn't been in the hands of a supreme sword cultivator for many years, and it now pulsed with a faint light, as if trembling with excitement.

At the mention of Lou Xing's name, a cold glint flashed in Daoist Master Kui Qi's eyes. He was not a patient man. How could he possibly restrain himself? He opened his mouth and cursed, "Old bald donkey, who do you think you're fooling! If my Great Daoist Master were here, would you dare show even half of that shiny head of yours? If you’re going to scram, then do it!"

"Back when my Great Daoist Master roamed unchallenged with his sword, did you, Zhelu, dare to even breathe a word against him? My Great Daoist Master goes into seclusion for a few years, and suddenly you crawl out to bark!"

A sneer spread across Kui Qi's face as he spoke fearlessly. "If you push us southern cultivators too far, I’d like to see if it’s your golden body that shatters first!"

Kui Qi’s tirade was cathartic. Lingmei’s brow relaxed, and even Ning Wan, who had been besieged within her formation for days, felt a sense of relief despite her usually reserved nature. She silently consumed a medicinal pill.

Li Ximing emerged from the Great Void and supported Chen Yin, who was hovering in mid-air. The Chen Clan ancestor's face was ashen; his injuries were clearly not light. Without hesitation, Li Ximing retrieved a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill from his sleeve, pressed it into Chen Yin's hand, and said in a low voice, "Rest easy, elder. This pill was refined by the Pristine Water lineage and excels at healing injuries and regulating qi… it’s a perfect match for your divine ability. Take it quickly."

Though both were Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters, Chen Yin's lack of quality pills was obvious compared to someone like Li Ximing. The others were from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and certainly didn't lack for good things. In truth, he was in the most dire straits, and he quickly accepted the pill with a word of thanks.

High above, Zhelu remained unperturbed by the verbal assault. His tone was calm, clear, and resonant. "Though this one is no match for him, I would be endlessly grateful and overjoyed for the opportunity to receive pointers from fellow Daoist Lou Xing…"

Daoist Master Lingmei had, after all, not yet crossed into the Purple Mystery. Though Zhelu was wary of him holding the spirit sword, he certainly didn't fear him as he would the Great Daoist Master Lou Xing. Lingmei regarded him with cold eyes and said softly, "There's no need to trouble my elder. I will be your opponent."

The moment his words fell, Zhelu had already vanished into the Great Void. Kui Qi on the purple immortal pavilion disappeared at the same instant. The radiance over Xiaoshi Mountain faded, and dark clouds once again blanketed the sky. The world grew dim, leaving only a thick layer of snow on the ground.

The spectral light of the Great Snow's Severing Edge pierced the Great Void, shifting into myriad forms. Soft moonlight and chilling radiance instantly submerged the absolute blackness.

The Great Void was supposed to be empty, yet now even the darkness receded like a tide. Zhelu's golden body was terrifyingly massive. A thousand arms extended from his back, each with an eye in its palm, creating an image that was at once regal and grotesque.

The thousands of eyes opened in unison, each pupil a shade of bluish-black. With the slightest movement, they shot out streams of pink light, fanning out like a peacock's tail in a dazzling display.

Daoist Master Lingmei unleashed but a single sword strike.

The strike flowed with white snow and reflected the autumn light, surging upstream against the endless river of pink radiance, aiming straight for Zhelu's face. In an instant, the Great Void thundered, exploding in a flash of infinite brilliance.

With such a great battle erupting in the Great Void, feedback rippled across the mortal world. Layers of golden snow drifted through the air, dissipating before they could touch the ground. The few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators present all wore looks of astonishment.

‘What magnificent sword light!’

Being so close to the Buddhist cultivators from the north was already extremely dangerous. With Lingmei and Zhelu fighting in the Great Void, the others naturally had to leave quickly. Li Ximing glanced around before flying his light closer. Aboard the purple immortal pavilion, Ning Wan coughed twice, spitting up some blood, which caused a light snow to fall once more over Xiaoshi Mountain. Color, however, gradually returned to her cheeks; she was clearly much better.

Seeing Li Ximing approach, Ning Wan raised a delicate eyebrow and said softly, "Greetings, Zhaojing… Thank you for your help this time."

This was the first time Li Ximing had met her. He politely cupped his hands in response. "It was my duty."

Just then, the purple immortal pavilion at their feet finally transformed, its light scattering until it shrank into a palm-sized replica. Daoist Master Tinglan at last appeared, holding the miniature pavilion in her hand.

The woman's divine abilities and spiritual energy were dim, her face pale and utterly exhausted. Most critically, her foundation seemed to have been shaken. Purple qi bled from her body, and her divine ability flickered unstably. Compared to her, Ning Wan's injuries seemed minor.

Seeing Li Ximing, Tinglan forced herself to rally. Looking somewhat surprised, she exhaled, "We've troubled you all… a special trip all the way from the Eastern Sea for one such as me…"

Li Ximing was more familiar with her than with Ning Wan. Seeing her state, he bowed and replied, "You were trapped, fellow Daoist. It was only natural that we come to your aid!"

Chen Yin was clearly not acquainted with either woman. He simply nodded without a word. The four of them fled into the Great Void, crossed the river, and were escorted all the way to the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. Tinglan consumed another pill and said with her head lowered, "I won't offer empty thanks. My injuries are severe and cannot wait. I will remember this assistance. Allow me to stabilize my divine ability first… I'll leave matters in fellow Daoist Ning's hands for now…"

She took a round, gray-gold formation plate with purple markings, along with a jade slip, from her sleeve and passed them to Ning Wan. Only then did she offer Li Ximing a faint, strained smile. "Regarding your clan's grand formation… do not worry. Daoist Master Ning's talent in the Dao of formations is astonishing. Unlike my own half-baked efforts, her skills will soon surpass mine. Her ideas are more inspired. It is best to entrust it to her."

Ning Wan nodded silently. Having faced death together, she felt a much closer bond with Tinglan and said gently, "I will handle whatever arrangements you've made, sister. Please focus on your recovery."

Tinglan simply held the purple jade pavilion, seemingly using the item to temporarily suppress her injuries, and transformed into a streak of purple qi that flew into the depths of the Blessed Land.

Li Ximing felt a knot of tension loosen in his chest. He figured the matter was more or less concluded.

Without the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, Li Ximing's task would have been incredibly difficult, and injuries would have been certain. Thankfully, the Great Xiukui Monastery had been generous. The only real danger had been Taixi, but that Maha had been driven back by a single slash from Lingmei, allowing Li Ximing to emerge unscathed.

Yet, thinking back on it, he still found it unbelievable. Others might not know, but he, Li Ximing, had witnessed it firsthand.

‘Just one slash…’

Taixi had attacked with his full power, using the renowned Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions. Yet Lingmei's strike had first damaged the Treasured Artifact itself, scarring it and stripping away its radiance, then shattered Taixi's protective aura before delivering a final, decisive blow that sent the Maha fleeing for his life.

Although Lingmei had charged his attack in advance and had the element of surprise, Taixi's Treasured Artifact had also been borrowed. If not for the Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions, he probably would have lost his horse-like head…

"Daoist Master Lingmei truly possesses the might of a sword immortal…"

Li Ximing would never believe that the person who unleashed such a strike possessed no Sword Intent. As he voiced his thoughts, Chen Yin, also a sword cultivator, sighed, "Elder Lingmei's cultivation in the Sword Dao has reached the pinnacle of perfection. Even without Sword Intent, his power is enough to command respect. Even the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal of Qize from the Wu State often comes to pay his respects, admitting his own inferiority, and has never gained an advantage in a duel against him."

"To have the might of a sword immortal without possessing Sword Intent… if he were to ever attain it, his current sword light would become… incomparably more terrifying."

Li Ximing nodded in amazement, but a doubt arose in his mind. As they rode the wind over the lake, he asked, "I'm a bit confused. After Sword Origin comes Sword Intent… without achieving Sword Intent, how can one attain Sword Might, which is even higher? It must be that the Sword Gate's sword arts are simply that incredible…"

Chen Yin nodded slightly, apparently sharing the same speculation. Ning Wan, however, had a complex expression, as if she hadn't fully recovered from the siege up north. Hearing Li Ximing's question, she answered listlessly, "Sword Intent must come before the achievement of a Body Divine Ability. Once the Body Divine Ability is formed, no matter how high one's cultivation in the Sword Dao… Sword Intent becomes unattainable… unless one uses that technique from the ancient texts, 'Nurturing the Azure Aether'…"

‘'Nurturing the Azure Aether'… the same technique as the young Sword Immortal King of old…’

Li Ximing finally understood. Pondering this, he continued toward the lake. The three of them emerged from the Great Void and landed on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The mountain was covered in gardenia trees, and pillars of white jade stood or lay scattered about, just as they had been. The ground, however, had been swept clean. The round table and stools were just as he'd left them.

The jade pot had even been filled with fresh, clear water, ready for his return at any moment.

It had been years since Li Ximing had been back. Seeing the familiar scene filled him with emotion. With a wave of his sleeve, he said, "My home is humble. I hope you two don't mind."

The two didn't stand on ceremony and took their seats. As Li Ximing began to brew tea, Ning Wan looked a little uneasy and said with her gaze lowered, "This time… I was only spared serious injury thanks to Senior Tinglan's full protection. But the matters by the river… they are now my responsibility. I'm afraid I will have to trouble Zhaojing for assistance."

"But of course."

Li Ximing still felt a lingering unease. He had played it safe this time and the situation hadn't turned dire, so he was unharmed. But seeing Tinglan's state… even with the Purple Smoke Blessed Land's potent spirit medicines, she would be unable to act for some time. He asked, "How did things escalate to such a point?"

Ning Wan shook her head. "There was unusual activity on Xiaoshi Mountain. Tinglan suspected someone was making a move, but we never thought fate would fall on the side of the Northern Buddhists. We were tricked and ambushed by the Way of Emptiness… We didn't expect the Buddhist cultivators to be able to track our movements, so we were careless."

"Fortunately, we had the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion. A Dharma Treasure of its caliber has profound abilities to defend against enemies. Zhelu was also wary of the trump cards we might hold… and I had the Great Snow's Severing Edge. We originally planned to break out… but Tinglan was worried other Mahas might be waiting outside, that we would be suppressed again immediately after breaking the formation, so we held our position."

"Later, the formation shook several times, and we noticed that many of the Merciful Ones' traces had vanished. We knew reinforcements had arrived, so we finally steeled ourselves and broke through…"

Chen Yin clearly understood the situation and added, "Elder Lingmei was also waiting for the right moment… If he had acted rashly, not only would it have been difficult to ensure our safe retreat, but he would have had a hard time explaining it to his sect… With Daoist Master Ning and the Great Snow's Severing Edge appearing, he had a valid reason to intervene…"

Li Ximing mulled over his words thoughtfully.

Ning Wan said, "I've heard the Sword Gate is exceedingly traditional… Those old masters genuinely wish to withdraw from the world. Unfortunately, the other cultivators can petition Chenghua Hall to use the Sword Codex to restrain them. If Elder Lingmei hadn't stabilized the Cheng family beforehand… he wouldn't have had this much freedom today."

Chen Yin was not part of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, so he remained silent. Li Ximing said even less, simply pouring her tea. After a while, Chen Yin set down his cup and finally spoke.

"Daoist Master Luo from the Southern Borderlands also contributed this time. However, he was fighting a Merciful One just now and may have been injured… He also doesn't trust us very much, so he left first."

Since Chen Yin had invited him, he was obviously entrusted to speak on his behalf. He clearly didn't want to get too involved, but he had followed them all the way to the lake, evidently just to say this.

As expected, Ning Wan frowned, a flicker of doubt in her eyes. "Daoist Master Luo… I have not heard of him…"

Though Chen Yin had to mention him, the man was not a virtuous character, and he was speaking to members of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. He made no effort to cover for him. "You need not worry, Daoist Master Ning. He is no old friend of the Azure Pond Sect. His Daoist tradition is simply incomplete, and he needs to supplement it. He coveted a certain something within the Azure Pond's secret archives, which is why he offered his help."

Ning Wan seemed to be contemplating this. Chen Yin then rose to his feet and said politely, "Now that I have left the Chen Clan and shown myself by the river, there will surely be villains plotting against me. I must return quickly to handle the changing situation, so I will not impose any longer…"

Seeing that he was about to leave, Li Ximing hesitated slightly and asked, "What about Senior Lingmei…"

"No need to worry. Even if that Daoist Master Cheng is focused on his cultivation and hasn't appeared in a long time, he would surely be present for an event of this magnitude… His swordsmanship and cultivation are inferior to Elder Lingmei's, but he is still a high-level cultivator of the Metal Virtue. No harm will come to them…"

Ning Wan also looked up and reminded him, "Among all the sects, the Buddhist cultivators fear the Sword Gate the most. No matter how strong other Daoist traditions are, leaving behind contingencies is not easy. Some predecessors can't even leave anything behind… But Sword Intent can be passed down within a sword, generation after generation… Their hidden reserves are the greatest of all the major powers…"

"Our methods might at most destroy one of his golden bodies. But if the Sword Gate is pushed too far, killing a Maha is not out of the question… and it wouldn't even significantly deplete their foundation."

Chen Yin nodded, sighed, and hurriedly departed with a bow.

With him gone, Ning Wan relaxed considerably. She leaned on the jade table, a trace of exhaustion showing on her face, and said softly, "The Li family hasn't had it easy all these years. If junior brother Chejing were here, he… would be a top figure by now… The Chi family got what they deserved… I warned them long ago. I didn't expect Heyuan to be lost as well."

She was reminiscing. As for whether the Chi family deserved their fate, perhaps Ning Wan thought so, but Li Ximing didn't particularly agree. If Chi Buzi were still in the sect, the Chi family would be living just as freely as before, and he, Li Ximing, would still have to bow his head to Chi Buzi… He replied, "Their luck ran out and their power waned, which coincided with the retaliation from those they ruled. The Ning family is also free now…"

Ning Wan smiled, took a small box from her sleeve, and placed it on the jade table. "It was a lot of trouble for you to make this trip. I'm not very familiar with Senior Chen Yin, so I'll have to pay him a formal visit to thank him later. But between our two families, there's no need for such ceremony… I've delayed your cultivation, making you travel thousands of miles from the Eastern Sea. I must compensate you."

"This is a cultivation resource called the 'Surging Li Treasure Leaf.' It came from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, from a spirit flower that grows beside the Ancient Origin Flower. It is a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation resource of the Li Fire lineage…"

She opened the box. Inside lay a single, long, crimson leaf, curled up within. Its purple-black veins glowed faintly. How could Ning Wan, who had only recently reached the Purple Mansion Realm, have so many fine things? It must have been a legacy from the Ning family's Daoist Master, Yuansu.

‘A Li Fire resource?’

Li Ximing had once received a Horn Wood resource as a gift from the Sword Gate. Purple Mansion Realm resources were not as valuable as true spirit objects, as they were often non-essential parts of Purple Mansion-grade spirit items, but they were still not easy to come by. For Ning Wan to offer this specifically left Li Ximing stunned.

Rescuing Ning Wan was indeed a small favor, but Kui Qi had initiated the effort and had even paid him to help. Ning Wan's gesture was a clear attempt to deepen their ties. She said softly, "Li Fire conflicts with my cultivation, so this item is useless to me. Since Zhaojing is skilled in pill refinement, it will only show its true worth in your hands."

The box felt a little hot in Li Ximing's hands. He could only say, "Thank you for your kind intentions, fellow Daoist, but I cannot accept such a valuable gift. Let us say you've entrusted it to me. If I ever succeed in refining it into a pill, I will send one to you."

After all, anything related to Li Fire was quite valuable to the Li family. Not only did Bright Yang have connections to Li Fire, but Li Jiangqian also cultivated it. There was no way Li Ximing would return it. Ning Wan clearly took his words as polite pleasantries. She nodded slightly and replied, "The situation between the north and south is troublesome right now, and the Buddhist cultivators are trying to interfere. We cannot delay the Purple Mansion Realm grand formation. If we don't establish it, things will become even more difficult later."

"I read the jade slip on the way here. Elder Tinglan's design is ingenious. The most difficult part is these thirty-two Profound Nails. Give me three days. Once we set these thirty-two nails into the island and connect them to the earth veins, we can proceed."

Li Ximing was eager for her to begin. His divine ability was still somewhat turbulent and required slight regulation, but he had already taken a pill, and these things would recover over time. He couldn't be bothered with that now and said seriously, "No matter. I have the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. I can handle connecting to the earth veins. You should restore your spiritual energy first. I will set these Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails!"

For the first time since they'd met, a genuine smile touched Ning Wan's lips. "There's no need to rush, Zhaojing. Sister Tinglan determined the locations several years ago. If the earth veins have shifted at all in that time, the key points will be inaccurate… We should also wait a few days for the two Daoist Masters to arrive. It's best that we all meet."

Ning Wan was clearly quick-witted. After a small laugh, she added, "Besides… Senior Kui Qi also has very high attainments in the Dao of formations. The Great Xiukui Monastery and Hengzhu have complete inheritances; their pills and formations are both strong… That's knowledge from an Immortal Mansion. Just asking him a single question could bring great benefits to your family's formation!"

"Rest assured, I don't need to show him the formation plate. I'll just ask him about the earth vein nodes from his perspective. Once Tinglan's Profound Nails are in place, the earth veins will shift and merge into the formation. We won't have to worry about leaking any secrets…"

Li Ximing nodded inwardly. The woman was very considerate. She was clearly explaining it in a way she assumed a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with little knowledge of formations would understand. He simply nodded as if he understood perfectly.

He then sat cross-legged on a jade pillar. As light and darkness intertwined around him, he could feel the spiritual artifact from the Xiukui, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, in his sleeve. It radiated a faint Bright Yang glow, making his Audience with the Celestial Gate technique even more active.
