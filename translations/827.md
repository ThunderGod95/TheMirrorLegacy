# Chapter 827: Consultation

Li Jiangqian waited for more than a day before Cui Jueyin strode in from outside the hall. His emotions appeared to have stabilized; he bowed, his composed attitude restored, and reported, "Patriarch, the Second Young Master is outside the hall."

"Please, let him in."

After Li Jiangqian replied, Cui Jueyin immediately withdrew. A short while later, a man entered the hall.

He wore simple cloth robes and plain boots, his entire person unadorned save for the single sword at his waist. He was already at the late stage of Qi Refining, yet his brow was filled with an easy calm, as if he were a rogue cultivator just emerged from a temple. He approached Li Jiangqian and bowed deeply.

"Greetings, Patriarch!"

This was Li Jianglong. Over the years, he had governed Funan with stability and prosperity. There had not been a single disturbance from rogue or demonic cultivators. He had successfully walled off the chaos of Jiangbei, resolving the Li family’s northern troubles while securing a significant income of spiritual resources. He was, by all measures, exceptionally competent.

He and his third brother, Li Jiangxia, had stabilized two fronts during the chaotic period when Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei had left the family. If not for the three brothers, the clan would have faced countless more troubles.

Li Jiangqian smiled at him and waved his hand gently. The guards stationed in the hall all retreated, closing the main and side doors tight. The spiritual lamps brightened, leaving only the two of them in the vast hall. Li Jiangqian’s smile vanished. He strode down from his seat and personally helped Li Jianglong up.

He spoke heavily. "I have called Second Brother back this time because we are abandoning the Funan territory."

It went without saying how much heart’s blood Li Jianglong had poured into Funan. The statement nearly shattered his composure. He took a moment to steady himself, frowning as he asked, "Patriarch, this is…"

Li Jiangqian said, "A True Monarch intends to reincarnate in Jiangbei. Right in the Sanxi region."

Li Jianglong stared at him blankly.

Shaking his head, Li Jiangqian clarified, "It is a True Monarch from the Northern High Sect. Zhang Duanyan of the Golden Feather Sect came personally to deliver the edict."

Those three sentences completely destroyed Li Jianglong’s calm. His pupils dilated, his face flooded with utter disbelief. After several long breaths, he finally managed to ask, "Like Chu Yi, all those years ago?"

"Correct."

Li Jiangqian affirmed it and led him over to the main desk, spreading out a large map. He summarized the Golden Feather Sect's orders. When he finished, Li Jianglong's expression was one of profound gravity.

"If we mishandle this," Li Jianglong said, "it is a catastrophe that could implicate tens of thousands. It is an event that means death and the annihilation of our clan."

Li Jiangqian nodded. "Second Brother understands Funan best. The situation there, and how we make a clean break... that is the trouble."

Li Jianglong contemplated for a moment, studying the map. "When the Floating Cloud Cave was destroyed, the common folk were plundered by the other two caves and have never recovered. Our family’s control there revolves around the spirit fields and veins, mostly garrisoned by cultivators from outside the region. Withdrawing them won't be difficult... but once we leave, the sparse local population cannot possibly produce many cultivators. They will be stranded and isolated; even self-governance will be a problem."

He continued, "If our family releases this land, Capital immortals Dao will also have to release Midong. Midong is a tangled web of established families. Many immortal sects from both Jiangnan and Jiangbei have people embedded there, and the population is dense. They will immediately move to swallow Funan."

Midong was difficult to govern for two fundamental reasons: first, the massive populations of the established families; second, the various major sects all recruited direct descendants from these families, supporting these local tyrants so they could acquire Jiangbei’s spiritual resources at low cost or through outright plunder. Li Jiangqian knew this well.

"Based on your understanding of Jiangbei," Li Jiangqian asked, "how will the Midong situation develop? Is it possible these families will get the news?"

Li Jianglong pondered this. "They absolutely must not. All the major sects will pull their hands back. A 'local tyrant' is a tyrant precisely because their clan system is enormous, spanning both the overt and the covert. Their lineages are unrestricted and undecaying, resulting in a mix of the worthy and the worthless. This makes them difficult to eradicate, but it also makes it impossible for them to extricate themselves now. Even if they have clan members cultivating in the immortal sects... the light punishment will be the crippling of their cultivation. The heavy one will be execution following accusations of treason."

Li Jiangqian considered this. "Executing them also has drawbacks. What if the clan declines, and Heavenly Fate just so happens to land on their remnants? That would only cause more trouble. Since the edict mentioned sending them 'to Qi and Lu,' let them go there. The ones we should truly fear are the Northern powers. The immortal sects will make a clean break, but they won't be *so* ruthless as to burn every bridge. They must leave themselves a path of retreat."

Li Jianglong observed his brother’s expression and replied, "This little brother was inconsiderate. In that case, we need not convict them. We just need to arrange for someone to... eliminate them. If trouble arises one day, we can simply push out the scapegoat. Since they won't be fleeing south, it will be an easy excuse to make."

"That is the correct logic."

The two brothers stared at the map. Li Jianglong mused, "Funan doesn't have many entanglements, but there are a few local clan cultivators who are difficult to handle. An excuse is easy enough to find. We grant them spiritual items and send them away. After a period, we tell them in advance that we are withdrawing and Capital immortals Dao is moving in. They will flee for their lives with their entire families."

"There are also a few of our cultivators who... enjoyed themselves locally and fathered children. Treat them as Jiangbei rogue cultivators. Take them and their entire villages away. We won't leave behind a single dog or duck."

The Li family employed many cultivators originating from Jiangbei, but thankfully, most were rogue cultivators and easily handled. Li Jiangqian nodded silently in approval.

Suddenly, a light knock sounded at the main door, interrupting their conversation. Qu Bushi entered, his face a mask of suspicion and shock.

"Reporting to the Patriarch! That... that utterly shameless Capital immortals Dao... they sent their fiend guest elder to request an audience!"

Li Jiangqian frowned. "This early? Surely not... How many people did Daoist Friend Guan bring? It wasn't spread around, was it?"

Qu Bushi looked as though he had seen a ghost and nearly bit his tongue. He hesitated, "That fiend... uh... the person from Capital immortals Dao... came alone. He just appeared outside the island... and asked someone to pass the message secretly. This old slave understands the gravity of the situation and did not let anyone see him."

Li Jiangqian let out a breath of relief. "Bring him up through the side hall. Do not let him be seen."

Qu Bushi hurried away. About the time it takes for half an incense stick to burn, a middle-aged man entered. He had been wearing dashing white robes, but the moment he stepped into the hall, his appearance shifted. He now had high brows, deep-set eyes, and wore black Daoist robes tied with a silk belt. He walked into the hall, his face a picture of bitterness, and sighed.

"Greetings, Patriarch!"

Li Jiangqian gave a slight nod, his tone perfectly neutral. "So, it is the Capital immortals Sect Master."

It was, astonishingly, the Capital immortals Sect Master Guan Gongxiao himself.

Guan Gongxiao had no temper to speak of right now, and he was already a mild-mannered man by nature. He shook his head and replied, "With this disaster looming over us, there is no room for old grudges between our families. My family arrived hastily from overseas; we have never encountered anything like this. I came to see the Patriarch the very instant I received the order."

Capital immortals Dao's territory was located even north of the Sanxi region; their situation was infinitely more precarious than the Li family's. Guan Gongxiao was naturally desperate. It wasn't just him; the Xuanmiao Temple and the Chengyun Gate were likely in the exact same predicament.

Li Jiangqian chose not to bicker. He only asked, "Does your Daoist Master have any orders?"

Guan Gongxiao silently shook his head. After a brief pause, he answered, "My family’s Daoist Master entered seclusion many years ago. He is not currently in Jiangbei."

The absence of Daoist Master Yehui was not a critical secret. Many sects with Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had them stationed abroad for long periods, especially those without the reputation of a Supreme Yang Dao Lineage. The fewer Purple Mansion Realm masters a sect had, the less likely they were to remain stationary. Daoist Master Chuting of the Xiao family hadn't returned to Jiangnan in decades, yet the Xiao family remained as stable as Mount Tai.

But when Li Jiangqian heard this, he instantly understood.

'No wonder this fellow rushed over here so frantically,' he thought. 'His Daoist Master is out traveling or in seclusion, and who knows how many years that will last. This is serious. Yehui might be gone for ten years. When he finally emerges, there might not be a single person named Guan left in the entire Baiye region.'

'Looked at this way, the Golden Feather Sect basically just saved the Capital immortals lineage.'

He gestured to the side, inviting Guan Gongxiao to sit. "This is Jianglong, my younger brother."

Guan Gongxiao shook his head. "I have long heard of your brother's reputation. When Wang He was managing Midong earlier, he came to complain every other day. It later escalated to the point where he couldn't salvage the situation."

The brothers did not acknowledge the barb. Guan Gongxiao stood up. "I came here today, first, because I have something I must clarify with your clan."

His expression turned solemn. "My family's Daoist Master has never borne your clan any ill will. Regarding the Changxiao incident, he worked extremely hard to mediate and secretly assist, hoping only to protect your clan as much as possible. Perhaps the Patriarch finds this absurd. But to say something unpleasant..."

"Even if it meant earning your clan's hatred for nothing, my Daoist Master hoped Changxiao would gain one more blood feud. He least of all wanted to see your esteemed father come to harm. Even when a fatal weakness was held by others, he insisted on giving those secret warnings. That was the reason."

He lowered his voice. "Regardless of our families' relationship, on the matter of the Changxiao Sect, my Daoist Master earnestly hopes our two families share the same stance."

Li Jiangqian remained silent for a moment. He was not Li Ximing; he had no understanding of the situation back then. The best response was no response at all. "This is not a matter I can address. It must wait for the Daoist Masters to communicate. The issue currently at hand is the most urgent."

Guan Gongxiao sat back down and nodded.

Li Jiangqian began, "Your esteemed sect must abandon Midong. But a land full of warring factions is ultimately a bad thing. First, we need a 'leader' so that all consequences finally land on him. Second, we need some demonic cultivators or beasts, so the lords can amuse themselves to their satisfaction, saving them the trouble of finding replacements elsewhere. And third... both our sides need a valid reason to withdraw. The loose ends must be tied up so we do not arouse the suspicion of others."

Guan Gongxiao nodded. "The demonic beasts aren't urgent. If a territory is left empty for a year or two, they will naturally appear. The Fanyun territory still has several demon generals causing trouble. There will be plenty to clean up. A leader is also easy to find; the world is overflowing with the greedy. But your third point... that truly is a problem. The families in Midong aren't fools. If both our sides withdraw simultaneously, they will smell a rat immediately."

Li Jiangqian thought for a moment, then whispered, "This isn't without a solution. We just need an excuse."

He used a formation array to send an order. Qu Bushi immediately entered from outside. When he saw Guan Gongxiao seated nearby, the three of them appearing harmonious and even smiling, he felt an internal shockwave. He bowed.

"Greetings Patriarch, Young Master, and Sect Master."

Guan Gongxiao took a sip of tea. "What Sect Master? This humble one is Gongxiao of Jiangbei."

Guan Gongxiao hadn't even bothered to change out of his formal Sect Master robes, yet Qu Bushi saw the smiles on all three faces, nodded repeatedly, and began apologizing profusely.

Li Jiangqian paused briefly, then said, "Daoist Friend Gong has brought news. There is a Secret Diffusion Direct Lineage Token somewhere in Jiangbei. Rumor holds that it contains a favor from a high-level cultivator. The holder can establish their own lineage there, and it even involves a Purple Mansion realm spirit treasury. It is something that even we and Capital immortals Dao cannot interfere with. You are to send men immediately. Dig three feet deep if you must, but you are to find this thing."

Qu Bushi wiped sweat from his brow as he nodded.

Guan Gongxiao smiled slightly and added, "I hear this rumor has spread like the wind. Apparently, a direct disciple of Capital immortals Dao revealed it while drunk. That disciple has already been locked up. Everyone in the Three Rivers area knows about it. The Lake is actually late to hear the news. You must hurry."

Qu Bushi was an old hand who had navigated Jiangbei for years. He had never heard of such a thing. Connecting this to Li Jiangqian's earlier intentions, he instantly understood.

"This old slave will absolutely ensure this matter is carried out to the fullest!"

He hurried away. Li Jiangqian then continued, "Your sect will first start a fight with my family in Funan. We will pull our people back, emptying the land. Simultaneously, fight us across the river, forcing your reserves to reinforce from that direction. Create a standoff. A feigned war."

"At this point, Funan will be abandoned by us. All we need is an ambitious Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Eastern Sea. We let him 'find' this Secret Diffusion Lineage Sect Master Token. With the path to the Purple Mansion realm laid out before him, how could he not be moved?"

"The moment he dares to try... my family will immediately send congratulatory gifts. Your sect will order the Midong families to march south and 'offer tribute' to this new power. Everything will click perfectly into place."

Guan Gongxiao nodded repeatedly. "Good idea! A brilliant idea! My sect has strong connections in the Eastern Sea; gathering information is easy. We already have several candidates on hand."

Li Jiangqian smiled, finding Guan Gongxiao much less disagreeable now. "Then we shall rely on your esteemed sect to lure this ambitious man over."

As for spreading the rumors and the details about the "locked-up disciple," they didn't need further discussion. Guan Gongxiao would handle it perfectly.

Li Jianglong considered the plan but remained worried. He looked at his brother. "But with the Daoist Master absent, things may not go exactly as we anticipate... What if this person gets the token but remains cautious? It could drag matters out."

Li Jiangqian shook his head, his voice turning hollow. "We do not need to concern ourselves with that. Someone *else* will ensure it happens. The rumor will certainly become truer than the truth. One, two, or perhaps even more scapegoats... everyone involved will be delighted to see it."

Both men nodded. Guan Gongxiao then said, "Regardless, in my humble opinion, I fear we must also find the Northern Brocade River King."

At the mention of this prominent follower of the dragon-kin, both brothers frowned.

Li Jiangqian adopted a thoughtful expression. "He likely also has thoughts of moving. He absolutely cannot be allowed to remain here. Leave the matter of this Demon General to us."

"Good!"

Smiling broadly, Guan Gongxiao raised his cup to the two brothers. The two lineages, regarded by the outside world as mortal enemies locked in a death feud, drank tea together like old friends.

Guan Gongxiao lowered his voice. "We must communicate frequently about this matter moving forward. I cannot come here often; it is too easy to expose myself. I will send disciples in disguise, carrying a token, to relay my words. The Lake should do the same."

Li Jiangqian nodded. They dispensed with the formal pleasantries of seeing him off, merely clasping their hands in salute. Guan Gongxiao stepped out of the hall, his appearance completely changed, and was escorted away by a servant.

Li Jianglong watched him depart, his expression unsettled. Li Jiangqian, too, was filled with doubt.

'During the turmoil on the East Shore back then,' Li Jiangqian mused, 'Capital immortals Dao truly was conspicuously restrained... They later sent someone to actively ease tensions, even returning Protector An. I have no idea how much of what he just said was truth and how much was fabrication.'

His gaze locked onto the map on the desk. He suddenly recalled something:

"Zhang Duanyan hid several things when she spoke. When she listed the subordinate relationships, she didn't seem to mention Capital immortals Dao... She listed the others in order but skipped right over them. And the Capital immortals lineage name doesn't even begin with 'Xuan'..."
