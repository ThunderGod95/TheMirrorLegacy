# Chapter 1016: The Two Rites

The veil-like silver light drifted down, and Wu Fan's gaze lowered as if scalded. The dread in his heart expanded rapidly, and he began kowtowing with a frantic thump-thump-thump, his voice trembling with fear.

"Reporting… reporting, my lord… the twenty-seven peaks of the Changxiao Gate's Classic Treasury have been seized by the Immortal Clan's heavenly soldiers. This lowly one did not dare to take control. The remaining… the remaining seven vaults and six storerooms are under the Daoist Masters' direct management and are located at the base of the formation."

"As for the twelve remaining Spiritual Vaults, their keys were originally held by the Immortal Peaks… but… but…"

Wu Fan raised his eyebrows slightly, as if unsure whether he should speak, a look of fear and difficulty on his face. However, the Li Zhouwei before him had already stepped inside, reaching the highest point of the mountain gate, the Immortal Hall.

On either side, a white jade Treasured Vase was placed. Six great columns were arranged in a single line, adorned with a series of folding screens, all inscribed with golden characters. At the very top was a mystical Daoist painting, with a silver-patterned background. In the center was a faceless man in golden robes, gently holding a Treasured Vase.

'Though it's not a Spiritual Artifact or a dharma artifact, the materials used are of very high quality. Having hung for so long, it's gained a bit of divine charm… but it's a pity it was painted by the Changxiao himelf and isn't a true ancient heirloom. Its usefulness is limited.'

Above this painting, a golden plaque was inscribed with four large characters: Upper Rite Celestial Empyrean.

Li Zhouwei was very familiar with these four characters. Back when he was in the Wanling Heaven, he once visited Clear Rite Peak, where he saw these exact same four characters!

When he saw the words "Changxiao of the Western Rite" at the base of the mountain, he had already suspected they were part of the same Daoist Tradition. Now, it was confirmed beyond a doubt. The four characters at the foot of the mountain were likely the name of the tradition that Changxiao had established for itself, an offshoot of the Upper Rite Celestial Empyrean.

Seeing Li Zhouwei pause here, Wu Fan hurried forward, only to be stopped by Li Minggong's outstretched hand. The woman bowed slightly, took a step forward, and removed the painting from the beam, placing it carefully inside a jade box.

The moment the Daoist painting was put into the jade box, the entire Immortal Hall lost its luster. The flowing, radiant mystic columns and Treasured Vases all dimmed. The great hall, which had been bright with its own light, was now only illuminated by the lamps.

Outside the hall, faint sobs could be heard, but Wu Fan paid them no mind. He whispered in a low voice:

"The Lady of the Inner Quarters, Guiqin, has handled the sect's affairs for many years. She likes to inquire about the vaults and borrows the keys to keep them safe. The old geezer with the white hair, to curry favor with the Daoist Master and keep his position, feigned ignorance… All matters concerning the Spiritual Vaults passed through the Lady's peak… We… we truly do not know!"

He had seized the sect carelessly from the old geezer, and despite having some ability, he had waited for the Li family to invade the peaks. By then, he could no longer manage the sect's affairs. More fatally, he truly did not dare to provoke the Lady Guiqin.

The Daoist Master Cheng Yan in the sky seemed to be done for, but who knew what methods a Daoist Master might have to escape? Would there really be a life-and-death struggle between Daoist Masters? If Cheng Yan were to suddenly reappear after a while and surrender to the lake, having meddled with a Daoist Master's inner circle, would he still have a life to live?

"The Lady of the Inner Quarters…"

His words caused a stir among the crowd, who clearly held some resentment, though they usually dared not express it. Li Zhouwei glanced at him, then at Li Minggong. The woman nodded and whispered:

"This woman has been confined to a side peak by us."

Only then did Li Zhouwei look at Wu Fan and say, "Follow."

The man straightened up, letting out a long sigh of relief. His confidence returned. He sidled forward, and in a single step, all three of them appeared at the palace on the side peak. Wu Fan, with his head bowed and eyes lowered, began to answer:

"Reporting, my lord, the Lady of the Inner Quarters' surname is Ma. She is Daoist Master Cheng Yan's biological older sister. She has a son and a daughter of her own, though she's raised many foster sons. Her biological son died in the Eastern Sea, and the others work within the sect. The remaining daughter serves at her side… they're all in the same place…"

The palace gates creaked open, revealing a hall filled with large and small, multicolored silks, gently swaying in the breeze. It was a beautiful place, yet it was filled with mournful wailing.

Amidst the flying silks, two women were embracing and weeping before the hall. One had a round face and elegant eyebrows, was draped in white silk, and had skin as white as snow, arousing a feeling of pitiful sympathy in all who saw her. However, having cultivated Cold Qi, she also possessed a noble air of untouchable dignity. Her expression was full of grief, her eyes glistening with tears.

In her arms, she held a girl, small and lovely, with a rosy face and a golden robe. Her pale red lips were tightly pursed, and her eyes were fixed on the steps below. She barely turned her head when she heard the sound from the front of the hall, but she did not dare to look up.

Wu Fan felt a burst of satisfaction. In the past, this mother and daughter had stomped all over him, and he hadn't dared to resist. Now they had fallen to this. He followed Li Minggong inside and roared,

"Where are the Spiritual Keys!"

The Lady Guiqin looked up with hatred, her tear-filled eyes staring at him without a word. She possessed a naturally aloof elegance. Li Minggong was a beauty of the first order, but she couldn't replicate the mother and daughter's charming, delicate frowns, and for a moment, she was outshone.

Wu Fan, eager to please, didn't care about pitying her. He kicked the woman on the shoulder, making her grunt in pain. But the Lady Guiqin still wouldn't speak. Wu Fan immediately drew his sword, and for a time, shouts, curses, and the thudding of blows filled the air, mingled with endless weeping.

Li Minggong couldn't stand it any longer. She casually swept the man aside and stood to the side. Li Zhouwei stepped forward, bent slightly, and pinched the woman's chin, forcing her to look up and meet his eyes.

When the Lady Guiqin met his golden pupils, she was suddenly stunned. The intense hatred in her eyes melted like ice and snow, transforming in an instant into a soaring, bewildered joy. She hurriedly turned over, spread her legs, and exposed her throat, a sweet, humming laugh escaping her lips.

"My lord… my lord… the Spiritual Keys are in the secret formation beneath the host's seat… my lord…"

This scene sent a shiver of alarm through Wu Fan. A powerful dread surged within him, and he fought the urge for his legs to turn to jelly. Unsure of the lord's thoughts, he knelt beside the woman, wanting to help her up.

But the instant her words fell, the hand that had been holding her chin suddenly left. The Lady Guiqin's head detached from her neck, floating lightly upwards without a single drop of blood. It then rolled neatly into his hand.

The sweet red lips were still opening and closing, her gaze seductive. The cross-section of her neck was smooth and clean, as if cut by an extremely sharp dharma artifact. The man held the head in a daze. The small girl who had been facing him simultaneously fell backward, her head rolling down and coming to rest by his knees.

The man was speechless for a moment, kneeling on the ground in a stupor. The fear in his heart reached its peak. He suddenly realized that a smiling man in a green robe had appeared beside him at some point. The man gently patted his shoulder.

"Get up."

Wu Fan stood up, trembling. The green-robed man smiled at Li Zhouwei, as if explaining.

"They are, after all, of the Purple Mansion Realm bloodline. Let them have a proper end."

Wu Fan belatedly realized the truth: 'This Daoist Master was here the whole time. My mortal eyes simply couldn't see him.'

Li Zhouwei didn't care. If he weren't worried about revealing the Immortal Mirror, he wouldn't have bothered asking the Lady Guiqin anything… Seeing that Si Yuanli wanted to use this Wu Fan, using both threats and persuasion, he was too lazy to go through the trouble.

'How to deal with the Changxiao Gate and its remnants is Si Yuanli's business. He has no one under him, and Wu Fan is clearly useful.'

He flipped his hand and took out the Spiritual Keys from under the host's seat, tossing them to Li Minggong. He nodded to Si Yuanli, and the two of them vanished together, leaving Li Minggong standing alone.

"My lord…"

Wu Fan quickly turned, asking respectfully. Li Minggong shook her head. Several cultivators strode in from outside the great hall. A tall young man with a golden gaze and a long saber at his waist led the way, stopping in the hall and greeting Li Minggong.

The woman's gaze swept over him.

"I'll leave this to you."

Just by looking at his golden pupils, Wu Fan knew he was of noble and extraordinary standing. He hurried forward and said with a fawning smile:

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

Inside a deep cave-dwelling within the mountain, the light flickered. Silver formation patterns covered the walls. The two Daoist Masters walked in and stopped before the formation. Si Yuanli looked up, and as he took out a talisman from his sleeve, he used his other hand to lightly pinch and draw out a sliver of silver light.

It was the Stormshatter Wedges.

He smiled casually and said, "Since the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella has been given to my fellow Daoist, I will take the Wu Bloom Pearl… a senior of mine happens to have a use for it."

Si Yuanli clearly had some methods. Logically, with the two Daoist Masters not yet returned, the people of the sect should only be able to open the outer formation. Yet, even as he spoke, he was already slowly unlocking the inner formation.

The Changxiao were not cultivators of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, and they did not have the custom of setting up inner formations within palaces. The formation was not large, with the seven vaults and six storerooms separated and stored, appearing extremely organized.

Si Yuanli, however, laughed.

"Old Man Changxiao is too cunning; he wouldn't leave anything good for you or me. Let's check Cheng Yan's vault."

Li Zhouwei nodded and lightly beckoned. A golden stream of light already returned from the Great Void and landed in his palm. It was a scroll with a storage bag attached.

He casually patted it, and the contents of the storage bag poured out with a clatter, instantly covering the cave-dwelling with layers of spiritual objects, gleaming with light. There were hardly any spiritual stones to be seen.

Li Zhouwei swept his gaze over them, then lightly beckoned again. Seven streams of light separated from the rest, arranging themselves in a line on the table. The dense jade slips remained on the ground—these would be opened by the cultivators of the Changxiao Gate.

He then used his palm as a blade, sliding it left and right, and seemingly casually, he divided the remaining two piles of spiritual objects.

Of the seven streams of light, three were jade bottles filled with spiritual pills. Li Zhouwei himself was not lacking in such items, so he looked at the remaining four. When he opened one of the jade boxes, the first thing that caught his eye was a pale white, mystic-veined round stone.

Si Yuanli glanced at it and laughed.

"It's something from the Anhuai Heaven. This fellow had quite a few gains back then. This is the 'True Qi' spiritual resource, the Crane-Embrace Stone. Its best use is for lower-level cultivators to nurture it in their Sea of Qi to aid in their practice. It can also greatly increase their speed when riding the wind, allowing cultivators with average talent to stand out among their peers. It's useless for us to consume it… though it could be used to adorn a pair of spiritual boots."

The remaining three items were a scroll and two spiritual resources. One was a 'True Qi' resource, the Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf, a good treasure for healing injuries. It was a deep green color, and its leaves were covered with dense, stone-like patterns. It had already taken root in the jade box and was silently breathing. Unfortunately, one branch had already been plucked, leaving only two. The medicinal properties were subtly draining away.

Si Yuanli looked on in pained regret and cursed.

"What a beast! He couldn't refine pills himself, and he wouldn't find someone to do it, so what's the use of just eating it raw?… At least he knew to use a jade box to store it, or it would have dissipated long ago."

Li Zhouwei carefully examined it and found some Bright Yang Qi on it. He figured the man had consumed it while under his own divine ability, and so he let it go. However, the last spiritual resource was a 'Dawn Qi', half-gold and half-white like water. Si Yuanli immediately took notice and laughed.

"The 'Bright Yang', as one of the three Yangs, controls Li Fire and does not favor 'Dawn Qi'. On the contrary, Upright Wood finds it useful… How about you give this to me? I'll give you the Crane-Embrace Stone, and the Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf can be handed over to fellow Daoist Zhaojing for pill-refining."

"Fine."

When Li Zhouwei had asked Si Yuanli for his help, they had agreed to split Cheng Yan's belongings equally. The matter was settled easily. Li Zhouwei picked up the scroll and found that it was locked by a secret preservation art, making it difficult to open. It was quite a novelty, and he couldn't help but look at it a few more times. Si Yuanli also raised his eyebrows.

"It's an ancient item, using a secret preservation method that's even more troublesome than a jade slip's lock. If you can't open this thing… it'll just turn into a blank scroll."

"Oh? A secret preservation method? Since you can break formations, do you have a way to open it?"

Li Zhouwei paid careful attention, listening as Si Yuanli sighed.

"I won't hide anything. My ancestors had some methods and cultivated the 'Renewing Wood' Dao. They left behind some means to break formations, but this thing has a 'Binding Lock' mark on it. You'd need to find a 'Vault Metal' cultivator. Where can you find such a person these days?"

Li Zhouwei knew about 'Vault Metal' cultivators, but he raised an eyebrow, deliberately trying to probe his background. He asked, "I wonder how powerful this dao lineage is?"

Si Yuanli didn't think too much and lamented.

"I only know one thing: the Xie family has a treasure called the Profound-Tracking River-gazing Stone. It belongs to the 'Vault Metal' Dao. Inside it, there is an extremely rare Metallic Essence, the 'Hidden Uncarved Daoist Vault Essence', which is the 'Vault Metal' metallic essence. It may not be one-of-a-kind in the world, but even the great lords have very few of them."

Li Zhouwei was deep in thought and was about to speak when he suddenly looked up.

"_Crack…_"

With a crisp sound, one of the seven vaults and six storerooms of the Changxiao Gate was revealed. A great rush of white vapor poured out. In the very center was a Treasured Vase, clearly displaying the colorful radiance of a treasure. Si Yuanli asked:

"My lord, are you interested in the 'Upper Rite' dao?"

Li Zhouwei replied, "My fellow Daoist, please take a look."

Si Yuanli smiled amiably and glanced at the jade bottle, replying, "It should be an 'Upper Rite' spiritual object, used for collecting Qi."

"The 'Upper Rite' belongs to the Twelve Qi. Among them, it's known for being 'late to prosper, early to vanish, suspended and isolated.' There was once a ruling Imperial scion of the Great Zhou who obtained the Golden Core through this and thus flourished. Later, this lord's whereabouts became a mystery, and the 'Upper Rite' Dao also faded. The difficulty of this Dao… is actually in its spiritual objects."

"My Daoist Tradition mentioned that nearly ninety percent of the spiritual qi of the 'Upper Rite' needs to be gathered through a specific spiritual object. This is commonly known as the 'Spirit-Enclosing Method'. Usually, by securing this set of special spiritual objects, a dao lineage can be established. When the world changes or the spiritual objects are lost, the lineage withers."

Li Zhouwei immediately understood. He had once obtained the Essence-Gathering Profound Origin Art in the Wanling Heaven, which used the spiritual object Mystic Banquet Nectar to gather Qi.

And he himself had a 'Attaining Brightness' from the 'Upper Rite' that his grand-uncle had obtained from Daoist Master Yuanbian. The Qi-gathering method used Daoist Master Yuanbian's spiritual object, the 'Luminous-Empyrean Scroll-Cloud'. Naturally, this spiritual object would not be given to him. Liu Changdie had not specifically gone to collect it, but had it collected by his own people in the Qunyi Archipelago and then sent to him.

He was lost in thought, but Si Yuanli sighed.

"There are actually many such traditions, but none are as demanding as this 'Upper Rite' Dao, which requires ninety percent of its spiritual objects. For example, 'True Fire' often needs a spiritual flame to gather Qi, but the difficulty of this Dao lies in being 'suspended and isolated.' It doesn't connect well with others, and there are no particularly close traditions. If you want to configure its spiritual objects… without some special methods, it is incredibly difficult. Moreover, with the 'floating nature of the Heavenly Empyrean,' these spiritual objects are not easy to preserve, which is why they have fallen to this state."

He said with a serious expression, "There's actually a corresponding Dao. My Daoist Tradition isn't very clear on it, but based on the correspondence, it's called the 'Lower Rite'. I heard it was taken over by the Underworld long ago, so it's not just rare; it's only slightly better than 'Exiled Qi'!"

He was deliberately trying to curry favor, and Li Zhouwei was quite pleased, nodding his head.

'The Twelve Qi seem to be complete…'

Li Zhouwei's thoughts raced. He considered, 'Que'Wan's Houshenshu once mentioned that she could modulate the Qi of the Two Rites. Does she mean the two Upper and Lower Rites of the Twelve Qi? If so, the relationship between 'Whole Pill' and Encompassing Profoundity is not shallow either!'

The Underworld is an obvious Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition. That means the Upper and Lower Rites are both Encompassing Profoundity positions. But why did the Underworld, an Encompassing Profoundity tradition, push for the fall of the Wanling Heaven and not care at all?

This was a profound matter that Li Zhouwei would pay close attention to. Si Yuanli had already taken out the jade bottle and asked, "The 'Upper Rite' dao lineage must still be on the Changxiao. I think he was afraid of alerting Cheng Yan and deliberately left one or two spiritual resources here to collect Qi… My fellow Daoist, do you know the use of this thing?"
