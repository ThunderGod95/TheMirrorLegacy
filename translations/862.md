# Chapter 862: Suppression

"Fellow Daoists!"

No sooner had the words been spoken than a figure stepped out of the Great Void. He had a full head of gray hair and wore black robes emblazoned with thousands of brown, eye-like circles that shimmered with a dark light in the emptiness.

This was clearly the Daoist Master Luo who had been mentioned earlier.

He first bowed to Kui Qi, his expression one of deep respect. "Greetings, my lord!" he said with a smile.

Kui Qi nodded, his face a cold mask. He then turned to Chen Yin, with whom he was obviously more familiar, and his expression softened into a smile. "It's been many years. Your cultivation has progressed once again, my friend!"

Chen Yin, unlike Kui Qi, returned the greeting with an amiable smile. Only then did Daoist Master Luo turn his attention to Li Ximing. The eye-like patterns on his robes seemed to ripple as he spoke with effusive enthusiasm. "So this is the renowned Daoist Master Zhaojing! I have long heard of your incredible deeds!"

It was difficult to be rude to someone so friendly, so Li Ximing responded politely, though he found the man's robes unsettling and avoided looking directly at them. Just then, Kui Qi's ice-cold voice echoed in his mind, transmitted via a divine ability.

'Zhaojing, this Luo is also from the Yue State, and he's no good. He consorts with demon beasts in the Southern Borderlands, rules over a shamanic kingdom, and refines any promising barbarian cultivators into that robe of his year after year. Be careful.'

'Still, you needn't worry about him defecting to the Buddhists. The Demon Kings despise him, and he has killed a Merciful One before. Just keep your distance.'

Li Ximing now understood the source of his unease. Observing more closely, he guessed that Daoist Master Luo was an Eastern Yue.

'He has the same habits as Fu Daomu from the lake all those years ago. Fu Daomu refined the Human Head Mountain... For Chen Yin to invite him here... he must have some leverage over him.'

No wonder Kui Qi was so cold. Wearing a Dharma robe like that, how could Kui Qi possibly give him a warm reception? The only reason Kui Qi wasn't already attacking was likely because the victims were barbarians from the Southern Borderlands, which lessened his disgust. Otherwise, a call to arms would have been likely.

'This man is truly testing the limits... dancing on the edge of a blade.'

Despite Kui Qi's frigid demeanor, Daoist Master Luo remained all smiles, his enthusiasm impeccable. When Kui Qi completed his divination, a hazy, colorful light emerged from the Great Void. It was as if a black cloth had been lifted, revealing a vast expanse of gold.

Luo glanced at it and understood. "It's the Wisdom-Void Demon-Subduing Grand Formation," he said in a low voice. "Zhelu is personally suppressing them from within. They must be holding out with the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion or the Rain-Watching Treasure Cauldron."

"This grand formation is anchored by a Maha using a spiritual artifact," he continued. "It can hide within the Great Void, but its formation eyes exist in the mortal world. All we need to do is shake it enough to distract them."

He had mentioned two powerful treasures in one breath. Li Ximing recalled that Tinglan also possessed the Supreme Minister's Gourd and the Immeasurable Water and Fire. If those two were brought out, even a Maha would likely have to retreat. No wonder the men before him were so unworried.

The light in Kui Qi’s hand faded. He turned and instructed, "The few of you here are under the protection of my spiritual artifact. As long as you don't move, those below won't be able to detect you in the Great Void. Wait for the opportune moment to strike!"

Below them, the rain over Xiaoshi Mountain dissipated, revealing traces of the multi-colored Buddhist Land.

"I will go first," Kui Qi said softly.

As his figure materialized above Xiaoshi Mountain, the golden light finally rippled. Before it could react, a horse-headed Maha leaped out, a wide grin splitting his face and revealing large, white teeth.

"Daoist Master Kui Qi!" he called out. "And who have you brought with you today?"

Li Ximing and the other two remained motionless in the Great Void, holding their positions. Li Ximing, however, fixed his gaze on the Maha, a thought taking root in his mind.

'So this is Taixi... my clan's mortal enemy.'

As expected, the moment Taixi appeared, Kui Qi's expression turned savage. He raised his Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, his silence more menacing than any threat.

Suddenly, the void rumbled, and four golden-bodied Merciful Ones appeared, each holding a different Dharma instrument. In that same instant, Chen Yin drew his sword and vanished.

Taixi’s smile froze. His two horse-like ears pricked up, listening intently. A flash of silver light erupted as a slender sword materialized behind him, tearing through the void with a piercing glint.

"Chen Yin!"

Without a second thought, Taixi’s Dharma body swelled dramatically in the air. No longer seated cross-legged, he soared on a colored cloud as a purple-black alms bowl shot out, attempting to block the blade.

But Chen Yin was no ordinary cultivator. The slender sword tapped lightly on the bowl, and the sound of a great flood filled the heavens and earth. The Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl let out a violent hum as a torrent of white rain fell, causing Taixi’s Dharma body to sizzle wherever it struck.

Taixi immediately withdrew, raising the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl to catch the celestial water. He brandished a staff to counter Chen Yin's swordsmanship, his mind racing with confusion.

'Isn't Chen Yin in the Southern Borderlands? Wasn't he at daggers drawn with Daoist Master Zhusheng, fighting over a spiritual artifact? The Changxiao Gate has made no move, so how dares his Chen Clan cross the river?!'

Kui Qi did not fear Taixi, but Taixi was confident he could handle him. The Maha Zhelu had long since deduced that Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin, was on good terms with Hengzhu and shouldn't have intervened. Furthermore, his conflict with Daoist Master Zhusheng of the Shahuan Kingdom in the Southern Borderlands, compounded by pressure from that Daoist Master Luo, gave him the perfect excuse to decline. How could he have crossed the river?

The sword sects were conservative. Although an anomaly like Lingmei had appeared, it was still exceedingly difficult for them to act. The only one with a firm stance was Li Ximing, but he had been driven to the Eastern Sea. And who knew where Changxiao was? How could he possibly show up?

This was why Taixi had been left outside the formation to face their enemies. The sudden appearance of Chen Yin told him that things had gone terribly wrong. He desperately called for aid while urging the others on. "Quickly, stop him!"

The four Merciful Ones froze.

Dealing with Zhu Gong was one thing, but was Kui Qi on the same level as Zhu Gong? It wasn't just a matter of two extra divine abilities. All of Zhu Gong's possessions combined weren't worth a single one of Kui Qi's spiritual artifacts!

Furthermore, Kui Qi was a Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery. His methods weren't simple physical combat. The Xiukui were known as one of the three great ancient shamanic Daoist traditions; fighting them could lead to the utter annihilation of both body and soul!

Yet, the Maha had given an order. How could they refuse? They could only brace themselves and advance, each one looking more timid than the last, as if ready to self-destruct their Dharma bodies and flee at any moment.

As expected, a cold glint appeared in Kui Qi's eyes. He suspected Taixi had other tricks up his sleeve and didn't rush to call out Li Ximing and the others. Instead, he stood his ground, holding the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, and then swung.

Simultaneously, a powerful black wind swept up, tearing the colorful light from the four Merciful Ones' golden bodies. A black chain descended from the sky, striking like a viper from the shadows.

A chill ran down their necks. The leading elder Merciful One had already returned to the Buddhist Land, leaving the others in disarray. Only the six-armed Merciful One, the strongest among them, roared and charged forward, but the black chain coiled around him in an instant, trapping him in mid-air.

The bronze-like Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword flickered in and out of sight within the gray wind. A low shout echoed: "Freeze!"

A point of cold light flared in the black wind. The remaining three Merciful Ones scrambled back, each faster than the last, as Daoist Master Kui Qi's form dissipated and reformed in a sudden, explosive burst of speed.

A massive hand materialized from the black wind, seizing one of the golden-bodied Merciful Ones by the neck. The Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, held in his other hand, plunged down from above, piercing the crown of its skull. With a vicious twist, like a priest slaughtering a sacrifice, he drove it deeper.

Whatever divine ability he used, the Merciful One let out a soul-tearing scream. Kui Qi's expression remained unchanged, though the whites of his eyes grew more prominent.

"A Merciful One who's cultivated for a few decades, leading three worthless novices, and you dare to obstruct me? Do you really think you're all elites like Nuzi or Minghui, sitting at the foot of the Lotus Throne!"

Zhu Gong had no experience fighting the Northern Buddhists, but how could Kui Qi not? He had attacked with his full strength from the start, unleashing two spiritual artifacts and three divine abilities at once!

He kept his grip on the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, letting the Merciful One howl in agony. Pinned by the black chain, it couldn't move. The other three watched in terror as Kui Qi laughed.

"The smart one sacrificed himself early and returned to the Buddhist Land to avoid my Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword! Only you four fools are left waiting to die!"

The impact of his words was immense. Not only did the remaining three Merciful Ones freeze, but even Taixi's expression changed. The one impaled on the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword finally broke, his courage shattered by pain and fear. Why wait for death when he could save himself? Countless golden cracks spiderwebbed across his golden body.

*Boom!*

A magnificent burst of rainbow light filled the sky. Kui Qi had already withdrawn using his Body Divine Ability. He coughed twice, then laughed aloud and cursed, "Fool!"

The Xiukui's Daoist tradition was esoteric, with few direct, fatal techniques in frontal combat. By goading his opponent, Kui Qi had conserved his own trump cards. The remaining three, terrified and confused, hesitated. This gave him the opening to raise his sword and strike at the golden light.

*Boom!*

The sword blow sent shudders through the golden light, as if striking something immense. Above, a faint radiance began to descend, clouds swirling around it. The commotion had clearly alerted those inside the formation.

Taixi’s face was utterly grim. He could only shout one name: "Vija!"

At his call, a shaft of colorful light descended from the heavens. Within it, illusions of men and women sitting in opposition flickered, accompanied by the roars of fighting jackals. A golden figure dropped from the light. One half of his face was a mask of hatred and jealousy, while the other was lost in melancholy, a truly fearsome sight.

'The Way of Great Desire's Vija...'

Kui Qi's expression finally turned serious as he eyed the golden figure.

Taixi had been a second-generation Maha during the North-South war. The Way of Emptiness had benefited from that conflict, and in the years since, he had reached his third reincarnation, making him a formidable opponent. He could hold his own against a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. But the one before Kui Qi now had been reincarnated five times and was far stronger. As that strange half-face looked over, a droning voice spoke.

"Daoist Master Kui Qi! I have no desire to interfere in this matter. We will not endanger the lives of the two Daoist Masters... we only wish to prevent divine abilities from wreaking havoc in Jiangbei and causing needless casualties. If you withdraw now, it would be an act of great merit..."

Hearing this, Kui Qi began to understand.

Vija was clearly reluctant to get too deeply involved. Years ago, Purple Smoke Gate and Azure Pond Sect had joined forces to steal his Qi Wang Profound-Heaven Hearing. He was here now because of that karmic debt. If Kui Qi had passed the Purple Mystery tribulation and possessed four divine abilities to go with his spiritual artifacts, Vija would have turned and fled without hesitation. But as things stood, Vija was strong enough to suppress him, so he had shown up.

Kui Qi merely sneered and shook his head. He raised the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword and said casually, "I have never tested the divine abilities of a five-reincarnation Maha! Today, I shall ask for your guidance!"

Right now, Kui Qi’s only option was to stall Vija. After all, he was the only one present who could contend with this five-reincarnation Maha. He began to feel fortunate that he hadn't revealed himself immediately. If they had all appeared at once, their opponents would have surely sent this Maha to deal with Chen Yin while Taixi tied him down, which would have been a disaster. Fortunately, he had seized the initiative and avoided the worst-case scenario.

'The Chen Clan is on good terms with Hengzhu. Logically, Vija wouldn't want to create such a deep karmic feud... so he will likely focus on me. But one must always be prepared for the unexpected.'

With a solemn gaze, he summoned his spiritual artifact.

Seeing this, Taixi began to gain the upper hand against Chen Yin, forcing him back. "So, this is all a Lin is capable of!" he laughed.

Kui Qi remained silent. But just then, the golden light of the formation flickered, and a small, sinister-looking dagger carved from beast bone descended from the Great Void, smashing into the light and unleashing a shockwave.

At the same time, a man in a white-gold Daoist robe appeared, the Profound Light in the center of his forehead flashing. A beam of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light—brilliant as snow and blindingly intense—shot from the Great Void, trailing purple flames as it slammed into the golden light.

*Buzz!*

The golden light flickered erratically. The three remaining Merciful Ones had just started to move closer when a gray-haired man in a black robe covered in a thousand spotted eyes materialized, holding a small, white jade hammer. He followed close behind the first attack, tapping the handle of the bone dagger.

*Clang!*

Daoist Master Luo was clearly skilled. The golden light shuddered on the verge of collapse, revealing its true form: an eight-spoked Dharma wheel, golden in its entirety, with a hollow center studded with various gems.

But the hammer strike seemed to have triggered something. A chorus of chanting echoed from the Great Void, and three more golden-bodied Merciful Ones emerged from the formation. The one in the lead had a third eye in the center of his forehead, giving him a commanding presence. Their faces were serene as they shouted, "Vile demon!"

An old demon like Daoist Master Luo wasn't about to be caught so easily. He had been prepared. The moment his hammer struck, he dissolved into a gray wind, and the three Merciful Ones lunged at empty air.

Li Ximing was farther away. Seeing three more golden bodies suddenly appear, he immediately flew off, a trail of purple fire shielding him from the shining holy light.

Taixi, who was handling Chen Yin with ease, was still able to observe the battlefield. The appearance of a Bright Yang cultivator stunned and confused him. "Li Ximing!" he cried out in shock.

'He's back from overseas! Where is Changxiao?!'

The gazes of the three Merciful Ones shifted almost simultaneously. Seven eyes on three golden bodies all locked onto him, a mixture of surprise, shock, and even a faint greed in their expressions. In unison, they abandoned the gray wind and gave chase.

"A remnant of the Wei-Li traitors! You dare show your face in the north? Surrender your life!"

Taixi, keeping a close watch on the situation, had been utterly stunned by Daoist Master Luo's appearance. The truth finally dawned on him.

"Damn it! These cultivators are a bunch of actors!"

Fortunately, the retreating Daoist Master Luo was intercepted by his own Merciful Ones, which allowed the Maha to breathe a sigh of relief. He then turned his attention to Li Ximing. But unlike the Merciful Ones' elation, a chill went down Taixi's spine when he saw their expressions.

'He cultivates Audience with the Celestial Gate... Merciful Ones are clumsy by nature, and these three fools haven't even reached the Developing Wisdom throne... yet they're rushing headlong into his trap!'

'Never mind... even if they can't win, it's enough to just tie down that Radiant Pass...'

This was Li Ximing's first time fighting a Merciful One, and he couldn't gauge their true strength. He simply flicked his sleeve and flew on a trail of light and flame. The Profound Light on his forehead pulsed, and the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light flared once more.

The brilliant beam didn't aim for the three-eyed Merciful One in the center, but instead veered slightly, striking like a meteor at the one who was a step slower. The Merciful One raised his sword to block.

*Sizzle!*

Sparks of fire erupted. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, which Li Ximing had cultivated for years, struck the side of the Dharma sword. Instead of dissipating as it usually did, it deflected and shot towards the Merciful One's face.

The Merciful One only had time to squeeze his eyes shut and duck his head slightly, taking the blast on his cheek. The brilliant white light managed to burn a finger-sized hole straight through his left cheek.

With that one exchange, Li Ximing gained a measure of confidence.

'The one in the lead might be trouble, but the two on the sides are clumsy. Without the support of Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities, their Dharma bodies are just a bit tough. They're not even as strong as Fuxia from the lake back then!'

To Li Ximing, these so-called golden bodies were only slightly stronger than a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who specialized in spell arts, similar to himself. If the Wrathful Manifestation hadn't died, Fuxia would have been among the elite of the Merciful Ones, far beyond these three.

His confidence surged. He raised a hand, and a perfectly round bead appeared in his palm, engraved with the image of a tiger looking over its shoulder. It was the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger.

A soft, silken, earthy-yellow light instantly emerged, forming a screen in front of him, just in time to meet the short staff of the three-eyed Merciful One!

*Thud!*

The Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen had been useless against Changxiao, but against this Merciful One, it finally held firm. Though the light dimmed, it had withstood the blow.

Li Ximing seized the opportunity, bringing two fingers to his lips to channel his divine flames. Seeing this, his opponents knew they couldn't let him cast his spell. They attacked from front and back, swinging their weapons.

The Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen blocked one more sword strike before shattering. As the final golden hammer descended with immense force, Li Ximing flickered away on a ray of Profound Light. A faint yellow film covered his body, deflecting the Dharma instrument. His wrist stung, but he was otherwise unharmed!

This was the second wondrous ability of the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger—Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption!

Li Ximing then drew upon his flames, his lips parting slightly to exhale a stream of fire.

The flame was blazing red on the outside, with a white and gold core. It shot out with incredible speed, blossoming in the air into a golden whip laced with red that swept towards his enemies.

The Purple Mansion Realm spirit flame, Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire!

The three immediately leaped back. The one with the hammer had managed to touch Li Ximing, but it had cost him half a second. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire first struck his hammer, engulfing it in a burst of sparks before splashing onto his golden arm.

"Aargh!"

A howl echoed through the air. The Merciful One reappeared some distance away, his arm now being consumed by a purely golden flame that burned countless holes in it. Some were as large as a longan fruit, others like a rash of tiny, writhing black dots.

It was impossible to misunderstand. They instantly realized their mistake.

"We were careless! A Purple Mansion Realm flame... it's a True Fire!"

True Fire, after all, was not Merging Fire or Li Fire. It couldn't cling to its target like a stubborn disease, nor could it burn indefinitely. The wounds it caused were easier to heal. However, its power lay in its instantaneous explosive force, which was truly formidable. Even the golden hammer used to block it had its engravings blurred by the heat, its power clearly diminished.

"This..."

Li Ximing was taken aback, a complex mix of emotions washing over him.

In his few battles after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, his opponents had either been mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters with three divine abilities, or late-stage Great Daoist Masters who had crossed the Purple Mystery threshold—and all of them were disciples of Encompassing Profoundity. They had beaten him so badly he'd barely escaped with his life.

Now, armed with a spirit flame, an improved cultivation, and his trump cards, he was facing Merciful Ones who weren't even a match for an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. The shock of it all sent a jolt of confidence through him, and his eyes lit up.

'If the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire is this effective, what about the Flame of Final Return? And what about the Lustful Merging Fire, which even the Nine Hills Daoist tradition coveted?'

Li Ximing was momentarily stunned, but he couldn't miss this chance. He took a step forward, the light on his forehead flaring again!

The three-eyed Merciful One frowned, clearly finding him to be a troublesome opponent. The closed eye on his forehead snapped open, shooting a beam of golden light to counter the Profound Light from Li Ximing's own forehead. He swung both of his short staves and shouted, "Form the array!"

The other two quickly exhaled, taking their positions on colored clouds. But Li Ximing still had the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass up his sleeve; he was perfectly calm. Flames of intertwined purple and gold ignited in both of his hands.

Sun's Resonant Parting Art!

This was a spell art inherited from Li Jiangqian, one of the best the Li family possessed. Li Ximing had mastered it himself. He unleashed a parting light that blocked their attacks while the earthy-yellow Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen flared up around him once more.

The three-eyed Merciful One remained unfazed. The three of them opened their mouths in unison, spitting out a cloud of golden sand that filled the air.

Did they think he would be afraid of this? Spirit flames refined metal. Unless these monks could spit out Purple Mansion Realm-grade precious metals, none of it could stand up to a True Fire. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire bloomed again, forming a protective barrier that kept the golden sand at bay.

Li Ximing directed his Profound Light and purple fire, once again striking at the hammer-wielding Merciful One.

Unexpectedly, a holy light shone from the Merciful One's body. Although the Profound Light dissolved it and the purple fire burned his torso until golden blood flowed, he stood unshaken, continuing to spit golden sand.

Li Ximing instantly grew alert. A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed that the golden sand they were spitting was indeed growing stronger. Looking up, he saw streams of colored light descending from the sky, stretching deep into the Great Void. As they set up their formation, they were channeling the brilliance of the Buddhist Land through the Great Void!

"Heh!"

Li Ximing was not one for pleasantries. He stared for a moment, then let out a cold laugh.

'An array? Fine! How dare you set up this kind of array in front of me! You're courting death!'

With a thought, a golden glint shone in his eyes. A great wind howled as an ornate, brilliant white celestial gate emerged from the Great Void, adorned with rainbow clouds. Banners fluttered as troops in golden armor descended, illuminating the entire mountain range so brightly that even the distant combatants couldn't help but look over.

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

The divine ability descended with immense power, drilling out from the rainbow clouds like an ever-expanding mountain range, soaring into the heavens. Its power ground down and suppressed the flow of their own abilities, and the colored light above the three Merciful Ones was instantly crushed.

Not even three breaths passed before a loud crack echoed. The connection of colored light between them was snapped. The three grimacing Merciful Ones were all forced a step back, and the two weaker ones even coughed up golden dust.

*Boom!*

Amidst the swirling rainbow clouds and the clamor of troops, the Audience with the Celestial Gate stood firm. The Daoist Master in white and gold stood atop it. Two colossal, intricately carved white pillars descended, pressing down on the three figures until they were like ants pinned beneath the gate!

In an instant, the tables had turned!

"In all my years of cultivation, I've only ever been the one suppressing others! Who cultivates the Audience with the Celestial Gate—me, Li Ximing, or you three monks? You dare try to suppress me?!"
