# Chapter 870: The Meeting

Zongquan Island.

The waters of the Vermillion Sea shimmered, an iridescent blend of azure and crimson beneath the sapphire sky. It was exceptionally beautiful. Two fishing boats drifted quietly on the water, their pale yellow sails raised, gliding toward a patch of ocean where seagulls wheeled and gathered.

A bright light converged at the zenith. A man in a platinum-gold Daoist robe descended with the light, materializing before the island’s great array. The common folk on the island looked up, their faces filled with curiosity.

Zongquan Island had known peace for many years. The people lived and worked contentedly. Thanks to their relationship with the Huiyao, the fishermen even dared to sail the surrounding waters freely. Consequently, they held little fear of cultivators. Li Ximing swept his gaze over them before passing through the array and into the main hall.

Inside, an old man in white robes, his face a web of wrinkles and his hair sparse, was slumped over a desk. His head hung low, seemingly overcome with exhaustion. Not until the bright light materialized within the hall did the old man startle as if waking from a dream. He scrambled to his feet, threw himself to the floor, and trembled like chaff in the wind.

"Greetings, Divine Ability! Greetings, Daoist Master!"

This was Zong Yan, the administrator of the island and one of the earth-nurtured children at the Qi Refining level. He was ancient now. Having grown up on Zongquan Island and experienced the terror of having no protector, he held high-level cultivators in profound awe, to say nothing of a Daoist Master. He remained pressed firmly to the ground, kneeling rigidly.

Li Ximing merely retrieved the main family’s token from his sleeve, tossed it to the man, and ordered, "Go and summon the Heir."

Zong Yan scrambled to his feet, grabbed a jade talisman from the desk, and crushed it. He immediately returned to his kneeling position. Li Ximing asked, "How is Zongquan faring these days?"

Zong Yan hurried to answer. "Thanks to the main family’s blessings, we produced two cultivation seedlings. They were sent to the Lake for advanced training. We are just... just waiting to see if one of them is willing to return in a couple of years..."

Although Zongquan Island was much improved, compared to Moongaze Lake, it was still a desolate backwater. Unless the Lake dispatched a direct descendant to stand guard, no cultivator was willing to come here. In all these years, the few talented individuals they had managed to produce were all sent to the Lake’s Jade Court, and none had ever spoken of returning.

These seedlings were ashamed to even mention Zongquan, and since the Li family had not publicly acknowledged the island, they continued their cultivation at the Lake. Li Ximing listened to this and shook his head. "Don't worry," he replied. "They will all return."

In truth, Zongquan Island was actually safer for Li Zhouwei than Moongaze Lake. If he achieved his breakthrough here, the island itself would undergo a heaven-and-earth-shattering transformation. The spiritual veins would certainly become incomparably richer. This is why Li Ximing spoke with such confidence.

However, Zong Yan completely misunderstood his intent. He kowtowed hastily, terrified. "That... that wasn't a complaint! The children... they are very good to their families here..."

Li Ximing paused, then chuckled and shook his head, deciding not to mention Li Zhouwei. He chatted idly with the old man for a while, listening to him ramble on about how Li Yuanjiao had saved Zongquan all those years ago. Finally, another bright light descended from the sky and landed before the hall.

The light dissipated, revealing a youth with golden eyes, clad in golden-white scale armor, a Profound Pattern Vase hanging from his waist. As he reached the hall entrance, his eyes lit up, and he bowed deeply. "Minghuang greets the Daoist Master! Congratulations on the advancement of your divine abilities..."

Seeing him, Li Ximing let out a long breath of relief. He walked quickly toward the youth, shaking his head with a smile. "Look at you... why all the formality? Come, come..."

Zong Yan tactfully excused himself, closing the doors behind him as the array isolated the hall. Li Ximing knew Li Zhouwei must have used the Immortal Mirror to scan the area before approaching Zongquan, so he felt safe to speak freely. He sighed.

"Stop with this 'Daoist Master' talk. You were the one who fought your way out of the Lake and managed to kill Situ Mo, eliminating that great scourge. I, on the other hand, had a wretched journey... If Changxiao hadn't been intercepted midway, I would have already dissipated into a patch of Profound Light, scattered across the outer sea."

"But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. After scrambling around out there, I managed to heal my injuries, and my cultivation didn't fall too far behind. I even obtained a wisp of Purple Mansion True Fire and forged a connection with Nine Mounds..."

Li Zhouwei repeatedly insisted he didn't deserve the praise. Even so, seeing Li Ximing safe and sound—and having clearly gained significant benefits—he finally relaxed. He respectfully presented a jade box with both hands. "The Daoist Master is the one who preserved the clan. This junior merely benefited from that protection and was lucky to escape. But... without performing the proper rites or sacrifices, I presumptuously used the clan's treasured spirit sword. This junior requests punishment..."

Li Ximing knew it contained Qingchi. He accepted it gently. "Nonsense!"

But Li Zhouwei wasn't finished. He waited until Li Ximing had secured Qingchi before continuing, "As for Changxiao being intercepted... it was Lady Qinghong who took action."

Li Ximing had never expected to hear Li Qinghong’s name. He froze, a mixture of shock and joy flooding him. "Aunt? Aunt Qinghong has reached the Purple Mansion Realm? No wonder... no wonder the rainstorms were so violent that day, the thunder incessant. Changxiao was so sinister and powerful... did she escape unharmed? Is she... Dragon-kin?"

Li Zhouwei nodded, his voice low. "Exactly. In the duel within that Lightning Dao Grotto-Heaven, Lady Qinghong slew all her peers skilled in lightning laws, ascended to the absolute peak, and transformed into the Thunder Body that devours lightning. She is now a Purple Mansion spirit cultivator, the same as Dongfang Heyun."

"Unfortunately, she cannot move freely. She has marked out a territory for herself beyond Crimson Reef Island, calling it the Lie Sea, where she guards the Thunder Pool. At that time, the Daoist Master was battling Changxiao all across the outer sea, and their fight passed near her territory, so she intervened!"

Li Ximing was speechless. He closed his eyes, his voice catching slightly as he whispered, "I... I can finally give the Old Master an answer."

The news about Li Qinghong was unquestionably the greatest news since his own breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. Li Zhouwei also smiled, giving Li Ximing a moment to absorb it before speaking softly again. "Thinking back, Dongfang Heyun formed a connection with our family so early on. It’s hard to say if he knew something like this would happen in the future... wanting to foster good relations with a colleague... After all, that man shares the same lifespan as the Dragon Monarch. Don't be fooled just because most of the Dragon-kin can order him around. He holds many secrets."

Hearing this, Li Ximing was struck by a chilling realization. "If that's the case, then Aunt is already deeply involved in the machinations behind the lightning-devouring incident that the Dragon-kin are participating in. She certainly can't extricate herself... No wonder she can't contact the family. If our family got entangled in that... it would mean total annihilation."

Li Zhouwei’s voice grew quieter. "As for that senior in Jiangbei... it is the Great Ancestor."

"Great Ancestor?!"

"Li Qianyuan!"

Li Zhouwei’s expression was grim as he recounted everything Dongfang Lieyun had told him. Li Ximing was utterly horrified. He stood stunned for a long time before understanding finally dawned. "No wonder..." he muttered, his gaze distant. "No wonder Tinglan told me not to return, despite all the trouble in Jiangnan... No wonder the Great Xiukui Monastery warned me not to interfere! It had nothing to do with the Supreme Yang dominating things. It was simply because our family’s identity is toxic!"

One event after another flashed through his mind. His face darkened. "Is the Great Ancestor truly without consciousness? But the Bright Yang Dao places heavy emphasis on hierarchy and bloodline. Even if he lacks awareness, how could a mighty Golden Core expert be completely oblivious to his own descendants?"

"Chen Yang... Chen Yang also has Li blood! His lineage is actually very close to the source. When he went to the riverbank, the True Monarch immediately saw him as prime material. Could that also be related? A natural, inherent favorability..."

After hearing this analysis, Li Zhouwei frowned. "If that’s the case... all the other major powers are watching. I fear this has already become collaborating evidence for those trying to deduce the truth."

Li Ximing's thoughts grew increasingly tangled and complex. "Our family must avoid suspicion," he whispered. "No wonder everyone I met warned me not to touch this... I fear there is no telling how many Daoist Masters, or even True Monarchs, are currently watching our family."

Li Zhouwei nodded grimly. Li Ximing’s thoughts, however, were growing clearer. "The karmic debt between the Buddhist cultivators and our family has reached such proportions—even the fundamental cultivation method of the Buddhist Land was derived from the Wei Li family. How could they *not* want to eradicate us to settle the cause and effect? From Lord Tongya to Lord Xuanling, and then to Lord Xuanfeng... I fear many of them are hoping to 'convert' our family into the Buddhist Land, just like that Undefeated King of Brightness!"

The memory of how those Merciful Ones had looked at him like frenzied zealots was still vivid. If Lingmei hadn't been there to suppress them, Li Ximing would likely have been injured again. He recounted these recent events, his expression turning cold. "The Northern Buddhists are our greatest enemy. This karmic destiny is inescapable. Even I am in grave danger!"

Li Zhouwei was deeply worried. "That is exactly why. I feel I cannot wait another day, especially after hearing about those Maha... Every day I reach the Purple Mansion Realm sooner is perhaps one fraction more leeway we will have."

Li Ximing took his words to heart, feeling the weight of the threat even more keenly. He gradually calmed his emotions. There was more to discuss, but what he most wanted to know right now was the progress of Li Zhouwei’s secret arts. With considerable anticipation, he asked, "The *Radiant Essence Scripture*. The secret arts within it are difficult, but they shouldn't be much of an obstacle for you. Counting the time since you left the Lake... you've had perhaps three solid years of stable cultivation. How many have you completed?"

When he mentioned this, a bright smile finally crossed Li Zhouwei's face. "Reporting to the Daoist Master: my cultivation base was sufficient, so I tested all nine secret arts first. Among them, the [Imperial Command] is already complete. As for [Myriad Arms Prefecture] and [Great Fissure], I... already have cultivation in them..."

'Already has cultivation in them? Meaning he didn't even need to train them; they were already complete?'

Li Ximing looked like he wanted to speak but stopped himself, his expression complicated. Li Zhouwei continued, "On my way here from the Hetian Sea, I cultivated both [Myriad Arms Prefecture] and [Great Fissure] concurrently, and both have been successfully mastered..."

"Ah?"

That single sentence struck Li Ximing like a bolt of lightning. He stared in disbelief. "Cultivated [Myriad Arms Prefecture] and [Great Fissure]? You can cultivate two arts *simultaneously*?"

Li Ximing recalled his own youthful arrogance. Before attempting [Primal Yang], he had sensed the difficulty and estimated he could finish all nine arts within a century. But after spending several years just to complete [Primal Yang], he discovered that the secret arts *repelled* one another. Cultivating them grew exponentially harder. He abandoned the idea of finishing in a century; it wasn't just impossible, he found he couldn't make any progress on the subsequent arts at all.

But if they could be trained simultaneously... Why had he wasted so much effort tackling them one by one? Wouldn't cultivating them sequentially just hinder each other? If he had trained them all together, waiting for all nine to complete at once, wouldn't it have been vastly more efficient? He asked urgently, "Since you can cultivate them simultaneously, don't tackle them one by one! The secret arts conflict with each other; your progress will inevitably slow down. Even with your abnormal talent, by the time you reach the sixth or seventh art... it will probably take years for each one. If you cultivate eight, or even seven, arts concurrently and complete them all together, the total time spent will be drastically reduced!"

Li Zhouwei nodded. "The Daoist Master's thinking is sound. This junior was also worried early on that since [Imperial Command] was already complete, it would vastly increase the difficulty of the remaining arts. My estimates were extremely conservative. However, following your instructions, I first cultivated [Heavenly Lamp] to increase the training speed of the others... yet I discovered... there is no repulsion between the arts at all. In fact, they seem to complement each other. The more I train, the faster I get..."

Li Ximing froze, speechless. Only then did the realization hit him. "No wonder you can train them concurrently."

Li Zhouwei let him process this for a moment before continuing. "This junior completed [Imperial Command] and [Myriad Arms Prefecture] sequentially and noticed a difference. Among the other six arts, [Imperial Command] commands [Great Fissure] and [Primal Yang]. [Myriad Arms Prefecture] links [Heavenly Lamp], [Jewel Steps], and the [Art of Returning Fold]. They actually boost one another..."

"As a result, my cultivation speed became divine. With these two systems completed, I have now mastered seven secret arts. Only [Golden Qilin] and [Red Cicada] remain untouched."

"Seven arts?!"

"Correct."

Li Zhouwei said gravely, "[Imperial Command] is immensely useful. This junior estimates... if I hadn't been inherently born with those arts linked to [Imperial Command], it would have been significantly harder. By my calculations, if I had started cultivating from the Way of Emptiness, it would have taken a full ten years to reach this level of progress."

And Li Ximing, whose talent in the Bright Yang Dao was considered exceptional even among Purple Mansion experts, had spent more than ten years completing just three...

Li Ximing’s expression was indescribably complex. Li Zhouwei came with three arts innately mastered. Even if one counted those as being completed on the road from the Hetian Sea, he had still managed to master four *more* arts in just three or four years... He let out a long sigh. "This... is the destiny of one born and nurtured by heaven and earth!"

"Then, the remaining two..."

At Li Ximing's question, Li Zhouwei replied thoughtfully, "That is precisely why I sought out the Daoist Master. Those remaining two are completely different. Not only are they extremely difficult to inscribe onto the Immortal foundation, but I also feel a significant resistance from them. While I estimate I could complete them if I spent several more years, that is far too long to delay... So, I sought you out. I intend to abandon the remaining two arts and break through to the Purple Mansion Realm immediately!"

Li Ximing stroked his beard, quickly recovering from the shock. He nodded slightly. "However... we currently have no Bright Yang Purple Mansion spiritual objects available. Fortunately, I have a few high-grade Bright Yang pills meant to assist a Purple Mansion breakthrough. They are relatively gentle. They should be able to help you push your Immortal foundation into the Shengyang Acupoint."

As he spoke, he retrieved a small box from his storage bag. Placing it in his palm, he opened it gently, revealing three immaculate white pills that looked as if they were covered in fine scales. They were precisely the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill.

"When I broke through, I used a single pill derived from two Bright Yang treasure medicines. By the time I reached the Juque acupoint, I was on my own. One of these pills should be more than enough for you. I will leave you two, just in case."

This was a Purple Mansion-grade spirit pill, infinitely better than the one Li Ximing had used. Using it would likely waste much of its medicinal potency. Li Zhouwei frowned and tried to refuse, but matters of a Purple Mansion breakthrough allowed for zero negligence. Li Ximing pressed it on him firmly. Li Zhouwei finally relented, accepting only one pill and insisting it was enough.

He then said seriously, "I will give the Daoist Master a stone talisman. If my breakthrough is successful, I will crush it immediately as a signal. Then... I will proceed to the Lake."

He took out the talisman, then retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, handing this back to Li Ximing. Before he could speak, Li Ximing saw the slip and immediately looked awkward. "Oh... this... this thing..."

This was the very jade slip upon which Li Ximing had enthusiastically written over a hundred thousand characters detailing his insights into [Primal Yang]. Looking back now, it seemed like utter nonsense.

Li Zhouwei, however, said gravely, "My own insights from this cultivation session have already been written down and recorded in the latter half of this slip, merging our notes into one volume. Please, Daoist Master, keep it safe. Let it serve as part of our clan’s heritage."
