# Chapter 1248: Readiness

He gazed at the golden divine ability in his palm, sighed softly, and took a step out of the Great Void. Suddenly sensing something, a hint of surprise surfaced on his face.

‘This is quite the karmic affinity. My divine ability is complete, just as someone has successfully achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm! The Vast Ocean…’

This familiar immortal foundation made him sigh inwardly. He pinched his fingers to calculate and mused.

‘It makes sense… Harmonising Metal has accumulated Vault Metal, and Harmonising Metal carries the meaning of fullness. To infer the Vast Ocean from that is well within profound principles…’

But as he briefly extended his senses, his expression shifted slightly, a look of shock in his eyes.

‘It’s an old friend!’

This filled him with anticipation, delaying his original plan to travel to the great desert. He took a step and landed upon the green mountain where five streams formed an array. True enough, he saw the cave dwelling high above, water burbling with a profound and graceful mystery.

An old man with graying hair was walking out, a sword strapped to his back, his gaze gentle yet firm. One could still faintly make out the features of his youth. He stopped on the mountainside, looking up at the sky as if a lifetime had passed.

‘To think… this old man would see the day he achieved an immortal foundation…’

Those old eyes were much brighter than before, yet they were filled with confusion and a heavy weight.

This man was none other than Chen Donghe!

As one of the Li Clan’s most senior elders and the long-standing patriarch of the Chen Clan, Chen Donghe's status and prestige were exceedingly high. He had watched his old friends pass away one by one and had long ago accepted his own fate.

If anyone from that generation had a chance to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, Chen Donghe felt, both logically and emotionally, that it should have been Li Xuanxuan—he was the old master of the Li family, the elder of several Daoist Masters. It would have been perfectly reasonable for him to expend some precious spiritual resources on a breakthrough to extend his life by another century!

And yet, it was him, Chen Donghe.

‘The Vast Ocean!’

It felt like a joke played by fate. He had used this very cultivation method, the one the Li Clan was founded upon, to gather qi for the clan’s first Daoist Master. In doing so, he had missed his own window for cultivation, remaining stuck forever at the peak of Qi Refining. Now, because of that same Daoist Master and that same immortal foundation, he was able to take one last step before death and achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm.

But as the immortal foundation settled into his sea of qi and the mystical sensations of the Purple Mansion Realm vanished from his body, Chen Donghe still felt it was unreal.

‘How could it be me? And why… the me I am today!’

As a cultivator, and one of the most talented members of the Li family in his day, Chen Donghe had of course dreamed of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm. But he had never imagined it would be in his current, decrepit state. In his youth, he envisioned supporting Duke Tongya; later, he hoped to be a right hand to Yuanjiao. As the years passed, he entertained thoughts of protecting the younger generation. In the last few decades, however, those ambitions had faded into almost nothing.

The Li Clan no longer lacked for Foundation Establishment cultivators; in fact, assigning a spirit mountain to each new one had become a logistical challenge. It certainly had no need for an old one who was too feeble to fight.

This immortal foundation had come too late. Had he received it at fifty, Chen Donghe could have served as a pillar of the clan, protecting Lijing. But now, even after his breakthrough, he still could not find his place.

‘Just as they have no need for another Qi Refining cultivator like me.’

Even with his life extended by a hundred years, he stood on the peak, lost and disheartened, until a golden radiance lit up the horizon. A Daoist Master arrived, treading through the air. Chen Donghe bowed by force of habit.

“Greetings, Daoist Master!”

Liu Changdie glanced at the old man before him, feeling he was vastly different from his memories. After a moment of silence, Li Wushao stepped forward with his divine ability, bowed, and said with a smile.

“Greetings, Daoist Master! Your success has truly been a great help to him!”

Liu Changdie was about to say more when he saw an old man rushing up the mountain, his hair completely white and his eyes filled with joy. A group of people followed behind him, all scrambling to offer their support.

Liu Changdie had grown much more familiar with Li Xuanxuan recently. His gaze was quite gentle, and he even gave a slight nod to the young master in red holding a fan who followed behind.

Li Zhouming was helping the old man and hurriedly paused to return the courtesy to the Purple Mansion cultivator, falling three or four steps behind. He then clamored to catch up, making Liu Changdie chuckle and shake his head. His gaze, however, fell upon a youth strolling along behind the crowd.

This person was tall and slender, with a clear, transcendent air, long eyebrows, and gray eyes. Liu Changdie's gaze froze, unable to look away, and he stared for a long moment. The youth seemed to sense it and raised his brows to look over.

Liu Changdie met his eyes and was momentarily stunned, as if by a celestial being.

“What a magnificent bearing!”

His very first thought was of the Young Master Xijun from his past life.

‘The same first-class bearing, only much more reserved, not as dazzling. He also lacks that bitter cynicism and possesses more of an untethered, natural ease…’

‘That must be the sword immortal!’

As he pondered, the two old men had already embraced, their heads bowed. In contrast to Chen Donghe’s sense of loss, Li Xuanxuan seemed to be weeping with joy. He gripped the other’s hand and said.

“Donghe, you’ve made it… My heart can finally be at peace!”

The old man’s life had been extended with spiritual resources, so his complexion was still fair, but he was living on borrowed time. Seeing him so rarely radiant brought tears to Chen Donghe’s eyes.

“Even in the Foundation Establishment Realm… I can't contribute an iota of merit to the Lake. Empty is my gratitude. To live another hundred years just to miss old friends—the guilt is unspeakable!”

Li Xuanxuan simply held his hand tightly.

“What are you saying? With you here… there are certain affairs to be handled after I’m gone… I can rest much easier!”

Liu Changdie could not bear to watch the scene. He turned away, his hands clasped behind his back. The gloom in his heart from his severed Dao path actually lessened slightly. Those thoughts had spun in his mind for so long, yet now only a few bitter words remained.

‘At least I’m still useful…’

The thought had barely passed when Li Wushao approached and spoke in a low voice.

“Daoist Master… Daoist Master Zhaojing is refining a pill on the mountain. His Highness Changli has entered seclusion to cultivate. He left a message beforehand, saying that if you emerged, you could go to the great desert to cultivate…”

Liu Changdie collected himself, then shook his head with a gentle smile.

“Since Zhaojing is refining a pill on the mountain, I must naturally pay a visit. My Harmonising Metal divine ability is complete. It is called Heavenly Harmonising Fullness, and it can circulate the workings of qi to bring all things to a state of perfect completion! Though it clashes with Li Fire and the effect isn't optimal, it can still lighten Zhaojing's burden and save him several years.”

He took a single step and arrived on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Sure enough, flames raged furiously, and the golden pill furnace hung suspended in mid-air. Li Ximing’s face was pale, his head beaded with sweat. Beside him sat an old man who appeared to be cultivating.

The pill refinement was at a critical stage, and this mid-stage Purple Mansion Li Fire Daoist Master was clearly on edge. Though he seemed to be cultivating cross-legged, he would frequently look up, his brow furrowed in a frown at the furnace.

When Liu Changdie set foot in the area, the man shot to his feet, his eyes dark with suspicion. He gritted his teeth and demanded.

“Fellow Daoist, for what purpose have you come?”

Clearly, if anyone were to disturb Li Ximing at this moment, Daoist Master Ji'an was truly prepared to kill them!

Questioned in such a manner, Liu Changdie also sensed the warning in his tone. His voice was steady, neither loud nor soft.

“My divine ability is complete. I have come to assist Zhaojing.”

As these words drifted over, Li Ximing, who was seated cross-legged in the air, gave a slight nod. Only then did Daoist Master Ji'an step back, his brow still furrowed.

Liu Changdie was not offended. The radiance behind him slowly intensified as he stood in the air on the mountainside, his hands forming a seal.

Heavenly Harmonising Fullness!

Countless golden lights converged, circling around him for a moment before descending like a fine mist, blanketing the entire mountain forest. Li Ximing, his brow deeply creased, opened his eyes slightly, a look of surprise crossing his face.

He said nothing more, quickly immersing himself in the pill fire once again. All manner of wonders occurred as if aided by the heavens; even the divine ability emanating from him grew much brighter than before.

Daoist Master Ji'an’s expression softened considerably, a flicker of gratitude in his eyes. He sighed inwardly.

‘The Li Clan’s foundation… is truly profound!’

…

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

Brilliant light flickered between heaven and earth. A young man sat cross-legged at the center, his brows knitted tightly. Behind him, ever-changing phenomena manifested—one moment, a vast, rolling desert with a falling Celestial Gate; the next, a bright setting sun with a surging tide of blood-red light.

Just as the qi throughout his body condensed to its absolute limit, a crisp sound finally emerged from the quiet.

“Crack!”

This sound did not seem to manifest in the mortal world, nor did it echo in the Great Void. It was a profound rhythm, carrying with it an air of melancholic decline that caused the King of Wei to frown sharply, his face turning ashen.

Within his Shengyang Acupoint, it was as if glazed glass had shattered. A cascade of colors erupted into a field of radiance.

Imperial Observation of the Origin shattered!

This immortal foundation, having been raised into the Shengyang Acupoint, exploded with a boom. It transformed into a wondrous Bright Yang radiance that scattered throughout the acupoint. This power spread from his Shengyang Acupoint into the depths of his dharma body, causing the divine abilities within him to tremble unceasingly, showing faint signs of injury.

Li Zhouwei’s expression gradually calmed. His chest heaved once, and he abruptly spat out a mouthful of golden blood!

‘Failed to cross the Purple Mystery…’

Ever since making his decision, he had spent the past two years raising his immortal foundation. According to his plan, he had shattered Imperial Observation of the Origin, using its essence to fill his Shengyang Acupoint!

Of course, such a hasty breakthrough came at a price. While he had focused all his will on protecting his Shengyang Acupoint, the greater part of the backlash had spread to his dharma body. He had even intentionally allowed the three divine abilities within him to tremble, displaying signs of an unstable foundation.

After resting for several long breaths, Li Zhouwei finally stood. He carefully inspected his condition and revealed a look of satisfaction.

‘Not bad…’

This was precisely the effect he had wanted.

‘The injury looks natural enough; it’s fine to leave it. In the time that remains… I will refine another Imperial Observation of the Origin and store it secretly in my sea of qi. While nourishing it with Talisman Qi, I can then deploy troops against Luoxia!’

‘My first Imperial Observation of the Origin took less than three years to complete. This next one will only be faster. Add the two years spent raising the immortal foundation to the Shengyang Acupoint, and the total time can be kept within five years… which leaves five years to conquer Luoxia.’

“More than enough time.”

However, now was not the time for seclusion. He still had matters to arrange, not to mention the second Imperial Sun-March Sha had yet to be delivered!

So he rose and stepped out of the courtyard. Li Que'wan was seated cross-legged in cultivation, her eyes shut tight. Sensing his aura, she slowly opened them.

Li Zhouwei spoke without hesitation.

“How much longer?”

Li Que'wan had just emerged from her cultivation. The divine ability around her rippled, and a silver-red light flickered between her brows, filled with profound mystery. She considered for a moment.

“I have already consumed one pill. If I take the Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder next and nurture it carefully, it will take no more than three years!”

“Good.”

The King of Wei nodded and said solemnly.

“Perfect. You will go on a trip with me. I only need a few hours of your time!”

He took a step, and the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance behind him vanished like water. His next step took him into a grand hall where shadows flowed like liquid. As he entered, dharma lamps flickered, their light growing brighter bit by bit. Li Zhouwei said softly.

“Call Jiangchun up.”

Li Que'wan understood at once. She nodded slightly, formed a hand seal for a divine ability, and sank into thought with a composed expression.

“Creak…”

In an instant, the sound of hurried footsteps rang out. A young man pushed open the door, shut it tightly behind him, and then straightened up, his eyes full of joy.

“Congratulations, Clan Sister!”

He looked up and indeed saw his sister standing at the foot of the steps. She was dressed in a Daoist robe, her features lovely, with a new vermilion mark on her brow. She looked as if she had stepped out of a painting, with an ethereal, immortal bearing. Compared to the past, she had shed some of the mortal world's dust and gained more of a profound and divine mystique.

‘A Whole Pill divine ability!’

But the joy in his eyes had not yet faded before it was drowned by a surging tide of shock.

A Daoist Master should be the center of attention in any room, yet with Li Que'wan standing before him, the background seemed deep and striking. There, on the slightly dim high platform, sat a figure. His features were resolute and valiant, and he was dressed in black robes with gold patterns. His golden eyes shone as he watched him quietly.

Like two startling flashes of light in the darkness.

“King Wei!”

Li Jiangchun’s eyes reddened in an instant. He bowed deeply, his voice choked with emotion.

“Congratulations, King Wei!”

Without a doubt, Li Zhouwei was the sole pillar of stability for the Moongaze Li Clan. He had been severely injured by one of the world’s greatest Wu Earth calamities, and Li Jiangchun, being far away in the south, had been consumed with anxiety.

Then the White Ape had come all that way just to summon him back, planting an ominous premonition in his heart. Seeing Li Zhouwei standing there now, looking perfectly at ease and fully recovered, was a source of both shock and immense joy.

Li Zhouwei smiled as he looked at him, asking only one question.

“How is it? After so many years away, can the scenery of the Great Song’s imperial capital compare to the Lake’s?”

Li Jiangchun was bursting with things to say but didn't know where to begin. He could only sigh.

“How could its scenery compare to the greatest lake under heaven! Even in terms of talent, it is slightly inferior.”

Li Zhouwei gave him a brief glance and understood that he had progressed steadily over the years; his cultivation was stable and had reached profound unity, exceedingly solid. He nodded in satisfaction and said softly.

“Not bad. If not for one sword that is yet incomplete, the clan could already begin planning your path to the Purple Mansion Realm.”

Li Jiangchun nodded silently but did not linger on the topic of himself. Instead, he bowed deeply once more and said respectfully.

“Uncle summoned this junior to return. I wonder…”

Li Zhouwei’s smile gradually faded. He stood up, paced a few steps, and spoke softly.

“Jiangchun, what is the Song Emperor like?”

Li Jiangchun did not hesitate for long. After a slight pause, he answered immediately.

“The Song Emperor's ambitions are boundless. He is straightforward and without guile. If not for the burden of a nation, he would be a hero of the world. Unfortunately, he is shackled by the fate of a banished immortal and is also viewed with apprehension by the Heavenly Glow…”

Li Que'wan’s eyes flickered for a moment as she sighed inwardly. Li Zhouwei nodded with clear appreciation.

“He and I have a great deal of tacit understanding, and we have long shared the desire to shake up the status quo. He is also the only one who can influence the Underworld's decisions. For the great matter at hand today, he is indispensable!”

His expression was natural as he stood up and said in a low voice.

“I want you to return south to the Song court and deliver a message to him for me. Right now, besides you, no one can carry this message to the Song court without it being spied upon and leaked.”

The weight of his words made Li Jiangchun sense the coming storm. His expression turned grave, and he lowered his gaze.

“Please speak, Uncle!”

The King of Wei paced a few more steps in the hall before turning, his pupils glowing with a golden light thick with killing intent.

“Western Shu has just been defeated, and Lanyan has recently fallen. The window of opportunity is fleeting. With a three-year deadline, I will march on Luoxia. Ask him to lead Song in concert with me. In this battle, the Li Clan is willing to be the spearhead for Martial Cultivation.”

“I want Luoxia to be Song territory for ten years.”

The intensity in his eyes grew stronger as he stated quietly.

“He once said he meant to seek truth, raise immortals, and pursue Martial Cultivation. The time has now come. If this campaign succeeds, all three goals will be complete. It will be a glorious achievement for the Bright Yang, a feat of divine martial prowess!”
