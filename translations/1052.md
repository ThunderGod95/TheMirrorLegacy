# Chapter 1052: True Dao Immortal Cultivation

Li Ximing stroked his beard, his mind racing. "The Vast Profound Suspended Void," he mused aloud, "and it involves True Qi. It must be intimately connected to the Ning State."

Tinglan studied him for a long moment, carefully weighing her words before she finally spoke.

"Zhaojing… have you heard of the True Dao Sect?"

A flicker of surprise went through Li Ximing, but his expression remained unchanged.

"I would be grateful if you could elaborate, fellow Daoist."

A peculiar look crossed Tinglan's face. "The True Dao Sect consisted of four branches, all based on what was once Profound Truth Mountain—the very land where the Xiuyue Mountain Gate now stands. They championed a path of natural cultivation, a Great Dao that encompassed the Five Virtues. During the era of the Wei Emperor, this sect was the foremost cultivator of True Qi and Purple Qi."

She paused, considering her next words.

"Only, they didn't call it True Qi and Purple Qi. They called it 'True Yang' and 'Purple Yin'."

Li Ximing's brow twitched, his mind instantly alight with a thousand thoughts. Tinglan continued, unaware.

"In primordial times, a True Monarch whose family name was Zhuang cultivated on Profound Truth Mountain. People called him Daoist Zhuang—an extremely high honor in an age of ignorance. When he ascended to immortality, he left behind a cave estate containing a single tome: the Taihua Classic."

"His six disciples shared the book. In time, they all fell, but not before passing on their knowledge to their own successors. These inheritors jointly safeguarded the classic, forming the nascent True Dao Sect."

"The True Dao Sect's mastery of True and Purple Qi was unparalleled. The Vast Profound Suspended Void… was the spiritual atmosphere that their Daoist Tradition conceived. However, during the fall of the Zhou Dynasty, a schism tore the sect apart. The paths of True Qi and Purple Qi diverged, and their doctrine of the Five Virtues all but annihilated the principles of Yin and Yang. Despite this, the Daoist scriptures they preserved remained incredibly profound. They are, to this day, the foundational texts for all who cultivate True and Purple Qi."

Li Ximing nodded slowly.

"The True Dao immortal cultivators... stripped of their crowns, their wings clipped..."

'Of course I knew,' Li Ximing thought. 'It was a defining moment in history—a glorious victory the Cui clan boasted of, and a pretext later generations used to condemn the Wei Emperor. No matter the perspective, there was no ignoring the emperor's shocking decree!'

Tinglan's surprise was fleeting. She quickly understood and shook her head. 

"Precisely. The Wei Emperor marched from Guanlong, sword in hand, and declared that any immortal cultivator who had forsaken the mortal world and refused to aid the common folk would be stripped of their crown and have their wings clipped. They weren't the only sect to face his wrath, but they were by far the most renowned."

"After the True Dao Sect was annihilated, the Wei Emperor read the Taihua Classic and was stunned by its brilliance. He decided to restore the path of Profound Truth, appointing the King of Jiangling to guard the mountain. And the descendant of that king… was none other than the future True Monarch Tianwu!"

As Tinglan laid out the history, the pieces clicked into place for Li Ximing. It was a moment of sudden, blinding clarity.

"No wonder," he exclaimed. "No wonder the Ning State took in the great families fleeing from the north and postured as the successor to the Wei's mandate! So that's the connection… This is a history that only a Dao Lineage like yours, one that cultivates Purple Qi, could possibly know so well!"

Tinglan nodded gravely and lowered her voice. "I suspect that even the Sima Family doesn't know the name 'Vast Profound Suspended Void'!"

"When the True Monarch Tianwu first appeared, the spiritual atmosphere was just as it is today. The two Qis worked in harmony with yin and yang, stars were visible in daylight, Anhuai Heaven rose, and Wanling Heaven expanded the land for who knows how far. The Ning State was the center of the world's attention. But because of the True Dao Sect's destruction, all their relevant Dao Lineages were locked away in the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate. The Sima and Su families were just noble clans; for all their searching through ancient texts, they could never find the name of this spiritual phenomenon. They had no choice but to report it to the throne as 'The Era of Conquest, Peace and Martial Glory'."

She mused, "My master theorized that since the Ning State inherited the Wei's mandate and established its own empire, it was inappropriate to use a name like 'Vast Profound Suspended Void'—a term from the True Dao Sect that advocated for worldly detachment and ascension into grotto-heavens. So they adopted the name proposed by the Sima and Su families instead."

Li Ximing nodded in understanding, another realization dawning on him.

'So... it was no accident that Zhouwei obtained the Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence from the Cui clan. It was said to be from an immortal estate, yet it contained little to no Bright Yang energy. It's highly likely that it originated from the absorbed arts of the True Dao Sect!'

'A grotto-heaven… a Mystic Realm…'

The thought stirred something within him.

He and Li Zhouwei had considered this long ago. But while their family was now a major power in Jiangnan with techniques second to none, they lacked the deep foundation needed to touch upon such immortal secrets. They didn't even possess a method to traverse the Great Void, let alone create a grotto-heaven Mystic Realm.

Li Ximing had originally pinned his hopes on Li Que'wan. Hearing this news now didn't disappoint him; instead, it solidified his resolve.

'A spiritual atmosphere like this... even if it only lasts for fifty years, let alone a hundred... with the help of the Talisman Seed, Que'wan will definitely have enough time. As for the technique to open a Mystic Realm…'

Spiritual items and resources could eventually be found, but secret arts were priceless and often existed only in the vaults of major powers. That was the real challenge. Yet, a smile touched his lips.

'Other places might not have one, but the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance is a different story!'

Back when Zhouwei destroyed the sect, killed Cheng Yan, and earned fifty-seven immortal merits, he had used the remainder after exchanging for the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light. Twelve merits were left. The battle on the river hadn't yielded as much, but he had still disposed of Taixi and crippled Chiluo. Countless Buddhist monks died in that great war, earning them even more immortal merits than the time with Cheng Yan—a full sixty-five.

'I shouldn't have to worry about immortal merits for a while. The only issue is explaining the origin of the spell arts!'

As he considered this, a trace of delight grew in his heart.

'The Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence is a sleeve-dwelling technique. To put it plainly, it’s not an exaggeration to call it a minor Mystic Realm. If this spiritual atmosphere is so beneficial for elevating Mystic Realms, it should drastically reduce the cultivation cost of this art as well...'

While his mind was occupied with his own affairs, he spoke his thanks aloud.

"To share such secrets so freely… Zhaojing is deeply grateful, fellow Daoist!"

Tinglan shook her head with a smile.

"With the blessed land's emergence, Quexi has also come out of seclusion. She's been cultivating diligently all these years and is blessed with good fortune; she's already at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. She's been clamoring to come back to the lake for a look... but Wenqing values her greatly and immediately whisked her away to the imperial capital. It will be a few days before she returns."

"However... there is another junior..."

With a wave of her sleeve, Tinglan opened the hall doors. A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator strode in quickly. He was tall and thin, but his bearing was proper. He bowed excitedly before the grand hall.

"This humble one, Ding Mu, greets the Daoist Master! Congratulations on your great advancement in divine ability."

Tinglan smiled.

"He came from your lake. Life in the sect has been simple for him these past years, but he has not been a disappointment. When he heard I was coming to the lake, he knelt before my grotto-estate for several days, insisting that I bring him along to express his gratitude."

"So it's you…"

Li Ximing smiled with genuine interest.

Years ago, when cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate came to construct an array on the lake, a certain amorous Daoist Cao had taken a widow from the shore with him, bringing her orphaned son, Ding Mu, to the Purple Smoke Gate to cultivate. The boy back then had been so small and skinny; who would have thought he'd grow into the young man before him now?

"How is your mother?"

Ding Mu kowtowed and replied respectfully

"The Spiritual Qi on the mountain is dense. My mother's fortunes were thin, and she passed away early. My master entered seclusion for an unknown length of time, so she couldn't even see him one last time. I handled her funeral arrangements myself and have been cultivating on the mountain for what should be ten years now..."

Daoist Cao was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. He might have pitied the young Ding matriarch in her youth, but once she grew old, she wouldn't have received a second glance. Li Ximing nodded slightly. Tinglan chuckled.

"Daoist Cao's wife is a jealous woman. In his early years, he relied heavily on aid from the lake and is very grateful for it. Seeing his devotion, I decided to send him here to guard your family's lake. It should fulfill his long-held wish."

Tinglan spoke lightly, but Li Ximing suspected it was more than just 'aid'. The widow Ding must have borrowed the fox's prestige to live out her natural life. He sighed softly.

"Go find Weizheng. He is your clansman, after all."

Ding Mu wiped his tears, kowtowed three more times, and retreated. Li Ximing sipped his tea and remarked,

"Que'yi has gained Kuang Yu's favor. Her cultivation is progressing rapidly, already catching up to her younger sister."

Tinglan acknowledged his words, then bowed and took her leave. Li Ximing saw her out, saying seriously,

"Please wait a moment, Tinglan. I will start the furnace to refine the pills! I will have someone deliver them to you."

Tinglan thanked him. Li Ximing rode a beam of light back to the island. His smile vanished as he landed and hurried inside. The main hall was silent. Li Jiangzong and the others were already waiting.

Li Ximing took the main seat, his gaze sweeping over them before landing on a white-robed youth at his side. His eyes lit up.

"Jiangchun… you're out of seclusion!"

The sword-bearing youth in white smiled slightly and bowed.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, Jiangchun was fortunate not to fail his mission. I successfully forged my immortal foundation last year!"

Li Jiangchun had entered seclusion around the same time as Li Ximing, who had paid special attention to his progress. The family had long prepared Essence Gathering Pills refined with Lesser Yin spiritual items for him. Given his exceptional talent, achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm was not surprising, but it was still a cause for great celebration. Li Ximing nodded, looking at him with a beaming smile.

"And... what wonders has it brought?"

Compared to his brothers, Li Jiangchun was especially favored and was familiar with both Daoist Masters. He showed no fear, bowing with a smile.

"It is called 'All-Fragrance Sinks'. It uses the harmony of cold and heat to drive water and fire, sense good and ill, perceive azure spirits, connect above to the yin of Purple Qi to absorb great purity, and draw up the harmony of Cold Qi from below to nurture the Mansion Water..."

He raised a hand, palm up. In his jade-white palm, tassel-like streams of white light swirled. It looked unassuming, yet it emanated waves of an eye-catching Pure Qi.

Li Jiangchun spoke in a warm voice,

"All-Fragrance Sinks resides in the harmony of cold and heat. It has an affinity for Cold Qi and Mansion Water, allowing me to command Purple Qi as if it were my own limbs. It also has the ability to mend the injuries of others. The so-called absorption of great purity means I can consume medicines harmonized with Lesser Yin and Pure Qi as if they were pure yin dharma power, using them freely without fear of harm. By circulating my immortal foundation, I can transform the wonders of the Mansion Water for healing."

Li Ximing nodded, his eyes bright with approval.

'The Lesser Yin is not a well-known path, and it's rare in the world, but it's a harmonizing Dao that all major powers covet!'

'Not to mention, Lesser Yin and Pure Qi... they are perfectly suited for him!'

Joy bloomed in his heart, but with others present, he held his tongue. 

Suppressing his curiosity, he said,

"Excellent. In my travels through the Eastern Sea, I once saw a Shade-Cleansing Pool within the Daoist Tradition of the Nine Mounds. It contained a Lesser Yin treasure called Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew, which could heal the spiritual sense, advance dharma power, and enhance divine abilities without any risk to one's foundation. I imagine... that was also due to the wonders of the Lesser Yin!"

He smiled.

"I shall swallow my pride and request a portion for you!"

"Many thanks, Daoist Master!"

Li Jiangchun bowed repeatedly in gratitude, then said seriously, "The Lesser Yin path exclusively fears Molten Fire and Gathering Wood. The three thunders are incompatible, and it has no affinity with Ancient Merging. As for the twelve Qi, it is compatible with most."

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully. "Then the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record... how is your progress?"

Li Ximing had read the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record. It was incredibly difficult, perhaps even more so than the Great Parting's White Brilliance. He had Li Jiangchun cultivate it to build a solid foundation and broaden his Dao-Profundity, preparing him for a breakthrough in his divine ability.

Hearing the question, Li Jiangchun answered respectfully,

"This junior cultivates it day and night. In addition to practicing the sword, I spend much time on this art. The foundation is now set, and a Profound Mystery locus has formed within my body to contain water and fire..."

Having read the art himself, Li Ximing knew he had reached the stage where he needed spiritual items for support.

"What items do you require?" he asked.

Li Jiangchun bowed.

"The wonder of Lesser Yin commands water and fire. Among the fire virtues, both Blazing and True Fire heed its call. Although Li Fire is distant, it can be used in a pinch, but it uniquely fears Molten Fire. Among the water virtues, it most favors Mansion Water. Wherever its power reaches, even Converging and Valley Water will submit. Only with Pristine Water is it incompatible. It is not a matter of suppression, but their wonders clash and cannot be easily reconciled."

"The old master often asked about my progress and prepared both a Mansion Water treasure, 'Flowing Mansion Water', and a True Fire, 'Long-March Pheasant Flame', for me long ago. They are constantly being nurtured in my Profound Mystery locus to aid my cultivation."

Li Ximing smiled upon hearing this.

"Your great-grandfather is older and wiser. He understands that Mansion Water and True Fire are a perfect match, providing more than enough for you juniors to study carefully!"

Everyone nodded in agreement. In truth, Li Ximing had bigger plans.

'If the opportunity arises and the family's finances allow, perhaps I can find him a spiritual water and a spiritual fire.'

Li Jiangchun certainly couldn't refine items of the Purple Mansion Realm himself, but if the family truly had the means, Li Ximing could personally seal them into his acupoint. The benefits would be immense.

However, this was still just a notion. To bring it up in front of all the brothers would seem far too partial. Li Ximing tucked the thought away and asked,

"Jiangqian's side… is there any news?"

Li Jiangchun's eyes lit up.

"Big Brother came out of seclusion once last year. I heard his Dao-Profundity has advanced again. The flames around him burned fiercely with overwhelming might. He wanted to pay his respects to the Daoist Master but was unable to see you, so he returned to the mountain to continue his cultivation."

Li Jiangchun spoke tactfully, not mentioning the secret art. Li Ximing nodded in satisfaction and looked at Li Minggong.

"Have him come see me."

"Yes!"

As the woman left, Li Ximing asked about the others' cultivation one by one, offering encouragement. Then, he rose on a beam of light and landed on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. He opened the jade box and took out the Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf.

The spiritual light in the leaf's veins pulsed. It was already missing a corner, a sign that it should have been refined immediately. After several years, its spiritual nature had weakened further. Li Ximing conditioned it with Valley Water and Purple Qi, placed it in the furnace, and prepared to form it into pills using the One Will Technique.

His skill in alchemy was profound now. With just a single pat on the furnace, he felt a connection.

"'World's Radiance' is complete. With the enhancement from my Life Divine Ability, alchemy is much smoother... especially this One Will Technique. It resonates with my Life Divine Ability, increasing the speed of refinement significantly..."

It had been a long time since he'd touched a furnace, and he felt a sense of exhilaration. His movements were like flowing water. Closing his eyes, he lost himself in the process. After nine cycles of sun and moon, the furnace mouth vibrated. A rich fragrance filled the air as six verdant pills with a hint of purple shot out. Li Ximing slowly exhaled and calmly collected them.

'Refining pills is so much more relaxing than cultivating!'

The Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf was missing a corner, after all, and its medicinal properties had been lost. Producing six pills was already a feat. He took out two, packaged them carefully, and summoned a subordinate.

"Deliver these two to the Purple Smoke Gate."

He looked at the four remaining pills in his palm, thought for a moment, then took out a piece of silk cloth. He carefully wrote down the effects and ingredients, then added a few lines: I heard Senior was injured while seizing a treasure and have been deeply worried... This item is highly beneficial for injuries... If there is any need, please do not hesitate to command me... He sealed two more pills with the note.

"Deliver this to the Slaughter Jun Gate!"

The subordinate quickly agreed, then said cautiously,

"Daoist Master… the Young Master saw the blazing light on the mountain and did not dare to offend you. He has been waiting at the foot of the mountain for nine days and nine nights..."
