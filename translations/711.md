# Chapter 711: An Audience with the Great King

Qu Bushi was a wily old man. He racked his brain before whispering, “That snake demon is weak, so he wouldn’t dare say much… but the Northern Brocade River King is a demon favored by a Dragon Prince. He holds authority over all three rivers. A few years ago, even a cultivator from the White Ye Immortal Sect paid him a personal visit…”

The old man’s implication was clear. ‘Your clan may have a Purple Mansion cultivator, but so does his backer. Since when have the dragon clans feared anyone?’ He was trying to be diplomatic, afraid that the Li family’s direct approach would offend a powerful figure. The veiled warning made Li Minggong chuckle to herself.

Li Chenghui simply smiled. “Rest easy, Honored Retainer.”

As he spoke, a brilliant light gathered in the sky. Several figures descended from the south, landing on the mountain. The leader was clad in gleaming plate armor and gripped a halberd, his golden eyes flashing. Beside him stood a man in black robes with a somber expression and a sword at his waist.

Li Chenghui and the others rose to greet them. “Greetings, Clan Head!”

Li Zhouwei helped him up and strode into the newly repaired hall. He remained standing and asked, “What is the situation here?”

Li Chenghui reported on their progress, explaining that everything had gone smoothly except for the matter of the snake demon. He had Qu Bushi recount the tale from the beginning, and the old man, not daring to be careless, explained every detail.

Li Zhouwei’s brow furrowed as he listened.

The problem was simple. He had a decent relationship with the Dragon Prince, Dingjiao, but the chasm between their families was as vast as the one between the clouds and the earth. Such a connection couldn't be cashed in like currency. The moment he used it, his ties to the Dragon Prince would be severed—a price Li Zhouwei had been unwilling to pay even for a Purple Mansion-grade ancient spiritual item.

‘And Dingjiao is a White Dragon Prince. The faction behind this Northern Brocade River King might not be the White Dragons at all! The other branches are one thing, but if he’s allied with the Black Dragons… that would be inviting a mountain of trouble for no reason!’

Li Zhouwei had long heard that the dragon clans were not a monolith. He had seen for himself in the Southern Sea how Dingjiao had made things difficult for Miao Ye. At its root, it was all part of the conflict between the White and Black Dragons.

‘The dragon clans will probably not interfere directly, but if this River King decides to make trouble, demanding a blood sacrifice now and then, it would be a nauseating problem with no clear recourse…’

After a moment of thought, Li Zhouwei asked, “What is this Northern Brocade River King’s true form?”

“That…” Qu Bushi froze, unable to answer for a long moment. Finally, he managed, “I do not know. I have only heard rumors… that the River King cultivates the Dao of Converging Water and possesses a powerful profound light. Wherever it passes, it can conjure maddening illusions and dissolve a person into a pool of blood.”

Li Zhouwei fell into a thoughtful silence, an understanding dawning in his mind. Suddenly, a calm, ethereal voice, as if drifting from the Great Void itself, echoed by his ear.

“Minghuang, go and see this snake demon at once. Take your men.”

Recognizing Li Ximing’s voice, Li Zhouwei put away his weapon and immediately gave the order. “I will go see this snake demon.”

He was a man of action. As soon as the words left his mouth, he called for Li Chenghui and Li Minggong, leaving only An Siwei to guard the mountain. He took to the sky, his thoughts racing.

‘This snake demon is a nobody. For a Purple Mansion cultivator to intervene, this must be about Dense Cloud Cave.’

With that realization, his pace quickened. In less than fifteen minutes, Baijiang Creek lay before them.

The waters of Baijiang Creek were clear with a faint blue tint, the longest and purest of the three streams. It even fed a small lake, a stark contrast to the murky Baiye Creek to the east.

The lake was no match for Moongaze Lake, spanning only fifty li, but from a distance, it looked like a lovely blue gem set among the rolling hills. They flew another fifty li past the lake before a small, lush mountain with a jagged peak came into view.

This mountain was far taller than Floating Cloud Cave’s main peak and was likely the finest spirit mountain in the entire domain. Fu Dou, lacking the backing, strength, and cunning to compete, had naturally lost it to the snake demon.

Li Zhouwei halted his light before the mountain and sent Qu Bushi to announce their arrival. Li Chenghui moved closer, speaking through a private transmission. “Clan Head, I see people waiting at the foot of the mountain. It seems someone has beaten us here.”

“Dense Cloud Cave, without a doubt.” Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes and concealed his aura. After a short wait, Qu Bushi returned on the wind, looking utterly dejected. He bowed. “Reporting to the Clan Head, the demon claims he is entertaining guests and cannot see us.”

Seeing his sorry state, Li Zhouwei guessed the demons had been far less polite than their words suggested. He nodded. “This snake demon has been preying on humans for a long time. There is nothing more to say. We will eliminate him today and spare ourselves future trouble.”

He shot into the sky, heading straight for the mountain. Seeing the lush vegetation, he drew his long halberd. As he descended with a cold expression, two demon soldiers blocked his path before a cave entrance. One held a saber, the other a spear. Seeing more visitors, they grew impatient. A leopard-headed demon shouted, “Who are you now? I already told you, my master is not seeing anyone! What part of the demon tongue don’t you understand?”

Li Zhouwei stood tall, his halberd in hand, his armor shimmering with golden light. “Use your dog eyes before you speak,” he said coldly.

“Oh?” The leopard-headed demon threw his spear to the ground, rolled up his sleeves, and took a step forward. But when his eyes met Li Zhouwei’s golden gaze, he froze. He sniffed the air, his bravado vanishing. “Ah… so it is a master who has arrived. Forgive me, but from which mountain do you hail? This lowly leopard failed to recognize your eminence…”

Li Zhouwei, remembering Bai Rong’s advice on how to handle demons, stared him down. “Witless slave. Do you not recognize a noble species when you see one? Have your master roll out here and pay his respects to me.”

His words sent a chill of terror through the two demons. They exchanged a panicked glance, and one scrambled back into the cave. A dozen breaths later, a man in a garishly multicolored python robe emerged, flanked by a host of lesser demons. He stretched his neck and squinted at them from the cave entrance.

Li Zhouwei met his gaze with an icy stare.

The snake demon’s heart pounded in his chest. He had no choice but to hurry down the mountain, still craning his neck to get a better look. But no matter how he looked, the man before him was clearly of high demonic lineage, his bloodline undeniably noble. He chose his words with care. “I wonder which mountain’s great king you are? This humble demon is but a minor steward from the Northern Brocade River King’s mansion, trying to make a living here. If you have any commands… I can arrange for you to meet the River King…”

Li Zhouwei didn’t move. He planted his halberd in the ground, his face a mask of contempt. “And what are you? Which palace does your master serve?”

This approach worked perfectly on demons. The snake demon’s suspicion melted away. He forced a smile and scurried to the edge of the defensive array, hesitating for a moment before stopping. He flicked his forked tongue and replied, “It is a great honor for my humble abode to receive a noble one such as yourself. My master is not from a direct palace lineage; he was ennobled by the Dragon Prince to temporarily govern the three rivers…”

“Not from a direct palace lineage?” Li Zhouwei scoffed, his face twisting with disdain. “In that case, how dare he not come out to greet me now that I have arrived in his domain? Which lineage branch does he belong to?”

That last question drained the color from the snake demon’s face. He began to wail, “Your Majesty… I am just a lowly steward in the mansion! How would I know such things? Please, allow me to introduce you to the Great King…”

Li Zhouwei bared his teeth in a cold, menacing grin. “Then why haven’t you invited me inside?”

“Ah!” The snake demon leaped from his spot as if struck by lightning. He flung aside his gaudy robe, scrambled out from behind the array, and dropped to his knees, his face a picture of pure sycophancy.

“I pay my respects, Your Majesty!”
