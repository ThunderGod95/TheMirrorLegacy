# Chapter 738: The Profound Peak Gate

The thought was a fleeting spark in Li Ximing's mind, yet it ignited a deep well of questions.

‘If that’s true… the kinship between the two major sects and the four minor gates might be far closer than I imagined. If Jiangnan’s entire Dao lineage truly originates from Green Pine Island, what does that signify? My breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm was met with obligatory congratulations and the custom of visiting the three great families. Are these traditions merely the rules and restraints of Jiangnan… or are they a form of power, a privilege exclusive to the region’s dominant forces?’

After a moment of contemplation, he gave a slight nod. In that instant, the eastern territories of Shanji Prefecture, the heartland of the Profound Peak Gate, were ceded. Kong Guxi could only feel a sense of relief that Li Ximing had agreed at all.

Though Cheng Jinzhu was privately bewildered, he was content that his mission for the gate was complete. He knew better than to prattle on in the presence of a Daoist Master. "The dharma treasure was borrowed by the former sect master, Kong Tingyun, when she accompanied the Daoist Master," he explained. "It seems the current sect master is unaware of the details. It's possible some arrangements were never formally passed down."

Li Zhouwei’s ears perked at the mention of Kong Tingyun's name. He raised an eyebrow. "And what miraculous properties does this dharma treasure possess?"

Cheng Jinzhu considered this for a moment. "I have never seen the dharma treasure itself," he admitted. "I only heard that within the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven, it was used as a decoration at the foot of a mountain. When it reveals its true form, it is said to be as vast as a mountain itself, snow-white and translucent. It can awaken spiritual potential, clarify the mind, and calm the spirit."

Li Ximing committed this to memory and exchanged a look with Li Zhouwei before changing the subject. "I once spoke with Daoist Master Lingmei about array formations. Do you have any news on that front?"

Several of the Purple Mansion cultivators Li Ximing had visited had mentioned this matter, so Cheng Jinzhu was prepared. "Daoist Master Lingmei has already sent a letter to an old friend at sea," he replied. "But the response was that his friend is in seclusion and won't be available for the foreseeable future."

He paused briefly. After Li Zhouwei dismissed Kong Guxi, Cheng Jinzhu continued in a lower voice, "There is also Daoist Master Tinglan of the Purple Smoke Gate. Their lineage excels in array formations. While she may not be able to lay down a new Purple Mansion array from scratch, she is skilled at adapting what already exists. She could move and modify a pre-existing grand array… its power might shift, but it would remain at the Purple Mansion level."

The implication was immediately clear to everyone present.

‘He’s talking about the Profound Peak Gate’s grand array!’

Li Ximing signaled his understanding, and Cheng Jinzhu took his leave. Once the hall was empty, Li Ximing spoke. "Minghuang, the story from the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate doesn't sound like a lie. I've met Lingmei. Although his ideals clash with those of the Myriad Radiance elders and he yearns for reform, he doesn't seem like the type to resort to such schemes."

Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement. "This affair has little to do with our family, but it should be investigated swiftly. Regardless of whether the claim is true or false, the Sword Gate must not be allowed to lay the blame at our door."

After all, the Li family currently had no dharma treasure to offer as compensation.

Li Ximing let out a breath. "That old fox Changxi… he wouldn't speak the whole truth even on his deathbed. I'll make a trip to the Profound Peak Gate. The description of that dharma treasure sounds like it possesses an Earth Virtue. It might be aiding Kong Tingyun in her breakthrough."

Li Zhouwei's earlier question about Kong Tingyun had hinted at this very possibility. Seeing that Li Ximing had caught his meaning, he nodded and saw him off, watching as his figure rode a beam of Profound Light and vanished into the Great Void.

***

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain, the cauldron before Li Ximing trembled softly as a current of Pure Qi ascended. With a slight shudder of the lid, six dark yellow pills shot out.

He caught them in his palm. Each Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill was the size of a longan, smooth and without any distinct markings. A refreshing fragrance wafted from them as Li Ximing carefully placed them into a jade bottle.

Petals rained down from the trees on the mountain, carried by the wind, creating a carpet of shimmering white on the ground. He admired the sight for a moment before his form reappeared on the southern face of the mountain.

In a depression on the mountainside, what was once a small pond had transformed into a Baleful Earth spring. Dark red baleful energy surged forth, purple flames dancing upon its surface, all contained within the pond by a white array formation that circled its edge, causing the energy to pool like water.

Li Ximing beckoned lightly with his hand.

*Splash!*

The surface of the pool stirred. The liquid condensed from Baleful Earth and purple fire rippled violently, and a palm-sized vase flew out from its depths.

The vase was a fiery reddish-purple, its surface covered in patterns like fire-forged glass. As it landed in Li Ximing’s hand, he immediately sensed its state.

‘This vase has been tempered by my Bright Yang Purple Fire and has absorbed a great deal of Li Fire. It’s nearing saturation.’

This pool was a Baleful Earth fire meridian born from his ascension to the Purple Mansion Realm, dominated by Bright Yang Fire, Li Fire, and Baleful Earth. While potent, the overwhelming baleful energy made it unsuitable for alchemy. The Profound Pattern Vase, however, could absorb the Bright Yang Fire and Li Fire from the meridian and refine them. Every six months, Li Ximing would retrieve it for this purpose.

Ignoring the amount of flame stored within, he circulated his arts and his Bright Yang divine ability. In less than an hour, he had completely refined the flames inside. A quick inspection revealed their power was already considerable, even among Foundation Establishment cultivators.

‘What a peculiar artifact.’

To this day, Li Ximaging could not identify which Dao lineage the vase belonged to. His own tempering with Bright Yang and Li Fire was still far from reaching its limit, clearly indicating the vase had much greater potential.

‘I wonder if it can be refined into a spirit embryo. It would be a shame to waste it. I’ll keep tempering it for now and use other materials for my projects.’

While Li Zhouwei and the others stood guard in the wilderness, Moongaze Lake was a hive of activity. Li Jiangqian had mobilized the entire workforce around the lake to construct a high platform next to the Inherited Clarity Gate, one of the six gates surrounding the lake.

This was no ordinary platform; it was a grand sacrificial altar required for the technique known as *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*. A quick glance told Li Ximing it was already more than half complete.

‘Once this is settled, I’ll visit the Profound Peak Gate first, then take a trip to the Chengyun Gate. They’re our neighbors, after all. It’s been long enough. I can also try asking about Xiaoshi Mountain.’

Tossing the Profound Pattern Vase back into the pool, Li Ximing slipped into the Great Void and departed without delay, materializing in the wilderness outpost.

Li Zhouwei was not in the main hall. Instead, Li Chenghui and Kong Guxi were discussing something. Li Ximing tossed the bottle of pills to Li Chenghui, then grabbed Kong Guxi by the collar and vanished.

The poor man was terrified, but fortunately, Changxi had taken him through the Great Void before. He managed to steady himself within the beam of Profound Light, his heart still pounding. He cupped his hands. "Daoist Master…"

Before he could continue, a nod from Li Ximing silenced him. Moments later, they dropped back into the physical world, arriving at the Profound Peak Gate in Shanji Prefecture.

Night had fallen, but the gate was still marked by a white halo of light shimmering in the sky, faintly outlining the peaks within. But unlike the bustling hub it once was, the entire mountain range was now utterly still. It was like a dead mountain, with not a single streak of light rising or falling.

A bitter taste filled Kong Guxi’s mouth as he heard Li Ximing’s command.

"Open the array."

"Yes!"

He untied the token from his waist and aimed it at the barrier. Forming a seal with his hands, he projected a brownish-yellow light. After a slight delay, the grand array parted, revealing a narrow opening. Through it, they could glimpse a jade-like gate and the warm glow of yellow lanterns.

The instant the gateway appeared, Kong Guxi felt the ground vanish beneath him. Below, dark mountain ranges twisted and undulated, dotted with shimmering lights. A few solitary figures moved about, their escape lights streaking across the sky like shooting stars.

He had seen this view countless times. They were now above his own sect. Li Ximing’s back was to him, the newly ascended Daoist Master staring intently at the immortal pavilions below, filling Kong Guxi with a sense of bone-chilling dread.

He shrank back, tucking his hands into his sleeves as he followed Li Ximing on a tour of the grounds. He heard the Daoist Master’s voice, filled with admiration.

"Your gate possesses a profound foundation and excels at moving mountains and reshaping the land. This entire area is brimming with potent spiritual energy, home to many unique spiritual mountains… It contains five of the Twelve Qi and eight of the Five Virtues, including three types of Earth Virtue. Remarkable… truly remarkable!"

The Profound Peak Gate might have lagged behind other immortal sects in some respects, but its collection of spiritual mountains was second to none. For centuries, Changxi had worked as diligently as a mole preparing for winter, relocating one mountain after another to this place. The resulting domain was incredibly tempting.

‘No wonder Yehui covets this mountain gate so fiercely. His White Ye Immortal Sect was only recently established. Acquiring a foundation like this would save him centuries of effort!’

Li Ximing completed his circuit. The gate was nearly empty of disciples. Only the main hall showed some signs of life, where his own junior, Li Jianglong, was engrossed in a jade slip, surrounded by stacks of books taller than he was.

Li Ximing nodded slightly but decided not to reveal himself. After touring the entire area and inspecting its various secret realms, he found nothing that remotely resembled the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain.

He finally came to a halt before the Profound Peak treasury. He paused, then turned, hands clasped behind his back. "Sect Master… are you certain the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain is not within?"

Kong Guxi, who had already guessed his purpose, fell to his knees. "I have never known of any Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain! If I am concealing even a shred of the truth, may I be struck down and my Dao perish this instant!"

Li Ximing hadn’t really expected Daoist Master Changxi to leave a dharma treasure of that magnitude sitting in the treasury; there would have been no need for secrecy if that were the case. "Take me to the seclusion grotto," he said.

The color drained from Kong Guxi’s face, but he bowed his head respectfully. "Which… which Daoist Master do you wish to see?" he asked in a low voice.

"Kong Tingyun," Li Ximing replied casually.

Kong Guxi simply nodded. He led the way, weaving through the mountains and deactivating illusion arrays with his token. After a series of twists and turns, they entered a spiritual mountain from below and passed through another illusion array, finally arriving at a grotto.

Standing on a stone platform inside, Kong Guxi used his token to activate the final mechanism. A tightly sealed stone door materialized on the grotto wall. Without another word, he collapsed to the floor, curling into a ball.

Li Ximing understood his meaning perfectly. If he insisted on searching for the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain, the sealed chamber would have to be opened. And once that door was unsealed, Kong Tingyun’s life would be forfeit.

He didn't enter. Instead, a puzzled expression crossed his face as he considered the situation.

‘Cheng Jinzhu said that when the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain is activated, it’s as large as a mountain. It’s highly unlikely it could be hidden in a small secret chamber… and even if it could, I would have sensed it easily.’

He paced back out of the grotto. Behind him, Kong Guxi kowtowed repeatedly. After they had left the area, Li Ximing was still unable to solve the puzzle.

Evidently, the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain was not within the Profound Peak Gate. Daoist Master Changxi had used some unknown means to secret it away as a contingency. Since he hadn’t told Li Ximing about it, finding it now would be exceedingly difficult.

‘He promised the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate the southern shore of Lake Xian and the eastern lands of Shanji… The intention couldn’t be more obvious. It was Changxi’s way of setting up his legacy. That being the case, the old fox surely had a plan for where to leave the associated Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain.’

Li Ximing could only depart with regret, making a mental note of the situation.

‘Daoist Master Lingmei specifically mentioned that this matter wasn't urgent. Changxi lived for over four hundred years; he wouldn't have pinned all his hopes on me. I’ll wait and see how things develop.’

He also held the secret of the demon embryo obtained from Sumian. These were matters that required careful investigation and could not be acted upon rashly, lest they backfire.

‘No matter how much of a gentleman Sumian appears to be now, he’s still a veteran Purple Mansion cultivator. If I push him too far, he’ll become a threat every bit as dangerous as Yehui.’

As he exited the mountain gate, Kong Guxi followed behind, dazed and lost in thought. Li Ximing set him down at the edge of the wilderness. "Send a few people back to search," he instructed. "If you can't find that dharma treasure, you'll have a hard time explaining things to the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate."

Kong Guxi could only nod meekly. His appearance was a reflection of his spirit; in just over a month, his hair had rapidly turned gray. Where once he had the look of a young man, he now looked thoroughly middle-aged, even showing signs of frailty.

Li Ximing gave him a second glance. It suddenly struck him how uncannily similar he looked to Li Xuanxuan during the years he was plagued by his inner demon. They were two completely different people, yet their expressions of despair made them appear almost the same.

‘Every family has its own troubles… when times are hard, no one’s burden is lighter than another’s.’

He withdrew his gaze and journeyed north through the Great Void. As he approached the borders of the Chengshui Marsh, the fabric of the Great Void became noticeably more turbulent.

‘Such incredible fortune,’ Li Ximing mused. ‘The most vital part of all Jiangbei is the Chengshui Marsh, and he has devoured it all for himself.’

Breaking back into the real world, Li Ximing saw a vast, shimmering marshland spread out before him. From the sky, countless dark cypress trees stood tall within the waters. A gentle breeze rustled through their leaves with a soft, whispering sound.

"Chengshui Marsh…"

A complex look entered Li Ximing’s eyes. This place was a famous great marsh, its depths hiding the bones of countless cultivators from both the north and the south. He swept the area with his spiritual sense.

‘The Chengshui Marsh was once a land of Converging Water, yet the Wood Qi here is so vigorous that all these cypress trees managed to grow despite the flooding. Compared to Moongaze Lake… this is more akin to a true marshland. Perhaps in another hundred years, it will evolve into a treasured land of Mansion Water.’

All things in the world were in a constant state of flux; nothing remained unchanged. Moongaze Lake was deeper, and the main body of the lake was elementally aligned with Pit Water, making it very stable. Otherwise, the remnants of the Lingyu Gate would not have chosen it as their refuge back then. The shores around Moongaze Lake were closer to Mansion Water marshlands, with water levels similar to Chengshui Marsh, though their spiritual energy was far inferior.

Li Ximing streaked across the sky, materializing above a bustling marketplace in the Chengshui Marsh.

The Li family also had an outpost here. Years ago, his junior Li Quewan had needed elemental spiritual energy for her Qi Refining, which was gathered from the marsh. They had used a shop in the marketplace as a cover, and the family still maintained a presence here.

‘I believe the He family is in charge of this place.’

Li Ximing formed a hand seal. The array protecting the marketplace was practically nonexistent to him. He passed through it via the Great Void and landed inside.

After all, not even the Golden Feather Sect, let alone the Chengyun Gate, was extravagant enough to protect a marketplace with a Purple Mansion grand array. To a Purple Mansion cultivator, more than ninety percent of the markets in Jiangnan were completely undefended. Li Ximing looked down at the bustling, lively crowd below.

He swept his spiritual sense across the area, and the cacophony of voices became crystal clear in his mind.

‘Minghui Lianmin of the Lotus Temple is leading her fellow monks… to debate the Dao with the Daoist Master of Chengyun here in the Chengshui Marsh?’
