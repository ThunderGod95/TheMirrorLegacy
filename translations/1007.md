# Chapter 1007: Yuanbai

The world was a canvas of gray.

Sheets and layers of Merging Fire rained from the sky, burning with a fluctuating brilliance. A man clad in platinum armor and a snow-white feathered robe stood suspended in the air, True Qi coiling around him. He wielded a gleaming golden tang, a weapon upon which lightning, water, and fire intertwined with a soft, incessant crackle.

He had sharp, dark eyes and handsome features. Poised in the air, he was like the sole point of radiance in the surrounding darkness.

Beneath his feet, a massive, ink-black cauldron was pressed into the ground, slowly suppressing the surging karmic flames below. Though thousands of venomous, fiery tendrils lashed out from the periphery, attempting to overturn it, the cauldron held them firmly in place, unmoving.

Trapped beneath it, the Sparrow Carp Fish had already been reduced to a vortex of karmic fire, yet it still struggled, sending ripples through the air, unable to push the great cauldron away.

‘Sparrow Carp Fish… a sixth-generation Maha…’

The Great Void churned in chaos, with no corner of peace. Yet, within the tumult, a point of azure light remained fixed, observing quietly.

It was Si Yuanli.

He had been standing in the Great Void for some time, silently watching the peacock descendant struggle beneath the cauldron. He felt nothing but a serene coldness.

‘The Way of Great Desire planted the Great Virtue Golden Lotus outside the prefecture for a reason… The whole world knows this. For that peacock to act so brazenly, it must have had something to rely on. But with this treasure revealed, what hope of survival does it have?’

Si Yuanli, of course, recognized the ink-black cauldron. It was one of the founding ritual vessels of the King of Yue State, a Spiritual Treasure of the Exiled Qi class—the Guzhou Cauldron.

It was precisely its connection to Exiled Qi that made Si Yuanli fear that the man below him would never be able to return to the north.

The path of Exiled Qi had been severed for a long time. Many in the Purple Mansion Realm lived their entire lives without ever seeing an Exiled Qi spiritual item, let alone a Spiritual Artifact or Spiritual Treasure. The Guzhou Cauldron had most likely come from the Underworld, serving as material evidence of Yue State’s ties to it.

With the King of Yue's disappearance, the Guzhou Cauldron had vanished as well. To see it now, right before his eyes… if he weren't already bowing to another’s power, Si Yuanli might have laughed aloud.

‘They acted so recklessly back then, and now they're parading their might. All that's missing is for Judge Yang to come out and give a few pointers!’

He forced a sycophantic smile, but fearing his thoughts might be perceived, he pushed them aside. He watched as the gray flames were suppressed, inch by inch, while shrill roars echoed and the Great Void roiled ever more violently. A pang of envy struck him.

‘The water and fire of True Qi are truly formidable… Back then, Tinglan commanded respect from all cultivators with just a portion of the Immeasurable Water and Fire. But for this man, it is one of his six aspects. He’s a natural incarnation of Metallic Essence. How enviable!’

The path of True Qi cultivation emphasized preserving truth through martial prowess, culminating in the birth of six types of water and fire. But the man before him, Yang Zhuo, was a reincarnation of Metallic Essence itself. He didn’t need to perfect his divine ability to summon the six forms of water and fire. Although their power and form were slightly diminished, it was still a jaw-dropping feat.

Si Yuanli waited a moment longer for the Spiritual Treasure to settle firmly on the ground before stepping out. He materialized amidst the chaotic water and fire, bowed slightly, and spoke with reverence.

"Yue State noble, Sima Yuanli… on behalf of the Sima Family, I congratulate you, my lord, on achieving your divine ability!"

Truth be told, Si Yuanli was certainly no match for him, to say nothing of the chasm in their status. No matter how many schemes churned in his heart, he was not one who couldn't bow his head. His face was a mask of submission, his posture so low it was unlike that of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

The man in the sky lowered his gaze, the interwoven water and fire around him receding as his brilliant aura finally subsided.

"So it is Daoist Master Qinghu," he said casually.

"This past year… I've troubled you."

"I wouldn't dare… I wouldn't dare!"

He was, of course, referring to how Si Yuanli had voluntarily defended his overseas territory from incursions while he was in seclusion. Si Yuanli was overwhelmed by the acknowledgement, bowing deeply. "Our family once served Great Ning as an adjunct of Tianwu, a noble house of the Celestial Dynasty. To return to Tianwu's banner today… we are moved to tears…"

His words clearly pleased the man in the Great Void. They not only flattered him but also highlighted Si Yuanli’s unique status. Even Yang Zhuo lowered his gaze and praised him.

"Back then, all the noble houses assisted Tianwu. Cause and effect have run their course. Today, you must all return to the fold and restore the glory of the former dynasty."

Si Yuanli bowed low, his heart soaring with joy. He knew his position was secure. He immediately moved forward to escort him back to the prefecture, but then he heard Yang Zhuo laugh.

"Daoist Master Si, have you ever considered being enfeoffed as a king?"

A tremor went through Si Yuanli.

‘He asked… I knew he would ask!’

Ever since the Way of Great Desire had moved south, Si Yuanli had been uneasy. He had made inquiries through various channels, relying on connections left by his predecessors, and had finally managed to contact the Nine Mounds in the Peacock Sea.

But after several pleas, the Nine Mounds, finally tired of his persistence, gave him but a single reply:

‘The Sima are subjects of Tianwu.’

It was this very sentence that prompted him to introduce himself as from the Sima Family and to answer Yang Zhuo’s question without a hint of hesitation.

"The Sima are subjects of Tianwu," he declared firmly, "and only subjects!"

His words made even Yang Zhuo pause. He gave Si Yuanli a second, appraising look before smiling and striding forward.

"You're quite astute," he said softly.

Si Yuanli bowed his head and followed him into the prefecture as a tidal wave of cheers erupted from the surroundings.

The reincarnated figure of Metallic Essence maintained his smile and remarked offhandedly, "Daoist Master Chen is a senior, after all. It seems I'll have to pay him a visit."

Si Yuanli was no fool. With the guidance from the Nine Mounds and various other confirmations, he understood the situation perfectly.

‘Just now, when Simin was in turmoil, plenty of people were observing from the Great Void. Senior Chen Yin must have been watching, but he quietly withdrew…’

Yang Zhuo’s divine ability was shielded by the Exiled Qi of the Guzhou Cauldron, obscuring him from view. Naturally, there was no crowd of well-wishers. Only Si Yuanli, who had pledged allegiance early, was able to witness the event up close. It was normal for Chen Yin to retreat when he couldn't get a clear picture. And while Yang Zhuo’s words held no blame, Si Yuanli felt a surge of relief.

‘The Chen Clan… others may not know, but how could the Underworld not? The Chen Clan held immense power in the last years of Ning State. The so-called Yushui Chen Clan is just a branch that came down from Ning State, but from an earlier time, not descendants of the Chen Xuanli brothers… Chen Yin’s best move… would have been to wait outside the prefecture for my lord!’

Though he thought this, a chilling, delayed fear crept into his heart.
‘Of the great noble families of Ning State back then, aside from the Li and Jiang clans who governed regions and were too difficult to control due to their unique backgrounds, all the others were either regional overlords in Jiangnan or famous far and wide. Even the weakest among them had their tracks exposed and were brought into the fold long ago… This was all prepared in advance.’

‘The ice is three feet thick—not the result of a single cold day…’

## Gardenia Scenery Mountain

The Heavenly Light was brilliant, and gardenia petals danced in the air amidst a swirl of multicolored light. A Daoist sat before a white jade table, his expression calm as he held a jade slip pressed against the tabletop.

Across from him sat an old man with a kind face and a sword on his back. He looked perfectly ordinary; if not for the resplendent divine ability coalescing around him, one might mistake him for a commoner.

The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators sat in silence. It was clear they had been this way for some time.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing…"

The swordsman was, of course, Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin.

The Yuyang Chen Clan had always been on good terms with Moongaze, and their shared connection to the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition had brought them even closer. When Li Zhouwei had aided him during the chaos at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, their bond had deepened further.

Thus, when the karmic fire fell upon Simin and the water and fire blazed, Daoist Master Yushui found himself without his Supreme Yang backing. He had made his way straight to Gardenia Scenery Mountain, where he now sat, sighing with profound unease.

Li Ximing remained silent for a moment before lowering his gaze and asking, "How are things in Simin?"

"It’s shielded by Exiled Qi, so I couldn't see clearly. But… I'm afraid the Sparrow Carp Fish's rampage is over."

Chen Yin nodded, a touch of melancholy in his voice. "My junior has already sent word. I imagine you know as well, Daoist friend… From here on, it will likely be about establishing a state. Perhaps they mean to rebuild the great Yue!"

Li Ximing sighed internally. Finally finding an opportunity, he said gravely, "Since things have come to this, there are a few matters I must ask you about, Senior, and a few things I must share."

Chen Yin nodded.

Li Ximing frowned. "Yue State… was the Underworld's Yue State. Everyone knew this back then. Why did it fall to its current state?"

This question had been buried in Li Ximing’s heart for a long time. For ages, the Three Sects and Seven Gates had suppressed this information, burying these events in history, turning them into a taboo…

Li Ximing had never intended to pry, but with the rise of the Yang family and the talk of rebuilding a state, the history of the old Yue State had become critically important.

Chen Yin was not surprised by the question. He nodded slightly and sighed.

"Regarding this matter… the Chen Clan's records are limited. The story of Jiangnan must begin with the great Chu State…"

"In those years, Chu State was in chaos. The imperial clan turned on itself, reaching a point where there were five emperors in ten years. Finally, a powerful minister, Xiao Ci, usurped the entire Jiangnan region from Chu and established the great Wu State. At that time, the Yang family were merely subjects of Wu."

His expression was complicated. "It's shameful to admit… but my Yuyang Chen Clan… also received favors from Wu State back then. That’s how we got our start, with a prefecture of our own in Jiangnan…"

"But the world is unpredictable. Even a man as powerful as Xiao Ci, a master of conspiracy and strategy, was only a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Though he seized the throne during Chu’s chaos, he had no foundation to lean on. He soon repeated the same mistakes, and Wu State collapsed as well. Rebel armies rose up everywhere, and only then did the Yang family take the stage."

"The Xiao-Wu forces retreated into Wu State, while the Yang-Yue quickly established their own state. Their first capital was Guzhou, which is now the Jingchuan prefecture of Sword Gate. That is how the Guzhou Cauldron became famous!"

He added thoughtfully, "I suspect… that treasure has reappeared and is in that lord's hands."

Li Ximing nodded.

The old man continued, "Though Yang-Yue and Xiao-Wu are now shadows of their former selves, and they played very different roles, they shared one thing in common. People speak of Emperor Wei and Emperor Chu, but Wu and Yue had only kings!"

"Xiao Ci usurped the throne and called himself emperor, but who in later generations recognized him? Never mind the supremely dominant Emperor Wei; Emperor Liang, Emperor Chu, even Shi Chang of the great Qi, who could only lament his state’s decline—that man was a True Monarch. How could Xiao Ci, a mere Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, claim the title of emperor?"

He paused, collecting his thoughts. "And the King of Yue was even more straightforward. He started his uprising in Yue Province, swept through most of Jiangnan, and was on the verge of breaking through to the True Monarch realm when he vanished overnight. His heirs inherited the enterprise but couldn't unify the state. They tried several times to grant their father a posthumous imperial title, but they were blocked by the great noble families. In the end, he was left to call himself king, all alone."

"The great noble families…"

Li Ximing looked puzzled. Chen Yin understood immediately.

"The King of Yue vanished too suddenly. The entire state hadn't been pacified yet, and there were hardly any members of the imperial clan. The noble families of the time were numerous and powerful, most of them able to govern their own lands autonomously. The Yue royal clan was powerless to control them and had to rule jointly, gradually losing power, though they retained a shred of dignity."

"Later, the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition began to establish its lineages and sects. As the Immortal Mansions went into seclusion, the old prohibitions were broken one by one, and the last bit of decency for the Yue imperial descendants was stripped away. Their rule became nominal. The original noble families became sects, like Hongxue, Wuzhu Gate, and Searing Radiance… Even those that didn't become sects mostly secured important positions within them, their surnames prominent."

"But… Wuzhu Gate and the others have long since been buried in the dust of history, with no trace left!"

He sounded wistful. "The survival of Yue State can be credited to the protection of their ancestors, but its rise and fall… that is a matter for their descendants."

He was being polite, but his inner thoughts were far less charitable.

‘If it weren't for the borrowed might of the Underworld, they would have followed Wu State into oblivion long ago… How could they have dragged things out for so long, ending up in this pathetic, half-dead state…’

Though he didn't speak his thoughts aloud, the implication was clear. Li Ximing took note and pondered for a long time. Before he could ask another question, Chen Yin’s expression turned grim.

"Daoist friend, don't just look at Yue State. Wu State is no different. It's also in turmoil. That light of True Qi… I hear he's another major figure, one who has the great families of Wu State crying bitter tears."

Li Ximing sipped his tea as the old man narrowed his eyes. "My family is close to Wu State, so we hear more news. Given the current situation in the world, which Purple Mansion Realm cultivator can't feel that something is amiss? Even the most unlucky ones have learned their lesson after a setback or two. Wu State's stability is just around the corner!"

He lowered his voice. "Of the three portions of True Qi from Anhuai Heaven back then, one was obtained by Changhuai, and another fell into Zipei's hands. If the last one was corrupted into a demonic form, it must be the one the Yang family possesses."

The old man's meaning was exceptionally clear. He gritted his teeth. "There was a reason Qing Tangyin started cultivating True Qi so early, focusing on the Tianwu Daoist Tradition. He was learning to refine the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel on one hand and the True Adherence and Abstruse Strategy Whip on the other, and then he had to learn the Martial Seal of Authority and Karma… He made a mess of all of them… I thought he was just fumbling around, but it turns out it was all just a rehearsal!"

Li Ximing keenly detected the emotional shift and vaguely sensed that the relationship between the Chen Clan and Changhuai wasn't good. Chen Yin just shook his head.

"Two of the three paths have emerged. The turmoil here is likely not over yet. If you receive any news, I hope your esteemed clan will inform me…"

In his eyes, at least, no matter how great the karmic ties of the Li family were, as long as Li Zhouwei did not meet an untimely end, Moongaze Lake was destined for a period of glory. And regardless of the fall that might follow that glory, the Li family was safe until it arrived.

He spoke out of ignorance, but his words made things clearer for Li Ximing.

Where was the final portion of True Qi?

His own aunt had already explained it! It was in the hands of the Dragon-kin, prepared for one of their own seeking the True Dao… Whether the Dragon Monarchs would even allow it to be reincarnated was uncertain. And even if they did, it would be a True Qi dragon of the sea!

Li Ximing remained silent, raising his cup to signal the end of the visit. He personally escorted the Daoist Master out. As he returned, he saw Li Zhouwei materialize on the mountain, his expression grave. "A letter has arrived from Jiangliang," he said in a low voice.

"Hmm?"

Li Ximing felt a flicker of doubt, and a vague sense of foreboding washed over him. Li Zhouwei glanced at a nearby courtyard guard, and the two of them sat down on the mountainside. Li Zhouwei produced a letter.

As Li Ximing watched him place it on the table, his eyes fell upon the name, and his expression instantly froze.

‘Yang… Tianya…’

He met Li Zhouwei’s solemn gaze, knowing this was bad. "Go and invite the old master here!" he said grimly.

The name Yang Tianya was not famous in Jiangnan. In fact, he was only a rumor from a century ago, and few of the younger generation knew of him. But the Li family could never, ever forget him.

‘Back then… our family received the Talisman Seed. To hide the fact that all the elders had aptitude… we pretended our ancestor, Li Mutian, was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator…’

The lie had protected the Li family for a time, but a Foundation Establishment cultivator having so many children also raised suspicion. It wasn't until Li Zhouwei was born, and the family was branded with the name Bright Yang Wei-Li, that their origins were finally explained away.

But as ancestor Li Mutian’s direct superior at the time, Yang Tianya had even seemed to acknowledge his existence as a Foundation Establishment cultivator—an utter absurdity!

"Descendant of an old friend…"

Those four simple words carried a weight of killing intent that could not be underestimated. Whether it was mockery or a threat, it made Li Ximming’s brows furrow deeply.

Only when the old master had arrived and taken the small letter did Li Zhouwei speak, his voice low and heavy.

"Yang Tianya must know the truth… These four words are intentional. We have to go to Simin prefecture!"

Li Xuanxuan read the letter over and over, his lips turning slightly pale. Li Ximing frowned. "Since he is already in the Purple Mansion Realm, he must have a perfect memory. If our ancestor never caught his eye, we might still have some room to maneuver. But if he saw him clearly back then, this will not be easy to resolve."

"No matter what, the fact that our ancestor had four sons, at least three of whom had spiritual aptitude, cannot be erased! Even if he really were a Foundation Establishment cultivator, that in itself is a natural loophole…"

His expression grew intense. "The four elders of the four branches were close in age, born almost one after another… Logically, an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator could not have such offspring. Only someone who was both of Bright Yang Wei descent and at Foundation Establishment… might have a chance."

He thought for a few seconds. "Remember… even with a perfect memory, he wouldn't remember tens of thousands of names. He couldn't possibly match our ancestor among thousands of mortals. As long as he never met our ancestor, we can claim he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator from elsewhere who faked his identity… and falsely registered under Yang Tianya’s name…"

Li Xuanxuan was silent for a moment before he finally spoke. "Yang Tianya definitely met him. Not only did he meet him, he could even… call him by name."

Li Ximing’s heart stopped. Both Daoist Masters turned to look at him. The old man’s voice was haunting.

"When I was young… I had the good fortune to meet our ancestor. He told me about the Guli Dao conscription. He held a minor officer's post at the time."

The old man’s face was filled with a dawning horror. "He said: 'General Yang was strict with the army, but he ate and lived with us as equals, like family. He personally taught us the Yue military's battle tactics'."

Li Xuanxuan's pupils dilated, his voice trembling slightly. "Now, of course, we know… Yang Tianya was just using the army of ten thousand to refine a weapon… If so! If so! Why would he, a dignified Foundation Establishment cultivator, a descendant of the Yue imperial line, eat and live with mortals as equals, like family…"

"He did it on purpose. He was the first to notice our family, to notice the Wei-Li bloodline within us. Earlier than anyone… earlier than anyone…"

Li Xuanxuan's words were heavy with meaning, sending a chill down Li Ximing's spine. He set down his cup. "Which means… he had already met our ancestor. And he even… intentionally let our ancestor return, to Moongaze Lake."

"And that's why… he vouched for our family for no reason…"

Li Zhouwei's face was grim as he picked up the thread. "So from that moment on, the Underworld's plans were already in motion. It wasn't Peak Master Yuan Tuan who sought us out on Qingsui Peak; it was Diyun Peak that came looking for her. Or at least, it’s possible Diyun Peak intentionally guided her to our door…"

"The exposure of our Wei-Li bloodline… was also within the Yang family's expectations."

Li Ximing was about to speak, but Li Zhouwei's expression grew darker. "If the union of the Wei-Li and Yang bloodlines was orchestrated by the Underworld, then I have a question—a seamless union would require a Li to first enter the Azure Pond Sect. In that case, was it truly a coincidence that the Qingsui Peak cultivator at the time, Si Yuanbai, just happened to be passing by?"

His words made a cold sweat break out on Li Ximing's back. Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes. "If getting a family elder into the sect was the first objective, then the Sword Immortal revealing his talent and obtaining the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance was likely outside their expectations, forcing them to abandon their plan…"

"But what about Si Yuanbai?"

Li Zhouwei's tone turned icy. "He vanished without reason from Azure Pond, with only a vague message about 'fleeing to the west.' He's been gone for over a hundred years, with no trace. No one can find him… Even Si Yuanli has completely forgotten about him… Could there be a reason for that?"

Li Ximing's face remained impassive, but his mind was in turmoil, a tide of cold dread rising within him.

Si Yuanbai.

He was no stranger to the name. Si Yuanbai was, in a sense, his grand-master. His disappearance was a constant sorrow for Xiao Yuansi, something he should have been preoccupied with. But now that it was mentioned, a sudden doubt leaped into his mind.

‘If Master was always thinking about Si Yuanbai… even if Daoist Master Xiao didn't care… back when I reached the Purple Mansion Realm and personally went to the lake to meet him, we spoke for a long time. He should have asked me then…’

‘But he didn't.’

When had Xiao Yuansi remembered Si Yuanbai?

In Cangzhou.

Xiao Yuansi's exact words were: ‘These past years, one matter has repeatedly come to mind.’

‘That was during his time in Cangzhou… In Jiangnan, he wouldn't remember him. Even if he did, the thought would pass fleetingly, without investigation. Only after leaving Jiangnan and reaching Cangzhou in the Northern Sea did he become thoughtful… did he remember to ask me about my grand-master's whereabouts.’

The aged face of Xiao Chuting suddenly appeared in his mind's eye, his weary voice echoing in his ears once more:

‘Be cautious in making friends and offering protection.’

‘Is this something we can truly investigate?’

The whole of Gardenia Scenery Mountain was deathly quiet, the white blossoms dancing in the wind. Li Zhouwei's voice grew lower, more ghostly.

"If that's the case, since they noticed the Wei-Li bloodline so early, wouldn't it be perfectly logical to send a few Underworld emissaries—or not even them, just a couple of cultivators—to keep an eye on us?"
