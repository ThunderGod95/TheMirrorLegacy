# Chapter 806: The Eastern Residence

The crowd raised their cups in celebration. Li Chengzai, wearing a vibrant kerchief, was the picture of high spirits. Li Xixuan, however, kept his eyes wide, sweeping the room again and again as he counted the guests. Whatever ease he had felt outside the courtyard had long since been tossed to the nine heavens.

'The Chen Clan and the An clan didn't send anyone... which is understandable. But the families of Li Chenghao and Li Chengpan didn't even send greetings... There are almost no guests of any real weight from the main lineage.'

Li Xixuan watched grimly. He wasn’t particularly surprised, but any lingering shred of hope vanished. He had come from the bright, clamorous outer courtyard only to find the inner main hall pitch-black. A few children crouched in the corner. Li Xixuan raised his pale, plump hand and ordered softly:

"Get the third son back here!"

Before long, Li Chengzai, still in his colorful kerchief, entered the courtyard sullenly. Facing his father's dark expression, he tried to reason with him:

"...I already asked. Cheng was sent to the Milin Mountains by the old master, and Chengpan is busy near Zhouluo. It's reasonable they couldn't come. Father, why must you look so grim? It makes everyone uncomfortable."

Li Xixuan shot him a look and snapped:

"What do you understand? Although I never cultivated and couldn't recognize what kind of fire that was in the sky that day, several cultivators said the First Young Master, Li Jiangqian, broke through and exited seclusion... Li Zhouluo is amiable, but *he* certainly might not be!"

Li Chengzai frowned. He looked at his father and said:

"Our Eastern Residence is in the tightest spot, so we had to take the lead this time... We were the bird that stuck its neck out. Those above us compromised, everyone divided the benefits, and then they scattered like the wind, leaving the bird that stuck its neck out to be slaughtered... Now, one by one, they wouldn't dare show up."

Li Chengzai had grown up in the residence depending on his father for everything. Hearing this, he panicked. "Ah? What logic is that? We all went to Qingdu together, and we all received the boons. How can they abandon us now? If they do this, who will dare to step up in the future?"

Li Xixuan replied, "You make it sound easy. When those above want to suppress you, they have countless excuses. They'll always find a pretext that satisfies both sides, and then they'll grab us to make an example. It's always the leader who gets beaten. If we don't plan, we are doomed."

Li Chengzai nodded repeatedly. Li Xixuan’s brow remained tightly furrowed. "Before, we had some sway because the clansmen all wanted those boons and sided with us. Now that the boons have been handed out, we're a phoenix that's lost its feathers—worth nothing. Fortunately, I planned ahead... The merit and prestige of the children are genuine, not inflated."

"You children shouldn't make any moves regarding this. Just be honest and keep your heads down. You can't fight any of them. Your only hope is to rely on Minggong's reputation and stay low-key. I will go to the main hall later to apologize. Let everything fall on me, this old man. At worst, I'll suffer a little. Even in the most extreme case, my life won't be in danger."

Li Chengzai hesitated. "But every family is celebrating right now. For Father to go up the mountain... it seems inappropriate. It makes us lose face. Besides, why must we act as if we've done something wrong? The boons we received... compared to the other families, they were the absolute minimum..."

Li Xixuan's face hardened. "How is it inappropriate? Right now, Li Zhouluo is still in charge, and Li Jiangqian has only just emerged. If we don't approach him now, when should we? Wait until Li Jiangqian has his knife at our throats? If Li Zhouluo gives even a slight concession now, it will tie Li Jiangqian's hands regarding us in the future!"

"Oh..." Li Chengzai replied, half-convinced, half-doubting. "The First Young Master... intends to re-enter the island's affairs?"

Li Xixuan laughed in exasperation. This time, he didn't bother responding. He just shook his head and stormed out with a flick of his sleeves.

The front courtyard was full of guests, so he had to cross the threshold of the back courtyard and leave through the rear gate. The early morning mist was still chilly. Li Xixuan pulled his sleeves tighter, his pale, plump face looking listless.

'I fight for this, I fight for that, and in the end, no one is grateful. Boons for this one, boons for that one, but how many of them will actually amount to anything? In the entire Eastern Residence, only Minggong cultivates the path of immortality. This old man is counting his remaining days; I can only help them this much...'

Li Xixuan was the most desperate among the clan elders, precisely because his Yuanwan branch had far too few cultivators.

They were all descendants of Li Xuanxuan, but the other branch—the Yuandu Western Residence led by Li Cheng—had Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang, followed by Li Xinghan and Li Xingsai. Further down, they even had Li Queyi, who was associated with Purple Smoke. As long as a branch had cultivators, they could separate the family holdings without fear of being relegated to the fringes of the island.

The Western Residence had already split into several branches, and their leaders, the Li Zhoufang brothers, were cultivators themselves. Whether it was fighting for boons or finding positions outside, everything was much easier for them. Every clansman they arranged an external post for represented a new path for the future. The more they arranged, the easier things became. How could they compare to him, Li Xixuan, struggling all alone to find a future for his children and grandchildren?

It was bad enough that his descendants couldn't cultivate, but their minds weren't even sharp. How could Li Xixuan not be dismayed!

He huddled into his robes against the cold morning wind, chilled to the bone. His steps felt unsteady. Though the streets were filled with the sound of music, his heart was desolate.

The road from the Eastern Residence to the main hall wasn't long, but the hall sat on high ground. For a mortal, it was a journey guaranteed to leave one soaked in sweat. Li Xixuan usually traveled by sedan chair, but since he was sneaking out today, he had no such luxury. He had to wait by the roadside for a while and hail a carriage.

There were many coachmen and messengers on the island, but these were undignified jobs. Unless they had no other choice, members of the direct line were unwilling to do them. Most of these workers were the family or servants of cultivators who had been promoted onto the island or supplemented the main lineage, trying to subsidize their households.

He climbed into the small carriage, finally feeling some warmth. He drifted in and out of sleep as the carriage rocked along. After an unknown amount of time, the air grew hot and stuffy. He heard a shout from outside:

"Master! We've arrived!"

Li Xixuan lifted the curtain and saw the towering profile of the grand palace. He began to climb out. He was old, and his back and legs were stiff. He stretched out a foot, struggling to reach the ground, when he suddenly felt a cool touch at his waist. A pair of pale hands supported his back, helping him descend smoothly.

He steadied himself on the ground and let out a long breath. Raising his gaze, the first thing he saw was a pair of black boots, devoid of any decoration.

Above them, a crimson robe edged in gold fluttered lightly in the wind. Lifting his eyes slightly higher, he saw a pale face with long eyebrows.

Beneath those dark brows was a pair of golden eyes, watching him with a smile.

Li Xixuan's breath caught, and his heart clenched.

"First Young Master?"

Li Jiangqian was tall and lean, towering over the old man. Apricot-yellow flames still burned in his black hair, glowing faintly. He steadied Li Xixuan, then warmly grasped the elder's plump hand in his own and smiled.

"What a coincidence, meeting you here, Elder... Are you here to...?"

Li Xixuan felt a chill creep into his heart under that gaze. He had forgone a sedan and snuck out the side gate precisely to catch everyone in the hall off guard. How could he possibly tell Li Jiangqian the truth? He forced his expression to remain pleasant. "The matter of the boons has been announced. I came to pay my respects to the Patriarch and thank him for his grace..."

"Oh!" Li Jiangqian began walking toward the hall with him, shaking his head with a smile. "Elder, you are too polite. Though I have cultivated for some years, this is a skill I must learn from you! I was just thinking that during the evaluation, these clansmen were all impeccably behaved, but the moment they received their boons, they would surely go off and indulge themselves... But seeing you, Elder, I see true consistency in word and deed. The people of the Eastern Residence are truly fortunate to have you teaching them. Am I wrong?"

Li Jiangqian's words were always pleasant, but Li Xixuan had no idea what medicine he was selling from his gourd. The elder's scalp tingled. He just wanted to get to the hall, and his pace quickened. The doors were just ahead. He replied:

"Correct..."

Li Jiangqian nodded with a smile. "This junior was considering this very point. I discussed it with the Patriarch just this morning. These clansmen who receive boons... they must be watched more closely. If anyone in their branch, old or young, makes a mistake, the boon must first be suspended, pending review and reconsideration. This will also prevent people from slipping through muddy waters!"

"Ah..." Li Xixuan froze, as if struck by lightning. He stood stunned for a full second, nearly stopping in his tracks.

What had Li Xixuan come here to do? To apologize! With that one statement from Li Jiangqian, the moment he uttered his apology, his entire family's boons would be lost!

He stood dumbstruck for several breaths, his mind racing to formulate a response. He finally managed, "That... seems overly harsh. After all, which family doesn't have old and young? Surely..."

Li Jiangqian sighed, shaking his head and cutting him off. "Elder, your heart is too soft! How is this harsh? The Eastern Residence certainly won't make such mistakes... You needn't worry on behalf of the other branches... Oh... Dili Guang is here. Elder, please!"

Li Jiangqian timed it perfectly, interrupting him just as they reached the hall doors. Before Li Xixuan could respond, Li Jiangqian bowed, dissolved into an apricot-yellow light, and ascended into the sky. Li Xixuan was caught completely off guard as Dili Guang stepped forward to greet him respectfully.

"Elder, the Patriarch is currently receiving cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate. Is there an urgent matter?"

Li Xixuan exhaled deeply, twice. He gave a slight bow with clasped hands and retreated without a word. As he walked down the steps, the old man realized something was wrong and began to think.

'Could such a major decision really be finalized just like that? There wasn't the slightest rumor about it on the island. I was bluffed by that brat!'

He started to turn back, then stopped, afraid. "No... no... Since he said that... how can I possibly go up and apologize now? He's an expert at twisting black into white and white into black. If I go now, he'll spin it as me voluntarily apologizing and sacrificing my descendants' boons to uphold the clan's discipline. I'd be hated to death..."

Li Xixuan's limbs felt cold, and he trembled for a moment. 'There's no solution... no solution. If Minggong doesn't come out of seclusion, the only way to avoid being tormented to death by this kid... is to beg the Old Master!'

***

... Outside the hall was a cacophony, but inside Li Zhouluo’s inner sanctum, it was quiet. Cui Jueyin stood in the center of the hall, turned slightly to the side, hands clasped. He addressed the man seated above:

"Patriarch, this is Fairy Wei... and this is Daoist Cao."

"Greetings, Patriarch." The two bowed slightly. Li Zhouluo immediately replied, "Greetings, esteemed Immortals."

The replacement sent by the Purple Smoke Gate was Tinglan’s confidante, Wei Danying. She wore a yellow feathered robe and looked somewhat awkward. Daoist Cao, meanwhile, was burly, his face covered by a black beard. He held the hand of a small, thin child who looked to be about eight or nine years old.

They were clearly here to deal with Daoist Cao's affair. Cao Chu himself seemed perfectly at ease. Judging by his appearance, he was a straightforward sort. His clenched fists were the size of vinegar bowls. Profound Light flowed over his robes. Ding Mu's thin hand could only grasp one of his fingers. Cao Chu’s voice was deep:

"I am extremely fond of this child. I must trouble the Lake to part with him."

Who exactly he was "extremely fond of" was something everyone present understood clearly. Wei Danying hesitated before speaking.

"Fellow Daoist Cao Chu's situation... I trust the Patriarch is already aware. Since he has expressed the intent to take an apprentice, according to the rules of Purple Smoke, I must come forward and ask the Patriarch... We intend to bring his family along as well."

Wei Danying was clearly not well-acquainted with Cao Chu. The female cultivator knew the matter wasn't exactly respectable, so she phrased the request vaguely. Li Zhouluo couldn't let her lose face. He nodded.

"To be accepted into the mountain gate of Purple Smoke is this child's good fortune. The Lake will provide an additional share of his future cultivation resources. His family may certainly go with him. Please rest assured."

"Excellent!" Cao Chu looked pleased. He clasped his hands, bowed, and broke into a grin. He had a booming voice, and the single word was deafening. Wei Danying looked utterly mortified. She quickly said:

"Fellow Daoist Cao, perhaps you should head down first..."

Cao Chu made no fuss. He gave another cheerful bow and left briskly. The frail Ding Mu hadn't uttered a single sound, forced to take two steps for every one of the man holding his hand, looking as dry as a wooden puppet, yet there was a smile on his face.

Li Zhouluo watched the master and apprentice depart, frowning slightly. Wei Danying breathed a sigh of relief and looked up with a smile.

"This matter has troubled the Patriarch... Cao Chu is rather unreliable within the sect. On normal days, the cultivators on his peak won't even visit him. Fortunately, he only amuses himself with his wives and concubines; his character is otherwise passable..."

Li Zhouluo had seen the glow of Cao Chu's spiritual qi earlier and felt equally awkward.

'How is it that this Cao Chu cultivates Bright Yang... Oh. Actually... it's perfectly fitting that he cultivates Bright Yang...'

The two tacitly skipped the topic. Wei Danying's expression dimmed.

"These past few years, Changxiao and Hengzhu have been fighting fiercely in the Light Boat Sea region. The Changxiao Gate has suffered heavy losses. This should have been good news; my Purple Smoke doesn't have much influence overseas, so it was a good chance to stretch our legs."

"But something happened in the Eastern Sea, and Wen Wu had to be reassigned. This... is very bad. The earth veins in my Purple Smoke Gate's ocean territory have shifted violently. Earth fire and magma have leaked out. It is said the blaze is so bright it can be seen a thousand li away..."

"All the dragon-kin in the sea have fled to the surface. I hear the seafloor is overrun with Baleful Fire Qi, causing utter devastation. Many, many mortals and Demons have died."

The Purple Smoke Gate's strength overseas was inferior to both Changxiao and the Hengzhu Gate. They had invested considerable effort abroad these past years. Seeing Wei Danying's expression, the damage this time must have been significant. After all, the earth veins and fire veins had shifted simultaneously, and since it was in the sea, the water veins were likely affected too. A change in all three would cause catastrophic damage to arrays and structures.

Li Zhouluo’s expression turned grave. He asked in a low voice, "Has the cause been identified...?"

Wei Danying looked frustrated. "It was either a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with extremely profound cultivation in the Dao of Earth Virtue, or it was truly a natural shift in the earth veins—a calamity from nowhere. In any case... not only have the sect's Daoist Masters already gone, but many other cultivators are also being stationed in the Eastern Sea..."

"With so many cultivators mobilized, we will inevitably be short-staffed here with your noble clan. If our progress slows, please do not take offense."

Li Zhouluo nodded grimly, showing he understood. As expected, the Purple Smoke Gate had a reason for telling him this. His own clan's array was not urgent. He said softly:

"It is no matter. It is best that Purple Smoke attends to its own affairs first."

Wei Danying then took her leave. Li Zhouluo escorted her from the hall. She headed north, and Li Zhouluo, observing her route, deduced that Wei Danying was, in all likelihood, heading for the Xuanmiao Temple.

'Daoist Master Sumian follows the Treasured Earth lineage. As an Earth Virtue cultivator, he is an expert on earth veins. It seems she is going to request his help.'
