# Chapter 854: The Fruit of Vengeance

The last vestiges of autumn clung to Moongaze Lake, painting the mountains in a tapestry of red and gold. The sky was a vast, polished canvas, streaked with crimson clouds as the setting sun bled across the horizon, dyeing the world in its fiery glow.

The sea of clouds churned, and a single point of azure-gold light pierced through, absorbing the radiant splendor of the sun and moon's celestial exchange. Only then did it descend, weaving through the forest to land on the large island in the center of the lake.

The sealed entrance to a cavern estate rumbled, shaking off layers of dust. A sliver of red light shot out, flickering before it coalesced before the grand array. It solidified into the form of a woman dressed in a long, cloud-silk gown. Tied at her waist was a talisman etched with the image of a violet-black mountain ghost, which whispered with the sound of a faint wind as she moved.

She took a step forward, raising a hand to catch the azure-gold light from the sky. With a gentle turn of her wrist, the color dissolved into motes of silver.

'Perfect,' she thought. 'I've finally mastered Scattering White Falling Feather.'

She summoned the wind and soared toward the main hall. She hadn't traveled far when she saw a gaunt, white-haired old man bowing before the entrance. She smiled.

"Guest Elder Qu… what brings you here?"

Qu Bushi, lost in thought about how to deliver his report, jumped in fright. He looked up, his expression a mixture of shock and suspicion. Seeing her, he first stared blankly, then hastily bowed.

"First Lady… you've come out of seclusion?!"

Li Que'wan was the most gifted woman of the Jiangque generation, and it had been Li Qinghong herself who had brought her back to the island all those years ago. In Qu Bushi's eyes, her status was exceedingly noble. The old man bowed again, sighing.

"The Family Head will finally have some help… It's about the matter in Jiangbei…"

Before he could say more, the sound of footsteps echoed from within the hall. A young man in crimson robes descended quickly from the dais and came to the door. His eyes lit up, his face a complex mask of joy and worry.

"Sister, you're out!" he exclaimed with a smile. "Why was there no celestial phenomenon?"

Li Que'wan clasped her hands in a salute. "The transformations of my Dao are rooted in the nature of things," she said softly. "A simple sunset is enough. It isn't a Daoist tradition that needs to announce itself to the world."

"Let's speak inside."

Li Jiangqian gestured her in before closing the heavy doors. Once inside, he leaned back toward the entrance and asked Qu Bushi in a low voice, "What is it?"

Qu Bushi hurriedly reported, "The Golden Tang Gate has been defeated. Those men from the Situ family were all gravely wounded. The Gate Master, Situ Biao, had his eyes gouged out and his organs removed to be refined into… one of Daoist Master Bai's artifacts… The Golden Tang Gate has retreated into the mountains. The Hall of the Locust Soul is returning in triumph, and Protector Black Rat will surely head back to Baiku. There's going to be trouble."

"I understand."

Li Jiangqian dismissed him and turned back into the hall, a smile finally gracing his features. "Congratulations, sister. What kind of marvel have you achieved?"

Li Que'wan cultivated the Golden Book of Divine Attendance. Her Immortal Foundation, the 'Awaiting the supreme divine,' was built upon the principles of the Whole Pill. Very few legacies of this nature had survived, and most had never even heard the name. She certainly wouldn't dare speak of it openly, let alone inquire about it.

"The Awaiting the supreme divine," Li Que'wan began to explain, "follows the nurturing path of the Whole Pill. It gathers immortal light and refines golden mercury to evade death and extend life. It allows one to command birds and beasts, to seek immortality through secret arts, and to forge the essences of heaven and earth in the pursuit of longevity."

She paused, a hint of hesitation in her voice. "Fundamentally," she admitted with a shake of her head, "it's a Daoist tradition for secluded cultivation, focused on preserving one's life."

Li Jiangqian listened intently and nodded. "Of the Whole Pill Dao, I've only ever heard of the 'Mibai Gong,' which is quite formidable in combat. The 'Awaiting the supreme divine' seems to lean more toward escape and refining mercurial medicines… which is fitting."

He offered a faint smile. "You have brothers and uncles in the family; we can always protect you. A foundation like yours… is far more beneficial to the clan than what the rest of us have. My own Immortal Foundation provides little support. On a normal day, I can only consume spiritual woods and herbs to advance my cultivation. It's of no use to our clansmen."

"Brother, I must disagree," Li Que'wan countered with a smile.

"Combat is unavoidable. As the saying goes, one cultivates arts to protect the Dao. When Daoist Master Zhaojing was at the Foundation Establishment Realm, he was renowned for his skill in alchemy, yet his cultivation was still peerless, the first among the four 'Xi' generation talents. I've never heard of him losing a fight."

"Not even Daoist Master Yehui, with his three Divine Abilities, could harm him. In the end, it took a great Daoist Master to force him to flee across the sea… If he only knew alchemy, I doubt he would have reached his current heights."

Li Jiangqian looked as if he wanted to argue but simply nodded.

Li Que'wan continued, "The 'Awaiting the supreme divine' provides an incredible boost to the transformation of material properties, likely even stronger than the 'Mibai Gong.' It can harmonize the energies of yin and yang and assist in many conversions among the Five Virtues, primarily Water, Fire, and Metal."

"The second aspect is transformation. This Dao can alter one's appearance and form, disguise artifacts and formations, and even conceal one's Daoist tradition. If I break through to the Divine Ability realm, the potential for change will be immense, no longer confined to a human body."

Li Jiangqian nodded silently, lost in thought.

Li Que'wan's expression grew worried. "The Whole Pill Dao fears only three things. First is 'Converging Water,' which can disperse mercury into sand. Second is 'Merging Fire,' a viler threat that burns mercury and melts lead, destroying spiritual essence. The last is 'Primordial Lightning,' which is known today as the Dao of Primordial Magnetism…"

Li Jiangqian sounded regretful. "A pity. The Dao of 'Converging Water' is currently flourishing, making it difficult to avoid. 'Merging Fire' is also a well-known tradition. As for 'Primordial Lightning,' it has faded into obscurity for a long time. I've heard it only exists in the Wu State, so you needn't worry too much."

Li Que'wan nodded in agreement. "Then there is the Scattering White Falling Feather. It's an unheard-of escape art. I struggled to grasp its basics for the longest time, but by harnessing the cohesive power of the 'Awaiting the supreme divine,' the celestial phenomenon aligned with the principles of transformation, and I finally managed to master it."

The cultivation of the Whole Pill Dao had always been strange. Li Jiangqian was surprised that even the celestial phenomenon of a breakthrough could aid one's training. "Congratulations," he said. "Might I see it? I've never heard of a Whole Pill escape art."

"It would be unwise." Li Que'wan shook her head. "This escape art is akin to a cultivator's blood escape. Using it to flee takes a heavy toll on one's vital energy and cultivation. It's not something to be demonstrated lightly."

As understanding dawned on Li Jiangqian's face, the door opened and Li Xuanxuan entered from a side entrance. Dressed in ink-blue robes, the old man's face was wreathed in smiles, and he carried a small box.

"Wan'er!"

Of Li Xuanxuan's many children, few had amounted to much besides Li Ximing. If Li Zhouming was the apple of his eye, then Li Que'wan was the flesh of his heart. Seeing him now, the two younger cultivators bowed together. The old man placed the box on the table and helped them up, one with each hand. "Congratulations, Que'wan," he beamed. "Take a look at this…"

Li Que'wan accepted the box. It was no larger than a pillow. Inside, nestled on a bed of golden cotton, was a single, silver-grey droplet of mercury the size of a fingernail.

Her gaze was instantly captivated.

"In the northern riverlands," the old man explained, "there's a place called the Tiefu Kingdom, territory of the demonic Helian family. They sent people during the north-south conflict, a man named Helian Changguang. He was slain by Xuanfeng at the Great Ning Palace, and this treasure was found on his body… We couldn't tell if it was a spiritual item or a Dharma Art artifact. It was just this drop of mercury."

"It's an item of the Whole Pill nature, which none of us could identify. The Helian family also has Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, so we never brought it out. We've kept it until today."

"Then, when Ximing broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, I remembered this item and showed it to him. He said it was a Dharma Art artifact, not a spiritual item, and that it could only be unsealed by a Whole Pill Dharma Art."

Li Que'wan conjured a wisp of silver light and let it fall onto the mercury droplet. After a moment of calculation, she picked it up, her face filled with delight. "It is undoubtedly a Whole Pill artifact. It is ancient… one could call it an artifact, but it feels more like a legacy… It truly has an archaic quality."

She closed the droplet in her palm, and as her spiritual energy flowed into it, a silver light flashed. The droplet had vanished, already absorbed into her Sea of Qi.

"The refinement is so fast!"

Li Que'wan closed her eyes for a breath to experience it. "This artifact is a treasure for internal cultivation," she said softly. "It resides within the Dantian and can assist in casting Dharma Arts. It also has the effect of clarifying the spiritual sense and invigorating the mind. When necessary, it can even serve as a medium for Whole Pill transformations."

"It contains a technique called the 'Profound Art of the Blood-Silver Dew.' It's an ancient demonic art that consumes blood essence and uses lead-mercury arts to form a pill…"

The nature of the art was clearly problematic. Li Que'wan sighed. "In terms of lifesaving potential, this art is only a step below my Scattering White Falling Feather. Unfortunately, it is a demonic art. While a few of its spell arts might be usable, the entire Daoist tradition is of no benefit to our family."

"As for the artifact itself, it can be brought out to face enemies or to save one's life… For our family, the artifact itself is what holds value."

Li Xuanxuan sighed. "As long as it's useful. But while the Helian family has declined, they are still surrounded by powerful enemies and have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Just be sure they don't recognize it."

Li Que'wan nodded slightly. The item was stored in her Dantian, not worn on her waist, so it wouldn't be easily identified. Besides, it was uncertain whether the item had belonged to the Helian family or if Helian Changguang had found it himself. She decided to set the matter aside for now and asked about Jiangbei.

Li Jiangqian gave her a brief summary, his brow furrowed. "Regarding Second Uncle's murder, the Capital immortals Dao sent Gongsun Bofan to clarify their position. Guan Gongxiao is extremely anxious about this and has sent several letters professing his innocence. It doesn't seem like the Capital immortals Dao was involved."

"My earlier thought was… it was for the best that you were in seclusion, to avoid being entangled in this mess. But now that you're out, and I've tested that the Talisman Seed is indeed effective, I will tell you."

His expression darkened. "Several months ago, Second Uncle was killed, and Daoist Master Tinglan has yet to appear. I suspect something is very wrong in Jiangbei. You are skilled in shamanic arts, so I wanted your insight."

Having been in seclusion for so long, Li Que'wan barely knew this 'Second Uncle.' She felt a brief moment of sympathy before looking up sharply. "Were his remains recovered?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head grimly. This complicated things. "Does he have any descendants?" Li Que'wan asked. "We could try using their blood essence… but the method is imprecise and can lead to false readings."

At this, Li Xuanxuan immediately stroked his beard. "I will go and fetch some."

As the old man exited through the side door, Li Jiangqian lowered his voice. "Wan'er, act within your limits. Don't injure yourself."

He clearly feared the matter involved the Purple Mansion Realm and could endanger Li Que'wan. Li Xuanxuan valued kinship, so Li Jiangqian wouldn't say such things in front of him. But in the eyes of the Li Family Head, a Purple Mansion Realm prospect like Li Que'wan was paramount. As for the others, mortal or cultivator, if they died, they died. It was merely a question of the magnitude of the loss.

"It's alright," Li Que'wan replied gently. "My shamanic arts is profound. With the Talisman Seed, unless I am trying to scry on a Purple Mansion Realm expert directly, it won't be a problem."

They waited a short while before Li Xuanxuan returned with a small vial of blood essence. Li Que'wan produced three ivory tokens from her sleeve, placing them in a triangular formation with the vial in the center. She contemplated for three breaths, then drew one of the tokens, repeating the process nine times.

When she finished, the spiritual glow around her slowly faded, and her face turned a shade pale. "A ninefold vengeance," she announced gravely. "Consumed by eastern flames, leaving no bones behind."

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian let out a cold laugh.

Li Que'wan elaborated tactfully, "Second Uncle… or someone in his direct bloodline, was incinerated by a fire-virtue Daoist tradition from the east. The nine-for-nine result indicates that this matter is widely known. The consistency of the nine results means no Purple Mansion Realm Divine Ability was involved. It was an act of vengeance, a blood feud to the death…"

The implication pointed directly at Crimson Reef Island. Li Jiangqian slammed a hand down on the armrest of the main seat, the truth crystallizing in his mind. He rubbed the armrest twice. "Widely known," he muttered. "A fine 'widely known.'"

"It has to be Guo Hongjian… Crimson Reef Island made the move, and everyone knows… They were likely allowed to pass through Lake Xian and the Sacred Writ Gate's territory on purpose."

The situation was crystal clear to Li Jiangqian. He sneered. "Our family and Crimson Reef Island are mortal enemies. If I were Guan Gongxiao, no matter how friendly I was with Crimson Reef, I would never reveal our tacit understanding. The news reaching the Eastern Sea would surely be that our two families were locked in battle."

"So that bastard got impatient. He made inquiries on the mainland and found that our families were merely in a standoff across the river, with no major casualties. He grew anxious and secretly killed one of our own to provoke a full-scale war, forcing the Guan family to fully side with Crimson Reef."

"He played his hand well."

Li Que'wan put away the three tokens. "If Second Uncle's ancestors were never killed by Merging Fire, then this result points to him. It was undoubtedly Crimson Reef Island."

Li Jiangqian's voice dropped. "As for your conclusion that no Purple Mansion Realm Divine Ability was involved, you're correct. This area is highly sensitive, after all. However, it's possible several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators tacitly allowed this to happen. They couldn't have been blind to the understanding between our families. Either they thought a real war between us would be better, or… it was some other kind of test."

Li Jiangqian let out a breath and strode quickly toward the entrance, pushing the doors open. "Go and summon Purple Smo—"

Before he could finish, a streak of True Fire descended from the sky. Li Minggong landed hastily before the hall, her tone urgent. "No need."

"Qian Lizi of the Purple Smoke Gate has arrived at the lake," She said grimly. "She is asking to see the Li Family Head by name!"

A knot of dread formed in Li Jiangqian's stomach. He glanced at the others around him. "Show her in."

A few moments after the order was given, a woman of breathtaking beauty in a white immortal robe appeared at the entrance. At her waist hung a bottle of glazed white jade—it was the prodigy of this generation from the Purple Smoke Gate, Qian Lizi, also known as the Treasured Vase.

Not only did this Qian Lizi act as the sect's interim leader, but she was also the master of Li Quexi, a direct descendant of the Li family!

Yet now, her expression was cold, her eyes betraying a hint of desperation. Her gaze locked onto Li Jiangqian. "Family Head," she said in a low voice, "may I have a word in private?"

Her words only worsened Li Jiangqian's feeling of unease. He dismissed the others. The moment the hall doors closed, Qian Lizi took a step forward.

"Family Head," she asked anxiously, "do you have a way to contact Daoist Master Zhaojing?!"

Li Jiangqian hesitated for a second. The woman clearly realized her question was shockingly blunt and impolite. The urgency on her face subsided slightly. "Family Head, please forgive my brashness. My master has gone missing north of Jiangbei and has yet to return. The blessed land has already sent people to the various Supreme Yang Daoist traditions for aid. Daoist Master Zhu Gong and Daoist Master Kui Qi have gone to Jiangbei to search… I hope… your clan's Daoist Master can prioritize the greater situation and return to oversee Jiangbei."

'Something *has* happened in Jiangbei!'

Qian Lizi had humbled herself completely. Within the blessed land, she stood second to only one, above tens of thousands. For a representative of a mighty Supreme Yang Daoist tradition to come here and plead so earnestly showed just how dire the situation was.

But as Li Jiangqian processed her words, a chilling realization washed over him. He stepped down from the main seat. "This… them… the matter of the True Monarch, that was an order from Mount Luoxia!"

Qian Lizi bowed her head and said nothing, as if she hadn't heard him. Li Jiangqian immediately schooled his expression, his earlier suspicions finding a terrifying explanation that struck him like a thunderclap.

'Crimson Reef Island… was their action a test to see if our Daoist Master had returned, or was it a test to see if Daoist Master Zimu had gone missing?!'

He pressed on, "What were Daoist Master Qiuhu's instructions?"

Compared to the news Qian Lizi brought, Li Jiangqian was clearly more interested in what was happening at the Purple Mansion Realm level. At his question, Qian Lizi lowered her head slightly and sighed. "We have received no news from the Daoist Master."

The implications of that statement were vast. Ning Wan didn't have a trusted subordinate like Qian Lizi in the Azure Pond Sect. It was possible that Sect Master Dantai Jin was still completely in the dark!

If Tinglan and Ning Wan left Lake Xian, it meant the affairs on both sides of the river would plunge into chaos. The True Monarch's business at Mount Luoxia would surely proceed, but without a Divine Ability overseeing the region, there was no guarantee the powers along the river wouldn't be drawn into conflict! And with Ning Wan gone, Li Quantao on Lake Xian would be like a small boat in a storm, at the mercy of the raging waves.

"What about the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate?" Li Jiangqian demanded. "And the Hengzhu Immortal Dao?"

A flicker of helplessness crossed Qian Lizi's exquisite face. She shook her head. "The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate… Daoist Master Lingmei gave instructions long ago that the gate would not involve itself in any of Jiangbei's affairs. As for the Hengzhu Immortal Dao… it's better not to speak of them!"

At the mention of Hengzhu, her expression became complicated—a mix of disappointment and anxiety. It was obvious she had suffered some embarrassing setback involving them, and the memory still stung.

Li Jiangqian fell silent. He watched as Qian Lizi's anxiety slowly morphed into suspicion. He knew he couldn't stall any longer. Just as he expected, the woman's voice took on a sorrowful, pleading tone.

"Regarding Jiangbei, my master gave an order long ago to fully protect your clan and prevent the immortal's passage across the river. Now my master is missing under suspicious circumstances. We are not asking your clan's Daoist Master to rescue her, only that he return to take control of the situation!"

"This isn't a matter for my sect alone! Across the river lies Moongaze Lake! We cannot contact either Daoist Master. Without a Purple Mansion expert, all our deployments in Jiangbei are meaningless. How can this be allowed?!"

But Li Jiangqian's mind was sharp. He wasn't thrown off by her barrage of questions. A deep suspicion arose within him.

'The Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition… Jiangnan has so many Purple Mansion Realm experts. Even if Hengzhu won't act, can they not find a single person to go to Jiangbei and take charge? Why must they ask for our Daoist Master to return?'

The Supreme Yang Daoist traditions were incredibly powerful. Any one of their Daoist Masters could stabilize the riverbank situation. Yet this woman had come to ask for Li Ximing. It felt wrong, no matter how he looked at it. He stared at her intently. "Senior Han… the esteemed masters of the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions, are they not able to manage the situation? It is just a disappearance; does it require all the masters to go searching? Please, answer this junior honestly… is Daoist Master Tinglan truly just… missing?"

Qian Lizi froze, taken aback by his question. She re-evaluated the young man before her, then bit her lip. "This… should not be spoken of freely. But since you have asked, I must answer."

"In our blessed land… the soul lamp has dimmed. There must have been a great battle in the north. Daoist Master Zhu Gong and Daoist Master Kui Qi may have to intervene. We do not know what their final condition will be… or if they can return to stand guard. Daoist Master Houfu is stretched thin in the Long region… If your clan's Daoist Master does not return, there will be no one to hold the line."

For such a thing to happen at such a critical time, it was impossible that Mount Luoxia was unaware. Li Jiangqian's face was grim. "What power dares to be so audacious? To ambush a Daoist Master of a Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in the open…"

Qian Lizi's expression grew even more complex, her voice dropping to a near whisper. "I suspect this is the disaster left behind from the 'Qi Wang Profound-Heaven Hearing' incident all those years ago… Back then, it was the Azure Pond and Purple Smoke sects that plotted together, and an elder of your clan was also involved… Now that the two great Daoist Masters have fallen, the north has begun to have ideas!"

Li Jiangqian let out a long, heavy breath.

The woman before him continued, "Furthermore, with no Purple Mansion Realm expert watching from above, are you truly at ease regarding the Fei family matter?"

Li Jiangqian was silent.

A prominent Immortal Clan like theirs surely had a way to alert Li Ximing. He could not possibly fool a well-informed member of the Purple Smoke Gate. He could only reply formally, "This junior means no disrespect. But I am young, and this matter is not for me to decide. I must consult with my elders!"

Qian Lizi stiffened and took a step back. "I implore you to decide quickly!" she bit out.

Li Jiangqian had just taken a step when both of them looked up sharply. A distant tremor had reached their ears. As Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, how could they not perceive such a subtle vibration? They exchanged a look and rushed out of the hall.

Sure enough, a torrential downpour was now lashing the lake. Within the sky-blotting rain clouds stood ranks of cultivators. Li Que'wan and the others were staring north, their faces etched with worry.

In the northern sky, a pillar of golden light shot toward the heavens. Vague plumes of dust and smoke rose into the air as dark clouds gathered and rain began to fall, creating a scene of shocking gloom.

'That's the direction of the Hall of the Locust Soul. A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator has fallen… possibly more than one…'

"Where is Qu Bushi!" Li Jiangqian roared, turning his head.

He then noticed that Qian Lizi beside him was staring blankly at the northern sky. Her fists were clenched, her entire body trembling with what seemed like a mixture of fear and excitement. Her beautiful eyes were locked on the distant horizon, her lips moving in a silent whisper.

Seeing this, a chill ran down Li Jiangqian's spine. He had long suspected her entanglement with a True Monarch was deep, though he hadn't known which one. Now, he hastily took a step back, averting his gaze from her eyes.

"Senior!" he cried out.
