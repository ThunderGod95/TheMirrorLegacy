# Chapter 779: The Rules

After a moment's consideration, Li Xinghan made a mental note to ask Li Xuanxuan about this later. Outwardly, she accepted the decision.

"Since the elder has commanded it, then we will have to trouble you, Brother."

Li Zhouluo was dressed in black. He cultivated the Gleaming Gold Qi, and regardless of his personality, his aura possessed a certain stern quality that inspired confidence. He clasped his hands in a salute and said solemnly, "Rest assured, little sister."

Nearby, Li Zhouming looked from one to the other, wanting to speak but hesitating. Li Zhouluo had managed Mount Qingdu and had punished Li Zhouming several times before, so he was naturally afraid of him. And though his younger sister Li Xinghan was young, the sword on her back and the heavy killing intent she carried were just as intimidating. He couldn't bring himself to say anything.

Li Xinghan couldn't muster any affection for the Purple Mansion expert's direct grandson, either. The Daoist Master had few descendants to begin with, and the one he finally got was utterly useless. Though Li Xinghan was often away, she had heard the rumors.

'I've heard... that when he's assigned to a post, he becomes greedy, yet in the clan center, he's burdened by incompetence. The Daoist Master doesn't value him and hasn't given him any decent Dharma Artifacts. He's useless in a fight, nearly losing to a cultivator from some minor family. He's a complete disgrace. The old man is just afraid of losing his only direct grandson... He sees him idling about all day and just wants him to stay out of trouble...'

In the end, Li Zhouming was a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion cultivator. For the Daoist Master's sake, it was no great burden for the family to support him. But Li Xinghan disliked him intensely. She turned to leave, but as she reached the hall's entrance, she saw the Li Zhoufang brothers following her fourth brother, Li Zhouluo, their heads bowed low. She vaguely overheard their voices:

'We two brothers... our father worked himself to death on the river, and now our younger brother is also dead... Regarding the clan's compensation, we hope you can grant his child a sinecure...'

Only then did Li Xinghan remember that the deceased Li Zhouken was, in fact, the biological younger brother of the Li Zhoufang brothers, given up for adoption to carry on another family line. The two were taciturn in front of elders but cared deeply for the younger generation of their own branch. They were here to beg for an official post.

'One should receive resources from the island commensurate with one's talent and effort... Sinecures are usually reserved for outsiders. The clan fears its own descendants will become complacent through generations of entitlement and rarely does such a thing... aigh!'

Li Xinghan realized that her first and second elder brothers were excellent in every way, save for a powerful obsession with this idea of hereditary privilege. She couldn't help but pause, wanting to go back and say something, but she heard a voice call out from behind her.

"Sister!"

It was Li Zhouming, who had followed her out.

'Forget it... Brother Zhouluo should be able to handle this.'

Li Xinghan had no choice but to stop. Facing the fan-wielding young man, she remained polite. "Fifth Brother, is there something you need?"

Li Zhouming clasped his hands together and smiled. "I heard that sister will be leading a group to the western deserts to eliminate a band of rogue demonic cultivators. I've heard there's a type of material in the desert called White Falcon Gold, which can't be bought on the lake. It can be used to forge Dharma Artifacts. Could I trouble you to bring some back for me? I'll compensate you with spiritual resources."

Li Xinghan was a little surprised. "You're starting to think about Dharma Artifacts? That's wonderful news. I'll be sure to bring it for you."

Li Zhouming let out a breath of relief, thanked her profusely, and scurried off. The woman, meanwhile, mounted the wind and flew toward the island's center, a thought turning over in her mind.

'How strange.'

Pondering this, she first detoured to her own cave-residence to pack. By the time the sky began to dim, she landed before a courtyard on the island. The two kumquat pots that used to flank the gate had been replaced with stone lions treading on golden rocks. The woman sized them up for a moment, hesitating.

"So much more extravagant!"

Pushing the gate open, a smile finally appeared on Li Xinghan's face. "Mother!" she called out.

The woman was instantly overjoyed and hurried to greet her. A man tasting wine in the courtyard looked over, and her brother and sister-in-law put down what they were doing and rushed out from the inner room. The whole family immediately pulled her inside with cheerful commotion.

In truth, Li Xinghan's family had once been fraught with conflict. Her father's cultivation was mediocre and he felt unappreciated, while her brother and sister-in-law had even harbored thoughts of splitting from the family. No one cared whether she came home or not. But ever since she had descended from Gardenia Scenery Mountain, her brother and sister-in-law couldn't be driven away. The house was filled with laughter day in and day out, and every time she returned, it felt like a festival.

She was pulled down to sit beside her father, listening to her mother, whose face was beaming. "Han'er! Your uncle has been accumulating merit for so long, he's finally been promoted to be an aide on Wutu Peak!"

A peak aide was already a high position in the Li family, with very few openings. Moreover, Wutu Peak was considered prosperous. Li Xinghan was delighted. "He's finally made it!"

But after the initial joy, something felt wrong. Her uncle was stained by his connection to the remnants of the Yu Clan, and his cultivation wasn't high. Logically, it should have been very difficult for him to be appointed to such a position. Her smile faded. "When was the appointment made?"

Her mother smiled. "It was announced at noon. He was just as surprised and delighted. This position is a great honor. I heard he's been so busy he still hasn't come back..."

'Noon?'

A jolt went through Li Xinghan's heart.

'I had only just left... and Brother Zhouluo specifically promoted him...'

The joy drained from Li Xinghan's face, replaced by a sense of confusion. She held her bamboo chopsticks, unable to decide whether to pick up the food before her. She fell silent.

Li Xinghan asked herself honestly: the Jade True Qi she cultivated, the Treasured Qi of True Unity, was the result of her uncle, Chi Tiaozong, giving up his own cultivation to sit at an altar year after year, chanting sutras to gather it for her. To put it bluntly, the fact that she had earned the Daoist Master's favor and might one day reach Foundation Establishment was at least half due to her uncle's efforts.

Even in her early days, her uncle had provided more than enough help with resources and guidance on her path. While her current cultivation was indeed mostly thanks to the clan's support, it was her uncle who had helped her stand out in the first place.

Her silence grew heavier. Seeing her expression, her family in the courtyard suddenly quieted down. Her father, beside her, glanced at her and said in a low voice, "Zhouluo is in charge of the family today, and you are one of the most prominent figures of the Zhou generation. Some things you just have to accept. Your uncle has worked hard for decades; it's time he received his reward."
 
"Are you going to be an ungrateful wretch and ask your fourth brother to retract the order? Is your uncle not doing his job correctly, or is your fourth brother's promotion based on merit not just? You had better give me a reason!"

It was true that Chi Tiaozong was competent, but it was also true that Li Zhouluo had promoted him as a favor to thank her for her support. Her uncle had finally achieved a breakthrough in his official career. Li Xinghan truly could not bring herself to refuse this kindness...

Li Xinghan usually looked down on those who engaged in favoritism, but at this moment, her lips parted and closed, unable to form a single word. She put down her chopsticks and said quietly, "Let's just cherish this... I am away all year. The family should carry on as usual. Don't be extravagant, especially since the elders are in mourning. It's best to keep things simple."

The middle-aged man beside her put down his wine. "Eldest son, tomorrow you will sell the stone lions at the gate and put the two kumquat pots back."

"But Father, you just carefully picked those out a few days ago, you were so happy... you were always going to the gate to look at them... why sell them now..." her brother lamented.

His wife shushed him. She took Li Xinghan's hand and said in a low voice, "Speaking of the elders' affairs... you're an important figure on the island now. Your own safety comes first. If anything happens to you, all of this family's hopes will be ruined."

Before Li Xinghan could answer, her father spoke with earnest gravity. "We all understand... serving the lake is important. But while serving the lake, letting your own friends and family benefit a little is not a conflict of interest. Who can truly act like a saint, completely untainted by personal gain?"

"Daughter understands."

Li Xinghan listlessly ate a few bites, finding it hard to swallow. She knew her father was about to start asking for a post for her brother, so she quickly excused herself from the table. Her father said nothing, but her mother saw her all the way out.

Outside the courtyard, her spiritual sense could still clearly perceive the scene within. Without her, the large table of food seemed suddenly empty. Her mother was wiping away tears, her father was sighing, and her brother and sister-in-law exchanged a glance. There was a long silence, until she heard her father's voice.

"She fancies herself too pure... without her, there's still your uncle. You won't be short an official post. It just won't look as good and might attract the attention of the Clan Justicar from Mount Qingdu. Tomorrow, you'll come with me..."

Li Xinghan couldn't bear to listen anymore. She walked away quickly, mounted the wind, and let the cold night air rush against her face, her heart bleak.

'Pure? If I were truly like Great-Aunt Minggong and the others, who think only of the good of the lake, my uncle wouldn't have a post to begin with! It's just that I care more about appearances... In the end... his favor wasn't great enough to command me...'

Since childhood, Li Xinghan had held to her Sword Heart, upholding justice and eradicating evil. Now, a thought was gradually becoming clear in her mind.

"I used to think that the constant favoritism on the island was a failure of Mount Qingdu's duty. Now it seems, this is a justice I cannot even uphold myself."

She rode the wind all the way to Mount Qingdu. The side peak was draped in white. An old man, leaning on a staff, was pacing on the summit. Li Xinghan had never seen him rest, and this time was no exception. She bowed.

"Old Master!"

Li Xuanxuan merely glanced at her. "Xinghan, you're here! Is it about Zhouluo's matter? Come inside and talk."

Li Xuanxuan's seniority was immense. Li Xinghan followed respectfully behind him into a pavilion. Once inside, Li Xinghan said deferentially, "The Old Master's orders are naturally well-considered. This junior has no objections. In the family, only Fourth Brother is capable of this great responsibility. It is just that this junior has just gotten a taste of clan affairs and is about to depart again, and my heart is somewhat uneasy..."

She hesitated for a few breaths, then said anxiously, "On the lake... there is much favoritism... cultivators value personal relationships heavily... Xinghan... is guilty!"

Li Xinghan recounted what had happened with her family. Li Xuanxuan stopped what he was doing and nodded silently. The old man sighed. "Xinghan... how old is your father? What is his cultivation level?"

Li Xinghan quickly cupped her hands. "My father is forty-seven years old, at the fourth level of Embyronic Breathing."

Li Xuanxuan nodded slowly. "That child... his path of cultivation, for this life, has already come to an end. He has but a few decades left. Xinghan... can you reach Foundation Establishment?"

Li Xinghan gave a slight nod. "This child will do her best. There is still hope."

The old man let out a long sigh. "And Purple Mansion?"

Li Xinghan could only say, "I dare not hope for it!"

Li Xuanxuan said in a low voice, "For many people in this world, the road of cultivation stops very early. It's not just you who doesn't think about the Purple Mansion Realm; even the young masters rarely dare to hope for it. For all of you, once you reach Foundation Establishment, your cultivation has nearly reached its limit. But you have a great deal of time left."

"On this lake, cultivators like your father are countless. Eighty percent of cultivators stop at Embyronic Breathing. A small portion manage to refine some miscellaneous qi, but their path also ends. The rest get stuck in Qi Refining; most can't advance after a few levels. And then there's the last handful, stuck at the peak of Qi Refining."

The old man seemed to be in a daze. "They have no further path in the Dao. Their cultivation for this life is over. What can they do with the hundreds of years of time they have left? When these cultivators who can't advance a single step have nothing to do, who can control them? No one can!"

Li Xinghan remained silent.

Li Xuanxuan continued languidly, "Don't underestimate them. Preying on mortals, taking a thousand wives and concubines, murdering for blood, cultivating demonic arts—they are capable of all of it! The fact that they now engage in favoritism and scheme for the security of their descendants is already the best possible outcome under our guidance."

The old man said quietly, "Xijun created such a complex, clearly stratified system of bureaucracy, relationships, supervision, and motivation for a reason... Han'er... sometimes we don't need them... but keeping them busy is very important, for us and for the mortals. We can't always keep them busy with merit alone."

Li Xinghan stared blankly at the old man before her.

Li Xuanxuan said, "Later, Zhouwei found various excellent medicines for breaking through bottlenecks. Some of them weren't as useful as imagined, but they had to make sure their descendants were well-arranged before they would be willing to enter seclusion to risk their lives for that slim chance of a breakthrough... A certain degree of sheltering descendants, of relying on personal connections to seek office, is not necessarily an evil thing."

"In the current age, with people everywhere refining blood essence, you cannot hold them to too high a standard."

Li Xinghan clenched her fists slightly. The treasured sword on her back glinted coldly in the moonlight. She asked in a low voice, "Old Master... but is this... truly in accordance with the righteous path..."

The old man leaned back in his chair, his snow-white beard resting on the back of his wrinkled hand. Li Xuanxuan seemed tired. He said softly, "We cannot control a group of eternally greedy people... we can only redirect their greed elsewhere. Han'er, things are not accomplished overnight. Perhaps your generation will have a better way, but to protect the peace of the mortals, this is how it must be for now."

The confusion in Li Xinghan's eyes slowly cleared. She nodded thoughtfully.

"Xinghan, I already spoke with your fourth brother about this in the morning. I only want you to understand one principle."

The old man was hunched in the high-backed mahogany chair, shrinking into the shadows of the room. For a moment, he seemed incredibly ancient. His voice was extremely soft.

"Many things that seem to be outside the rules are, in fact, within them."

...

Island Center.

The night was thick. The great hall was still brightly lit, with scrolls and documents stacked high on the desk. Li Zhouluo read through them carefully, one hand propping up his head, lost in thought.

It was his first time in control of the Pingya Island, and he felt a great unease. After settling matters with his siblings in the morning, he had been busy in this spot until now. He had only just learned many of the clan's secrets.

'So... so many of the retainers are directly subordinate to the island. The family has quite a few geniuses from outside clans. There are even two who failed their Foundation Establishment breakthrough on the island...'

He examined the documents in detail. Well past midnight, he heard someone come up to report.

"My lord, the Third Young Master has returned from the eastern shore. He is waiting outside the hall."

Li Zhouluo quickly put down his brush. "Quickly, show him in."
