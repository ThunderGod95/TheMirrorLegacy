# Chapter 749: Selecting the Market Site

Dantai Jin was a direct descendant of the Purple Mansion lineage. With the Si family's own numbers dwindling, and to diminish the appearance of a hostile takeover, Si Yuanli had appointed Dantai Jin to manage the sect's affairs while he was in seclusion. Though it was framed as a merit-based selection, Dantai Jin was, for all intents and purposes, a Si clansman.

Li Xizhi guided him to a seat. Dantai Jin accepted the offered tea, took a sip, and savored it for a moment before smiling.

"Excellent tea."

Now that he was the brother of a Purple Mansion Daoist Master, Li Xizhi had the standing to sit and share tea with a direct descendant like Dantai Jin. Si Tongyi, despite his lesser cultivation, was the most promising of the Si family's younger generation and could have rightfully joined them. However, ever one to humble himself, he stood respectfully to the side in the posture of a junior.

After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Li Xizhi inquired, "Your Excellency has graced my Heaven-Probing Pavilion with your immortal presence. What instructions do you have for me?"

Dantai Jin quickly waved his hand, shaking his head. "I wouldn't dare say 'instructions'. I merely have a small matter or two to trouble you with, Pavilion Lord."

He set down his teacup, his expression turning serious. "The Si family has a talented young man who has just begun Qi Refining. His aptitude is remarkable, and his understanding of spiritual arts far surpasses his peers. Tongyi has observed him closely and fears that our own tutelage might tarnish this uncut jade. Thus, we were hoping he might be accepted as your disciple… If you would not be opposed, Xizhi, I ask that you meet him."

The moment Dantai Jin finished speaking, Si Tongyi stepped forward and presented a wooden box with both hands. "Pavilion Lord, your mastery of spiritual arts is divine," he said. "Our family would not dare ask for your Dao lineage lightly. This is a copy of the Heavenly Glow Dao lineage's 'Five-Colored Sinking Sword Art', a fourth-grade ancient spell that a Daoist Master of our family acquired in the north many years ago. For a century, none have been able to master it. Only the Pavilion Lord is worthy of such a technique."

Si Tongyi's declaration—'Pavilion Lord, your mastery of spiritual arts is divine, our family would not dare ask for your Dao lineage lightly'—left Li Wushao, who was standing nearby, momentarily stunned. He almost missed the words that followed, marveling inwardly.

'Damn, a direct descendant of the Si family… It's amazing how polite they are when a Purple Mansion Daoist Master is involved.'

Li Xizhi, however, found the situation slightly surreal.

'They're actually coming to me, asking to join my sect.'

He had to admit, the "Five-Colored Sinking Sword Art" was incredibly tempting. It wasn't just a sword technique but a true spiritual art, one deeply intertwined with one's sword-related cultivation. The Li family possessed a similar text, the "Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts," which was even more purely focused on its spiritual art aspects.

Li Xizhi had been searching for such an art for a long time. His own "Rainbow Pierce Skyway" could directly enhance his proficiency with spiritual arts, and his innate talent for the sword was not weak. In his hands, this art could produce truly extraordinary results.

But no matter how tempted he was, he showed no eagerness on his face. Accepting this disciple would undoubtedly strengthen his ties to the Si family, and he was unsure of his brother's stance on the matter. He couldn't agree immediately.

"You are too kind, Tongyi," he replied. "But the matter of accepting a disciple hinges on the affinity between master and student. I cannot risk hindering your clan's prodigy! This isn't something to be settled with a simple nod. We must choose an auspicious day for me to meet and test him…"

Hearing this, Dantai Jin nodded in understanding. He knew Li Xizhi needed to consult Li Ximing first. "What does the Pavilion Lord propose?" he asked.

"Send the boy over first," Li Xizhi answered. "Let me see if we have an affinity. I will select two Daoist texts and test him a little. We shall see if fate wills it."

Both men understood perfectly well what "fate" implied. Having settled the matter, they moved on.

"With the death of Senior Changxi, the Profound Peak region has descended into chaos," Dantai Jin said. "Shanji Prefecture is now beset by enemies on all sides, and the number of demonic cultivators has risen sharply. I hear the heirs of the Profound Peak Gate have gone into the wilderness, leaving the riverside territories without protection. Demonic cultivators from the Eastern Sea can now slip in."

"If Shanji Prefecture falls into disarray, these demonic cultivators and beasts might try to pass through our Azure Pond Sect's territory. We plan to bolster our defenses and will likely send a contingent of disciples there. If any of your own disciples are seeking experience, Xizhi, they are welcome to join them."

Li Xizhi casually agreed. With his business concluded, Dantai Jin finished his tea, and he and Si Tongyi made a motion to depart. A thought suddenly occurred to Li Xizhi, and he asked, "May I know the name, age, and cultivated arts of your clan's young disciple?"

"Ah, how could I forget!" Si Tongyi said with a serious expression. "The boy is of the 'Xun' generation and was given the name 'Hui'. He is just eighteen and cultivates the 'Empty Response Dispersion', an immortal foundation that excels in the practice of spiritual arts. Once he reaches Foundation Establishment, his prowess will soar to new heights."

Li Xizhi nodded thoughtfully and had Li Wushao escort them out. Though the old serpent was of humble bloodline, his status was now considerable. As a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, he commanded respect from everyone, and even Si Tongyi greeted him with a polite smile.

Once outside the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, Dantai Jin sighed. "Tongyi, it seems Li Xizhi wasn't overly moved. We'll have to wait for Daoist Master Zhaojing's reply."

Si Tongyi nodded silently, his expression complex. The dynamic was a far cry from the days when he and Li Xizhi could casually call each other brothers. "Years ago, when Yuan Tuan visited Moongaze Lake, I had just begun my cultivation at the peak," he reminisced. "I heard the entire Li clan came out to welcome her, and Li Xizhi was a nobody. Back then… even Yuan Tuan had to greet me with a smile."

"Now, with Zhaojing's ascension, I have to be polite to even the most junior members of the Li family… like that Li Jiangqian. It's truly unpredictable…"

Dantai Jin simply shook his head. "Such is the way of the world. Forget Yuan Tuan, how mighty was the Yuan Clan in its day? The great Yanyang Dao Lineage… look what has become of it. Today, Yuan Chengzhao has to live at our beck and call. Do you think he doesn't feel wronged? But what good does it do?"

The two men fell silent and flew away on the wind. "Our Daoist Master had some designs on that part of Shanji Prefecture," Dantai Jin said regretfully. "But Changxi died too suddenly, catching many Daoist Masters off guard. Daoist Master Yehui was the one who reaped the benefits. As it stands now, that land will likely be carved up by the neighboring powers."

***

Moongaze Lake.

The small hall on the island was brightly decorated, with numerous plum trees planted in the courtyard. The season was not yet right, so their bare branches reached up like lonely fingers, while cultivators bustled about.

A cultivator in a crimson robe strode down from the main hall. He had a powerful build, with a bristling beard and a sharp jaw, and his eyes were particularly captivating. Merely standing there, he possessed a presence that was hard to look away from.

Ding Weizeng's injuries had almost fully healed. He was a figure the Daoist Master had personally mentioned, and he had been given a "Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill." This pill had the ability to help transcend tribulations, which was wonderfully synergistic with Ding Weizeng's "Palace-Yang Tiger" immortal foundation, known for its ability to overcome Yin tribulations. The effects of the pill had been maximized.

As a result, while many others still bore injuries from the battle—even Li Chenghui, who had preserved most of his strength, still needed time to recuperate—Ding Weizeng, who had been among the most grievously wounded, had left the mountain early, having recovered seventy to eighty percent of his power.

Now, as he sat in the hall, a servant reported, "My lord, Wang Quwan of Funan has come to call."

Ding Weizeng was not surprised. He took his seat at the head of the hall and said, "Show him in."

A moment later, a man with his hair tied back and a sword on his back entered the hall. He bowed respectfully. "This junior, Wang Quwan of the Wang Clan of Funan, pays his respects to you, my lord."

As newcomers to the Li family, the cultivators from the Jiangbei region naturally stuck together. The Funan faction was larger, mostly composed of men who had been trained under Qu Bushi, and they proudly identified with their Funan origins.

The other group consisted of cultivators from Midong—primarily surrendered generals and members of Midong's noble families who had been conscripted into the Milin army. They were led by Miaoshui. They were few in number and their cultivation was not high. Miaoshui had a good relationship with Qu Bushi, so this group often gathered around the Funan cultivators under the broader Jiangbei banner, though they were still considered a step below.

Wang Quwan's Wang Clan was a Jiangbei clan, but technically from Midong. Fortunately, they had relocated to Funan years ago. Ever the opportunist, Wang Quwan had emerged from Gardenia Scenery Mountain a few months prior and immediately began referring to his family as the Wang Clan *of Funan*. He had paid his respects to Qu Bushi first, and Ding Weizeng was his second visit.

Ding Weizeng was fiercely loyal and paid no mind to factions. Yet, his current standing made him the tacitly acknowledged leader of both Jiangbei groups. It was, therefore, no surprise that Wang Quwan had come to see him.

While Wang Quwan had come to be shrewd, Ding Weizeng had already been wanting to meet him.

The reason was simple: the person to whom Ding Weizeng had pledged his life and loyalty was Li Ximing. Wang Quwan had earned Li Ximing's favor, to the point where it was rumored an Essence Gathering Pill was being set aside for him. This naturally gave Ding Weizeng a very positive impression of the man.

"Quwan, there's no need for such formality," Ding Weizeng said. "Have your resources and living quarters been arranged?"

Wang Quwan quickly explained the arrangements. Ding Weizeng listened, noting that he had been given the clan's highest level of treatment. He nodded silently, his belief that Wang Quwan was highly favored now confirmed.

"Has Senior Qu explained the clan's internal affairs to you? Do you understand everything?" he asked.

The old guard from the Lijing clans was in a clear decline. The once-dominant Huayu faction had fallen silent with An Siwei's capture. Meanwhile, the Milin and Nanzhang factions were growing in power. This left the newly arrived Jiangbei faction in a somewhat awkward position, where a misstep could easily cause offense.

Even if Qu Bushi hadn't explained these things, Wang Quwan would have figured them out after a few days of observation. But having it spelled out was better. "Yes, my lord," he said. "I understand completely."

Ding Weizeng nodded but still offered a word of caution. "Though the old ministers of the Lijing clans are not as prominent now, you must still show them respect. As for the matter between the Fei family and the Funan cultivators, you need not get involved. Just focus on your cultivation."

Wang Quwan knew what he was referring to. The Fei family of the North Bank had a bloody history with Funan from the past decade. Many of the Funan cultivators were from smaller North Bank families that had fled to Floating Cloud Cave. Though they now served the same master, the bad blood remained.

But his Wang family was from Midong and had never been part of that conflict, leaving him cleanly detached. After Ding Weizeng's admonition, Wang Quwan replied, "The Young Master and the Patriarch have instructed me not to leave the island until I reach Foundation Establishment."

Ding Weizeng understood immediately.

'Wang Quwan is important for the morale of the Funan people. They're afraid the northerners will harm him!'

Li Jiangqian was indeed afraid that the Capital immortals Dao would harm Wang Quwan. After all, he was the only one currently available who could be of use regarding the Xiaoshi Mountain affair. If he were killed, there was no telling how long they would have to wait for another opportunity. Though they had arrived at the same conclusion for different reasons, it seemed perfectly logical to both of them.

They spoke for a while, and Ding Weizeng found himself nodding repeatedly. From the island's interior to its shores, Wang Quwan had already managed everything with a thoroughness that surpassed even what Ding Weizeng himself had considered.

Pleased with the conversation, Ding Weizeng rose to his feet and, ignoring the other's protests, personally escorted Wang Quwan out. "With a patriarch like you, the Wang Clan of Funan has truly received a heaven-sent blessing!" he laughed.

"I am merely fortunate to have earned the Daoist Master's favor!"

As they reached the entrance of the hall, they were surprised to see a young man in a dark red, pleated robe waiting on the steps. Ding Weizeng paused for a second before bowing.

"Greetings, Young Master!"

Li Jiangqian smiled and approached, giving Wang Quwan a polite nod. The man tactfully excused himself and departed. Ding Weizeng quickly invited Li Jiangqian inside, but the young man didn't state his purpose. Instead, he smiled.

"Lord Ding, what is your assessment of Wang Quwan?"

Ding Weizeng's expression turned serious. "That man," he said in a low voice, "is no small fish in a pond."

"Oh?" Li Jiangqian prompted.

"Though he is not young, his cultivation is stable and profound, and his spiritual qi is pure," Ding Weizeng continued. "His clothes are simple, his posture steady. The tassel on his sword is worn, and his palms are calloused from forming hand seals. The ambition of a clear conscience shines between his brows, yet he bows his head without losing his dignity. If he proves decisive in his actions, knowing when to advance and when to retreat, he will surely rise above his peers the moment opportunity strikes."

Li Jiangqian pondered this for a moment. "You think very highly of him, my lord."

On the surface, he looked surprised, but inwardly he had already made his judgment.

'Opportunity? The Xiaoshi Mountain Dao lineage is a guaranteed opportunity. Can it be that destiny is truly at play? I should bind him with resources, treasures, and the favor of the clan's women…'

But as the thought formed, Li Jiangqian was suddenly struck by a realization.

'But how do I know that this very idea to lavish him with favor… isn't just the good fortune brought about by his destiny? Is it fate that shapes a man, or a man who forges his fate?'

He considered this for only a fleeting moment, but it was enough to cement Wang Quwan's importance in his mind. A smile returned to his face as he spoke.

"I came today because there is a matter I must trouble you with, my lord."

"Please give your orders, Young Master!" Ding Weizeng said, bowing his head.

Li Jiangqian's expression became serious. "I was previously ordered by the Daoist Master to construct a pavilion, a Jade Court, and a market. The Jade Court is complete, and the pavilion is nearly so, but the market has yet to be sited."

"The Daoist Master returned for a short while at midnight. I made a special trip to Gardenia Scenery Mountain to ask him about it. He has chosen a location: a place within the old territory of Milin Prefecture, situated between the Milin Mountains and the East Bank. It lies at the confluence of five earth meridians, an ideal spot to establish the market."

"However, the site needs a Foundation Establishment cultivator to oversee it. I have consulted the elders, and at present, only you are available, my lord. I would like you to go there to assume command, coordinate the manpower, and see this market built."

Ding Weizeng immediately bowed. "I will obey the revered Daoist Master's command!"

Li Jiangqian drew several jade slips and a token from his sleeve and handed them to him. "The earth meridians in that area are damaged," he explained. "They have repaired themselves somewhat over the years, but several flaws remain that must be fixed. Take my token and have the disciples from the Profound Peak Gate see to the repairs."

Damaged earth meridians were a relatively rare problem, and few spiritual arts or Daoist texts recorded methods of repair. Most simply waited for time to heal the wounds. Fortunately, the members of the Profound Peak Gate, who excelled at such matters, were now with the Li family. Ding Weizeng looked slightly confused, so Li Jiangqian elaborated.

"That location was once the site of the Yu family's market. The Yu clan had a good eye; it's the best spot for a market on that entire stretch of the East Bank. During the wars between the great families, the market was destroyed, and the shattering of a Jade True formation damaged the earth meridians, creating the trouble we face today."

He gave a calm smile and added, "I will arrange the necessary manpower for you, my lord, and the formation masters I've hired will arrive on schedule. But once you are on the East Bank, all the cultivators around those five peaks will be under your command. Don't hesitate to go to my younger brother. Tell him it is the Daoist Master's order and show him my token. He will not refuse you."

Ding Weizeng bowed deeply. "This subordinate obeys!"
