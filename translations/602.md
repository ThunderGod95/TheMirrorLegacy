# Chapter 943: Dingjiao

The Dragon Son extends his invitation... Kongheng immediately looked up. Li Zhouwei was staring thoughtfully at Huiyao, who was still kneeling on the ground. The monk suddenly felt a pang of regret, Huiyao’s really picked up some tricks over the years. He’s grown cunning.

Kongheng wasn’t ignorant of worldly scheming, but as a monk of Buddhist teachings, he could not allow himself to judge others with suspicion. It was only now that realization struck; this whole grand display had been the Serpent Dragon Palace’s invitation banquet. Huiyao had intentionally used a congratulatory excuse to brush him off, fearing the monk might refuse the invitation on the heir’s behalf.

The old demon’s a fast learner. After decades of practice, he’s mastered the act! thought Kongheng.

Now that the meeting had happened in person and Huiyao had bowed to invite the heir, turning down the invitation would be a direct insult to the Dragon Son. And with the dragon’s power in full bloom, there were likely few in the Eastern Sea who would dare to do such a thing.

As the monk pondered, Li Zhouwei descended from the platform. With a crisp clang, the crescent-bladed halberd vanished into a storage pouch. He stepped in front of Huiyao and spoke softly, "Please rise, Fellow Daoist."

Huiyao’s heart gave a sudden jolt as he heard Li Zhouwei pass by and step toward the edge of the main hall.

The heir smiled faintly as he said, "How could I possibly disobey the invitation of the Dragon Son?"

Relieved, Huiyao got up and turned to Kongheng, speaking in a low voice, "Fellow Daoist, I ask you to open the formation."

As Kongheng began casting spells and forming seals, the invisible barrier in the sky faded away. Huiyao removed a large orange-red conch from his waist, pressed it to his lips, puffed up his cheeks, and blew. A thunderous sound echoed at once.

Woooooo...

The shoreline waters surged skyward as two massive walls of seawater rose on the ocean surface, joining together and rolling over the many pavilions of the island until it reached the entrance of the main hall.

Whoooosh!

A salty mist swept in with the tide. Kongheng watched from afar, thinking bitterly that his freshly washed clothes had gone to waste. Jade-red water steps formed beneath Li Zhouwei’s feet. Huiyao made a gesture of invitation, and Li Zhouwei stepped forward. The water beneath him receded and flowed directly onto the sea beast.

Chains rattled furiously as the sea beast strained mightily to pull. Each of its scales vibrated with a hum, and whirlpools erupted across the sea. Slowly, a palace was dragged forth from the depths. Its walls were built from coral, adorned with pearls and jade, and water cascaded from its ledges like waterfalls. It was vibrant, dazzling, and magnificently ornate.

What a splendid palace... thought Li Zhouwei.

This was merely the Dragon Son’s vehicle, yet its palace halls far outnumbered the buildings of Zongquan Island.

Huiyao led him in as night-illuminating pearls lit up on either side. He pointed to the great hall on the right and said respectfully, "The main hall is reserved for the Dragon Son’s personal use. Please proceed to the hall on the right."

Li Zhouwei glanced around. There was another palace to the left that was only slightly less grand than the main hall. It was likely meant to host Purple Mansion Realm guests.

He followed Huiyao into the right hall, who explained, "Please wait a while, my lord. I’ll be steering the Bicolor Scaled Beast. Our journey leads to the Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace beneath the Eastern Sea, just above the netherworld. Though this beast is skilled in traversing water, it will still take three to five days."

Li Zhouwei nodded silently, and Huiyao withdrew in a hurry. Two pure and charming clam maidens entered from a side chamber. Night-illuminating pearls lit up one by one, illuminating the various coral ornaments in the hall, and they brewed tea for him.

Li Zhouwei reached out to accept a cup and saw that it was clear jade-colored spirit tea.

Huiyao really does know our family well. At least he didn’t serve any kind of blood food, thought Li Zhouwei.

He set the cup casually on the table and looked up at the coral throne in the center. The armrests on either side were made of Hooked Serpent heads, their eyes tightly shut, with delicate white scales. These were likely esteemed ones among the Hooked Serpent clan.

They are nothing more than decorations before dragon kin...

Li Zhouwei took a seat nearby and quietly observed. This sea beast, after all, was the Dragon Son’s steed, and it moved with such smoothness that there was no sense of traveling through the seabed. After some contemplation, he raised his estimation of the Dragon Son’s status once again.

After all, dragon kin rarely produce offspring. Once they reach adulthood, they are already at the Purple Mansion Realm, and the most noble of all demonic creatures in the world...

Li Zhouwei knew of two Dragon Monarchs. One was Beijia Dragon Monarch, and the other was Xiyang Dragon Monarch. The former ruled over Converging Waters and was a true scion of the ancient True Hornless Dragon. He was likely among the oldest beings alive.

Of the nine sons of the True Hornless Dragon and the six converging three pristine, only two still roam the world. Xiyang Dragon Monarch is the rising star. So apart from the Lord of Converging Waters, there is yet another Dragon Monarch. This makes three True Monarch-level beings in total.

This Dragon Son... is also titled Crown Prince of the White Dragon Ancestry...

Among everyone the Li Family knew, perhaps only the young Sword Immortal Wang Xun could compare to the Dragon Son. That young master from the Tuoba family was far behind.

Li Zhouwei had taken three years to break through to Foundation Establishment Realm, moving at a steady pace. His Radiant Origin Pass had coalesced within him, and his mana had shone like radiant light. Using the fifth-grade technique Radiant Essence Scripture, his Immortal Foundation was the most magnificent one ever forged in the history of the Li Family.

Though Li Ximing also cultivated the Radiant Essence Scripture, he had already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm when he acquired it, so he could never match Zhouwei’s pure and proper attainment.

"In addition to seizing celestial light, capturing flames, and warding off evil and disaster, the Radiant Origin Pass can manifest physically to subdue enemies. This Immortal Foundation also holds strong affinity with separating fire, and can condense radiant flame into armor and troops as servants."

Even the same Immortal Foundation could produce slight variations depending on who cultivated it. Li Zhouwei wasn’t sure whether the marvels he manifested came from the Radiant Essence Scripture or from his own unique nature.

He muttered, "These two minor marvels... the first has its uses. The second, not so much."

Though he had yet to use them, he estimated that these armored troops would, at best, reach the level of the Qi Cultivation Realm. They would be of little practical use most of the time in battles between Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

"As for spells and techniques..."

Li Zhouwei had spent over twenty years cultivating, with most of that time dedicated to studying spell arts that were mostly of second or third grade. He’d heard that those arts would undergo some transformations after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm. But at present, they merely felt easier to cast.

"The grades are simply too low to be useful in real combat, except for two."
𝓯𝓻𝓮𝙚𝙬𝓮𝙗𝒏𝙤𝒗𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝒐𝓶

When facing enemies, the only techniques he truly relied on were The Grand Veined Golden Eyes and the Armor Cycle Soul-Refining Halberd Art. The former was a perception art, and the latter was a halberd combat art. Both kinds of spell arts had unexpectedly evolved after he reached Foundation Establishment Realm.

The Grand Veined Golden Eyes had become even more wondrous. It had gone beyond its original ability to see through illusions and falsehoods, and now emitted an aura of intimidation. When activated, anyone without a corresponding spell art or Immortal Foundation would instinctively feel overwhelmed and panicked, as though they couldn’t possibly win.

As for the Armor Cycle Soul-Refining Halberd Art, it was a demonic Dao halberd method, forged through enemy slaughter. Now, even the radiant armored troops he summoned could use it to empower him further.

"It seems the cultivation method must be compatible, only then will the breakthrough to Foundation Establishment Realm bring meaningful transformations. Otherwise, it’s just smoother casting at best."

Since this palace was, after all, another’s vessel, it was far from safe for cultivation, especially since it was filled with the aura of Converging Water. Li Zhouwei simply sat at the main seat. The clam maidens nearby, seeing he hadn’t touched the tea, stood silently with the jade teapot, not daring to look at him.

Three days passed in a flash. When the Bicolor Scaled Beast halted, the great palace on its back slowly sank beneath the sea. Enchanted by mana, it settled gently onto the deep blue seabed, leaving the surrounding rocks and silt completely undisturbed.

Li Zhouwei pushed open the palace doors and stepped out into a world of deep azure. Above him, the sea loomed pitch-black. Gemstones and pearls glowed like lanterns, lighting the seawater in an eerie yet vivid blue. The ground was made of dark crimson reefs.

The seabed of the Eastern Sea was not a place ordinary cultivators, or even most Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators could access. Li Zhouwei had never heard it described before. Now, using the faint light and activating his Grand Veined Golden Eyes, he looked far into the distance and saw nothing but endless, sprawling palaces.

Huiyao was standing on the palace steps ahead, smiling obsequiously and following two demonic creatures closely, doing his utmost to please them. One had bulging cheeks and black armor, with a mouth full of fangs. The other had a bulging belly, a massive mouth, and long whiskers. Both wore clothes resembling human garments and approached carrying tridents.

The black-armored, thick-cheeked demon general spoke in a gruff voice, "This is the Tail Subkingdom of the Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace. Honored guest, please follow me."

Huiyao was bowing so low he was nearly kissing the floor. He clearly had no standing to speak. Li Zhouwei nodded calmly and followed behind.

The middle-aged demon with the huge mouth and long whiskers spoke first, his tone gentle and soft, "The Tail Subkingdom is the Clam Kingdom. Though its population thrives, the citizens live beneath the sand. The queen recently became pregnant with a pearl, so she is unable to come out and greet you. We beg your pardon for this."

"It’s no bother," replied Li Zhouwei, glancing around curiously. The space was truly vast. Since the common folk lived beneath the sand, these palaces were likely meant for the shrimp and crab soldiers.

He thought to himself, How vast the Eastern Sea must be. If every corner harbors a demon kingdom, wouldn’t it rival several inland territories? No wonder the dragon clans are content beneath the waves... it’s far more comfortable than living ashore.

They traveled at great speed for several hundred kilometers. In the distance, he gradually made out a dark stone wall within the waters. It seemed to reach all the way to the heavens, and stretched endlessly in both directions.

The middle-aged man with the massive mouth and long whiskers spoke in a low voice, "Honored guest, you’ve cultivated an eye technique. Be sure not to look at the wall."

The golden glow faded from Li Zhouwei’s eyes. When he looked again with mortal vision, he saw only darkness, though faint glimmers of cold light hinted at several long pillars.

A thought stirred in Li Zhouwei’s mind as he asked softly, "Oh? And what’s the story behind it?"

The demon general with bulging cheeks and dark armor finally spoke, his voice low and rough, "The Eighth Young Master is up there."

The youth paused slightly, then immediately understood. He lowered his gaze, fixing it on the dark red reef beneath his feet. The two demon generals buried their heads into their shoulders and fell silent.

Who could be so universally referred to by sea demons as the Eighth Young Master? Only the Dragon Monarch of the Pristine Water Dao, the very origin of the Scarlet Pristine Sea’s hue, the eighth son of the True Hornless Dragon!

The Li Family had records of this sea once being called Qunyi two thousand years ago. It was renamed when the eighth son of the Converging Water True Hornless Dragon was captured here. The dragon clan had chained him to the depths of a seacliff, forging nine cold-iron pillars to pin him down. They had slaughtered and dismembered him, turning the sea green overnight, and thus the Scarlet Pristine Sea was born.

Slaughtered and dismembered... no matter how many corpses remain, this place is the burial site of a True Monarch, a son of the True Hornless Dragon!

He knew that he carried talisman seeds within him and wouldn’t be instantly killed just by looking, but he restrained his curiosity and walked on with a lowered gaze.

The long-whiskered demon beside him whispered, "The Pristine and Converging Daos generate and transform each other. Cultivating here yields great benefits. You likely don’t know but many cultivators once friendly with our dragon clan dwell in caves above."

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod and followed them into the cliff. A vast open space appeared ahead, and high above hung a great plaque, Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace.

He stepped inside to find a palace bathed in clear blue. The eerie mix of red and green was gone. The structure was built primarily of crystal, with fish and shrimp winding their way through rich, concentrated spiritual energy.

The two demons led him up the winding path through the palace until they stopped beside a grand hall overlooking the entire Serpent Dragon Palace.

The massive-mouthed demon said, "Please, this way."

Li Zhouwei stepped forward, opened the jade-like palace doors, and saw several women in pink robes singing with raised sleeves. There was a single figure sitting at the head of the hall.

He wore a silver robe embroidered with waves and dragons. His face was as refined as sculpted jade, with thick brows running into his temples and a tall, noble brow. Two silvery markings trailed from his temples upward to his pair of white horns.

His black hair cascaded down, and his pupils shone pale blue. He fixed his gaze on Li Zhouwei, raised a brow slightly, and said nothing.

Just then, someone to the side stood up and looked at Li Zhouwei. She hopped barefoot down from the platform, her movements leaving the gentle sound of bells in their wake.

She landed before him with a cheerful smile and said, "Greetings, Fellow Daoist!"

It was a young girl who was no more than twelve or thirteen. She had a clean and bright face. Tiny red feathers grew from the corners of her eyes, which were dark red and full of warmth. When she reached him, she gave a perfectly proper bow.

Li Zhouwei returned the gesture, golden light flickering in his eyes once again. He turned to the white-horned youth seated at the head of the hall and said in a steady voice, "Minghuang of Moongaze Lake greets the Dragon Son."

"Mm." The youth glanced at him. Seeing that he did not kneel, he rotated the cup in his hand and said softly, "Dingjiao, white serpent dragon of Clear Sea and Still Pond lineage."

His bearing was refined and unpretentious. Without any air of arrogance, he gestured to a seat beside him for Li Zhouwei. A maidservant brought over wine. The white serpent dragon glanced at the girl beside him and said softly, "Minghuang, this is Fellow Daoist Wupian from Verdant Parasol Forest[1] in Northern Yan."

The red-feathered girl kept smiling and nodded, "Chongli lineage, Wuping fire-yang luan[2]. Wupian greets Fellow Daoist."

Li Zhouwei understood at once. He thought to himself, A white serpent dragon and a fire-yang luan, neither of them are ordinary demonic creatures...

This luan looked quiet and refined, but she was quite talkative. She immediately spoke again with a smile, "Fellow Daoist Minghuang, are you the eldest son... or the second?"

Li Zhouwei found the question rather out of the blue. He gave her a friendly smile, but before he could answer, the white serpent dragon Dingjiao spoke first, raising his cup toward him, "Golden eyes of that shade, likely the eldest?"
𝑓𝓇𝘦ℯ𝘸𝘦𝑏𝓃𝑜𝘷ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂

Li Zhouwei seemed thoughtful, but showed no sign of discomfort. He raised his cup in return and replied, "Your guess is correct."

"Good... very good..." The luan girl Wupian let out a relieved sigh and said with a smile, "Then things will go smoothly... The white qilin may be fierce, but he can be a friend. That white cicada, on the other hand, is no good!"

"Wupian..." Dingjiao interrupted her and turned to Li Zhouwei with a hearty laugh. "Minghuang, you may not know this, but Emperor Gong of Wei in his youth was a golden-eyed white qilin with scales beneath his neck. My grandfather and him were close friends. My father even met him once and would call him ‘uncle.’"

"So there was such a connection..." Li Zhouwei was slightly surprised. But thinking further, it wasn’t odd as the Wei's Li regime had once unified the North with unmatched prestige. Having ties to the dragon clans was only natural.

Still, judging by the current state of affairs, he had never heard of any deep alliance between the dragons and the Wei's Li Family. His own family certainly hadn’t received any real aid. It was likely nothing more than superficial friendship.

"May I ask... which Dragon King is your honored elder?" asked Li Zhouwei.

Dingjiao’s pale blue eyes shifted slightly. He gave a faint smile and emphasized each word, "Dongfang You!"

1. 青梧 (Qingwu) – “Verdant Parasol” Refers to the 梧桐 (Chinese parasol tree) with 青 (deep green or blue-green) foliage. In classical lore, it symbolizes purity, elegance, and is said to attract phoenixes. Often used poetically to evoke noble solitude or a sacred setting. ☜

2. 鸾 (Luán) is a legendary bird in Chinese mythology, similar to the phoenix but distinct in status and symbolism. Often paired with the phoenix (凤), the luán represents harmony, virtue, and auspicious omens. It is said to sing beautifully and only appear in peaceful, righteous times. In poetry, it may also symbolize noble women or sacred union. ☜
