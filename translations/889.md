# Chapter 889: Breaking the Flame

'Splitting Light.'

'It vanquishes evil, punishes the disloyal, is not lightly entrusted, and kills when moved.'

Li Ximing stood firm amidst the roiling sandstorm, long halberd in hand. The aura that had peaked around him began to recede. At his side, the Reveal River pulsed with azure and yellow light, and in an instant, the raging sands were stilled.

The four-armed, golden-skinned Merciful One remained in its original spot, but its body trembled violently. It was covered in a web of fine cracks. Sand and gravel streamed from the fissures, cascading down its form. Alongside the debris, brilliant, sacred light escaped in threads and wisps from the fractures in its body.

Its imposing, gilded head had already disintegrated into a golden storm of light that rushed to the sky. Its neck had been pulverized along with it. A deep gash marked the center of its collarbones, and a spiderweb of impact fractures spread across its entire chest, reflecting a shimmering white light.

Before it, Li Ximing was but a tiny speck of light, yet he did not pause. His eyes turned a pale gold. Pressing two fingers to his lips, he suddenly exhaled a gout of flame.

The flame was a faint purple, resonating with his Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire and imbuing that True Fire with a pale violet halo.

Flame-Spitting!

The moment the Radiant Sun King's Halberd was brandished, a mouthful of Li Fire materialized, surging forth with the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire in a torrential downpour.

Above, the Celestial Gate flickered. Vicious flames crept up along the cracks. The massive, headless dharma body stood sluggishly beneath the Radiant Pass, casting a vast shadow upon the land. Suppressed by the Celestial Gate and scorched by the True Fire, its radiant light fled ever more frantically. The dharma body itself showed rapid signs of melting.

The Nuyan Merciful One had dared to receive *Audience with the Celestial Gate* with its physical form, so its dharma body was naturally extraordinary. But now, pinned beneath the Divine Ability and scorched by True Fire, it couldn't move a single step. Severed from the light of the Buddhist Land and caught off guard, its dharma body had absorbed ninety percent of the halberd's strike. Even though the blow hadn't banished it back to the Buddhist Land, it was nearly incapacitated.

Only now did the Nuyan Merciful One begin to recover. Its headless body groaned under the pressure of the Celestial Gate. A dim, round pearl offered what little support it could. Two eyes opened upon its chest, releasing a protective light just as the Nuxiao Merciful One sped onto the scene.

Radiance overflowed from *Audience with the Celestial Gate* as the Divine Ability pulsed. Li Ximing's expression remained calm, but he had already detected a subtle fluctuation in the Great Void. The glow of the Buddhist Land was intensifying. He frowned inwardly.

'Another Merciful One has arrived... It's probably not from the Way of Great Desire. It's just observing from the Great Void.'

Under the Immortal Mirror's illumination, a new Merciful One was visible, standing in the Great Void. Its radiant light shot to the heavens as it stood upon a golden cloud. It had three eyes on its face; the one in the center of its brow held a deep, purplish-black color, its light contained but shockingly potent. Two more bright white eyes had opened on its chest. This was no ordinary being.

'This must be one from beneath a Golden Lotus Seat! Its cultivation looks profound!'

Although this Five-Eyed Merciful One sat serenely in the Great Void, its two main eyes slightly lowered, remaining perfectly still with no intention of intervening, Li Ximing grew vigilant.

'I can't drag this out any longer!'

As Nuxiao rushed over, he merely turned his head to the side. This Merciful One's many arms formed hand seals in unison, then thrust forward and upward, releasing countless golden lights shaped like lotus leaves. The Merciful One then split into three, each holding a saber, spear, or sword, and hacked toward his dharma body.

The golden light looked ordinary, seemingly lacking in power. But when the Heavenly Light between Li Ximing's brows shone upon it, he sensed a hidden sharpness and knew it was not as simple as it appeared.

'Looks like she's pulling out all the stops!'

The Reveal River before Li Ximing brightened, assuming its upright form. Azure and yellow patterns rippled outward like water as the two seals at its head and tail lit up simultaneously.

Monarch's Balance!

Before the three figures could even get close to the azure-yellow landscape patterns, the myriad lotus-leaf lights rained down. A clear beam shone from the profound Monarch's Balance, instantly revealing a single, tangible, radiant petal hidden among the dense barrage of golden light.

The Radiant Sun King's Halberd's Splitting Light was too slow to deploy; he naturally wouldn't dare try to block the attack with it. Instead, Li Ximing gently turned the Radiant Sun King's Halberd to a vertical position.

Radiance!

A pale, iridescent light immediately enveloped his body. But Li Ximing's preparations didn't end there. First, the bright fire of the Sun's Resonant Parting Art appeared. From within it, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger manifested, and the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen cascaded down.

The rain of golden petals hammered against the brownish-yellow Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen, making the barrier tremble. As the single, hidden, radiant petal struck, the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen shattered into pieces.

The patterns on the Reveal River wavered. Li Ximing himself didn't hesitate for a second. In a single step, he closed the distance and appeared directly in front of the Nuyan Merciful One!

The Nuyan Merciful One's dharma body was already on the verge of collapse. It was only surviving under the Celestial Gate by relying on its painstakingly refined treasure pearl. Even so, the scorching True Fire was still climbing its body. How could it possibly have a chance to move?

It could only glare at Li Ximing with blazing eyes, its gilded pupils filled with venomous hatred.

In that brief respite, it knew Nuxiao was useless and that the Five-Eyed one in the Great Void was just watching the fire from the other shore. Its only option was to raise the kasaya robe in its hand high. It abandoned its shattered dharma body, which dissolved from top to bottom into a surging column of sacred light, flying upstream to assault *Audience with the Celestial Gate*!

If the Nuyan Merciful One had abandoned its dharma body at full strength to attack *Audience with the Celestial Gate* while he was pincered, Li Ximing would have certainly been injured. But it had already taken a direct hit from Splitting Light and lost seventy or eighty percent of its power. Its remaining radiance merely forced *Audience with the Celestial Gate* to rise, transforming into light and flying back to Li Ximing's hand, forcing him to retreat a step, his face paling slightly.

The Nuxiao Merciful One's attack arrived immediately after, striking Li Ximing's shoulder. The Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption failed instantly under the attack. Only the Radiance Divine Ability glowed faintly. With a sickening crunch, Heavenly Light flared, and the faint glint of iridescent bone was exposed.

Although the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen wasn't powerful, its strength lay in being repeatedly summoned at will with minimal cost and high speed. With the screen having blocked the worst of it and the Radiance's protection, the injury was not severe.

But his gaze was locked onto the kasaya robe flying through the sky. At the same time, his Immortal Mirror scanned the area, revealing three streaks of golden light already speeding in from the eastern Great Void!

'They're starting to catch up!'

The old man, Bai Yinzi, was wrapped tightly in the kasaya, unable to move, reduced to a mere human shape. The robe, empowered by the Nuyan Merciful One's dying dharma power, glowed with golden light as it tried to escape!

Li Ximing immediately gave chase, daring not show his excitement. The Sun's Resonant Parting Art in his hand transformed into a chain of Li Fire and shot out in pursuit.

The Nuyan Merciful One must have known where the Five-Eyed Merciful One was. It also knew Nuxiao couldn't protect the prize. Even in death, it wouldn't allow the item to be lost. The three newcomers were still too far away, so its only choice was to send it toward the Five-Eyed Merciful One.

'But there's still one other person!'

As expected, the kasaya never had a chance to get far. A massive hand suddenly reached out from the Great Void. Divine Ability flowed around it as it clamped down on the robe, seizing it.

The newcomer wore a Daoist robe of dark patterns on an azure background. He had a youthful face and a slight smile. A vermilion dot adorned his brow, and a bottle decorated with dark clouds and silver sparrows hung from his waist. He caught the kasaya with one hand and chuckled.

"Good little monk!"

Seeing him appear, Li Ximing actually relaxed. After a brief moment weighing the pros and cons, he waved his hand to dismiss his Dharma Art, but kept his halberd ready, his expression focused.

"How dare you!"

Just then, four shafts of light appeared nearby. The imposing Five-Eyed Merciful One sat in their midst, its expression grave. Behind it stood three other Merciful Ones, all looking furious. They roared in unison, their voices like thunder in the sky.

Li Ximing acted as if he hadn't heard a thing. The newly arrived Daoist Master merely sneered, an odd look on his face. Both he and Li Ximing turned to look at the Nuxiao Merciful One, now caught between them.

'Oh no!'

The joy on Nuxiao's face had only half-formed before it turned to sheer terror. Scared out of her wits, she couldn't care about anything else. Her radiant light evaporated like steam as she fled into the Great Void in a single breath, clearly terrified.

Li Ximing took a small step forward. With a silent understanding, both men stepped into the Great Void and vanished.

"Five-Eyed! You... you... Just sitting on the mountain watching the tigers fight! The item is lost now. Let's see how you explain this!"

Nuxiao reappeared, her eyes full of rage. She hurled the accusation, only to see the Five-Eyed Merciful One's expression remain perfectly calm. It replied coolly:

"Ignorant! While you were brawling here, Xuanyi in the Great Void had his eyes locked on me. If I had moved, wouldn't I have alerted the snake in the grass? Your reinforcements were so slow. You should be asking what's wrong with your Way of Great Desire, not questioning me!"

"I already tied down one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. It's your Way of Great Desire that failed!"

...

The Great Void.

Although Li Ximing had entered the Great Void, his senses remained locked on the other man. With a group of Merciful Ones present, the two of them naturally retreated together. If the other man had snatched Bai Yinzi and fled, the happiest parties would undoubtedly be the Buddhist cultivators.

The Daoist Master was all smiles. Without giving the Merciful Ones so much as a glance, he drew closer, and they proceeded south together. He praised,

"Fellow Daoist Zhaojing, what skill! This one is Xuanyi. I've long heard of your name!"

"I've also long heard of your great reputation!"

This man was none other than Daoist Master Xuanyi of Mount Jingyi!

His reputation was considerable; Li Ximing had heard his name countless times. Back when the Chunyi Dao Gate had besieged them, this Daoist Master Xuanyi had also suffered. As a result, they had never met. Now, they finally stood face to face.

Li Ximing discreetly glanced at the black-cloud-and-silver-sparrow bottle at Xuanyi's waist. Nuxiao had clearly recognized Xuanyi, and their relationship was obviously terrible. That made him a potential ally—all the more so since Bai Yinzi was in his hands.

He smiled and said,

"This place is dangerous. After you!"

There was no enmity between them; in fact, they had several connections, and Li Ximing's side even owed him a small favor. Since they had seized the prize, they would certainly have to divide it. Li Ximing wasn't worried about what came next.

Daoist Master Xuanyi was surprisingly young. Whatever he was like on the inside, his outward appearance was at least dashing and unrestrained. He chuckled.

"I didn't do it on purpose. I never expected you to be here, Fellow Daoist, or that we'd run into each other like this... I'm afraid I've caused some offense!"

'In this situation... snatching food from the tiger's mouth, right in front of the Buddhist cultivators... I really have this Daoist Master Xuanyi to thank.'

Li Ximing had genuinely been prepared to suffer heavy injuries to capture Bai Yinzi. Although Xuanyi had been the one to snatch Bai Yinzi in the end, Li Ximing had known he was watching from the sidelines all along. He wasn't surprised. He had even factored Xuanyi into his calculations.

He had already snared Bai Yinzi with the Sun's Resonant Parting Art, but if Xuanyi hadn't appeared, he would have had to fight his way out and would have lost half his life in the process!

Moreover, if they hadn't snatched the prize and it had ended up in the Five-Eyed Merciful One's hands, a truly hard battle would have ensued. The two sides would never have sat down to divide the spoils... That Five-Eyed Merciful One was likely worth two of Nuyan. Having Xuanyi force the Five-Eyed Merciful One to give up the chase was a much better outcome.

This was also why Li Ximing had let Xuanyi take it. The Buddhist cultivators already hated him enough. If they had truly fought over it and the prize ended up in his hands, the situation would have become very difficult.

'After all, we are facing the Buddhist Land.'

The two traversed the Great Void. Tremors came from all directions. Clearly, conflicts were raging all across Jiangbei, and the various battles were reaching their conclusions. Li Ximing asked,

"There are still other spoils to be had. Aren't you going to take a look, Daoist Master Xuanyi?"

Daoist Master Xuanyi waved his hand, his tone placid.

"Showing my face once is enough. Chunyi is also in Jiangbei. No matter where I go, there's a risk of them catching me. I might not win a fight against them, and as long as I get tied down, things will become troublesome."

Daoist Master Xuanyi was an overseas cultivator and had been matching wits with the Chunyi Dao Gate for many years. He clearly had his own code of survival. Li Ximing nodded to himself. He had even less inclination to fight for other treasures. He led Xuanyi to Gardenia Scenery Mountain, where they materialized beneath the jade pillar.

Xuanyi's azure robe with its dark patterns was surprisingly well-matched with the gardenias covering the ground. He cast an appreciative glance at Gardenia Scenery Mountain and said,

"What a fine view!"

He placed the kasaya on the ground and nodded amicably at Li Ximing, smiling.

"Regarding Shouding's matter, I must trouble your clan. He is ignorant of the ways of the world, reckless and negligent. I was unable to split my attention. It's all thanks to your clan's mediation. Please accept my thanks."

"It was nothing!"

Li Ximing laughed heartily and waved his hand, taking the initiative in the conversation. He calmly poured tea, careful not to appear too eager, and replied,

"Let's check on Bai Yinzi first. We mustn't let the Buddhist cultivators pull a fast one."

"Well said."

Xuanyi nodded and crooked a finger. The kasaya wasn't a powerful artifact to begin with, and his Divine Ability had been wearing it down the entire trip. It trembled and fell apart, and the old man, Bai Yinzi, tumbled out in a daze, crying,

"Aiyo!"

Li Ximing suppressed his excitement and watched calmly. The old man scrambled to his feet, recognized Li Ximing at a glance, and his eyes immediately reddened. He kowtowed repeatedly.

"Thank you for saving my life, Daoist Master! Thank you for saving my life!"

Xuanyi's Divine Ability was still swirling around him. Li Ximing smiled and said,

"Actually, it was this Daoist Master Xuanyi who saved you."

Xuanyi held his cup, looking at Bai Yinzi with a broad smile. He said,

"Your storage bag."

Bai Yinzi quickly presented his belongings. Xuanyi took the bag, and with a sweep of his Divine Ability, it was forcibly refined. It exploded with a *bang*, and all its contents clattered onto the ground.

This act, performed in front of Li Ximing, was Xuanyi's way of proving he wasn't hiding anything. Li Ximing's gaze was casual, but his peripheral vision instantly scanned the pile of miscellaneous items. Among the bottles, jars, talismans, and spiritual items, he spotted a small, bright white spirit stone!

It was tossed among the other spiritual items like trash, only half-visible, discarded like an old shoe. Meanwhile, two brownish-yellow Qi Refining spiritual items were carefully packed in translucent jade boxes, sitting right on top of it.

The Talisman Seed in Li Ximing's sea of qi throbbed incessantly, releasing waves of cool energy. His blood surged with excitement, but his face remained impassive. He merely relaxed his brow.

He wasn't the only one; Daoist Master Xuanyi across from him also relaxed his brow. But Xuanyi was pleased by the dharma artifacts from Bai Yinzi's bag. He laughed and asked,

"Fellow Daoist Zhaojing, will you pick first, or shall I?"

He completely disregarded the feelings of Bai Yinzi, who was kneeling to the side, asking the question so brazenly. The old man, for his part, just kept kneeling, his gaze somewhat vacant.

Li Ximing's gaze swept lightly over the items. The various jade bottles and boxes disintegrated, revealing spiritual items of varying value. More importantly, four dharma artifacts lay in the main pile, all glowing brightly and looking quite fine. There was also a small box among them that had not been destroyed by the Divine Ability's touch. It was pure white with golden patterns, clearly an extraordinary item.

He smiled faintly and replied,

"My family doesn't need much, and he likely doesn't have it anyway. Let's take a look first..."

Xuanyi nodded with a smile. He flicked a finger, and the pure white box with fine golden patterns popped open, revealing its contents.

Inside were five small, shimmering silver leaves. Each was no bigger than a fingernail and had a "fuzzy" appearance. Every tiny, dense hair on the leaves' surfaces emitted a faint, ethereal glow. A rich pulse of spiritual energy washed over them, refreshing the mind and spirit.

Li Ximing only gave it a single glance, but under his spiritual sense's probe, it felt familiar. After a moment's thought, he faintly sensed a profundity related to the way of the Capital Guard.

"So, it's a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource."

Xuanyi casually lifted the jade box and brought it into his hand to examine. Although he didn't ask for it, his interest was obvious.

Li Ximing saw his opportunity. Putting on a look of sudden understanding, he activated his Divine Ability. The rest of the valuable items rose up one by one and landed on the table. The remaining miscellaneous junk tumbled to the floor. With a casual wave of his sleeve, he swept all that "junk" into his robe.

'Got it!'

He celebrated inwardly, nodding silently. Because he had already spread all the spiritual items out for inspection with their spiritual senses, Xuanyi naturally had no objections. He simply inclined his head and smiled.

"Fellow Daoist, do you recognize this item?"
