# Chapter 462: Muyun of Mount Yu

Li Yuanjiao followed Yuan Huyuan to Mushroom Forest Plain. Yuan Huyuan led him to the mountain's summit, then excused himself to return to his clan to discuss the trade.

Li Yuanjiao waited on the summit for a while. During this time, he conversed with a direct descendant of the Yuan Family, a Qi Cultivator. The decent-looking young man was a good conversationalist, but Li Yuanjiao's responses were distracted and vague as his mind was preoccupied with skepticism.

Hooked Serpent...unique life matching technique from north...

He tapped lightly on the table with his fingers, feeling uneasy. Noticing Li Yuanjiao's preoccupation, the Yuan Family member fell silent, not daring to interrupt his thoughts. Li Yuanjiao took the time to piece together his thoughts with a rather unpleasant look on his face.

With the Purple Mansion Realm's divine ability and tangled fates, everything seems suspicious... I need to thoroughly understand the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique before returning to investigate the Hooked Serpent again.

When Yuan Huyuan returned, Li Yuanjiao greeted him with a forced smile and asked eagerly, "Senior, how did it go?"

Yuan Huyuan swung his sleeve and replied with a grin, "All good."

Yuan Huyuan, being from the same lineage as Yuan Tuan, held significant sway within the Yuan Family. Despite being a Qi Cultivator, he had long overseen the family's affairs.

He presented two jade slips, explaining, "This is the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique. Read through it carefully, fellow Daoist! The other slip contains the required cold qi gathering method. Let me know if you already have this at home."

Li Yuanjiao examined the jade slips. The core content was sealed with a secret art, leaving only the information in front and at the end of it accessible. After reading it for a moment, he began, "Senior, I have a few questions."

Yuan Huyuan, who was lost in thought, was startled by Li Yuanjiao's intense gaze and responded quickly, "What is it?"

"The Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique only mentions the loss of the spirit items if the spell fails, but not the fate of the demon creature. Since your esteemed family has performed this ritual many times, do you mind sharing it with me?"

Yuan Huyuan was taken aback by the question and then offered a rueful smile as he replied, "At best, it might be injured and suffer a shortened lifespan; at worst, it could result in death..."

Li Yuanjiao's smile faded slightly as he remarked, "This technique is indeed quite... costly to use."

Li Yuanjiao appeared slightly displeased on the surface, but inwardly, he was both relieved and satisfied.

The technique appealed to him greatly, not merely because of the Hooked Serpent it could tame. While the prospects of having a Foundation Establishment Realm ally were indeed enticing and the cold qi gathering method was useful for his family, these were only secondary concerns.

In Li Yuanjiao's view, the primary benefit of this technique was its ability to conceal his family's frequent captures of live demon creatures. The Li Family had long sought after a similar technique for this very reason.

After all, we often capture monsters alive for sacrifices. They disappear after being brought to the mountain, which might be alright once or twice, but if it becomes a pattern, it will be difficult to avoid suspicion if someone decides to investigate.

With this spell, we can openly capture monsters and bring them back to the mountain. After the sacrifice, I can simply claim that the ritual failed...

Moreover, Li Yuanjiao understood that the Yuan Family had failed several times in the past because they could not find a suitable Purple Mansion Realm spirit item, and resorted to using Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items.

Putting aside the seemingly endless supply of Supreme Yin Moonlight of unknown grade, the secret chamber at home was also filled with golden-white osmanthus and moonlit orchid grass when the immortal mirror reacted to Yu Muxian's presence in Moongaze Lake.

Though the Li Family could not identify the grade of these spirit items, they still collected and stored them away. Despite their lack of knowledge about proper preservation methods which caused the item to gradually deteriorate, there were still many pieces left in the Purple Mansion Realm jade box.

With confidence in his heart, Li Yuanjiao immediately asked, "What is the origin of this technique, Senior? If it is some secret technique of unknown origin or an offensive nature, I wouldn't dare to use it."

Li Yuanjiao had a guess in mind, but Yuan Huyuan, noticing his expression, felt guilty for withholding certain information and looked rather awkward. Upon hearing Li Yuanjiao's question, Yuan Huyuan quickly answered, "This Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique was acquired by my ancestor from the northern Yanyang Temple. After obtaining this legacy, he rose to prominence and eventually established the Yuan Family. That was approximately..."

Yuan Huyuan counted on his fingers and finished his sentence, "I would say 1,600 years ago."

1,600 years?!

Li Yuanjiao repeated this number incredulously in his heart.

Yuan Huyuan then elaborated, "My ancestor was fortunate enough to establish a Dao lineage, but it was a dark age. The ancient Wei State had fallen, the Jie people migrated south, and Metallic Essence demons were rampant. Although he was a Daoist Master, he was only able to protect himself..."

"Later, my family was displaced and migrated south. Unfortunately, the Daoist Master was captured and consumed by Metallic Essence demons. The surviving members fled in all directions, and much of the Dao lineage was lost. My branch eventually settled in Xu State six hundred years ago, with only two Qi Cultivators remaining."

Yuan Huyuan spoke with a touch of pride and continued, "My ancestors continued south, clashing with the Chi Family's ancestors many times. They eventually settled in the Mushroom Forest Plain. As descendants of the Purple Mansion Realm, they had Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators among them. After more than a hundred years, the Azure Chi Sect was founded, and my family became a member... At that time, four of the twelve peaks were occupied, and the sect flourished for a period."

Li Yuanjiao continued to listen intently as Yuan Huyuan suddenly smiled awkwardly and spoke in a low voice, "It's a pity my family failed several times in breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, and we've gradually declined..."

Li Yuanjiao could easily sense his desolation. The Jiangnan of today was not the same as it was hundreds of years ago. Back then, cultivators were rare, spirit items were abundant, and the Immortal Mansion had just retreated from the world.

At that time, the Yuan Family's strength was not much different from what it is now. They were still prominent back then, so it was understandable that they now felt the frustration of being in decline.

Yuan Huyuan sighed deeply and said, "Back then, Purple Smoke was just a small temple, and the Kong Family was scrambling for a minor county magistrate position. Wanyu Sword Gate was under the rule of Dongli Sect. Chen Family of Lingyu Gate rented a cave dwelling on my family's territory and had to lower their pride over thirty Spirit Stones. The combined territories of those four sect and gates couldn't even match the size of my family's market... And now... now..."

In an era where snake dragons turned into pure dragons, the Yuan Family squandered their opportunities bit by bit. This has always been a source of pain for many of the Yuan Family's elders. Yuan Huyuan could only sigh repeatedly, unable to finish his sentence.

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly. The Yuan Family's luck had indeed been average, which eased his suspicions somewhat.

At least the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique itself isn't a trap. This technique has a longer history than Azure Pond...

He moved on to the next technique provided by the Yuan Family, which could be used for gathering the Forest Dark Cold Qi. Stowing away both jade slips, he took out the pill and said softly, "Please send a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to assist me with capturing the demon creature, Senior. Once the task is completed, I'll hand over this pill, and you'll help me unlock the secret techniques on the jade slip."

Yuan Huyuan quickly nodded and replied, "Sure. Please wait a moment, I've already invited a cultivator from the clan to join us."

After a brief wait, a strong bearded man with thick eyebrows landed in the yard. He gave Li Yuanjiao a quick look, then cupped his fist and greeted respectfully, "I am Yuan Chengdun. Greetings to Clan Head and fellow Daoist!"

Yuan Huyuan introduced him, "This is my clan nephew, Yuan Chengdun. His immortal foundation is Sprawling Azure Mountain and he's skilled in subduing demons. With him, capturing the little pig demon will be an easy task."

Yuan Chengdun was quite renowned during the devil plagues. Li Yuanjiao had heard of him before and was thus very pleased. He stepped forward and cupped his fist respectfully, returning the gesture.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist!"

Yuan Chengdun, carrying two short sticks on his back, was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. He seemed like a reserved man, offering only a slight nod in response.

Li Yuanjiao asked a few casual questions before leading him to the lake.

Li Family...

Li Yuanping sat in the central hall with a young man standing beside him. He was tall with broad shoulders and thick eyebrows.

It was Li Xicheng.

Those in the generation of Xi and Yue were all quite talented, except for Li Yuexiang, whose talent was yet to be determined. Li Yuanjiao had fathered this daughter in old age, and she was not even six years old yet.

Li Xicheng was over thirty now and had reached the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

"...The issue at the mine has been resolved...It was a rat demon...We've sent Uncle Qiuyang over..." he informed respectfully.

Li Yuanping listened to his report carefully and said patiently, "Cheng'er, the Ebony Mine has the most output, so we must handle matters with our own hands. You've done the right thing to send Uncle Qiuyang... All the disturbances in the mine must be carefully investigated. Maybe someone is using the demon to fill the holes left from stealing from the mine..."

Li Xicheng lowered his head, then nodded thoughtfully.

"Junior understands."

"Good," Li Yuanping nodded in approval and continued, "Go to Mount Yue. I've found Li Jiman for you. Have a heart-to-heart talk with him. Mount Yue produces a lot..."

Li Xicheng nodded in response and Li Yuanping continued, saying, "Now that I think about it, most of those from the generation of Cheng and Ming should already be of age. There's quite a number of them, are there any outstanding ones?"

Li Xicheng replied, "The children of the major and minor sects are all talented. Two concubine-born sons are brought back to the major sect because their children have spiritual orifices. Now there are eleven people in total, all practicing in the mountains. As for the outstanding ones..."

Li Xicheng paused and continued softly, "Each of them has the talent to become Qi Cultivator, but whether they are exceptional in terms of innate talent and character... that remains to be seen."

Li Yuanping did not seem to be in a rush and merely responded gently, "With the implementation of the new system, the four lineages are much closer. These children have been eating and living together since they went up the mountain. As long as they are loyal to the family and become Qi Cultivators as well as the backbone of the family in the future, they need not be overachievers. "

Li Yuanping glanced at Li Xicheng beside him, who still seemed a little worried, prompting him to explain in further detail, "All the direct descendants of the family and those in the major and minor sects are going up the mountain to cultivate so that they can get to know each other and be sent out to govern the peaks in the future. As for Mount Qingdu, with you brothers in charge, there won't be too many problems."

The uncle and nephew were both deep in discussion when a servant approached and announced respectfully, "Family Head, Xiao Muyun from Mount Yu is here to visit!"

"Xiao Muyun?" Li Yuanping was momentarily surprised but then smiled warmly and instructed, "Hurry up and bring him in!"

A teenager, no more than twelve or thirteen, soon entered. He was dressed in black, exhibiting the calm composure of someone far beyond his age. He kneeled, bowed and respectfully greeted Li Yuanping.

"Muyun greets Uncle!"

This boy was none other than Xiao Muyun, the son of Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian, now the young master of Mount Yu. Li Yuanping quickly approached to help him up, taking a closer look at the boy. He noted Muyun's calm demeanor and bright, intelligent eyes and could not help but praise him, "Good... very good! You have an excellent bearing and appearance."

Xiao Muyun simply cupped his fist humbly. Reaching the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm at the age of twelve or thirteen was already an impressive achievement. Li Xicheng stepped forward with a smile and said, "Ah, so you are my younger cousin!"

The Li Family had rescued Li Qingxiao and Xiao Muyun, so their bond was naturally strong. Li Yuanping asked warmly, "How are things at Mount Yu? Your second uncle has already established his foundation... If you need anything, our family will support you!"

Xiao Muyun was visibly moved and replied, "Uncle, my father and grandfather passed away together back then, but it was our family that saved us. We traveled to many places, and with the Spirit Stones and talismans we received, I was able to retain my position as the head of Mount Yu. Now, my mother and I oversee Mount Yu... Only a few old stubborn men still remain. I came this time to return the seventy Spirit Stones we borrowed."

He took out a storage pouch from his chest pocket and handed it over to Li Xicheng.

"If the family ever needs anything, the Mount Yu lineage will definitely come to your aid!" he promised sincerely.

Li Yuanping sighed and shook his head.

"Mount Yu is still in the hands of the Xiao Family. Excessive contact between us might give others a reason to criticize. Your focus should be on cultivation‚Äîbreaking through to the Foundation Establishment as soon as possible would be the greatest help you could offer," he said.

"Yes!" Xiao Muyun replied earnestly.

Li Yuanping then turned to Li Xicheng and suggested, "Take your cousin for a walk and introduce him to his other cousins."

Li Xicheng cupped his fist in response, and the two departed. Afterward, Li Yuanping opened a storage pouch to find eighty Spirit Stones. Along with the ten extra stones, he also saw a small letter written by Li Qingxiao. Every word on it was sincere and heartfelt.

With these eighty stones, the gap left by the construction of the family's formation is finally filled.

Li Yuanping felt a sense of relief as the burden that had weighed on him for so long was finally lifted. He put away the storage pouch, savoring a rare moment of contentment.

Just as he finished making some arrangements, a clan soldier entered the hall swiftly and spoke in a low voice, "Family Head, the elder is asking if the clan has any spirit items that could calm qi."

The elder in question was none other than Li Xuanxuan. The Li Family had suffered heavy losses, and he was the only one left who could be referred to as an elder.

Li Yuanping hesitated before replying softly, "If it's truly necessary, I can send someone to Qingdu Peak to inquire."

Li Xuanxuan, though only seventy years old, had used life-shortening techniques multiple times and had suffered three or four severe injuries. He had aged significantly but spent year after year stubbornly toiling away at drawing talismans instead of taking it easy.

Li Xuanxuan had no hope of further advancement. His current cultivation was the result of numerous fortuitous encounters. Now, as he delved deeper into talisman crafting, his suspicions grew more and more intense.

Whenever he meditated, countless illusions plagued him. He faced mental obstacles and relied on Tranquility Pills to find some semblance of calmness.

The old man could no longer even draw talismans with precision. He had been taking Tranquility Pills at home, but whenever he did, he felt guilty for wasting the family's Spirit Stones and would furiously throw himself back into talisman crafting.

Li Yuanping closed his eyes and sighed. Li Xuanxuan was now the eldest in the family, and no one could persuade him to take a break.

Li Yuanping sighed internally.

The pills are not a major concern... I only fear that...

The Li Family had consulted with experts who deduced that Li Xuanxuan should have another eighty to ninety years left to live. Despite only being halfway through his expected lifespan, his current madness made it seem like it could shorten his lifespan by another dozen years.

While Li Yuanping was lost in thought, he felt a chill settle over him and began to cough. He took a sip of medicinal tea made from spirit flowers and suddenly realized...

I don't have many years left either.

Feeling dizzy, he sank back into his seat, silently tapping the table with his fingers.

Eleven people... all with the potential for reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm... Sister Hong is about to establish her foundation too. Ming'er should also be able to achieve his foundation in thirty years, and then we'll have fifteen or sixteen direct descendants in the Qi Cultivation Realm...

For some reason, Li Yuanping thought of the Yu Family from the past, and his heart sank slightly.

Prosperity is fragile... I wonder if Xicheng will manage the family well...
