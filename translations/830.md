# Chapter 830: The Hundred-Day Pill

Li Ximing held her gaze for several seconds, a thought suddenly flashing through his mind.

'What does she mean by this? Could it be that Purple Smoke has a lead on World's Radiance, but she's hesitant to offer it?'

When the Dongli Sect's Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven collapsed, countless Bright Yang Dao traditions were scattered to the winds, claimed by the various families of the Azure Pine region. The Li family had yet to rise at the time and had only managed to acquire a copy of the Intercalary Sun Art through Tu Longjian, a technique that had benefited them to this day.

Both Yufu Prefecture and Mount Dongli lay on the border between the territories of the Purple Smoke and Azure Pond families. It stood to reason that those two had acquired far more from the fallout. The possibility that Purple Smoke had obtained a trace of the Life Divine Ability known as World's Radiance was extremely high, and the thought made his heart pound.

Yet, it was not in Li Ximing's nature to make bold, confident promises. He mulled it over before speaking.

"The divine abilities of each tradition are unique. Whether one can master them depends on one's disposition and the nature of the tradition itself. I have never read the cultivation method, so I cannot say for certain. World's Radiance is its ancient name; this Life Divine Ability is also called Luminous Heart. It was revised over the years by the emperors of Wei, the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate, and the Dongli Sect. I imagine there must be a path within it to cultivate an open and honorable heart."

Tinglan looked away, seemingly having anticipated his cautious response. "It has indeed been greatly improved," she said quietly. "The Cui Clan cultivated themselves through rites, which led to the rise of Dongli. My Purple Smoke was not prosperous back then, but we had some connection to them. The cultivation method for this Life Divine Ability has always been locked away. One can only seek this path after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm; one is not permitted to use this path *to* achieve the Purple Mansion Realm."

A strained smile appeared on her face, as if the words were difficult to say. "This Dao tradition… my Purple Smoke is quite familiar with it. If Zhaojing is interested in the World's Radiance tradition, after you achieve your second divine ability… you may visit the Purple Smoke blessed land."

'So she really does have news of the Life Divine Ability!'

Li Ximing nodded slowly. Though puzzled by the hesitation and bitterness in her tone, he kept his expression calm while his heart filled with light.

He had already made some progress with Audience with the Celestial Gate. Once he consumed the pill refined from the Supreme Yin, his cultivation speed would soar. The spiritual medicine also had the effect of breaking through bottlenecks, putting the Body Divine Ability, Sovereign's Perilous Tread, within his grasp.

If Purple Smoke was willing to provide World's Radiance, then as soon as he mastered Sovereign's Perilous Tread, Li Ximing would possess the two most essential arts of the orthodox Bright Yang path—one for the body and one for life. Once accomplished, combined with Audience with the Celestial Gate, he would instantly leap into the upper echelon of the Purple Mansion Realm!

Cultivators of other traditions were not so fortunate. Between the Cui family and the Dongli Sect, the path had been practically laid bare for him. His greatest worry had been the matter of his Life Divine Ability, and now an unexpected clue had fallen into his lap. How could he not feel his spirit brighten with joy?

'The Purple Mystery is difficult to cross, and I have no other desires. In this life, to wield divine abilities, to cultivate my body and command my fate—this journey will not have been in vain.'

Even the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill in his hand now seemed more precious. The carriage soon came to a halt. A rabbit Demon robed in purple came forward to welcome them. The two alighted from the immortal carriage to the sight of a boiling sea and vast stretches of white sand. On the island, the mountain range billowed with thick smoke.

Li Ximing’s Profound Light swept across the island from between his brows, revealing a complex web of interwoven fire and water veins. The entire island was a landscape of either molten lava or hot springs—a peculiar place indeed. It appeared to be occupied by a demonic sect; black-robed disciples hurried to and fro. Li Ximing and Tinglan ignored them completely. He gave a subtle nod of approval.

"Finding a suitable place for alchemy on short notice was quite the challenge," Tinglan said with a smile. "I surveyed all the nearby seas, and only this one met the requirements."

She turned her palm upward in a gesture of invitation. Li Ximing accepted and walked ahead. As they proceeded towards the mountain at the island's heart, they saw a grim, blood-soaked formation. It was only at the Qi Refining level, but it covered a massive area, which was impressive enough.

This was the outer sea, at the very edge of the East A-Wang Sea. To construct such an array here, the sect must be a well-known demonic power in the local area.

Of course, for the two of them, the formation was non-existent. With a mere step through the Great Void, they passed through it, unseen and unheard. They materialized inside a lavish assembly hall where two guards, radiating demonic energy, stood sentry at the entrance.

Despite the two brilliant Daoist Masters appearing before them, the late-stage Qi Refining guards remained as if blind, seeing nothing at all. Li Ximing and Tinglan strolled leisurely into the hall, where a heated argument was already underway.

"We finally caught someone from the Han Family! On Changdu Island! He's trapped by the grand array!"

"We should attack in full force now and wipe out the Han Family!"

An insidious voice immediately cut in, cursing, "That Han Li is cautious and cunning! How many times has he escaped since Han Shihai died? We must go to the island together and annihilate him!"

"Nonsense! He's just a petty Qi Refining cultivator! Why should we care!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow at the exchange. Tinglan, however, had no interest in the grudges of these small-fry cultivators. "Let me handle this," she said casually.

She lifted her sleeve and pushed the great doors open with a creak. Inside, a hulking man sat sprawled on a throne of black and white bones. Li Ximing didn't bother to get a closer look. Tinglan simply pursed her lips and blew gently, as if extinguishing a candle.

*Whoosh…*

A purple wind swept through the hall. The domineering island master on his throne and the imposing guards at his side all seemed to be illusions. They crumbled like sand and scattered into nothingness. Their black-scaled armor and gleaming weapons were instantly sliced into neat, fingernail-sized discs that clattered across the floor.

Yet, the candlelight in the hall remained perfectly still, its gentle glow illuminating the now-empty seats.

In a single instant, the bustling chamber fell utterly silent, devoid of any living soul.

It was impossible to know how many Foundation Establishment Realm and Qi Refining cultivators had been extinguished in that single breath. As casually as if she were brushing dust from her clothes, Tinglan remarked, "A pity they aren't from the righteous path. Otherwise, a few could have been left alive to run errands."

She stamped her foot lightly. The entire hall shook violently, and a circular vent opened in the center of the floor, spewing forth a torrent of Baleful Fire Qi. Li Ximing simultaneously activated Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, stabilizing the mountain’s earth veins. Tinglan turned to the rabbit Demon and instructed, "Ze Gui, clean this up. Don't disturb the Daoist Master."

Ze Gui bowed respectfully and withdrew. Li Ximing glanced at the shadows near the entrance; the two guards remained at their posts, completely oblivious.

'The profundity of Purple Smoke's Dao arts is truly remarkable, and Tinglan's cultivation is deep…'

He knew that whatever she had just done was not a divine ability. The purple qi exhibited no control over fire or earth veins, nor did it possess any illusory properties. Her actions, from start to finish, were the product of spell arts, not a divine ability.

Releasing his own power, Li Ximing summoned the Treasure Elephant Cauldron. It swelled like an inflating balloon and settled with a boom over the vent of Baleful Fire Qi. The Immeasurable Water and Fire surged forth once more. Tinglan, meanwhile, beckoned lightly, and a small cauldron appeared in her palm.

The cauldron was purple on top and black on the bottom. The black was not the usual bronze of an alchemy vessel but a dark, fabric-like grey, and it was adorned with images of birds like crows and owls. It was a rare five-legged cauldron.

'The Purple Mansion Realm spiritual artifact, the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron.'

The value of such a spiritual cauldron went without saying. Purple Mansion Realm spiritual artifacts were already exceptionally rare, let alone one designed for alchemy. Li Ximing placed his hands upon it, and a profound sensation arose within him.

"A fine spiritual artifact…" he murmured in appreciation.

But his expression quickly froze.

Under the probe of his spiritual sense, two imposing, ancient seal characters materialized on the bottom of the cauldron: *Cultivation Transcendence*.

'The Great Xiukui Monastery has some nerve… Perhaps it was a gift from Yue Cultivating Sect. Surely they wouldn't have stolen it from the north… True Monarch Taiyue is a renowned, living True Monarch.'

Tinglan seemed not to notice his reaction. She solemnly took out a turquoise jade box and opened it.

Inside, it was filled with a pale white spiritual liquid from which a wave of potent spiritual energy washed over them. Submerged within was a walnut-sized, pure white object. It seemed both liquid and solid, tumbling about with a life of its own, occasionally poking its head above the surface as if observing the world.

Li Ximing’s eyes blazed.

'Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness!'

This was the core ingredient for the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill, the extremely rare Purple Mansion Realm spirit water itself!

Among all the spiritual treasures of the Purple Mansion Realm, the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness was in a class of its own. This was because it possessed the miraculous ability to purify one's Dao foundation and correct a flawed cultivation path!

In the journey of cultivation, the techniques one practiced and the qi one absorbed created a chasm-like difference in future potential. For rogue cultivators who had no choice but to absorb impure qi, their futures were all but sealed. It was for this reason that nine out of ten tales told in the common marketplaces featured this spirit water. Whether the hero was gravely injured and received it as a gift from a beautiful maiden or seized it from an enemy, a single draught would heal his wounds and grant him a complete rebirth, setting him on a path to greatness.

Such stories were ubiquitous. From the scions of Purple Mansion Realm clans down to wandering Embyronic Breathing cultivators, everyone knew of its fame. This was the first time anyone from the Li family had ever laid eyes on it.

The item was clearly precious to Tinglan as well. She held it with extreme care. "Purple Mansion spirit water, the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness, preserved in the Water Mansion's White Partridge Origin Spring. Daoist Friend Zhaojing, please!"

She even specified the water used to preserve it, clearly worried that it might affect his alchemy. As what came next involved the secrets of his own tradition, it was improper for her to watch. She immediately withdrew, closing the hall's great doors behind her and taking a seat cross-legged outside.

With a thought from Li Ximing, the Immeasurable Water and Fire parted. The jade box shot into the opening, and the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness plunged out of its preserving water and into the cauldron.

*BOOM!*

The sound of a roaring flood filled the air, like crashing waves on a stormy sea. The Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness was Valley Water, and the cauldron was its valley. It was a spirit water perfectly suited for alchemy, and as Li Ximing began the refinement, the process felt smooth and natural. He enveloped the essence with a refined medicinal liquid, slapped the side of the cauldron, and in a single breath, the alchemical aroma shifted several times as the Immeasurable Water and Fire boiled furiously.

A full one hundred days passed. Under Tinglan's anxious gaze, heavy rain clouds gathered in the sky. They hung dark and low but refused to release their rain, casting a humid, stuffy pall over the entire island. The once-dry sand quickly grew damp, threatening to turn to mud.

*BOOM!*

Muffled thunder rumbled from within the clouds, a sound without light. Tinglan looked up at the sky, a hint of joy on her face as she counted the days.

"A pill forged in a hundred days," she nodded. "That's a good omen."

*Creeak…*

The doors to the great hall slowly opened a crack. She looked up to see a thick, white vapor pouring out, cascading down the steps like a waterfall. It carried no fragrance, yet wherever it passed, grass sprouted, and insects began to chirp, creating a scene of vibrant life.

A Daoist Master in white and gold robes stepped out, a smile on his face. He looked up and made a congratulatory gesture.

"Congratulations, Tinglan!"

The woman’s eyes sparkled. Li Ximing beamed.

"The Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron is a truly magnificent treasure! With its assistance, and with heaven, earth, and man all aligned, I managed to produce four pills!"

"Excellent!"

In the Dao of alchemy, a single batch at the Embyronic Breathing stage could yield a dozen pills. At Qi Refining, the number usually dropped to below ten, and by the Foundation Establishment Realm, it was typically between six and nine. At the Purple Mansion Realm, a yield of three or four spirit pills was already considered a fine result. Li Ximing had originally promised three or fewer, which was why Tinglan had so readily agreed.

To have two extra pills—nearly double the expected amount—how could Tinglan not be surprised and overjoyed? "Zhaojing is truly a master of the Dao of Alchemy!" she exclaimed. "Even Senior Xiao would likely produce the same number! Truly… a talent that astounds the world!"

Tinglan’s words were sincere. Li Ximing was not yet a hundred years old, yet his skill was comparable to that of an old master who had dedicated centuries to the craft. How could he not be described as astoundingly talented?

But Xiao Chuting was no ordinary figure. Though both were progenitors of an Immortal Clan's divine abilities, Li Ximing knew the vast gap between them. Setting all else aside, when Li Ximing broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, he had faced Changxiao. When Xiao Chuting had his trial, he faced the Daoist Master Tianyuan of the Golden Feather Sect! In the end, the Man on Creek had emerged completely unscathed, and not a single direct descendant of the Xiao family had fallen.

Li Ximing dared not compare himself to such a figure. "Daoist Friend, you exaggerate," he said seriously. "If Senior Xiao were here, he would have refined at least six pills."

Tinglan was filled with joy and cared little whether it was four pills or six. She watched as Li Ximing shook his sleeve, producing a jade box. He opened it gently to reveal four pure white pills, each with shimmering golden veins.

"Wonderful, wonderful…" she murmured.

Li Ximing smiled. "I refined these pills, so I know them well. As they are pills of Valley Water, they must always be kept in a container. Exposure to the world will diminish their properties, and exposure to the Great Void will annihilate them instantly. You must store them with care."

"Thank you for the reminder, Zhaojing!"

Tinglan may well have known this already, but she accepted his advice graciously. When she saw Li Ximing produce the golden Treasure Elephant Cauldron to return it, she quickly waved her hands.

"I cannot accept this. That you refined four pills is already beyond my wildest expectations. I should be the one thanking you. Please, accept the Treasure Elephant Cauldron as a return gift!"

"Oh?"

For a moment, Li Ximing was genuinely tempted. He didn't have an alchemy cauldron of his own, and while the Treasure Elephant Cauldron wasn't an ancient artifact, it was a top-tier dharma artifact and felt comfortable to use. Such a cauldron was invaluable, but its worth couldn't compare to two Purple Mansion Realm spirit pills. Accepting it wouldn't be excessive. As he hesitated, Tinglan smiled.

"I obtained the Treasure Elephant Cauldron from the Thundercloud Monastery's grotto-heaven. I don't possess my master's great skill; he acquired both a spiritual artifact and a thunderstone, while I only managed to get some Dao traditions and dharma artifacts."

"This cauldron was forged after the monastery sealed its grotto-heaven, so it's not an ancient artifact, but its body is excellent. It was made with the True Fire dao's Trueflame Goldstone and the Supreme Yang dao's Cloudgaze Cursive Liquid."

Although both materials were of the Foundation Establishment Realm level, they were rare treasures even back then. Now, even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators rarely possessed them. After a few polite refusals, Li Ximing accepted the cauldron, holding it with clear admiration.

He returned the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron to Tinglan, who then used her Supreme Minister's Gourd to collect the Immeasurable Water and Fire. Once they were seated, Tinglan smiled at him, placed the jade box on the table, and began to explain.

"The Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill, refined from the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness. In ancient times, it could bring the dead back to life and regrow flesh on bones. Now that souls dissipate first, the pill can no longer save them, but it has no problem healing the Dharma Body of a Purple Mansion cultivator and extending their lifespan."

"It can also resolve calamities of fire, heal injuries from golden gales, and purge impurities from one's immortal foundation, elevating one's Dao. It must never touch the ground; it will dissolve on contact with earth."

"The pill also has some minor uses that you probably won't need. It can resolve fertility issues for Purple Mansion cultivators, alleviate the weakness after childbirth, and accelerate the gestation of a divine ability after absorbing another's immortal foundation."

She smiled faintly. "The part about purging impurities sounds tempting, but it's not as powerful as consuming a whole Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness. In my Purple Smoke, we typically use the pill like this…"

"For instance, if someone reached Foundation Establishment Realm with a third-grade technique and later switched to a compatible fourth-grade technique, they would take this pill when breaking through to the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. It would not only expand their cultivation and solidify their foundation but also refine their immortal foundation."

Li Ximing had the recipe, but the pill's history, origins, and the extensive records of its effects were clearly known only to Tinglan's lineage. Her detailed explanation was related to an unspoken rule in alchemy.

When an alchemist succeeds, they typically estimate a yield. If they produce more than expected, the extra pills are often not mentioned and are silently kept as their fee. Although Li Ximing had presented four pills, Tinglan did not believe for a moment that he had only managed to make four.

Her being so clear was a gesture of goodwill. He had promised three or fewer but delivered four, which was no small matter.

'He probably made five,' Tinglan thought. 'He must know how precious the pills are, so he didn't take much for himself.'

This act not only gave Purple Smoke ample face but also demonstrated his restrained character. It was why she had gifted him the Treasure Elephant Cauldron as a sign of her gratitude.

Li Ximing simply smiled and nodded.

'The Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron is truly incredible,' he thought to himself. 'And my control over the Immeasurable Water and Fire is simple enough. This batch produced a full six pills…'

At least one of those pills was thanks to the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron, and another was the result of favorable conditions and a bit of luck. He had discreetly kept two for himself, primarily to foster good relations with Purple Smoke.

The reason was simple: it was a Supreme Yang Dao tradition, and his own Life Divine Ability was still in their hands…

'Besides, if Tinglan profits greatly this time, she'll have to come to me for alchemy again. After a few more times, my own stores will be full.'

He was quite fond of the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill. His junior, Li Minggong, had a slightly inferior immortal foundation. With this pill, he might be able to open up new paths for her.

With their business concluded, Tinglan considered for a moment, then her expression turned serious.

"There is something I must tell you, Zhaojing…"

Li Ximing raised his eyebrows.

"This matter is important, but not urgent," Tinglan continued. "It was another reason for my visit. I didn't want to affect your alchemy, so I didn't mention it before. Now that the pills are made, I should tell you."

She stated solemnly, "True Monarch is about to reincarnate in Jiangbei for his cultivation. There is just over a year left until it happens."

"What?!"

Li Ximing was stunned into silence, his face a picture of shock. Tinglan quickly explained, trying to placate him.

"The matter is significant, but thankfully it is in Jiangbei, not Jiangnan. His path will also take him north, so it has little to do with us here. However, your clan once had a presence in Jiangbei, so you should be aware."

A sense of unease settled over Li Ximing. He shook his head anxiously. "Sigh… It hasn't been that long. How could we run into this sort of thing again?"

Hearing this, Tinglan grew thoughtful. "Daoist Friend, surely you aren't planning to return to the mainland? I'm afraid it won't be convenient… and even if you went back, it wouldn't help much. You would just attract unwanted attention. Luoxia is still respectful toward Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. They generally won't cause a Purple Mansion cultivator to lose face. As long as you don't court death yourself, at most one or two of your clan's direct descendants might get dragged in. It won't escalate to an existential crisis."

She sighed softly. "After all… Luoxia has to consider our feelings. If a Purple Mansion Realm clan were wiped out because of this, future reincarnations would become difficult. It wouldn't look good to stir up resentment among cultivators and mortals."

"I asked Yehui; he doesn't seem to be planning to go back either. That Li Jiangqian is a capable person, so there's no need to worry."

Clearly, with a True Monarch involved, Yehui wanted nothing more to do with the Capital immortals Dao. Li Ximing, however, was from an Immortal Clan and, among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, placed an exceptionally high value on his family. Tinglan understood this and had deliberately waited until after the alchemy was complete to tell him, fearing he would act rashly and jeopardize her pills. Hearing her words, Li Ximing mulled it over.

"I just hope that he is sensible and maintains contact."

"He wouldn't dare be anything but sensible." A smile touched Tinglan's lips, as if she had recalled something amusing. "They are far more afraid than your clan is. A True Monarch's reincarnation needs antagonists. The Capital immortals Dao has demonic origins, a very sensitive identity. Clans like yours, which have presented themselves as righteous for generations… in the stories, you're usually on the side with the beautiful maiden. The young mistress might be headstrong at first, but she'll eventually fall for him. You might even gain some benefits."

Li Ximing sighed and shook his head. "I've read more of those stories than you have, Daoist Friend. There's another kind, where the protagonist is righteous and discerning, and my 'righteous' clan is exposed as ugly and corrupt. Meanwhile, the demonic sect's maiden is seen as genuine and lovable. No clan's history is perfectly clean. If someone wants to dig up dirt, they'll find it. It's best not to get involved at all. The potential benefits aren't worth the risk."

Tinglan chuckled. "You see things clearly… That's true… And that Moongaze Lake…"

"Hey!"

Li Ximing dared not let her continue. A True Monarch's powers were vast; who knew if he might draw inspiration from their conversation? If things really played out that way, Yehui would laugh his head off. He hesitated for a moment, then began to write a letter.

'Even though the younger generation at home is clever, who's to say one of them won't be influenced by fate? Li Jiangqian has a Talisman Seed in him, but I should still write a letter by hand to ensure that power in the clan remains in the hands of my grand-uncle and Li Jiangqian.'
