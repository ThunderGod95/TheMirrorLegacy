# Chapter 974: Rank Designation

The ninety-nine Profound Gates of the Lingyang Immutable Palace blazed with golden light, unleashing ninety-nine rays of suppressive brilliance. They converged on a single point, like countless eyes suspended in the void, all fixed upon the silver gleam.

'To think it's already reached the point where a Dharma Treasure is needed for suppression...'

Yet the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination offered no resistance. Instead, time and time again, it loyally issued warnings, illuminating the myriad possible changes of the future as they constantly evolved within the Dharma Treasure's narrow confines.

He watched the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination, a quiet understanding dawning in his heart. He finally saw why a Dharma Treasure was necessary for this. Raising one hand palm-up, he manifested a ball of silver light.

The Power of Divination.

This was the very thing the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination had sensed and released all those years ago. Its wondrous aspect had attached itself to Liu Changdie. Later, when it came within range of the Immortal Mirror, Lu Jiangxian had retrieved it from Liu Changdie due to the Talisman Qi resonance. He had used it several times, leaving only this tiny speck behind.

This minuscule amount wasn't enough for any major divination; at most, it could perform a single calculation of fortune and misfortune. As Lu Jiangxian's Dao-Profundity increased, he grew reluctant to expend it on something like analyzing cultivation methods. He had kept it in reserve ever since.

Now, as he pinched the star-bright speck of silver light in his palm, it surged like boiling water. The silver light in the white-haired man's eyes intensified. Guided by the Talisman Qi resonance between the speck and the main Talisman, the light in his hand rapidly shifted, forming the image of a middle-aged man in white robes.

Liu Changdie.

However, the Liu Changdie in the vision was pale, his aura weak, and his cultivation low. This was the Liu Changdie the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination had foreseen years ago. As Lu Jiangxian poured in a stream of dharma power and Talisman Qi, time itself flowed backward, and the scenes began to reverse.

The image finally settled on a naive-looking young man. But unlike the abrupt stop when Lu Jiangxian had previously viewed his memories, this vision continued to rewind. A silver light flowed backward out of the young man, crossed countless obstacles, and returned to reveal the landscape of Wanling Heaven.

In this memory, the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination was nothing like its current, docile self. It struggled frantically, its dense silver light shaking the Lingyang Immutable Palace to its core. The ninety-nine Profound Gates swayed in chaos, their spiritual light scattering, threatening to shatter the world.

But no matter how the Talisman struggled, the Lingyang Immutable Palace held it firm. Yet, for one brief instant, the silver light flared and surged. Its very status elevated sharply, allowing a part of it to break free...

Lu Jiangxian's heart tightened. As information flooded his mind, memories surged to the surface.

'This is... the moment that first sliver of Talisman Qi was bestowed!'

'Back then, the Li family was just a minor clan in Lijing. After I repaired the fragment, I bestowed the first Talisman Qi upon them, one called "Aegis of Life." But that was the very first time. My methods and power were still lacking, and the act triggered a powerful resonance from all quarters...'

'That must have been when it happened...'

'The Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination had been suppressed in Wanling Heaven by the Lingyang Immutable Palace for ages. The artifact possesses a spirit of its own; day after day, it calculated, seeking a path to freedom. My bestowing of Talisman Qi created a resonance. This allowed the Talisman to suddenly elevate its status, slipping a single wondrous aspect out of the Lingyang Immutable Palace!'

'This wondrous aspect drifted aimlessly until it landed on Liu Changdie. It divined his future for him. When I stumbled upon it, its power wasn't depleted; it still held several divinations. Its ultimate goal was to guide Liu Changdie, step by step, to advance his cultivation, unveil Wanling Heaven, and release the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination!'

'But I intercepted that wondrous aspect halfway. Then, some unknown Daoist tradition interfered and severed his original path, forcing him to cultivate the Vault Metal. In the end, it only secured his opportunity to reach the Purple Mansion Realm, but at least his life was saved.'

But looking at it now, this item shouldn't be called the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination anymore. It has already transformed into a Dharma Treasure, now called the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book!

Just as Lu Jiangxian had sensed long ago, the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book divines the future, calculates profound mysteries, measures karmic threads, and governs all that is undecided, all while shielding heavenly secrets... More importantly, this artifact is entangled with the Metallic Essence of 'Heaven–Governing' and is deeply connected to the Golden Position. It is an object of world-shaking significance.

From Lu Jiangxian's perspective, this artifact could be called the Heaven–Governing Rank Designation.

The term 'Rank Designation' had been mentioned by the Si Xunhui before. Even the Li family had heard of it; the Si family's deep roots allowed them to recall the term. They only knew it as an alias for a Dharma Treasure, but they were unaware of the profound difference between a Rank Designation and a typical Dharma Treasure.

A Rank Designation was not something just anyone could possess. It was formed when a cultivator of immense divine ability verified their path against a Golden Position, using the Great Void to borrow a sliver of that position's status. To call it a Dharma Treasure was inaccurate; it was more like a fragment of the Golden Position itself—like a 'Fruition,' 'Intercalary,' or 'Auxillary' aspect. It was less an object belonging to a True Monarch and more an object belonging to the Golden Position.

Take the Heart-Awakening Sword of Pristine Water. According to Lu Jiangxian's deductions, Du Qing's own divine ability was likely insufficient to condense the Pristine Water Rank Designation. It must have been forged when the Feathered Serpent first achieved the Dao. Seated in the high position of Pristine Water, it used its own great divine ability—pledging its very identity as the Master of Pristine Water as collateral—to borrow status from the Pristine Water Fruition Attainment. Only by combining this borrowed status with countless heavenly materials, and even Metallic Essence, was the Pristine Terrace Heart-Awakening Sword forged.

When the Feathered Serpent perished, the collateral itself vanished. Thus, the Pristine Terrace Heart-Awakening Sword, being a Rank Designation, fell back into the Pristine Water Fruition Attainment and disappeared. It was impossible for it to have fallen into the hands of the Dragon-kin.

When Du Qing ascended to the Pristine Water seat, he lacked the immense divine ability to borrow status from the Fruition Attainment himself. However, the Feathered Serpent had already completed the forging. As long as Du Qing held the status of the Master of Pristine Water, he could 'borrow' the Pristine Terrace Heart-Awakening Sword.

The sword could display its full power in Du Qing's hands, but the moment it left his grasp, it would dissipate into nothing.

And the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book was exactly the same! In all likelihood, it was sealed in this place when the revered holder of the 'Heaven–Governing' position was still in the world, and it had never been moved since!

Lu Jiangxian was certain that as long as the assembled True Monarchs had any desire to preserve this Dharma Treasure, they would never dare remove the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book from the Lingyang Immutable Palace. If the Book were given even a single instant to breathe, it would immediately fall back into the 'Heaven–Governing' position and disappear. To retrieve it again would require someone to first ascend to that very position.

'The original master of Wanling Heaven must have suppressed the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book here for this exact reason—to prevent it from vanishing!'

Lu Jiangxian understood perfectly. The reason the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book was refined as a Rank Designation was a clever workaround. The Immortal Mirror's control over Talisman Qi was terrifyingly absolute. The only way to preserve the Book was to counter the Mirror with an equally, insurpassably high Golden Position, binding it within the 'Rank Designation' itself.

As clarity dawned in Lu Jiangxian's mind, his gaze shifted back to the small Power of Divination in his hand.

"The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book is suppressed by the Lingyang Immutable Palace. That much is certain. Outside this grotto-heaven, True Monarchs are everywhere... yet they've made no move to retrieve it. I wonder what they're planning."

He sat down quietly within the Dharma Treasure. The silver light in his hand swirled, connecting with the main artifact through the Talisman Qi resonance. In an instant, all the profound marvels and mysteries of the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book were laid bare to him. A relentless, high-speed flood of divination results, calculations emerging moment by moment, poured frantically into his spiritual sense.

'No matter what, the longer this drags on, the better.'

...

The Great Void.

A brilliant white spear-point hung motionless, yet it commanded the presence of a sharpened blade. The surging True Fire parted before it, revealing a man's cold face. His magnificent robes, wreathed in True Fire, shimmered with light, painting an imposing figure.

But the golden seal from the sky had already stamped down once more!

"Rumble!"

A torrent of blazing True Fire poured down. Li Ximing's 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' manifested, solidly blocking the Spiritual Artifact's blow. But Li Ximing was no longer alone. The bright spear-point lunged, forcing Shilou Yingge to raise a sleeve and wave it with immense presence.

"Sky-Enveloping Fire!"

In an instant, his robes billowed, rolling upward as the flames transformed into the shape of a great bird, binding the long halberd. But from deep within the True Fire, another blade of light erupted, slashing straight at his heart.

"Clang!"

Shilou Yingge was unfazed. His sleeve flared wide, and a bead of light shot out. It detonated with a thunderous crash, unleashing rolling lightning that shattered the light-blade. He did not press the attack. Instead, he dissolved into a cloud of True Fire and reappeared a short distance away, his expression serene.

Li Zhouwei's words had been harsh, but his reasoning was sound.

He, Shilou Yingge, had chosen this moment to strike precisely to declare his stance. The grotto-heaven was about to open, and nearly every Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was gathered here. There would be no better time.

His Gao family needed a life-and-death battle against the Li!

The earlier skirmish on the shore had been nothing. Even when Murong Yan made his move, Shilou Yingge had held back. The Gao family certainly needed to show their colors, but the situation had been unclear. A token fight over the "North-South conflict" wouldn't be a mortal struggle, rendering it meaningless.

'Only by truly offending Li Zhouwei, by engaging in a battle with the real risk of death, can we truly sever ties with the Wei-Li!'

The stratagem they had laid years ago had been missed by a cruel twist of fate. The Murong family had warned him repeatedly. He understood just how dangerous his own Valiant King's pro-Li stance was, and just how humiliating their forced migration south had been. The heavier that humiliation, the stronger his desire to make his stance known. The only places left to do that were here, or inside the grotto-heaven!

'If the Gao family is to avoid becoming a sacrifice in the coming tide, if we are to have any hope of advancing, we must become a blade in someone's hand. Even if that means becoming a different _kind_ of sacrifice... it's better than the entire clan being exterminated.'

He couldn't guarantee that both Li members would enter the grotto-heaven, so he had struck decisively to force Li Zhouwei to appear. He had already resolved that even if Li Zhouwei failed to show, he, Shilou Yingge, would forgo the grotto-heaven's opportunities entirely, if necessary, to cripple Li Ximing and burn that bridge completely.

But the man before him had spoken. His words were laced with mockery, yet they were also perfectly, brutally honest:

'He, Li Zhouwei, would be entering the grotto-heaven. They could settle it inside!'

Wanling Heaven was no ordinary place. It was likely the most valuable grotto-heaven to appear in years; a single treasure from within might be worth a century of cultivation. If he could avoid missing this opportunity, Shilou Yingge was unwilling to do so. His feelings were complicated. The True Fire behind him slowly receded. Meanwhile, the turbulence in the Great Void intensified as shafts of purple light descended—other cultivators were already trying to force their way in.

Shilou Yingge watched him quietly and said in a low voice:

"You and I will settle this inside the grotto-heaven."

The crimson light receded like a tide, flowing away toward the grotto-heaven portal as purple-gold light began to converge. The long halberd spun once before coming to rest, poised in the void. Li Zhouwei retracted his gaze and turned to Li Ximing.

"My apologies for involving you, Grand-Uncle."

Li Ximing shook his head emphatically. Never mind the humiliation the other man had just dealt him; the mere sight of Li Zhouwei lifted his spirits. He grinned.

"What nonsense is that!"

He took a step forward, looking him up and down.

He saw that the young man before him had grown even more imposing. A faint, pale, illusory radiance cloaked his body, but most important were the two strands of golden light dancing faintly around him!

Even though he had already received the news via a jade talisman, Li Ximing couldn't help but beam. As expected, Li Zhouwei grinned.

"This junior was fortunate enough to succeed!"

At this moment, within Li Zhouwei's Shengyang Acupoint Mansion, two colors intertwined. Two multicolored lights flashed, a confluence of gold and white. He now possessed two divine abilities. In addition to the golden, profound unity of 'Audience with the Celestial Gate,' there was now a second, snow-white divine ability: the Supreme Radiance Profound Dharma Body's 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread'!

As a Body Divine Ability of the Bright Yang Dao, 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' was perfectly suited to Li Zhouwei, matching both his temperament and his circumstances. Its achievement was magnificent. Unlike formless Body Divine Abilities like 'Thousand-Hundred Body' or 'Spring's Echo' that focused on dispersal, this divine ability was all about empowering the physical self to tyrannically crush all enemies!

Li Zhouwei estimated that his own physical body had likely already reached the Maha level. If this Body Divine Ability reached major completion, he would advance even further.

And the true value of 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' was in its name—treading peril!

If he were besieged, the more dangerous his situation and the more enemies who surrounded him, the more terrifying the divine ability's enhancement would become. Li Zhouwei could even sense his 'White Qilin Fate,' which at its peak could add nearly ninety percent more power to 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread.'

On the other hand, if the besieging cultivators could overwhelm and kill him, all was well. But if he managed to escape, the 'peril-treading' would be a success. The more additional power 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' had accumulated, the faster all injuries sustained in that battle would heal!

Beyond its powerful combat enhancements, 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' also possessed the ability to adapt to the moment and return to the correct path. It was just as the Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass mentioned: "One who treads peril is deeply cautious; one who rests in safety grows careless." Whenever he was in the middle of a charge and was affected by illusion-type spell arts, he could instantly break free and regain his bearings.

'It's just a pity this divine ability is only useful when charging into battle...'

It also enhanced his flight and Great Void traversal speed, a common trait of a Body Divine Ability, though it wasn't as effective as the more ephemeral movement arts. Having only just formed, the boost was less than five percent.

But just as 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' had its drawback of being cumbersome, 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' also had a weakness. This Dharma Body was vulnerable to cumulative, entangling damage. It fared poorly against explosive, high-impact trauma like Sword Intent, sharp Metallic Essence, or lightning. But its greatest weakness was an enemy who simply refused to engage, instead using abilities like imprisonment, clones, dispersal, and illusion to stall for time...

The remaining minor marvels, such as a significant boost to the power of his 'Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light,' were too numerous to list. Most were helpful aids in combat and cultivation, but the process had filled Li Zhouwei with countless new insights, causing his Dao-Profundity to advance by leaps and bounds.

The two men locked eyes, wanting to say more, but the tremors in the Great Void grew increasingly violent, forcing them to look toward the disturbance. Li Ximing quickly pulled several medicinal pills he had recently acquired from his sleeve and pressed them into Li Zhouwei's hand.

"Go, quickly... We can talk about everything else when you return. Just be careful inside!"

Li Zhouwei didn't waste words. He gave a slight bow, his eyes shining.

"This junior will go on ahead!"

He then summoned his Heavenly Light and transformed into a streak of light, vanishing into the portal. Li Ximing let out a quiet sigh of relief, though his gaze remained wary as he scanned the surroundings.

"I don't know if Tianwan has activated the Hongxue Dao Lineage, but I can't let her just sneak away with it!"

Just then, a ripple passed through the Great Void, and the woman in pale cyan robes reappeared. Kuang Yu looked thoroughly indignant.

"That bastard Shilou is too arrogant!"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. He asked:

"Daoist friend, are you not going inside to seek treasure?"

Kuang Yu's charming face clearly showed her temptation, but she gritted her teeth and shook her head.

"The Xinyu Archipelago can't spare me... and I can't afford to get injured. It's fine out here; I like to think I have some ability, and I can join in the excitement. But inside a grotto-heaven, it's too much trouble."

Li Ximing grew thoughtful. He was already wary of heading off alone, giving Tianwan a chance to try something. He remembered that this woman's relationship with Crimson Reef Island wasn't much better than his own. Secretly pleased, he smiled.

"In that case, would you be willing to accompany me, fellow Daoist? I can compensate you with medicinal pills."

"Oh?"

Kuang Yu raised an eyebrow. Her features were slightly different from the women of Jiangnan, possessing a distinct charm. Her dark eyes, illuminated by the ambient light, flashed with a hint of blue-violet. A smile touched her eyes.

"What's this? The great Alchemist has a use for little old me?"

"You flatter me!"

She clearly had a playful nature. Li Ximing shook his head, slightly embarrassed, and explained the situation with Tianwan, omitting any mention of the Hongxue Dao Lineage. The woman's eyes instantly lit up, and her enthusiasm seemed to surpass his own.

"Oh, yes, yes..."

Kuang Yu gave a cunning smile and replied:

"Her family's Dao Lineage is a fool's path, but she doesn't cultivate Merging Fire. She may be arrogant, but who knows what tricks she has up her sleeve? It's better to be careful... I'll back you up, fellow Daoist!"
