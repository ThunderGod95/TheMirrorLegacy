# Chapter 852: Crimson Reef

In the mirror’s world.

Thick mist dispersed, and shimmering soft light fell on the misty mountain top. Lu Jiangxian paused with Dangjiang in hand. This fabricated Immortal Official had his spiritual sense suppressed and was dazed and confused in Lu Jiangxian’s grasp.

He moved his divine sense slightly, dispersing the glow of various magical arts around him and dimming his clothes. Only then did he sit quietly under the tree and begin to reflect carefully, Using the hidden seed in Buzi’s soul to drag him into an illusion in advance... With my current Inherent rank and the Metallic Essence, even a Golden Core Realm cultivator would be stunned for a moment. This fellow absolutely lacks the ability to see through it... There shouldn’t be any traces left...

Lu Jiangxian now possessed the ability to traverse the great void and Buzi had already revealed his ambitions. Dangjiang was no longer of any use in Buzi’s body. After all, it was a part of Maha Jinlian. Retrieving it might serve other purposes.

The only risk was Buzi’s unusual behavior. If he failed to conceal the traces and was soul-searched... Fortunately, the restriction was still in place.

He had studied the immortal texts, and the mirror itself had become more complete. This time, he had focused on reinforcing the seal, making it completely undetectable and placing it inside Buzi’s body, to prevent him from falling into the hands of any True Monarch.

After thinking it over, he found nothing amiss and pondered silently, Although this man had once humbled himself, he was not easy to deal with. Relying solely on Inherent rank to intimidate him wouldn’t be enough to control him and might even arouse his suspicion. I could only keep him dangling with this method of extending the cultivation path.

Lu Jiangxian had no real immortal arts or techniques to give him. Sending ordinary things would only reveal the truth. Thus, he had carefully refined the Immortal Mirror’s essence-extraction and spirit-seizing methods before handing them to him. He thought, If the Li Family cannot find a Purple Mansion Realm demonic creature, then let Buzi search for one himself. As for whether to reward him after he sacrifices it to me, that’s another matter. At worst, I just won’t respond, and he’ll only suspect the offering wasn’t grand enough.

He wasn’t worried that Buzi wouldn’t take the bait. Though this man was cunning and treacherous, his natural talent was excellent, and his desire for the Dao was unshakable. It was precisely because he was cunning and knew the taboos of all sides that Lu Jiangxian dared to let him try.

But Purple Mansion Realm demonic creatures were not so easy to kill, especially one without any backing. It was just a casual hook, after all. Lu Jiangxian quickly shifted his attention, savoring an interesting matter, He thinks I am Yingze...

The leap in logic wasn’t hard to understand. Lu Jiangxian himself had once doubted it, but from what he heard, Yingze had attained the Supreme Yang Fruition Attainment, which didn’t quite match.

According to Li Jiangqun’s memories, I should be the Lord of the Moonlight Origin Mansion, bearing the Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment, which also matches the current abilities of the Immortal Mirror. But whichever way I look at it, these two should not be the same person...

What was even harder to account for was the relationship between Moonlight Origin Mansion and Green Pine Temple. The Kong Family said that Yingze was from Moonlight Origin Mansion, yet he was also the master of Green Pine Temple’s Mirrored Mirage Grotto Heaven. Even the Sun Seeker Ring had been engraved with Green Pine Temple Lu Jiangxian...

He couldn’t make sense of it, so he gave up for now. He looked down at the rows of moon-white buildings below as he stood atop the peak. He lightly flicked his sleeve.

An elegant, moon-white tower rose from the mountainside in a burst of radiant light. Eighty-one jade steps unfurled one by one, winding downward. Countless jade slips poured down like mountains and seas, yet each one landed neatly in its designated cabinet.

The Dao Collection of Anhuai Heaven is all here!

He landed atop the exquisitely elegant celestial tower, which was filled with countless magnificent corridors. Countless jade slips spurted out from the mountain peak above; some streaming through windows, some from palace gates, and others from corridors, but all rushing into this white jade tower like a storm.

Lu Jiangxian murmured, “Hundreds of years of work. The Anhuai Heaven Dao Collection, brought together by families from Jiangnan and Jiangbei as well as small clans from the Eastern Sea. Altogether, there are over sixteen thousand Daoist texts and more than fifty one thousand spell arts...”

He stood in front of the white jade tower and flipped his hand over. Several colored immortal slips appeared at once.

“There are Twelve Purple Mansion Realm cultivation methods. One Radiant Fire, one Whole Pill, two Purple Essence, one Bright Yang, one Jade True, one Azure Proclaimation, and five True Essence.”

With the exception of Bright Yang, Jade True, and Azure Proclaimation, the rest all came from the Anhuai Heaven Dao Collection. The Palace of Enlightened Dao might not have held all the cultivation methods of Ning State, since some might have been moved earlier, but the sheer number was still astonishing.

Lu Jiangxian threw them into the tower, then suddenly paused, beckoning. Six of them were the Yuan Family’s Yanyang Temple Dao lineage, also an extremely ancient immortal art. Lu Jiangxian read through them carefully and gradually realized something was wrong.

Among these six, only Profound Goat was a Purple Mansion Realm technique; the rest were all Foundation Establishment Realm methods. Together, they formed the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual.

When Lu Jiangxian first obtained this technique, he didn’t understand it well and had only skimmed it. Now, after reading so many Purple Mansion Realm methods, he finally noticed the problem with this manual.

“The Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual once said that once Profound Goat is cultivated to the Purple Mansion Realm, and the other four Foundation Establishment Realm techniques are completed one by one, one can attain divine powers...”

“How could that be...”

Although Lu Jiangxian had never practiced it himself, he had written a Purple Mansion Realm technique himself and understood what Purple Mansion Realm cultivation entailed. If one did not consume others, they could only refine themselves, and it would take five Purple Mansion Realm techniques! If not, why would the elementals remain trapped in the southern border!

He finally took out the technique, condensed a human figure before him using moonlight, and carefully deduced it. After a dozen seconds, he saw the flaw and muttered, “This ancient technique states... once the other five Daos condense an Immortal Foundation within the body, they can resonate with the external world and transform into divine abilities...

“But in this era of heaven collapsing and earth splitting, the heavenly Dao itself has disappeared. What is there to resonate with?! Even this one Purple Mansion Realm technique Profound Goat requires resonance. Without that portion, how difficult it would be to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!”

Lu Jiangxian silently put away the jade slip, gradually realizing, So the Yuan Family’s relocation from the north, flourishing for a time yet never producing a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, was not without reason... their decline was long predetermined... The Yuan Family might not have lacked spiritual qi to cultivate Profound Goat, but in the end, the family’s ancestor realized this flaw and switched to cultivating Water Virtue...

He returned the techniques to the white jade tower, sighed inwardly, and glanced up at the sky. The battle inside Anhuai Heaven was growing more intense. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who wanted to enter had already gone in, and the Great Ning Palace, which had served as the entrance, was on the verge of collapse.

Li Xuanfeng is still inside.

Li Xuanfeng had gained much in the Great Ning Palace. Not only was that screen a dharma artifact from ancient techniques, but even the mercury droplet containing Helian Changguang’s soul was no ordinary item. Even the casually taken incense burner was remarkable.

It’s a pity that the Supreme Yang Sun Essence couldn’t be taken; otherwise, it would truly have been a massive gain...

Si Yuanli’s limited vision couldn’t see it, but Lu Jiangxian’s divine sense had swept over it clearly. The mercury droplet housing Helian Changguang’s soul was clearly a Whole Pill treasure! It would be useless in the hands of an ordinary cultivator, but in the hands of one who practiced this method, it could be of endless use.

In the Anhuai Heaven Dao Collection, there is a sixth-grade Whole Pill text called the Houshu Golden Book. I could bestow this book while waiting for the Bright Yang cultivation to succeed. The Whole Pill is famous for its marvelous transformations and has great uses.

He organized the techniques, then leaped out again, stopping in the great void. As he watched the countless divine lights gradually rising in Anhuai Heaven, he examined the opportunities, thinking to himself, That’s a Metallic Essence of the True Essence Dao...

Although these Purple Mansion Realm cultivators didn’t have immortal arts, their means with Metallic Essence would certainly not compare to his. But if they had divine powers, holding Metallic Essence would enable countless possibilities...

Metallic Essence was incredibly powerful; when Duanmu Kui failed to break through to the Golden Core Realm, the two Underworld beings that emerged from the Metallic Essence had needed the use of Dharma relics to be subdued...

Dongfang You of the Dragon Clan had also failed in his breakthrough attempt, causing the chaos of Falling Water Rising Storm in the Eastern Sea. The fallen Metallic Essence had naturally gone to the Dragon Monarch, and none of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators dared or even cared to fight for it.

After all, there’s someone holding the Converging Water Fruition Attainment, but True Essence is different...

This True Essence Metallic Essence originally came from a True Monarch. Once it was seized, even the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Mahas couldn’t calculate its background. There would be no aftermath after seizing the treasure. Once one had the Metallic Essence in hand, one could reincarnate anywhere and cultivate True Essence again, gaining another five hundred years of life... They would even have hope of reaching the Golden Core Realm!

When one’s true end drew near and their Dao path was severed, even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would risk everything to snatch the Metallic Essence, using it up before falling, and then seek rebirth...

As for the new Purple Mansion Realm cultivators like Hengxing and Zhang Yun... they were taking a cautious approach. They are more interested in fishing in troubled waters and dividing up the legacies left behind by the desperate Purple Mansion Realm cultivators...

Boom!

Purple lightning rumbled and exploded in the clouds. Li Qinghong, clad in a long green feathered robe, gathered lightning on her spear and descended on a pitch-black mountain peak, casting a heavy gaze northward.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

Few dared to confront her directly as she fought her way through. Most merely tested her strength. The devil cultivators were mostly cautious. A few greedy ones attacked for a few moves before retreating. Therefore, her mana consumption remained low.

The worry on the woman’s face was not due to the demonic smoke but because of the overall situation between the south and the north.

Chaos... thought Li Qinghong.

Li Qinghong had felt this deeply as she came along. Xu State had fallen into utter chaos. Though the demonic clouds still roiled, the situation was completely different from before.

Previously, though it was chaotic, there was order within the chaos. You could faintly see traces of the choices of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. At least the northern devil cultivators still followed some rules... thought Li Qinghong.

Now the chaos among the devil cultivators had reached the level of headless flies. Whether it was in the east, west, south, or north, one could see devil cultivators from various sects and families flitting around. Some were even led by Purple Mansion and Golden Core Dao cultivators, all fighting for themselves.

Outside of Xu State, devil cultivators and Buddhist cultivators were still gathering rapidly. Where she stood near Lake Xian, she could even see many cultivators from the Eastern Sea swarming ashore and surging southward, hinting at a strange and ominous new tide.

Now Jiangnan is the Upper Evil Spirit Storage, where all evil and corruption emerge. When the devil cultivators reach the river’s edge, their strength grows even stronger. Why would they stop there and not continue to sweep downward...

Li Qinghong kept worrying as she withdrew the lightning from her spear. Suddenly, she felt a violent surge of devil wind rushing in from the east, whipping the ground smoke into a frenzy.

She frowned lightly, raised her spear, and pointed it diagonally at the ground. Purple lightning flickered to life with a thunderous roar. She snapped her spear up and it flared with blazing lightning that shone brightly in the sky.

Boom!

A gray flame shot out from the demonic smoke and was struck squarely by the spear in midair. The flame exploded with several bursts of light that clung stubbornly to her spear. But the surging lightning shattered it within moments, and it fell to the ground with sizzling sounds.

Crash...

Li Qinghong drew her spear back and took up a defensive stance. The blazing purple lightning danced along the spear and up her hand. Her apricot eyes glowed faintly purple as she looked into the gray smoke.

A tall, thin man in a red robe descended from within the devil winds. His brown boots struck the ground, sending up a wave of gray fire. A command token, gray with red patterns, floated beside him.

He crossed his arms over his chest and looked at Li Qinghong with some curiosity, his gaze somewhat cold, and said, “Fellow Daoist, what an impressive bearing.”

Li Qinghong swept her spiritual sense lightly over him and sensed this man’s overwhelming cultivation. His Dharma robe was especially luxurious. She realized he was no ordinary figure. She silently examined him while estimating the distance in her heart, This place is no more than two hundred and fifty kilometers from the Lake Xian stronghold. I still have three Profound Thunder talismans. If things go awry... retreating wouldn’t be difficult...

As she considered her escape route, the man’s red robe began to float in the demonic smoke. His voice was a bit stiff and sharp as he said, “Fellow Daoist...thunder cultivators are rare these days... and even rarer are female cultivators. It just so happens I’ve heard your name.”

Li Qinghong maintained her impassive stare, but her spiritual sense quickly searched around to see if he had others nearby. Meanwhile, the cultivator before her continued to speak, “My younger sister went to Jiangnan but was stopped by you. She couldn’t save that person and even lost the Merging Fire Token. She has been banished from the island and cannot return...”

The man in the red robe’s face darkened. “And I haven’t yet settled the score with you!”

Li Qinghong immediately understood he came with ill intent. She spun her spear with a flourish and laughed lightly, “Oh? So that foolish woman is your sister. No wonder she had such an aggressive air. She was so arrogant, trying to seize my sword and kill my family. Granting her one Profound Thunder was already merciful!”

It was clear that he was Guo Hongyao’s elder brother, the one who had come for Xu Xiao back then. Li Qinghong instantly understood that he was no friend. She didn’t hesitate as she thrust her spear forward, lightning coursing through it.

Boom!

A swirl of gray fire rose around the man in the red robe. He made a spell gesture and the fire clung to the command token and shot forth. It collided with the lightning in midair and exploded into a sky full of thunder and fire.

His tone was grim as he shouted, “How could I not know about my own sister? Would she target your family without reason? If you had just let them leave peacefully, would things have come to this?”

Li Qinghong danced with the lightning, smothering the rushing gray fire. Her black hair floated lightly in the wind. She couldn’t be bothered to argue and only replied coldly, “What’s the point of talking now? I’d like to see the might of the Crimson Reef Merging Fire!”

Bright purple light gathered on her feathered robe. The man in the red robe laughed out of sheer rage. He pressed two fingers together and the command token leapt up, sending out a stream of gray fire that twisted the air as it burned.

He spat out in a low, hateful voice, “Such bold words! You’ve killed too many devil cultivators and think everyone’s mana will scatter when they face lightning!”
