# Chapter 1015: Soul Refining

A crisp, clear chime shattered the profound silence, echoing across the sky. A speck of gold emerged from the Great Void, blossoming in mid-air into a small umbrella woven from brown and yellow light. Spiritual Qi converged upon its surface, which was adorned with intricate patterns of gold and green, as it floated gently in the air.

It was Cheng Yan’s Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella.

The Spiritual Artifact’s radiant surface was now tightly bound by layers of golden threads, constricting every rib and strut. It struggled, but the bonds held fast, making escape impossible.

This was the most sublime divine ability of the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument: Profound Mystery. It could stealthily lock down an opponent's Spiritual Artifact, and with clever timing, it could have the devastating effect of severing a limb in the heat of battle.

Spiritual Treasures possessed a spirit of their own. The moment Cheng Yan was suppressed, the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella had been recalled.

Li Zhouwei’s gaze, however, remained fixed on the mountain below. Within his golden eyes, black flames seemed to dance, growing more intense with every disciple of the Changxiao Gate who bowed their head in submission.

He raised his halberd, its bright tip pointing toward the immortal mountain beneath his feet.

As he did, the rumbling of thunder began to build. One thousand, eight hundred and twenty-one silver, handleless, diamond-shaped blades materialized, filling the sky. As the halberd’s point shifted, the thunderous patterns on the blades flared with a brilliant light.

“Open the formation. I will only execute the ringleader.”

His voice was calm, yet it struck the mountain like a clap of thunder, draining the color from the faces of the assembled cultivators. The white-templed elder broke out in a cold sweat. Around him, some disciples wept silently while others murmured with downcast eyes, but no one dared to speak out.

In fact, a great many of them rose to their feet, their previous righteous indignation vanished. Averting their gaze from their old sect master, they pleaded in low voices, “Sect Master, open the formation…”

‘Our own Daoist Master has been suppressed and his Spiritual Artifact has been seized!’ they thought. ‘Once those Stormshatter Wedges break through, the entire sect will be sealed. We might not even be able to escape!’

The white-templed elder understood this perfectly well. He glanced around, his heart seized by terror.

It wasn't just Cheng Yan who had recognized the Stormshatter Wedges; the senior cultivators of Changxiao Gate saw them clearly as well. The Azure Pond Sect had to be pulling the strings from behind the scenes. Now, with Changxiao gone and Cheng Yan defeated, disaster was upon them.

Yet, at this critical moment, the white-templed elder stood his ground. Head lowered, he grit his teeth and declared, “The Great Daoist Master must have a hidden card!”

_Boom!_

The one thousand, eight hundred and twenty-one silver blades descended with brutal force.

Unlike the shimmering collision of spiritual energy during the Audience with the Celestial Gate, the Stormshatter Wedges slammed into the formation and locked on tight. Silvery-white tendrils of light spread across the barrier as violent lightning erupted, shaking the very foundations of the mountains.

“Sect Master!”

Desperate pleas rang out, but the white-templed elder remained unmoved, his expression one of unnatural steeliness.

‘If he enters the formation, I will surely die!’

The lightning at the formation’s edge grew thicker, resonating with the mountain’s natural Primordial Magnetism. Dead leaves began to float, and robes clung together as unrest swept through the crowd.

The white-templed elder roared, “The Great Daoist Master has not returned! How can the sect surrender?!”

But the Changxiao Gate was never his to command alone. The various peak masters vied for influence, each with their own agenda. They had only followed him because he was appointed by the Daoist Master. Now that their Daoist Master was trapped under another’s divine ability, what weight did his words carry?

Despite his thunderous shouts, the expressions of those around him remained unchanged. The mountain grew dark again as the lightning storm danced across the formation’s glow. Amidst the chaos, two figures exchanged a subtle glance and cried out, “We honor the Sect Master’s immortal decree!”

The white-templed elder’s face changed, but several hands grabbed his arms. The crowd surged, pushing him toward the main hall. Someone even sobbed, “Sect Master, your sacrifice is noble! Your family… the hundred souls of your clan… we will ensure the Daoist Master protects them! Please, rest assured!”

---

In the sky above, the brilliant white Celestial Gate blazed against the darkness, wreathed in roiling, colorful clouds. Beneath it, the brown and yellow divine ability struggled desperately, yet it could not budge the gate an inch. Each impact merely caused a bright white scroll hanging on the gate to sway gently, absorbing the force.

Li Zhouwei stood beneath his divine ability, the entire mountain sect below now blanketed in silver lightning. He waited quietly, forming a mudra over his heart and casually breathing wisps of black flame.

The small umbrella—brown and yellow, interwoven with gold and green—lay in his palm, pulsing with the glow of Wu Earth. Li Zhouwei weighed it for a moment, his assessment already complete.

‘As Spiritual Artifacts go, this is mid-tier,’ he mused. ‘It would be more potent in the hands of a Wu Earth cultivator. The Bright Yang Dao is not compatible with Wu Earth, so in my hands, it’s even weaker than a normal cultivator would find it. About on par with the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger.’

‘What a shame this fellow is another pauper. That spirit embryo is surely unusable. The only thing of value is this Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella. At least it has some trade value…’

As he pondered, he raised an eyebrow and spoke.

“Daoist Friend Qinghu.”

Only then did a middle-aged man materialize beside him. Dressed in a green scholar's robe with long sleeves, a gourd tied to his waist and a sword on his back, he appeared somewhat reserved. He quickly bowed. “Congratulations… congratulations, Your Highness!”

Si Yuanli had witnessed the entire battle. Though he had been prepared to intervene, he knew Cheng Yan wouldn’t last long. Still, his heart pounded with fear—Cheng Yan had been defeated far too quickly.

One had to remember that Cheng Yan cultivated Wu Earth. That dao lineage was renowned for its impenetrability, a reputation earned through the hard-fought victories of its practitioners. It gave them a unique advantage against immortal cultivators.

Even if Cheng Yan was incompetent, he was still a Wu Earth Purple Mansion Realm expert practicing Immortal Without Flaw. And though his was not the orthodox northern lineage—most Eastern Sea traditions were tainted by the demonic path—he was not someone an ordinary person could easily defeat.

‘He fell too easily… If the White Qilin wanted to kill me one day, how long would it take?’

A chill went through him. As he hesitated, preparing to speak, Li Zhouwei looked at him and raised an eyebrow. “Please.”

Si Yuanli hastily pushed his thoughts aside and nodded in understanding. In a flash, both their figures shifted, reappearing beneath the Celestial Gate.

The heat under the gate was immense, with violet flames surging violently. The headless body, its flesh gleaming like crystal, knelt within the inferno, clutching a brownish-yellow skull to its chest. It seemed oblivious as the purple flames licked across its dharma-body.

A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator’s vitality was incredibly tenacious, and Cheng Yan’s cultivation of the noble Wu Earth dao lineage only enhanced it. But brought so low, all he could do was struggle against the oppressive, grinding power of the Audience with the Celestial Gate.

“My lord… my lords!”

Cheng Yan’s headless body prostrated, revealing pinkish muscle and a section of gleaming white windpipe. His spirit was utterly broken. Filled with terror, he pleaded, “Your Highness… Changxiao was behind everything! I am but one man with a single divine ability. What power could I possibly have before a Great Daoist Master like him?!”

Li Zhouwei acted as if he hadn't heard. He reached into the flames and plucked out a bulging, golden storage pouch.

‘Since Changxiao left the immortal gate, he must have been prepared to sacrifice this place. There can’t be many Purple Mansion Realm treasures left in the Changxiao Gate… anything of value would be in Cheng Yan’s storage pouch.’

According to their prior agreement, its contents were to be split with Si Yuanli. Li Zhouwei tossed it forward, had Cheng Yan release the seal on it, and then with a flick of his finger, sent it soaring. Bound by Heavenly Light, it hung beside the scroll on the Celestial Gate, a clear sign that he had not touched it.

Cheng Yan had no mind for such things. After a brief pause, his voice filled with the rage and hatred of regret. “Changxiao… Changxiao… I was loyal to him, risking my life at every turn… He deceived me! He used me as a pledge of allegiance… Me, the entire Changxiao Gate, we were nothing but tools for him to declare his stance!”

Cheng Yan had been kept in the dark by Changxiao, fed a stream of false information. He hadn’t realized the truth even when the enemy was at his gates. But a short time under this divine ability had been enough for him to connect all the dots.

‘Changxiao… Changxiao has already chosen the north…’

But no matter how his hatred for Changxiao burned like the Eastern Sea, he could not afford to dwell on it. He spoke in a low, submissive tone.

“I have long since seen the error of my ways. Now that I have fallen into your hands… I beg only for my life!”

“My cultivation may not be high… but I am in the Purple Mansion Realm… I have no ambitions. I am willing to guard a territory for you, my lord… willing to be your dog, to serve you hand and foot…”

He humbled himself completely, not daring to reattach his head. The headless body knelt, its shoulders thudding against the divine ability’s barrier as he begged for his life.

“Heh…” Si Yuanli watched quietly and let out a cold laugh.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him with a smile. “Has Daoist Friend Qinghu come to plead for him?”

Si Yuanli shook his head, his voice tinged with melancholy. “It just reminds me… of a story from my clan’s history.”

“Oh?”

Li Zhouwei shot him a look. Si Yuanli smiled. “Once, in the Chu State… there was a sect called the Auxiliary Profound Gate. They took in a rogue Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the south, a Daoist Master Xiang Xiao, who also served to guard their territory. Unfortunately… the old Daoist Master of the Auxiliary Profound Gate fell in a great battle, and the sect found itself with a new master… His bloodline was completely extinguished…”

“This Auxiliary Profound Gate was also in Helin. Daoist Master Xiang Xiao had many descendants, which is why the noble families of Helin have such fine bloodlines! They’ve produced so many geniuses.”

His words were so blatant, a direct insinuation of Cheng Yan's origins, that the headless body lifted itself. The skull in its arms, enduring the humiliation, spoke in a low, obsequious voice, “My lord jests.”

“Then he must be killed,” Li Zhouwei said with a smile, but his tone was resolute.

Cheng Yan grit his teeth and finally cursed, “Sima Yuanli! Your family stole the Azure Pond from the Chi family, yet you dare speak of usurpation!”

Si Yuanli sneered. “The truth behind the Azure Pond is not something to be discussed lightly. But your affair of killing your brother-in-law and sleeping with your sister is quite well-known! And you took such good care of those bastard children, didn’t you, Daoist Friend Cheng Yan?”

Si Yuanli’s family history of usurpation was a known fact he didn't fear people mentioning, but Cheng Yan’s own deeds were far more disgraceful. The accusation struck him dumb. He trembled within the divine ability, his chest filled with rage, unable to raise or lower his head.

But Si Yuanli wasn't finished. He laughed. “You are a man without sense. If not for your incestuous affair and your demonic Earth Virtue practices, I believe my lord might have spared you. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator is hard to create but easy to kill. Having one serve the court is always a benefit!”

His words made Li Zhouwei’s eyes narrow slightly. Cheng Yan’s heart sank completely. The headless body trembled against the ground, and a grim voice emerged, “You… one from a northern aristocratic clan that has survived four dynasties, the other a descendant of the imperial clan, beloved of the Bright Yang. My ancestors were bound by the ethics your ancestors established, where every move was a transgression. Yet when brothers of the Bright Yang kill each other, when noble families treat lives like grass, your ethics turn a blind eye. Today… your Li Family purges the righteous, your Sima Family usurps without consequence. It’s only because one of you is named Li and the other is named Sima. How is that any different from the past?”

“I am a man of humble origins, doomed by your so-called ethics. What is there to say?”

Si Yuanli laughed loudly. “It seems I was right. In your eyes, your incestuous acts were the most righteous of all.”

Flesh began to grow back on Cheng Yan’s skull. His eyes blazed as he spat through clenched teeth, “Righteous? I have my own divine ability; I will not listen to your ethics! Sima Yuanli, you listen to me! You are nothing but a child. Do not think for a moment that this is a victory for the world’s ethics or morals. I die because of the political situation, not because of morality! Stop waving your moral banner! What good is your Sima Family?!”

Si Yuanli’s expression turned grim. He gave him a cool, detached look. But Li Zhouwei placed a hand on his shoulder and smiled. “Daoist Friend Qinghu, don’t push him to his death. I need to keep him alive to see if I can find Changxiao’s whereabouts.”

At these words, Si Yuanli paused, frowning in silence. Cheng Yan’s gaze turned icy. “Changxiao is cold and heartless. Why would he care about me?” he sneered.

Li Zhouwei replied calmly, “I have my ways.”

Two streams of divine ability shot out. Si Yuanli still looked confused. Li Zhouwei glanced at him, sighed inwardly, and said, “Daoist friend, you truly are a meticulous planner.”

Si Yuanli looked slightly awkward and shook his head. Li Zhouwei unfastened the dark gold halberd from his waist. “My dao lineage has no affinity for Wu Earth, and even less use for it. If you truly need it, Daoist friend, there’s no harm in leaving this fortune here. However… I want the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella.”

Even if Li Zhouwei hadn’t said anything, the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella was almost certainly his. By phrasing it this way, he was doing Si Yuanli a favor. Si Yuanli nodded repeatedly, showing no embarrassment at being found out. “Then I will trouble you, Daoist friend!”

The golden-eyed youth raised the halberd, glancing at the divine ability under his feet. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd, after many years, blazed brightly once more. Its intricate patterns trembled and then erupted with light.

Splitting Light!

The Celestial Gate abruptly lifted, releasing an endless, brilliant radiance. A massive, mountain-sized golden brilliance burst through the clouds, trailing a rainbow torrent as it crashed down. Cheng Yan’s horrified and enraged voice instantly ripped through the night sky. “Li Zhouwei… you!”

But his long-weakened Wu Earth radiance was fragile before this dazzling light. The halberd’s light paused for a mere instant before shattering it completely.

_BOOM!_

An even vaster radiance erupted from within the roiling thunderstorm. A powerful aura surged skyward, instantly dispelling the dark clouds and revealing a stunning Heavenly Glow that covered a thousand miles.

Countless streams of black light converged at a single point, rapidly spreading across the sky. A thick mist unfurled below, with heavenly light above and fog below. From between them, specks of black earth rained down.

On the ground, the Baleful Earth resonated. The earth roared, splitting open with deep abysses from which hidden baleful energies surged forth, mingling with stone, fire, and earth as they spread across the land.

The black flames in Li Zhouwei’s eyes grew more intense. The light from the Radiant Sun King's Halberd in his hand pulsed, brightening and dimming as if breathing in excitement.

‘The earth element shattered. Above, it formed mist and heavenly light; below, springs of baleful energy… Cheng Yan is finished.’

Si Yuanli looked on with his head lowered, unsurprised.

He and Li Zhouwei had discussed this earlier. As a figure of the new dynasty, Si Yuanli couldn't act rashly. Even lending a Spiritual Treasure was a risk. He had only agreed because of his clan’s excellent relationship with the Li Family in recent years, and his desire for this immortal mountain.

Si Yuanli’s earlier provocations were no mere squabble; they were entirely deliberate. He wanted Cheng Yan to die here and now, so the essence of his Wu Earth cultivation would descend upon this place, adding to the glory of his future mountain sect. Li Zhouwei naturally saw through his scheme. With both of them present and several Spiritual Treasures suppressing the area, Cheng Yan couldn’t have caused much trouble even if he had tried to commit suicide. But while his suicide would be a small matter, Li Zhouwei couldn’t afford to lose him.

He had come here with the intent to shatter this mountain and destroy this sect, all to cultivate his Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts. The Changxiao Gate, though not ancient, had a deep foundation and a resounding reputation—it was the perfect nourishment. With this tempering, the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts would become more than just a minor technique.

His entire plan was designed so the world would witness him capture Cheng Yan alive, then execute him before his own sect gate. The execution and the mountain’s destruction had to overlap. If Cheng Yan killed himself, where would the spectacle be? It was for this very reason that he had to placate Cheng Yan first, only to kill him personally.

‘Besides… since he was said to use demonic methods, perhaps killing him will grant me some immortal merit…’

Li Zhouwei stood amidst the rolling Heavenly Glow, watching the baleful energy roil through the mountains and the beasts flee in terror, a different thought taking root in his mind.

He knew he would have to face Wu Earth cultivators sooner or later, and his fight with Cheng Yan had been an invaluable observation. The gains were immense.

‘Wu Earth truly is flawless. Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light fared better, but my Emperor Qi's Light, being an auxiliary Bright Yang art, was significantly weakened when it struck the Wu Earth… the suppression was even more severe!’

He had sensed it the moment the enemy used his divine ability to block Emperor Qi's Light. He had immediately become vigilant, but understood the importance of timing. He had poured his dharma power in recklessly to overwhelm the opposing divine ability. It was fortunate that Cheng Yan’s courage had already failed him… otherwise, if the fight had dragged on, Emperor Qi's Light might not have been able to overcome his Wu Earth.

‘The Wei Emperor has been assailed for so many years… the Bright Yang has definitely been damaged. But since he hasn’t completely fallen from his position, the damage is internal and not yet externally visible… This deficit is especially apparent in the auxiliary arts. The day he is truly pulled down… both the primary and auxiliary arts will be suppressed by the Wu Earth’s Heavenly Glow.’

As he was thinking, he felt the spiritual energy in the world fluctuate, accompanied by a faint, distant boom. The black flames within him surged, and he knew that the Changxiao Gate below could hold out no longer. As expected, he heard Si Yuanli exclaim, “Eh?”

He glanced over, raised his hand, and the Stormshatter Wedges transformed back into streaks of silver light, returning to his palm. Si Yuanli offered his congratulations. “Congratulations, Your Highness!”

“And congratulations to you, Daoist friend.”

Li Zhouwei closed his eyes for a moment, not hurrying to descend. Black flames billowed from his body as he exhaled deeply, feeling the feedback from the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts. He held up the Grand Ascension, his halberd, and gave it a gentle toss.

The long halberd hovered above the sect gate, spewing jets of black flame. Only then did he pass through the Great Void and descend slowly into the Changxiao Gate’s domain.

The violent lightning storm receded, and the silver brilliance over Mount Changxiao finally faded, revealing the spiritually rich immortal mountain. The once colorful, elegant immortal pavilions and halls seemed to be coated in a layer of gray dust. Cultivators cowered on their knees between buildings and on stairways, not daring to move. Others took to the air, attempting to flee, while still others raised their dharma artifacts to fight the Li Family cultivators descending from the sky.

The four gleaming golden characters for "Changxiao of the Western Rite" on the jade gate at the mountain’s base were now dull and lifeless. The golden-eyed youth paused before the gate, and roiling black flames instantly erupted from thin air, sweeping up the stairs.

He walked up the mountain step by step. Where he passed, Heavenly Light blazed and black flames surged. The trees were unharmed, but the pavilions collapsed one by one. The cultivators who were still resisting were engulfed by the black flames, which clung to them like talismans before they exploded with a deafening boom.

Rows of warriors in white armor marched in, moving methodically through the various pavilions and terraces, rounding up the ashen-faced and bewildered members of the Changxiao Gate. The only sounds on the mountain were the clash of armor and soft weeping.

By the time the youth reached the summit, the entire sect was in ruins and had been pacified. A torrent of invisible black flame shot into the sky. Li Minggong stood silently at his side, casting a cold gaze upon the people gathered on the peak.

“We pay our respects to you, my lord!”

The summit was still in chaos, but the Changxiao Gate cultivators who had opened the formation had already established preliminary control. The white-templed elder was held down by two peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, forced to kneel at his feet. A man in black robes beside them didn’t dare to look at him, shuffling forward on his knees and saying respectfully, “My lord… the sect master of the Changxiao Gate, this white-templed elder, is here!”

Li Zhouwei’s gaze fell upon him, recognizing the old man at once. He scanned the surroundings, but before he could speak, the man in black robes raised an eyebrow and ordered his men to push open the doors of the great hall behind them. “The white-templed elder’s mortal family… is in the Prefecture. His disciples who cultivated on the mountain are all here!”

Inside the hall, five cultivators were bound, their six senses sealed. They lay on the floor like corpses and were dragged forward and thrown to the ground.

“Helin Prefecture has already surrendered to the righteous path! He has clan members in the Prefecture as well. Please, my lord, give us a chance to identify them all, so that we may hunt them down and ensure the wicked are brought to justice!”

At these words, the white-templed elder began to sob and looked up with furious eyes, meeting the golden gaze directly. Before he could utter a curse, black flames erupted from his ears and nose. He writhed on the ground, his body emitting plumes of black smoke, but a divine ability kept him alive, denying him even the release of death.

In an instant, his horrific screams filled the mountain. The crowd lowered their heads in terror. The crackling of the flames seemed to grow louder as the Daoist Master said calmly, “There are others.”

When he was besieged at Lake Xian, there were six of them. Yunan Zi was slain by him, the Daoist from the Zhuang clan was killed by his gaze in the market just now, and the white-templed elder was here. That left three more.

But the man in black robes was prepared. Another old man was immediately dragged from the crowd and thrown down before him. Not daring to look up, the man in black said quickly, “My lord, there were three others that day. One was killed overseas, and another perished while attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Only this old fool remains, having made no progress… still clinging to life here!”

The old man’s eyes were filled with despair. Before he could speak, the Daoist Master before him gently parted his lips and blew out a breath of purple flame, incinerating the old man to ash. Only then did the Daoist Master step past the screaming white-templed elder and look at Li Minggong, his voice somewhat hoarse.

“That day, I borrowed an ancestor’s treasured sword. The sword was drawn, yet it could not kill. It was a great disrespect. Take this man back to the lake and execute him before the sword to appease our ancestor’s spirit.”

“Yes!” Li Minggong bowed, a hint of joy touching her lips. Her eyes still held a look of disbelieving horror, and she too did not dare to look directly at him.

Li Zhouwei then turned his gaze to the man in black robes.

The man immediately began to kowtow, tears streaming down his face. “My lord… my lord… my name is Wu Fan, a native of Jingchuan… I was brought here to cultivate as a child. I have heard of your mighty reputation!”

He raised his hands, presenting a grayish-white token, about a foot long and carved with swirling clouds. He cried out, “This is the secret command token of the Changxiao Gate’s sect master… a treasure of the lineage, presented to you, my lord!”

He was terrified, yet his chest swelled with greedy delight. He felt the token leave his palm. When no sound followed for a long moment, he cautiously raised his head.

The man before him stood amidst surging black flames. It might have been an illusion, but the lord seemed taller than when he had arrived. He stood like a colossus, his face covered in golden patterns looking down. Wu Fan, prostrate on the ground, felt as though he couldn't even reach the man’s knee.

Those golden eyes narrowed, the black flames within them raging. The claw-like hand slowly tightened, and a powder-like silver light trickled from between his fingers. His shadow fell over everyone.

“Where are the sect’s spiritual and Daoist treasuries?”
