# Chapter 1255: The Powers of Luoxia

A multicolored light rose from the mountain as his resonant words gave Li Ximing pause, a hint of anxiety appearing in his eyes. He said in a low voice,

"But… this pill still needs more time to temper…"

He was pointing at the golden cauldron suspended in mid-air, wreathed in rising flames.

"For this Pure Essence pill, Ji An used his life's savings; its medicinal power is truly profound and boundless. I borrowed the marvels of a spiritual fire to slowly nurture and refine it, but it isn't yet time to retrieve the pill!"

Li Zhouwei, however, revealed a meaningful expression.

"This is fine as well."

He stood with his hands clasped behind his back and began to walk slowly, speaking softly.

"This Dangwood Molten Fire is a treasure for nurturing with molten fire and also possesses healing properties."

"If the refinement finished early, the fire would have to be returned; with this great war upon us, it's better that it remains on the mountain."

Li Ximing nodded at once.

'If anything happens in the north, we'll need this fire for anyone who returns wounded.'

Li Zhouwei continued, "With grand-uncle staying here, he will have someone to look after him…"

The words were not explicit, but Li Ximing understood instantly.

'To march on Luoxia, we must commit every divine ability from the lake, leaving only myself and Jiangqian, who is in seclusion. If some accident were to happen—if Western Shu could still act, or if the north had some surprise attack that threatened the lake…'

'Then we would have no choice but to rely on Ji An!'

Li Ximing had always intended to keep him out of it, but at this point, if the worst came to pass, Ji An would have to act whether Li Ximing wished it or not.

'He's about to become a Great Daoist Master himself. If something truly happened and his pill was successfully refined, he could flee overseas. They wouldn't pursue him to the death… at worst, we could compensate him somehow…'

Li Ximing nodded silently. Before Li Zhouwei could say more, a streak of light shot over and stopped in the Great Void, a steady voice announcing,

"Kuang Hong requests an audience!"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, but Li Ximing's face lit up with a smile.

"Perfect timing. I wanted you to meet him… he returned not long ago. He's a true talent. The current Dawn Qi path has some methods for achieving Cultivation Transcendence, so he has been cultivating in the great desert!"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"Given the state of Dawn Qi today… that's not surprising."

Seeing King Wei nod, Li Ximing smiled.

"Please, come in!"

A flow of colors streamed through the sky, descended to the ground, and coalesced into a Daoist Master. He had thick eyebrows and a rather sharp aura, yet a faint melancholy lingered deep in his eyes. He took a step forward, about to speak, when he suddenly froze in place.

His reflection of that point of gold trembled violently in his deep blue pupils. He gathered his robes, strode forward, and fell to his knees, his voice a mixture of shock and joy.

"Greetings… King Wei!"

Yin Juexi had imagined the scene of his meeting with this King Wei, but he had never thought it would be such a sudden encounter on this small mountain. For a moment, he was at a loss for words, merely lowering his head and saying solemnly, 

"Congratulations, King Wei!"

Li Ximing watched him with a smile, clearly quite pleased with this Daoist Master, while Li Zhouwei looked on with some curiosity.

"Rise."

Kuang Hong stood, his gaze fixed upon him, his lips parting to speak several times, but this King Wei spoke in a rather amicable tone.

"I've already heard of your affairs—Can Lufu, is it not?"

Kuang Hong said in a low voice, "King Wei… your subordinate…"

A hint of unease crept into his expression. He first bowed deeply, then raised his head, his resolute features overflowing with hatred.

"Your subordinate… has a matter to report!"

Although the black-robed youth before him had a gentle face, his gaze carried a sharp intensity. He turned his head slightly.

"Speak."

Kuang Hong lowered his voice.

"Your subordinate just received this news and was about to report it to Senior Zhaojing… Several days ago, the Southern Borderlands were wracked by continuous torrential rains, a viridian light shot into the sky, the waters overflowed, and a Demon King was slain…"

"That Can Lufu, tired of his tranquility, made a move—as expected, his divine abilities are perfected, his five methods at their zenith!"

"Him?"

Li Ximing could only sigh upon hearing this, frowning as he gritted his teeth. 

"That's right… counting the days, two hundred years have passed. No matter how difficult this final step was, he should have made a move by now! It can't be five paths of Pristine Water, can it?!"

Kuang Hong lowered his gaze, concealing the hatred in his eyes.

"Over the years, the various families have speculated much. He likely completed his final path long ago but simply held back. They thought he was approaching the zenith of five methods and preparing for his Quest for Gold, but no one expected this day to come so soon. However… according to Martial Uncle's deduction, it definitely is not 'Pristine Water'… firstly, there was no spiritual qi… and secondly…"

The Daoist Master lowered his head and said coldly, "Martial Uncle said, 'He wouldn't dare.'"

The implication was obvious. Li Ximing stroked his beard.

"Is it because of… that person from the Azure Pond?"

Kuang Hong nodded and said somberly, "Yes… Martial Uncle said that if he cultivated five paths of Pristine Water, he would have to go and see the scenery of the Pristine Merging Owl Pool."

The prowess of that True Monarch of Grand Purity was known even to the cultivators overseas, let alone the Li family that had grown up under the Azure Pond's governance. Li Ximing's brow furrowed tightly for a moment.

"He won't immediately attempt the Quest for Gold, will he?"

Kuang Hong kept his head lowered.

"From the looks of it, seeing that Suiguan is ignoring him, he's now preparing to clean up the Southern Borderlands. He excels at alchemy and has likely planted many seeds over the years. Now he intends to harvest them one by one, seeking his opportunity for seeking the Dao… but he doesn't have a method for the Quest for Gold, nor will he ever have one…"

"That old fiend is cautious and should have a great deal of longevity left. He won't try until he's absolutely certain, so this process might take a very long time."

As an Alchemist himself, Li Ximing naturally understood the trouble involved. He breathed a sigh of relief and sneered, "Good!"

Kuang Hong raised his head slightly, only to find that King Wei had been looking down at him all along, a smile in his eyes.

"Not bad at all."

His tone was cold.

"I'm not afraid of his divine abilities being perfected, but I was afraid he'd take a reckless gamble and get killed by Suiguan."

Li Zhouwei knew many secrets; Li Que'wan had obtained a great deal of information from the Golden Feather Sect back then. He had a rough estimate in his mind: if this old Flood Dragon was on a similar path to Chi Buzi, then he was merely making preparations now!

He said quietly, "Just before he perfects his divine abilities and thinks his Quest for Gold is within reach, we will strike, shatter his cultivation, and offer it to our ancestors. Let him watch as he is unable to take that final step, dying as his calamity descends."

Li Ximing's eyes gleamed, and a glimmer of light finally appeared in Kuang Hong's somber gaze. The Daoist Master said not another word, instead performing a grand salute and saying respectfully,

"I am willing to be the vanguard for Your Majesty."

…

A dark wind swept through.

'Moongaze Lake…'

The Great Void trembled as a man in black robes arrived on the wind. He gazed down at the glittering surface of the lake below, a peculiar look in his eyes.

'So I've come to this place…'

Facing this great lake, a place akin to a forbidden land, Yang Ruiyi couldn't help but feel a mix of complex emotions.

The legendary Moongaze Lake was considered a first-rate perilous land even in the eyes of the Underworld. It was suppressed by an Immortal Artifact and protected by an immortal formation; with a Dao Embryo and a True Monarch guarding it, it was enough to defy the world!

'The foundation of the Three Profoundities is not to be underestimated. Although Comprehending Profoundity is powerful, the other two are not to be trifled with by anyone in the world! Not even a remnant of them…'

This wasn't just Yang Ruiyi's or the Yang family's opinion, but a common understanding—the Three Profoundities were still the Three Profoundities, no matter their rise or fall. Even the Dragon-kin had to use the prophecies of Azure Profoundity for shelter.

It was for this reason that Yang Ruiyi, facing this great lake that even his own Judge Yang dared not set foot upon, couldn't help but feel a sense of lament. With a somber expression, he followed the aura, and soon, the great mountain with flames soaring to the heavens appeared before him.

'Gardenia Scenery Mountain.'

Yang Ruiyi had only paused for a moment when a vermilion wind swept out, taking a human form nearby. She was a woman, quite beautiful with red lips and white teeth. 

She performed a salute and said politely, "Greetings, General Yang!"

Yang Ruiyi glanced at her, sensed the aura of her divine abilities, and nodded.

"You must be Suyun. A first-rate genius indeed!"

Li Que'wan smiled without a word, leading him up the mountain. They passed through a mountain path where white flowers danced in the air, and soon, jade pillars began to rise, the heavenly light growing scorching. Yang Ruiyi ascended the steps and quickly saw the figure in black robes with golden pupils.

The man's brow shone, the Sun-Surging Governing Stars radiating a multicolored luster as he sat in the twilight of the setting sun. Standing on the mountain's peak, he seemed to be the source of all the boundless heavenly light!

'Li Zhouwei…'

'His injuries have healed.'

The news wasn't surprising, but seeing it with his own eyes, Yang Ruiyi still felt a sense of shock.

'The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth, resolved just like that… for a Bright Yang cultivator who was already severely injured when afflicted…'

In the next moment, he sensed that something was off.

'His divine abilities are powerful, yet they are agitated and unstable. His dharma body is radiant, but it bears traces of damage… he hasn't fully recovered!'

Yang Ruiyi nodded to himself.

'Still, this is already fast enough. He is King Wei, the White Qilin. As long as the calamity is resolved, the severity of his injuries is not the main issue… fighting while he recuperates is the best way to seize the opportune moment for battle!'

And beside this King Wei was, of course, Daoist Master Zhaojing. Yang Ruiyi's gaze quickly swept past him and landed on Daoist Master Kuang Hong to the side, a flash of surprise crossing his eyes.

'It's that… one from the Yin family… impressive.'

He quickly raised his brow and smiled.

"Congratulations, King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei turned his gaze, and the heavenly light of the entire mountain shifted with him. Yang Ruiyi, having cultivated 'Untraceable Presence', concealed his aura completely, appearing no different from a minor cultivator.

"There is nothing to celebrate about healing. The Grand General crossing the Purple Mystery threshold, now that is a joyous occasion worth celebrating!"

Although Li Zhouwei's words were calm, their meaning was clear. Even for someone like Yang Ruiyi from the Underworld, a valued member of the Yang Clan, crossing the Purple Mystery threshold was a major event—once this threshold was passed, with the Yang Clan's support, he would lack neither resources nor Dao legacies. The perfection of his divine abilities was a foregone conclusion!

Not to mention, these words came from Li Zhouwei himself.

Yang Ruiyi was quite pleased inwardly, but his face only showed a slight smile as he shook his head.

"King Wei overstates it."

He sighed.

"In less than fifteen years, King Wei will surely cross the Purple Mystery threshold. You might even perfect your divine abilities before I do!"

Li Zhouwei chuckled and shook his head, saying grimly,

"The Grand General is mistaken. With conflict brewing between north and south and many disputes arising, how could the northern cultivators sit by and watch my rise? It wouldn't take much, just one or two major battles like the one at Lake Xian, and I'd be tied down for thirty years!"

A cold glint flashed in his eyes.

"I must seize the initiative and attack Luoxia!"

Yang Ruiyi understood he was speaking the truth and had long known of the Song Emperor's tacit approval. He lowered his head in silence, comprehending his line of thought.

Luoxia was home to numerous great families, rich not only in spiritual qi and resources but also in Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. In the past, they had relied on the intervention of Profound Governance to remain uninvolved, but now that the Profound Governance Pavilion had withdrawn in defeat, the Purple Mansion cultivators of Luoxia would inevitably be drawn into any major conflict.

'He wants to catch the north off guard, take Luoxia in one fell swoop, and force the great families to side with the south. It's as they say: supplies taken from the enemy are worth twenty times our own. With them weakened and us strengthened, only then can he gain enough breathing room in the coming struggle between north and south.'

One must know that the Great Song had the light of Martial Cultivation—if these Purple Mansion cultivators sided with the south, they would never again have the leeway they enjoyed in the north. Even if Luoxia were lost, these Purple Mansion clans would have to follow them back to the south, whether they migrated as entire clans or fled south alone!

'These people can enhance the divine might of our Great Song. Once placed in Jianghuai, they can also defend against the north with unwavering resolve, mitigating the threat to his Li Clan. On the other hand, His Majesty has received his grace of Martial Cultivation, and in return, will shield the Li Clan when he breaks through to the Purple Mystery threshold…'

Even if Yang Ruiyi didn't know what agreement the King Wei before him had reached with his own Emperor, they were all intelligent people. With a little deduction, he could figure out fifty or sixty percent of it.

'Yes, he is Li Zhouwei, the beloved of Bright Yang, and the great battle where he slew Vast Cicada is proof enough of his Daoist wisdom. Given time, he will certainly reach the realm of perfected divine abilities, but he is too young! Unless he is the reincarnation of Emperor Wei, the chance of him crossing the Purple Mystery threshold in a single attempt is pitifully low!'

'Yet for Li Zhouwei… whether he can cross that threshold depends not only on his own ability but also on the balance of the overall situation—Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan are no longer mere Foundation Establishment cultivators. They cannot hide on the lake forever. If they are trapped in a desperate, isolated situation, they could truly perish!'

Only by understanding this point could one understand why Li Zhouwei, having just resolved his calamity, was determined to emerge from seclusion while still injured!

'This is his fleeting battle opportunity. The faster, the better, and the more significant the results, the better!'

His expression turned grave, and he said softly,

"This too is a struggle for the Dao…"

Li Zhouwei stared at him for a moment, as if judging his thoughts, then said quietly,

"Grand General, this is not my struggle for the Dao alone."

Yang Ruiyi was momentarily speechless.

He was right.

Now that the Song Emperor intended to move the capital, the importance of Jianghuai had skyrocketed. The problem facing the Li Clan had also fallen upon the Yang family. The Purple Mansion clans of Luoxia had likewise become a prize the Yang family was determined to win. At least for this moment, Yang Ruiyi and the Yang Clan stood completely on the same battlefront with him!

This was the sincerity shown by Yang Ruiyi, a direct descendant of the Yang Clan, venturing deep into Moongaze Lake.

The Great Daoist Master's expression was complex. He sighed.

"King Wei is right… we must not delay."

He flicked his finger lightly, and a point of dark light fell, like a drop of ink on a tabletop. It rippled silently outwards, transforming into a scroll map. Upon it, mountains and rivers undulated, waters shimmered, and one could even see the colored light of rising formations!

It was a map of Luoxia.

Yang Ruiyi said softly, "In the past, the center of the world was Guzhou Prefecture in Yuzhou, which is now Luoying of Northern Zhao, northeast of the Luoxia Plain. It was only after the divine continent sank that the current Luoxia became the world's center."

At the mention of Guzhou Prefecture, the corner of his mouth curved up slightly. Li Ximing also turned his head, a thoughtful look on his face.

'Guzhou Prefecture… the Guzhou Cauldron…'

But Yang Ruiyi was unwilling to dwell on the topic. His expression turned solemn.

"This place is connected to Mount Xiao in the west, linking to the gateway of Jingzhao, Zanmen. To the north, it reaches Mianchi and Huan Prefecture. The east is a thousand leagues of fertile land. Once this place is taken, with Tangjin at its back, it would not be difficult to defend if we occupy the strategic points…"

Li Zhouwei glanced at the map, taking in the entire topography of Luoxia.

If one had to describe it, this place was truly a land of constant warfare. The north pressed against the capital of the Zhao State, and the so-called Zanmen connecting to Mount Xiao was certainly impregnable. In contrast, if Northern Zhao wanted to harass this area, they could come and go as they pleased…

And beyond Mianchi and Huan Prefecture to the north, after just a few prefectures, was the territory of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm!

'Although there's still a Mount Liangchuan to the north for defense, in terms of geopolitics, that's already two formidable enemies!'

To the east was a vast plain with no natural defenses. The only good thing was that the master of this land was the Lotus Temple, which had always been unwilling to contend with the Great Song…

Li Zhouwei took only one look and shook his head directly.

"The Grand General is mistaken. If we could take both Zanmen and Mount Liangchuan simultaneously, it would be a suitable place to defend. But is Zanmen a place you and I can touch right now? If it were so easily taken, the unification of the north wouldn't have repeatedly hit a wall here…"

"Without Zanmen, leaving only Mount Liangchuan, we would be better off not defending at all if attacked from both sides!"

Yang Ruiyi nodded naturally.

"King Wei sees clearly. This expedition… cannot be for the purpose of long-term occupation."

Li Zhouwei nodded lightly.

"The main goal is to raid. As long as we can occupy it for a few years, move the clans and common people south to populate Jianghuai, it will be considered a success."

Having finished his probing, Yang Ruiyi secretly breathed a sigh of relief and nodded in agreement.

He was truly afraid that this King Wei, trusting in his Mandate of Heaven, would emulate Qing Jifang and attack Mount Xiao in an attempt to capture Zanmen. Whether it could be taken or not was another matter, but if it were, the fall of Northern Zhao could be counted in days. Just as if his own Great Song's capital were attacked, the counterattack would be absolutely hysterical!

With that, his mood lightened considerably, and he said seriously,

"Luoxia was once very famous, but it has declined. It can be roughly divided into five areas and seven families. The most central, most valuable, and most defenseless… is Yinling, home to the Tao Clan…"

He brought this family up first, his expression quite solemn, even glancing toward Li Ximing at his side.

"As one of the few places where great families reside, those who can remain in Luoxia mostly have some background. Though they've fallen on hard times now, it's best not to be too harsh…"

"This Tao Clan is a prime example. They have cultivated the Three Yin for generations, their ancestors studied under the Guanhua Daoist tradition, and they have connections with many influential figures… They currently have the most Purple Mansion cultivators, a total of three! The highest among them is at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm."

He paused slightly.

"Ruzhou to the east is the largest, mainly occupied by the Yu and Yang Clans… these two are somewhat special. They were originally great clans of the Chu State but were on the losing side of the struggle when Great Chu fell and thus fled to the north to settle down."

"The two clans are not on the best of terms. Each has one Purple Mansion cultivator. The Yang Clan has some connection with the Chen State, with their main family in that Veiled Yin Kingdom. The Yu Clan's mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator… is old and close to perishing, with no successor. They are in a precarious situation."

As soon as these words fell, Li Zhouwei knew what he meant.

'In that case, they will inevitably rely on Martial Cultivation, just like the Chen Clan!'

After speaking, Yang Ruiyi's tone softened considerably.

"The remaining Ju Clan of Liangchuan at the northern gateway and the Qiao Clan of Boye in the west have both declined. Their divine abilities are lacking, not worth worrying about. In Xiangxiang to the south, the Jia and Wei families have intermarried for many years… although they have one with divine abilities, he's nothing special…"

His tone was slightly odd as he said,

"The great battle of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in Luoxia was fought right there, and those two families didn't dare make a peep, just kept their heads down and hid."

After listening for a while, Li Ximing praised,

"Impressive… there are six Purple Mansion cultivators in this region! This land isn't even a third the size of Jianghuai, yet it can support such divine abilities. No wonder it was the center of the world!"

At this point, Yang Ruiyi's expression grew a little serious.

"But these are not the real trouble. Great Zhao is very wary of our south. They have two generals stationed in Xiangxiang, both of whom are talents. One is Jiang Fuwang of the Jiang Clan, and the other is Lu Fu of the Lu Clan. Although both are at the second level of divine abilities, they are Daoist Masters from Guzhou Prefecture!"

"And the one who nominally commands the forces of Luoxia… is Jiang Fuwang's nephew, the Divine Might General, Jiang Yan."

As he said this, his brow furrowed, and he sighed.

Yang Ruiyi did not underestimate this man; quite the contrary, as a direct descendant of the Yang Clan, his knowledge of the outside world was more comprehensive, and he was well aware of how astonishing Jiang Yan's achievements were in that war.

He reminded him solemnly, "This man's background is extraordinary, and his surprise attack back then was stunning. Although it can't compare to King Wei slaying Vast Cicada in battle, it still dropped many jaws. If you underestimate him, you risk being countered!"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow.

"What divine ability does this man cultivate?"

Yang Ruiyi's expression gradually became serious.

"Returning Earth."

Li Zhouwei's expression flickered. Li Ximing, on the other hand, was left somewhat speechless hearing of so many powerful individuals.

He whispered, "The north's resources are so abundant, to this extent? Such a small area is guarded by so many with divine abilities!"

Yang Ruiyi gave a helpless smile.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, don't just look at how large the north is. The division is very clear. Vast, barren lands have fallen into the hands of the Buddhist cultivators, while a few large prefectures are controlled by immortal cultivators. If Guzhou Prefecture is the first among the north's immortal cultivators, then the Luoxia Plain is the second. And this is the lowest number of Daoist Masters Luoxia's families have had in several hundred years, after a few recent deaths!"

"It's not that many."

Li Que'wan, however, did not seem surprised, nodding lightly.

"They are all descendants of Golden Core cultivators, but all of them together still couldn't stop a single Golden Feather Sect."

Hearing this, Yang Ruiyi sneered.

"Counting back through the great families of the world, who doesn't have a few illustrious ancestors? Without a Golden Core master presiding, a day will always come when their divine abilities fail. It's hard enough to preserve relations, let alone preserve their honor!"

Li Zhouwei kept his gaze fixed on the map and said softly,

"So… Jiang Yan is the main commander, along with two mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators from the Tao and Yu Clans, four early-stage Purple Mansion cultivators from the other families, plus… two heirs from the great families of Guzhou Prefecture…"

After calculating in his mind, he couldn't help but shake his head.

'If Jiang Yan is present, he can temporarily hold me off. Taking this place will be quite difficult! This really is the best opportunity!'

Of course, he would not underestimate this person. Or rather, after campaigning for so many years, Li Zhouwei had yet to underestimate a single opponent. He was like a lion hunting a rabbit, always using his full strength. Unless absolutely necessary, he would never take risks when he could crush his foe with overwhelming power.

'Besides, even Suining mentioned him…'

But with this man absent, the situation was completely different!

'My family can also mobilize quite a few with divine abilities!'

'Even if the two mid-stage cultivators from the Tao and Yu Clans attack together, they may not be my match. And Cui Jueyin, Cheng Qian, Kuang Hong, and Li Wushao, with their combined strength, are more than enough to hold off those early-stage Purple Mansion cultivators. The remaining Que'wan and Daoist Master Yuanbian can keep Jiang Fuwang and Lu Fu occupied without a problem!'

And even then, Li Ximing and Li Jiangqian were still standing guard on the lake!

Color coalesced in his eyes.

'Without even realizing it, the power of my Moongaze Lake alone is already enough to flatten Luoxia!'

But that wasn't all. Li Zhouwei's plan became even clearer in his mind.

'In this expedition, we have the element of surprise. As long as we are fast enough and our arrangements are stable, we can first take down Jiang Fuwang and Lu Fu. Those local great families, especially the Yu family that the Yang Clan emphasized, will likely put up little resistance!'
