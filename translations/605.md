# Chapter 949: Entering The Abyss

Eastern Sea.

Pine winds stirred across Splitreed Island as Li Xizhi changed into white robes and quietly sat by the table. No one else was around, leaving an uncanny silence, with only the moonlight spilling across the table.

The man held a jade wine pot as he paced around the table, never taking a seat.

His wife, Yang Xiao’er, had entered seclusion two years ago to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. There had been no news since, and he often worried. Soon, he received word that Li Xijun had perished in the Eastern Sea while trying to seize the Radiant Sky Stone.

Upon hearing the news, Li Xizhi had collapsed into the inner hall, weeping bitterly, unable to calm himself for a long time. Even after several years, he still often recalled the incident.

“Jun’er.”

Li Xizhi poured himself a cup of wine, filling the one across the table as well, his heart a tangled mess of emotions. Li Xizhi had returned home several times, and each time, Li Xijun had spoken with him at length. He had always been calm, and after receiving the talisman qi, had grown even more emotionless.

“Brother Xicheng gained his position and felt uneasy, and Ximing was too soft and full of guilt. But was Jun’er any better? He first exposed Ximing, then questioned Xicheng, and even eliminated threats by sending Yuexiang away... his heart was the heaviest with dread.

“What a tangled mess... how could it ever be unraveled!”

Among all the entanglements of the Li Family, it was Li Xizhi, an outsider to their internal strife, who saw things the clearest and knew the most.

Now, pouring wine on the ground, he muttered, “Grandfather always said the four Xi’s were bound by affection... but how could mere affection explain it all? When kinship isn’t enough, resentment and guilt cannot be resolved. When hatred isn’t enough, envy and dread cannot be shown... all of it was to perfect a single divine art.”

He poured three cups onto the ground, bowed deeply, then packed away the pot and cups. Collecting all his emotions, he stepped out calmly.

As he emerged from the woods, Li Wushao approached. The old demonic creature had already reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. As his state of mind transformed, the youthful form he had first assumed gradually faded.

Wrinkles lined his stern face as he bowed and said, “Young Master!”

Li Xizhi took the letter from him, glanced over it, and turned to ask, “Wushao, how effective were the Flower of Mu Sea[1] and the Spiritual Uplift Pill?”

Though Li Wushao was in the late Foundation Establishment Realm, his combat strength was lacking. Even a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm disciple of exalted immortal sects could likely handle him, which was clearly insufficient.

So Li Xizhi had specially invited two alchemists to Splitreed Island to examine the matter. Both were senior experts who had seen many spirit beasts, and after a careful look, they were somewhat surprised.

“This beast may lack mystical prowess, but its bloodline is quite unusual. Its ancestors likely cultivated or consumed some Azure Manifestation type spirit herb. This is truly a potent tonic!

“If this beast is used as furnace material, it would certainly produce an excellent batch of Essence Gathering Pills!”

Li Wushao was stunned, and his eyes filled with both suspicion and menace. Only after Li Xizhi explained in detail did the two alchemists realize he merely wanted pills to boost strength.

They agreed readily, though still expressed some regret, “Sir, you truly don’t wish to refine an Essence Gathering Pill? This demonic creature is premium material. If we reinforce its foundation first, its essence will lose some of its flavor.”

The old snake’s face had gone foul. Li Xizhi could only send the alchemists off with a wry smile, though his thoughts had begun to stir, Wushao was born a black-scaled hooked serpent and his bloodline was far from impressive. Perhaps the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique is starting to show some benefit, having reinforced him so many times.

Using Supreme Yin Moonlight to match one’s life essence would be seen as extravagant even by the most illustrious families. No wonder the alchemists had called it a supreme tonic. So he specially found a good spirit item, refined a pill, and gave it to Li Wushao.

Li Wushao slowly transformed in front of him. Inky black scales surfaced across his body, and his eyes turned pitch-black as he spoke in a deep hum, “This subordinate cultivates the Mansion Water system’s Morning Cold Rain. Its effects have grown even more refined, so I can now manipulate Inferior Water and suppress spirit wind...”

He displayed his various mystical abilities, and Li Xizhi watched silently, hesitating to speak, before softly saying, “Excellent. I’ll fetch you more spell arts when I have the chance. It will surely make you even stronger.”

The corners of Li Wushao’s mouth twitched. He bowed in gratitude, and thought inwardly, Just what kind of people are the Li Family? Forget that sword immortal, take even Li Xuanfeng. One arrow from that brute and no matter what spell you have, you’ll be down and crying for your mother... And now the young master’s cultivation grows deeper by the day, to the point of being unfathomable... There’s still the heir, and Qinghong...

But Li Xizhi didn’t care what he was thinking. He glanced through the report in his hand, let out a faint chuckle, and shook his head. “Truly interesting... I thought Ning Hejing wouldn’t be able to hold back, yet he turned out to be unexpectedly well-behaved! Instead, it was Chi Fubo who struck fast and viciously, seizing the initiative and pulling him right out of position!”

Li Wushao couldn’t help but smile, and asked quietly, “Is their internal strife good for us?”

“Good?!” Li Xizhi shook his head and said with a touch of sarcasm, “How could that be good? These people aren’t fools. With such a major threat looming... would they really start tearing into each other so recklessly? Hmm? Everyone knows the saying. The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.”

He reviewed all the position changes and smiled. “Rather than a fight, it’s more of a compromise. Ning Hejing did lose the position of Peak Master of Yuanxing Peak, but all his trusted subordinates are still sitting pretty up there... how outrageous.”

Li Wushao read through the list twice. The dense rows of names made his head spin, and he cursed in his heart, Damn it... humans really are cunning! Just fight it out already, why all the scheming and trickery?

Still, though cursing inwardly, he humbly asked, “So are the Ning and Chi Families scheming against us?”

“Not exactly.” Li Xizhi shook his head and said with a smile, “They really did tear into each other, but everyone came out satisfied after the fight. It was all a trade of interests. Ning Hejing, that heavyweight sect master faction, stepped down from the peak, but he was given an even better post elsewhere.

“The Chi Family lacks manpower, so they naturally wouldn’t fall out with the Ning Family. Leaving those people on the peak gives them support, weakens the Ning faction, and helps appease Ning Hejing’s mood...”

Li Wushao pondered a while and asked, “Where’s he going?”

“Where?” Li Xizhi casually pointed at the bamboo grove behind him. “Of course, he’s being sent to the Eastern Sea. No matter which side loses, they’d take over my position here. Isn’t that perfect for everyone? Ning Hejing is fierce but lacks cunning. He’s definitely the one coming.

“First, it gets that eyesore out of the sect; second, it puts him in control of one of the two key seas. As long as Chi Xuxiao gives the order, how could Ning Hejing disobey? Once in the Eastern Sea, he’ll be busy cracking down and purging opposition, so he won’t have time to meddle with sect politics. All that infighting just weakens the Si Family and strengthens his own.”

Li Wushao remained quiet for a while, then murmured, “And Lord Si? Would he really stand by and do nothing...”

“The Eastern Sea has long been marked as one to be given up.” Li Xizhi sighed, a touch of regret in his voice as he said, “It’s just a shame about this bamboo grove. That guy loves planting iron pillars everywhere, so this whole mountain will soon look like a porcupine. I doubt it’ll survive...”

1. The raw 穆(Mu) 海(Hai) is the same words used for the character Muhai that appeared in previous chapters. But in this context it should be the name of a sea because 海(Hai) actually means sea. ☜

Knowing Li Xizhi had plans, Li Wushao spoke softly, “What should we do now...”

“Mm...” Li Xizhi said softly, “Let’s head into the island’s abyss under the pretense of inspection before the official order arrives... We’ll toss the whole situation to that guy and focus on treasure hunting before we leave.”

A gleam of rainbow light rose and fell from his hand as he mused inwardly, As long as the order doesn’t arrive, I can use this excuse to dodge everything. Both sides will accept it. As for those messy, incomplete records... naturally they’ll be left for Lord Ning. He’s got talent, surely he can sort them out even without assistants.

After a brief moment of thought, Li Xizhi swiftly wrote two letters and sent them home. Without delay, he tidied up his cave dwelling and left without looking back.

He stepped out, left a letter for his subordinates, and rode the wind with the old demon to the center of the island . There, a great abyss opened up, its exposed cliff walls glowing a crimson red. Several golden-robed cultivators stood before the chasm.

The group all bowed in greeting. Li Xizhi spoke gently, “So today is the day the Golden Feather Sect reinforces this place. I wish to enter for investigation; may I trouble you to open the formation?”

The Golden Feather Sect had always maintained a lukewarm relationship with the Azure Pond Sect. Yet these men treated him with surprising warmth, calling him 'Daoist' as they brought out a map.

They smiled as they told him, “The earth veins have shifted slightly in recent months. Perhaps one of the Three Monarchs of Lesser Yang grew temperamental or went visiting a fellow cultivator. Daoist, do be cautious.”

The abyss on Splitreed Island had formed when a Demon Monarch had been split into three. Various forces had mixed, which corrupted the earth veins with wicked energy. Yet Falling Water Rising Storm had little impact on it. The real changes came when any of the Three True Monarchs passed nearby.

“Very well,” said Li Xizhi. That was exactly what he wanted to hear. He nodded in thanks and, without wasting a moment, took Li Wushao with him into the depths.

As he vanished into the abyss, the three disciples of the Golden Feather Sect resealed the formation. One of the women whispered, “So that’s Li Xizhi of the Moongaze Li Family? Handsome indeed, and his strength doesn’t seem low either.”

“Of course!” Another cultivator’s face lit up with pride as he shook his head and said, “My peak’s Grand Martial Uncle Zhang Yun is a close friend of Li Tongya. Even the Immortal Archer Li Xuanfeng had to call him Uncle! How could a descendant of such people be ordinary?”

His admiration for Zhang Yun extended to Li Tongya, which gave him a favorable view of the entire Li Family. Though Li Tongya was famous, Zhang Yun remained obscure among the rogue cultivators, so he eagerly brought him up to highlight his Grand Martial Uncle’s status.

The three continued chatting and laughing until a streak of light descended swiftly onto the island, circled the peak once, then landed directly before them.

“Where is the Peak Master of Changtian Peak?”

Si Tongyi... The three of them recognized him, but held him in disdain. They replied with cool indifference, “The Daoist has already entered the formation.”

“So be it... so be it,” Si Tongyi let out a sigh of relief, then turned and left. A few hours later, another streak of light descended rapidly upon the peak, circled once, and also landed.

This newcomer bore the Azure Pond Sect's seal, his face filled with shock as he asked, “Where is the Peak Master of Changtian Peak?!”

The three recognized him as someone from the Chi Family. One continued reading, while the other kept cultivating. None of them paid him any mind.

————

The Bicolor Scaled Beast surged from the sea, the palace on its back glimmering with shimmering scales before it submerged again.

Once it docked, Huiyao opened the palace doors and respectfully said, “My lord, please.”

Li Zhouwei emerged from the palace. Kongheng had been waiting at the shore. The monk craned his neck until he saw Li Zhouwei disembark, then finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Huiyao carried a basket of pearls, each one as large as a fist and dazzling in luster. Watching their expressions, he quietly slipped them into Kongheng’s hands and whispered, “Please accept these, my lord... The Tail Subkingdom queen is timid by nature, and not the kind to orchestrate such things. One fright and she hasn’t slept a wink in days... I beg your grace, give her a way out...”

Kongheng, being kind-hearted, listened to Huiyao’s murmured explanation and had grasped most of the situation. He had already taken the basket but, afraid of making a misstep, glanced at Li Zhouwei.

When he saw Li Zhouwei nod, Huiyao was overjoyed and thanked them repeatedly. Kongheng gently supported him and said warmly, “Fellow Daoist Huiyao, you have a kind heart. You're truly a fine creature.”

Huiyao was a bit dazed to hear that, knowing he’d done plenty of shady deeds. His face twitched with guilt as he mumbled a soft response. Li Zhouwei turned to look toward the other side, where a young man in armor stood with a sword in hand.

Chen Yang had guarded the island for several years. Since Li Zhouwei and Li Chenghui were in closed-door cultivation, and Kongheng was not one to manage affairs, most responsibilities had fallen to him. Though only at the third stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, his demeanor had changed greatly.

The viciousness and suspicion that had once flickered in his gaze had completely vanished. With the countenance of a Li clansman, and stripped of those coarse expressions, Chen Yang now appeared much steadier.

But when facing Li Zhouwei, he still lowered his eyes, staring at his cheeks rather than those golden pupils, and respectfully said, “Greetings, my lord!”

“Rise.” Li Zhouwei’s gaze did not linger on him. Instead, he turned to exchange a few words with Huiyao. The demonic creature then rode the beast away.

Chen Yang counted the pearls and said softly, “My lord, sixteen Water Pearls in total. It barely reaches the threshold for a Foundation Establishment Realm spirit item.”

As Li Zhouwei stepped into the hall, he replied softly, “Keep them well. The quality is decent. If divided, they’re best used for top-grade Qi Cultivation Realm items. But once we return to the lake, it’s best to gather a full set of sixteen and forge a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact set.”

Chen Yang carefully stored them away, then took out a jade slip from his robe and offered it with both hands. He bowed respectfully as he said, “My lord, this contains records of all island affairs over the past few years. There's records of appointments and removals, as well as spirit ore and paddy yields. Every annual surplus was accounted for without the slightest discrepancy!”

Li Zhouwei accepted the slip and glanced through it. He had to admit, Chen Yang had kept the island in impeccable order these past years. Every spirit field and mine had been managed with precision, and the annual surplus even rivaled the total from the previous three years combined.

This man is ambitious and ruthless, but his capabilities are beyond doubt. It takes someone like him to keep an island full of outer sea cultivators in line.

It was precisely because Chen Yang had ambition that he refrained from touching any of the island’s resources. The cultivators feared him to the extreme. Even Li Chenghui, capable as he was, had to yield some benefits to win hearts. Yet under Chen Yang’s rule, the administration had become extraordinarily clean.

Kongheng waited patiently. Once Li Zhouwei finished reading, he silently handed over the letter he held in his hand.

Li Zhouwei took the letter, skimmed it quickly, then shut his eyes tightly. He waited several seconds before lifting his brows and exhaling, asking, “Did Great-Uncle Xijun[1] leave any words?”

Kongheng shook his head. Li Zhouwei waved for Chen Yang to leave, then sat silently in the hall for a few moments. When he saw Kongheng’s pale face, Li Zhouwei said hoarsely, “With Uncle fallen, I must return at once.”

1. The Author wrote Ximing instead of Xijun in the raw, I've changed it as I think it's the author's mistake. ☜
