# Chapter 1235: The Peony

Li Que'wan fell silent for a moment, but Tianhuo was not surprised. He took a sip of tea, set down his cup, and waited for her to quietly digest the meaning behind his words. At last, he heard the woman speak:

"His Excellency's divine abilities are vast and profound, and as a master of Metal Virtue, He is beyond the ken of a lesser cultivator... It was my own ignorance."

Tianhuo chuckled and said:

"You flatter me... Even so, among the three major branches of metal, the Contemplative Unfolding of Wandering Metal must still be regarded as the foremost. That eminence possesses immense seniority and divine abilities. The fact that my lord was able to attain the Dao was in no small part due to his aid... It is only that their Daoist tradition is not one to move about freely. This current matter can be considered a form of mutual support."

The significance of his words was extraordinary; it was the first time she had ever heard such a thing, and Li Que'wan's heart tensed:

'In other words, the Golden Oneness owes the Wandering Metal a debt for their aid in attaining the Dao. The two Metal Virtue paths are quite close. With one in the south and one in the north acting in concert, they probably intend to diminish the influence of Wu Earth...'

After all, whether it was the past actions of the Golden Oneness or the hints they had given on the lake at certain moments, the Zhang family had held the status of Comprehending Profoundity back then and had also been entangled with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, showing a degree of nominal deference to the north. The true state of affairs behind it all was difficult to discern...

Seeing the contemplative look on her face, Tianhuo said no more and refilled her teacup. The golden-robed woman had already drifted like an immortal through the white, mist-shrouded bamboo grove and landed beside them, holding a jade platter in her hands, her expression slightly apologetic:

"The Golden Book is a precious item connected to my True Monarch through a deep karmic affinity. It is stored within the Esteemed Upper Azure Palace grotto-heaven, and retrieving it is rather troublesome. My apologies for making you wait, fellow Daoist."

She leaned forward, revealing the object on the jade platter. It was a small, palm-length scroll, gold and white at its ends, exquisite and delicate, tied with a red silk ribbon. Two characters were inscribed in an ancient script on its side:

White Nurturing

Zhang Duanyan said with a smile:

"This is the very same text from that time, one in which my True Monarch was heavily involved. After that eminence failed to verify the Dao and perished, this Golden Book was drawn by karmic affinity and returned to our hands, where it has been kept in the grotto-heaven ever since."

'The original Golden Book...'

Although Li Que'wan herself cultivated from a Golden Book, what she had received was bestowed by a Talisman Seed; she had never had the fortune to see the original text. And this copy from the Golden Feather Sect... it was most likely the very one that had been placed upon the Dragon Tiger Platform all those years ago!

With a single glance, she could feel the immense pull the golden scroll exerted on her. Without even extending her spiritual sense, she could faintly perceive that this object was far more than a simple cultivation method.

'The original Golden Book is also an exceptionally potent Spiritual Treasure! Because of its connection to multiple True Monarchs, it has condensed an incredibly profound karmic weight, perhaps even rivaling the Crystalline Jade Branch!'

Tianhuo looked at the book, a similar look of profound emotion in his eyes, and said with a smile:

"White is the color of the Metal Virtue of the west. Nurturing is the way of cultivating the profound. An ancient cultivator once said: 'Nurture the mercury and nourish the lead.' The resulting divine ability is known as Nurturing of Perfect Harmony, which, alongside Awaiting the Supreme Divine, constitutes the virtue of the Whole Pill's vessel... Because it contains the character for 'white,' some practitioners of the Left-Hand Path refer to a substitute as 'Secret White Mercury,' but that version leans too far into Metal Virtue and cannot grasp the true mysteries of the Whole Pill!"

Li Que'wan had naturally heard of Secret White Mercury. It was one of the few paths of the Whole Pill that circulated in Jiangnan. Her own clan even possessed a copy of an Azure Pond cultivation method, the 'Absorb Mercury Whole Origin Method,' which had been stored in their archives for ages, though no one had ever succeeded in mastering it. Even if it was considered a practice of the Left-Hand Path by this direct descendant of a Golden Core master, the records told of figures who had perfected it, becoming high-level experts even within the Foundation Establishment Realm.

As the young man finished speaking, the golden-robed woman beside him produced three sticks of incense from her sleeve and said:

"The Golden Book belongs to the Prime Virtue Daoist tradition, which is also the source of my True Monarch's karmic affinity. Suyun is invited to take these three sticks of incense and bow once to the ancient Daoist tradition of Prime Virtue, to fulfill the karmic bond between master and disciple."

Her expression grew solemn as she said:

"This will also serve to complete the ritual of Dao grace for the Golden Book of Divine Attendance."

These great Daoist traditions often had their own ways. Once one formally accepted the mantle of a certain Dao, it was considered inheriting a significant portion of its sentiment, and what's more, the Golden Oneness had deep ties to the Dragon Tiger Platform. Li Que'wan naturally knew such a procedure was necessary:

'Needless to say, Daoist Master Qiushui must have inherited the Fourteen Sequences of the Golden Book. With this bow, if she truly ascends to her position one day, she will have the doctrinal basis to protect me.'

This was the very reason she had come here. She stepped back slightly, offered the incense, and performed the simple ritual. Tianhuo's expression became visibly warmer, and he enthusiastically helped her to her feet, saying:

"Please!"

Only then did she accept the small scroll with both hands. As she gently unfurled it, countless tiny golden characters leaped from the ancient surface, surging into her mind like a vast ocean!

'What a profound art!'

The Golden Book of Divine Attendance and the White Nurturing Golden Book were not dissimilar in their profundity and subtlety; both were supreme methods of incredible depth and mystery. However, the White Nurturing Golden Book was more refined in the aspects of transformation and nurturing mercury, aligning it more closely with Metal Virtue. It was clearly the handiwork of True Monarch Taiyuan from all those years ago!

She was lost in it for a time, ravenously engraving every character into the depths of her mind. After an unknown period, she finally composed herself slightly and returned the text, her heart filled with joy as she said:

"This grace, which paves the way to the Dao, shall be engraved upon my heart!"

Seeing that the matter was concluded, Zhang Duanyan collected the jade platter and the Golden Book and took her leave, evidently returning to the grotto-heaven. Tianhuo, meanwhile, rose with a smile and said:

"Please!"

Li Que'wan did not know what he had in mind, but she followed him nonetheless, strolling leisurely up a winding stone path. Tianhuo said:

"Fellow Daoist... do you happen to remember the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture from all those years ago?"

'Here it comes!'

As soon as he spoke, Li Que'wan knew that the trouble she had most feared, the one she had discussed with her brother before her arrival, had finally emerged. This direct descendant of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition was holding nothing back, asking his question plainly. She could only nod:

"I have heard of it."

Tianhuo said with a smile:

"The origins of that scripture are quite ancient, dating back to when our two families first formed a bond. My tradition spends its years cultivating in the mountains, with little knowledge of the world's fluctuations, and so we misunderstood your predecessor, crediting the Xiao family instead... Looking back now, it seems our karmic affinity was revealing itself even then."

Li Que'wan did not believe a word of it. Coming from anyone else, it might have been credible, but the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition was so calculating that the clatter of their abacus could be heard for miles; they would scheme against a mere passerby. It was impossible that they had simply mistaken the Xiao family's role. She merely said:

"Now that the opportunity has fallen into the hands of the Immortal Sect, the matter can be considered settled."

Tianhuo shook his head meaningfully and said softly:

"Not so... The time for that has not yet come. Your esteemed clan must know a fair bit about these matters, and Suyun, you are now practically one of us, so I will not waste your time with pleasantries."

"The Xiao Clan... my Golden Feather Sect did try to win them over. At the time, he had even consumed his own kin and feigned severing his Dao-path. The figure backing him was also slow to reveal themselves, and we have been playing along, dragging things out to this very day."

"But as it appears now, his resistance to our overtures was not born of any genuine dislike or enmity. Rather, he refuses to rely on any power that cannot offer him a chance at attaining the Dao. Xiao Chuting has calculated it all very clearly: his is a Quest for Gold!"

Li Que'wan's heart trembled, a chill creeping over her. The young man continued:

"That being the case, I fear there will be a struggle. Su Yan is a genius, to be sure, but compared to Xiao Chuting, he is but a greenhorn... As for whom this opportunity will fall to, that remains to be seen."

The Golden Oneness's schemes ran deep; there was little they set their minds on that they could not obtain. Yet only an old fox like Xiao Chuting, who had only grown more formidable with age and was now poised to unleash his accumulated power, could make someone like Tianhuo so wary!

Li Que'wan simply said:

"The Golden Oneness leaves nothing to chance. You are being far too modest."

Seeing that she was only offering praise, the young man sighed to himself:

'In the end, it was those interfering Buddhist cultivators who threw a wrench in the works, putting us a move behind. If Li Tongya had followed the path we laid out, even if he hadn't reached the Purple Mansion Realm, Li Zhouwei would certainly be on our side by now!'

He glanced at the woman and, seeing she remained unmoved, said softly:

"We understand that Xiao Chuting wishes to seek the Dao. In fact, the problems with his cultivation path are not so great. Even if he used some unorthodox and wicked methods, there is no Heavenly Dao of the Thunder Palace to pass judgment these days. Success is not judged by the cleanliness of one's methods. It is often said that one must cultivate one's own nature to attain the Dao, but in essence, it simply means that the divine abilities one has cultivated are sufficiently stable. His remedies were brilliant; that past affair is hardly enough to sever his path to the Dao..."

"But all the great eminences understand that he absolutely cannot succeed. This has nothing to do with the heights of his divine abilities or Dao-Profundity; he simply has no chance of attaining the Dao while bearing the abnormality of Pit Water."

Li Que'wan raised an eyebrow, and Tianhuo said flatly:

"He was born at the wrong time. The grand tide of fate is not on his side."

The young man sighed and said:

"Chi Buzi's situation is awkward, but Xiao Chuting's is ten times more so. He too faces the various paths of Water Virtue with none willing to accept him, but unlike Chi Buzi, Xiao Chuting possesses nothing that the great eminences would find worth using!"

"Suyun, are you aware of the state of Pit Water?"

Li Que'wan frowned.

"The Vast Ocean?"

"Precisely."

Tianhuo was not surprised. Clearly, for people of their standing, things that lesser cultivators might never learn in a lifetime were common knowledge. He said somberly:

"The vastness of the Mansion Water was usurped by the Pit Water, leading to a complete imbalance between the two paths—it has been this way for many years now. As the saying in the mortal world goes: 'When the Pit overflows, the Mansion runs dry; when Li prospers, True is broken.' This is a case of water and fire becoming excessive and falling out of harmony."

Li Que'wan's Dao-Profundity was not shallow; she understood immediately, her eyes lighting up.

"'When the Pit overflows, the Mansion runs dry'? How apt."

"The river overflows its banks while the lake runs dry. There is nothing to dredge and nowhere to pour. This is a sign of the Dragon-kin losing their virtue."

Tianhuo nodded, a cold sneer in his eyes.

"If Metal Virtue is an internal affair between our two families, then with the Valley Water in seclusion, Water Virtue is the exclusive domain of the Dragon-kin. The vacancy in the paths of Pit Water and Mansion Water is what the other powers are most wary of at present—even Chi Buzi knows that only after the great matter of the True Dragons attaining the Dao is concluded will They permit any change to the Mansion and Pit."

"Change is absolutely impossible right now—if the transformation of the True Dragons is threatened, the madness of the Dragon-kin will be beyond anyone's imagination. The sacrifices they are willing to make would exceed the comprehension of ninety percent of the world."

He had spoken in such detail that Li Que'wan had already pieced together the general outline of the entire situation in her mind. She lowered her gaze and said:

"Senior Xiao..."

Tianhuo seemed to know what she was about to say, his gaze turning grim.

"Xiao Chuting cannot be unaware, but he can no longer afford to wait."

A flicker of movement in Li Que'wan's eyes. Tianhuo's expression was cold.

"When I said he was born at the wrong time, this is what I meant. If he had been born a hundred years later, just a hundred years, with someone to shoulder the burden of the Xiao family for him, he would have neither missed the opportunity to rise by murdering Duanmu Kui, nor would he lack the capital to face the situation with composure—just like Chi Buzi. His situation is also awkward, but he is young and can afford to sit back and watch the storm brew without any sense of urgency."

"But Xiao Chuting is out of time... If I'm not mistaken, his various life-extending methods have all reached their limit, barely sustaining him to this day. He does not cultivate the Whole Pill and lacks the ability of Mercury Transformation to preserve his nature—even my own Daoist Master Tianyi is waiting for time to do its work with Mercury Transformation to make seeking the Dao easier. The two cannot be compared!"

"Given the situation, it is absolutely impossible for him to succeed. It is merely his unwillingness to resign himself to his fate, a final attempt before death."

Tianhuo gradually walked onward, the mountain path beneath his feet growing steeper. Tiers of steps, each half a man's height and gleaming a brilliant cyan, rose before them. He said quietly:

"There is no harm in trying. My Golden Oneness has never underestimated the heroes of the world; it is simply a matter of each seeking advantage through their own abilities. That Xiao Chuting, a man of no significant background, has come this far by relying on his sharp sense of timing and a mind full of schemes is enough to earn our respect. But to wantonly destroy this Dao inheritance would obstruct the future plans of my Golden Oneness."

The young man turned, his back to the hazy white mist that filled the mountains, and stared directly at her.

"Since he is making an all-or-nothing gamble, he is willing to offend countless people even for an impossible goal. How, then, will your clan position itself? If King Wei helps him attain the Dao, what of the honor of the Dragon-kin?"

He looked deeply at Li Que'wan and said in a low voice:

"Inviting Suyun here this time was not just about the cultivation method. The Xiao and Li clans are connected by marriage and have been on good terms for generations. Daoist Master Zhaojing is one of the few people he trusts. We only hope the Daoist Master can convey a message to him for us..."

"If the old Daoist Master Xiao can bravely retreat from the turbulent currents and choose to reincarnate and cultivate anew, not seizing this opportunity from my Dao, then in the future, when the great tide turns in our favor, my Dao will certainly reward him from our surplus fortune!"

The white mist behind him gradually dissipated, revealing a pool of brilliant golden water. It caught the sunlight from the zenith, erupting in a dazzling display of Bright Yang, every ripple on its surface pulsing with potent divine ability.

Beside the pool, shrouded in multicolored clouds, stood a man-high dais built of white bricks that exuded a sense of familiarity. A pale white branch crept across its surface, upon which bloomed a flower the size of a man's palm.

The flower was exquisitely white, each tender petal shot through with gold, and it radiated a powerful, enchanting aura. It was shaped like a peony and condensed an incredibly rich Bright Yang spiritual qi!

As the mountain mists receded, it was as if all the splendor of heaven and earth had gathered upon this single peony. Li Que'wan needed only a single glance to understand what it was.

A Purple Mansion spiritual root!

Adding to that the boundless Bright Yang aura that seemed ready to soar into the heavens, constrained only by a formation, Li Que'wan instantly had her answer:

'It's that Purple Mansion spirit flower!'

'The treasure the Golden Feather Sect obtained from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, the Bright Yang treasure of the Purple Mansion Realm known by the saying: "Each year it blooms and withers, its fallen petals transforming into insects of shell!"'

The dazzling white flower was reflected in her pupils as a wild wind swept up from the mountains. The golden-robed young man's robes billowed as he turned his head and said with a smile:

"As long as fellow Daoist Zhaojing can persuade the Xiao family to take a step back, or if King Wei, for the sake of our relationship, stands with the Golden Oneness, then we are willing to gift this supreme spiritual root from the Eastern Fire Heaven, the Imperial Fiend White Peony, to King Wei, to aid him on his Bright Yang path to attaining the Dao!"
