# Chapter 780: Seeking the Pill

A moment later, a golden-eyed young man clad in armor entered the hall. Li Jiangxia was tall, a full head taller than even Li Zhouluo. Upon seeing him, he bowed low, resembling a crouching bear.

"Greetings, Fourth Uncle!" he said in a rumbling voice.

Li Zhouluo quickly helped him up. Li Jiangxia’s expression was grim. "Uncle Zhouluo," he said quietly, "I have been guarding the eastern shore all these days, but no news of my father has come from the clan. I could no longer restrain my anxiety. I also have matters to report, so I came back personally to ask you."

Li Zhouluo then recalled that the Second Young Master, Li Jianglong, had returned with Li Minggong and the others. He had learned the news long ago and even attended Li Chenghui’s funeral. But at that time, Cui Jueyin was not on the Eastern Shore, which was also swarming with demonic cultivators looking to make a fortune. Li Jiangxia, as the only one who could make decisions, had been unable to leave the dangerous roads. He could only pay his respects from afar. Now that things had stabilized, he had returned with the Profound Peak cultivators to report.

"There is no news," Li Zhouluo replied. "But he should be safe and sound... How are the Profound Peak cultivators?"

"Kong Guxi has returned. Fourth Uncle can ask him for the details... I came this time... to ask for men."

Li Zhouluo frowned. "What is the situation?"

Li Jiangxia looked troubled. "The Capital immortals Dao forces have not continued west. They are even pulling people back. But the nearby demonic cultivators heard that our clan's Purple Mansion expert is indisposed, and they’ve been paying frequent visits, hoping to rob us blind. Feeling that there is safety in numbers, they come in groups of three and five..."

"At first, it was just minor skirmishes. But over time, they realized there were no serious consequences. These past few days, it has become more intense. We have even spotted the shadows of Foundation Establishment cultivators."

"Several of the Profound Peak experts are injured, leaving only Sect Master Kong... we are stretched dangerously thin. I was hoping to ask the clan to send a few experts to help."

Li Zhouluo looked somewhat awkward. "It is not easy for anyone in the clan to leave right now. All the powerful elders are in seclusion... There are demonic cultivators in the desert as well. I am already preparing to send Li Wen and Qu Bushi there with Xinghan. It will take several days."

Li Jiangxia sighed.

Li Zhouluo then said, "You wait here a moment. I will see Chen Yang and have him make a trip to the Eastern Shore... His combat ability is strong, and his Immortal Foundation excels at fighting multiple opponents. He is the most suitable choice."

Li Jiangxia had no choice but to nod. He did not immediately withdraw, however, but hesitated before speaking again. "I also came... to request one of the clan's Essence Gathering Pills from uncle."

Li Zhouluo frowned instantly, shooting him a puzzled look. The young man before him was clearly only at the fifth level of Qi Refining. "You are still a long way from Foundation Establishment," he asked. "And even if your cultivation were high enough... would you not practice your techniques first? The clan will naturally prepare a pill for you. Why are you in such a hurry?"

Li Jiangxia hesitated briefly before replying, "This is a request to *trade* for it... I have a sworn friend named Pei Xie, a man of the wilderness. He has reached the late stage of Qi Refining and lacks only this pill to break through. If the clan has a quota, I would like to exchange for one on his behalf."

Realization dawned on Li Zhouluo. He shook his head. "What is the meaning of this! Since you are confident he can break through to Foundation Establishment, and he is your sworn friend, the clan is in desperate need of manpower. We can simply grant it to him. Have him come to the lake to receive his orders. I will see him myself."

At these words, Li Jiangxia looked very uncomfortable. "Reporting to Fourth Uncle... Brother Pei has other plans. He intends to break through in the Eastern Sea and adventure overseas..."

"This!"

Li Zhouluo was stunned. He was secretly displeased.

'From the sound of it... he wants to use the clan's resources to curry favor for himself! We don't even know if this man can break through... giving this to some rogue cultivator from the wilderness is like tossing a meat bun at a dog! It will be gone for good!'

He fell silent, and Li Jiangxia immediately understood his thoughts. "That is why this nephew thought to *trade* for it from the clan..."

Li Zhouluo let out a long sigh and shook his head. "How can this be a simple matter of a trade!"

With Li Ximing missing, if he was injured and healing overseas, he might not return for twenty or even fifty years. Every Essence Gathering Pill used was one less they had. This was not merely a question of value. Under the joint monopoly held by the Purple Mansion clans of Jiangnan, the Essence Gathering Pill had long since achieved a status far exceeding its intrinsic worth.

The Xiao Clan always minded their own business, and Xiao Chuting was wandering the four seas—even the Xiao family couldn't find him. They were also eating into their own stockpile of Essence Gathering Pills. It wasn't easy for the Li Clan to get any from them, either.

After he sighed, the young man before him seemed entirely unsurprised. He bowed.

"This junior is willing to relinquish my own future pill allotment to take this one. When the time comes for this junior's Foundation Establishment... if nothing has changed, I will no longer ask the clan for one!"

"You..."

Li Zhouluo shook his head. "Get up, quickly. What is this nonsense? How could the clan deprive you of your pill? You have long had a reputation for judging character, so I naturally trust you. What Dao path does he cultivate? It's not Merging Fire, is it?"

He made a small joke. Li Jiangxia was overjoyed. "Of course not! Brother Pei cultivates the Gazing the Metal Apex, a path of the Metal Virtue."

"Metal Virtue... Many of Jiangnan's wandering cultivators do indeed cultivate the Metal Virtue... We have one in the stores. Take my writ and go get it."

Li Jiangxia let out a breath of relief, nodding repeatedly before quickly withdrawing. Li Zhouluo, however, was lost in thought.

'I suspect this Pei Xie has been planning to attempt his breakthrough for a long time... He just wasn't confident he could ask for the pill... The moment I take charge, this kid runs right over to request it!

Among the recent managers of the clan, he truly was the easiest to talk to on this matter. After all, Li Zhouluo figured he would only be in this position for three to five years. Li Jiangxia's talent was so high; naturally, Li Zhouluo was willing to sell a favor and have the young man owe him one.

He paced for two steps, adjusted his composure, and sat back down in the main seat.

"Send in the Sect Master of Profound Peak!" he announced.

Barely ten breaths later, an old man hurried in. His hair was white, his features withered. Upon seeing Li Zhouluo, he dropped to his knees with a thud.

"Greetings, Clan Lord! Everyone at Profound Peak is grateful to the noble clan for saving our lives! Guxi is here to thank the noble clan on behalf of all of Profound Peak!"

Li Zhouluo was somewhat astonished. This was the first time Kong Guxi had ever performed a full kneeling kowtow to someone of his status. Previously, he only knelt so completely before the Daoist Master. When meeting the Li Clan Lord, he almost always offered a cupped-fist salute.

"Sect Master Kong, please rise, quickly!"

But Kong Guxi did not get up.

In Kong Guxi's eyes, the Li Clan's benevolence and righteousness had reached the absolute limit. This Sect Master of Profound Peak was kneeling out of deep, genuine emotion. Tears flowed uncontrollably from his eyes, and a low sob escaped his throat.

The Capital immortals Dao's attack had resulted in the disappearance of the Li Clan's Purple Mansion expert, Daoist Master Zhaojing, and the Clan Lord and Purple Mansion seed, Li Zhouwei. And in Kong Guxi's view, this entire disaster had started because of his Profound Peak Gate! How could this not move the old man to his very core?

Now that the storm had passed, even the few young Foundation Establishment cultivators in his own Profound Peak Gate had fallen silent. Kong Qiuyan, who had once been inscrutable and deep-thinking, was now personally descending to heal the Li Clan's cultivators. Even the long-suffering Kong Xiaxiang had begun patrolling the entire Eastern Shore on the Li Clan's behalf, not to mention the elder Kong Guli... His old brother had nearly refused treatment for his own wounds, insisting on coming to the lake to offer a humble, profound apology!

'The bonds of blood and ties of brotherhood are nothing compared to that Daoist Master's single promise... My Profound Peak... owes the Li Clan an immense debt!'
