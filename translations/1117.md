# Chapter 1121: The Orthodox Position

Wei Xuanyin finished speaking. At his side, Fachang listened with silent, secret admiration. Kongshu, however, merely pressed his palms together. He was not surprised, but his face was filled with emotion as he nodded.

"I heard that before Daoist Master Shaomian began seeking the Dao, he returned to the Tao family... He stated that the rise and fall of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao were one and the same, and that it would all depend on Xuanlou. Looking at it now, the old Daoist Master's insight was truly remarkable."

"The Wei family... is, after all, a blood descendant of that personage."

Hearing Kongshu mention his late master, Tao Ping, a ripple passed through Wei Xuanyin's eyes.

"I understand what you mean, Kongshu. Although Li Jieyi is no longer part of the Seeking the Purple Pavilion and has transformed from 'Xuan Chan' into the 'Vast Cicada' of today, he is, in the end, of the same generation as I. It's not that I never tried to persuade him, but his karma is settled. Even if Xuanwei himself were here, he could only offer four words: 'He brought this upon himself!'"

"This little monk understands."

Kongshu sighed softly.

"Regarding the matter of Vast Cicada, I will tell the dharma realm to give up hope. At least, for now..."

He seemed to have forgotten the original purpose of his visit, his gaze resting on Wei Xuanyin with profound meaning.

"This little monk once heard a story."

"Back when the Liang dynasty fell, Guo Wusi declared himself King Yong. He cultivated Valley Water and battled Qi Wang, a cultivator of Molten Fire, in Yongzhou. The great powers of the world assumed that in this clash of water and fire, one was bound to be destroyed, and the victor would become the lord of Yongzhou."

"Guo Wusi was a genius of Yongzhou, descended from a line of great generals from the Wei dynasty. He had attained the 'wisdom eye' and had high hopes of seeking the Auxiliary Position through Valley Water. Qi Wang was his equal, with a deep background and a strong contender for the Auxiliary Position himself. However, Molten Fire was less renowned than Valley Water, and Guo Wusi's fame was far greater. At the time, half the Central Plains were inclined to follow his lead."

Wei Xuanyin's eyes flashed.

"Xuanlou has also heard this. But they weren't the only geniuses of that era... After all, no matter how much the Touba family revered the Wei, they were still foreign tribes. The lands had been in turmoil for so long. Every great family and common citizen hoped for an Imperial Monarch of true Xia descent to emerge..."

The monk nodded, his tone full of pity.

"At that time, the Murong Xianbei had already consolidated his power, his might at its zenith. Guo Wusi feared that the state of Yan would play the fisherman and reap the benefits, so he repeatedly tried to negotiate with Qi Wang, urging him to resist the foreign invaders first. But Qi Wang saw his own chance to attain the Dao as being intrinsically linked to Guo Wusi. He made a three-point pact with the Murong Clan and immediately turned to attack Yong."

"In the end... Great Yan naturally broke the pact. It resulted in one of the two kings falling in battle and the other being captured. Although Qi Wang survived, he lost all possibility of ever seeking the 'golden position' and died full of resentment."

Wei Xuanyin said quietly, "He placed too much faith in the promises of so-called great figures."

Kongshu pressed his palms together.

"You cannot entirely blame Qi Wang. Their Daos were different, so their outcomes were destined to diverge. Even if Qi Wang had not chosen that path, he would have lost his chance for the Quest for Gold regardless. Why not take the gamble?"

"I have some guesses about Your Excellency's own Dao path. It is one where Yang manifests and Yin recedes, where Wei rises and Zhao falls. But although Profound Governance is powerful, the tide of this era is not something your faction can control alone. This, too, is a narrow path along a perilous cliff. Relying on just yourself and Lord Yao Guanyi, controlling the situation will be incredibly difficult."

"Setting aside the larger situation, Bright Yang is explosive, domineering, and judgmental. Lord Wei may have no intention of descending into yin-natured wickedness, but how can you be certain that King Wei does not harbor ambitions of emulating the Wei Emperor? Even if he doesn't, might others force his hand? You must be cautious. Extremely cautious."

The black-robed monk closed his eyes.

"This little monk has said all he intends to say."

Wei Xuanyin had long since understood the monk's allegory. His gaze drifted to the white snow filling the sky. After a long moment, he replied, "Xuanlou has been enlightened."

The black-robed monk smiled and waved his farewell. The two monks began their descent, stepping through the snow. Their figures shrank into two small black dots as they departed. Fachang finally let out a sigh of relief.

"So be it... so be it!"

Kongshu chuckled and shook his head.

"If you didn't let it be, you would be obstructing his Dao path."

Fachang, however, was unconvinced.

"Am I the only one? Never mind that King Wei is a qilin in chains, is Wei Xuanyin's life any easier? Before Yao Guanyi came out of seclusion, did you see the state he was in, being ordered around left and right? He will face plenty more predicaments like that in the future!"

Kongshu didn't argue. He just smiled.

"Do you know the origins of the Wei clan?"

Fachang said, "The Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao... Wei Guanyan, of course. It's just a pity he was born in that era. With Yin and Yang in chaos, he was doomed to fail."

The black-robed monk shook his head.

"Although the Wei family had fallen on hard times by Wei Guanyan's generation, they were still the Wei Clan of Chenchuan. They are descendants of _that_ True Monarch Guanhu. He was the second disciple of the Master of Comprehending Profoundity, and the master of Xu Che."

"Xu Che? The one who was a lazybones until he became a Woven Jade Immortal?"

Kongshu nodded, his expression serious.

"Xu Che was an old man who 'imbibed qi for ninety years, white-headed and haggard with tears,' yet He was able to teach him to become a Woven Jade Immortal. That alone shows His capability. And it was precisely because of Xu Che that all the cultivators in the world began to flock to the gates of Comprehending Profoundity..."

"Later, this True Monarch Guanhu returned his 'position' to Heaven and Earth and went seeking the Dao beyond the sky. He traveled until he reached a dim, unfathomable place. There, he thought of his descendants and erected a stone stele. Upon it, he inscribed: 'Land of Regret'."

"That stele, just like his Daoist temple, the Unmoving Temple, has remained fixed for eternity. From that day on, any great power seeking the Dao beyond the heavens can rest at that place. And if they realize their own inadequacy and feel regret, they can turn back."

"Incredible..." Fachang was silent for a long time. "I wonder what kind of spirit pills or immortal medicines exist beyond the heavens that make all these great figures strive for it, one after another."

Kongshu raised an eyebrow.

"I'm afraid only those who have reached the level of Fruition Attainment would understand that."

...

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

Yin and Yang were in perfect balance, the light deep and somber.

Faint white qi flickered. On the jade throne, the man slowly exhaled a breath of white mist. His golden eyes brightened, filling the room with radiance.

'Much slower.'

Li Zhouwei's cultivation session had not been long. For a Purple Mansion Realm expert, a mere half-year was just a brief meditation, only enough to slightly consolidate this newly acquired divine ability. Yet he could clearly feel it: compared to Sovereign's Perilous Tread, his progress in cultivating Crimson Severing Arrowhead was slower by more than just one level.

'It's not just that Sovereign's Perilous Tread was blessed by fate and was highly compatible... it seems this new one is inherently different.'

Li Zhouwei could feel that the Crimson Severing Arrowhead divine ability within him disliked the spiritually balanced atmosphere of this place; it even faintly resisted it. While an overly dense spiritual influx was excellent for condensing an immortal foundation, it was not of great help in refining a divine ability.

Furthermore, the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill, which had been so helpful for his first two divine abilities, showed almost no effect on this one. A thoughtful look passed through his eyes.

Normally, any spiritual atmosphere, as long as it approached a state of Yin-Yang balance, was broadly beneficial for cultivation. Whether for cultivating Jade True or refining True Qi, the boons to one's speed were immense.

Bright Yang was one of the 'Three Yangs', and his previous two divine abilities had been extremely active in this balanced atmosphere, allowing him to progress at incredible speed. This was the first time he had ever felt such resistance.

'Finding a grotto-heaven like this is already difficult. It would be more practical to find some medicinal pills... Besides... crossing the Purple Mystery is no easy task.'

He stood up and entered the High Firmament Pavilion. A quick check showed that the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method was now available. He retrieved the jade slip and began to carefully study its contents.

This method was different from Great Radiance of White Brilliance. It did not require a wisp of Radiant Fire as its foundation. Instead, it was an art of 'life-mandate resonance', using one's own life-mandate to sense Radiant Fire. This meant that aside from the cultivator's personal progress, a large part of the spell art's power depended on the caster's own divine abilities.

'For every additional divine ability the caster possesses, this spell art gains a fraction more power. For a Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivator, every extra Life Divine Ability they possess makes their life-mandate more balanced, making this art easier to advance.'

After all, one could have more than one Life Divine Ability. For his Bright Yang path, which only had a single one, this was not particularly advantageous. However, the relationship between Bright Yang and Radiant Fire was among the closest that existed, which served as a form of compensation.

This did not mean one could gain power without practicing the art. It simply meant the demand for external resources was far less. The fundamental source of power was oneself. If one could not thoroughly master the spell art and cultivate it diligently, it was useless, no matter how 'high' one's life-mandate was.

'It's not that it requires no resources at all... rather, the resources it _does_ require are far beyond the conventional. If I could obtain a Metallic Essence... cultivating this art would surely show progress of a thousand miles a day.'

Of course, someone with a unique life-mandate like Li Zhouwei was second only to a literal reincarnation of a Metallic Essence. He could not be judged by common standards. As he finished reading the overview, a strange feeling welled up within him.

'An art of life-mandate resonance... How peculiar. I've never seen one for Bright Yang.'

Stirred by this, he pressed his hand onto the bronze platform once more, causing the golden characters on the bamboo slips to float up, one after another. An unknown amount of time passed before he finally looked away, deep in thought.

The cultivation methods and spell arts in the High Firmament Pavilion were as vast as a sea of smoke. He could not possibly read them all, but from this small sample, he could glimpse the whole. In that short time, he had seen only five arts of life-mandate resonance:

'Reflecting Metal, Upright Wood, Pit Water, Radiant Fire, and Still Earth.'

'This means that among such resonance arts, only Radiant Fire is compatible with Bright Yang... There is not a more suitable one. But... why these five? Is there something special about them?'

His current Dao-Profundity was already considerably high. He mused softly, "Radiant Fire's fierce assembly, holding fire's orthodox position... Reflecting Metal, the orthodox position of Shen-You metal... Jia-Yi Configuration, Upright Wood like stone..."

"As for Still Earth, the Profound Peak Dao lineage also has a description: 'Uphold the orthodox, banish the deviant, command and adjust the mountains and rivers'..."

'These five 'virtues' must be connected... and it has something to do with the 'orthodox'.'

The understanding in his golden eyes grew clearer.

"The 'intercalary matching' must be the key! It is just that low-level cultivators cannot perceive it."

He lowered his head, pondering silently for a long time. An idea was already taking shape in his mind. Only then did he ascend to the pavilion's upper floor. As expected, he saw a pill furnace standing tall, blazing with fire. A man with regular features and striking ruby-red lips sat quietly within the flames.

It was Li Ximing's Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

'Grand-uncle's alchemy skill has improved immensely. To be this confident, he can let his alternate body work even when he's away from the grotto-heaven.'

He waited a short while, reading over the spell art's incantations. Just then, the real Li Ximing hurried in, his movement technique active. He paused in surprise, then smiled, casually withdrawing his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

"Perfect timing!"

He slapped the furnace. The flames trembled, and brilliant immortal light flared. The furnace lid flew open, and nine motes of light shot out, landing one by one in his palm. They were the size of pearls but had the appearance of multicolored, wing-flapping White Cicadas.

"Not bad at all."

Li Ximing always refined large batches. This one was also perfectly compatible with the Bright Yang path, so he had naturally refined a full set. He laughed and held them out.

"This is the Fading Sun Armour-Break Pill. It's said that 'the pill is a chariot, the form shifts a thousand li'. Thanks to Sima Yuanli, I've finally succeeded in refining it. I was just bringing it for you to see."

"This pill can be used to shift one's form to deliver a killing blow, or for escape. If taken during daily cultivation, it also has the auxiliary effect of harmonizing multiple, different divine abilities within the body. It's a bit unorthodox, but it has one interesting benefit: if a Demon beast consumes it, it has the effect of purifying its bloodline."

Li Zhouwei took one and examined it closely.

"It draws upon the Light of Karmic Dissolution and Pure Yin," he praised, "and merges it with the concept of the Yang Cusp's annihilation. The creator's methods were good, but their understanding of Bright Yang was not deep enough. They only grasped the surface, not the true interior."

"A step further would be to incorporate the 'fading sun' killing intent of Crimson Severing Arrowhead. And a step beyond that, one would have to grasp the original intent of the Yang Cusp, to create a 'thorn of perversion'."

"As for the bloodline purification..." Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment. "I suspect that's because the inversion of Bright Yang inherently carries the meaning of 'supplanting the honored'. It naturally has some effect on bloodlines. But the pill formula was not designed for that purpose, so even if the effect exists, it must be minimal."

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully.

"The creator of this formula, Cui E... was from ancient times. When he wrote this, the Wei Emperor might have still been alive. Even if he knew the inner principles, he probably would not have dared to write them down... The day he did, officials would have been knocking on his door."

"It's different now, though. Your guidance is crucial. Based on my Alchemy Dao, if I experiment a few more times, I should be able to create several variations."

Li Zhouwei chuckled. He took only one pill and slipped it into his sleeve. His expression turned serious.

"Grand-uncle, please look at this."

Li Ximing took the jade slip, read through the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method, and exclaimed in surprise,

"What a profound ancient spell art!"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"It is difficult, but its advantage is that it does not require resources. When Jiangqian comes out of seclusion, we can have him study it."

He voiced a slight concern, "I wonder how many Life Divine Abilities 『Radiant Fire』 has. I am not asking for as many as Pit Water, but I hope it is better than Bright Yang's single one. If it has two, it would be much simpler to use."

Pit Water was the Li family's foundational Dao lineage, and they had gained further understanding of it because of the Xiao family. Li Ximing knew this well. 

"That is not the urgent matter... There was something I wanted to ask you..."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. The Daoist Master before him seemed anxious, pacing a few steps before he finally spoke.

"The Old Master's health... is already in some danger."

The words made Li Zhouwei turn his head, a sense of unease rising. He pinched his fingers, calculating.

"It is too soon."

Even at the same cultivation realm, lifespans could vary greatly. Chi Wei had lived a hundred years less than average, while Daoist Master Yuanxiu, Si Boxiu, had lived quite a bit longer. Those with divine abilities like Horn Wood or Valley Water also tended to live longer...

He asked, "Is it his lifespan?"

Li Ximing shook his head.

"Not entirely. The Old Master sustained many injuries in his youth, and a large portion of them damaged his foundation. In Purple Mansion Realm terms, they damaged his 'nature' or his 'life'. He has been recuperating well all these years, so nothing seemed wrong. But as his natural lifespan approaches its end, all that old damage to his life-mandate is beginning to surface..."

"I was thinking... we do not lack for spiritual resources. I want to find that Horn Wood Daoist Master, or perhaps Daoist Master Xiang Chun. We could use one of their divine abilities, trade them something, and I could refine a pill... In short, I want to try, without telling the Old Master. I cannot say how much it will extend his life, but at least it might make him more comfortable..."
