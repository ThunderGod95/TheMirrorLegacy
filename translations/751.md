# Chapter 751: A Commission

After Tinglan and Sumian had spoken, Li Ximing fell silent for a moment. It was clear that neither of them cared whether Fu En or Kong Haiying occupied the mountain; all that mattered was that events proceeded according to their plan. The Profound Peak Gate’s fate was sealed.

‘Tinglan sees things clearly,’ Li Ximing mused. ‘The Purple Smoke Gate is in a period of weakness. Simply seizing the Profound Peak Gate’s territory would be an overextension. Drawing in a friendly Purple Mansion cultivator is the best possible move, and it aligns perfectly with her long-term ambitions.’

Tinglan was all smiles. The Purple Smoke Gate had merely stepped in to mediate, and with just a few words, they had secured the Profound Peak Gate’s mountain for their ally. And Li Ximing was expected to thank her for it.

He understood the situation perfectly. When a Daoist Master from the Purple Smoke Gate personally came to offer a "suggestion," how much room did he truly have to refuse?

Tinglan was a Daoist Master of the Green Pine Temple's Dao lineage. By personally mediating this conflict, she was extending him a significant amount of courtesy, even if it was a calculated move. Sumian, meanwhile, did little more than chime in with praise and nods of agreement, his flattery almost shameless. His stance was blindingly obvious.

Setting the Li family’s interests aside, the Purple Smoke Gate was determined to support Daoist Master Zhu Gong. If Li Ximing raised any objections, he would not only offend Tinglan but also stand in the way of her sect. The Xuanmiao Temple, which sought a peaceful resolution, would be displeased, and Yehui would be laughing all the way.

‘There aren’t many spiritual resources left in the Profound Peak Gate anyway. It’s a vague matter of how much my family gets versus how much Yehui gets. And with Kong Haiying absent, Yehui is the one who truly loses out in this deal. He probably only agreed under pressure…’

Tinglan had dismissed the Capital immortals Dao with a single, cutting remark: ‘We’ve already given him enough face!’ She clearly held them in low regard.

‘My family holds the reputation of a righteous clan in Jiangnan. With the Xiao family watching from the side and the Azure Pond Sect as a potential retreat, Tinglan has to show me some respect. But Yehui… even with his higher cultivation, he likely has very little say in the matter.’

Since the Purple Smoke Gate wanted the mountain and Yehui needed to be placated, Fu En’s fate was sealed. Li Ximing could only concede.

“That can be arranged,” he said. “But what of the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate to the east?”

The Profound Peak Gate bordered their territory, and even though the Sword Gate had already claimed land around Lake Xian—prompting a hurried apology from Sumian—their official stance was still required. Li Ximing’s question was expected.

“Do not worry,” Tinglan replied smoothly. “Daoist Master Lingmei has already stated that he will no longer interfere in the affairs of the Profound Peak Gate.”

With that, Li Ximing had nothing left to say. He took a sip of his tea. “Moving a Purple Mansion array is a troublesome affair. I must ask for your assistance, Daoist Master.”

Tinglan knew he had agreed, but she still lowered her head in thought. Li Ximing’s request meant she would have to personally enter the Great Void and retrieve the array. To outsiders who didn’t know the details of this chess game, it would look as though she were taking advantage of the chaos to steal the Profound Peak Gate’s grand array.

Given that Li Ximing had no skill in the Dao of formations, the request was reasonable. ‘So be it,’ Tinglan thought. ‘Those watching from the Great Void are just spectators. With a little thought, they’ll understand the situation.’

She nodded, and the matter was settled. Li Ximing produced the secret incantation for the Profound Peak Gate’s formation disk, along with the jade pendant, and handed them to her.

“In that case,” Tinglan said, “Zhaojing, you should begin making arrangements. The first signs will appear within the next few months. Once this is resolved, I will visit the lake to set up the new array.”

She made no mention of alchemy in front of Sumian, speaking only of the formation. The old Daoist Master listened with a smile. “With this matter settled, I can finally enter seclusion. Many of my affairs were delayed because of the Profound Peak Gate.”

The spring rain continued its gentle patter outside as the three of them drank tea and conversed in a relaxed atmosphere.

Sumian tilted his chin up. “A friend of mine who cultivates in the Yan Kingdom shared some interesting news. The northern tribes have grown more aggressive in recent years. Several large confederations have emerged, boasting an army of a hundred thousand, and they even have Purple Mansion cultivators among them now.”

Tinglan showed no surprise. “Emperor Zhao has lost his authority. He can’t even leave his own palace, let alone control his ancestral homeland in the north. After a century, it’s no surprise that turmoil has erupted.”

“I have another friend who has been struggling to gather a particular type of Qi and needs the conflict of nations to advance,” Sumian continued. “When he heard the news a few months ago, he was overjoyed and went there immediately. I hear many ancient ruins have been unearthed as well, leading to speculation that a person of great destiny has appeared.”

Li Ximing sipped his tea in silence. ‘Right, everyone has friends everywhere… I’ve only just become a Daoist Master and have hardly left Jiangnan.’

Unaware of his thoughts, Sumian pressed on, his line of questioning clearly intentional. “Since there is a person of destiny, have you gone to see, fellow Daoist? Could it be a reincarnation of a sacred land’s Daoist Master?”

His question was a veiled reference to Daoist Master Zipei, a subtle probe. But Tinglan was direct.

“Why would someone like that reincarnate in such a place, only to become a pawn in another’s game?” she laughed. “You worry too much, old friend! Besides, my Purple Smoke Gate has an elder at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm. Although his whereabouts are often unknown, he went to take a look. If it were truly her, he would have brought the person back long ago.”

Her tone was smooth and natural, without a hint of hesitation, as if the missing peak Purple Mansion cultivator was exactly as the sect claimed: elusive, but occasionally returning for seclusion. Her words made it sound as if she had just seen him recently.

Sumian nodded repeatedly.

Tinglan continued, “After all, he is old and has his own affairs to arrange. He’s so busy that he’s almost never seen… Ultimately, these matters fall to us, the younger generation.”

Sumian quickly interjected, “I once cultivated in the Eastern Sea and met the Senior near the barbarian isles. We spoke for a time, and his guidance was immensely beneficial. I am forever grateful. If you ever have the chance to see him upon his return to the sect, please send for me so I may pay my respects.”

Tinglan’s expression remained unchanged as she nodded in agreement. Soon after, she and Li Ximing took their leave. Sumian escorted them all the way out of the Xuanmiao Temple, leaving the courtyard to the quiet, drizzling rain.

After the time it takes for half an incense stick to burn, Sumian tore through the Great Void and returned, a thoughtful look on his face. He sat down on his prayer mat and murmured to himself, “If Senior Wen truly returns to the sect often, he would have heard the news of my own sect’s founding and would surely have clarified matters. Tinglan couldn’t possibly be unaware of the events on the isles… which means she hasn’t seen him in at least sixteen or seventeen years.”

He paused. “Whether he has fallen or is simply missing… as long as he’s not around, I can use the Qi-Stone Demonic Embryo with more confidence.”

***

After leaving the Xuanmiao Temple’s domain, Li Ximing stepped into the Great Void. Tinglan traveled alongside him, clearly having lingered for a private word.

“About the pills…” the woman began with a smile. “I’ll have to trouble you.”

Li Ximing waved his hand dismissively. “Daoist Master, please don’t say that. Zhaojing is incredibly grateful that you took time from your busy schedule to resolve my family’s troubles.”

Pleasantries cost nothing. After offering a few words of flattery, Li Ximing saw Tinglan get to the point.

“Since we are using the Profound Peak Gate’s formation, I should offer you some compensation for helping with the modifications.”

The terms of the alchemy had already been decided: any pills produced beyond the first three would belong to Li Ximing. He was confident he could refine more than three, and gaining the services of a Purple Mansion formation master on top of that was a profitable deal no matter how he looked at it. Still, he sighed.

“I dare not accept your payment in advance, fellow Daoist. If I fail to refine the pills, I would be too ashamed to face you again.”

Tinglan clearly disliked that possibility. She didn’t believe he would waste such a precious portion of primal water, and she forced a smile. “You should still tell me what you need now. I can look for it while I’m traveling. Otherwise, we’ll just waste more time, and I’d hate to keep you waiting.”

Li Ximing could see that Tinglan was a cultivator who liked to have everything planned and in order. He relented. “It’s difficult for me to decide on such short notice. However, I am in need of a high-quality Bright Yang Dharma artifact to serve as a spirit embryo. An ancient one would be best. Do you have any leads?”

“Oh?” Tinglan considered this for a moment, then nodded. “That shouldn’t be a problem. I can select a few artifacts from the Purple Smoke Gate’s collection for Zhaojing to choose from. As for an ancient artifact… I will have to make some inquiries.”

It was a small request, but Li Ximing had his own plans. He wasn’t just asking Tinglan; he also intended to write to the Azure Pond Sect, inquire with the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate, and even have Cui Jueyin send a letter back to his own clan.

The reason for such complexity was not just to have a wider selection. Having met so many Purple Mansion cultivators, a seed of caution had taken root in his heart.

‘I need a Bright Yang Dharma artifact to forge my spirit embryo, preferably an ancient one. This item will become my personal Purple Mansion Dharma Artifact. How can I let anyone know its form and function so easily? Not even its abilities from the Foundation Establishment Realm. I must create a smokescreen, make it impossible for anyone to know for sure which artifact I used to forge my spirit embryo.’

As he pondered this, he asked another question. “The Hundred Mountains Concealed Storage Spirit Array is excellent, but when you relocate and rebuild it… could you modify it as much as possible? It can be of similar power, or even slightly weaker. I just ask that it be significantly different.”

After all, the array belonged to the Profound Peak Gate. If he took it and set it up on Pingya Island exactly as it was, anyone passing by would recognize it. More importantly, what would the numerous former members of the Profound Peak Gate think when they saw their grand array protecting his island?

The damage to his reputation was one concern; the security risk was another, and a far greater one. The Profound Peak Gate’s legacy would now be scattered. The Li family would have a part of it, as would Yehui, Zhu Gong, Sumian, and even Tinglan. What if one of them held a core record of the array’s weaknesses? He had no desire to become the next Fei family.

“Oh?”

If his first condition was minor, this second one was rather troublesome. Tinglan hesitated. “A Purple Mansion array… every node is carefully researched and meticulously placed. If you change even one part, corresponding adjustments must be made throughout the entire formation. Adapting it to a new landscape on top of that… it would take an enormous amount of effort…”

Li Ximing smiled. “Refining these pills will take five or six years. That should give you enough time to work on the formation. I’m not asking for a complete overhaul, just enough changes so that it looks completely different on the surface, with a few key components altered.”

His tone shifted as he let out a sigh. “With the Profound Peak Gate’s legacy scattered, your friend may one day come to my door, and I might have to grudgingly return her people. Those cultivators are intimately familiar with the Hundred Mountains Concealed Storage Spirit Array. My family doesn’t want to be left with such a vulnerability.”

By mentioning Zhu Gong, he put her on the spot. Tinglan paused. It was true that Li Ximing had been very accommodating, allowing her to arrange everything.

“Very well,” she conceded. “Leave it to me. I will set aside the time to modify it over the next few years.”

With their agreement settled, they parted ways. Li Ximing tore through the Great Void, flying until he reached his own territory and materialized on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The rain didn’t seem to fall over the lake here; the mountain was perpetually bright and radiant, its slopes carpeted with drifting blossoms.

As was his routine, he first retrieved the Profound Pattern Vase from the Baleful Earth to refine it. The fire-attribute baleful Qi within the vase had accumulated to a significant degree, making it progressively harder to refine. But with a single activation of his Valley Wind Flame-Guiding Art, the process became effortless.

By now, the baleful Qi in the vase was far too potent for any Foundation Establishment cultivator to handle. Only a Purple Mansion cultivator who had mastered a divine ability could continue the refinement. Li Ximing estimated that in another ten years, even cultivators without a Fire Virtue divine ability would be unable to manage it. But for him, with his unique art, both the speed and difficulty of refinement were trivial.

Li Ximing lifted his sleeve and examined the vase. Wisps of crimson patterns, like rising flames, had begun to appear on its surface. Despite all his efforts, however, its power was still at the Foundation Establishment level and useless against a Purple Mansion cultivator.

‘The material of the Profound Pattern Vase is extraordinary, but there’s no sign that its refinement is reaching its limit. It only increases in power, not in mystique… The gap between Foundation Establishment and Purple Mansion is too vast. It’s not just a matter of whether you can hurt them, but whether you can even hit them. The moment I pull out my artifact, they can just escape into the Great Void. What’s the point?’

Still, with the vase in his hands, Li Ximing felt no fear, only a hope that its potential would remain limitless each time he picked it up. He returned the small bottle to the earthen fire and reappeared on the mountain peak.

White flowers covered the ground. The stone table and chairs were clear; the gardenias dared not fall where he usually sat, forming a pristine circle around it. The tea on the table was still warm.

He raised an eyebrow and saw a Jade Court Guard waiting at the foot of the steps. The guard, clad in white armor, was stationed permanently on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. His surname was Dou; he was, technically speaking, a distant cousin. His father, Dou Yi, had been one of his own father’s most trusted men. The Dou clan had been in decline in recent years, and Li Zhouwei had sent the young man here as a gesture of goodwill and support.

“What is it?” Li Ximing asked.

The guard, having served for a year, had grown somewhat accustomed to his master’s sudden appearances and disappearances, but he still jumped in fright. He quickly bowed. “Reporting to the Daoist Master! The Young Lord came by. He said he has an urgent matter to report.”

“Send him up.”

Li Ximing sat down and took out the recipe for the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill to study it. Li Jiangqian arrived shortly, holding a letter.

“Reporting to the Daoist Master,” he said respectfully. “A letter from the Azure Pond Sect.”

Li Ximing nodded and took it. Li Jiangqian had reported to him nearly every time he had been away, and they had become familiar with the routine. The young man proceeded to report on the family’s various affairs.

Li Jiangqian’s management style was clearly different from Li Zhouwei’s. His father would handle everything meticulously and rarely disturbed him. This young man, however, came up the mountain more frequently. He would provide a concise, rapid, and accurate overview of the family’s operations and progress. Li Ximing would listen casually, gaining a general understanding of the clan’s state, and was often asked for his input on various matters.

Li Zhouwei was already the White Qilin of the Li family, one of the few who could consult with Li Ximing as an equal. But Li Jiangqian, as a member of the younger generation, was eager to make an impression on the family’s Daoist Master, hoping to strengthen his own authority. Li Ximing saw this clearly and permitted his visits every time.
