# Chapter 948, Sun-Worshipping Mountain

His question broke her silence. Kong Tingyun bowed.

"Thank you for your concern, my lord… But when my Ancestral Master fell, no one was left in the sect to bear the burden. Countless contingencies were laid. This matter of our mountain gate… it may have been promised to another family long ago. It requires careful consideration… I must consult with old friends."

Wei Xuanyin turned his head and smiled. "That is only natural. We will bring your people back first. As for your territory, Martial Nephew Qi will arrange it."

Qi Lanyan nodded with a smile and gestured for Kong Tingyun to follow.

"Daoist friend, please… come to my side pavilion first. I will fetch the records for you to review. Much has happened in Jiangbei these past few years. Once you are caught up, I will accompany you."

Kong Tingyun could only nod in agreement and withdraw quietly. Qi Lanyan turned back and sighed.

"That Daoist Master Changxi… he was always a shrewd schemer, just held in check by that person. To have a change of heart in his later years and manage to produce a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from his remaining resources… I truly miscalculated. If I had known Kong Tingyun would be this useful, I would have met with Changxi long ago."

"You are not to blame."

Wei Xuanyin unrolled a scroll, picked up his brush, and said quietly,

"We can only adapt to the situation. Fortunately, it isn't a major issue. If anyone is at fault, it should be me. I visited Maha Liangli of the Sea of Desire that year to inquire about his injuries and actually heard of this Changxi. Who could have imagined that a washed-up rogue cultivator from a ruined household could have prepared such a contingency?"

"Whether he was guessing blindly or had true foresight, he has ultimately handed us leverage. And this Kong Tingyun is a smart woman. We hold the complete set of divine abilities that match her cultivation, and we control the political tide of the north and south…"

"By following us, she can connect with the Immortal Dao's Viewing Pavilion, reconnect her Dao Lineage, obtain vast resources, and reclaim her mountain gate. Without us, her only choice is to betray her own heritage and destroy her future. She would become an exile, or be forced to bow her head in humiliation to the Supreme Yang, becoming a demonic cultivator who must devour others to survive. She will see the truth clearly."

Clearly, the master of the Profound Governance Pavilion had known about Daoist Master Changxi all along; he had just been playing along with his Martial Nephew. Qi Lanyan lowered his head and said respectfully,

"In truth, we have many pretexts. We don't need her. It's simply that she is the most convenient, and this pretext is the most righteous and justifiable. It's the one most likely to make the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition lose their footing and alienate their allies."

Wei Xuanyin frowned.

"Bai Ziyu… was he involved back then as well?"

Qi Lanyan nodded silently, looking at his Martial Uncle seated above.

"It's good to have another person to deploy. It will keep Jiangbei from having only his voice. As for the history between those two, even if they cooperate, they will never be true allies. It creates a balance, making them easier for you to manage."

Qi Lanyan quickly assented, offered his thanks, and withdrew.

...

Eastern Sea.

A blazing Heavenly Light and a hazy azure light approached from the west. The Demon King Qingyan's gaze was deep and thoughtful, while Li Ximing was silent, a hidden worry clouding his features.

After leaving Zhu Gong, Li Ximing knew the situation had mostly escalated into a problem for the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. As he waited for Zhu Gong to take the pill, he began to plan.

'Regardless, I have no news, and I can't just wait here idly. I must settle the matter of the pill as soon as possible, and then make a trip to Qize.'

He retrieved the Yuan'e Soft Armor from the lake, gathered some more valuable spiritual materials and dharma artifacts, and then went to Tiger's Frontier to retrieve Qingyan.

Before long, a man in white robes rode the wind to meet them, asking with a hint of anxiety, "Daoist friends… how did it go?"

The moment Liu Changdie saw the Demon King Qingyan's expression, he understood. But then he noticed Li Ximing still looked troubled, which confused him. He asked cautiously, only to see Li Ximing force a smile.

"The pill is a success!"

A heavy stone lifted from Liu Changdie's heart. If the refinement had failed, he truly wouldn't have known how to face Fuxun. Not only would his own conscience have bothered him, but it would have created a deep awkwardness between Fuxun and Li Ximing.

As Liu Changdie relaxed, Li Ximing also adjusted his mindset.

'At least that trouble is their trouble to bear. My own crisis is still in the north. I need to focus on my own affairs…'

He offered his congratulations, and then the man and the demon rode the wind, taking flight. After flying for a while, a thought struck Li Ximing. He turned serious and said,

"I have many pressing matters on the mainland. Since the pill is finished, I won't make the extra trip. I must ask you two Daoist friends to deliver it for me."

After all, he had obtained his Radiant Fire and refined the necessary pill. There was no need to travel thousands of miles to Poluoduo. He took out the jade vial, sealed with a divine ability, and handed it to Liu Changdie, saying gravely,

"Be careful on your journey!"

Liu Changdie had already noticed his expression was off. Although he felt it would be better for Li Ximing to be present to personally receive the thanks for such a favor, he didn't press the issue. He sighed and replied,

"You've worked hard… Don't forget what I mentioned before, about the nurturing spiritual resources."

Li Ximing certainly hadn't forgotten; the Neck Feathers were an excellent item. He seized the opportunity and immediately asked,

"After you go to Poluoduo… will you be busy with other important matters, Senior?"

Liu Changdie stroked his beard and laughed.

"I'm just an idler. What could I possibly be busy with? If you can arrange the time, I'll wait for you at Fenkuai. As it happens, I've just negotiated a formation repair job there, so I'll have plenty of time. Whenever you're free, just find me at the usual place."

Liu Changdie was genuinely kind. Of all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators Li Ximing knew, not one had ever offered to help him and then waited patiently. Li Ximing was deeply moved.

"Thank you, Senior!"

Liu Changdie shook his head with a smile and, together with Qingyan, strode into the Great Void. Li Ximing rode his light, speeding all the way, and soon arrived in Wu State.

This wasn't Li Ximing's first visit to Wu State, but he had never been to its southernmost region, Qize. He saw a vast, dark, and gloomy swamp. The morning sun was rising, its light reflecting in the fragmented wetlands below, creating countless golden shimmers.

He flew for a while and finally spotted Sun-Worshipping Mountain. It was hardly tall; in Jiangnan, it would barely pass for a hill. There were few buildings, scattered sparsely on the barren slope, giving it none of the aura of an immortal abode.

The moment he landed, someone came to greet him and led him to the summit. A wave of heat washed over him as expected. Fierce flames raged, and a great cauldron stood at the peak, glowing with crimson light.

Dingyang Zi came to welcome him with a look of surprise.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing! A rare guest indeed!"

He stretched out his hand, tossed the item he was holding to several attendant cultivators, and led Li Ximing down to a small building on the side.

The building was extremely crude, looking as if it had been scorched by fire a couple of times. It wasn't pleasant to look at, containing only a few tables and chairs. Dingyang Zi poured some tea and asked,

"Daoist friend, is the pill finished?"

In person, the old man's speech was not as fluid or eloquent as it was in his letters; he seemed quite stiff. Li Ximing didn't bother with pleasantries either. He took a jade box from his sleeve and gently pushed it across the table.

Dingyang Zi lifted the lid, examined the contents closely, and finally broke into a smile.

"Daoist friend, your alchemy skills are truly formidable!"

Li Ximing replied with a smile, understanding that this Daoist Master wasn't one for small talk or flattery. He was all business. Li Ximing revealed a suit of gleaming scale armor in his hand, cupped his fist, and said,

"Senior, please take a look at this!"

Dingyang Zi looked quite satisfied. He put away the pill from the box and took the Yuan'e Soft Armor. He first swept it with a divine ability, then infused it with dharma power, causing the scales to stand on end.

He frowned.

"Gloom-Profound Sky Iron, Radiant Core Stone, Wolf Scale Bone, and Bright White Feather. Refined with True Fire."

With just a single glance, he had identified every material used to forge the scale armor. He turned it over twice and said bluntly,

"Aside from the Gloom-Profound Sky Iron, not a single one of these materials is worthy of note. The refinement technique, however, is passable."

Li Ximing wasn't surprised, just inwardly bitter.

When the Li family first acquired this dharma armor, it was treated as an incredible treasure. But from his current perspective, he could see that unless it was an ancient dharma artifact, it was ultimately lacking. Moreover, this item was originally modified from the helmet of a Murong cultivator's Gloom-Profound Armor. The Azure Pond cultivator assigned to reforge it... aside from the Gloom-Profound Sky Iron that was part of the original, why would they have added any other good materials?

He couldn't help but shake his head. "In your opinion, Daoist friend, how can this be improved?"

Dingyang Zi examined it again.

"As it is... it's barely qualified to be refined into a spirit embryo. Other than the Gloom-Profound Sky Iron, the rest of it can't be kept. It would be better to melt it down, extract the Gloom-Profound Sky Iron, and re-forge it completely..."

Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then touched his storage pouch. A pile of glittering items spilled out onto the table. Dingyang Zi swept his sleeve, picking out only a few of them.

Two of them were congratulatory gifts from other families when Li Zhouwei reached the Purple Mansion Realm; the ones he selected were both from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, Radiant Wildscale and Magnificent Raiment Stone-Bone. The other two items were a saber and a spear, both ancient dharma artifacts, the Circlet Spike and the Bright-Flame Saber—dharma artifacts of the Secret Diffusion Dao Lineage, taken from Bai Yinzi.

'Only these items are presentable…'

Dingyang Zi picked up the Bright-Flame Saber and praised it, then turned back.

"If we break these items down, we can gather enough materials. As for the rest, that will depend on your clan. With only these, and without any Purple Mansion-grade materials, it will never touch the level of a Spiritual Artifact. At best, we can customize a high-quality dharma artifact for you to refine into a spirit embryo."

Fortunately, Li Ximing had come precisely to discuss this in advance. He said seriously,

"I'm showing you the style today because I want the new one crafted like this scale armor. I know you haven't finished refining your Spiritual Artifact, so this is still a ways off. If you have any suitable materials on hand, or if you come across anything appropriate while trading with other cultivators... please acquire them for my family. This is a long-term plan!"

Dingyang Zi stroked his beard, nodding thoughtfully.

"I do have a small portion of Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold on hand. It was left over from forging a sword accessory for a sword immortal. It's marginally suitable, but it is extremely valuable… As for Bright Yang spiritual materials or resources… I have none."

"There's no rush." The Li family possessed a Purple Mansion-grade resource, also a type of scale, gifted by the Kong family, but unfortunately, it was of the Pit Water attribute and unusable. Li Ximing took a brocade box from his sleeve, revealing a pearl-like white stone inside. "This is a Six-Phase Spirit Stone of the 'True Qi' path," he said in a low voice. "It is suitable for all True Qi Daos and should be useful as an alternative."

Only then did Dingyang Zi show a hint of consideration. Li Ximing let him look before putting it away and taking out another box. Inside lay three long, metallic-looking white feathers. Li Ximing said seriously,

"These are Neck Feathers. I will leave them with you as a deposit. First, to show my sincerity. Second… if anyone comes to you to forge a treasure, and you see they have suitable spiritual resources, please trade for them on my behalf!"

Li Ximing understood clearly. Just as he, an Alchemist, frequently encountered consumable Purple Mansion-grade resources, Dingyang Zi must encounter far more refinement materials than he ever could. Rather than searching to the ends of the earth, it was better to trade with him! Since he had already agreed to design the armor, Li Ximing decided to swallow his pride and entrust the matter to him.

Dingyang Zi saw his intention and took the jade box. The two exchanged jade talismans, and the old man stroked his beard.

"I understand..."

Li Ximing smiled and said quietly, "If there is anything I can help you with, Daoist friend, please don't hesitate to ask..."

His tone then shifted, becoming serious.

"But the 'Upper Shaman' spirit embryo you promised me back then... is there any news?"

Dingyang Zi shook his head.

"How could it be that fast!"

Li Ximing had used the Viewing Pavilion faction's rapid refinement method, accelerated with a spiritual extract from the Xiukui Dao. Dingyang Zi was from a different Daoist Tradition and certainly wouldn't use such precious extracts for him, so of course it would take much, much longer. As Li Ximing realized this, he felt a pang of regret.

'I faced two major crises in a row and was forced to create the spirit embryo ahead of schedule. It cost me two portions of the Shield of White Sun spiritual extract… If I hadn't been in such a hurry then, I could have used those two portions for this armor instead…'

But before he could dwell on it, a sound came from outside the pavilion. Dingyang Zi excused himself and quickly welcomed someone in. The old man's expression changed instantly, becoming cold and hostile. "He's right here," he snapped. "Ask him yourself!"

Li Ximing looked at the person who entered. With a full head of gray hair and wearing black robes covered in brown circular holes, he was instantly recognizable. Li Ximing smiled. "Daoist Friend Luo! Have you been well?"

"So it's Brother Zhaojing!" The man was none other than the demonic cultivator from the Southern Borderlands, Daoist Master Luo. He looked pleased to see him, then sized him up in astonishment. "It truly is the Dao of Proliferation. Your dharma body... it's already fully healed!"

Daoist Master Luo had probably assumed he wouldn't have been willing to use the pill. Li Ximing had taken it, but he wasn't about to reveal his wealth. He just laughed it off. Sure enough, Daoist Master Luo was indeed after the spirit embryo. "I've passed by this place several times and seen that treasure on the altar… I'm truly envious…"

But Li Ximing suddenly remembered something. He cut him off with a smile, not giving him time to ask any more questions. "Daoist friend, take a look at this!"

He produced an item in his hand. Inside a box, layers of flowing clouds concealed a faint, yellowish-white light. It was the Marvelous Wisdom Whisker gifted by Liu Changdie!

The Marvelous Wisdom Whisker was a spiritual item of the 'Gathering Wood' Dao. And in all of Jiangnan, the only cultivator of a 'Gathering Wood' Dao Lineage that Li Ximing knew was Daoist Master Luo himself.

As expected, when Daoist Master Luo saw the spiritual item, his smiling eyes froze. He stared at it intently for a moment, then said with astonishment,

"Marvelous Wisdom Whisker… Daoist friend, have you been to the Western Sea?"

These Purple Mansion Realm figures all had deep knowledge of their own Dao Lineage's origins. He had hit the nail on the head. Li Ximing was unwilling to mention Liu Changdie, so he just said, "I acquired it by chance. Can you use it, Daoist friend?"

"To say I can't use it... that would be impossible." Daoist Master Luo seemed to be studying its quality. He finally spoke, his voice absent-minded, his eyes never leaving the spiritual resource.

"Put yourself in my shoes, Daoist friend. If you saw a Bright Yang spiritual resource, even if you had no immediate use for it, wouldn't you want to acquire it? It's just a matter of price..."

Li Ximing knew the man was cunning and smiled inwardly. He snapped the jade box shut and sighed.

"I see... I just thought it was a rare chance to run into you, and I happened to have a spiritual resource from your path! But it seems you have no use for it right now!"
