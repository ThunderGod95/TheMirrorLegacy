# Chapter 930: The Harmonising and Vault Lock

Li Ximing's spirits soared, a sense of quiet relief washing over him. He smiled reservedly, nodding, and sighed inwardly:

‘This is exactly the kind of Radiant Fire I needed! It couldn't be more convenient.’

Though he possessed the Intercalary Sun Art, which allowed him to convert most spiritual flames, he had used it only a few times back in the Foundation Establishment Realm. The last time, when he converted his family's Long-March Pheasant Flame, the cost was immense, leaving him with a deep-seated ache in his wallet.

At the Purple Mansion Realm, the cost of such a conversion would be astronomical. If it required precious Purple Mansion-level resources to assist, the trouble would be even greater, making the whole affair less than ideal.

Moreover, there were only a finite number of spiritual flames in the world. Using the Intercalary Sun Art too often would inevitably draw unwanted attention. The fact that Huo Yang, a cultivator of Radiant Fire, could simply offer a suitable flame was a double blessing!

He stared at the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame, unable to tear his eyes away. Spiritual flames were treasures coveted by all, and the Demon beast and Liu Changdie next to him immediately cast envious glances.

The pill had yet to be refined, so the Radiant Fire should have been in Fuxun's care. However, due to Liu Changdie's presence, Fuxun didn't step forward to receive the flame. He hesitated in place, making no move, clearly showing respect and intending to let Li Ximing take it directly.

Huo Yang glanced at the two and held the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame suspended in her palm, speaking in a measured tone.

"The Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame is not known for its destructive power among Radiant Fires. It cannot compare to first-rate flames like the Incinerating Radiant Fire of the Fold or the Heavenly Apricot Rain, but it surpasses others like the Fatal Intercalary Flame and the Violent Proclamation Karma Flame. Purely in terms of power, it is a mid-tier flame."

"However, its true marvel lies in its ability to break through baleful influences and disrupt balanced spiritual energy. It rejects nothing, merging and refining all kinds of chaotic Radiant Fire Qi and Baleful Earth, burning them into nothingness."

"But its greatest fame comes from the spiritual essence of the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame itself."

When it came to understanding True Fires and Radiant Fires, no one present could compare to Huo Yang. Both Li Ximing and Fuxun listened intently as the woman continued.

"Among all Radiant Fires, the Red Pheasant is the most spiritual—that is, this Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame. It can be commanded and even questioned. You can send it to perform tasks or fight enemies. This spiritual essence is innately formed and cannot be increased or decreased. It is extremely potent…"

"No matter how powerful a secret art is used to extinguish its spiritual essence, it will slowly recover. Yet, everything has its pros and cons. The inability to increase or decrease is not an empty phrase. Not a single extra shred of spiritual essence can be added. Even if it gains some fortune and its essence grows, it will slowly weaken back to its original state. Since ancient times, many have cultivated spiritual flames to become spiritual practitioners, but never the Red Pheasant. This is precisely why."

Li Ximing pondered this, nodding with great interest. The nearby Liu Changdie also seemed to gain some insight. After explaining the benefits, Huo Yang looked slightly awkward, continuing,

"The Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame is a Radiant Fire, and it has the usual temperament of one. It is not suited for pill-refining or artifact-crafting. Although you have already reached the Purple Mansion Realm and your alchemy is astonishing, it is not impossible to use the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame to refine a pill... it simply offers no benefit."

This was why she felt awkward. In the eyes of others, an Alchemist seeking a flame would naturally want one that aids in pill-refining. Taking out a genuine Radiant Fire like this, with its specific temperament, seemed like a waste.

But Li Ximing needed a Radiant Fire for his own purposes, so he listened intently. Huo Yang continued:

"As for its use in spell arts, it fears no earth virtue save for the Sheji. It can oppose the water virtue and incinerate metal and stone. But those are matters of Daoist tradition and need not be discussed."

The tiny apricot-colored bird perched on Huo Yang's fingertip surveyed the surroundings, its gaze soon settling on Li Ximing, where it remained. Li Ximing suspected that the Valley Wind Guide-Fire was working its magic, and not wanting to reveal any strangeness, he simply said with a joyful expression:

"I am truly grateful for your generosity, fellow Daoist!"

As soon as he spoke, the little apricot-colored bird floated up and landed in his palm. It felt only lukewarm, and he could even feel the soft, trembling feathers of the bird.

‘Finally! The Great Radiance of White Brilliance has been gathering dust for so many years; now I can finally cultivate it!’

Without a second thought, Li Ximing moved his mind.

*Valley Wind Guide-Fire!*

Huo Yang had already erased her brand on the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame. It offered no real resistance, and in an instant, Li Ximing refined it, truly making it his spiritual flame.

He flipped his hand, and the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame disappeared, reappearing within his Dharma Body. It broke through the raging purple flames and settled within the Juque Palace.

The Juque Palace had originally been the domain of the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire. The two spiritual flames, both at the Purple Mansion level, should have clashed, but they didn't even manage to produce a single spark. The wondrous Talisman Qi immediately went to work, and the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire instantly subdued itself, obediently dividing its territory in half for the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame.

And so, the Juque Palace was now half apricot-red and half a true red tinged with gold, with a clear boundary separating them.

The other three Purple Mansion cultivators did not notice this fluctuation. They didn't even think he had refined the flame, only that he had used some unique method to store it. Huo Yang smiled, seizing the moment to turn to Fuxun and say:

"I leave the future of our Zhuluo Kingdom in your hands, senior."

With Li Ximing having already obtained the spiritual flame, Fuxun would have feared he would turn and run if it weren't for the reassurance of Liu Changdie. At the moment, he had no mind to say more. He nodded silently, indicating he had accepted the task, and said no more.

Huo Yang, seeing his distracted state, did not delay. She escorted them all the way out of the great array. Before they departed, she looked at Li Ximing with a hint of anticipation.

"I hear that a messenger of yours is coming to Poluoduo. If you have the opportunity, you can leave a message for me in the Zhuluo Kingdom. If I acquire some good spiritual resources in the future, I hope you will grace me with your presence and refine a pill for me."

"Of course… of course."

Other pills might be difficult, but a Radiant Fire pill would be more than enough for Li Ximing. Since it was something he would benefit from, he naturally wouldn't refuse. He patted his chest and agreed, after which the group set off back to the Xipo Kingdom.

"Congratulations, Ximing!"

When they arrived at the Great Void, Liu Changdie immediately offered his congratulations. Li Ximing was also overjoyed to have the spiritual flame in his possession, so much so that he was a little absent-minded. For one, he wanted to test the power and marvel of the Radiant Fire. For another, he wanted to begin cultivating the Great Radiance of White Brilliance.

But he still remembered Fuxun's matter and did not appear too smug. He shook his head and said in a low voice:

"Not yet. It will only be worth celebrating after fellow Daoist Fuxun's pill has been refined!"

At these words, Fuxun's smile became noticeably more genuine. He led them back on their way, and Li Ximing said:

"I'll have to borrow a Purple Mansion Spiritual Cauldron, which means a trip back to Jiangnan. Senior Changdie…"

"Just call me fellow Daoist!"

When talk turned to returning to Jiangnan, Liu Changdie's expression clearly soured. He fell silent, and it took him a while to reply.

"I'm not afraid of you knowing, Ximing… As a rogue cultivator, my ability to reach the Purple Mansion Realm naturally came from a great fortune. Back in my youth, I was reckless and didn't know the immensity of the world. I stumbled and struggled, coming all the way from Jiangnan, believing that everything was going smoothly. In reality, I was walking on a tightrope over a pool of hellfire. Pitifully, the ignorant fear nothing, and I was completely unaware of the danger!"

After he spoke, both Li Ximing and Fuxun were silent. The fortune was self-evident. It was impossible for a rogue cultivator to reach the Purple Mansion Realm without one. The likes of Yehui and Changxiao had only achieved the Purple Mansion Realm after gaining a fortune within a grotto heaven!

Liu Changdie clasped his hands behind his back and said quietly:

"Later, after I had seen a few things and left Jiangnan for the Southern Sea, I finally achieved a divine ability. When I looked back, I realized the dangers of my path… I thought I had done everything perfectly, but which of those high and mighty divine ability users was truly unaware? All the way along, the various Purple Mansion cultivators and Supreme Yang Daoist tradition who silently watched from the sidelines, and even the seniors on the lake… they all knew!"

"These Purple Mansion cultivators chose to ignore me simply because the karma on me was too great, and they didn't dare to get involved."

His expression was desolate as he said softly:

"Now that I know the truth, I am even more afraid to go back. What is the mainland? A place where divine ability users walk everywhere and True Monarchs manifest their presence. The spiritual essence has changed three times in a century, and the North and South are like a chessboard… it is the center of the world's winds and clouds. The more unique a person is, the more they dare not venture into its depths!"

His words were not without reason, and Li Ximing fell silent.

‘Who is it not the same for? If my family did not have the bloodline of the Bright Yang, what reason would we have had to rise so quickly on the lake? We would have long been wiped out by the divine ability users of the North and South. But precisely because of the Bright Yang bloodline, the suspicions of all the world's divine ability users have been assuaged, but it has also confined my family to this single square on the board, unable to move!’

He suddenly thought of Yehui. Li Ximing paused for a moment and asked:

"While the North and South are the center of the world's storms, they are also the location of its greatest fortunes. Now that you have achieved a divine ability, with a lifespan of five hundred years and a profound fortune, do you not have the ambition to ascend to the top?"

Liu Changdie remained silent for a long time, then said with a note of melancholy:

"You see my divine ability, but can you recognize its dao?"

This had long been a question for Li Ximing. Most dao, once seen, are hard to hide. A slight display of power would be noticed by others. But Liu Changdie's aura had been contained from beginning to end, his divine ability never revealed. It was impossible to tell what it was!

Seeing Li Ximing shake his head, Liu Changdie raised his hand and revealed his palm. A single silver orb of light was dancing within it, constantly switching and leaping between square and circular forms, radiating a profound and mystical aura.

Li Ximing looked at it closely, then said, "I have never heard of it, nor seen it… it seems to be of the Metal Virtue…"

"Correct!"

Liu Changdie's expression was complex. He said in a low voice:

"The cultivation manual I practice is the *Manual of the Daoist Profound Succession*, which I obtained from the ruined cave dwelling of a fallen senior cultivator. It is a rank six manual, with a spiritual qi known as Profound-Lock Daoist Metal Qi. It was born from the Profound-Daoist Vault Metal being illuminated by the Supreme Yang. This is a thing that has been severed not just in the present age, but since the Middle Ages!"

"At the time, how could I have ever seen such a powerful thing? I eagerly took up the manual, deeming it a great treasure. I finally cultivated this Dao, and its power was so restrained that its uniqueness was not apparent. Ordinary people only thought my Immortal Foundation was good…"

"Back then, I was young and did not recognize my own Dao. I only knew that its rank was high and that it was precious. I dared not reveal it to others. I took on a different name for my Immortal Foundation and spent a great deal of money to buy several related Dharma Artifacts, using them to cast spells to pretend to be of another Dao…"

"I was cautious for many years, all the way until I broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm…"

He said wistfully:

"Ximing, do you know of the two metals outside the Three Metals?"

Li Ximing's heart skipped a beat.

The world had the Three Metals of Geng-Dui-Xiao (Wandering). This was something everyone knew. But the other two metals were not something the Li family knew much about, yet they were not completely ignorant. Back when Li Zhouwei went to the Thunder Pool to visit Li Qinghong, he had mentioned this matter.

Li Qinghong's identity was special, and she could no longer easily meet with Li family members. But Li Zhouwei had later recounted to him:

‘The Harmonising Metal that the Wang clan's Daoist Master took away that year was one of the two metals. These two Daos have long been severed, difficult to cultivate and impossible to prove. For a thousand years, the number of Purple Mansion cultivators of these two Daos could be counted on one hand. They were all geniuses who mistakenly entered this crooked path, and all perished during the early stages of the Purple Mansion Realm!’

Li Ximing said in a daze:

"You cultivate the Harmonising Metal?!"

The words Harmonising Metal coming from Li Ximing's mouth were clearly unexpected for Liu Changdie. He was slightly stunned, then shook his head with a sigh.

"You have a good eye, Ximing. It seems you know quite a bit… Although I don't cultivate the Harmonising Metal, it is one of the two metals—it is the Vault Metal."

"The Vault Metal…"

Li Ximing's heart was filled with an indescribable mixture of emotions. The nearby Fuxun sighed softly, evidently having known this for a long time. He turned away and said nothing. After a moment of silence, Li Ximing asked:

"Could it be that the inheritance you received from the ancestor… was only this one divine ability?"

Liu Changdie nodded, saying wistfully:

"Exactly. It's much more than just that… In the world today, even the Foundation Establishment Realm manuals for the Harmonising and Vault Metals are harder to find than the Purple Mansion manuals of ordinary Daoist traditions!"

Li Ximing frowned, asking:

"How could it be like this…"

Liu Changdie sighed.

"Because the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was born long after the two metals, the Harmonising and Vault, could no longer be cultivated! Why would the various Daoist traditions study a Dao that is fundamentally uncultivable? Only a few people who refused to give up would try to change it. How could everything be preserved through the passage of time?"

At this point, he could no longer remain calm. Gritting his teeth, he said:

"Thinking back now, how could a remnant from before the Middle Ages have such a simple array? How could a mere junior like me have obtained it? This was a scheme! Someone's scheme! A truly magnificent scheme!"

Li Ximing froze for a moment, and then everything became clear in his mind.

‘He obtained some kind of fortune, perhaps like Ling Yanzi that year, it connected him to some terrifyingly powerful being. As a result, they couldn't calculate his fate or harm him directly, for fear of some unknown consequences…’

‘So they created a so-called ancestral remains, leaving behind some treasures that were extremely valuable to a Qi Refining cultivator, along with a Vault Metal manual. Then they used it as a public test!’

Indeed, even a good-natured person like Liu Changdie could not help but speak in a cold voice now.

"This cultivation manual leads to a severed Dao. Not only do the elite cultivators not know about it, but even ordinary Purple Mansion cultivators are ignorant. They would even think it's precious. How could a mere Qi Refining junior refuse it?!"

"And to make sure I would fall for it, they even took out such a high-rank manual. What's more, the spiritual qi, the Profound-Lock Daoist Metal Qi, is something that the Profound-Daoist Vault Metal can continuously give birth to when illuminated by the Supreme Yang. For those who have it, it is a continuous source. For those who don't, it's as precious as the heavens…"

He stopped abruptly at this point.

They were both young Purple Mansion cultivators. Even Li Ximing, who had no great ambition, held the thought of passing the Purple Mystery trial. How could they accept that they would only ever have one divine ability in this life? The hatred in their hearts was hard to articulate. Only Fuxun, unable to watch any longer, sighed and said:

"There is always a way out. Even if no one for a thousand years has been able to cultivate it, perhaps the key lies with you… Don't be so pessimistic…"

While they spoke, the group had already returned to the Xipo Kingdom and sat in the previous pavilion. The night had already fallen. The brilliant five-hued light shone brightly all around. Fuxun poured wine for Liu Changdie, who drank it in a single gulp, and said in a low voice:

"You don't understand. The fall of a thousand-year genius is not without reason… I cultivate the *Manual of the Daoist Profound Succession*, and I have also occasionally gained some minor fortunes. Now that I have my Purple Mansion divine ability, I can sense the Harmonising and Vault Metals, and only now do I understand a few things."

"The two Daos of Harmonising and Vault already had occupants. Two True Monarchs left long ago, venturing beyond the heavens. But not everyone has the magnanimity of Tianwu, who allows later generations to ascend. These two wished to preserve their Fruition Attainment, so that if something were to change outside the heavens, they could, by some miracle, reincarnate and return. So the two True Monarchs worked together to cast a divine art, connecting their Fruition Attainments…"

He said in a low voice:

"There are three Metal Virtues: Geng, Wandering, and Dui. Of the remaining two Daos, Harmonising Metal is the metal that collects, and Vault Metal is the metal that is collected. The two True Monarchs merged their Fruition Attainments, taking one as the other's Dao fruit, and they actually stored the Vault Metal's Fruition Attainment like an object within the Harmonising Metal's Fruition Attainment!"

"And with that, the collected metal was collected, and the collecting metal was completed. The lock was linked, forming **[The Harmonising and Vault Lock]**. Who can prove it? Who can prove it? It's harder than ascending to the heavens!"

"To put it bluntly, after the Harmonising and Vault Lock, it is a far more brilliant scheme than merely a severed Dao. Not even conversion is possible anymore. The one who seeks to prove this Dao must not only prove their status, but must also, with their own power, separate the mutual lock between the two Dao fruits that not even True Monarchs could separate for thousands of years."

He laughed mockingly.

"How hard is that? I don't need to tell you."

Liu Changdie truly had a great fortune. Now, he regarded both Li Ximing and Fuxun as his closest companions, so he spilled all these secrets in one go. Both Li Ximing and Fuxun were too shocked to speak for a time.

It was not until Liu Changdie had drunk several cups of wine and the jug was empty that Fuxun finally sighed.

"I heard others say that the world has three metals, and it has always been so. I never thought the true secret lay here!"

With this burden off his chest, Liu Changdie slowly relaxed, laughing at himself.

"I am no longer willing to return to Jiangnan… but the Vault Metal divine ability still holds many wonders. I can always help Ximing. What I cultivated is the Vault-Beam Silver. Putting aside other things, opening up some array or secret vault, or nurturing some Golden Essence resources… those are no problem."

"I have no family left. Even if I did… they would have long since passed away. I've roamed the world for a century, all alone, with a severed path. I have nothing but a lot of trouble, and I am not easy to command. But when it comes to doing something wondrous, you can always come to me."

Li Ximing could only console him in a low voice, sighing inwardly for him. He knew that Liu Changdie would never return to Jiangnan now. He also abandoned the thought of asking him to take a look at the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array. Instead, he simply said,

"The two of you wait a moment. I'll go back to Jiangnan for a bit."

Fuxun was naturally full of anticipation. He escorted Li Ximing out of the Xipo Kingdom and then returned with the wind, seeing Liu Changdie still drinking in the pavilion. He could not help but sigh,

"It's rare to see you willing to say so much!"

Liu Changdie just shook his head silently. Now that Li Ximing was gone, he could finally let his emotions show. His eyes were filled with loss and unease.

"In this life, I've achieved a divine ability, and I'll enjoy five hundred years… but I can't return to my hometown, and all my family and friends are gone. If you, Ximing, had not become a Purple Mansion cultivator, I would have certainly stayed at this Sea's Cape, dealing with demon beasts until I died of old age…"

He only said half of what was on his mind. What he was truly thinking about was his hundred years of a fulfilling life in a previous life, with a wife and children. After a long while, he said,

"This divine ability… is quite a price to pay!"

Fuxun refilled his cup. Instead of being sad, he laughed.

"Isn't it so? For a divine ability, I can dig out my father's heart from his corpse to refine into a pill. Not only to refine pills, but to eat the rest of his body completely. What of all else?"

"The fact that you can have this thought today is likely because your Dao has been severed. If it weren't for this, how could you even make a comparison? The Dao, divine ability, Fruition Attainment… they are all precious things. Precious enough that nothing else can compare!"
