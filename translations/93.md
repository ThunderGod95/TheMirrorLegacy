# Chapter 94: Planning an Escape

Li Xuanling had to labor within the stronghold for over ten days. While the other slaves were whining in exhaustion, he was doing well thanks to his cultivation at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He only had to feign weariness to blend in.

The living conditions for slaves were dire, confined within an enclosure reminiscent of a sheep pen, where human waste accumulated in heaps and the air was thick with foul odors. The area was closely guarded by over a dozen Mount Yue soldiers, making any thought of escape daunting.

Li Xuanling desperately wanted to escape by the end of the first day, yet he stayed for over ten days, hoping to hear from Li Jingtian.

Mount Yue appeared to be in the process of building a huge stronghold for the purpose of surveillance and countering the Li Family.

Surveying the layout, Li Xuanling considered his escape options. He concluded that the best time to escape was when moving the woods outside the stronghold. As long as he was far away from the experts in the stronghold, a swift elimination of a few soldiers would secure his escape.

Although it’s easy for me to just leave, it’d be very difficult for Big Sister to escape.

Li Jingtian’s frequent movements in and out of the command tent made Li Xuanling extremely nervous. He always tried to linger around the area, hoping to find a chance to take Li Jingtian away.

As Li Xuanling carried wood around the stronghold, he quietly observed his surroundings and eavesdropped on a conversation between two Mount Yue shamans.

“We’re setting off for the Great Jueting tomorrow, aren’t we?”

“Indeed... Rumor has it that the Great King has plans to erect a huge stone platform there to perform a shamanic ceremony in order to commemorate the unification of the northern foothills.”

“After centuries of turmoil, it seems we’re on the brink of a new era of stability.”

Li Xuanling was taken aback by what he had heard.

I must take action, regardless. Once we’re taken into the great city of Mount Yue tomorrow, there will be no escape!

After carefully placing down the wood he was carrying, Li Xuanling reached into his clothing to consult the mirror concealed within. He quickly located Li Jingtian and promptly headed toward her direction.

Lu Jiangxian was perplexed as he observed the situation through the mirror. As Li Xuanling advanced westward, a mysterious energy seemed to connect with him from afar.

Lu Jiangxian sensed the powerful presence that stood out like a beacon in the night in surprise.

How could this be? Talisman qi?!

The source of this familiar aura from the distant mountain was none other than a talisman qi. Lu Jiangxian was certain that it was one that was bestowed by the mirror.

It was not the gray talisman in Li Xiangping, but a shimmering, yellow one.

The mirror’s talisman qi included various colors—gray, white, blue, yellow... Each of them corresponded to different cultivation realms—Qi Cultivation, Foundation Establishment, Purple Mansion, and Golden Core respectively...

This yellow talisman was condensed by the mirror through offerings and incense of the Golden Core stage.

As Li Xuanling pressed on, Lu Jiangxian managed to connect with the talisman qi but remained cautious in his approach.

This is...

Lu Jiangxian fell into a brief contemplative silence before a name slowly appeared in his mind...

The Disciple of the Immortal Mansion, Li Jiangqun!

He quickly dismissed the thought amidst growing confusion.

Li Jiangqun was merely a cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm when he was pursued by the cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm from the three sects and seven gates. How could he possibly possess a yellow talisman within him? The process requires not just a corpse of the Golden Core Realm, but the sacrifice of a living demonic creature and an immense amount of incense.

Lu Jiangxian could not figure out the puzzle, but he could sense danger in the air.

We must avoid the Great Jueting at all costs. It could be a den for demons awaiting their next victim. This incident involving Li Jiangqun is a prime example! The forces behind the mirror's pursuit aren’t limited to mere sects and gates. There’s a larger power at play.

Li Xuanling had been anxiously pacing outside the tent for quite some time before finally catching sight of Li Jingtian.

He had swapped duties with a slave who was responsible for delivering water and deliberately took his sweet time delivering the water toward the vat, all so that he could bump into Li Jingtian.

Li Jingtian, wearing beast leather, jade, and jewels, cast a discreet glance at Li Xuanling who was clumsily transporting water, and she suddenly said, “Hold on.”

The Mount Yue tribesmen following her around instantly smiled fawningly as they awaited further instruction from Li Jingtian.

“Include him as well,” she said.

Two of the tribesmen approached and led Li Xuanling away. Walking with his head bowed, Li Xuanling heard the two men chuckling.

“You’re fortunate, child. The general has agreed to let the young lady pick ten of her own slaves, and you’re the first one she picked.”

Realizing that Li Jingtian had found a means to communicate, Li Xuanling willingly followed them.

After a simple rinse of his body, Li Xuanling was unceremoniously shoved into Li Jingtian’s tent.

Those from Mount Yue paid little attention to etiquette, so Li Xuanling, still damp, stepped onto the mat and glanced around. To his relief, he saw only Li Jingtian inside and let out a soft sigh of relief.

Li Jingtian set aside what she was holding and hurried over, whispering urgently in his ear, “I’ve gathered information about Family Head!”

It turned out that over the past ten days, Li Xiangping had been pursued relentlessly to the west, deep into the territory of Mount Yue. He had been raiding Mount Yue villages and rallying desperate vagrants in Jianixi’s territories, causing significant unrest in the area.

Upon hearing of these disturbances, Jianixi, who was raiding the clans under the governance of the Golden Tang Gate in the north, ordered Mu Jiaoman to return there to suppress the troops. This was why they were departing tomorrow.

Li Xuanling was taken aback as he murmured in disbelief, “What is Family Head thinking...?”

As he snapped back to his senses, he whispered back, “Let’s not care about all of that first. Tonight, when the crescent moon is high, I’ll be gathering wood far from the stronghold. That’s when we’ll make our escape. I’ll create a distraction, and you’ll pretend to leave the tent to use the restroom. I’ll take care of the Mount Yue guards and then get you out of here.”

Li Jingtian, concerned, whispered back, “Will it really work? We must be wary of Mount Yue patrols.”

“Don't worry,” Li Xuanling reassured her confidently, “I’ve been monitoring the tents where those Mount Yue soldiers of the Embryonic Breathing Realm stay for days. They won’t be able to notice us.”

After a moment of consideration, Li Jingtian nodded firmly and said, “And if we draw the attention of a large number of soldiers...”

Li Xuanling paused for a moment before answering, “I’ll leave you behind and head east to draw them away.”

Li Jingtian shook her head, her voice gentle but firm as she said, “Mu Jiaoman wouldn’t do anything to me even if I were to be captured again. But you, with a spiritual orifice, are too valuable to take any chances with.”

Seeing Li Xuanling bowing his head in silence, Li Jingtian continued asking with a hint of concern in her voice, “And what if Mu Jiaoman personally comes after us...?”

“Being pursued by a general of the Qi Cultivation Realm?”

Li Xuanling’s hand brushed against the mirror hidden within his clothing. He was not that confident about Mu Jiaoman’s strength after getting struck by the Supreme Yin Profound Light.

“Given Mount Yue’s notorious reputation, the both of us will surely face dire consequences if captured! We’ll either be exploited and used to coerce our family.”

He locked eyes with Li Jingtian and gritted his teeth. With a tone as cold as steel, he declared, “If it ever comes to that... I’ll kill you first before killing myself!”
