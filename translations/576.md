# Chapter 893: Uncle And Nephew

Chi Fubo felt a chill run through in his heart at those words. His gaze swept around and landed on the young man behind him, who was silent with his head lowered.

He asked, "Yuanqin! What do you think..."

The young man behind him had sharp, long eyebrows and slightly narrow eyes. His expression was gloomy, his pupils grayish-black, his cheeks gaunt, and his aura dark. He was dressed in luxurious robes. It was none other than Li Yuanqin, son of Li Xuanfeng.

Li Yuanqin appeared momentarily dazed, with only one thought echoing inside, He’s dead?! How is that possible?!

The news that Li Xuanfeng had slaughtered the entire host of Buddhist cultivators came first, shocking the Azure Pond Sect disciples so much they thought it was a false rumor. Naturally, Li Yuanqin became the center of attention, but he didn’t care. Every time a battle report about Li Xuanfeng came in, it was always like this. He had long grown used to it.

But when news of Li Xuanfeng’s death spread the next day, all the cultivators breathed a sigh of relief. Though Ning Hejing stayed behind closed doors, Li Yuanqin knew this dear uncle of his was overjoyed. Some members of the Chi Family even laughed aloud; Li Yuanqin staying secluded was already a sign of restraint.

Although Chi Fubo had come to offer his condolences immediately, even with reddened eyes, Li Yuanqin had known him for many years, so how could he not know this man’s true nature? Even if he was not gleeful, he was at least relieved.

Li Yuanqin showed no change in expression. In fact, his heart felt empty. His confusion outweighed his grief, He’s dead? Even he could die?

That hollowness left him restless and uneasy, but fortunately, he had always been reserved and deep-minded. No one could see the slightest trace on his face. He drank when it was time to drink, and laughed when it was time to laugh.

Now, he calmly watched everyone panic with cold eyes. Not even Chi Zhiyan’s death stirred any emotion in him. His mind was blank, and facing Chi Fubo’s question, he thought for a moment.

But Ning Hejing leapt to his feet. This uncle didn’t even recognize his own nephew at first. It was only upon hearing the name that he reacted.

He bristled, letting out a grunt as he rose from his seat, glaring coldly. What kind of mess has Chi Fubo gotten us into now?!

Ning Hejing certainly knew that Li Yuanqin was close to the Chi Family, but in his heart, he didn’t trust Li Yuanqin at all. His study of the Li Family was thorough, to the point he held Yuanqin in contempt, The Li Family are ruthless and suspicious, as well as domineering and cruel. Yet they are also loyal and fraternal, willing to die for each other. They are the most venomous wolves! Li Xuanfeng was one, and so is Li Yuanjiao...

The only thing he truly resented about Yuan Su was overusing Li Xuanfeng, along with the nauseating Ning Heyuan who followed him, shamelessly calling him brother-in-law. Now that Ning Heyuan was dead, well, he was still a fellow clansman, so there was nothing more to say. But when it came to his nephew Li Yuanqin, he had absolutely no trust.

As for Li Yuanqin? Don't even think about it! He’s obviously pretending! People like him are cruel and cunning by nature. They’re skilled in manipulating hearts. That boy is born wicked, how could anyone trust him?

Even if, by some stretch, Li Yuanqin was one of them, what right did he have to be here? To put it nicely, he was a nephew. But bluntly, he was Li-blooded filth! His very lineage was tainted; he shouldn’t even be allowed inside this hall!

The truth was, he was Li Xuanfeng’s orphan. Li Xuanfeng had achieved much on the surface, which made him difficult to touch. Otherwise, Ning Hejing would have taken him down long ago!

He could no longer bear the sight of Li Yuanqin in front of him and said coldly, "So it’s you! Your father’s achievements were so grand!"

The words were laced with malice, immediately snapping the youth to alertness. His gaze lingered on his uncle’s face for a beat before Ning Hejing snarled, "Get out at once!!"

"Hey..." Chi Fubo had seen firsthand what Li Yuanqin was capable of. He hurriedly held Ning Hejing back and tugged at Li Yuanqin’s sleeve.

The young man slowly lowered his head and said softly, "My lord... Si Yuanli held the riverbank, forcing my father to stay there and defend it. He wagered his life just to protect the great river... But Si Yuanli and the Si Family elites clearly had Purple Mansion Realm talismans and methods, yet refused to use them! They watched my father die without lifting a hand."

His words startled everyone. Li Yuanqin’s narrow eyes brimmed with tears as he cried and said, "Si Yuanli now treats the rewards issued along the riverbank as property of the Si Family, and is using them to win over the esteemed families. He’s clearly planning something big... With Daoist Master Yuan Xiu absent, he’s acting entirely on his own... We cannot allow the families to blindly follow his reckless commands..."

"This..." Ning Hejing’s expression froze on his face. He quickly ran the situation through in his mind, thinking, That’s right... The Si Family may be strong, but Yuan Xiu hasn’t shown himself. Without him, they’re just another group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... If we can unite the noble clans, perhaps they’re not so frightening after all...

Li Yuanqin carries weight in name, and the words will only have effect if they come from his mouth. He holds high seniority within the Li Family; his voice could be used to rally their forces...

Though Ning Hejing’s personal strength wasn’t extraordinary, he had managed Yuanxing Peak for many years. His gaze was sharp and his mind calculating; he wasn’t a simple man. How could he not grasp this point?

Though he was deeply unwilling, he could only keep silent for now and listen. Chi Fubo’s eyes were practically glowing, and he nodded repeatedly. "My lords, as long as Daoist Master Yuan Xiu doesn’t take action himself, what can Si Yuanli really do? Will he truly lead the Si Family’s elites into an all-out war against us?

"He just wants more power. We already hold the upper seats. So what if his reputation is at its apex right now? Must every peak master obey Si Yuanli?"

Li Yuanqin nodded but did not say much more. At this moment, any word of persuasion would be ill-timed. No one present was a fool, they would all come to their own conclusions.

Sure enough, an elder of the second lineage, Chi Zhihu, slowly showed signs of being moved. His voice was quietly pensive, "The first lineage’s forces are nearly spent, but no one among us in the second lineage holds truly high authority. There's only Hejing, and all he has is Yuanxing Peak... In the end, we’re just humble Daoists..."

Li Yuanqin bowed respectfully and said in a soft voice, "My lords... the sect master has already issued a command. It rests in Lord Hejing’s hands."

Li Yuanqin’s smooth and unhurried words echoed through the empty great hall. He had voiced what several of them were secretly thinking. The Chi Family members all looked visibly pleased, except for Ning Hejing, whose expression turned dark.

He raised a hand to halt them and said coldly, "Li Yuanqin, I don’t trust you."

Those few words echoed through the great hall. He narrowed his eyes slightly and spoke in a low voice, "You play the role well, but all things are driven by profit. What do you gain from this, hmm? Hatred for Li Xuanfeng? What a joke!"

He stepped down from the upper seat, expression icy and his tone even colder. "The discord between the first and second branches has long existed, but surely you played your part for this generation’s split to be so severe. You Li Family people are vicious, ruthless, treacherous, and cunning."

The man’s eyes were razor-sharp, and even glinted with killing intent. He walked right up to his nephew. He spoke coldly through gritted teeth, "A person like you is hard to deal with. I’m stationed far from the sect, so naturally I haven’t caught any of your misdeeds.

"But Chi Fuju being repeatedly punished, even drawing the sect master’s displeasure, that was your doing, wasn’t it? You’ve been sowing discord all these years, haven’t you?"
