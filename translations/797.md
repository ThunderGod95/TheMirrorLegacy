# Chapter 797: Visitors from the Southern Sea

Li Zhouluo sat in the main hall. He had spent the morning dragging Li Zhoufang along to "bitterly plead" with Li Xuanxuan, putting on a masterful performance. Only now did he finally have time to manage the clan's affairs. He set his brush aside, deep in thought.

'Phoenix Tail Stone is exceptionally rare in the northern regions... The main deposits are all within the territory of the Azure Pond Sect... I need to write a letter and ask. Grandfather mentioned he has a disciple on duty in their market; he would be the best one to help.'

The Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails were a precious Purple Mansion Realm formation base. Even with Moongaze Lake's wealth, the clan's own vast mineral savings, and the materials added from the Profound Peak Gate, the remaining deficit was still around fifteen hundred spirit stones.

The Li clan’s spirit stone reserves were down to about six hundred. Yet, Li Zhouluo was not worried about the cost. The more pressing issue was that casting this item wasn't just about having enough spirit stones; it required procuring massive amounts of spiritual materials. This item was scarce, that one in short supply. Even if they had the spirit stones, they couldn't spend them.

'The price of spirit qi within the family is also being driven higher and higher... Several clan members have come to complain... Cultivators from humble backgrounds can no longer afford it, relying solely on the few portions the prefecture allocates to geniuses each year...'

This was an all-too-common problem. The cost of spirit qi suitable for Qi Refining throughout Jiangnan had been inflated to twenty or thirty spirit stones per portion precisely because it was so scarce. The Li clan's rise had granted Moongaze Lake a formidable, organized capability for gathering qi. However, the resulting flood of new cultivators mastering Embyronic Breathing had not alleviated the shortage of Lesser Clear Spirit Qi; it had perversely intensified the demand.

Even more interesting was the fact that without a corresponding cultivation art, this basic qi was useless in one’s hands. The Li clan's rise had brought an unexpected change: as the number of cultivators practicing the "River-Center Clear Qi" art increased, that very resource—unheard of and worthless on the market a century ago—gradually acquired value.

The Li clan, controlling the entirety of Moongaze Lake, could produce a significant amount of River-Center Clear Qi annually. Setting aside the obscene profits of sixty spirit stones per portion made by the Azure Pond Sect's Qi-Plucking Peak, the price of this local resource had climbed to over thirty spirit stones. Without this supply of River-Center Clear Qi, the number of non-clan Qi Refiners in the region would be cut in half.

'The northern shore also has snow mountains near the great river. In the future, we must station people on the river permanently. The River-Center Clear Qi there is even more abundant than at Moongaze Lake... It would be best if we could find a Mansion Water qi-gathering art suitable for lake cultivation.'

He was pondering this while drafting the letter when Dili Guang arrived with a report. Hearing that his two most capable subordinates, Ding Weizeng and Wang Quwan, were reporting, Li Zhouluo felt a jolt of surprise and immediately had them brought in.

"Greetings, Clan Head!"

Ding Weizeng bowed first and explained Wang Quwan's situation. Li Zhouluo listened with great curiosity. The token was passed only to Dili Guang , allowing the Eastern Yue man to inspect it carefully.

Li Zhouluo set his brush down, his expression doubtful.

"The Wanling Upper Sect is indeed a formidable lineage. As for some ‘earth palace’... I doubt it is a virtuous place. Immortals and Buddhists died all over Jiangbei, their conflict shaking heaven and earth; how could it not have been discovered then? If it were re-emerging, why now? Why didn't it appear back when blood qi was rampant, spiritual opportunity was boundless, and the eighteen Buddhist masters fell, dyeing the riverbanks pink? Why wait until today, when the spiritual opportunity has gradually calmed and settled?"

Li Zhouluo’s highborn status meant he understood nearly ninety percent of the truth behind the war between the north and south, and he knew the true principles by which ruins manifested. Suspicion bloomed instantly. He felt it improper to leave two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators bowing, so he rose from his seat, helped both men up, and said softly:

"Currently, the Daoist Master is away, and the elders are in seclusion. I fear this item brings trouble."

Wang Quwan was a clever man and understood the subtext. He replied, "Thank you, Clan Head, for the guidance. I acquired this token as spoils of war and am here to submit it to the clan. I ask only that the clan elders examine it before making a decision."

Li Zhouluo frowned and shook his head. With the clan’s own Purple Mansion Realm expert away, his standing policy was that less trouble was always better. He wouldn't be tempted even if the earth palace contained Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items. He replied:

"The item remains yours. Hold onto it for now and quietly observe the situation. I will report this to the clan elders, and when there is news, I will summon you."

Dili Guang had already handed the token back. Wang Quwan looked slightly stunned and opened his mouth to speak, but Ding Weizeng, quick-witted, accepted it on his behalf. Li Zhouluo turned the conversation:

"The Wang Clan in Jiangbei is suppressed by the major families and has struggled these past years. Wang He of the Capital immortals Dao is your Wang clan’s leader. Has he made any troublesome moves?"

Wang Quwan quickly bowed and replied, "Reporting to the Clan Head, Clan Uncle Wang He has repeatedly sent people over with condolences and has also sent many spiritual resources as aid. However, my younger brother refused them all. These matters have all been reported to the clan..."

Li Jianglong submitted reports monthly, so Li Zhouluo was naturally aware of this. But the matter was important, and he couldn't help but probe one more time. He shook his head.

"Although Wang He is far senior to you and his cultivation is higher, his innate talent is simply abysmal. He is a nobody in the Capital immortals Dao, entirely incomparable to you. Naturally, he will do everything he can to curry favor."

Wang Quwan bowed low. Seeing Ding Weizeng nod beside him, he said respectfully, "Reporting to the Clan Head, the loyalty of the Funan Wang Clan is beyond reproach!"

"I am aware! The Milin Palace has resumed operations. The Wang Clan may send two disciples to enter. Quwan, seeing your own bearing, I trust your disciples will not be lacking. They will certainly achieve great things."

Both men had duties to attend to and quickly took their leave. Li Zhouluo turned his thoughts back to the letter for Li Xizhi's people, deciding to include this matter as well. He was buried in work. As soon as the letter was sent, the situation he had set in motion earlier that morning had finished simmering. It was time to release Li Xixuan.

Li Zhoufang was already waiting outside the hall, the man visibly restraining his anxiety. Seeing Li Zhouluo, he hurried to follow. Li Zhouluo nodded gravely.

"Since the Old Master has agreed, let us go and invite the elder out."

"Thank you, Clan Head!"

Li Zhoufang nodded repeatedly. "Only the Clan Head, by stepping forward to plead this case... could have made the Old Master relent. No matter what,  Grand Uncle Xixuan is still Aunt Minggong’s father. How can we just lock him in the ancestral hall! If he cannot overcome this... and something dreadful happens, what will the family do in the future?"

Li Zhouluo and Li Zhoufang were both Qi Refining cultivators; they covered the short distance in moments. They unfastened the Dharma artifacts from their waists, handing them to a nearby Mount Qingdu cultivator. Removing their shoes, they entered the hall. There, they saw the pale, plump Li Xixuan dressed in a single layer robe, reading at a desk.

Seeing the two enter, Li Xixuan acknowledged the Clan Head, Li Zhouluo, with a slight nod before immediately sitting back down.

"Congratulations, Grand Uncle! The Clan Head pleaded bitterly with the Old Master and has finally secured your release..."

"Oh..."

Li Zhoufang, his face bright with joy, invited the old man to leave, but the elder merely seemed listless and utterly disinterested.

The drama staged by Li Xuanxuan and Li Zhouluo might have fooled ninety percent of the clan, but it could not deceive elders like Li Xixuan and Li Chengzhi. Li Xixuan immediately recognized the duet; his own biological grandson, Li Zhoufang, was the one truly left on the outside. He sat desolately by the desk.

With the old man refusing to cooperate, Li Zhoufang could only pace anxiously. As the eldest brother, caught between both parties, he was in an impossible position. Li Zhouluo smiled.

"Big Brother, please wait outside for a moment. I would like to chat with Grand Uncle alone."

Li Zhoufang immediately retreated. Li Xixuan leaned weakly against the desk. He watched as the young man personally poured him a cup of tea.

"Grand Uncle," Li Zhouluo said softly, "your courtyard holds nineteen children and nephews, and over a hundred grandchildren. The Yuanwan Branch possesses only this single manor in the prefecture. You are struggling under the burden of managing these hundred people. The Old Master... he sees this."

At this mention, Li Xixuan’s spirits suddenly revived. He shook his head heavily. "Do you, who sit in the high halls, truly understand this bitterness? These children of mine... they possess no spiritual apertures. The very moment the family divides, they become minor branches. One day they are descendants of immortals; the next, they are packing their bags to go perform hard labor by the shore. If I split the family just like that, will they not hate me? Will they not hate the clan?"

He sighed deeply. "This old man does not dare to divide them... Not dividing means over a hundred people remain squeezed into a single manor. Relatives, you see... they are useless when at the far ends of the earth, and merciless when pressed right before your eyes. Only when they are neither too far nor too close, a presence that almost isn't, are they comfortable. Right now, a friction starts in the east, an argument breaks out in the west... does this not wound our kinship? What can I do? This old body doesn't have many years left. The moment I die, they *will* split the family. The few main lineages will be comfortable, but those cast out will begin to hate. Is this not an omen of our decline?"

"Keeping them trapped in the courtyard now, letting them resent one another, is still better than dividing them later and having them unite in their resentment of the prefecture. This old man can understand you all, but you... you cannot understand this old man. Perhaps this truly is the difference between immortal and mortal..."

Li Zhouluo remained silent. He had heard whispers of Li Xixuan's situation. He poured the elder another cup of tea and said only this:

"The prefecture’s patronage quotas have been set. There are several positions. Mount Qingdu and the Jade Court will conduct the evaluations jointly. I will make the final ruling."

Li Xixuan’s eyes flew wide, staring round. His entire demeanor shifted in an instant. His back straightened, and he leaned forward urgently.

"The Clan Head means..."

Li Zhouluo spoke in a low voice, "The evaluation criteria are largely the same things Mount Qingdu monitors daily. This was not supposed to be announced for another month... The prefecture has many clan members who study diligently, work hard, and have received commendations from Qingdu. Grand Uncle should begin preparations early."

Li Xixuan was a shrewd old man. His expression became animated. He nodded repeatedly, "I understand... I understand... What are the ranks of these positions, and how many are there?"

Li Zhouluo merely smiled, shook his head, and rose to his feet. Li Xixuan shot up from his seat, his eyes suddenly turning red.

"Thank you, Clan Head... Thank you, Clan Head, for pleading with the Old Master... The Yuanwan Branch has many good children. They are counting on this... this is their salvation..."

Li Zhouluo didn't seem like someone who possessed such authority on his own. Li Xixuan knew that this "patronage" was ninety-nine percent the work of his own grandfather (Li Xizhi). But the final right to rule lay in Li Zhouluo’s hands. Li Xixuan seized the step down that had been offered. Hiking up his robes, he hurried out the door, only to see the utterly baffled face of Li Zhoufang.

"Clan Head!"

Seeing Li Zhouluo was already departing, Li Xixuan urgently grabbed Li Zhoufang. "Quickly, Eldest! Get me back to the prefecture!"

"Oh, oh, okay!"

Li Zhoufang, completely bewildered, pulled him along as they rushed toward the prefecture center. Li Xixuan slapped his own thigh and hissed:

"I need you to run another errand. Find those few bastards who are sneaking around idling in the prefecture and call every last one of them back..."

***

While the two hurried back to the prefecture, Li Zhouluo landed before his own hall. Dili Guang was pacing frantically, like an ant on a hot skillet. The moment he saw Li Zhouluo, he cried out:

"Aiyo... Clan Head! People from the Azure Pond Sect are here! They have been waiting in the side hall. You left so suddenly, I couldn't find you... I notified the Old Master, and he just arrived himself..."

Li Zhouluo quickly pushed the doors open. Sure enough, Li Xuanxuan was standing in the middle of the hall, looking anxious. Seeing Li Zhouluo, he said immediately, "Quickly, invite them in!"

Li Zhouluo straightened his robes just as two figures walked quickly up the outer steps. The one in the lead wore silvery-white attire, draped in a magnificent, embroidered red cloak. He had a round face and large eyes. The man following him was handsome and slender, with fair skin and a sword at his waist.

Beside them trailed a guard-like figure, dressed in black robes, tall and thin, with a sinister and vicious aura. It was the Hooked Serpent , Li Wushao. The demon snake, who had been stuck at the peak of the late Foundation Establishment Realm for a long time, bowed to both Li Xuanxuan and Li Zhouluo.

The red-robed youth in the lead bowed, his round face breaking into a handsome smile. "Quan Yuduan of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion greets the Clan Head!"

The youth behind him glanced around the hall’s decor with open curiosity before following suit with a bow. "Si Xunhui, of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, greets the Clan Head..."

"Please, please rise..."

These were Li Xizhi's own disciples. Li Zhouluo felt an instinctive warmth toward them. He hurried to help them up. "Esteemed cultivators, are you resting at our lake by coincidence, or are you here bearing instructions from my grandfather?"

The instant he said the word "grandfather," the way Quan Yuduan looked at him changed completely. He quickly took a step back and bowed respectfully.

"So it seems you are the Young Master! My Third Junior Brother and I rushed here from the Southern Sea, entirely unaware that the Young Master was managing the household..."

Quan Yuduan had assumed Li Wushao's bow had been for Li Xuanxuan; only now did he realize it was for this young man. He nodded, overjoyed. "The Young Master's cultivation speed is astonishing! Excellent, excellent... truly worthy of this bloodline..."

Beside him, Si Xunhui raised an eyebrow, his gaze filled with envy.

There were few family backgrounds in all of Jiangnan capable of making Si Xunhui envious. This was the first time Li Zhouluo had been addressed as "Young Master," and it felt awkward. He looked up. "My grandfather... how is he now?"

At the mere mention of Li Xizhi , Quan Yuduan’s face lit up, and he beamed.

"The lake must not have heard the news... My Master's reputation as the Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow now shakes the entire Southern Sea! From Lufang to Danrong Wuluo, everyone knows his name. Never mind those demonic cultivators... even the Clan Head of the Thunder Island's Miao Family came to spar and was no match for him! He was beaten until rosy light overflowed his body. If my Master had not intervened to dispel it... that old man would have perished on the spot!"

"Master now governs all nineteen islands of the Azure Pond Sect in the Southern Sea, and he has swept the entire sea region clean of demonic cultivators! The sacrificial resentment arts that the Lingu Family couldn't eradicate in three generations have now been almost completely severed at the root. The four directions are at peace, and the market's reputation and resources have multiplied several times over, filling all the deficits from the previous years..."

Li Xuanxuan threw his head back and laughed. Si Xunhui, also clearly moved, added softly:

"My own Daoist Master also met my Master. After they discussed Dharma arts, he called him a heaven-sent genius. He later told us juniors... that my Master’s attainment in the Heavenly Glow Dao already far surpasses the Lingu Xia of old, and has perhaps even eclipsed the very Daoist who first adapted the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique... He called him the undisputed foremost practitioner of heavenly glow arts in the last three hundred years!"

Li Zhouluo was filled with astonishment. Li Xuanxuan, stroking his beard, let out a long, deep sigh and couldn't help but ask, "Where were these words spoken? Has this news already spread throughout the Southern Sea?"

Si Xunhui quickly shook his head. "This was heard in a private conversation. I only repeated it to my Senior Brother. It has not spread... Master instructed me to remember this but not to publicize it... It is only because I am meeting the elders today that I could not help but share the joyous news."

"Good, good, good!" Li Xuanxuan's eyes grew moist. "Zhi'er is truly formidable... To have walked this far, all alone in the sect... his path was no easier than any of his brothers'... Good... This is truly wonderful..."
