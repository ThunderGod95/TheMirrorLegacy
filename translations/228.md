# Chapter 247: Cultivation Techniques

Upon hearing Li Tongya's words, Xiao Yongling's expression changed subtly. After a moment of hesitation, he whispered, "That's... Would this not be seen as disrespecting your clan? I fear it might not be appropriate!"

Li Tongya, fully understanding the implications of Xiao Yongling's words which were merely formalities. He cupped his fist and responded, "Our families have not yet made our matters public, and my breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm has not been announced. To sit so prominently would be to prematurely reveal our hand. Brother Yongling, do not worry! The friendship between our families transcends such formalities."

Xiao Yongling nodded, understanding the significance. He was concerned that placing Li Tongya at a lower seat might foster resentment between the two families. Thus, he had sought out Li Tongya early to specifically point out the spot reserved for the Li Family, awaiting the very reassurance Li Tongya had just provided.

He then said with a respectful gesture, "Brother Tongya is wise. I have already arranged another seat for you on the other side, and I have spaced out the seats for those from the Moongaze Lake families to keep them away from the lower ranks. With the clouds and mists enveloping us, no one will scan around with their spiritual senses so rudely... All should be well."

Xiao Yongling handled the matter cleanly, and Li Tongya nodded in gratitude, smiling warmly. He then proceeded to the lower seats, with Xiao Yongling personally escorting him before he returned to the high seats.

The area was still largely empty, and Xiao Jiuqing, following behind, praised, "Seeing Brother interact with Senior Tongya is like mountain echoes responding to each other, or moonlight reflecting on a clear stream—subtle but clear. It's truly amazing!"

Xiao Yongling chuckled and patted his shoulder, saying, "You have quite the way with words! If anyone could match your praise, I doubt they'd claim to be the best."

Xiao Jiuqing apologized profusely, though he had a smile on his face. Xiao Yongling laughed softly before becoming serious again, saying, "That's an exaggeration. Li Tongya and I both tend to overthink and speak circumspectly, which is why we can understand each other so well. Had it been Li Xuanfeng today, I would have had to explain everything to him the night before arranging the seats, instead of risking a conversation at the venue only today."

Xiao Jiuqing nodded quickly and then added, "I have learned much, brother. However, I heard that the Azure Pond Sect on the southern border has encountered demonic disturbances and is recruiting aid for Yi Mountain City... How true is this?"

Xiao Yongling shook his head and replied, "The Demon King of the southern border and the Azure Pond Sect are in cahoots; it's just a strategy by Chi Zhiyun. Fortunately, our family is not under Azure Pond's jurisdiction anymore, so we need not worry."

While the Xiao brothers were talking, Li Tongya had already found a seat and sat down. After a while, people began to trickle into their seats. A white-haired old man took the seat next to him and, after glancing around and noticing Li Tongya, his expression turned to one of surprise as he respectfully greeted him.

"Greetings, Senior..."

Li Tongya was surrounded by seats designated for those in the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm. As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator sitting alone among them, those nearby were cautious and avoided him, fearing he might be some reclusive or eccentric rogue cultivator. The man greeted him but then turned away to drink his wine quietly.

Li Tongya was pleased with this arrangement, looking up as the platform gradually filled with guests. He then heard a name being announced, "Yue Cultivating Sect, Daoist Master Shangyuan arrives—"

"The first to arrive from the three sects and seven gates is the Yue Cultivating Sect."

Whispers filled the air around him. Li Tongya looked up to see a figure in the high seat—a Daoist Master dressed in loose white garments with a green jade pendant hanging in front of his chest, his face indistinguishable. A sword dangled at his waist as he sat on the high seat, quietly wrapping his pale fingers around a jade cup, appearing unassuming at first glance.

"The esteemed elder has troubled himself to come from afar! I am deeply grateful that you have accepted my invitation and are here to grace my humble peak with your presence." Xiao Chuting's voice echoed from the peak, making Li Tongya fall solemn.

The Daoist Master set his jade cup down and nodded slightly in response, prompting Li Tongya to muse silently, Xiao Chuting is putting on such a humble front... This person must be a late-stage or even peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator! Although the Yue Cultivating Sect usually maintains a low profile, it is still one of the three major sects, with deep foundations.

At the lower seats, people were whispering among themselves. The Yue Cultivating Sect, despite being one of the three major sects, was the least conspicuous. Its gates were elusive and ethereal, and it uniquely allowed its vassal families considerable autonomy, maintaining a stance of detached observation. It was also the only sect among them that had a Purple Mansion Realm immortal clan under its governance.

Li Tongya was still listening to the scattered conversations around him when a burst of red light suddenly appeared at the high seats, signaling the arrival of yet another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

This new arrival, an elder with white hair and a youthful face, held a jade ruler and his white beard fluttered in the air. His presence was accompanied by another announcement.

"Profound Peak Gate, Daoist Master Changxi arrives..."

"Daoist Master Changxi greets the Senior!"

As soon as Daoist Master Changxi appeared, he hastily cupped his fist to the earlier guest. Daoist Master Shangyuan, dressed in white and wearing a green jade pendant in front of his chest, hummed in response. It was only then did Daoist Master Changxi dare to lift his head and turn around to offer his congratulations.

"Congratulations on your advancement to the Purple Mansion Realm, fellow Daoist!"

Li Tongya watched intently, feeling a sudden shock. He paid particular attention to the sword hanging at Daoist Master Shangyuan's waist, then quickly bowed his head, not daring to look further.

He thought to himself, This Daoist Master Shangyuan must be a sword immortal... Otherwise, the other Daoists Masters wouldn't be showing him such respect.

"Golden Tang Gate... Changxiao Gate..."

One by one, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators arrived and each cupped their fists to Daoist Master Shangyuan before taking their seats. Aside from Daoist Master Shangyuan of the Yue Cultivating Sect, the others brought along their Foundation Establishment Realm disciples.

Li Tongya carefully observed that, aside from the positions of the three sects and seven gates, there were a few other Purple Mansion Realm immortal clans present.

"Azure Pond Sect, Daoist Master Buzi arrives!"

With the arrival of the Azure Pond Sect's Daoist Master, the seats on the platform were all filled. Xiao Chuting, smiling broadly, exchanged a few pleasantries before celestial music began to play, creating a tranquil and peaceful ambiance.

Li Tongya looked up for a while, and among the people at the seats of the Purple Smoke Gate, he recognized a familiar face. That person was leisurely sipping his wine and savoring his meal with a pair of jade chopsticks, all while humming a tune.

"That guy... he's living the good life now!"

Li Tongya couldn't help but smile ruefully to himself, shaking his head as he watched the guy seated in front of the Daoist Master of Purple Smoke Gate below the platform, likely reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm by now.

He thought to himself, It really is not convenient right now, but I will see if I can find a moment to ask him. Lingyanzi once promised to send the Spirit Stones to my home, but there has been no word for years, and here he is... enjoying himself!

This individual was none other than Lingyanzi, a cultivator from the Purple Smoke Gate who had once fled to Mount Lijing. Li Tongya had agreed to help him eliminate two cultivators from Changxiao Gate in the past but ended up with two enchanted storage pouches he couldn't use. The guy had assured Li Tongya he would take them back and exchange them for spirit stones, promising to send the stones to him afterward.

Li Tongya had never expected him to deliver them personally, and indeed, after more than ten years, he had seen nothing of it. Now that he had seen him, he naturally planned to inquire on the matter.

"I suspect this old fellow might have welched on his debt, but I will ask. If it does not work out, I will consider it a loss!" he muttered to himself.

Xu Gongming rode his horse along the mountain path. It had just rained, so the ground was very muddy and his horse's hooves were splashing mud around. The dripping sound of water in the woods and the oddly pitched wind made him frown slightly.

Now at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, Xu Gongming could even outrun the horse beneath him. However, people are inherently lazy, and even immortals are no exception. He would rather stay indoors on a rainy day than come out and walk in the mud.

Xu Gongming, now in his thirties, had taken over family affairs after the death of Old Master Xu last year. The mountain had sent someone to offer condolences, as Old Master Xu was, after all, the son of Xu San, and there were still ties of affection with Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanfeng.

Xu Gongming had repeatedly thanked the messenger and sent him back. While grateful, he also felt a wave of melancholy, as this signified another step in the fading bond between the Xu Family and the main family. He had hastily arranged for the funeral and rushed to take up his post in the towns of Huaqian.

Upon arrival, he first visited the main family's local representative. Xu Gongming then hurried to a small courtyard in the town to meet with Tian Zhongqing, the representative of the Tian Family's interests in the towns of Huaqian.

Dismounting from his horse, a servant promptly came forward to take the reins. Xu Gongming knocked gently on the door and told the approaching servant, "Please inform your master that his old friend, Xu Gongming, has come to visit."

The Xu and Tian families were both venerable families of Lijing Town, living close to each other, with Xu Gongming and Tian Zhongqing having played together as children. Although they had been apart for many years and barely recognized each other at first, they had seen each other a few years ago and had worked together since, establishing a good relationship.

The door creaked open, and a handsome young man with a sword strapped to his waist stepped forward. "It has been months since we last saw each other, Gongming!" he exclaimed gleefully.

Xu Gongming laughed heartily and entered the courtyard politely. Tian Zhongqing then closed the gate and had a servant bring tea as they exchanged pleasantries. Xu Gongming, seizing the moment, congratulated him, "Congratulations, Brother Zhongqing! It seems the second Qi Cultivator outside the main family is likely to be from your family!"

Tian Zhongqing laughed heartily as he heard this. A peak Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator from the Tian Family had recently ascended Mount Lijing to receive a medicinal pill from the main family before going into seclusion on Mount Huaqian.

Aware that Xu Gongming was congratulating him on this, he replied, "This is all thanks to the main family's generosity, and we are immensely grateful... Any congratulations should really go to the main family!"

Then, with a serious tone, he continued, "My clan uncle is already over fifty, and he was identified from older peasants for his excellent root bones. It is a pity he started his cultivation too late, missing the best opportunity... Now, he can only strive for the Qi Cultivation Realm. If he succeeds, then that's wonderful; if not, he can only end up as an unrefined Qi Cultivator."

Xu Gongming nodded slightly. After Li Qiuyang's breakthrough had failed, the Li Family recently announced new rules that made the public aware of the difference between pure qi and unrefined qi cultivation. He first congratulated Tian Zhongqing a few more times and offered a few auspicious words.

Tian Zhongqing responded to each one politely before asking in a low voice, "Brother Gongming, has your family instructed you on this visit?"

Xu Gongming shook his head and replied quietly, "How could there be any instructions? I am merely appointed to Huaqian towns. After all, there are now more cultivators in Lijing Town, and the spiritual qi is not as abundant as before... Cultivation has become less favorable. Those old guys who have no hope for the Qi Cultivation Realm and just idle around do not care, but I cannot afford to waste my time there."

Xu Gongming took his tea and sipped it before continuing, "A few months ago, my father passed away. He still had ties with the mountain, so when people came down to mourn, I mentioned my situation and seized the opportunity to get out of there."

"I see," Tian Zhongqing nodded, his eyebrows lifting as he cupped his fist and added, "Please accept my condolences, brother."

"It's all right." Xu Gongming waved his hand, his face clouding over with a hint of bitterness as he replied, "The legacy of my ancestors has been exhausted. I am now the only cultivator in the Xu Family. If I fail to achieve the Qi Cultivation Realm, I fear our family will decline to the level of ordinary peasants..."

Tian Zhongqing paused slightly, taken aback. His own family, under the governance of the Li Family, was at the height of its power and had never faced such worries. He sighed in sympathy and responded, "Brother Gongming, your talents are exceptional! Qi Cultivation Realm should surely be within your reach."

Mentioning his talent only added to the irony for Xu Gongming. He laughed bitterly and said in a low voice, "Brother Zhongqing, you may have become slightly out of touch after staying in Huaqian for such a long time. If you knew about the situation in the main family, you would not perceive me as an exceptional talent!"

"What do you mean by that?" Tian Zhongqing asked as he was momentarily stunned, compelled to ask further.

Xu Gongming raised an eyebrow before setting down his cup. With a wry smile, he teased, "Why not try guessing what cultivation realm those two from the main family have reached now?"

"Those two?" Tian Zhongqing repeated as he pondered briefly, realizing Xu Gongming was referring to Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong. He smiled and guessed, "I am not sure about the other, but having seen Master Yuanjiao's pace, could it be the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm..?"

"The fourth stage?" Xu Gongming let out a cold laugh and replied, "They have both condensed the Jade Capital Chakra, achieving the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm!"

"What?!" Tian Zhongqing exclaimed, suddenly tasting a bitterness in his mouth. He knew that among the Tian Family, he was considered the most talented, yet he was only at the fourth stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm. Meanwhile, Li Qinghong and Li Yuanjiao, only seventeen or eighteen years old, had already reached the fifth stage. He exclaimed in resignation, "I have truly wasted more than a decade!"

Xu Gongming sighed too, and both fell silent, leaving only the sounds of the autumn wind and raindrops in the courtyard. Xu Gongming took two large sips of tea before saying, "Is the bloodline of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator really that noble? To have three generations all achieving the Qi Cultivation Realm... it is truly enviable."

"Qi Cultivation Realm?"

At this, Tian Zhongqing let out a cold laugh, interrupting him and saying quietly, "Our ancestor has not emerged from seclusion for many years... Who knows, he may have already combined all six chakras and broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, reforming our family into a clan!"

Xu Gongming was startled and calmed down to think carefully, realizing that this indeed could be possible, but he was not fully convinced. He simply responded, "It has only been three or four years... Foundation Establishment Realm is a life-and-death trial. Our ancestor is most likely still in seclusion for a breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm, currently at a critical juncture. Whether he succeeds or not is still unknown."

As the topic met such an abrupt turn, both men simultaneously fell silent, using the excuse to drink tea in an effort to mask their discomfort and fear.

After more than a dozen breaths, Tian Zhongqing managed to compose himself and expressed his doubts, "Their speed of cultivation is truly astonishing... The Yu and Fei families are also Foundation Establishment Realm families, but I have heard that from the Yu Family, only the prodigy Yu Muxian stands out. Excluding the disciples from the immortal sect, both Yu Mujian and Yu Mugao were approaching thirty when they entered the Qi Cultivation Realm..."

The Tian Family had produced three generations of individuals with spiritual orifices, and they collected extensive information from both the mountains and below.

Tian Zhongqing's remarks indeed broadened Xu Gongming's horizons. He nodded repeatedly and replied, "Starting cultivation at seven years old, and by seventeen, it has only been ten years of cultivation. To condense a chakra every two years...". His voice trailed off.

The two exchanged glances, and Tian Zhongqing spoke in a low voice, "I have also been to Mount Lijing, and its spirit veins are not even as good as those of Mount Huaqian. The gap between stages of the Embryonic Breathing Realm should not be so large!"

Tian Zhongqing paused, then stretched out his left hand, his eyes growing brighter as he pressed down one finger at a time, speaking gravely.

"Talent... Medicinal pills... Spiritual qi..."

Both were momentarily stunned. Xu Gongming opened his mouth, then lowered his head. Meanwhile, Tian Zhongqing also slowly began to realize something.

In unison, they exclaimed, "Cultivation techniques!"
