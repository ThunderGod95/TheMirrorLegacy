# Chapter 823: Searching

"Daoist Jinzhu..." The cultivator paused, speaking with some doubt, "Fellow Daoist, the Daoist has already gone to Splitreed Island, and there's no way to verify your identity at this time. What a pity."

His tone wavered slightly, but fearing they had chosen this time precisely because Cheng Jinzhu wasn’t present, he finally said in a firm voice, "Do the three of you have any other proof? I’m afraid I can’t just let you through based on your words alone."

Li Xizhi immediately felt awkward. The sword gate most likely wouldn't give face to the Azure Pond Sect. If he took out the Azure Pond Sect jade token now, it would not only be ineffective, but the contradiction in actions would also arouse suspicion.

He gripped his sword, just about to speak, when Li Qinghong behind him stepped forward. A streak of bright lightning appeared in her hand, purple and shimmering like a swimming fish.

She spoke gracefully, "I am Li Qinghong of Moongaze Lake. I cultivate the ancient art of the Thunder Dao, might this serve as proof..."

The cultivator carefully examined the lightning in her hand and considered the details. At last, he relented and said after a moment’s thought, "Since you're from the Li Family, it's only right that our sword gate offers some assistance. I see all of you are injured; several elders from our sect are heading to Wu State’s Great Western Plains. Why not travel with them and disembark at Moongaze Lake along the way?"

The Sword Gate truly acts with integrity... thought Li Xizhi.

How could Li Xizhi not understand the arrangement? Since they didn’t look like villains and their identity was still unverified, the sword gate was choosing to escort them all the way to the Li Family. If they were devil cultivators in disguise, it would all be exposed the moment they met the real family.

It was a sound plan, but quite troublesome for the sword gate. Li Xizhi thought to himself that if it were him guarding the ferry crossing, he would’ve just turned them away. He wouldn’t have gone to such lengths.

Li Quantao nodded, having a good impression of the sword gate. He used a secret technique to transmit his voice and advised, Brother Zhi, the sword gate has been an upright gate for many years. They won’t harm us...

"Then we’ll trouble your sect."

Li Xizhi gave a nod in response. The cultivator’s expression softened like spring thawing ice, and he said gently, "Then follow me quickly. If we miss the scheduled time, that’ll be a real problem."

The group followed him across the ferry crossing. The refined architecture of Wanyu Sword Gate had a distinctive sharpness, embodying the style of sword cultivators. The pavilions were connected by walkways, with eaves curving sharply upward, creating a striking scene.

A large sword ship of the sect was anchored at the ferry dock. A sword cultivator, dressed in a simple black robe, stood in front of it with a bright white longsword strapped to his back. He had narrow eyes and long brows, and was gazing westward.

"Martial Uncle!" The cultivator leading the group called out and quietly explained the situation.

The elegant sword cultivator turned his head in surprise and asked, "The Li Family of Qingdu?"

He smiled faintly, the white sword on his back humming softly as he asked, "I am Cheng Gao. It’s been many years, I wonder how Brother Yuanjiao is doing? He once said he’d visit if given the chance, but I’ve never heard from him."

Li Xizhi was startled to hear this and could only reply, "My father perished in Mirage Mirror Heaven... It’s been eighteen years now."

Cheng Gao paused briefly, then asked again, "Who killed him?"

"Tang Shedu..." muttered Li Xizhi.

Cheng Gao crossed his arms, observing Li Xizhi for a breath before speaking, "You’re his son? Then there’s no need to wait in the clouds, come aboard."

He waved for the sword gate disciple to step back, led the group into the sword ship, and sat down by the table. Someone came forward to serve tea, and Cheng Gao spoke quietly, "I had been cultivating my sword essence in the Eastern Sea for twenty years... I didn’t expect so many things to happen during that time. It’s truly a shame..."

Li Xizhi wasn’t sure how close Li Yuanjiao had been with this man, so he refrained from speaking. Then he saw Cheng Gao exhale and say softly, "Now that Tang Shedu has been slain by Senior Xuanfeng’s arrow, I suppose that karma has been resolved!"

Upon hearing this, Li Xizhi felt as if a great burden had lifted from his heart and finally relaxed. Cheng Gao then asked, "Are all of you from the Li Family?"

"I am Li Qinghong, younger sister of Li Yuanjiao..." Li Qinghong replied gently.

Cheng Gao nodded in a friendly manner, while Li Quantao, a bit embarrassed, said softly, "Li Quantao, from Fuchen Peak of the Azure Pond Sect."

Cheng Gao had been pouring tea into a cup, but upon hearing this, he slowly raised his head, set the teapot down, and raised an eyebrow slightly.

He asked, "Who is Li Encheng to you?"

"He is my father..." Li Quantao's voice trembled slightly as he spoke.

Cheng Gao nodded and said kindly, "Then we’re all on the same side, no need to be so formal."

Li Quantao straightened his back a little, his complexion visibly brightening. Cheng Gao glanced at him once again and said gently, "Daoist Master Guanxue was once on good terms with our sword gate and often lent us support. Though your family joined the Azure Pond Sect, the friendship remains. There’s no need to stand on ceremony, Quantao."

The others might not have understood earlier, but after Yu Yuwei’s earlier hints, they quickly caught on, The Daoist Master from Hongxue Gate!

Li Quantao froze, gripping his cup tightly. Cheng Gao said gently, "There’s no need to react like that... No matter who it was, even the Sword Immortal Donghua wasn’t perfect. Not everyone who besieged him back then was evil. Some entanglements aren’t about right or wrong, but simply fate’s mischief."

His words were like a sudden awakening, causing Li Quantao’s eyes to redden slightly as the pent-up frustration in his heart dissipated. He slowly took a sip of tea and asked, "Senior, may I ask... what exactly happened to our family’s Daoist Master?"

Cheng Gao nodded gently and rested one hand on the table as he began to explain, "Back then, the Changzhen Wondrous Arts were released when Donghua fell. All the things that had only existed in the great void with mana came tumbling down, glittering like a sky full of jewels.

"A great battle erupted over the lake, descending into chaos. Daoist Master Guanxue seized the immortal sword and secretly clutched it to his chest. He didn’t dare return to his sect, nor did he dare to flee into the great void. He simply fled westward, toward Wu State."

Cheng Gao’s expression turned wistful as he spoke softly, "It’s said that the sword was called Xueli. It was a true immortal sword.

"When he reached Sun Seeking Pond in Wu State, Daoist Master Guanxue’s injuries flared up, forcing him to stop and look for a place to enter seclusion. But that immortal sword suddenly leapt from his arms, circled once around his neck, and severed his head.

"Caught off guard, Daoist Master Guanxue was wrapped in sword qi and dared not move a muscle. He stood alone above the pond, and soon perished. The immortal sword then escaped into the great void, never to be seen again."

Since it was described as an immortal sword, Li Quantao did not question why a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would die from decapitation, and instead said, "Thank you for informing me, Senior."

Cheng Gao simply nodded and replied, "I'm heading to Ganzi Prefecture in the Great Western Plains to meet someone, so I can’t talk further now. But when you have time, do come visit me at the sword gate."

Li Quantao nodded of course. After a few sips of tea, the sword cultivator pointed beneath them and said softly, "We’ve arrived at Moongaze Lake."

A cultivator from the Li Family had already come aboard to check, and was overjoyed to see the group.

Cheng Gao nodded at the sight and quietly escorted the three out, saying, "I’ll be cultivating in Ganzi Prefecture of the Great Western Plains for the next few years. If any of you come west, feel free to visit."

He piloted the sword ship back into the sky, returned to his seat, refilled his tea, and fell into silent contemplation.

What a coincidence... Li Quantao is actually traveling with the Li Family of Qingdu... The sword cultivator took a sip of tea, deep in thought, It makes sense... The Li of Qingdu are Wei’s Li, and so are the Li from Hongxue. Helping each other is only natural.

Chengshui Tomb.

Demonic clouds rolled across the sky and muffled thunder rumbled as darkness enveloped the land. Only scattered glimmers of light shimmered in the air.

Rain pattered endlessly as Li Xuanfeng rode the wind and halted above the black waters. Demonic mists churned on the surface. The strange signs of Murong En’s death had already faded, but the black smoke was growing thicker, forming a sky-darkening shroud.

This was the outer edge of Chengshui Tomb, where things looked noticeably calmer, but the water had still turned gray. Li Xuanfeng gazed into the distance, while a plain-looking middle-aged man with two gourds tied to his waist stood next to him, his vine armor glowing faintly with dharma light.

This man was none other than Lingu Rao, also known as Raozi Scorpion, a veteran cultivator from the Azure Pond Sect who had long guarded the Southern Sea. His voice was hoarse and heavy as he said, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng, are you still able to proceed?"

Lingu Rao had actually become renowned even earlier and by seniority was more suited to the same generation as Li Tongya. But he had spent most of his life secluded in the Southern Sea and rarely socialized with people. In these borderlands, such distinctions didn’t matter much, so they simply addressed one another as fellow Daoists.

Lingu Rao didn’t know what medicine Yuan Xiu had given Li Xuanfeng, but since only three months had passed, he feared Li Xuanfeng might still be injured.

Thus he asked out of concern, and Li Xuanfeng nodded and replied, "Rest assured, fellow Daoist."

Li Xuanfeng had witnessed the various Daoist Masters slay Murong En three months ago. Relics had rained down from the great void amid torrential rain and lightning, but he hadn’t had the chance to linger as Yuan Xiu quickly took him back to Mount Bianyan.

Yuan Xiu’s stern face hadn’t changed as he took out a strange wooden bottle from his robe and instructed, "Your injuries this time aren’t serious, but both your divine spirit and body were still wounded by Maha’s techniques. This bottle holds a drop of Golden Drip Sacred Dew. Take it. You’ll recover fully within three months, and I’ll have more tasks for you afterward."

Naturally, Li Xuanfeng had accepted the medicine and consumed it in his cave dwelling. As expected of a Purple Mansion Realm item, his injuries had been completely healed in three months. But when he inquired further, the losses proved to be heavy.

"Zhuang Cheng from Golden Feather Sect was severely injured, and Lin Shouye lost a portion of his lifespan. Lingu Lanying’s Hooked Serpent died, and she herself is missing, there’s no news of the others either..."

Not only had forces from all sides suffered casualties, but the Azure Pond Sect's defensive line had also contracted significantly. It had originally been centered around Mount Bianyan, with Mount Yan Pass on one side and Baixiang Valley and Lake Xian on the other. They had once occupied the majority of Xu State.

Now, both fronts had suffered heavy losses. The eastern Baiguang Valley had fared slightly better as they retreated to the edge of Mount Yu, while the western Mount Yan Pass had fallen all the way back to the riverbanks. They only held Mount Bianyan in the central region of Xu State. The few defensive lines that remained barely covered a quarter of Xu State.

Worse still, a new force had joined in from the north, the Gao Family of Jingbo. This undoubtedly added more pressure to the Purple Mansion Realm forces in the great void. Fortunately, the Gao Family faced the Golden Feather Sect, meaning the Azure Pond Sect wouldn't have to face this demonic force directly.

Li Xuanfeng’s mission to scout Chengshui Tomb was partly due to sect orders, but also a personal search for signs of his kin. If his guess was right, Lingu Rao likely had similar intentions.

The two drifted through the demonic mists for some time. A few Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators flying over the tainted land below naturally couldn’t detect them. After circling the outskirts twice, Lingu Rao quietly used mana to transmit a message into Li Xuanfeng’s ear, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng, I have a question I’ve been meaning to ask... though I don’t know if I should."

Li Xuanfeng cast him a light glance while his spiritual sense continued scanning the ground below. He replied via mana transmission, "Speak freely, fellow Daoist."

Lingu Rao’s voice was slightly hoarse as he said quietly, "I heard you recently received a reward, a rare pill called the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill. I wonder, what are its properties?"

Li Xuanfeng had expected this question, but it wasn’t something he could answer, so he apologized, saying, "This pill was given to me by a Daoist Master. I’m afraid I cannot speak of it casually without his permission."

Though Lingu Rao’s eyes were narrow, they carried a calm and calculating glint. He looked deeply at Li Xuanfeng and said quietly, "The High Sect intends to send me to reclaim Baixiang Valley and Lake Xian in an attempt to prevent the northern devil cultivators from linking up with those in Jiangnan and the Eastern Sea... If they join forces and strengthen each other, they may launch a combined assault..."

Li Xuanfeng responded calmly, "You are powerful, fellow Daoist, and will surely not fail expectations... Sadly, I am lacking in strength. I was injured during the assault on Chengshui Tomb, and the sect has ordered me to rest. I won’t be able to accompany you."

Lingu Rao’s attention remained fixed on him, as if Li Xuanfeng’s words had confirmed certain suspicions. He looked away and replied, "You’re being modest, Xuanfeng. You’re no longer just an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, you're far beyond what I could compare to.”

"Once the sect's rewards are distributed, you too will advance greatly in strength." Li Xuanfeng responded with a polite remark, and Lingu Rao let out a long, quiet breath.

The doubts that had troubled him for some time were finally confirmed. Keeping his expression unchanged, he continued speaking through mana transmission, "Thank you, fellow Daoist."

Li Xuanfeng had already deduced much and only awaited confirmation. The reward that Lingu Rao would receive next could very well verify his suspicions.

He replied politely, "When that time comes, fellow Daoist, I hope we can spar more often."

"Of course."

The two flew for a while, conversing via mana transmission. Soon, the rolling demonic clouds began to recede, and the black waters ahead gradually turned blue. Even the demonic energy in the air was thinning.

Lingu Rao pulled out a thin piece of gauze and gently tossed it into the air. It instantly shrouded the two of them, concealing them in a veil of light so thoroughly that even an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator wouldn’t be able to detect them.

They followed the blue water for some distance before sensing the presence of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and even the familiar aura of a southern Dao lineage belonging to the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Dao lineages.

A sizable number of devil cultivators in the North also practiced methods of the Purple Mansion Dao and Golden Core Dao. However, their methods were often more extreme, frequently relying on blood essence for faster, more convenient cultivation.

To northern cultivators, the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Daos was often seen as merely a branch of devil cultivation itself and was frequently referred to as the Purple-Gold Devil Dao. Meanwhile, what was called the Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace devil Dao in Jiangnan was known in the North as the Heavenborn Devil Dao. In the end, it all came down to differing perspectives.

Thus, whenever southern and northern cultivators clashed, it was common for each side to call the other devil scum. Unless one practiced the ancient Immortal Dao of Qi Ingestion and internal cultivation, almost everyone would be labeled a devil by someone, no matter where they went.
