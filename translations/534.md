# Chapter 813: Xi Chang

Chimen Difu only had time to spit out a black seal from his chest, but before the billowing black smoke could even unfurl, lightning and fire came crashing down in red and white flashes.

Boom!

Chimen Difu let out a muffled groan and spat two mouthfuls of black blood. He immediately formed a seal, summoning three black skulls. A mere thought shattered the jade pendant at his waist to summon reinforcements.

Even with only half a brain, Chimen Difu knew that using the pendant so hastily meant no one was likely to come. At best, they’d just gather at the entrance to watch the show.

Still... better something than nothing...

Chimen Difu forcefully suppressed his internal injuries and used mana to defend. Suddenly, a flash of rainbow light struck like a venomous snake, coiling twice around his black seal. The dharma artifact felt both heavy and light, as if an enormous hand were yanking it down.

Chimen Difu was an old devil who had refined this seal in his belly for many years. Had he not, the earlier blast of flame and lightning, followed by Heavenly Glow's tug, would have sent it crashing to the ground. Thus, it still hovered mid-air, but it clearly no longer obeyed him properly.

Shhh...

White rain rose from the ground and swept forward with the raging wind. The demon smoke that was forming around him to conceal his form and defend against spells hadn’t even taken shape before it was completely blown away, leaving only a mist of white rain around him.

Danger... With all four attackers striking together, only one thought remained in Chimen Difu’s mind, I can’t delay any longer!

Though he was bitterly frustrated, he immediately realized the four before him were all formidable. The thunder cultivator, in particular, was overwhelmingly powerful and directly countered devil cultivators. If he didn’t act now, he wouldn’t even be able to escape later.

The old devil was exceedingly decisive. He clapped his hands together, and the black shadow in the air flared brightly. His body turned into demonic light in the blink of an eye, and the black seal exploded with a bang before the four’s eyes.

Boom...

A surge of deep black magic light burst forth. Li Qinghong immediately raised her spear in defense, then, without the slightest hesitation, parted her red lips and spat out a white light.

The white light pulsed like a breath, then rapidly expanded. It was none other than the Profound Thunder condensed from Li Qinghong’s thunderpool via the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique.

This old devil truly is ruthless. He discarded a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact just like that, and who knows how many years’ worth of magic energy it contained... all shattered to buy time.

Now in the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Qinghong had three Profound Thunders in her thunderpool. She had already used one during the devil cultivator battle to cover the group's retreat.

Chimen Difu was by no means weak. But ambushed by four cultivators and forced into retreat, the demonic light he unleashed by sacrificing his artifact was indeed formidable.

But it can’t be saved now...

Li Qinghong knew the two behind her were not in great shape. If they had to fend off the attack alone, they’d almost certainly be injured. Since thunder was the bane of devil cultivators, she couldn’t afford to hold back. She unleashed the Profound Thunder just in time to shield the group from the incoming demonic light.

Boom!

The purple-white lightning dropped around them like a waterfall as it collided with the surging black magic light. The impact nearly shattered the entire cave dwelling, and the thunderous noise could no longer be concealed, spreading outward along the flow of water.

Boom!

A second crash echoed. Li Qinghong took a half-step back, but the magic light aimed at the others behind her had already been weakened by eighty percent. As Li Xizhi helped block the remainder, he activated his perception technique and caught sight of a streak of dark-golden light burrowing into the ground.

“What a sophisticated escape spell...” As the demonic light finally faded, Li Quantao’s Water Wall Pearl glowed faintly, sweeping away the thick miasma within the cave.

Yu Yuwei said hoarsely, “Black Radiance Origin-Life Divine Escape... that’s a technique from the Golden Feather Sect... Chimen Difu is definitely hiding something!”

Yu Yuwei had been shielded by the others and thus had energy to spare for observation. He, too, had noticed the streak of black-golden escape light.

The elder, well-versed in heritage and technique, recognized it immediately. Though Li Qinghong and the others were suspicious, they had never planned to pursue him anyway and simply let him escape.

“We shouldn’t linger. Let’s go quickly.”

Li Qinghong swept her sleeve to collect the shattered fragments of the black seal still floating in the air. Then, riding thunder, she soared over the battlefield littered with corpses of slain devil cultivators and led the others into the water vein.

The water vein was now saturated with dark radiance. The deaths of several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had greatly altered the area. It had widened several fold from Li Qinghong’s first visit. The black spiritual waters surged, occasionally revealing glowing spirit items.

Once Li Quantao entered the water, his speed noticeably increased. The wide water vein gave him room to maneuver, and activating the Water Wall Pearl raised their speed by another fifty percent. The four shot through the waterway like arrows.

The water vein was deathly silent. The young man felt the atmosphere too oppressive to bear and said, “So many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators died in this battle, not to mention countless Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators and those in Embryonic Breathing Realm... Surely this will nurture fertile ground once they are buried in the earth and fallen into the veins of the land and water.

“Jiangbei has grown increasingly barren over the past five hundred years. This nourishment could likely support several times more cultivators... and all the storage pouches, dharma artifacts, and spirit items buried in the soil could sustain generations of rogue cultivators.”

Yu Yuwei nodded in agreement as he replied, “As long as the Purple Mansion Realm doesn’t appear in the world to engage in combat, then yes—the more death, the more spiritual energy will be left behind, and the greater chance of nurturing geniuses. I won’t live to see it, but you all might. A hundred years from now, Jiangbei will be full of famous cultivators.”

Spiritual energy surged darkly through the water vein, but its bone-piercing cold was blocked by their mana shields. The silence was deafening.

Yu Yuwei glanced at Li Qinghong and said, “It’s a pity that Daoist Master Donghua once had a miraculous technique for moving through the great void. Once he entered it, no amount of Golden Core Realm cultivators could touch him. That’s why they sealed off the great void and killed him in the physical world. The Purple Mansion Realm intervened to sever the spirit vein—otherwise, Moongaze Lake would be one of the finest treasure lands today.”

He chuckled twice and said, “Come to think of it, Donghua destroyed three sects in that war. One of them was Hongxue Gate, and its young master was Li Ti... If not for that massacre, you, Li Quantao, would now be a core descendant of an immortal sect!”

“What?!”

At those words, not only did Li Xizhi and Li Qinghong look over in astonishment, even Li Quantao was stunned. He stared blankly for a moment and opened his mouth to argue, but suddenly recalled many past events and his father’s behavior. Realization struck him silent.

The Li Ti Yu Yuwei spoke of was Li Encheng’s father, Li Quantao’s own grandfather. A chill slowly spread across Li Quantao’s chest as he began to understand the immense leniency Chi Wei and the Azure Pond Sect had shown his father in certain matters...

“So that’s how it is...”

The young man was naturally bold and chivalrous. He was always drawn to heroic figures. How could he not admire a sword immortal like Daoist Master Donghua and Li Jiangqun, who stood against ten? Li Quantao clearly held great affection for Donghua and felt a deep sense of injustice over his betrayal despite such loyalty.

Now it felt as if he’d been struck by lightning. When he learned that his own ancestor had been the one to ambush the sword immortal, stole his sword, and died on the run, Li Quantao pressed his lips together. He could not bring himself to utter a word.

He simply flew forward in silence, but while the speaker had said it offhandedly, the listener, Li Xizhi, took it to heart and thought to himself, There’s such a deep connection? Hongxue Gate was founded by the Wei’s Li lineage... Yu Yuwei knows so much about it. Does the Yu Family have some hidden ties? And the way this old man keeps provoking Quantao, it might not be so simple...

He scrutinized Yu Yuwei’s expression. Indeed, it was complicated. The old man finally broke the silence, “Quantao, Li Encheng doesn’t like me. He’s probably told you already. Back then, during our internal strife, the Coiling Qi Jade True Technique really was sent by me... so yes, it was a family power struggle, and I was the one who delivered the poison.

“But think about it... who decides whether the Yu Family engages in infighting? Every Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in the family knew that technique was flawed. They just picked me because I was the youngest and lowest in seniority. They dumped the dirty work on me.”

He spoke with heartfelt sincerity, “Quantao, if you can’t see through things, sooner or later you’ll be forced to suffer. Your father didn’t have time to guide you much before he died. Set aside the pride, observe more, and think more...”

When his words reached this point, the tone became more telling. Li Quantao’s expression turned complicated, and though he wanted to respond, he hesitated. The waters ahead gradually brightened, shifting from pitch-black to turquoise blue.

“The Eastern Sea...”

As Li Qinghong neared the Eastern Sea, her internal mana surged more wildly. It was clearly affected by the spiritual aura of Falling Water Rising Storm.

Li Quantao looked slightly uncomfortable; it was evidently his first time near the Eastern Sea. Yu Yuwei softly explained, “Jiangnan is an Upper Evil Spirit Storage. You’re used to that, this kind of energy will feel unfamiliar and uncomfortable at first.”

The group followed the water vein forward, which widened rapidly. At this moment, multicolored light flickered in Li Xizhi’s eyes as he grew more vigilant, peering intently into the depths.

The Eastern Sea is in utter chaos now. Though it is not war torn like Xu State with its civil war, it’s far from peaceful. We must stay cautious.

“Something’s wrong...” Although his perception technique was strong, Li Qinghong, augmented by Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow, was even more attuned to demonic energy. Her almond-shaped eyes narrowed, and she raised her spear and spoke coldly, “Fellow cultivator, why not show yourself?”

Sure enough, as soon as she spoke, the sea before them churned violently. Several figures dressed in wildly different garb appeared. Some wore the outfits of outer-sea cultivators, while others were dressed in black smoke-wreathed demonic robes. There was even one in the feathered robe of a Daoist.

Their cultivation levels varied, but seven had appeared in total, and two were late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm.

The leader wore a neat, white, ancient-style feathered robe. His aura was refined, with handsome brows and bright eyes. He smiled faintly and said, “Fellow cultivators... what a fine catch today!”

The sharp-eyed Yu Yuwei only needed a quick glance to identify their attire. He quickly sent a mana voice transmission, Mostly Eastern Sea and northern devil cultivators. The man in front is likely from the Eastern Sea. His turned-back sleeves show a faint pine-needle pattern—he probably claims descent from the Green Pine Dao lineage, likely the Chunyi Dao Gate.

Someone from Chunyi Dao... Li Xizhi remained silent for a breath. It was his first time encountering cultivators from an Eastern Sea sect, and he didn’t dare call the man’s bluff.

He merely said in a low voice, “Fellow cultivators... we are merely passing through. There’s no reason for conflict without cause...”

The young man at the front let out a laugh and waved his snowy white sleeves, speaking bluntly, “Don’t bother hiding it! This water vein runs straight from Chengshui Tomb; its branches lie beneath it! You’re clearly remnants of the Purple-Gold Devil Dao fleeing the collapse. We’ve been watching for a while now, and you’re the third group to come through.”

The four heard this and realized the matter couldn’t end peacefully. Li Qinghong drew her spear, purple lightning gathering and erupting in a flash as she swept it at the young man before her, coldly declaring, “Go!”

Boom!

The young man glanced at her in surprise, white light rising in his palm. He pushed his palm forward and a stream of luminous moonlight burst forth, forming a radiant arc that blocked the thunder.

He was much more polite as he said gently, “I am Xi Chang, a rogue cultivator from the Eastern Sea. Since the fairy cultivates profound thunder, you must not be a devil cultivator. Why associate with these devilish types?”

When he saw that Li Qinghong’s thunder was bright and pure, Xi Chang judged that she couldn’t be from the Miao lineage, and thus not one of the Southern Sea devil cultivators. She must be an upright inland cultivator, so he held back slightly.

Though Xi Chang had held back on purpose, Li Qinghong assumed it was a life-and-death duel and didn’t hold anything back. Her purple lightning pierced forward, scattering the light in his hand and numbing his arm.

He couldn’t help but cry out, “Impressive lightning! I underestimated you, fairy!”

The surrounding Eastern Sea cultivators surged forward to chase the others. Yu Yuwei released his violet-red cauldron, sending out several purple fire dragons to block their spells.

Most of these cultivators cultivated with a gray-white energy, similar to that of Qiu Ji, which could neutralize mana and break apart spells. Though their clothing differed, a closer look revealed that they were skilled at coordinating among them.

Li Qinghong had already exchanged several blows with Xi Chang. The mana in his hands was bright as pure and luminous moonlight. Though this was her first time seeing it, something about it felt deeply familiar.

She thought, It must be of the Supreme Yin element.

This was her first duel with a cultivator of the Supreme Yin element. She felt his mana to be both extremely Yin and luminously pure. It was not forceful, yet unyielding, like a gleaming, icy stone.

In the past, her opponents were either devil cultivators or orthodox immortals. Their mana was easily overwhelmed by her lightning. Only Miao Quan of the Southern Sea, who also wielded lightning, had held his own. Against all others, even those stronger than her, Li Qinghong was always on the offensive.

But Xi Chang, with his pure Supreme Yin mana, often responded unpredictably and deflected her attacks more often than not. Though slightly inferior in cultivation, he was calm and composed in his responses.

While she pondered in silence, Xi Chang was growing alarmed. He knew his own limits. His technique, based on Supreme Yin and pure Yin qi, was already a top-tier method. He had never encountered a worthy opponent in his life.

Yet this woman’s thunder techniques were truly fearsome. To make matters worse, she was growing more powerful with each exchange. Xi Chang secretly began to wonder, Could she be a direct heir of the Three Sects and Seven Gates? But I’ve never heard of any of them producing a renowned thunder cultivator...

The duel between the two continued with no clear victor, but Yu Yuwei and the others were starting to falter. The old man was facing three opponents alone, one of whom was a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. His hair and beard flared wildly as he fought fiercely.

Li Xizhi was faring slightly better as he held off two devil cultivators. But Li Quantao was surrounded by two others and found himself in grave danger.

He was already coughing blood and faltering. He looked ready to collapse.
