# Chapter 989: Securing the Armor

Qize.

The mountain forest was pitch-black, covered in white snow. The black and white merged in profound unity, creating a striking scene. As Li Ximing descended on his beam of light, he saw roiling demonic smoke churning below. A man in brown robes, his face wreathed in smiles, rode the wind up to greet him.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

He called out eagerly. Only then did Li Ximing recognize him. It really was Daoist Master Luo from the Southern Borderlands.

That fiend had finally stopped wearing his Thousand-Eye Devil Robe, having swapped it for a set of simple brown robes. His features weren't inherently sinister, and without the demonic attire, he almost looked respectable.

"Your noble clan had a bountiful harvest in the Grotto-Heaven. Congratulations!"

Li Ximing replied with a smile, "You flatter me! Daoist Master Luo, you also have a new air about you!"

Daoist Master Luo hadn't yet replied when Dingyang Zi, who was pacing around a stove on the mountain with his hands behind his back, let out a cold laugh.

"He got beaten so badly in the Grotto-Heaven that he's finally learned some restraint... which is good. It saves him from defiling my Sun-Worshipping Mountain!"

Li Ximing had seen Daoist Master Luo here more than once, so he assumed their relationship with Dingyang Zi ran deep. Still, given Daoist Master Luo's devilish path, a few sarcastic jabs were inevitable.

"Heh."

Daoist Master Luo chuckled, invited Li Ximing to sit at the table, and replied, "It was just using a few hairy folk. What's there to fuss about with those monkey-like things? I make my own decisions, live comfortably, and that's enough. What do other races have to do with me?"

Seeing Dingyang Zi sit down, Daoist Master Luo sneered, "Sometimes you give them too much face, and these hairy folk get full of themselves. Be ruthless, and they're grateful instead. Did the Descendants of Zhou spread everywhere by asking politely? No, they slaughtered their way there! Now, I use a few hairy folk, and they want to settle accounts with me."

Li Ximing guessed he must have been beaten badly and had his treasures stolen by some Northern Barbarian in the Grotto-Heaven, leaving him full of resentment. He didn't reply, just shook his head helplessly. But Dingyang Zi said:

"If not for that, you wouldn't have found it so easy to enter this Qize."

Li Ximing glanced over and noticed Dingyang Zi's expression was much more desolate, as if weighed down by heavy thoughts. He turned to look at him:

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, your harvest was good. It seems you're here about the Spirit Armor."

"Exactly!"

Refining a Spiritual Artifact took a long time. Since Li Ximing already had the materials, he naturally didn't want to delay. He immediately took several jade boxes from his sleeve, lined them up on the table, and introduced them:

"These are two Crimson Radiance Li Ambers and a Victory General Stone. One is Li Fire, one is Bright Yang. They should be suitable."

Dingyang Zi took them for a closer look and nodded silently. Only then did Li Ximing stand up and say solemnly, "I've heard that Sun-Worshipping Mountain possesses a quantity of Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold, an extremely precious spiritual material. My clan's Spirit Armor has gathered many spiritual resources, but it lacks a top-tier primary material. Please, Daoist Friend, name your price so I might trade for it."

Dingyang Zi had anticipated this when he first mentioned the spiritual material, so he wasn't surprised. He stroked his beard slightly and said softly, "That's reasonable. You previously left three Neck Feathers with me to trade for spiritual resources. I've already shown them to the Mount Qusi Dao Lineage. They are interested in a trade. Paired with some of my own items, it's just enough to trade for their Dao Lineage..."

His expression turned serious. "It's just... that Blameless Spirit Wood, I need to use it to trade with Daoist Friend Qinghu for something else... Are you willing, Daoist Friend?"

Li Ximing understood immediately. He had left his spiritual resources with this man for years; how could Dingyang Zi only focus on the materials for his Spirit Armor? He would certainly inquire about his own needs as well. In truth, he had likely already found buyers for everything, just waiting for Li Ximing to ask.

The price was fair. After all, the Blameless Spirit Wood itself was quite large and highly valuable. It had originally been acquired in exchange for two Neck Feathers.

'So, it's really five of my clan's spiritual resources in exchange for the Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold!'

The problem was, the Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold wasn't a complete portion; it was a remnant from a Sword Immortal's sword ornament. This made it less than ideal. As Li Ximing hesitated, Dingyang Zi took a golden box from his sleeve and said:

"Daoist Friend, you have been refining pills for me all these years without asking for payment. I have kept this in mind and naturally won't be greedy. There is still more than half a portion of this Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold remaining... If you give me one more spiritual resource, we can consider the crafting fee settled as well."

Li Ximing's heart skipped a beat. "Excellent!" he said, overjoyed. "My thanks, Daoist Friend!"

Having Dingyang Zi refine a Spiritual Artifact was no simple matter. A decent Spiritual Artifact would cost the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master several years, or even more than a decade, of effort. That didn't even account for the cost of various materials and the mental toll... It was absolutely not something that could be covered by a single spiritual resource.

Now, his past favors had settled the debt, and he had also secured the Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold. Li Ximing actually felt he still owed the man. He smiled. "If you need Spirit Pills refined in the future, Daoist Friend, just send someone to the lake!"

Dingyang Zi smiled and nodded, standing up decisively. He raised an eyebrow. "Then we'll use the Lesser Heavenly Li-Gold, Heavenly Star Crimson Gold, and Victory General Stonetwo Li Fire, one Bright Yangas the core. The Six-Aspect Spirit Stone, Huakan Golden Essence, and Crimson Radiance Li Amber will be supplementary, supported by Gloom-Profound Sky Iron, Bright-Flame Metal, and other materials..."

He calculated for a moment, then said in a low voice, "Unfortunately, the primary-grade spiritual materials are almost all Li Fire items. Their quality is high, so this armor will likely attune to Li Fire, and only be aspected toward Bright Yang."

Li Ximing frowned slightly. Daoist Master Luo shook his head. "It can't be helped. In this world, Bright Yang is in decline while Li Fire flourishes. When gathering spiritual materials normally, one will always find far more Li Fire than Bright Yang."

But Li Ximing was calculating inwardly: 'It's not necessarily bad. Zhouwei already has a full set of Bright Yang Spiritual Artifacts. Having more Li Fire will make it harder for others to scheme against him. Besides, Bright Yang-type metals and stones are hard to find. Dragging this out would be more trouble...'

'As for this last spiritual resource for him...'

Li Ximing still had two Neck Feathers. While fewer in number than the Crimson Radiance Li Ambers, they were still the most suitable. Although Wall-Sinking Water was becoming rarer, he could use Kuang Yu's Xinyu market to scour all of Zhulu. It might take two or three months, but he could always replenish his supply. It was a renewable resource.

But he didn't take them out immediately. Instead, he smiled, "I'll arrange it for you as soon as I return!"

He knew that the Li family was giving out more and more Neck Feathers, which was gradually attracting unwanted attention. Chen Yin, who cultivated the Mansion Water Dao, had specifically asked about it. If they continued to be so conspicuous, it would surely invite disaster.

'I should still ask around. It would be best if I could trade for something else to give him.'

"No hurry."

This payment could wait until after the Spirit Armor was refined. Dingyang Zi seemed to understand, but he hesitated, his expression suddenly turning strange. "I forgot about Daoist Master Minghuang... If he were willing to make a trip to Qize, spit a mouthful of blood essence into the spiritual fire, and use his will to establish the inherent rank of the White Qilin armor... the result might not be any worse than using a Bright Yang spiritual material..."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up, and understanding dawned. "Brilliant..."

A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator refines divine abilities and inherently possesses a high rank. Whether casting spells, refining pills, or forging artifacts, they often rely on this rank to succeed. And who had a higher rank than Li Zhouwei, the world-renowned White Qilin?

He filed this away in his mind, saying happily, "That is naturally an excellent idea. I'll go back and ask him. When you're ready, Daoist Friend, just send a letter to my lake!"

Dingyang Zi agreed. The two exchanged pleasantries for a while, and Daoist Master Luo finally found a chance to interject. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing! I also saw Daoist Master Minghuang in the Grotto-Heaven... My harvest wasn't as good as his. I only got some Pit Water. I heard... I heard... that a Gathering Wood type Spiritual Artifact fell into his hands... I was wondering..."

Li Ximing immediately knew he must be talking about their Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron. He smiled. "There was indeed such an item. It's very important to my clan. Perhaps there will be a time when we need your help, Daoist Friend... We can discuss it then."

He tactfully shut down Daoist Master Luo's idea of a trade but didn't miss the information revealed in his words. He smiled, "It seems you have some Pit Water materials on you, Daoist Friend!"

Daoist Master Luo hadn't expected him to turn the tables. He was stunned for a moment before replying, "That's right..."

Li Ximing waved his hand. "Do you have any spiritual resources that I might trade for?"

Seeing his sincerity, Daoist Master Luo simply raised a hand, took a box from his sleeve, and placed it on the table. "I have a Water-Mallow Stone. It's quite rare."

Li Ximing nodded.

He had no personal use for Pit Water items, but they made good gifts. The Xiao Family had moved to Cangzhou in the Northern Sea. Li Ximing was supposed to pay them a visit, and he naturally couldn't go empty-handed. He had a Cangzhou Serpent Scale, but that item came from Cangzhou. It might be related to the Xiao Family's new territory. It would be as awkward as visiting the Li family and presenting them with an expensive Wanling Flower.

The matter had been delayed because of the Wanling Heaven incident. Now that Li Zhouwei had returned, the lake was safe, and most importantly, he had more resources. It was time to pay that visit. Besides, he also hoped that Senior Daoist Master could offer some guidance on the current situation.

Although Daoist Master Luo didn't know why he wanted the spiritual material, he was very enthusiastic. "Daoist Friend, just take it! I have no use for it. You can repay me when you get some Gathering Wood spiritual resources."

But this man cultivated the Demonic Dao and was a fiend at heart. Li Ximing couldn't rest easy. He gave him a Gathering Wood Spirit Pill that a junior clansman had obtained from the Southern Township hall, added a Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill, and promised to refine pills for him, thus properly acquiring the item.

Daoist Master Luo's true intentions lay elsewhere, however. He smiled and asked for an introduction to Si Yuanli.

It wasn't a difficult request. Li Ximing understood perfectly and agreed. Without further discussion, he rose on his beam of light and traversed the Great Void. He finally felt a weight lift from his mind, having settled this pressing matter. He thought to himself:

'It's finally settled. I just need to pick up the Spirit Armor when it's done...'

But as he rode his light back to the lake, he frowned. He sensed the Purple Mansion Realm aura of the Upright Wood Dao!

"Hm?"

Who else could it be? It had to be Si Yuanli!

'Before I left, I told the juniors I'd be right back... It seems he was determined to wait for me here.'

He descended on his light, materializing in the pavilion at the foot of the mountain. Sure enough, he saw the Daoist Master standing patiently, looking calm but sighing repeatedly, his eyes betraying a deep anxiety.

"Daoist Friend Qinghu!"

Li Ximing smiled as he emerged from the void. Si Yuanli let out a breath of relief and turned, looking somewhat helpless. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing led him up the mountain, smiling. "Did you have a good harvest in the Grotto-Heaven, Daoist Friend? To come all the way here, you must need some Treasure Pills refined!"

At the mention of the Grotto-Heaven, Si Yuanli was rendered speechless. The words he had planned died in his throat. He let out a long sigh and shook his head. "Harvest? What harvest... I came out of seclusion thinking it was a new world, only to find that Azure Pond is a complete mess! How can this be called an Immortal Sect? How can this be called a Golden Core power?"

"What's wrong?"

Li Ximing seemed to recall something and asked solemnly. Si Yuanli looked up, a bitter smile on his face. "Zhaojing! Yang Zhuo has rebelled! The Mushroom Forest Plains have rebelled!"

Li Ximing froze. It took him a moment to process this. "Ah?" he asked, confused.

"Yang Zhuo?"

"Rebelled? Against whom?"

Si Yuanli sat down at the table with him, his expression one of pure frustration. He sighed. "Against Azure Pond... He killed the Azure Pond cultivators in the Mushroom Forest Plains market, listed their crimes, and has already crossed the plains into the Quanwu territory... He's raised a banner, 'Slaying Demons and Defending the Dao.'"

"Slaying Demons and Defending the Dao..."

The more Li Ximing heard, the more absurd it felt. He didn't know how to respondor whether to call it absurd or fitting.

The current Azure Pond was not what it once was. The chaos in Jiangbei had ripped away all pretense. Ning Wan herself was accused of great crimes. Even Azure Pond's own people no longer believed in their 'Immortal Sect' title, nailing the name 'Demon Sect' firmly to their mountain gate. To say 'Slaying Demons and Defending the Dao' was, in fact, not wrong at all.

But a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... leading a few followers who weren't even at that realm, claiming to overthrow Azure Pond? Which cultivator in all of Yue State wouldn't laugh out loud at that?

Even in its weakened state, Azure Pond could mobilize thirty or forty Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators without issue. And even if they failed to kill him, it would only take a single glance from a Purple Mansion Realm expert.

And yet, it was happening. And it was enough to make two Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters sit opposite each other on a mountain, struck speechless.

"His surname is Yang... Not only that, he bears the Mandate of Heaven..."

Li Ximing's own heart pounded. He offered the reminder, and Si Yuanli just lowered his head in vexation, sighing. "He must be blessed by the True Qi of Tianwu!"

How could he, Si Yuanli, not know? If his name wasn't Yang, if he wasn't blessed by True Qi, just for occupying the Mushroom Forest Plains, Yang Zhuo and his rabble would have died thousands of times over!

'Slaying Demons and Defending the Dao... What a fine 'Slaying Demons and Defending the Dao'! Whose fault is it that Azure Pond is in this state today? Now _he_ shows up to 'defend the Dao'... Where was he during the Demon Calamity? Where was he during the North-South conflict? Where was he when the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter fell?'

'If he really has the guts to defend the Dao, why doesn't he go overthrow the Pristine Water Rank! It's just a convenient excuse, isn't it? A rotten plaque they keep under a table, but pull out and polish whenever it suits them!'

The Daoist Master's face turned cold. He slammed his cup on the table and ground his teeth. "The great figures up high... they're going to push Azure Pond, push all of Yue State, right into the Yang Family's hands! How can this be! This is an Immortal Sect! How did it come to this!"

Li Ximing watched him with lowered eyes, pouring him some tea. "And what if it is? Hasn't it always been this way... You and I are Purple Mansion Realm. That gives us the qualification to pick a side, and the qualification to be pawns. The ones waiting for the axe to fall today are just those who haven't jumped off Azure Pond's sinking ship yet."

"But you, Daoist Friend... that might not be the case."

Si Yuanli raised his head to look at him, the anger and resentment on his face suddenly fading. He just nodded quietly. Li Ximing, however, met his gaze, his eyes bright with a smile. "Not a single member of the Si Family holds a key position. In the great Azure Pond Sect, the one managing affairs is a Guest Retainer named Qin."

"To say you are completely unprepared for this, Daoist Friend, would be to underestimate me."
