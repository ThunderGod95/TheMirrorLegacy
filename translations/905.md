# Chapter 905: One's Act Ends, Another's Begins

The dark clouds roiled. The battle had raged for a long time, and the clash of Divine Abilities battered the world, leaving the sky a mottled mess.

The Heavenly Balance Mystic-Governing Cloud was, by nature, a Spiritual Treasure capable of blanketing a region and staining the world crimson. But it was thwarted by the Great Daoist Master's Divine Ability, unable to cover the entire battlefield. Instead, the power of Veiled Yin surged upward, a rolling torrent of dim white vapor that broke through the crimson expanse in several places. This, combined with the golden radiance of the Buddhist Land, painted the heavens in a chaotic tapestry—a patch of gold in the east, a swathe of red in the west, all mixed with dark clouds and white mist.

The appearance of Veiled Yin's energy summoned furious gales and wrathful clouds that agitated the world. Its color was a dim, shadowy white, and from its darkest depths, streams of azure qi emerged. This qi transformed into layer upon layer of clouds, gathering beneath the Great Daoist Master's feet and echoing the censer in his hand, pouring forth like a relentless deluge.

Meanwhile, a white pearl hung suspended in the air, floating before Wei Xuanyin's brow. Faint cracks seemed to cover its surface, erupting with a blinding white light that seized the senses. This light formed blades and swords, stabbing down toward the Daoist Master below, who was wreathed in roiling black qi.

Kui Qi stood amidst the clouds, his hands forming spell arts. His black hair whipped wildly in the gale. Dark, blackish-red blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, rolling down onto his robes. As the drops hit the fabric, they transformed into a few ethereal feathers, only to be instantly torn to shreds by the wind.

He had already been fighting this opponent for some time. Their Divine Abilities had clashed, shifting and transforming dozens of times. He had brushed against death on several occasions, but had finally traded injury for an opportunity, securing a brief moment of stalemate.

One after another, pitch-black doppelgangers emerged from his body, taking up positions in every direction. Some held copper swords, others black chains. They were blasted into clouds of black qi by the unending barrage of white light, yet more and more dark figures continued to appear.

Kui Qi's lips were pale. His true form flickered constantly between the various doppelgangers, but he felt not an ounce of relief. His entire focus was fixed on his opponent's sleeve.

The Great Daoist Master operated his Divine Ability with an air of casual indifference, but a dangerous aura, like that of a venomous snake, emanated from that sleeve. It would periodically lock onto his real body from among the clones. If not for the profundity of his Daoist arts, which allowed him to resonate with his Divine Ability and weave between the doppelgangers, causing the lock to fail, that hidden *thing* would have struck long ago, like a viper lunging from its den.

The situation was far from optimistic. The white pearl hanging in the air was unleashing an ever-increasing torrent of white light, and the incantation seals his opponent was forming were nearing completion...

'I'm gathering the Nether-Merging Veiled Light in my own hands... but the technique he's preparing is likely even more powerful!'

Wei Xuanyin slowly lowered the two fingers he held before his lips. His strangely delicate eyes stared fixedly forward. He finally reined in his Divine Ability, and with a pinch of his fingers, drew forth a single point of light.

*Dong...*

Simultaneously, the bright white pearl in the sky began to spin, releasing an intensely blinding radiance. From it, thousands of snow-white beams erupted, descending like a dense downpour, instantly sweeping all of Kui Qi's dark doppelgangers from the sky.

Kui Qi's true form was forced into the open, flickering precariously within the rain of light.

His real body was clearly in a terrible state. His black hair was splayed like fine, distinct feathers. The black clouds coiling around him resembled a flock of owls in flight. From within his two sleeves, great ravens cried out, a sound like weeping and wailing, as they scrambled to pour forth. These creatures, with their large beaks and dark plumage, bristled with a ghostly, yin-heavy aura. They seemed to have long treated his robes as their roost, and their bloodcurdling cries were nothing short of demonic.

And that single point of light... It drifted gently amidst the snow-white storm. Its light was dim, cloaked in azure and silver, and as light as a goose feather. Yet, it closed the distance in an instant, arriving right before him.

There was no escape!

Kui Qi finally stopped his spell arts. He drew his copper sword with one hand, pressing two fingers of the other flat against the blade. His pupils dilated as he grit his teeth.

'Nether-Merging Veiled Light!'

Within the dense white light, a single point of absolute blackness appeared, like a duckweed floating in a storm—bobbing, swaying, and unstable. But his opponent's cultivation depth was too high, his casting speed far superior. How could such a hastily prepared counter hope to succeed?

*Clang!*

In the glare of the white light, the copper sword's own radiance rapidly faded, revealing its base metal. The next instant, that point of light pressed down on the blade. The force sent Kui Qi and his sword sinking. The Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword bent visibly, and the two fingers pressed against it dissolved rapidly, dissipating into trails of black qi.

Kui Qi's expression remained unchanged. He activated his Body Divine Ability as five talismans plastered to his body exploded simultaneously, erupting in black smoke. He took one step back, his form dissolving into black qi.

As he retreated, another 'Kui Qi' was left behind in his original position. It channeled all its dharma power to block the descending point of light.

*Boom!*

A dense column of black qi rocketed into the sky. The real Kui Qi, now reappeared, spat out a mouthful of blood. His Dharma Body was covered in fractures. He snapped his head around, only to see the pinkish light from the plains below almost flooding the heavens. Even Touba Ci was vomiting blood, his arm severed, his body surging with Profound Yellow Qi.

But he had only just escaped. Where was Wei Xuanyin's figure in the sky?

The man in white was long gone, leaving only that bright white orb to radiate sharp, white light from among the clouds. Wei Xuanyin was the Grand Preceptor of Zhao State, not just because of his four Veiled Yin Divine Abilities, but because he was a master of the art of calculation, allowing him to appear here so unexpectedly!

The moment Kui Qi shattered the five talismans to escape, the Life Divine Ability that had been locked onto him, 'Owl Chases the Leopard Cat', finally dissipated. The white-robed Great Daoist Master's Divine Ability flared, and he instantly appeared at Kui Qi's side, his sleeve wide open.

*Rumble!*

But it was the Great Void that rumbled first. Wei Xuanyin's sleeve trembled slightly, as if a long hook had snagged his wrist, yanking it upward. A flash of white light vanished, and the patch of sky his sleeve had been aimed at turned a vast, dim white, becoming an empty void of spiritual energy filled with the howling wind of annihilation.

Kui Qi had narrowly escaped catastrophe, but his arm had been grazed by the Light of Veiled Yin. The aftershock alone was enough to disintegrate his flesh, leaving only stark white bone. Countless finger-sized white jade shrews were crawling over the bone, gnawing at it frantically.

"Oh?"

Wei Xuanyin looked up, a hint of confusion on his face. Suddenly, two narrow mountain ranges pressed in on him from either side. The clouds dispersed, and a stream flowed beneath his feet, as if he were standing on a small boat. He was being drawn into a narrow pass where overlapping cliffs blocked out all light.

His fine eyebrows shot up in surprise.

"Holding the Ridge!"

Sure enough, an old man stood in the distant clouds, holding a white jade fishing rod. With a slight lift of the rod, he had locked onto Wei Xuanyin's sleeve from afar, snaring his Divine Art.

It was Xiao Chuting!

"So, you're interfering as well..."

Wei Xuanyin seemed to know him well. He even raised an eyebrow, a flicker of pleasure in his eyes. His Divine Ability carried his voice across the distance to Xiao Chuting's cloud.

"How interesting," he said.

"You've repaired the Pit Water... Fellow Daoist Xiao, you had best be sure which household's gate you're standing before!"

The old man in the sky gave a helpless little shake of his head, but Wei Xuanyin didn't believe the expression for a second. His eyes narrowed, studying Xiao Chuting, as if pondering something...

'They have sown discord for years. The Chunyi Dao Gate and Mount Jingyi share a blood feud; Xuanyi cannot come, nor would he dare... And with Crimson Reef Island making moves, the Chunyi Dao Gate is also immobilized...'

'I recall there are a few Purple Mansion Realm rogue cultivators in Jiangbei, but they wouldn't dare take a side in this. Yuandao has spent years distancing itself; it won't give the Peacocks leverage at a time like this...'

'And we still have *him*... All the pieces are on the board... Now, we just watch the situation unfold!'

Wei Xuanyin made no move. Their eyes met for only a second, but the long fishing line stretching through the Great Void snapped taut, humming as if on the verge of breaking. Xiao Chuting gazed at him calmly and replied via a divine message, his voice soft:

"The Xiao clan once received aid from the Xiukui. Though I was in seclusion in the Northern Sea, I had no choice but to emerge to repay this favor. Forgive my offense!"

*Whoosh!*

The drifting yin clouds instantly blotted out the surrounding sky. Kui Qi had already teleported away. Pitch-black Divine Ability and dharma power covered his body, suppressing the Veiled Yin wound on his forearm. He felt a wave of weakness and aching pain wash over him.

But just as he escaped, all traces of relief vanished. He came to an abrupt, stiff halt in mid-air.

Not far from him stood a Daoist clad in pale-yellow feathered robes, which were embroidered with circular patterns. A Dharma sword was strapped to his back, looking exceptionally bright against the gloomy sky.

He had willow-leaf eyes and a rather scholarly air. One hand was held out before him, holding a lantern with a twelve-sided glass body and a copper base, which cast a soft, pale-yellow light.

Black-red blood trickled from Kui Qi's mouth. The Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery's brief shock passed, leaving only ice in his eyes.

'Changxiao!'

This was the Great Daoist Master who had been missing for years—Changxiao, who had fought against the Hengzhu Daoist tradition for so long!

Wei Xuanyin and Xiao Chuting stared at each other through the clouds, not a shred of surprise in either of their eyes. Only the Luoxia Plain below fell utterly silent. Even the several Mahas were stunned.

"Daoist Master Changxiao?!"

The silence lasted but a moment before a soft, floating sound echoed from the Great Void.

*"Twang!"*

It was the sound of a string snapping—seemingly from the edge of the horizon, yet also right beside one's ear. The white jade fishing rod in Xiao Chuting's hand sprang up, releasing a faint white glow. Down below, the white-robed Great Daoist Master smiled brilliantly as his bulging, tightly bound sleeve finally burst open!

In that fleeting instant, all the Divine Abilities and dharma power on the battlefield erupted. An infinite, dim white light poured from Wei Xuanyin's sleeve, connecting heaven above and the mountains below. The perilous peaks that had locked onto the 'small boat' stopped contracting, forced to dissipate by the sky-rending white light.

"Changxiao!"

The most hateful and enraged person at this moment was undoubtedly Hengli. The Daoist Master's eyes swept up, his pupils reflecting the lantern-bearing figure in the sky. His first instinct was to abandon the golden-blooded Maha in his grasp and step into the Great Void to fight Changxiao!

But the Great Daoist Master in the pale-yellow robes remained expressionless. The lantern in his hand exploded with dazzling brilliance. Behind his head, a white, mirror-like jade disc, etched with osmanthus patterns, emerged from its hidden state, shimmering into glorious view.

He had hidden for so long. How could he possibly miss?

This attack was worlds apart from the one he had used when pursuing Li Ximing, testing the attitudes of Luoxia and the Dragon-kin. In an instant, the world lost its color and thunder cracked. The iridescent light from the twelve-sided glass lantern shone on Kui Qi's face, reflecting a glittering golden light in his dark pupils.

The Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword was raised again, straining to block the golden light. The sound of grinding metal filled the air as black qi scattered, dissolving into a sky-full of gray rain.

As thunder roared, Ning Wan's cold voice suddenly echoed through the sky,

"Yan Jianxiao! How dare you disregard the grace of the lands that nurtured your Dao!"

The voice reverberated. Daoist Master Changxiao finally turned his head, just slightly, as if his own birth name now sounded unfamiliar. A small smile touched his lips.

'Isn't this precisely to repay the Chi clan's favor?'

...

Xiaoshi Mountain.

Dust and smoke churned. The Purple Qi that had lingered for so long finally dispersed, revealing a landscape of ruins. A golden light streaked by. A massive golden body lay toppled on the ground, humming weakly as plumes of blue-green flames flickered across its surface, looking utterly spent.

Xuwang retracted the golden body, reverting to his form as a portly, large-eared monk. He rode a magical breeze down to the ground, where his fellow disciples were still shouting:

"Give us a hand! We don't have a Treasured Artifact protecting us like you do. This woman's fire is truly vicious!"

Xuwang casually tossed the wooden fish in his hand downward. It pulsed with white light, aiding his disciples in extinguishing the flames on their bodies. He then turned his head, smiling at the Daoist Master standing nearby.

"Fellow Daoist Helian! Many thanks for your assistance. If it weren't for you, there's no telling how long it would have taken to drive that woman away!"

The man before him held a long-handled *zhao* blade, a weapon that was neither spear nor halberd. His face was handsome, his feathered robes snow-white, and eighteen glass prayer beads hung at his waist. He cut a truly imposing figure—it was Helian Wumeng.

But the expression of this Helian clan Daoist Master, this great general of the Tiefu Kingdom, was flat, even tinged with disgust. His handsome eyes were cold as he said frostily,

"Don't try to cozy up to me. No matter what, Tinglan is from one of the Three Profound Daoist traditions, a true orthodox line. What do you all count as? If not for the Grand Preceptor's orders, I wouldn't care if every last one of you died!"

The Helian clan had once been on good terms with the Way of Emtiness, but they had fallen out long ago due to certain events. Their current relationship was far from good—in fact, until today, they had been enemies. Naturally, he had no pleasantries to offer. They were merely acting under the same orders.

As orthodox demonic cultivators of the Heavenly Embryo Dao, the Helian clan considered themselves superior. Their foundation in the Great Void was a Diverse Mansion, and they measured themselves against the likes of the Supreme Yang Dao of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao. They viewed the blood-drinking cultivators of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao as a laughable, divergent path. With such pride in their hearts, how could he possibly look upon this monk as an equal?

The monk wasn't angered by the rebuke. He just chuckled.

"Fellow Daoist Helian has quite the personality!"

Helian Wumeng was well-known in both the northern and southern deserts. As the *qilin* son of the Helian clan, he was held in high regard by Helian Wujiang. His cultivation and Divine Abilities were far stronger than the other Helian clan Purple Mansion Realm cultivator currently stationed in Hetao, and also higher than Xuwang's. The monk, of course, wouldn't dare take offense. He sidled closer and whispered,

"I wonder what orders the General received? Is it to attack the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain with us?"

Although the Tangdao Mountain Range had a grand array, a single, hastily constructed Purple Mansion Realm formation couldn't possibly cover the entire range. There were many smaller formations, making it a juicy prize. The five Merciful Ones needed someone to stand guard here. Xuwang had a stronger background, so he was naturally entitled to a piece of the pie, but he was cautious by nature and hoped to rope in a reliable fighter like Helian Wumeng.

Helian Wumeng gave him a cold, sarcastic smile.

"Stupid monk. The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain will be in our grasp sooner or later. It's just a temporary stronghold, what good could be in there? A formation core, at best? Do you think that would ever fall into our hands? My lord has already set out from Caishan. One from the west, one from the east, we will advance south together, bypass the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, and converge at the Three Rivers region! The *real* prizes are the undefended Purple Mansion Realm factions along the river!"

Xuwang nodded repeatedly, smiling without a word. It wasn't really a matter of right or wrong. His goal was to defeat enemies in the conflict between north and south, between the Immortals and the Buddhists, and to expand the Buddhist Land. This was naturally different from a demonic cultivator's pursuit of resources. He only smiled and said,

"I'll just remind you of one thing, Fellow Daoist: don't forget that Tinglan and the others have only retreated..."

Helian Wumeng scoffed.

"Will Tinglan flee all the way to the Purple Smoke Blessed Land, or will she go to the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain to provide support? Do you think I'm stupid enough to attack the Purple Smoke Blessed Land? Take your band of trash and get lost!"

With that, he rode the wind, rising up and over the mountain. He left Xuwang standing there, his smile fading, his expression turning cold.

'A bunch of Northern Barbarians... If the Qi Emperor hadn't thrown them a few scraps, they'd still be herding horses in some forgotten corner. How dare they act so arrogant in front of my Seven Phases...'

It was common for the northern Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to look down on the Merciful Ones. These Daoist Masters often felt that only those at the Maha level were their equals. Direct disdain, like Helian Wumeng's, was not rare. Xuwang could only curse inwardly. He turned and asked,

"What are you all dawdling for? The quick get the prize, the slow get nothing! If we can intercept a retreating Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, that would be a huge gain!"

His status was clearly higher, and his question carried the weight of a command. Two of the remaining four immediately rose into the air and followed behind him.

"Please instruct us, Senior Brother!"
