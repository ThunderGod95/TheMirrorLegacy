# Chapter 966: Arrangements for the Wave-Suppressing Mansion

Li Zhouwei raised his cup, lost in thought. He remained pensive and silent. Li Que'wan had just returned from the mountain pass, clearly having escorted someone to the base. When she suddenly encountered this scene, she immediately moved to withdraw.

But Li Zhouwei set his cup down, gesturing for her to come closer and listen as he replied,

"All the great families share the same view. Fairy Qiuhu's actions set the precedent. The mighty Underworld has sent one of its own to reincarnate. Even if this person isn't as unique as the Grand Ancestor, how far off could they be?

"Those involved in this, whether supporting or opposing it, are certainly at the level of the Dragon-kin or Luoxia. At the very least, they are figures on par with Xiyan or the North Star Lady. As for the few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan, or the one or two Supreme Yang Daoist tradition that have lost their True Monarch's protection... their only choice is to offend no one and silently observe."

Li Jiangqian nodded. He understood his father’s references, 'Sheng Bai' was Xiyan, and 'Northern Lesser Yang' was the North Star Lady. Now that both were major figures in the world, their names couldn't be used lightly. He ventured,

"I agree. Even if we know this person is born extraordinary, the clan should not send anyone to offer support or curry favor in advance. We must guard against a clash between those two peak factions. Even the aftershocks from their battle could destroy our family."

Li Zhouwei sipped his tea.

"The clan should indeed stay out of it. Your younger brother said he wouldn't ask the family for help, which was likely his subtle way of warning us, What Yang Zhuo is doing is of immense consequence. We must not interfere."

His expression grew grave. Looking at his two most outstanding juniors, he lowered his voice.

"What you two must do is achieve a divine ability as soon as possible. Even if having a divine ability doesn't make you a player in this grand game... once you have one, you are at least someone in the eyes of those lofty daoist traditions. Barring those with special circumstances who must stay behind, any cultivator at the Purple Mansion Realm, if they're willing to grit their teeth and abandon their foundations on the mainland, can carve out a territory for themselves overseas—a place to be their own master, bowing to no one."

Li Que'wan had only caught this last part of the conversation, but she understood they were discussing Yang Zhuo. She bowed slightly, replying in unison with Li Jiangqian, "We understand."

Li Zhouwei said quietly, "I may have some special status, but I am merely an exposed piece in the great game between North and South. Some conflicts and schemes will inevitably land on me, and I won't be able to escape. In their eyes, our clan's current affairs are a convenient handle to grasp me. The day their goals are met, I might perish... and the clan's future will fall to your Grand-Uncle and you two."

His gaze swept over them, passing the silently nodding Li Jiangqian to rest meaningfully on Li Que'wan. "Whether we end up reduced to Chongzhou or adrift overseas, it doesn't matter. As long as we have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, we can preserve some of the bloodline. If we lose even that... we will lose the right to even be pitied!"

A knot of sorrow tightened in Li Que'wan's chest. She nodded silently, her mind racing.

'The clan's secrets are being moved to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. It's safe, yes... but the immortal artifact has already vanished into the Great Void. If the clan suffers a calamity and our lineage is severed, we might lose contact with it forever! Ensuring the Purple Mansion Realm succession is the most critical task of all.'

As she mulled this over, Li Zhouwei turned and asked, "Is there any news from the Blessed Land?"

Li Que'wan shook her head, clearly having already inquired about this. "The Blessed Land is sealed, covered by a great formation. No letters have come through... but there is word from the Eastern Sea."

Li Zhouwei frowned. "The Xinyu Archipelago? Queyi?"

With the Purple Smoke Gate sealed, it was naturally difficult to protect their overseas interests. The once-famous Xinyu Archipelago was still operational, but few cultivators remained on the islands.

Li Que'wan nodded, a rare smile appearing at the mention of Li Queyi.

"When Purple Smoke sealed its gates, it left Cao Chu, Wei Danying, and their followers in the Xinyu Archipelago, effectively handing control to those few families. Sometime later, a Daoist Master arrived, claiming to be one of the rogue cultivators. Her name was Kuang Yu."

"So, it was Daoist Master Kuang Yu!"

Li Zhouwei mused, finding this logical. Since Purple Smoke could no longer control its overseas assets, it made sense that Daoist Master Kuang Yu—a Daoist Master close to the Supreme Yang Dao Lineage who had helped them in several great battles—would receive it as a reward.

Li Que'wan affirmed gently, "However, many suspect... that Daoist Master Zhu Gong is also hiding there."

"But ever since Purple Smoke's direct line withdrew, Sister Queyi has become a highly respected figure. They all treat her with great importance, and even Daoist Master Kuang Yu asked for her name. She has sent several very emotional letters home about it."

Her tone shifted. "Unfortunately, when Purple Smoke sealed its gates, Quexi was in the Blessed Land attempting a breakthrough. She must be locked inside and unable to leave."

"Mm."

Li Zhouwei wasn't surprised. Regardless of what favors or methods Purple Smoke had left behind to protect the Xinyu Archipelago, they wouldn't go so far as to trouble the Li family's direct line. He had a clear picture of the situation and asked, "How are things with the Zhuang family in the Great Desert?"

Although the Daoist Master had asked about the Zhuang family, Li Que'wan knew who he was truly inquiring about. She replied respectfully,

"The grand strategy has caused some ripples, but Golden Feather is strong, and few dare to act recklessly... However, it's said that Zhuang Pingye has been traveling for several years and isn't often in the Great Desert. It was Aunt Xinghan who stepped in to handle the recent turmoil. She has become quite famous."

Li Zhouwei nodded and dismissed the two. Only then did a middle-aged man ascend the mountain path.

The man appeared capable and sharp, though his middle-aged face was etched with apprehension. His black hair looked damp, tied in locks on either side. He clutched his robes, approached trembling, and dropped to the ground, not daring to look up. He kowtowed, his voice thick with tears.

"This old vassal pays his respects... to the Grand Concord of Radiance!"

"Rise."

Li Zhouwei paused, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. He studied the man with a trace of nostalgia. The strong, capable man from all those years ago was now a cultivator in the Foundation Establishment Realm, though that same shrewdness remained. He smiled. "It hasn't been easy for you."

Dili Youjie finally looked up, though he still didn't dare meet Li Zhouwei's gaze, fixing his eyes on his boots. His voice trembled, "This old vassal... is blessed to see you again, My Lord..."

Li Zhouwei asked, "You're cultivating 'Geng Metal'?"

"Reporting to My Lord! I was fortunate to be granted a cultivation art by the Lake... yes, it is 'Geng Metal'!"

Dili Youjie had leaped from being a lowly slave outside the Great Jue Court to the throne of the northern Eastern Yue entirely because of Li Zhouwei. When he later began cultivating, the cultivators on the Lake mostly discriminated against the Eastern Yue. Dili Youjie's so-called "royal" title meant nothing. Only by using his wits and borrowing Li Zhouwei's name could he command respect.

He understood perfectly that it was only because he had followed Li Zhouwei for that period that he had succeeded so often in the latter half of his life, obtaining such a fine cultivation method and resources.

Every time Dili Youjie startled awake at midnight, he couldn't help but wonder, if he hadn't camped outside the Great Jue Court that day... he, Dili Youjie, would still be that pathetic wretch with laughable cultivation. Even now, as a cultivator in the Foundation Establishment Realm, his terror was greater than ever, afraid it was all a dream.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him, a plan forming in his mind.

'Geng Metal... his strength is barely passable, but his loyalty is commendable.'

He made a decision. He casually retrieved a 'Geng Metal' dharma artifact from his sleeve. It was a small, palm-sized golden sword.

"This is just a 'Geng Metal' Dharma sword," he instructed. "It's used for casting spell arts, not for direct clashes. Keep it well. Since Que'Wan was the one who brought you here, you will follow her from now on. Run errands for her, deliver messages... you'll be reliable for that."

"Yes!"

The Eastern Yue man departed in a state of terrified gratitude, clutching the sword to his chest as tears streamed down his face.

Li Zhouwei took a single, gentle step forward. The world dissolved and reformed around him, and he was standing inside a pagoda crackling with lightning. He closed his eyes briefly, the light of the sun and moon swirling at his side. He had arrived in the Grotto-Heaven.

A Daoist Master in white-gold robes sat leisurely inside a brilliant, glowing pavilion, carefully reading a scroll. A fist-sized Li Fire sparrow perched obediently on his shoulder. He had clearly been waiting for some time.

Li Zhouwei bowed. "Grand-Uncle!"

Li Ximing smiled, saying nothing. With a flip of his hand, he produced a jade bottle. "Six Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills!" he replied. "With the ones you already have, this should be enough for more than a decade!"

With the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll and the Profound Shell Flower-Leaves in the hands of an Alchemist as superb as Li Ximing, the number of pills was naturally delightful.

Li Zhouwei accepted them with thanks and began to calculate. "Grand-Uncle, you received six Neck Feathers back then. You entrusted three to Sun-Worshipping Mountain, Chen Yin traded for two, and one was just traded for the Profound Shell Flower-Leaves. Do you have any remaining?"

Li Ximing smiled. "My original guess was correct. That cave-mansion is a real treasure trove. Three more have condensed since then, and adding the one that took a full year to form before Senior Liu Changdie arrived, I had four in hand. Now, having traded one for the Profound Shell Flower-Leaves, there are still three left."

But at the mention of this, he became somewhat anxious.

"We must be more frugal, however. The massive, continuous acquisition of Wall-Sinking Water has left us short twice in a row. It took over six months to gather a full supply, wasting a lot of time. I estimate it will only get more difficult... Because of this, I sent people to check the markets in the Eastern Sea, and they finally went to the Xinyu Archipelago."

Li Zhouwei looked up, intrigued.

Li Ximing chuckled. "We even met that Daoist Master Kuang Yu... and just managed to gather the next six-month supply of Wall-Sinking Water. She’s an interesting one. She achieved the Dao through a Life Divine Ability and managed to withdraw from this whole struggle unscathed. Now she has a territory of her own."

Li Zhouwei nodded slowly. "Is Senior Liu... planning to cultivate in the Wave-Suppressing Mansion?"

Li Ximing hesitated. "I wouldn't call it cultivating. His Dao-path is severed. His only real interest now is researching formations. The great formation at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion is incredibly profound; it's more than enough to keep him occupied. I expect he'll be in the vicinity for years."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "If that's the case, I have two matters to discuss with you, Grand-Uncle."

"First, the Wall-Sinking Water is extremely important. We can't keep scrambling to gather it day by day. 'Mansion Water' originates from the Western Sea. I must ask you to make a trip and establish a stable trade route, rather than having us run around randomly in a place where 'Mansion Water' is scarce."

This sparked an idea in Li Ximing. "Perfect. We just got a new batch of Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills. There's Yangya in the Western Sea. Other cultivators might not know, but I'm a Bright Yang cultivator myself—I know exactly how potent this pill is. He'll be desperate for it. Although he doesn't want contact with our family, we now have Daoist Friend Changdie. He can represent us!"

Li Zhouwei's eyes lit up. "Wonderful... Wall-Sinking Water alone might not be enough of a trade, but that fellow has been at the Purple Mansion Realm for many years. He must have other Bright Yang treasures. If we can exchange spirit pills for them, it's practically a zero-cost trade for our family."

Even though Yangya held a deep grudge against their family, neither Daoist Master cared. Getting good treasures was what mattered. They exchanged a look, and Li Ximing grinned.

"Leave it to me!"

Li Zhouwei changed the subject. "Second, the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. Though it's in a barren land, we're realizing its divine-profound value is immeasurable. It could be the foundation for the clan's rise, and it's also an excellent escape route."

Li Ximing's expression turned solemn as Li Zhouwei explained the situation with the Yuan family. He was aghast. "The Wu State is just descending into chaos, and now the Yang clan is striking again? These are omens of a great upheaval."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "I've been considering this recently. We must prepare our escape route early. Zongquan Island was where I had my breakthrough and it's now saturated with Bright Yang energy, drawing a lot of attention. It might be useful later. But the Wave-Suppressing Mansion is the other key. It still lacks a strong figure to manage it... Grand-Uncle... I want to send Que'Wan."

"Que'Wan?"

Li Ximing mused.

Li Zhouwei continued, "The Wave-Suppressing Mansion already has a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator guarding it, and you visit often. It's located among remote barbarian tribes, making it safer than the mainland, especially this turbulent riverbank. Since it's our escape route, we can let Que'Wan go there. One, to manage it properly. Two, to let her cultivate in peace and prepare for the Purple Mansion Realm."

Li Zhouwei had clearly been pondering this for some time. "I'll have Dili Youjie accompany her. He was king of the Eastern Yue for decades. The Eastern Sea doesn't care about one's background, which actually makes it easier to operate. He can handle the trivial matters for her."

"Very well..." Li Ximing hesitated for a moment before agreeing.

Li Zhouwei then took the golden slip for Emperor Qi's Light from his sleeve and handed it over. "I have achieved initial mastery of this spell art. My insights and annotations are all recorded on the slip for your reference, Grand-Uncle."

"Good..." Li Ximing accepted it, clearly delighted.

Although it only took Li Zhouwei nine months to master Emperor Qi's Light, it was an exceedingly complex spell art. They had arranged this nine months ago when they first acquired it; Li Ximing had not started training it, focusing instead on refining his immortal foundation. He was waiting for Li Zhouwei to master it and pass on the annotated slip, which would save him many detours.

And while Li Ximing had been tempering his immortal foundation, he hadn't wasted the fragments of time. With the clan's affairs off his mind, he felt liberated. He had been cultivating peacefully, occasionally discussing the Dao with other Daoist Masters to improve his Dao-Profundity. It was a comfortable life! Furthermore, he had obtained the Li Fire, a rare and wondrous treasure, and had been secretly studying the Great Parting's White Brilliance. He could now condense four instances of Great Parting's Red Radiance!

'About one per year... even if it gets harder, it will take at most another seven or eight years to gather ten. Then the power of the spell art will ascend to a whole new level!'

Now, accepting the golden slip, Li Ximing exuded an air of carefree leisure. He grinned. "Perfect. I'll just go to the Lake to collect the Wall-Sinking Water, and I'll be right back to get her!"
