# Chapter 876: The Treasure Elephant

Southern Borderlands.

In the past, the Azure Pond Sect was attacked by the Great Konghai Temple, costing them the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang and, consequently, North Dan Island. They had since retreated to the coastal prefecture of Hezhou, only a few dozen miles from Beidan.

This location was in the Southern Borderlands; it faced North Dan Island to the north, while its back was to Hengzhu and the Azure Pond's main territory. Because it was established as a temporary line of retreat, its defensive forces were not strong; they were, in fact, quite weak.

After all, Hezhou was not a strategic pass. Further north, past Hezhou, Yi Mountain City stood as the true first line of defense for the Southern Borderlands. Seizing Hezhou would be useless to the Great Konghai Temple, and might even provoke Hengzhu into action.

Both sides understood this. The Azure Pond Sect would not normally have needed to guard this location, but the western edge of the Shitang territory hugged the Southern Borderlands' coastline, stretching far inland. Along this narrow strip of land lay the Shahuan Kingdom, which called itself the "South of the Southlands."

The local Daoist Master Zhusheng was an ally of the Azure Pond Sect and a close friend of the Si family. With the fall of Shitang, his kingdom was left completely exposed to the claws of the Great Konghai Temple. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, fearing a domino effect, felt it was critical to have someone watching over the Southern Borderlands.

Li Ximing arrived from the north, riding his Profound Light. Following close behind was Yan Hu, clad in black robes and holding a spear. They landed, and a quick glance revealed that the cultivator guarding Hezhou was an acquaintance: an Eastern Yue cultivator named Fei Luoya.

When this old Eastern Yue saw the Daoist Master, he immediately hurried over and bowed deeply.

"Fei Luoya pays his respects, Daoist Master! Congratulations on the unification of the Lake, and congratulations to the Immortal Clan!"

This old fellow was indeed the same Fei Luoya who had been a disciple of Mount Wu all those years ago. He had actually managed to survive until today, and by the looks of it, had achieved a respectable status.

When Duanmu Kui died, his disciples scattered to the winds. Some immediately joined the Azure Pond Sect, but Fei Luoya laid low, choosing instead to befriend the Li clan. As expected, the Chi family had no real respect for those Mount Wu cultivators. After seizing their cultivation methods and spell arts, they used them all as cannon fodder.

Fei Luoya quickly realized the Lake was no place to linger. He scrambled for options and finally managed to get a position in Yi Mountain City. Later, when Chi-Ning took charge of the Azure Pond Sect, Fei Luoya, with his keen political instincts, managed to flourish and earn considerable merit.

Now, this Eastern Yue had finally made something of himself. He had several Azure Pond Sect disciples following him, all showing him great respect. Li Ximing watched, nodding and suppressing a laugh, as the old man spoke, his voice thick with emotion:
"Seeing you today, Daoist Master, is like gazing upon the bright sun in the heavens. It reminds me of my past association with Senior Tongya, who was like a towering mountain. The memory fills me with such melancholy..."

Li Ximing, however, had read the clan history and had even met this fellow in his youth. Back then, Fei Luoya had been far from polite; the Li clan ancestors had been forced to humor him and tread carefully. Now, after being tempered in the mortal world, his words had certainly become much smoother. He was clearly just trying to latch onto their prestige. Li Ximing simply waved his hand.
"It's good that you're here. I've come to the Southern Borderlands on behalf of Daoist Master Qiuhu to stand guard. I need to pay a visit to the Shahuan Kingdom. You can lead the way."

Li Ximing had not come all the way to the Southern Borderlands for nothing. Since he was here, he naturally had to make arrangements for Yan Hu and inquire about the Great Konghai Temple. But most important of all was the Bright Yang Spiritual Artifact held by Songzhou's King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou!

This was information he had obtained through the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's connections. He was already in the Southern Borderlands, and Songzhou was just across the Shitang Sea. To pay a visit and inquire about the Spiritual Artifact—that would make this journey truly worthwhile.

Fei Luoya quickly stepped onto the Profound Light. Li Ximing activated it, traversing the Great Void as they flew south. Below, he saw dense forests, sparse farmland, and long, narrow mountain ranges—a landscape quite different from that of Yue State. Li Ximing glanced down and asked:

"What people live here? They look like foreigners."

Fei Luoya replied with a sigh:
"The Shahuan people are also barbarians. In ancient times, they were called the Jiaozhi. They're probably even less orthodox than my Eastern Yue... It's only because a Daoist Master cultivates here that they've managed to become somewhat respectable."

Li Ximing nodded silently and finally asked the question that concerned him most:
"This Daoist Master Zhusheng... is he a Shahuan native?"

This was not a simple question. Although the north and south were fragmented and the Celestial Dynasty was no more, the dividing line between the civilized heartlands and the "barbarian" territories was still stark. Even an Eastern Yue who reached the Foundation Establishment Realm was considered inferior everywhere he went. If this Daoist Master Zhusheng was a Shahuan native, his culture and customs would likely make him difficult to deal with.

Fortunately, Fei Luoya shook his head quickly and lowered his voice. "This Daoist Master's surname is Liu. His family is quite famous. Years ago, when the Chu State unified Jiangnan, it declared itself the Southern Dynasty in opposition to the north. They sent an army to pacify the Jiaozhi, fighting all the way south to the Zhan State. They established the Annan Military Governorate, which comprised seven prefectures and fifty-six cities. The Military Governor at that time was surnamed Liu, and his name was Yi."

"This Governor was a Daoist Master who had achieved divine abilities. He fell when the Chu State collapsed. Daoist Master Zhusheng is his descendant, and his ancestral home is the Mushroom Forest Plains."

Li Ximing nodded, impressed. 'So he's the scion of a famous house,' he thought.

'His strength must be considerable. And he also has a Snow Ridge Listening Pine Fox... He cannot be underestimated.'

'But... his surname is Liu, and he was a Chu State Governor. The imperial surname of the Chu State was also Liu. When you really think about it, his background is likely far from humble. His family's situation might be quite similar to my own...'

'In its later years, the Chu State's government was chaotic, with right and wrong inverted to a terrifying degree. The throne was unstable, and in the end, the Xiao-Wu faction usurped it. The entire imperial clan was overthrown, their fate even more tragic than that of the Wei-Li clan. But karma was swift; the new Wu State eventually lost its eastern territories and was forced to retreat to the Shu region.'

They flew over the Shahuan people below and soon spotted an immortal mountain. A cultivator wearing the tall hat and wide robes of a scholar flew up on the wind to greet them, bowing respectfully. "Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing. My master has been awaiting your arrival. Please, descend and rest."

Li Ximing descended on his light.

Compared to Nine Mounds or Xiukui, Daoist Master Zhusheng's immortal mountain was a clear tier below. It looked rather ordinary, and it lacked the vast expanse of Moongaze Lake. As they descended, they saw a pavilion from which flames blazed, a sign of active artifact refinement.

A cultivator in Daoist robes was lounging lazily beneath the pavilion. He looked quite young and remarkably handsome. Meditation cushions were scattered around him in disarray. Only when he saw Li Ximing did this Daoist Master finally stand up, a smile on his face.

"Greetings, Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing's gaze swept the area. On a small table sat several wine jugs and a single longsword, lying flat. Everything looked quite ordinary.

'Early Purple Mansion Realm, with two divine abilities... What a free-spirited character.'

This Daoist Master Zhusheng cultivated the Dao of Jade True, making him a direct beneficiary of True Monarch Shangyuan's ascension. He had an ethereal, transcendent air, and though his robes were disheveled, it only made him seem more casual and natural.

"Please!"

The two sat at the table. Daoist Master Zhusheng poured wine and smiled. "You've come all this way south, Daoist Friend. I must thank you. This is, after all, aid from a thousand miles away."

Li Ximing offered a polite platitude. "It was nothing. I was simply amazed by your and your friend's profound transformation art. To deceive a Maha to his face... it truly broadened my horizons."

"Ah." The Daoist Master's voice was clear and bright. He turned his head and called out with a smile, "Go and invite Daoist Master Xian Chan, the King of East Ridge."

After giving the order, he turned back, his expression turning serious. "It is the nature of Jade True, after all. It's also known as the 'Jade True Six-Nine Void,' the Dao of Transformations between illusion and reality. Among the Three Shamans, its transformations are the most realistic, the most enduring, and the closest to the Immortal Dao. After the True Monarch achieved his Dao using jade, imitating the ancient immortals and pushing Jade True closer to the Immortal Dao, its transformations also became even more authentic."

He took a drink of wine. "Furthermore, Xian Chan cultivates Cold Qi, and Ning Wan had just broken through. Since no one had seen her new cultivation, it was easy to pull off the deception."

"As for why you've sought me out this time..."

Li Ximing connected the dots. Hearing this, he figured Ning Wan must have had her own arrangements in sending him here. Since the Buddhist cultivators had always been at odds with his family, he was more than happy to help if it was within his power. He smiled.

"It's about the Great Konghai Temple, isn't it?"

Zhusheng laughed heartily, his tone casual. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing is a perceptive man. The problem with the Great Konghai Temple... is mainly their Abbot. He's a formidable sixth-generation Maha, a major threat. Now, with Baoqing's success, the Shitang has fallen into their hands..."

He picked up the sword from the table and set it beside him, his voice quiet. "I am not one who enjoys being coerced. I will always choose to strike first."

As soon as Zhusheng finished speaking, a frigid wind howled. A youth in white robes descended from the sky as if stepping on the snow. He had a round face and long, narrow eyes. He took a seat at the table, brimming with excitement.

"Now we're all here!"

This must be Daoist Master Xian Chan, the Demon beast whose true form was a Snow Ridge Listening Pine Fox. Li Ximing gave him a slight bow. Daoist Master Zhusheng's expression turned serious again.

"Maha are skilled at divination. Although my divine abilities are shielding us, we must act decisively and without delay, just in case. Since Daoist Friend Zhaojing is here, I will be blunt."

"Very few factions are pleased with the Great Konghai Temple's recent actions, from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition to the various houses of the Southern Sea. They are simply wary of the Temple's Abbot."

"Daoist Friend Miao of Thunder-Hearing Island has spoken with me, as has Songzhou's King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou. The arrow is nocked; we have simply been waiting for you, Daoist Friend, to be our 'eastern wind.'"

Li Ximing was here representing Ning Wan, so he was expected to contribute. However, he had no desire to get dragged in too deep, and even less to get injured. After a moment's thought, he asked softly, "And your arrangement is...?"

Daoist Master Zhusheng and the Demon beast beside him exchanged a glance. "The Merciful Ones are too numerous," Zhusheng said. "We probably can't reclaim all of Shitang this time; it will likely be carved up by the various factions. However, severely wounding Baoqing is imperative. He operates under the assumption that Daoist Friend Miao and the Azure Pond Sect are at odds and will never ally. He believes that King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou is immobilized, just like the Great Konghai Temple's Abbot. What he *doesn't* know is that the Southern Songzhou Luoshe faction now has a second Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. And he certainly never expected *you* to be the one to arrive!"

"We don't need you to join the main fight. We just need you to travel east of Lufang, stand guard over the sea, and intimidate a certain white elephant. As for the rest, whether we succeed or fail, you won't need to make a move. When the time comes, just crush the jade talisman we give you, and you are free to leave."

Li Ximing stroked his beard and nodded, realization dawning. 'This group of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators has planned this well... It seems Kui Qi arranged all of this long ago. A man as proud as him was bound to be resentful about the Shitang incident. He's been plotting this in secret. Asking me to come was a specific move—it was just more important that I be *away* from Moongaze Lake when it happened.'

With the Immortal Mirror in his possession, he had no fear of ambushes or other dangers on the road. He was already tempted. 'Even though I'm acting on Ning Wan's behalf, and there's no immediate, tangible reward... the chance to strike a blow against the Buddhist cultivators is satisfying in itself. What's more, the Southern Songzhou Luoshe faction has that Spiritual Artifact. Contacting them after this operation will be perfectly natural and above suspicion.'

He nodded and smiled. "I will certainly do my part. However, I also came on this trip... to meet with the King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou. I intend to try and trade for that Spiritual Artifact."

To his surprise, Zhusheng nodded and smiled. "Daoist Master Qiuhu already mentioned this. The King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou is awaiting your visit. After the battle, the rest of us will likely need to retreat and heal our wounds. You can proceed directly to the Southern Songzhou Luoshe lands as you please."

Hearing this, Li Ximing nodded in satisfaction. Their interests were aligned, so there was no need for further ceremony. He accepted the jade slip and talisman from Zhusheng and was about to depart on his light when the Daoist Master called out, "Daoist Friend, please wait!"

He took a small box from his sleeve. Taking a wisp of Li Ximing's divine ability, he formed a hand seal and cast a Dharma Art, sealing the wisp's spiritual signature into the box. "This is a minor marvel from an Upper Shaman Dao Spiritual Artifact," he explained. "It can conceal your cultivation. It's not as effective as it once was, but it's more than enough to fool that stupid demon, who only possesses a spell-art-based divine ability. As long as you don't actively manifest your own abilities, the concealment will last for three days."

Li Ximing nodded in understanding and departed on the wind, leaving the man and the demon alone on the mountain. Zhusheng shouldered his sword. "It seems Zhaojing has powerful backing. Changxiao won't dare make a move on him."

The Snow Ridge Listening Pine Fox shook his head. "Hard to say. The Li clan is getting closer and closer to the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Who's to say he hasn't already coordinated with Hengzhu? There could be a whole group of Daoist Masters lying in ambush in the Great Void, just waiting for Changxiao to show up!"

"That makes sense." The sword cultivator summoned a cloud and rose into the air. "That demon beast probably won't dare to fight. And even if he does, Zhaojing's 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' is more than enough to tie him down. It's time. Signal the other houses to make their move!"

***

The Great Void.

Li Ximing left Shahuan and flew through the Great Void until he was over North Dan. He saw a brilliant, multicolored light protecting the island below. It was a traditional defense of the Buddhist cultivators—a sky full of dazzling, five-colored splendor. He had no idea how powerful it truly was.

The Great Konghai Temple's main headquarters surely had a grand formation, but given the Buddhist cultivators' general skill in the Dao of formations, it was highly unlikely they could have erected one on North Dan Island so quickly. This light had to be a projection from the Buddhist Land itself.

He frowned to himself. 'Impressive, in its own way. The Buddhist cultivators are skilled at using their Merciful Ones to form a conduit. Drawing down this power is an effective means of protection, and far less trouble than constructing a full Purple Mansion Realm grand formation. The only drawback is that when the casters disperse, the formation breaks...'

But that was not his problem. He took a detour, flying all the way to Lufang. Following the directions in the jade slip, he stopped at the edge of the Si Sea. Peering through the Great Void, he spotted a small island below. Demon beasts flew to and fro, and he could occasionally see a few monks moving about.

The island was protected by only a single Foundation Establishment Realm-level formation. He couldn't see the target demon elephant, nor was there any sign of a Purple Mansion Realm formation's aura in the Great Void. Clearly, this Demon beast was dirt poor.

He used his Immortal Mirror to scan his surroundings. Only after confirming there was no ambush in the Great Void did he relax. With a final glance below, he drifted down, emerging from the Great Void to manifest above the island. His appearance instantly caused a commotion. Li Ximing didn't stand on ceremony. With a single thought, he activated the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. The sky immediately filled with a vast, yellow-brown aura. Colorful clouds of spiritual energy appeared, only to be instantly dispersed by the surging, baleful qi.

The demon beasts below were terrified. The sea began to churn, and a thunderous roar echoed across the water. The surface exploded in a spray of white foam as a burly man in white armor strode out, walking upon the waves. His expression was wary. He started upon seeing Li Ximing, then frowned and shouted, "Which Daoist friend honors me with their presence?"

Li Ximing held the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, its white pearl glowing with a brilliant light. His gaze swept over the armored man, and he laughed. "Just an overseas rogue cultivator. I happened to be passing by and thought I would pay a visit to a fellow Daoist."

"A rogue cultivator?" The Demon beast was immediately suspicious. He looked Li Ximing up and down, but just as Zhusheng had predicted, he couldn't see through his cultivation. Still, Li Ximing had the bearing of a Daoist Master, so the beast maintained a civil facade. He waved his sleeve. "Then please, come ashore!"

This Demon King truly was dirt poor. Despite being at the Purple Mansion Realm, the sight of Li Ximing casually holding a Spiritual Artifact made his own presence diminish slightly. He led him onto the island and asked tentatively, "Daoist Friend... do you cultivate Earth Virtue?"

Li Ximing hadn't revealed his own divine abilities, only the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, so his aura naturally resembled that of Earth Virtue. While covertly using the jade talisman to signal the group to the west, he replied with an air of indifference, "You live in the Eastern Sea, Daoist Friend. I imagine Earth Virtue cultivators are not a common sight here."

The white elephant frowned, deep in thought. He led Li Ximing to the peak, quickly cleared some Buddhist scriptures off a table, poured him tea, and began in a low voice, "I wonder..."

Li Ximing cut him off. He shot the demon a glance, his posture radiating superiority, and launched a preemptive strike. "And just who, Daoist Friend, do you serve under?"

The white elephant was a Purple Mansion Realm Demon King, however; he wasn't so easily bluffed. His face darkened, and his eyes narrowed. "This Demon King cultivates in the sea. I am a good friend of the Abbot of the Great Konghai Temple. My name is Tuodu. And just who... are you?"

Since Earth Virtue had been mentioned, Li Ximing threw out a name casually. "Have you, by chance, heard of the Xu Xiang Daoist tradition?"

Demon King Tuodu stared at him intently, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Senior Sumian?"

Li Ximing hadn't expected to be connected to the Xuanmiao Temple so quickly. His family had no feud with them; if a fight broke out and his cover was blown, he would have offended Sumian for no reason. He laughed and shook his head. "Not at all."

Internally, however, he was puzzled. 'Sumian is famous and has many friends, unlike a new Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master like me. Even if this demon beast has never met him, he shouldn't be mistaking me for him...'

Hearing his denial, the white elephant's eyes flashed with renewed suspicion. But at that exact moment, a speck of colorful light flared in the distant sky. Demon King Tuodu startled and tensed, about to rise. Yet the man before him reacted even faster. He was already on his feet, hands clasped behind his back, staring at the demon with a cold gaze.

"Daoist Friend, I'd stay put if I were you."

At that instant, Demon King Tuodu finally understood. Li Ximing, however, gave no ground, his voice turning to ice. "I have no wish to harm you. If you remain here, you and I will have no quarrel. But if you insist on intervening, Demon King, you are more than welcome to try!"

The light from the west flared brightly. The Demon King's face twisted with shock and rage. He hesitated for only a second, then his mouth ripped wide, stretching to his ears. Two massive tusks shot out as his body swelled exponentially. "You dare to harm my friend, Daoist Baoqing!" he roared. "How dare you!"

His voice was a clap of thunder rolling through the clouds, causing every monk and demon beast on the island to look up, their faces filled with terror and righteous fury.

*BOOM!*

The sea surged as a colossal, white-skinned treasure elephant, as massive as a mountain, launched into the sky. Its forehead was draped with a golden blanket, and its two tusks gleamed like twin peaks of white jade. Its enormous mouth was blood-red, and it let out a deafening, earth-shaking roar.

A furious gale erupted, yet Li Ximing remained standing calmly by the table, the tea in his cup undisturbed. He shook his head and sighed, "How unwise, Daoist Friend."

Even as he spoke, a pair of elephant feet, so large they blotted out the sky, descended. A massive shadow instantly enveloped the entire peak as the two feet stomped straight down.

Faced with the mountain-sized limbs, Li Ximing's expression was odd. He didn't activate a divine ability, nor did he deploy the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen. Instead, he simply took a single, light step forward.

In that instant, he vanished into the Great Void.

The elephant's feet, however, did not stop, smashing heavily into the mountain peak. A violent cloud of dust and a terrifying explosion instantly engulfed the entire island. Demon beasts and monks rained from the sky, severed limbs scattering in all directions.

Li Ximing stood silently in the Great Void, utterly baffled. He didn't know what to say.

'I haven't even made a move... and he's already destroyed his own base.'

Tuodu, however, seemed unsatisfied. He stomped furiously several more times, his rage still burning as he roared to the heavens, "Where do you think you can run!"

After completely leveling his own island, the Demon King reverted to his human form, hefted a massive stone pillar, and stepped into the Great Void, leaving behind a land of wailing and ruin.

'Not good!' Li Ximing's heart lurched. 'He's going west to provide reinforcements!'

Li Ximing held back no longer. His Bright Yang divine ability flared as he moved to intercept. But the demon beast paid him no mind, instead diving straight down into the depths of the sea.

How could Li Ximing fail to understand? The light in his hands dimmed, his expression turning peculiar.

'This demon beast... he really doesn't want to fight, does he?'

But anyone who reached the Purple Mansion Realm was likely cunning. Li Ximing didn't dare let his guard down. He followed close behind, launching beams of Profound Light from his brow, forcing the demon beast to keep dodging, pushing him to fly faster and faster.

After about the time it takes an incense stick to burn, they had reached the deep-sea region of the Great Void, the territory of the Dragon-kin. Li Ximing grew wary. The demon beast, however, simply stopped, turned around, and called out, "This Daoist friend!"

Li Ximing wasn't here for a fight to the death. He smiled warmly. "Daoist Friend Tuodu, you have truly broadened my horizons today."

Demon King Tuodu waved his hands frantically. The murderous aura from before had vanished, replaced by the simple, earnest look of an elephant. He sighed. "Many thanks for your understanding, Daoist Friend..."

With a wave of his hand, he led Li Ximing out of the Great Void and back into the physical world. He materialized a table and chairs on a sea reef, looking utterly refreshed and cheerful. "So, it's Bright Yang you cultivate! You must be Daoist Friend Zhaojing, then? That's a fine Spiritual Artifact you have there; I couldn't see through your concealment at all!"

"My apologies, my apologies!"

Li Ximing opened his mouth, then closed it. Tuodu just waved his hand dismissively. "Baoqing had it coming. Let him suffer his bad luck. Even the Temple Abbot is ignoring this, so let him reap what he sows! By successfully tying up a Purple Mansion Realm-level opponent, I've already done more than enough for the Great Konghai Temple!"

He seemed like a completely different person from moments before, wearing a mask of simple honesty. Li Ximing remained noncommittal; he didn't believe a word of it. Since when was any Demon King of the sea a good person? He was clearly just posturing because he wanted to avoid a mutually destructive fight.

After all, the demon clearly misunderstood, thinking Li Ximing possessed at least two Spiritual Artifacts. He was also likely worried that the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was standing behind him. Otherwise, why would a local tyrant of a Demon King, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, be acting so subservient?

While the demon king sighed and lamented his situation, Li Ximing, happy for the quiet, sat down and remarked casually, "It seems you have no real intention of helping Baoqing. The Great Konghai Temple only has two Mahas, yet it seems to be rife with internal schemes."

"Hahaha!" Demon King Tuodu beamed, appearing completely amiable. "The Great Konghai Temple's Buddhist Land is nothing like that of the Northern Buddhists! The internal politics are a tangled mess. Neither you nor I are the main players in this battle. We're just here to put on a show. Why should we get in the way of one another's cultivation?"

Li Ximing watched him silently, saying nothing. Under the passive scan of his Immortal Mirror, a dark and heavy aura was circling the base of the reef. Clearly, another Purple Mansion Realm-level helper was hiding in the water below.

'This Tuodu is truly cunning,' Li Ximing thought. 'That "enraged" stomp earlier was just an excuse to kill those monks on his own island under the cover of a battle. He puts on the air of an irritable treasure elephant, but that viciousness... it's far from ordinary.'
