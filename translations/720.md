# Chapter 720: The Story of the Secret Diffusion Sects

The waters of Baijiang Creek were exceptionally clear, its bed a dense carpet of green stones. The underwater palace was grand, filled with shrimp and fish that had taken human form. Some played celestial music while others carried spirit delicacies, weaving through the halls in a lively spectacle.

Ying Hebai might be a nobody in the eyes of someone like Dingjiao, but the Azure-Necked Flood Dragon was a local hegemon in his own right. His palace lacked nothing in luxury and elegance. It was adorned with luminous pearls and featured stairs of gold—a dazzling and extravagant display.

‘He is, after all, a demon just a step below the Purple Mansion realm,’ Li Chenghui thought, assessing the situation. ‘He has borrowed the prestige of the dragons to become master of three rivers. Of course his domain would be impressive.’

Li Chenghui knew that Ying Hebai might seem deferential, but without Li Zhouwei’s reputation backing him, he himself might not have even been granted entry. He shed any pretense of arrogance, rode the giant turtle to the riverbed, and followed Shui Zhao, who had resumed his human form before the palace.

“This way, please!” Shui Zhao said with a bow.

Li Chenghui stepped forward. A tall man was waiting inside the main hall, dressed in a brocade jacket of slate-blue silk beneath a white velvet cloak embroidered with a scene of an azure sea. Scales were visible on his neck, and his eyes were sharp and piercing. He was a handsome figure. Seeing Li Chenghui, he smiled. “So it is fellow Daoist Chenghui. But why do I not see the lord?”

“Our family head is currently occupied.”

With that simple reply, Ying Hebai understood everything. He didn't need to be overly deferential to Li Chenghui. Taking a half-step back to reveal his turquoise and white boots, he announced, “Please.”

As Li Chenghui took his seat, Ying Hebai immediately cupped his hands. “First, allow me to congratulate you, fellow Daoist, on conquering the Baijiang Creek territory. This is a land of abundant spiritual energy, and it falls within my jurisdiction. The waterways are clear and well-connected, ensuring a good harvest every year. If you ever need to divert a remote water channel, you have only to ask!”

“You are too kind, Great King.” Li Chenghui, of course, had no concerns about the waterways. He began, “The Baijiang Creek region has no high mountains, and there are no noteworthy demons on the land. However, the extensive network of waterways makes it very convenient for water spirits to come ashore and prey on humans…”

“I understand.”

Li Chenghui, mindful that Ying Hebai was a demon, had spoken plainly. The Northern Brocade River King nodded at once and agreed readily. “I will restrain all the water spirits of the three rivers from preying on humans. I will send messengers to warn the demon generals in the outlying waters. If any demon dares to come ashore and harm people, simply send word, and I will investigate thoroughly.”

It had to be said, having a powerful backer made all the difference. A grave matter that the Secret Diffusion Three Sects had been powerless against—even having to offer up blood sacrifices to the flower python year after year—Li Chenghui had resolved with a single sentence.

With such a thorny issue settled so easily, Li Chenghui was in high spirits. Seizing the opportunity, he asked, “Great King, do you know of any special places or secret histories in the lands of Baijiang and Baiye? For the Secret Diffusion Three Sects to choose this location to establish themselves… it seems rather unusual, does it not?”

The very founding of the Secret Diffusion sects felt strange, so Li Chenghui naturally took the chance to inquire. Hearing this, Ying Hebai’s expression turned serious. “The lands of Baijiang hold their own mysteries. Allow me to explain it to you, fellow Daoist.”

“First, you should know that my aunt is a favored concubine of the Xu Water Demon King, and my elder brother also serves under him. It was through this connection, and by making myself known to Lord Ranwu of the Dragon Prince’s court, that I was granted this post overseeing the three rivers.”

After laying out his own background, he continued, “When the three caves established their sects here, I grew suspicious. I made a special trip to the Xu Water and asked the Demon King about it. Only then did I learn that the root of the matter lies with the Xiaoshi Mountain Dao Lineage.”

“The Xiaoshi Mountain Dao Lineage?” The name sounded familiar to Li Chenghui. He vaguely recalled his family having captured someone from that lineage before.

“Precisely,” the River King affirmed. “Near Chengshui Marsh, there is a mountain called Xiaoshi. On that mountain was a declining Daoist lineage that ran the Secret Diffusion Temple. During the height of the Xu Kingdom, the Secret Diffusion Temple was a celestial temple with its own Purple Mansion cultivator. It was one of the most prominent temples to emerge from the ruins of the Wanling Sect’s domain.”

Only now was Li Chenghui beginning to understand the origins of the Secret Diffusion Three Sects. He watched as Ying Hebai’s expression grew solemn.

“It was said this celestial temple had powerful connections. Later, its Purple Mansion expert perished, and the succeeding generations were inept. Yet no sect or clan ever dared to make a move on them. Instead, they were instigated by various powers until they fractured and turned on one another, each clinging to a piece of that mountain to survive.”

“This continued until the war between the north and south. The monks swept down from the north and finally disturbed this place. How could the various caves of Secret Diffusion resist? They were shattered and scattered, fleeing for their lives across the land.”

He stroked his beard. “I overheard my lord chatting once. He said the Secret Diffusion Temple has a treasure, an ancient spirit artifact… it lies hidden in the Great Void. If a descendant of the Secret Diffusion Temple can gain its recognition, it will descend from the Great Void… Several Purple Mansion cultivators covet it.”

With that, Li Chenghui finally understood the fundamental reason for the Secret Diffusion Three Sects’ existence. They were essentially seeds planted by the surrounding Purple Mansion powers, who would select talented individuals from among them to cultivate, all for the sake of that spirit artifact.

The schemes of Purple Mansion cultivators were often hard to fathom. While the demon king’s words couldn’t be trusted completely, the origin of the Secret Diffusion Temple was almost certainly true. Li Chenghui committed this to memory. “I see…”

But then a thought struck him, and he realized his family had grievously offended Yehui. ‘I wonder which Daoist Masters are involved…’ he pondered. ‘But then there’s the Brahma Cloud Cave, which means the master of the Chengyun Gate has a hand in this as well. This matter is of great importance. I must report it to the Daoist Master!’

Li Chenghui no longer had the heart for idle chat. After asking a few more details, he cut straight to the point. “The people of Dense Cloud Cave have retreated, but who knows when they will return. Great King, you guard the three rivers. If you hear any news, I ask that you inform me… My family will reward you generously!”

Anyone would know that Dense Cloud Cave was just another name for the White Ye Immortal Sect. But since the sect was a legitimate Purple Mansion power, mentioning it directly would put the other party in a difficult position. By substituting its name, he made things easier. Ying Hebai smiled. “But of course! They are merely a few Foundation Establishment remnants. I will have my people watch them. If there is any news, I will immediately dispatch Shui Zhao to inform you.”

Ying Hebai was no fool; how could he not understand Li Chenghui’s meaning? He was under strict orders from his own superiors not to interfere in human affairs, especially those involving Purple Mansion clans. He couldn’t openly take a side. But rules were rules, and some things were best left unsaid between them. By referring to them as Dense Cloud Cave, Li Chenghui had made it even more convenient. The flood dragon agreed enthusiastically and personally saw him out.

“I will have Shui Zhao visit a few times in the coming months to maintain contact. That way, it will be easier to notify you, fellow Daoist. It would be troublesome if something happened and we were unable to communicate in time.”

Li Chenghui knew this was likely a prelude to gift-giving. He would decide whether to accept based on the value of the gifts when they arrived. He summoned a bolt of lightning, shot out of Baijiang Creek, and hurried to write a letter to his family.

Ying Hebai returned to his hall, the smile vanishing from his face. He frowned. “Shui Zhao… during the war between the north and south, wasn’t there a thunder pearl that fell to the bottom of the river? A pity, it’s probably too valuable, he most likely wouldn’t accept it… Go check the treasury for any other thunder-attribute treasures.”

Shui Zhao acknowledged the order and departed. A sense of calm settled over Ying Hebai. “This one is easy to get along with. The phenomena of falling water and rising thunder in the Eastern Sea might be ending soon. I should take the opportunity to prepare a few more thunder-related gifts…”

**Gardenia Scenery Mountain.**

Li Zhouwei returned to the clan on a ray of Profound Light. He dismissed his retinue, tossed the flower python to the White Ape for safekeeping, and without a moment’s pause, grabbed Wenhu and rushed to see Li Ximing.

When he reached the foot of the mountain, a messenger informed him that Li Ximing was on the summit. He breathed a sigh of relief, dragged his captive up the mountain, and threw Wenhu onto the Radiant Sky Stone.

“This villain offended the Daoist Master with deceitful words!” he announced respectfully. “We have now broken through Hongfu Mountain and captured him!”

Li Ximing had been waiting for him on the mountain. He rose with a cheerful laugh. Although this had all been planned in advance, and he had already intercepted the other Purple Mansion experts in the Great Void, the extent of their gains still depended on Li Zhouwei’s strength.

“Excellent, excellent,” he said with a smile. “Have him taken away for now. You and I will talk. We can interrogate him later.”

Li Ximing had little desire to control the family’s every move and was thus extremely pleased with Li Zhouwei. A Purple Mansion’s divine abilities were formidable, but a top-tier Foundation Establishment cultivator was just as invaluable. Otherwise, why would Ning Tiaoxiao have gone to such lengths to promote Li Xuanfeng? If the Li family didn’t have Li Zhouwei now, how could they have advanced into the Midong territory? With only Li Chenghui and Li Minggong’s strength, they would have been lucky to hold the Funan territory on the opposite shore.

He helped his white qilin to its feet and recounted everything regarding Daoist Master Changxi. Li Zhouwei listened and considered it carefully.

“I suspect Yehui has other motives,” Li Ximing said. “Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been the first to jump out and oppose our family. That’s the first thing. The second is… while Changxi is still alive and can offer some protection, I want to make a trip to the Cui family and inquire about Daoist lineages.”

“The affairs of Purple Mansion cultivators are not so difficult to unravel,” Li Zhouwei replied. “Especially since neither the Chengyun Gate nor the Capital immortals Dao behind the Secret Diffusion sects possess a Life Divine Ability. As long as our information is good, we can guess at their motives. Changxi might not be ignorant of this; it’s more likely a matter of interests. If we don’t ask, he won’t tell. At worst, we can try to befriend that cultivator Sumian.”

His assessment was nearly identical to Li Ximing’s own. “Changxi is a clan cultivator who attained the Dao in the Eastern Sea,” Li Ximing responded. “He was never a particularly good person. Even at death’s door, he’s still scheming. If I were in his shoes, I might not fully trust our family either. After all, from his perspective, if the Profound Peak Gate falls, our family stands to gain the most.”

Li Ximing had a point. If the Profound Peak Gate were to collapse, its talents, resources, and Daoist lineages would inevitably flow to Moongaze Lake.

“As for the Cui family…” Li Zhouwei continued, “they are backed by Dongfang You’s faction, who are also supporters of Dingjiao. If you’re just asking for information, they shouldn’t refuse you, Daoist Master. I am certain the trip will be fruitful.”

“Good!” This was precisely what Li Ximing wanted to confirm. Hearing the connection to Dingjiao, he was ninety percent certain of his success. They chatted a bit more about the Baijiang territory, and when he heard the name “Baijiang Command,” he couldn’t help but laugh. “How domineering. It certainly has the autocratic flavor of the Bright Yang Dao.”

Li Zhouwei smiled without embarrassment. After another moment of lighthearted banter, Li Ximing’s expression grew worried. “Do you still have connections among the dragon clans? Don’t forget to inquire about our elder…”

Li Zhouwei knew he was referring to Li Qinghong. He sighed inwardly. It was a sensitive matter, not something one could ask about easily. He simply nodded in silent agreement.

Li Ximing seemed to sense his thoughts. A colorful light, the sign of a Bright Yang divine ability, pulsed from his sleeve as he tore open a path to the Great Void, leaving a final message. “I am leaving the Profound Pattern Vase to nurture in the Purple Flame Earth-Baleful Spring on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. If you have need of it, you may take it.”

The Profound Pattern Vase could absorb the power of fire channels, refining the Profound Light within it with the energies of Li Fire and Bright Yang to increase its power. Li Ximing had left it on the mountain ever since his breakthrough.

With that final reminder, he stepped into the Great Void. He traveled for some time, his heart filled with joyful anticipation for his trip to the Cui family. After a short while, the Purple Mansion grand array of the Profound Peak Gate materialized before him. A stream of black and yellow energy sank to its base, while an aura of deep blue light floated above. It looked even more formidable than the array at Mount Xianyou.

‘Every art has its specialty,’ he mused. ‘The Bound Earth dao excels at defense. A sect’s grand array would naturally be more robust.’

As he approached, an entrance naturally appeared in the array, and Changxi’s voice echoed out. “Daoist Friend Zhaojing, please enter.”

He passed through the array, and the world before him opened up. In the distance, he could see the brilliant white expanse of Lake Xian, with a few wisps of cloud drifting past. Li Ximing turned back to see the cave’s interior, its floor covered in rolling green stones.

Seated upon the central dharma seat was a stone man with a distinct nose and face. Its beard and eyebrows were like jade, standing out stiffly from its cheeks. Its eyes were textured stone, a solid, unnerving black that stared blankly ahead. It was a rather frightening sight.

Li Ximing paused. A muffled rumbling came from within the stone man’s belly. “Zhaojing, wait a moment.”

The stone man rose with great difficulty, scooped up a handful of sand from the floor, and pressed it onto its face, sculpting a new visage and neck. It covered the rest of its body with robes and sat down at a table, forcing a smile. But its eyes remained black stone, cold and devoid of emotion.

“A disgraceful sight…” Changxi laughed. The two stone orbs slowly grew flesh, returning to their usual kind and amiable appearance.

Li Ximing let out a breath. “Senior, how is your health?”

“Less than three years.” Changxi shook his head, his condition truly dire. “You must have come for a reason, Zhaojing,” he said wearily. “Please, speak.”

Li Ximing felt as though Changxi might drop dead at any second. Not daring to delay, he quickly asked, “There will be a great war in a few years. This junior wishes to refine a spirit embryo… It’s not a matter for just the next few years; refining it sooner would grant me a bit more strength.”

“Ah!” Changxi feigned a look of sudden understanding.

‘He’s asking me for the technique to refine a spirit embryo!’

At this point, what excuse could Changxi possibly have? To put it bluntly, if he were to die tomorrow, what secret technique of the Profound Peak Gate couldn't Li Ximing take if he so wished? What spirit resource would the Li family not dare to touch?

Besides, Changxi had never put much faith in sentiment. The Kong family had once been the region’s hegemon, yet when their clan was scattered, no one offered aid to their descendants out of some past friendship. The Li family was willing to help; it was only right that Li Ximing receive a share of the Profound Peak Gate’s legacy.

The old man coughed, suppressing his thoughts and forcing a smile onto his aged face. “It is my fault. I told you about it before and should have given it to you to study then. To make you come all this way to ask… my apologies.”

He took a jade slip from his sleeve. “This is called _Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire_,” he said with a cough. “I obtained it in my early years from the Eastern Sea. It is a clean technique. It is the same one I use for my own refinement. You can rest assured, Zhaojing.”

“Many thanks, Senior!”

Li Ximing accepted the slip. His spiritual sense swept over it. The jade was of exceptionally high quality, seemingly reinforced with an Earth Virtue divine ability, making it as heavy and sturdy as a Foundation Establishment artifact. The small slip contained millions of words and numerous diagrams, clearly the product of a complete and orthodox Daoist lineage.
