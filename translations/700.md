# Chapter 700: The White Ye Immortal Sect

"There is no need for such formality."

Something in Gao Xuanzi’s tone felt strangely familiar to Li Ximing. He could tell the man’s congratulations were sincere, far more so than the representatives from the other sects. He supposed that since Tu Longjian considered himself a junior to Li Yuanjiao, the Slaughter Jun Gate was genuinely pleased to see him reach the Purple Mansion Realm.

Gao Xuanzi picked up a jade box from the table. Li Minggong quickly stepped forward to receive it as Gao Xuanzi spoke respectfully.

"My master has prepared a copy of the *Art of Wondrous Transformations* to congratulate you."

The technique didn't sound particularly profound, but the gesture was what mattered. The gift itself wasn't as important as the sentiment behind it. "Please extend my gratitude to Senior Junjian," Li Ximing replied. "I have not forgotten his kindness in the matter of the Radiant Sky Stone. Without his aid back then, I would not be where I am today."

Gao Xuanzi returned the salute and promptly withdrew, unwilling to say more in front of so many onlookers.

Li Ximing took a step, and another man approached, carrying a cup. His eyes were bright, and a spear was strapped to his back. He had a handsome, refined face and was dressed in practical attire. "Zhong Qian, on behalf of the Chengyun Gate, congratulates the Daoist Master!" he said with a smile. "We present a set of White Shadow Gold Buckles!"

Li Ximing recognized him at once. This was the same Zhong Qian that Li Xuanfeng had befriended years ago, and he was no simple character. "So, it is Sect Master Zhong," he said, giving a slight wave of his hand.

"You flatter me!" Zhong Qian, older now, had a more grounded and steady presence. He bowed. "I was in seclusion for the past few years, and my subordinates were left unsupervised. Fortunately, they knew their limits and did nothing too reckless. I have come today to offer my apologies."

The Brahma Cloud Cave might have had ill intentions, but they had never crossed the line. Since Zhong Qian was the sect master, a familiar face, and had come to apologize in person, Li Ximing saw no reason to press the matter. He simply had Li Minggong accept the gift.

"My late grand-uncle once mentioned you," Li Ximing said. "He praised your exceptional talent and believed you had the potential to reach the Purple Mansion Realm one day."

Zhong Qian murmured his thanks. At another table, An Siwei’s voice reached Li Zhouwei’s ears.

"Clan Head, Gao Xuanzi is taking his leave."

Like the others whose Daoist Masters had not attended, Gao Xuanzi was departing early. His actions, and by extension, the Slaughter Jun Gate’s, were not impolite. The sect was situated at the border of the Wu, Yue, and Southern Borderlands territories and wasn't truly considered a Yue State sect. They didn't even have to attend; their presence was purely a nod to Tu Longjian’s personal relationship with the Li clan.

The sects of the Wu State all answered to Mount Changhuai, whose authority far surpassed that of the Golden Feather Sect in Yue. Consequently, Wu State sects rarely associated with those from Yue. The Slaughter Jun Gate maintained a cool neutrality, never aligning with any power.

Thus, Gao Xuanzi’s attendance was a significant show of respect. Li Zhouwei made a point of rising from his seat and personally escorting him out of the courtyard. As they walked, Gao Xuanzi adjusted his robes and asked a few questions with a smile.

Li Zhouwei studied him discreetly. Once they had passed through the dense woods and reached the Changxi Gate, the warm, festive air of the banquet faded, replaced by a cool breeze. The young man spoke up.

"Thank you for seeing me out, Clan Head. My master wishes to avoid complications, so please, go no further. The Changxi Gate is far enough."

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei understood.

'Daoist Master Junjian doesn't want to get entangled in our clan's affairs. Or perhaps… he doesn't want his own troubles to spill over onto us.'

He gave Gao Xuanzi a deep look and nodded. "If the Daoist Master is unavailable and the Slaughter Jun Gate finds itself in difficulty, please send word to us in the Yue State. Our clan will spare no effort to assist."

Gao Xuanzi just smiled and shook his head. "I too am a sword cultivator. If your clan has any exceptional young sword cultivators, you are welcome to send them to the Slaughter Jun Gate to meet with me. While I would not call myself a Sword Immortal, I have achieved some small mastery of the Dao…"

Li Zhouwei was slightly surprised. The Li clan was known as a family of Sword Immortals. For Gao Xuanzi to make such an offer showed immense confidence in his own swordsmanship.

"Many thanks, Senior!"

Li Zhouwei expressed his gratitude, and Gao Xuanzi returned the bow. His eyes drifted over the Changxi Gate, noting the foundation stones carved from Radiant Sky Stone—simple, grand, and solid, etched with patterns of lakes and seas. The beams above were painted with scenes of snow-covered pines, rosy mists, and rainbows, while the seventy-two ridges of the roof had been dyed with the light of a Bright Yang divine ability, giving them a spectacular radiance.

"This Changxi Gate is quite impressive," he remarked with a smile.

With that, he summoned a gust of frost and snow and soared into the sky, heading southwest. Li Zhouwei watched him go, lost in thought. After a long moment, he flew back toward the banquet. By now, most of the major clans were preparing to leave.

Only the unaffiliated cultivators remained, unwilling to part with such a rare abundance of spiritual sustenance and energy. They sat silently in the courtyard, some drinking, others eating fruit, determined to fill their stomachs before they left.

A few had even begun to absorb the dense spiritual energy on the spot. Several older unaffiliated cultivators, not daring to be too obvious, secretly formed hand seals under the table, their eyes open and conversations flowing as if nothing was amiss, though who knew how effective their efforts were.

Life was hard for unaffiliated cultivators, and even harder for those who abstained from eating meat. The Li clan would not be stingy at such a grand event. Li Zhouwei called Li Minggong over and gave him a quiet order.

"For those at the lower tables who are reluctant to leave, have a pot of spirit tea sent to each of them. Don't let them sit there awkwardly."

Li Minggong acknowledged the order and left. Soon, attendants glided through the tables, carrying jade trays with steaming pots of spirit tea, and a chorus of thanks rose from the lower courtyard.

Li Zhouwei, his observation heightened by his ocular arts, watched from a distance. He saw the older cultivators hastily pour out the tea, wrap the leaves in paper to save for later, and then rise to ask for their empty pots to be refilled with spirit water.

"Clan Head Li!"

As he watched, a clear voice called out. A long-bearded man led a group forward. Judging by their attire, they were from the Xiao clan.

Li Zhouwei found his face somewhat familiar. The middle-aged man was already smiling. "I am Xiao Muyun. Does the Clan Head recognize me?"

Recognition dawned on Li Zhouwei. This was Li Qingxiao’s son, the head of the Yushan branch of the Xiao clan. He was technically an elder, but as he was a Xiao and Li Zhouwei was the Li Clan Head, they wouldn't address each other by familial seniority. Li Zhouwei rose and bowed.

"So, it is the master of Yushan. Have the elders come as well?"

"My mother is with Grand-uncle Xuanxuan," Xiao Muyun said warmly. "She was absolutely delighted! When she heard Daoist Master Zhaojing had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, she was so thrilled she packed her bags at dawn and rushed back to her maiden home."

Before Li Zhouwei could ask more, Xiao Muyun continued, "To let the Clan Head know, I now have the humble honor of managing the thirteen external branches of the Xiao clan, overseeing all the vassal families of Mount Xianyou. The Xiao clan has also prepared a small gift."

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei had an inkling of what was coming and asked politely.

Xiao Muyun produced a sheepskin scroll from his sleeve. "The territory from the eastern shore of Moongaze Lake to the border of Lixia Prefecture… a total of one hundred and twenty-seven clans and sects. As of now, the seventy-nine families in the lands twenty miles west of Crowncloud Peak are all gifted to your esteemed clan!"

Xiao Muyun's explanation was lengthy, but everyone present understood its meaning. Before Li Zhouwei could speak, Li Minggong let out a soft breath, her voice thick with emotion.

"We finally have it all!"

Although the Li clan had controlled Moongaze Lake for over a decade, their hold had never been complete, particularly over the southern and eastern shores.

The southern shore was dense with forests, especially in the Eastern Yue territory near Mount Dali, which couldn't be cultivated. However, the Li clan's relationship with the Demon Caves made this land a source of abundant spiritual materials, so it was valuable even without spirit fields.

The eastern shore had been home to over ninety families during the Jiang clan's era. When the Jiang clan fell, the Xiao clan had absorbed many of them as vassals. By the time the Yu clan took over, only thirty-nine families remained in Milin Prefecture, with the rest further east, almost in Lixia Prefecture.

Neither the Yu clan nor the Li clan had been able to reclaim those seventy-nine families. The Xiao clan had even forbidden the establishment of a market at Moongaze Lake, costing the region over eighty percent of its commercial income.

Now, with the return of these seventy-nine families, the Li clan's territory around Moongaze Lake was finally whole, totaling one hundred and eighteen families—even more than the Jiang clan's original ninety. It wasn't just about reclaiming thirteen spirit mines; it meant the Li clan's influence now extended further, giving them the power to intervene in the untamed lands along the river.

'The Xiao clan is giving too much. There must be a catch.'

Li Zhouwei stared at the unfurled scroll, his mind racing. 'This is to pave the way for the Profound Peak matter.'

The Li clan and the Profound Peak Gate were separated by the wild, untamed mountains dotted with small temples that lay along the riverbank. Most of these were likely vassals of the Kong family. The Xiao clan had acted as a buffer, but by taking this step back, they were placing the Li clan directly behind the Profound Peak Gate.

Li Zhouwei glanced toward the head table, but Li Ximing was already gone. The golden-eyed young man took a sip of tea. After over a decade of putting out fires for the clan, he grasped the implications of the map in an instant.

'It seems Uncle has already agreed to help the Profound Peak Gate. The Xiao clan wants no part of it, which means our clan must give it our all.'

He rolled up the scroll and smiled. "Such a generous gift… our clan is truly humbled to accept!"

Xiao Muyun beamed, and after a few more pleasantries, he withdrew. Music still filled the air, but Li Zhouwei’s mind was elsewhere. He left his seat, beckoned Li Jiangqian over, and sent a private message via a secret art.

"Go and investigate if there have been any recent territorial concessions or agreements between the Xiao clan and the Profound Peak Gate."

The look in Li Jiangqian’s eyes was identical to his father’s. The young man instantly understood the gravity of the decision. As the music played on, his brow furrowed.

'The Daoist Master has decided to take on the Profound Peak Gate's mess… It seems Daoist Master Changxi must have had a backup plan and offered a hefty price. It was an offer we couldn't refuse.'

He responded with a respectful nod and left the banquet as if nothing had happened. Once the decision was made to intervene, he stopped thinking about what a disaster the situation was and began to strategize.

'Kong Yu has a loose tongue and a weak will. He'll be easy to manipulate. I'll start with him.'

…

The night was serene. The scent of gardenias drifted from Gardenia Scenery Mountain on the evening breeze. Sparks of fire occasionally floated down from the fire vein at the mountain's base, which pulsed steadily, breathing out puffs of purple smoke.

A flash of light appeared on the summit, and Li Ximing materialized, his expression somewhat grim.

By now, all the guests who were going to come had come, and all the gifts had been presented. The Purple Mansion celebration could be considered over. The unaffiliated cultivators still lingering in the courtyard would likely stay until dawn.

Li Ximing sat down at the stone table and silently sipped his tea. After a moment, An Siwei landed on the mountain, looking uneasy. He bowed low.

"Daoist Master… someone from the White Ye Immortal Sect is here…"

"Let him come up."

The emissary from the White Ye Immortal Sect had been waiting on Gardenia Scenery Mountain the whole time, never daring to enter the banquet. That was why Li Ximing hadn't seen him. Not wanting to make an enemy so soon after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, he kept the anger from his voice.

An Siwei hurried away. Soon, a cultivator in red robes approached with his head bowed, his legs trembling. He collapsed to his knees with a thud and began kowtowing, his voice frantic and desperate.

"From the White Ye Immortal Sect… this humble servant, Duche… greets the Daoist Master."

Li Ximing's expression turned cold. He instantly understood why the emissary hadn't dared to enter the banquet or even show his face—and why he was now acting like a terrified worm. Three months ago, Daoist Wenhu had come to apologize and had promised that Daoist Chidu of the White Ye Immortal Sect would personally come to make amends!

After all, the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion from Xiaoshi Mountain had openly declared themselves enemies of the Li clan!

Even Zhong Qian, whose Brahma Cloud Cave had done nothing egregious, had come in person as the sect master. Which of the other sects, aside from the Profound Peak Gate who was seeking aid, had sent their leader?

Seeing no sign of Chidu, Li Ximing asked coldly, "Where is Chidu?"

Duche hesitated for a second, his terror palpable. "When Lord Chidu heard that the Daoist Master had achieved a divine ability, he was overcome with fear and rushed here from the Eastern Sea. But… but he was ambushed by demonic cultivators on the way and was nearly killed. He is too gravely injured to travel and is recuperating on a sea island… so… so he sent me."

After blurting this out, he didn't dare look at the Daoist Master's face. He just continued to plead and apologize, clutching the jade box containing the gift, his face pale with fright.

No matter how much Duche begged and pleaded, it did not reflect the sincerity of the White Ye Immortal Sect. Ninety-nine percent of his fear was simply that Li Ximing would strike him dead with a single palm strike. Sweat poured down his face as he trembled.

'Whether any of that is true is entirely up to his word…'

Li Ximing didn't show his anger. "Oh? Then leave the gift."

Duche could only offer the jade box with both hands. Li Ximing didn't even need to look inside. From the way the man didn't even dare to announce its contents, he knew it couldn't be anything of value.

*Click.*

The jade box opened on its own. The jade slip inside was dull and unremarkable. A single glance told Li Ximing it contained an unknown technique called the *Sweeping Light Art*. It was of the Bright Yang lineage, but its grade was unlisted, and the text was laughably brief.

Duche’s lips trembled. "Our sect does not practice the Bright Yang Dao. My lord searched high and low to find this technique. Although it is not profound, it has an ancient charm… so he sent it as a congratulatory gift…"

Chidu's supposed misfortune could have been a setup by someone else, but the gift was unquestionably the true intention of the White Ye Immortal Sect. It was exactly the same as the offering from the Changxiao Gate! Both were shoddy, ungraded Bright Yang techniques.

When a cultivator reached the Purple Mansion Realm, everyone, unless they were sworn enemies, would attend the celebration to offer congratulations, the value of the gift reflecting their relationship. Both these sects had sent worthless techniques, but they had specifically chosen the Bright Yang lineage and left them ungraded, only describing them as having "an ancient charm."

'They're mocking me, openly and secretly. They don't care what I think, but they've gone through the motions so I have no excuse to retaliate. Without a grade or a proper name, I have no grounds to act.'

'The Daoist Master of the White Ye Immortal Sect is at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm… I wonder what his background is.'

Combined with the gift, the White Ye Immortal Sect’s malice was plain to see. The story about Chidu being injured was just a lie—perhaps even one this man had invented on the spot to save his own skin.

*Thud.*

Li Ximing casually tossed the jade box onto the table. The dull sound made Duche jump as if his soul had left his body. But Li Ximing’s cold expression had vanished, replaced by a smile.

"You may go."
