# Chapter 688: Unification

Since the Jiang Family split apart and fragmented into numerous smaller families, Moongaze Lake became a hidden source of profit for the Xiao Family. Although they did not demand tribute, the Xiao Family had controlled the various mines, spirit springs, and treasured lands on the eastern shore for over two hundred years.

Ultimately, in the eyes of the various families around the lake in earlier years, the Li Family was nothing more than a puppet propped up by the Xiao Family on the buffer zone of the southern shore. Following orders, the Li Family dismantled the Yu Family’s marketplace which led the Yu Family into gradual decline.

From a grand strategic perspective, Xiao Chuting merely played a single move, with minimal effort. Yet he managed to circumvent the ban on crossing domains beyond Azure Pond. He orchestrated the dramatic collapse of the Yu Family that was at its peak. It was a masterful stroke of calculation.

Now that the Li Family was expanding rapidly, they had become the dominant force on the lake. They showed ambitions of unifying the region. Naturally, this encroached upon the Xiao Family’s interests, making the Xiao Family’s stance all the more crucial.

Seeing Xiao Yuansi ask so directly, Li Xijun nodded slightly and replied softly, "The time is approaching. I intend to claim the Yu Family’s territory."

He mentioned only the Yu Family’s territory, signaling that he had no intention of interfering with the other families on the eastern shore. Upon hearing this, Xiao Yuansi did not say much but spoke softly, "Our sect’s Daoist Master recently met with Daoist Master Pu Yu of the Unison Sea’s Quhai Sect while receiving guests in the mountains. It is said that Daoist Master Yuanwu traveled to the Eastern Sea seeking medicine but was politely refused by Pu Yu. Yuanwu was quite displeased and left in a huff."

As soon as Xiao Yuansi said this, Li Xijun immediately understood. Xiao Yuansi continued saying, "Daoist Master Pu Yu’s divine abilities allow him to balance Yin and Yang and perceive life and death... His meaning was that Yuanwu’s six senses are collapsing internally, his essence dissipating externally and his consciousness growing dim. The dark radiance around him shows signs of sudden demise. It’s likely that he already has one foot in the underworld."

Upon hearing this, Li Ximing smiled slightly. Ju Wu, witnessing them discussing the life and death of a Daoist Master, was terrified. He kept his head lowered. Then, Li Ximing asked, "Was Daoist Master Yuanwu seeking an elixir of longevity? He seems to be only in the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm... Surely, he’s not attempting to break through to the Golden Core Realm?"

Xiao Yuansi replied softly, "He sought a Purple Mansion Lotus Water's Tranquil Origin for a body-snatching ritual. However, his divine arts have no connection to this path, it is an endeavor doomed to certain death. Daoist Master Pu Yu is a grandmaster in this field, how could he not see through it? Naturally, he refused to let him misuse it."

After finishing this explanation, he then added, "I must also take Ju Wu with me for further questioning. And Guiluan... did she fail her breakthrough and pass away in meditation?"

Li Xijun silently nodded. Xiao Yuansi had personally escorted the girl here for marriage back then. He couldn't help but sigh and said, "Upon hearing this, Guitu was deeply sorrowful. However, he has sealed the mountain and is not allowed to leave. He entrusted me to ask on his behalf, as a token of his condolences.

"Although Mount Wu is a place for witchcraft cultivation, its spiritual energy is quite extraordinary and could be put to great use. Once your esteemed family has cleared the dense forests, send a letter, and our family will surely come to offer our congratulations."

Xiao Yuansi said no more, cupping his hands lightly before grabbing the wailing and pleading Ju Wu. The two brothers escorted him out of the territory, then rode the wind back. Li Ximing remarked, "So Master’s stance is that the Xiao Family supports our family’s annexation of this land. The grand momentum is already in place."

Li Xijun responded softly, "Whether they support it or not, our family is set on taking Moongaze Lake. Given our ties, it’s only natural to turn this small benefit into goodwill."

Li Ximing nodded, glancing at the surrounding landscape before he said with a sigh, "The spiritual energy here is dense, there isn’t a single mountain in our family’s domain that can compare. Moving here for cultivation would be ideal."

Li Xijun only took a brief look before replying softly, "Among the lands of Mount Yue, only Huo Luo'e remains unyielding. We should press forward in one go and bring him under our governance."

The two soared on the wind. Li Xijun turned to Kongheng, who had remained silent the entire time, and asked, "Master Monk, who exactly is this Daoist Master Pu Yu?"

Kongheng pressed his hands together slightly and answered, "The overseas realms are vast, and the expanses of water are even greater than the mainland. Various sects exist, some hidden and some known. I have only heard that the Quhai Sect resides in Penglai, a sacred land that appears and disappears at times."

After some brief discussion, they soon arrived at Huo Luo'e’s territory. This was the southernmost area, it was close to Mount Dali. The region was sparsely populated and it appeared desolate.

Huo Luo'e had little presence among the Mount Yue regions. It was said that he was a reclusive cultivator with a taciturn nature, rarely interacting with others. Even his cultivation site was an openly accessible immortal mountain with weak protective formations.

He kept his mountain gates open and allowed anyone from Mount Yue with a spiritual orifice to enter and cultivate as they wished. He allowed them to learn as much or as little as they pleased. As a result, the mountain became widely occupied by various individuals, including some from the Li Family. Thus, the three of them traveled south and quickly arrived.

Li Xijun had already inquired about Huo Luo'e and developed an interest in recruiting him. Adopting a courteous approach before resorting to force, he called out in a powerful voice, "Li Xijun of the Qingdu Li family has come to pay a visit. Senior, please open the formation!"

After a few seconds, a figure rose on the wind. He was only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, appearing as a young man. He had a calm and respectful demeanor, his posture steady. He spoke politely. "I am Duan Duan. My master left for distant travels several months ago and left a message for me to convey."

He bowed his head deeply in utmost reverence and continued, "Huo Luo'e has occupied this sacred land for cultivation, offending many. Today, he follows the current eastward, heading to the Eastern Sea, never to return. All the spiritual items and talents he has gathered over forty years are left in Huo Luo Mountain, free for you to take."

Huo Luo'e ran away!

The two brothers exchanged glances, showing little surprise. Huo Luo'e either refused to join their sect or simply did not trust them. For him, avoiding a meeting altogether was the best option.

Descending into the mountain, they found that all the disciples had already opened the gates and surrendered. They were kneeling neatly in formation. There were only a few at the Qi Cultivation Realm and dozens at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. All of them looked well-trained. Dressed in eastern attire, they bowed their heads in submission and displayed no Mount Yue customs.

Li Xijun turned to look down at the Mount Yue lands beneath his feet, silently contemplating, The northern Mount Yue territories have all fallen into our hands. The entire southern shore of Moongaze Lake... now bears the Li name.

Several months later, at the royal court of Northern Mount Yue.

Blood dripped down the steps, pooling below. The silver-crafted throne gleamed, while toppled lampstands lay extinguished in the bloody water. Two rows of family soldiers stood silently.

Since the great defeat of Xian Du, Chen Yang and Dili Youjie had led two separate forces, sweeping through the entire Northern Mount Yue like a storm. Crushing all resistance, they reached the royal court.

The bright Radiant Origin Pass shone in the sky. Anyone in Northern Mount Yue could see its radiance upon looking up. With Eastern Mount Yue and the Li Family’s forces attacking simultaneously, the already crumbling Northern Mount Yue quickly fell entirely.

Dili Youjie knelt quietly at the foot of the steps, looking up at Li Zhouwei standing before the throne, silently contemplating, I wonder which prince they intend to support for this throne... or will they simply erase Northern Mount Yue and hand it to Li Jiman? That would be overly cumbersome...

As he was lost in thought, Li Zhouwei spoke in a low voice, "Dili Youjie, step forward."

The Mount Yue warrior hurriedly got up and ascended the steps in a few strides. A strong premonition surged in his heart, his blood rushing to his head. Then, he saw Li Zhouwei point his halberd at the silver throne and say softly, "Sit down."

Dili Youjie sat down in a daze, his mind exploding like lightning with thoughts racing through him. For a brief moment, he hallucinated spear tips pressing against his neck. Looking up, he saw the dazzling radiance above.

"Dili Youjie, the letter says you are young and capable. A grand fortune is being bestowed upon you, be sure to seize it!" said Li Zhouwei.

In just two short months, Dili Youjie had risen from a destitute family outside Great Jueting to the ruler of Northern Mount Yue. No matter how wildly he had imagined his future, he never thought grand fortune would mean this. He had assumed it was reserved for the esteemed families.

Li Zhouwei said nothing more, merely watching him in silence. Dili Youjie wiped away his tears and dropped to his knees with a thud, solemnly declaring, "The Dili Family will never betray its kin! The Dili Family will forever be the loyal hounds of the Grand Concord of Radiance...!"

He murmured his vow twice, but Li Zhouwei did not put much faith in mere words. Holding his halberd, he listened silently. Then, the sound of footsteps echoed from the courtyard, and several figures entered. There were some burly men wielding golden hammers and other elderly men with heads full of white hair. Leading them was a young man clad in a wolf-fur cloak, radiating a powerful aura.

Li Zhouwei put away his weapon, glanced at him and ordered, "Step down."

Dili Youjie was stunned but hurriedly withdrew. He then saw Li Zhouwei put away his weapon and descend quickly from the high platform, bowing respectfully. He said, "Minghuang greets father."

Li Chengliao nodded. Before anyone could speak, a subordinate stepped forward and reported, "General Chen has arrived!"

Chen Yang strode forward, his sword still dripping with blood. His demeanor had changed after the fierce battles. Looking toward the highest position in the hall, he saw a young man standing there, lost in thought.

"Peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

Chen Yang had advanced to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, developing his spiritual sense and finally gaining the ability to perceive others’ cultivation. When he examined Li Zhouwei, he realized that Zhouwei was already prepared to enter seclusion for the Qi Cultivation Realm at any moment. This caused his heart to pause.

As he hesitated, he quickly noticed another figure in the hall. A broad-shouldered man draped in wolf fur, standing with his hands behind his back. He was at the Qi Cultivation Realm.

"Chen Yang greets the Patriarch!" said Chen Yang.

Li Chengliao nodded and before anyone could speak, he said with a chuckle, "Not bad."

Li Chengliao glanced around, then sat at the head seat and spoke softly, "In these past months, the Mount Yue territories have nearly been settled. I will keep this brief."

As he entered, he had already seen the scene of Dili Youjie seated on the royal court’s throne. Li Chengliao understood that his eldest son had chosen Dili Youjie as the ruler of Northern Mount Yue and immediately declared, "Dili Youjie shall be established as the ruler of Northern Mount Yue. The borders shall remain unchanged. Cultivators from our family will enter to survey the spirit fields and examine the spiritual energy. All governing systems will follow the precedents set by Eastern Mount Yue.

"The former territories of Huo Luo'e and Fei Luoya shall all be incorporated under Eastern Mount Yue’s domain. As for the eight easternmost towns of Eastern Mount Yue, which are now largely populated by Easterners. They shall be restructured into a new prefecture and placed under the governance of Wutu Peak."

These matters had been agreed upon before the expedition but repeating them ensured that Li Zhouwei heard them clearly. Seeing that he had no objections, Li Chengliao waved his hand and instructed the gathered officials to take their men and begin surveying the spirit fields. He said, "You may all leave."

Dili Youjie, still kneeling, glanced around carefully. Not seeing Li Jiman’s figure, he let out a deep breath of relief.

Realizing that this future rival, whom he would inevitably have conflicts with, had not only lost the most prosperous lands but wasn’t even given a seat in the family discussions. Dili Youjie felt a great sense of satisfaction and secretly rejoiced in his heart, Li Jiman, your era is over. Now, it is the second lineage that holds the family power. The Grand Concord of Radiance personally appointed me as ruler. The only thing you surpass me in is cultivation...

Having only just ascended to this position, his mindset had already shifted. Brushing the dust from his robe, he left the hall and began his own silent calculations.

As the others departed, only Li Chengliao and his son remained in the hall. At last, a trace of concern appeared on Li Chengliao’s face as he spoke softly, "There are two matters I must inform you of... First, the senior White Ape has entered seclusion to attempt a breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Hm?" Li Zhouwei was slightly taken aback. The White Ape had protected him since childhood, and he had deep feelings for it. Now hearing this news, he asked, "There likely isn’t an Essence Gathering Pill, is there?"

"Of course not." Li Chengliao sighed and replied, "This pill has long been controlled by Azure Pond. Even a powerful family like the Xiao Family must rely on connections within the sect to obtain it... When your granduncle made his breakthrough, he may not have even had this pill to aid him."

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze slightly, but then saw Li Chengliao gather his thoughts and deliver an even greater piece of news. He said, "Your grandfather... has entered seclusion to attempt a breakthrough to Foundation Establishment Realm. Several of your uncles have already returned to witness it..."

Although Li Xicheng’s innate ability was not as high as his brothers’, he was more than ten years their senior. After years of tempering himself, he had long since reached the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Now, it seemed he had finally decided to attempt his breakthrough.
