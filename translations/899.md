# Chapter 899: Purple Jade

A brilliant light flashed.

Inside the pavilion, pure qi drifted through an ethereal glow, as if sun and moon shone at once. A man in white-gold Daoist robes exhaled a plume of white mist. As his eyes slowly opened, the pure qi in the room stirred.

"What an incredible place to cultivate."

The Spiritual Qi in this pavilion was the richest he had ever encountered. He had seen the Pristine Water spiritual pool at Azure Pond, but even that paled in comparison to this place.

But as he cultivated, a sense of shock grew within him. The most crucial aspect wasn't the sheer density of the Spiritual Qi, but the fact that the spiritual balance of yin and yang here was perfectly stable and utterly unshakeable.

This concept might seem common, and it wasn't rare for cultivators—the grotto-heaven at Green Pine Temple had once boasted a similar balance. But the equilibrium in this pavilion was different. It was as unyielding as iron, absolutely immoveable!

It was common knowledge that cultivators and the local spiritual balance influenced one another. A place might start with perfect equilibrium, but as soon as someone performed a Dharma Art, cultivated, or refined artifacts and pills, it would inevitably disrupt the local yin and yang, causing fluctuations...

Yet here, whether Li Ximing unleashed his Purple Mansion Realm's True Fire or his Divine Ability, Heavenly Light, the surrounding yin and yang qi remained utterly still. Even when he sat to cultivate, drawing in Spiritual Qi at the terrifying speed of his Purple Mansion Realm, he couldn't alter a single inch of the space around him. The Spiritual Qi maintained its absolute, perfect equilibrium.

Li Ximing even suspected that if he were to die here and dissipate into Bright Yang Heavenly Light, the area wouldn't show a wisp of Bright Yang qi. It wouldn't even produce a single colorful cloud.

As an alchemist, Li Ximing immediately grasped the terrifying potential of this characteristic:

"This location... for refining certain medicinal pills... or even certain Spiritual Artifacts... it's beyond perfect. It's terrifyingly convenient."

He made a mental note and rose to his feet, feeling utterly refreshed and overflowing with power. His previous injuries were fully healed, and his cultivation had clearly advanced.

A quick calculation surprised him. He had been in seclusion for over a year. This meant the Northern Buddhists had been quiet during that time, and Tinglan and Ning Wan hadn't run into any serious trouble.

Li Ximing had spent seventy percent of that year mastering Tread on Flames.

'I've grasped the basics of Tread on Flames and can finally use it in combat. And the Radiant Celestial Wave Art... cultivation was surprisingly fast. It only took a short while to get the hang of it. I don't expect it to be as powerful as a true Divine Ability, but at least the core concept is sound.'

Li Ximing didn't expect this Dharma Art to rival the likes of Changxiao or be comparable to a Divine Ability, but if it could just stall an opponent or block an attack, that would be a huge boon.

He had awakened from his cultivation now because the jade talisman at his waist was pulsing with warmth—a clear sign that family matters required his attention.

He stepped out of the pocket dimension, materializing within the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda amid a storm of crackling lightning. The potent bolts felt like a warm bath washing over him. With another step, he passed through the pagoda and arrived atop Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

He took his seat and extended his spiritual sense. He immediately perceived a stranger—another Daoist Master—in the small pavilion outside the mountain's wards. Li Jiangqian was there as well, having clearly finished his own seclusion, and was waiting patiently and politely at the visitor's side.

He called out in a clear voice, "Fellow Daoist, please enter!"

The mountain's grand formation opened. A gust of gray wind descended from the sky, carrying a grim, chilling aura. It coalesced before him, taking the form of a robed Daoist Master.

The man's robes were unusual, and a treasured saber hung at his waist. His eyes were dark, his aura unstable, and it seemed to ripple with the light of a Divine Ability, as if he were actively suppressing some transformation. He looked like a dangerous figure. But, having entered another's territory, he showed the proper courtesy, offering a formal salute.

"This humble Daoist, Dingyang Zi of Qize, greets you, Fellow Daoist."

Li Ximing had already guessed this was the expert Kui Qi had found. He sized him up, estimating he hadn't yet reached the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, though it was impossible to tell how many Divine Abilities he possessed. He smiled and replied, "Please!"

He then sent someone to fetch the texts on shamanic arts while he personally gave the Daoist Master a tour of Gardenia Scenery Mountain, pointing out the lingering traces of the old Mount Wu.

But Mount Wu had been thoroughly looted. After so many years, and with Li Ximing's own power now settled over the mountain, there was little of the old aura left to find. Dingyang Zi clearly wasn't satisfied with what he saw. However, Li Ximing wasn't demanding anything and treated him with great respect, giving him plenty of "face." The Daoist Master's expression softened considerably, and he spoke in a low, more amiable tone:

"A pity. Duanmu Kui was formidable, but he was clearly unwilling to pass down his true arts. This Mount Wu is rather underwhelming."

Soon, someone carried over a chest of jade slips and placed it at Dingyang Zi's feet. The Daoist Master sat upright and accepted a summary catalog from Li Ximing. As he scanned the descriptions of the shamanic arts, his brow furrowed and relaxed intermittently. It was clear he found the collection to be rather ordinary.

Li Ximing knew perfectly well what he was offering. If there had been any truly potent shamanic arts left on Mount Wu, his family would have claimed it long ago. What remained was mostly low-grade material, useful perhaps for a few novel ideas, but nothing more. He silently sipped his tea.

Dingyang Zi set the catalog slip down. He said nothing further, but he seemed preoccupied. He abruptly picked up his jade cup, drained it in one gulp, and said, "I'd like to see the dharma artifact now."

Li Ximing handed him the jade box. The moment the cultivator opened it, his eyes lit up. "A fine treasure!" he exclaimed.

An item from the Southern Songzhou Luoshe was clearly high-quality. He lifted it, scrutinizing every detail for a long time. A look of genuine reluctance surfaced on his face. "Fellow Daoist," he said in a low voice, "if you'd be willing, I would very much like to trade you for this..."

There was no way Li Ximing would let him trade for it. He politely declined in a few words. Dingyang Zi knew it was a long shot and dropped the subject readily. "The Tiger's Frontier Upper Sect already spoke to me about this matter," he said, all business. "I have already made my decision, so I won't waste time with pleasantries."

He said gravely, "I cannot say how long it will take to refine this artifact. It could be a short time, or it could be many years. My own operation is small, not a large enterprise like yours on the lake, and I lack the abundant resources of Moongaze. Therefore, as I work on it, Moongaze will naturally be responsible for providing all necessary resources and materials."

"That is only natural."

When Li Ximing heard him mention the "Tiger's Frontier Upper Sect," he sighed inwardly but simply acknowledged the point. Dingyang Zi continued, "My Qize's Daoist tradition is shackled by the Changhuai Upper Sect. We lack many methods, and our access to medicinal pills is even worse. I am not skilled in alchemy, which brings me to another point."

"I have been refining for many years. I hope that you, Fellow Daoist, can send one Essence Gathering Pills to Qize each year. Furthermore, when the spirit embryo is successfully forged, I will require six Purple Mansion Realm-level pills: 'Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder'. I have brought the pill formula and the main ingredients with me."

"Oh?" Li Ximing smiled faintly. With his alchemy skills, Essence Gathering Pills were no problem at all. As for this "Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder," he could examine the formula first. He calmly accepted the materials and took a closer look.

'A spirit pill for cleansing the senses, purifying the mind, and advancing one's cultivation. It would be extremely difficult for an ordinary alchemist, and its purpose is very specific... After all, if I couldn't guarantee all six pills and ended up wasting his main ingredients, I would certainly make an enemy.'

The difficulty was less than that of the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill, which Li Ximing already had a surplus of. Why wouldn't he agree? He gave the formula a final scan, happily accepted the task, and smiled. "Done!"

His crisp, unhesitating "Done!" made Dingyang Zi regard him with newfound respect. The visiting Daoist Master placed the jade box with the formula and ingredients on the table, then collected the dharma artifact and the chest of shamanic arts. He offered a salute, "I have another Spiritual Artifact currently being refined in my furnace. It is at a critical stage. Although I have attendants watching it, I cannot be away from Qize for long. But rest assured, Fellow Daoist. I will start a second furnace and oversee them both. I will certainly handle your matter perfectly."

"I cannot stay any longer. If fate permits, we shall speak more in the future!"

Li Ximing now understood the reason for his curt, direct manner. His unpleasant expression upon arriving must have been from worrying about the Spiritual Artifact back in his furnace. Li Ximing quickly escorted him out, sighing to himself.

'Kui Qi has some serious influence. The Tiger's Frontier Upper Sect... they brought this man all the way to the lake with just a word. If they had a truly urgent matter and made him a promise, Dingyang Zi would have been hard-pressed to refuse. If it weren't for that critical Spiritual Artifact in his furnace, Kui Qi would have probably roped him into fighting the Buddhist cultivators!'

...

Moongaze Lake.

Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed. Heavy, dark clouds massed over the lake, turning the water's reflection to ink. A few commoners in small boats paddled frantically, fleeing across the surface. After a moment, a cultivator emerged to greet them.

Apricot-colored flames flickered into existence, dancing and coalescing in mid-air. A man in crimson robes descended upon the fire, his gaze fixed on a distant mountain peak.

His expression was uneasy as he watched the strange atmospheric disturbance. As he waited, a deafening crack of thunder split the sky, and a brilliant flash of lightning shot forward, revealing a burly man. "Hahahahaha!"

The man was massive and hairy, with an incredibly robust physique. He wore a suit of jade armor, and two fist-sized bronze bells hung from his waist. Beaming with triumph, he roared, "Family Head!"

Li Jiangqian clasped his hands, breathing a sigh of relief. With a guest still on the mountain, the sudden, ominous shift in the sky had made him fear that the Purple Mansion Realm masters had come to blows. Realizing it was one of his own clansmen having a breakthrough, he quickly smiled. "Congratulations, Clan Uncle!"

The man before him was, of course, Li Zhouda, the one who had inherited Li Chenghui's legacy. After struggling for so many years, he had finally succeeded. Having achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, he was bursting with pride. He waved his hand, searching for words, but after a long pause, he just boomed, "What a feeling!"

Li Jiangqian chuckled and guided him down. "Your breakthrough comes at a perfect time, Clan Uncle. Congratulations!"

Li Zhouda had taken a long time to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm; the family's medicinal pills had clearly played a significant role. Without those resources, his chances would have been slim. In fact, so much time had passed that rumors had begun to circulate that he had perished during the attempt.

Li Zhouda, having just emerged, knew nothing of these rumors. He was in high spirits, laughing as he replied, "It's truly a blessing from the ancestors! I feared I was too incompetent to continue the lineage. This is a joyous occasion! I'm going to hold a grand banquet when I return. All the family branches must come and honor me with their presence!"

He was not a reserved man, and his face beamed with pride. As other family cultivators gathered around to offer their own congratulations, Li Jiangqian smiled and stepped to the side, his gaze sweeping over the crowd as if counting them.

Li Jiangqian himself had been out of seclusion for over six months. He had broken through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm and consolidated his cultivation. In truth, with the Talisman Pill he possessed, reaching the late-stage was well within his grasp. However, with so many eyes watching, such rapid advancement would seem suspicious, so he had held off on consuming it.

During his time out of seclusion, he had taken the rare opportunity to set aside family duties and focus on his Dharma Art. The Great Parting Scripture was an outstanding Daoist tradition, and it was clear from his vibrant aura that he had made significant progress.

As the crowd celebrated, the heavy, dark clouds from the breakthrough began to recede. The eastern sky, however, grew hazy, tinged with a faint purple glow. A streak of Heavenly Light shot over from the lake, materializing into a figure before them. The crowd immediately bowed. "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

"Not bad." The figure was Li Ximing, just returned from escorting his guest. He nodded to Li Zhouda in approval, but his gaze was fixed on the distant horizon, his expression a mixture of doubt and gravity. 'Such an expanse of purple haze.'

Such celestial phenomena were never simple. The eastern clouds were a deep, abundant purple, stacked like tiles across the sky. When the Morning Glow struck them, they lit up in shades of violet and gold—a spectacular and auspicious sight.

He couldn't dwell on it. "See to his arrangements," he instructed the group. "I'm going to take a look."

He dissolved into a streak of light and shot eastward. In what felt like only a few steps, he arrived over the bustling Yufu Prefecture. Cultivators were rising and falling through the air, whispering amongst themselves. A Divine Ability flashed in the sky, and a man in brownish-gray robes emerged. "Senior Houfu!"

Daoist Master Houfu was already there, nodding in admiration. When he saw Li Ximing, he descended on his cloud to greet him, gesturing him over. "A joyous event!" he praised. "A wondrous breakthrough has been achieved."

That single phrase, "a wondrous breakthrough," clarified everything. Li Ximing, who had been nursing a hopeful suspicion, was instantly overjoyed. He clapped his hands. "Good! Excellent! The Purple Smoke Blessed Land truly lives up to its name—its fortune runs deep!"

Just then, a cloud of purple qi swirled and rose from the blessed land, revealing a woman robed in swirling purple mist. A longsword of pure purple jade was strapped to her back. Her features were lovely. She bowed gracefully in mid-air and smiled. "Ziyu greets all Fellow Daoists!"

In front of her stood Tinglan, dressed in autumn-yellow robes, her face alight with even greater joy. "This is Kan Ziyu, Daoist title Wenqing," she announced. "Today, she has successfully achieved her Divine Ability."

The assembled cultivators all voiced their congratulations. Kan Ziyu, her face flushed with happiness, followed Tinglan's lead, returning the salutes one by one. The blessed land was filled with a festive atmosphere, shimmering with auspicious light.

'Kan Ziyu...' Li Ximing mused. 'If I calculate it properly, she's from the same generation as my grand-uncle, Li Xuanfeng. I should be considered the same generation as Qian Lizi. But Jiangnan cultivators don't fuss over such lineage unless they're from the same sect. Here, precedence is determined by when one achieves a Divine Ability, and the accomplished becomes the senior.' Thus, Daoist Master Wenqing still saluted him with the respect due to a senior.

Daoist Master Tinglan scanned the group and smiled. "Ziyu must now consolidate her cultivation and stabilize her new Divine Ability. We thank all of you, Fellow Daoists, for your well-wishes."

Li Ximing was visibly pleased, thinking to himself, 'This is a true blessing. Help when it's needed most.'

'Thinking about it, Kan Ziyu's generation had many geniuses. Apart from the few in seclusion at Azure Pond Sect, Xiukui also has Lin Chensheng, who cultivates the Upper Shaman path. I wonder if he's managed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm yet.'

As he was pondering this, he realized that Houfu was supposed to be stationed at the Great Western Plateau. He couldn't help but ask, "Senior, your duties in the west..."

Houfu smiled at him. "The Supreme Yang Dao's rotation to guard that place is an old rule," he replied. "But I'd been there so long I grew weary of it. I discussed it with Sword Gate several times, and they agreed to take over the post from my Xiukui. Sword Gate will handle the remaining years of the term. I also asked Daoist Master Ni of Wu State to assist. We simply have to repay the favor next time."

Li Ximing smiled. "That's a clever solution."

Sword Gate was known to be rigid, constrained by that Sword Scripture of theirs. Although they had two Daoist Masters, Li Ximing had never once seen Daoist Master Cheng attend a gathering of the Supreme Yang Dao. This spoke volumes about his attitude—he clearly preferred to avoid worldly conflict. The only one in Sword Gate truly intent on changing the situation was Lingmei.

Given the sect's stance, Lingmei faced great resistance to acting openly. This rotation swap was, without a doubt, his way of helping them indirectly. Li Ximing nodded to himself in approval.

'And they've also brought this Daoist Master Ni into the fold. It's clear... while I was in seclusion, the Daoist Masters of the Supreme Yang Dao haven't been idle for a moment. They are constantly gathering strength.'

Just as he was thinking this, Tinglan approached, riding a cloud of purple qi. Kan Ziyu's breakthrough had clearly been a surprise to her. Even with her usual composure, she couldn't quite contain her delight. "Zhaojing is out of seclusion," she smiled.

Li Ximing smiled and nodded. She gestured for him to accompany her toward Tangdao Mountain. "Ning Wan has gone to the Shahuan Kingdom and was planning to visit the Southern Sea as well, so she isn't here at the moment..."

Her expression turned serious. "After all, we have connections with both the Shahuan Kingdom and the Southern Songzhou Luoshe. She's gone to call in those favors, to see if there's any chance of securing their aid..."

Li Ximing nodded his understanding. Tangdao Mountain was already before them. It was shrouded in an iridescent, dark light that constantly shifted and folded, resolving into myriad shapes. A powerful, ancient aura washed over them.

Tinglan and Ning Wan hadn't constructed a full Purple Mansion Realm grand formation, as the Li family had done at their home. Such an undertaking was incredibly complex, and this wasn't a permanent sect headquarters, so there was no need. Instead, they were using a Purple Mansion Realm-grade formation-disk Spiritual Artifact for protection, leveraging their own cultivation in the Dao of formations to amplify its power. The resulting display was still formidable.

But when Li Ximing saw the artifact, he sighed to himself. 'That is definitely a Spiritual Artifact from the Great Xiukui Monastery's Daoist tradition. It seems Kui Qi was right—their trip to the Northern Sea was a failure.'
