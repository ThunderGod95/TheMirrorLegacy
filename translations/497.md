# Chapter 742: The Eve

Night deepened over Mount Qingdu. Li Xijun had not entered seclusion and stood amid wind and snow among the clouds at the mountain’s peak. After waiting a while, he saw a bolt of violet lightning weaving through the clouds. It halted before him and transformed into two figures.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

“Aunt! Little Sister.” Li Xijun called out, and before him stood Li Qinghong in jade armor with her white spear, and his younger sister Li Yuexiang. Li Qinghong descended on the lightning and spoke softly, “Xijun.”

Li Yuexiang followed behind and greeted him. Li Xijun merely nodded and offered his congratulations, “Congratulations on your cultivation breakthrough, Aunt. I’ve heard things are in chaos out at sea. I’ve been meaning to go pick up Little Sister... but couldn’t spare the time. I was about to send a letter to Brother Xizhi when I happened to be on my way back.”

“Was the journey back safe?” Li Qinghong descended with him into the main hall, and only after they sat down did she speak, “There were some surprises... thinking back on it, something doesn’t add up.”

She recounted the events of her journey. After listening carefully, Li Xijun pondered for a moment and replied, “There is something odd, but it's hard to see clearly. The Eastern Sea is vast, how did you just happen to run into the Miao Family and the Shens? Perhaps some faction is behind it...

“Even if you hadn’t gone, Shen Yanqing surely could’ve held out until the Shen Family’s head arrived. I don’t think their Daoist Master used your strength to save her... I’ve never heard this Daoist Master’s Life Divine Ability to be particularly cunning either, so it’s likely not him.”

Li Qinghong nodded, she had been reflecting along the way as well. She spoke softly, “I suspect someone recognized the Duruo and used this method to inform the Miao Family... But thinking deeper, what was the point? If a Daoist Master had intentions for it, it’s only a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact. Would our family refuse if they simply came to claim it?

“I’ve heard the Miao Family also has a Daoist Master. If the artifact were truly so important, they could’ve torn through the great void and taken it from me as easily as lifting a garment off a bed. They’d earn a favor, and we’d owe them thanks. Why resort to all these twists and turns?”

Li Xijun held a jade cup in hand, nodded slightly, and said, “The Profund Thunderstone... just by the name, it’s clearly no ordinary item. For Miao Quan to request it even while facing pressure from two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, it must be something extremely vital.”

He actually had some suspicions in his heart, but lacking certainty, he didn't want to speak them aloud, Could it be that Daoist Master Chuting used those two as a mouthpiece to tell Aunt about the Profund Thunderstone? But there’s no need for all that, he could’ve just sent someone to say a word. Doing it this vague way only leaves us with a name.

The aunt and nephew exchanged a glance, seeming to reach some unspoken agreement, and quickly moved on from the topic. Li Xijun simply said, “In any case... I’ll look into this matter properly.”

Li Qinghong then explained what the Cui Family of Chongzhou had said. After a moment of hesitation, she recounted her conversation with Chi Buzi. Li Xijun broke into a cold sweat just listening, not daring to speak rashly, and replied, “The Cui Family said the Ning Family might have it, then I’ll write a letter to the southern border to inquire.”

The aunt and nephew discussed for a while. Then Li Xijun began writing, one hand pressed to his sleeve, and said warmly, “Yuexiang...”

He had wanted to bring up his younger sister Yuexiang’s marriage, but when he saw his aunt smiling at him, he suddenly remembered his own status was still unsettled, and stopped, a bit embarrassed.

Li Qinghong removed her jade armor and gently placed it on the table. She took a white outer robe from her storage pouch and draped it over herself, it blended seamlessly with her snow-white inner garments. She said, “My cultivation has progressed. I no longer have need for this spirit armor, it's time to return it to the family.”

Li Xijun nodded and put it away. Li Qinghong thought for a moment, then asked, “By the way... does the heir have any armor? If the chance arises, I’d like to craft a set for him.”

“Armor...” Li Xijun fell silent for a moment, then said softly, “Aunt... our family does have some spirit ores, even ones suitable for Foundation Establishment Realm. But I still think we should use them to forge a spirit armor or feathered robe for you instead.”

“For me?” Li Qinghong frowned slightly, but then saw Li Xijun smile and say, “He’s still just cultivating within the family now. In the future, he’ll be managing the family and its affairs. With his bold personality, he’ll have no trouble obtaining whatever fine items he wants. Aunt, you should think of yourself for once.”

Li Xijun brushed his hand over the storage pouch at his waist and retrieved several items. The first being a piece of gleaming, silvery refined iron. He said, “This is Nishui Cold Essence. Our family’s iron mine has been in operation for decades. The cold iron extracted was refined repeatedly, and the most refined essence has been preserved here. It has been refined over two hundred times, producing this Foundation Establishment Realm material.”

Next was a thin golden sheet, which Li Xijun explained, “This, Aunt, you know already. It’s Altar Goldstone. It was obtained alongside the Earth-View Bloodstone that can heal and save lives. Also Foundation Establishment Realm, though not very large in size...”

This was originally meant to forge a dharma artifact for Li Ximing. But after acquiring the Sun Seeker Ring, it seemed he already had one. Yet as Green Pine Temple’s name became increasingly controversial, no one dared to use it...

Li Ximing was single-minded in his cultivation and cared little for dharma artifacts, so with chaos looming, they decided to take it out early for crafting.

The final item was a pale-blue, head-sized ore. It was a Heyu Emerald, barely Foundation Establishment Realm, but abundant in quantity. It was taken from the Yu Family’s treasury.

He handed all these items to Li Qinghong and simply said, “Aunt, please use these to forge yourself spirit armor or a feathered robe.”

Li Qinghong was briefly surprised but then nodded and accepted them, saying gently, “The Azure Pond Sect will surely conscript Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to the north. I’ll lead the group myself, having a set of spirit armor will be safer.”

She paused and added softly, “Among the many markets, we don’t really know any trustworthy artifact smiths. In times like these, with constant unrest, who’s to say they won’t take our materials and vanish? I can’t bring myself to trust them.”

Having spent a long time in the Eastern Sea, Li Qinghong’s way of thinking had taken on the region’s pragmatism, she always considered the worst outcome first. She simply said, “Let’s wait a bit, Xizhi may be returning soon. Better to let him handle these things.”

“You’re right, Aunt,” replied Li Xijun.

Changtian Peak.

Li Xizhi searched through several pavilions on the peak but couldn’t find a single scroll. There was no sign of a fire vein or pill furnace, and the medicinal gardens were completely desolate. Only the central main hall had a jade slip hanging within, hidden behind the hall. With his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation and careful inspection, Li Xizhi spotted and retrieved it at once. It was the Complete Mercury Ingestion Method of the fourth grade.

It was indeed a quality technique, though it seemed to be already available for reference within the sect. It lacked a method for spiritual qi intake and required a substance called White Mercury Cinnabar Elixir, which appeared to be quite rare.

Yang Ruizao strolled casually with him along the mountain paths as they chatted. After a while, someone arrived delivering a translucent jade slip. Li Xizhi read it through. Changtian Peak indeed had a long history, with its own inherited cultivation method that had been passed down within the peak, rarely relying on sect-wide techniques.

It could be traced back four hundred years. The peak master then was known as Daoist Changtian, who cultivated in the Helin Mountain Range before joining the Azure Pond Sect and being granted a peak of his own.

He specialized in the Whole Pill Dao, particularly Secret White Mercury, and was once considered one of the two greats alongside Ning Wenyue, the Moon Lake Peak master who cultivated Lake Moon Autumn.

Later, Daoist Changtian perished, and his teachings were passed into the sect. Successors tried to follow the Dao, but none matched his level. Their cultivation progressed slowly, even lagging behind standard techniques. The lineage steadily declined, yet each generation stubbornly persisted. With the death of the last peak master, Zhang Lingshu, the lineage was considered severed. All chants and secret texts vanished, leaving behind only a single cultivation method.

The Yang Family had noted that this technique, still stored in the Sutra Repository, had remained untouched to this day. It, too, was named Complete Mercury Ingestion Method.

Secret White Mercury... thought Li Xizhi.

Now that Li Xizhi held peak master status and had the Yang Family’s backing, his access to information was gradually improving. Seeing he didn’t quite understand, Yang Ruizao softly explained, “Xizhi, this Secret White Mercury belongs to the Whole Pill Dao.”

To Li Xizhi, it sounded like something of Metal Virtue, but the three metals were Swamp Metal, Geng Metal, and Xiao Metal. There was nothing called the Whole Pill. So he asked, “Is it a metallic essence?”

Yang Ruizao shook his head and said, “If you’re referring to classifications like the Five Waters as Water Virtue, the Five Fires as Fire Virtue, the Twelve Qi, primal magnetism, or yin and yang. The Whole Pill Dao doesn’t fall under any of these. It’s part of what we call Ancient Merging Techniques.

“The Xiukui from the Great Xiukui Temple, the Jade True of the True Monarch Shangyuan, even the Hengzhu of the Hengzhu Dao, all fall under this category. They often carry an air of shamanic mystery, ambiguity between real and illusory, and the ancient alchemical flavor of mercury-ingesting and metal-seeking.

“From descriptions alone... Secret White Mercury is truly mysterious and profound. While it may not excel in direct combat compared to modern techniques, it can do so much more in so many other areas...”

Li Xizhi quietly took note of it and thought to himself, Since I’ve inherited someone else’s Dao lineage, if I can gather the right spiritual qi and when I can take on disciples in the future, at least one of them should cultivate this Dao...

After putting the jade slip away, he saw another stream of Heavenly Glow flying in from the south. Yang Ruizao looked up in surprise, did a quick calculation, and said, “Looks like it’s the fourth wave of reinforcements, the sect has sent most of its own by now, and it’s probably time to conscript from the various esteemed families.”

Li Xizhi nodded. Then Yang Ruizao asked, “I wonder if your name is on the list...”

The two exchanged a glance, and Li Xizhi simply nodded. Yang Ruizao smiled and said, “Yes, even if the deployment orders haven’t arrived yet... all the benefits have already been handed over. You’ll definitely be sent.”

Though he said it lightly, Yang Ruizao’s expression gradually grew serious. He spoke in a low voice, “There are only two more rounds of dispatch left. Xizhi, you should head out early. If you miss the timing, someone may use it against you.”

Li Xizhi nodded. The two rose into the air together, watching intently as the massive yet elegant Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner folded its long glowing wings and slowly descended into the formation array.

From all thirty-six peaks, people took to the skies. Li Xizhi and his brother-in-law Yang Ruizao stood amidst the clouds, watching as the defensive formation on the cloudliner also faded. Yang Ruizao asked, “I wonder who’s leading the team?”

Just then, as the glowing formation gradually vanished, they saw a golden-armored cultivator standing at the ship’s bow. He had deep-set eyes, broad shoulders, thick white brows and hair, and slightly narrowed old eyes. A fierce golden bow was slung across his back.

The old man’s armor shimmered with white light in the glow as he stood with hands behind his back. Yang Ruizao was slightly startled. He glanced at Li Xizhi beside him and said with a smile, “So it’s Li Xuanfeng, the Golden Bowstring.”

Since Li Xuanfeng was leading this ship, Li Xizhi would naturally go along. He was just about to fly toward the cloudliner when Yang Ruizao beside him paused slightly and said, “My family also has two brothers... They’ll be joining as well.”

Li Xizhi understood the unspoken request at once and, without waiting for him to continue, smiled and said, “Brother-in-law, go ahead and bring them. We’ll head out together, it’ll be good to look after each other on the journey.”

“Much appreciated,” said Yang Ruizao as he took his leave with a smile. Li Xizhi, however, paused thoughtfully, There's no telling whether brother-in-law got wind of the deployment early and wants the Yang Family to accompany my uncle, all under the guise of coincidence...

The Chi Family was exerting heavy influence in this matter. Aside from several peaks under the command of Daoist Master Yuan Xiu, most others had sent direct descendants. Yang Ruizao himself might very well be heading out too.

Li Xizhi wasn’t bothered as relations between esteemed families weren’t built on sentiment alone, but on mutual benefit. The Yang Family had many daughters, and for Yang Ruizao to maintain closeness with him, it was partly due to his own strong cultivation and partly because the Li Family was now powerful. Had the Li Family still been as weak as during Li Tongya’s fall, this brother-in-law would’ve offered little more than a polite smile in passing. None of these connections would exist.

He reviewed everything in his mind but didn’t immediately seek out Li Xuanfeng. Instead, he flew to the General Affairs Hall and used his new command token to receive his official assignment.

Station at Baixiang Valley, on the border of Xu State near Mount Bianyan. Await further orders. Mission: resist devil cultivators...

He stored the token away, retrieved a map for careful study, and after some thought, decided to make a stop at the Sutra Repository just in case.

This Complete Mercury Ingestion Method was, after all, a secret technique left on the peak, there might be a different section or version, he thought.

He searched for about fifteen minutes and borrowed the sect’s copy of Complete Mercury Ingestion Method. After a detailed comparison, he was slightly disappointed.

“The two versions are identical. The only difference is that the one from the peak isn’t restricted. I can bring it back home,” muttered Li Xizhi.

After inquiring, he learned the sect had some White Mercury Cinnabar Elixir available. He returned the borrowed text, boarded the Dawn Cloudliner, and found a private chamber to settle into.

Li Xuanfeng had gone to the main hall to report. Only members of the Ning Family came over to greet him politely.

Li Xizhi waited a little while, and the Yang Family members soon arrived. He recognized a few of the brothers by face, perhaps he’d seen them once when fetching Yang Xiao’er. They followed him into the cabin.

The Yang Family, descended from the ancient Yue kings. They had deep roots and an extensive legacy. Though they had gone through periods of decline, they had now regained stability and begun to display their profound foundation once more.

But Li Xizhi also clearly saw the flaws. In the chaos of earlier times, the Yang Family’s secular branches had been nearly wiped out. With their numbers dwindled, they only had a single peak within the Azure Pond Sect. Children often began cultivation from birth, and the extinction of sub-branches was common.

Moreover, the Yang Family had no external holdings or industries. Nearly every member embodied the aloofness of esteemed family disciples. They were detached from worldly matters, indulgent, and carefree. Having cultivated exclusively atop immortal peaks since youth, they were even more extreme than other families.

Now, gathered before Li Xizhi, they greeted him politely but quickly withdrew to the side, joking amongst themselves without the slightest awareness of the life-or-death battle ahead. Their Dharma robes were bright, but their cultivation was shallow. They gave off an air of frivolity, and that was the better part of it. One of them was only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, with his blood qi murky. What’s worse, he had brought along a woman of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. She was strikingly beautiful and her cultivation method was peculiar, likely of the furnace vessel variety.

Li Xizhi scanned the room but found no one truly noteworthy. His brother-in-law must not have had an easy time managing this lot.

That said... if even one of them can make it through the bloodshed, it might be worth watching. With that thought, a faint eagerness stirred within him, If there’s an opportunity that isn’t too perilous, perhaps I could bring along the younger ones from the Radiant Lure generation.

Li Xizhi rested briefly as the cloud ship beneath his feet began to move. A man at the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm approached from outside the door. He had a pale face without a beard, hair white as snow, bearing a dignified air. Only one sleeve hung empty, and he stopped beside Li Xizhi.

He cupped his hands in greeting and said softly, "I am Fei Yihe. Greetings, young master."

Li Xizhi found the name vaguely familiar, likely one of the Fei Family members who had accompanied them back then. In recent years, under the care of Li Xuanfeng, he had survived despite being covered in wounds.

Li Xizhi returned the courtesy and replied gently, "Xizhi greets the senior."

He then recalled his uncle Li Yuanqin, who had been stationed in the southern border. He was likely younger than himself, though what he looked like now was anyone’s guess. He asked, "I wonder if my uncle has come... I must see him at least once..."

Fei Yihe shook his head and replied, "The master was sent into the sect to cultivate alongside disciples of the Chi Family."
𝐟𝐫𝕖𝗲𝘄𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝕧𝐞𝚕.𝕔𝕠𝐦

Upon hearing this, Li Xizhi’s heart became clear as a mirror. He sighed inwardly, while Fei Yihe appeared somewhat anxious, taking a seat beside him and asking, "I've spent many years in the southern border, often in seclusion. The general has marched to the Eastern Sea once again. I've only heard scattered words about the Fei Family. May I ask, Peak Master... How is my family doing? What realms have Tongyu and Tongxiao reached?"

Li Xizhi nodded slightly and answered, "At present, Young Master Tongyu manages the household. We've lost contact with them, so I know little. I’ve only heard that Young Master Tongxiao failed to make a breakthrough and perished, his Dao and lineage ended."

The news seemed to match the old man's expectations. He showed no visible shock, but at the words ‘perished, Dao ended,’ his fingers trembled on his knee, and he said somewhat at a loss, "Ah... I knew that boy."

Li Xizhi then recounted all the information he knew. Fei Yihe nodded in thanks repeatedly but could say nothing more. He sat upright in his seat, sleeves gathered, remaining silent for most of the journey.

The Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner was incredibly fast. In just a short while, it began to show signs of stopping. Only then did Fei Yihe shake out his sleeve, revealing a hand gone pale from gripping tightly. He pulled out a small letter he had written long ago and said, "If there’s a chance, may I trouble Peak Master to deliver this letter... to the Fei Family on my behalf?"

Over the years, every time Li Xuanfeng returned home, Fei Yihe would ask him to bring a letter. By now, there were at least three, if not five. Had anything changed in the Fei Family? Likely not. Yet this old man remained incessant, faithfully writing every time. Though he never opened the letters, even an outsider could see the sincerity in his heart.

Li Xizhi could see it clearly and sighed inwardly. He put the letter away and replied, "If the chance comes, I will certainly deliver it for you, senior."

Fei Yihe nodded. As he watched the cloudliner gradually descend, he finally couldn’t hold back and said quietly, "If one day... the Fei Family collapses... if it's within your power, I beg you to preserve at least one bloodline..."

Li Xizhi did not dare to promise, so he could only respond gently, "With Daoist Friend Qingyi cultivating in Yuanwu, your esteemed family will surely overcome adversity. The elders will also look after things. Please rest assured, senior..."

Fei Yihe nodded and said no more. After some time, Li Xuanfeng stepped inside, with his golden armor already removed. He spoke softly, "So, Xizhi, you’ve arrived."

Li Xuanfeng gave a slight nod and continued, "We’ll make our first stop in Xu State to meet the people of the Golden Feather Sect."

Li Xizhi followed him to the bow of the ship. A cold northern wind stirred gently. They had already crossed the great river that divided north and south. Waves churned, and the water current surged mightily.

Only after crossing the great river did the spiritual atmosphere completely change. The surroundings turned a dusky yellow-gray. The ground was dry and cracked, scattered with white bones. The air was filled with the lingering presence of blood and resentment.

Several escape lights streaked across the sky. When they saw the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner emerge, they all turned back. These people seemed experienced, after flying a short distance, they dived straight into the earth and vanished into the gray smoke.

Li Xizhi watched for a moment, then asked aloud, "Uncle, do you know how the conscription of the various families will be arranged?"

Li Xuanfeng’s armor had actually lost its spiritual glow back when the two True Monarchs, Pristine Water and Taiyuan, had taken action. Now it was little more than a few pieces of hanging metal and would require significant effort to repair.

Since his return was brief, he had yet to repair it and had already stored it away. Upon hearing Li Xizhi’s question, he answered, "Naturally, it won't be for us to handle. When the time comes, Dawn Cloudliner will arrive at various places to conscript cultivators. According to the sect’s directives..."

Li Xuanfeng paused, then continued, "As an initial precaution, forty-five percent of each family’s cultivators will be drafted to Mount Bianyan. If the fighting intensifies, more will be summoned..."

Li Xizhi listened in silence and softly said, "If forty-five percent of a family's cultivators are taken, it’s like breaking their bones... I had wondered how many of our family’s cultivators would be sent. Now it seems there’s no escaping it."

"Indeed." Li Xuanfeng stood quietly, then spoke after a while, "In the mountains, blades and spears spare no one, yet for small families, opportunities abound. Resources and dharma artifacts they normally couldn’t dream of, today, they can find them just by scavenging two corpses. Great chaos brings great opportunity."

The two chatted for a while, then a few people approached. Li Xizhi took a closer look. The leader wore a flowing dharma robe that shimmered with light. It was his brother-in-law, Yang Ruizao.

Just earlier on the ship, Yang Ruizao had gathered a few close Daoist friends. Several of them were at the Foundation Establishment Realm and now followed behind him, bowing respectfully toward Li Xuanfeng and saying, "Greetings, senior!"

Li Xuanfeng nodded in acknowledgment, asking each of their names in turn. Yang Ruizao stepped closer, and the three of them stood together at the bow of the ship, signaling unity in leadership aboard, with Li Xuanfeng at the head.

Yang Ruizao gave Li Xizhi a look and spoke softly, his tone tinged with helplessness, "You’ve met those younger ones from my family, right, Xizhi? What did you think?"

Li Xizhi smiled and nodded, replying, "Very polite and composed."

Though the words were praise, Yang Ruizao understood the subtext. He sighed and said, "Let’s hope they improve."

As they conversed, Mount Bianyan gradually came into view. The mountain lay at the center of Xu State's twenty-three southern cities. It was an ideal position for dispatching reinforcements in all directions. It was shrouded in white mist, giving off a faintly eerie atmosphere.

While the younger ones chatted, Li Xuanfeng grew absent-minded. He still vividly remembered these mountains and the Zhenhui Temple atop them. He had once come here with his uncle to capture a wolf demonic beast. By now, the place had likely fallen to ruin...

Xuanling... The name of his younger brother echoed in his heart, though his expression remained blank. Only Li Xizhi, behind him, seemed to notice something and glanced at him quietly.

Mount Qingdu.

While Li Xuanfeng and his party traveled north, another Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner descended at Moongaze Lake. It gleamed with the same soft, glowing hues, and was now resting atop Milin Mountain. The various households around the lake rushed to send representatives.

Cultivators bustled up and down Milin Mountain. Li Xijun stood atop the jade platform on the mountain's summit, gazing at the silently landed Dawn Cloudliner with a somewhat complicated expression. He thought to himself, Truth be told... this is the first time our family has hosted a Dawn Cloudliner. Though unexpected, it does mean we’re recognized as a voice of authority in the region.

He waited on the platform for a moment. Beside him stood Chen Donghe and An Zheyan, both at the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. On the other side were An Siming and An Siwei, who had also reached the same stage. The two brothers had just returned from the desert, so they were still dusty and travel-worn.

Li Xijun’s calculations back then hadn’t been wrong. Now, among the Li Family’s esteemed ones and core lineage, there were only seven late stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, and the An Family alone accounted for three. Even this year, the brothers' offspring had made breakthroughs in the Qi Cultivation Realm. The An bloodline was extraordinarily potent, it was something everyone knew.

Still, none had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. That said, the two brothers were unquestionably loyal, the type who followed orders without a word of complaint. This gave Li Xijun a measure of reassurance.

The Chen and An Families were the strongest. Lined up behind them were the Tian, Dou, and Xu Families. Further back stood Dili Youjie of Northern Mount Yue and Li Jiman and Shamoli of Eastern Mount Yue, off to the side. As for the surrendered tribes and families settled in Mount Yue, they didn’t even qualify to stand on the platform.

Shamoli was an elder of his family. He had been the first King of Eastern Mount Yue, rising to power after pledging allegiance to the Li Family. He practiced thunder arts and had even met Li Tongya. Thunder arts consumed lifespan, and the methods practiced by this old Mount Yue cultivator were far from orthodox. He aged faster than most and now stood in the back, eyes half-closed, saying nothing.

At the lake now, aside from the Li and Fei Families, only the small families from the eastern and northern shores remained. All greeted the Li Family respectfully. The Fei Family stood to the side, hesitant and uncertain.

After a short wait, a man in white robes flew down from the Dawn Cloudliner. Dressed in ornate garments with a splendid crown, he descended from the ship with a faint smile and presented a jade seal.

He parted his lips lightly and spoke, "By the immortal order of the sect, Yuanwu Peak’s period of governance has ended. Moongaze Lake and the eastern banks, including the Lixia Families, are henceforth placed under the jurisdiction of Moon Lake Peak!"

The crowd fell into a thunderous bow and responded in unison, "Greetings to the Emissary of the Immortal Sect!"

Good! As expected, it’s the Moon Lake Peak! thought Li Xijun.

Li Xijun led the response, but inwardly, he caught several layers of implication. Since the Xiao Family broke away and took most of Lixia Prefecture with them, the region had been fractured. Now, judging from the emissary’s words, what remained was to be carved off and attached to Moongaze Lake’s domain.

It wasn’t a trivial matter. Though it technically made Moongaze Lake’s territory larger, it wasn’t really good news. After all, with the Xiao Family nearby, these lands essentially belonged to them and were untouchable.

As Li Xijun was deep in thought, the white-robed cultivator descended from the clouds and came forward with a gentle smile, reaching out to help him up, speaking kindly, "My master is in seclusion, attempting a breakthrough and couldn’t come in person. I am Zhao Tinggui, first disciple of Moon Lake Peak. I’ve come on her behalf... No need for formality, Xijun!"

Naturally, the Peak Master in seclusion referred to Ning Wan. The two families were indeed close, and Zhao Tinggui carried himself with a humble demeanor, smiling as he urged Li Xijun to rise. Li Xijun didn’t dare be careless and returned the courtesy. Only then did Zhao Tinggui return to the ship above and speak softly, "My visit this time follows a sect order, we are to conscript cultivators."

His smile faded gradually, though his tone remained polite. He looked toward the surrounding minor families and said gently, "This military conscription concerns territories assigned to me and my fellow brothers at Moon Lake Peak. Our merit and lives are at stake. Do not think to fob me off with cultivators bearing various unrefined qi."

He paused for a moment, then said in a soft tone, "If I note which family’s disciples are too poor in quality, and return a few months later to conscript again, there will be blood."

Zhao Tinggui looked every bit the refined young gentleman, but his words were far from mild. Several nearby family heads exchanged nervous glances, all too frightened to speak. Zhao Tinggui went on, "If a family's disciples perform well and earn merit, I, too, will not withhold rewards. Not to mention, the battlefield offers great opportunities. You should put forth your most capable ones."

Watching the scene unfold, Li Xijun knew full well, though Zhao Tinggui seemed to be warning the minor families, his words were just as much meant for him. No matter how close their two families were, matters concerning life, death and merit couldn’t be taken lightly.

Just as that thought crossed his mind, a group of disciples in blue robes descended from the cloudliner. Zhao Tinggui waved his hand and said softly, "Each of you, bring your assigned people aboard."

Then he turned toward Li Xijun, came closer with great politeness, and extended a hand as white as jade, saying, "Xijun... let us discuss this thoroughly."

The two descended into the peak together and sat down in a grand hall built of white jade. After exchanging a few polite pleasantries, Zhao Tinggui casually said, "I wonder how many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators your esteemed family can spare?"

Li Xijun sighed and replied softly, "I'm sure you know, Tinggui... most of our seniors and brothers have likely already headed north..."

Zhao Tinggui couldn’t allow him to dodge so easily, thinking to himself, Sure, Li Xuanfeng and Li Xizhi are making contributions, but not on behalf of Moon Lake Peak! If I could secure even one of them, I wouldn’t have to worry about a thing. I could relax in the sect with peace of mind... Why would I need to come all this way otherwise?

He quickly raised a hand, his expression turning solemn as he said gravely, "Xijun, you’re a clever man, and our families are close. I won’t speak in circles with you."

Zhao Tinggui gently set down his teacup, "Elder Qinghong must be deployed... I don't know about others, but she might well rival our peak's core disciples. And being of the Thunder Dao lineage, she’s perfectly suited for a post of defense."

Li Xijun pondered for a moment and gave a slight nod. Zhao Tinggui paused briefly, then continued gently, "We’ll also need one mid-stage and one early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to establish a foothold first."

Zhao Tinggui had already made his calculations. Li Ximing of the Li Family was likely a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator and a rare alchemist. If he could bring him to the northern front, it would reduce casualties significantly...

Li Xijun thought for a while, then replied, "Reporting to the Emissary, my family has a buddhist guest cultivator, a Master Monk, whose strength more than equals a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. We also have a mid-stage demonic cultivator, though lacking lineage and spell arts, his combat power is at least equivalent to an early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator."

Zhao Tinggui showed brief surprise, then frowned and asked, "What of Daoist Ximing...?"

"He’s in seclusion, attempting a breakthrough. He won’t be available anytime soon..." Li Xijun gave a gentle excuse.

Zhao Tinggui sighed as he heard it, and could only say, "Very well, there’s no need to rush. Let’s proceed as you suggest for now. But if the front becomes critical, we may still need Daoist Ximing to act. If things truly become dire... we might even have to trouble you, Xijun..."

He agreed.

Li Xijun nodded politely and said, "Of course."

Zhao Tinggui acknowledged with a nod, then said with hesitation, "As for the Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, the Ning Family has already been assigned elsewhere. The main burden will fall upon your esteemed family..."

Though Li Xijun had anticipated this, unease still rose within him. He thought to himself, The Chi Family truly squeezes out every drop of value...

Among all the families, the Li Family had one of the largest pools of low-level cultivators. They were especially generous with outsiders, freely sharing cultivation methods. Li Xijun believed that Chi Zhiyun would undoubtedly be tempted by this and simply asked, "How many cultivators are required?"

Zhao Tinggui replied awkwardly, "Five late-stage, seven mid-stage, twenty-seven early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, and one hundred Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators... all must be of orthodox spiritual alignment..."

"What?!" exclaimed Li Xijun.
