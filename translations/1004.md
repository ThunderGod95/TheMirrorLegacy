# Chapter 1004: Mountain of Desire

Dawn broke, suffusing the world with brilliant radiance.

The splendor of the Supreme Yang touched the lakeshore. Bright lanterns lined a long avenue, and a wide, sea-patterned staircase descended to its end. Cultivators came and went, while carriages and swift horses traversed the road.

"Clop, clop, clop..."

The sound of hooves drew near, revealing a young man on horseback. He wore white robes, his cuffs embroidered with the rippling pattern of a crescent moon on a lake. His attire was not opulent, but his bearing was noble. A silk pouch hung from his waist. He reined in his horse, stopping before a massive gate.

This gate, known as Changxi Gate, was the entrance to Milin Prefecture. It stood twelve _zhang_ high, its seventy-two ridges gleaming with radiance, and it was covered in intricate carvings.

The Milin Mountains were the most renowned immortal mountains in the entire Moongaze Lake region. A market town lay at their feet. Though small and suffering from years of turmoil, the Changxi Gate, as the market's portal, connected the north and south and was of critical importance.

Li Suining reined in his horse. Just then, a caravan was passing under the gate. Upon seeing him, they immediately halted. An old man with the distinct features of the Eastern Yue people climbed down from a carriage. The rest of the caravan moved aside as he bowed respectfully.

"Greetings, Lord!"

The Eastern Yue had never held high status in the Yue State, and the lake region was no exception. Although this old man was a Qi Refining cultivator, which certainly meant he held a high position among his people, he still dared not block the path upon seeing Li Suining's robes. Unsure if the young man's surname was Li, he avoided calling him 'Young Master' and settled on 'Lord'.

A century of assimilation had left them little different from the other folk of the lake, save for being slightly hairier and having typical features. Li Suining simply asked, "Which Guest Retainer do you serve?"

The man was advanced in years, yet he knelt, planting his pale hands on the ground. He smiled deferentially.

"I wouldn't dare claim such a title, Lord! This lowly one is merely a guard, serving under the Jade Court. I am of the Eastern Yue people. I was fortunate enough to serve under the banner of the Grand Concord of Radiance and later followed the orders of Lord Minggong. My humble name is Du Dou."

Li Suining was taken aback for a moment. "Ah, so you served under my grand-uncle. You are being far too polite. Please, rise."

Li Suining actually had a decent impression of the Eastern Yue. Even now, many Eastern Yue practiced shamanistic traditions, and the one they worshipped was the Grand Concord of Radiance—who was, in fact, his own family's King Wei.

This wasn't hard to understand. First, when King Wei was young, his destiny was not yet concealed. His actions as the White Qilin overshadowed his personal identity, and his conquest of the Eastern Yue had seared the intense radiance of the Bright Yang into their memory. Second, it was a way for the Eastern Yue nobles to boast and elevate their own status.

But there were two sides to every coin. After Tingzhou fell, this group of Eastern Yue continued their worship in secret, refusing to change despite repeated warnings. The other surrendered clans couldn't cover for them forever. Eventually, the Shu General Ni Zan tore down their illicit temples and erected a skull mound from their remains.

"Guard, when you go up the mountain, please pass a message to my Eldest Grand-Uncle. Tell him Li Suining has finished his family visit and is waiting at the foot of the mountain to return to the lake with him!"

At this, the old man looked up, slightly stunned. He studied Li Suining closely for a second, then nodded respectfully, accepted the task, and departed.

'That spirit medicine the clan gave me worked wonders... To think I broke through to the sixth level of Embyronic Breathing in just half a month...'

Li Suining was now at the peak of the Embyronic Breathing realm. This cultivation speed was far faster than he had anticipated, and his mood soared.

'At this rate, by the time the Yang Clan establishes their state... my cultivation will be at the second or third level of Qi Refining. At the very least, I'll be able to fly, hold my own against minor cultivators, and construct some basic formations.'

He waited at the foot of the mountain for a short while before a streak of light shot toward him. It was Li Zhoufang!

The middle-aged man stroked his beard with a smile. Behind him followed a boy in simple robes, his head bowed. The old Eastern Yue man trailed at the very back. The three of them landed before the Changxi Gate, walked the nine paces to pass through it, and only then did Li Zhoufang laugh.

"Suining, you certainly got here quickly!"

'Li Chengzai sees I'm doing well now, so he forces a smile for me. I can't be bothered to humor him... Of course I came quickly! If I'd stayed to exchange even a few more pleasantries, he would have started asking to borrow cultivation resources!'

Li Suining sighed inwardly, merely smiling without a word. Li Zhoufang understood immediately and changed the subject, gesturing to the boy behind him. His face lit up with a pleased and surprised expression.

"Come! Meet this young man... This is the Pu Clan's genius, named Pu Xinya."

He then said with a serious expression, "The Pu Clan has a respectable heritage. I met with their family and inquired carefully. Pu Xinya is a rare talent, the likes of which they haven't seen in generations. This is truly a blessing for Moongaze, another stroke of good fortune!"

He then turned back to the boy, smiling. "Pu Xinya, this is Suining, our family's own once-in-a-century genius of the Dao of Formations. You should seek his guidance often!"

The boy bowed and said quickly, "Greetings, Young Master!"

Li Suining suppressed a smile and nodded. "No need for such formalities."

Pu Xinya had been his closest friend in his previous life; he knew him well. While his talent in the Dao of Formations was outstanding, his talent for cultivation was even more frightening. His cultivation speed had once kept pace with his own, and Li Suining had only managed to pull ahead after switching to a superior cultivation method. At this moment, that talent just hadn't yet been revealed.

Having spent so much time with him in his past life, Li Suining understood that Pu Xinya possessed both arrogance and ambition. He also carried that peculiar mindset of the lesser clans around the lake: envying the main family while simultaneously craving independence.

Later, this attitude had been discovered by the Old Lord. He was sent to Simin to manage a shop for two years. After seeing how the world truly worked, he returned much more subdued, understanding that beyond Moongaze Lake, the Pu Clan was nothing but a snack for the wolves. There was no other path than to climb higher within the Moongaze Lake hierarchy.

Right now, however, he was still full of pride. Li Suining didn't say much to him, turning instead to Li Zhoufang with a frown.

"Grand-Uncle, what is the situation with the Buddhist cultivators?"

"Hah! Who knows what that Way of Great Desire is plotting!"

At the mention of the Buddhist cultivators, Li Zhoufang's smile vanished, replaced by a grave expression.

"That Maha came through the Wilderness and arrived in Lixia Prefecture some days ago. There was no great slaughter, he didn't even enter the prefectural city. He just dispersed his Merciful Ones into the hills to establish their own temples. They preach their doctrines, sending followers down to spread their teachings. The common people are being swayed. They're all watching from the city, and many have already secretly changed into the robes of Buddhist cultivators..."

He sighed heavily.

"Worse, they've raised twelve great mountains outside the prefecture and planted what they call the 'Great Virtue Golden Lotus'. A hundred silver streams flow down from these mountains. When the common folk leave the city, they remove their shoes, roll up their trousers, and wade into the water. They instantly experience all kinds of bliss, forgetting their parents and siblings. We sent more than ten of our people to investigate. Five never returned."

"Jiangzong has given up on it. They're just pushing nearby rogue cultivators to scout from a distance. Word is, the mountains outside Lixia Prefecture have already transformed into 'Mountains of Desire.' Men and women lie together, naked, indulging in debauchery all night, completely lost to it..."

"Those few families there, the Wu and Lu clans... they've met with utter disaster. It's almost a blessing they were conquered before; many of their younger generation were conscripted by the Yang Clan, so at least some of their bloodline will survive."

The middle-aged man sighed. "Now... we hear the Way of Great Desire has passed this area and is heading south. We don't know what will happen next."

Li Suining sighed as he listened. In his past life, he had been in secluded cultivation and held a low status, so he hadn't known much about this incident as it happened. But he knew plenty about its aftermath. He silently confirmed the details in his mind.

'The Way of Great Desire... I heard they split from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm in ancient times. Although they also preach a Buddhist Land in the mortal world, their methods are vastly different. They proclaim: "A world without suffering _is_ the Buddhist Land." They don't require their followers to endure hardship to enter it; one must simply enjoy pleasure from birth until reincarnation. That 'Great Virtue Golden Lotus' absorbs all grief and pain. Down there, there is truly not a single trace of suffering...'

'What's even more absurd is that among the Seven Dao, the Way of Great Desire's population burns out the fastest, yet they are also the most fertile. Since all pain is taken away by the 'Great Virtue Golden Lotus', giving birth to a child is seen as bringing another soul into the world to enjoy bliss. It's an act of great merit. Everyone scrambles to do it, to the point they all wish they were women.'

But no matter how ridiculous it all was, he knew in his heart that once the Way of Great Desire left, this populace would become an unholy mess of debts that could never be settled.

'This disaster ravaged the entire northern Yue State. If the Song Emperor had tried to uproot the 'Great Virtue Golden Lotus', millions of people would have had their lifespans drastically cut, none living more than ten years. No wonder he had to seal the mountains and ban the rites, first cutting off the thing's influence, then issuing new Classics and spending years to slowly, meticulously untangle the hearts of the people.'

He thought it over carefully, calculating in his mind. 'By the time I came out of seclusion in my past life, this turmoil was more or less over. The family didn't suffer any major losses, so this matter shouldn't affect us. My priority is to see the Old Master.'

He stood within Li Zhoufang's transporting wind, and they quickly descended onto the island. But he saw the older man shake his head and smile.

"Let's not talk about that. You're running all over the island, how can you not have someone to run errands? What's more, you have to study the Dao of Formations, making your time even more precious. I have someone here—you've just met him, in fact. Let him serve you and handle your trivial tasks."

"The family has rules, of course. An attendant's cultivation usually can't be higher than the direct descendant's. But you're about to enter Qi Refining anyway, so it's not too soon!"

Seeing Du Dou prostrate himself on the ground and begin to kowtow in alarm, Li Suining frowned and was about to refuse, but then he heard Li Zhoufang's voice transmission:

'Just accept him. This was arranged by Aunt Minggong. Uncle Chengzai has no sense of propriety, and that crowd at the Eastern Residence is even more shameless. Du Dou has the Old Master's orders; he can block them for you. Otherwise, you'd have to refuse every one of them personally, which would damage your relationships with relatives.'

'She is very busy and couldn't wait for you, so she entrusted this matter to me.'

Li Suining's expression was complicated. He hadn't risen this quickly in his past life, so the benefits weren't as great, and Li Chengzai hadn't been able to bring himself to beg. Things were clearly different now. He had no choice but to cup his fists.

"Thank you, Grand-Uncle!"

With Du Dou leading the way, Li Zhoufang didn't need to escort him any further. Li Suining proceeded to a pavilion higher up the mountain. His gaze swept casually over the pavilion's rooms, but then his pupils contracted slightly.

A man in grey robes was hurrying up the steps. He reached the pavilion, knocked on a door with some trepidation, and only then stepped inside.

'Fourth Grand-Uncle...'

This man was precisely his Fourth Grand-Uncle, Li Zhouluo!

Li Suining's heart clenched.

'Was Fourth Grand-Uncle on the lake in my past life?'

This Fourth Grand-Uncle, Li Zhouluo, was no ordinary figure. He had been heavily favored by the Song Emperor. From the day the emperor ascended the throne, he was made Governor of the Capital. As the Li family declined, his position only grew higher. After King Wei died, Li Zhouluo, as King Wei's brother, was not ennobled, but he was at one point appointed Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, constantly attending His Majesty's side. His honor and favor were immense.

If this same Fourth Grand-Uncle Li Zhouluo hadn't repeatedly pleaded for mercy on the Li family's behalf, Li Suining wouldn't know what to feel facing him now. But even so, his emotions were incredibly complex.

'Perhaps... after Uncle Jiangchun died, this grand-uncle had no grandson left under his line. And since he was already the Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, attending the emperor, he was elevated to such a high position...'

Li Zhouluo's branch of the family played an extremely strange role in the grand scheme of things. Their elder, Li Xizhi of the "Four Xis," had made a move during the Changhe Rebellion. His Rainbow Glow technique had shocked the north and south, but he had vanished immediately after the great battle, never to be seen again.

And Li Zhouluo's father, Li Chenghuai, was someone he had only ever heard of but never met! Li Suining had never even considered this elder back then. The entire family had simply gotten used to the fact that he was wandering abroad and was never seen. Thinking back on it now, it was all too bizarre.

But it was undeniable that this Fourth Grand-Uncle had benefited greatly from King Wei and his own grandfather. When he was appointed Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, the imperial edict had contained, after all, this very sentence,

"His father and brother served with utmost sincerity, purging evil to bring peace to the prefectures."

'This Fourth Grand-Uncle... he must have a clue...'

His gaze darkened. He was roused from his thoughts by the courtyard guard in front of him, who blocked his path.

"The Old Master is currently meeting with someone. Please wait a moment, Young Master."

...

Inside the pavilion, the lamplight was dim. The old man, Li Xuanxuan, set down the scroll in his hand. He peered at the grey-robed man kneeling in the hall, seeming to recognize him with a start. He quickly raised his brows and descended from his seat to help him up.

Li Zhouluo was both flattered and uneasy. He allowed the old man to pull him to a seat at the side. Li Xuanxuan did not return to the main seat, but sat down close beside him. He grasped his hand and asked, "How are things now?"

When Li Zhouluo had returned to the lake all those years ago, he had been accompanying Li Jiangchun. Later, when the Azure Pond issued its summons, he had escorted Pang Yunqing back to Simin. Rushing back to the lake now was clearly a risk. He lowered his head, looking somewhat lost.

"I don't know what the situation is. The Azure Pond suddenly collapsed. Yunqing was assigned to a position in the mountains. I was worried about the clan, so I came back to check."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head, his voice aged. "Your grandfather left for Mount Duan fifteen or sixteen years ago. We had news for the first few years, but the letters became fewer. His last reply, five years ago, said he was entering seclusion to verify his Dao Lineage. We've had no news since... Has your grandmother written to you? Is there any word of your father?"

Li Zhouluo was at a loss for words. He left his seat and bowed. "She... she has sent a few letters. They just told me to cultivate diligently. And... grandmother's family offered me cultivation resources, but I declined them all. A few relatives from her side have sought me out occasionally, but only to offer some guidance on cultivation..."

Li Xuanxuan nodded. Li Zhouluo continued respectfully, "However, I received news from the south. That... Lord Yang... has granted me one or two territories. The location is excellent, in Simin..."

"This junior was thinking, it would be perfect to give to the family as a foothold. We could open a small market there, and it would count as extending our reach further south."

Li Xuanxuan drew his gaze back from him, took a sip of tea, and replied, "That's not right of you. Lord Yang bestowed that upon _you_. How can you just push it onto the clan? Besides Jiangliang, who serves directly under Lord Yang, no one else in the family has received such an honor. You must cherish it."

Li Zhouluo didn't know how to respond. Li Xuanxuan leaned in and asked in a low voice, "Is there any news from the south? How are we to deal with this surging karmic fire?"

Li Zhouluo immediately rose from the floor, his expression grave. "That Sparrow Carp Fish is about to reach Simin. No matter what, one of the great lords _must_ be making a move! The rumors in Simin are flying. In this junior's opinion, the Sparrow Carp Fish won't be rampant for much longer!"

"The family just needs to be careful. The moment the Sparrow Carp Fish retreats from Simin, we must seize the opportunity to reclaim our territory."

"Oh?"

The old man raised an eyebrow, studied him for a moment, and then smiled. "Is that what the Yang Clan intends?"

(Author's Note: I typo'd Sparrow Carp Fish (Que Li Yu) again. It always gets mixed up with Kong Li, and the more I look at it, the more natural it seems. I can never catch it in proofreading.)
