# Chapter 1203: Schemes and Preparations

The colors in the immortal pavilion wavered as the light of True Fire illuminated the snow-white jade walls, casting layers of dancing shadows; Li Ximing had just warmed the furnace when he suddenly heard a faint knock at the door, and with a final long sigh, he said:

"Come in!"

A youth in a crimson robe strode in and said respectfully:

"Forgive my intrusion, Great-granduncle."

"It is nothing."

Li Ximing shook his head, glanced at the various jade slips piled up like mountains on either side, and sighed:

"How much time has passed?"

Li Jiangqian's expression was slightly somber as he replied:

"Over a year and six months."

The Daoist Master heaved a heavy sigh and said:

"Since I obtained the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art, creating a formula has been a trivial matter, a unique feat in itself; it has been two years in total, and with the various pill formulas and secret essentials from the Chunyi Dao Gate to reference, I have finally devised an approach… though whether it will work remains to be seen."

A look of pleasant surprise appeared on Li Jiangqian's face as he nodded.

"Great-granduncle, your skill in alchemy is astounding..."

Li Ximing let out a laugh and said:

"You underestimate the Supreme Yin… Eighty to ninety percent of my work relied on the texts of the Chunyi Dao Gate. If not for those few pill formulas, forget two years, I might not have been able to formulate this even in twenty!"

He had been terrified of missing the deadline set by the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, racking his brain to the point of clear mental and physical exhaustion. Heaving a long sigh, he said:

"It is done now, and I can begin the refinement… The spiritual resource I sent you to trade for…"

"The Lesser Yin nourishing item you requested, Great-granduncle, has been retrieved."

Li Jiangqian nodded, took a small bottle from his sleeve, and said:

"This is the Lesser Yin spiritual resource, the ‘Vastwater of Auspice,’ acquired from the Shangguan family in exchange for ‘Neck Feathers’ through an agent of Qusi; the other party was adamant, so we had to offer two portions of ‘Neck Feathers,’ only succeeding out of deference to Qusi, for if they had known the Li family was involved, I fear they would not have dared to trade at all."

Li Ximing took it and saw within a clear, rich restorative essence, nodding with a pleased expression:

"With the ‘Pristine Water’ obtained from Situ Huo, the ingredients are now complete. I can begin refining the pill."

Li Jiangqian nodded, his expression growing slightly somber as he said in a serious tone:

"There is a matter I must report to you, Great-granduncle."

He took a jade slip from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing. The Daoist Master read it briefly and said in surprise:

"They truly chose the Lesser Yang Grand Formation!"

Li Jiangqian nodded and said with feeling:

"Senior Liu is truly a genius; with such ingenuity and his cultivation of a profound lineage that has all but vanished from the world, I estimated he would need two years, but in a mere fifteen months, this Daoist Master has already provided a concrete plan and even sent over diagrams for several crucial formation nodes."

"Only the most important formation plate remains, which is the most troublesome part; Senior Liu is studying it slowly in the Eastern Sea, while our family can immediately start building the formation's foundation—this is a massive undertaking, and the sooner we start, the better, for as long as the general framework is correct, minor adjustments later will be quick."

"And he has listed the several types of spiritual items that can be used for the formation plate."

Liu Changdie's choice of the Lesser Yang Grand Formation was both expected and reasonable; the only surprise was the World's Navel, which made Li Ximing shake his head inwardly:

'The World's Navel has no intention of accepting everything wholesale; they are still being selective, but for what supreme treasure they are refining, I cannot say.'

The World's Navel was a Daoist tradition that kept to itself, and the Valley Water Matriarch enjoyed being hidden; the world knew of her existence, but never saw her manipulate events, to the point that even Luoxia and the Underworld rarely mentioned her. Li Jiangqian voiced his suspicion:

"Could someone be attempting to attain the Lesser Yang position? That Dao lineage has two True Monarchs above it; Northern Lesser Yang is one thing, but the Western Lesser Yang is a demon monarch known throughout the world… Furthermore, given the attitude of the world's major powers, the tenacity of the Lesser Yang position is likely no less than that of the Bright Yang."

Li Ximing fell silent in thought. Li Jiangqian's eyes shifted, and a thought quickly came to him:

However, of the three major powers in the world, not one can stand the sight of the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch. The Dragon-kin carved away his authority to take their seat in the Xiyang position, Luoxia resents him for seizing the Dao-fruit of the departed Immortal Lord, and the Underworld considers him a thorn in its side. Adding the two True Monarchs in Auxiliary Positions, I fear all of them wish for His death. In that sense, the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch has offended no fewer people than the Bright Yang Imperial Monarch. The Bright Yang Imperial Monarch has treated the world as his flock for many years; who is to say that in the shadows, the Lesser Yang is not also being repeatedly tested by those who wish to see him gone! It is only because the Bright Yang entered the mortal realm with such fanfare that his actions are known to lesser cultivators.

This made Li Ximing nod in understanding.

"No wonder… No wonder the north and south have tacitly allowed the Western Lesser Yang to extend his reach. It could be they are pushing the master of the White Victory Dao to seek the ‘Lesser Yang’ position, or perhaps for Xiyan to take the primary seat."

He assessed the situation and clicked his tongue, unaware of how turbulent the undercurrents were. He only unfurled Liu Changdie's scroll and listened to Li Jiangqian speak.

The grand formation Liu Changdie designed was called the "Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil Spirit Formation." Its concept was peculiar, intending to use the Western Mountains as its foundation to conceal spiritual energy and gather malevolence. For the formation's base, this meant driving the profound foundation into the Western Mountains and hiding the "Trinary Yang Annual Radiance" within the mountain's core.

The mysteries within were extremely complex, and Li Jiangqian, being unskilled in formations, did not fully understand them. He spoke of two main benefits: first, it would sever any connection to the Great Void, making the foundation exceptionally stable and producing unexpected results. Second… Liu Changdie intended to use the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance's ability to transform into Lesser Yang baleful qi to have it erupt suddenly and ambush anyone who tried to break the formation!

This immediately made the youth sit up straight with interest.

"If the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance were to enter one's body, it would be comparable to the Wu Earth calamity. Apart from figures on the level of Father, it would almost certainly ruin one's Dharma Body… If we had such a hidden card… it would provide another escape route."

Whether to unleash it against an enemy when all else failed or to shatter the formation in an emergency when the lake's defenses were empty, it was an excellent option. Li Jiangqian felt no sense of loss—if the family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators could not be protected, then even a mountain of spiritual items was useless. This one function alone was enough to greatly move him.

Li Ximing nodded in satisfaction. Li Jiangqian's expression finally turned solemn as he handed over an item from his sleeve; it was a secret letter from Liu Changdie, with only a few words, but they made the color drain from Li Ximing's face.

'Fuxun trusted Tuodu and was devoured by a Dragon King of the Lesser Yang path who possesses four divine abilities... The visitor used a divine ability to deceive Fuxun, tricking him into consuming a pill and entering a reef to be eaten, until all his flesh was gone and his marrow withered, leaving only a skeleton behind, with a final wish to be buried on Three Delusions Mountain in the Western Sea...'

'What kind of person has come!'

Liu Changdie's writing was calm, yet it betrayed an extremely unusual emotion. The shock on Li Ximing's face was indescribable; in an instant, the Demon King's once-forthright words flashed through his mind, and his feelings grew complicated.

'He was a Demon King at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm! Eaten just like that!'

This was clearly beyond Li Ximing's expectations—Lu Xu had given his guarantee. This Demon King was, after all, a favored subordinate of the Dragon King. Moreover, he deeply understood what kind of existence Fuxun had become.

'There's that demonic, ghostly thing on Fuxun's body!'

He exchanged a look with Li Jiangqian, both seeing the gravity in the other's eyes. Li Ximing put down the letter and said in a low voice:

"This Tuodu… is a demon beast from the Si Sea. I have some familiarity with him. Looking at it now, I'm afraid he must be one of the Dragon-kin."

Li Jiangqian had clearly considered this already and said in a grave tone:

"The Dragon-kin each have their own seas to shepherd, and every Dragon King values his own retainers greatly; they would not easily cross boundaries to extend their reach into another's territory… This junior believes that this person is very likely the Si Sea Dragon King!"

He pondered aloud:

"Since Lu Xu gave us his promise, it's unlikely he would go back on his word… Fuxun himself was an excellent medicinal ingredient. I fear he was careless in his associations, and this Si Sea Dragon King learned of him and secretly devoured him. Either he is used to acting tyrannically, or he is privately at odds with Dragon King Beihai and decided to snatch the meal from his plate!"

"And he cultivates 'Lesser Yang'."

Li Ximing added, speaking with apprehension:

"How could this be a coincidence? Since that Demon King was possessed by a demon, and it was eaten, how could there be a good outcome… Could it be… that this was a plot against the Si Sea Dragon King from the very beginning!"

Li Jiangqian paced back and forth, hands clasped behind his back, and questioned:

"Since it's a scheme from the White Victory Dao, does that mean… the Western Lesser Yang?"

A single demon was terrifying enough, but now the scheme involved a Lesser Yang Dragon King with four divine abilities. The two looked at each other, understanding that this matter had become far too serious. Li Ximing said anxiously:

"If something happens to that Dragon King, a scapegoat will be needed no matter what. If this comes to light one day, our family might not be blamed, but I fear Senior Liu will not be able to protect his own life!"

Li Jiangqian was silent for a moment, then said:

"He's even thinking about being 'buried on Three Delusions Mountain in the Western Sea'! I thought he would want to be sent back to his homeland in the Suopo Kingdom."

The Daoist Master shook his head with some regret and said:

"The two of them shared a deep bond, I know something of it. Three Delusions Mountain is where Fuxun and Qingyan originated, somewhere in the Western Sea. It's likely not a place of any renowned background. Besides, the Suopo Kingdom has been occupied by others now, so how could he possibly return?"

Since it was confirmed Fuxun had no one backing him, the youth did not reply. Li Ximing considered for a moment, then gritted his teeth and said:

"This is not a promise easily made… It's a huge problem! Thinking about it another way, what if that demon wasn't eaten by the Dragon King and is still attached to the skeleton? If he remains on the island and something happens, I fear a life-or-death calamity will follow…"

Li Jiangqian generally understood his meaning. After a moment of deliberation, he replied:

"I believe this is a struggle between great powers. Those who can see this layer of scheming can also see that these are just moves on a board. It would be unwise for us to react too strongly and let the Dragon-kin know we've seen through them… that would only stir up trouble… We should just react as we normally would."

The junior continued:

"In this matter, our family has been wronged. Their side broke their promise, so we should demand compensation. If Senior Liu were to truly abandon the island, his tracks would be exposed, and wouldn't the truth be obvious to all? In my opinion, it is best to let matters develop on their own."

He sensed that the elder before him intended to try and protect his old friend and became highly alert, speaking up:

"If something truly happens, our family will not be able to protect him, just as he could not protect Fuxun."

Li Ximing was quiet for a moment before asking:

"What is your meaning?"

Li Jiangqian said with a serious expression:

"Reply to his letter, saying only that the lake sends its deepest condolences and has already gone to question Lu Xu. Do not mention how to handle the remains or what arrangements to make. We will first observe Dragon King Beihai's reaction."

Li Jiangqian paused, then continued:

"There is no need for you to reply, Great-granduncle. Under the pretext of your alchemy, I will write back to him."

This approach was relatively gentle. Li Ximing sighed and nodded, his face etched with worry.

"The schemes of the world are truly too deep. Survival is but a matter of being soft-hearted or hard-hearted in a single moment. We can only do our best."

With the matter settled, Li Jiangqian finally breathed a sigh of relief and said:

"There have been many disturbances these past few days, and I have dealt with them one by one. However, there is one matter I have been thinking about for some time and must discuss with you in advance, Great-granduncle."

A hint of doubt appeared on Li Ximing's face as he listened to Li Jiangqian speak:

"The war on the Great Western Plateau has been pacified. Half of the cities that once belonged to the Sword Gate are now in the hands of Western Shu. I hear the master of the White Victory Dao has entered seclusion to seek a breakthrough, and Qing Jifang returned after a minor defeat, quite displeased… In my judgment, they may be about to invade Zhao."

Li Ximing was deep in thought as he listened.

"Qi Lanyan has just fallen, the Buddhists are in disarray, the Helian family has suffered one death and one injury, the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao has greatly curtailed its activities, and the loss of Jianghuai is enough to tie down the Central Plains and the Valiant King… Guanlong can only rely on its own strength. Western Shu will surely attack."

The eyes of the crimson-robed youth gleamed as he said:

"This is an excellent opportunity—has Great-granduncle considered whether Western Shu knows we are building a formation here? Will the Qing clan allow our family to erect a barrier that greatly reduces their ability to threaten the Song State from Moongaze Lake at any time?"

Li Ximing's expression changed abruptly. He stood up and said grimly:

"You are talking about… Qing Jifang!"

"Precisely!"

A dark glint flickered in Li Jiangqian's eyes.

"My sister and I once discussed whether to establish the mystic realm first or the grand formation first, and I insisted on the latter. At this moment, Western Shu has no time for other matters, so it's the perfect time for us to build the formation. Once their hands are free, with Qing Jifang's vengeful nature, how could he stand by and watch us erect a Purple Mansion Realm grand formation in the great desert? The entire world knows that Father cannot act right now!"

"In as little as two or three years, or as long as four or five, there will be a result between Shu and Zhao. If Qing Jifang loses, it will be easier to deal with, but if he wins…"

Li Jiangqian's gaze was grim.

"If I were him, I would certainly leverage the momentum of a great victory to uproot our formation's foundation in the desert. Not only that, but under the guise of a battle between Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, I would do my best to destroy or disrupt all the spiritual veins in the desert, delaying our plan to defend against the west by thirty to fifty years… This would absolutely give Western Shu a strategic breakthrough!"

"By the time we get our next chance to breathe, who knows when that will be. It is more likely the Qing clan will force us to set up any future formation on the western shore, unable to repel the enemy beyond the lake, and instead forcing the great battle to be fought upon the lake itself!"

"Indeed…"

Li Ximing pondered for a moment and nodded, a slight chill running down his spine.

"If you put it that way… I'm afraid there isn't much time left!"

Li Jiangqian said with a heavy expression:

"All of the family's manpower has already been mobilized by me, with the construction of the formation's foundation as the highest priority. As for Helian Wumeng's two Spiritual Artifacts, I have secretly asked Situ Huo about them. He cultivates the art of Metal Malice and has a great fondness for Baleful Qi, so he will surely be tempted… Even if he squeezes us on the value, we must gather the materials for the formation plate in a short time and hasten its refinement."

A sharp glint appeared in his eyes as he said:

"But even with such urgency, refining the formation plate is not a matter of one or two years. If Shu and Zhao determine a victor in two or three years, I fear there will be another great battle upon the desert!"

Li Ximing's expression grew progressively uglier.

"It all depends on just how ruthless… Qing Jifang is!"

"Not just him!"

A cold sneer rose in Li Jiangqian's eyes as he answered:

"Shu will come with overwhelming force, but support from Song will not necessarily be swift. Tinglan and Qiuhu go without saying, and Daoist Master Chen will also do his best, but the same cannot be said for others. Yang Ruiyi is no longer in charge, and an excuse like being in seclusion or away from the country is not hard to find. After all, our family did not give them any prior notice… How could they be waiting in their own territory at all times? Some excuses will be real, some fake, and it can't really be considered an offense."

"This junior believes… that when the time comes, there will be no shortage of people fanning the flames and using the opportunity to interfere or test the extent of Father's injuries. If we do not use this chance to contact various cultivators, on one hand exchanging favors and spiritual resources for the swift aid of the nearest divine ability cultivators in Jianghuai, and on the other hand applying pressure and warnings in advance, our family will surely suffer a great fall here—it would not be surprising for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to perish!"

Within his dark eyes, a golden light shimmered, tinged with a faint crimson hue.

"If our calculations are off by even a fraction, our family will pay the price in blood!"
