# Chapter 902: Wujiang

The vast waters of the Chengshui Marsh stretched endlessly, lined with forests of towering cedar. The surface was a mirror of tranquil azure, a stark contrast to the scenery of a typical lake. Li Ximing moved forward, treading upon the Heavenly Light, yet he remained utterly silent, his own form indistinct.

After flying for more than ten li, he was surprised to see more and more cultivators. All of them had their heads bowed, scouring the area for something. In the distance, he spotted a small grotto in the water, near which stood several pavilions, guarded by another group of cultivators. One sweep of Li Ximing's spiritual sense was enough to detect the powerful and unusual water veins flowing far beneath.

His elder, Li Qinghong, had mentioned this place. She had said it was a rare channel where earth veins and water veins merged, running uninterrupted all the way to the Eastern Sea and connecting to the maritime border of the Chunyi Dao Gate. Based on the current scene, it was clear the Chengyun Gate had taken control of it.

What gave him pause, however, was not the location's significance. It was a purple-red fragment of a dharma artifact, smooth and sharp-edged, that the cultivators below were fiercely fighting to possess. Li Ximing's eyes narrowed. With a light flick of his sleeve...

...a fierce wind howled. The Heavenly Light blazed down, blinding the cultivators below. In that instant, the fragment shot upward, landing in Li Ximing's hand as he hovered high above the clouds.

It looked familiar. On closer inspection, he realized it must have come from a large, purple-red cauldron. Judging by the intricate patterns and the fineness of the shard, the original item must have shattered into hundreds, if not thousands, of pieces, scattered far and wide...

'That's right, it was from Yu Yuwei. A bronze cauldron, marked by the Touba, which fell into my hands. I gave it to Li Quantao... No wonder hundreds of cultivators are gathered here searching. It's a fragment of a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, after all. Even a small piece is worth a significant amount.'

Yu Yuwei had been killed by the Chunyi Dao Gate. The cauldron ended up with Qiuxin, who eventually presented it to Li Ximing. The Yu family was in complete disarray, posing no threat, and the artifact ultimately benefited Li Quantao. Because it had passed through his own hands, the memory was still fresh. This was, without a doubt, that same cauldron.

This cauldron was a Yu family heirloom, made from high-quality materials. Back then, it had taken a direct hit from an ancient Touba dharma artifact and escaped with only a single mark. To shatter it this completely... the power required must have been far beyond the Foundation Establishment Realm.

His brow furrowed. A sense of unease settled over him.

'Was Li Quantao truly recalled so urgently? He returned to the sect, yet he hasn't sent a single letter...'

The tasks arranged by Ning Wan and Tinglan had subtly pointed toward the Hongxue Gate. Back then, Jiangbei was in chaos. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition could barely fend for itself, let alone send aid. It wouldn't have been surprising if Li Quantao had fallen in battle; there would be no reason to hide it. But the official story was a recall, and now he's vanished. That is... suspicious.

'If he isn't in seclusion recovering from grave injuries, then Azure Pond must have truly stumbled upon some great opportunity. Ning Wan is preoccupied with the north and has no energy for these games. This whole situation... I can't tell who's truly benefiting from it!'

If Li Quantao truly did find an opportunity, Ning Wan would likely be reasonable and not take any drastic measures. But from Li Quantao's perspective... a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator can't be everywhere at once. Wouldn't it be better to keep the spoils for himself? Li Ximing shook his head with a wry smile. He casually tossed the fragment back down and ascended on his light.

He had only been flying for a short while when the jade talisman at his waist began to pulse with warmth—a sign that an ally was near. Li Ximing paused, slightly surprised. He released the Divine Ability that was sealing it. The water below rippled as a figure approached, riding the wind.

The man's face was ordinary enough, but his black robes were covered in a dense, unsettling pattern of eyeball-like objects. This gruesome attire lent his otherwise normal features a sinister, heretical air. Li Ximing recognized the garment instantly. He took a cautious step back and spoke:

"Daoist Luo!"

This was indeed Daoist Master Luo, the native Daoist Master from the shamanic kingdoms of the Southern Borderlands who had fought alongside him in the rescue mission!

The Daoist Master smiled and moved to greet him.

"Daoist Zhaojing! It has been a long time!"

He was originally one of the Eastern Yue people, and his real name was likely as uncouth as Jiao Zhongzi or Fu Daomu. His name just happened to start with the character 'Luo,' so to curry favor with the Supreme Yang cultivators, he claimed it as his surname. His face was a mask of smiles as he continued:

"I received word from Daoist Ning. I've just come from the Tangdao Mountains, riding the wind to assist you!"

The pieces clicked into place for Li Ximing.

'Kui Qi has to travel with the Chunyi Dao Gate. Setting aside their shared Supreme Yang origins, they are, at least, proper, orthodox cultivators. They couldn't possibly bring this man along. The Chunyi Dao Gate would probably draw their swords on sight...

'Tinglan likely has her own reinforcements, so he'd be unwelcome there too. My task is here at Caishan, and we *have* met before, so they decided to push him onto me...

'They should have told me about this, but we were interrupted by Zhusheng. It wouldn't have been appropriate to discuss such... arrangements... in front of him. So they had to drop it.'

Kui Qi might be from Xiukui, and he carried himself with a certain reserved pride, but his mind was clearly sharp. This was a time to rally all available strength, and he had made his arrangements well.

Despite the signal from the jade talisman, Li Ximing remained wary of the man. He asked:

"That alone isn't proof."

Daoist Master Luo laughed, completely unfazed.

"I already asked Lord Kui Qi about this. He gave me this jade talisman, predicting you wouldn't trust me!"

He made an inviting gesture and smiled. A wisp of purple qi descended from the Great Void, coalescing into a purple-robed female immortal. Her face was lovely, with bright eyes and a delicate oval shape—he knew at once it was a projection of Tinglan.

"My thanks for your trouble, Daoist."

She gently proffered a stone box. Maintaining the projection this far had clearly been a strain; she nodded once and dissipated. Li Ximing watched her go. Tinglan's face had been smiling, but he had seen the worry hidden in her eyes.

The stone box was heavy in his hand. He didn't need to guess; even through the stone, Li Ximing could feel the familiar, comforting power of Bright Yang.

'The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!'

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass was one of Xiukui's greatest treasures. Anyone who cultivated the path of Bright Yang would recognize it instantly. Li Ximing immersed his spiritual sense into the box and confirmed it: there lay the golden-white compass.

He discreetly slipped it into his sleeve, his mind already weighing the implications.

'Strange... Kan Ziyu's breakthrough must have been too sudden for her to retrieve it in time. Still, getting it now... it's not too late!'

Li Ximing secured the item, feeling a measure of relief.

'This Daoist Master Luo is, at worst, an expert with two Divine Abilities. Even if he's prone to holding back, he's still a significant asset. This provides some peace of mind...'

He joined Daoist Master Luo in the Great Void, where they found a place to rest. While making idle conversation, Li Ximing discreetly activated his arts to observe Caishan from a distance.

His high vantage point swept across the mountain range, revealing everything. There were only four Golden Bodies present and no one else. Nothing to fear.

However, after the last major defeat, the weaker Buddhist cultivators from the Way of Emptiness had either perished or been forced to restart their cultivation. Of the four present, two were at least at the Developing Wisdom level and wielded Treasured Artifacts. One of the four, however, looked different. He appeared to be an ordinary man, lacking the massive Golden Body of his companions, yet the other three treated him with profound respect.

Even so, two of them were clearly mediocre. For both Li Ximing and Daoist Master Luo to act together seemed like overkill.

'Against this pitiful lineup, sending Luo alone would have been sufficient. He might not have been able to defeat all four, but he could have easily stalled them!'

'With both of us here, forget stalling—even killing a few of them will be easy!'

He relaxed immediately and exchanged a few pleasantries with Luo. Unexpectedly, the man's demeanor shifted, and he clasped his hands formally.

"I must sincerely implore Daoist Zhaojing to give his all this time. It would be best if we can eliminate them... The truth is... I absolutely cannot miss this opportunity!"

This was not the kind of thing he expected Luo to say. Li Ximing was momentarily stunned. Before he could respond, the demonic cultivator had seized the initiative, his expression grave, his tone almost pleading.

"I didn't have the qualifications to enter that True Qi Anhuai Heaven. I have sought a certain cultivation art for many years, and only found a lead through Daoist Ning. After I helped last time, I finally received concrete news—the art is of even higher quality than I had hoped. If I miss this... I may never even get the chance to touch the threshold of the Purple Mystery in this lifetime!"

He had already cultivated two Divine Abilities. This art was likely the key he needed to touch the threshold of the Purple Mystery, and he needed to secure it soon to have enough time for the subsequent cultivation. The opportunity was clearly precious. Li Ximing, however, was in no rush. He simply asked:

"What path do you cultivate, Daoist?"

Daoist Master Luo replied hastily:

"It is an obscure Daoist tradition... called 'Gathering Wood.' It has little reputation nowadays. You must think it laughable."

"'Gathering Wood'..."

It was indeed a rare path. Most Wood-aspect cultivators were in the north. As Li Ximing mused on this, the demonic cultivator, eager to curry favor, quickly added with a smile:

"The 'Ji' character means 'to gather'—it depicts birds (隹) on a tree (木). It signifies cultivators assembling, like a flock of birds coming to roost. It was once a very broad Daoist tradition with many followers, though it has fallen into obscurity. Fortunately, it is quite harmonious with the Three Yang paths. There should be ample opportunity for cooperation in the future!"

He wasn't wrong, but Li Ximing had no intention of getting too close to him. He said little more. Several days passed in a flash. When the jade talismans at their waists lit up in unison, they nodded to each other and exited the Great Void.

The sky was gloomy. Dark clouds massed in the north, and the sea of clouds above roiled like a violent ocean, as if some colossal beast were swimming within. Li Ximing's brows twitched, an inexplicable sense of unease creeping into his heart.

'This is not a good omen... Has something happened in the north...?'

But the arrow was already nocked; he had to act. Li Ximing stepped forward, channeling his Divine Ability as he roared:

"Strike!"

Radiant Heavenly Light instantly descended. Colorful clouds above Caishan roiled and vanished. The Buddhist cultivators lacked conventional spiritual arrays; their formations always used the Merciful Ones themselves as nexuses to channel the light of the Buddhist Land. They excelled at surrounding and overwhelming their foes.

Thus, before any Divine Ability even manifested, the sprawling complex of temples—layered high and low across the mountain like thick moss—began to tremble. Sand and stone poured from their structures. Amidst a rolling cloud of gray dust, they collapsed.

A brilliant white Celestial Gate descended from the heavens. Unfortunately, the four Merciful Ones were not grouped together. The blazing Divine Ability slammed down, instantly suppressing two of the rising Golden Bodies. The remaining two stared in shock. One cried out in terror:

"'Audience with the Celestial Gate'!"

The other, the one who looked like a mortal, showed no fear, only rage. He cursed:

"You jackal! How dare you!"

But they had no time to react. Billowing, dark green smoke erupted from the mountain, appearing even thicker under the brilliant light. Daoist Master Luo, draped in his thousand-eyed demonic robe, stepped out of the air. He held a bladed dharma artifact and grinned with malevolence.

"Shavelings!"

He raised his hand and tossed out a flask. It flashed with light, and a pale white water splashed out, instantly dispersing the smoke and calming the spiritual winds. As the light faded, black qi surged forth, entangling the two Golden Bodies.

He fought with the typical abandon of a demonic cultivator, black qi rolling everywhere, which made even Li Ximing's expression darken. The demon, however, showed no restraint. The flask's power seemed weak and clearly wouldn't hold for long. After briefly binding the two, he thrust one hand downward in a lifting motion.

Immediately, two beams of jade-green light emerged from the mist. One was clear and light as wind, floating dozens of feet high; the other was heavy and turbid as earth, slithering along the ground. Daoist Master Luo stomped his foot, shaking the very mountain, and laughed.

"Rise!"

The ground-level beam of light drilled into the earth. In an instant, tendrils of green light surged up from the sand, sprouting and flourishing, transforming the entire area into a sparkling, jade-green sea.

The Merciful Ones' Golden Bodies wavered, emitting a discordant clamor, a sign that their concentration was broken. Their expressions turned grim; they were clearly trapped for the moment.

Neither of them was a stranger to fighting the Merciful Ones. These Buddhist cultivators had simplistic methods and were vulnerable to specialized arts. Suppress them from the start, and they rarely recovered. But seeing Daoist Master Luo's true power, Li Ximing cursed inwardly:

'What kind of art *is* that? Last time we fought... he was clearly holding back. Massively. The moment his own profit is on the line, he finally gets serious...'

He cursed, but his actions were swift. His own skillset might be limited, but it was devastatingly effective against Buddhist cultivators, striking them where it hurt most. He spat a stream of fire and channeled his Divine Ability.

But Li Ximing observed them closely. The Buddhist cultivators below were flustered, yes, but not truly panicked. There was an unsettling calm about them as they used their Golden Bodies to resist. The hatred and malice in their eyes and curses were far stronger than their fear.

The unease in his heart grew. He hesitated for a fraction of a second before drawing Reveal River and merging his form with the flames.

The cultivator Li Ximing was suppressing was mediocre, so he had no trouble. But just as Daoist Master Luo's art trapped the other two, the mortal-looking leader's expression changed, and he sucked in a sharp breath.

His 'treasure belly,' which he cradled with one hand, suddenly expanded as if being inflated. In an instant, it was the size of a house, and he broke free from the jade sea. It swelled twice more, and a brilliant light bulged from the center of the jade-white stomach. From within that light, two naked Arhats leaped out.

The Arhats were majestic and powerful, with clearly defined muscles. One held a staff, the other a sword. They wore necklaces of black beads and rode on brilliant light as they lunged at Daoist Master Luo.

"The Way of Compassion!"

Daoist Master Luo's expression turned foul. He flicked his sleeves, and rolling, blue-black qi surged up, flowing back into his robes as he shouted:

"Go!"

The two streams of blue-black qi shot out like chains, binding the Arhats. But the Treasure Light flared, and the qi sizzled and burned. Worse, as the Arhats broke free, the Buddhist cultivator's large belly deflated, though it remained the size of a man. He rose on the wind, gently rubbing the jade-white surface. The skin bulged, and a face—two eyes and a mouth—opened upon it!

The two eyes glowed with a purple light and simultaneously shot out a blinding, majestic radiance—a power to vanquish demons—that seared straight toward the demonic cultivator.

But Daoist Master Luo was no pushover. He shook his robes, and all thousand eyes upon it released their own dazzling golden glare, scattering the purple radiance. The demonic cultivator's expression was grim as he snarled:

"The Way of Compassion again! This old master's spirit robe was refined specifically to counter your kind!"

But the advantage was short-lived. In the time it took to exchange those two blows, the Developing Wisdom-level Merciful One on the ground had broken free, neutralizing the white water, and was rising on the wind.

"Fiend!"

Daoist Master Luo, possessing two Divine Abilities, was not afraid. On the contrary, he was inwardly gleeful:

'I can just stall these two. Can they wound me? Kill me? I doubt it. But over on Li Ximing's side... how long can *you* lot possibly stall *him*?'

The two monks' decision was undoubtedly correct. Li Ximing's Divine Abilities might not have been overwhelmingly superior, but his power to sever their connection to the Buddhist Land was far more decisive. The demonic cultivator battled the Buddhist cultivators, and the fight escalated. Golden light rippled, blue-gray qi scattered, and his demonic robes billowed. The sky grew darker. He was just getting warmed up, not yet sated, when the sound of shattering glass echoed.

*BOOM!*

A pink light burst forth within the Bright Yang radiance, and a rain of flower petals drifted down. The sky darkened rapidly. From within the raging True Fire, Li Ximing drew his axe, having already struck a killing blow against one of his opponents.

Without Immeasurable Water and Fire, dealing with two opponents was not as easy as it had been during the Tangdao victory. Li Ximing focused on killing one first. As the monk perished, an endless pink light erupted, causing the Audience with the Celestial Gate to shudder.

The other monk was ready. He thrust his four arms upward, using the shockwave of his companion's demise to heave against the Celestial Gate, shaking it. The Golden Body's face was twisted in a ferocious snarl, its lips barely moving:

'Fiend, prepare to die!'

Buddhist cultivators could indeed reincarnate, but the loss of a Dharma Body was always a grievous blow. The more fearlessly this one acted, the more uneasy Li Ximing became. But he couldn't let him escape. Li Ximing formed a hand seal. Instantly, four ribbons of bright white light appeared, wrapping tightly around the Golden Body and binding it.

'Radiant Celestial Wave Art!'

The Heavenly Light at his brow flared as he locked on with Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light.

But before the brilliant Heavenly Light could be unleashed, a profound chill seized his heart, like a blade pressed to his back. Without hesitation, he aborted Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. His form vanished, and he reappeared, sitting cross-legged atop the Celestial Gate itself.

*Om...*

As the white-gold-robed figure settled down from the void, a wave of Heavenly Light rippled outward. It swept through the layered clouds, bringing a pulse of brilliance to the gloomy sky, and seemed to touch something unseen, eliciting a subtle hum.

This defensive move cost him the perfect moment to strike, almost allowing the monk to escape. Fortunately, his opponent was not strong. Reveal River faltered, and the Radiant Celestial Wave Art snapped, but it was enough to keep him imprisoned. Li Ximing pushed his Divine Ability to its limit, barely managing to pin the man beneath the gate, immobilizing him.

But Li Ximing, sitting cross-legged, paid no attention to the trapped monk. He took a deep breath, shifted his Divine Abilities, and recalled his True Fire. He faced the sky, staring silently at the dark clouds, his pupils wide.

Amidst the gloomy clouds stood a man.

He was remarkably handsome, appearing to be in his thirties or forties, with the high-bridged nose and deep-set eyes characteristic of the Mobei northern deserts. His expression was stern and cold as he stood with his hands clasped behind his back.

The man wore black and silver armor, an outer robe fluttering in the wind. Three weapons hung at his waist, perfectly aligned: a long sword, a short blade, and a dharma whip, all glowing faintly.

Faint traces of a movement Divine Ability's light, not yet fully dissipated, shimmered behind him... He had clearly just arrived.

What truly silenced Li Ximing was the man's cultivation base:

'Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm! He's a Daoist cultivator!'

Meeting Li Ximing's gaze, the middle-aged man remained unhurried, apparently unconcerned about the Merciful One trapped beneath the Celestial Gate. He stared intently at Li Ximing, and his deep, heavy voice echoed:

"Helian Wujiang of the Tiefu Kingdom. Greetings, Daoist."

His voice thundered through the night sky, echoing endlessly. The sound caused Daoist Master Luo to pale in fright, while the two Merciful Ones became ecstatic. Down in the ruins, the Master Monks cheered and began to prostrate themselves in worship.

'The Helian family!'

A chill shot through Li Ximing's heart. The name flashed in his mind, followed by a dreadful realization:

'Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm! This is no newly ascended expert. This must be the pillar who has supported the Helian family for decades. And they've sent him here!'

'What does this mean!'

He had long known the Helian of Tiefu were not insignificant, just cursed with a poor location. They had once produced a genius, Helian Fan, but he had been besieged and killed. For the last century, they had failed to produce another notable talent and had been struggling. Only in recent years, when a new junior broke through, had they finally gotten some breathing room.

Even a cultivator as far away as Jiangnan knew of the Helian family's plight, surrounded as they were by predators. It was clear how difficult their lives had been. If sending out Helian Wumeng was a sign they were finally stable and looking to expand their influence south... the appearance of Helian Wujiang changed the nature of the situation entirely.

'For two Helian Purple Mansion Realm experts to come south without worrying about their rear... someone must have mediated the situation in the northern deserts! What does this mean? Was the mediator the Lord of Compassion?'

The Helian family was based in Hetao, where they had their own kingdom, Tiefu. They directly bordered Zhao State, near Longxi, and had always been a vassal to Zhao State. The Murong of the Way of Compassion, however, were in the far-off Yan State. One was in the west, the other in the east; they were worlds apart!

It wasn't that the Way of Compassion lacked the power to mediate, but this was far outside their sphere of influence. Why go to such trouble? Furthermore, based on his timing, the man had *just* arrived. How could it be such a perfect coincidence?

'Kui Qi's plan must have succeeded in part. Otherwise, this man wouldn't be *just* arriving; he would have been lying in ambush all along. And these Buddhist cultivators wouldn't have been caught off guard; they would have feigned surprise while secretly preparing a formation...'

If tiny Caishan warranted a Helian Wujiang, then who was leading the forces on the boundless Luoxia Plain? And what about Xiaoshi Mountain, the side gate guarding the end of the Tangdao Mountain Range?

'Is this still just a simple southern advance by the Buddhist cultivators?'

The thought sent a chill through his entire body. But the current situation allowed no time for deliberation. The man before him had already placed a hand on his waist. He bowed his head slightly, though his deep-set eyes never left Li Ximing.

"By order of the State Preceptor, I came south to garrison Caishan. I traveled day and night, fearing I would fail my orders. I did not expect to encounter an Imperial Scion. My apologies."

Helian Wujiang spoke of apologies, but his face remained an emotionless mask. His pale hand brushed past the sword and the blade, finally grasping the long Spiritual Artifact whip. With a soft click, he unfastened it.

*BOOM!*

Dazzling lightning flashed, and a torrential downpour began to fall. A chill shot down Li Ximing's spine. As his opponent raised his hand, he could faintly see heavy, dark shadows flickering through the rain, sometimes near, sometimes far.

The light from his brow shot out, but it was caught by those venomous shadows, circled once, and shattered into scattered golden flecks. Li Ximing's eyes blazed. Layer after layer of light from the Sun's Resonant Radiance Art materialized before him, forming shimmering barriers in the rain.

*BANG!*

The blue-yellow radiance of Reveal River rippled through the air, descending like a wave. A deafening explosion followed. The light of the Sun's Resonant Radiance Art detonated in a spray of white-hot sparks, instantly evaporating all rain within a wide radius.

*BOOM!*

Thunder rumbled again, a clash of light and shadow. Li Ximing heard his opponent's sharp, clear voice drift through the rain:

"Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. A technique of the Cui family."
