# Chapter 1218: Success

Mount Qusi.

Light flowed through the mountains where chains of interlocking golden links, each as thin as a finger, were weaving across the mountaintop, illuminating the area with a dim yellow glow. At the high platform in the center, all the lights converged where divine abilities intersected.

The Daoist to the side had a solemn expression, the silver pattern between his brows shimmering with light. The glow of the Vault Metal in his hands was like countless silver threads, weaving through the golden chains like a needle pulling thread, controlling them to rise and fall over the platform like swimming dragons.

On the other side, a blue-robed cultivator stood with his hands clasped behind his back. His gaze was filled with admiration, a strange light shimmering in his eyes, and he remained silent for a long time. After an unknown amount of time, a woman slowly materialized beside him.

This woman wore light cyan robes, and her features were delicate. She was wreathed in a divine ability. Merely standing there, she exuded a constantly churning aura, her figure carrying an unusual quality, as if she might merge into the Great Void at any moment. This made the blue-robed youth raise his brows and look over in pleasant surprise, saying:

“You’ve succeeded?”

“That’s right.”

Kuang Yu let out a soft breath of relief and said:

“I’ve finally done it. Now that I’ve crossed this hurdle, things will be much easier from now on.”

A hint of confusion appeared in her eyes as she asked:

“This is…”

Liaoluo nodded slightly and answered:

“A friend of the Li family, named Yuanbian…”

After a slight pause, the Daoist Master’s expression turned to one of awe and gravity as he replied:

“This fellow Daoist’s attainments in the Dao of formations are simply divine… I’ve been around for several hundred years, after all. Although I am not versed in the Dao of formations, I have seen many formation masters, yet I have never witnessed such brilliant methods!”

Refining a formation plate was by no means an easy task. Back then, Changxi had first requested a formation diagram from a Purple Smoke cultivator, then found a cultivator from another house to refine the base embryo. He then brought that golden plate back and handed it over to a formation master to be inscribed. To say nothing of the favors spent going back and forth, the time spent on this entire process—including the nurturing period—could take a decade or even longer!

And though both Qusi and the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had their own methods, combining formation arts and artifact refining to eliminate the handover and nurturing time—what was unexpected was that the Daoist before them had directly produced a technique called the Distant-Platform Gold-Refining Art.

At first, Liaoluo had been dismissive; after all, for a rogue cultivator, no matter how good his possessions were, how could they compare to the Qusi Daoist tradition? But when the man truly put it on display, he finally understood its power.

But the shock Liu Changdie gave him did not end there. Once the three of them had settled on the details and this obscure rogue cultivator began the refinement, Liaoluo discovered that not only was his Daoist tradition profound, but his Dao-Profundity and techniques were in no way inferior. It was the combination of the two that had created the wondrous sight before them!

‘No wonder… no wonder he could make such a boast to Li Jiangqian…’

At his mention, Kuang Yu’s gaze also fell upon the golden locks. After a moment, a solemn look gradually appeared in her eyes, and she spoke in a low voice using her divine ability:

“Impressive… Which school’s technique is this?”

Liaoluo’s expression changed slightly. He masked his words with his divine ability and replied:

“I was just pondering the same thing. This style doesn’t seem to belong to any ordinary school. You see, he doesn’t have the immense dharma power to create a formation in a single step, nor does he exude any kind of impassive immortal air. Instead, he weaves it together like a net, so it should be a type of Encompassing Profoundity.”

The woman frowned:

“The ancient records don’t mention a Great Dao like this… And he’s a rogue cultivator. Could he be from Chuyi Heaven?”

Liaoluo pondered for a long while before shaking his head and saying:

“I don’t think so… After all, Chuyi Heaven doesn’t cultivate Vault Metal… Besides… he doesn’t have any characteristic spiritual qi or Spiritual Treasures on him… He’s only been using a spirit embryo up to this point. Would someone from Chuyi Heaven appear like this?”

Just as Kuang Yu was about to speak, she sensed a fluctuation in the Great Void. A figure in purple robes had already strode out and landed softly. First, she checked the golden locks on the high platform for any errors. Seeing that Liu Changdie was still relatively relaxed and at ease, she then took a seat in the pavilion, a smile in her eyes:

“Sister, you’ve come out of seclusion. Congratulations!”

For some reason, Kuang Yu felt inexplicably awkward upon seeing her. She pursed her lips into a smile and said:

“Sister, what brings you here…”

Tinglan let out a breath and shook her head, saying:

“I had originally accepted a request to be here refining a formation plate for the Li family, but then something happened in Yuyang, and I was urgently summoned over there…”

Liaoluo’s gaze held a trace of doubt:

“How have you returned so soon?”

Tinglan said:

“It was a false alarm… I heard Old Daoist Master Chen went to the lake to request a pill, just as that Li Muyan arrived to probe the area. The old Daoist Master was so frightened he rushed back while calling for help, shaking three Prefectures. In the end, it all came to nothing, and now the news has even reached the imperial court.”

“As a result, Emperor Song summoned them. Several Daoist Masters went, and the Bureau of Immortal Rites also had to make an appearance. I had no choice but to enter the palace with them, and have been caught up in this mess until now…”

“Requesting a pill?”

Liaoluo was noncommittal, only saying casually:

“Truly, the winds of change are stirring—But for a secret matter like a Daoist Master’s movements in and out of the Prefecture to be leaked so easily, it seems the news got out as soon as Old Daoist Master Chen left. The Chen family is not clean.”

At these words, Tinglan shook her head. She said:

“I also just heard a piece of news in the palace. It’s said the Qing clan possesses a treasure obtained from Wanling Heaven back in the day. It is a precious artifact of the Heaven–Governing path, with some scouting capabilities. Probing Moongaze Lake is difficult, but investigating Yuyang is as easy as turning over one’s hand…”

“And because of this, that Li Muyan left with ease; no one was able to intercept him.”

A trace of worry appeared on Kuang Yu’s face as she asked:

“In that case, have arrangements been made for the western defensive line?”

When this matter was brought up, a look of admiration appeared in Tinglan’s eyes. She said softly:

“Emperor Song has already ordered Qiuhu to garrison Yuyang, and Qinghu has gone with him. He also dispatched Chen Wenyao, Si Xunhui, and other Holders of the Profound to lead troops to guard the area… As for Old Daoist Master Chen…”

“His Excellency has placed him in the Mushroom Forest Plains.”

As soon as these words were spoken, Liaoluo immediately nodded and replied:

“His Excellency means… Western Shu still has designs on Moongaze.”

“Of course they do.”

Tinglan smiled and said:

“If not, why would this formation plate require so many of us to act? That Highness is a man of means, vigorously seeking spiritual resources from every sect and clan, going door to door and causing a great stir—It’s hard to say if the Li family is truly so short on spiritual resources, but with all this commotion, who wouldn’t think that Western Shu intends to make a move on the lake islands?”

A look of admiration showed in her eyes as she said:

“Now, even the Emperor cannot pretend not to see. After all, this subordinate has just expanded the Great Song’s territory by a thousand miles, so some gesture of support is naturally required.”

Liaoluo, however, had other thoughts. He sneered and said:

“A pity he doesn’t have much strength left in his hands. With Yang Ruiyi gone, he must be completely in the dark. Is this not the Underworld rapping his knuckles, showing that without the Yang family… your Great Song…”

“Martial Uncle!”

Kuang Yu quickly cried out to stop him, cutting off his words. Tinglan simply pretended not to hear, lowering her gaze to sip her tea. After a moment, the three of them froze in unison, suddenly raising their heads to look at the sky!

‘So fast!’

The Daoist in mid-air turned solemn. He pressed a hand to his chest and spat out a mouthful of essence blood. Spurred by this, the golden chains began to tighten, drawing all the Lesser Yang light inward, becoming incredibly heavy. Countless golden radiances intertwined; it was clearly the final step.

‘How ruthless!’

‘How long has he been on this mountain! With our help… this speed is already as fast as it could possibly be. Why the rush to finish? This is far too much exertion!’

It should have taken another half a year or so to reach the final stage where they would all act together. Unexpectedly, upon seeing Tinglan’s return, Liu Changdie decisively damaged his vital energy to nourish the formation plate. How could she stand by and watch? She too acted immediately, lending her aid. Her figure rose like a wisp of purple qi, already standing at a high vantage point. Billowing purple clouds drifted down, cloaking all the golden chains in a violet brilliance.

Liaoluo also raised his sleeve, his expression grave. A vast expanse of Converging Water surged from his sleeve, churning and merging in the air like an endless, vast ocean, lifting up all the radiant light.

With the three Daoist Masters working together, the golden locks in the sky finally became light, emitting crisp clinking sounds. As they shimmered with the light of the heavens, they continuously converged inward, light and shadow interweaving, until at last they condensed into a single point of gold.

“Good!”

Although Liu Changdie had exhausted his divine ability and seemed on the verge of collapsing, his eyes were bright. A silver light blossomed in his palm, catching the golden point, turning it downward, and drawing it into his sleeve.

From beginning to end, besides Liu Changdie himself, no one saw the true form of the formation plate.

Matters concerning formation plates were extremely critical. For a formation master of his caliber, even a single glance at a great formation’s plate would greatly increase the chances of breaking it! After all, he had always treated the Li family’s affairs as his own. He simply smiled and said politely:

“This item cannot see the light; I am currently nurturing it with my Vault Metal.”

The Daoist Masters present were all from profound traditions and were keen to avoid any suspicion, so naturally, no one minded. They waited for Liu Changdie to take a few deep breaths and for his pale complexion to recover before Liaoluo finally spoke with a sigh:

“Truly a sight to behold!”

These were words straight from the heart. Faced with Liu Changdie, even Tinglan seemed somewhat inferior. In the eyes of this Daoist Master from Mount Qusi, there was no one in Jiangnan today whose skill in the Dao of formations could definitively surpass this man’s:

‘Perhaps in a hundred years, with Ning Wan’s talent in the Dao of formations, she might be able to approach his level.’

Liu Changdie, however, felt the other was just being polite. He performed a salute and replied:

“Many thanks to you two Daoist Masters for your assistance!”

He then entered the pavilion, sat down, and poured some tea. Tinglan shook her head and said:

“You all are overseas and don’t know of his reputation, but I heard of him long ago!”

Liu Changdie understood her meaning. In his youth, he had roamed far and wide, disrupting the plans of several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. A mix of nostalgia and bitterness washed over him as he said quietly:

“Back then, I thought the road beneath my feet was endless, and I was reckless and ignorant. Only now do I realize I am as insignificant as a goose feather, not worth mentioning…”

With Fuxun’s fall, Liu Changdie’s heart had been filled with grief and cold despair. The casual expression of that Lesser Yang Dragon King with four divine abilities seemed to still be right before his eyes—he had thought that by mastering divine abilities, even if his entire Dao lineage was severed, he could at least protect his own corner of the world…

‘In reality… even a Demon King with three divine abilities is nothing special… And I am not some important figure that the great lords are wary of; I was discarded like a worn-out shoe long ago! If not for the Li family, I couldn’t even have saved myself back then!’

‘A discarded pawn!’

He had thought himself the target of endless schemes, thought himself to be mired in trouble, suspecting that some great power was watching him wherever he went. In reality, it was all just a joke. The bitterness of being suppressed by those above the level of divine abilities had turned out to be nothing more than arrogance…

In truth, the moment his path to the Dao was casually severed, he, Liu Changdie, became like a foul insect that no one would spare a second glance for!

Having sorted through and made sense of these things in recent days, he appeared calm. Liu Changdie quietly held his cup and smiled:

“Let’s not speak of these troublesome matters… I wonder how things are on the mainland?”

Tinglan briefly mentioned the Li family’s whereabouts. Liu Changdie’s gaze flickered, and he nodded, saying softly:

“The formation’s foundation on the mainland is complete, and the plate has now been refined. I will make a trip there, nurturing the formation plate along the way.”

Indeed, the Lesser Yang Dragon King’s words had been like a heavy hammer, smashing all his thoughts to dust. To this day, there was not much left that Liu Changdie cared for; besides Moongaze Lake, the place of his past life’s birth, aging, sickness, and death, there were few things worth his attachment.

‘Since… I’m already a discarded pawn, I don’t need to fear bringing trouble to the lake. From the tone of that Dragon King, even if I did bring some trouble, the family’s head wouldn’t be afraid at all. Why should I remain overseas and not move forward?’

‘Furthermore…’

His gaze was distant, finally resting upon his own severed path of the Dao.

‘To find the inheritance of Vault Metal, it is impossible to remain at the ends of the earth… Even if there is a sliver of a trace in this world, it must be on the mainland…’

The Daoist stood up, saluted his farewells, and vanished into the Great Void. The two from Qusi were not familiar with him and felt no surprise, but Tinglan knew him, and her eyes flickered slightly:

‘Strange… In the past, he always stayed overseas guarding that island, yet today he rushed back. It seems he cannot interfere in the great war or touch the Li family’s karma, but establishing a great formation poses no problem.’

Liu Changdie had been abroad for so many years that Tinglan naturally had her own speculations. For now, she secretly committed this to memory and did not linger. She said with a serious expression:

“I returned under the pretext of dealing with matters in Jinghai. Since the formation plate is complete, I must also hurry back… I won’t disturb you any further.”

She hurried off to the north. The atmosphere on the mountain instantly felt empty, filled with the heavy feeling of an impending storm. Kuang Yu raised her brows and said:

“Where is Nanwu?”

“He is currently condensing his divine ability.”

Liaoluo sighed and said:

“These past few days have been quite busy. My immortal foundation has been fully condensed and is ready to be raised at any time, but I was afraid something might happen with no one on the mountain. Now that you’ve come out of seclusion, I can finally retreat in peace…”

His words trailed off as he noticed the woman before him had already turned her head, her gaze filled with astonishment. A moment later, Liaoluo also looked toward the high platform and stood up in shock.

Above them, the clouds roiled in the sky, casting a gloomy darkness. The sound of clashing weapons seemed to echo as fierce winds howled, and hailstones of all sizes rained down from the heavens, creating a staccato clatter as they struck the forest.

Within the clouds, the qi of yin and yang converged, shifting and transforming. The Great Void responded, sending down streaks of pitch-black fissures, and the spiritual machinations churned unceasingly like boiling water.

‘A celestial anomaly!’

A look of shocked suspicion leaped into the woman’s eyes. She took a step forward, exchanged a glance with the Daoist beside her, and formed a hand seal. The suspicion in her eyes finally melted into intense joy:

‘Juexi… has succeeded!’
