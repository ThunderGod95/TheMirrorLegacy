# Chapter 964: Feathered Serpent Metallic Essence

Chi Buzi's mind raced. His gaze swept over Fuxuan's face before settling on the teacup. "Regardless," he said, his voice quiet, "I must thank you and Senior Daoist Master Yuanshang for intervening this time. Otherwise, there would have been no hope."

Fuxuan understood that by invoking the 'Penglai' invitation, Chi Buzi was no longer secretly wondering if their Daoist Master Yuanshang was dead. His words were full of affirmation. Yet, faced with Chi Buzi's gratitude, Fuxuan did not reply.

Fuxuan wasn't as virulently hateful of evil as the two juniors of his house. He also had some lingering friendship with Chi Buzi from their early acquaintance. But an old knot remained in his heart, a self-drawn line between "righteous" and "heretical" that he refused to cross. He could only close his eyes and sip his tea.

The blue-eyed man, however, seemed completely unbothered. He sat upright, calmly holding his cup.

"Whoosh..."

A wind howled through the courtyard, tunneling through his sleeves, making his green robes rustle and flap. The ink-black beads at his waist swayed gently.

The wind lightly tousled the hair at Fuxuan's temples. He snapped his eyes open, staring at the last empty seat by the table.

Ethereal clouds drifted, Dharma light condensed into purple, and yin-energy roiled as silvery-white light flowed. All manner of phenomena converged on the empty seat. It first brightened with an inexplicable light, then just as quickly, everything vanished into nothingness. A sleeve, adorned with hangings like the feathers of a bird, swept across the table. A jade-like hand lifted a cup.

A beautiful man with a soft, androgynous face and striking phoenix eyes had appeared.

Chi Buzi continued to sip his tea, head bowed, but the wind in the courtyard abruptly ceased. A smile touched his words.

"Lord Wei."

The moment he spoke, the wind returned, swelling into a gale. An expanse of Pristine Water, green as a shadowed pool, spread out beneath the three of them. The sound of dripping water filled their ears. Darkness fell, and a chilling mist permeated the air, enveloping them all. It was as if they had left the hall and arrived at the edge of a grim, sunless pond.

In this dark, Underworld-like place, the man of indiscernible gender smiled. His voice was clear and bright.

"Brother Buzi."

Waves of white-and-shadowed Veiled Yin rolled out with the crisp, clacking sound of colliding beads. Wei Xuanyin sat in the northern position. All the light in the courtyard seemed to drain toward him. Behind him, a circular screen seemed to unfold, its edges revealing the faint silhouettes of furry branches with leaves as fine as needles.

"Omm!"

Amidst this frenzied clash between Veiled Yin and Pristine Water, only one spot remained clear, like moonlight spilling on the ground. At some point, Fuxuan had drawn his sword and now held it in his lap, his eyes closed.

The clash of divine abilities began and ended in an instant. All phenomena vanished. The light in Wei Xuanyin's and Chi Buzi's eyes faded. Not even the teacups on the table had so much as rippled; they still sat serenely before the two men.

"Daoist Friend Chi, it has been too long!"

Wei Xuanyin smiled, a trace of emotion in his gaze. "I always knew you were a first-rate talent, but I never imagined you would cross the Purple Mystery so easily!"

Chi Buzi watched him, his expression cold and detached. "Lord Wei," he said softly, "I doubt you came all this way from the north, busy as you are, just to reminisce."

Wei Xuanyin's smile faded. His voice turned grim. "You know full well why this matter was set to take place in the Eastern Sea. For many years, His Excellency has not let slip a single portion of the Feathered Serpent's Metallic Essence. Not even the Underworld dares to interfere. Do you truly understand the stakes of this?"

Chi Buzi's expression was calm. "I wouldn't have come here otherwise."

Wei Xuanyin retrieved a jade box from his sleeve and placed it gently on the table, pressing down on it with five fingers as white as jade. Chi Buzi's eyes narrowed.

"How is Suiguan?"

Wei Xuanyin looked amused. "He returned to Pristine Speech Heaven. His Excellency used the Chou-Gui Hidden Form to conceal him. He is now detached from causality, hidden away in a place of obscurity... No one can divine his fate."

A hint of sarcasm entered Chi Buzi's gaze. He chuckled. "This is hardly the first time."

Wei Xuanyin smiled back and gently opened the jade box, revealing a small, pale-gold seal within. It was two fingers wide and three fingers high. A ferocious, majestic Feathered Serpent was coiled atop it, its wings enshrouding the sides of the seal.

The serpent seemed to possess a demonic magic, holding all three of their gazes. Chi Buzi did not reach for it. Instead, he slowly shifted his eyes and spoke in a measured tone.

"I have one more question for you, Lord Wei."

Wei Xuanyin smiled. "Please."

Chi Buzi's voice was haunting. "The Chou-Gui delights in concealment, its position is to 'gather within water.' Since His Excellency can hide... hide even the very root and status that the Feathered Serpent left for its descendants—hiding it so well the serpent has no feathers, its tail has lost its three barbs..."

"Then, knowing the seal might contain the Metallic Essence, why not secure it? Why let it wander free?"

His eyes locked onto Wei Xuanyin. "And if you say it's for someone to retrieve it—a True Monarch cannot. How can I?"

Wei Xuanyin glanced at Fuxuan, whose face was gradually paling. He clapped his hands. "Impressive, Daoist Friend! Truly impressive!"

He stood up, his tone deep and somber. "The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal, is a token of the Feathered Serpent. It was rumored to be one of its choices for a Dharma Treasure. In the end, the Feathered Serpent chose the 'Pingtan Light,' and this item was passed to the Miexuan Snake Monarch."

"Back then, when the True Hornless Dragon swallowed the Pristine Water, it initiated the ancient era. The Pristine-Converging relationship was altered. The Miexuan Snake Monarch fled. The leader of the Nine Sons, the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, who considered himself the foremost of the Hornless Dragon lineage, sensed something was wrong. But he couldn't find him. He went to ask the Western Sea Dragon King, Dongfang Yuezhu, but even together, they could not divine the seal's location."

"From that moment, cultivators began to suspect the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal contained the Metallic Essence, a hidden gambit left by the Feathered Serpent."

His expression shifted, growing serious. "As a great sage who achieved the Dao in primordial times, the True Hornless Dragon naturally would not act uselessly. It was confident at the time, but this was an unprecedented event. In the end, it perished. Yet, in antiquity, there is merit in 'empty proof.' Though it fell, its achievement was no less than his peers. With the 'transformation of Pristine to Converging' in the past, the two, Pristine and Converging, were already different."

A Dharma-light rippled in his eyes, his divine ability activating on its own, seemingly to conceal them from the karmic backlash of discussing ancient matters. "The Miexuan Snake Monarch cultivated in silence, refusing to 'enter the leap' or 'enter the auxiliary'. He secretly received help from the master of Pit Water, reincarnated three times to cleanse his spirit, and took human form. He intended to secretly seize the position of Pristine Water, but in 'Jizhong,' he ran into the Lord of Jade True, who had not yet achieved the Dao, and was killed."

"The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal thus fell into the hands of the Immortal Mansion."

Wei Xuanyin paused. Seeing Chi Buzi's blank expression, he knew the other man was already familiar with much of this and was merely seeking confirmation. He continued softly, "When Daoist Master Donghua appeared, this item finally re-emerged in the world. He gave it to Ning Tiaoxiao, who cultivates Pristine Water. It's rumored Chi Wei secretly leaked that this item had already been refined by moonlight, becoming a great wonder that could elevate both Pristine and Converging Water. If the Metallic Essence is still within... I don't need to spell out the implications."

"And the Feathered Serpent... His Excellency isn't the only one watching. The Dragons are watching. All the cultivators are watching."

Wei Xuanyin smiled. "The world today has been turned upside down. His Excellency's methods are profound, securing his Pristine Water position. The Dragon-kin are tyrannical, suppressing the Feathered Serpent. They are both sitting comfortably, waiting for the fish to bite. They don't fear a mere wisp of Metallic Essence. For both His Excellency and the Dragon-kin, whether they get it or not, destroying one of its backup plans is always a good thing. On this point, their interests align. They were just waiting for Ning Tiaoxiao to break through, to see what kind of gambit would be triggered."

"And so, Ning Tiaoxiao secretly understood the predicament and swore never to cultivate his divine ability..."

"Wrong."

Chi Buzi calmly interrupted him. "If this were true, how could His Excellency allow him not to cultivate? How could the Dragon-kin allow it? Don't try to tell me they 'didn't care.' I know His Excellency better than you."

Wei Xuanyin's expression froze for a second. He re-evaluated Chi Buzi. "I asked Lord Suiguan that very question," he said softly.

"When the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal first appeared, it was brought back to the Azure Pond. His Excellency examined it."

His gaze grew inscrutable. "There should have been a result. It was a 'method' left by the previous Jade True master. His True Unification Transformation was left inside it... According to Lord Xue's speculation, the Metallic Essence should be in that previous Jade True master's Grotto-Heaven. When the seal's owner breaks through, it will connect to it and descend into the world."

Chi Buzi now understood completely. He laughed. "So, at the time, none of them wanted to alert him, nor did they want to hold this hot potato that linked back to the original Jade True master. What you said before was just the first layer of truth, a lie that we—you, me, the Three Yuans, the Two Purples—are all caught in. Ning Tiaoxiao would rather die than become fodder for His Excellency, little knowing that the heavens were watching him coldly, wanting him not to cultivate, letting him die deceived by that first layer of lies!"

He stood up slowly, his voice light, filled with the clarity of sudden realization. "Therefore, Chi Wei's death was not unjust. His failure to obtain the 'gold' was fated. Since the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal could help its owner connect to the Metallic Essence and draw the attention of the original Jade True master, he was always a potential threat. The severing of the Pristine Water Dao Lineage is largely due to the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal, which also made those who wanted to cause trouble for His Excellency give up."

A chilling frost filled his eyes. "And the other part... True Monarch Shangyuan's ascension confirmed that the renowned original Jade True master had already left for the outer heavens. With his protector gone and no hope of breakthrough, Ning Tiaoxiao's death was immediate and certain! Only then did the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal quickly 'disappear,' smoothly becoming a chess piece that the various Lords could pick up and place in their pockets."

Wei Xuanyin smiled as he watched him. "Back then... it was someone from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition who gave it to my Viewing Pavilion. In exchange, his house earned the right to stay out of worldly affairs. Even though they interfered several times from beginning to end, and even sent someone to disrupt things at the final moment, they were still let off lightly. That was the reason."

Fuxuan, sitting to the side, was profoundly shaken, staring at Wei Xuanyin in disbelief. Chi Buzi, however, was not surprised. He sneered twice. "I knew it was him!"

Only now did Chi Buzi finally let his gaze fall upon the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. An incredibly deep, calculating look entered his eyes. "...Having eliminated the dissent from both sides," he muttered, "His Excellency and the Dragon-kin are both eagerly awaiting me to draw out this wisp of Metallic Essence..."

The implication was that his own Dao-path lay with one of these two factions.
As expected, Wei Xuanyin smiled and nodded. "You cultivate Pristine Water, Daoist Friend. You surely understand these matters better than I. The Refining Pristine Water into Converging Water is a precedent, a cause-and-effect of the heaviest weight. If you dissolve your cultivation base to cultivate Converging Water, with your talent, you would absolutely surpass ninety-nine percent of all others! Not to mention, your cultivation would advance by leaps and bounds!"

"I'd have to succeed in the switch!" Chi Buzi retorted.

The other man laughed. "As long as the Dragon-kin are willing to help you, there will be a turning point. Dissolve your cultivation, switch to Converging Water... the 'logic of the Dao-path' is there, your future is bright. As for joining His Excellency... you could also try to seek an Auxiliary Position. The decision is yours."

It was impossible to know how much of his words were in jest, but his meaning was clear. There were two paths before him, but both required extracting the Metallic Essence as a prerequisite: join the Dragons, reincarnate, and cultivate Converging Water; or join His Excellency and attain an Auxiliary Position in Pristine Water.

Chi Buzi's features grew even colder. He stared at the small golden seal for a long time, unable to look away.

'[Converging Water] may favor the 'leap,' but how could the Dragon-kin tolerate me? His Excellency's heart is treacherous; how could I possibly attain an Auxiliary Position in Pristine Water? Neither path is easy...'

'Moreover... how can it be as simple as 'attaining it'? Where is the 'logic of the Dao-path'? Where is the method to seek the 'gold'?!'

But Fuxuan's words still echoed in his mind. His earlier judgment of Ning Tiaoxiao's situation now applied to himself:

'How could His Excellency allow him not to cultivate? How could the Dragon-kin allow it? Some opportunities, when they arrive... you cannot question their origin. You have no choice but to use them!'

He could only silently take the jade box and stare fixedly at Wei Xuanyin.

"Many thanks, Lord Wei!"

"It's nothing!"

Wei Xuanyin's smile also vanished. For people like them, on the verge of perfecting their divine abilities, with a chance to strike for Fruition Attainment, to attain a 'leap' or 'auxiliary' position... which one of them wasn't risking their very life-mandate in the torrent of the era for a chance at the Dao?

'Whether it's me or Chi Buzi... or the older generation like the Two Purples, Yuanshang, Yuandao... or even Yehui! We just have a little room to maneuver. We're nothing like Li Zhouwei... no matter how great his destiny, he's like cattle penned in a circle, just waiting to die!'

A feeling of shared sympathy rose in him. He stopped teasing and watched as Chi Buzi dissolved into Pristine Water and vanished.

Once Chi Buzi was gone, a complex look entered Fuxuan's eyes. He didn't know if he was envious of Chi Buzi for being able to stand in the great tide and make a choice, or if he was sighing at the sharpness that allowed him to stand there and see clearly. "I finally understand," he said with deep emotion, "why Master could see that Xiao Jinzhou was a seed of Dao-attainment! Such people truly exist."

"He was shaped by circumstance, an ambitious man from the start," Wei Xuanyin replied, before adding, "He certainly has the desire to not bend his knee to another. Who knows where his final divine ability lies... but in any case, it's most likely not the orthodox Pit Water, which is unsuitable for his breakthrough."

"His remaining options are Converging Water, Pristine Water, Water Mansion, and Valley Water. His Excellency has a 'method' placed in his soul. Converging Water is clearly pro-Dragon. Pristine Water won't just appear from nowhere, and even if it did, he wouldn't dare cultivate it—he'd be suspected of using Dragon power to scheme for the Pristine Water Fruition Attainment and would likely die violently. Perhaps he'll choose Water Mansion, which is close to Pristine Water, and seek a 'leap' position. Or, he'll choose Valley Water to ensure a safe reincarnation!"

Wei Xuanyin's Dao-Profundity was extremely high. In a few short sentences, he had incisively analyzed the entire situation. His earlier probe was likely an attempt to test Chi Buzi's final divine ability. Now, he finally turned his gaze to Fuxuan, a hint of resignation in his voice. "You were willing to personally step in and push this matter forward for me... It must be for that same reason..."

"Lord Wei is wise!" Fuxuan's gaze was steady, his voice clear. "The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is, after all, my former sect... Both houses have already retired to the mountains and will not interfere again. I beg you all to spare them... Do not hunt them to extinction!"

"Hunt them to extinction..." Wei Xuanyin said simply, "That is not something we do... If you're looking for someone, you should be looking for the Underworld!"

Fuxuan bowed his head. "I beg Lord Wei to show me a path!"

Wei Xuanyin rose to his feet and drifted away, leaving only his final words behind:

"Stop meddling in worldly affairs. If you had all upheld the rule of separation between immortal and mortal, and had not tried to control the regions and dismember the Yue State all those years ago... would you be in this predicament today?"
