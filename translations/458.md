# Chapter 658: Severance

At Mount Qingdu.

The long-deserted grand hall finally welcomed its owner. A young man in white robes read meticulously through a stack of letters. Li Yuexiang sat beside him, occasionally chiming in with a few comments to fill in the gaps.

Li Xijun had just broken through a critical stage. After spending a few days stabilizing his cultivation, he emerged from his cave dwelling to handle family affairs. He leafed through the letters and quickly obtained a comprehensive understanding of the household’s current situation.

His eyebrows lifted in surprise, and he muttered, "Yuan Hudu... This man is something else."

Based on the gathered intelligence, the Yuan Family had stabilized itself under the leadership of the Second Elder, Yuan Hudu. This alone was not unusual. What truly caught everyone off guard was Yuan Hudu's approach: he had completely exonerated and reinstated the adversaries who had opposed him during the internal power struggle. Except for a few individuals who were injured during the conflict, the family had emerged virtually unscathed.

"How dare he?!" Li Xijun exclaimed, his tone laced with incredulity.

While this move undeniably preserved the Yuan Family’s overall strength, it left an indelible stain on Yuan Hudu’s claim to the position of family head. After all, even though he had wrested it from Yuan Huyuan, the upper echelons of the family were hardly his loyal supporters. Failing to take advantage of such an opportunity to purge dissenters seemed tantamount to digging his own grave. Even with the backing of the Chi Family, this decision felt overly audacious.

The situation had unfolded beyond everyone’s expectations. It was likely that not even Yuan Chengdun or Yuan Huyuan had anticipated such a turn of events, let alone the surrounding families. After a series of internal conflicts, the Yuan Family appeared outwardly unscathed, with only the disappearance of Yuan Huyuan raising suspicions and fueling speculation.

"There’s an eighty or even ninety percent chance that this was the Chi Family’s doing. Let’s observe for now," Li Xijun remarked. His face betrayed a trace of doubt, as though he had arrived at some unpleasant conjecture. He fell silent, deep in thought.

Nearby, the aged Li Xuanxuan watched quietly. He had an enigmatic expression as he broke the silence. "I recall meeting Yuan Huyuan once in my youth, when our ancestor had just reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. Yuan Huyuan came to congratulate him and said something that I still remember today."

"What did he say?" Li Xijun asked.

"He said... he aspired to be a diner at the table, carving out his share of the feast, rather than a mere hunting dog. But now, it seems, even those who sit at the table are nothing more than chess pieces in the eyes of the Chi Family. A marriage alliance means little in the grand scheme of things."

Li Xijun responded, "There is no such thing as diners carving a share of the feast. In the end, it comes down to whether or not one has reached the Purple Mansion Realm... or if one can leverage a connection to a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Xiang’er, continue reading."

Li Yuexiang nodded and continued explaining. She spoke at length about recent events, and eventually mentioned Yuan Fuyao.

Li Xijun listened for a while, frowning, then suddenly raised his hand to interrupt her. "Have you observed closely? Is Yuan Fuyao truly unaware of everything? Did Yuan Huyuan not send any loyal followers to keep an eye on him?"

"No, he didn’t," Li Yuexiang replied. She hesitated for a moment before adding, "But it doesn’t feel like complete ignorance. It’s as if he knows fragments of the truth but is missing much of the bigger picture."

Li Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment, and a hint of astonishment flashed across his face. Unable to hold back, he turned to Li Xijun and asked, "I wasn’t aware of his thoughts either. Yuan Chengdun not sending anyone to watch over this child is one thing. But even Yuan Huyuan didn’t assign a reliable person to oversee him? He left him to his own devices? He’s just a half-grown boy... what could he possibly understand?"

"Oh?" Li Xijun’s eyes fell to the paper before him, and he wrote a few notes. After a brief moment, he spoke calmly, "Yuan Chengdun trusted the wrong person and fell into the schemes of Yuan Huyuan and Yuan Hudu."

"What?"

Li Yuexiang and Li Xuanxuan were both visibly shaken by this revelation. They fell silent, each lost in their own thoughts.

Li Xijun seemed to have caught a thread of the bigger picture. He murmured, "I fear Yuan Tuan is beyond saving as well."

Before he could elaborate, a subordinate approached from the lower end of the hall, leaned in, and whispered a few words into his ear.

Li Xijun’s expression darkened slightly. He asked, "He left?"

"Yes, my lord," the man replied. "The young master claimed to be in secluded cultivation, but in truth, he slipped out of our territory late at night and headed south. Our people followed him for a while but didn’t dare intervene and had to let him go."

"He’s likely returned to the Yuan Family." Li Xuanxuan, naturally overheard the whispers, and his face darkened with displeasure. "How can he act so recklessly? He’s not afraid of offending our family! Fortunately, this matter was privately agreed upon between the two families. Otherwise, if word got out, people might think he fled from the marriage arrangement!"

However, Li Xijun set the letter in his hand aside and leaned back against the wooden chair. His sharp eyebrows knitted slightly, and he pondered aloud, "If you ask me, despite this Yuan brat offending our family, as long as Yuan Chengdun's death isn't confirmed, he will always have another way out. There’s no guarantee that Yuan Huyuan isn’t betting on both sides and engaging in some clever schemes."

Li Xuanxuan appeared confused as he sank into thought in an attempt to make sense of it. However, Li Xijun was seemingly indifferent. He sipped his tea leisurely and explained, "Just wait. If Yuan Huyuan and Yuan Hudu are truly united, and if Yuan Chengdun trusted the wrong person, then Yuan Huyuan will show up at our doorstep any moment now."

Li Yuexiang, catching on, speculated quietly, "Could it be that the chaos in the Yuan Family was intentional?"

But before her words could even fade away, a commotion erupted at the lower end of the hall. A Jade Court Guard, clad in gleaming armor, stepped forward with a crisp clang of metal.

Bowing respectfully, he announced, "My lord, Yuan Huyuan from the Yuan Family seeks an audience."

Li Xijun chuckled, glancing at Li Xuanxuan. His voice turned cold as he remarked, "As expected. The direct bloodline staged a grand show of infighting and sacrificed Yuan Chengdun and his son to protect the bigger picture! The Yuan Family wants to sever all ties with us, with Qingsui, and with Yuan Tuan, just to become obedient lapdogs under the Chi family’s banner!"

Despite the declining influence within the Azure Pond Sect, the Yuan Family had once been a significant power with considerable autonomy. They had thrived for many years when Yuan Licheng, a disciple of Chi Buzi, was still alive. But now that Yuan Licheng had passed away and Chi Buzi was missing, the Yuan Family had become a battleground between two sects. It seemed inevitable that they would fall under the Chi Family’s control as a vassal.

"It seems Yuan Chengdun might have left someone behind or sent a letter to warn the boy, but Yuan Huyuan intercepted everything." Li Xijun’s eyes glimmered as he revealed his pristine white teeth in a sharp smile. "How could the Chi Family’s dog possibly cozy up to the Xiao Family’s dog? Yet, they must obey the Chi Family’s orders. They’re aiming to loudly and clearly sever ties with every family. At the same time, they fear truly offending us. So, they’ve sent Yuan Huyuan as a mediator. What a calculation! What a plan!"

Li Xuanxuan had finally pieced everything together. He mulled over the matter and finally spoke in a hushed tone, "You’re saying... the Yuan Family never intended to resist. They pledged allegiance to the Chi Family long ago, and everything was just a show to gain the trust of others. Yuan Huyuan and Yuan Hudu have been colluding from the start. Yuan Chengdun tried to do the right thing with good intentions, but Yuan Huyuan twisted it into a move to humiliate our family and curry favor with those above?"

Li Xijun’s eyes narrowed. "That’s more or less the case. Our family allied with the Ning and Xiao Families, so the Yuan Family, now serving as a lapdog, naturally cannot act as it once did. They’ve placed their bets on two fronts.

"The first is whether they can locate Yuan Tuan, and the second is whether they can drag our family into this mess. If these two matters can be resolved clearly, the Yuan Family would obviously prefer independence. But if we refuse to get involved, the marriage arrangement becomes a convenient excuse to publicly sever ties with our family. Whether we agree or not, as long as word spreads that Yuan Fuyao fled the engagement, it will drive a wedge between the two families."

Li Xijun’s deductions came together swiftly and clearly. He concluded softly, "The day Yuan Huyuan came seeking Granduncle’s assistance and was denied was the day he decided to pledge loyalty to the Chi Family. From that moment, Yuan Chengdun’s letter would have never reached Yuan Fuyao. No matter what, Yuan Fuyao has now become the trigger for the rupture between the two families."

Li Xuanxuan’s face darkened with a mix of anger and sorrow. "Yuan Huyuan once met my Second Uncle. I thought the Yuan Family would maintain a friendly relationship with us for generations. How could it come to this? Even if the situation forced their hand, there was no need to resort to such underhanded tactics!"

He began to rise, ready to confront the matter, but Li Xijun raised a hand to stop him. The younger man’s calm demeanor contradicted the sharpness of his tone as he said, "I’ll handle him."

Yuan Huyuan looked disheveled and drained of energy as he entered. But he looked up as a strikingly handsome young man approached him. The youth’s white robes were as pristine as freshly fallen snow, and Li Yuexiang stood quietly by his side.

Yuan Huyuan was stunned. He paused for a moment before tentatively speaking, "I wonder if Daoist Xuanxuan might be available...?"

"You’ve come at an unfortunate time, senior," the young man replied with a faint smile. "The elder is cultivating in seclusion. I am Li Xijun, and this is my younger sister, Yuexiang. Greetings, Senior Huyuan."

Yuan Huyuan’s eyes flickered briefly over Li Xijun’s face. Something in the youth’s expression struck him as even more challenging to deal with than Li Xuanxuan.

He cleared his throat before rasping, "Another cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm... Your family truly produces talents in abundance. It’s admirable."

Li Xijun shook his head modestly and replied softly, "You flatter me, senior. May I ask the purpose of your visit today?"

Yuan Huyuan’s weathered face fell as his tone turned mournful. "I am powerless on my own... The Yuan family has already fallen into my younger brother’s hands. He has devoted himself entirely to the Chi family and turned us into their vassals. I fear he might disregard the bond between our families and do something foolish!"

"Oh?" Li Xijun raised an eyebrow in apparent surprise as he replied, "If it’s about returning the betrothal gifts, that’s a minor matter."

Feigning ignorance, he gestured to the Jade Court Guards standing nearby and serenely ordered, "Please escort Young Master Yuan here."

Yuan Huyuan felt a chill run down his spine. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, Li Xijun unexpectedly took his hand with a courteous smile and said gently, "Senior Yuan, the friendship between our families spans generations. You’ve even met our family’s ancestor! The congratulatory gift you sent, the Dragon Coiling Pillar, remains as our family head’s sword to this day. How could there ever be betrayal between us?"

Li Xijun’s words were warm and polite, yet there was an unmistakable undertone to them. Cold beads of perspiration started to glisten on Yuan Huyuan’s forehead as Li Xijun continued, his voice calm yet firm, "Your relationship with us is solid, senior. My sister can certainly spend more time chatting with you..."

The implications behind his words caused Yuan Huyuan to falter. He wiped his brow and stammered weakly, "Actually... I fear that..."

Just then, a Jade Court Guard rushed in, kneeling as he reported urgently, "My lord! Young Master Yuan has escaped!"

"Escaped?" Li Xijun exclaimed in apparent disbelief. His tone carried a faint hint of amusement as he continued, "How could that be? Go check the farm again."

Yuan Huyuan’s face was drenched in sweat. His expression crumbled into despair as he said, "Xijun... there’s no need to search anymore! My younger brother has already summoned him back. Let’s just forget about this matter... I can only apologize to Miss Yuexiang!"

Li Xijun’s expression darkened instantly.He remained silent for several moments before finally replying icily, "Senior, if you had no desire for this union, you could have just said so. Why go to such lengths to humiliate my family?"

Yuan Huyuan’s heart was swirling in turmoil as he struggled to lift his head and meet Li Xijun’s eyes. For a fleeting moment, he seemed to glimpse the shadow of a middle-aged man in gray robes from years past. The memory of Li Tongya and his unfathomable presence surged back into his mind. He could no longer sit still, and his wooden chair suddenly began to feel like a precarious perch.

He had seen several generations of the Li family, and though none had ever evoked the towering, unshakable presence of Li Tongya, Li Xijun now felt like a blade concealed in snow—piercingly sharp and unerringly perceptive. It felt as though his every calculation had been laid bare.

Yuan Huyuan could only sigh in misery, "I have already lost control of my family. I have no power over my younger brother. I fear he will make a spectacle of this and sever all ties between our families. Yuexiang... Yuexiang... I never thought it would come to this!"

The implication was clear. Yuan Huyuan’s brother intended to spread the rumor that Yuan Fuyao had fled because he regretted the betrothal, ensuring a complete and irreparable rupture between the Yuan and Li families. Yuan Huyuan raised his tired, sorrowful face to look at Li Yuexiang, expecting to see anger or humiliation.

Instead, he was met with a calm, smiling countenance. Her almond-shaped eyes blinked softly and her voice was as gentle as a spring breeze as she replied, "It’s fine, senior. I’m fine."

Despite her seemingly serene tone, Yuan Huyuan felt a shiver run down his spine. It was like he could hear the distant echo of a sword’s cold hum. Her gaze, though polite, carried unspoken words that seemed to pierce through him.

But your family may not be.

Yuan Huyuan could no longer find the words to continue. He silently stepped back and left the great hall, only to see a woman clad in jade armor standing outside. She held a spear in her arms and stood as if she had been listening for some time.

Her almond-shaped eyes rose slightly as she spoke calmly, "I’ll escort you out, senior."

A Yuan Huyuan shuddered. As a Foundation Establishment cultivator who had barely reached his level through medicinal pills, his strength was absolutely inferior to Li Qinghong. If it came to a fight, he wasn’t sure he could last more than a few rounds against her.

Swallowing hard, he stammered, "Ah, it’s you, Qinghong."

Li Qinghong rose into the wind alongside him, her voice steady and even, "If your family must throw its lot in with the Chi family, it is understandable. But the means you’ve employed are far too underhanded. Surely, years of friendship between our families did not have to end this way."

Yuan Huyuan sighed deeply, his voice laden with sorrow.

Li Qinghong paused briefly before continuing, "Your family has wronged ours, Yuan Chengdun, and Qingsui Peak all in one stroke. You’ve not only severed the ties between our families but also caused us to lose credibility with Yuan Chengdun. If you have the slightest shred of goodwill toward my family, I ask that you spare Yuan Fuyao’s life."

Yuan Huyuan now understood that his schemes had almost entirely been seen through. He said quietly, "Yuan Fuyao will come to no harm. He’s being closely watched. You may rest assured."

Li Qinghong cupped her fists in salute before riding a bolt of lightning back toward the Li estate, leaving Yuan Huyuan to fly off alone. As he soared through the sky, memories of his decades-long friendship with Li Yuanjiao and Li Xuanxuan swirled in his mind. He felt a growing sense of desolation.

He muttered to himself, "It’s just... just that Sword Immortal Li once defeated Chi Zhiyun with a single strike, and the Li family’s growing closeness with the Xiao family has long left the Chi family uneasy. How could they tolerate me preserving my old alliances? If I weren’t ruthless, how could I silence the Chi family’s jibes?"

He looked out at the horizon, his heart hollow and adrift. The image of Li Yuexiang’s smiling face and her calm, measured words suddenly surfaced in his mind, sending a shiver through him.

"Li Yuanjiao was a viper at heart. His daughter is probably no different... Why, of all families, did it have to be the Li family?"

If Yuan Huyuan had been given the choice, the Li family would have been the last among his relatives and allies that he would wish to offend. But he was a man adrift in turbulent waters, with no other options. Head bowed in resignation, he pressed forward, silent and alone.

----

Li Qinghong descended gracefully into the courtyard, carried by the wind. Inside, a few people were deep in conversation. Li Xijun gave her a small nod, acknowledging their seamless coordination despite having made no prior arrangements.

Li Xuanxuan broke the silence.

"We still don’t know the fate of Yuan Chengdun and Yuan Tuan. Even if they return now, it’s likely too late to salvage anything. But I did give Yuan Chengdun my word... And what are we supposed to do about Yuan Fuyao running away? It's not like we can send people and drag him back. "

Li Xijun gestured dismissively. "Yuexiang’s agreement was originally based on Yuan Fuyao staying willingly. Who could have predicted that Yuan Huyuan would act this way? Even Yuan Chengdun didn’t foresee this... His cultivation is among the best, but how could he outmatch a wily old fox like Yuan Huyuan when it comes to political schemes?"

He stopped for a moment, then added in a softer tone, "From now on, that man has nothing to do with our family. There’s no need to mention him again."

Turning to his sister, he sighed and said, "I’m afraid you’ve been wronged in all this... The Yuan family’s attempt to sever ties with us will undoubtedly stir up rumors and gossip."

Li Yuexiang, seated quietly at the table, offered a serene smile and shook her head.

She said, "It’s nothing to worry about. People will only ridicule the Yuan family for their inconsistency, and Yuan Fuyao for his lack of discernment."
