# Chapter 831: Cold

Moongaze Lake was a far cry from its usual tranquility. A joyous, festive atmosphere pulsed through the air as the island's many halls were draped in crimson. Figures of great importance within the clan moved back and forth, signaling an event of grand celebration.

Dressed in red robes, Li Zhouming stood in the main hall, a proud and contented look on his face. Beside him, in a great jade chair, sat an old man in dark red robes, his white hair a stark contrast to his smiling face.

"Father... I've made you proud this time, haven't I?"

Li Zhouming's mother had passed away long ago, leaving only his father to witness this day. Li Chengzhi, who had already lost most of his teeth to age, merely shot his son a look.

"This marriage was arranged by your grandfather. What's there to be proud of?"

Despite his words, Li Chengzhi couldn't hide the pride in his heart. Seeing his son marry a powerful Foundation Establishment cultivator, a direct descendant of an immortal sect, was a source of deep satisfaction. The smile was plain on his face as he watched his son go to welcome the bride. He downed two more cups of wine, his face flushing with the heat.

Li Chengzhi was well-regarded in the clan, and as a member of the direct Purple Mansion Realm lineage, he commanded respect. Furthermore, Li Zhouming was a direct descendant of the main branch. The combination of these statuses made his wedding even more magnificent than that of the Clan Head. Every notable figure on the lake had come to attend.

The old man raised his eyes for a moment, scanning the crowd. He figured his own father, Li Ximing, wouldn't be coming. He settled back into his chair, unbothered. He was used to it.

Ever since he was deemed unable to cultivate at the age of six, his father had cast him from his thoughts. If he had possessed even a single spiritual aperture, no matter how poor his talent, he might have learned a trade. But as a mortal, he was confined to the foot of the mountain. The clan's rules had been even stricter then. To put it bluntly, Li Chengzhi considered himself a man who had suffered. The bitterness and hardship he'd endured were no less than what his cultivating brothers had faced.

Because of this, he’d never felt much connection to the clan's order or its legacy. It wasn't until Li Zhouming was born that something truly changed within him. He might offer a little help to his other children, direct or otherwise, but he didn't obsess over their fortunes. Only Li Zhouming was different. For him, he had swallowed his pride and begged Li Ximing, desperate to arrange the best possible future for his son. As for his other children who had been sent away, he no longer had the heart to manage their affairs.

From that day forward, Li Chengzhi stopped judging his father so harshly. He had, after all, become the same kind of man himself. With that realization, everything was forgiven. Li Chengzhi had to admit, he had just drawn a line of validation through a lifetime of his own pain.

The sound of gongs and drums filled the hall as the newlyweds entered amidst a chorus of congratulations. Seated in the seat of honor, the old man drank the wine his new daughter-in-law offered him. In that moment, he could no longer concern himself with who was right or wrong, nor could he distinguish between truths and falsehoods. Seeing Li Zhouming in his brilliant red robes, a searing heat coursed through him. His eyes reddened, and only one thought surfaced.

"Just be good to each other. That's all that matters. It's just a shame... I probably won't live long enough to see your children."

Though Li Zhouming could be playful, he was a good person at heart and easily moved. He couldn't bear to hear such words, and on this day of great joy, he nearly broke down in tears, letting out a few choked sounds.

The torrent of rituals and the press of the crowd swept away his sorrow, and soon he was swept away to the next location, his cheerful mood restored.

Once Li Zhouming left, the hall fell silent. The boisterous crowd had moved on, and a cold wind began to blow through the grand space. The jade chair beneath him felt icy and sharp. With the effects of the wine now fading, Li Chengzhi felt a deep chill seep into his bones.

'These jade chairs are made for cultivators, after all,' he thought. 'So terribly cold…'

## The Main Hall of the Continent

Figures hurried through the great hall. An old man dressed in black ascended several flights of stairs, finally arriving in the spacious chamber. He knelt and bowed respectfully.

"Reporting to the Clan Head," he said. "Both Midong and Brahma Cloud Cave are searching for the token. The Brahma Cloud Cave has even sent a direct disciple from the Chengyun Gate to personally oversee the matter. The whole Sanxi region is in an uproar; they're making quite a scene."

Above him, Li Jiangqian sat with his eyes closed, pinching his fingers together in a meditative gesture. Wisps of Li Fire trickled from his lips as if he were practicing a technique. Hearing the report, he opened his eyes.

"Good," he said.

The Baijiang Creek in the Sanxi region of Jiangbei was divided among three powers. Besides the Li Clan's Funan and the Capital immortals Dao's Midong, the remaining territory belonged to the Brahma Cloud Cave, a vassal of the Chengyun Gate. The arrival of a direct disciple was certainly not about finding some token; it was a clear signal that the Chengyun Gate tacitly supported the arrangement.

This was undoubtedly excellent news. Without the approval of a Purple Mansion Realm power, Li Jiangqian had felt a persistent lack of confidence.

As for why the old man only mentioned Midong and Brahma Cloud Cave searching for the token—omitting the Li Clan's Funan—it was because Funan was sparsely populated. The cultivators sent there were subject to term assessments and had no opportunity to abandon their posts for a treasure hunt. Whether the various forces under the Li Clan's governance were making a move was a matter for Qingdu and Yuting.

Li Jiangqian considered for a moment. He felt the time was ripe. There was only one year and five months left until the sixth month of the twenty-second year of Shenxuan's reign.

"Have you... received any news from Midong?" he asked in a low voice.

Qu Bushi was currently responsible for communicating with the Capital immortals Dao. The old man was flexible and knew how to think on his feet. He had also met Guan Gongxiao before and knew some of the inside details.

"I received a verbal message this morning," Qu Bushi replied. "They said the candidates have been chosen, but the token's whereabouts are still unknown. Lord Guan Gongxiao mentioned... that if he were to 'find' it himself, it probably wouldn't look authentic."

"As for the candidates, Lord Guan first selected a Daoist from the Southern Sea. He cultivates on a mountain there and is skilled in using venomous creatures and fierce beasts. He cultivates the 'Locust Shade Ghost' technique and goes by the Daoist name Bai. The other is a cultivator from the Northern Sea who cultivates the Bound Earth dao. His foundation is unknown, but his surname is Huang."

Guan Gongxiao had specified the two candidates for two reasons. First, to ask if there were any issues with his choices. Second, to inform the Li Clan, preventing them from accidentally making contact with the chosen individuals and ruining the plan.

As for Guan Gongxiao finding the token himself, it simply meant the Capital immortals Dao would forge one. However, their tradition was not known for artifact refinement, so any creation of theirs would lack authenticity and would be difficult to pass off.

Li Jiangqian thought it over. "Go back and tell fellow Daoist Guan this: however many candidates they have, they should find a way to invite them over. Once they are established in the area, a token will naturally appear for them. If not, we will consider other options."

He paused, adding, "But the Three Rivers region needs to be thrown into chaos. It's too stable right now, which doesn't suit our purposes."

Having received his orders, Qu Bushi immediately withdrew. Li Jiangqian was lost in thought for a while longer before another report came from below, announcing that Chen Yang was waiting outside.

"Have Protector Chen come up," he instructed.

Soon, the black-robed Chen Yang strode in from outside. Despite his constant travels, his cultivation had advanced rapidly, and thanks to his immortal foundation, his aura was exceptionally potent.

"Greetings, Clan Head," he said respectfully. "This subordinate has a matter to report. The Sacred Writ Gate has sent someone with a gift."

Li Jiangqian's brow furrowed. His perception was razor-sharp. "What kind of gift requires a Protector to deliver it?"

The question cut straight to the heart of the matter, its insight almost startling. But Chen Yang was no simple character. He lowered his head and answered respectfully.

"When the Clan Head sent me to the Sacred Writ Gate to offer condolences, they treated me with great courtesy. Perhaps they felt they could establish a rapport with me, so they sent someone hoping to inquire about our clan's disposition through me. The Sacred Writ Gate wishes... to form a marriage alliance with Moongaze Lake."

"The messenger waited for me by the lake during my patrol and approached me when we were alone, presenting the gift. I was caught completely off guard and did not dare to be negligent. I haven't even replied to them. I came straight to the main hall to report!"

The Sacred Writ Gate's intentions were clear. Anyone else might have made some inquiries on their behalf, perhaps speaking of the current situation and accepting the gift. Reporting such a thing to the Clan Head could be awkward, after all. But they had the misfortune of running into Chen Yang, who brought the matter directly to the highest authority.

"No wonder," Li Jiangqian murmured, nodding slightly.

Some time ago, when Chen Yang went to the Sacred Writ Gate for Kong Guli's funeral, the Kong family had refused to see him, which was expected. But the Xuanmu Daoist tradition had not made things difficult for him. Instead, a direct disciple had welcomed him, praised him, and treated him with courtesy throughout.

Li Jiangqian had initially thought it was due to their connection with Purple Smoke, but now it seemed they were here to propose a marriage.

"So that's what they were waiting for," he said with a slight, intrigued smile. "Who is the proposal for, and which of our own are they asking for?"

Chen Yang reported in a solemn voice, "The Sacred Writ Gate is proposing on behalf of their most outstanding direct disciple, Dai Jinquan. However, his age is a bit advanced, so they asked me to gauge your opinion. If the clan has reservations, they will make other arrangements. As for who they wish to marry... they briefly mentioned Lady Xinghan."

Strictly speaking, the wilderness was vast and a crossroads for many powers. The Sacred Writ Gate and the Li Clan had no significant territorial conflicts. Furthermore, the relationship between Purple Smoke and Moongaze Lake was currently on the rise. It was perfectly reasonable for Daoist Master Zhu Gong to want to strengthen ties.

But while the Sacred Writ Gate's thinking was sound, Li Jiangqian had a low opinion of their Xuanmu Daoist tradition. Daoist Master Zhu Gong was a dignified Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, sought after by thousands.

'Whether Daoist Master Zhu Gong's divine abilities are vast remains to be seen,' he thought, 'but either her mind isn't on managing her sect, or she has other plans. The Xuanmu Daoist tradition is a mess. Their inherent flaws haven't been purged, and their methods are crude. I've also heard they are arrogant and domineering toward smaller clans, relying entirely on Zhu Gong's personal prestige to stay afloat…'

'Furthermore, while the Dai family might not be generational demonic cultivators, they came from the Eastern Sea and have a poor reputation. They also cultivate Earth Virtue, and I've never heard of any outstanding members from their line. Although Dai Jinquan is at the Foundation Establishment Realm, he is similarly unknown. If he hadn't come to the lake to inquire before, I would never have even heard his name…'

Both sects had relocated from the Eastern Sea, but in terms of both their Daoist traditions and personal relationships, the Sacred Writ Gate couldn't compare to the Chengyun Gate. Moreover, to suddenly propose a marriage at this specific time... who knew what troubles might be waiting down the road?

The Sacred Writ Gate was only making an inquiry. If Li Jiangqian showed any interest and let slip any hint of it, Zhuang Pingye would likely pack his bags and slip away in shame. Otherwise, Zhuang Cheng would have to come to their door to apologize.

Fortunately, Li Jiangqian was not fond of the Xuanmu Daoist tradition. Having considered all angles, he felt not the slightest temptation.

"You will simply reply to them," he said, "that the Xuanmu Daoist tradition of the Purple Mansion Realm is noble, but the Daoist Master is not home, and her elders are seriously injured and in seclusion. There is no one in the clan with the authority to make such a decision."

"You know how to phrase it. Just say it's your own speculation; don't involve the clan."

Chen Yang understood perfectly. "As for the gift they sent..."

Li Jiangqian waved his hand. "Whatever gift they brought, you can deal with it as you see fit."

"This subordinate has already had it sent to the side hall."

Chen Yang's reply was seamless. As he was about to withdraw, Li Jiangqian stopped him.

"After you've replied to the eastern sect, make a trip to Funan. Jianglong is handling an extremely important matter over there. He has yet to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, so his authority is ultimately limited. You are thorough and cautious. Go and help him."

He picked up a scroll decree that was already prepared on his desk and handed it to Chen Yang. "The clan has an abundance of Foundation Establishment cultivators now," he said gravely. "Take my order and have Miaoshui and An Siwei also travel to the wilderness. Have them station themselves on the riverbank to guard the north."

This was not only to provide backup for Li Jianglong, but also to prepare for the future "confrontation" with the Capital immortals Dao in Funan and on the river. Sending a few people over just before the enemy's planned attack would seem far too prescient and would give them away.

Chen Yang hesitated slightly. "Is there something amiss with the situation in Funan...?"

Li Jiangqian knew Chen Yang's mind was racing. He waved his hand again. "Don't overthink it. When you get there, ask Jianglong for the details. Spare no effort in helping the Second Young Master see this matter through. If there are any mistakes, it will endanger both of your lives."

At these words, Chen Yang's expression changed dramatically. He bowed and retreated. A thought flickered through Li Jiangqian's mind.

'Protector White Ape has been in seclusion for years. He and the clan's elders were heavily injured back then. He should be close to recovery. I need to check on him through the formation array, lest something happens without my knowledge.'

After sending Chen Yang to the north, Li Jiangqian still had many matters to attend to. Although the wedding of his Purple Mansion Realm descendant's uncle was over, there were countless arrangements to handle. He was busy making notes on various memorials when a report came from below. A white-haired old man in a dark blue robe entered the hall.

Li Jiangqian quickly rose from the main seat and came down to support him, but Li Xuanxuan waved him off. The old man's face was grim. "Azure Pond Sect has issued some kind of order," he began. "Li Quantao has been urgently recalled from the north. He's returned in less than half the time he'd mentioned. He passed by Moongaze Lake but didn't even have time to stop and rest. He only left a letter."

"The letter was delivered by one of the lake's patrol cultivators... You should take a look."

"Li Quantao?"

Azure Pond Sect's assignments typically lasted for five years. Li Quantao had been on some important mission; he had even discussed the matter of Chi Zhiyun when he passed by the lake before. Now, only a year and a half later, he had been urgently recalled. Li Jiangqian frowned, a knot of unease tightening in his chest.

'Just after we mentioned his son being used as a weapon, he's urgently recalled... Please don't let this be about Chi Buzi's return…'

Although Chi Buzi's actions were cold-blooded and merciless, he was, after all, a Purple Mansion Daoist Master who commanded four divine abilities. Such a powerful direct descendant of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition would rank among the top five in all of Jiangnan. Moreover, this "Precious Tree of the Chi Clan" was still young. If Chi Buzi returned, it would surely throw Azure Pond Sect into utter chaos.

He took the letter from the old man's hand, his expression serious. He opened it and saw that the contents were brief. The beginning was filled with polite inquiries and greetings. On the next page, however, the handwriting became much more frantic, and the message was bizarre:

*'On the twenty-second day of the tenth month, a sudden cold fell upon Yi Mountain City. Pine and cypress sprouted from bare rock as frost blanketed the ground. Then came a blizzard, burying the plains in over sixteen feet of snow. Hailstones the size of basins rained down, shattering trees and killing countless birds and beasts.'*
