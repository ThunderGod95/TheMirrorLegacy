# Chapter 677: The Majestic Jeweled Visage

That sentence struck Fu Xia like a bolt of heavenly thunder. A flood of memories washed over him, and many of his earlier doubts began to clear. His voice was grave.

"Then why," he demanded, "are you so stubborn and unenlightened?"

"Unenlightened?"

Kongheng shook his head with a smile. "The next day, when I returned to the temple, I had forgotten every word the Mahas had spoken. I opened the scriptures to read, but as I looked upon them, the texts blurred before my eyes. The characters themselves leaped from the pages, one after another, and fled toward the lands of Zhao and Yan."

"I turned to look and saw the entire courtyard filled with a dense swarm of characters, like refugees from a famine, running hand-in-hand. A sea of words flowed down the mountain and vanished over the endless horizon."

"That night, every classic and scripture in Liaohe Temple turned to blank paper."

His words echoed slowly in the air. Li Ximing's face finally showed a glimmer of understanding. Kongheng gave a self-deprecating laugh.

"And that is why I am the worst at doctrinal debate."

Fu Xia was finally silent, sitting quietly. Kongheng continued in his warm voice.

"I was only eighteen that year. I had just finished reading the texts on cultivation techniques, interesting anecdotes, and secret histories. I was preparing to start on the scriptures, but from that day forward, there were no books left for me to read."

"Venerable senior, cultivators of all seven paths yearn for the ancient ways of Buddhism, for the chance to ascend to the position of a Revered One. They hope to find the true scriptures through me, but I can give you nothing. I have never read these things. My cultivation, to this day, has relied solely on my own heart for enlightenment."

A look of dawning comprehension crossed Fu Xia's face. He finally understood why Kongheng so often remained silent in the face of his refutations. His voice dropped. "The ancient scriptures are not suited for the modern path anyway."

"Correct," Kongheng said gently.

"I have read the core texts of all seven paths. The Way of Great Desire is boundless; one must first gain then lose in order to seek solemnity. The Way of Wrath manifests phenomena; it pacifies evil to create good, molding a Majestic Jeweled Visage`1. The Way of Adoring the Dharma seeks a realm; it establishes a Buddhist land in the mortal world to deliver all sentient beings."

"The Way of Precepts is one of bitter cold; it recognizes the sea of suffering and thus provides a ferry to cross it. The Way of Goodness and Joy clarifies the heart; it uses joy, anger, and folly to seek something from nothing. The Path of Compassion is held within; it nurtures all beings, and in turn, all beings nurture me. The Way of Emptiness is one of focus; it seeks liberation from the ego for the sake of rebirth..."

Kongheng spoke softly.

"All of you use a Pure Land to gather people."

"Venerable senior, it is not that I don't understand the fundamental principles. I too have entered a Pure Land. Whether the joy of the common people within is real or not, we can set that aside for now."

"But your esteemed path uses the suffering of the mortal world and the joy of the Pure Land to edify the people, to make them forget the material world in pursuit of a state of solemn, tranquil emptiness. But have they truly reached it? Has a single great divine power ever emerged from a Maha's Pure Land? In the end, is the Pure Land a Maha's personal divine property, or is it true liberation, untethered by suffering and joy?"

For the first time, Kongheng’s expression turned utterly serious. There was no anger, no admonishment, only deep contemplation and concern. His fair face, bathed in the five-colored light, seemed infinitely bright.

"It is neither... Venerable senior, it is neither."

Fu Xia stared at him in disbelief. For the first time, a thoughtful expression appeared on the old monk's face. The moment it did, his imposing aura faltered. "There are those who have achieved greatness in the Pure Land," he said coldly, "cultivators like Du'en and Liubai... You..."

Kongheng shook his head. "Have you ever seen them?" he asked softly.

Fu Xia's eyes lit up as he seized on the question. "Just because I have not seen them, does that mean they do not exist?"

"You have seen one," Kongheng replied softly, giving him no ground. Seeing Fu Xia's stunned expression, he pointed gently at the sky and smiled.

"Liubai is right up there."

Forgetting their conflict entirely, Fu Xia slowly raised a trembling head. High above the Radiant Origin Pass, the Six-Armed Vajra Guardian stood, its visage a mask of solemnity, its six arms pressing down firmly on the gate.

"You... How is that possible! Do not try to deceive me with such demonic words!"

Kongheng slowly shook his head, his voice very soft.

"This *is* the Majestic Jeweled Visage. This *is* the state of purity. This *is* the one from the Pure Land who has forgotten both self and the world. When I was eighteen, he came to me from the manifestation of Wrath to aid me. To this day, he has not uttered a single word."

Fu Xia did not know how to respond, lost in a daze of confusion.

"I know what my senior brother wants," Kongheng continued gently. "With the fall of the Four Wrathful Demon Emperor, the lineage of the Way of Wrath is in decline. He wants me to give rise to anger in my heart, to dedicate myself to the manifestation of Wrath, so that I might become a Maha and re-establish the tradition."

"Is that not so?"

After a moment of silence, Fu Xia answered, "It is."

Kongheng's expression was gentle, the light on his face growing ever brighter. He spoke in a kind and reasonable tone.

"And that is the problem. You believe the manifestation of Wrath is a good thing, so you want me to become it, and thus you have come to take me."

"You believe all living things suffer, so you must deliver them all. You must create a Pure Land of ultimate bliss. First, you let all beings endure the depths of suffering, and then you place them all within it, so that you may be revered and thanked."

He asked, "You condescendingly wish to deliver all sentient beings, but have any of them ever asked to be delivered by you?"

"Why would they not?!" Fu Xia's face changed. "The world is so full of suffering, and the Pure Land so full of joy! Take any hundred commoners from the lands of Yan and Zhao, and every single one of them would yearn to enter the Pure Land!"

"That is because their present world is too bitter," Kongheng said softly. "They seek only pleasure. As for the boundless peace, boundless purity, and boundless stability of the Majestic Jeweled Visage—that is not what the people seek. They suffer the seven passions, but they also enjoy the seven passions. A boundless Majestic Jeweled Visage is a boundless image of death. Only when the suffering becomes so great that they wish for death, so great that they no longer even want joy, only then are they willing to enter the Pure Land."

"You believe that everyone wants to enter the Pure Land, but the reality is that everyone is tortured until they have no choice but to want it."

"Nonsense!" Fu Xia retorted. "Who would not want the Majestic Jeweled Visage? Those who do not are simply not at a high enough spiritual state!"

Kongheng stood up. His voice remained soft and gentle.

"The Majestic Jeweled Visage is a state of boundless, ultimate tranquility. Every image is the same. It reacts to every situation in the exact same way. It is the same person. If ten thousand people cultivate it, it is really just one person occupying ten thousand bodies. Venerable senior Fu Xia, that is not how one cultivates a Revered One."

"In the name of cultivating a Revered One, you use a vast land of joy to delude millions, hoping to use the puppets of the Majestic Jeweled Visage to possess all of their souls! Meanwhile, you yourselves retain your seven passions and six desires, sitting high above, laughing at the world and calling it ignorant!"

"And there are those even more foolish, who in the end use the Majestic Jeweled Visage to possess themselves! Millions become one boundless, tranquil, pure, and stable image of death!"

Fu Xia stared at him, his voice hoarse. "Is that what the ancient scriptures say?"

Kongheng looked at him quietly, his voice warm.

"That is what I say."

As Kongheng's voice fell, the searing Radiant Fire began to climb his body. Li Ximing's urgent calls echoed again and again. Suddenly, Fu Xia's expression changed, all traces of conflict vanishing. He gazed at Kongheng, and his old face was filled with sincerity. Clear tears streamed from his eyes.

"If that is the case, then why does Kongheng not become a Maha?"

"Since all seven paths are wrong, Kongheng should ascend to the rank of Maha, establish a true Pure Land of his own, and teach the world the path to infinite liberation! He can turn this filthy world on its head and create the First and Truest Pure Land!"

"My Lord, return to the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple! We are willing to serve as your vanguards!"
