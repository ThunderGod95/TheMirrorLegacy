# Chapter 980: Repayment

The man was none other than Helian Wujiang!

The ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom and the man responsible for the Helian family's resurgence looked grim. The light of pursuit behind him was closing in fast. Li Zhouwei's interception had placed him in grave danger.

To make matters worse, he recalled his mission to Caishan all those years ago under Wei Xuanyin's orders. He had exchanged a few pleasantries, something about witnessing the "might of the Imperial Scion." It seemed this White Qilin had long held a grudge for the injuries Li Ximing sustained and was here today to make him pay!

'This boy... he's called a White Qilin, but he has all the cunning of a Red Cicada. All those times by the riverbank, I never heard him utter a single threat. Yet when he strikes, it's sudden, and the bite chills you to the bone!'

With things having reached this point, Helian Wujiang let out a long breath. He raised his long whip in one hand and tore at the robes on his back with the other. Circulating his Baleful Qi, he tapped the ground lightly. In an instant, endless black shadows surged from behind him, blanketing the area. The surroundings transformed into a demonic baleful domain as over a hundred towering peaks of Baleful Qi manifested, thrusting into the sky.

'Rakshasa Sea.'

'Incessant Calamity.'

He knew this wouldn't end peacefully, not with pursuers at his back. He attacked with his full strength from the outset. Within this demonic domain, baleful winds howled. Streams of black energy wove between the Baleful Qi peaks, emitting ear-piercing shrieks. As the churning winds coiled around him, Li Zhouwei raised his halberd and shot across the sky.

Helian Wujiang's whip lashed out with incredible speed, coiling like a venomous serpent through the air. Amidst the golden flash of Li Zhouwei's attack, the whip keenly bound something, causing Helian Wujiang's arm to drop heavily. He had snagged the Grand Ascension Halberd!

Helian Wujiang was extremely confident in his whip. The spiritual item used to refine it could withstand the sharpest of Spiritual Artifacts. Having snared Grand Ascension, he even felt a trace of ease.

But Li Zhouwei abruptly yanked the halberd, pulling the Spiritual Artifact whip taut. The sudden force caused Helian Wujiang to stiffen for a fraction of a second. In that instant, the golden-white Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light erupted from between Li Zhouwei's brows, transforming into a single, all-penetrating golden beam within the dark, wind-swept world!

He snapped his head around. The beam of golden-white Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light swept out like a peerlessly sharp, handleless spiritual blade. It nearly severed the Baleful Qi pervading the world in two. One after another, the peaks of Baleful Qi were sliced apart, collapsing into roiling clouds of malevolence with a series of deafening booms.

Helian Wujiang's expression darkened, but he refused to release the whip. A dim light gathered between his brows. He snapped his head up and roared:

"Hah!"

The ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom was no easy opponent. With that shout, three circular black runes appeared between his brows, and his eyes turned a deep, abyssal black. Torrents of black fire and white-gold light rained down around him as radiant balefulness flared. A massive baleful phantom materialized behind him.

This baleful phantom drove a chariot, clad in bronze armor and wielding a long saber. An iron core hovered at its brow. Wherever the chariot passed, black fire and white-gold light erupted, rivers flowed backward, and the entire baleful sea began to boil!

This display finally forced a woman out of the sky. She wore gauze robes and had a pure, clear face. It was Daoist Master Xiang Chun who had been pursuing him. She frowned slightly, and the precious orb behind her lit up once more, suppressing all the baleful light with ripples of Valley Water.

Li Zhouwei had spotted her location long ago. His blast of Heavenly Light from his brow, which had cleared the baleful sea, was meant to give her a chance to sneak close to Helian Wujiang. Unfortunately, Helian Wujiang's Dao arts were profound. He likely possessed Dao-Profundity in his eyes as well, allowing him to see through the attempt instantly.

The baleful phantom spanning the sky was already pressing down, bringing with it a turbid current. Its long saber fell from the sky, chopping toward Li Zhouwei! Only then did Helian Wujiang release his whip, turning to defend against the woman's Valley Water light.

Sunless Deceit!

"Boom!"

Li Zhouwei inverted his halberd. A torrent of black light flowed from the weapon he held, branching outward. At his command, the Sun's Resonant Radiance Art activated. Rolling light of the Supreme Yang and Radiant Fire spiraled around him, surging up his body to the very tip of the halberd's blade, illuminating the area with brilliant radiance.

"Clang!"

The halberd immediately flipped, shifting from a block to a sweep. In the span of a breath, he clashed with the baleful phantom dozens of times, setting off explosions of Heavenly Light and Radiant Fire. Li Zhouwei took one step back, dodging the brunt of the phantom's attack. Grand Ascension spun in a full circle, like a golden lightning bolt tearing through the sky. Empowered by the ability of Attachment, it smashed thunderously into the baleful phantom!

The massive body instantly exploded in a blinding mix of radiance and balefulness. Li Zhouwei planted his halberd, raising his other hand to his chest. He brought two fingers together, and the colorful clouds in the sky above parted, revealing blinding Heavenly Light.

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

Daoist Master Xiang Chun cultivated Valley Water. She excelled at self-preservation, healing, and escape. However, her offensive power was inferior even to Murong Yan's. If she truly had any effective restraining techniques, she wouldn't have let Helian Wujiang retreat all the way here.

In that mere instant, Helian Wujiang had already transformed into a baleful wind, intending to flee. Audience with the Celestial Gate immediately shone down from above, forcing him to dispel the Dharma wind. His Baleful Qi roiled, flickering in and out of form in mid-air.

At that exact moment, an old man suddenly appeared within the churning baleful wind. He looked ancient and was only at the early-stage Purple Mansion Realm, shrouded in a bright white Dharma light. But in his hand, he held a violet-lightning jade bell that looked extraordinary. The moment he appeared, a massive thunderstorm descended, and eighteen bolts of lightning struck as one!

"Rumble!"

Helian Wujiang had already been forced to reposition twice. The lightning was astonishingly fast. He finally failed to dodge the attack and let out a muffled grunt amidst the rolling thunder, coughing up a mouthful of blood and causing the surrounding Baleful Qi to seethe.

The ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom was finally enraged. His voice was low and heavy.

"Yu Ming..."

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flickered. He instantly identified the newcomer's cultivation as Jade True. Staring at the brilliant flashes of lightning, a thought crossed his mind:

'An early-stage Purple Mansion Realm Jade True cultivator and a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Valley Water cultivator... No wonder he made it here so easily.'

Before Helian Wujiang could say more, a golden beam of light shot out from the roiling thunderclouds. The bright halberd blade pointed directly at him. Li Zhouwei was attacking again!

Sovereign's Perilous Tread!

Dense, golden, scale-like patterns immediately surfaced on the man's face. Empowered by Sovereign's Perilous Tread, the hastily summoned Baleful Qi was like tattered cloth, offering no resistance at all.

At this critical juncture, Helian Wujiang's hand finally grasped the short blade at his waist.

"Clang!"

An iridescent black light flashed through the air. With a sharp ring, the black short blade struck the tip of Grand Ascension. He had refined this Spiritual Artifact for many years, and its power was terrifying—it had nearly severed Li Ximing's Dharma body back then. Now, slamming into Grand Ascension, it instantly sent the halberd flying high, bending it back as a wave of yin light washed over it, suppressing the weapon.

Helian Wujiang had already drawn the Dharma sword from his waist, stirring the Baleful Qi!

"Boom!"

But just as the baleful radiance flared, a heavy, dim-gray light descended. Sunless Deceit activated, slowing his newly launched spell art mid-cast. Daoist Master Xiang Chun protected herself with her precious orb and blew out a gust of gray wind, while on the other side, the lightning began to gather once more!

Sunless Deceit was truly insidious. It had seemed to be resolved, but it had merely been lying dormant. Its sudden activation completely disrupted Helian Wujiang's plans, and a powerful sense of crisis rose in his heart.

'If I hesitate any longer... I will face certain doom!'

The three black runes on his brow lit up again. The roiling baleful winds, accumulated over many years of cultivation, erupted forth, forming a dense barrier in front of him. With a flick of his sleeve, two white-light jade boxes shot out, riding the gales in different directions.

It was the spiritual items he had obtained!

This immediately made the other two pause. Neither of their families had any feud with the Helian family; they were only here to snatch the spiritual items. Now that he was backing down, why would they offend him to the death? They instantly shot off to grab the items. Helian Wujiang didn't hesitate for a second, activating his Rakshasa Sea at full power to stall Li Zhouwei!

His figure instantly dissolved into a cloud of black balefulness. Seizing the moment the other two had intentionally relaxed their guard, he decisively shot away, tanking the falling lightning and the surging Valley Water!

He had only moved a few body-lengths when the rolling Heavenly Light and colorful clouds descended from the sky. But Helian Wujiang had endured the lightning and Valley Water precisely to save his strength for this moment. Blood essence and Baleful Qi erupted together, shifting his entire Rakshasa Sea dozens of yards to the side, narrowly avoiding the descending celestial gate.

Although his face was growing pale, his speed amidst the gloom was extreme. He was about to escape!

His technique was marvelous, but it was just like Helian Wumeng's back then. If Helian Wujiang could use his experience to predict a Bright Yang suppression art, how could Li Zhouwei, having seen the Helian family's spell arts once before, not be prepared?

Immediately, strands of fine, silk-like white light rained down from the sky.

Radiant Celestial Wave Art!

Li Zhouwei had already descended on a beam of light, crashing into the Baleful Qi. His eyes were brilliant gold, staring right at Helian Wujiang through the dense miasma. Helian Wujiang was a master of spell arts, but his close-quarters movement techniques within the Baleful Qi were inferior to Helian Wumeng's. How could he hide? The gaze sent a chill through Helian Wujiang's heart.

"Not good!"

In his bid to escape the encirclement, he had lost all initiative and been constrained at every step. His spiritual blade had just returned to his waist, its power dormant. He had just used his lateral-shift technique, and his baleful light had been seen through. It was an awkward moment, yet he showed no panic. His eyes instantly lit up, releasing a blood-red glow.

The armor on Helian Wujiang's chest immediately split open, revealing a blood-red chest cavity. Black blood roiled as his heart suddenly flipped over, exposing a starkly black-and-white demonic eye on its reverse side.

"Freeze!"

This demonic art was Helian Wujiang's trump card, one of the cornerstones of his many victories and his reputation throughout Mobei. Its power was immense; Li Ximing had suffered greatly against it back then. As it activated, the eye in his heart immediately pulsed with a stuttering, golden, immobilizing light!

The golden light struck Li Zhouwei at extreme speed, but his golden eyes remained cold and tranquil!

The golden, scale-like mystic runes surfaced on his cheeks again, imbuing his face with boundless dignity. The cascading golden light felt like nothing more than a gentle breeze; not only did it fail to root him in place, it actually made the runes on his face shine brighter!

Sovereign's Perilous Tread—to adapt to the moment and return to the proper path.

Helian Wujiang's infallible demonic art had finally failed. He had considered that it might be less effective, but he had never imagined that such a profound technique would be rendered completely useless!

In an instant, his gamble had backfired!

He was caught completely off guard, his pupils shrinking. His lips had only just begun to part, his devouring technique yet to be unleashed, when the brilliant golden halberd pierced through.

"Boom!"

The Baleful Qi exploded skyward as clouds of black smoke billowed out. Helian Wujiang's face went deathly pale, and he coughed up blood. The blade of Grand Ascension had run him through. The golden tip of the halberd emerged from his spine, shining with a dazzling light.

From the front, he had been nearly severed at the waist. The blade had entered exactly at his sea of qi!

What flared up at the same time was the golden Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

This intense, bright radiance burst forth, smashing into him point-blank. It accurately detonated a blast of Bright Yang light on his forehead. In an instant, flesh melted away, revealing stark white bone. The attack dissolved the flesh from half his face, which dissipated as rising wisps of Baleful Qi.

"Bang!"

A torrent of Baleful Qi erupted, shrouding everything in the black, murky baleful sea. Blood light and shadows intertwined. Li Zhouwei's halberd was suddenly empty. All that remained were gusts of baleful wind—formed from Purple Mansion Realm blood—coiling around the shaft, wailing and shrieking.

From within the darkness, a single streak of white light shot out, fleeing in the opposite direction.

Li Zhouwei didn't pursue. He simply reached out, flipped his halberd, and snagged the object just before the other two beams of Dharma light could seize it. With a casual pat, he dispelled the Baleful Qi and divine ability clinging to it and tucked it into his sleeve.

'He's a decisive one, I'll give him that. Willing to take my full attack just to stabilize his mind and activate his escape art... He even calmly threw out the spiritual items to divide our attention.'

Helian Wujiang would be in absolute agony after that blow. Grand Ascension had pierced him, shattered his sea of qi, and the added trauma from Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light had melted half his face. Li Zhouwei calculated coldly:

'This should be enough to repay the injuries my uncle suffered... It's just a pity Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light isn't high-grade enough. It didn't blow his entire head apart. And our two families' Dharma bodies can't be compared. He got off easy...'

Cultivators of the Baleful Qi Daoist Tradition didn't have powerful Dharma Bodies, but their Dharma bodies excelled at transformation, gathering and scattering at will. Even when injured, they were easier to heal. But no matter how easy it was, he absolutely couldn't recover his strength in a short time—especially not in this grotto-heaven, where restorative and containment powers were suppressed, making healing even harder.

'He'll have almost no share of the harvests to come.'

As he mused, the Illuminating Sun and Moon within Li Zhouwei's body began to shine brightly, slowly releasing divine ability and dharma power.

The battle, though brief, had been intense, requiring the continuous use of spell arts and divine abilities. He had consumed nearly twenty percent of his dharma power. But with his Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities, after only a moment's rest, his own dharma power began to recover. Aided by Illuminating Sun and Moon, it was regenerating at an extremely rapid pace.

More importantly, Illuminating Sun and Moon was steadily advancing his Dao-Profundity. Profound vistas of the Bright Yang surfaced in Li Zhouwei's mind, causing him to space out for a moment. To avoid looking strange, he immediately turned his head and smiled.

"Fellow Daoists!"

The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators materialized. Daoist Master Xiang Chun had, of course, recognized him long ago. Compared to the cold indifference she showed other cultivators, her attitude toward him was relatively gentle, though her eyes still held a deep shock. She nodded slightly.

"Thank you for your help, Fellow Daoist... We have all gained something."

Xiang Chun was well aware of Helian Wujiang's strength. Her earlier pursuit was mostly out of annoyance that he was hoarding everything. She had been debating whether to use a trump card to force him to share, but she never expected things to end this way. Suppressing the strange look in her eyes, she turned her head slightly to introduce the other.

"This is Daoist Master Yu Ming of the Jiangbei Shen Clan."

Li Zhouwei had heard his Daoist title before. He was an elder Daoist Master, an Alchemist from the previous generation. Clearly, his lifespan was at its limit, and he had come here to try his luck. Li Zhouwei bowed respectfully and replied:

"The Shen Clan and my family have friendly relations. I have long heard of your great name."

With Yue Cultivating Sect having sealed its mountain, Jiangbei had been an unsettled land for many years. For the Shen Clan to protect itself to this day, they clearly had their methods. Daoist Master Yu Ming smiled and replied. Daoist Master Xiang Chun then smiled faintly and asked:

"I've heard some news. Due east of here, there is a massive formation spanning the sky. Many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are gathered there... I wonder, Fellow Daoist... are you interested?"
