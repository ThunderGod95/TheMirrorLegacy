# Chapter 1010: Profound Incense

Heavenly Light flickered over Gardenia Scenery Mountain. A Daoist Master in platinum-white robes sat at the head of the table amidst billowing white flowers. Opposite him, a middle-aged man in azure robes sat in silence, his hand resting on his cup.

"Daoist Friend Qinghu, you seem to be in high spirits."

Li Ximing, occupying the host's seat, watched him with a smile, though he sighed inwardly.

'A far cry from the man who fled Moongaze in such a hurry not long ago. He’s so calm and composed now. He must have secured the backing of the Underworld.'

It was quite the coincidence. Si Yuanli had arrived here less than an hour after Li Zhouwei departed from Moongaze Lake. Li Ximing simply waited for him to speak first.

Si Yuanli returned the smile, clearly in a good mood, though his tone was self-deprecating.

"You’re too kind, Zhaojing. It’s not that I’m at ease, it’s that I don’t even have a sect gate to return to. With nowhere else to go, I thought I’d take a stroll by the lake…"

His words made Li Ximing set down his cup. "A sect gate?" he chuckled. "Why would you be worried about that? Your skills are impressive, my friend."

Si Yuanli’s sect had always been the Azure Pond Sect; where else could it be? By claiming to have no sect gate, he was hinting that he had already pledged allegiance to the Yang Clan and would not have to enter the Pristine Merging Owl Pool!

This was clearly good news, and Li Ximing’s playful jab was exactly what Si Yuanli wanted to hear. He stroked his beard and laughed.

"I'll take that as a blessing… As for my skills…"

He let out a soft sigh.

"This has nothing to do with skill. It is an inheritance from my predecessors. Every sip, every peck—it was all fated long ago."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"And what of Daoist Friend Ning Wan?"

At the mention of Ning Wan, a flash of admiration crossed Si Yuanli’s face.

"She has found her own path as well. Senior Yuansu made arrangements for her. While it may not guarantee her survival, if she can hold on until the day the new dynasty is established, her crisis will immediately be resolved…"

Li Ximing was a little surprised but also relieved. Si Yuanli then changed the subject with a smile.

"I saw Si Xunhui a few days ago and asked about his situation. Now that Jiangnan is gradually being pacified, he intends to return to the Yue State to serve. I was wondering… what are the arrangements for Li Queyi?"

It was a natural course of action. The Si family was short on talent, and while Si Tongyi was capable, his innate aptitude was lacking. Si Xunhui was their only truly outstanding figure; his noble birth and the fact that his master's wife was from the Yang family meant there was no reason for him not to return.

The Li family, however, was in a different position. Li Ximing currently had a good relationship with Kuang Yu and intended to grow closer to the circle of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the southeastern seas. Furthermore, the Li family's standing was not the same as the Si family's. He had no intention of calling her back.

"That boy Si Xunhui has profound fortune. His return is a good thing, of course," Li Ximing sighed. "But Queyi is highly regarded by Kuang Yu. There isn't really a place for her if she comes back. We elders shouldn't put her in a difficult position."

Si Yuanli understood perfectly.

'‘Not making things difficult for _her_?’ he thought. ‘More like not making things difficult for _you_, Zhaojing.’'

He nodded.

"Although they'll have to live apart, it’s for the best if they each have their own path of development. The Yang Clan bestows its grace far and wide, paying particular attention to the southern and eastern seas. There will be opportunities for them to connect in the future."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing smiled.

"And how are they showing this favor?"

Si Yuanli paused, running through the details in his mind. Concluding it wasn't a great secret, he shook his head and said:

"It concerns Shitang… The Azure Pond Sect has been left a sliver of hope. The reason it hasn't been forced to close is because of Shitang. Once Daoist Master Zhusheng’s matter is settled, the Southern Sea is bound to see some changes."

The mention of Daoist Master Zhusheng of the Southern Sea made everything click for Li Ximing. During the conflict over the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, Daoist Master Suiguan had specifically asked Ning Wan to lure him to Jiangbei to get him deeply involved. Once the Underworld secured this powerful figure, the matter of Shitang would be much easier to handle!

Li Ximing nodded, his expression unchanged, but Si Yuanli was inwardly celebrating.

'Good thing I was decisive and settled Si Xunhui’s future early on. I can be much more open about things now. Once news from Simin Prefecture gets out, Chen Yin will definitely come seeking connections.'

'And the Li family has always been strict about its bloodline. They're obviously holding on to Li Queyi. If they have to choose a significant figure from their clan for a marriage alliance, they might have to marry a daughter to a son of Bright Yang… That will be a real headache for him!'

Li Zhouwei was impressive, but his future was uncertain. Marrying a daughter to a son of Bright Yang might not be a blessing. At this thought, Si Yuanli felt a surge of satisfaction and smiled.

"The new dynasty is about to be established, and with it, a new political order… This dynasty will be founded on True Qi… and the path of True Qi enhances one's cultivation and empowers divine abilities. Securing a few official positions for the younger generation would likely be of great benefit to their practice!"

"What are your thoughts on this, my friend?"

Li Ximing understood his meaning perfectly, but while he was interested, he wasn't overly enthusiastic.

'The core disciples of my family all possess a Talisman Seed. Firstly, there's no need to send them into the court. Secondly, I don't know what the consequences would be. At most, I might send three or five talented disciples who haven't received a Talisman Seed to Simin to try their luck.'

He deliberately avoided taking the bait and chuckled.

"We all have our own circumstances. We're one family, after all. With harmony among us Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, there can be no major disputes among those below."

Si Yuanli shook his head with a sigh.

"You can't be so sure. We’re all friendly now, but who knows what the future holds? Even if the Purple Mansion Realm masters are harmonious, it's not unheard of for the younger generation to compete for their own interests…"

"It's just a shame my clan's descendants are so disappointing. We sent so many of our children in, but in the end, only Tongyi managed to contribute, and only because of his connections in the immortal sect… I can’t compare to you… But if there’s a need for assistance in the future, I may have to ask for your help…"

Li Ximing had no desire to get entangled in the Si family’s affairs. With Li Zhouwei not yet back, he couldn't even gauge his own family's standing in the new dynasty. He just shook his head and sighed.

"That’s hard to say… Jiangliang is not one to think of family. Given the current situation, who would he dare to side with? He’s the only one from my family who went, so we don't have much influence. I can’t really ask anything of him now."

"Besides…"

He smiled and retorted:

"Aren't all his subordinates your people?"

Si Yuanli gave an awkward laugh and quickly changed the subject.

"I came here this time… with another matter to ask you about…"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow as Si Yuanli continued with a smile.

"An elder in my family has an old friend named Ping Yan who cultivates on Yinzhou Island. Recently, he received a request. I hear it came from a dignitary at the Lotus Temple, who asked me to act as a go-between to trade for a treasure from your esteemed clan."

Li Ximing was somewhat surprised, but a hint of delight emerged. He asked:

"Could it be Great Master Minghui?"

That Minghui was as fickle as the weather. The Lotus Temple was also the Buddhist lineage most deeply entangled with immortal cultivators, having acted as a broker in several collaborations between the two factions. Li Ximing had met him once before, regarding a trade for several Enlightened Artifacts the Li family had seized.

But later, as the conflict between north and south intensified, the Chengyun Gate—their only link to Minghui—was relocated deep into the northern territories, and they lost contact. He never expected the monk to be resourceful enough to find his way to Si Yuanli.

As expected, Si Yuanli nodded with a smile.

"Precisely! I imagine you already anticipated this!"

Li Ximing nodded slightly, but his expression grew contemplative.

"I heard that Yinzhou Island is the heartland of the Dragon-kin. Daoist Master Ping Yan must have close ties with them. How is it that he's able to connect with Buddhist cultivators?"

The Dragon-kin had a tense relationship with Luoxia and were not on good terms with the Seven Phases either. The Buddhists often converted demon beasts, which frequently offended the Dragon-kin. Some even coveted the descendants of the Demon Monarch… which earned them the Dragons' utter loathing.

Li Ximing’s question was not surprising to Si Yuanli, who smiled and explained:

"The Dragon-kin are domineering, it’s true, but they still need someone to mediate for them. Some things can't be solved with brute force but can be achieved through diplomacy. Daoist Master Ping Yan cultivates on Yinzhou Island and has a wide network of friends, with connections to all sorts of paths."

A hint of wistfulness, even envy, colored his tone.

"Riding the coattails of the Dragons' might, that senior has made a fortune…"

Li Ximing now understood the situation, but his distrust of Buddhist cultivators remained. He paused for a moment, then frowned.

"Did this Merciful One mention anything specific?"

Si Yuanli quickly replied:

"That I cannot say… It's not appropriate for me to be the middleman here. I am only relaying the message. I've heard that Daoist Master Minghuang has a friendship with a certain Dragon Prince. It shouldn't be difficult to find the right person to arrange this matter!"

His caution was not unfounded. Li Ximing agreed. Only then did Si Yuanli smile, take a jade box from his sleeve, and place it gently on the table.

"I heard you have a Rising Warmth Stone in your possession?"

Li Ximing nodded.

When Wanling Heaven manifested back then, the Li family disciples who entered had reaped a significant harvest. Aside from a few pills, they had obtained the Heart-Taste Baleful Qi of Merging Fire and the Rising Warmth Stone of Blazing Fire.

Si Yuanli smiled.

"Blazing Fire can pacify dampness and dispel rain, rectifying Upright Wood Qi. I wish to cultivate a divine ability called 'Journeying North.' Blazing Fire's ability to pacify dampness and dispel rain is of great benefit. The master of the Tree of One Heart is also in the north, so it would be highly advantageous. Thus, I would like to borrow your Rising Warmth Stone."

Traces of the Blazing Fire lineage were rare. Si Yuanli, true to his family's deep-seated knowledge, understood it well. Li Ximing nodded in silent approval.

"That is correct. Blazing Fire resides in the north, which aligns perfectly with Journeying North. You have a profound grasp of Daoist calculations."

Si Yuanli laughed heartily and pushed the jade box forward.

"The item you mentioned last time… the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill!"

Li Ximing’s eyes lit up. He took the box and opened it. Inside, a wondrous light glowed, guiding one's divine abilities with the marvel of blossoming True Qi. He smiled.

"Aren't I taking advantage of you?"

Both the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill and the Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill were spirit pills famed throughout the world from the ancient Four Secret Dao Lineages. However, the former enhanced divine abilities, making it slightly more valuable. But Si Yuanli demurred.

"You are too kind."

He took the Rising Warmth Stone from Li Ximing's hand and examined it with satisfaction. After taking a small sip of tea, he prepared to stand and take his leave.

"About that matter of the spirit incense…"

"Oh!"

Li Zhouwei had obtained eight golden-veined profound incenses from a grotto-heaven but didn't know their use. Li Ximing had asked Si Yuanli to inquire about them long ago. Now that there was news, he looked up with great interest as Si Yuanli spoke with a smile.

"I asked around for you, and in the end, the only news came from the Peacock Sea! The great personage there has a set as well, though slightly different from yours. It’s called the 'Four Secret Terraces Profound Incense'."

His expression turned serious.

"The Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition, which styles itself Heaven–Governing, often manages incense offerings and rituals. While these things are not common, traces of them can still be found. Your set should have its own name within the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition, but the root is the same. It is a profound incense condensed from incense fire."

"Condensed from incense fire?"

A strange feeling stirred in Li Ximing's heart, but he maintained a thoughtful expression and sighed.

"The way of incense fire is no longer prominent, and the path of ritual has fallen into disuse. They are now mere ceremonies to mourn our predecessors. Does it still have any use?"

"It does!"

Si Yuanli’s tone was firm.

"An ordinary person would have no use for it, but don't forget the north. Don't underestimate this small item. In the eyes of the monks, it's a precious treasure—priceless and unobtainable even with spirit resources!"

Li Ximing nodded, and Si Yuanli smiled.

"Furthermore… some ancient incense-fire artifacts, or some lost secret arts, or a certain lineage of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition… they can all make use of this. The more complete a set from a single source, the better. If you have enough, say one or two hundred sticks, you could even use it to bribe the officials of the netherworld."

He smiled mysteriously.

"Matters of the netherworld can never be neglected… but that doesn't mean they can't be."

The "netherworld" he spoke of was, of course, the Underworld.

Reincarnation was difficult for cultivators. But in theory, if a person's divine abilities were perfected, all five methods were complete, and they had the ability to condense Metallic Essence, the threshold for reincarnation would be significantly lowered. The main consideration then became the Underworld—after all, it encroached upon their interests.

Jiang Boqing, who had caused such a stir in the Yue State back then, was a man of extremely high Dao-Profundity. He had bribed the Underworld and lived freely in Yue State for a time, but was eventually executed due to his connection with the Immortal Scripture.

'Incense fire…'

After pondering for a moment, Li Ximing rose to see him out, remarking casually with a smile:

"One or two hundred sticks? I'm afraid you could empty out all of Wanling Heaven and not find a hundred, let alone a complete set…"

Si Yuanli, who knew a fair bit about Wanling Heaven, nodded in agreement.

'Each ritual site has eight sticks at most, and many were lost in the chaos… having two or three in hand… could be useful for a trade.'

Li Ximing walked him all the way out. Upon returning to the mountain, he opened the jade box again. Seeing the True Qi brimming within and the interplay of multicolored light, he felt a stir in his heart.

'Spirit pills that can help perfect a divine ability are rare. It’s a pity this is for someone from the Southern Sea. Otherwise, with this pill, I would have had a great chance of achieving 'World's Radiance'!'

His first attempt at cultivating 'World's Radiance' had failed. Fortunately, the Li family was lavish in its spending on enhancing divine abilities, providing a full supply of pills every year. Now that he had formed his immortal foundation, he was just waiting to slowly bring it to perfection.

"There's also that 'Upper Shaman' spirit embryo, which I've had for more than ten years. But more important is the spirit armor. I must press for an answer on that."

Refining a spirit embryo was a troublesome task; ten or twenty years was the norm. The Li family, with the Viewing Pavilion's refining methods and their willingness to spare no expense, was much faster. He immediately sent a messenger to Qize.

He settled back into his seat and closed his eyes to cultivate. After only a moment, a brilliant light flashed and converged on the mountain, revealing a youth with golden eyes.

"Minghuang!"

Li Ximing, who had been waiting anxiously, hurried down to meet him.

"How did it go?"

Li Zhouwei smiled at him reassuringly.

"Things are not so bad… Grand-uncle, please rest assured!"

Those words were all Li Ximing needed to feel at ease. He pulled him to sit at the table and sighed.

"Si Yuanli was here earlier. He was beating around the bush, trying to get our family to promise to help him… I suspect… the Yang Clan gave them a good offer. Ours should be more valuable…"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"A kingship."

A shadow of deep thought seemed to flicker in his eyes. He briefly recounted his discussion with the Yang Clan, omitting many details, and then walked with Li Ximing towards the center of the island, sighing softly.

"The Senior from the Celestial Office holds our ancestor in high regard, lamenting that of four, three were obtained—a rare feat indeed!"
