# Chapter 784: Anhuai Heaven

As he observed the radiant brilliance within his qi sea, Li Xuanfeng slowly recalled the incantation he had chanted when receiving the talisman, “I, Li Xuanfeng of the Li Family, respectfully invoke the Profound Light Dharma, guardian of fate and peace of mind. I vow to cultivate in accordance with the Dao, to speak and act in timely merit, to uphold truth and vow, and when the talisman burns, to surrender this body unto the Yin Realm.”

A response came from within the talisman seeds. “To this Li scion, forsake passion and impulse, halt error and fault, and sever evil at its root. We bestow the Profound Light Dharma to inspire a path of cultivation, from mortal to sage, beginning to end. First by abstention, then by ascension to truth...”

The Li Family had long pondered the talisman’s response. The full scripture was lengthy, with parts stating ‘Fate immutable, unseen by ghosts and gods,’ referring to how even Purple Mansion Realm divine arts could not deceive it, and ‘Serenity by nature, peace of heart,’ referring to the talisman seed’s power to still the mind.

So what the Li Family had pledged was, ‘To speak in timely merit, uphold vow and truth, and upon the burning of the talisman, surrender the body to the Yin Realm.’

Li Xuanfeng had once quietly spoken with his suspicious and fierce nephew, Li Yuanjiao, who had said, “In the early days, our family didn’t grasp the true situation. We took pills from the markets; how can we be sure there were no blood pills among them? Uncle once broke through using a pill, but no one knows its origin.”

Li Xuanfeng understood what his nephew left unsaid, “Our family forbade the use of blood sustenance, which was a rule passed down from Second Uncle. He once spoke of the Immortal Mirror’s people-centric path. Feeding on the mortal world... It was all a rejection of blood-based cultivation.

“If that’s true, then the pill I took back then must’ve been a blood pill, so why did the Mirror show nothing?”

They hadn’t dared to continue the conversation, and had instead silently preserved the family’s teachings. But now, seeing the white light rising in his qi sea, Li Xuanfeng’s heart finally sank, I have committed my share of wrongs, so this punishment is rightfully mine.

The soft white light shone gently down on his golden-talisman-like Immortal Foundation. It illuminated the pure from the impure, splitting them apart. A profound light emerged from within the talisman seeds.

The profound light was dense with runes as it leaped upward, then sank into the Immortal Foundation. The golden glow shattered at once as spirit energy dispersed. The qi sea trembled violently as a searing, bone-piercing pain rippled through Li Xuanfeng.

His vision dimmed slightly. The talisman seed within his qi sea seemed on the verge of breaking free into the void. It no longer rested at the bottom of his qi sea but leaped repeatedly in midair.

When the talisman burns, the body is offered to the Yin Realm.

Li Xuanfeng felt as though ten thousand silver needles were vibrating in his mind. If this talisman seed truly flew off into the void, it would take all his cultivation with it. ‘Offering the body to the Yin Realm was no mere poetic phrase.

In that brief moment, his mana and essence qi surged wildly into his qi sea, forming torrents that nearly emptied his reserves. Lines of alchemical script were engraved onto the talisman seed.

As his life teetered on the edge, a heavy and awe-inspiring presence seemed to descend into his qi sea. The talisman seed immediately halted, and hovered quietly atop the qi sea.

His essence qi and mana surged anew, flooding his limbs and bones. The Immortal Foundation Heavenly Gilded Helm solidified from illusion to reality, as it fully formed once again in his qi sea.

Li Xuanfeng sat in silence, with his eyes closed. The talisman seed still floated uneasily within his qi sea, as if it had been suppressed by some unseen force. It was hovering in place and refusing to sink down again.

He steadied his breath and slowly opened his eyes. The baleful winds still circled within the cave. When he felt the restrained talisman seed within him, Li Xuanfeng murmured to himself, “To keep the vow... to keep the vow... If I can use this body for one more deed, I may yet redeem my sins.”

His expression remained calm, betraying no emotion. The golden stone gathered of its own accord before him, forming a mirror that reflected Li Xuanfeng’s face.

It was the face of a man in his mid-thirties. His long hair was jet-black; his eyes were filled with baleful intent; and his features were fierce and bold. All his wrinkles and white hairs had vanished.

The newly formed Immortal Foundation had renewed his youth, restoring him to an image of himself from years ago.

This was the face I had when I first left home... Back when Second Uncle was still alive, and Xuanling had yet to perish. Li Xuanfeng gazed at his reflection and felt a faint sense of comfort. I’ve killed too much... and even practiced blood sustenance. I doubt I have many days left. If I still bore that vicious old face, I’d surely frighten them.

But if I pass into the underworld like this, at least my father and brothers will still recognize me.

———

Great void.

Lu Jiangxian had been staring at the descending ruins of the cave dwelling for quite some time, silently calculating in his heart. He hadn’t expected Li Xuanfeng to run into trouble first.

It was Lu Jiangxian’s first time witnessing someone under the talisman contract ingest a Dao Foundation. The talisman seed had been triggered before he even activated it, instantly leaping out of the man’s qi sea to devour all of his essence and mana. It had been ready to return to the mirror.

Had Lu Jiangxian not noticed in time and suppressed the talisman seed’s instinct, he would’ve been forced to watch Li Xuanfeng die, and bear witness to the seed flying back to the mirror.

The talisman seed truly does have a certain instinct. Once the hidden life-contract is activated, it breaks from its bearer and returns to the mirror... Lu Jiangxian’s earlier doubts began to ease, It seems the pill Li Tongya took back then must have been refined by some Eastern Sea demon and escaped the talisman seed’s detection... Otherwise, the seed would have fled his body just like today.

The one who forged this mirror clearly intended it to act as a detector. In the eyes of the talisman seed, ingestion is ingestion, there is no room for excuse. It will take your life immediately.

Li Xuanfeng...

He quickly withdrew his gaze and turned his attention once more to the descending ruins.

Now that several True Monarchs were missing, and with Yue Cultivating having cleared the path, the buddhist cultivators had grown visibly restless. There were far more buddhist cultivators in the great void than southern Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. So they held the upper hand within these ruins.

In the great void, Yuan Xiu, Qiushui, and other Daoist Masters wore grim expressions. Daoist Master Changxi of Profound Peak Gate was present, as was someone from the Purple Smoke Gate, hovering in the air in their signature violet robes.

As one of only two immortal families in Yue State with Purple Mansion Realm status, the Yuyang’s Chen Family beside Changxiao Gate had also sent someone. Known for their low profile, their Purple Mansion Realm representative was a man in simple grey robes, standing quietly at the back.

Even Mount Dali’s demon den had sent a fox demon at the Purple Mansion Realm. He seemed to be a barefoot youth in white, but each cheek sprouted an extra ear. His cultivation was already at the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, and he listened absentmindedly with a tilted head.

Snow Ji Gate still remained sealed in seclusion. Changxiao Gate was at war with Hengzhu Dao Gate, while Crimson Reef Island was clashing with Great Xiukui Temple. Naturally, none of them had sent delegates. Xiao Chuting had been stationed in the Northern Sea, and the Xiao Family had no other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, so they too were absent.

Expressions among the cultivators varied. Daoist Master Changxi wore a rare look of satisfaction. Clearly, his disciple Kong Tingyun from Profound Peak Gate had reaped significant benefits within the ruins. Her Golden Mountain dharma artifact was especially effective against buddhist cultivators, so she was truly a fish in water now.

Daoist Master Qiushui looked much more composed. Since Zhang Yun was in seclusion, Golden Feather Sect had sent Zhang Duanyan in her place. She was a female cultivator, but clearly not Zhang Yun’s equal. Her performance was merely passable.

Among all the cultivators present, the middle-aged man seated to the north wore the darkest expression. It was so heavy it seemed to drip with suppressed fury. His robes were ethereal and majestic, much like Tuoba Chongyuan’s. Clearly, he hailed from Shengle Heaven.

Tuoba Chongyuan had been attacked precisely when the ruins of the Dongning Palace descended. The great void had been in turmoil, but he had reacted within just a quarter of an hour. But by then, most of Tuoba Chongyuan’s life force had vanished. When the man traversed the great void and manifested back in the world, all he managed to preserve was a single wisp of Tuoba Chongyuan’s soul.

That wisp was missing more than half its essence. Even if it reincarnated, it might no longer be Tuoba Chongyuan. Outwardly, he maintained appearances, claiming to his demonic allies that his soul was intact, but only he knew the bitterness buried deep in his heart, The one who struck is frighteningly powerful... Even though Chongyuan had fought multiple battles and used most of his trump cards, he still shouldn’t have died in just fifteen minutes... That level of strength is simply beyond Foundation Establishment Realm...

The Tuoba Family had lost all face, so how could he not be filled with a mix of fury and fear? He had also broken the rules, and now the ruins were out of reach. Rage burned within him, but there was nothing he could do.

For this person to strike with such perfect timing, they must have been stalking Chongyuan for a long time! The Dragon Clan clearly hasn’t let go of their grudge against my family. Their plotting must’ve begun back in Dai Commandery...

Yet, he couldn’t discern which branch of the Dragon Clan had appeared. Based on their expressions, not even the Maha could figure it out. This only laced his rage with dread and fear.

Could Beijia and Xiyang be involved too? But why would they target someone so junior?
𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎

The Dragon Clan had once run rampant and made many enemies. The Tuoba Family was merely one of the more prominent targets. He’d thought that the Dragon Clan wouldn’t be so persistent after so many years, but he had been met with a crushing blow the moment he stepped out.

Back then, the Nine Sons of the True Hornless Dragon were known for their troublemaking. They would do everything from besieging True Monarchs to harassing imperial heirs. At their peak, they had more than ten Dragon Monarchs. If not for internal strife and a lack of Dao Embryos, the Four Seas’ Dragon Palaces could’ve rivaled the demon courts.

But they were all too unruly, drawing the ire of both immortals and demons. Suppression, both open and hidden, had reduced their numbers. Now, only two sons remained, and one was missing. Even the Dragon Clan had lost the Northern Sea. Beijia had fled eastward, lying low to lick his wounds and focus on thunder cultivation. Surely, he wouldn’t be stirring trouble again...

But who can say for sure... Emperor Wu once said, ‘The Nine Sons of the True Hornless Dragon are wild and wanton...’ Now that the Dragon Clan has greatly declined, and Beijia and Xiyang only spared because they couldn’t be killed, the world has gradually stopped suppressing them. Who’s to say they won’t revert to their old ways?

When the middle-aged man reached this point in his thoughts, he was already considering withdrawal. Suddenly, light burst forth from the great void. Brilliant multicolored radiance swiftly spread across the void.

“What...”

The colors flickered and quickly dimmed. Several Maha began forming spells to divine the cause, but soon looked at one another and shook their heads, halting their incantations.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator and Mahas all found it strange and began speculating about the light. But Lu Jiangxian, hidden off to the side, had a sharper divine sense, and what he saw was entirely different.

Xu State was in an unusual state. Its spiritual energy was chaotic, as treasures were scattered across the land, and entirely unpredictable. With so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha standing in the great void, the difficulty of divination had reached its peak. None could determine when or where the next ruin might fall.

But in Lu Jiangxian's eyes, the darkness of the great void was not empty. There were countless phantoms of the immortal families scattered throughout, some floating and some sinking. Some were firmly anchored behind the great void’s veil, while others trembled on the verge of collapse, unlikely to last much longer.

Most of these remnants belonged to the long-fallen Ning State. Lu Jiangxian spotted two particularly solid illusions at the highest points. Having read the memories of the Five-Eyed Merciful One, he had some understanding of these ancient matters.

One emitted multicolored light, so it must be the Wanglin Heaven of the Wanglin Upper Sect. The other, surrounded by a celestial blue glow, belonged to the royal family of Ning State, the Anhuai Heaven.

These two grotto heavens were exceptionally stable. No amount of turmoil caused by a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha could bring them down. Lu Jiangxian himself could only barely perceive them.

But among the many ruins that might descend, one stood out. It was the former royal palace of ancient Ning State, the Great Ning Palace. Despite its ruin, much of it still exuded imperial grandeur. Its soft golden radiance flitted over jade pools, white mists, and golden-feathered robes.

The colored light just now had burst from this very place, an arched portal the size of a doorway, through which faint glimpses of a vibrant world could be seen. Clearly, something within one of the ruins had activated it, triggering a connection to the Great Ning Palace that had caused the colored light to flash briefly through the great void.

A grotto heaven... Though no True Monarch has made a move, and Anhuai Heaven of Ning State won’t descend yet. But the ruins that have fallen include the Great Ning Palace, and it holds an entrance into that grotto heaven!

His heart trembled slightly, and everything before him suddenly became clear.

Judging from this... Even if Xu State is too chaotic to divine due to so many upheavals, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha must already know there’s a hidden grotto heaven in the ruins! That’s why they’re all gathered here!

How could so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha gather for mere Dao lineage disputes or a few fallen ruins? Clearly, they knew the Great Ning Palace held a gateway to Anhuai Heaven.

All their scheming, all the sacrificed cultivators from north and south, all the spiritual energy upheaval, everything had been to shake the Great Ning Palace into revealing itself. Their true ambition was undoubtedly what lay hidden within Anhuai Heaven!

Ning State’s Anhuai Heaven had never been discovered. Who could say how many treasures that were useful to both Foundation Establishment Realm and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were hidden there? Yet, if so many powerful figures were converging, there had to be something even more incredible. Countless thoughts surged through Lu Jiangxian’s mind as his thoughts rapidly crystallized.

So this was the plan all along... Who knows how long it’s been in preparation? Yue State has around a hundred Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Not a lot. Azure Pond Sect won’t lose much. Seems most of the lives sacrificed will be the rapidly-trained northern devil cultivators...

Lu Jiangxian had observed the great void for a long while, and now, his doubts were finally resolved, There will be a great struggle within Anhuai Heaven. It won’t just be Li Xuanfeng entering. If Azure Pond Sect wants to seize more benefits from within the grotto heaven, they’ll need more powerful cultivators...

In the battle to come... Tang Shedu, Yu Su, Lingu Rao, they’ll likely all have to ‘earn merit’ by taking those pills and entering the grotto heaven to fight...

He watched quietly and thought, Anhuai Heaven isn’t like Mirage Mirror Heaven. The Green Pine Temple’s grotto heaven belonged to their own Dao lineage. They divided its treasures politely, and everything was predetermined. But Anhuai Heaven... is where the three great paths battle to the death.

After a hundred years, Lu Jiangxian finally wasn’t someone caught in the storm. This time, he was keeping pace with, and was perhaps even a step ahead of, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

A fire stirred in his heart, If I must send someone into the grotto heaven... Only Li Xuanfeng will do. Now that I can roam the great void in spirit, even if I can’t break into the grotto heaven directly, I can still accomplish far, far more...
