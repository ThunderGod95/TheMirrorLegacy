# Chapter 954: Whose Scheme

The river surged, its waters churning.

The first light of the Morning Glow crested the horizon, casting the Crimson Flame Tower in a golden sheen. A long-faced man sat within, silent, waiting as Murong Yan ambled up to him. Only then did he speak, his voice low.

"Fellow Daoist Murong... any thoughts?"

Murong Yan settled himself casually. His fleshy face showed no sign of embarrassment; he seemed perfectly at ease.

"He's definitely made arrangements," Murong Yan said softly. "With us posted here by the river, he's planning to make a display of his power for us to see."

He seemed to regard Shilou Yingge as one of his own. Shielded by a divine ability, he spoke with blunt familiarity, chuckling as he continued: "Bai Ziyu is a clever man. He knows his best opportunity hinges on Qi Lanyan. As for that Helian uncle and nephew, they just fear his Viewing Pavilion Platform. And look at Touba Ci—he refuses to lift a finger. People from the Zhao Palace are on their way down. If he doesn't make a show of force... how will he command anyone?"

Shilou Yingge smiled. "If that's the case... what kind of display do you think he'll make? Hengli and Hengxing... they wouldn't come themselves, would they?"

Murong Yan stroked his beard and laughed. "How could that be possible!"

Seeing his expression, Shilou Yingge merely let out a long sigh. "True. In the end, the noble lord's methods are truly impressive. Just one 'southward reincarnation' and the matter was settled. He went through the True Monarch's connections, leaving the entire Supreme Yang Daoist tradition speechless and letting them tear themselves apart."

"Our methods?"

Murong Yan laughed sarcastically, as if privy to a deeper story. "My family didn't dare speak of it before, afraid of disrupting things. But now, the situation is becoming clear and is irreversible. I suppose there's no harm in discussing it with you."

"You say it was our methods? Then let me ask you: in all these years of the Supreme Yang's decline, what has Hengzhu actually lost? Back when all the Purple Mansion Realm experts were locked in a stalemate, a direct-line descendant of the Hengzhu just happened to run off for no reason... Does my family truly have that kind of power? Don't just believe the rumors that the Murong family's schemes caused the internal discord within the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition."

He leaned in. "Who truly desired that discord... is far from certain."

At this, Shilou Yingge's pupils widened. He had clearly made an unsettling connection. He was speechless for a long moment before finally offering a weak defense: "Fellow Daoist, you must be mistaken. Hengli and Hengxing... they wouldn't be people like that."

Murong Yan laughed loudly. "Of course, of course. The one above Hengzhu remains in the shadows. This business can be blamed on anyone."

This was deeply irreverent, hinting at someone at the very highest level. Shilou Yingge couldn't follow that line of thought and a chill crept into his heart.

'If that's true... then either the one above Hengzhu made these arrangements even earlier—saw some sign that the Jade True adept was close to achieving the Dao, foresaw the coming trouble, and prepared well in advance...'

'Or... the world is on the brink of upheaval, and after the Hengzhu leader lay low for so many years, someone above didn't want the Hengzhu Immortal Dao to get too entangled and create new complications. So, they intentionally engineered this separation...'

'Which explains why, after all these years, Hengzhu has remained almost completely unscathed. Their only real "loss" was a single direct-line descendant who couldn't even reach the Purple Mansion Realm. A sacrifice of one to pacify the whole region...'

His pupils trembled.

'Hengli probably doesn't know. But Hengxing... she was willing to come to the Battle of Luoxia. Did she sense something? Does she have her own plans... secretly cooperating, but afraid to get dragged in too deep?'

Neither man wanted to pursue the topic. They pulled the conversation back to the present. Murong Yan lowered his voice.

"Could it be Chi Buzi?"

At the mention of this name, Shilou Yingge fell silent for a moment. "I've heard of him. The number one genius of the Azure Pond. He's a Great Daoist Master now. His cultivation speed is terrifyingly fast. Especially the Purple Mystery immortal threshold—they say he crossed it as if it were nothing, perhaps even more easily than Wei Xuanyin back in the day."

Murong Yan's expression darkened slightly. "It's not impossible. Chi Buzi usually just looks out for himself, but if there's enough profit involved, he might just come back to stick his hand in... Still... how capable is he, really?"

The Imperial Scion of Yan smiled. "There's you, me, and Xindu. That's three of us. Taixi is close by on the bank. That's three Bodhisattva seats and one Lotus seat. Even if the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple refuses to send anyone and Touba Ci won't move, how many people would it possibly take to overwhelm us?"

But Shilou Yingge frowned, his gaze slowly turning south.

"They're here."

Murong Yan looked up as well. He saw white snow drifting over the morning riverbank. But unlike before, it didn't stop at the shore; it rode biting gusts of wind, surging across the river's surface toward them.

Ning Wan stood amidst the fierce gales, holding a Spiritual Sword, face impassive. A figure materialized behind her, wreathed in surging white water: the sword cultivator, Daoist Master Yushui Chen Yin.

But Murong Yan's gaze quickly skipped past those two, landing on the golden-eyed man beside them.

'Li Zhouwei...'

Fwoosh!

The True Fire overhead rapidly retracted. The long arched bridge, the True Fire armor—all of it dissolved back into flame and flowed into Shilou Yingge's palm, vanishing as if it were an illusion.

His golden robes fluttering, the man stood in the air beside Murong Yan and addressed the newcomers, his tone level.

"Fellow Daoist Ning... what is the meaning of this?"

Ning Wan didn't waste time with words. Twenty-eight white banners flew up and unfurled in the sky. A flurry of white light, like countless small swords falling from the heavens, rained down, blanketing the area.

In an instant, battle cries shook the sky as cultivators, monks, and demonic cultivators on both sides clashed. Murong Yan just let out a dry laugh, a thick killing intent rising in his eyes.

"Good!"

The world immediately dimmed. All colors faded into shadow, and even the bright, pure snow seemed to turn a deathly pale.

Sunless Deceit!

The divine ability surged forward like a tide. Chen Yin's figure vanished. His own divine ability roamed free—two 'waters' colliding. But his white Mansion Water divine ability was only enough to envelop himself, holding firm like an immovable reef in the dark tide.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes watched calmly. A brilliance had already gathered between his brows, coalescing into a shimmering light. He had long known the effects of Murong Yan's Sunless Deceit and was prepared. Standing quietly behind Chen Yin's Mansion Water divine ability, he easily stabilized his own power.

Rumble!

The Valley Water divine ability spread rapidly, staining the entire sky as if with ink. Several active divine abilities froze, but a single point of blazing brilliance burst free from the darkness.

Shilou Yingge's golden robes whipped about him, his eyes now a pure, blazing crimson. The clouds across the sky were rapidly retreating from him, revealing a scorching, boundless sea of fire.

"The Gao family's True Fire Art!"

With those two striking simultaneously, the sky was instantly split in two. The division was absolute: below, a lightless gloom; above, a raging inferno of True Fire. All the falling snow evaporated into nothingness. Only Ning Wan's twenty-eight white formation flags remained, struggling to hold their ground within the flames.

Clang!

At that critical moment, a white jade Spiritual Sword emerged from the Great Void. It was as cold as Qiushui, as fast as lightning, and it pointed directly at Shilou Yingge!

'Zhusheng...'

This Jade True sword cultivator from the Southern Borderlands had always been an ally of the Azure Pond. It was the first time Li Zhouwei had seen him. His heart stirred as he recalled the bitter expression he had once seen on Ning Wan's face.

'He's actually willing to get involved! Can it be... he doesn't know Suiguan is the one pulling the strings?'

He didn't let himself be distracted. The thought passed in an instant as the light between his brows erupted, shooting not toward Murong Yan, but at the empty space directly in front of Chen Yin.

Rumble!

A Bright Yang multicolored light flared, carving out a sanctuary of light in the world shrouded by Sunless Deceit. At the exact point where the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light struck, a man in a white robe and grey cloak slowly materialized, his expression awkward.

It was the demonic cultivator, Xindu!

He had intended to catch them off guard, but his stealth had been seen through. Now, as the brilliant Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light descended, he was the one caught flat-footed. He could only grasp the corner of his robe and channel his divine ability to resist the light.

But the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was fleeting, gone in a flash. It forced a cough from Xindu, and in that instant, Chen Yin surged forward. Li Zhouwei shot into the air, his long arm extending as his halberd swept across in a streak of light. The long haft glittered within the glowing stream as it slammed heavily into an oncoming black shadow, erupting in a shower of sparks.

The divine abilities in the sky momentarily froze. The overly vast Sunless Deceit was finally broken by the combined divine abilities of several Purple Mansion Realm experts. The distant Morning Glow broke through, illuminating the gleaming golden halberd. It had parried a Spiritual Artifact—something between a staff and a mace—that had emerged from the demonic mist.

The halberd glittered with motes of light, bright as the rising sun. The Luminous Grasp technique activated, and a fist-sized, white-hot comet of light leaped from it, trailing flames as it circled the halberd's shaft.

Li Zhouwei's eyes were once again reflected in Murong Yan's pupils. Now wielding his weapon, the chosen of the Li family finally showed a hint of a smile.

"Fellow Daoist Murong... Today, we can finally have a proper fight!"

Seeing that Li Zhouwei had intercepted him, the killing intent in Murong Yan's eyes slowly faded. He looked away from Chen Yin, his expression turning into one of eager anticipation. He grinned.

"Good!"

The word had barely fallen when Murong Yan's figure vanished. In his place hovered a man-high, brilliant white halo, encircled by sixteen scales.

Murong Yan himself reappeared thirty feet to the side. He formed a seal with two fingers, sending out two golden beams that intertwined into a ring of Dharma light. Instantly, an identical ring of light shot out from the halo, hurtling toward him.

Li Zhouwei raised his halberd, twisting his body, but then reversed his grip on the Grand Ascension, holding the long haft against his arm behind his back. He calmly used his free hand to untie the golden halberd hanging at his waist.

'The Radiant Sun King's Halberd!'

Murong Yan had been watching him closely. A complex look—a mix of dread and resignation—flashed across his face. His mind briefly blanked.

'The Radiant Sun King's Halberd of Li Shu and his son, Li Guangfu... That weapon is famous for its sheer, crushing weight. Why is he taking it out now?'

He saw Li Zhouwei turn his palm upward. The long halberd, a symbol of nobility and authority, floated gently in his hand. Soft, gentle brilliance pulsed from it, illuminating the surroundings.

Radiance!

A pale white brilliance shone out, instantly covering the entire battlefield. Whether it was Zhusheng and Chen Yin fighting with their swords, or Ning Wan controlling the grand formation, they all felt the pale light settle over them like a mantle, shielding them from the encroaching True Fire and Valley Water.

In his previous duels, Li Zhouwei had fought alone, so he had no need for this art. Now, with multiple Purple Mansion Realm experts in combat, he naturally brought it out to support his allies.

Whoosh...

But in that same instant, the two rings of Dharma light—pale blue on the outside, like golden rings within—were upon him. Li Zhouwei remained unhurried. He simply parted his lips.

Hsssss...

A surging torrent of purple fire erupted from his mouth, sweeping outward. This purple fire was unusually potent; it violently slammed into the two rings of Dharma light and blasted them aside.

This was the Flame-Spitting ability of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd!

In that same instant, Li Zhouwei was wreathed in the Radiant Celestial Wave Art. The bright light of the Sun's Resonant Radiance Art climbed his arm. With a flick of his halberd, he tossed the two spell arts behind him and charged Murong Yan!

He had recognized earlier that the sixteen scales in the halo were the Dharma scales of an Azure-Necked Flood Dragon. That meant the light had to be a bewildering light of Converging Water. It would be difficult to dispel directly. The best method was to force the caster's hand—to attack a vital point, forcing Murong Yan to abandon the Dharma Art to defend himself!

Murong Yan immediately raised his River-Wall Staff to parry. He raised an eyebrow as the light of his Sunless Deceit divine ability stopped expanding, instead contracting to a thirty-foot radius around him, locking out all radiance.

Clang!

The clash of Spiritual Artifacts was as loud as thunder. Murong Yan had indeed been forced to abandon his Dharma Art. He faltered for a fraction of a second. The Grand Ascension flared with light, and another Luminous Grasp White Light leaped out. Now two points of white light circled the halberd, fending off the dark radiance of the Sunless Deceit divine ability.

But in the exact instant Murong Yan blocked the Grand Ascension, a hazy golden light rose from the Grand Ascension Halberd. The physical halberd was still locked against the River-Wall Staff, but a golden shadow-clone of the halberd swung out in a graceful arc, stabbing at his neck!

It was the marvelous clone ability of the Grand Ascension's Attachment!

'He's using this shadow-clone to force my Valley Visage to manifest!'

A flash of shock crossed Murong Yan's eyes. He understood his opponent's intent, but he had no choice. He was forced to tilt his head up, revealing the face of a beautiful, pale-skinned woman with disheveled hair. With a sharp clang, that face bit down on the golden shadow.

'Just as I thought! When his Valley Visage manifests, his main body is temporarily powerless!'

The Attachment clone shattered, but Li Zhouwei's physical weapon was no longer pinned as it had been in their first fight. Flashing with brilliant golden light, it flipped over, swept aside the now dharma power-dimmed River-Wall Staff, and advanced again, smashing the woman's head to pieces.

"Impressive!"

Amidst the spreading black mist, a large, jade-white hand once again grasped the hilt of the River-Wall Staff. The fleshy outer skin-bag that Murong Yan wore was finally cast aside completely. An imposing man stood in the air, his glowing arm looking like pure white jade within the surging purple flames.

The River-Wall Staff expanded infinitely in the air, condensing into a massive, black demonic blade that chopped down from the sky.

BOOM!

The sound of metal striking metal echoed. A dazzling Bright Yang brilliance shot skyward, while roiling gray light from the Valley Water flowed like a river. The massive, mountain-sized demonic blade froze in mid-air, casting an enormous shadow on the ground below.

A single golden point—a halberd that looked as small as a twig in comparison—was braced against the demonic blade, holding it fast. Li Zhouwei had been driven down over a thousand feet, almost plunging into the river. His hands were white from the force of his grip. The river surface beneath his feet, pressed down by the immense divine ability, had caved in, parting the churning water to reveal a vast, dry hole.

RUMBLE!

Brilliant sparks and purple flames erupted at the point of impact. The sky was once again split along that boundary—one half shining with golden light, the other surging with gray.

The cultivators battling on the river's surface were scared out of their wits, scrambling and tumbling over each other to get away. Their retreat tore a stark, empty rift in the chaotic battlefield.

This grand visage, born from the clash of powerful divine abilities, lasted only for an instant. The divine abilities of the various Daoist Masters once again filled the sky. The True Fire and the Jade True light flared anew, red and white interweaving. The light illuminated Li Zhouwei's face. His gaze was sharp and bright as he stared quietly at Murong Yan.

Thrum...

Phoenix cries, dragon roars, the snap of flags and banners—a deep, resonant sound began to boil within the clouds. That same pure white gatehouse descended from the sky once more, a repeat of their first clash. Murong Yan stared into his opponent's smiling eyes and finally sensed that something was wrong.

The target of the Audience with the Celestial Gate wasn't him. It was...

The River-Wall Staff!
