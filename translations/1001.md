# Chapter 1001: The Cost

The Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array shone in the sky, gathering purple radiance. A Daoist Master in white-gold robes sat atop the Celestial Gate, deep in thought.

Si Yuanli pressed the scroll in his hand onto the gate. He remained silent, yet streams of golden light flowed like water from the seams of the scroll, covering the Celestial Gate and making it even more resplendent.

'The Huai River Map actually holds such divine power.'

These Merciful Ones were always cautious. With the situation having escalated to this point—trapped beneath the Audience with the Celestial Gate—Nu Xiao had still not taken her own life, nor had she uttered a single plea for mercy. This was, of course, due to the divine workings of the Huai River Map.

This golden, divine power flowed out, complementing the Audience with the Celestial Gate. It even sealed the Great Void, locking the entire Audience with the Celestial Gate into a state of stillness and isolating it from the outside world. Only the poor wretch remained suppressed beneath the Audience with the Celestial Gate, unable to escape or die...

'As expected of a Spiritual Treasure inscribed by a True Monarch all those years ago. Though that esteemed one has long since fallen, its power remains mysterious and unfathomable...'

Li Ximing looked up slightly and saw a Heavenly Light from the horizon rapidly approaching. It scattered dozens of people, who were all thrown into the formation in a single breath. The Heavenly Light then coalesced into a figure, which was none other than Li Zhouwei.

When Si Yuanli saw those golden eyes, he felt his own eyes burn. He lowered his gaze and said, "Greetings... Fellow Daoist!"

At that moment, the golden-eyed youth still had gray flames burning fiercely on him, sending up wisps of pale white smoke. Li Ximing took one look, then immediately lifted his head and exclaimed in shock, "Small Peacock Karma?!"

The karma fire on Li Zhouwei's body was precisely the Small Peacock Karma he had seen all those years ago in the Nine Mounds Dao Lineage of the Peacock Sea!

Those four words caused Si Yuanli to waver slightly. He asked in doubt, "The Peacock has come as well...?"

However, this was not the time for idle talk. Li Ximing reached into his sleeve, but Si Yuanli was one step ahead. He plucked a gourd from the Great Void, and a stream of pale gray Valley Water flowed out, landing in his palm. The middle-aged man stroked his beard and said, "The Azure Radiance Pure Essence... is perfect for fire wounds!"

The skirmish Li Zhouwei had on the eastern side was not intense, and his injuries were not severe; they would have only taken a month or two to heal. But since Si Yuanli had produced the spiritual water, he did not stand on ceremony. Using the Azure Radiance Pure Essence to cleanse his fire wounds, he nodded and said, "Thank you, Senior."

"You're too kind... I should be thanking you..."

Although his gains in the grotto-heaven had been swept clean by someone surnamed Chi, Li Zhouwei had, after all, offered his assistance. Si Yuanli felt he owed him a debt of gratitude, but the timing was poor. He only mentioned it briefly, then saw Li Zhouwei say thoughtfully, "Azure-purple Yuse, red pupils, golden beak. It must be a Peacock, then."

The Peacock clan was not unfamiliar to Li Ximing. He frowned and said, "Let's not talk about that for now. There's still a creature beneath the divine ability that needs to be dealt with first."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow in surprise, a look of elation immediately crossing his face. He asked, "You managed to capture a Merciful One?"

"Thanks to Fellow Daoist Si."

Li Ximing gave a cold laugh. He asked Si Yuanli to stand guard above the divine ability and, along with Li Zhouwei, transformed into light and descended, reappearing beneath the Audience with the Celestial Gate.

Here, the radiance was dazzling and a wave of heat washed over them. Fierce purple flames leapt and danced, and a suppressive and erosive power permeated the air. It swirled around the central pillar of light, emitting a grating, grinding sound.

Standing in the very center was an old Buddhist nun. Her glass-like face was covered in cracks from her violent struggle, and her arms showed signs of being shattered. She looked quite horrifying, having clearly struggled for a long time. But with Li Ximing and the Huai River Map suppressing her together, how could she possibly break free?

Seeing the two Daoist Masters appear before her and realizing that no one from the north would bother with her, she immediately bent her body, her face streaming with tears, and bowed, "Greetings, esteemed sirs... this humble cultivator..."

Li Zhouwei acted as if he hadn't heard her. He took a step forward, raised his hand, and seized her throat in a flash of lightning. His other hand smashed against her face with a deafening "CRACK!"

The woman's words came to an abrupt halt. With a sound of breaking glass, dense powder fell away. Her head immediately caved in and was smashed to pieces, leaving only an open and closing mouth. Multicolored glass-like gems rolled across her body, which were instantly incinerated by the flames. Li Zhouwei lifted her up and asked casually, "I ask you, why did the Way of Great Desire march south?"

Nu Xiao's vision went black from the punch, and she nearly passed out. While her eyes were full of stars, she dared not show any dissatisfaction. She trembled and said, "Your Highness... Your Highness... this lowly one is of humble status and only knows... that this division... is meant to attack Simin!"

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes and asked, "What forces are there? And how many people are coming from behind?"

Nu Xiao didn't dare to reassemble her face. She just kept her lips and teeth moving, flashing a fawning smile. "The Way of Emptiness has always been subservient. The most important thing is the Way of Great Desire's involvement. This matter was decided when the esteemed Suiguan exterminated the fiends and purged Jiangbei..."

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei asked, "The millions of people from Jiangbei?"

"How astute, esteemed sir!"

Li Ximing's heart froze. He saw the Merciful One grovel and say, "Esteemed sir... Although those above have not spoken, those of us who cultivate the wicked path can tell... The millions from Jiangbei not only serve to influence Wanling Heaven, but they also represent a major karmic event. Whoever contributed these millions would be the first to ride the wave of the next era's great changes... This is a huge opportunity... and those involved will most likely not be able to escape!"

Many of Li Zhouwei's conjectures seemed to be confirmed. He stared at her with cold eyes and said faintly, "There are also a few instigators of this great destiny, am I wrong?"

Nu Xiao quickly nodded, cowering as she spoke. "That is correct... Both the esteemed Sir Si and Your Highness have taken on a major karmic debt... As has that Daoist Master Ning... Even a few others who were on the sidelines have become entangled to some extent."

Li Ximing's heart was chilled. Li Zhouwei finally stood up and said coldly, "So it is!"

When Wanling Heaven descended all those years ago, the Way of Great Desire provided the personnel, and the Zhao Palace sent a divine ability and the Stargazing Bronze Sparrow. Suiguan could have directly made his move, so why did he have to bring that painting with him?

Li Zhouwei had always thought that Suiguan could not cross the river at will and needed to use him as a cover. But now that a consensus had been reached between north and south, how could the inability to cross the river have been an obstacle? And why bother to deliberately create a cover...? It wasn't just about the two sides needing a mutual understanding to turn a blind eye; there was a deeper purpose at play!

"You, esteemed sir, were one of the sources for the talisman. What was that painting? It was a talisman!"

'A talisman that could unleash Suiguan's divine ability!'

It was the Azure Pond that had forged the karmic ties. This talisman was drawn by Si Yuanli of the Azure Pond, used by Li Zhouwei, and was the very trump card the Azure Pond Sect Master Ning Wan used to order the attack on the Wilderness... This esteemed Sir Pristine Water used the pretext of a single talisman to deceive karma with a divine ability and conceal Suiguan, while all the karmic debt was then divided among everyone else...

'Did this esteemed Sir Pristine Water not want to be stained by karma? It's more than that...'

Li Zhouwei looked up and said in a low voice, "Since all of these cultivators have incurred such major karma, if they want to survive the coming great tide... they can only submit to the Yang Clan and stand against the North. This is essentially selling out the Azure Pond and the Yue State... selling them to the Yang Clan!"

Li Zhouwei was already irreconcilably opposed to the North; this was just one more layer of karma, cutting off his kinsmen's path of retreat. But for Ning Wan, Si Yuanli, and even the Yuyang Chen Clan... once this matter was settled, they would essentially have no way out!

Fleeing overseas? Carrying the karmic debt of crossing the river to kill millions of the Way of Great Desire and hindering the great tide of the North and South, how could a few cultivators—either early-stage Purple Mansion Realm or burdened with family—escape the Liangli of the Way of Great Desire and the venomous hands of the Maha? If they couldn't stand with the Yang Clan, from the Daoist Masters themselves to their many descendants, they would be seen as nothing but prized morsels in the eyes of their enemies... They might be fine for a time, but their lives would eventually be claimed!

The decline of the Li Clan from their former status as an Imperial Clan served as a precedent! Si Yuanli thought he would always have a place in the great tide, but he didn't realize he had already been irrevocably tied to the Yang Clan's chariot!

Li Ximing's face was grim. But when the Merciful One saw their reaction, she was already trembling in fear. Li Zhouwei's tone changed, and he asked coldly, "I ask you... the Seven Dao have been fighting my clan for years. Are there any people they have converted, high-level cultivators who possess the bloodline of the former Imperial Clan, or figures with major karmic ties to the Li Clan?!"

Nu Xiao froze for a moment. How could she not know? She was the very one responsible! Her heart was filled with a sudden surge of dread, and she hesitated for an instant. But then, a torrent of bright flames descended from the heavens and landed on her body.

"Sizzle!"

The pain from the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire swiftly swept through her mind. Her Dharma-body's divine ability was suppressed once more, and the bright flames quickly spread across her form. Nu Xiao's eyes were filled with fear. She cried out in pain, "Esteemed sirs... esteemed sirs... The number of people from the Seven Forms with major karmic ties to the Imperial Clan is countless! How could I possibly list them all! As for a high-level cultivator who possesses the bloodline of the former Imperial Clan... there is one, there is one! Please withdraw your divine ability!"

Li Zhouwei had already let go, causing her to fall into the light with a splash. Feeling her Dharma-body slowly crumble, Nu Xiao no longer cared about anything else. She bowed and said, "There is one in the Great Adoration Dharma Realm! He is called Li Jieyi, with the title 'Vast Cicada'... He is also a highly sought-after and important figure... As for the converted, the one who was converted..."

Li Ximing's expression darkened slightly, and he let the flames die down a bit. The golden-eyed youth, meanwhile, stepped forward, pressed his boot onto her throat, and said quietly, "Continue."

Nu Xiao knew that her end was truly at hand. The ones she hated the most were not the two in front of her, but Taixi, who had abandoned her here, and Antelope Trample, who had taken her position. Her lips trembled with hatred, but at that moment, she spoke with a strange composure. Weeping and laughing at the same time, she said, "There is a person called Antelope Trample... Having attacked and taken the Wilderness with the wicked path, he should have become a Merciful One by now. He is highly valued by the esteemed ones. While others seek to kill the Imperial Clan, he is here to convert the Imperial Clan. This time, he is the one who gained the most benefits, apart from the Esteemed Sir Peacock. And he will only get more in the future."

Li Ximing's pupils dilated. He looked at her in disbelief. Li Zhouwei lowered his head, his golden eyes staring coldly at her. With one hand resting on his knee, he pressed his foot down more firmly. "What is his mortal name, and who converted him?"

As soon as these words were spoken, Nu Xiao knew her end was truly at hand. Her eyes filled with a searing hatred, and she no longer showed any fear. A look of mockery appeared on her face as she thought with hate, 'You won't give me a way out... Fine... fine...'

She even managed a smile. "It was this old woman! As for his mortal name? Listen well, it's Li Chenghao! We hadn't even used our divine abilities, and he willingly submitted to the Buddhists. He devoured another person named Li Chengpan and used his own brother as a weapon!"

As the words left her mouth, she felt a sense of vindictive pleasure. 'The Imperial Clan is arrogant! I'll make you praise the descendant of the one who submitted to the Buddhists and blame that wretch who would rather die than surrender! When you see Antelope Trample, you will be filled with unbearable regret for your irredeemable mistake!'

The shrill, vindictive laughter had yet to escape her throat when the youth's face before her became covered in golden scales and mystical patterns. The cold rage in his eyes was like a deep abyss, a seething blade.

"CRACK!"

In just an instant, her entire upper body was smashed into multicolored light by the brilliant radiance. The bright flames boiled, a white light flickered, and glass-like fragments shattered.

Under the suppression of the Audience with the Celestial Gate and the seal of the Huai River Map, Nu Xiao's body and soul were utterly destroyed and vanished into thin air. The surging Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire consumed her body completely, leaving not a single fragment of glass or a single piece of flower or leaf behind.

"Clink..."

The Lotus Throne had reverted to its original form, a palm-sized pink object that fell onto the light and wobbled slightly. Li Ximing swept his sleeve and collected it, his teeth clenched.

"So there really was something... if you hadn't asked that extra question..."

The patterns on Li Zhouwei's face gradually faded. Without a word, he flew out with his granduncle, and they saw the middle-aged man on the Audience with the Celestial Gate looking chagrined. He had no desire to speak either and simply cupped his hands in a salute toward the two of them.

The Huai River Map isolated the sounds from inside and outside. But as the owner of the Spiritual Treasure, Si Yuanli had heard everything crystal clear. His heart was filled with a chilling mixture of fear and hatred, and his mood was even worse than theirs.

'No wonder... I always felt there was something wrong with that painting... So this was the reason!'

'The Old Ancestor... the Old Ancestor said to preserve ourselves on the mainland... He must have had a premonition!'

The three of them exchanged a glance. Li Ximing silently gestured for them to go up the mountain to talk. Si Yuanli forced a smile, waved his hand in refusal, and said in a low voice, "She mentioned the Esteemed Sir Peacock. The person from the Wilderness is definitely the Sparrow Carp Fish. He's a Peacock."

Li Ximing's mind was preoccupied, but he answered casually, "I've seen one or two before... but none had such great prestige... I've heard that the Peacock is the mount of the Revered One. This one is probably quite noble. What is his strength like?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "We didn't actually fight. We just had a brief standoff with our divine abilities. I only rescued some people from the Merciful Ones... It's a shame for the various clans of the Wilderness. When the karma fire fell, who knows how many people died? And now, there's no telling how to handle the aftermath!"

On the surface, the Wilderness was a land without a master, but with the weakening of the Sacred Writ and the Kong Clan on several occasions, the disappearance of Capital immortals, and the departure of the Xiao Clan, it had actually fallen under the control of Moongaze, governed by Milin. Milin issued cultivation methods, and the Wilderness, in turn, continuously supplied spiritual resources and talents to the lake.

The influence of the Li Clan had spread into the Wilderness long ago. When Li Ximing achieved the Purple Mansion Realm and took Funan, the Wilderness, along with Funan and Guyan, became a buffer zone for the Li Clan. Now, the last of these areas was lost. This was not only a loss of manpower and territory but also represented a shrinking of their maneuvering space.

The bad news came one after another, leaving the two with little enthusiasm. Si Yuanli looked hesitant and spoke, "More than just noble, the Sparrow Carp Fish is also considered a descendant of a Dharma Master-level being. I know of him. He first cultivated the Merging Fire. His cultivation method was special; as soon as he became a Great Daoist Master, he submitted to the Buddhists. By virtue of his bloodline karma, he instantly became a Maha. His cultivation is terrifyingly fast. He is already in his sixth lifetime. Although his power is still not as great as when he was a Great Daoist Master... he is still very fearsome."

"This time, his march south is probably to use the grand scheme of the North and South to overcome the hurdle of his seventh lifetime and regain the power of his previous lives..."

Si Yuanli had connections in the North, so his information was more current. With so much information now at his disposal, he began to make deductions: "Conflicts between the North and South rarely cross the Wilderness to reach Quanwu, let alone go even farther south. I think... his attack on Simin will definitely be a swift and decisive affair that can't afford a single mistake... That's why he isn't provoking your esteemed clan."

While the Li Clan had lost the Wilderness, it was clear that the other side didn't want to get involved in the Bright Yang's affairs and create an unforeseen variable. But Si Yuanli was in a terrible position! Now that he knew about the karma of the Way of Great Desire, and they intended to march to his sect's gates, how could he not break out in a cold sweat?

"He's very likely coming for the Yang Clan... but what if he's not? That esteemed Sir Yang has been in secluded cultivation for many years, and no one knows when he will emerge. The timing is a coincidence... but one must always be prepared. Who knows who will end up on the platter?"

He hesitated again and again, and then a glimmer of hope suddenly rose in his heart. 'The Nine Mounds... yes... the Nine Mounds... they have always been close with the Peacock. Even if I can't meet a Great Daoist Master right now... in a situation like this, those seniors should at least give me some guidance...'

He couldn't sit still any longer. He hastily bade farewell to the two of them, rose on the wind, and disappeared from sight.

Li Ximing watched him leave. Li Zhouwei said in a low voice, "It would be better for him to stay at the lake... Perhaps he has some connections or a trump card!"

The two of them stood in the Great Void for a while. The gray flames in the east were still spreading. Li Ximing sighed inwardly, feeling both hatred and pain.

'How could it be Chenghao?!'

While Li Chenghao was rigid, he was also bold in his words and actions, and fiercely loyal. In the past, to protect Li Chengpan, he had dared to stand against Li Zhouluo, yet when Li Zhouming needed him, he could put aside personal feelings and bow his head. His entire family was a family of martyrs! It could be said that he was one of the most well-known examples of stubborn loyalty among the recent generations... He had mentored many young people and was even an uncle to Li Zhouyang and Li Zhoufang.

He had fallen in the North. Li Zhouwei had even written "Great desire is emptiness; this enmity must be avenged" to Li Zhouyang. The news that he had submitted to the Buddhists was enough to bring shame upon more than half of the Li Clan...

Li Ximing's only consolation was that Li Zhouwei had been cautious, making a vow of revenge instead of bestowing a posthumous title. He tentatively said, "It's a good thing you were so careful..."

Li Zhouwei, however, shook his head. His gaze was icy as he said in a low voice,

"This matter must never be allowed to reach the clan!"

Li Ximing let out a breath and nodded, saying with some bitterness, "Chenghao's entire family was lost for the clan's sake, and he has no descendants... He did adopt a child, but it seems that child will not amount to anything. How can we possibly punish him for this? We'll just have to deal with things as they come."

"But as for Chengpan's descendant... should we offer more protection..."

Li Zhouwei heard these words, but he seemed to have some reservations. He thought for a moment and said, "There's no rush. The more important thing is to keep a close eye on him. There's no telling what kind of destiny scheme the North might have in mind."

The two of them reached a consensus and then descended in silence.

The cultivators at Moongaze Lake were huddled inside the formation, at a loss. A crowd of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators stood in the great hall, whispering to each other. When they saw the two Heavenly Lights appear, the solemn atmosphere immediately eased, and both rows of people knelt down with a rustle.

Li Ximing glanced around, silently counting the number of people. He realized that it was rare for so many of the clan to be gathered together. With the great turmoil at hand, it felt as though the overture had just begun and the great curtain was about to be drawn back, a sense of fate hanging in the air.

The people of the four lineages were arranged on either side. Li Zhouming and Li Minggong stood beside the elder, while Li Zhouda and Li Zhouluo were opposite them. Farther back, Li Jianglong, Jiangxia, and Jiangzong sat opposite each other, taking their seats according to their ranks.

Some were rakish and elegant, others dignified and generous; some were scowling, while others were fiery and boisterous. Each one had a refined appearance and a distinct bearing; there was hardly a common person among them. Li Ximing's worries had not yet subsided, and for a moment he felt a sense of daze.

'In a scene like this all those years ago, great-uncle Xuanfeng would have been seated, and I would have been on the side, awaiting orders. An esteemed one would have granted three truncheons to the clan in preparation for the unexpected. At that time, Zhouwei was still an infant. But today, it is the two of us who are in charge of the clan's affairs.'

He was silent for a moment. No one below dared to speak. Only a man in crimson armor happened to come up from outside the hall. He knelt on the steps and said respectfully, "Greetings to the two Daoist Masters."

In an instant, the cheers shook the heavens. Whether they were dandies or court guards, all bowed respectfully. The elders on the side also stood up and all turned their faces toward him, assuming a posture of respectful listening.

Li Ximing glanced at Li Zhouwei, who was standing beside him. He noticed that his junior had already stepped down one level and turned around, standing toward the seat of honor behind him that faced south from the north. Those golden eyes, which were originally so fierce, were now as calm as still water, quietly watching him.

---

On the Island.

While the great hall high above was respectful and solemn, the pavilions between the profound pillars were noisy and chaotic. A crowd of men and women whispered to each other, full of anxiety and unease. The middle-aged man stood in the pavilion, worried and nervous. "Eastern Residence... has Suikuan from the Eastern Residence arrived?"

Hearing this, Li Suikuan, who was standing nearby, answered. Li Zhoufang took a careful look at him and memorized his appearance. The middle-aged man then immediately went to ask the other children.

'The wind and clouds are clear...'

Li Suining stood by the window, carefully observing the scenery outside. He saw the brilliant Heavenly Light and nothing else out of the ordinary. His expression was calm, yet a sense of doubt rose in his heart. 'In my previous life, there should have been two showers of glass flowers that almost covered the entire great lake. That was when two Merciful Ones were suppressed by King Wei's divine ability and executed by ax and halberd...'

But the situation now was completely different. No matter how he looked, aside from the radiance that had burst forth earlier and a few specks of glass, he could no longer see the brilliant spectacle from his previous life.

'There was no glass flower rain... Perhaps the Buddhist cultivators' losses this time weren't as tragic as in my previous life.'

As he was thinking this, always feeling that it wasn't a good thing, he saw a person descend from the air in a hurry, their face full of joy. The person bowed on the steps and reported to Li Zhoufang, "Esteemed sir... esteemed sir... The two Daoist Masters have appeared in the hall!"

This one shout caused the pavilions to fall silent. From Li Zhoufang, who was in charge of the affairs there, to the white-armored guards standing outside the pavilions, they all let out a collective sigh of relief. The oppressive atmosphere suddenly disappeared. Li Suining's heart shook. 'So it was Daoist Master Zhaojing who guarded the lake this time!'

Li Zhoufang exhaled, a smile appearing on his face, but he still raised his eyebrows with a solemn expression and asked, "What are the casualties?"

The man bowed and said respectfully with a hint of dejection, "Reporting, esteemed sir. The esteemed sirs stationed on the shore and those responsible for patrolling the banks and capturing demonic cultivators were all killed by the karma fire... There were seven Qi Refining and twenty-one Embryonic Breathing cultivators stationed there, and six Qi Refining cultivators on patrol... Dharma Protector An Xuanxin didn't lead a team out, but the karma fire landed directly on the garrison... and he too perished..."

Li Zhoufang let out a heavy sigh. He motioned for the man to leave and didn't speak for a time. Li Suining, meanwhile, turned his head, his expression complex.

Clearly, although An Xuanxin had not gone out due to Ding Weizeng's departure, the karma fire that fell from the North was targeted. Even staying on the mountain peaks by the shore would not have saved his life.

'Having the Guest Retainer Ding leave was already doing my best. If both of them had escaped because of me, it would definitely arouse suspicion. My death would be one thing, but if the Daoist Master and King Wei were exposed to the eyes of the mighty cultivators, they cannot deviate from their fate without great consequence.'

'King Wei said that the ones who truly anticipate attaining the Bright Yang Fruition are not from Mount Luoxia... but my Li Clan... The change in the Bright Yang Fruition is an eventuality for Mount Luoxia, but for my clan, it is our only opportunity—whether we use this matter to seek refuge with a faction or to achieve Bright Yang, this is the only thing my clan has going for it.'

'The current situation is unclear. I don't know what kind of reaction altering all this would bring. If I don't speak to the two Daoist Masters, at worst, I will die when the time comes. But if two Daoist Masters who can influence the entire situation were to know... whether they believe me or not... it would be irreversible. The chain reaction would very likely be noticed by the esteemed ones, who would immediately crush the variable in its cradle and cause Moongaze Lake to be wiped out prematurely! In the future, when the event occurs, King Wei might not even get a chance to vie for Bright Yang!'

And so, Li Suining resolutely chose the former between Ding Weizeng and An Xuanxin. Even though he had made similar choices a few times in his previous life, his heart remained chillingly rational. 'No one owes anyone anything. I am only striving for a single sliver of a chance at survival. Anyone can be the price, even me.'
