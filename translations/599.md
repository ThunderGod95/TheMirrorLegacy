# Chapter 937: Shifting Political Climate

Mount Qingdu.

Cold rain fell steadily. The newly budding lotuses by the lakeshore were hit by frost, drooping feebly and plunging into the water to turn muddied and gray.

Li Qinghong cradled a jade box as she ascended Mount Qingdu. She noticed the stone steps had grown increasingly mossy, but a clean path remained because Li Xuanxuan came here every few days. After walking a dozen steps, she saw rows of green stone steles standing tall.

Li Ximing was still nowhere in sight; she knew he wouldn’t be able to come for a while. Only Li Xuanxuan was there, dressed in a gray-blue robe with his sleeves rolled up, holding a stele as he squinted and carved.

When he saw Li Qinghong approaching, the old man asked, "Have the arrangements at the foot of the mountain been settled?"

"Yes. Xijun never married or had children, so there are no troublesome matters," replied Li Qinghong.

Li Xuanxuan blew the stone dust from his hand. The woman stood beside him and softly said, "Perhaps he felt guilty and forbade himself from taking a wife."

The old man turned the stele and set down the stone chisel in his hand, replying, "I’m getting on in years, so let me speak a little more. Qinghong, hear me out."

He sighed and continued, "Among the four Xi’s, Xijun was closest to me, and also the most ruthless. Killing the Meng Family was something he could do... He didn’t care if he bore guilt, or if he was harshly judged. He was willing to eliminate even himself for anything that hindered Ximing from attaining divine power.

"If he hadn’t been born into our family, he surely would have become a cunning and unpredictable figure of the Devil Dao."

Li Xuanxuan propped the stele upright and said hoarsely, "Yuanping told me long ago that Xicheng and Xijun were selfless and heartless to the point of making people uneasy. It was true after all."

Li Qinghong carefully set down the jade box and spoke softly, "Uncle, I’m not as skilled in strategy as my elder brother. This matter with Wang Fu ended up being someone else’s scheme. I..."

Li Xuanxuan waved his hand and replied in a hoarse voice, "You did your best. No need to blame yourself."

Li Qinghong stood silently for a moment, then descended the stone steps. She saw several of Li Xicheng’s children coming up the mountain to pay respects to their second uncle. They respectfully addressed her as 'My Lady’ when they saw her.

Li Qinghong hurried past them, rode a bolt of lightning across the sky, and paused on the island. Once she was inside the main hall on the island, seeing that there was still no sign of Li Ximing, she let out a deep sigh.

But Li Chengliao, who had been waiting for quite some time, stepped forward and said softly, "My Lady, a letter has arrived from Zongquan Island!"

As he handed her the letter, he spoke concisely, "There is news about Chenghui. A few days ago, he took the pills sent from home and broke through to the ninth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He said that he suddenly felt the urge to break through in the outer sea, where water descends and thunder rises, upon reaching the ninth stage, so he went into seclusion."

Li Qinghong’s brows furrowed slightly as she said, "This child made the decision on his own... The Azure Pond Sect’s reward hasn’t even been delivered yet. We could have still exchanged for a few Essence Gathering Pills. Why wouldn’t he say anything and just enter seclusion like that?"

Li Qinghong knew that spiritual energy could surge at times, and the opportunity for breakthrough could also arise suddenly. Yet she had spent many years on the island and knew that child well, so she still thought to herself, He probably feels he hasn’t contributed much to the family, while most of his siblings died in battle, so he can’t bring himself to speak up...

"Second is Master Monk Kongheng... he’s inquiring about Uncle Xijun." Li Xijun was Li Chengliao’s second uncle, so he was dressed in mourning garb. His eyes carried sorrow as he said softly, "Several months ago, the Master Monk suddenly swore to renounce attainment and coughed up three pints of blood. After much reflection, he believed it had something to do with Xijun but didn’t dare leave rashly. So he hurriedly finished writing this letter to inquire."

Li Qinghong unfolded the letter and saw that Kongheng had written, I once swore an oath to Xijun, owing him a debt I would repay even at the cost of my life. I believe such vows should not be made lightly. I fear Xijun is in trouble... that’s what caused me to cough blood... I beg Your Excellency to investigate with caution!

Li Qinghong silently put the letter away. She hadn’t involved Kongheng in the matter with Wang Fu, feeling like it was dishonorable to begin with. Even though Changxiao Gate opposed their family, she didn’t consider it a matter of righteousness.

The Li Family had never claimed to be overly virtuous. In today’s world, all they could do was treat the people well and avoid blood food. As for seizing spirit items from enemies, that they could do, but Kongheng could not.

He practiced the ancient Buddhist Dao, which emphasized a pure heart. Asking him to do such things, even if he agreed, could easily lead him off the right path. Kongheng had labored tirelessly, repaying the favor of achieving a breakthrough into Master Monk. He had served the family diligently for decades, and naturally Li Qinghong did not want him caught up in such matters.

She held the letter, uncertain how to respond, for a while before putting it away quietly with her lips tightly pressed. Then she saw Li Chenghuai rushing over on the wind.

Li Chenghuai had now reached the seventh stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. By rights, he could attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm with some pills, but he didn’t feel confident and kept delaying. After all, he was still far from sixty and planned to wait for the right pills.

He said quietly, "My Lady, a cultivator has come to the island. He’s from the Northern Sea, practices thunder arts, wears a long sword at the waist, and is dressed in silver-feather thunder robes. His aura is quite fearsome."

"He calls himself... Xi Zikang of the Northern Sea!"

————

Eastern Sea.

Splitreed Island lay north of the Crimson Reef Island sea region. Vast and expansive, its fire vein was especially vigorous. The Azure Pond Sect’s immortal peak stood at the island’s center and had once been guarded by Ning Wan. Thus, it was filled with pine and bamboo, and the forest breezes were tranquil and serene.

Si Tongyi, clad in a red feathered robe that shimmered with iridescent light, flew through the sky like a flaming phoenix and gently landed atop the peak. After a brief moment, a burst of rainbow light shot out from the summit and landed before him, transforming into a dignified man.

The man had a youthful appearance, and his face was like sculpted jade. His features were gentle yet grand, not overly soft. His eyes, however, brimmed with authority. He cast out two sleeves of Heavenly Glow with a flick and came to a steady halt.

"Greetings, Peak Master!"

Si Tongyi noticed how the rainbow mist came and went without a trace. He was inwardly startled, thinking, Li Xizhi’s cultivation has advanced again! Even my perception techniques can’t see through that escape light... The Rainbow Mist lies between water, fire, and yang, and with the Fruition Attainment of Luoxia manifesting in this era, he’s truly formidable now.

Li Xizhi nodded gently. Now that he was overseeing the Eastern Sea and had grown stronger, his age and stature lent him natural authority. All the cups and bowls on the table floated up with a light lift of his hand, and the tea in the jade pot began to boil on its own.

This technique used no visible mana, only a strand of rainbow light, displaying his masterful control of spell arts.

Si Tongyi’s guess was correct; Li Xizhi’s strength had once again increased. On one hand, he’d received rewards and taken treasured panaceas and pills, further perfecting his cultivation. On the other, it was due to his talisman qi, Rainbow Pierce Skyway.

This talisman qi had shown its might several times in pursuit and evasion as it dissolved others’ mana. More importantly, it could be continuously nurtured to preserve one’s life and enhance their spell arts. In his early years, Li Xizhi had focused on studying spells and hadn’t explored it deeply. But now, with his cultivation at its peak and the nurturing of his Immortal Foundation, its effects became more pronounced.

Each time he nourished his Immortal Foundation with talisman qi, the power of his spells would increase. Whether it was his escape spell, footwork technique, perception technique, or spell arts, they all advanced together.

He was far more effective than other cultivators, who painstakingly honed each skill individually or took targeted spirit herbs. His already strong escape spell and footwork techniques became more refined, while even his weaker offensive and defensive arts were now becoming presentable.

"Moreover, this talisman is said to be the icing on the cake. The more balanced and complete one's aura, the higher their position and the firmer their command, the more powerful the talisman qi becomes!"

At first, he thought the talisman qi’s boost was minimal. He thought that there would only be small progress after much nurturing. But now that he was overseeing the Eastern Sea, the golden light of the talisman qi in his body had grown dozens of times brighter. Gradually, he grasped its wonders, and his strength rose steadily.

Si Tongyi, seated beside him, became even more respectful and said softly, "This time I came to see you, Peak Master, regarding sect matters."

"Go on." Li Xizhi gave a slight nod. Though he was newly promoted to a high position, his conduct and demeanor were unlike someone who had been cloistered within the sect for years.

Si Tongyi, familiar with him, spoke frankly, "Three days ago, Daoist Master Buzi appeared in the Eastern Sea and fought with the Daoist Master of Crimson Reef Island. Rumor has it that even the reclusive... that is, Daoist Master Tanyun revealed himself. We can now confirm, the great demonic beast has indeed broken through. Crimson Reef Island now has at least two Daoist Masters."

Though he spoke in the name of the Azure Pond Sect, the worry in his eyes was clearly directed toward Chi Buzi, as he said softly, "According to many, for Daoist Master Buzi to cause even Daoist Master Tianwan to suffer losses, it would mean that he must have reached the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm!"

After saying this, he silently observed Li Xizhi. The man did pause for a moment, then relaxed his brows and sighed, "He truly lives up to being the Chi Family’s prized prodigy of the past, to have such cultivation speed..."

"Yes," Si Tongyi replied softly and lowered his head.

Li Xizhi asked in concern, "Has the elder given any instructions... or is there a plan?"

Si Tongyi hesitated. "Our Daoist Master has not appeared in a long time, and the family elder has been quite tolerant of the Chi Family. Some have grown increasingly emboldened. When they heard of Daoist Master Buzi’s appearance, the main hall atop Azure Pond Peak was filled with cheers."

Li Xizhi smiled and said, "Celebrating who?"

"Of course, celebrating the sect master!" Si Tongyi gave a knowing nod and answered, "Elder Ning Hejing was also overjoyed... As for Daoist Fubo, there’s been no news."
𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝚠𝚎𝚋𝗻𝗼𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝚘𝐦

The current sect master Chi Xuxiao was from the Chi Family’s proper first lineage main branch. Leaving aside the secluded Chi Zhiyun, Chi Buzi’s emergence now added immense authority to his standing. Meanwhile, Ning Hejing was overjoyed beyond measure.

Chi Fubo had better start worrying... thought Li Xizhi.

Li Xizhi poured himself some tea and asked, "How does the elder intend to respond?"

Si Tongyi replied softly, "The family elder released Xia Yun and brushed aside the matter of Ning Hede. He turned away all the complaining disciples and no longer received any visitors."

Xia Yun and Ning Hede were under Ning Hejing. Though both were capable, they lacked moral integrity. One diluted quality while managing Xieqi Peak, and the other embezzled from the Immortal Tribute Office. How could they outmaneuver Si Yuanli? So, one had been imprisoned and the other interrogated. The offensive had originally been aimed at Ning Hejing’s Yuanxing Peak, implying he was unfit for his post.

Now, all their efforts had gone to waste, and Si Yuanli had shut himself away in silence. With the Chi Family backed by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it seemed they had stabilized the situation.

Li Xizhi, however, was not surprised and nodded. "The elder has played a fine move, but the act must be carried through completely. Next, we must give up either the Eastern Sea or Southern Sea."

"Yes." Si Tongyi nodded but still looked concerned as he answered, "But the elder still worries about Daoist Master Buzi. There’s widespread panic within the sect. Most of them remained neutral, and even many Daoists close to our family have defected to the main peak..."

"No matter." Li Xizhi said softly, "This will only make Ning Hejing more confident. With a Daoist Master above him, he wouldn’t dare move against the elder no matter how emboldened he feels. But he’s headstrong and stubborn. He won’t be able to tolerate Chi Fubo and others still holding most of the power.

"Chi Fubo has likely abandoned his scheming and will back off. But the Chi Family behind him are no better than Ning Hejing. They won’t easily give up what’s already in their grasp. No matter what, they’re still Chi blood, and if pushed, they’ll bare their fangs all the same."

Si Tongyi gave a slight nod and said, "The elder thinks the same. He’s already planted agents within. I'm afraid you may need to endure some grievances later, Daoist."

Li Xizhi understood all too well that the Lingu Family of the Southern Sea had deep roots. No matter how stubborn Ning Hejing was, he wouldn’t be foolish enough to provoke the Lingu Family. Most likely, the burden would fall on him instead. He smiled and nodded. After a few more polite exchanges, Si Tongyi rode the wind and departed.

Li Xizhi sat quietly on the peak for a while, his expression gradually calming. As his mana circulated, he flew down the mountain with the help of the grand formation, landing beside the guards and saying, "Let her come up."

A few moments later, a graceful and airy woman arrived, her face bearing a hint of amusement. She wore a pale jade Daoist robe and was striking in appearance. She was none other than Lingu Lanying of the Lingu Family.

She took her seat again and said softly, "You arrived just in time. Lord Si certainly holds you in high regard, Xizhi."

Li Xizhi, stationed in the Eastern Sea, had actually known about Chi Buzi’s matter even before the rest of the sect, let alone Lingu Lanying sitting before him.

She let out a soft laugh and said, "So Daoist Master Yuan Xiu truly won’t show himself."

Daoist Master Yuan Xiu had yet to make an appearance. The two had previously suspected he might have been injured in a grotto heaven. But seeing how composed and decisive Si Yuanli was at the moment, it was clear Yuan Xiu was simply refusing to show himself.

"Daoist Master Buzi is truly still alive. It seems he has no lingering attachment to the Azure Pond Sect," said Li Xizhi.

Lingu Lanying nodded, and both of them understood the matter clearly in their hearts.

Though Yuan Xiu was confident Chi Buzi wouldn’t meddle in the Azure Pond Sect’s affairs, he still couldn’t predict the old man’s true thoughts. So he secluded himself and feigned death, leaving all matters to Si Yuanli.

If Buzi did return or had a change of heart, the old master only had to step in and say it was all done without his knowledge, and everything would blow over. As long as Yuan Xiu didn’t personally act to replace the sect master, it would never escalate to the point of disgracing both Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

Si Yuanli was a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Even if something went wrong, Yuan Xiu could protect him. But as for the rest of them...

We are mere political tools. If things really take a turn, we’ll be sacrificed to pacify the elder’s fury and preserve the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' face.

Lingu Lanying didn’t say it aloud, but she was clearly calculating. She merely said softly, "Now that Buzi has acted in the Eastern Sea, on the surface it seems like he’s offering the Chi Family a remedy. But looking from another angle... doesn’t it also prove he’s been wandering the Eastern Sea all along, without the slightest interest in what happened to the Azure Pond Sect?"

Li Xizhi nodded and replied gently, "Purple Mansion Realm cultivators never act without calculation. All we need to do is observe the power struggle within the sect."

Lingu Lanying chuckled and shook her head in reply. "Do we even need to think about it? Chi Zhiyun can see clearly that Ning Hejing is domineering by nature. He’s suited for enforcing law, but if he is made sect leader, he’ll drive out everyone who doesn’t align with him! How could he possibly outmaneuver Chi Fubo?"

She swallowed the name Li Yuanqin without letting it pass her lips.

But then she noticed the young man in front of her sip his tea and speak softly, "Let's offer help at the right time. After all, easing the sect master’s burden is our duty."
