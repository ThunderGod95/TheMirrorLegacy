# Chapter 1276: King Jing

Li Zhouwei dismissed the assembled cultivators, ordering Cheng Qian and the others to guard the great desert, before the three of them descended together on a beam of light.

Flames surged through the mountains, their colors hazy yet suffused with a vibrant aura of life. Beside the alchemy furnace, the strange body had a ruddy complexion, appearing just like a living person. Li Ximing stood up and said with a smile:

"That was incredibly fast!"

Li Jiangqian shook his head with a smile and said:

"Grand Uncle, you didn't see the state of those divine ability users... Father's trip completely subdued them. Their only regret is that their surname isn't Li."

Li Zhouwei, however, wore a thoughtful expression as he recalled the man he had just seen. He said:

"This Daoist Master Ji'an... he's actually quite capable."

As they were both wielders of three divine abilities, earning such a compliment—"quite capable"—from Li Zhouwei was no easy feat. Li Ximing immediately sensed something was unusual. Clasping his hands behind his back, he stepped forward and mused:

"What do you mean by that?"

Li Zhouwei said:

"His divine ability is exceedingly powerful and his aura is deep and heavy. He also has something in his sleeve, an item of immense power. Even I felt a faint sense of danger from it. It's either an exceptionally formidable treasure or a peak-grade spiritual flame."

A look of understanding dawned on Li Ximing's face as he began to ponder the matter, but Li Zhouwei had already walked to the jade table and said softly:

"In the Yinling region, there is a Profound Hall of Bright Yang suspended in the sky. I have taken control of it, left my aura there, and dispatched Qing Feng to hold the hall while Kuang Hong propels it south."

"The task isn't difficult, but it is very slow. Fortunately, with Kuang Hong of Cultivation Transcendence, we can save a great deal of time. By my calculations, it will still take more than three months."

The King of Wei's eyes glinted with a smile.

"Not to mention, the hall can be disassembled. It even contains the sealed remains of a Daoist Master of Molten Fire who possessed three divine abilities. Grand Uncle, choose a good location for it to fall, and you will have a new sanctuary for alchemy!"

He continued without pause:

"There are also Daoist robes and even storage bags inside—a considerable haul that shouldn't be underestimated."

Li Ximing was both shocked and delighted, exclaiming:

"Such a windfall exists!"

Li Zhouwei nodded with a smile and glanced at Li Que'wan. The woman immediately stepped forward and said:

"Reporting to Grand Uncle, the spoils from the Battle of Luoxia were exceptionally abundant. Including the Horn Wood spiritual items and spiritual resources the Yang clan just delivered, in the category of Spiritual Artifacts alone we have two of Dawn Qi, two of Bright Yang, and one of Molten Fire, for a total of five. As for spiritual items, we have as many as eight types, including the likes of Radiant Sky Stone and Three Primal Mercury. Furthermore, we obtained both a water and a fire—the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness and the Profound Rhombus Flowing Flame!"

"As for spiritual resources... we obtained a full twenty-seven portions!"

Even though Li Que'wan was already aware of the tally, she still couldn't help but feel a sense of shock as she reported it. Li Zhouwei casually added:

"I also have a great pill I'd like you to look at, Grand Uncle, as well as Gongsun Bei's two Spiritual Artifacts... When we get around to reforging them, the gains should be substantial."

Li Ximing was rendered speechless for a moment, then said with a wry smile:

"Such an immense haul... this isn't something you could gather by simply wiping out one or two immortal sects. You've truly picked the various powers of Luoxia clean!"

He was right. Back when the Changxiao Gate was left as nothing but an empty shell, the spoils, even after being divided with Sima Yuanli, amounted to less than a tenth of today's haul, and were far inferior in value!

Li Jiangqian, however, still seemed unsatisfied. He shook his head with regret and said:

"We're still a long way off... Grand Uncle, you underestimate these great families. We only took what was useful to us..."

What Li Que'wan had listed were merely the Spiritual Artifacts; neither the spiritual sword nor the profound gourd were included in the count. Li Zhouwei reached for his waist and took out a small, purple and gold gourd. Placing it in his palm, he said with a smile:

"This is the Divine Dan Purple Gourd, a treasure from the Wei Palace!"

The gourd was small and exquisite, with a purple body and golden patterns, brimming with spirituality. It spun gently in his hand and, as if hearing its own name, began to emit a faint white light.

The moment Li Ximing saw its appearance, he knew it was extraordinary. As expected, he heard Li Zhouwei say with a laugh:

"This item resembles a Bright Yang Spiritual Treasure, anchored in Bright Yang and controlled between Radiant Fire and Merging Fire. The gourd nurtures two types of qi. One is called the Divine Yang Emperor's Fire, White Splendor; it can slay enemies and overcome all obstacles, eradicating demons and evil. It moves like lightning, swift as a shooting star. The other is called the Dan Yin Punishing Flame, Crimson Fragrance; it is but three feet long and a palm's width, yet it is exceedingly vicious, capable of burning out an enemy's eyes and shielding against their spiritual sense!"

He said softly:

"Neither of these qi is simple. White Splendor requires a long time to cultivate, but once released, it is as swift as lightning. Crimson Fragrance, on the other hand, can be released with a single thought, though its weakness is its short range. Its power, however, surpasses the former!"

With just a light flick of his finger, a dark, spark-like stream of qi leaped from the gourd's mouth. It was as deep as ink and danced continuously in the air.

That single spark instantly caused the several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to look over in alarm. Li Jiangqian's gaze burned with intensity, while Li Que'wan couldn't help but take a step back, suppressing the incessant warnings flaring from her divine ability.

Her Whole Pill feared Merging Fire, and just looking at the spark felt as though her eyes would be incinerated. She couldn't help but exclaim:

"Such a virulent Merging Fire qi..."

His expression turned slightly more serious:

"There is one thing you must remember: these two qi are neither innate abilities nor spiritual flames. Once they leave the gourd, they do not distinguish between friend and foe. If an enemy employs something like a divine wind, you must absolutely not use this recklessly!"

At these words, Li Que'wan became even more hesitant to accept it. Li Ximing frowned and nodded.

"I fear this is something far more ancient... Even an artifact from the Middle Ages wouldn't be so strange as to lack named abilities and merely contain two types of qi... It seems more like an artifact from the ancient Immortal Dao."

Li Zhouwei waved his hand, recalling the spark into the gourd. He shared the sentiment, saying:

"Grand Uncle is right. The materials of this item are certainly of Spiritual Treasure grade, and it could even overpower most others. However, its function is rather singular; it has no other wondrous abilities to speak of, only these two types of qi!"

"It doesn't need much else. Being able to kill enemies is more than enough."

Li Ximing nodded with an inscrutable expression and thought to himself:

'This is the first time I've seen such a Spiritual Artifact. It might even predate the founding of the Wei Kingdom, an ancient relic from Guanlong.'

Since Li Que'wan cultivated the Whole Pill, she naturally had an aversion to items of Merging Fire. The gourd also contained Baleful Qi, not true flames. It was also ill-suited for Li Ximing, so in the end, it naturally fell into Li Jiangqian's hands.

The gourd was rather peculiar; upon leaving Li Zhouwei, it trembled as if weeping. Li Jiangqian paid it no mind. His offensive capabilities were sometimes lacking, and this item was a perfect supplement. He treasured it greatly, viewing it as a Dao-protecting artifact on par with the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, and carefully hung it at his waist.

With the Divine Dan Purple Gourd setting such a high bar, Li Ximing's heart filled with anticipation. He then saw Li Zhouwei flip his hand and draw a sword from his sleeve, placing it on the table.

It was the very sword obtained from the Bountiful Yang Grotto!

This spiritual sword was exceptionally magnificent. Its blade was crimson with lacquer-black patterns and flecked with gold, like stains of blood. Its shape was peculiar, but setting all else aside, in terms of sheer splendor it absolutely ranked among the finest Spiritual Treasures the Li family had ever seen. Compared to the Great Snow's Severing Edge, it had a unique appeal of its own, leaving the onlookers momentarily speechless in silent admiration.

"This is the greatest prize from our assault on Luoxia, and the most precious treasure in all of Luoxia mystic realms."

Li Zhouwei's expression grew solemn as he said:

"This is the Sword of King Jing of Wei."

He said quietly:

"I have already asked the Qiao clan of Boye. The Great Wei did have a King Jing. He was the son of Emperor Wu and the full-blooded younger brother of Emperor Zhang of Wei. He was the preeminent prodigy of the Wei State in his time, and his Bright Yang sword technique could shake the heavens and earth, allowing him to dominate his era!"

"This is his personal sword!"

Li Zhouwei continued:

"He died in his pursuit of the Supreme Yang Intercalation, and this sword was passed down. It was originally in a mystic realm in the north called the Bright Swallow Palace. A Qiao clan ancestor, Qiao Zhou, was ordered to guard it. Later, when the world fell into chaos and several prefectures were lost, he secretly took the sword and escorted it all the way to Boye."

"But by then, Han Pass was sealed, cutting off all access. Qiao Zhou could not deliver the sword, and fearing Boye would also fall, he had no choice but to hide it in a secret location before going out to face the enemy, where he was killed by a general of Qi..."

His tone became inscrutable:

"After his death, another Daoist Master of the Qiao clan ceased resisting and surrendered to Qi. Only when the world gradually stabilized did they retrieve the sword."

"This sword has an arrogant nature. Originally, among the Qiao clan, only the loyal ancestor Qiao Zhou was able to wield it. Five hundred years later, another man appeared named Qiao Chengxiang, a Great Daoist Master who was complete in all five dharmas, and only he was able to subdue the sword."

"Although Qiao Chengxiang subdued the sword, he was unwilling to wield it, leaving it in the mystic realm, where it gradually faded into obscurity."

Li Ximing said in shock:

"Complete in all five dharmas? Was he... one of the people from the mountain?"

Li Zhouwei nodded grimly. He seemed to want to say more but hesitated, finally saying:

"It wasn't just him; the Wei clan also produced figures who undertook the Quest for Gold... I'm afraid that to the people on the mountain, those who undertake the quest are not particularly rare. What's rare are those who succeed."

He ultimately said no more on the matter, continuing softly:

"This sword was forged in a relatively recent era and is quite similar to the Spiritual Treasures of today. It doesn't have many abilities—only three—but none of them are simple."

"The first is called Heavenly Scenery. It is a magnificent and domineering art. The moment it is drawn, the sky becomes vast and bleak, and blood falls like rain, freezing everyone for an instant, rendering them unable to move."

Li Zhouwei's eyes shone with admiration as he continued:

"While not as tyrannical or difficult to resist as the Pure Yang Bracelets... its value lies in its sheer scale. If I were to draw the sword here, it would encompass an entire prefecture, silencing all the divine ability users in the sky at once!"

"Even if one or two of them have divine abilities like Present Departs Old or Untraceable Presence, or possess the power of Valley Water and manage to get away, there will be many more who cannot!"

Upon hearing this, Li Ximing was utterly appalled.

"An entire prefecture!"

The decisive moment in a battle between Purple Mansion Realm cultivators often lasts but an instant. Even if this ability didn't distinguish between friend and foe, as long as Li Zhouwei, the one who drew the sword, could still move, he could use the Crimson Severing Arrowhead to teleport at will and easily claim his enemies' lives!

After cultivating for so long, there were few things that could truly catch Li Zhouwei's eye, but this ability was of genuine, immense use!

"The second ability is Profound Scale. This blade has been tempered with countless Bright Yang essences. As long as one wields this sword while using Bright Yang arts, their power will be amplified by anywhere from ten to thirty percent..."

He smiled faintly and said:

"As for the third, Purifying Profundity, it is somewhat peculiar. It is an art for exterminating gods and ghosts. Any ghosts, deities, spirits, or monsters struck by this sword will suffer grievous wounds that are slow to heal, and may even be annihilated on the spot!"

Listening to this, Li Ximing was once again both shocked and overjoyed. He said:

"Minghuang... since this is a sword for casting arts, no one is more worthy of it than you!"

Li Zhouwei hadn't recognized it for what it was earlier. Now, knowing it was a sword for spell arts, his heart was similarly filled with delight, and he nodded to himself.

"King Jing..."

Li Jiangqian listened intently for a time before musing aloud:

"And then there was the Radiant Sun King..."

"I asked about him as well."

Li Zhouwei's eyes were bright as he explained:

"During the Wei dynasty, single-character royal titles were reserved for those of imperial lineage. But it wasn't enough to be of the imperial line; one also had to be a peerless prodigy. Over a thousand years, you could count such individuals on one hand. The six great clans of Guanlong represented the pinnacle for those outside the imperial family, and even they were granted only two-character royal titles..."

"The Radiant Sun King was a figure from the end of the Wei dynasty named Li Daoping, also a direct descendant of the imperial line. His son was Li Shu."

The King of Wei wore a surprisingly complex expression as he said:

"The Qiao clan could no longer recall the details of the chaotic wars, but they did know how he died."

"At the time, the Great Wei was collapsing. The Imperial Grandson of Wei fell at the Tao River. The Radiant Sun King gathered the remaining forces and retreated all the way to the lands of Shu, where he routed the pursuing Murong Er. He single-handedly guarded the gateway to Shu for many years, until finally, the Emperor of Qi was forced to lead a campaign in person to slay him."

"A True Monarch was aiding him at the time, and he had a chance to escape, but the Qi Emperor threatened to 'slaughter everyone in Shu.' He had no choice but to sacrifice himself to the tiger to allow his son, Li Shu, to escape. Fortunately, the Qi Emperor was also beset with troubles and had to urgently withdraw north to quell a rebellion, so he more or less kept his promise."

Li Jiangqian pondered for a long time before saying:

"So he was of imperial descent as well. Perhaps his descendants are among the Donghuo."

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. He had already taken out the Mountain's Edge Talisman, which could autonomously release the Loyal Vassal's Profound Light, and handed it to Li Ximing, explaining its strengths and weaknesses in detail. But Li Ximing shook his head and said:

"I don't think that's right. This item doesn't require spiritual sense to control, so for anyone, it's just a bonus. In that case, you should be the one to use it, to make the strong even stronger. Even if it conflicts with the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, now that this divine ability of yours has reached major accomplishment, you'll naturally find a way to resolve the conflict and unleash its killing power. There's no need to worry it won't be useful!"

He said with a serious expression:

"As for me, I can just make do with something like that Bright Yang treasure cup."

Li Zhouwei frowned slightly, but Li Ximing smiled again and added:

"I am perfectly safe here on the lake, unlike you, who is about to face another vicious battle. If you are so inclined, Minghuang, you can simply give this to me after you've dealt with the matter of Daoist Master Xiao."

Li Zhouwei could say no more. He took back the Mountain's Edge Talisman, hung it on the hilt of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, and said seriously:

"Regarding the many resources we've gathered, I have some thoughts on their disposal."

Seeing all the divine ability wielders look over with solemn expressions, he said quietly:

"For decades, the Daoist tradition of Mount Qusi has offered us much assistance without asking for anything in return. They have even sent their own disciples to the lake to bolster our ranks. We cannot fail to consider them... There are two Dawn Qi Spiritual Artifacts from the Governing Yang Grotto that possess an ancient Dawn Qi aura. We should find an opportunity to send them to the Southern Sea for Great Daoist Master Diyan to examine."

Li Ximing naturally nodded and agreed readily. Li Zhouwei then took them out, handed them to Li Que'wan, and said with a serious expression:

"Now that we have the Three Primal Mercury, and with the Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue from before, plus a few spiritual resources we acquired unexpectedly, we've scraped together enough to refine a Spiritual Artifact. I'll add three more portions of spiritual resources for you. You are a Daoist Master with a divine ability and high Dao-Profundity, so you should come up with a plan. Once matters here are concluded, deliver the items, and you can take the opportunity to request that Mount Qusi refine a Spiritual Artifact for you."

He sighed softly and continued:

"Dantai Jin is with the Sima Family. If the Nine Mounds intends to take back their Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, they will send word soon... When you return from Mount Qusi, you can return it to them on your way."

"If they don't..."

Li Zhouwei paused for a moment, listening as his second son said grimly:

"It means the Dantai clan is playing deaf and dumb, secretly hoping that Daoist Master Xiao has a chance to succeed. We don't necessarily have to take the initiative to return it."

Li Que'wan nodded in understanding. Li Zhouwei sighed and said:

"As for the matter of the Profound Foundation... we can begin to handle it immediately. You can dispatch Kuang Hong to trade for any spiritual resources we need... I'll just have to trouble you with it."

Although obtaining the complete Profound Foundation from Li Suining had saved them decades, the task of constructing the Great Void still required someone to oversee it, demanding a certain amount of care and attention.

Li Ximing was not versed in this Dao, nor was Li Jiangqian particularly familiar with it, and their combined Dao-Profundity was less than Li Que'wan's. Once Li Zhouwei entered seclusion, the responsibility would naturally fall upon her.

Li Que'wan did not seem to mind. She gave a deep bow and said softly:

"It is this junior's duty."

Li Zhouwei nodded silently. He was about to say more when he noticed Li Ximing let out a long sigh. His gaze swept over the faces of the two Daoist Masters beside him, and with a rare solemnity, Daoist Master Zhaojing spoke in a low voice:

"A few days ago, the phenomena in the north were spectacular. The Old Master was extremely worried and came up the mountain to see me again. I saw his complexion, and it was not good at all; he's relying solely on that spiritual item to hold on."

"The Old Master is getting on in years. For all this time, he has hoped for a day when all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators could gather for a grand occasion to report to the ancestral spirits... I see King Wei is about to enter seclusion. Once the great battle in Badger Prefecture begins, who knows what year or month it will be when you emerge..."

"I'm afraid... he can't wait that long."

Li Xuanxuan had used many life-extending methods, but time was like a phantom dogging his heels. In the blink of an eye, each day brought it closer. Seeing this, Li Ximing felt bleak and dejected.

"Ever since he traded away the Purple Mansion Realm pill, the Old Master has been consumed by guilt day and night, not daring to dwell on it. At this point, even if we offered him more life-extending measures, the old man would absolutely refuse to use them."

"His only remaining attachment to this world was seeing the two of you safely reach the Purple Mansion Realm, and for that, he has endured and held on... Now your divine abilities are complete, and the day of the sacrificial rites is upon us once more. Why not ride the momentum of this great victory and fulfill... his one wish!"
