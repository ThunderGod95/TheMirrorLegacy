# Chapter 786: The Story Of Tuoba

Li Xizhi stayed in Fuchen Peak’s territory for several months until his injuries finally stabilized. His Rainbow Pierce Skyway technique was especially adept at dissolving foreign mana within his body, making it highly effective for healing.

Once he took a closer look, the worst damage was no more than a loss of a dozen or so years of lifespan. The Azure Pond Sect's pills were remarkably potent. Back when his father Li Yuanjiao had relied solely on his own mana to heal, a single injury could force him into seclusion for years. But Li Xizhi began to see results within just a few months after taking the medicine.

He had intended to continue his secluded healing, but unexpectedly, someone came looking for him. Li Quantao had sent someone to pay a visit; it turned out Yu Yuwei was seeking him.

Li Xizhi was slightly surprised. But since he had just escaped a deadly calamity with the man, there might be urgent news. He hurriedly came out of seclusion, only to find Li Quantao already waiting outside the formation. He was about the same age as Li Xizhi and always had a smile on his face.

Li Xizhi was grateful to him and thanked him once again, then said softly, “Quantao, you’re also a Li. So from now on, consider yourself my own brother!”

Li Quantao, with his strong arms and bold air, replied, “That’s best! Brother Xizhi, there’s no need to stand on ceremony!”

The two of them left the cave dwelling together. After a moment’s thought, Li Xizhi asked first, “Quan Yi of Linghe Peak was killed by Tuoba Chongyuan and left his mother behind in the sect. He asked us to look after her. Quantao, do you know anything about what’s going on at Linghe Peak?”

Li Quantao was surprised and praised, “Fellow Daoist Quan was truly a filial son. Once I return to the sect, I’ll...”

Li Xizhi didn’t want to trouble him and quickly waved his hand, saying, “I only mean to inquire about her well-being. I owe him a debt and should visit in person once I return to the sect.”

He declined firmly on this matter, secretly staying alert in his heart, I should have someone check on Quan Yi’s mother first. The world is often cruel to the weak. If I return years later and find that the old woman has suffered mistreatment, then I would be at fault.

As they chatted, they arrived at the front courtyard. Yu Yuwei was in the yard, clutching his sleeves as he coughed. Though the old man’s complexion was still a bit pale, his expression was spirited and his aura nearly restored. He had clearly recovered well.

The older the ginger, the spicier it is. Truly, a veteran cultivator of great renown... Seems this fierce battle didn’t damage his core at all... thought Li Xizhi.

Li Xizhi greeted him softly, “Senior, your strength is formidable. You saved my life. I, Xizhi, am deeply grateful!”

“I should be the one thanking you!” Yu Yuwei’s dispirited expression stemmed more from grief over his two disciples than physical injury. As he spoke of it, gloom clouded his brow, and he sighed, “If he hadn’t gone after you... I might not have made it out alive. But you, to escape while being hunted by him. That’s truly remarkable!”

He paused, choosing not to waste time on mutual courtesies, and said quietly, “Young friend, Tuoba Chongyuan is dead!”

Li Xizhi had already heard some things over the past few months. How sharp was he? When he heard that Tuoba Chongyuan had been slain by someone from the Dragon Clan, he immediately understood.

So Dongfang Heyun really did catch his fish! thought Li Xizhi.

Li Xizhi already had a hunch when Tuoba Chongyuan claimed to be Emperor Wu and founded a nation by slaying a dragon. He feared that if Dongfang Heyun acted too soon, he might get dragged into it. But that guy was shrewd, so he probably lay in wait near the spear or the carriage.

He understood clearly but didn’t show it. He only nodded and replied, “Serves him right.”

Yu Yuwei chuckled quietly and shook his head. “I used to worry Tuoba Chongyuan might come back for revenge. But it’s better that he’s dead. By the time he reincarnates in a few decades, the grudge will have mostly faded.”

Having been hunted by that man, Li Xizhi had a good understanding of his character and said softly, “He didn’t strike me as the type to plot revenge in secret.”

Yu Yuwei smiled, nodded slightly, and drew a large purple cauldron from his sleeve. He placed it at the center of the hall with a loud thud, and a wave of heat surged forth. The cauldron had two handles and three legs. Its surface was adorned with intricate patterns. Purple flames encircled its rim.

Yu Yuwei patted it with some reluctance and said quietly, “That’s what I thought too, but take a look.”

Li Xizhi followed his gesture and looked closely. He saw faint marks etched on the cauldron. The uneven and rugged marks appeared to form four bold, sweeping characters that were sharp and powerful.

Shengle Tuoba.

Yu Yuwei shook his head helplessly and sighed. “I used this cauldron to block his life-bound seal back then. It took the full brunt of the strike, leaving these marks on it. It’s probably an inherent effect of their family’s dharma artifacts. Take a solid hit, and it’ll leave marks that are hard to erase. The next time someone from the Tuoba Family sees it, they’ll know you were once an enemy.”

He looked troubled and said in a deep voice, “I’ve tried every method I know, but the marks won’t come off... This cauldron is a legacy from my ancestors. It is exceptionally important. Most of my cultivation over the years is tied to it. How can I just give it up?”

Li Xizhi was far more at ease. First, he had never taken a direct hit from that seal; most of his injuries came from Tuoba Chongyuan’s spell arts. Second, he didn’t even own any proper dharma artifacts. The sword in his hand was still at the Qi Cultivation Realm, so it was nothing worth worrying about.

Li Xizhi nodded in feigned realization as he carefully examined the inscription. The sense of familiarity surged up once again, and he thought to himself, How strange... I had this same familiar feeling the first time I saw these characters...

When he saw Li Xizhi frown in puzzlement, Yu Yuwei asked a few questions, and Li Xizhi replied, “I just feel like I’ve seen this mark before...”

“Oh?” Yu Yuwei stroked his beard and asked, “Then perhaps your esteemed family has records regarding the imperial seal? I’d like to hear the details.”

Li Xizhi responded, and Yu Yuwei, who seemed quite patient with him, put aside his own concerns and smiled, “Emperor Wu, Tuoba Xuantan, possessed an imperial seal. It’s also the only remaining dharma relic after Shengle Heaven offered two pearls in exchange for the protection of a True Monarch... Everyone in the Tuoba Family is fond of carving seals, and I’ve heard they all model them after the imperial seal.”

Li Xizhi frowned as he looked at the marks again, and finally recalled where the sense of familiarity came from. When he had returned home once and met his father, he had glanced at the name inscribed on the Profound Patterned Bottle. It was Li Qianyuan of Wei State. The calligraphy was similarly vigorous and flowing, fierce and bold. It was at least seventy percent similar to the marks left on the cauldron!

He fell silent for a moment, then asked, “Fellow Daoist, do you know the origin of this imperial seal?”

“That’s a dharma relic!” Yu Yuwei chuckled, but when he saw the seriousness in Li Xizhi’s expression, he thought for a moment and hesitated, “I once overheard some idle gossip... They said this seal wasn’t forged by Tuoba Xuantan himself, but was actually a vassal-state seal from when the Tuoba tribe first settled in Dai Prefecture long ago...”

But he seemed unconvinced even as he said it, and simply finished with a smile, “Who really knows? Some say Tuoba Xuantan fell out with Mount Luoxia and was actually killed by someone from there... Others say the Tuoba Family’s rise was all just a scheme against the Dragon Clan...”

He sighed and shook his head. “Tales from the late ancient era outnumber official histories a hundredfold. Though my family lineage is long and second only to the Yuan Family, even our records from that time are vague...”

Yu Yuwei gave a faintly sardonic smile and said, “No matter how much we guess, Tuoba Xuantan is already dead. There’s really nothing left to figure out.”
