# Chapter 1115: Spring-Frozen Blood (2)

The Ling River snaked through the land, mountain peaks rising one after another. Amidst the swirling clouds, a table and a platform were faintly visible. A golden formation was embedded in the ground, where a woman veiled in white gauze was pouring fine wine. The reflection in the wine shimmered with a hint of light.

A Daoist Master in blue robes strode over, smiling.

"Daoist friend Zhaojing, you've come at just the right time!"

Li Ximing smiled and nodded. His gaze swept over the woman beside the Daoist Master, and he said,

"I have often heard that your noble path upholds the balance of yin and yang, cultivating the immortal way of male-female union. Seeing it today, it is exactly as rumored!"

The Daoist Master approaching with a smile was none other than Liaoluo of Mount Qusi. Hearing this, he knew Li Ximing was referring to how most of the female cultivators practiced as cultivation cauldrons. He chuckled,

"My Mount Qusi lineage has always researched the paths of male and female. In ancient times, we even had the Great Dao of yin-yang complementation. Later, we added the inheritance from the Yin family's Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate—'Bright Yang,' you understand. I'm sure you've heard of it, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing found it difficult to respond and merely gave a few dry laughs. Liaoluo shook his head and smiled.

"If you had come in earlier years, Daoist Master, the atmosphere on the mountain was far more blatant. In recent years, the Mount Jingyi lineage split off, Kuang Yu went to Hengzhu when she was young, and there aren't many people left on the mountain. Plus, I've cultivated 'Converging Water'... so this tendency has faded."

Li Ximing nodded and changed the subject.

"That pagoda..."

Li Ximing had discussed worldly matters with Li Zhouwei long ago, arranging for Guo Nanwu to bring the item to Liaoluo. Nearly a year had passed since then. He had received news and made his own calculations, which was why he had made this special trip.

Hearing his words, Liaoluo smiled and called out casually, "Attendants!"

Several serving women approached in a line, each holding a tray. Atop a white jade cushion sat a stone, about the size of two fingers. It pulsed with Heavenly Light, and flames licked within it, flushing the surrounding clouds an orange-red.

Radiant Sky Stone.

This piece of Radiant Sky Stone was nearly twice as large as the one Li Ximing had used for his breakthrough. Resting on the jade, its colors were dazzling, and he was visibly moved.

However, a closer look revealed that this Radiant Sky Stone was different. The light and flames upon it blazed, and Radiant Fire seemed to dance faintly within. Daoist Master Liaoluo adopted a serious expression.

"The materials for that pagoda were quite valuable. It used Radiant Sky Stone and Chongming Golden Essence. I have already extracted them, but the two spiritual items have completely achieved profound unity. If you wish to separate them, you'll have to find a 'Whole Pill' cultivator."

Li Ximing nodded in praise.

"Daoist friend, your skill is magnificent!"

There was a reason Li Ximing had sought out Daoist Master Liaoluo. The man was an artifact refiner who also cultivated 'Converging Water,' making his ability to gather and consolidate materials first-class. In just under a year, Liaoluo had settled the matter without even delaying his own cultivation.

Li Ximing, however, had no need to find a cultivator to separate them. The two spiritual items being merged was of no consequence to his family. He just smiled and nodded, asking no further.

According to the rules of Mount Qusi, aside from the proper payment for artifact refinement, any materials below the Purple Mansion Realm, or any additional Purple Mansion-level resources that constituted less than ten percent of the total, were kept by the mountain. This was just like how Li Ximing skimmed a few pills for himself during alchemy—an unspoken understanding. Since the man hadn't charged him a fee, Li Ximing naturally wouldn't try to reclaim these scraps.

Liaoluo waved his hand and led him to a golden platform off to the side. In its center was a fist-sized hole leading deep underground, from which flames raged. Faintly visible within was a golden embryo, as long as an arm and as thick as a finger.

Liaoluo said, "Daoist friend mentioned that time was of the essence. For Vast Cicada's Radiant Fire spear, I invited Nanwu to help refine it. We melted away most of the impurities and all of its embedded Dharma-releases, leaving this embryo. It can be reforged according to your wishes. The only thing is, the materials are in profound unity. The Tianyang Radiant Copper that was originally in the spearhead has now fused with the entire body. It's suitable for forging a Spiritual Artifact that is completely uniform!"

"By my estimates, it can be finished by the end of the year!"

Li Ximing had not expected such speed. He was overjoyed, understanding that Liaoluo's entire Dao lineage must have been mobilized for this task.

"This... Thank you, Daoist Master!"

He intended to have this forged into a Spiritual Artifact for Li Jiangqian immediately. The time required to forge a Spiritual Artifact was terrifyingly long, and Li Ximing didn't want Li Jiangqian to emerge from seclusion only to wait another dozen years!

With this embryo, he had saved an unknown amount of time.

The Daoist Master simply smiled.

"My skills are just parlor tricks. The Great Daoist Master is the one with true immortal talent. You sent that Valley Water treasure here. It has only been one hundred and sixty days. Once it reaches three hundred, all of its dharmas will be dissolved, its components separated, and it will be reborn!"

"Oh?" Joy instantly lit up Li Ximing's eyes. "I heard that the Valley Water Glazed Treasure Seat had already achieved profound unity, to the point where it was impossible to reverse. I never expected that in the Great Daoist Master's hands, extracting all the spiritual items from within would take less than a year!"

Liaoluo shot him a meaningful glance.

"The Great Daoist Master's abilities are rare in this age! Even when the Ancestral Master was alive, he praised his artifact refinement arts as having reached the peak of perfection!"

Dingyang Zi was currently in Qize, making a meeting difficult. Li Ximing had come personally this time precisely for artifact refinement. How could he not understand the implication? He solemnly pushed forward the Radiant Sky Stone that had merged with the Radiant Fire.

"Then I must ask the old Daoist Master... to refine an artifact for my family!"

The Li family possessed a good number of spiritual resources and items, but few were unallocated. Although they had four Purple Mansion-level spiritual items, the one from the 'Upper Rite' had no current use and was being used to gather qi; the Concealed Plunder Gold and the Long Yue Variable Gold were used for casting Dharma Arts; and the Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue had to be saved for Li Que'wan. Still, if he squeezed, he had things he could use.

His spiritual resources, on the other hand, were abundant. Thanks to the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, the Neck Feathers supplied over the years had filled nearly all the gaps in their expenditures, allowing their resources to slowly accumulate. Excluding the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, which was difficult to quantify, and the two portions of Crimson Radiance Li Amber reserved for Li Jiangqian, which couldn't be touched, he had plenty.

He had two remaining Neck Feathers, one portion each of Heart-Taste Baleful Qi and Cangzhou Serpent Scale, one portion each of Shangxiang Silver, Golden Branch of the Late Tassel, and Bound Heart-Ice, plus the newly obtained Nightshade Spirit Grass and the Heart-Armor of the Yù-Beast he kept at the bottom of his chest. That was nine portions in total.

'That's more than enough for a Spiritual Artifact!'

The first thing Li Ximing thought of was not a weapon, but spiritual armor for Li Jiangqian!

Li Jiangqian had no particular preference for weapons. With the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, he was covered for both offense and defense. If he also had a suit of Radiant Fire armor, received an Azure Talisman, and condensed a divine ability, he would be a standard combatant capable of tying down three ordinary divine ability users!

'And what's more, there's that golden embryo...'

As for the golden embryo, Li Ximing thought of his family's King Wei. Li Zhouwei's quip about 'using it better than me' had just been a joke, but Li Ximing had taken it to heart.

'He's a figure who shakes the north, after all. It's truly unsuitable for him to still be fighting with a mere spirit embryo.'

He thus stated his request. Daoist Master Liaoluo immediately fell into deep thought, then shook his head.

"The golden embryo... Since it is being forged for King Wei, how can it be made from nothing but Vast Cicada's broken weapon? I fear that would be beneath his station. We must use the golden embryo as the bone, and the merged Radiant Sky Stone and Chongming Golden Essence as the blade. We must have my Great Daoist Master personally forge it. Only such a weapon can contend with the Spiritual Treasures in those others' hands!"

Li Ximing had a realization, and a hidden light gleamed in his eyes.

'That's an excellent idea. If those two items are merged, the result might even rival the weapon of Chu Yi, the Wei Emperor's reincarnation!'

He said joyfully, "What you say is absolutely right, Daoist friend! I must trouble you to do your utmost. If there is any lack of spiritual resources to complete it, I hope I might be able to trade for some!"

Liaoluo said solemnly, "This is my duty. The mountain has plenty of Bright Yang and Radiant Fire spiritual resources, and the Great Daoist Master has even more. Just leave it to us!"

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly. He currently planned to use his Neck Feathers to extract spiritual water, so he didn't offer them. Amidst Liaoluo's insistent refusals, he left the Nightshade Spirit Grass and the Bound Heart-Ice as a contribution.

He did not intend to stay overseas for long and quickly rose to take his leave. Before he left, however, he couldn't help asking one last thing.

"That Valley Water Glazed Treasure Pagoda... if it is successfully refined, what kind of spiritual items might be obtained?"

The Daoist Master replied, "At least one Valley Water item and one Gold-attribute item."

'Valley Water and Gold...'

Li Ximing's consciousness slipped into the Great Void as he pondered. 'It looks like they can only go to Que'Wan. A 'Whole Pill' cultivator needs to cast many arts. If I can use the Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue with these, it would be perfect for refining a sword technique for her. Good. That saves Jiangqian from getting a Spiritual Treasure while she has empty hands.'

He finalized the arrangements, but after a moment's thought, he felt a little uneasy.

'Mount Qusi is an ally, and this is mutual aid. But this way, I'm just taking their charity. That's not the way of allies, nor is it a principle to live by. I'll likely be burdened by this debt of gratitude.'

He mulled it over and sighed.

'I can only find a way to make it up to them in the future!'

---

The normally clear surface of Moongaze Lake was dim and heavy. Shards of ice collided violently, emitting sharp, cracking sounds. A faint red bloomed within the waves, like unfurling bolts of blood-red silk, appearing unnervingly calm in the dark, grim wind and rain.

Broken, purple-gold profound pillars sank into the lake, their jagged surfaces piled high with glittering fragments of ice.

The entire mountain was covered in corpses.

Above the lake, heavenly thunder rolled through thickly gathered dark clouds. A dangerous aura washed over the scene. A woman in a Cinnabar-red skirt stood within a gloomy, multicolored light, saying not a word.

Faint traces of blood stained her beautiful face. Her snow-white, slender hand gripped a profound sword used for Dharma Arts. Her gaze was ice-cold as she stood upon the clouds, surrounded by the rumble of thunder.

"RUMBLE!"

A dark shadow faintly emerged from the heavy mist. A middle-aged Daoist stood against the horizon. He had sharp brows, star-like eyes, a wide face, and thick shoulders. He wore a white and yellow Daoist robe, his expression placid as he quietly observed the woman below.

"Lord Xuan'an truly has remarkable divine abilities. Even with no strength remaining, he still managed to suppress an Immortal Artifact to release a wisp of Heaven-Governing power, causing the other lords to misjudge His condition. By struggling until now, you have caused my North to suffer grievous losses..."

'Li Que'wan...'

The Daoist's gaze was calm, yet filled with killing intent. His tone, however, held a smile.

"Three divine abilities. That counts as skill. If you weren't born into the imperial family, you might have been a figure destined for the Quest for Gold. A pity."

As he spoke, all the wind in the world began to howl southward, whipping the woman's red skirt about. Her pale face was a mask of deep-seated hatred. Her red lips parted slightly.

"The immortal mountain honors reclusive cultivation, unstained by the mortal world. For Lord Yao to descend the mountain to govern the Profound Governance Pavilion, and then to breach my Song border... is this not... entirely without reason?"

The middle-aged Daoist took a step forward, casually drawing a divine spear from the clouds. One after another, fans made of clouds began to gather behind him. The ringing of metal sounded once more. He gently stroked the long spear, his gaze lowered as he spoke flatly.

"Ever since King Wei slew Xuanlou, this has not been a mortal affair. Between myself and the imperial clan, there is no reason left to be spoken."

Li Que'wan still refused to retreat even half a step. She stared silently at the spear's long blade, watching the Spiritual Treasure grow brighter and brighter. The Daoist chuckled.

"As for the mountain, Guanyi will naturally provide an explanation. At worst... I will send this head to the Underworld, in exchange for their cooperation."

The radiance of Yao Guanyi's perfected divine ability shone like a full moon, illuminating the land. A trace of a smile flashed across his face. The bright blade in his sleeve retracted, and the surprise in his pupils vanished.

"So, it's the Un-harming Stone. Supplemented by a 'Whole Pill' cultivator, it is innately fearless of water and fire. It seems that even though Lord Su perished in the Converging Water, and despite the new wounds of later generations, this Spiritual Treasure is still formidable."

Though the woman in the clouds was unharmed, her expression grew heavier, touched by a faint despair. The divine ability in her hand flared, multicolored light cycling.

"RUMBLE!"

Thunder and rainstorms echoed through heaven and earth. Waves of purple lightning once again submerged the land. The few solitary profound pillars still standing finally toppled, crashing down with a deafening roar.

There were very few figures left on the island. After an unknown time, a man in copper armor struggled to his feet amidst the collapsed ruins. His cracked and shattered eye slid down his cheek, and his empty socket stared blankly at the sky.

"THUD!"

The woman was already kneeling in the clouds. The profound sword that belonged to her was now in the Daoist's hand.

"Pfft..."

The profound sword, covered in Cinnabar-red runes and used for casting Dharma Arts, pierced through her. With a light flick of the man's fingers, it had already shot forward, passing through the woman's chest and bursting from the feather cloak on her back, shedding a vibrant, multicolored light.

"Ugh..."

Viscous, mercury-like blood welled along the blade's edge, still struggling stubbornly to retract into her body. Li Que'wan's lips were bloodless. She trembled, and then a world-shaking screech tore through the air!

"SCREECH—"

The resounding cry of a bird flashed for only an instant before being muffled by the thunder. A two-colored, red-and-white profound bird soared into the sky, earning only a slight nod from the Daoist.

"A 'Whole Pill' cultivator, after all."

He simply raised his hand, plucked a wooden urn from his sleeve, and tossed it lightly into the air. In an instant, profound mysteries converged, and a gale roared to life, seizing the profound bird that was attempting to flee and hide. No matter how it struggled, it could not escape.

If anything, the sight of the urn made the bird's cry even more shrill and desperate.

"THUD!"

Torrents of clear, spiritual qi poured down, accompanied by silver light. A silver-robed youth emerged from a patch of ruins, stepping through the Great Void. He steadied himself on the ground, which was covered in blood and gore. As far as he could see, no one was left standing.

'Why? Why was it so fast...'

The most terrifying thing imaginable had happened right in front of him, leaving his gaze hollow with terror and disbelief.

'King Wei... he clearly just reached the Wei capital... Why?'

The Li family's direct bloodline and its cultivators had nearly all been killed on the shore. Only the old and the young remained on the island. How could they possibly withstand the Profound Thunder?

'How is this possible... I remember... they held on for many years after King Wei fell... How can this be?'

Li Suining sank blankly to his knees, his vision blurred with tears as he stared at the ground. Suddenly, he saw a familiar face.

Old Man Du.

He looked as though he had fallen from a great height. His face was a ruin of blood and flesh, but because of the frigid weather, his upturned eyeballs were half-frozen in their sockets, grotesquely semi-solid. Li Suining started to reach out a hand but snatched it back, unable to look. He raised his head, utterly lost.

In the darkness, a lightning strike illuminated the land. Atop the mountain peak stood a man in shattered armor, his body covered in wounds, his gaze serene.

'It's Ding Weizeng...'

Ding Weizeng looked like he wanted to roar, but the blood surging in his throat choked him, sending him into a fit of coughing. It was as if he had triggered some cosmic mechanism. The fury brewing in the rolling black clouds found its target, and a silver bolt of lightning struck down!

"RUMBLE!"

The stalwart man didn't make a sound. The flesh on his body instantly exploded, and his white bones shattered into fragments, cascading down like an avalanche. They tumbled into the ruins, painting everything a visceral, bright red.

A single charred skull rolled down the steps, striking the broken jade with a crisp sound. It clattered against the burned remnants of wood, thudding hollowly, before finally rolling to a soft, muffled stop in the gore. It came to rest directly in front of the kneeling, silver-robed man.

The man stared, insensate. His ears were filled with the roar of thunder, a deafening rumble that drowned out all other sound. He felt the cold rain lashing his face. The rain, conjured by dharma power, could not freeze, but it carried a chill that pierced him to the bone.

His profound senses were linked to his grotto-heaven; he could still rise and flee. But he knew it was meaningless. Everything was already over.

The young man kept his head bowed, kneeling in the deluge, staring blankly at the charred skull.

"Splat."

The sound of profound boots stepping through the viscera was distinct. A pair of gold-and-white boots stopped in front of him. The man remained motionless, head down. A long time passed before he heard the Daoist's voice.

"Li Suining."

He showed a flicker of reaction. His voice was low and hoarse.

"Why."

The Daoist raised his hand, palm flat. The Heavenly Nurture Urn in the sky immediately fell into his grasp. It shook violently, as if a ferocious beast were trapped inside.

As the Spiritual Treasure trembled, pools of mercury-like liquid and Cinnabar began to manifest in the air. The man chuckled.

"Why? Naturally, because your abilities were too great. So great that they had to deploy me."

Li Suining raised his chin. His gaze was now utterly calm.

"Lord Yao, you've slaughtered your way to the lake in a great massacre. What standing does this give the Song Emperor?"

The Daoist casually tossed the Spiritual Treasure into his sleeve, and all the strange phenomena vanished. He gazed quietly at the sky, his expression one of wistful regret.

"Originally, no one cared about King Wei colluding with Yang Zhuo. Their Daos are different, after all. But now... I suppose this counts as 'fulfilling' their ambitions."

Li Suining's expression darkened. He numbly followed the Daoist's gaze. Torrents of water and fire were rising from the south. Beneath the profound darkness, a single column of white qi soared into the sky, flickering unstably.

'In the South, verifying True Qi.'

He felt a chill seep into his bones, unable to comprehend it.

'The Song Emperor is verifying the Dao? At this time? Why? On what grounds?'

'It's too soon... Everything is too soon... How could this happen... Can they just achieve verification whenever they wish it?'

The thoughts in his mind seemed to shatter like glass struck by lightning. He whipped his head back in panic, staring at the northern sky. There, beneath the heavy pall of clouds, he finally saw it: a faint golden light, falling, flickering like a dying sunset, barely visible on the distant horizon.

'In the North, verifying Bright Yang.'

Li Suining snapped his eyes shut as tears streamed down his face. A scalding heat boiled in his chest. He could no longer restrain his grief and choked out,

"We just wanted a path to survive! You wanted King Wei to complete the Quest for Gold, and he already reached the Wei capital..."

"Why? Why couldn't you wait even one moment!"

"RUMBLE!"

The flashing lightning illuminated his face. The rain grew more ferocious. Thunderbolts writhed in the sky, greedily eyeing the earth. The Daoist-robed man planted his long spear upright in the bloody water and watched him quietly.

"Things have already been taken to their extreme, Li Suining."

The violent rain sent ripples through the blood, which began to flow in swift currents. Yet, the torrent parted around the Daoist's golden boots, leaving a clean patch of ground. Yao Guanyi spoke softly.

"For Bright Yang to fall and imperial power to wane is certainly what the great lord wishes. But is there only one great lord on the mountain? Who among them doesn't have disciples and beloved students? In the eyes of some, it is naturally for the best if King Wei verifies his gold and then perishes."

"I certainly did not wish to destroy my own future, but the grudge for Xuanlou's death had to be avenged. As it happens, this also fulfills their desires."

Li Suining's voice was a raw rasp.

"Then what about the Underworld? What about the Song Emperor?"

Yao Guanyi laughed but did not answer. He began to pace silently, as if unwilling to speak. But seeing Li Suining, his clan annihilated, his own death imminent, Yao Guanyi finally hesitated. Whether out of pity or respect, he spoke.

"Li Suining, what is 'curbing indulgence with righteous nature'?"

Li Suining knelt in the storm, his bloodshot eyes fixed on the Daoist.

Yao Guanyi met his gaze and said flatly, "'Righteous' means to protect, persevere, and elevate the king. It is order, governance, correction, and stability. It is the proper sovereign. 'Indulgence' means evil emerging from nowhere. It is treachery, license, desire, and chaos. It is transgression."

"Killing the king. Is it 'righteous' or 'indulgent'?"

"This 'righteous nature'... is it King Wei, or the Wei Emperor?"

Li Suining's brows shot up. Bloody tears streamed down his cheeks as he spat,

"If that's the case, why the hypocrisy! Yang Zhuo made no promise, how dares he claim to be 'True'!"

Yao Guanyi was silent for a long moment before speaking.

"If a King can depose an Emperor, he is upholding righteousness and executing a tyrant. If he attempts regicide and falls, he is 'indulgent' and has been struck down by Heaven. Succeed, and he becomes the righteous king; fail, and he is the indulgent rebel. It has been thus since ancient times. The Song Emperor is confident, and he also believes King Wei can succeed. He is, naturally, no hypocrite."

Li Suining said hoarsely, "So you just wanted King Wei to fail. Killing Wei Xuanyin, slaying the Yan Crown Prince... those were just excuses. It was because King Wei's destiny was too strong that you had to besiege him early, force him to attempt the Quest for Gold while his kingdom was broken and his armies in chaos. Then you immediately executed the imperial clan to damage his destiny."

Yao Guanyi turned his head away.

"It's more than that. This matter... I am not the one in charge."

But Li Suining no longer cared. He stared into the endless darkness and said quietly,

"Even if you manage to fix this, if King Wei fails to gain the position, the fact that the Song Emperor supported him can never be erased."

Yao Guanyi stood in the rain for a moment. A slow smile crept across his lips. He raised the long spear again, weighing it in his palm, and laughed.

"Li Suining, you are wrong. You, King Wei... you are all travelers lost in the fog."

"You stand here in Jiangnan, looking north at the Seven Aspects and the great families, and you see such foolishness! They clearly know the mountain will force King Wei to attempt the Quest for Gold—the only question is success or failure—yet they all think they can seize destiny. They throw themselves into the fire, one after another, until nothing is left but a sea of blood..."

"But from the North, your Jiangnan looks exactly the same."

"Do you think the Underworld needs Yang Zhuo to 'seek the True'? That they are begging him to take the throne? Do you think the Underworld can accomplish nothing without him? That thought... it's no different from those monks in the North who believe Mount Luoxia truly doesn't care about King Wei!"

"Li Suining, you are wrong!"

Bright lightning once again seared the night sky. Yao Guanyi's face was a mask of self-mockery. The spear had turned, aiming down his arm at the young man on the ground.

"How could the great figures base their critical plans on the actions of a lowly cultivator!"

He spoke flatly, but his words were like a wisp of spectral wind, terrifying and deep.

"Yang Zhuo _is_ King Wei. He is the Underworld's King Wei."

"They want him to 'seek,' but they do not require him to 'succeed.' Mount Luoxia sees King Wei as a tool. How much more highly do you think the Underworld views Yang Zhuo? As long as he makes the attempt, as long as he quests for gold, the matter is settled."

Li Suining's pupils dilated. He stared at the Daoist in utter disbelief, then slowly lowered his head. The long spear was piercing his chest, pinning him to the bloody ground. An intense, hollowing emptiness washed over him.

"Pff."

His life-mandate was entrusted to his grotto-heaven; he had countless ways to escape. But in the presence of this Great Daoist Master, whose divine ability was perfected, all of it was empty talk. The 'Heaven-Governing' divine ability and its dharma power faded, bit by bit, as the Spiritual Treasure was withdrawn. The silver-robed man coughed up great mouthfuls of illusory, glittering color.

These colors dissolved into a chaotic mass of starlight. Constellations shifted, traversing the Great Void, leaping and floating, rising and falling in the bloody deluge, before quickly dissipating like smoke. His figure scattered like the wind. Yao Guanyi stood silently in the storm, staring blankly at the ground.

In the last moments of his life, Li Suining's head slowly drooped. The storm grew more terrifying, now mixed with snow and ice. The bones and blood beneath his knees were swallowed by the rushing torrent.

For an instant, the Great Void trembled. Something bright and brilliant flashed. A massive, eggshell-like curtain of light appeared over the ruined island, as if a paradise were falling from the heavens.

"RUMBLE!"

An unknown time passed. The air flashed hot and cold. From within the roiling waves of qi, a faint, multicolored light began to flow. A middle-aged man stood in the surging river of blood, silent. The six short swords at his waist swayed, chiming softly.

His slender, phoenix-like eyes stared gently at the blood at his feet. He watched the current sweep away the fine ice, winding into the darkness. Near the shore, the water was dark red, ice crystals clinking. In the distance, it was still azure. It was just as the poem said: _Half the river shivers, half the river's red._

This Great Daoist Master of Mount Luoxia lowered his gaze and said dejectedly, 

"Today is the Beginning of Spring. You... you really know how to pick a day."

Yao Guanyi seemed to understand. He smiled.

"Since disciple-brother spoke, how could Guanyi dare to disappoint?"

Xueyang did not smile. He stood stiffly, his back to Yao Guanyi. He felt no joy, only a profound sorrow and confusion that sealed his lips in a long silence.

Yao Guanyi, however, tossed away the profound spear. He undid his robes, removed his immortal crown, and let his hair fall loose, a look of wild freedom on his face.

He laughed.

"Disciple-brother... you're here to clean house, aren't you!"

---

The cave-dwelling was utterly silent. A faint luster shone from the white-jade table, where a thick sheepskin map lay covered in dust. On it, the ink depicting the great river was dark and heavy, winding and soaring, its colors bright.

The youth sleeping against the main seat twitched, as if trapped in a nightmare. The silver light between his brows flickered and pulsed, rapid as a panicked breath. After an unknown time, his eyes snapped open.

"Pfft!"

Li Suining spat a mouthful of blood onto the floor. It wasn't red; it spattered like a solid, scattering into a spray of fine, bright silver motes. His gaze was ice-cold, fixed on the ground, his face rapidly turning a ghastly, pale white.

"Cough, cough..."

The piercing, death-like suffocation in his chest lingered. Li Suining's eyes rapidly filled with blood. He braced himself on the floor with one hand, pressing the other to his forehead. The world spun before him, a dizzying blur.

A long time passed before the young man let out a shuddering breath. He looked around, dazed. The agonizing pain still echoed in his mind, but it couldn't suppress the sheer horror rising in his eyes.

He sat blankly for a moment, then scrambled to turn around, looking at the main seat behind him.

After one look, he began to laugh.

"Hahahahaha..."

It started as a faint buzz, but it grew louder and louder. He laughed until he was doubled over, laughed until his eyes were crimson, laughed until tears streamed down his face. He collapsed onto the ground, heedless of his image, his face pale, but he could not stop laughing.

'Yao Guanyi... so that was it... Yao Guanyi... so that was the reason!'

'So—you were watching all along!'

After another long while, Li Suining stood up, feeling as if he had returned from another life. He looked around, reluctant to let the feeling go, confirming that his life-mandate was still his own. The Heaven-Governing Thunder Mansion was still resting in his sea of qi.

Wave after wave of dizziness washed over his Shengyang Acupoint. He couldn't speak. He soon knelt back down, closing his eyes.

After a long time, Li Suining wiped the tears from his eyes. His expression became decisive once more. He extended two fingers and pinched a smear of the silver powder that his blood had become.

'This was transformed by the 'Heaven-Governing' divine mystery.'

In his past life, Li Suining had surpassed the Foundation Establishment Realm. He possessed a completely different level of Dao-Profundity and experience. Combining the drilling pain in his mind with the intense dizziness at his acupoint, he understood at a glance.

'This is the price of the Heavenly Element... My life-mandate... has most likely been damaged.'

But he didn't care. He brushed the silver glow from his fingertips as if it were nothing but incense ash. Li Suining stood up again and pushed open the cave door. The moonlight was bright and clear, casting a pure radiance. A cold chill hit his face.

He hurried across the steps and pulled up the old man who was leaning against them.

"How long has it been?" he asked in a low voice.

The old man yelped, "Aiya! Young Master Ning, you're finally out of seclusion! A lot of people came by asking... they all said... they..."

Li Suining's gaze suddenly locked onto the old man's face. The bloody, mangled image from his vision flashed in his eyes, pouncing like a hungry wolf. He turned his head away, overcome, his face pale.

Old Man Du was observant. He hadn't finished his sentence before he noticed the young man's strange expression and quickly changed his tune.

"Young Master Ning... today... is the eleventh year of Martial Cultivation. Only three days of the first month have passed... You... You've been in seclusion for a whole year!"

Li Suining closed his eyes, forcing the tears back. His voice was hoarse.

"Is it the Beginning of Spring?"

"Yes, it's the Beginning of Spring."

He suppressed the hatred and fear in his heart, murmuring as if still in a nightmare,

"Is the lake frozen?"

"Replying to ge'er... the cold has lingered late these past two years. It's all frozen solid."
