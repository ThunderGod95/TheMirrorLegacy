# Chapter 911: Suzhu

Li Ximing pinched a thread of mana off and flicked his finger, lighting the mana lanterns on either side. Brilliant light spilled forth as he pushed open the vermillion doors. Spiritual qi surged toward him in a wave, whipping his robe into a flurry.

The space was dim, lit only by the faint glow of the active formation. The hall itself was square, no more than thirty meters across in either direction. Lanterns flared on the walls, revealing a few stone tables and chairs casually set about. Formation markings crisscrossed the floor in interwoven threads of red and black.
𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝕨𝕖𝗯𝚗𝚘𝕧𝕖𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝕞

The Meng family's fire vein, forged of bronze and inlaid with eight pieces of scarlet iron, was in the center, emanating a deep crimson glow. Li Ximing quickly spotted a spirit spring tucked into a corner. Its quality was quite poor, and it burbled forth with sluggish, bubbling water.

Ding-dong...

The clear spirit water resumed flowing along the carved channels in the ground, trickling into the quenching pool with a gentle tinkle. He estimated that it had likely been decades since anyone had set foot here. Yet the spirit spring had continued to emit spiritual qi, causing the energy to clog and the springhead to grow obstructed.

Having spent many years in alchemy, Li Ximing was very familiar with fire veins. He placed a hand on the bronze pedestal of the fire vein and, just as he expected, it was scalding hot.

This Meng family fire vein is indeed excellent; there’s even Li Fire mixed in. It’s truly a treasure for refining. Decades of accumulated Fiend Fire in the formation has nearly melted the pedestal.

Meng Mansion had been abandoned for decades. Li Ximing figured that had he come any later, the bronze pedestal might have melted entirely, unleashing a surge of Li Fire that would have devastated the entire cave residence.

When he saw that the Meng Mansion was utterly deserted, he thought to himself, Strange. She should have returned at least once... and yet, not even once?

Somehow, now that he was certain the Meng Mansion was empty, he felt an immediate sense of relief. His mood lightened, and his steps grew brisk. Li Ximing had always been quick to regain his composure and was adept at casting aside emotions. He promptly began to consider how best to handle the place.

"First, secure the fire vein."

One hand formed a seal while he reached for his waist with the other. A small vial, two fingers wide, leaped into the air. It was white-gold at the base and inscribed with intricate dark-silver patterns. It shimmered faintly in the light.

"Profound Patterned Bottle!"

This dharma artifact had long since been passed to Li Ximing, and he had refined it for some time. It converted his mana into Bright Yang mana, which gave off a bright and radiant glow. He formed a seal and activated the formation on the bronze pedestal. Almost immediately, a stream of black-red Fiend Fire burst forth.

This fiendish fire was laced with Li Fire and blazingly intense. It was far more vicious than normal. Yet several wisps of radiant light emerged from Li Ximing’s Profound Patterned Bottle. They descended through the air in hazy veils, like gossamer, and settled upon the Fiend Fire, instantly subduing it.

He had refined the Profound Patterned Bottle, and once infused with Bright Yang mana, the dharma artifact glowed brightly. It possessed two remarkable abilities. The first was Radiant Light, which could suppress evil, assist in flight, or dispel demons. It bore the typical characteristics of Bright Yang, decent in strength, though not especially powerful.

"Better than nothing."

That had always been the bottle's flaw. While its ability to adapt to various types of mana made it rather unique, its effects were somewhat akin to those of an Immortal Foundation and often lacked the raw strength to truly make up for any deficiencies.

Fortunately, its second ability was more intriguing. Known as Unified Qi, it could gather Radiant Light and fuse it with flames, storing the mixture within the bottle for refining. It could then be unleashed in a burst during battle. The longer it was refined, the more formidable it would become.

Its function resembled Li Qinghong’s method of storing Profound Lightning. The longer it was refined, the stronger it became. Unfortunately, once the Radiant Light and flame were fused together, they could never be separated again.

He had grown quite fond of the artifact and wasted no time putting it to use. Forming a seal, he quickly activated the technique. Radiant Light spiraled down, and drew the surging Fiend Fire, tinged with scattered traces of Li Fire, into a pillar of black and red flame that was streaked with glowing crimson sparks.

The Profound Patterned Bottle sought pure Li Fire, but the Fiend Fire was far too muddled. It was ordinarily difficult to refine. But it was effortless for Li Ximing. He gently curled his fingers of his free hand, activating the talisman qi Valley Wind Leading Fire within his body.

The black pillar of fire instantly shrank to fit into his palm. The crimson Li Fire peeled off and streamed into the bottle. In less than fifteen minutes, he had drained the formation of all its accumulated power.

The fire-controlling capability of Valley Wind Leading Fire had yet to show any limits. For most cultivators, this much Fiend Fire would have been overwhelming, but in his hands, it shrank to no more than the size of a fingertip. It would take a whole cart’s worth of ordinary qi bottles to contain it. Only the Cuoxiang artifact back home could manage it.

Left with no better option, Li Ximing simply held it in his hand. He glanced around carefully. Several stone chambers were protected by Meng Family formations. Though they were meaningless to him, barging in still felt inappropriate.

"This place isn’t bad. If time permits, I could return a few more times to extract Li Fire for artifact refinement," muttered Li Ximing.

He made a thorough circuit of the hall, which was pitch-black and empty. Snuffing out a few lanterns, he closed the doors behind him and sighed inwardly, I was born for the Purple Mansion Realm. If I fail, I die. The time is drawing near. I’ll return to make a final push in seclusion with a thirty percent chance of life and seventy of death. I had hoped to see her one last time, to make amends for the mistakes of my youth... but fate won’t allow it. There won’t be a chance.

Li Ximing strode out, rose from the bright salt reef, and gazed over the vast sea. Then he took off northward on his Radiant Light, sudden clarity blooming in his heart, "Talisman qi is a marvel unlike any other. It’s far more than a means of advancing one’s cultivation. If I study it with care, I’m sure I’ll gain much. My family has been famous in Jiangnan for generations and talisman qi has played a part in that.

"If I can cultivate divine abilities and avoid death, then it’s worth delving deeper here. But if I fail to reach the Purple Mansion Realm, then no research will matter."

He calmed himself and scouted southward for a while. Soon, Li Xijun came flying over from afar, riding the wind in haste. His white garments had frosted over, giving him a slightly travel-worn look. His longsword had only just returned to its scabbard, and a sharp sword intent still lingered around him.

Li Ximing immediately tensed and asked a single question. "What happened?"

"Nothing." Li Xijun looked a little embarrassed and gave a vague reply.

But Li Ximing wasn’t about to let it go. After repeated questioning, the young man finally hugged his sword to his chest and said helplessly, "I ran into a snake demon. She insisted I accompany her into the sea to be a guest in her palace. I refused several times. She couldn’t take the rejection and sent people after me. I had to fight my way out with my sword."

"Huh?" Li Ximing was genuinely stunned for a moment, then belatedly asked, "A female demon?"

"Yes." Li Xijun replied helplessly. It was rare for Li Ximing to see him like this, so he let out a couple of questioning hums.

But Li Xijun misunderstood his intent and shook his head. "Don’t worry. I held back and I didn’t hurt anyone. She seemed like someone with connections and didn’t dare make a real move. It was more like a game to her."

"Hahaha." Li Ximing laughed, amused to see him looking so awkward. He teased, "Brother Xijun, you really should stay away from the Eastern Sea. I fear one day, some dragon princess might snatch you away while you’re flying over the rippling Converging Water and take you to the Dragon Palace as her husband."

"Spare me your mockery, brother." Li Xijun shook his head, redirecting the conversation. A flash of pale light passed through his pupils as he noticed something amiss and asked, "Where did you go, Brother? Why is your entire body filled with fire energy?"

"Your perception technique grows sharper by the day." Li Ximing shook his head as he replied, "These Suzhu Reefs are teeming with Li Fire. I happened to find a fire vein infused with it and drew out some mixed Li Fire to refine my artifact."

His harvest had been fruitful, so he felt rather cheerful and continued, "It’s often said that the Profound Patterned Bottle overlaps with the wielder’s Immortal Foundation. But perhaps its creator specialized in Bright Yang and crafted it with that in mind. This ability to merge Radiant Light and flame into Unified Qi—it's quite ingenious! It fills a gap in my own cultivation."

He had mentioned it to Li Xijun before, so the white-robed youth already knew about his artifact’s function.

He caressed his sword as he commented casually, "Consider it a lucky surprise, at least something that complements your path. Though I doubt it was crafted with such precision. Bright Yang cultivators have all sorts of offensive means, from seizing celestial light to capturing flames, that it just happens to match. In someone else’s hands, it might not have been of much use. Fortunately, it suits you."

Li Ximing rolled his eyes. The two exchanged a glance and couldn’t help but chuckle before setting off together to survey the surrounding area.

Suzhu Island.

The Suzhu Island marketplace had a distinctly ancient charm, with most of its structures built in the style of pavilions. The island’s paths formed a dense network, all crafted from crimson stone that seemed neat and orderly at a glance. However, Li Qinghong, who had a discerning eye, took one careful look and surmised it was part of a formation.

"The roads resemble formation patterns, how interesting."

Li Qinghong descended onto a circular platform. She was accompanied by a cultivator from Hengzhu Dao Gate, robed in crimson with golden shamanic patterns embroidered along his sleeves. He gave her a careful look and immediately made his assessment, This person's attire is elegant and refined, yet quite archaic in style. Her dharma artifact appears to involve Profound Thunder. She’s either from a Northern Sea esteemed family or a direct descendant of an immortal sect.

He had been stationed here to receive guests for quite some time and had grown skilled at picking out Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. He stepped forward politely but confidently to greet her, "I am Bi Qiaoyu. May I ask where Fellow Daoist hails from?"

Li Qinghong paused. She realized the man before her was a sharp-looking, elderly cultivator. When she caught sight of the shrewd look he had about him, she swallowed the words 'Eastern Sea' that had been on her lips.

"I'm from the mainland," she said.

Hearing her soft, fluid and gentle tone, yet with well-separated syllables, Bi Qiaoyu immediately made his own judgment, Jiangnan. Likely from Northern Yue or Jiangbei.

He smiled at once and replied, "Since Fellow Daoist has graced us with your presence, I’d be glad to accompany you for a stroll if you're here to sightsee. If you’ve come for serious matters, there’s no need to crowd with the others. You can just discuss matters with me directly."

Li Qinghong lowered her eyes slightly and entered the formation alongside him. She found the place to be extremely orderly. Hengzhu Dao Gate’s vetting procedures were strict, and Bi Qiaoyu had a wealth of experience. She likely wouldn’t be able to hide much from him.

After all, I cultivate thunder arts; it's the least suited for disguise. My aura is hard to conceal... Fortunately, I let the other two arrive later, one after the other. They aren’t well-known, so they shouldn’t be recognized immediately.

Since she couldn’t fully hide her identity, it wasn’t convenient to inquire directly about the Bright Yang spirit item. Instead, she spoke gently, "I may be looking for some spirit items. Does your Dao Gate happen to have any rare treasures that could broaden my horizons?"

"Please!"

Her choice of words made Bi Qiaoyu let out a hoarse laugh. Saying nothing more, he led the way toward the island's center, flying past numerous pavilions until a grand vermillion palace came into view at the heart of Suzhu Island.
𝕗𝗿𝕖𝐞𝐰𝗲𝕓𝐧𝕠𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝐨𝚖

A cultivator from Hengzhu Dao Gate flew up the red steps ahead of them, bowed to the two, then stepped aside to stand behind Bi Qiaoyu.

His voice was carried by a thread of mana into the old man’s ear, "It’s been confirmed. Eight or nine out of ten, she's Li Qinghong of the Li Family from Moongaze Lake, cultivator of Celestial Thunder."

Bi Qiaoyu’s expression didn’t change. He continued leading Li Qinghon through the vermillion hall, bypassing the first floor and ascending onto the second. There, dozens of formation-marked doors lined the area.

He turned back and spoke softly, "These are all treasured panaceas and Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items. May I ask which type you’re looking for? Celestial Thunder, perhaps?"

Leaving her hands behind her back, Li Qinghong replied with a faint smile, "Do you happen to have any Purple Mansion Realm spirit items? My family owes a favor to a Daoist Master, and I doubt he’d care for anything less."

"That..." Bi Qiaoyu was genuinely stunned for a moment. In his nearly century-long tenure here, he had rarely seen anyone seeking Purple Mansion Realm spirit items. But Li Qinghong’s reasoning was sound, and he felt no suspicion.

He responded courteously, "That’s beyond this old man's authority. Please allow me to report to the Island Master. She will respond directly."

This meant summoning Island Master Bi Yuzhuang in person, which played right into Li Qinghong’s plans. She had heard of a past connection between Bi Yuzhuang and Li Xuanfeng in the Green Pine Grotto Heaven. While she didn’t know how deep that relationship ran, having any link was better than none.

And besides, for matters regarding Changxiao Gate... I’ll need someone with sufficient weight to negotiate.

"Of course." She answered warmly. The man behind Bi Qiaoyu immediately withdrew, and the two began ascending the stairs.

Naturally, Li Qinghong wouldn’t let the opportunity slip by. She asked in a seemingly casual tone, "On my way here, I saw some cultivators from the Immortal Dao engaged in fierce combat. Do you happen to know what’s going on?"

Though many liked to call Hengzhu Dao Gate part of the Immortal Gates, the Bi Family had never officially claimed that status. They only referred to themselves as part of the Immortal Dao.

Li Qinghong’s repeated use of the correct term pleased Bi Qiaoyu, and he inwardly affirmed, Someone this familiar with our terminology, she’s definitely from the Li family of Moongaze Lake.

He let out a long sigh and explained, "What else could it be? Our gate has long been at odds with Changxiao Gate. Years ago, Changxiao and our Daoist Master Hengli clashed over a cultivation opportunity. That battle was so fierce it nearly tore the sky apart. It only ceased after several other Daoist Masters intervened to mediate.

"Later, Jiangnan was reclassified as the Upper Evil Spirit Storage, leading to the rise of Earth Virtue devil cultivators. Daoist Master Chengyan happened to get lucky and successfully cultivated Wu Earth. Since Earth Virtue phenomena are notoriously hard to detect, he broke through in secret under Changxiao’s protection and killed several of our core disciples. Then, he was wounded by Daoist Master Hengxing. With old grudges and new, there’s no reconciling them now."

Li Qinghong silently memorized the detail about Daoist Master Chengyan cultivating Wu Earth. She furrowed her brow slightly; the conflict between the two reef territories in the Eastern Sea didn't seem all that intense.

She asked deliberately, "I see. And since Qingzhou and Suzhu are so close, it must be tense most days."

"Isn’t that the truth..." Though Bi Qiaoyu was an elder cultivator, the reason she’d asked about the spirit item related to Yu Fuzi was too indirect. He was far from being able to piece it together from just a few of Li Qinghong’s words. He sighed. "Exactly... I’m over two hundred now, far too old to care for more conflict. Wouldn’t a little harmony be nice? But the young and hot-blooded Yu Fuzi doesn’t think that way.

"Just half a year ago, he struck again in the Eastern Sea, quietly killing several of our disciples and even wiping out a spirit boat. The Island Master sent a few rogue cultivators to question him, but he shamelessly denied everything, then arrogantly drove them off!"

Bi Qiaoyu let out a breath, his voice tinged with anger as he continued, "He's just like his master, no good at all! Always so quick to take lives... and always targeting the younger generation with hidden attacks!"

Li Qinghong felt a subtle relief rise in her heart as she thought to herself, Good... the conflict between the two sides is indeed intense. I don’t know Island Master Bi Yuzhuang well, and persuading her would’ve been difficult. This way, I’ll save myself the trouble.

She waited in the hall until a female cultivator draped in a red robe landed before the palace. Her skin was fair and tender, and her features were distinct from those of Jiangnan. She had higher brows and larger eyes, while the bright red robe made her look all the more dazzling.

She wore pale moon-colored inner garments beneath her vibrant red robe, paired with golden bangles at her sleeves, further elevating her refined aura. Both eyes twinkled as she smiled and said, "I am Bi Yuzhuang. Greetings, fellow Daoist. Might you be from the Moongaze Li Family?"

"I am Li Qinghong of the Moongaze Li Family. Greetings, senior," Li Qinghong responded naturally. Beside her, Bi Qiaoyu clasped his hands and swiftly withdrew.

Bi Yuzhuang made a 'please' gesture, the golden bangles on her wrist jingling as she smiled and said, "You are too polite, Qinghong. Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng and I fought side by side at Green Pine Temple and share some camaraderie."

Bi Yuzhuang led her all the way to the highest crimson pavilion. It contained only a red-lacquered wooden table, upon which sat a jade vase with a few diagonally arranged white plum blossoms.

The two of them sat down. Bi Yuzhuang poured some tea and said gently, "Daoist Master Chang Yun of Jiangbei used the Golden Feather Sect’s favor to establish a gate in Chengshui Marsh and called it Chengyun Gate. He even claimed a territory for it. The Golden Tang Gate has also reopened its mountain gate and begun sending disciples down the mountain.

"The current sect leader of Chengyun Sect is Zhong Qian. He shares a deep friendship with Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng. Your family could consider sending someone to establish that connection."

Bi Yuzhuang finished steeping the tea, glanced at her, and smiled. "I worried that you’ve been away from the mainland too long and might not be up to date, so I thought I’d offer a word."

Li Qinghong quickly said she wouldn’t dare. Her heart warmed toward Bi Yuzhuang, and she silently thought, Hengzhu Dao is after all one of the most orthodox among the great Daos... and since they’re on friendly terms with my family, she should be trustworthy.

After a few casual exchanges, Bi Yuzhuang soon brought the conversation around to the topic at hand. "The Purple Mansion Realm spirit items you need on this island, Qinghong, are known best by me. Though the Eastern Sea now surges with thunder, if you're seeking items like Celestial Thunder Blossom or Cloud-Patterned Heavenly Lightning, my family can't retrieve them at the moment."

It was clear that the excuse Li Qinghong used—repaying a favor for a Purple Mansion Daoist Master—had fooled Bi Qiaoyu, but not Bi Yuzhuang, who was a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. She had been probed from her first words.

Fortunately, Li Qinghong had not come for her own cultivation path, and she replied gently, "Thank you for your concern, Senior. It doesn’t have to be Celestial Thunder. Are there any other Purple Mansion Realm spirit items available?"

"Hmm?" Bi Yuzhuang appeared slightly surprised. She raised an eyebrow as a thoughtful expression crossed her face, then casually said, "Items like Quetong Radiance or Sea-Treading Rainbow are mostly found among the Dragon Clan or in Mount Luoxia... Fortunately, my family does possess a Heaven-Guarding Rainbow, which fell during the Northern Sea’s Sky Fracture. It’s rather valuable."

Bi Yuzhuang had already read through the intelligence on the Li Family. She had originally intended to mention that her family also possessed a Purple Mansion Realm Cold Essence, but after recalling from the reports that Li Xijun was still far from the Purple Mansion Realm, she reconsidered. If she exposed Li Qinghong’s excuse too directly, the conversation might end, and she would gain nothing from it.

But Li Qinghong understood from her words that Bi Yuzhuang had clearly assumed her family intended to seize a Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough. She silently turned her teacup without replying.

Sensing something amiss, Bi Yuzhuang simply followed up smoothly and said, "We don’t have Bright Yang either. Only one Cold Essence, one Radiant Essence, and a piece of Azure Manifestation."

No Bright Yang either... Li Qinghong fell silent for a moment, her mind cycling through various ideas before she asked, "If one wished to trade for these spirit items, what would be the terms?"

Bi Yuzhuang lifted her chin slightly and said gently, "Rest assured, Qinghong. My family has always conducted ourselves uprightly and has no need for tricks... It’s just that Purple Mansion Realm spirit items are exceedingly rare. If a trade is to be made... considering your family’s situation, there are a few things that might be viable."

She sipped her tea and continued, "A Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact, ancient Purple Mansion Realm spirit items, cultivation methods from the Hengzhu Dao lineage of the Purple Mansion Realm, and..."

The woman raised her brow and lightly rested her jade-like fingers on the edge of the gold bangle on her other wrist as she tested, "Supreme Yin Moonlight!"

Li Qinghong held her breath, then showed a look of regret and replied with a hint of dejection, "The Immortal Dao still assumes that since our family occupies Moongaze Lake, we must have such a thing... Even if we once truly had a portion, those days are long gone."

Bi Yuzhuang looked a bit embarrassed as she quickly explained, "After all, someone did obtain it from the lake in the past. It’s recorded in the annals of many families. I merely asked in passing."

Li Qinghong did not wish to dwell on the subject and simply nodded in response, "I’ve taken note of your terms, Senior. If our family is able, we will certainly come to trade with the Immortal Dao."

Hengzhu Dao Gate lacking a Bright Yang spirit item was within expectations. Ultimately, Li Qinghong could only pin her hopes on Yu Fuzi. After carefully choosing her words, she asked, "I heard from Senior Qiaoyu that Yu Fuzi has become quite unruly..."

Bi Yuzhuang visibly frowned at the name. Gazing at the white plum blossoms in the vase, she said with some regret, "He’s indeed formidable. The conflict between my gate and Changxiao has lasted a long time. We once entrapped and killed Yunkongzi, but thinking back now, if we had known that Yu Fuzi would follow him, we would’ve spared that useless man’s life..."

There were too many blood debts between the two sides, so Bi Yuzhuang couldn’t go into detail. She simply recounted the general grievances between them.

Li Qinghong understood the situation and inwardly sighed with regret, Bi Yuzhuang’s struggle with Yu Fuzi hasn’t yet reached the point where she’s desperate. Our ties aren’t close enough for her to ask for my help directly either. Otherwise, she’d have offered far more in return.

So be it. Nothing in this world is ever truly perfect.

She let a troubled expression fall across her face as she said in a low voice, "To speak frankly, Senior... He possesses a treasure that is of great importance to my family..."

As soon as those words were spoken, Bi Yuzhuang's expression lit up. Her heart finally cleared, and she suddenly understood, So that’s how it is!

Now even her gaze turned fervent as she said in a low voice, "Your esteemed family means to..."

Li Qinghong sighed and probed, "This is the Eastern Sea, after all. Everything is much easier to handle here, only Daoist Master Changxiao is of concern..."

Bi Yuzhuang shook her head repeatedly and replied quickly, "Qinghong, there’s no need to worry! Our gate’s Daoist Master Shanzhu is far stronger than Chang Xiaozi. Moreover, Chang Xiaozi is not on good terms with Crimson Reef Island and rarely comes to the Eastern Sea. As for Changxiao Gate, they have very few Purple Mansion cultivators. Daoist Master Chengyan rarely leaves the mountain gate, so how could he possibly oversee everything?

"As long as we lure Wang Fu into the grand formation I’ve set and invite Daoist Master Hengxing to offer a blessing, it can all be covered up cleanly as long as no other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators steps in."

Her voice dropped slightly, but her eyes were sharp as she continued, "And even if Changxiao Gate finds out, so what? We’re merely hiring fellow Daoists to act. Your esteemed family has ties to Daoist Master Xiao, and this even nominally falls under the Azure Pond Sect's jurisdiction. What is there to fear? The person dies in the Eastern Sea, and the Eastern Sea has its own rules. Changxiao won’t dare to intervene!"

Li Qinghong understood that despite how nicely she phrased it, this would undoubtedly offend Changxiao Gate. But her family was already mentally prepared for this.

She answered softly, "You are right, Senior."

Delight danced across Bi Yuzhuang’s face. The two gates had schemed against each other for years and were well-acquainted. Moreover, the island masters on both sides were extremely strong and never strayed far from their islands, so it was hard to gain any advantage.

Her own forces stationed in the trading markets were limited and not of high quality. Even if she mobilized them for an ambush, there was no guarantee they could deal with Yu Fuzi. That old thing wouldn’t show himself if he saw a crowd lying in wait.

But Li Qinghong was a formidable combatant with violent and explosive lightning. She was also skilled in swift battles, and so an ideal candidate. So Bi Yuzhuang asked, "How many people can your esteemed family send?"

Li Qinghong replied quietly, "Aside from myself, Ximing is adept at suppression, and Xijun has refined his Sword Essence. The two complement each other and are quite formidable... If things don’t go smoothly, we can dispatch more."

"That’s enough." Bi Yuzhuang let out a heavy breath. Now, whether or not Daoist Master Chengyan of Changxiao Gate had returned to the sect, she felt she had enough control. She immediately replied, "Qinghong, go and make preparations. I will plan everything in detail!"

Li Qinghong rose from the table and took her leave. Bi Yuzhuang immediately summoned someone to escort her. The red-robed woman sipped several mouthfuls of tea and gradually gained clarity in her thoughts.

The Li Family has grown closer to Profound Peak Gate in recent years. Profound Peak Gate likely played a part in steering things, but this could be a good development... In that case, Kong Tingyun’s recent diplomatic easing with Changxiao Gate over Yuezhou Island wasn't a true compromise, but a ploy to lull Wang Fu into complacency...

Bi Yuzhuang had been troubled over the lack of powerful combatants, but now she had gained a direct descendant thunder cultivator of immortal sect pedigree, a late stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator with an Immortal Foundation focused on suppression, and a slightly lower-ranked sword sect descendant. And she herself was one of Hengzhu Dao Gate’s top Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators...

Unless you, Wang Fu, are the second coming of Li Xuanfeng... you will surely suffer this death calamity! Thought Bi Yuzhuang.

————

After settling down in the market district, Li Qinghong was soon approached by Li Xijun and Li Ximing. When the two entered the cave dwelling, Li Qinghong immediately motioned for them to stop and said softly, "This is someone else's cave dwelling. Best not to speak too much."

She flicked her sleeve and tossed out the Chongming Profound Insight Screen. The mystical screen unfurled, releasing several faint golden iridescent rays that enveloped a nine meter radius around them.

Only after the Perception Severance activated did Li Xijun speak in a low, steady voice, "Aunt, I went to Qingzhou Island. Yu Fuzi wasn’t there. I asked around and found that he’s been residing on Xifeng Island nearby. He's occupying an entire island for himself to cultivate in solitude.

"Wang Fu places great importance on family background and loves to boast. Ordinary rogue cultivators can’t even get an audience with him. If we want to purchase the spirit item, we’d likely have to announce our name to gain a meeting.

"He also has quite a foul temperament. From what I can gather, the families close to ours are all on bad terms with Changxiao Gate. He might name an outrageous price and humiliate us for nothing."

The longsword strapped to his back shifted as he said gravely, "We shouldn’t pin our hopes on that. Aligning with Hengzhu Dao Gate is the more reliable choice."

"I’ve heard the same." Li Qinghong appeared somewhat troubled and replied softly, "So long as our family contributes, Hengzhu Dao Gate has promised to cover for us. But it’s hard to be certain. If the situation turns against us... If Yu Fuzi lives, we simply fail to get the spirit item. But if he dies, we fail to obtain the item, and Changxiao Gate discovers our involvement, that would be the most disgraceful outcome."

She shook her head and said, "Our family has good relationships with several immortal gates; Daoist Master Xiao has received us personally; we still hold a favor with Daoist Master Junjian; and we’re quite close with the Si Family. A major incident is unlikely, but we must always prepare for the worst."

Li Qinghong hesitated for a moment, then said softly, "If Changxiao Gate acts overbearingly and insists on settling scores, and the Hengzhu Dao Gate's Daoist Masters cannot be relied upon; if Bi Yuzhuang proves to be two-faced and only seeking to deceive us; if Daoist Master Xiao refuses to intervene and Daoist Master Junjian is too newly advanced to Purple Mansion Realm to be respected by Changxiao... then, at that moment, if I must become the scapegoat, I’ll simply accept death. That would satisfy Changxiao Gate’s pride, and they’d have nothing more to say."

Though her words were softly spoken, they struck like thunder. Li Ximing abruptly raised his head, heart burning like fire.

Beside him, Li Xijun cupped his hands and first reassured Li Ximing, "It will never come to that. Hengzhu Dao Gate has stood on the righteous path for many years. They wouldn’t abandon their stance over something so small. Chang Xiaozi and Hengzhu Dao Gate have long contended in the Eastern Sea. At most, he’ll hold a grudge for losing a move, he wouldn’t go so far as to shatter a piece on the board."

He then continued, "In my view, as long as Hengzhu Dao Gate takes the lead, killing Yu Fuzi won’t be an issue. No need to worry. In fact, I have some good news to report..."

Seeing both Li Qinghong and Li Ximing turn to look at him, he explained, "I was previously worried the Radiant Sky Stone may no longer be on Yu Fuzi’s person! Even though Changxiao Gate is full of vitality and wouldn’t normally seize a junior’s possession, we’re talking about a Purple Mansion Realm spirit item! Couldn’t Chengyan and Changxiao have already taken or exchanged it long ago?

"And even if they haven’t taken it, Yu Fuzi may not be carrying it around. Wouldn’t storing it within the gate be much safer?"

His words struck both listeners like a jolt. Kong Tingyun had mentioned earlier that the item was on Yu Fuzi’s person. Though Yu Fuzi was known for his overbearing nature, what Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator wouldn't bow their head before a Purple Mansion Realm?

Li Ximing felt a headache coming on and said, "This complicates things..."

Li Xijun exhaled softly and replied, "Fortunately, Purple Mansion Realm spirit items aren’t easy to store. Not everyone possesses jade boxes like ours that can contain them before placing them into a storage pouch. Most jade boxes used for such items are like essence-collecting vessels and must be worn close to the body or kept within a formation."

Li Qinghong immediately caught on and gave a subtle nod. As expected, Li Xijun cupped his hands respectfully and said, "Please forgive me, Aunt. I acted without prior notice and used a treasure from the great void to investigate Xifeng Island."

Li Qinghong merely shook her head and said, "What's there to forgive? Don't keep your brother in suspense. Is it there or not?"

Li Xijun smiled gently and replied, "It is!"

Li Ximing immediately let out a breath of relief. His interest was piqued, and he quickly pressed for details.

The white-robed youth smiled and said, "I investigated the island. Wang Fu’s palace is filled with female companions, and is lively and bustling. The treasure is stored in a box made of black jade and placed right on the table in his hall."

"You’re sure you saw it clearly?" Li Ximing asked.

Li Xijun chuckled lightly, "Of course I saw it clearly. I’ve seen the Golden Yang Radiant Origin before. It cannot be seen through gold or iron, and if exposed to copper, water, or wood, it turns to smoke. That’s why it must be sealed in jade or stone boxes.

"There was a white stone the size of a pupil inside the black jade box. It was filled with celestial radiance, and interlaced with dazzlingly bright flames. Its aura belonged to the Bright Yang attribute, so it must be the Radiant Sky Stone!"

Li Ximing finally relaxed at the description. He glanced at the smile on Li Qinghong’s face and shook his head. "Then all is in place. Let’s just hope everything goes smoothly, and that it doesn’t turn for the worse."

Li Xijun nodded with a smile, but suspicion stirred in his heart. Ever cautious and prone to overthinking, he couldn’t help but wonder, There’s just one thing...
