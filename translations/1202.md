# Chapter 1202: An End to Fortune's Run

The man with vertical pupils held a casual gaze, his hands clasped simply behind his back, yet the Daoist Master in the cave dwelling felt a bone-chilling terror.

In a daze, the multicolored light within the cave dwelling shifted subtly. As the man stepped inside, he had already transformed into a middle-aged man with a simple and honest face, smiling with his arms crossed.

He exuded an air of pure qi, like a lofty cultivator who had attained the Dao, yet a divine ability veiled him, lending him a profound air. He spoke softly:

"Brother Fuxun!"

Liu Changdie stood frozen in place. The Demon King on the couch scrambled to his feet and came to welcome him with unconcealed joy, saying:

"Daoist friend Chiyi, you've come! I have been waiting for you for a long time!"

The smile on his face was genuine. Though he was unsteady on his feet, he still struggled forward to greet him, saying:

"When the pain flares up, it’s truly torturous... Please, take a look!"

The middle-aged man acted as if Liu Changdie wasn't there, helping Fuxun up and affectionately squeezing his hand. After a moment of sensing, a look of delight appeared in his eyes as he replied:

"It's just a little pain. Soon, very soon!"

As the man squeezed his hand, Fuxun seemed to feel much better and the pain lessened. He pulled Liu Changdie over and made an introduction:

"This is my good friend, Daoist Master Yuanbian!"

Liu Changdie had remained silent, not having spoken a word. Fuxun turned again and said:

"This is Daoist friend Chiyi of the Si Sea, he is very capable!"

Seeing that Liu Changdie remained silent, the middle-aged man nodded cheerfully and said:

"I've heard of Yuanbian's reputation—you live on Long Helm Island, was it? I'm quite familiar with the place. A family secretly established a cave dwelling there once, but they later offended a powerful figure and their entire clan was wiped out. An elder of mine even went to have a look back then..."

Liu Changdie's lips trembled, and he finally broke his silence, saying:

"I was not aware that Daoist friend possessed such abilities. May I ask which sect or clan you belong to?"

The middle-aged man's gaze slowly shifted away as he said with a smile:

"I don't belong to any particular sect or clan. My ancestors achieved some merit and claimed a few oceans, but they later perished while seeking the Dao. We couldn't hold on to our territories, losing them one by one until only a single stretch in the east remained—and even that isn't enough for the descendants to divide!"

Liu Changdie's lips turned pale as he understood the man's meaning. Fuxun, however, sighed and said:

"It is difficult indeed. The territories of the outer seas have always been tough to hold. They are barren, after all, and occupying just this one stretch of sea is certainly not enough..."

"Exactly!"

The middle-aged man sighed, taking a jade box from his sleeve as he spoke casually:

"By this generation, our branch of the family is no longer so prosperous. We fought with another family, you see, and lost an elder. Although an old ancestor later took revenge and destroyed that family's foundation, the loss could never be recouped."

He opened the jade box. Liu Changdie took a sip of tea to hide his expression, faintly hearing a rumbling from outside. He spoke with a strained voice:

"How strange. To think there would be the sound of thunder so deep beneath the sea."

"Heh."

The middle-aged man said coldly:

"It's nothing strange. Perhaps someone's mount is passing by."

Liu Changdie wiped the sweat from his face. Inside the other's jade box lay a brilliant pill, shrouded in mist, looking as if it might take flight at any moment. Chiyi smiled and said:

"Take it with boiling tea!"

Fuxun hastily accepted it. Liu Changdie could no longer restrain himself; his lips moved, and steeling himself, he set down his cup as the divine ability within him suddenly erupted!

Vault-Beam Silver!

His divine ability was a form of Vault Metal, a rare art for perceiving collected treasures, which possessed a unique profundity that allowed him to stealthily detect items within formations and valuables within boxes; the moment he activated it, he instantly saw through the man's disguise.

The man stood there, and behind him trailed four supremely brilliant streams of color, which intermingled and dispersed, then converged into a blazing white light, causing yin to recede and yang to flourish—an ability of infinite marvels!

'A Great Daoist Master of the Lesser Yang Realm!'

But for the first time, his ever-successful divine ability hit a wall; in the very instant he saw the man clearly, the middle-aged man had already turned his head with sharp perception!

His face had transformed into a sinister visage of crimson and white. His sideburns, thick and lush, were a mix of crimson and gold, framing his jaw. The pair of pitch-black vertical pupils were far more terrifying than they had been outside the cave dwelling—narrow, sharp, and filled with a profound coldness and disgust.

Golden scales, vertical pupils, narrow eyes, a high-bridged nose, and a mane of hair.

'A dragon.'

'A Lesser Yang Dragon King with four divine abilities, at the Great Daoist Master level.'

Having spent many years navigating the overseas regions, how could Liu Changdie not recognize this!

'No wonder... no wonder the Li clan treated the matter with such inexplicable apprehension, refusing to speak a word. So that's how it is... that's how it is... Yes, in the eyes of a great demon, he is a medicinal ingredient. Even a race as noble as the Dragon-kin would covet him...'

'I've doomed him... I never should have asked him to come to the Eastern Sea!'

Dragon-kin reached the Purple Mansion Realm upon adulthood, but few among them could attain the Purple Mystery. This person had to be a renowned Dragon King. The moment he revealed his true face outside the cave dwelling wasn't carelessness; it was a silent warning to keep his mouth shut!

Liu Changdie's heart pounded with terror, a bitter taste filling his mouth.

'It could only be them... Fuxun has cultivated three divine abilities, and his power to evade disaster has reached an incredible level. He even managed to escape an attack from the White Victory Dao. How many powers are there that could make him lower his guard completely?'

A bitter and sour feeling welled up within him, his heart hammering against his ribs. He didn't dare move under the other's gaze:

'How can I even think of saving him... I can't even protect myself!'

Liu Changdie could only lower his gaze and turn his head away. The brief moment seemed to stretch into an eternity. He opened his mouth to speak several times, but the other's warning echoed in his ears, and no words came out.

Fuxun took the pill with a smile. Only then did the man withdraw his gaze, looking at Fuxun with a broad smile as he said:

"Congratulations... This is truly fate. I haven't seen such a precious bloodline in many years... If not for this, how could the matter have been resolved in a mere ninety days!"

Fuxun was about to speak but paused in a daze. Chiyi seemed to be waiting for a specific moment and said lightly:

"I really must thank them. To think they had hidden such a treasure here. If not for a fortunate coincidence, they would have succeeded in keeping it concealed..."

The meaning was now perfectly clear. Liu Changdie turned his head stiffly to see Fuxun already bent over in pain, dazed and dizzy. The chill in his heart reached its peak, yet Chiyi stood up with great concern, took the Demon King's hand, and patted his shoulder as if he were a priceless treasure.

Fuxun's face alternated between shades of ashen and blue before he suddenly lost consciousness. His head lolled back and he fell, tumbling to the ground with a thud. As he reached out, grasping for something, Liu Changdie felt a wringing pain in his heart and clenched his cup tightly.

Seeing Fuxun collapsed on the ground and curled into a ball, a triumphant smile finally appeared on the Dragon King's face. He let go, stood up, and without another glance at Fuxun, said with a laugh:

"How rare... how very rare!"

He turned his head, staring at Liu Changdie with coldness and utter disgust. Outside, the clap of thunder grew louder as streaks of silvery, illusory light pierced into the cave dwelling. His indifferent voice echoed within:

"A useless, discarded pawn dares to interfere in my affairs."

An intensely brilliant Lesser Yang light flooded the area, as if to drown out all impurities. Liu Changdie stood in a daze, his gaze lowered. He knew in his heart it was too late, but he also understood that he now faced his own life-or-death crisis. Cold and bitter, he said in a low voice:

"I do not know which eminence you are—Lord Lu Xu once promised me..."

"Lu Xu?"

The great demon before him laughed coldly, as if he had just heard a joke:

"Only because you were sensible enough not to ruin my plans, and out of respect for Dongfang Lieyun, I will give you three breaths to make your choice. If you are still here after three breaths..."

He parted his lips slightly, revealing sharp, needle-like teeth as he said:

"It has been a long time since I have eaten a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator."

Liu Changdie slowly pulled his gaze away from Fuxun. Without much thought, he finally began to move his stiff limbs and backed out of the cave dwelling. The moment he took that step, the entire scene vanished from his eyes. He was plunged into absolute darkness, with only Fuxun's low groans still echoing from within the cave.

He was drenched in a cold sweat, standing stiffly on the ground. Glancing to the side, he saw a Demon King kneeling on either side of him. One was clad in white armor and built like a bull, the other had a cold expression and was looking up at him, his eyes filled with aggression.

The little demon who had brought him here was kneeling at his feet, looking up at him expectantly.

The Daoist Master felt an icy chill run through his limbs, his face alternating between hot and cold. He silently stepped into the Great Void and vanished. As the faint, silvery light of the Vault Metal disappeared, the residence once again fell into eternal darkness.

Only the little demon withdrew his gaze in disappointment, staring at the threshold of the cave dwelling. He clasped his hands and murmured in his heart:

'Maybe... maybe Lord Yuanbian has gone to find a good physician. Heavens protect us... whichever great Buddhist or profound spirit can offer protection, please save my king. This little demon is willing to offer lifelong worship!'

He closed his eyes piously and began to kowtow. After an unknown amount of time, he suddenly heard the groans slowly cease. He opened his eyes in pleasant surprise and listened intently.

But what echoed in the cave dwelling was the low sound of tearing flesh, followed by soft chewing, then the noise of great gulps and the sucking of marrow—sounds he, as a demon beast, was all too familiar with.

'Perhaps he brought something for the king to eat...'

After another half-moment, he heard the hollow sound of bones being tapped and a sigh of lingering satisfaction. Then came the clattering sound of something rolling. The thick, inescapable darkness finally receded like a tide, and the man with golden clothes and vertical pupils emerged, patting his stomach with a look of contentment.

The little demon shifted on his knees and said, trembling:

"Greetings, my lord, thank you, my lord—I wonder how my king is..."

The man wiped a trace of golden blood from his lips. His gaze was lazy, as if he had only just noticed this ant-like existence. The satisfaction of a full meal brought a smile to his face, and he was in a rare, good mood:

"He's not in pain anymore!"

The two demon generals on either side of him burst into roaring laughter. The little demon heard them laugh and laughed along, not realizing their laughter was like thunder, shaking the very Great Void. Soon, he could no longer laugh. Struck by the aftershock, he coughed up a mouthful of blood and rolled on the ground in agony, instantly losing consciousness and fainting dead away.

After an unknown amount of time, he finally awoke from the darkness. Countless bones in his body were broken, and both his eyes had burst into a bloody pulp. Yet, he let out a long breath and dragged his body into the cave dwelling, his face full of joy, and croaked:

"My king! Congratulations, my king!"

A deathly silence, like a pool of stagnant water.

He sensed something was wrong and hurriedly crawled deeper. He clambered over the steps, only to find a colossal, bone-white object before him, as large as a palace, emanating an auspicious aura of gold and white.

After crawling along the bone for a while, the little demon vaguely made out two pitch-black caves. The robe his master had spent years refining was like a scrap of cloth, cast aside like a worn-out shoe, draped over a broken tooth.

He stood frozen on the spot—no matter how stupid or unenlightened he was, he now understood the meaning of that thunderous laughter.

"My king!"

He shrieked, and a wave of intense despair made the demon beast leap up from the ground, his face streaked with tears. He fumbled for the cold bone and ran along the deep-white hill for some time before finally seeing a great abyss, and across from it, a lower jaw torn to pieces, as if chewed by some terrifying demon beast. The ground was littered with bone fragments.

"My king!"

The demon beast wailed even more fiercely and leaped into the gaping, dark abyss. He was as light as a wisp of green smoke, drifting on the wind, landing among the fine, sharp teeth:

"Splat."

His body made a soft sound, smashing into a puddle of flowing, rotten flesh without any resistance. The sound echoed in the cave dwelling for an instant before vanishing into nothingness.

Only then was a soft footstep heard. The silver-robed Daoist Master had returned. With his hands in his sleeves, he stood before the mountain of bones, his eyes fixed eerily on the puddle of rotten meat.

He stood rooted to the spot, a chill running through his entire body, feeling as if a lifetime had passed.

Since his rebirth, Liu Changdie had never really had any close friends. His cultivation had been like flowing water, passing in an instant. He saw the relationships of this life as fleeting as clouds. No matter how fine the spirit fruit, no matter how exquisite the immortal brew, it was gone in a flash. Yet it was the countless hardships and unbearable pain of his past life, the children who had brought him joy, the cup of bitter wine in the land of Eastern Yue, that he could not forget.

Fuxun was the sole exception. Although he knew Fuxun had approached him because of his unusual luck, he also understood how precious it was for a Purple Mansion Realm Demon King to treat him as an honored guest instead of eating him. But this Demon King, who was like both an elder and a friend, had been devoured completely in a matter of moments, his bones cracked open for their marrow, not a single drop of blood left behind.

To say he was innocent would be impossible; it was merely a matter of demon beasts devouring one another. Which great demon's belly did not contain a nation of demons? But Liu Changdie preferred to be biased. His friend had been skinned and deboned right under his nose, eaten clean.

A bloody grief and shame rose in his heart—when a group of powerful figures had ruined his Dao path, he was filled with hatred, but he could only laugh bitterly and would never take a risk. Yet this matter made him court death, daring to return!

But this grief made him realize his own powerlessness. He stood alone in the cave dwelling, muttering:

"It's not strange... not strange at all... Holding good fortune is not a constant safeguard against disaster; the course of luck has its appointed end..."

Liu Changdie knew Fuxun well, even the various powers of his divine abilities—the marvels of Auspicious Qi were formidable, but they had their limits. Faced with a behemoth like a member of the Dragon-kin, under such an absolute disparity in strength, perceiving the danger from Chiyi would have been a path to death. Being deceived was the only way to survive... With the divine abilities and skills of the Dragon-kin, it would not have been difficult to exploit this point to prevent the Auspicious Qi divine ability from reacting!

'A good swimmer drowns, a good rider falls. Minor calamities are avoided, but a great calamity cannot be passed. Thus, one is slain!'

He felt a deep, bone-marrow-level powerlessness. He stood numbly in the empty cave dwelling. After a long while, he raised a trembling hand. A divine ability bloomed, retrieving that tattered piece of clothing. With a gentle sweep, he collected the mountain-like pile of bones within it.
