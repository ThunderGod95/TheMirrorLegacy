# Chapter 1069: Precious Tusk

The lake's surface rippled. Li Ximing's gaze hardened slightly as he stared at the colorful clouds to the north. Figures, unevenly arrayed, stood upon those clouds. The purple flames that should have belonged to the Bright Yang path were tinged with pink, hanging from the cloud bank like a vast, cascading waterfall.

'Vast Cicada...'

Li Zhouwei's old armor had been left at Gardenia Scenery Mountain for reforging and repair, and he had entrusted Li Ximing with it. Li Ximing had gone to retrieve it, but unfortunately, with Li Zhouwei in seclusion, the armor refused to recognize him. Thankfully, a thorough search of the clan's vault had turned up the Demonbane Cleaver Mace and the Descending Radiance Equal Edge.

Both of these would be useful. Only the Radiant Sun King's Halberd and the Pure Yang Bracelets were items Li Zhouwei carried at all times, never letting them leave his person. They were nowhere to be found.

He stood with his hands tucked into his sleeves, appearing as steady as Mount Tai, waiting patiently. In truth, his sleeve trembled faintly. The little finger of his left hand detached at the knuckle and tumbled silently into the mouth of a small wooden carving.

Sealing the Life-Mandate!

In that exact instant, something swelled within the clouds above. Nested within the colorful layers, a temple as massive as a mountain materialized. The ancient bells of a monastery tolled. The halls were majestic and imposing, filled with seated monks in golden robes, each in a different posture. The scene was strangely reminiscent of the golden-armored, golden-robed figures from an Audience with the Celestial Gate. A golden plaque above the temple entrance displayed three large characters:

Precious Tusk Temple.

Before the temple, a lotus platform was in full, furious bloom. A young monk stood upon it. He had a smooth forehead, a sharp chin, and dark pupils. He wore simple, light-brown monastic robes, draped with a kashaya embroidered in gold. His long spear, however, stood beside him, radiating the roiling light of Radiant Fire.

His gaze was flat, fixed directly on Li Ximing.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing," he said. "To hear of you is not as good as seeing you in person."

When Changxiao had acted back then, he had merely toyed with him, chasing him all the way to the Eastern Sea like a cat with a mouse. That was more of a test; it didn't truly count. Excluding Changxiao, the Vast Cicada before him now was perhaps the most terrifying opponent Li Ximing had ever faced. He was of the Wei-Li bloodline, one who had cultivated the Buddhist path after the immortal path—an existence far superior to Helian Wujiang. This was a terrifying prospect, especially since Li Ximing had still possessed the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass during his battle with Helian Wujiang.

To say he wasn't nervous would be an absolute lie. Li Ximing immediately opened his hand. A patch of turquoise-yellow light pulsed in his palm, and a jade ruler leaped out—it was Sichuan.

The turquoise-yellow patterns of mountains and rivers undulated on its surface. As it fell into Vast Cicada's sight, the young monk pressed his palms together, seeming to recognize its extraordinary origin at a glance.

"A fine treasure," he murmured. "The Li Clan is truly worthy of being the Wei-Li inheritors... It seems this humble monk has not come to the wrong place."

He wasted no time. With the simple gesture of pressing his hands together, the lingering sound of a bell echoed from the sky. The temple in the clouds expanded instantly. The ground, formed of colorful mist, swelled and spread rapidly. Li Ximing suddenly found himself on a boundless platform before the temple. The scenery of the lake below vanished, and the only thing reflected in his pupils was a searing, crimson light descending from the heavens.

'So fast!'

Along with it, a slightly youthful, boyish voice echoed, seeming to linger by his ear.

"My apologies!"

That remark seemed to be directed at Sima Yuanli, who was off to the side. Li Ximing had no time to worry about that. He formed a hand seal at his chest, and his eyes suddenly blazed with light. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light erupted, surging up to resist the crimson light. His other hand vanished into his sleeve, conjuring flames.

Li Ximing had cultivated Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light for many years. While it couldn't compare to the myriad divine blessings Li Zhouwei possessed, he had at least achieved Entering the Hall. Yet, under the opponent's crimson light, his technique melted away like ice under a hot sun, disintegrating layer by layer. It barely managed to slow the crimson light's descent.

Li Ximing sensed grave danger. He realized the man on the Golden Lotus Seat had already risen, spear in hand, and vanished! His resolve was instant. He immediately activated his spiritual sense!

"BOOM!"

Dark thunderclouds suddenly appeared within the dense, colorful mist. The Demonbane Cleaver Mace materialized, and a waterfall of silver lightning crashed down, suppressing the crimson light with lightning speed.

Li Ximing immediately threw back his cuff, revealing an item. It was a deep, azure-green color, and it grew in the air as it flew, positioning itself in front of him. It was the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron!

The roiling Radiant Fire coiling around the spear was dazzling, but the cauldron's gaping maw sucked it all in. The golden spear tip flicked out, striking the cauldron's body perfectly.

"CLANG!"

A deafening chime echoed. The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron was flung high into the air, its mystical connection nearly severed. Li Ximing's face flushed slightly, and a clear assessment formed in his mind:

'What a terrifying spear...'

This Vast Cicada was nothing like Helian Wujiang, who had focused purely on Daoist arts. This monk's divine abilities, dharma power, and spear techniques were one. The interweaving radiance and Radiant Fire were an extreme threat!

But the monk merely glanced at him. In the instant the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron was knocked off-balance, he activated a profound art. He spat out a golden light, sharp as a blade, that temporarily locked the profound cauldron in place. With a thrust of his spear, he had already broken through the opening.

Li Ximing was not one to sit and wait for death. In that fraction of a second, the intangible Light of the Six Harmonies was already dancing on his fingertips. The light flickered and leaped, landing on the spear tip as he commanded:

"Emperor, suppress the wicked; Emperor, command the chariot's turn."

This invocation utilized his Life Divine Ability. The eight words emerged as a single sound, propelled by the divine ability to shake the Great Void. This was precisely the disaster-averting, difficulty-resolving power of the Light of the Six Harmonies!

In an instant, the violet-pink Radiant Fire on the spear balled up, transforming into a round-bellied, adorable bird. It zipped about playfully. The brilliant golden radiance flaked off, scattering into lotus flowers and glazed glass that tumbled from the sky. Even the spear's sharp tip blurred.

'It's the World's Radiance!'

Vast Cicada had not expected him to have mastered a Life Divine Ability so easily. Caught unprepared, he miscalculated. His expression shifted slightly. The hand he had held behind his back finally emerged, patting the air in front of him as if brushing something away.

But at the same moment, his advancing spear was struck by *something* heavy, knocking it an inch off course. Li Ximing flicked his sleeve, evaded the blow with ease, and, instead of retreating, advanced. His lips parted, and he spat a stream of fire!

Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire!

A torrent of Merging Fire, so bright white it seared the eyes, erupted. A faint, gray, intangible companion flame rippled outward like water, mixed with two other flames—one golden-red, one crimson. The combination radiated waves of terrifying power.

Li Ximing had borrowed the power of the Valley Wind Guide-Fire for this attack, and the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire itself had a dreadful reputation. Even Vast Cicada felt his heart pound in terror. A layer of fine, white scales bristled across his face, and he immediately opened his mouth.

Between those jade-white teeth, there was no tongue. Connecting his mouth to his throat was a long, thin, old cicada. It was entirely pale white. Its two scaled wings were pale white at the base, with pure white veins. Its pair of bright red compound eyes stared greedily at the outside world, only to realize a gush of Merging Fire was flooding in. It flapped its wings in alarm.

The movement of its wings blew out a gust of faint red, hazy wind. The red-eyed white cicada detached from his oral cavity and fluttered away, leaving his body standing frozen in place. Above his shining, bald head, a colorful cloud suddenly parted, showering him in golden light.

"BOOM!"

The body took the full brunt of the flames. Bathed in the hazy golden light, it didn't retreat a single step. Its iron-hard skin and muscles melted away, revealing a pale-golden skeleton beneath. Li Ximing sensed something was wrong and shifted his gaze, his eyes sharp with vigilance.

The distant red-eyed cicada trembled. The body dissolved like water, leaving the clinging flames with nothing to burn, rising as futile black smoke. In the distance, the red-eyed cicada transformed back into Vast Cicada. The fierce-looking young man wiped his face, his smooth white skin reappearing. His expression was one of genuine admiration.

'Worthy of the Wei descendant!'

The opponent's escape technique was truly profound, completely neutralizing the fire that had not yet burned to his bones. But how could Li Ximing idly watch during this rapid exchange? Seizing the moment of his opponent's miscalculation, he pressed his hands together at his chest. The Audience with the Celestial Gate, one no smaller than the temple in the sky, descended, pressing down firmly on the young monk's head!

Vast Cicada, however, showed no fear. He laughed loudly and shook his head.

"Daoist Friend Li, this venerable one also cultivated Bright Yang in a past life! Beneath the Audience with the Celestial Gate, the Valley Water and Dui-metal are easy to evade, but the True Purple is hard to escape!"

His confidence was not baseless! Before converting to the Buddhist path, Vast Cicada was known as Li Jieyi. He had been an immortal cultivator at the Purple Mansion Realm Mid-stage with three Bright Yang divine abilities. He had cultivated to the absolute peak of that path, only turning to the Buddhist path after hitting the immortal bottleneck!

The monk raised his palm. His left hand pressed under his right, forming a lotus mudra. His divine abilities converged as he decreed:

'Borrowed Valley Water Grandeur Art!'

In an instant, the light of Valley Water and a brilliant radiance flashed. The cumbersome Audience with the Celestial Gate had already closed, but shining beneath it was the lotus platform that Vast Cicada had seemingly left uselessly nearby!

Vast Cicada did not originally cultivate Valley Water, but this art was of a high grade, and he was extremely familiar with this particular divine ability. The lotus was an Enlightened Artifact, painstakingly refined with numerous spiritual items of the Valley Water element using Buddhist techniques. It allowed him to walk out unharmed!

The situation reversed in a heartbeat. Li Ximing was already at a disadvantage, and his divine ability had missed. The young monk's eyes had already turned golden as he sensed his Buddhist Land. The temple's main doors swung open. Li Ximing was no longer standing *before* the temple; he had Entered the Hall—he was *inside* it.

From all four sides, five massive golden-bodied figures appeared. They all had the visages of demons and evil spirits—dark, sinister, and hateful. They brandished spears, halberds, staves, pikes, and lances, and as one, they lunged to attack.

And Vast Cicada sat serenely on a high platform, palms together, chanting sutras.

Li Ximing had no choice but to raise his jade ruler, blocking the incoming halberd. A cloud of dust exploded. He was still in disbelief—his Life Divine Ability investigation revealed that this place *was* real, not some illusion! His Demonbane Cleaver Mace was hovering in the dark clouds *outside* this temple, its lightning bolts striking relentlessly at a profound drum the monk had manifested earlier.

This was his first battle against such a bizarre Buddhist practitioner. A chill ran through him.

'Vast Cicada's reputation is well-earned... If I get trapped too deep in here, escape will be difficult!'

Therefore, as the five weapons struck simultaneously, he braced himself, his face paling. He spat out another mouthful of fire, twisting his head to send it surging in all directions like a wave.

These five golden bodies were not particularly strong, and the power of the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire was terrifying. The bright white flame clung to them like a maggot feeding on a corpse, burning the golden bodies, the temple beams, and the jade seats. It spread like countless crawling demons, growing ever more ferocious.

'A pity it's Merging Fire! If it were anything else, I'd have a ninety percent certainty of trapping him right now!'

Merging Fire damaged one's nature and life-mandate. No matter where it was, it carried a sickening, malignant quality that gave one a headache. No matter how perfect Vast Cicada's temple was, it couldn't escape this fact. He absolutely could not let the fire run rampant. He paused his chanting, shook his sleeve, and a small, exquisite pagoda dropped out.

The item grew in the wind. The sixteen runes on its lowest level flashed in unison. Li Ximing, having gained a moment's breath, activated the Light of the Six Harmonies to avert the disaster. Seeing the opponent's aggressive move to suppress him, he decreed:

"The Four Seas lose hope; peacefully bear this weight."

The Light of the Six Harmonies shifted from intangible to tangible, blowing forward and transforming into a heavy, foggy golden gauze that layered itself onto the pagoda. But the monk above just smiled.

"My Xiangru Pagoda is mighty and firm. Today, it treads the profound peril, the perfect time to bear a heavy load."

A platinum-white light shone from the descending pagoda. The rolling golden mist, far from slowing it, actually made the pagoda *faster*. Li Ximing was both shocked and horrified. How could he not recognize the divine art at play? He cursed inwardly:

'It's the Bright Yang Light of the Perilous Tread!'

The pagoda plummeted. Li Ximing finally understood the desperate plight the other Daoist Masters faced when confronting Li Zhouwei. In that split second, he had no time to worry about hidden cards. He could only grit his teeth and resist, raising his own Audience with the Celestial Gate.

Platinum-golden heavenly light shone down. The brilliant Celestial Gate rose from the ground. But the five golden bodies reached out in unison, each grasping a chain, and pulled the pagoda taut, preventing the Celestial Gate from expanding further.

For a moment, the radiance of clashing Bright Yang arts flashed continuously. Dense purple fire washed over everything. The pagoda's light flickered. Vast Cicada pressed his palms together and praised:

"The pagoda contains infinite flowing light, capable of slaying lives. But Daoist Friend Zhaojing has good fortune. A place has been specially reserved for you here. To enter my Precious Tusk Temple means you are a great personage."

Though his words sounded like an invitation, his expression held little hope. The speed of his hand seals accelerated, and his eyelid twitched.

Beneath the pagoda, countless streams of bright white light were already seeping out. The Daoist Master inside was also exuding a hazy white glow through the golden pagoda walls. This was causing Vast Cicada's dharma power to drain at an alarming rate. A decisive look entered his eyes.

'I cannot drag this out... Li Ximing himself isn't the problem, but that Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire is more disgusting than anything. If it burns for too long, it will definitely destroy my pagoda!'

Having fought to this point, Vast Cicada felt he had the situation in hand. His only fear was the fire. The light in his eyes grew brighter.

"Receive this heretic into my triple-chambered room!"

As he spoke, the very bricks underfoot began to move. The massive screen behind Vast Cicada split to the sides, revealing a deeper inner chamber. There was no colossal Dharma Body or ornate carvings, only a simple golden statue.

The flames under the pagoda seemed agitated, burning even more fiercely. Vast Cicada suddenly looked up, hearing a long, drawn-out chant.

"Moo..."

The shifting ground shuddered to a halt. The golden pagoda boomed. The five golden bodies began to stagger. Doubt flashed across Vast Cicada's face, followed by shock.

'Proclaimation Earth? A Daoist Master of the Proclaimation Earth Dao? What?'

In the instant he lost his focus, the five chains shattered and clattered to the floor. A brownish-red radiance forcibly lifted the pagoda, revealing the Daoist Master beneath.

Li Ximing's body was covered in eye-sized holes. His own eyes had melted into pools of crimson fluid. Blinding radiance streamed through the cavities, a terrifying sight. He seemed oblivious to his state, sitting cross-legged within the pagoda, his hands cupped as if holding a lotus.

A golden, illusory radiance, thumb-sized and covered in dense, swirling runes, danced in his palms. It was brilliant, ascendant, and surrounded by three points of crimson light, like attendant stars.

Great Parting's Golden Radiance.

Vast Cicada was truly a high-level cultivator who had switched from immortal to Buddhist. He calmed himself in an instant, pressed his palms together again, and focused his power on the pagoda's tip. The illusory light he had been preparing to execute Li Ximing descended ahead of schedule!

But Li Ximing looked up even faster. A bright, colorful light emerged from his empty eye sockets. His lips parted, and with the aid of the Light of the Six Harmonies, he compressed his entire incantation into a single sound:

"Disaster overwhelms the heavens; I shall execute your evil!"

The heavenly light at his brow instantly turned dark. Hundreds, thousands of black-tailed golden streaks of light poured out, drowning the scenery above—Emperor Qi's Light!

Using the Long Yue Variable Gold he had obtained from Guo Nanwu, he had mastered this art!

"BOOM!"

The dark light, guided by the pull of the Life Divine Ability, completely submerged the descending white light. It only held for an instant, but that was all the time he needed!

"DONG!"

The rune-like Great Parting's Golden Radiance erupted into a torrent of pure gold. The Great Void boomed. The roiling Li-Light tore through the temple like a hurricane, ripped through the colorful clouds, and dyed the entire sky crimson!

The entire Precious Tusk Temple, like a tattered scroll painting, was torn in half by this radiance, scattering into motes of crystalline light. The lake, reflecting the red sky, reappeared below.

'Precious Tusk Temple is broken!'

Li Ximing knew this was far from over. He spat out a mouthful of blood and turned. His empty eyes locked onto Sima Yuanli, who was manipulating Valley Water on the lake below. A heavy roar echoed across the sky:

"Sima Yuanli! The Spiritual Treasure!"

His blood-choked shout echoed. Sima Yuanli, startled, seemed not to have expected Vast Cicada to be this powerful. He hurriedly untied a pale white, golden-glowing scroll from his waist and, while fending off the attackers around him, threw the Spiritual Treasure over.

'It doesn't matter if I fail King Wei... he's not one to hold a grudge. But if I get Li Ximing killed... King Wei will definitely make me pay with my life!'
