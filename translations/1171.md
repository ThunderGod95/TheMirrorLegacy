# Chapter 1170: Grand Mound

"The Vast Desert Li Flame…"

When it came to the Dao of spiritual flames, Li Ximing was a true master. The moment the Vast Desert Li Flame appeared, he sensed its unique and marvelous properties.

'It actually has a hint of smoke and sand… how rare!'

A spiritual flame from the Purple Mansion Realm was a treasure anywhere. His eyes burned with desire, and he wished he could refine it on the spot with his Talisman Qi to test its power. For now, he suppressed the urge, drawing out only a single wisp of its fiery aura to inspect.

Li Jiangqian also examined it for a moment and found his impression of it quite favorable. However, noticing that their host didn't mention its might, he smiled.

"Since it has been blended with other Daos, I imagine its power, as a flame of orthodox nature, must be a notch weaker."

Ji'an immediately extended two fingers and lightly tapped the incense burner. A peculiar, jade-like, brownish-yellow flame leaped out, erupting into a conflagration that swept across the heavens. Above the sky of the Jade Terrace, it manifested a vast desert.

Within this desert, fierce flames blazed. Li-Light formed its sands, casting a pale, ochre hue. Baleful Fire Qi became its mist, glowing with the light of brown jade. As he poured more of his dharma power and divine abilities into it, the desert expanded relentlessly, casting an immense shadow upon the ground below.

For a moment, the world shook. The white-robed disciples of the Chunyi Dao Gate raised their heads one after another, staring in terror and awe at the Radiant Fire desert in the sky, which pulsed with an overwhelming aura of destruction.

Che Hong shook his head, moving with a hint of resignation to calm his disciples. Ji'an, however, chuckled.

"To say it's weaker isn't quite right. I obtained this flame when I was first making my name. For a time, I relied on it to leave the Feather-Shedding Land and travel the world. I've nurtured it for many years. If not for that great flood in Cang Province that shattered its spiritual concept and turned my meticulous nurturing methods into a hindrance, this flame's quality would be exceptional."

He paused briefly, and then, fearing the two might read too much into his words, quickly offered a guarantee.

"Even so, its foundation is solid. Among Radiant Fires, its power is middle-tier, but its true strength lies in its vastness, like a desert. With this marvelous aspect amplifying it, it can hold its own in the upper-middle tier against any foe."

Li Ximing had been watching intently and now had a good measure of it.

'It's probably comparable to the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame.'

He had acquired the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame many years ago. In terms of raw power, it was actually a fraction weaker than this Vast Desert Li Flame. After all, the strength of the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame lay in its innate spirituality, which could neither be increased nor diminished.

"Excellent!"

The Radiant Fire in the sky poured back down, condensing in Ji'an's hand and returning to a finger-sized, jade-like flame. A flicker of excitement finally crossed Li Jiangqian's face. He stood, accepted it gently, and smiled.

"My thanks, Senior! The Spiritual Qi from the Great Scripture of Radiance is the Bright Radiance's Blazing Essence. I will have it sent to the Chunyi Dao Gate as soon as I return to the lake!"

Ji'an laughed heartily.

"It's no trouble," he said politely. "A day or two makes no difference."

With this great matter concluded, both host and guests were pleased. As Ji'an's pill was not yet complete, he was inclined to foster goodwill and remained by their side. Li Ximing, however, was already preparing to leave. His true purpose revealed at last, he adopted a thoughtful expression, looked toward Che Hong, and sighed.

"The Clear Yin Womb Herb is exceedingly rare, and many other Supreme Yin spiritual items depend on fortune. I may have some leads, but I fear my ignorance will lead to me being deceived. Perhaps… I could consult the illustrated records and secret archives of your Daoist tradition."

He didn't give Che Hong a chance to refuse, adding immediately,

"I am willing to offer other scriptures in exchange!"

With the need for spiritual resources so pressing at the moment, Li Ximing had become more frugal. He drew a jade slip from his sleeve, one that recorded the outlines of several of his clan's cultivation arts, and pressed it into Che Hong's hand.

The Li Clan's current Daoist repository was both profound and extensive. The Daoist Master had intended to refuse, but a quick glance at the slip brought a look of shock to his eyes. The words caught in his throat.

"If I don't accept this," he said awkwardly, "I'm afraid you won't be at ease, fellow Daoist."

"It is always better to have reciprocity," Li Ximing said, giving him an easy way out.

Che Hong feigned a conflicted expression.

"An elder of my family once had a fortuitous encounter and obtained a fine treasure. The technique, the Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise, would be of great use to our Dao…"

The Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise was a method for nurturing spiritual artifacts that Li Zhouwei had obtained from a grotto-heaven. But the Li Clan simply lacked the resources and capacity to refine such a treasured vase, and so the art had gone unused. Li Ximing hadn't even considered that Che Hong would be interested in it.

"I will transcribe a copy for you at once!" he said magnanimously.

The treatise seemed to be of immense value in Che Hong's eyes. He thanked him profusely, a hint of indebtedness in his expression, but then he gave another awkward smile.

"Actually… my family has also been searching for the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture for many years. We always assumed it was in the hands of the Golden Feather Sect and never thought to ask…"

"Oh?" Li Ximing paused, then realization dawned.

"Of course… your clan's expertise in the Daos of the Mansion Water and Pit Water is also quite profound."

Che Hong's hesitation grew more apparent. He glanced at Ji'an and smiled.

"I will see the two Daoist Masters out."

His meaning was clear to all three of them; he had something private to say. Although Ji'an was curious, the sheer joy of securing his path forward made him disinclined to meddle. He smiled, cupped his hands in farewell, and departed in a flash of flame.

Once the old man was gone, Che Hong stopped walking. He looked up, his expression grave.

"Daoist Master, what do you know of the Chen Clan of Lingyu? Has that scripture already reached Daoist Master Xiao?"

'Xiao Chuting…'

When Li Ximing had gone to Cang Province to offer his congratulations all those years ago, the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture had been hidden within the gift box of spiritual items. It had, of course, been given to Daoist Master Xiao long ago. His expression hardened.

"I'm not familiar with them…"

Seeing that he only gave half an answer, Che Hong understood that Li Ximing was still on guard. He didn't find it strange and simply gave a wry smile.

"This is not something I should be discussing, but a few days ago… I heard a piece of news. A certain Daoist Master Su successfully forged his divine ability, broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, and was granted an audience with the Emperor of Shu. This will not be a secret for much longer, which is why I dared to ask you for the scripture."

'Daoist Master Su? Su Yan!'

Li Ximing's heart jolted.

He was no stranger to that name. It was through the Golden Feather Sect's mediation back then that the Li Clan had handed over the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture to complete that man's Dao lineage. In return, they had earned a favor—a favor that resulted in the Golden Feather Sect, despite pressure from the Shu Court, bypassing Ting Province. That was the only reason Moongaze Lake had been spared from greater losses, and why Li Ximing himself had escaped with only minor injuries.

Daoist Master Tianhuo's words, 'The favor from back then is repaid to fellow Daoist Zhaojing today,' referred to exactly this!

'That junior has reached the Purple Mansion Realm… Considering the time, and with the full backing of a Golden Core Dao lineage and an ancient inheritance, it's not surprising…'

Li Ximing looked up thoughtfully. Che Hong, observing his expression, said hesitantly,

"The Chen Clan's origins can be traced back to the ancient True Monarch of Encompassing Profoundity, to the bloodline of the ancient Grand Mound Kingdom. The Great River and Grand Mound Scripture was the foundational art of the Chen Clan back then. They even established a mystic realm with it, located in the former Grand Mound Kingdom, in what is now Badger Prefecture, north of Luoxia."

"For generations, the descendants of the Chen Clan have been trying to return to their ancestral land. Chen Xuanli once reached the realm of Great Daoist Master and intended to go to Badger Prefecture to reopen the mystic realm, but due to obstruction from many sides, he failed…"

Li Ximing's expression shifted slightly.

"Obstruction from many sides?"

Che Hong spoke evasively.

"The complexities are not for a junior cultivator like me to speak of. In short, the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture is tied to this fortuitous opportunity. This opportunity originally belonged to the Chen Clan, but the Su Clan intermarried with them for many years in ancient times and thus also has a claim…"

Li Jiangqian was lost in thought, but Che Hong's expression grew complicated.

"During the Ning State era, the great clans frequently intermarried. My Xi Clan originated from Gaoping Prefecture, but over the years, we also became entangled by blood with the Chen Clan. By rights, we also have a claim. Our Daoist tradition even possesses three volumes on 'Pit Water,' which Daoist Master Xiao himself once came to trade for."

"But after Chen Xuanli, a Great Daoist Master, was forced to his death, our Xi Clan ancestors sensed something was amiss. Fearing we would be seen as having ambitions, we didn't even dare to cultivate the 'Pit Water' arts! Only now, seeing that Daoist Master Su has reached the Purple Mansion Realm, have we dared to entertain the thought of completing a viable path for a future Great Daoist Master of our own!"

Li Ximing finally understood. He frowned.

"Then what does any of this… have to do with Daoist Master Xiao?"

Che Hong gave a bitter laugh.

"The Chen Clan of Lingyu had two great loyal vassal clans. The first was named Xiao, the second Quan. Initially, they did not intermarry. But as the Chen Clan declined, they were forced to rely on outsiders, and internal marriages began. The mother of that Xiao Clan's Xiao Jinzhou was from the direct line of the Chen Clan!"

A shiver went down Li Ximing's spine.

"Does Senior Xiao also have a claim to this opportunity?" he asked.

Che Hong lowered his voice and used a secret art to transmit his words.

'He should have… but now he doesn't… He played the Golden Feather Sect and the Azure Pond against each other perfectly. His methods are so brilliant that even the Daoist Masters of the Golden Feather Sect can't scheme against him. He's on the verge of becoming a Great Daoist Master himself. Who would be able to take anything from his hands?'

'If that weren't the case, why would they need Su Yan? The Golden Feather Sect is deliberately holding him back. If he obtains this scripture, he'll just end up as a second Chen Xuanli! My clan's Great Daoist Master once estimated that Daoist Master Xiao is also waiting—waiting for someone to open that place for him…'

Li Ximing had never imagined such a complex web of connections. He was stunned.

'Doesn't that mean… he'll be going up against the Golden Feather Sect?!'

Unlike the blatant power of Luoxia and the Underworld, the terror of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition was a silent, pervasive thing that all feared. Forget a Great Daoist Master who was practically a rogue cultivator… even a descendant of a Golden Core clan would feel a tremor of fear before the Zhang family!

'I knew his path of seeking the Dao would be difficult, but I never imagined it would be _this_ difficult!'

Though his heart was reeling, he only said,

"Since that is the case, I will certainly help Chunyi. If you require any spiritual resources for alchemy later, I will have to trouble you, Daoist Master."

Che Hong naturally nodded in agreement and had the disciples waiting below see them out. As Li Ximing stepped into the Great Void, his heart was still in turmoil.

'So it's true… it wasn't just about letting Su Yan seize all the opportunities in Wanling Heaven… No wonder the Golden Feather Sect was so persistent for centuries. No wonder that favor was so great!'

'During the Ning State era, the great clans intermarried. Was the Xi Clan the only one? Could the Ning-Li Clan have shared blood ties as well? If my ancestors hadn't been killed, if they had truly reached the Purple Mansion Realm and opened the Daoist repository, they might have been absorbed by the Golden Feather Sect…'

'And Daoist Master Xiao… was he really only after the way of the sword immortals back then? …Perhaps he had the foresight to see all this…'

His thoughts were a tangled mess. After a long period of contemplation, they finally returned to Moongaze Lake and landed within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Li Jiangqian, meanwhile, was holding the flame, his mind wandering. Even though he cultivated the Great Scripture of Radiance, he lacked Li Ximing's ability to refine it in an instant. Golden patterns were slowly crawling over the flame, bit by bit subduing it.

'The Daoist Tradition of Encompassing Profoundity…'

Lost in their own thoughts, the two soon arrived and took their seats. Li Jiangqian glanced around but didn't see Li Zhouwei. Figuring he was likely in the pavilion below where the Supreme Yin Qi was denser, he asked, "Are Father's injuries still serious?"

Li Ximing shook his head.

"They're not a problem for now, but it would be best to eradicate them completely."

Reassured by his words, Li Jiangqian placed both the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear and the Radiant Si Apricot Fruit on the jade table.

"I leave them to your discretion, Grand-Uncle," he said respectfully.

"My, how polite you've become." Li Ximing casually pushed them back toward him. His expression turned serious.

"The Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear is straightforward, but what are your plans for the Radiant Si Apricot Fruit?"

Li Jiangqian explained, "My Great Scripture of Radiance has a 'Heart Mansion' that is exceptionally good at containing spiritual plants and items. Unlike others who would waste its essence by consuming it directly, my method is no worse than refining it into an pill…"

At this, Li Ximing smiled and shook his head.

"Alchemy is not a simple matter of harvesting essence. With the right one or two complementary spiritual resources, you can bring out twelve-tenths of its benefits! It should still be refined into an pill."

But Li Jiangqian's tone shifted as he reminded him, "Grand-Uncle, my Greedy Snare of Profound Li is an art that devours the life-mandate. Its nature is to kill and destroy the Dao. I must consume the spiritual fruit directly to achieve the greatest effect. If it is refined into an pill… it will only have the effects of an pill."

"I see!" Li Ximing replied, a thoughtful look on his face. "So you will consume it directly now?"

"Indeed!"

Li Jiangqian lifted the lid of the jade box, revealing the perfectly round, lustrous apricot that looked like a supreme treasure. His throat moved as he swallowed, and he said softly,

"Refining a great pill requires no small amount of time and effort. It will take Ji'an years to complete his. If he were to refine one for me as well, who knows how many more years it would take. Once I've finished refining the Vast Desert Li Flame, I will enter seclusion to consume the Radiant Si Apricot Fruit. There is no need to trouble the elders."

Li Ximing nodded in agreement. Li Jiangqian then searched his robes and took out a box from his sleeve.

"Back then, the elders took my spiritual phenomenon and tasked me with refining resources from it, telling me to keep them for myself," he said seriously.

"Now, with expenses rising everywhere for the elders, I will no longer keep this to myself!"

Inside the box was a shimmering, golden Li-water, burning with a transparent flame. Though there was only a thin layer and the quantity was small, its quality was not low. It even gave off the faint scent of a spiritual extract.

Li Ximing did not stand on ceremony and accepted it silently. Seeing Li Jiangqian sit cross-legged in the pavilion, he rose to his feet. Suppressing the injury in his lungs, he coughed twice.

In truth, Li Ximing had also been grievously injured in the great battle. His condition had only improved after his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body took a portion of the damage. Having dragged it out for this long, he was inevitably feeling some discomfort.

But he didn't rush to heal himself. With a shake of his sleeve, he produced a small statue. The object grew with the wind, its skin becoming smooth and warm, its expression thoughtful, as if it were a living person. The nameplate at its waist, inscribed with 'Li Gufeng,' swayed gently, emitting a faint glow.

Li Ximing studied it for a moment, then made a quick calculation with his fingers. A smile of eager anticipation spread across his face. He brought two fingers together, drew out the Light of the Six Harmonies from his divine ability, and tapped the spot between the brow of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body. After placing several jade slips in its lap, he finally sat down cross-legged to heal his injuries.

As he gradually entered a state of meditation, the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, in a rather unsettling manner, slowly opened its eyes. Its gaze was blank, yet it already possessed a spark of spiritual life. It stiffly raised its hands and, incredibly, began to read and ponder!

It was being controlled by a sliver of Li Ximing's consciousness.

The Surrogate Body Ascension Art had elevated the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body to a state where it could avert disaster and ward off calamities. Combined with the World's Radiance, it was already formidable. The recent enhancement from Sealing the Life-Mandate had finally caused a quantitative change to become a qualitative one, pushing it over a critical threshold.

'Although controlling it while my main body is active makes it a bit sluggish, and it's far from the seamless, effortless nature of Tinglan's Path-Crossing Warrant, which could fool even a Purple Mansion cultivator, it still represents a monumental leap!'

Seeing Tinglan's warrant and her ambulatory body all those years ago had filled him with envy. Now, after so long, he had finally realized a part of that dream. While his main body remained motionless, healing, his spirit-split pulled its lips into a stiff smile and began to study the alchemy texts.
