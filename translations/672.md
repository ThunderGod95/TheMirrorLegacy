# Chapter 672: The Dragon and the Fox

The two demons and one human emerged from the Grave Abyss and descended into the sea. They passed over a scattering of shattered, desolate islands, all of them utterly devoid of life.

Even the Western Mountains at Moongaze Lake, for all their lack of spiritual energy, at least supported the growth of mortal plants. This place, however, was nothing but barren sand and rock, without even common vegetation.

But Li Zhouwei saw more than just the surface. 'This place may be barren,' he thought, 'but it's also free from the influence of the Great Void. An excellent place to evade the prying senses of a Purple Mansion cultivator. A pity it's useless for cultivation.'

The long-bearded demon waited off to the side. Dongfang Dingjiao, in no mood for conversation, simply piloted his spiritual artifact past him. The Azurewater Scaled-Beasts lay quiescent on the seabed, resembling a living mountain range of glittering scales. As Dingjiao's party approached, a black-armored demon who had been waiting for them scurried over to greet them.

"My lords!"

It was clear Dongfang Dingjiao had no interest in speaking with him, and the demon, sensing his master’s foul mood, became as meek as a lamb. With a wave of his hand, Dingjiao dismissed him, and the demon hurried off to ready the beasts.

Dingjiao landed before the main hall, flicked his sleeves, and let out a long breath. A smile finally graced his features.

"Please," he said softly.

The trio entered the hall to find someone already standing inside. His sleeves were perfectly neat, and a refined smile touched his lips. Seeing them enter, he bowed.

"Greetings, Your Highness! Greetings, fellow Daoists!"

"Uncle Heyun!" Dingjiao quickly stepped back and offered a respectful bow. The Dragon Prince was all smiles as he said graciously, "Uncle, you are an endlessly busy man. It is a rare honor to have you visit my humble palace!"

Dongfang Heyun returned the bow politely. "I heard Your Highness was visiting this dangerous place, so I came ahead to wait," he said in a gentle voice. "I was following along just now, but I did not wish to disturb your experience, so I remained hidden."

He stayed half a step behind Dongfang Dingjiao, escorting him to the host's seat. Only after the prince and his honored guests were seated did he take a seat to the side. He adjusted his sleeves with a scholarly air.

"After all," he continued softly, "Li Xunquan is a demon who has lived for a millennium. Even bound by the Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope, his mind is not clear, and he might still lash out. This abyss holds many dangers. While Your Highness's draconic might is vast, my concern was for your safety and that of your guests."

"Many thanks, Uncle!" Dongfang Dingjiao beamed at his words.

Bai Rong, meanwhile, was observing Dongfang Heyun with quiet astonishment. 'So this is Dongfang Heyun? Aside from his lack of divine abilities, he seems no different from a Purple Mansion cultivator. No wonder Tuoba Chongyuan's soul was scattered by him. This cloud-dragon could probably hold his own against a Purple Mansion master.'

After a moment, a new suspicion arose in his mind. 'Is he truly not at the Purple Mansion Realm? There is only one cloud-dragon in the entire world—who could possibly gauge his true strength? Perhaps he has already reached that realm, and the Dragon Monarch has simply concealed his divine abilities!'

Dingjiao paused for a moment before asking, "Uncle, I am unfamiliar with the Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope. Could you tell me of it?"

"Oh?" Dongfang Heyun began softly, "The Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope is an artifact belonging to Yao Chenlin. You young ones wouldn't know of it. Its purpose is to erode the will through the world's most extreme pain."

"Pain is no small matter; it is the greatest enemy of the mind. Under prolonged torment, one cannot stop the tears from flowing. Grudges, love, the desire for the Dao… all are forgotten. Only the overwhelming pain remains, and the sole desperate wish is for a single moment of rest."

"That is the function of the Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope." His tone was calm, tinged with an elegance that made his words all the more chilling. "This artifact delights in hearing pleas for mercy. The more one struggles, the tighter it binds, inflicting limitless, bone-cracking agony. Only by howling for mercy can one find a moment's relief. The moment the cries cease, the pain returns a hundredfold. It is a simple method for breaking the will."

"After a thousand years of this," he concluded, "the only thought left in one's mind is that begging brings rest. For Li Xunquan to be able to respond at all speaks to the incredible strength of his will."

"What a vicious treasure..."

As Dongfang Heyun spoke, Dongfang Dingjiao’s brow remained tightly furrowed. His branch of the family had always been the closest to the Wei-Li, and he fell into a deep silence.

Having finished his explanation, Dongfang Heyun took a sip of wine and glanced at Li Zhouwei. "This must be the White Qilin," he smiled.

"Minghuang greets senior," Li Zhouwei replied.

Dongfang Heyun simply nodded, saying nothing more to him. He then turned to the fox. "Please send my regards to your master."

After a few more pleasantries, he excused himself. He bowed before the hall and vanished, but not before giving Li Zhouwei one last, meaningful glance.

With his departure, Dingjiao’s mood improved considerably. He raised his cup to his two guests, then looked in the direction Dongfang Heyun had disappeared, a flicker of delight in his eyes.

The Dragon Princes of the Eastern Sea had always been a privileged few who rarely gave Foundation Establishment cultivators a second thought. But he, Dongfang Dingjiao, had always been more moderate. He treated cultivators like them, and even Dongfang Heyun, with courtesy and respect.

'My other brothers... they treat Uncle Heyun as a mere subordinate, with a mind to command him for every trivial matter. They must be in a difficult position now!'

Naturally, Dongfang Heyun’s attitude toward him was favorable. Had it been any of his other brothers, Heyun might have offered protection, but he certainly wouldn't have appeared personally to share a cup of wine.

'Dongfang Heyun is but one,' he thought, gazing into the distance. 'In the future, there will be Minghuang and Bai Rong...'

He finally turned back to Li Zhouwei, his expression full of pleasure. "Since Minghuang is unwilling to accept an ancient spiritual artifact, I cannot let my friends leave empty-handed! That would be a failure on my part as a host!"

Dongfang Dingjiao clapped his hands lightly. Two demons entered from outside the hall, each carrying a stone box. They walked forward and presented them respectfully.

"My friends," Dingjiao said earnestly, "these, you cannot refuse. Consider it a small token of my hospitality!"

As the stone box was brought before him, Li Zhouwei was already prepared. 'This is what Bai Rong meant when he said Dingjiao wanted to befriend us...'

Dingjiao might not have known the identity of the person in the abyss, but as the one who extended the invitation, he almost certainly knew the prisoner was a victim of Mount Luoxia. He also knew this person was connected to both the dragon lineage and the Wei-Li.

'Why else would he insist I come? How else could this act serve to build an alliance?'

The greater calculus, he surmised, was part of the game between the dragon lineage and Mount Luoxia. By revealing all this so nakedly, Dingjiao was sending a clear message: Mount Luoxia harbored ill intentions.

'Dongfang Heyun even made a special appearance to tell me just how torturous the Fuxi Qilin-Binding Rope is. If Mount Luoxia treats a former Wei-Li prince like this, what kindness could they possibly hold for my Li family, for me?'

'The dragon lineage was friendly with the Wei-Li generations ago, and now they invite me into the sea as soon as I reach Foundation Establishment. Their stance is clear... But the fox clan of Mount Dali... what is their role in all of this?'
