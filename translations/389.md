# Chapter 500: Arrival of News

Qingdu Cave Dwelling.

The tightly shut stone door slowly creaked open as Li Qinghong stepped out, her aura steady and strong. The once-vivid lightning that had surrounded her was now more subdued, with only faint traces of electricity flickering at the edges of her hair and robes.

During her seclusion, Li Qinghong had managed to stabilize her cultivation. The dazzling brilliance that had marked her recent breakthrough had dimmed, making it harder to immediately discern her immortal foundation.

Li Yuanjiao had already informed her that he would accompany Li Xuanxuan and Li Xijun to the Hengzhu Dao Gate in Hengdong Prefecture with the protection of the profound spirit mist, leaving Li Qinghong to oversee matters at home.

She flew for a while before descending gracefully, her jade boots lightly touching down on the ground as she rode on purple lightning. In the central hall, Li Xicheng was busy at his desk, surrounded by two piles of letters.

As soon as Li Qinghong entered, the people in the hall immediately kneeled in respect. Li Xicheng also quickly stood and greeted her respectfully.

"Auntie, you've emerged from seclusion already! The thunder altar is already under construction. We are sixty percent through the process and should be able to complete it within a year."

"Good," Li Qinghong replied kindly. Her immortal foundation, the Profound Thunderpool, had the potential to channel thunder and draw down lightning, but its effectiveness had yet to be proven. She had therefore ordered the construction of a high platform as a testing ground for her abilities.

The altar was a complex endeavor, requiring engraved array formations, spirit items, and the crafting of thirty-six hexagonal bronze pieces. Even for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, it was no small task.

Fortunately, the Li Family had ample manpower. Li Qinghong only needed to engrave the necessary array formations while Li Xicheng took care of the rest.

Li Xicheng retrieved two small letters from the table and said, "The Jade Court Guards from Xu State and Zhao State have sent news for the family. Please review them, Auntie."

With a wave of her slender hand, the letters unfolded before Li Qinghong.

The first was from Zhao State. It reported that Chu Yi, the Radiant Fire Spear, had traveled north across Zhao State, where he eliminated three Jie noble families, razed six temples of various sizes, and managed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm despite being pursued. He then retreated to a peak in Luoxia, where he continued his cultivation.

Li Qinghong was stunned by the news. For most Foundation Establishment cultivators, breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm required painstaking preparation. One needed to find an ideal location to enter seclusion, gather numerous spirit items to create array formations and wait for the right alignment of heaven and earth's spirit energies with one's immortal foundation.

Even after such meticulous planning, success demanded years of seclusion with the protection of powerful formations and potent elixirs.

Chu Yi's breakthrough seems almost effortless... He has ascended to the Purple Mansion Realm after just a few months of seclusion. The ease with which he accomplished this was astonishing‚Äîit is virtually unheard of!

He has only taken about... only ten years to reach the Purple Mansion Realm... To break through so quickly... He must be the reincarnation of a Golden Core Realm cultivator!

Chu Yi's swift ascension from Foundation Establishment to the Purple Mansion made it almost certain to the world that he was the reincarnation of a Golden Core Realm cultivator.

The three Jie nobles and the six temples he destroyed were mere pawns and ignorant commoners who had no understanding of the true situation, pushed forward by Buddhist cultivators.

"Ten years... yes, that's only doable for a former Golden Core Realm cultivator," Li Qinghong murmured quietly with a small frown.

However, the letter offered no details about Chu Yi's immortal foundation or his divine abilities, likely because such information was impossible to uncover. Li Qinghong could not help but feel a twinge of disappointment.

Mount Luoxia and Jiangnan rarely have any contact. Now that Chu Yi has entered the mountain, he must be reclaiming his Golden Core's Fruition Attainment and is unlikely to return.

As for the clans in Yufu Prefecture that had been destroyed and the forces that had been eradicated, no one paid them much mind. Li Qinghong quickly scanned through the letter, memorized the key points, and then turned her attention to the next one.

This one reported that a group of devil cultivators had appeared in the barren mountains near the great river in the north, occupying several small hills. Initially, this seemed inconsequential. If not for a rogue cultivator who had escaped from the area, the Li Family might not have even known about it.

The rogue cultivator shared that most of the devil cultivators were not particularly strong, except for one that wielded a blood-colored mirror. Additional details were appended at the end of the letter.

Li Qinghong's eyes narrowed as she wondered aloud, "A blood mirror? Zhang Huaide?!"

Li Xicheng nodded and replied, "According to the rogue cultivator's description, that seems to be him!"

During the Devil Plague, a group of devil cultivators, including Zhang Huaide and Qiu Ji, had come from the west. They had killed Tian Youdao, injured Li Xuanxuan and Xu Gongming before they fled.

Zhang Huaide, who seemed to have powerful connections, had escaped unscathed, using his blood mirror artifact and an escape spell.

Li Qinghong did not particularly care about Zhang Huaide. Qiu Ji was the one who had killed Li Yuanyun, her younger brother, and nearly killed Li Xuanxuan. Her hatred for him ran deep.

"How strong is he now?" she asked in a low voice.

"It's said that he has reached the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. All of the devil cultivators are at the Qi Cultivation Realm, with most of them in the middle or late stages," Li Xicheng replied, his expression tense.

While he was trying to think of a way to dissuade his aunt, Li Qinghong's expression had already turned pensive.

Why does Zhang Huaide have to return just when Big Brother and half of the family's fighting force are away?

Despite the hatred in her heart, Li Qinghong knew this was likely not a coincidence. She took a deep breath and composed herself before instructing softly, "This is too strange. Send someone to investigate."

"Understood!" Li Xicheng replied promptly, relieved by her calmness.

Li Qinghong added, "Find out their exact location. I'll have Wushao go and investigate further. Zhang Huaide has an unusual backing‚Äîhe could be a spy for the three sects. There's something odd about him lingering here."

Li Xicheng responded respectfully. Before leaving on the wind, Li Qinghong repeated her instructions.

"Be sure to get to the bottom of this! It's too much of a coincidence for that rogue cultivator to come to our doorstep at this time... Do not trust his story too easily."

Li Xicheng nodded, watching her depart before returning to his seat. He opened the account book and glanced at Dou Yi, who was standing at the side of the room. In a low voice, he remarked, "181 jin... Is this all the Ni Water Cold Iron we've collected this year?"

Along with his gray hair, Dou Yi now looked a lot more mature and reliable than he was in the past.

"Yes, Young Master. This is all of it," he replied with a nod.

"Alright," Li Xicheng said, waving his hand to dismiss him kindly.

As Dou Yi left, Chen Mufeng stepped forward. Li Xicheng remarked softly, "This amount of Ni Water Cold Iron doesn't match the figures reported from the ore vein by An Zheyan. Send the Jade Court Guards to investigate this matter discreetly. If they uncover anything, report directly to me first."

Chen Mufeng, a trusted ally for many years, replied in a deep voice, "This seems like a foolish method to embezzle resources. The ore vein reserves can be checked easily. If the quantity mined doesn't match the reported figures, it's clear there's a discrepancy... How could they hide it?"

The Li Family possessed the Earthly Court Detection Technique, which made tracking the changes in ore veins straightforward. Most clans like the Xiao Family relied heavily on this method as it allowed them to entrust their ore veins to their subordinate families for mining, leaving no room for deceit.

Li Xicheng shook his head, explaining, "The official report says the ore vein produced 181 jin, but I secretly sent people to check the warehouse‚Äîit actually holds 190 jin of iron, so no one has taken anything yet."

"They must be testing me since I'm new at managing the family. If I made any drastic moves, they'd simply recount the stock and correct the amount to 190 jin. In that case, at worst, I could only accuse them of carelessness, and they'd likely scapegoat a minor sect cultivator from accounting while they were trying to throw me off."

After having assisted Li Yuanping for nearly a decade, Li Xicheng has gained a great deal of experience. Though his capabilities remained to be seen, he understood the covert politics at play.

He thought for a moment before adding, "You can investigate first and report back once you have news. Auntie's matter is more pressing, so we can delay this for now."

Chen Mufeng accepted his task and left. Li Xicheng stood in contemplation for a moment before riding the wind up to Mount Qingdu. After making a big around, he gently landed in an unassuming courtyard.

He knocked on the door and entered. Inside, Li Yuanping was seated on a stone bench, carefully recording something with a brush in his hand.

Though he appeared fine, his hand trembled slightly, and he was struggling to hold the brush steadily.

As soon as Li Xicheng stepped forward, Li Yuanping glanced up and asked, "How do you plan to handle it?"

Li Xicheng hesitated for a moment before replying, "About that... a minor sect cultivator was used as a scapegoat. I'll have the minor sect investigate this. Many of the brothers listen to me, so it shouldn't be too difficult to uncover who altered the numbers in the report..."

Li Yuanping shook his head and spoke softly, "But you will only find yet another scapegoat. I will teach you one final lesson..."

"This whole incident is a test‚Äîto gauge your preferences and to probe your limits. All the forces under your command share in the benefits and silently acquiesce to support this. That minor sect cultivator was just a convenient scapegoat for them... If you rely on them for the investigation, you'll expose your closeness and trust toward the branch families. Whether you rely on the Jade Court Guards, the Dou Family, or peak offices, your inclinations become clear."

He continued in a low voice, "The greatest danger here is that the interests of the cultivators under your command align against yours. On the surface, the minor sect appears as the victim, but in reality, it is complicit. The only truly innocent party is the cultivator that had been made a scapegoat."

Li Xicheng listened intently, only to see Li Yuanping smile coldly before saying, "All you need to do is send someone to the warehouse and quietly adjust the 190 jin to match the reported 181 jin. Once the numbers align, this coalition of opportunists will collapse under their own weight!"

Li Xicheng was stunned, but then realization dawned upon him. He nodded eagerly, a smile spreading across his face as he exclaimed in delight, "That's brilliant!"

He nodded repeatedly, murmuring to himself, "That will really stir the pot! The minor sect will panic and they'll start suspecting each other, wondering which faction turned the false report into reality. Inevitably, they'll start pointing fingers and tear each other apart. All I'll need to do is sit back and arbitrate‚Äîsuppress the strong, support the weak, and maintain the balance of power..."

Li Yuanping did not respond, continuing to write in silence. With his plan set, Li Xicheng bowed deeply and took his leave.

Li Yuanping was counting the days as he meticulously updated the Family History. After a short while, he noticed Li Qinghong arrive, her form subtly crackling with electricity as she sat down beside him gracefully. She pursed her vermillion lips and simply sat in silence.

The two siblings faced each other quietly, with the early spring breeze gently sweeping through the courtyard. Li Yuanping had never spent much time with this elder sister as they had never grown up together.

After a long pause, he finally broke the silence by commenting, "There's indeed something suspicious about Zhang Huaide. Please be patient, Big Sister... You mustn't act impulsively."

Li Qinghong merely replied softly, "I know. I've been patient for so many years... I'm just afraid that if I keep holding back, I'll eventually forget about this resentment."

Li Yuanping snorted, setting his brush down.

"WelI... Isn't that why we record history?"

Li Qinghong glanced at the sheets in front of him.

"Xicheng may not be the strongest, but he's trying his best. I've seen how much he's changed over the past ten years. He's a completely different person now," she remarked.

Li Yuanping nodded in agreement.

"I noticed."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Qinghong had spent several days practicing with her spear on the mountain. Before she could uncover anything about the devil cultivators in the north, a deer demon arrived from the south and landed at the foot of the mountain politely. He waited for An Zheyan and the others to inform the family about his arrival first before entering the mountain.

The deer demon was looking for Li Yuanjiao. Since he was away from home, Li Qinghong was the one to receive him.

The deer demon deer kneeled on all fours before her and, in a human voice, said, "Exalted Immortal, my master has discovered a clue regarding the Blood Sun Fruit. Please follow me to the mountain to discuss the details with him."

"Very well," Li Qinghong replied with a smile and a nod. She summoned Li Wushao from the lake, instructing him to take care of the household before following the deer demon into the mountain.

Li Yuanjiao had mentioned to Li Qinghong about the Foundation Establishment Realm deer demon named Luken before. Hence, she knew that he had picked a mountain that was not particularly tall and set up a demon den on its northern slope. The foot of the mountain was flat, so many deer had been relocated there.

When Li Qinghong and the lesser demon reached the cave, Luken himself came out to greet them. He had brown hair, black eyes, and was slightly taken aback by the sight of her.

"You are...?"
ùôõùíìùíÜùôöùíòùíÜùì´ùô£ùì∏ùô´ùìÆùíç.ùíÑùíêùì∂

"I am Li Qinghong. My brother, Li Yuanjiao, is currently away from home, so I've come in his place," she replied with a smile.

The deer demon blinked and nodded.

"I am Luken. It's a pleasure to meet you, fellow Daoist."

Without beating around the bush further, Luken cupped his fist and explained, "Your brother asked me to track down a treasured panacea known as Blood Sun Fruit. Now that I've found a lead, I wanted to inform your esteemed family."

Li Qinghong nodded.

"I've received multiple reports. A fellow Daoist from the southern slope once wrote to me, claiming to have seen a tiger demon from Mount Quanwu Demon Den possessing this fruit. The description in the letter matches what we know of the Blood Sun Fruit... I believe it to be genuine."

Li Qinghong simply nodded in agreement without saying a word.

Luken shook his sleeves and continued, "That tiger demon holds some sway within the Quanwu Demon Den, though it isn't an important figure and is often bullied."

"Better to act sooner than later. Why don't we ride the wind to Mount Quanwu and seize the panacea before circumstances change?" he suggested.

"Let's seize the spirit fruit first, and if possible, kill the demon. If we manage to slay it, all the better. If not, no harm is done. If we can't take it by force, we'll try to buy it," Luken spoke matter-of-factly.

Li Qinghong had no choice but to nod in agreement. After all, dealing with demon creatures was different; they acted openly and without pretense.

"What is the cultivation level of this tiger demon?" she asked.

"Mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm," Luken replied, noticing the concern on her face.

"But don't worry, fairy. He's just a demon general without a proper Dao lineage. He hasn't learned the spells of the human race and relies solely on his raw demon power," he explained.

He smiled reassuringly and continued, "Give it a month, and you'll see for yourself."

Li Qinghong nodded. Sensing the profound thunder swirling in the thunder pool within her Qihai acupoint, she felt confident in her own strength.

"Lead the way, please," she responded politely.

With that, she followed Luken, and the two soared up into the clouds.

As they flew on, Luken seemed to be mulling over her age and sighed, "The legacy of your esteemed family is truly remarkable... The cultivation speed of you and your elder brother is astonishing, even compared to other clans. It makes us old-timers, who've been cultivating for hundreds of years, feel ashamed."

Li Qinghong offered a few modest words in return. Luken then said, "Which Dao foundation have you cultivated? Since we'll be fighting together soon, we should get to know each other's abilities first."

He activated his mana, and a pair of large antlers appeared on his head. His voice grew deeper and more resonant while the demonic wind he summoned was fresh and filled with renewed vitality.

"Mine is Lingyun Wood. It allows me to heal, control qi, nurture spirit plants, cultivate earth veins, and even transform into plants..." he explained.

As soon as he revealed his immortal foundation, his speed on the wind quickened significantly.

Li Qinghong nodded lightly, and a crackle of purple lightning appeared beneath her feet. Her speed increased even further, her jade armor flashing with violet sparks as she replied softly, "Profound Thunderpool, I can wield thunder and lightning to eliminate demons and suppress evil."
