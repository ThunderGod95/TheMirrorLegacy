# Chapter 1020: Rainbow Glow

'The Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light.'

Li Ximing's eyes swept over the title, and he remarked with approval, "It is more suitable. While both techniques are based on the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, leaving their true grade indiscernible, the Wei-Li heritage is clear. The Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light is obviously more orthodox than the Dharma Scripture of the Distant Crimson Guardian General!"

Li Zhouwei nodded. "Moreover, the cost in Immortal Merits for such techniques is always fixed. The Imperial Codex requires two hundred and twenty, whereas the Dharma Scripture needs only one hundred and eighty-one. The difference is substantial."

"It's just that..." he continued, calculating, "after exchanging for the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence, I was left with one hundred and seventy-five merits. Wiping out that sect and killing Cheng Yan earned me another fifty-seven... for a total of two hundred and thirty-two..."

Li Ximing considered this for a moment, then replied with a touch of wistfulness, "There isn't much left over, is there?"

A faint smile touched Li Zhouwei's lips. "It's a good thing to be able to use them. The real waste would be possessing a mountain of secret manuals and techniques but lacking the means to acquire them. As for Immortal Merits, we will earn more in time."

He raised a hand, drawing three sticks of incense from his sleeve, but then paused. "Though I possess a body of divine abilities, I must not neglect the proper rites. I shall first burn incense and bathe before seeking this heavenly audience."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up with understanding. "Good!"

As they descended from the upper chamber of the pavilion, Li Zhouwei put away the incense and adopted a serious tone. "How far has Lord Yang's campaign progressed?"

Li Ximing, who had clearly been monitoring the situation from the lake, answered in a low voice, "He has already pushed past Lixia!"

They sat down at a stone table, and two moon-white, spherical lanterns on either side immediately lit up. Li Ximing continued, "The Way of Great Desire spread south with abandon, investing considerable effort. Their golden lotuses looked otherworldly, and they even elevated local commoners into the Buddhist faith. Yet, their front collapsed with surprising ease, forcing them back north and leaving behind a trail of followers. These converts were fervent but few, making them quick to eliminate."

"However, I heard some news..." His expression turned somber. "It is said those mountains are now filled with children, steeped in some kind of silver water, corrupted to their very roots. And that Lord Yang, unwilling to resort to slaughter, is sealing these 'lotuses' one by one and sending the children down the mountains to be fostered. This does not bode well."

Li Zhouwei fell silent, pondering this. "That is a matter for the Yang family," he finally said. "For now, Changxiao has been pacified, Si Yuanli is on board, and the mainland is temporarily secure. With this Daoist Master's True Qi pressing into the Wilderness, the northern powers won't dare to start a major conflict at this moment. Our home is enjoying a rare period of safety... I need to make a trip to the Eastern Sea."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing looked as if he wanted to say something but held his tongue as the young man explained, "One must always act with the utmost caution. Although I have the Imperial Codex, I need a proper pretext for its appearance. I will visit the descendants of the Cui clan, ask them some questions to clarify matters, and retrieve those few Bright Yang cultivation arts that belonged to their family."

A flicker of concern crossed Li Ximing's face, but he gave a heavy nod.

Li Zhouwei, however, simply brushed his sleeve, appearing unconcerned.

"Uncle-Grandfather, rest assured, I will not make things difficult for them, nor will I take their arts for free. They will be compensated for whatever I receive."

He lifted his gaze, his golden eyes darkening slightly. "I've also met Yangya. He doesn't strike me as a man of great character, so there's no telling what he might be plotting in secret. This trip will also be a chance to support Cui Jueyin. If Yangya dares to mistreat him, I will not let it slide."

This statement had Li Ximing nodding in vigorous agreement. "Jueyin has served diligently for so many years. This is no longer about the Cui family or the Li family."

"Furthermore..." Li Zhouwei mused, "it would be best if I could meet a dragon. If not, it's no great loss... In that case, I will head to Yinzhou Island and dispose of the Buddhist cultivators' artifacts I have on hand."

Li Ximing thought for a moment. "If that's your plan, you might as well dispose of all this other miscellaneous stuff. I was thinking about this earlier."

He produced the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman, his expression serious. "I already have more than enough Spiritual Artifacts; I can't even make full use of a single Spiritual Treasure. The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron and Sichuan are more than enough for me to handle. Take this talisman and see what you can get for it... If you can trade it for something useful, great. If not, Kuang Yu is scheduled to visit the lake soon. I'll just entrust it to her."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. This was the second time he had heard Kuang Yu's name.

"Uncle-Grandfather," he said, a note of amusement in his voice, "you and this Daoist Master have been getting quite close lately!"

Li Ximing, however, seemed to see nothing unusual about it. He shook his head.

"It's merely a matter of mutual benefit! With the Supreme Yang's light having faded, people like her are gathering together for warmth. Whether it's my Dao lineage or my alchemy skills, I am, after all, useful to them."

Li Zhouwei's brow lifted, a smile touching his lips, "And how is Uncle-Grandfather's 'World's Radiance' coming along?"

An embarrassed smile appeared on Li Ximing's face.

"The first attempt was a failure..." he admitted regretfully.

"I have another three to five years... I can try again then."

Li Zhouwei looked slightly exasperated but still spoke with great solemnity. "I am not blaming you, Uncle-Grandfather. Everyone knows how difficult divine abilities are. If I didn't have a bit of fate on my side, I too would face repeated failures. But time is short. We don't know when the new dynasty will be established or what turmoil will follow. We cannot afford any more delays."

"The family's resources are now plentiful, and our need for Wall-Sinking Water from the Qunyi Archipelago has lessened. You can set aside alchemy for now and focus on advancing your spell arts and mastering your divine ability."

He looked at him directly. "If you do not succeed this next time, I will have to seek out Sima Yuanli. No matter the cost, I will trade for that Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill."

Hearing Li Zhouwei speak so bluntly, Li Ximing's embarrassment vanished. He nodded repeatedly, vowing, "There aren't many pills that need refining anyway. Go, and don't worry about things at home... There is just one thing I must trouble you with."

As Li Zhouwei looked at him questioningly, Li Ximing took two items from his sleeve.

One was a translucent jade vial that emitted a faint white mist, with profound patterns swirling upon its surface. It was the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill! The other item was even more mystical: a short blade with an ivory edge and a jade hilt, its surface covered in ghostly patterns that resembled a bestiary of demonic creatures, glowing with a purple light.

Li Ximing smiled. "While you were away, Dingyang Zi came to see me. This spirit embryo for an Upper Shaman, the Gleaming Edge, has been completed."

"Such speed... Dingyang Zi is truly skilled!" Li Zhouwei nodded, impressed, but then a hint of suspicion entered his voice. "He draws a significant amount of spiritual resources from our family every year to craft this item, yet he works this fast. Perhaps it's some rapid-completion method from the path of Comprehending Profoundity..."

His golden eyes scanned the Gleaming Edge, and his words trailed off. He frowned.

"A fine treasure."

Li Ximing looked at him, puzzled, as Li Zhouwei stared intently at the ivory blade. "Is... is this a spiritual object from the Treasured Earth?"

Nearly everyone who saw the Gleaming Edge would praise it, but Li Ximing had never paid it much mind; it was, after all, only a spirit embryo. But then he heard Li Zhouwei look up and say,

"I have heard that the sign of the Treasured Earth is the Grief Elephant. Where it sleeps, the ground swells into hills known as the Treasure Mound Hills. For a hundred miles around, if it does not rain between the hills when a man and woman marry, pregnancy cannot proceed. She will toil with a swollen belly, unable to give birth... In ancient times, it was a great demon."

He lowered his gaze. "This must be the ivory of a Demon beast related to the Grief Elephant, like a peacock is to its kind. But it's strange... why would such a precious material be used to make a mere spirit embryo?"

Hearing how bizarre this Demon beast was, Li Ximing felt a pang of unease.

"Ultimately, it is a secret of another's Dao lineage. It's best we don't pry. When you have a moment, just hand it over to Jiao Zhongzi."

Only then did Li Zhouwei rise, agreeing to the task. He summoned a bright light and flew off to change his clothes and bathe.

Li Ximing remained standing silently in the pavilion. He stood there for a long while before finally letting out a deep sigh and sitting down cross-legged on the spot.

An unknown amount of time passed before the golden-eyed young man reappeared, standing silently at the top of the stairs. He walked through the long corridor where white mist drifted, ascending step by step to the highest meditation chamber in the High Firmament Pavilion.

The black wooden slip still rested in the groove on the stone dais. His hand swept lightly over it, and a pale, silvery illusion rippled outwards like water.

The silver words that condensed were not the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light. They were six different words.

Rainbow Glow Cloud-Riding Technique.

But these large, silvery words flickered for only an instant before dissipating. A cascade of spell arts and Dao lineages flowed down from top to bottom, appearing one after another in a vast torrent.

'Glimmering Cloudfall Art... Seven-Hued Cloud Seal... Aiding Light Escape Art... Vast Cloud Mystic Art...'

The dense list of Heavenly Glow Dao arts passed before his eyes, but none of them could hold his attention for even a moment. Instead, his gaze slowly lowered.

He remained silent, the face of his uncle-grandfather, Li Ximing, suddenly appearing in his mind. His uncle-grandfather must have discovered this even earlier than he did, yet he had remained perfectly composed, as if nothing was wrong.

'They're all spell arts, with no Dao Lineage.'

'Not a single one.'

---

Hetian Sea.

Mount Duan.

Colorful clouds drifted among the peaks, which shimmered with a radiant glow. At the summit, streams of light intertwined. A streak of rainbow-colored light flew in, landing atop the mountain. It paused for a moment, then flared and shot forward once more.

At the foot of the mountain, groups of Demon beasts roamed. A Daoist nun in a simple gray robe was treading on the wind when she saw a dark streak of light shuttle toward her. It landed on the sea but would not set foot on the mountain, maintaining a distance as it transformed into a middle-aged man.

As the man revealed his form, the Daoist nun looked up, her gaze lingering on him for an extra moment.

"So, the Daoist Master has arrived," she said coolly.

The middle-aged man looked slightly awkward. He glanced down at her and replied, 

"I was on my way to the Peacock Sea and, passing through Hetian, came to see you, sister."

"You are too kind, Daoist Master," the nun replied perfunctorily, her expression far from welcoming. "Now that you have seen me, are there any instructions?"

The man's face was a mask of complex emotions. "Xiao'er, I understand the bitterness in your heart, but we are still family. I haven't seen you in decades... Must you be like this?"

The Daoist nun was none other than Yang Xiao'er! And the man standing opposite her was the Yang family's Daoist Master, Yang Ruiyi, whom Li Zhouwei had met in Simin Prefecture.

Hearing Yang Ruiyi's words, Yang Xiao'er's icy demeanor finally softened slightly. Before she could speak, Yang Ruiyi produced a tiny, pocket-sized pavilion from his sleeve.

The pavilion had nine corners, with one table and four chairs inside. He tossed it lightly into the air, and an inky blackness immediately descended, pulling the two of them inside to stand face to face.

Yang Ruiyi sighed deeply, turned to the side, and clasped his hands behind his back. "Believe it or not... I never thought things with you... would end up like this. When Father arranged it back then, he never imagined it would become part of a grander Bright Yang scheme..."

Yang Xiao'er said nothing. Yang Ruiyi frowned, his tone growing more urgent. 

"The Fox Clan is insignificant. Not just to us, but even to someone like Tang Pan, they are a trivial matter. Why would we go to such great lengths for them! I..."

The Daoist nun before him cut him off. "It seems the matter of Li Jiangliang wasn't considered such a great length either," Yang Xiao'er said flatly.

Yang Ruiyi faltered.

"Just listen to me..." he pleaded, raising his brow.

"The Jiangliang affair happened after the greater situation between the north and south was already decided. We needed the White Qilin, and the Li family needed a token of trust from us. That's why it happened... It was a decision made at a much higher level and cannot be conflated with Father's arrangements..."

A shadow of melancholy crossed his face. "Father only has a few children. You were born with poor aptitude and no spiritual apertures, so he went to great lengths to acquire the Treasured Qi of the Grand Pure Spirit Palace just to help open them for you... But that item's power is limited; it cannot grant a divine ability... Father only ever wanted you to be safe..."

Yang Ruiyi's expression dimmed. "Later, when the Ning-Li bloodline emerged, Father was in charge. He already had ties to the Ning-Li and saw that Li Xizhi was a good man, so he sent you to the mountains to see if a match could be made... He never expected you to fall in love at first sight... Father was very pleased at the time, saying it was fate bringing our two families together..."

"After all... after all, it's the Ning-Li. What's the harm in preserving a branch or two!"

Yang Xiao'er's expression slowly began to change, but she remained silent, listening to her brother's sigh.

"Back then, we gave no thought to Bright Yang at all!" he lamented, then suddenly looked up.

"You have to understand, the White Qilin's descent only happened after Chenghuai was born. If we had known sooner, I would never... I would never have let him be named Li!"

Yang Xiao'er's voice was flat. "You put it so well, brother. Whether it's me or my child, the higher-ups don't care. It is precisely because they don't care that all this trouble started."

She took a step forward, a trace of sorrow on her plain face. "I am no fool. Brother, you don't need to make excuses for Father... Father... I will call him that, for now..."

"He valued my husband because of his good standing with the Ning-Li. He only wanted to use our Yang family bloodline to protect that one or two branches. But there was a deeper fear behind it... The Anhuai and Wanling Grotto-heavens, wasn't it?"

Yang Ruiyi lowered his head as his sister's soft voice continued, "Father ultimately acted out of personal feelings, wanting only to preserve a bloodline for a rainy day. He never wanted my husband to achieve greatness and attract attention, which would bring down the wrath of those above, ensuring no one could be saved. In his heart, he hoped my husband would remain mediocre, or perhaps die in the process of breaking through, so long as the bloodline was passed on."

"But how could the Ning-Li bloodline produce a simple man? A sword immortal had already emerged, and that sword immortal was even my husband's clan elder... The Anhuai and Wanling Grotto-heavens were bound to open sooner or later. As a descendant of the Ning-Li, who knows what fated opportunities he might encounter?"

"So, you all discreetly pointed him down a dead end, hoping he would go no further. You even deliberately kept him away from those two grotto-heavens, ensuring he couldn't possibly stumble upon them... How very cautious..."

She smiled gently, a mix of pride and sorrow on her face. "But my husband is no ordinary man. Even walking the dead-end road of Rainbow Glow, his Dao-Profundity grows day by day. Seeing this, Father has begun to feel afraid again, hasn't he?"

Yang Xiao'er raised her eyes, looking directly at the Daoist Master.

"Brother, am I right?"
