# Chapter 1168: Suspicions

"The Chunyi Dao Gate?"

Amidst the drifting clouds of the mountain, a man in a crimson robe stood beneath a tree. The heart-fire beneath the gold-trimmed garment burned with the true nature of Li Fire, while a profound light surged beside him, from which a gentle voice emerged.

"That's right. The way of Supreme Yin, after all, belongs to Azure Profoundity. Cultivators below the Azure Step called it the First Treasury. It is a treasury of both Daoist canon and of concealment. Thus, it's known as the great Immortal Dao for evading disaster and calamity."

The profound pine spoke eloquently, its knowledge vast and its Dao-Profundity unfathomable.

"Among the Three Profoundities, the Dao of Azure Profoundity is lofty and solitary, yet all flock to it. Every cultivator who emerges from its tradition is a hero among mortals. While their selection process is notoriously strict, another reason is that disaster and calamity cannot bind them... Even the Demonic Ancestor's inheritance, the Profound Crimson Demonic Legacy, contains profound arts of evasion."

"But it is precisely because this tradition cannot be restrained by calamity, in defiance of the Heavenly Dao, that the disciples of Azure Profoundity have always been few. In ancient times, they vanished from the mortal realm entirely. Even a True Monarch of the Encompassing Profoundity, seeking to save a life, had to journey all the way to the Huan family in the Northern Sea just to have them extend an invitation on his behalf."

The voice's tone shifted.

"However, the master of Azure Profoundity has many traditions under him; even the Great Sage addresses him as 'Master.' In the present age, Azure Profoundity has numerous traditions that engage with the world. There are four direct lineages: two that study the arts of worldly manifestation, and two that study the ways of concealment. One who ascended through Supreme Yin is known as Changtang. The Nine Mounds Daoist tradition can be traced back to one of his ancient lineages... You could also ask the Great Daoist Master of the Dantai family."

"If you don't wish to pursue those two avenues, the Two Rites of the Three Shamans and Two Rites might offer a solution. However, one has sealed its mountain gate, and the other is ethereal and without a trace—neither is easy to find."

The one wreathed in Li Fire was none other than Li Jiangqian. He had traveled a long way to find the rogue cultivator, Daoist Master Shanbai, only to learn that the man had already departed for the Purple Smoke Gate to help the injured Daoist Master Wenqing heal her Dharma body. His journey was for naught.

Fortunately, his family hadn't placed much hope in Shanbai to begin with. Without pausing, Li Jiangqian made his way to the Sword Gate, where he had the unexpected fortune of meeting this senior, Heaven's Horn.

Li Jiangqian returned the gesture of respect, his mind working. He raised his brow and asked,

"Dare I ask, Senior... the Green Pine Temple's Supreme Yang Daoist tradition—to what Dao does it trace its origins?"

As soon as he spoke, the winds above the Sword Gate gradually fell silent. The profound pine rustled, then stilled for a moment before answering.

"My Supreme Yang Daoist tradition traces its origins back to the Dao of Azure Profoundity, spreading the radiance of Yin and Yang to the world below. Before the Lord attained the Dao, he cultivated in the Mystic Realm of Manifesting Splendor and resided in Gonghua Heaven. The tradition was passed down by the Mysterious Monarch Changjing."

"In terms of seniority, he was of the same generation as the True Monarch who founded the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition, and he later assumed the primary seat of Supreme Yang."

Li Jiangqian sensed the finality in his tone and didn't press further. He frowned.

"If that's the case... why did Chunyi..."

The mountain winds began to flow once more, and shafts of clear light filtered down. Heaven's Horn continued,

"Supreme Yin inherently possesses methods for averting disaster; that is one reason. Secondly, during their cultivation at Green Pine Temple, the six lords each had their own unique comprehensions. Ancestral Master Chunyi alone obtained only a single Supreme Yin cultivation method. The Lord thus dispatched him to Jiangnan, where he entered Donghua Heaven and cultivated in seclusion within an Immortal Mansion for several years, which is how he achieved his gains."

Li Jiangqian pondered this for a moment, and the doubt in his mind dissolved into understanding.

‘Mysterious Monarch Changjing…’

In all his years of cultivation, he had only ever seen the title "Mysterious Monarch" in one text.

The Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record.

It was the very art Li Jiangchun practiced day in and day out.

He said no more, merely committing the name to memory. Cherishing his life, he knew better than to ask further. He looked up and said,

"I see. Thank you, Senior, for your guidance!"

The profound pine rustled but offered no further reply. Li Jiangqian rose, bowed his thanks, and departed. He walked out from the mountains and vanished into the Great Void.

Yet the winds within the mountains continued to surge. The emerald needles of the profound pine flickered, as if suppressing a rolling Metal Malice. Vaguely, a drifting golden mist began to rise, and from it, a figure in white robes stepped forth.

It was the Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal—Cheng Xunzhi.

This sword immortal, who had played a decisive role in the conflict between north and south, had not gone to the Song court to pay his respects, nor had he concerned himself with the Yang Clan. Once the great war subsided, he had simply returned to his mountain gate and had remained seated in meditation until this very day.

His expression was placid, but within his sword-like eyes, the essence of Dui Metal roiled, emanating a soul-shaking pressure. From the sky, a continuous rain of Horn Wood radiance fell like a gentle spring shower, ceaselessly dissolving the sword malice that threatened to erupt from his body.

"A blood descendant of Bright Yang..."

"A pitiful soul..." Heaven's Horn replied gravely.

Cheng Xunzhi then said, "Master told me to take Senior's surname, so I am surnamed Li. My name is Li Mei, a descendant of the Wei-Li line—I do not know his intention in this."

His voice was like a golden wind, scraping against the branches and making them rustle. The profound pine explained,

"Before the Lord attained the Dao, while he was still tempering himself in the world, he met a Daoist. They drank and spoke with great cheer. Using their cups as tallies, they played a drinking game. When they tallied the pairs at the end, the Daoist still owed the Lord one cup. So, he took a fruit from his sleeve and gifted it to the Lord."

"The Lord brought the fruit back to the mountain and planted it upon the peak, and it grew to become the Heaven's Horn of today. Because that Daoist was surnamed Li and called himself a descendant of the Wei-Li, Heaven's Horn took Li as its surname."

A flicker of emotion crossed Cheng Xunzhi's face. He nodded.

"No wonder there is a bond between us."

His voice was like the grinding of metal, causing the Horn Wood radiance above to grow thicker. Meanwhile, the colors of the heavens were in constant flux. In the western sky, the golden qi rapidly receded, gradually revealing the sky's natural hue.

"They have yielded White River."

Cheng Xunzhi stood, gazing at the fading gold, a hint of doubt in his expression.

"Why... why would Golden Feather intervene to stop me?"

His sharp eyes swept across the mountainside, the sheer force of his gaze pressing the grass and trees low to the ground. As the Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal slowly narrowed his eyes, a soft rustling sound filled the air.

‘He cultivates Dui Metal and also wields the divine ability Present Departs Old… Is He not afraid?’

The profound pine swayed slightly and fell silent as well, knowing full well what he was referring to.

The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition had always regarded the Daos of Dui and Geng as their private domain, absolutely forbidding others from trespassing upon them. Yet, both Daos were notoriously mutable, meaning they had to guard against every cultivator in the world who practiced them.

Cheng Xunzhi was a prodigious talent, a true master in this field. He was taught by the profound pine, who had been a disciple of the Dui Metal True Monarch of old, and was even considered the True Monarch's successor. His chances of ascending to the golden position were not small. If he, Cheng Xunzhi, were to become a True Monarch, what would his stance toward Golden Oneness be?

This was the very fear that plagued the Sword Gate and Cheng Jiuwen, though they dared not speak it aloud. Even Cheng Xunzhi himself, before awakening to his past life, had believed it was the wariness of Golden Oneness that had barred his path to advancement.

Even when he became a Great Daoist Master and journeyed to Tangdao Mountain, he was intercepted by cultivators of the Golden Feather Sect. He had been fully prepared to be surrounded and killed on the spot, an act that could have easily ignited a war between Golden Feather and the Underworld.

But nothing happened.

Daoist Master Chunshuo had merely blocked his path for a moment before gently letting him pass. The meaning behind that single act was worlds apart from what he had expected.

Tian Langzhi of Tangdao Mountain was a Liangli of the Way of Great Desire; the Dharma Master backing him would never give him up. If Cheng Xunzhi had truly clashed with him, the probability of his own demise would have been exceedingly high. It was Daoist Master Chunshuo's timely delay that prevented a full-blown battle at Tangdao.

‘They don't want to eliminate me... they actually want to protect me!’

‘For what reason? For the sake of the Underworld's grand scheme? How could the petty affairs of the Yang family possibly compel True Monarch Taiyuan to risk the theft of Geng Metal just to protect me? Never mind whether the Yang family has that much influence, who in this world could stop that True Monarch from taking what he desires?’

This sword immortal was a genius the likes of which the Sword Gate had not seen in a century, yet he was far from stubborn. He was a reformer with a remarkably clear mind, and in an instant, suspicion about the entire arrangement bloomed.

‘What if the ones who wanted to protect me... were Golden Feather all along?’

A chaotic hue of gold and white churned in his gaze.

‘It should have been… during the great war between north and south, Tangdao Mountain should have fallen early. After Liu Bai had been dead for a very long time... only then would the Underworld have had me retake Tangdao... leaving no flaw in the plan.’

‘It was Li Zhouwei's unexpected stand at Lake Xian, defending it to the death, and the swiftness with which Qi Lanyan was slain. These events prevented the northern and southern fronts from tying me down, allowing me to head north ahead of schedule. Tian Langzhi's subsequent actions crossed a line and shattered the tacit understanding among the factions of the Underworld, forcing Chunshuo's hand... and arousing my suspicions.’

‘Could it be that this whole affair... was a scheme by the northern powers, like Tian Langzhi, targeting Golden Feather?’

The light in his eyes wavered. The Pear Blossom Spiritual Sword in his hand remained perfectly still amidst the swirling Metal Malice.

‘Golden Feather…’

---

Li Jiangqian traveled far from the Sword Gate, his mind racing.

‘Thankfully, the Chunyi Dao Gate is near the coast!’

He was a very cautious man. Though he had many friends, his enemies were far more numerous, terrifyingly so—especially the Way of Great Desire and Changxiao.

‘A journey all the way to the Eastern Sea would be fraught with peril. But the Chunyi Dao Gate is near Fenkuai. The path is well-traveled, under the eyes and ears of the world, so no one should be able to intercept me. If a fight were to break out, the entire nation would bear witness.’

Li Zhouwei's injuries could not wait. Without further hesitation, he stepped into the Great Void, preparing to soar eastward. Suddenly, his divine ability flared. He raised his brows and looked to the west.

His own Daoist Master was approaching, accompanied by Guo Nanwu.

Guo Nanwu had spent a considerable amount of time with the Li family and had long been acquainted with the young man before him. Seeing Li Jiangqian now, his eyes were filled with admiration. He cupped his hands.

"Congratulations, Daoist Friend Changli!"

Li Jiangqian let out a calm laugh.

"So it is Senior Nanwu."

Li Jiangqian's golden eyes stared at him, making Guo Nanwu feel slightly unnerved. He quickly turned to Li Ximing.

"Elder, your timing is perfect. Jiangqian was just preparing to leave for Chunyi."

"Indeed," Li Ximing said, his gaze much calmer now, holding a hint of joy.

When Guo Nanwu had so seriously suggested Chunyi, Li Ximing hadn't known whether to laugh or cry.

‘If I weren't trying to conceal my family's wealth, when it comes to Supreme Yin spiritual qi, this Chunyi Dao Gate would be left speechless before me! To think I would have to seek help from across the sea…’

Beyond the joy, the suggestion was a moment of sudden enlightenment. Li Ximing's heart pounded as he remembered something else.

‘That Supreme Yin treasured pill!’

Years ago, upon his return from the Nine Mounds, Li Ximing had used a Shade-Cleansing Qi Pill from his dantian and a Supreme Yin Moon Orchid to refine three great pills.

He had consumed one himself and sent another to the Chunyi Gate, leaving just one in his possession. But with one key insight, a hundred doors open. In Li Ximing's view, he might not even need to use it.

‘This treasured pill was once the pinnacle of my alchemy, but I have since advanced further. While I may not have such a fortuitous opportunity again, my family has an abundance of Supreme Yin qi!’

In the family's early days, the main body of the Immortal Mirror had caused frequent phenomena, producing many high-grade Supreme Yin spiritual items. They had lacked proper preservation methods back then; for generations, from Li Xuanxuan to Li Yuanjiao, their best method was the jade box from Pingya Island, which had saved one precious portion.

‘This can be used. Even after it’s gone, within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, Supreme Yin qi erupts from beneath the pavilion. Although slightly inferior, it is all of extremely high grade. It is merely a matter of harmonizing the life-mandate. As long as we are willing to invest the spiritual resources, we can almost certainly refine another batch!’

‘Furthermore, the original pill was infused with a trace of Lesser Yin and Pure Qi from the Shade-Cleansing Spiritual Pool, containing a rare sliver of cold moon spiritual qi. Zhouwei's condition isn't critical right now. It would be best to save this pill for Jiangchun…’

Before departing, he had specifically visited the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance and learned of its wondrous ability to isolate Wu Earth. His mind was already whirring with calculations.

‘I once considered trading with Chunyi for their Supreme Yin pill formula, but my intentions were too obvious, and the exchange failed. Now… now is the perfect opportunity!’

Back then, he didn't have the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance and would have had to hide far out at sea just to dare refine a Supreme Yin pill. Now, with all the necessary conditions aligned, it was incredibly convenient. 

His heart burned with excitement. This thought settled him, and greatly relieved, he set off toward the Eastern Sea. Guo Nanwu, meanwhile, continued to size up Li Jiangqian.

"Daoist Friend... to cultivate the true nature of Li Fire is quite rare. As a descendant of Bright Yang, the two are mutually reinforcing. Your future is boundless. It is only a pity that in today's Jiangnan, there is not much Li Fire left."

Li Jiangqian smiled and replied, "The Central Plains has plenty."

Guo Nanwu was taken aback for a moment. He gave him an odd look, then said with praise, "A prince, through and through!"

Li Ximing listened with his hands clasped behind his back as they traveled north. As the undulating mountain gate of their destination appeared before them, he spoke.

"The Nine Mounds is simply too far. With the turmoil on the lake and powerful enemies lurking in the shadows, I cannot travel so far myself. I will have to trouble you, Nanwu..."

The Chunyi Dao Gate, after all, lacked the prestigious history of the Nine Mounds. Li Ximing had been preparing for both possibilities from the start. Seeing Guo Nanwu nod his assent, he smiled.

"Nanwu, please wait a moment."

He flipped his hand, and Helian Wujiang's Dao sword appeared. The two broken pieces of the intricately patterned blade lay in his palm, the fractured surfaces gleaming brightly. Guo Nanwu's eyelids twitched.

"The Profound-Name Dao-Malice Sword..." he sighed. "So, Helian Wujiang has fallen."

Li Ximing hadn't expected him to recognize the artifact. He nodded.

Guo Nanwu's expression turned serious.

"My ancestors also wandered the Central Plains. This item has a long history. It was originally a seal bestowed by the Great Qi. After the Qi dynasty fell, an ancestor of the Helian family, Helian Bo, swiftly melted the seal down and extracted the Profound-Name Dao-Malice within to forge this sword."

"This substance is now extinct. It is the very source of this sword's power."

Since his family had no use for malice qi, Li Ximing had long intended to reforge it. It wasn't just the sword he planned to get rid of; he had no intention of keeping the other saber and whip either. If he had already refined them and understood their secrets, he would have sent them along as well. 

Hearing Guo Nanwu's explanation gave him a better idea. He smiled.

"This was once a fine spiritual artifact, but it was broken in two before it fell into my family's hands. I'll ask you, Nanwu, to take it to Qusi on your way and have the two Daoist Masters there take a look for me. Have them extract its essence..."

Guo Nanwu agreed, took the broken sword, and departed. Li Jiangqian watched him go before turning back with a smile.

"Please wait a moment, Grand-Uncle. I will go down and pay my respects to the gate."
