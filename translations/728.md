# Chapter 728: Battle in the Wilderness

Situ Mo was indeed no ordinary opponent. Suppressed by True Fire and targeted by the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, he still managed to seize a fleeting opportunity when Ding Weizeng escaped, turning the tide of the battle. Li Minggong and his companion couldn't rush to the rescue in time. An Siwei only fought back three moves before he was severely wounded and captured. The next moment, Situ Mo's cold voice emerged.

"Attack the mountain!" he commanded.

Situ Mo unfastened a seal from his waist and tossed it into the air. It transformed into a stone mountain that pressed down upon the Chongming Profound Insight Screen. Li Minggong only needed a single glance to recognize the familiar mountain; it was likely a gift from the Profound Peak Gate to the Golden Tang Gate during a period of close relations. This Dharma Artifact was of a high grade. The moment it pressed down, Li Minggong's spiritual qi consumption doubled. Situ Mo stood before the two of them with his blade drawn, while five people behind him descended on the wind to attack the main peak of Funan.

Situ Mo's combat experience was far superior to his opponents. Although he couldn't defeat them, the mountain beneath their feet couldn't escape either. He held his ground, defending rather than attacking, and used his Dharma Artifact to fight the two opponents at once, holding back Li Minggong and Ding Weizeng. A great crash echoed.

"BOOM!"

The great formation beneath their feet shattered in just two rounds. The Li Clan cultivators were exposed like shivering sheep before the Foundation Establishment cultivators. Li Minggong's pupils widened slightly. Situ Mo had already captured the severely wounded An Siwei and, striking while the iron was hot, shouted, "Li Minggong! The Floating Cloud Territory cannot be held! I will release this man. Lead your people and retreat across the river! I swear I will not pursue!"

Li Minggong remained unshaken, her Dharma Artifact's brilliance intensifying. An Siwei, however, gritted his teeth, his face flushing crimson, causing Ding Weizeng and Situ Mo to change their expressions simultaneously.

"He's throwing his life away!"

Situ Mo, from a prestigious lineage, instantly saw that An Siwei was preparing a desperate attack. A golden flash of light burst from his eyes, hitting An Siwei's forehead, and he quickly dispersed his spiritual qi. But in that single instant of delay, Situ Mo felt a powerful force. His robes lit up on their own, and he felt as if he had been struck by something, his vision spinning. He was rapidly thrown backward, almost spitting up a mouthful of blood. Yet his will was tougher than an ordinary person's. Despite this sudden, unexpected attack, he did not release his hold on his technique. He pulled An Siwei to a halt and looked closer, seeing that another person had appeared in his original spot.

This was a young man in a multi-colored feathered robe. His face was slightly round, and his eyes were clear, but the dense orange feathers at his temples revealed him to be a demon.

"Dawn Rayfish?" he muttered, slightly stunned.

Several figures appeared on Funan's main peak. His own people had been forced back and were gathering around him. Situ Mo tossed the captured person to a subordinate, then suddenly leaned backward, and a dark shadow became visible, sweeping past his chin and leaving a dark red trail of blood.

"You shameless bastard with no father or mother!"

The Hooked Serpent's vertical pupil emerged from the shadow. Li Wushao, holding two black swords, was already lunging at his sides. Situ Mo's feathered robes shook, and he drifted back a few steps, evading the attack. Golden energy surged throughout his body, flowing from his robes and into his limbs, making his long blade glow brightly.

Beneath them, the enormous white ape in its true form and the elusive Li Chenghuai were battling with the Golden Tang Gate cultivators. In the Floating Cloud Territory, spiritual energy fluctuated as True Fire and Geng Metal clashed, disturbing the spiritual aura of the area. The mortals below stumbled into the woods, huddling on the ground and trembling.

In the wilderness, compared to the extreme chaos of the Floating Cloud Territory, the area was more vast and seemed quieter. The golden-eyed man sat imperiously in the Profound Light, in a standoff with several figures on the river before him.

The Capital immortals Dao cultivators in front of him were shrouded in a faint gray mist. Above their heads floated a brown stone stele, covered in dense, intricate patterns. The person at the head was dressed in a black Daoist robe with a silk sash tied at his waist. The front of his robe was a stark silver-white, and there were black markings painted on both of his cheeks. His attire, while strange, held a peculiar kind of aesthetic beauty. He had high brows and deep-set eyes, and he was none other than Guan Gongxiao, the foremost disciple of the Capital immortals Dao. He was at the late Foundation Establishment stage. Although he hadn't been in the late stage for long, he was extremely proficient in techniques, and could be called the foremost among his Daoist peers.

The wilderness was long, and it was the home ground of the Profound Peak Gate and the Li Clan. Their communication and defensive capabilities were exceptional. Li Zhouwei had not appeared at the riverside at first, and even the outermost defensive forces were sparse, making the area seem somewhat empty. But Guan Gongxiao was no fool. He didn't rush deep into the territory all at once, but first sent people to attack a few strategic mountain peaks to ensure a means of advance and retreat. So Li Zhouwei came forward to block him, and they held a stalemate at the riverside.

The wilderness was a vast territory, yet Li Zhouwei was unwilling to let the Profound Peak Gate's forces scatter. Most of the territory only had Qi Refining and Embryonic Breathing cultivators, with Foundation Establishment cultivators only stationed at key locations. Here, however, was the Profound Peak Gate's main force: nine of the Kong Clan's fifteen Foundation Establishment cultivators were here, led by Fu Yuezi. The remaining five were led by Li Zhouwei and included Cui Jueyin, Li Wen, Qu Bushi, and Miaoshui. Adding the people from the Kong Clan and the still-unarrived Li Chenghui, there were fifteen in total.

Both sides had sufficient numbers. The Capital immortals Dao side, with Guan Gongxiao, Gongsun Bofan, and others, had even more, a total of eighteen. It could be called the largest battle since the North-South conflict.

Li Zhouwei was waiting for Li Chenghui, and Guan Gongxiao was waiting for the Golden Tang Gate. After a brief stalemate, the aura in the east shifted, and baleful energy soared into the sky. Kong Guxi's expression changed dramatically.

Li Zhouwei didn't even need to ask; he knew the Profound Peak Gate's outlying areas had fallen. The Capital immortals Dao wouldn't have put all their people here, so a considerable number of guest cultivators must have infiltrated from various directions.

'The wilderness is a vast and permeable territory. My clan alone cannot possibly defend it all. We should retreat and focus on defending against the main force.'

The tension was growing more intense. The jade pendant on Li Zhouwei's waist grew warm, letting him know that Li Chenghui was just a few breaths away. The Profound Light in his brow flashed. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light surged forth, piercing across the river. The Capital immortals Dao immediately sent a stone stele flying to block the radiant light.

Without a single unnecessary word, the static scene erupted into motion. Spiritual qi and brilliant light rose everywhere. Li Zhouwei charged forward with his halberd. The first to meet him was none other than the straw-cloaked Gongsun Bofan!

With a resolute look in his eyes, he drew his blade. In contrast, Guan Lingdie stepped back, unwilling to engage him, and instead went after the "soft target," Qu Bushi. It was clear that their past clashes had left a significant impression on her. Now, with the possibility of life-or-death peril in the great battle, she immediately retreated.

Gongsun Bofan wanted to meet the charge, but Cui Jueyin didn't give him the chance. The elegant, scholarly man scoffed, and Steps of Radiance appeared beneath his feet, pulling Gongsun Bofan into them.

With Gongsun Bofan blocked, Guan Gongxiao's gaze shot over like an arrow. The Daoist book in his hand flipped open on its own, facing the incoming halberd. A vast expanse of river water surged from the book, swirling and dancing at his feet.

Li Zhouwei's Profound Light shone down, piercing into Guan Gongxiao's eyes. The latter only saw a man with golden pupils and nothing particularly extraordinary, and a cold smirk appeared on his face.

"Let's see just how mighty this White Qilin really is!"
