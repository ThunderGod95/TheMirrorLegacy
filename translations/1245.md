# Chapter 1245: The Time Limit

With his profound Dao-Profundity, Li Zhouwei had long ago calculated that he could leverage the aura of his complete recovery to refine the immortal foundation in a single stroke. He had secretly saved himself another year or two in the process, and, in high spirits, he patted Li Que'wan on the shoulder with a smile.

"You've worked hard!"

Seeing his aura become even more formidable, the woman was also pleasantly surprised, her eyes and brows curving as she smiled.

"Easing Your Majesty's burdens is this junior's duty!"

Li Zhouwei chuckled and shook his head before speaking with a serious expression.

"I spent twelve years healing, and it has also been twelve years since your breakthrough, yet your cultivation has been hindered by trivial family matters. You need not struggle with them any longer—that golden scripture from the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, have you begun gathering qi from it?"

Li Que'wan nodded quickly.

"That qi is called the Profound Qi of Cherished Transformation. It is gathered from places where gold and mercury transmute, so it isn't difficult to find. We have Tangdao Mountain nearby, which has been the most ideal site for such transformations in recent years. It should be easy to gather. My elder brother has already dispatched people, and by my count, we should have results soon."

"Good."

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully.

"That's true. The qi for your 'Awaiting the Supreme Divine' came from the Chengshui Marsh, a place transformed by one of Daoist Master Qiushui's great spell arts. Now, the qi for your 'Nurtured Harmony' also lies on Tangdao Mountain. It seems everything is inseparable from the methods of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition."

Li Que'wan nodded, deeply moved, as she listened to King Wei speak.

"Have you practiced any spell arts?"

Li Que'wan quickly replied.

"I've already achieved initial success with that Sleeve Dwelling Art!"

She explained her thoughts one by one, but was surprised when Li Zhouwei said gravely.

"I've looked at this spell art as well… When it was first brought to the family, I spent some time reading it and made an unexpected discovery."

Li Zhouwei flicked his sleeve, revealing a dark, cavernous space from which the sound of wind echoed—it was the Sleeve Dwelling!

"Hmm?"

Li Que'wan froze, utterly astonished.

"His Majesty's Dao-Profundity—has actually reached such a level!"

Even with her abilities, aided by 'Awaiting the Supreme Divine', it had taken her years to practice the Sleeve Dwelling Art. Li Zhouwei, having no special reason to do so, would surely not have spent one or two years of his precious time cultivating such a technique!

'In other words… spell arts are effortless for His Majesty!'

Understanding the difficulty involved, Li Que'wan was truly shocked, but the young man simply chuckled and shook his head.

"While Dao-Profundity is important, there are occasional exceptions… This was because of the Profound Vastness Art."

Li Que'wan immediately recalled the 'Pure Qi' method that Li Zhouwei had cultivated long ago to heal his body. She herself had been the one to help attune the qi back then, and understanding dawned on her.

"'Pure Qi'!"

"Correct."

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Even back then, I felt this art had the essence of a fundamental law and suspected it held deeper applications. I never imagined it would resonate with the Sleeve Dwelling Art; a single wisp of Pure Qi was all it took for me to master it."

"Unfortunately… its subsequent cultivation is truly difficult, and for me… it's not a particularly valuable spell art."

Li Que'wan immediately understood his meaning.

"This junior will study the Profound Vastness Art. It's perfect, as healing arts are also crucial for me!"

Li Zhouwei nodded, then changed the subject.

"By your estimation, how long will it take to nurture the immortal foundation for your next divine ability?"

Li Que'wan pinched her fingers to calculate.

"Although I was injured, I've replenished everything and still have a great deal of medicinal power left to digest. My great-uncle's last pill of Pit Water Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder is also in my possession. After consuming it, and with the aid of 'Awaiting the Supreme Divine', I should be able to succeed within six or seven years…"

This pace was by no means slow, yet Li Zhouwei frowned slightly.

'Six or seven years… I suspect there will be trouble at the border again by then!'

He then declared, "There's no need to be frugal. Your great-uncle still has five pellets of Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder. The faster, the better!"

The woman before him spoke again.

"But there is one other matter… the Great Void construction!"

She relayed Li Jiangqian's concerns one by one, but Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal.

"You need not consider this matter for now. Continue cultivating here. I am going out for a while."

Li Que'wan raised her eyebrows, hesitating as if she wanted to say more. The young man understood her concern.

"Rest assured, I won't leave Moongaze Lake. With the Azure Insight Origin Mirror, no one will be able to divine my whereabouts."

Only then did the woman acquiesce and withdraw. Li Zhouwei, for his part, straightened his ink-black robes, took a single, light step, and vanished from the world.

…

Moongaze Lake.

The surface of the great lake shimmered as fish frolicked beneath. Li Suining rode the wind back from the shore, accompanied by a man who navigated with a pale white light, appearing quite relaxed.

"Elder Brother, your judgment was correct… Daoist Friend Pu's cultivation is progressing at an incredible rate, and the few clan brothers he brought with him are all very capable. The Pu clan is truly teeming with talent."

Li Suining seemed distracted but still nodded.

"I recommended him to Nantanchen… Although he has forged many connections through alchemy over the years, he is still often looked down upon for his origins. Those two appreciate each other; it would be good for them to offer mutual support."

He glanced down at the lake below.

"In the 'Sui' generation, the three of us rose to prominence early, but we still can't compare to the 'Jiang' and 'Que' generations. All those individuals are capable, and we must put every one of them to use."

Li Suikuan laughed.

"How can you even compare? King Wei has four children, not to mention the first genius in two hundred years to reach the Purple Mansion Realm and the second sword immortal to emerge from the lake. In my opinion… forget our generation, you could combine the next three and still not produce so many prodigies!"

A complex smile touched Li Suining's lips.

"What are you saying!"

Yet, in his heart, he knew his younger brother was right. This island was experiencing a peak of fortune unseen in centuries. In the coming decades, no one would be able to catch up to the current Family Head, Li Suihuan, let alone people like Li Que'wan and Li Zhouwei.

An inexplicable feeling washed over him.

"I wonder if King Wei has recovered…"

Hearing this, Li Suikuan was not particularly concerned.

"King Wei is now Jiangnan's foremost general, having pacified Jianghuai and slain two mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators in succession. He is the Great Song's greatest meritorious official. Both sentiment and logic dictate that the Song court must see to his recovery. I am not worried."

"Alas…"

Li Suining only sighed, but Li Suikuan continued.

"Don't chide me, Elder Brother… Nowadays, whenever someone from our family travels, are they not respectfully addressed as a royal descendant of an Immortal Clan? I consider myself among the least arrogant… and yet when I'm polite to others, they ask me, 'Sir, why are you so humble!'"

"In terms of bloodline, we have the blood of the Bright Yang King and the legacy of the Great Wei's imperial enterprise. In terms of merit, the Li family's contribution to pacifying Jianghuai is second to none. In terms of power, a peerless king, and three Holders of Profound assisting the court… as long as the Yang family remains inactive, the Li family is the Great Song's First Manifest Clan!"

A smile graced his face.

"Furthermore, our family's rules are strict, producing many fine and talented individuals, and our reputation is sterling. The lands on both shores depend on us. Scholars seek to profit by associating with people of Wei, and women see it as an honor to marry into the Li family. Even the Chen, An, Ding, and Tian families are elevated beyond the ordinary!"

Li Suining was silent for a long while, looking at the smile on his younger brother's face, as if seeing a past version of himself.

"The royal blood and imperial legacy are the old sins of the fallen Wei. The pacification of Jianghuai is the merit of a single king. The three Holders of Profound assist the court because we are of noble royal descent. All of this is merely the affair of the Qilin's house. How can you or I lay claim to it?"

He let out a faint sigh, his voice as thin as a thread of silk.

"When our nobility hinges on a single person, how can it possibly last…"

The expression on Li Suikuan’s face underwent a subtle, complex shift. He glanced quietly at his elder brother and sighed.

"Elder Brother receives much attention from the Daoist Masters. Perhaps you hold a different view…"

But Li Suining had no time to reply. At some unknown point, a figure had appeared on the shimmering surface of the lake before him. Clad in billowing ink-black robes, with smiling golden eyes, the man stared at him quietly.

'King Wei!'

A torrent of joy illuminated Li Suining's eyes, and he felt a wave of heat rush to their corners. Though this was far from the first time he had seen Li Zhouwei, he always felt a profound sense of security in that moment. Forcibly suppressing his elation, he turned his head and feigned composure.

"I am returning to my cave dwelling to cultivate. You may go back to the lake!"

Li Suikuan, naturally, could not see the Daoist Master before them. He cupped his hands and departed. Li Zhouwei, smiling but saying nothing, used a Heavenly Light to bring the young man to his side. A belated sense of embarrassment washed over Li Suining, and he bowed in salute.

"This junior was ignorant and spoke presumptuously… I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness!"

Li Zhouwei shook his head and led him forward.

"You spoke the truth."

He walked on the air, continuing, "They are not fools, but they can only see so far. It's natural for them to be proud, so long as they don't get carried away…"

This King Wei shook his head again.

"They have no need to worry about these things. Worrying will not change the outcome, so they might as well enjoy it while it lasts."

"Yes…"

Li Suining nodded gently. In an instant, the two arrived at the cave dwelling. Li Zhouwei did not waste words, asking concisely,

"When will the north next stir up trouble?"

Li Suining appeared deeply troubled and spoke in a low voice.

"Had Your Majesty not killed Qi Lanyan… the day would be near. But with Qi Lanyan dead, the north is leaderless. Even the Compassion Dao, which had been making moves, has fallen silent…"

Li Zhouwei listened with his hands clasped behind his back as Li Suining added hesitantly.

"I believe… Your Majesty is simply too terrifying. You shattered what little unity the north possessed. It's possible the era of conflict between north and south will end prematurely. The next attack may very well be initiated by the Great Song!"

Although his cultivation was low, making it difficult to grasp the grand strategic situation, he had witnessed the struggles between north and south, large and small, for two lifetimes. He still had some ability to speculate on the overall trajectory of events.

"Oh?"

A hint of satisfaction colored Li Zhouwei's eyes.

"That is rare and welcome news."

After all, if the Great Song were to launch a northern expedition, he would hold the initiative. The presence of one more or one fewer person on Moongaze Lake was something Li Zhouwei was confident he could manage. If Li Que'wan's immortal foundation had just been formed, he would prefer to let her remain behind to cultivate.

Li Suining quickly added, "This matter is not yet certain… However, there is one person Your Majesty must be wary of."

Li Zhouwei turned to look at him, and Li Suining said with utmost gravity.

"Jiang Yan!"

This was no alarmist fantasy. In his previous life, this man had defended Luoxia, leading his forces to repel the Song army's assaults numerous times. On several occasions, he had single-handedly turned the tide of battle. Later, after retreating to the lands of Jin, he was still able to march south multiple times to help the Zhao court obstruct the Wei army. If not for the utter incompetence of the Buddhist cultivators, the situation would never have deteriorated to such a degree.

He spoke seriously.

"This man should still be in seclusion, healing his wounds and cultivating his spell arts, so he would not normally participate in the conflict between north and south. But once the situation changes, he is the most likely candidate to unite the forces of Luoxia… If Your Majesty intends to attack the north, it is best not to wait more than ten years…"

"Without him, Luoxia is nothing but a tray of loose sand!"

The reason Li Suining could deduce this with such accuracy was that during the battle in his past life where Qi Lanyan had made his comeback, Li Zhouwei had launched a surprise raid into Luo and had not been intercepted by this man. He only learned later that Jiang Yan had been in seclusion attempting a breakthrough to the Purple Mystery realm, and had ultimately failed…

'Qi Lanyan's death won't have a significant impact on his cultivation progress; he will very likely still make the attempt. Even if we attack at a time when he has just failed his breakthrough, taking Luoxia will be much easier!'

He sighed.

"Although Qi Lanyan is dead, and his plans may have changed, being able to strike at that specific time… is always for the best!"

'Ten years… interesting.'

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully, a new plan already forming in his mind as he asked,

"Regarding the matter of the mystic realm, do you have any suggestions?"

Li Suining had been preparing for this moment for a long time. Finally hearing the question, a smile bloomed on his face. He bowed deeply.

"This junior… has a vital secret to offer!"

He turned slightly to the side and raised a sleeve. A multicolored light flashed, and a torrent of jade slips gushed forth from his storage bag. They spun in the air before descending and stacking themselves neatly, nearly filling the entire cave dwelling.

Most of these jade slips were of the clan's standard design. The layers of pure white jade glowed with a gentle, warm light, brightly illuminating the cave dwelling. Even Li Zhouwei was stunned for a moment.

"This is…"

He raised his hand, and the jade slips flew into his sleeve. As his spiritual sense swept over them, a vast ocean of information flooded his mind, causing his expression to tremble.

'The Profound Foundation Construction Method!'

This was not the fundamental law of the fox clan's Great Void Primal-Order Profound-Office Construction Method. Rather, it was an exquisitely detailed, million-word, bespoke method for establishing a Profound Foundation. The spiritual tides, the ebb and flow of the Great Void, and even the paths of the spiritual veins were all meticulously detailed based on the specific conditions of Moongaze Lake!

'It's as if a master cultivator created a version perfectly tailored for Moongaze Lake based on the Great Void Primal-Order Profound-Office Construction Method!'

Its complexity was such that even a Purple Mansion cultivator who specialized in this Dao would likely need to spend decades to complete it!

This caused him to let out a soft sigh of relief. He was momentarily speechless, but Li Suining spoke with a serious tone.

"With this art, Daoist Master Suyun will not need to waste decades, delaying her cultivation!"

That was right… In Li Suining's view, the Li Que'wan of his past life had only possessed three divine abilities at the very end. Besides her battle injuries and family duties, her biggest obstacle had been this mystic realm!

'I was only at the Foundation Establishment Realm back then, so I couldn't grasp the timeline clearly. But based on later estimates, it likely took her twenty years, or even more… Twenty years! Later, she was afflicted by the Wu Earth calamity, and eradicating it took another fifteen years. The two combined were more than enough to make her miss her opportunity to reach the Purple Mystery realm in that critical window of time!'

Li Que'wan and Li Jiangqian had comparable cultivation talent and had broken through at around the same time. Daoist Master Suyun's Dao-Profundity had even been slightly higher. Yet, in the end, one became Great Daoist Master Changli, while the other remained a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator…

From the moment he had awakened from his Heavenly Element trance, Li Suining had worked without rest, transcribing every detail of the Profound Foundation method he remembered from his past life, all to rectify this regret!

The Li Zhouwei before him was also ecstatic. The surprise in his eyes flickered unceasingly. With a sweep of his sleeve, the roomful of white jade slips transformed into pale purple ones, neatly arranged on the desk. Even using materials fit for a Purple Mansion cultivator, it still took ten full slips to transcribe the mountain of information!

He read it from beginning to end, then gave Li Suining a deep look.

"This… is an immense help!"

Li Suining smiled and stood up, just as the stone door creaked open. Light and shadow shifted at the entrance to the cave dwelling as crimson flames billowed. A man in a crimson robe strode into the hall with a smile, bowed slightly, and offered his respects.

"Congratulations, Father!"

His face was handsome, though tinged with a hint of wickedness. His thick, ink-black hair was tied up and secured with a long, golden hairpin, and his eyes were filled with joy.

"Father has expelled the calamity and advanced another step. Your son is truly overjoyed."

Li Zhouwei did not seem surprised. He looked the young man up and down.

"Daoist Master Changli! Your cultivation speed is astonishing. You've already perfected the Great Parting Scripture!"

Li Jiangqian quickly waved his hands, his eyebrows raised in a smile.

"Father, you flatter me. How could I possibly compare to you!"

A hint of a smile touched Li Zhouwei's lips. Deciding not to tease him further, he turned and gestured toward the desk.

"Take a look. Ning'er has rendered a truly great service."
