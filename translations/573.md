# Chapter 887: Condolences

Si Boxiu stood with his hands behind his back, seemingly lost in thought. The late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator said nothing, but Si Yuanli could read his expression. He was already harboring doubts, but a chill of dread surged through his heart.

Could it be...

Just as the chill set in, he noticed a look of amused interest appear on the elder’s face. The old man turned around and spoke, “Li Xuanfeng... though he hadn’t reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he was still a remarkable talent of his time. Yuan Su’s eye for talent has always been accurate.”

The words eased Si Yuanli’s mind. The old man fell into thought again, raising his brow to gaze northward as he mused, What a scheme. That boy Houfu must’ve had a hand in this. The Sword Gate and the aloof Hengzhu shouldn’t be involved... Xiao Chuting wouldn’t have the time either... who else... could it be Changxi? Would he dare?

It no longer mattered whose plan it was. Si Boxiu soon turned and said casually, “I saw Chi Buzi in Anhuai Heaven. He’s already at the late stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. He is cultivating in solitude, and truly the prized tree of the Chi Family.”

The color drained from Si Yuanli’s face. Before he could ask further, Si Boxiu shot him a glance and continued, “He’s focused solely on the path to immortality now. He said he’ll no longer involve himself in Azure Pond Sect matters, and has cut ties with the Chi Family.”

Si Yuanli relaxed instantly, now more confident in his own schemes. Forming a seal and casting a spell, he drew a small cauldron from his sleeve, along with a securely bundled scroll, and said solemnly, “This junior has obtained the item that Daoist Master requested.”

This was, of course, the bronze cauldron from the Great Ning Palace. With the constant battles inside the palace, there’d been no time to refine it. He’d had to flee while lugging it around. Now that he had the chance, he had refined it into a palm-sized cauldron.

Si Boxiu accepted it without fuss, squinting slightly as he said hoarsely, “When I return to the sect, say I’ve entered life-or-death seclusion to heal. Don’t respond to anything from the outside world.”

Si Yuanli understood immediately and nodded, then asked softly, “Ancestor... may I ask about Anhuai Heaven...”

“No need to ask.” Yuan Xiu cut him off and said in a soft voice, “From now on, if any talented youth cultivating True Essence appears under the Azure Pond Sect’s jurisdiction or within the Southern and Eastern seas, report to me immediately.”

“Yes!”

Si Yuanli responded, and at last, Si Boxiu’s gaze fell upon him. His voice softened slightly as he said, “You’re more sensible than those other uncles and cousins. From you downwards, Tongyi and Tongwen are all capable. In the past, I had to carry the burden alone, but now our Si Family should rise again. We can finally stretch our arms and legs.”

Si Yuanli understood what he meant, but one matter still weighed on his heart. Taking advantage of the elder’s good mood, he spoke softly, “It’s just that our family still has too few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of our own blood. I wonder if there’s any chance of bringing my elder brother back...”

The moment he mentioned his elder brother Si Yuanbai, Si Boxiu’s expression darkened, anger flashing across his face as he said coldly, “Him? He’s hopelessly rigid and soft-hearted, utterly blind to the situation. He listens too easily to others; if you bring him back, he’ll just oppose everything! Better to let him wander freely.”

“Please calm your anger, Daoist Master...”

“Calm down?” Si Boxiu’s face grew even darker, and he growled, “Where did he get the guts to reprimand Chi Wei in front of all the Daoist Masters? That rabid dog was desperate to extend his life, his eyes glowing green with greed, and even Yuan Su stepped aside for him! But your brother ran straight to Azure Pond Peak to hurl insults!

“If I hadn’t acted first and suppressed him beneath the tower, Chi Wei, who’s nearing the end of his lifespan, would’ve lashed out, disregarding my face and the younger generation. As it is, not even his bones can be found!”

Si Yuanli could only sigh. Si Boxiu glanced at him, then gradually eased his tone. “The Moon Glazed Tree grows on Azure Pond Peak. It's a spirit item that can assist in breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm. If you get the chance, take note of it... as for Chi Zhiyun, ignore him. If he breaks through too early, I’ll handle it.”

Break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!

Those words struck Si Yuanli like thunder. The allure of Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities was immense. A rush of heat surged to his head, as he struggled to believe what he’d heard.

Si Boxiu paid no further attention to what the junior might do next. With a flick of his sleeve, he sent him back to the mortal world, then continued drifting through the sky, lost in thought, Yuanli’s ruthless move suits the situation. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are all of one mind. Li Xuanfeng has already been used thoroughly. He protected Jiangnan and died at the right time. No need for me to intervene.

The younger generation is stirring up storms, so this is the perfect moment... as for Chi Zhiyun...

Si Boxiu let out a cold chuckle and said quietly, “The boy fears Buzi and is too impatient. Soon, Zipei will break through, and a dragon kin will swallow thunder... Heaven and earth’s spiritual aura shifts every decade. Mount Azure Pond is only five hundred kilometers from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. You want to break through to Purple Mansion Realm and attain Fire Virtue divine abilities? Then waste decade after decade trying in vain!”

The old man put away the talisman in his hand, his figure gradually fading into the great void, leaving behind only a faint murmur in the air. “Mount Changhuai dispatched several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to protect this Metallic Essence... there must be a scheme brewing. The immortal system of Wu State differs from Yue State. Four sects, nine esteemed families, and Mount Changhuai stands above them all. This makes it far easier to act as they please...”

Moongaze Lake.

The mourning rites lasted three days. Li Xuanfeng's storage pouch lay quietly on the table. Everyone, having busied themselves with the funeral, finally sat down together.

Li Xuanxuan only woke up after two days of drunken stupor. The Wanglin Blossom, brewed to prolong life and ease sorrow, had been specially prepared for him by Li Xuanfeng. Only with it had he been able to drink so freely. Its effects still lingered, leaving the old man somewhat dazed.

Li Xijun took the registry in hand, its pages densely packed with names. After reading it carefully, he sighed inwardly.

The Li Family had contributed more than any other in this struggle between north and south. From the chaos at Chengshui Tomb, the crushing defeat at Mount Yan Pass, to the battle at the riverbank, they had given everything, suffering grave losses.

The disasters at Chengshui Tomb and Mount Yan Pass had been completely unforeseen. All cultivators below Foundation Establishment Realm perished at Chengshui Tomb, while barely one in ten survived at Mount Yan Pass. As for the riverbank battle, fought just behind Moongaze Lake, the Li Family fought with the utmost valor and self-sacrifice.

Though most of their Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had survived, the prominent families, guest cultivators, and especially the Radiant Lure generation of the Li Family suffered unprecedented losses. White mourning cloths hung at every household.
𝐟𝚛𝕖𝚎𝕨𝗲𝐛𝚗𝐨𝐯𝐞𝕝.𝐜𝗼𝗺

Many skilled guest cultivators of the Li Family had headed north. Chen Donghe had been wounded in the riverbank battle, though not seriously. An Zheyan had lost an eye. Only Li Wen and Tian Zhongqing remained; nearly everyone else who went north perished.

The Radiant Lure generation was nearly wiped out. Only Li Minggong had made it back alive from Mount Yan Pass. Li Chengliao and Li Chenghuai had been defending the riverbank. Li Chenghui had been in the Eastern Sea. Lastly, there was also Li Chengdan, whose cultivation was lacking. Only these few remained out of the dozen Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators before.

Li Xijun looked through the list again, his heart heavy. When he looked up at Li Qinghong, he saw that she had already reviewed the registry. Seated at the head, her mood was clearly grim as well.

The restriction on Li Xuanfeng’s storage pouch had long been removed. Li Qinghong picked it up and looked toward Li Xuanxuan. The old man shook his head, so she could only rise and speak gently, “In accordance with the elder’s will, all belongings shall be confiscated.”

She opened the storage pouch and poured its contents out with a rustle. Clearly, Li Xuanfeng had made thorough preparations before heading north. Much of his wealth had already been left to Li Yuanqin. The items now laid out mostly came from the Great Ning Palace. They were brilliant, dazzling, and varied, but possessed a weathered, ancient aura.

Li Qinghong swept her spiritual sense across the table, immediately counting everything, and briefly froze.

Seventeen Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts, eleven Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items, four treasured panaceas, and seventy-five Qi Cultivation Realm spirit items!

There were plenty of spirit items, though none at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. After fighting his way through the Great Ning Palace, Li Xuanfeng’s collection of Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items alone far exceeded the Li Family’s reserves.

The Li Family had operated by the lake for over a century. Their stores were naturally full of Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit items and many Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts. But Foundation Establishment spirit items and treasured panaceas were rare, and they usually had fewer than fifty types of Qi Cultivation spirit items.

Setting aside the armor prepared for Li Zhouwei and various miscellaneous items, several objects placed at the center immediately drew everyone’s attention.

From left to right, they were a stack of golden talismans, a letter, an incense burner, a screen the length of an arm, and a drop of mercury.

Li Qinghong examined them closely. The golden talismans and the mercury drop were inscrutable in depth. The incense burner was a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact crafted with ancient techniques. It had not yet been refined and glowed a dull red; the base bore the seal character Sima.

She picked up the letter first and unfolded it. The letter was written on a kind of spiritual fabric, carelessly folded and pressed under the incense burner for who knows how many years. Deep impressions of the burner’s base remained.

The script danced across the page like dragons and was written in ancient seal characters, Chen Xuanli and Chen Xuanxiang have gone south into Yue and founded a sect called Lingyu Gate. The King of Yue holds them in high regard; they are not easy to deal with. Your esteemed family has long guarded the riverbank and must remain vigilant... The True Monarch has not responded in years; caution must come first in all matters.

The letter appeared to be from a cultivator of Ning State, addressed to the Sima Family. It was an old matter regarding Lingyu Gate. Li Qinghong read it carefully and thought to herself, So the Chen family of Lingyu Gate truly did migrate from Ning State. No wonder they gave their full support in the siege against Daoist Master Donghua. It was likely for the sake of the Ning's Li lineage.

The King of Yue held them in high regard... but the Chen Family is now destroyed, and the Yang Family is thin in numbers. Who knows when that old ancestor will achieve a breakthrough.

She passed the letter along for others to read and picked up the screen. It, too, had not been refined with mana and was now only the length of an arm. The painting on its surface was indistinct, and it lay quietly in her palm. The screen was also a dharma artifact made with ancient techniques.

But the screen had a mysterious luster, and Li Xuanfeng had placed it carefully in a corner. Clearly it was no ordinary item, and Li Qinghong gave it a few extra glances.

Both of these ancient dharma artifacts were extraordinary. Just refining them would take several months, so their full potential couldn’t be seen for now. Just as Li Qinghong was about to speak, an old man transformed from a white ape descended into the hall.

He spoke in a buzzing voice, “Message from the riverbank, the northern cultivators have retreated. The Azure Pond Sect's immortal envoy has reached the northern shore and is heading straight for Qingdu.”

Li Xizhi nodded and added aloud, “I’ve also received word. Mount Bianyan suffered a devastating defeat. They say the grand formation was breached, and everyone scattered. But eight or nine out of ten likely won’t survive.”

As the master of Azure Pond Peak, Li Xizhi was better informed. The others exchanged glances. Li Xijun lifted his head thoughtfully and said in a low voice, “If the carnage reached this level, there must be Purple Mansion Realm cultivator scheming involved. Great uncle predicted it well, the Chi Family’s bloated influence is now plain to see.”

Li Qinghong had personally taken part in the matter and knew the truth best of all. She even knew that Daoist Master Changxi of Profound Peak Gate had played a part. But such things were not for open discussion, so she only nodded slightly. Li Xijun followed suit, and the group rode the wind out of the grand formation together.

Li Xizhi still looked a bit downcast. The aunts and nieces were all dressed in white. A faint glow of white spirit boats appeared in the distance. Though they couldn’t compare to the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner, they were still decent immortal vessels.
𝕗𝗿𝕖𝐞𝐰𝗲𝕓𝐧𝕠𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝐨𝚖

It was rather ironic as the Dawn Cloudliner was a rare and extravagant weapon. But since the north-south conflict involved powerful cultivators, Chi Zhiyan was reluctant to use it. As a result, the Azure Pond Sect only used the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner to transport personnel, and the immortal vessel was still docked at Azure Pond Peak.

Si Yuanli’s presence was visibly diminished without the Dawn Cloudliner. Gone was the typical grandeur of the Azure Pond Sect, where the heavenly glow would arrive before the immortals themselves. The white cloud boat drifted in from afar and was only noticed when it reached the lake.

But Si Yuanli didn’t care. He sat in the cabin, somewhat lost in thought, still shaken by what he had learned, Purple Mansion... So the Moon Glazed Tree is a spirit item that helps one break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!

The Azure Pond Sect had many ways to assist breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. There was the Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill, Tonghua Powder, Essence Gathering Pill, and more.

Most were used by the direct descendants of the Chi, Si, Ning, and Tang Families. The Essence Gathering Pill was especially precious. Just swallowing it gave a five percent success rate, and if one refined an Immortal Foundation or a Foundation Establishment Realm demonic beast, the chances multiplied. If the Immortal Foundation even matched the user’s cultivation method, the success rate could rise to forty or fifty percent!

However, as a descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm lineage, Si Yuanli knew that ways to aid in breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm were rare. Pills? Somehow, after the cataclysms, all pills meant to assist in Purple Mansion Realm breakthroughs had lost effectiveness. Only a handful of pills developed post-cataclysm were useful, and they were exceedingly rare.

The only options left were cultivation methods and secret arts. The Si Family’s Wesang Scripture was a Purple Mansion Realm technique of the rare Wood Virtue lineage. Passed down through generations, it contained four secret arts. Mastering them could increase one’s breakthrough chances by twenty percent. It was an extremely rare advantage.

“Ning Wan’s cultivation method only has one secret art... even the Chi Family’s murky and weighty Dark Floating Compliant Cloud Sutra only contains four.”

These secret arts were painstakingly developed by their predecessors and weren’t necessarily tied to the grade of the technique. It largely depended on the prestige of one's ancestors. As such, the Si Family’s long-standing heritage gave them an edge over the Ning Family.

As for using spirit items to assist in Purple Mansion Realm breakthroughs, the process was mysterious and unreliable. Truthfully, most Purple Mansion Realm cultivators succeeded through sheer risk and resolve. But now, with this fruit in reach, how could his heart not pound with desire?

“My lord... we’ve arrived at Mount Qingdu!”

Si Yuanli was pulled back to reality. He adjusted his robes and rose, lifting the jade curtain of the cabin. His gaze had already sharpened, and was completely different from before.

Taking control of the Azure Pond Sect wasn’t just a matter for the Si Family, it was Si Yuanli’s own chance at the Purple Mansion Realm! Never had his resolve been so ironclad. He brushed the curtain aside, his face now sorrowful and eyes reddened as he stepped out to greet them.

Li Qinghong was personally waiting by the lake. Si Yuanli quickly saw that all the Li Family’s Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had arrived, showing him due respect. Si Yuanli truly felt some grief and regret over Li Xuanfeng’s death; there was no need for him to feign emotion. His expression was naturally sincere.

Brother Xuanfeng fought to the end to protect the millions of Jiangnan... It is a deep and sorrowful loss... thought Si Yuanli.

Si Yuanli landed on the peak and first glanced at Li Ximing. Though the man had abundant mana, there was nothing exceptional about him. His focus shifted to the graceful and poised Li Xizhi, quietly assessing, This one has the backing of both the Yang and Li Families, with deep cultivation and clear judgment. Chi Zhiyun favored him heavily back then, and I saw through it early on... Fortunately, Chi Zhiyan has already exhausted himself with foolish blunders.
