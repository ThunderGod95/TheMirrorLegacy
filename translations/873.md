# Chapter 873: The Real and Fake Abyssal Medallion

Li Ximing had only just halted in mid-air when a flurry of rain and snow began to fall. Ning Wan, robed in white, materialized beside him. Her willow-like brows were knitted in worry. She bowed to Li Ximing and said softly, "Daoist Friend Zhaojing... it is the Great One, establishing his immortal foundation... Judging by this celestial phenomenon, it is 'Blazing Fire'."

Li Ximing now understood her concern. Mount Luoxia must have influenced the Great Ancestor to *not* cultivate 'Bright Yang'. If he mastered his own innate divine power, Luoxia probably wouldn't be able to suppress him, even with a thousand methods.

'Back then, 'Chu Yi' was closer to cultivating 'Radiant Fire'. Now, he cultivates 'Blazing Fire'. Although it's of the fire attribute, it's not as compatible as Radiant Fire. It's a standard, conventional choice... they've successfully led him astray...'

The two Daoist Masters watched from afar. As the shout from Jiangbei echoed through the air, several figures shot up from below, radiating killing intent. The leader was a burly man with a vicious expression, wielding a large, jet-black hammer. He roared, "You, surnamed Lin! What colossal nerve! We are of the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition! How dare you be so arrogant! If our Hall Master weren't in closed-door cultivation, do you think you'd have succeeded?!"

With Daoist Bai of the Hall of the Locust Soul dead, no one below knew if the so-called "favors" owed by the various Purple Mansion Realm Daoist traditions still counted. These men were terrified but already in too deep. They were trapped; they didn't dare abandon their territory, nor did they dare let the news leak. They all kept it a tightly guarded secret, putting on a false front.

Li Ximing and the others, of course, knew the truth and watched the performance with cold detachment.

Nearby, the flames enveloping Lin Feng finally receded, revealing his appearance. He wore pale white armor that shimmered with hazy colors, a longsword in his hand. Two flames, one pale white and one light red, spiraled around his body, giving him an imposing, majestic aura.

Li Ximing didn't look closely, listening to the voice that boomed through the sky:
"Ridiculous! A gathering of demonic cultivators dares to call itself an inheritor of the Immortal Dao's Daoist tradition? If not for that charlatan Bai, would you lot have the chance to be so impudent!"

He sneered.

"Why don't you show everyone the [Abyssal Gloom Medallion], good sir? That would surely convince us!"

He spoke with absolute confidence. The surrounding crowd was unbothered, assuming it was just a taunt. But the two Daoist Masters on the horizon both froze. They exchanged a look, seeing the helplessness in each other's eyes.
'It seems it really did fall into the Great One's hands!'

The burly man from Jiangbei instantly fell silent. He raised his twin hammers, activated his immortal foundation, and struck with sudden violence!

Although his opponent was a high-level cultivator at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, the youth showed no fear. He raised his longsword, aiming straight for the man's face, and stated coldly, "Pathetic tricks!"

A surge of pale red flame soared into the sky. They clashed several times in just a few breaths. The young man's defiant voice echoed across the heavens:

"If you won't act now, when will you!"

In response, several beams of light erupted from within the ranks of the demonic cultivators below. They struck their own supposed comrades, scattering the black energy and revealing surges of white light. The scene descended into absolute chaos.

"Wu Gui, Tian Fu... you... you traitors!"

"The Song family! You... how dare you side with this bastard while the Capital immortals Dao is occupied!"

Lin Feng stood proudly. As expected, a woman rode the wind to land beside him, wrapping her arm around his. Her eyes were filled with adoration. She smiled, "You brat... you really reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

This woman was none other than Song Yunbai of the Capital immortals Dao, who had been missing and presumed injured for a long time!

"Hahahaha!"

The young man stood with his sword held horizontally, the roaring flames burning the enemy's black qi to cinders. He slowly raised his other hand, palm up, releasing an intense, swirling black and white light.

He was holding an intricately patterned, profound medallion. It pulsed with waves of black and white radiance, so bright it eclipsed the flames in the sky. The crowd of cultivators that had gathered below stared, dumbfounded. A collective, shocked cry rose up:

"[Abyssal Gloom Medallion]!"

This sight made every demonic cultivator on the field freeze. They instinctively scattered. The burly man was even more flustered, roaring, "That's a fake!"

He grit his teeth and finally pulled a medallion from his own sleeve. A brilliant light burst forth, black and white colors swirling together once more. It was another [Abyssal Gloom Medallion]!

"The Great One sees me as his confidant! He entrusted this to me before entering seclusion! All cultivators of the Hall, listen to my command! Surround and kill this man!"

The light from the two medallions clashed in the air. The one in the burly man's hand was more resplendent, its shimmering glow overshadowing the other. In contrast, Lin Feng's medallion looked mottled and damaged, lacking the same grandeur.

Furthermore, the one the man held had most likely come from Daoist Bai, who had been acknowledged by the various great families. Naturally, it held more credibility. The battlefield instantly dissolved into confused chaos. The few who had been turned by Lin Feng quickly gathered around him, forming a protective circle.

Li Ximing watched in silence. Ning Wan sighed softly.

"The Great One is truly formidable... He actually obtained it."

Li Ximing prompted her, and Ning Wan explained in a gentle voice:

"This Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition... does indeed have a profound medallion. We had only seen images of it in ancient books. This one," (the fake) "was commissioned by Sister Tinglan from a friend. Although it matches the descriptions perfectly and uses many elements from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition... well, it's ultimately not the genuine article."

"The original plan was... the Great One's innate status is exceptionally high. Even if the item in his hand was fake, with the blessing of fate, we thought he could at least uncover clues and find a way in, even if he couldn't fool the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition..."

"Who would have thought... whether the original medallion fell from the Great Void long ago, or someone delivered it to the Great One, it seems he's had it ever since he was in the Qi Refining realm..."

Li Ximing nodded. The ancient, original medallion wasn't created to be dazzling, so it naturally wouldn't look as impressive as the contemporary one Tinglan had forged to deceive people. A sliver of hope rose in his heart. "Then, this Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition..."

Ning Wan's voice was tinged with regret.

"It will be very difficult to control the situation now... We cannot influence the subsequent changes in the Secret Diffusion inheritance. We can only watch for now. It shouldn't spread to the south."

Ning Wan didn't have strong feelings about the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition, but Li Ximing, who had seen the mirror fragment in the grotto-heaven, was extremely reluctant to miss this opportunity. Yet, knowing what he knew about the north, he didn't dare act rashly or reveal his thoughts. He could only nod slightly and say impassively, "That would be best."

As they spoke, the great battle in Jiangbei intensified. Li Ximing's brows furrowed as he watched the spiritual qi surge across the sky. After a while, a vast plume of black qi billowed into the heavens, a clear sign that someone had fallen.

Soon, the red light retreated, fleeing westward. The cultivators from the Hall of the Locust Soul were in a state of panic. They actually stopped to rest where they were, not giving chase, allowing the group to retreat in full view.

Ning Wan gazed into the distance and let out a long breath.

"Fortunately, the Great One has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. Unlike the Qi Refining realm, he can't just disperse his cultivation and start over. And now that he has cultivated the 'Blazing Fire' Dao, he has received its divine essence and is set upon that corresponding path of power. He is no longer as terrifying as before."

"His fate is still strong, and no one can stand against him, but he no longer possesses that divine ability to seize a Fruition Attainment from afar and overturn the world with a single thought."

This was valuable information. Li Ximing listened intently, pondering.
'Could it be that because he forged a Blazing Fire Dao foundation, he has deviated from the path of Bright Yang, and that's why this change occurred? Otherwise... given how he could seize a person's spiritual soul with a single glance before... who would ever dare approach him?'

But more important than this news was Luoxia's attitude in the north. Li Ximing felt a deep unease.

"Still... now that the Great One has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, I fear he will come to my lake to pick up Fei Qingya. Are you aware of this, Daoist Friend? We must also inform Xiukui."

No matter how much Li Ximing coveted that Secret Diffusion fragment, he understood that the True Monarch coming south was a perilous event. If it wasn't handled perfectly, it could lead his own clan to eternal damnation.

Li Ximing raised his sleeves and bowed.

"I may need to make a trip to the Southern Borderlands. What are the arrangements from Daoist Master Qiuhu... Is there anything I can do..."

Ning Wan nodded. She hesitated a moment before finally asking, "The Southern Sea has been restless lately. If you have the time, Daoist Friend, I was hoping you could go in my stead..."

"I remember." Li Ximing nodded repeatedly. "Senior Kui Qi mentioned it some days ago. You mean the Great Konghai Temple at Shitang in the Southern Sea, and that Baoqing Maha. I have kept it in mind..."

The Profound Light between his brows flashed. He suddenly added, "He has a subordinate, that Merciful One named Zhuzhen... He even attacked my elder brother."

Zhuzhen was not a formidable figure. Ning Wan wasn't trying to sow discord, only to warn Li Ximing against a potential ambush. She said tactfully, "Zhuzhen is actually afraid of you, so he secretly held back. It ended up enhancing Li Xizhi's reputation."

"That's not a good thing. There's no reputation to be 'enhanced.' A tall tree attracts the wind. Worse, it's a reputation built upon the Buddhist cultivators, and they also say our family is descended from Wei and Li. That karmic connection has been forged. Who knows what variables it will bring in the future!"

Li Ximing shook his head, a faint, cold smile on his face.

"But it's good that he was afraid. If something had actually happened, I would not be having this conversation with this attitude today."

The smile was faint, but the killing intent within it was anything but.

Who was Li Xizhi? Of the 'Four Xi' siblings, only Li Ximing and Li Xizhi remained. Li Ximing had been held in this brother's arms since he was a child. Although they had been separated for many years, and their bond wasn't as deep as with Li Xijun, whom he grew up with, it was not to be underestimated...

The matter with Li Xijun was not a righteous one. When Xiao Chuting came to ask personally, Li Ximing had given his answer, and he could only bury his hatred for Crimson Reef Island in his heart. Now, another offense was added to the tally. If Zhuzhen had killed Li Xizhi, he would have forged a blood feud with both Azure Pond and the Li clan... And Baoqing did not have the divine powers of the original Great Konghai Temple master to protect him!

Ning Wan nodded. "If you go to the Southern Borderlands, Daoist Friend, you could meet with Daoist Friends Zhusheng and Xian Chan. They are, after all, contacts left by Senior Yuanxiu, and they also have a poor relationship with the Great Konghai Temple."

"Good."

Li Ximing stood with his hands behind his back, appearing unbothered, but he sighed inwardly.

He understood. From the moment Kui Qi had sought him out, the subsequent arrangements were already set. Whether the matter with Azure Pond in the Southern Sea was urgent was secondary; the key was to send himthis Wei-Li descendant and Bright Yang cultivatoraway.

The various houses had no idea how much control Luoxia truly had over this Great Ancestor. Perhaps Luoxia held the Li clan in utter contempt. Perhaps Luoxia cared for no one except Li Zhouwei. Perhaps if Li Ximing stated his case to Lin Feng's face, he would explode into a cloud of gore before he even finished speaking... But the Li family served at least one obvious purpose: to see who was harboring thoughts about the Great Ancestor.

Clearly, Luoxia's prestige throughout the north, and even the entire mainland, remained at a terrifying level. For now, only the Dragon-kin had made a move. And even though the relationship between Luoxia and the Dragon-kin had never been good, they were still forced to hide and scheme in the Eastern Sea.

Li Ximing, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and even the Golden Feather Sect, could not afford to take such a risk.

As his thoughts reached this point, Li Ximing's understanding crystallized.

'I'm afraid that even without this business with the Northern Buddhists, I would have to return to Jiangnan right now. During the time the True Monarch is visiting the lake, whether I'm a guest at Purple Smoke or staying at Tiger's Frontier, I must be under their watch!'

'Although the True Monarch is just coming to the lake to pick up a woman, and his impression of my family is already good, and his capacity for harming the innocent has lessened since reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm... there is always a 'what if'. What if something goes wrong?'

'If the True Monarch becomes displeased and does something at Moongaze Lake, they must also restrain me immediately, to prevent me from losing my head and rushing to the rescue... That would only cause a disaster and interfere with the plans on both sides...'

'The arrangements the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition has made these past few days, the benefits they've given me, both overt and subtle... a large part of it is probably in hopes that I will follow their plan and not stir up trouble... If I make things ugly for everyone, it will also mean a loss of combat strength for Jiangnan.'

Li Ximing, from before and after his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, had experienced far too much. He was no longer the same person he was back then. He raised his hand slightly.

"I must still make arrangements for my clan. I will depart in the morning!"

Ning Wan was relatively at ease with him. She nodded and watched him leave, then turned her gaze back toward Jiangbei.

"He broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm so casually, without any fuss... It seems it will be very difficult to get a piece of that Secret Diffusion secret cache... I had best see if there are any promising young cultivators instead!"

...

The lake's surface was dazzling. The first thing that caught the eye was the purple-gold profound pillar, radiating a solemn and dignified aura. A bit further off, the Viewing Pavilion Platform projected a pillar of golden-red light into the sky, casting a golden reflection on the water.

Li Ximing pondered as he descended, passing through his clan's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Great Array. Beneath the tallest profound pillar, a hazy purple light marked the inner array.

The inner array originally had buildings, but they were all ruins. Li Ximing had been in a rush to set up the array and hadn't set foot inside. He had spent the last few days dealing with the spirit embryo. After finally getting a moment of peace, he had rushed to Zongquan Island to see Li Zhouwei. This was the first chance he'd had to fly inside.

Passing through the hazy purple light, he saw a stretch of pale yellow, glossy ground, smooth as glazed glass and covered in shallow purple patterns. It was clearly a transformation wrought by the great array's dharma power. Looking up, he saw it was a circular area, no more than a *li* across.

'The spiritual qi is quite good. Since the great array was established, the spiritual qi on the Island is slowly rising, and there's no sign of it stopping. Inside the inner array, it has already reached the level of Gardenia Scenery Mountain... It's enough for Purple Mansion Realm cultivation...'

The area was not small. The Li family's palaces had never been grand; the main hall for handling affairs was only three hundred-some feet wide. This was more than enough space to erect many buildings.

For now, the ground was flat and empty, the ruins clearly having been carted away. All one could see was the yellow, glazed-glass-like ground and the hazy purple canopy of the array. A few cultivators, all at the Qi Refining realm, were busy constructing halls and pavilions. He swept his gaze over them and, as expected, saw Li Jiangqian standing with his hands behind his back. When Li Jiangqian saw Li Ximing, his face first lit up with joy, then revealed a trace of worry. He bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master! The north..."

Li Ximing and the other Daoist Masters had been high in the sky, using their powers to perceive the news from the north. But the battle had just concluded; his family here was clearly unaware. He first scanned with his Immortal Mirror. No one else was spying from the Great Void. Only then did he say with a serious expression:

"Jiangqian, you should have the arrangements in place. Not a single person from our family's direct line on the north shore is to go. Just let him take her. As for the matter of the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture... it was just a passing mention. If it happens, it happens."

"The Great One has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm and will be here soon. Send someone to prepare immediately!"
