# Chapter 891: The Heaven Where Sun and Moon Shine as One

Li Ximing lowered his gaze to the token, his pupils widening. He studied it for a long, heavy moment, his heart suspended over a deep abyss, feet dangling, utterly at a loss for words.

'There seems to be no Great Void here... and I can't ride the wind. There must be a restriction... My spiritual sense is also suppressed, limited to my immediate surroundings. I fear there's an extremely terrifying array in place.'

He closed his eyes and first prayed to the Immortal Mirror. After reciting the incantation, he received no response. This only strengthened his suspicion. He dared not move, nor did he dare to leave. He hesitated for a long while before taking a step back and bowing respectfully. Only then did he reach out to take the token.

The token was ice-cold in his hand, its surface smooth and delicate. It was impervious to divine abilities and impenetrable to spiritual sense, just like every fragment of the Immortal Mirror from the past century—and the Immortal Mirror itself. It felt like a common, mortal thing.

Li Ximing held the object, but no strange phenomenon occurred. He carefully cupped it in his hands, turned, and walked to a jade desk within the pavilion. After a moment's thought, he finally picked up the jade bottle to examine it.

The jade bottle's design was unlike those common in Jiangnan. Its neck was slightly elongated, and it lacked any sort of stopper or lid. The body of the bottle was a pure, clean white, faintly inscribed with several vertical lines.

His spiritual sense, naturally, could not penetrate it. He could only set the bottle upright and peer in from the top. Inside, layer upon layer of mist swirled, sinking and floating, suffused with a vivid, hazy-blue color.

Li Ximing focused, sensing it carefully, and was surprised to detect a trace of familiarity. He closed his eyes slightly, a jolt passing through his heart.

"Talisman Qi..."

Although he had never seen it in this form, the feeling was intensely familiar. Li Ximing hesitated for only an instant. The various incantations of the Sacrificial Method flooded his mind, followed immediately by an electrifying jolt, a realization that struck like thunder.

'A Purple Mansion Realm Azure Talisman!'

Li Ximing had considered this possibility long ago, but Purple Mansion Realm Demon beasts were incredibly difficult to find. To this day, the Li family had only encountered that one white elephant, and it was treacherous and cunning. They had yet to find a single Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast that was an easy target.

'With this, could Li Zhouwei's Talisman Qi problem finally be solved?!'

Although Li Ximing himself had received his talisman before reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, he had since experienced the agonizingly slow pace of cultivating divine abilities at this new stage. He had long grown nostalgic for his Foundation Establishment Realm days, when a single strand of Talisman Qi could boost him an entire layer. He couldn't use this, but Li Zhouwei was currently in seclusion, breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm. This Azure Talisman could finally turn their theoretical plans into reality!

With the bottle right in front of him, he could only suck in a sharp, excited breath, his hands nearly starting to tremble. He observed it minutely, terrified he might somehow taint the spiritual object just by holding it, and quickly placed it back on the desk.

His gaze-reluctantly pulled away from the porcelain-white bottle. Only then did he turn to the purple-black, sandalwood-like wooden slips. He gently opened them. They were completely empty, revealing only a smooth, blank surface.

Li Ximing quickly set the slips down. After careful consideration, he picked up only the token. Growing bolder, he began to search the pavilion, opening every long cabinet, small chest, and ornate box, leaving no corner unexamined.

However, he found nothing. He did find one small coffer at the bottom of a cabinet, which contained a half-full set of five bottles filled with an unused, pale greenish-white gas. He didn't know what it was, but when Li Ximing probed it with his spiritual sense, he determined it was some form of Spiritual Qi, not a cultivation resource.

He carefully put the coffer back. After circling the room one last time, he returned to the white jade lampstand, studying its cold, moon-like radiance. He hesitated for a moment, but ultimately didn't dare lift the lampshade to see what kind of oil fueled it. Feigning casualness, he strode past it and arrived at the pavilion door.

Through the crack in the door, he could see a long, covered corridor beyond the courtyard. It was lined with six white jade lamp pillars, each emitting that same cold radiance. The far end of the corridor split into two paths, both vanishing into overlapping banks of clouds and mist.

"Creeaak."

Li Ximing pushed the door open and stepped out. The movement swept aside the mist near the doorway, revealing gray stone steps. In the silent immortal palace, the sound of the door echoed, reverberating through the mist before finally dissipating into the dense, folding clouds.

'It's so quiet.'

"Tap."

He took a step down, his gaze sweeping low over the gray stone. He noticed barely perceptible array patterns etched into the steps. They were dim and lightless, and he couldn't tell if they were active, though a faint white light pulsed within them.

The sound of his footsteps echoed. The corridor was not particularly long. As he walked, another pavilion emerged from the mist. It was similar in design to the first but taller, perhaps three stories high, with sharp, high-peaked eaves. A plaque hung above the entrance, bearing two characters:

High Firmament

Li Ximing pushed the door open and entered. The first floor was completely empty, save for a white jade lamp in each of the four corners and a single stone pedestal in the center.

The pedestal was no higher than his waist. It was carved with images of the Supreme Yin, a setting moon, and patterns of undulating clouds. A rectangular socket was recessed into its center, glowing with a soft, clear light in the dim pavilion.

A staircase at the side led to the second floor. Li Ximing ascended, his mind heavy with thought.

A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's eyesight was sharp. He could easily see traces of restrictive arrays on the staircase leading to the second floor, but for some unknown reason, they were inactive, lying dormant.

The second floor was nearly identical to the one below, only slightly smaller. It also had an open window, which let in a little more light. Li Ximing gave it a cursory glance and continued upward.

The highest floor was smaller still. The light from the four lamps crisscrossed in the space. In the center, there was no pedestal; instead, a blue-green jade meditation cushion rested on the floor. In front of it sat a square bronze incense burner, containing a shallow layer of old ash.

As soon as he arrived, the token in Li Ximing's hand began to glow faintly, as if it had finally found what it was looking for.

Li Ximing hurried forward. The surface of the blue-green jade cushion was covered in densely packed, minuscule characters that looked like a decorative pattern from afar. Although the script was ancient, the moment his spiritual sense touched it, the meaning flooded his mind.

*The Art of the Talisman Grotto and Immortality*

Immediately, the contents of the cultivation method surged into his mind. The very first section was the Dharma Art he had read so long ago:

The Initiation Method.

This Dharma Art, used to seek a Talisman Seed, flashed by in an instant. It was naturally followed by the art used to seek Talisman Qi: the Sacrificial Method.

As this Dharma Art swept past his mind's eye, a third and final part unexpectedly emerged:

The Ascension Method!

This spell art was unlike anything Li Ximing had ever seen. It primarily described how to use this very jade cushion to elevate one's Talisman Seed, "open the Profound Radiance," and ascend to the heavens. Once there, one had to report one's duties and be judged on merits at scheduled times, all in pursuit of the Dao...

'Talisman Seed... This is undoubtedly the art bestowed by the Immortal Mirror!'

Li Ximing had only scanned it for a moment, but he understood from the spell art's description that its cultivator must not only possess a Talisman Seed, but must also first "Inscribe the Profound Register and Ascend the True Name." Only then could one "open the Profound Radiance" and travel to the "heavens" as a soul to make contact with the various wondrous and ineffable Great Daos.

Li Ximing was extremely familiar with this requirement. He himself had "Inscribed the Profound Register and Ascended his True Name" before even coming here. This meant he was currently capable of using the final technique of *The Art of the Talisman Grotto and Immortality*—the Ascension Method.

'The immortal art inheritance that my family has relied on to rise... it must have originated from this very place!'

He immediately dropped to his knees and kowtowed deeply before the cushion, performing the rites due to a master. He held the bow for a long time before finally rising.

He had been hit with too much information at once. He took a moment to steady his mind, then turned his complicated gaze to the incense burner. On the side of the square bronze vessel, a few small characters were engraved:

'Secret Vault Profound Seven Pavilion of the Saintly Purity Palace'

Li Ximing began to ponder.

'This place should be the High Firmament Pavilion. I wonder what its relationship is to the Secret Vault Profound Seven Pavilion of the Saintly Purity Palace. Or perhaps this incense burner simply came from there... It's likely related to the 'heavens' this art speaks of...'

Li Ximing studied the burner for a moment, a connection forming in his mind. As if struck by a realization, he descended to the first floor of the High Firmament Pavilion, pushed open the door, and stepped out. He returned a moment later, this time holding the purple-black wooden slips.

He unrolled the slips. They formed a perfect rectangle. He held them up, comparing their shape to the socket, and nodded to himself. He placed the wooden codex into the recess on the pedestal. It was a perfect fit, seamless.

The pedestal and the slips, both of which had felt like mortal objects, finally changed. The instant his spiritual sense touched them, a torrent of information streamed into him. Li Ximing closed his eyes as a veritable ocean of scriptures flooded his mind.

'*Song of Cleansing Snow*, *Floating Cloud Heart Sutra*, *Profound Geng Sword Art*... *Cang River Source-Seeking Art*, *Pheasant Fire Endurance Art*...'

Li Ximing's eyes snapped open in realization.

"These are all Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation methods!"

An innumerable, truly shocking number of cultivation methods flashed through his mind. Li Ximing reviewed them all and noticed a detail.

"These names are either bright or dim... It seems there's a difference."

He experimented, first focusing his intent on a dim title, the *Song of Cleansing Snow*. As expected, nothing happened. He then shifted his focus to a shining one, the *Profound Geng Sword Art*.

Immediately, bright golden characters materialized on the wooden slips embedded in the pedestal. The core tenets of the sword art appeared, flowing across the surface like liquid light.

Li Ximing didn't dare waste time reading it. His heart thumping with excitement, he immediately retrieved the slips, bounded up the stairs to the second-floor pedestal, and embedded the purple-black codex into its socket. He plunged his spiritual sense into it.

"Bzzz!"

An equally vast number of cultivation methods surged forth, but far fewer of them were illuminated. Almost instantly, Li Ximing spotted the very art he himself cultivated: the *Radiant Essence Scripture*!

"It really did come from here! The immortal arts, the cultivation methods... all of them originate from this High Firmament Pavilion!"

Appearing alongside it were Li Jiangqian's *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun* and Li Que'wan's *Golden Book of Houshu*. Although most of the cultivation methods on this level were dim, apart from these three arts used by the Li family, there were quite a few other Purple Mansion Realm methods.

'The Purple Qi art, *Heavenly Cultivation Purple Scripture*... the Jade True art, *True Jade Union with the Void*... the True Qi art, *Huai River Deity Transformation Book*...'

Li Ximing scanned the list. In addition to these Purple Mansion Realm cultivation methods, he even found several spell arts!

'They're fifth-rank spell arts... It seems only spell arts of the fifth rank and higher are considered Purple Mansion Realm-level. That matches what we know in Jiangnan.'

Overseas, Purple Mansion Realm cultivators generally only use fourth-rank spell arts; only a few of the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions possess fifth-rank ones. He wondered if seventh-rank spell arts even existed, as it was said the highest-ranking spell arts in all of Jiangnan were only sixth-rank.

He let out a long breath. Observing them, he noted that these standalone spell arts were all of a nature that wouldn't easily conflict with other Daoist traditions. There was even one extremely rare spell art for Pure Qi.

Li Ximing couldn't help but ponder:

'Fifth-rank spell arts are too difficult, and I don't have the Dao attainment or talent to master them all. When I have the chance, I'll master one or two, and use fourth-rank ones to fill the gaps... I should just get *one* to use first. After all, not even all overseas Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have a full set of fourth-rank arts.'

Thus, he didn't spend any more time examining the spell arts. He paused, turned, and exited from the first floor of the High Firmament Pavilion. Back in the corridor, he walked past the pavilion and, as he expected, found a path leading downward.

As he descended the steps, the mist began to thin. He soon realized he was on a mountaintop, bathed in the simultaneous light of the moon and the morning sun. He gazed at the terrifying, alien sight of both sun and moon hanging in the sky, then quickly lowered his head.

At the base of the path was an immortal courtyard, with four side-buildings enclosing a central patio. Faint array patterns were visible everywhere, and a formation seemed to be operating silently. Li Ximing walked all the way to the main courtyard gate before he finally scented a trace of danger.

He stopped short, sensing the air carefully. The dangerous aura felt strangely familiar. An instant later, he realized why:

"A Great Prohibition Array! One that's above the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Li Ximing quickly retreated a step. He looked up, his gaze sweeping from the phenomenon of the sun and moon in the sky to the faintly flickering patterns on the immortal pavilion itself. He finally understood.

"This entire world is under the shroud of a Great Prohibition Array! The only reason I was safe and completely unaware of it was because this immortal pavilion's own array is constantly running, protecting the area within it and allowing movement!"

Although the sense of danger from just beyond the gate felt heavy rather than lethal, Li Ximing knew exactly what this place was. His heart pounding with lingering fear, he quickly retreated.

'This territory isn't small, and the spiritual essence is incredibly rich... Pingya Island's Spiritual Qi is already considered passable, but it's nothing compared to this. If I could cultivate here, coming and going as I please, my progress would be doubled with half the effort!'

'And I must remember, the "heavens" mentioned on the jade cushion isn't this place where the High Firmament Pavilion is. Rather, one must be in this "Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance," where the pavilion is located, *in order* to reach the "heavens"!'

'And this High Firmament Pavilion is completely empty. It's probably a Grotto-Heaven. The outside is locked by a Great Prohibition Array... Doesn't that mean it's here for my family to use?'

'A world within the Mirror... If disciples could travel back and forth... storing secrets... it would be so convenient for the family...'

Hope surged in Li Ximing's heart. But hope was one thing; as the initial joy receded, a deep-seated unease grew thicker.

It was simple. Although the spiritual essence here was rich, it was strangely and completely cut off from the Great Void, like a cage. Li Ximing had been pulled into this place with no way out. The outside world was in turmoil! Was he, Li Ximing, supposed to just stay here forever?

He searched the area several times, eyes tightly closed, trying repeatedly to contact the Immortal Mirror, all to no avail. He had no choice but to return to the High Firmament Pavilion. He bowed before the jade cushion once more and stared at its text.

'Open the Profound Radiance, ascend to the heavens, report duties and merits on schedule, to seek the Dao...'

'Right now... it seems the only path left is to activate the Ascension Method...'

He steadied his mind. He lifted his sleeve, withdrew three sticks of incense, and planted them in the bronze burner. With a wave of his hand, he lit them, then settled himself cross-legged onto the jade meditation cushion.

As he chanted the incantation and formed the hand seals, the jade cushion beneath him began to glow. A golden light flowed over the tiny characters, transforming them into golden runes that detached and began to dance around his body, emitting a hazy, elegant light.

Compared to the violent, world-spinning, bone-chilling sensation of first *entering* this Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, Li Ximing felt relatively little. An entire stick of incense burned to ash. The golden runes surrounding him grew more and more numerous, then suddenly surged as one into his Shengyang Acupoint. At the exact same moment, he finished the final line of the incantation. He felt a blinding flash of light, and his soul was pulled free, flying into an infinite void, drifting weightlessly.

His vision went dark and then brightened again, revealing a world of swirling clouds.

"This..."

This time, Li Ximing was truly standing on solid, thick clouds. There was no pavilion, no sun or moon, and certainly no mountain peak. As far as he could see, there was only a boundless white expanse beneath his feet.

He glanced down and saw his legs half-submerged in the mist, flickering in and out of view with a translucent quality. All his divine abilities, his dharma power, and even the solid, physical sense of his body had vanished. All that remained was his soul, standing alone in the clouds.

'It really ignored the Shengyang Acupoint and just snatched my soul... Right now, if even a Qi Refining cultivator showed up... a single spell art could kill me... In the current world... besides the Underworld, who else has this power over souls...'

He forcefully suppressed the terror rising in his heart and peered into the distance. Only then did he spot pavilions, faint and flickering in the distant cloud layers, seemingly built upon the mist itself. Looking even further, he could see a familiar, heaven-piercing golden light.

'So those immortal-realm-like vistas... *this* is the "heavens"!'
