# Chapter 298: The Dou Family

"Xiao Xian..."

Li Yuanjiao stroked the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword at his waist, his brows furrowing. Unlike Li Tongya or Li Xuanxuan, who, despite their unassuming appearances, were deep thinkers, the narrow gap between his eyebrows lent him an untrustworthy appearance. Now, with his brows furrowed, he looked even more like a serpent dragon.

"The Mount Yu branch of the Xiao Family... Qingxiao's marriage into their family is somewhat of a slight, but Xiao Jiuqing is quite adept and has a promising future. If Xiao Xian is sincere and my little sister is willing, he might be a good match."

"The Mount Yu branch is one of the most prominent branches in the Xiao Family," Xiao Guiluan remarked, holding onto Li Yuanjiao's arm.

"Xiao Xian's talent is not great, but he has the potential to achieve the Qi Cultivation Realm. Qingxiao's talent is poor, but with the resources of the Mount Yu branch, Xiao Xian could help her reach the Qi Cultivation Realm with unrefined qi which is a good thing," she continued.

As they chatted and laughed, Mount Lijing appeared beneath them. The couple descended into the courtyard where the clan guards immediately approached, greeting them respectfully.

"Family Head, Madam... Young Master Yuanping is already waiting in the house."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and pushed the door open. Inside, a young boy dressed in white clothes was admiring the calligraphy and paintings on the wall, holding a fan. He appeared to be about twelve or thirteen years old, with a slightly pale face that gave him a sickly look.

Hearing the door open, he turned his head, his eyes lighting up as he smiled, "Brother, you are back!"

"Yes."

Li Yuanping was born to Li Xuanxuan and his wife, Madam Dou. He was the younger brother of Li Yuanxiu from the same mother. Unfortunately, Li Yuanxiu passed away when Madam Dou was pregnant with Li Yuanping. This loss deeply affected Madam Dou and had a profound impact on the unborn child, leaving Li Yuanping with a congenital deficiency.

Fortunately, both his parents were cultivators, and Li Yuanping possessed a spiritual orifice. Although not very talented, he was considered average. After five years of cultivation, he has condensed the Radiant Lure Chakra and reached the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

Li Yuanjiao responded and saw Li Yuanping smile as he said, "I heard that you broke through to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Congratulations!"

In truth, Li Yuanjiao had not been burdened with many mundane affairs over the years. Most of the family's affairs, whether related to Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators or worldly matters, were handled by Xiao Guiluan. She managed things efficiently, with fair rewards and punishments, earning the respect of the entire household.

With Xiao Guiluan's assistance, Li Yuanjiao's cultivation progressed rapidly. He had received the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit Talisman, and his cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds. Within five years, he has already reached the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, surpassing even his father, Li Xuanxuan.

Li Yuanjiao nodded lightly, took two steps to the main seat, and sat down. Looking at his still youthful half-brother, he asked gently, "How is it? Are you able to handle the Clan Affairs Courtyard?"

"It is going well," Li Yuanping replied as he nodded, smiling, "The Jade Court Guards have already reached the fourth or fifth stages of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. The five of them together can suppress any disturbances... though they usually only deal with petty thieves."

Li Yuanjiao had no interest in managing affairs. Seeing Li Yuanping grow up day by day, he hurriedly handed over the Clan Affairs Courtyard to him. Now, seeing that he managed well, Li Yuanjiao nodded in satisfaction and said warmly, "Uphold the family laws strictly. Ensure there are no arrogant individuals among the family's disciples."

As the two brothers were chatting, someone approached hurriedly from below. He bowed in the courtyard, and reported respectfully, "Family Head, there is a letter from Cloud Crowned Peak."

"Present it."

The person below, clad in armor, with a square face and thick eyebrows, had an honest appearance. He quickly handed the letter over to the men. However, Li Yuanjiao took the envelope but did not open it. Instead, he stared at the armored man.

The messenger from the hall had always been someone from the Liu Family, whom Li Yuanjiao was accustomed to seeing. However, this person seemed unfamiliar. After a moment of scrutiny, he asked in confusion, "Are you from the Dou Family?"

With a thud, the armored man kneeled in front of him instantly, slightly fearful as he replied, "Family Head, my name is Dou Yi. Madam Dou is my paternal aunt... The regular messenger fell ill, so I took his place."

"I see... you are someone from my mother's family."

Since Madam Dou was the wife of Li Xuanxuan and the mother of Li Yuanping, Li Yuanjiao should technically call her mother as well. Instead, Li Yuanjiao feigned sudden realization and smiled at Li Yuanping as he said, "I guess he can be considered your cousin."

Li Yuanping, sitting nearby, merely nodded upon hearing this. He did not look at Dou Yi but continued to pour himself tea. Li Yuanjiao understood the situation immediately. He waved his hand casually to dismiss him, and said with indifference, "In that case, you may serve by Yuanping's side and find a position in the Clan Affairs Courtyard."

Dou Yi nodded repeatedly and retreated slowly. Li Yuanping smiled wryly and said, "This is certainly not my mother's doing. It is probably the Dou Family's initiative..."

"I know," Li Yuanjiao nodded as he sighed.

"As they say, when the wall is about to fall, everyone pushes. The Liu Family is, after all, the family of the ancestor's wife so we still need to keep a Liu Family member in the hall. As long as news reaches us, the public will have some fear and will not go overboard with their actions."

Li Yuanping nodded thoughtfully and replied, "Thank you for the guidance, brother."

Li Yuanjiao laughed heartily. The brothers spoke candidly, and Li Yuanjiao's expression was slightly tinged with sadness as he said, "This advice actually came from our eldest brother. I never have any desire for power. Now that you have it in your hands, I believe you won't let it go to waste."

Naturally, he was referring to Li Yuanxiu. Li Yuanping had heard many stories about this elder brother he had never met. He simply nodded, and Li Yuanjiao began to read the letter. After scanning it for a few moments, he smiled.

"It is a letter from father."

Li Yuanping looked up in confusion as Li Yuanjiao explained, "The devil plague is becoming more rampant. Not only Jiang Yan but dozens of others have joined the Devil Dao, committing widespread slaughters. As a result, talismans and dharma artifacts are in high demand within and outside the sect. This has significantly increased our income this year. Father has suggested we send the family's cloud bamboo harvest to be made into talisman papers, which would greatly reduce the costs of crafting talismans."

Li Yuanping, upon hearing the news, lowered his head and said, "The devil plague has been going on for more than five years, yet the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of the Azure Pond Sect have never intervened. I wonder what Chi Zhiyun is thinking..."

Li Yuanjiao paused, and set down his tea bowl before replying, "The devil plague is not simple... As for Jiang Yan, no one knows who he is or whose pawn he might be. You've studied the family history and should be aware of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's power. If they are letting Jiang Yan run amok, it must be a deliberate act."

Li Yuanping pondered silently to himself. After exchanging a few more words, he glanced at the time and, not wanting to disturb Li Yuanjiao further, took his leave.

Once Li Yuanping had left, a dignified woman in a luxurious flowing dress walked out from the back of the hall. She greeted him with a slight bow, her brow furrowed slightly, and said in a serious tone, "My dear, the decline of the Liu Family has been alarmingly rapid. In just five short years, they have gone from a prestigious family to one with members scattered everywhere... There must be something unusual going on."

"That's true. How could that Liu Family member fall ill at this time? They've tried every trick to push someone in front of me, just to test how much affection we still have for the Liu Family."

Li Yuanjiao carefully stored the letter under a pile of scrolls and continued listing out everything. "The Tian Family was sent to the Mount Yue region. The remaining Ren, Chen, Xu, and Dou families must have been plotting to push the Liu Family out of prominence for years... The Liu Family descendants were still indulging themselves. Once the news spread from the mountain, the other families began to act. The Liu Family never had many capable members. They only managed to last five years due to the caution of the other prominent families."

Xiao Guiluan nodded, smiling. "Times have changed. Many things that belonged to the Liu Family should now bear the Dou name. I have met Mother several times; she is tough and has a temper."

Li Yuanjiao laughed heartily, catching the underlying meaning in Xiao Guiluan's words, and responded gently, "I have known Mother for many years. To her, the entire Dou Family holds less value than Yuanping's little finger. The Dou Family is merely the next Liu Family... there's nothing to worry about."

He paused and continued, "Yuanping's temperament mirrors that of Madam Dou; he is not one to be easily deceived. In a couple of years, we'll hand over the family affairs to him. Then, you and I can retire to Mount Wutu to cultivate and live as an immortal couple... Wouldn't that be wonderful?"

Xiao Guiluan nodded slightly. However, she was from the Xiao Family, a centuries-old prestigious clan rife with fierce internal power struggles, unlike the newly established and harmonious Li Family. She had seen too many instances of kin turning against each other. Holding no power made her uneasy—not for herself, but for fear that their son, Li Xizhi, might suffer the consequences.

This intelligent woman had also figured out her husband's temperament well, and refrained from immediately disagreeing with him. Instead, she nodded with a smile, gazing at the flickering candle flame as she pondered how she could secure more support for Li Xizhi.

Li Yuanping left the courtyard, snapped his fan shut with a swish, and walked on with a displeased expression. Dou Yi followed closely behind, feeling as though he had caused trouble and dared not speak.

Li Yuanping suddenly stopped. Caught off guard, Dou Yi nearly stumbled into him. "Young Master! Young Master!" he called out hurriedly.

"Shut up!" Li Yuanping hissed, using his fan to steady the man, frowning slightly. He then said softly, "Which idiot from the Dou Family took it upon themselves to replace that Liu Family member? You nearly made me lose face in front of my elder brother... If Mother finds out, she will surely have you all punished!"

Dou Yi knew he would have to stay by Li Yuanping's side from now on, but could not bear to blame his father, so he merely stammered in response, "Y-yes...Yes..."

Li Yuanping waved his hand gently and turned his head as he walked, saying, "You do not need to tell me... I know it was probably Old Master Dou. When people get old and gain power, they start scheming more."

Dou Yi quickly followed, replying respectfully, "This was also for your benefit, Young Master. The Clan Affairs Courtyard has always been the stepping stone to becoming the family head... Young Master Yuanjiao has often expressed his desire to relinquish his authority. Now that you are in charge of the Clan Affairs Courtyard, it's only a matter of time before you ascend to the family head! Father simply wanted to place more people to help you."

"Heh," Li Yuanping chuckled, amused. "You speak with such certainty. Your father isn't trying to help me; he's trying to sabotage me! If he truly wanted to help, he would patiently wait three years. There's no need for him to meddle now."

He frowned and looked at the guilt-ridden Dou Yi before saying, "Your father is merely using this as an excuse to expand his influence... Why does he need to do so under the guise of helping me? Your family is my maternal family. When I assume leadership, you will naturally have your place. There's no need for all this... Don't assume I am young and easily deceived."

Dou Yi quickly broke out into a cold sweat. Li Yuanping, waving his fan, continued calmly, "Let us set that aside. I do not care who sent you. Since my elder brother has assigned you to me, you will work for me from now on. Forget about your Dou Family."

Dou Yi was stunned. What Li Yuanping said was completely different from what his father had instructed. Old Master Dou had always told him, "Young Master Yuanping and Madam Dou are the pillars of our Dou Family. Rely on them to secure more power for our family... In the future, our Dou Family will rise to prominence."

Hearing Li Yuanping's tone now, it was clear that neither he nor Madam Dou regarded the Dou Family as supporters. Instead, they were guarded against them, fearing that the Dou Family might drag them down! Dou Yi felt a pang of bitterness and said mournfully, "Young Master, the Dou Family is entirely at your command and only listens to you... Back then, the Tian and Liu families rose with the tide. Distant relatives are also your arms... Why push them away?"

Unexpectedly, Li Yuanping stopped and looked back at him with interest sparkling in his eyes as he smiled and said, "Cousin... My surname is Li! I am a legitimate son of the main family."

With that, he turned and walked away. Dou Yi, startled, dared not speak further and just followed him closely.

The two walked through the mountains for a while and entered a brightly lit large courtyard. Li Yuanping waited at the courtyard entrance for a moment until a female servant hurried out carrying a basin of water. He asked gently, "Has Mother gone to sleep?"

"Madam has washed her feet and is waiting for you in her room!" the female servant answered hastily.

Dou Yi immediately understood that this was Madam Dou's courtyard. Remembering his father's foolish actions and his aunt's tough nature, his legs trembled, and he lamented silently.

My foolish father has caused trouble, yet I have to pay for it. What a plight!

Li Yuanping paid no heed to him and led him into the courtyard. They were greeted by a scene of layers upon layers of pale yellow drapery, with flickering lights and a faint scent of incense wafting through the air. Two female servants stood obediently by the bed.

Li Yuanping kneeled respectfully and greeted softly, "I've arrived, Mother. Congratulations on your breakthrough... The Qi Cultivation Realm is certainly within your reach!"

Madam Dou, sitting upright at the head, was dressed in luxurious clothing, her appearance youthful. Her aura had reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and she was now just a step away from the Qi Cultivation Realm, making her one of the most formidable among the external cultivators.

Over the years, Madam Dou had skillfully managed to keep Li Xuanxuan's numerous wives and concubines in check, while also elevating her own family's status in agriculture. Simultaneously, she continued to advance her own cultivation.

"No need for formalities, Ping'er."

Though Madam Dou was known for her stern demeanor, she was unreservedly affectionate toward her child. She immediately invited him to sit. Li Yuanping nodded and recounted the evening's events, including the details of Li Xuanxuan's letter.

Madam Dou listened intently, and by the end, Dou Yi felt his scalp tingle. He glanced up timidly, only to meet a pair of eyes that were as cold and piercing as starlight.

"Come here." Madam Dou's voice was gentle. Dou Yi quickly stood before his aunt. A delicate hand with long nails stained with balsam flowers emerged from behind the drapery. Dou Yi stared blankly at the hand, and with a light flick, Madam Dou beckoned him closer.

SLAP!

Dou Yi received a solid slap across his face, leaving half of it bright red. He dared not show any anger, only bowing repeatedly and pleading, "Mercy, Auntie! Mercy!"

Madam Dou's words drifted gently to his ears. "Go back and deliver this slap to your father. Tell him this..."

She parted her red lips and slowly uttered the words: "Try something funny again and his life will be as good as gone."

Meanwhile on Mount Yuting...

Li Qinghong exhaled deeply, her breath visible as a stream of white in the air. The long spear resting on her knees shimmered with mana light. Opening her eyes, which had been nurtured by mana, they sparkled brightly in the dark chamber.

"Second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm..." she mumbled softly.

For the past five years, Li Qinghong had mostly stayed on the mountain to cultivate. She had broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm in the first three years and then reached the second heavenly layer in the subsequent two.

Now in her early twenties, her cultivation speed was notably swift compared to the usual three to five years typically needed for each heavenly layer. Only Li Yuanjiao had progressed slightly faster than her, aided by the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit talisman.

Rising with her spear, a faint purple hue coursed through her eyes, enhancing her already captivating appearance. As a former Grade Four thunder technique, the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique,

made Li Qinghong's aura exceptionally strong, far surpassing the usual Qi Cultivation Realm of the second heavenly layer.

"Clan Sister..."

A man stood cautiously outside the stone chamber. He was one of Li Xuanxuan's concubine-born sons, lacking a spiritual orifice. Among Li Xuanxuan's numerous offspring, he had little presence and had been sent to manage a town on Mount Yuting.

Li Qinghong's red lips parted slightly, commanding curtly, "Speak."

The man respectfully replied, "Recently, men have been disappearing. For three months, clan cultivators have investigated but found nothing. Three days ago, nine families perished suddenly... We've reported to the main family and were granted permission to seek your aid, Clan Sister."

Li Qinghong nodded slightly and asked in confusion, "What about Uncle?"

The man understood she was referring to Chen Donghe and answered hurriedly, "He has gone to the market with Elder An, to send the furs and spirit items. The Family Head is searching for mountains within the Mount Yue region. We are unsure if he has returned, so..."

"All right." Li Qinghong nodded before taking him up with her in the wind and began asking for more details about the situation.

For the first time in his life, the man experienced the thrill of riding the wind. Looking down at the small town and the passing clouds and birds, a sense of envy overwhelmed him. He eagerly answered Li Qinghong's questions, pointing out directions while feeling a rush of exhilaration.

Following his directions, Li Qinghong descended to find several empty houses with traces of blood left on the ground. With a swift glance, her dharma eyes detected many peculiarities beneath her feet. She set down her clan brother, then with a graceful movement, sketched several runes in the air before casting a talisman.
