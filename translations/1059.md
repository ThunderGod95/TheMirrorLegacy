# Chapter 1059: Lesser Yang

Minghui heard this, shook his head, and sighed bitterly.

"Daoist Master, you don't understand. This 'dead end' isn't truly death... Sometimes, the dead end is the only path to life. If I don't die now, I will truly perish later!"

Daoist Master Changyun was already a calculating man. Just from that one sentence, he had a good grasp of the situation. He lowered his gaze in thought, uncertain.

"If that is your concern... it's not as if there are no Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the Song State at Shanji. I hear you are dispatched on missions daily. How hard could it be to find an opportunity to seek death!"

Minghui shook his head.

"Daoist Master, you don't know. At Profound Peak, they now have Gongsun Bei and Qi Lanyan. Although they haven't acted, they are watching my duels with Tinglan. The most I can manage is to get injured. How could I find a chance to die?"

"But if you fail to die and only accumulate injuries, when the real calamity arrives, won't your chances of survival be even slimmer?"

Daoist Master Changyun nodded slightly. If there were some easy way out, how could _he_ know more than Minghui, a high-level Buddhist cultivator? The other man clearly had a favor to ask.

"What does Maha require of me? Please, speak."

Minghui nodded as expected and lowered his voice.

"I came south all those years ago at the request of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. Now that I am trapped, I must naturally turn to them to resolve this calamity. But I waited and waited, and the one the Great Adoration Dharma Realm sent... was... Vast Cicada..."

At the mention of Vast Cicada, Minghui's expression turned grim. Changyun, however, looked thoughtful.

"The one descended from the Undefeated King of Brightness... who now presides over the Precious Tusk Golden Land? A Bright Yang descendant?"

Minghui stared at him, slightly stunned, as if surprised. He suddenly remembered the man before him had been to the Profound Governance Pavilion and had likely interacted with many Buddhist cultivators. He nodded.

"That's him... The Great Adoration Dharma Realm acquired the Precious Tusk Golden Land, expanding the Buddhist Land, and he became a favored figure under the 'Great One'... But it's precisely because he is so entrenched in the Precious Tusk Golden Land that he feels little kinship with the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and doesn't accept their doctrines... I simply cannot reason with him!"

A look of profound frustration crossed his face. Changyun, however, shook his head and said quietly,

"I see it as more than that... You are intent on self-preservation, and your esteemed Lotus Temple wishes to avoid involvement in the fall of the Bright Yang. He came south specifically for the White Qilin. How could you two possibly find common ground? He probably wishes you dead at the hands of the south, just to drag your temple into the fray."

Seeing that Changyun understood everything clearly, Minghui stopped beating around the bush. He adopted a fawning tone.

"Daoist Master has sharp eyes... I am in the most difficult position right now... Seeing you come south, I finally feel a ray of hope. I was hoping that once you are under Qi Lanyan's command, you might... if not request my transfer... at least lend a hand when the fighting with the south begins."

As he spoke, his emotions swelled, and his voice filled with dread.

"I only have you to rely on, Daoist Master!"

Daoist Master Changyun remained noncommittal, giving him a deep look.

'The great tide is just beginning; the time is not yet ripe. Jiangbei looks impregnable, and the south is defensive, unable to attack. But mortal strength has its limits. How can it contend with the Great One's methods? When the True Qi continuously rises and the Bright Yang's foundation shakes ever more violently, Jiangbei will be impossible to hold. The Great One made arrangements long ago. My opportunity will surely come...'

'But before that, I'll inevitably have to bow my head to the Profound Governance Pavilion... If I'm alone, who knows how Qi Lanyan might scheme to frame me. The Lotus Temple has no ambition to stir up the world; their only desire is to retreat to the north. They make a convenient ally...'

He pondered for a moment, then rose.

"You and I have been friends for many years... It's not that I cannot help you with this. But I have my own plans. I will save your life on this venture, but in the future, I will need you to yield to me in turn."

Their words were overflowing with intimacy—"many years of friendship," "deep bond"—but they both knew each other's nature. They knew there was little pure friendship between divine ability Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, especially those from different factions. At its root, it was all an exchange of benefits.

Precisely because they understood this, Changyun was direct. Minghui, in turn, became extremely solemn. He raised his hand.

"If Daoist Master saves my life, I will be bound by this karma. How could I watch you die and not intervene! Today, I swear to the Great Compassionate, Joyful Lotus-World Aspect that I will repay you generously in the future!"

"Generously repay..."

Daoist Master Changyun's expression was a little strange. He shook his head.

"Your 'generous repayment' as Buddhist cultivators... I don't really dare to trust it. Back when the master of the Way of Emptiness failed in his pursuit of the Dao, every power took advantage of the chaos. The Buddhist Land collapsed. Zhelu fled from the Long Dao... he received the grace of the Auspicious Tablet Gate. But when _he_ became the master of the Way of Emptiness, he hurried back and forcibly 'converted' their entire sect... A 'generous repayment' indeed..."

After all, Buddhist cultivators had a poor reputation, and such incidents were common. Minghui was extremely embarrassed and started cursing Zhelu, but Changyun paid it no mind.

'When the Great One's plan closes its net and I reveal my identity, I won't have to worry about you failing to deliver!'

But Minghui was thinking just as hard.

'Master told me to find Changyun, so this fellow must have something good that can protect me... If I'm tossed around and truly have no way out, Master will also act. I must find a way to make those two bastards suffer...'

The two reached an agreement, each harboring their own agenda. Minghui whispered,

"I've thought this through. Once the north and south clash, the critical point will rest on two people. First... Yang Ruiyi. Second, Li Zhouwei."

The monk usually looked flighty, but his eyes were now crystal clear.

"And I... will likely be sent to fight Yang Ruiyi. It's even more likely they'll place me alone on Yang Ruiyi's path! And you, Daoist Master... I fear your assignment will also be related to Yang Ruiyi."

His expression darkened.

"After all, from the current look of things, Qi Lanyan has set his sights on Li Zhouwei. The ones sent to fight him will surely be people like Gongsun Bei and Vast Cicada, who want him dead at all costs. If he sent you, he would definitely worry you wouldn't try your best... Conversely, against Yang Ruiyi, you, Daoist Master, will have to protect yourself."

Daoist Master Changyun nodded. Minghui continued,

"Yang Ruiyi commands the Exiled Qi. It's highly likely he can blockade all traces, slip into the north undetected, and kill me easily. My master will use his great dharma power to observe the Great Void. Although he certainly won't be able to see the Exiled Qi's movements, he _can_ see _me_. The instant he loses my trail, he will immediately send you word!"

"I am confident I can protect myself for a short time. You must come and save me, Daoist Master..."

Daoist Master Changyun nodded slightly, settling the matter. Only then did Minghui retrieve a jade slip from his sleeve and hand it to Changyun, raising an eyebrow.

"This is what Daoist Master Qi instructed me to bring."

Daoist Master Changyun raised his own eyebrows. He unfurled the jade slip, only to find it completely blank under his spiritual sense. There were no words. But after unrolling it, he saw a line of characters written in ink on the bright white surface:

'To be granted land and title, the time is today. Hiding in your sect, how will you repay your superior's grace?'

Daoist Master Changyun sneered inwardly.

'So, you, Qi, are also playing with fire. The "superior" you refer to... that must be _my_ True Monarch! Fine, fine. Have your little joke today. Wei Xuanyin will inevitably achieve the Dao. We'll see who comes to protect _you_ then.'

Minghui kept his head down, staring at the table in silence. He watched the Daoist Master smile.

"How rare, how rare. To think Daoist Master Qi is actually showing consideration for me, worrying that I might betray the trust of Lord Wei!"

Minghui had no desire to get involved in their dispute either. He just murmured in agreement and did not linger. After informing Changyun of the deadline for him and the Chengyun Gate disciples to head south, he stepped into the Great Void and departed.

Daoist Master Changyun watched him disappear, standing on the terrace for a long time, lost in thought.

"Li Zhouwei already has two divine abilities... The Profound Governance Pavilion was too ruthless this time. He won't recover for at least five or six years... Qi Lanyan does have a mind to delay the fall of the Bright Yang..."

Beside him, Zhong Qian's expression turned complicated upon hearing news of the Li family, but he did not reply. Daoist Master Changyun paced the terrace, silent for a long time.

'When I met Li Tongya back then, I only felt his destiny was unusual. I never imagined he was of the orthodox Bright Yang Wei-lineage. Thinking back, it's reasonable. The Great One's schemes truly run deep...'

'Emperor Wei... Emperor Wei...'

There were many in the world who wished for Li Qianyuan's demise. He didn't know what the Great One above was thinking, but from Changyun's perspective, it would be better if this matter ran into some complications.

'Luoxia's power is too vast right now... So vast it's suffocating us. If this affair could just go wrong... I'm not even asking for Li Qianyuan to reclaim his Fruition Attainment. If he could just cling to life for another one or two hundred years, that would be good...'

'Back then, when the Wei State dominated, the Great One was cultivating on Bone-Ridge Mountain. Wei soldiers entered the mountain, and Emperor Wei met the Great One, leaving behind the Heart-Emptying Stone... The relationship between the Wei Kingdom and my Golden Oneness of Highest Azure was originally excellent...'

Later, when Emperor Wei fell into decline, his own Great One sent an incarnation into the mortal realm, stirring up the world and personally engineering the Qi Emperor's downfall. Even if it was for his own benefit, in Zhang Yun's eyes, this had already repaid the favor of old. Otherwise, if the Qi Emperor had truly achieved the Dao and survived to this day, following Luoxia and aiding the tyrant, Li Qianyuan's situation would be incomparably more wretched.

As for the massacre of Emperor Wei's bloodline in Guanzhong, Zhang Yun had heard of it, but he was unconcerned.

'They were going to die eventually. What difference does it make who killed them? They are True Monarchs, after all. Would they truly care about the lives of a few descendants?'

Mulling it over, he secretly stroked his beard.

'I see that Qi Lanyan has some intention of putting Li Zhouwei to death. This won't be easy—the Seven Aspects faction is enormous, with many Dharma Masters. They are still probing. How could a minor cultivator like him manage it... I can just watch from the side. The Seven Aspects' feelings for the Bright Yang scions cannot be suppressed. When the time is right, they can be used...'

His thoughts turned dark.

'True Qi is a great boon to the Whole Pill Dao. Counting across the world, there are few Whole Pill divine ability cultivators left... If the Ancestor can succeed, my Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition will finally have a little breathing room under the Heavenly Glow...'

'I still must wait... The Whole Pill True Monarch of old fell in the Eastern Sea, and the Wondrous Whole Root-Nature subsequently fell into Beijia's hands. The Great One was forced to compromise with the Dragon-kin...'

He stared intently at the desk, his expression calm.

'Things have come to this... no matter which family... no one can afford to lose.'

## Wave-Suppressing Mansion

The sea churned, and the sky was dim.

Li Que'wan stood on the shore, fraught with worry, feeling the sea breeze buffet her face. She waited and waited, her heart growing hesitant.

'That Demon King Fuxun has already entered the formation. The grotesque thing on him is clearly bad news. If someone instructed him, I'm afraid Wave-Suppressing Mansion is about to be lost...'

Li Que'wan used the Immortal Mirror and found that the grotesque entity was still scanning everywhere, wandering about the cave-mansion. Within the Immortal Artifact's field of vision, she could even see a hazy golden radiance covering the creature, illuminating the entire island, penetrating deep underground, and occupying every blind spot.

It was precisely because of this illusory radiance that even now, Li Que'wan couldn't be sure if she was within the creature's sight... which also made her afraid to crush the jade talisman.

'With the Talisman Seed, at least this thing can't see what I'm thinking. But if I crush the jade talisman, I won't be able to explain why... It will definitely attract attention...'

This thing was piggybacking on a dignified Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and Fuxun himself was completely unaware. Li Que'wan couldn't be too cautious. If not for the fact that Li Ximing was also protected by the Immortal Artifact, she would be worried that he, too, would meet with disaster if he came!

Li Que'wan stood silently for a long time before she vaguely saw a golden light appear on the horizon. In the blink of an eye, it was before her, revealing a Daoist Master in white-gold robes with a speck of light on his brow. Who else could it be but Li Ximing!

Her first reaction was not joy, but worry. Excitement flooded her face, as if she were merely a girl who hadn't seen her elder in many days. She rode the wind and immediately flew _past_ the formation boundary!

The action was quite natural, but it conveniently cut off any thought Li Ximing might have had of continuing forward.

But Li Ximing had stopped there, not entering the formation precisely because he was being cautious. Why would he move forward? He smiled brightly at her, his gaze not falling on the island, but his spiritual sense was already linked with the Immortal Artifact.

In an instant, the entire scene on the island appeared before him. Li Ximing's heart suddenly clenched in alarm.

He immediately noticed Fuxun, who was in seclusion within the cave-mansion. On the back of the Demon beast's head was something with golden lips and white teeth, bizarre and inexplicable. Its eyes were tightly shut, and a pale golden light surged out, threatening to submerge everything.

'What is this demon beast...'

But the very instant he appeared at the island, that pair of eyes suddenly snapped open, revealing pure white pupils. It stared at Li Ximing with profound interest!

'It can sense me remotely, even through the Great Purple Light Formation?! This thing is far too terrifying!'

At first glance, he had thought it was some kind of Dharma Body the other had cultivated, or perhaps a unique injury. But with just that one look, Li Ximing's heart went cold. He spoke in a perfectly natural voice:

"Is Daoist Master Yuanbian in seclusion?"

Li Que'wan was extremely sharp and nodded repeatedly. Li Ximing knew this was no place to talk. He immediately fabricated an excuse, smiling.

"I came out this time to visit the Nine Mounds. I'll take you along. We shouldn't disturb him. Let's go!"

Li Ximing had her leave a written note, then casually took the young woman's hand. Bracing himself, he acted as if nothing was wrong and rode the wind away. He could feel those pure white eyes slowly moving, quietly watching in the direction he had left.

Only after Li Ximing had vanished from sight did that pair of eyes slowly move back. The pale golden lips smacked together, and a garbled mumble suddenly became clear:

"Bright... Yang... Li..."

The lips twisted continuously, the skin seeming to be controlled by many different people, forming very awkward shapes. It kept smacking, gradually becoming more proficient. After a long while, it formed the words again:

"Bright Yang useless... Want... Lesser Yang..."

This sentence seemed to be some kind of command. Fuxun's eyes snapped open in an instant. He subconsciously stood up and started to walk forward. But as his hand touched the entrance of the cave-mansion, he woke as if from a dream. He couldn't detect anything amiss. He simply lowered his head, his eyes clear and calm, and said thoughtfully:

"Indeed. My injury is severe. But if I could have a **Lesser Yang** cultivator examine it, it would be far better than me wasting years to no avail!"
