# Chapter 754: Suspicion

"That's not how it works! Don't you dare complain about the job."

Immortal Official Liu just smiled.

"Weren't you the one saying day after day how tedious and burdensome this work is? My original post was a real plum assignment. I specifically saved this position for you. The work is novel, you get to hear endless flattery, and you can even observe the situation in the lower realm. Isn't that wonderful?"

He folded his sleeves, feigning disappointment.

"But if you're unwilling, then forget it!"

"My lord, wait!"

Hearing this, Dangjiang had a sudden realization. He wasn't the least bit tired anymore. He scrambled up from the table, forcing a smile.

"This lowly one was just confirming the details! Whatever tasks my lord arranges... I am happy to do them, sweet or bitter. Even the greatest hardship would be sweet as honey. How could I possibly complain? Only now do I realize my lord's kindness. I am truly, deeply moved!"

Lu Jiangxian knew he was a practiced flatterer and just said:

"I am pressed for time and cannot say more. Take my token. Leave this Secret Vault Profound Seven Pavilion of the Saintly Purity Palace and follow the path across the heavens. You will naturally see a treasure pavilion."

"We haven't had contact with the lower realm in years, so the staff in that pavilion has dwindled. Just match the token, ascend the steps, and someone will be there to receive you."

Dangjiang started to ask another question, but Lu Jiangxian cut him off immediately. He continued, mimicking Immortal Official Liu:

"I must depart now. You should have a lower realm sacrificial rite to attend to. If you are free, go and handle it immediately."

After speaking, he quickly took his leave. Dangjiang followed him reluctantly to the edge of the courtyard, hesitating.

"My lord previously said this pavilion must be guarded, which is why I've stayed here day after day. If I leave, this place will be empty. Won't I be charged with dereliction of duty?"

"Relax."

Lu Jiangxian had only given that order previously because he feared Dangjiang would wander off, forcing him to constantly find someone to cover the post. He replied, "As long as you carry my token and are performing official duties—not just idling or wandering aimlessly—it doesn't count as abandoning your post. You can stay securely at either location. Just hurry when traveling between them. Do not dally."

With that, he walked away quickly. Dangjiang couldn't leave the courtyard and could only watch him disappear over the horizon. He looked back at the token left on the table. It was the length of a forearm, pure white, and engraved with ornate, silvery Supreme Yin patterns. A single glance confirmed it was no ordinary item.

He admired it for a moment, glanced at the half-revised cultivation manual on his desk, and mused internally:

'I'll finish writing the last little bit, then go take a look.'

He buried his head in his research, but after only two lines, he couldn't wait any longer.

'I'll go check it out first. A quick look around will be a nice break, then I'll come back.'

He immediately stood up, left the small courtyard beneath the pavilion, and stepped onto the clouds. He took out the token, and just as expected, a faint silver star lit up in the distance. He flew through the streaming clouds, following the light closely.

Before long, the clouds and mist parted, revealing a vast, majestic grand hall. It was guarded by dragons and phoenixes, a scene of infinite, opulent splendor. Below his feet, a golden lake rippled, spanned by twelve white jade bridges leading to the central palace.

Dangjiang took one look and his eyes stung from the brilliance. He quickly lowered his gaze. He noticed rows upon rows of golden-armored Celestial Soldiers standing beside the white jade bridges, their armor magnificent, their gaze fixed forward.

Naturally, Dangjiang didn't dare strike up a conversation. He figured he wasn't qualified to set foot on those celestial bridges anyway. He looked down at his token; sure enough, it instructed him to circle around the lake. He dutifully lowered his gaze and hurried forward.

This palace complex was terrifyingly large. Even the lakeshore had guards. Dangjiang didn't dare even lift his eyebrows. He wound his way around, following the corridors deeper into the complex, the atmosphere growing more profound. He finally arrived at a palace gate by the lakeside.

Two even more imposing Celestial Soldiers guarded this gate. This time, one of them finally raised an eyebrow to look at him. Dangjiang just held up the token.

He heard one of them say, "Ah, an official from the Supreme Yin Palace. Please, enter."

Dangjiang hurried inside. Once through the palace gate, the decor gradually returned to the style of the Supreme Yin lineage. There was even a faint trace of snow on the ground. This area was also massive, and everything was opulent.

He twisted and turned, never missing an opportunity to observe his surroundings. There were quite a few people in this palace, but every single one seemed impossibly noble. The armor of the celestial generals was mostly just a step below a high decree, and some even looked equal. Celestial maidens drifted by, tassels fluttering. He finally spotted a few immortal officials, but every one of them was silent and frightened, not daring to speak.

Dangjiang was already an over-thinker. This one look was enough for him to understand his new standing. He just shrank his neck and hurried onward until he reached a small courtyard. The serving maids on either side closed the gate behind him, and only then did he let out a sigh of relief.

The small courtyard was perfectly orderly. The ground was paved with spotless white jade bricks, and four white jade lamp pedestals were spaced evenly. In the very center sat a round, bottomless pool. Other than these things, there was nothing else. It was obviously not a courtyard meant for habitation.

He circled the area, wringing his hands, unsure what to do. Suddenly, the token in his hand lit up. The water in the round pool rapidly turned a shimmering white. He knew it was time to work. He hurried forward and peered into the pool's depths.

He watched the white color in the pool recede, the surface becoming mirror-like. First, it was pitch black, then a faint light flickered. It seemed to be coming from an extremely hidden place. A respectful, prayer-like voice emerged, buzzing like a swarm of bees, gradually becoming clearer:

"...This lowly cultivator, Chi Buzi, having piously prepared this sacrificial offering, respectfully petitions the Supreme Yin, praying to the Celestial Officials to avert disaster and dispel evil, that my immortal path may be vast..."

Dangjiang froze. All his previous nervousness and anxiety vanished, replaced by a wave of smug satisfaction that spread across his face. He lifted his head and laughed.

"I was wondering which esteemed person it might be. So, it's our very own Daoist Master Chi!"

He channeled his spiritual sense into the token, activating the artifact to receive the connection. The light and shadow in the pool grew more and more real. After half a moment, the radiance flowed out and coalesced in the courtyard, forming the shape of a man in green robes.

The man had only just stabilized his footing when he realized his surroundings had abruptly changed. He was standing in a courtyard, shocked and suspicious. He looked up and saw a young immortal official with pale green eyes standing before him. The official’s robes were embroidered with Supreme Yin patterns. Although he didn't seem high-ranking, Chi Buzi reacted instantly, bowing immediately.

"This lowly cultivator greets you, my lord!"

Dangjiang was grinning so wide his mouth wouldn't close, his smile practically falling off his face. "Daoist Master Chi! Open your eyes and take a good look... Do you know who I am?"

Chi Buzi paused, then looked up. The man was young, but his mannerisms were oddly old, carrying a strange sense of familiarity. He couldn't help but hesitate...

Chi Buzi had never actually seen Dangjiang's true form. In the conflicts years ago, they were always fighting over control of *his* body. Even when Dangjiang won, it was still Chi Buzi's body, just with a new owner. But he was extremely clever.

'The only person I could possibly know up here... seems to be that damned donkey... This person doesn't look like an idiot, but his tone is *exactly* the same as that idiot's.'

He tested the waters: "Daoist Friend Dangjiang?"

He didn't even need Dangjiang's answer. One look at the smug grin on that idiot's face told him everything. Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow.

"Yo... the old bastard actually has some status up here?"

Despite being in a position where he clearly had to bow his head, Chi Buzi showed not a shred of fear, instead questioning him with a mocking laugh.

Sure enough, Dangjiang laughed aloud, then feigned anger. "You insolent demonic disciple! How dare you show such disrespect to an esteemed immortal official of The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity?"

The title sounded magnificent, but Chi Buzi wasn't scared. He had a keen grasp of human nature and, after so many years, understood Dangjiang perfectly. With this type of person, acting subservient only emboldens them. The only way was to laugh and curse, showing no fear.

Besides, after all those years of mutual scheming in the Eastern Sea... call it enmity, but with the Immortal Lord overseeing everything, would he really have let Dangjiang perish? Calling it "training" sounded nice, but whether it was hatred or camaraderie depended entirely on Chi Buzi's attitude.

And Chi Buzi was someone personally granted a cultivation art by the Immortal Lord. How could Dangjiang dare to harm him? He immediately laughed.

"Still posturing! Looking at those robes, you're just a minor official up here in the heavens!"

This hit the nail on the head. Dangjiang’s breath hitched. He snapped, "One official in the heavens is a hundred times more impressive than a Daoist Master on earth!"

Chi Buzi understood immediately.

'This idiot is having a *really* bad time in whatever heaven this is.'

Chi Buzi naturally assumed this "heaven" was a Grotto-Heaven, just like Anhuai Heaven or Pristine Speech Heaven—the personal domain of the mighty Immortal Lord. And this "Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin" was just that Immortal Lord's immortal sect or bureau. Having figured out the other's situation in just a few words, he glanced silently toward the courtyard gate, suspicion rising in his heart.

'Why don't I see anyone else... In the Immortal Lord's Grotto-Heaven... the only person I'm dealing with is Dangjiang?'

Aloud, he declared, "Enough nonsense. I am conducting this ritual array according to the Immortal Lord's decree. What right do you have to intercept me?"

This shout terrified Dangjiang. He quickly grabbed Chi Buzi's sleeve and hissed, "What are you yelling about! His lordship granted you a summoning array, and now you think you're really somebody? Outside this gate, it's nothing but immortal officials and celestial generals! If you stir up trouble, I can't protect you!"

Chi Buzi narrowed his eyes slightly, instantly shifting his attitude to align with Dangjiang's. He whispered back, "I'm not familiar with this Grotto-Heaven... From now on, are you the one who will receive me? I managed to acquire a Purple Mansion demon beast. It *is* Purple Mansion level, so it must count as a significant contribution even in a Grotto-Heaven. This benefits both of us. You have to ensure my contribution is reported properly. If you steal my credit, or can't protect it, what's left for us to discuss in the future?"

Dangjiang knew he was smart, but he hadn't expected him to think through so many angles so quickly. He was momentarily stumped.

"According to the feedback from the token, your contribution is indeed recorded. I still have to go to the main hall to report your merit. Do you have any requests for a reward?"

Chi Buzi's eyes lit up immediately. "Yes... yes! It's that immortal-rank inheritance you carried on you all those years ago... do you remember? My Chou-Gui Hidden Form... I only managed to forge that using your item! I only ask for that thing, nothing else!"

Dangjiang didn't know if that item was even available. He frowned. "That thing was also granted by the heavens, and it was related to the Purple Mansion realm to begin with... I have connections in the heavens. I know a high-ranking official in a revered lord's palace. It won't hurt to ask."

"But... I vaguely recall... back then, you had the Foundation Establishment art and the spiritual qi for the Chou-Gui Hidden Form, and you built your immortal foundation. But you didn't have the Purple Mansion chapter. You didn't break through to a divine ability. You relied on sensing that treasure to make the breakthrough..."

As he spoke, Chi Buzi also frowned, clearly realizing the discrepancy. Dangjiang continued:

"But now you are supposed to cultivate 'Purging Dew.' You don't even have the immortal foundation for it. This situation is not the same as before. What if the treasure is wasted... you won't even have a place to cry..."

"True..."

Chi Buzi frowned. Back when he received the cultivation art, he only knew it might restore his path. He knew nothing else. Arriving here was completely unexpected; how could he have thought this far ahead? Now understanding the situation, he reacted instantly.

'That's right. The Purging Dew art is nowhere to be found. Furthermore, Taiqing does *not* want to see me break through... If I don't cultivate the Purging Dew, it's fine. But the moment my fifth divine ability becomes Purging Dew, if I fail to break through again before Taiqing returns... I'll die without a complete corpse.'

He fell silent. Dangjiang whispered, "Why not ask for something else? I manage the cultivation arts. The heavens certainly don't lack spiritual qi. I can first request the Purple Mansion cultivation art and the spiritual qi for Purging Dew. You can cultivate it yourself."

Chi Buzi's mindset had already changed. He shook his head. "No. Even if I got it, I wouldn't dare cultivate it. It's useless."

Although he knew the man before him loved to boast, Chi Buzi could only grit his teeth and reply, "Don't you have connections in the heavens? Ask for me... You understand my strength and my methods. If I successfully cultivate to the Golden Core realm outside the Grotto-Heaven, it would be an excellent outcome for you too. Even if I were just recommended to enter the Grotto-Heaven, it would benefit you greatly."

Dangjiang nodded silently. No matter how luxurious the heavens were, a Golden Core True Monarch still commanded respect. If one visited the heavens on a normal day, even just inviting a celestial general or a minor deity for tea, they would have to give face... He was tempted. "That person *is* a powerful figure. He'll only humor me because he knows me. He can ask for you..."

Chi Buzi nodded, half-convinced, and asked, "But how do I return? And after I go back, how do I see you again? I can't just go hunting a Purple Mansion demon every single time, can I? I'm not a Golden Core True Monarch."

Dangjiang shook his head. "Just jump into the pool and you'll return. I've already recorded your contribution with the token. In the future, if you need to reach this place, just activate the array with your divine ability. You'll be able to arrive with your spiritual sense. You just won't be able to enter with your true body like today; it will only be for transmitting messages."

"That's fine."

Chi Buzi sighed, seemingly ready to leave. He took a step toward the pool's edge. He placed one hand on the white jade lamp pedestal by the pool, feeling its solid, real texture. Then, he touched his storage bag, only to find that it wouldn't open.

The young man’s expression suddenly relaxed. His previously brisk pace halted. He turned his head.

"Can I see the scenery outside?"

Dangjiang didn't detect anything wrong. He just sneered, "I'm afraid it would scare you to death!"

He led him to the courtyard gate and pushed it open slightly. Chi Buzi saw a street covered in cold snow, lit by bright moon lanterns. The emblem of the golden osmanthus and crescent moon was everywhere. He could see white-robed cultivators flying through the sky. Further in the distance, the faint outlines of golden palaces and pavilions hung in the air, along with celestial-spanning white jade bridges.

Chi Buzi squinted, observing, but ultimately did not dare to step out. He just turned back around.

'I can't get out... and there's nothing in this courtyard I can take.'

The young man's green eyes carefully scanned the entire area. He smiled. "Daoist Friend Dangjiang, those robes of yours are quite magnificent. Why not gift me one?"

Dangjiang looked at him strangely. "Are you insane? Is this something you are qualified to take?"

Chi Buzi just smiled without replying. He took a step, glancing at the white jade moon-lantern pedestal. The lantern was sealed shut; he couldn't see what was inside. The jade bricks beneath his feet were perfectly fitted, with no debris between them.

He put on a sincere smile and said with great formality, "Daoist Friend Dangjiang, I am a mortal man and do not recognize the treasures of the heavens. I wonder if I might take one small item as a souvenir? I can look at it and admire it in my daily life, and it will remind me that I truly once visited the Grotto-Heaven."

Hearing this, Dangjiang felt his pride swell. He laughed heartily and nodded repeatedly.

"But of course! That is perfectly fine!"
