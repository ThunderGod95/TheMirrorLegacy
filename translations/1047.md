# Chapter 1047: The Riddle of the Water Mansion

The sea surged, and colossal waves clawed at the sky.

**BOOM!**

Purple lightning webbed the horizon as dark clouds, driven by chaotic winds, swept across the sky. The spiritual energy above the ocean roiled in turmoil, forcing the few streaks of light that had been soaring through the air to descend and take refuge on the water's surface.

A dense, cyan light churned upon the waves, resembling a colossal beast with hunched shoulders and a curved back. It cast a fine, jade-green shimmer across the water. From the heavens, a gigantic treasured cauldron materialized, pinning the light to the surface of the sea.

The cyan light finally solidified, revealing a colossal Profound Giant Turtle with a green shell. Two horns sprouted from its head, its claws and fangs were wickedly sharp, and its back was encrusted with countless white corals and jewels that dripped with the light of the Water Mansion.

Its jade-green eyes, as vast as temple doors, snapped open, revealing a fierce and glacial gaze. As its massive maw parted, its rows of sharp, bone-white teeth glinted ominously.

"You Daoist Master... you are truly insatiable!"

The treasured cauldron at the zenith trembled. From the surging cascade of Pristine Water, a figure in azure robes materialized, pausing in the sky with the ease of a leisurely stroll. He smiled faintly.

"Great King, aren't you being a bit unreasonable?" he said. "I only seek a single item, and I'm prepared to negotiate a fair trade. How could you call that insatiable?"

The green-backed turtle withdrew its massive form, plummeting from the sky and transforming into a sturdy, broad-faced old man clad in thick scale armor. He shot the robed figure a cold, sarcastic glance.

"If you came to negotiate, then why trap me with a Spiritual Artifact formation? Does sealing off every escape route seem like a gesture of good faith?"

Chi Buzi lowered his hands, cupping a string of dark green beads in his palm. With a gentle caress, they scattered a clear light that coalesced into a table before him. Only then did he speak, a smile playing on his lips.

"You spend most of your time in the deep sea, Great King. A single slumber could last for years, even decades. It wasn't easy to find an opportunity to speak with you. I couldn't possibly have you stand around while we talk. Consider this Spiritual Treasure formation a temporary hall of audience, erected so that I would not be a discourteous host."

The old man, the transformed Demon King, was struck speechless. After a moment's pause, he replied, "I have truly underestimated your shamelessness, Chi Buzi."

He was a Demon King who had cultivated for countless years and had long since surpassed the realm of Purple Mystery. With his extraordinary bloodline, he had no reason to fear this younger cultivator. However, a battle between them would be nothing short of cataclysmic. He had survived for so long by maintaining a low profile and had no desire for such a commotion now.

Chi Buzi smiled, seemingly aware of the Demon King's thoughts. Unperturbed, he sat at the table, produced a flask of wine from his sleeve, and said, "I have long heard of Senior Zeng Zan's esteemed reputation. Attainment in the Water Mansion Dao is rare. Tell me, Great King... how confident are you of your chances?"

Zeng Zan stared at him.

"It is not as if you are unaware of my situation, fellow Daoist Chi," he said flatly. "For one such as myself, the path of cultivation is fraught with difficulty. I hold little hope for a breakthrough in this life. My only recourse is to strive for a Dao Body in my next incarnation, and seek a higher station then."

Chi Buzi understood perfectly what he meant. Reincarnation into a human body would allow him to cultivate through the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao or the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature. He clapped his hands. "A sound plan, fellow Daoist. But have you considered seeking an Auxiliary Position, or perhaps an Intercalary Position?"

The two of them were hardly close. For Chi Buzi to raise such a topic unprompted meant he had a hidden agenda. The question was not for Zeng Zan's benefit, but a reflection of his own ambition. Zeng Zan fixed him with a stare.

"Are you seeking an Intercalary Position, fellow Daoist Chi, or an Auxiliary one?"

Chi Buzi took a sip of wine, his gaze unwavering. He made no attempt to conceal his intentions.

"I cultivate the Pristine Water Dao," he said plainly. "And I have sought you out, a true master of the Water Mansion Dao. My purpose should be obvious. The connection between our paths is clear as day."

Zeng Zan's eyes narrowed, his expression deceptively calm.

"Oh? So you have designs on the Water Mansion Dao?"

Both men were cultivators on the level of a Great Daoist Master. This was a dangerously sensitive topic. If Chi Buzi were to stake a claim on the Water Mansion Dao, their positions would inevitably clash, a conflict that could easily escalate into a battle to the death.

Chi Buzi stared at him, then raised an eyebrow. "Senior, you have witnessed ages come and go. You cannot possibly be ignorant of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. There is no need for these games."

Zeng Zan knew that Chi Buzi possessed four divine abilities. With the truth laid bare, he dropped the pretense. 

"You command four divine abilities," he said, a curious light in his eyes. 

"The Pristine Water Dao is already claimed. The volatile nature of the Pit path makes it impassable. That leaves the Daos of Converging Water, Water Mansion, and Valley Water. Why are you so fixated on mine?"

The old Demon King chuckled.

"If you are so averse to reincarnation, then fine. But the Converging Water Dao favors an Intercalary Position. To reject that path seems irrational. Is it that you do not trust the Dragon-kin?"

'Reincarnation?' Chi Buzi scoffed inwardly.

He knew exactly how petty that person was. A failsafe had been planted in his very soul. He was being given this chance to achieve his Dao only because he remained useful. If he were to reincarnate, what value would he have left? A swift death on the spot would be a mercy.

Zeng Zan, whose Dao-Profundity surpassed even Chi Buzi's after ages of cultivation, naturally understood that the Valley Water Dao was the path of reincarnation. Since Chi Buzi had rejected that option, only two choices remained.

Chi Buzi's face darkened. He watched the Demon King in silence for a moment before speaking.

"The Converging Water Dao may favor an Intercalary Position, but in the last millennium, countless cultivators have tried and failed to claim it. The conflict between the Pristine Water and Converging Water Daos is terrifyingly deep. I suspect... it is connected to the Dragon-kin's pursuit of becoming True Dragons."

"Oh?" Zeng Zan's expression shifted subtly.

"Perhaps your predecessors simply lacked the necessary Dao-Profundity. If you were to master the Converging Water Dao and break free from the Pristine Water Dao's influence, you would naturally be aligned with the Dragon-kin. When the time comes for them to achieve their ultimate form, why would they refuse another powerful ally? They would surely aid you."

"You believe the master of the Pristine Water Dao will never let you go. Without the support of the Dragon-kin, your chances of success would be even more remote!"

But Chi Buzi's eyes were sharp and clear, his conviction unshaken. His expression turned chillingly cold.

"The True Hornless Dragon was a Great Sage. How could he not know that one being cannot hold two Fruition Attainments? His fall was no accident. A great terror lies within the convergence of the Pristine and Converging Water Daos. That path clearly favors an Intercalary Position, and the Hornless Dragon lineage is vast, yet it remains limited to a single Fruition Attainment. This is by design. If I were to blindly interfere, I would be courting death. And in an era such as this? To pursue that Intercalary Position at this critical juncture would, in the eyes of the Dragon Monarch, mark me as not an ally, but a fool or a saboteur."

Zeng Zan stared at him for a long moment before nodding slowly.

"Impressive."

A cold smile touched Chi Buzi's lips.

"But if I pursue an Intercalary Position within the Water Mansion Dao, is there any reason the Dragon-kin could not support me? In this grand game, the Converging Water path is a death trap. Water Mansion is my only chance at survival."

Though his tone was firm, his eyes remained fixed on Zeng Zan's face as the old Demon King contemplated his words. Finally, Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow.

"I know you only consider reincarnation because you cannot attain the Auxiliary Position. In those years, Dongfang Ai... no, the Hornless Dragon lineage, orchestrated the loss of the Water Mansion's Vast Ocean. The Auxiliary Position has been sealed ever since. When the last True Monarch holding that position finally perished, the world's lakes and marshes withered overnight... Your plan to reincarnate is for the same goal as mine: to claim the Intercalary Position of the Water Mansion Dao."

"And if someone like me were to secure that Intercalary Position first, would I not be the perfect tool to test the Dragon Monarch's intentions on your behalf?"

Zeng Zan continued to stare. Chi Buzi said calmly,

"Lakes and marshes nurture the waters; they are complementary forces. If I succeed, how could a noble scion of the Water Mansion Dao, such as yourself, be left without a place to stand?"

Zeng Zan hesitated. "But the Dragon Monarch's relationship with the Water Mansion Dao..."

The man in cyan robes took a step forward.

"I know the Dragon Monarch does not wish to see the Water Mansion Dao grow strong," he said flatly. "An Intercalary Position might be tolerable, but by claiming it, I reveal my ambition—and potential—to seize a full Fruition Attainment. On any normal day, he would rather sacrifice me than allow the Water Mansion Dao to flourish. But today is not a normal day."

His eyes gleamed with insight.

"Today, the Dragon-kin are pursuing their ultimate goal: the Dao of the True Dragons! If they fail, the world will be thrown into upheaval. They might not even have the strength to hold the Eastern Sea, let alone spare any attention for the Water Mansion. They would surely lose control of it. In that chaos, I, at least, would be an asset they helped create, one with shared interests and a karmic link."

"And if they succeed?" A faint smile. "Then they have even less reason to worry about me. The Converging Water Dao would no longer be synonymous with the Dragon-kin. What would it matter then if the Water Mansion thrived? They would be a realm above. I would naturally fall in line, and my ambitions would become irrelevant."

The man gathered his sleeves.

"This is also why I am certain you will pursue the Water Mansion Dao in your next life. You have remained at your current stage precisely to avoid provoking the Dragon Monarch, waiting for this grand situation to resolve before making your move."

Zeng Zan watched him for a long time.

"You have calculated everything so clearly," he said in a low voice. "You understand that my own opportunity will come only after the Dragon-kin have made their move. Aren't you afraid that my own ambition will grow? That I will come to resent you for taking the first step and seizing the opportunity that should have been mine?"

Zeng Zan's tone had shifted, but Chi Buzi simply laughed.

"Of course not. The Profound Giant Turtle clan was betrayed so horribly back then. As a descendant, Senior, you live in fear. Who knows if the Dragon-kin would even permit you to ascend? From any angle you look at it, I am a far more suitable candidate."

He took another step forward, the depths of his eyes unreadable, and smiled. 

"I came here today to make one thing clear, Senior. I must achieve my Dao first. Only then will your own opportunity arise."

Zeng Zan stared, his resolve wavering.

'He... he might actually have a chance!'

The old Demon King's voice was hollow.

"What do you want?"

A light flared in Chi Buzi's eyes. His gaze shifted from Zeng Zan's face to his forehead.

"I want your horns."

The old demon was silent. Chi Buzi's voice, however, burned with ambition.

"I am currently cultivating the Morning Cold Rain of the Water Mansion Dao. It is similar to the Clear Dusk Rain, derived from an ancient, isolated text. It is a perfect method for harmonizing the Daos of Pristine Water and Water Mansion. My only problem is my lack of affinity for the Water Mansion Dao itself, which makes my progress painfully slow."

"But if I had your horns... I could grind them into a draught to be consumed annually. It would not only enhance my divine ability and dharma power, but through your bloodline as a descendant of the Profound Giant Turtle, it would grant me a greater affinity for the Water Mansion Dao."

The naked greed in his eyes was impossible to miss. Zeng Zan looked up, his gaze intense.

"I do not begrudge you a pair of old horns," he said softly. "But you, Chi Buzi, have always treated life as worthless. You are faithless, greedy, and malicious. You claim you will help me after you achieve your Dao. How could I possibly believe you?"

Chi Buzi looked momentarily stunned, then his handsome face twisted into a mask of derision as he burst out laughing.

"A promise from me? Of course you wouldn't believe it! Your assessment is perfectly correct. It is indeed uncertain whether I would help you. But Senior! If you don't help me, I will certainly retaliate after I achieve my Dao!"

He shrugged, the last vestiges of his transcendent aura vanishing completely. 

A cruel smile played on his lips.

"Or perhaps... I will simply take them myself!"

Zeng Zan stared at him, a strange feeling rising in his heart.

'Chi Wei was a villain, but he had his moments of integrity... This junior, however, is something else. He acts with brazen confidence, yet he despises morality and is utterly unscrupulous. He is a true monster, one who revels in his own evil!'

The two stood in silent opposition above the sea. The thunder overhead grew louder, a dense web of purple lightning covering the sky. Drawn by the power of Heavy Murk, the roiling clouds cascaded downward like a waterfall.

**BOOM!**

A towering wave crashed back into the ocean with a world-shaking roar. The light from the treasured cauldron abruptly receded. In Chi Buzi's hand, a pair of dark horns had appeared.

In their true form, the horns were as large as mountains, but they had been shrunk by divine ability to the size of two short swords. He held them easily in one hand. Mystical patterns, like ripples on a lake, flowed across their surface, emitting a faint white halo. They were clearly a treasure of profound power.

But Chi Buzi's attention was not on the horns. His eyes were fixed on Zeng Zan, probing his condition. The great cyan cauldron still hung in the sky, and the aura of Heavy Murk radiated a deadly pressure.

The young man stared at the old Demon King, a curious expression on his face—part concern, part something far more calculating.

"Senior..." he said softly. "Are you alright?"

'Losing his horns would surely leave the old turtle weakened. And why settle for two horns when I could have the entire creature? As for everything I just said... what does it matter if it was true or false?'

But Zeng Zan's expression was serene.

"These are the horns I shed when I broke through to the realm of Purple Mystery."

"Oh."

With that single word, all the celestial phenomena vanished. Chi Buzi showed no sign of embarrassment at his scheme being foiled. Instead, he clicked his tongue, a look of mild disappointment on his face. Clasping his hands behind his back, he held the horns and smiled.

"I have the utmost respect for you, Senior. Please don't take my little jest to heart."

Despite his words, the treasured cauldron in the sky showed no signs of being withdrawn.

Zeng Zan remained expressionless. He leaped into the air, his form blurring and expanding, transforming back into the mountain-sized, green-backed Profound Giant Turtle. He let out a deafening roar as his _true_ pair of cyan horns blazed into view, radiating the vast light of the Water Mansion.

**BOOM!**

Only after seeing this new pair of horns with his own eyes did Chi Buzi reluctantly dismiss his Spiritual Treasure. With a flick of his sleeve, he reappeared a short distance away, effortlessly dodging the lingering wisps of white light.

"Take care, Senior!" he called out politely.

With a thunderous crash of waves, the colossal turtle vanished from the sky. Chi Buzi brushed his sleeves, dispelling the lingering traces of Water Mansion energy that clung to him.

"He's lived too long," he sighed with regret. "A difficult one to fool..."

He brought the two horns before him, examining them closely. There was no joy in his expression, no satisfaction at having obtained a key treasure—only a cold, condescending scrutiny.

The wind and rain around him ceased in an instant. The confident swagger and brazen arrogance he had displayed while discussing the Water Mansion Daoist Tradition vanished like a phantom. Chi Buzi's gaze lifted from the horns in his hand and settled on the now-calm surface of the water.

In the distance, a silver-robed figure stood upon the waves.

His face was as handsome as carved jade, with sharp eyebrows angled toward his temples, a high-bridged nose, and a noble brow. A pair of long, silver horns grew from his head, and his pale blue eyes were fixed on the horizon.

Behind him, a behemoth as vast as a mountain range floated low in the water, its back bearing a sprawling complex of palaces. Chi Buzi's expression grew grave.

'A Dragon King...'

He had suspected the Dragon-kin were watching him. His expression remained unchanged as he activated a divine ability, reappearing ten paces from the massive beast. He noted that no other Demon Kings came forward to intercept him; this member of the Hornless Dragon lineage seemed to be alone, still admiring the distant scenery.

Chi Buzi narrowed his eyes.

'What immense prestige... An ordinary Dragon King would not travel with such a colossal mount. This must be a crown prince, or perhaps one who serves the Dragon Monarch directly...'

A sense of caution filled him. He moved forward slowly and bowed.

"This humble cultivator pays his respects to the Dragon King!"

The silver-robed young man did not turn his head. He simply raised a hand, gesturing for silence, his gaze fixed on the horizon with keen interest.

Unsure what this dragon was planning, Chi Buzi bowed slightly and followed his line of sight. He narrowed his eyes, and his dharma power instantly brought the hazy, distant scene into sharp focus.

'That's... Merging Fire...'
