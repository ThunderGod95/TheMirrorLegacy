# Chapter 674: Dili Family

Li Xijun had been waiting for two months when the narrow-eyed monk descended with the wind in front of the peak. Due to the newly replaced grand formation, he couldn't enter the mountain gate and could only wait in silence.

Seeing Li Xijun approaching in white robes, Kongheng remained composed, pressed his palms together, and softly said, "I heard that you successfully reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, a result of good karma. Congratulations."

Back then, Li Xijun had let him go and allowed him to seize the opportunity for a breakthrough. Kongheng was truly grateful. After offering his congratulations, he heard Li Xijun say, "Master Monk, you must be joking. What kind of good karma could come from my handling of Qingdu’s affairs? My family doesn’t believe in retribution... If such a thing truly existed, we could just sit and wait for it instead of being so fixated."

"This humble monk apologies," Kongheng chanted a Buddhist phrase.He then landed on the mountain and looked around curiously. Li Xijun led him along the mountain path and softly said, "This time, I’ve asked you to return so we can trouble you to take action and sweep the Mount Yue clean."

Li Xijun had already investigated thoroughly and added, "You, I, and Ximing will take action together to eliminate two individuals and one demon."

Li Xijun pointed toward Northern Mount Yue and said, "Jiao Zhongzi has gone missing, but in his absence, an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator named Mu Moli remains in Mount Yue. He is said to be fiercely loyal to Jiao Zhongzi and is guarding Northern Mount Yue alongside his Foundation Establishment Realm mount."

He circled that area with an ink brush and explained, "If this person is as described, there will be no room for negotiation. We must deal with him swiftly and root him out completely."

He then pointed to the remaining area in the south and continued in a low voice, "There is also a Huo Luo'e, who is at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm. If he can be persuaded to surrender, we should try. If not, we will besiege and kill him!"

The Li Family now had the foundation to back such words. Had this been twenty or thirty years earlier, they would have been laughed at. But at this moment, his words carried undeniable weight.

After Li Xijun finished speaking, Kongheng slowly closed his eyes and responded, "It seems bloodshed is inevitable!"

Li Xijun led him into the hall, placed the map down, and consoled him. He said, "These people from Mount Yue and Mount Wu are nothing good. No matter how many times we purge them, it will never be clean. Master Monk, you worry too much."

Kongheng simply looked at the densely packed village and tribe names on the map and replied, "I understand... but as your esteemed family’s forces march through, I wonder how many heads will roll and how much blood will stain Northern Mount Yue. I fear the number will not be a pleasant one."

Li Xijun furrowed his brows, momentarily speechless. Northern Mount Yue was filled with esteemed landlords and it was absolutely impossible for the Li Family to tolerate them all. Even if the killings weren’t thorough, it would still hinder future governance. How could they not kill? He could only say, "My family does not trouble the common folk. Once the pigs and dogs have been slaughtered, only then can those below have better days ahead!"

Kongheng, being an ancient cultivator, did not approve but could only agree. Only then did Li Xijun continue, "This time, I have been waiting for you because I have a matter to ask."

He had been observing Kongheng’s expression all morning and softly said, "Northern Mount Yue is different from Eastern Mount Yue. It is the ancestral land of the Yue people. Many evil shrines are hidden in the mountains, and its people have been deeply poisoned. When Jianixi was still around, there were constant uprisings. I fear this is not something that can be solved by mere slaughter."

"Master Monk, you are the most capable of swaying people's hearts in this world. Do you have a way?"

Li Xijun was thinking of things from a long-term perspective. The esteemed landlords of Northern Mount Yue were merely a matter of execution and sending people over to replace them.

However, Northern Mount Yue was the ancestral land of the Yue people and the cult of sorcery was deeply ingrained in their hearts. Human sacrifices were common and over a hundred thousand cult followers were spread across the land, with ninety-nine percent of them being mere mortals. After much thought, Li Xijun realized that the easiest way to resolve this was through Kongheng.

After Li Xijun explained everything, Kongheng’s face was filled with even greater guilt as he responded, "Using spell arts, divine abilities, Daoist scriptures, or worldly temptations to make people obey is the highest form of heresy. My Liao River Temple must not partake in such things! I am deeply ashamed!"

It was clear that asking Kongheng to sway these cult follower violated his precepts. He once again tactfully refused. Li Xijun was not too surprised by this answer and could only say with a sigh, "Then let them be killed!"

"Ah!" Kongheng was momentarily stunned but quickly reacted with a bitter smile. He responded, "Li Xijun, don't try to fool me. I have cultivated among the esteemed families for many years and I know them well."

Li Xijun chuckled and reassured him, saying, "The decline of the Liao River Dao lineage is partly due to such rigid adherence to rules... How can it possibly sustain itself if it remains so inflexible?"

Kongheng closed his eyes and replied, "The Seven Northern Dao Sects were once no different from my Liao River Temple. Yet, by opening just a single crack, they gradually became what they are today... My temple does not strive to endure but to uphold what is true."

Li Xijun said with a sigh, "If that is the case, what about the millions of common folk in the north?"

Kongheng was momentarily speechless with beads of sweat appearing on his forehead.

Li Xijun feared he might push Kongheng toward siding with the Seven Dao Sects. So he said no more about it and instead smiled. "Then, Master Monk, you only need to assist me in eliminating these few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators."

Li Xijun kept smilingas he gently set down the brush in his hand and continued, "The matters below the mountain shall be left to my family's child prodigy."

Great Jueting.

Fei Luoya’s territory was vast. Though it was mostly hilly, the plains around Great Jueting provided some stability. Over the years, as it came under Li Family rule, the population steadily grew to around fifty thousand.

Now that Fei Luoya had left with Li Xuanfeng, the land had fully fallen into the hands of the Li Family. Along with this shift, many Mount Yue cultivators either departed or pledged allegiance to the Li Family.

On the roads of Great Jueting, cavalry and soldiers galloped forward in an overwhelming procession. At the center of it all was a black carriage, glimmering with mystical light.

Black banners fluttered in the air, while the carriage wheels carved long tracks into the muddy ground. Chen Yang watched as the glow from the mountain peaks faded and lifted the curtain, speaking softly, "My heir, we have arrived at Great Jueting."

Inside the carriage, the young man sat cloaked in a heavy cloak with his boots propped on a cooled brazier. He carefully read the scroll in his hands while Chen Yang kept his head lowered respectfully and dared not steal a glance at the contents of the book.

The Jade Capital Chakra of the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm was a major bottleneck in cultivation. Over the past two years, he had only barely grasped its edges. In the meantime Li Zhouwei had already caught up to him in cultivation.

Back when they first met and fought, it could be said that he had acted hastily. Li Zhouwei had relied on his weapon's advantage to subdue him. Now, however, Li Zhouwei’s halberd arts had grown exceptionally refined. It far surpassed his own half-baked swordsmanship. In daily sparring, he was no longer a match and dared not act rashly.

Upon hearing his words, Li Zhouwei closed his book and stepped forward in the carriage. Looking carefully ahead, he saw the towering, ancient city standing before them.

The city gates, bearing the mottled scars of time, stood wide open. On either side of the road, countless esteemed families of Mount Yue knelt in submission with their heads lowered. Many had even styled their hair in the fashion of easterners, whispering among themselves as they kneeled.

He stood in silence for a moment before giving the order. "Enter the city."

As soon as Li Zhouwei's words fell, the carriage did not slow before the kneeling esteemed families of Mount Yue. Instead, it sped past them and charged straight into the city. On the way, the carriage splashed up high sprays of muddy water which caused the crowd to scatter and retreat.

Li Zhouwei remained silent while his Family soldiers marched in coldly, sealing off both sides of the road completely.

Standing at the front of the carriage, Chen Yang gazed at the sea of bowed heads below. A surge of satisfaction rose in his heart. However, now that he was fully aligned with Li Zhouwei, his cunning nature resurfaced. He reminded Li Zhouwei, saying, "My heir, you have less than a month to recruit troops here... You may still need to rely on these people. It might be worth pulling a few to our side."

Chen Yang’s words were quite reasonable. These people were all the descendants of Fei Luoya’s former subordinates. They held influence and prestige in the region. For decades, they had exploited the common folk while each controlled their own factions. The Li Family’s power was certainly above them but if they could secure their cooperation, integration would be much smoother.

After all, Li Chengliao had not provided any spirit items or provisions for this campaign. Great Jueting was already their territory. If they still required family support to raise an army here, it would undoubtedly be a sign of incompetence.

Just as Chen Yang finished speaking, he heard the rustling sound of Li Zhouwei lifting the curtain behind him, followed by the heir’s cold reply, "They are all doomed men. No need to bother with them."

Chen Yang raised an eyebrow slightly. His mind turned and quickly grasped the meaning. He replied with a smile, "Understood."

Li Zhouwei stepped out of the carriage, silently gazing at the grand city before him. He walked into the lavish yet aging main hall and stopped beside the towering throne.

He tapped his brocade boots twice against the floor, then stepped up beside the throne. He casually glanced around before turning back and said, "None of the twenty-one esteemed families in this city are innocent. Kill them all. Distribute their wealth to our forces and recruit a batch of men first."

Chen Yang nodded, but Li Zhouwei stared at him for a moment, thinking to himself, Father said this man is cunning and bold but lacks the ability to command true loyalty. If I let him go alone, resentment may rise and he might stir up a mutinous force.

Feeling uneasy about Chen Yang, Li Zhouwei took the halberd from the carriage and donned his armor. He shook out the robe behind him, mounted his horse, and said with a frown, "You will come with me."

Chen Yang mounted his horse and followed behind Li Zhouwei. Li Zhouwei pulled out a roster and selected a family with many followers but in a weakened state. Gripping the reins of his spirit horse, he called out loudly, "To the Dili Family!"

The city’s roads were uneven and full of potholes, but his heavy-set Zhongsuo spirit horse moved as if on flat ground and swiftly galloped out of the city.

In less than fifteen minutes, he reached a large village near the city’s edge. From afar, he could see people moving in and out. He reined in his horse, waiting for the guards to catch up before pulling his reins tighter and gazing toward the settlement.

Barbarians must be ruled by barbarians. To control them, one must have trusted subordinates with many followers. Yet those born into lowly and impoverished backgrounds should serve as the blade.

Dili Family Village.

Dili Youjie had spent the entire night in anxiety. Early in the morning, he was already pacing anxiously in front of the village. The bow and beast bones at his waist clang noisily, revealing his unease.
𝒇𝒓𝙚𝒆𝔀𝓮𝓫𝒏𝓸𝙫𝓮𝓵.𝓬𝙤𝙢

His Dili Family had cultivated this land for years, boasting a large population and many warriors. Yet they lacked enough shamans. This branded them as an inferior caste, forcing them to settle outside the city and provide a steady supply of sacrifices to Fu Daimu.

When this land later fell under Fei Luoya's rule, years of chaotic mismanagement caused the Dili Family to miss their opportunity for advancement. Leaving them as lowly outcasts again. However, after the transition to the Li Family, life improved significantly.

The reason was simple. Previously, the Li Family had little direct control over Great Jueting. Since most of Fei Luoya’s subordinates had settled here, the Li Family refrained from interfering too much. They were merely sending officials to survey and allocate spirit fields. It was more of a vassalage than actual rule.

But this morning, upon hearing that Li Family’s troops had entered the city, Dili Youjie found himself unable to gain an audience. Aside from growing restless within the village, he was truly at a loss for what to do.

Clop! Clop! Clop!

As the long-haired warrior was lost in thought, a sudden roar of thunderous sounds jolted him awake. As someone who had wielded strong bows and ridden fierce horses among the Mount Yue people, how could he not recognize that sound? He stiffened slightly, his expression turning to alarm. He muttered, "Cavalry?"

He abruptly lifted his head, hastily unfastening a horn from his waist. But before he could sound it, a deafening boom rang out. Above the ten-foot-tall village gate, a dark shadow soared through the sky, blocking out the blazing sun and casting a writhing silhouette below.

Dili Youjie caught a fleeting glimpse of a gleaming halberd slicing through the air. The blackened-gray armor made a harsh metallic sound and gleamed with an iron sheen of a quality Mount Yue had been unable to forge for generations.

Hsshhh...

As the hooves landed, sand and dust burst into the air, mingling with the chaotic snorts and neighs of the spirit horse. The people within the Dili village stared in shock, their minds momentarily blank. Even Dili Youjie who was usually resolute, unconsciously took a step back and his stern face turned pale.

Clang!

The halberd struck the ground, gleaming coldly through the dust. Before he could see the man clearly, a deafening clash of metal rang out. The village gate was torn to shreds. Armored eastern soldiers that were disciplined and orderly, flowed in like a relentless tide.

A few members of the Dili Family attempted resistance, but they were as helpless as lambs before these men and were subdued in mere moments. Dili Youjie immediately recognized them as the Li Family’s troops and dared not resist. He clenched his fists as he stood frozen in place.

"Ugh..."

With a heavy thud, Dili Youjie was pressed to the ground by several jade-armored soldiers. Amid the clanking of metal, cold blades pressed tightly against his neck. Their gleaming edges were sharp and menacing. More than a dozen iron spears encircled him, leaving him utterly immobilized.

In mere moments, the entire Dili Family was under control. Kneeling on the ground with disheveled hair, Dili Youjie dared not move an inch. He felt an icy chill creeping over his body.

The scorching sunlight cast a golden glow before him. Beads of sweat that were the size of soybeans dripped steadily onto the ground. Adjusting his posture slowly, Dili Youjie raised his head and met a pair of narrow eyes tinged with a faint golden hue.

The young man gave him a casual glance before surveying the surroundings, seemingly assessing the number of men present. Then, he lifted the silk document in his hand and read aloud, "Dili... Youjie?"

The voice was calm, carrying the clarity of youth. Dili Youjie, one of the most skilled hunters among the families within five kilometers and a young leader feared by many, found himself unable to meet the youth’s gaze. Hoarsely, he replied, "I pay my respects to the immortal family... My lord."

Sweat poured down his face as that gaze forced him to lower his head. With cold steel pressed against his throat, he did not dare to move. From behind, another man dismounted from his spirit horse. His expression was icy as he circled around Dili Youjie.

With long brows and gray-black eyes, the man studied Dili Youjie with an indifferent gaze, as if weighing his worth like that of a mere livestock. In a low voice, the man asked, "Your Highness... Is this man worth using?"

The youth on horseback did not answer immediately. Instead, he chuckled and asked, "Dili Youjie, the letter says you are young and capable. I am offering you an overwhelming fortune, will you take it?"

Dili Youjie had always been decisive, but never had his mind felt so clear. In a flash, he pieced everything together and responded with a trembling voice, "I give my thanks to the heir!"

Finally, he gathered the courage to meet those eyes. The eyes that were seemingly born to manipulate hearts. A dark golden hue flowed within them, sending a chill down his legs.

As Dili Youjie listened, the youth tugged his reins and the iron hooves struck the ground rhythmically. With a flick of his whip, he nudged aside the cold blade at his throat and said with amusement, "Gather your Dili Family. Ride into the city and kill!"
