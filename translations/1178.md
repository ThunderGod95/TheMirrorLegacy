# Chapter 1175: The God of Hengzhu

Spiritual items from the Hengzhu Dao Lineage rarely circulated; the vast majority remained in the hands of the Hengzhu Dao in the south. Li Ximing had never even heard of any related Spiritual Artifacts. The mere mention of one was enough to pique his interest.

Yang Ruizao sighed with emotion.

"At first, when the elders gathered to discuss King Wei's injuries, they had settled on a Horn Wood Spiritual Treasure!"

'A Horn Wood treasure would have been excellent as well…'

It mattered little which Dao lineage a treasure came from; once it reached the level of a Spiritual Treasure, its quality was assured. The Li family's current standing was quite high, yet on paper, they possessed only three such treasures. One of those, the Heavenly Nurture Urn, had been a direct gift from the Song Emperor, bypassing the Yang family entirely.

Yang Ruizao paused for a moment before continuing.

"However, His Majesty heard that your esteemed family has been in frequent consultation with the Chunyi Dao Gate. He also learned of King Wei's particular interest in that black tiger. And so, just before my departure, the Emperor sent a special envoy to have the gift exchanged for this Hengzhu Spiritual Treasure instead."

At least until now, the Song Emperor's attitude toward the Li family had always been amicable. Li Ximing didn't believe for a moment that the emperor would play tricks on him, but a sliver of doubt pricked at his heart.

He asked, a smile playing on his lips, "The black tiger?"

Yang Ruizao let out a hearty laugh.

"Precisely! The black tiger King Wei captured—was it not intended to be a mount?"

The confusion in Li Ximing’s heart deepened.

When the Li family acquired a demon beast, it was publicly understood that the Heavenly Nurture Urn was used to refine it and extract spiritual resources. As the urn's former owners, the Yang family would be keenly aware of this… An ordinary demon beast would be one thing, but a creature of the Buddhist Lands? Why would anyone think of it as a mount?

Though his mind was racing, Li Ximing’s smile only broadened.

"The Profound Court is far to the south, yet it seems to know everything. Zhaojing is endlessly grateful."

His words were like needles wrapped in cotton, and Yang Ruizao's heart jolted in regret.

'He's a Daoist Master of the Purple Mansion Realm, after all. He's bound to have a temper… I overstepped. I've angered him!'

A thin sheen of cold sweat broke out on his brow.

"You speak too gravely, Daoist Master," he said quickly. "This beast belongs to the Buddhist Lands; it is no Maha. Though its divine abilities and dharma power are intact, it cannot enter the Immortal Dao. Even if it were placed within the Heavenly Nurture Urn, nothing could be extracted from it. When the elders saw no celestial phenomenon of a sky filled with lotuses, they suspected King Wei lacked a mount and intended to tame this beast for that purpose."

The string of words struck Li Ximing with the force of a shocking revelation.

'So the black tiger can't be rendered into spiritual resources!'

During the war between north and south, they had captured both a Merciful One and the black tiger, placing them in the urn. After returning to the lake, the tiger was to be used for a ritual sacrifice. The Merciful One, having no immediate purpose, was simply left suppressed inside the spiritual urn, forgotten.

Because he had intended the tiger for a ritual, he would never have used the urn's power of extraction. Naturally, he had remained ignorant of this peculiarity!

But from the Yang family's perspective, the Li clan taking in two Buddhist cultivators and making no move must have held some deeper meaning. After much deliberation, it seemed they couldn't decipher the Li family’s intentions and concluded they planned to make use of the demon.

The moment his thoughts cleared, Li Ximing’s spiritual sense connected with the treasure in his sleeve. His face filled with emotion as he replied with a smile,

"I fear the envoy will laugh, but our family initially captured this demon beast precisely to extract its spiritual resources. It was only after bringing it back to the lake and examining it closely that we discovered it was useless for that purpose."

He paused, his tone shifting as he sighed.

"You see… King Wei is gravely injured and in death seclusion, unable to be seen. How could I presume to act on my own authority? So I suppressed it along with the other Merciful One and extracted some information about the Northern Buddhists from them. As for making it a mount…"

He shook his head.

"We considered it, but it is exceedingly difficult. Its very life-mandate is bound to the Buddhist Lands. How could it ever be freed?"

He deftly deflected, weaving a story of half-truths and leaving the problem at Yang Ruizao's feet. A look of understanding dawned in the black-robed man's eyes. He nodded subtly and said at once,

"It is not entirely without a solution. While a creature of the Buddhists cannot enter the Immortal Dao, it can be raised to the Shengyang Acupoint and cast into the Demonic Dao to be reforged within a Diverse Mansion. Though most of its life-mandate would be destroyed in the process, it is a path nonetheless."

Li Ximing was, in fact, familiar with the method he described.

In the strictest sense, the Immortal Dao was the ancient Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature, which was nearly impossible for a Buddhist adherent to enter. The Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao, however—while called the modern Immortal Dao by some—was in truth an unorthodox path. As such, it was a convenient destination for those leaving the Buddhist faith.

Entering the Buddhist Lands was easy; leaving was harder than ascending to the heavens. Though a method of escaping into the Demonic Dao existed, it was a path where one was more likely to die than live. Throughout history, almost no one had attempted it. Unless one could ride the tremendous fortune of a world-altering era, success would still mean a drastic fall in cultivation. And this was a mere Merciful One—it possessed no significant divine abilities or dharma power to begin with and had fallen to the level of a Foundation Establishment demon beast. Who would even give it a second glance?

"That path is impassable," Li Ximing said, shaking his head.

But Yang Ruizao smiled.

"Besides the Demonic Dao, is there not also the long-extinct Divine Dao?"

Seeing Li Ximing frown in surprise, Yang Ruizao continued in a pleasant tone,

"That is precisely why this treasure was chosen as a gift. The Mystic Tablet Edict Pill hails from the Hengzhu Dao Lineage. It has the power to weigh the gravity of a life-mandate and balance the merits of sacrifice, thereby creating a blessed god and establishing its place. This artifact has lain idle in the capital, but it could be used to enthrone a god for Ting Province!"

At these words, Li Ximing’s frown deepened.

"Enthrone a god?"

It wasn't as if the Li family had never seen items capable of creating minor gods. Li Ximing himself had once acquired a Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman from the Capital Guard Dao Lineage. In the current era, however, nearly all such miraculous powers were greatly diminished; the minor deities they created were so fragile they couldn't withstand a single blow.

Thus, hearing of this ability, Li Ximing was already secretly disappointed.

Yang Ruizao, however, just smiled.

"Exactly! The ancient methods of enthronement were many. Some created from nothing, others relied on the power of mountains and rivers, and still others were based on one's mortal destiny. The two Rituals also possess methods of enthronement. The Azure Proclaimation can even enthrone living beings to govern spirit mountains. The Hengzhu (Balanced Ritual), on the other hand, typically employs spell arts, leaving the blessing within another's body by means of a talisman or pill."

Yang Ruizao explained,

"This Spiritual Treasure contains a wondrous art known as the Blessing of Divinity. Once you have refined the treasure, you can implant this art into the body of a demon beast. Then, by providing it with various spiritual resources, you can seize its life-mandate entirely and transform it into a god!"

A faint smile touched his lips as he picked up the jade slip lying nearby.

"This art is complex. Without the cooperation of a Hengzhu cultivator, nine out of ten attempts will fail. This jade slip, however, contains the experiences of predecessors who used this art. When used in conjunction with the secret incantations recorded within, the rate of success can be greatly increased."

The other party had clearly put a great deal of thought into this. Li Ximing's interest was finally kindled. He raised an eyebrow.

"How powerful would it be? Could it stand against a Merciful One?"

He didn't hold out much hope, but Yang Ruizao shook his head with great solemnity.

"Daoist Master misunderstands. The pure methods of enthronement have all but vanished in our time. Even a Spiritual Treasure, borrowing power from another Dao, could never create something comparable to a divine ability—but the Hengzhu Dao Lineage is the sole exception. This is because its 'position' is manifest."

'The master of that 'position' in the Hengzhu lineage… is still in the south!'

Li Ximing was stunned into a respectful silence. The man before him raised his eyebrows gravely.

"Though the art is fraught with difficulties, and the black tiger in your possession is a Merciful One—an extremely special case—if this method is used to bypass the Buddhist Lands and achieve apotheosis, I fear its power may rival what it once was!"

Li Ximing stared at him in disbelief and repeated, "A divine ability?"

The black-robed envoy smiled.

"Otherwise, why do you think this artifact was something cultivators of that era scrambled to imitate?"

He gazed at Li Ximing and held out his hand. "This is merely one of this Spiritual Treasure's three divine arts! In the hands of a Hengzhu cultivator, this particular art would be greatly amplified, and it would even unlock a fourth!"

His gaze was heavy with meaning.

"The Emperor went personally to retrieve this treasure. Were it not for him, this artifact would have been kept in a vault for countless years as a supreme national treasure to anchor the fate of the empire!"

Only then did Li Ximing finally comprehend the true weight of this gift from the Song Emperor, Yang Zhuo. This wasn't the Heavenly Nurture Urn, with its incomplete Dao Lineage. It wasn't the Pure Yang Bracelets, forged as a mere ceremonial gift. And it was certainly not the recently crafted Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument. This was an authentic, supreme-grade Spiritual Treasure that had survived from antiquity, an artifact that had once set the standard for all refiners in the world!

To put it bluntly, this item alone was more than enough to repay Li Zhouwei's service and achievements.

'So what he means is… the Song Emperor played a little trick against the Yang family. He swapped the treasures at the last minute, forcing the Yangs to bestow this one instead…'

A wave of shock and joy washed over Li Ximing, mixed with a hint of flattered disbelief. With a look of profound gratitude, he bowed deeply. 

"The Emperor's grace is boundless!"

Yang Ruizao nodded with a smile. Li Ximing finally lifted his sleeve, reached out, and picked up the pill-shaped Spiritual Treasure. It had a silver base with crimson patterns, and he saw streams of dark gold flowing across its surface amidst a swirl of iridescent colors. It was incredibly heavy.

Though also a pill-shaped treasure, it was worlds apart from the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, which pulsed with golden threads as if alive. This one was bone-chillingly cold, like a lump of silvered iron in his palm. When he probed it with his Bright Yang divine ability, he felt a bottomless depth. He raised an eyebrow.

"This item… it's unrefined?"

"This was originally part of a set, the Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity," Yang Ruizao explained quickly. "Powerful as this pill is, it is only one-fifth of the whole. That makes it difficult to transfer ownership. Unless it passes from the hands of one 'Whole Pill' cultivator to another, even a Hengzhu cultivator would have to refine it from scratch!"

"How peculiar."

His own Radiant Sun King's Halberd had a similar trait. Li Ximing nodded with a smile and carefully stored the treasure within his divine ability. He cupped his hands.

"I still hold another Merciful One within my Heavenly Nurture Urn. On behalf of Ting Province, I offer it to His Majesty. Please escort it back to be executed before the Imperial Court, to display the might of True Qi!"

A flicker of delight appeared in Yang Ruizao's eyes.

"Excellent! The Daoist Master is truly righteous!"

The Merciful One was useless in his hands anyway; it was better to use it to repay the Song Emperor's favor. Li Ximing smiled and returned the courtesy, and with a shared understanding, saw him off. When they reached the Wilderness, a purple light flared between Yang Ruizao's brows. Waves of True Qi surged from his body as the power of his Martial Cultivation slowly returned.

Only then did Li Ximing produce the urn from his sleeve. With a light toss into the wind, it swelled to the size of a mountain peak, its black, gaping mouth like a gateway to another world. A young boy stood within the opening and bowed his head deeply.

"Greetings to the two sirs!"

Li Ximing was at ease outside, all thanks to Shi'er supervising inside. He glanced inside and saw two patches of Buddhist light at opposite ends of the pitch-black space. The Buddhist cultivator was meditating in the east with his eyes closed. The black tiger was curled up in the west, its body covered in wounds, warily watching its fellow adherent.

The moment Li Ximing appeared, the faces of both the man and the demon changed. Yang Ruizao, however, gave them no chance to speak. He produced a bronze ding from his sleeve, shone it upon the Merciful One, and dragged him out, ignoring his pleas for mercy completely.

Li Ximing glanced over at the black tiger. It lay in the corner, its fractured eyes fixed on the ground, seeming to endure its hatred in silence.

'So it's a loyal one.'

Li Ximing gave a short, derisive laugh and stepped out of the Spiritual Treasure. Yang Ruizao, holding the Merciful One, looked at Li Ximing as if nothing had happened.

"Jiangliang will handle the remaining affairs. I have urgent matters to attend to and cannot delay. If an imperial decree comes in the future, it will be Ruizao who returns to Ting Province. I hope… you will look after me then."

A chill went down Li Ximing's spine. He nodded thoughtfully, but his mind quickly drifted, filled with joyous contemplation of the treasures in his sleeve. Beside him, Li Jiangliang, who had been waiting patiently, finally looked up. After asking about his father Li Zhouwei's condition, he hesitated.

"There is one more thing I must report to the Daoist Master."

Li Ximing looked at him with a smiling, questioning gaze. Li Jiangliang spoke with great solemnity.

"This junior… is about to seek a divine ability!"

A flicker of surprise crossed the Daoist Master's face. He pinched his fingers together in a quick calculation, then sighed with feeling.

"Yes… it is about time!"

Li Zhouwei's current state, without a single trace of Wu Light, was something that could never be seen by the public. Li Ximing's eyes softened.

"At such a critical time, a father and son should be allowed to meet. It is a shame that things are as they are… If there is anything the family can do to help, you must not hesitate to ask."

"There is no need to disturb Father!" Li Jiangliang's expression was complex, tinged with pain. He lifted his head.

"As a Holder of the Profound, the risk of my breakthrough is much smaller, and the time required is shorter. It's just… it's just that for people like us, who attain a divine ability after being a Holder of the Profound, we can never escape the light of the Martial Cultivation Star or the court of True Qi for the rest of our lives."

His voice was calm, but it held a terrifying undercurrent of repression. Li Ximing froze. After a long moment, he whispered,

"Then you… returning to Ting Province in the future…"

Li Jiangliang slowly shook his head.

"It is not like the Buddhist cultivators, who surrender their very life-mandates. But from this day forward, my divine ability will forever be bound to True Qi. I may no longer be a Holder of the Profound, but I can never escape the watch of Martial Cultivation nor shed my official position at court. Should that connection be severed for even a single day, my Shengyang Acupoint will fall. It will not be as simple as regressing to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Even if I manage to survive, my divine ability will drain away like water through sand!"

He said quietly, "This junior… had anticipated this situation and is not surprised. But I held onto a foolish hope that one day I could return to the lake and serve the family. I never imagined it was all just a delusion."

"This trip is also to bid farewell to my homeland."

Li Ximing felt a complex mix of emotions that he couldn't put into words as he stared deeply at the golden-eyed young man before him.

'No wonder… There are no free gifts in this world. In this way, the Song Emperor holds their very divine abilities in his hand! Even if he would never treat his subjects harshly… they are ultimately under his control!'

He had long heard rumors of the 'Spirit-strangulation' that came from borrowing heavily from the external Profound Mystery, but hearing it described so starkly now, he was still struck by its cruelty. He pondered for a long time before asking in a low voice, "How many people know of this?"

Li Jiangliang averted his gaze, no longer meeting his eyes.

"This junior does not know," he said softly.
