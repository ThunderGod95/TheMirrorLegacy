# Chapter 840: I Should Not Enter

His tone was resolute, and his eyes were sharp. His sword was lifted high, and shed sword essence bright as frost, exuding an ethereal air. No longer the coward from before, white mist rose beneath his feet as he flew into the hall.

Li Xuanfeng naturally followed close behind, golden bow glowing as he sped forward. The round grand hall was somewhat empty, with a few square cauldrons placed about. A jade platform, radiating brilliant white light, stood at the center. The jade platform had eight corners and was shaped like a blooming lotus. A jade box, etched with intricate golden patterns, gently floated in the air above the platform.

The hall alternated between light and shadow. Golden light lit up the ceiling, where talismans hung from red threads at varying heights, swaying and colliding in the gust stirred by the two intruders.

The highest seat of law glowed dimly. Its armrests were shaped like phoenixes, and the large screen behind bore complex patterns, converging brightly at the center to form one large word, Sima.

Not Si... It’s Sima...

Si Yuanli didn’t even glance at the jade platform. He rode the wind straight past it and reached for the tall desk. Sure enough, a scroll lay upon it. It was seemingly ordinary, without a trace of dharma light.

What a lavish grand hall...

He stepped right up to it in two strides. Li Xuanfeng, as expected, reached for the gold-patterned jade box atop the jade platform. The platform had no real protective measures, only a thin light film covering its aura. Li Xuanfeng simply reached out and grasped it.

The gold-patterned jade box was scorching hot. It radiated searing heat as it landed in his hand, a warm breeze brushing across his face. A single gesture allowed Li Xuanfeng to pull down most of the golden talismans in the hall and stuff them into his pouch in one breath.

Meanwhile, his spiritual sense slipped into the jade box, where a streak of red-golden brilliance darted back and forth. It scorched his spiritual sense, causing his heart to thump as he wondered, This looks like...

Si Yuanli had already retrieved the scroll and was fleeing the hall. Li Xuanfeng, neither careless nor greedy, swiftly followed him back to the entrance. There, he spotted a letter and an incense burner on a small table. He grabbed them just in time and stored them away.

His spiritual sense was still checking the gold-patterned jade box when a sudden thought struck like lightning, Fiery red like gold, darting like light... It must be the Supreme Yang Sun Essence...

The joy stayed in his mind for only a moment before shock struck his heart, and the item in his hand suddenly felt even more scalding. He quickly reviewed everything, Si Yuanli made it sound nice, saying, 'take whatever you want'... but a spirit item like the Supreme Yang Sun Essence isn't something ordinary cultivators can keep... Now we took the jade box, those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators may very well have seen it. If I walk out of Great Ning Palace with this in hand, they’ll surely suspect me. Am I not walking into death?

His heart was clear, When he said 'take freely,' it was likely only referring to those golden talismans and common items. As for the rest, how could one justify keeping them to oneself...

He kept the gold-patterned jade box in hand, since he dared not place it in his storage pouch. Doing so would surely raise suspicion upon exit. Though scalding hot, Li Xuanfeng calmly raised the spirit item and handed it to Si Yuanli, speaking in a steady tone, "This rightfully belongs to your esteemed family. I, Xuanfeng, dare not keep it for myself."

Si Yuanli rode the wind at full speed, scanning both sides carefully. He paused in surprise when he heard these words. As he reached out to take it back, the scorching heat met his hand, and his spiritual sense jolted. He immediately understood.

He quickly stowed it away, asking no questions. Instead, he solemnly said, "Once we are out of Great Ning Palace, I will explain everything in detail."

The implications of his words only struck Si Yuanli once they left his lips. He considered explaining further but felt it would only make matters worse. Li Xuanfeng, however, instantly understood, Ah... so it really is the Sima Family.

Si Yuanli had moved with practiced ease the whole time, and Li Xuanfeng had already harbored suspicions. His doubts had only increased once Si Yuanli had produced the exact two talismans needed.

Though Si Boxiu was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, the sky was filled with many others of that realm, especially Maha and the Merciful One. Who among them couldn’t see through Si Boxiu’s plans? Why, then, was Si Yuanli the only one to have come all this way in disguise?

Putting it all together with the Sima character in the hall, Li Xuanfeng realized this grand hall belonged to the Si Family. When he asked casually, Si Yuanli wasn’t paying attention and responded without thought, effectively confirming it.

So the Si Family really does hail from Ning State... or at least has a branch there... In any case, Si Yuanli played dumb the whole way just to achieve his goal.

They split up the moment they entered the grotto heaven. It seems even Si Boxiu might be wary of the Chi Family.

If Li Xuanfeng could see this much, how could the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators high above, let alone the Mahas, miss it?

Now that Si Yuanli had retrieved the item, he no longer bothered to conceal anything and said solemnly, "Though I feigned ignorance all the way, many northern cultivators are already aware of the southern situation. They are guarding against my clan; it will come sooner than expected."

Just as he finished speaking, black demonic mist rose from the lake beneath them and chased after the two. These devil cultivators had seemingly intended to enter the hall but suddenly changed direction and veered toward them instead.

Li Xuanfeng turned with bow in hand, firing two arrows in rapid succession like shooting stars. They streaked into the demonic mist, and golden light burst beneath his feet, forcing several of the devils back.

While Li Xuanfeng blocked the pursuing devil cultivators, Si Yuanli also drew his sword and soared into the sky. His stance was entirely different from before. Though he was not widely known, he had cultivated at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm for years. His longsword was elegant and powerful, its light gathering into true sword essence.
𝒻𝑟𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝑛𝘰𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝘤𝘰𝘮

A flick of his sword in midair struck down a crimson blade with a sudden bang. He reversed his grip and flung out a burst of bright sword essence, speaking in a low voice, "Brother Xuanfeng, be careful."

Li Xuanfeng remained composed. The golden string in his hand quivered, releasing a burst of golden light that shot down a demon in the mist.

Si Yuanli muffled a grunt as he muttered, "Brother Xuanfeng!"

Just as he spoke, four gold-robed master monks appeared around them, each taking a position at one of the cardinal directions. Their expressions were calm, and their chests half-bared.

They each had a different weapon—saber, spear, staff, and cudgel—and they spoke in unison, "You two benefactors have grown far too greedy!"

The massive cauldron floated beside Si Yuanli, glowing with a mesmerizing blue radiance. The two of them had taken the most precious items from the cave dwelling, and the two sky-reaching talismans had caused such a stir that all of Great Ning Palace had noticed. They were now obvious targets.

Li Xuanfeng’s gaze swept across the four identical monks. In the distance, several more clouds of demonic mist were rushing toward them. Sensing danger, he raised his golden bow again, a crimson-gold arrow leaping into place.

Si Yuanli also knew they couldn’t afford to be surrounded by these four. He activated his Immortal Foundation mana and his green robe turned white.

Snowflakes fell around him as he flicked his sword and said coldly, "North!"

Sword light burst from his blade, transforming into ethereal mist that fell like white snow. Though it appeared otherworldly and light, each flake was deadly. It was the Si Family's Pinewhite Full Essence Sword Art.

The crimson-gold glow also vanished from Li Xuanfeng's bowstring. A piercing whine echoed through the air as the northern Buddhist cultivator’s expression darkened. He raised his long staff high while the other three slowly closed their eyes, channeling their golden light toward him.

"Haah!"

Just as he shouted, he was immediately shredded by the blizzard of sword light. The monk had only just opened his eyes when a massive gash was torn through his throat. Astral Qi mixed with crimson-gold light sprayed forth, nearly ripping his body apart.

Si Yuanli’s sword essence was far stronger than the monk had expected. Most of the golden energy he had prepared to counter Li Xuanfeng was spent resisting the sword strikes, leaving him open to the arrow that had arrived.

Li Xuanfeng drew his bow again but saw that the Northern Master Monk’s body had melted like mud, his glow shifting until he became another spear-wielding monk. Si Yuanli furrowed his brow, but just then, a devil cultivator had raced ahead of the group and was nearly on them.

Clang!

The black-clad devil cultivator drew his spear in a flash of black light. The weapon surged like a dragon, striking fiercely at the Buddhist cultivator. Si Yuanli was momentarily stunned by the devil cultivator’s choice, but immediately seized the chance, raising another storm of white sword light.

"You—!"

The spear-wielding Buddhist cultivator was clearly shocked and had no choice but to raise his spear to parry. The two spears collided midair with a thunderous boom. Li Xuanfeng let out a slow breath, feeling his mana surge and ebb within him, and raised a crimson-gold arrow to his bow once again.

Buzz!
𝒻𝑟𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝑛𝘰𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝘤𝘰𝘮

Four currents of mana intertwined in an instant. The spear-wielding Buddhist cultivator had just parried with his weapon and couldn’t react in time. He was struck head-on by the white mist and the crimson-gold arrow.

He let out a cry of pain. "Ah!"

His body was blasted to ashes, leaving only a head flying high into the air. The four-man encirclement collapsed at once, and the glow on the remaining three dimmed. Li Xuanfeng and Si Yuanli didn’t bother with a follow-up strike and rode the wind northward without hesitation.

After speeding half a kilometer away, Li Xuanfeng glanced back, only to see that the black-robed devil cultivator had been exceptionally devious. He had stabbed the severed head with his spear but deliberately kept it alive, parading it about as he dashed off southward with the bald head.

"Zhong Qian..."

This man was none other than Zhong Qian, who had been dispatched under Daoist Master Chang Yun’s command. He hadn’t exchanged a single word with Li Xuanfeng. He hadn’t even spared him a glance, and simply dashed southward with the head impaled on his spear.

The remaining three Buddhist cultivators were caught in a dilemma. Neither north nor south was ideal. After hesitating in the air for a breath, they ultimately chose to abandon their fallen companion and resumed chasing the two cultivators.

But Si Yuanli and Li Xuanfeng had already flown far ahead. The sword cultivator from the Si Family laughed loudly and hurled several streaks of sword light as he mockingly shouted, "Bald donkeys! Chase me again and I’ll string up the rest of your three heads too!"

As he roared with laughter, a sheet of red erupted in the northern sky. Blazing True Flame surged skyward, igniting the clouds above. A burly man in dark crimson robes, holding a cauldron under one arm, swaggered proudly as he laughed, "Murong, you old dog! You can’t even catch your granddaddy with just four of you!"

It was none other than Gao Fangjing, cultivator of True Flame. He had snatched away two great cauldrons and brazenly soared into the sky, drawing the gaze of many. A swarm of devil cultivators swarmed toward him, drastically reducing the pressure on the two of them.

Si Yuanli cheered, "Good man! I love this kind of unruly brute!"

Li Xuanfeng looked at the sky filled with blazing True Flame. The tension in his bowstring slowly eased as he observed silently, a doubt arising in his heart, Something's not right... The Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman hasn’t even been used yet. This is far from over.

Just as Li Xuanfeng slowed, a murmur reached their ears, "Yuanli, give the Huai River Map to Xuanfeng."

The voice was aged and solemn; it was none other than Daoist Master Yuan Xiu. Li Xuanfeng paused slightly. Si Yuanli fended off an approaching devil cultivator with his sword and handed the scroll over without hesitation.

Li Xuanfeng accepted it in stride. The murmur of incantations once again sounded in his ear as Yuan Xiu transmitted the scroll’s spell. As he memorized it in silence, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth suddenly shifted.

Rumble!

Some kind of restriction was seemingly triggered at the cliff in the center of Great Ning Palace. A radiant column of iridescent light surged skyward, lighting up several kilometers. It was clearly visible from across the lake.

A faint circular arc appeared in the sky, and a rain of pale droplets began to fall. Li Xuanfeng’s eyes narrowed as he slowly recalled the appearance of Mirage Mirror Heaven at Green Pine Temple. At last, his lingering doubts were resolved, So this is where you were waiting for me.

A grotto heaven...

Everyone within Great Ning Palace looked up and listened before rushing toward the cliff in a frenzy.

Si Yuanli, however, seemed unsurprised as he turned to Li Xuanfeng, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng, shall we head in now?"

Li Xuanfeng was about to respond when he suddenly felt his instincts twinge. A strong sense of danger had suddenly surged in his heart. The talisman seeds that had lain dormant in his qi sea for years stirred slightly, causing his two Immortal Foundations to tremble faintly.

I shouldn’t enter?

Alarm bells rang in Li Xuanfeng’s mind. He quietly looked up and saw the semicircular grotto heaven in the sky gradually revealing its colors. A crystalline glow shimmered brilliantly in the center. It was perhaps some treasure.

I shouldn’t go in...

A chill rose in Li Xuanfeng's heart. But Yuan Xiu hadn’t just sent him here for the Great Ning Palace. There was no retreat now. He could only stall for time and said thoughtfully, "We have great treasures on us; we shouldn’t act rashly. There might be devil cultivators lying in wait near that light column... I’ve expended much mana fleeing from all those cultivators, might I rest briefly and regulate my qi?"

His words took Si Yuanli by surprise. The middle-aged man suddenly realized Li Xuanfeng hadn’t stopped drawing his bow for the entire chase, and had even stepped in to protect him earlier, so his mana might truly be low.

He quickly said, "Indeed, no need to rush. Let us pause for a moment and proceed slowly by windflight."

————

World within the mirror.

Nestled among grey-black peaks, a pale moon-colored palace atop a raised platform shimmered faintly. The clouds above had scattered, releasing beams of radiant light.

The light in the sky was dim, and the wisp of Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence hung there like a sun, illuminating the great void beyond. One could faintly glimpse various Mahas and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators seated in formation around Great Ning Palace.

Li Xuanfeng had been drawn into the conflict between Maha and Zipei, which involved multiple Mahas and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Lu Jiangxian had been quietly watching from the side. It was he who had forcibly sealed the talisman seeds in Li Xuanfeng’s body, rendering them unresponsive to the divine abilities of Mahas and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. It had saved him much effort in concealment.

His gaze pierced through the veil, landing on the scene within the great void. Anhuai Heaven, resembling a translucent glass orb, was slowly approaching the mortal realm. The images within it were becoming clearer by the moment.
