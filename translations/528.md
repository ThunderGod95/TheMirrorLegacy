# Chapter 801: Captured Alive

The two cultivators attacked together. Li Xizhi formed a spell with one hand and wielded his sword with the other, leaping out of their encirclement and scattering patches of golden-red rainbow lights. Sweat appeared on his forehead as he finally found the chance to properly examine his opponents.

One of them had a dignified and sturdy appearance. He was neatly dressed and held a dark purple-black jar densely covered with intricate white patterns. His eyes were wide, filled with uncertainty.

The other man had a fierce and greedy look. He was taller than his companion and wore a black robe. Layers of white mist continuously drifted from him, coiling around him like agile serpents.

When he saw Li Xizhi easily escaping their encirclement, the devil cultivator holding the jar transmitted a hasty message using divine sense, “Fellow Daoist Qiu! This person is difficult to deal with. You're familiar with the local situation, do you know anything about him?”

The ears of the burly devil cultivator stepping on the white mist twitched. His aggressive gaze swept over Li Xizhi’s robe without hiding his intentions, and he replied darkly, “Brother Ge... judging from his appearance, he's probably from the Azure Pond Sect. He has many treasures, and it seems he's injured. You and I... let’s seize this opportunity and rob him!”

Devil cultivator Ge nodded slowly. Both of them were devil cultivators summoned from the region of Xu State. They were not trusted retainers of the Murong Family, so they had always intended to make a significant profit. When they saw Li Xizhi in poor condition, their greed immediately started to rear its head.

Li Xizhi calmly regulated his breath and transmitted a mana message. Li Quantao and Yu Yuwei had already suppressed their devil cultivator opponents and had spare attention to observe him, relieving him greatly.

But the two devil cultivators before him allowed no openings. Devil cultivator Ge finally made the decision to throw out his purple-black jar. A burst of gray smoke emerged from it and was swept forward by the wind toward Li Xizhi.

Rainbow light shone from Li Xizhi’s hand as he activated his defensive spell, Dawn Wind Stabilizer. Two arcs of rainbow light rippled outward like waves on water. The Heavenly Glow Dao lineage wasn't known for defense, and Li Xizhi’s technique was already one of the rare respectable defensive arts in the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique manual.

His injuries made his spell appear dimmer than usual. It should have dispersed the enemy’s attack outright, but now it merely pushed back the gray smoke, temporarily restraining the opponent’s momentum.

Li Xizhi was inwardly startled, his heart sinking, These two aren’t ordinary devil cultivators!

But devil cultivator Qiu had already lunged forth on white mist, and instantly appeared before him. He combined two clumps of white mist in his hand, and forcibly ripped through the rippling rainbow light.

The white mist sizzled on contact with mana. It was seemingly designed to neutralize enemy spells, as it instantly turned mana into ashes. The Dawn Wind Stabilizer only briefly delayed him as his hand shot directly toward Li Xizhi’s chest.

Li Quantao, who was observing the situation from the side, immediately sensed something was wrong. His heart skipped a beat as he shouted, “Senior Yu!”

His shout rang out like thunder. Yu Yuwei activated his Immortal Foundation to the fullest, shaking out two purple-red flames from his sleeves that intercepted the devil cultivator facing Li Quantao. A massive purple-red cauldron hurtled through the air, instantly forcing the two devil cultivators into disarray.

Li Quantao tapped his chest and spat out a radiant pearl. The pearl released dazzling streams of light, dispersing the demonic clouds into a few small dark patches. Clear droplets rose from beneath the pearl and merged into the clouds.

“Water Wall Pearl!”

Clang...

Cultivator Qiu’s attention suddenly shifted away from Li Xizhi, eyes widening in surprise. Devil cultivator Ge similarly lost his composure, excitement and greed surfacing on his face as he cried out, “What a powerful dharma artifact! Could it be an ancient relic? A Water Mansion ancient dharma artifact?”

The Water Wall Pearl’s power was astonishing as it nearly dispersed the spirit winds under their feet. The bright and lustrous white pearl hovered silently in the air. It was clearly extraordinary. Rather than fear, the two devil cultivators felt joy, as their attention was immediately captured by the artifact.

As both devil cultivators momentarily froze, Li Xizhi felt the pressure ease. Li Quantao stepped forward, gripping the artifact and shouting loudly, “Brother Zhi... I’m here to help you!”

Yet, at that moment, both devil cultivators erupted in sudden fury. Devil cultivator Qiu’s black robes billowed violently as white mist uncontrollably surged from his seven orifices along with bursts of blood. The mist spiraled like a storm across his shoulders and back around his face.

At the same time, Devil cultivator Ge bit off the tip of his tongue, spitting out a mouthful of blood. The jar in his hand flashed with crimson light, expanding several times in size. Gray smoke burst forth like competing snakes racing forward.

“So decisive... Northern devil cultivators...”

Both devil cultivators simultaneously used techniques that burned their own lifeblood and vitality without hesitation. Gray and white mists swept forward together, startling Li Quantao greatly.

Focused entirely on aiding Li Xizhi, Li Quantao hadn’t anticipated their sudden and nearly suicidal attack. He hastily threw out the Water Wall Pearl to intercept the incoming mists.

Li Xizhi naturally wouldn’t stand idle. Gathering his mana, he drew his sword swiftly, a brilliant sword-light erupting from its sheath, aimed sharply at devil cultivator Qiu’s back.

A loud explosion echoed. The shattered waves of gray and white mist caused intense pain in Li Xizhi’s eyes, causing tears to stream down his face. His sword seemed to have struck something, but devil cultivator Qiu had vanished into the white mist.

A pale Li Quantao staggered back several steps. The Water Wall Pearl had saved his life again, absorbing nearly sixty percent of their combined attack. The pearl continued hovering, still as radiant as ever.

But the strength belonged entirely to the artifact, not Li Quantao himself. Despite the pearl absorbing most of the damage, Li Quantao had clearly suffered significantly from the strike. So, he quickly recalled the pearl.

Li Xizhi moved swiftly to his side with a flash of Gold In Cloud, spreading a sleeveful of Heavenly Glow. He noticed devil cultivator Qiu’s astonished expression, blood still visible on his cheeks due to excessive mana consumption.

Devil cultivator Qiu questioned suspiciously, “The Li Family of Lijing?”

Li Xizhi was uncertain how Qiu recognized him, but judging by the mention of the Li Family of Lijing, it likely concerned events from years past. His expression grew solemn, but he remained silent.

Devil cultivator Ge, disappointed in Qiu’s hesitation, immediately started to curse, “Qiu Ji! You damned idiot! Why hesitate at this critical time?! Hurry up and seize that artifact! There’ll be nothing left for us when others gather!”

Qiu Ji glared darkly at him, secretly harboring distrustful thoughts, There’s only one artifact, how could the two of us share it? I’ve fought with this family before... They’re strong! I also heard they’re a sword immortal clan. They might have hidden trump cards.

I should’ve tricked old Ge into blocking those talismans swords... Better if he dies without a corpse, so I can naturally take the artifact. It’s a perfect outcome. But since things remain unsettled, I must first kill one person with full force.

Sinister and terrifying white mist surged violently in his hands, as he recklessly fueled them with his vitality.

Even as he observed the pair closely, Li Xizhi noticed dozens of immortal lights approaching from the south. His heart quickened slightly, There are many immortals that are certainly coming. Aunt might not leave Mount Yan Pass, but perhaps my own family, or even the Yang Family, will arrive...

The Heavenly Glow in his hand shifted slightly as he thought. It didn’t attack the two cultivators, but instead soared upward through layers of clouds toward the dozens of approaching immortal lights.

However, this brief delay caused Li Quantao to instantly spat out blood. His strength was modest, since he was only at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He relied entirely on the ancient dharma artifact in his possession.

Though the Water Wall Pearl could block most attacks due to its indestructible nature, the two devil cultivators before him were cunning. Their increasingly tricky spells caused Li Quantao to repeatedly cough up blood.

Now, Li Quantao didn't even have the mental capacity to pay attention to Li Xizhi’s actions. His spirits sank further as the foreboding sense of impending death gradually overcame him.

The Water Wall Pearl had enabled Li Encheng, at the early Foundation Establishment Realm, to evenly battle Chi Wei, a direct descendant of an immortal sect at the late Foundation Establishment Realm. Yet in Li Quantao’s hands, it was merely a defensive artifact. This disparity in mastery filled Li Quantao with bitterness, I truly fall short of my father in every aspect!

Li Xizhi saw no one arriving to assist them, so he reactivated his mana to face the enemy. But it only took a few exchanges for Li Quantao to be badly injured, forcing Li Xizhi to look toward Yu Yuwei for help.

However, his heart sank. Yu Yuwei had initially been fighting two alone, but he now faced yet another devil cultivator. The elderly man was overwhelmed and unable to offer assistance.

His face darkened, but he then heard Li Quantao’s faint, thread-like voice in his ear, “Brother Zhi! The Yu Family can’t be trusted. Yu Yuwei covets my artifact, so he’ll deliberately watch passively... He won’t help!”

Li Quantao had always been strongly hostile toward the Yu Family. Li Xizhi could only silently sigh, drawing his sword again as he stood protectively in front of Li Quantao as the two devil cultivators launched another assault on them.

“Go!” Li Xizhi judged that, given his talisman seeds and talisman qi, he could endure longer than Li Quantao. If they fled, Yu Yuwei would be forced to act, willing or not.

He transmitted using divine sense, “I’ll hold the artifact and escape. Heavenly Glow excels in escape arts, so these two devil cultivators likely won’t catch me...”

Boom!

But before he finished speaking, the gray and white mist hurriedly withdrew like frightened rabbits. The surrounding demonic energy scattered completely as a deafening rumble and dazzling white light stunned everyone present.

Li Xizhi immediately activated his perception art, clearly seeing Qiu Ji’s pale face convulsing violently. A silver-white spear tip pierced through Qiu Ji’s chest, forcing trails of black smoke into the air.

A burst of purple lightning exploded from dark clouds, causing Qiu Ji to scream. Devil cultivator Ge stared in shock. His scalp tingled and his legs weakened. When he heard a thunderclap, he retreated dozens of feet in panic.

Though briefly weakened by lightning, Qiu Ji was extraordinary. He immediately transformed into white mist and reformed into a skull-like head. Unable to flee, he threw himself toward Li Quantao.

Boom!

The skull-like mist was extremely fast, but the crystalline purple light moved faster, instantly intercepting it.

"This is..." Li Quantao paled, not yet reacting fully, as the purple light transformed into a female cultivator in an azure-purple feathered robe who landed gracefully before Li Xizhi.

Her eyes were a hazy purple and she held a silver spear.

Li Qinghong coldly stared at the white skull, muttering, “Qiu Ji...”

She lifted Qiu Ji by the neck, leaving everyone utterly astonished. Even Yu Yuwei was shocked. His devil cultivator opponents exchanged quick glances before immediately fleeing.

Qiu Ji, having been shattered by the lightning, took two full seconds to reform half his body in the air. His upper torso hung helplessly in the woman's grasp, his expression filled with extreme terror. His trembling lips appeared to be muttering pleas for mercy.

The purple brilliance in the almond-shaped eyes of the woman seemed sharp enough to pierce right through him. Hatred gradually surfaced in her gaze, filling Qiu Ji with dread.

It’s her... that female cultivator from the Li Family! So it's already come to this! If I'd known she hated me so deeply, I would have killed one of her relatives back at the market...

Despite being shielded by thunder, it wasn't easy for Li Qinghong's physical body to pierce through the corrosive demonic qi. Bright crimson blood trickled down her wrist, yet she only felt satisfaction in her vengeance.

Qiu Ji, eyes filled with blurry purple lightning, could only cry out in terror, “Milady, you are—”

Boom!

Purple lightning instantly crashed down on him. Qiu Ji screamed in agony as a delicate hand closed tightly around the white mist of his body.

Li Qinghong’s red lips parted slightly as she said coldly, “Old bastard... after so many years... I've finally caught you.”

Her melodious voice echoed through the air. Although this particular corner of the battlefield only had few devil and immortal cultivators, everyone present shuddered.

Qiu Ji's face was a mask of despair as he thought, How could it be this sudden... how could she be this ruthless?!

He didn't believe himself entirely helpless against Li Qinghong. But the unexpected ambush and Li Qinghong’s resolute killing intent had resulted in his current miserable state.

Nearby, devil cultivator Ge was frightened nearly to death. Though Qiu Ji’s strength was slightly inferior to his, he'd lost all ability to resist so quickly because of the ambush. Which devil cultivator wouldn't fear a woman bathed in lightning like this?

He desperately tried fleeing silently with all his might, but at that moment, the Heavenly Glow cultivator and the man wielding the Water Mansion artifact arrogantly took advantage and eagerly blocked his escape. One moved swiftly, always appearing ahead of him. The other was even more troublesome as he used the Water Mansion artifact to firmly suppress his escaping light.

But what truly chilled devil cultivator Ge’s heart was that the female cultivator, with her silver spear and feathered robe surrounded by purple lightning, had long locked onto him with her lightning-infused spiritual sense. She seemed to be casually standing there, but whenever her almond-shaped eyes glanced over at him, he knew any sign of fleeing would invite instant annihilation by lightning!

Damn that fool Qiu Ji... Clearly, he had deep ties with this family! Yet he kept scheming and hiding the truth from me completely! Now look at what's happened! My life is finished!
