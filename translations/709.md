# Chapter 709: The Vicissitudes of the World

At Li Ximing’s request, Daoist Master Lingmei nodded. He asked Li Ximing to enjoy his tea while he went to Chenghua Hall to retrieve the tome. After a considerable wait, he returned, holding a Daoist scripture in his hands.

The book had a deep blue cover and pages of pale yellow. It was held half-open in Lingmei’s hands, and even when he arrived back under the pine, he did not place it on the jade table.

“Zhaojing, please, have a look.”

It seemed awkward for him to continue holding it, but since such treasures often possessed strange properties, placing it on the table might risk shattering the jade. Li Ximing activated his divine ability and reached for it with both hands. But Daoist Master Lingmei raised a hand to stop him.

“Zhaojing, the *Myriad Radiance Sword Tome* is no ordinary artifact,” Lingmei said with a smile. “Allow me.”

“If one possesses sword intent, the tome is as light as silk,” he explained. “Even an elderly farmer could tuck it under his arm and walk away. But for one without a cultivation in the sword Dao, it is heavier than a mountain. Even a Purple Mansion cultivator would struggle to lift it.”

Li Ximing smiled back and nodded, his gaze falling upon the tome. Lingmei had opened it to a page near the end. Six or seven pages had been turned, revealing a few small, bright characters:

【White Pear】

The two characters were a stark, snowy white. A few lines down, more small, white characters appeared:

【Imperial Sun】

Following these were even smaller, fly-speck characters that read: 【Pure Yang Sword of the Imperial Sun Spirit】. What came next was a complex series of symbols and phrases, impossible to decipher.

Using his own divine ability, Daoist Master Lingmei flipped through the pages until he reached the very last few. There, written in ancient, cyan-white script, were the words:

【Azure Ruler】

Li Ximing recognized it as the name of a sword. A few lines below, however, the characters were written in ordinary black ink:

【Celestial Moon】

Beneath these two words was a note: 【Autumnlight Sword of the Celestial Moon's Profound Union】. Li Ximing studied it carefully, a bitter feeling rising in his heart. “What is the name that follows?” he asked. “And why are its characters not as bright as the ones before?”

Daoist Master Lingmei sighed. “When a sword intent manifests in the world, its name is recorded in the tome. If the characters are bright, it means that sword intent still exists. The names you see are those of the intents themselves.”

The sword intent sealed by the Li family had been used long ago, so its entry was naturally dim. Li Ximing bowed in reverence. After a long, silent moment, Lingmei returned the tome to its place and offered a word of comfort.

“It is often said that a grudge can be avenged even after a century. But there are times when there is no target for vengeance. To have all that power coiled in your hand with nowhere to release it… that is the true hardship.”

Li Ximing understood he was referring to the fact that Chi Wei was long dead, and the Chi family had withered to the point where only a few insignificant members of a branch family remained. Though the Li family now had a Purple Mansion cultivator, there was no one left to take revenge upon.

“Thank you for your understanding, Senior,” he said softly.

When he thought about it, Li Xuanfeng and Li Xizhi had played a crucial role in the Chi family’s destruction. With the exception of Chi Zhiyun, who was in seclusion, every direct descendant of the Chi clan had been wiped out. In a way, vengeance had already been served.

‘And Chi Zhiyun is in seclusion somewhere,’ Li Ximing thought fleetingly. ‘Si Boxiu will most likely never let him out.’

The thought sparked another memory—his uncle Li Yuanjiao’s friend, Cheng Gao. “Daoist Master, you mentioned a Cheng Gao earlier,” he asked. “He has some history with my family. Might I ask where he is now?”

Lingmei paused for a moment before answering. “He is still stationed in Ganzi, in the Great Western Plains, guarding the Bai Liqiang kingdom. It’s a small nation, but the Long region is rife with demonic cultivators these days, so he cannot be easily moved.”

The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate’s main sect was in Jiangnan, yet their jurisdiction extended all the way to the border of the Wu and Zhao kingdoms in the northwest. Li Ximing had wondered about this for years, and now he had the perfect opportunity to ask. Lingmei answered readily.

“This traces back to the True Monarch. When our founder sought the Dao, he originally planned to establish the sect right here on Yuchuan Sword Peak. But when he consulted the True Monarch, his request was denied.”

“The True Monarch said, ‘The Dao lineages of the world may change as they will, but two things must not be altered. The first is that sword sects must choose their mountains in the Shu region. The second is that shamanistic talismans must flourish in the Southern Borderlands.’ Our ancestor asked for a reason time and again, but the True Monarch would only say that it was more pleasing to the eye of the Immortal Monarchs…”

“‘More pleasing to the eye?’”

Li Ximing frowned, puzzled. But the words of an Immortal Monarch surely held a deeper meaning.

Lingmei continued, “So our ancestor established the sect in Shu. In Jiangnan, we only had two locations: Sword Ferry and Sword Peak. At our zenith, our power extended across both Long and Shu. After our founder fell, the sect gradually declined. And since our ancestral tree in Jiangnan could not be moved, we slowly migrated to the more spiritually abundant lands here. That is why we still have foundations in Long and Shu to this day.”

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing, and he began to calculate inwardly. ‘I’ve heard that the founder of the Wei Li family was originally from the Li clan of Long. I’ll have to make a trip there someday. If the Sword Gate has a presence there, I can ask them for information.’

After a few more pleasantries, he rose to take his leave. Lingmei, not wanting him to have come all this way for nothing, took a jade box from his sleeve. He had clearly prepared it when he went to retrieve the *Sword Tome*.

“My apologies for the trouble, Zhaojing,” he said. “I hear your clan has a Wanling Flower Tree. Please accept this Horn Wood Golden Tassel. It will be of great benefit to the spirit plant. Consider it a gift from our Sword Gate in return for your visit.”

Li Ximing was unable to refuse and accepted the box. He left the mountain peak and stepped into the Great Void. Only then did he open the box. Inside lay a single, gleaming golden needle from a Horn Wood tassel.

‘This is from that Profound Horn tree. It’s a resource on the level of the Purple Mansion realm, far better than any ordinary treasure.’

He put the box away, a sense of relief washing over him. He had successfully managed his dealings with all three major powers. Though the Sword Gate had politely seen him off, his business with them was concluded, and his mind felt much lighter.

‘My relationships with the Three Sects and Seven Gates are stable for now. Next… I can turn my attention to Jiangbei!’

***

**Pingya Island.**

Li Jiangxia emerged from the hall, his armor clanking with every step. He strode to the edge of the island, where a golden light glowed beneath his feet. A black horse with scales on its belly and crimson eyes stood waiting, snorting impatiently.

The steed was a crossbreed of the famed Zhongsa horse from the Eastern Yue region and the black-scaled horses of the great desert. An Zheyan had spent over three years capturing them, and several more breeding them. By the time the colt was grown and sent to Moongaze Lake, Li Zhouwei had already reached the Foundation Establishment realm and had no need for it. He had gifted it to his favored son, Li Jiangxia.

Just as Li Jiangxia swung himself onto the spirit horse and turned its head, a figure emerged from his lower left. The man had clearly been waiting for some time. He called out past the guards.

“Third Prince! Third Prince!”

Li Jiangxia looked down, a flicker of confusion on his face. His brother, Li Jianglong, who had been a step behind, caught up and glanced at the man.

“Third Brother,” he said with a smile, “you may not know him. This is the illegitimate son of a cousin from the twenty-sixth branch. Outside the main lineage, his name is Hun.”

“So it’s you!”

Li Jiangxia was rarely in the clan and knew nothing of a Hun or a Xing. He urged his horse forward, and the two guards blocked his path with their cold, gleaming iron spears. Li Hun, who was older than both of them, cried out.

“Ah, the Second Prince is here as well! This nephew pays his respects.”

Li Jiangxia noted the man’s thin frame and plain features. He raised his whip and laughed heartily. “Second Brother, this man looks just like you! He must be family. Except for the eyes, the resemblance is uncanny!”

Li Jiangxia’s boisterous, energetic demeanor was a world away from Li Jianglong’s, but since Li Hun’s maternal clan was the Chen family—the same as Li Jianglong’s—a resemblance was to be expected.

Li Jianglong’s expression was one of mild amusement as he joined in the laughter. On the ground, Li Hun went pale and dropped to his knees with a thud.

“You honor me too much, my lords!” he cried. “How could this nephew be so fortunate? I have only just come of age and was looking for some work on the island. I did not expect to see the Third Prince. My father often speaks of you, and I became a little excited…”

‘He still calls him Third Prince, eh?’

Li Jianglong saw at once that the man was trying to latch onto his brother. It was common knowledge that Jiangxia was destined for the eastern shore. For Li Hun to be here in the main hall meant his father must be a Qi Refinement cultivator. A smile played on Li Jianglong’s lips.

‘So, he’s here to curry favor with my little brother.’

How could Li Jiangxia not see it? He let out a great laugh and tucked his whip away, pulling on the reins. “Fine, fine! When I have a moment after I return from the eastern shore, you can come and find me for a proper chat.”

Without waiting for a reply, he spurred his horse and galloped off, leaving a stunned Li Hun in his wake. Before the man could react, Li Jianglong had already helped him to his feet.

“Cousin, you came to the island to…?”

Li Hun answered instinctively, “They said a guest had arrived on the island. My father brought him into the hall. Several elders went as well, to see the Clan Head. He…”

He trailed off, realizing his mistake. But Li Jianglong had already let go of his hand, his expression one of surprise. “Oh, it’s clan business! I thought you were just visiting relatives. My apologies for asking. You shouldn’t have said anything… really, you shouldn’t have! You have a loose tongue, child. You shouldn’t wander around the hall like this in the future. If you stumble into something important… be careful you don’t get punished on Mount Qingdu!”

His words struck fear into Li Hun’s heart. As he spoke, Li Jianglong’s hand had deftly unfastened the token from Li Hun’s waist, palming it. His tone grew heavier.

“It’s a good thing I ran into you, to keep you from wandering off. Come, let’s go see your father.”

Without his token, Li Hun was trapped. He could only follow numbly, his mind racing. Panic finally set in.

“Second Prince, my father… he’s in the middle of something important! It’s really not a good time to see him!”

“It’s fine.”

Li Jianglong paused at the top of the steps and turned back with a pleasant smile. His golden eyes were piercing.

“I’ll wait for him in the side hall.”

Li Hun froze, unable to move. Li Jianglong gently took his hand and led him through the corridors. By the time they reached the side hall, Li Hun was ready to collapse.

Li Jianglong paid him no mind, his attention focused elsewhere. He saw a disheveled middle-aged man walk past the guards. He appeared to be a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, but his cultivation was unstable, clearly propped up by spiritual items.

‘Who is this…?’

***

Li Ximing traveled for a short while in the Great Void before piercing through his family’s great array. He descended on a beam of celestial light, flying straight into the great hall. A journey that would have taken days before he reached the Purple Mansion realm now took less than half an hour. The sky had barely changed.

Li Zhouwei was standing in the hall, more than a dozen jade boxes laid out on a table before him. He was writing on them with a vermillion brush. When Li Ximing appeared, he bowed.

“Daoist Master, the reciprocal gifts for the Three Sects and Seven Gates are ready.”

Of the various powers in the Yue State—the Three Sects, Seven Gates, and two clans besides their own—Li Ximing had chosen to personally visit three. That did not mean the rest could be ignored. For every Purple Mansion cultivator who had attended his Dharma Assembly, a letter and a gift had to be sent, explaining that he was in seclusion to stabilize his divine abilities and could not visit in person.

Li Ximing had already prepared his letters for the Golden Feather Sect, the Hengzhu Immortal Dao, and the Profound Peak Gate, each with a specially chosen precious herb. Li Zhouwei took them and then reported Li Chenghuai’s breakthrough. Li Ximing was very pleased.

“Have him come see me,” he said with a nod.

Just as the words left his lips, a figure hurried in from outside the hall. “Reporting to the Clan Head and the Daoist Master,” he said respectfully. “Someone has come to the island, claiming to be the son of an old friend. He requests an audience with the Clan Head.”

‘The son of an old friend.’

The phrase sparked a thought in Li Zhouwei’s mind. He wondered who it could be. He saw the celestial light in the center of Li Ximing’s brow stir. Li Ximing took a seat to the side, his voice turning slightly cold.

“Let him come up.”

The man quickly retreated. After a dozen breaths, the sound of frantic footsteps echoed on the stairs. A man stumbled into the hall, looking utterly wretched. He fell to his knees with a thud and began to kowtow.

“Greetings… greetings to the Clan Head!”

Li Zhouwei studied him. He was a middle-aged man with a scruffy beard and a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivation. His face had a certain noble air, but it was contorted with panic and fear. His legs trembled as he knocked his head against the floor.

Li Zhouwei did not recognize him, but he saw Li Ximing take a sip of his tea. “Well, if it isn’t Young Master Yuan,” Li Ximing said casually. “To what do we owe the pleasure?”

The words struck the man on the floor like a bolt of lightning. His entire body went cold, as if he might drop dead on the spot. He was so terrified he couldn’t even speak. Li Ximing simply lowered his eyes and continued to drink his tea, not sparing him another glance.

After a moment, Li Chenghuai entered the hall and moved to the side. He glanced at the kneeling figure, and a feeling of familiarity washed over him. His heart jolted.

“Yuan Fuyao!”

The man was indeed the son of an old acquaintance: Yuan Fuyao, son of Yuan Chengdun.

Years ago, after Yuan Tuan disappeared, Yuan Chengdun had prepared to sail out to sea, not expecting to return. He had used the friendship between their families and his entire life’s savings to arrange a marriage for his son, Yuan Fuyao. But Yuan Huwei and Yuan Hudu, seeking to curry favor with the Chi family, broke the agreement. They told Yuan Fuyao to take his inheritance and marry a young lady from the Song family instead.

That was the moment the rift between the Li and Yuan families began, a rift that had now grown so wide that Li Xizhi and Yuan Chengzhao were enemies.

Li Ximing knew all of this. He also knew that Yuan Fuyao had gone on to live a comfortable life with a beautiful wife, becoming the master of the Song estate. And now, here he was.

The expressions on the faces of the Li family members were varied, but Yuan Fuyao was too terrified to speak. His life with the Song family had indeed started idyllically, filled with cultivation and music. But a decade passed in the blink of an eye, and the north-south conflict erupted.

Thanks to his family’s status, Yuan Fuyao was spared from fighting on the riverbanks. He had just breathed a sigh of relief when the Song family suffered devastating losses in the war. They began to eye Yuan Chengdun’s legacy, borrowing five coins one day, ten the next, pressing him relentlessly.

The world was in chaos, and he had nowhere to run. Then came a string of calamities. The main line of the Chi family was annihilated, and the Song family’s fortunes plummeted, which only made them more desperate. Fortunately, his father’s inheritance was vast. He held onto it tightly and managed to survive for over a decade, though the comfortable life he once knew was gone.

He heard tales of the Li family’s rise, of how Li Xizhi—the man who was almost his brother-in-law—had become a renowned master known throughout Jiangnan as the "Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow." Regret gnawed at him like a rat, and he tossed and turned at night.

Then, the sound of Li Ximing’s ascension, the sheer power of his divine ability, echoed through the Great Void across Jiangnan. Yuan Fuyao was struck with terror. He immediately jumped out of a window and fled, not daring to take anyone or anything with him. He hid in the wilderness for months. It was there he learned that the Azure Pond Sect had descended upon the Song estate that very night, leaving no survivors. His wife, concubines, and children were all dead.

But he had been born a coddled young master. Even at his worst in the Song household, his life had been one that ordinary rogue cultivators could only dream of. Hiding in the wild, afraid to be seen, was no life for him. He lived in constant fear that Li Ximing would remember him, tear open the void, and come for him. Finally, he had made his way to the lake himself.

He trembled for a long time before finally recounting his tragic tale. “I… I regret it all, but it is too late!” he choked out. “I beg the immortal clan to be magnanimous…”

Li Zhouwei had heard enough. He looked on with cold eyes. ‘He has a bit of cunning… but his character is too weak to amount to anything.’
