# Chapter 996: Journey to the Sea

Li Zhouwei released his hand, only to see Li Ximing present a jade talisman. He held it up, revealing the intricate patterns upon its surface, which flowed with the transcendent white light of the Capital Guard's Dao.

"This is a Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman," Li Ximing explained. "It's a Spiritual Artifact from an ancient tradition, the Garrison Profound Dao. Its primary function is an ability called 'Spirit-Summoning,' which can be used to command mountain ghosts and river spirits. In ancient times, when the world's order was more complete, these entities could even contend with beings on the level of the Merciful One."

"Nowadays… they're mostly just good for running errands. It's suitable for protecting the younger generation."

Li Ximing raised the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman and aimed it at the ground of Gardenia Scenery Mountain beneath their feet. He cast it down, stamped his foot, and intoned, "By tiered ranks of guardian spirits, I summon the Garrison Court!"

White smoke billowed upwards, and where the talisman landed, a figure materialized. It was a man of immense height, clad in black robes and armor, holding a spear. A golden-white radiance shone from him, and the aroma of incense clung to his form, lending him an air of profound authority. He knelt before them with the gravitas of a collapsing mountain and said respectfully, "This humble deity greets you, my lord."

He spoke with a clear, resonant voice, then turned his head slightly, lowered his gaze, and bowed once more to Li Zhouwei. "This humble deity pays his respects to Your Highness."

Li Zhouwei arched an eyebrow, his interest piqued as he examined the figure.

Li Ximing smiled. "The Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman is quite interesting, and it has another benefit. The mountain ghosts and river spirits it summons are intrinsically linked to the land. When summoned over Moongaze Lake, this humble deity is quite formidable."

After a careful inspection, Li Zhouwei asked, "Does it have memories? A True Spirit?"

Li Ximing shook his head with a hint of regret. "It's not as miraculous as Xuanyi's Corner-Cleansing Merit Bottle. While the deity summoned by this talisman is powerful, it must be sustained by a divine ability. Once a full day passes, the god dissipates. The next time it's summoned, its mind will be a complete blank slate."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "Its power level is rather awkward. Just as Granduncle said, it's really only good for making a good impression and running a few errands."

"Aside from 'Spirit-Summoning'," Li Ximing continued, "its other ability is 'Overseer's Light.' The power of that ability depends on several factors: the proximity and power of nearby lakes and mountains, the master's cultivation level in their dao lineage, and the number of matching jade talismans used… but when we're on the lake, the Overseer's Light is at least respectable."

As he spoke, he pushed the Spiritual Treasure, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, back toward Li Zhouwei.

But Li Zhouwei shook his head. "Granduncle should take the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument."

"Hmm?" Li Ximing frowned. "What use would I have for a Spiritual Treasure?"

Li Zhouwei smiled. "The instrument requires Radiant Fire to be used. Is Grandncle going to give me a portion of his Radiant Fire? This isn't a question of whether you can use it or not. Your strength is already considerable. With three spiritual fires at your command, you can dominate the early stages of the Purple Mansion Realm. If you add this complementary Spiritual Treasure to your arsenal, I fear even the cultivators of the old Supreme Yang Daoist tradition would have paled in comparison. Be it a Maha practitioner or a cultivator with three divine abilities, they would have to think twice before facing you."

"That changes things entirely," he continued. "The world is fraught with peril. Only by possessing strength comparable to the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm can one hope to handle the vast majority of crises."

Who could remain unmoved by a Spiritual Treasure? Li Ximing gazed at the orb-like object, perfectly round like a Golden Core, his heart stirring with excitement. After hesitating for a long moment, he finally took it and tucked it away, unable to part with it. "This is truly a waste," he said. "The moment Jiangqian has good news, this will be passed on to him!"

Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal. By the time Li Jiangqian broke through, Li Ximing would have long since cultivated the World's Radiance. With three Purple Mansion spiritual fires and the enhancement of the Valley Wind Guide-Fire technique, it was hard to say who would be a better fit for the Spiritual Treasure.

Li Ximing then grinned. "Do you remember that letter you sent from the Eastern Sea all those years ago? We've received news about the 'Converging Water' spiritual item you acquired. It's called 'Sinking Savage Aged Gold,' a very rare type of Converging Water material that's perfect for forging weapons. A pity our family has no use for it."

Li Zhouwei grew thoughtful. "Hold onto it for me. By my calculations, Dingjiao should reach the Purple Mansion Realm within the next decade. If this material has no other critical use, we can send it to him as a congratulatory gift. It wouldn't be an insult."

When Li Zhouwei had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, Dingjiao had sent him a Purple Mansion Spiritual Treasure. This return gift was far too light in comparison, but their family wasn't wealthy enough to give away Spiritual Treasures as presents. The Sinking Savage Aged Gold would have to suffice.

The memory surfaced for Li Ximing, and he nodded silently. He then relayed the news about Dingyang Zi using a blood sacrifice for his Spiritual Artifact.

Li Zhouwei's brow furrowed. "That would be inappropriate. At most, I could offer a single drop, as Zhu Gong did back then to request spiritual resources, just enough to make the artifact feel an affinity for me. Spitting out a mouthful of essence blood is out of the question! The higher my cultivation, the more precious my blood becomes. If I were to truly offer up a mouthful of essence blood without a spiritual item on the level of White Dew Blood to replenish it, my cultivation would likely be delayed by decades!"

Dongfang Heyun had specifically warned him about this years ago. Li Zhouwei shook his head decisively, a chill running through Li Ximing's heart.

"Thankfully, we have the Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough!" Li Ximing sighed.

This was excellent news. He immediately had someone summon Li Minggong, preparing to send her to Qize. Only then did they begin to catch up on the major and minor events of recent years.

"The children of the 'Sui' generation have also grown up," Li Ximing said seriously. "There are three to five of them who show great promise… I believe we need to consider their futures carefully!"

Li Zhouwei looked up with great interest.

The middle-aged man smiled. "One of them… is your direct grandson, named Suihuan. He is incredibly ambitious and highly talented."

Li Ximing's expression was one of pure gratification as he watched him with a smile, repeating the boy's words with a heroic tone. Li Zhouwei listened and chuckled.

"The boy is still naive."

Li Ximing's gaze returned, and he lowered his eyes to his teacup. "Suihuan's talent is exceptional, after all. He deserves encouragement. The others are a step behind, but they are still outstanding. One of them, Li Suining, has an unusually high talent for formation arts!"

Upon hearing the name Li Suihuan, Li Zhouwei's expression became slightly complicated. He set down his cup and hesitated for a moment, but ultimately said nothing and asked no questions. He simply put on a smile.

"Li Suining?"

"That's right!" Li Ximing put his cup down, his expression serious. "Since we have a rare genius in the Dao of formations, we shouldn't let the matter rest. I was originally planning a trip to the south, but now it seems I should first visit the Eastern Sea and consult with Senior Changdie…"

He smiled. "After all, we just gave him a spirit embryo. It's only fair to get some formation inheritances from him in return!"

"As for the family… the Upper Rite's Essence-Gathering Profound Origin Art has shown results. It can be passed down to that Li Suikuan. As for cultivation arts that aid in formations, I will have to consult the Daoist tradition and browse the pavilion to select a batch of techniques to distribute."

He paused slightly, then lowered his voice. "There's no rush to trade for them! The pavilion already has a good number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation arts on hand. We can take them out first and place them in the secret vault within the grand formation. Whenever a junior distinguishes themselves, we can then go and exchange for a corresponding Purple Mansion dao lineage of the same affinity!"

Li Zhouwei found this quite reasonable and added, "In any case, there's an abundance of Foundation Establishment techniques inside. We can also place a batch of our family's existing Purple Mansion techniques of corresponding affinities in there. For lower-grade ones like the Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra, we can directly include the Foundation Establishment section."

Li Ximing agreed, then changed the subject. "There is one matter I've been considering… Minggong… she is no longer young, and her cultivation is sufficient."

"The old master came to ask once, also inquiring about divine abilities. The news was… bittersweet."

At this single sentence, Li Zhouwei fell silent.

Li Ximing's own divine ability stirred subtly as he continued, "I looked specifically in the pavilion. There is a fifth-grade scripture, the _Heavenly Sparrow's Grant of Light Sutra_. It contains only a single secret method and costs ninety-seven immortal merits. After exchanging for the Emperor Qi's Light back then, you had two hundred ninety-eight left… and after you emerged from the grotto-heaven, you had another thirty-one to spare…"

Li Zhouwei contemplated this for a long time before finally answering,

"Difficult… far too difficult. The family has no True Fire Purple Mansion spiritual items. And even if we did… a single secret method… wouldn't that be pushing our aunt into a pit of fire?"

The golden-eyed young man put down his tea. "What does Aunt herself… have to say?"

Li Ximing sighed. "Actually… there's also Ding Weizeng. They are among the few in the family who have even a sliver of hope. The others have none at all. But neither of them has ever brought it up."

As they spoke, Li Minggong arrived at the mountain estate. She was no longer young, but because she had established her foundation early and had never suffered any major injuries, she appeared to be in her thirties. Her black hair was tied back simply. She bowed to Li Ximing.

"Minggong, do you have any aspirations for a divine ability? I have news of a True Fire Purple Mansion cultivation art… one that shares the same affinity as your immortal foundation."

Li Ximing's words were concise. Li Minggong started, then bowed in a slight fluster. "I have no ambitions for the Purple Mansion Realm."

Li Ximing nodded as Li Minggong lowered her head and continued, "If the family has need of me, I will certainly try… but my lord need not trouble himself over my dao lineage."

"Among the Chengming generation, I was never outstanding. I was merely lucky enough to return from the north alive. Brother Liao and my younger brother were both far more remarkable than I, and even they never considered the Purple Mansion Realm, let alone a junior like me. All I wish is to live out my life-mandate and teach the descendants of my brothers, to shelter their posterity on their behalf."

Li Ximing sighed internally. He moved past the topic and instructed her to go to Qize. When he looked back at Li Zhouwei, he forced a smile. "I'll go see to it now… and have someone add the cultivation arts to the island's repository!"

He transformed into a streak of light and departed.

Li Zhouwei, however, remained seated at the table. He thought for a long time, not in any hurry to meet his eldest grandson. Instead, he gave a sudden command, "Bring Jiangnian to me."

A guard on the mountain immediately departed. A short while later, a man in white robes ascended the path.

A magical glamour flowed across the man's face. His features appeared regular, yet he carried himself with a timid, cringing air. He bowed before Li Zhouwei. 

"Father."

Li Zhouwei's gaze pierced through the illusion, seeing the man's true, ugly face beneath. His eyes were stretched unnaturally wide by some external force, and his cheeks bore obvious marks of reshaping. It was clear his face had been altered with a 'Jade True' technique, but the poor craftsmanship had resulted in a distorted visage.

"You've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"It was… merely a stroke of luck, my lord."

Li Zhouwei watched him quietly. There was no sharpness in his gaze, nor any trace of disgust. He reached out, patted the man's shoulder, and instructed, 

"Starting today, you will go to the Qunyi Archipelago."

Li Jiangnian stood up. He didn't ask a single question, accepting his fate like a lamb. He simply nodded.

Li Zhouwei rose, his voice softening. "Cultivate more life-preserving spell arts. Train diligently. Stay far away from the lake, and do not live in the shadow of your brothers' glory… that would also be for the best."

Li Jiangnian merely nodded. When he finally saw Li Zhouwei wave his hand in dismissal, he called out, "Thank you, Father," and scurried away.

Li Zhouwei watched his departing figure, his head slowly lowering, his gaze calm.

'Back then, I was only hoping for a change in circumstances, for a single chance at a breakthrough. But Granduncle couldn't bear it in the end and bestowed the name 'Huan'… now the child has grown. There is nothing to be changed.'

'Not just a divine ability for the second generation… not just a Bright Yang for the second generation… how could that be acceptable!'

---

Upon a dais of black jade, purple mist drifted.

A round porcelain plate rested silently on the platform. Golden sand, fine as water, was spread across it, with a tiny Daoist temple placed on top. A dashing man lay reclined beside the plate, casually inspecting it.

"Martial Uncle—how many lots did we win?"

Daoist Master Tianque entered from outside the cave, full of excitement. He stopped amidst the Purple Mist and announced, "Good fortune! We secured two!"

"Oh?" Daoist Master Tianhuo rose, pleasantly surprised, and raised an eyebrow. 

"I only heard of one. Where did the other come from?"

Daoist Master Tianque was clearly in high spirits. "One was a figure from our own territory. The other was with the Ni family. I received news in advance and brought it back to the mountain. It was a treasure, drawn by the summons, that flew out on its own. It's a good thing I arrived in time, and the Ni family didn't dare to offend us. That's how I managed to secure it!"

"Congratulations, Martial Uncle!" Tianhuo said, then watched as Tianque's smile faded and his expression turned serious.

"How is that lord of ours?"

Tianhuo's expression immediately grew grave as well. "He has sent his subordinates to Linhai Prefecture, but has not been seen in person for some time. I speculate that he is already attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Hearing this, the other Daoist Master sighed and sat down beside him. "He truly doesn't give anyone a moment's rest. It's only been a few years since the fall of Wanling Heaven. Most of the great families are still digesting their gains and nursing their wounds, and he's already preparing to make his next major move."

"It is always best to act swiftly," Tianhuo replied, his expression somber. 

"What was Mount Changhuai's response?"

A cold resentment still lingered in Tianque's voice, though it was not intense. 

"What response could there be? They're busy with that Qing Tangyin business, of course. Back then, they made a huge spectacle of it, integrating the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel into the grand formation, spreading it across the entire Wu State… scheming in the shadows, allowing the Nine Surnames and the great clans to grow arrogant. Wasn't it all for this day?"

"Once the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel shatters, chaos will engulf the Wu State. He has reincarnated to build an empire. The Nine Surnames have been isolated from the world for too long and are still in the dark. Many will inevitably die. The killing karma he amasses will likely be even greater than that of Yang Zhuo."

Tianhuo gave a wry laugh and shook his head. "That they keep out of each other's way can be considered a form of unspoken understanding."

Tianque sighed and nodded. "We asked again and again, but they were unwilling to say much, only promising a few positions. And how could they not? Unless they want our two sects to go to war, he would never be able to restore the old territories of the Wu State without my Golden Feather's approval."

His tone suddenly shifted. "Yun'er… how many divine abilities does he have now?"

"Three," Tianhuo said casually. "If he hadn't been ambushed by those bastards from the north, he would have achieved it sooner! Now, the timeline is even tighter. We can't count on him. The outcome will mainly depend on Father."

"One more thing I must ask—has the dynastic name been prepared?"

"Naturally. That is something they decided long ago."

Tianque raised his eyebrows slightly, a solemn look in his eyes as he revealed the name:

"Shu."
