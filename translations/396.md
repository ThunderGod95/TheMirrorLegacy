# Chapter 514: Reunion

Li Yuanjiao took the Dinglin Piercer from his hand. The Golden Tang Gate favored techniques for piercers, daggers, and sabers. This Dinglin Piercer had a peculiar appearance and was about six cun long, resembling a thin stick with sharpened ends, designed for penetrating surfaces with precision.[1]

Gazing at Li Xijun, Li Yuanjiao frowned and spoke in a deep voice.

"We were fighting in the formation before... You should have left early instead of staying here. If I failed to defeat Situ Mo, at least you could still get away safely."

Kongheng was present, and Li Xijun did not dare claim he could see through the situation in the formation. So, he simply nodded in response.

Li Yuanjiao's expression darkened as he instructed the others to bring forth the spirit water that was just within their reach. He whispered to Kongheng, "I've been following behind all of you this whole time, so I know Situ Mo did not follow us all the way here. He flew straight to the edge of this pool... and seems to know that we are here!"

Kongheng released his mantra and replied, "Are you suggesting that... the man is acting on a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's order, Benefactor?"

Li Yuanjiao's expression shifted as he considered the possibility. He was about sixty percent certain about it. Earlier, he had used the Qingche Sword's intent, aiming to end the man's life for good. However, he quickly vanished. This made him even more convinced of his speculation.

"It may not be an order... The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Golden Tang Gate hasn't been seen in a long time, and most of its territory has fallen under the control of the Yue Cultivating Sect. It's possible some force bears a grudge against my Li Family and is secretly aiding him," Li Yuanjiao said, his voice grave.

Kongheng fell silent for a moment before murmuring, "Maybe... it's the Wrathful Dao lineage..."

As they spoke, the pool of water before them began to roll as if boiling, slowly parting to reveal a stream of white, crystal-clear spirit water that leaped out. It spun in a circle before filling up the jade bottle in Li Xijun's hand.

Li Xijun's face was still somewhat pale, but he quickly exclaimed with joy, "Granduncle! It's Pure Essence Spirit Water!"

Li Xuanxuan hurried forward to take a closer look before nodding in approval.

"It is indeed the Pure Essence Spirit Water! With this, more people can benefit from the Grade Three Spirit Eye Perception at home!"

This spirit water would significantly aid those who cultivated the Spirit Eye Perception. After mastering the technique, he would also be able to find an explanation for any peculiar phenomena he encountered.

Li Xijun carefully stored it away as Li Yuanjiao urged, "We shouldn't linger! Let's leave quickly."

The group obeyed and rode the wind as they took to the skies. Li Yuanjiao felt a mix of worry and unease when suddenly the jade pendants at their waists illuminated, emitting a gentle light.

"Huh?"

They all paused in surprise. Li Xijun asked curiously, "Could it be that Auntie was worried and followed us?"

"No..." Li Yuanjiao shook his head. He had specifically asked Li Qinghong to stay behind and watch over the family.

While he pondered this, a mysterious spirit mist enveloped him, momentarily hiding him from view.

Just then, a burst of colorful light approached the group, revealing a young man riding a rainbow. He wore a black feathered robe, his black hair fastened with a jade crow. He held a swaddled bundle in his arms.

He laughed heartily and greeted, "Xizhi greets elders and brothers! I was just wondering who was here!"

Li Xuanxuan nearly jumped with joy, exclaiming, "It's my Zhi'er!"

Li Xijun blinked in surprise. He focused intently on the newcomer for three breaths, using the white qi in his eyes to detect any traces of illusion. When he found none, he gasped almost incredulously, "It's really Third Brother!"

Seeing Li Xuanxuan rush forward, Li Xizhi's face lit up with shock as he asked, "That's... Grandfather?"

He pulled Li Xuanxuan closer, his voice filled with disbelief as he continued, "It's only been twenty years since I left; why have you aged so much, Grandfather? This is..."

Li Xuanxuan, now just over eighty, appeared to be well over a hundred years old. Li Xizhi stared at him, dumbfounded. Li Xuanxuan waved his hand dismissively, then looked at his grandson, beaming with pride as he praised, "Good... Good!"

Li Xijun, who was standing behind, stifled a laugh before stepping forward and cupping his fist.

"Xijun greets Third Brother!"

"Y-Y-You!"

Li Xizhi's heart swelled with emotion, his eyes glistening with tears as he smiled and said, "My good younger brother! It's been twenty years since we last met, and you look like an immortal now!"

The two young men exchanged glances, each filled with a multitude of unspoken thoughts, unsure of how to begin. Li Xuanxuan quickly pulled Li Xizhi over, gesturing to the child in his arms as he asked, "T-This... this is?"

Li Xizhi chuckled.

"Li Chenghuai."

"Ah!"

"Oh my!" Li Xuanxuan's face lit up with joy instantly. But before he could say another word, the mysterious spirit mist beside them dissipated. Li Yuanjiao, clad in a black robe, could no longer contain himself.

His face flushed as he scolded, "Why didn't you write to your family about such an important matter, boy?!"

Li Xizhi was taken aback, allowing Li Xuanxuan to take Li Chenghuai from his arms. Despite being scolded by his father, he felt a mix of happiness and sorrow as he exclaimed, "Father!"

Li Yuanjiao raised an eyebrow and scrutinized him for a long moment. The brilliance of the rainbow light and the shimmer of the feather robe danced across his face. Finally, he uttered two words in a hoarse voice.

"Not bad."

Having left home at the tender age of ten to journey into the Azure Pond Sect, Li Xizhi had not seen his father in twenty years.

Li Yuanjiao's letters had always been serious and solemn; he had never spoken to him like he was his child. Hearing his father's words now brought tears to Li Xizhi's eyes as he said, "I have walked on thin ice in Azure Pond for twenty years, striving to live up to my family's trust!"

Silence enveloped the family as Li Yuanjiao gently stroked his back without a word. Li Xizhi quickly composed himself, wiping his face and smiling.

"I've received a mission from the sect to protect Libu Prefecture, which is just up ahead! Please, come with me and rest for a while there."

He glanced at Li Xijun, noticing that his eighth brother looked somewhat pale.

"This is..."

"Just a scratch," Li Xijun reassured him.

Li Xizhi frowned and rummaged through his storage pouch, producing several jade bottles filled with high-quality medicine.

"Take these quickly! Come with me to rest and heal your injuries... You shouldn't delay this!" he urged.

The group exchanged glances, agreeing to his suggestion as they headed north together. Li Xizhi inquired about the injury, and Li Xijun recounted the encounter with Situ Mo.

Hearing this, Li Xizhi's frown deepened.

"I know of this man! Situ Mo is one of the top three disciples from this generation of the Golden Tang Gate. He has a domineering temperament and a notorious reputation."

"However..." His expression turned decisive as he continued, "Based on Eighth Brother's description, this man is definitely far from ordinary. Despite his arrogance, he is not easy to deal with. We should find an opportunity to eliminate him!"

Li Yuanjiao cradled Li Chenghuai, carefully looking at the baby's face with a thoughtful expression as he remarked softly, "That person came straight to us. He either has a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator backing him or has received some critical information. If he were to die, the Golden Tang Gate would surely know and it would lead to trouble."

He voiced his speculation with a hint of doubt in his tone, "Back then, Situ Mo's lineage was defeated. It was rumored that the entire lineage was destroyed, prompting the elders to unite against the Ji Family. Given Situ Mo's appearance, I fear those rumors may not be true."

Li Xijun nodded, coughing lightly as he inferred, "This individual possesses many treasures and a deep mastery of spells. He likely has a powerful backer within Golden Tang Gate, and he doesn't seem to be alone..."

1. Lord have mercy on me, the author is very inconsistent about this weapon. When it first appeared, it was described as a "golden sword" that "pinned/nailed" Li Xijun to the ground in the raws. Then in a previous chapter, it was described as a weapon about seven chi long (about 233cm long). Now in this chapter, it is described as a "thin stick with sharpened ends" about six cun long (20 cm long). I have revised these chapters a few times before publishing them but I am still unsure if this is a 233 cm or 20 cm weapon due to another future chapter. I can't imagine Li Xijun pulling out a 233 cm long weapon, I can't imagine him being pinned to the ground by a 20 cm long weapon either. So I have decided to translate this as it is in the raws. Maybe it could shapeshift? ‚òú

Li Xizhi recalled the records he had read in the sect and said softly, "I have studied Golden Tang Gate thoroughly. There are many secrets revolving around it. He had probably joined the Azure Pond after his lineage was destroyed because he had no other choice... It's no surprise for them to raise an orphan to preserve the lineage. Situ Mo should be the son of Situ Yi. As the survivor of his lineage, it's understandable that he would be valued."

Li Xuanxuan interjected quietly, "If that's the case, he will be even more difficult to deal with. If we openly kill him, we risk inciting a furious retaliation from Golden Tang Gate. It would be best to devise a plan..."

Li Xuanxuan's implication was clear, and Li Yuanjiao had his own opinions. Though the family preferred to keep a low profile, they were never hesitant. The appearance of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator did not instill fear or impatience; rather, they contemplated the ways they could deal with him discreetly.

Troubled, Li Xuanxuan murmured, "But we can't confront him directly... Even if Master Monk and your siblings join forces, they can only stand a chance to take him down. Besides, we don't know how many trump cards he has up his sleeve. As a direct descendant of Golden Tang, he's bound to have many life-saving artifacts!"

Everyone fell silent, lost in their thoughts as they arrived at Libu Prefecture, where rolling hills and various villages peppered the landscape. Li Xizhi illuminated a jade talisman, infusing it with mana as he instructed his family, "Wait a moment."

After a brief pause, they spotted two figures riding the wind toward them. Both appeared to be at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, more mature and possessed an air of grace as if they had been raised in luxury.

They stopped before the group as one of them asked respectfully, "May I ask which of you is the envoy of the immortal sect?"

Li Xizhi tossed the jade token over to them and replied softly, "Qingdu Li Xizhi of Qingsui Peak... My master is Yuan Tuan, from the Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest!"

After hearing these words, the two men immediately grasped Li Xizhi's background. They bowed their heads respectfully and said, "Greetings, my lord! Please follow us... The helpers in the market are ready for your inspection..."

Li Xizhi waved his hand dismissively and replied, "No hurry, let them wait for now... These are my family members; they were attacked by bandits on the road and suffered some minor injuries. Please take care of them first. Arrange for the best spirit medicine and put the expenses on my account."

The two men quickly replied, "You must be joking, my lord... We can't possibly put the expenses on your account! We'll handle that right away!"

Li Xizhi smiled as he said, "I insist."

The two exchanged glances, their expressions shifting to one of obedience as they stammered, "Y-Yes... understood..."

Li Xizhi had no intention of leaving anything behind here that could be used against him in the future. He was not a direct descendant of the Chi Family and had not aligned himself with any faction within the clan, so he could not afford to exploit the situation without hesitation.

What a grand display!

Li Xijun and Li Xuanxuan looked at each other before following one of the attendants downstairs. The old man turned to Li Xuanxuan, a look of uncertainty crossing his face.

"Have we met before, Senior?"

Li Xuanxuan smiled and replied, "I once ran a small store at Cloud Crowned Peak."

"Oh... oh! I was in charge of that place back then!" the old man exclaimed, recognition dawning on him.

As the old man recalled the past, he paused awkwardly. Li Xuanxuan utilized a secret technique to communicate quietly, "I remember those two... Back then, my family wasn't a clan yet, and I was selling talismans. They came to my store before... and were full of arrogance! But now..."

Li Xuanxuan could not help but snicker inwardly. The old man soon presented several spirit items. Li Yuanjiao selected a few inexpensive ones and said in a deep voice, "I'll take some time to rest in seclusion and prepare to depart in a few days."

Li Xijun nodded and followed him into seclusion. Meanwhile, Li Xuanxuan remained in the hall, dealing with the man's flattery, thinking to himself, "Azure Pond Sect's disciples... are truly cool!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Family, Wutu Peak.

Li Ximing guided the flame in the furnace gently. It leaped into his palm and turned into Long Marching Fire Essence, and he opened his mouth, swallowing the flame into his belly.

"It's been a while since I reached the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm!"

He had stabilized his cultivation over the past few days and found the opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, entering the late stage and now becoming a powerful asset of the Li Family. He was another step closer to the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Meng Zhuoyun, who was standing nearby, was half undressed, revealing her snow-white skin. She lounged lazily on the ground, supporting herself with her elbows. In her left hand, she held a slender brush, while the other hand pressed down on a portrait.

She appeared quite relaxed, adding strokes to her artwork from time to time. Her feet were high up in the air, half of her body basking in the sun, her delicate skin glowing and her waist slender.

Li Ximing loosened the collar of his robe, rolling up his sleeves to reveal his own snow-white skin before pulling her into an embrace.

Meng Zhuoyun groaned as he turned her to face him, her brush momentarily forgotten.

"You've made another breakthrough... With your talent, it's no wonder the Li Family keeps a close eye on you," she remarked softly.

Li Ximing was usually quiet during intimate moments, but Meng Zhuoyun was always chattering. Her red lips and pearly whites glinted in the sunlight like blood-red jade as she spoke, captivating Li Ximing's attention.

"Don't seek revenge. He's dead already; just stay in here and live a peaceful life," he murmured.

"Hm?" Meng Zhuoyun exhaled softly, her cheeks flushing slightly.

Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she teased him, "What? Be your cauldron for life..?"

"What nonsense are you spouting?"

Li Ximing brushed a wet strand of hair from her forehead, revealing her smooth forehead. He rarely offered advice but now said with tenderness, "It's not a bad life for you... Your ex-husband was only with you for half a year due to a matchmaker's arrangement. Is he stronger than me?"

A trace of sadness crossed Meng Zhuoyun's face as she replied softly, "You are a genius; he can't possibly compare to you."

"That's right. Since you don't have any strong feelings for him, what's the point of clinging to revenge...?"

Li Ximing was about to offer more advice when his thoughts shifted abruptly.

This woman has a rare talent for alchemy. If she joins my family, her cultivation will accelerate year after year. On top of that, I won't have to waste my time refining those Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm pills! It's a win-win situation!

"You're right, I didn't spend that much time with him... I only married him because it was arranged by the matchmaker," she replied, gasping for breath.

Her tone changed as she continued softly, "But he treated me like a person..."

Her soulful eyes locked onto his as she gently explained, "He was an intelligent man, but had no powerful background. He wasn't exceptional and the Foundation Establishment Realm was beyond his reach. Naturally, he couldn't compare to you... but he treated me like a human being, unlike you... You never show me any sincerity."

Li Ximing froze for a moment, staring into her eyes, which had suddenly regained their clarity amidst the haze of pleasure and intoxication.

"You treat me like a dog, like a tool... like an object. When I screamed in pain, you merely coaxed me. Once your needs are met, you cast me aside. I can only regain some dignity once you're happy..." she added with a hint of bitterness.

Li Ximing did not respond to her. But instead, he strangled her. Both of them groaned at the same time‚Äîone of pain and one of pleasure.

Li Ximing took a few moments to compose himself before casting a Purifying Spell to clean himself up.

"The pills needed today are Tranquility, Qi Nourishment, and Mind Calming. Don't forget to refine them," he instructed softly.

After saying that, he turned away without looking at her expression. Meng Zhuoyun, too weary to clean up herself, laid on her back for a moment before turning over to retrieve her half-wet painting. She picked up her brush and added a few more strokes.

The black ink melted away, leaving a finger-sized blotch on the paper. As Meng Zhuoyun sat up naked, beads of sweat glistened on her snow-white skin, rolling down the delicate curves of her legs.

She hung the painting up and scrutinized it closely. It depicted Li Ximing sitting comfortably in a large chair with her standing beside him, both smiling sweetly.

"Heh..."

She let out a lingering cold laugh that sounded almost like a groan. The pale blue orchid in her hair shimmered in the sunlight.
