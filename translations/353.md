# Chapter 429: Slaughter Jun Kui Light

The members of the Li Family swiftly departed on the wind. Li Yuanjiao's face was slightly pale, but after consuming a Cold Dispelling Antidote and a pill to replenish his true essence, his complexion improved significantly. Beside him, Li Qinghong, who had also exerted considerable energy, took the same pill and regulated her breathing.

Despite his slight injuries, Li Yuanjiao maintained a smile on his face. The storage pouch in his hand glowed with runes, suggesting that it was no ordinary item.

He chuckled and said, "That devil cultivator seems different from the other minor devil cultivators we usually encounter... He's likely one of the core figures like Zhang Huaide and Qiu Ji. I expect we'll find something of value in this pouch."

However, Li Yuanjiao did not open the storage pouch but instead played with it in his hand.

Li Xuanxuan looked at him in concern and asked, "Jiao'er, how are your injuries?"

"It's nothing serious. I'll get Guiluan to help me recover for a couple of days, and then I'll spend the next few months stabilizing my cultivation. After that, I should be able to break through to the ninth heavenly layer," he replied, hinting that he would be using a talisman pill.

Since the old monkey flying behind them, Li Yuanjiao did not want to talk about the talisman pill openly. The four of them flew on for a while until Li Yuanjiao suddenly halted and whispered, "Found it!"

Below them, a minor Embryonic Breathing Realm family was being ruthlessly attacked by a devil cultivator. Li Yuanjiao descended, drawing his sword to strike.

Soon, he returned with a captured Embryonic Breathing Realm devil cultivator, whose limbs had been cleanly severed. The devil cultivator's eyes widened in fear as he pleaded for mercy.

Li Yuanjiao stared at him emotionlessly, then threw the limbless devil cultivator onto the ground before tossing the devil qi cultivator's storage pouch on him.

"Open it with your spiritual sense," he ordered.

The Embryonic Breathing Realm devil cultivator complied instantly, and the pouch's contents spilled out. There were no visible traps or seals.

Li Yuanjiao, not interested in finding out whether the devil cultivator had been marked for revenge, ignored his pleas for mercy. With a swift motion, he crushed the devil cultivator's skull under his foot and incinerated the remains with a fire spell, then picked up the storage pouch and its contents.

All of this happened in a matter of breaths. Meanwhile, Li Qinghong, who was meditating with her spear in hand, remained detached and seemingly unaffected by the scene. Li Xuanxuan, however, frowned and interjected, "A single slash would have sufficed... There was no need to sever his limbs and make such a bloody mess."

"It's better this way. At least, there's no need to worry about him using any talismans," Li Yuanjiao replied with a laugh.

With that, they soared into the air. Li Yuanjiao examined the contents of the storage pouch as they flew and in no time, they had arrived at the border of the Yu Family's territory.

Yu Family's Milin Prefecture was engulfed in smoke and fire. Spells and streams of mana light clashed in the air, leaving marks of battle and ruin on the ground.

Li Xuanxuan paused to observe for a moment and then remarked softly, "There are only four generations from Yu Yufeng to Yu Chengyi. To think that the situation of their family has deteriorated so much that recovery seems impossible..."

Li Qinghong, who was holding her spear and watching the bright flames engulf the prefecture, commented, "When clans are founded, their ancestors are either exceptionally gifted and cunning, generous and resourceful, or cautious and ruthless. The first generation built their foundations, and the second maintained them but were less successful than their predecessors... The descendants indulge in comfort and focus solely on cultivation, detached from the hardships of the world. They attain the Foundation Establishment Realm and suppress the other clans, or they risk planting the seeds of future troubles if they don't."

Li Yuanjiao rested his hand on the sword at his waist and murmured, "From our family's high ancestor, Li Mutian, we have seen four generations... The current generation of Xi and Yue is the fifth."

He turned and asked suddenly, "Is there any descendant comparable to the high ancestor?"

Li Qinghong, caught off guard by his serious tone, quickly laughed and said, "Each generation faces its own circumstances. There's no need to compare, Big Brother."

Li Xuanxuan listened silently to the discussion between Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong without saying a word. Upon returning to Lijing Town, he ascended the peak to draw talismans, while Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong landed in the central hall to divide the spoils with Li Yuanping.

There were ten spirit pouches of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. After filling the vault with dharma artifacts and spirit items, the remaining forty Spirit Stones were added to the clan account. This replenished the gap left by the Spirit Stones for Li Qingxiao's lineage from Mount Yu.

When they poured out the savings from the Qi devil cultivator, there were twenty Spirit Stones, not accounting for the rest. Li Yuanjiao handed them over to Yuanping, only to see him frown and say, "You should keep some for yourselves too, Big Brother and Big Sister. If you give everything to the clan, you two won't have anything left for your own cultivation. Big Brother is on the verge of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm... You should think more about yourself."

The siblings exchanged glances with each other briefly, then decided to split the Spirit Stones among themselves. They also took a few bottles of useful pills for themselves. Li Yuanjiao sifted through the remaining devil techniques for a while before his eyes finally lit up.

"There's a Grade Four technique!" he exclaimed in delight.

Most of the widely circulated manuals in the Wu and Yue States were of Grade One and Two. Grade Three and Grade Four techniques and spells were generally kept secret by clans, while those beyond that grade were monopolized by the immortal sects.

Upon hearing this, everyone gathered around him eagerly. Li Yuanjiao read the manual carefully before remarking, "How rare! This is a Grade Four spell from the Slaughter Jun Gate, a minor sect in the Wu State! It's known as the Slaughter Jun Kui Light, requiring different types of cold qi or cold water in its practice. To learn this spell, nine different cold qi or three types of cold water are needed. To master it, one would need nine different cold qi and nine types of cold water to make eighty-one variations!"

"Typically, these cold qi and water are to be absorbed into the left index finger... On the battlefield, a hand seal can be performed to unleash the Slaughter Jun Kui Light. This can obstruct an enemy's mana circulation. Once mastered, it could freeze even Qi Cultivators," he continued explaining.

Once Li Yuanjiao finished his explanation, Li Qinghong took the manual and examined it. With a regretful sigh, she said, "I can't use this. Thunder is associated with fire, and this spell relies on the cold. It's unsuitable for me, especially since the cold must be absorbed into the index finger..."

Li Yuanjiao nodded. His family practiced the River One Qi Technique and Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual, both of which were compatible with this spell. The Cold Pine Snow Qi, gathered by the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual, could even be used to cultivate this spell.

The Earth Fiend's Cold Spring spirit water at home could also be used.

"Slaughter Jun Gate..." Li Yuanjiao repeated the name, feeling a sense of familiarity with it.

"I think that old monkey used to train in this sect... The White Monkey's Travel Notes described the cultivation techniques of this sect as gloomy and cold. The ancestors of the sect were wealthy and possessed several secret techniques. This gate was later destroyed by the devil cultivators, which is why this manual has ended up in our hands."

The spell required numerous types of cold qi and cold water, with nine varieties needed just to begin. Given the difficulty of starting the cultivation itself, Li Yuanjiao decided to set it aside for now. He planned to gather cold qi from other families before attempting to cultivate it.

Li Yuanjiao spent half a year in seclusion to stabilize his cultivation. With the aid of a talisman pill, he successfully broke through to the ninth layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and could finally see the hope of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Now that he had emerged from seclusion, he inquired about the situation at home and found that most of the clan's cultivators had also retreated into seclusion.

The situation with the devil plague clan had eased, and many overdue clan wages were settled. Some had made progress in their cultivation, while others had saved enough to purchase pills to aid in their breakthroughs.

Li Qinghong had improved significantly after a period of combating the devil plague. However, she was still accumulating her cultivation in the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and had yet to break through to the eighth heavenly layer.

As soon as Li Yuanjiao left his seclusion, he received a letter from Smoke Valley Temple. Chen Donghe had finally managed to gather a portion of Golden Yang Radiant Origin spiritual qi, which brought Li Yuanjiao great joy. He requested Li Qinghong to oversee the family and set off westward personally.

However, upon crossing Mount Xiping and arriving at Smoke Valley Temple, Li Yuanjiao's joy quickly turned to dismay.

The ancient city wall, which had once stretched for thousands of li, had collapsed in several places, leaving it fractured into three or four sections. The remaining portions of the wall were now mottled and cracked.

Chen Donghe flew toward him and greeted him. His face was still pale and he seemed to have gained fresh wounds before his old wounds had even fully recovered.

Li Yuanjiao pointed at the damaged wall and frowned in silence. Chen Donghe quickly explained, "It was the work of those devil cultivators. Many frequently crossed the border this year. While most were just passing by, some grew greedy and besieged Smoke Valley Temple... During the battles, the ancient city wall was repeatedly impacted, leading to its current state."

Chen Donghe sighed and continued with a tinge of sadness evident in his voice, "This was also why the progress of gathering the Golden Yang Radiant Origin spirit qi had been delayed by half a year. The wall, which used to be able to support three people for qi harvesting, can now accommodate only two."

Li Yuanjiao felt a headache coming. Repairing the wall would not resolve the issue; the Golden Yang Radiant Origin required the presence of an ancient pass. Further repairs might just jeopardize this qi gathering location.

Should I send people to protect this place?

Li Yuanjiao was aware that there were only very few people in the main family who could fight. Sending more people to protect this place would only further delay their cultivation and expose them to danger.

"This place is too dilapidated; the qi gathering efficiency is very low. We may need to send someone to search for another suitable site," Li Yuanjiao concluded, taking the jade box from Chen Donghe.

He opened it gently, revealing the flowing red and golden light within, and nodded in pleased approval. He then asked, "Does Auntie know about Granduncle's situation? He's her uncle. Perhaps both of you should take a trip back to the clan to pay your respects."

Chen Donghe understood Li Yuanjiao's intention. Taking a trip back to the clan implied that they still had to return here and continue gathering the Golden Yang Radiant Origin spirit qi.

Despite this, Chen Donghe replied, "I'll have to trouble you to escort her back to the clan to pay her respects. It's becoming increasingly difficult to gather qi here... I'd better seize the opportunity to gather more, so I won't be returning with her."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement, then sent someone to fetch Li Jingtian. Shortly afterward, the messenger returned to him and informed him that Li Jingtian refused to return home. She would, however, offer distant respects and put on a mourning garb as a gesture of courtesy.

Chen Donghe sighed softly, then bowed slightly to Li Yuanjiao in apology.

Li Yuanjiao understood the gesture and left behind several medicine pills and resources before riding the wind and departing into the smoky sunset, vanishing into the yellow haze alone.

As Li Yuanjiao disappeared from view, Chen Donghe straightened up. He took a seat and leaned against the city wall, staring at the slowly setting sun. He suddenly felt a pang of loneliness.

At sixty years old, with Tian Youdao gone, he had one person less to reminisce about the past with.

"The sunset is blood red, the earth veins are stirring... It seems the fire veins have erupted again," he mumbled quietly to himself.

There were many fire veins in this desert, making it an inhospitable place for mortals. Li Jingtian's health had been declining and she had grown stubborn. When she was younger, she never left Li Yuanjiao in such a difficult position.

Xiao'er... I wonder how she's doing these days...

Chen Donghe, who practiced the River One Qi Technique, should ideally remain near water or the lake. Due to years in the desert, his cultivation had stagnated. He did not seem to mind though. Sitting silently on the gray-white city wall, he hummed a few lines of songs from his hometown.

Li Yuanjiao returned home in a gloomy state and sat on a rock for two hours, gradually regaining his composure. Just as his mood began to lift, he received word that Li Xijun had arrived.

"Have him come up," Li Yuanjiao instructed.

After a brief wait, Li Xijun appeared in a brocade robe. The dharma artifact, Glazed Dusk, had been carefully embedded into a jade ring that hung from his waist, swaying with his every movement like a beautiful pendant.

"Greetings, Second Uncle," Li Xijun greeted, cupping his fists in a respectful yet relaxed manner.
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝘦𝓌𝑒𝑏𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝘭.𝒸𝘰𝑚

Li Yuanjiao assessed him with his spiritual sense and noted, "I see you've condensed the Jade Capital Chakra and reached the Fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... Jade Capital Wheel. You've certainly worked hard."

At sixteen years old, Li Xijun was at the height of his potential. His talent, while impressive, was slightly inferior to that of Li Ximing, who was also nearing the Jade Capital stage at the Xiao residence.

Li Xijun responded humbly to his second uncle's praise. Li Yuanjiao, knowing he had come to request a talisman pill, retrieved a jade bottle from his storage pouch and handed it over.

Li Xijun and Li Ximing would reach the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm after taking this talisman pill. However, there was only a portion of Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi available.

After carefully choosing his words, Li Yuanjiao said warmly, "Jun'er, we only have a portion of Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi at home. Given the issues with the qi source in the desert, it may be over ten years before we can acquire another portion..."

Li Xijun nodded, mildly surprised to find himself in a similar situation that his elder brother, Li Xicheng, had previously faced. However, his personality was completely different from Li Xicheng. He merely responded respectfully, saying, "Xijun will obey the elder's commands!"

He did not give Li Yuanjiao an easy way out, so Li Yuanjiao fell silent. Li Xijun lowered his gaze and waited for two breaths until he could no longer bear watching the guilt on his elder's face.

He smiled and continued, "Xijun is rather fond of the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique. It's cold and ethereal, suitable for swordsmanship. That Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual sounds like an overblown show of wealth and lacks appeal."

Li Xijun's attempt at joking did little to lift Li Yuanjiao's spirits. The Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual was only a Grade Three cultivation technique, while the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual was a rare Grade Four ancient technique. Consuming the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi would determine one's path for the next century.

This was a serious matter that impacted the lives of all the precious descendants of the Li Family, not a joke that one could simply laugh and forget about. Li Yuanjiao was overwhelmed by emotions and frustrations, yet found himself unable to articulate them. In the end, all he could do was sigh.

"Once you stabilize your cultivation after the breakthrough, you can retrieve the Cold Pine Snow Qi from the foot of the mountain and prepare for the next step," he said.

He then retrieved the Slaughter Jun Kui Light manual and handed it over to Li Xijun apologetically. In an unusually gentle tone, he said, "This is the latest Grade Four spell our family has acquired... Study it carefully first before you begin practicing it slowly. Return to me when you're able to absorb cold qi and cold water."

Unlike the Cold Pine Snow Qi, the bottle of Earth Fiend's Cold Spring at home was a limited resource. Initially, Li Yuanjiao was hesitant to use this spell. However, after carefully reviewing the manual and discovering that only a small amount of spirit water was required, he decided to provide it.

"Thank you, Second Uncle!"

Li Xijun nodded calmly, then accepted the manual and carefully read its contents. After swearing the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, he cupped his fist and took his leave.

After he departed, a thought struck Li Yuanjiao. He wrote a letter, which he handed to a subordinate and instructed, "Go to Xianyou Peak and find out Ximing's cultivation progress. See if he has broken through to the Jade Capital stage then return quickly."

"Wait."

He retracted the letter and added something to it, then said, "Have him request to come home; I'll fetch him myself."
