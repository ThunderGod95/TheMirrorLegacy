# Chapter 772: The Sword

The flames boiled, flowing down the heavenly light. The hand on his neck tightened. Situ Mo still couldn’t understand.

*Why?*

How could Li Zhouwei have found him on this vast, flowing river? Situ Mo's initial shock quickly gave way to a cold understanding. Li Zhouwei must have been guided by a Purple Mansion cultivator. But why would Li Zhouwei reveal himself? Wouldn't it be better to flee straight to the Eastern Sea?

The Purple Mansion masters might not be able to track Li Zhouwei, but could they not track *him*? Situ Mo had been released by them, yes, but how could their profound abilities not include a few watching eyes? No matter how fast Li Zhouwei fled, he could never outrun a Purple Mansion cultivator.

'Why did he have to eliminate me, the knife?'

'Unless... the Purple Mansion cultivator guiding Li Zhouwei *wanted* him to eliminate me... But their eyes are definitely on me. Even if he uses that talisman again... can he really escape?'

But he had no time to speak. Bright Yang and heavenly light erupted from his face. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light from Li Zhouwei's brow exploded Situ Mo's entire head into a mist of bone and gore. Scalding blood vaporized instantly into golden baleful qi.

The Golden Tang Gate Master, who had fought the Li family for four generations, finally melted away in the scorching Bright Yang light. All that remained were two storage bags and a dim, diamond-patterned golden robe hanging from the Grand Ascension Halberd, its empty sleeves flapping in the wind.

*Clatter.*

Brilliant golden needles fell from the sky, scattering onto the river's surface. This precious set of Foundation Establishment Dharma Artifacts was drawn up by the heavenly light and floated back into the air. Li Zhouwei withdrew his halberd, his body turning into a streak of light.

*BOOM!*

As Situ Mo perished, the sky rapidly brightened. The woods around Lake Xian stirred, every leaf rustling as it drooped. The calm water rippled violently. A massive surge of golden baleful qi struck the lake, pulling at the celestial phenomena above, scattering the clouds and mist. A deep autumn chill spread, and the night passed in an instant, revealing the dawn.

Situ Mo had been a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator who practiced a secret art and had his sights set on the Purple Mansion Realm. His sudden death meant his essence and life force were largely preserved, creating a swift and violent phenomenon.

The golden baleful qi touched the heavens before descending, making contact with Lake Xian's surface and bed. Gold is the child of Earth. The scene instantly became a hundred times more brilliant. The lake's surface shifted between azure, blue, and red as the earth-veins vibrated, clearly nurturing a new mineral vein below.

Li Zhouwei did not suppress the death phenomenon. The changing sky and trembling earth instantly drew countless gazes. Instead of fleeing to the Eastern Sea, he flared his Dharma light and appeared against the brightening sky by the riverbank. Placing two fingers before his chest, he surged his spiritual qi.

*BOOM!*

The river gurgled past as the sky grew brighter with the morning glow. A Radiant Pass materialized from thin air. Piles of white bricks stacked high, its corner towers rising, golden and resplendent. It tore through the void with tremendous momentum, illuminating the surroundings from within the clouds.

Powered by Li Zhouwei's full strength, the Radiant Pass shone over Lake Xian, visible from far and wide, attracting observers. Li Zhouwei stood beneath it, clad in platinum armor, holding his halberd.

The view here was open—the former shore of the Profound Peak Gate's territory. As he simply stood there, gazes from the Great Void locked onto him one by one. Streaks of light even whistled in from over the river, stopping cautiously over the lake nearby.

Li Zhouwei remained motionless. His platinum armor gleamed under the radiant light. He planted his halberd on the ground, raised his head to the sky, and his voice boomed like thunder:

"Li Zhouwei of the Moongaze Li Clan is here! If you intend to kill me to prevent future trouble, then make your move!"

The sound rolled across the lake. After a moment of brief silence, no one answered.

Li Zhouwei's grip on the Grand Ascension Halberd tightened, his knuckles whitening. With a *clang*, he set the halberd upright in the air beside him and actually sat cross-legged beneath the Radiant Pass, taking a jade box from his back.

The box was as bright green as jadeite, with clean, elegant lines. The lid slid open smoothly, revealing a cyan blade.

The sword was four feet five inches long, its body a blend of cyan and white. The edge was pure white and magnificent, its light shimmering like water. Two ancient characters were engraved on the center of the blade:

**Qingchi**

Amidst the chilling gleam, the sword seemed to pulse faintly. The hilt was wrapped in simple black cloth, meticulously trimmed by the original owner, with rounded edges. Where the tassel hung, two more words faintly appeared:

**Annihilation**

This was Seven-Foot Azure Nether Bronze, a Metal of the Supreme Yin and Lesser Yin. After years of care, its cyan-white hue had only deepened. Even under the brilliant radiant light, the sword’s own gleam shot toward the sky.

Li Zhouwei simply placed the jade box on his knees and waited.

Points of bright escaping light quickly appeared over the river, drawing closer. After two breaths, six cultivators in gray-white robes arrived, nearing the lake's surface.

Their robes were gray and white with golden trim—the attire of Changxiao Gate. The leader was handsome and tall, his eyebrows slanted up to his temples, carrying the air of a true immortal adept. He was clearly a high disciple of an immortal gate, but his expression was complicated.

Seeing the young man sitting unmoving beneath the Radiant Pass, the man flicked his sleeve. He did not attack immediately, but turned his head and asked, "Where is the Daoist Master? This man fled to Lake Xian, making us wait at Moongaze for nothing. Now that we are here, why is the Daoist Master not present?"

A cultivator beside him bowed. "Martial Uncle Yunan, Zhaojing is outside. The Purple Mansion cultivators within the sea have no reason to privately harm a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Daoist Master Chengyan should be supporting us from the Great Void."

Yunan Zi was usually stationed overseas and had a fiery temper, but he understood the affairs within the sea. Hearing this, his anger flared. "Baibin Zi, you are too soft! What is there to fear? This is a Purple Mansion Seed! I hear he has destiny on his side and is far more terrifying than Zhaojing. Isn't it more dangerous to let him escape? If the Daoist Master just killed him with one palm, the Moongaze Li Clan is still on the lake, a weakness we can still hold. If Zhaojing dares to harm one of our disciples, we can just grab a Li clan direct descendant and kill them. What can he do?"

Baibin Zi whispered, "Martial Uncle, you are used to killing overseas, but it is different here. The Li Clan has ties to several Purple Mansion families and is an immortal clan itself, with several in-laws among them. Even a Daoist Master can not kill and fears such retribution. Brazenly harming a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion line is not something the various houses will tolerate."

"Cowardice only leaves behind future disaster! ...All those ambushes on the lake... we let him escape. The Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope isn't here, and now we're short one Situ Mo!"

Baibin Zi could only try to placate him. "Martial Uncle, do not be angry. Fortunately, several Daoist Masters kept an eye on Situ Mo. Daoist Master Chengyan, following the Grand Daoist Master's orders, had us stand guard at the lake while he personally tailed Situ Mo. Now, we have caught our fish."

"What's more, Daoist Master Chengyan said... Li Zhouwei is too dangerous, and the other sects only want to fan the flames. If things go wrong, he will personally act. Even risking retaliation, he will capture Li Zhouwei. We are just trying the low-cost method first."

"Situ Mo wasn't bait for *him*! Without Situ Mo, do you know how many things can no longer be done?!" Yunan Zi retorted angrily as the group came to a halt over the lake.

Yunan Zi squinted, looking at the Radiant Pass in the clouds. Its aura was shocking, and he finally grew serious. He stared intently at the young man, shook his sleeves, and said, "Bring your swords. We can capture him just the same!"

The others immediately moved closer. Just as Yunan Zi moved his fingers to form an incantation, the young man abruptly raised his head. A pair of golden pupils stabbed toward him. Yunan Zi froze, his anger turning into a chilling palpitation.

'No wonder the Grand Daoist Master wants him captured...'

Yet, facing six sudden opponents, Li Zhouwei didn't say another word, nor did he form any seals for a Dharma Art. The first thing the young man did was tie the cyan-white treasured sword to a prominent place on his armor.

The group, feeling profoundly slighted, glanced at each other. Baibin Zi had already taken a glowing ring from his sleeve. It was only the size of his palm and as thick as a finger. He pinched the ring and looked at the man below, a silent doubt in his mind.

'Strange…'

There was no time to think. Every extra hour brought another variable. The cultivator showed no mercy, immediately bringing out a Spirit Artifact. He raised the glowing ring and chanted, "Dispel the light and scatter the sharpness, let the sun dim and stars fall. Do not let bright fire be born, do not nourish its qi..."

As he spoke, Yunan Zi led the charge. The Daoist held a thin technique sword, which pulsed with rings of golden light. He acted decisively, striking first.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him and drew his halberd. With a surge of strength, the weapon lunged like a flood dragon emerging from the water, thick with black flames. Yunan Zi, relying on his extra years of cultivation and his experience overseas, did not flinch, meeting the halberd's light head-on.

*CLANG!*

With a metallic shockwave, Yunan Zi's longsword was uncontrollably forced upward. The Geng Metal light on the blade was corroded by the black flames and vanished completely. Li Zhouwei was unforgiving. Pinning the blade, the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light erupted from his brow and shot forward.

The golden Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light suddenly expanded. This Dharma Art, enhanced by Concealed Plunder Gold, pierced the distance. It wasn't aimed at Yunan Zi, but shot instantly toward Baibin Zi, who was casting his spell further away.

The attack was too fast. Baibin Zi never expected Li Zhouwei to ignore the other five and attack him from afar. Caught off guard, a halo of light appeared around Baibin Zi, barely blocking the blast. It burned fiercely, sizzling and crackling.

Baibin Zi's chant faltered, causing the light in his hand to flicker. The others, feeling slighted, brandished their own Dharma Artifacts. Li Zhouwei pulled his halberd back, sweeping it horizontally to scatter the attacks from two opponents as his two black-flame halberds shot out to intercept the enemy artifacts.

One remaining Radiant Fire Dharma Art was fast and fierce, shaped like a sparrow. It had a strange brownish-yellow hue, clearly empowered by a spirit flame and not just a simple technique. Its power was immense. Before it even reached his back, flames erupted all around.

A small banner immediately appeared behind Li Zhouwei. Five-colored Radiant Fire swept out and collided with the attack, blocking it. But the enemy Radiant Fire suddenly changed color, and a sword shot out from within it. The sword blazed with fire, its light flashing—it was a sword-control technique.

"Excellent technique, Junior Brother Zhuang!"

The Radiant Fire user was clearly powerful. Yunan Zi knew his strength and had specifically chosen him for this. Now, Yunan Zi also drew his sword, unleashing his own long-brewing Dharma Art. He released a wind of Radiant Essence, pressing toward Li Zhouwei.

But Li Zhouwei was unhurried. The Radiant Pass behind him flared brightly. Heavenly light descended, gently suppressing the flying fire-sword. He feinted with his halberd, then stabbed back toward another person nearby.

He held off all five Changxiao cultivators by himself, showing no sign of strain. Facing Yunan Zi's wind of Radiant Essence, he was fearless. He swept his halberd, turned his head, and shot the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light from his brow at the sword of the cultivator named Zhuang.

A short distance away, although Baibin Zi had been interrupted, his cultivation was profound. Within a few breaths, he finished the spell. He gently tossed the light ring, which expanded rapidly in the air until it was the size of a courtyard and as thick as a tree trunk. Waves of spiritual light pulsed from it, enveloping everything.

In an instant, the color of the Radiant Pass behind Li Zhouwei dimmed. The flames on the Radiant Fire banner flickered, and even the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light on his brow shrank.

Only the black flames on his halberd raged on, undiminished, even forcing the spiritual light from the sky back by a fraction.

"A Spirit Artifact," Li Zhouwei stated, bracing his halberd. Yunan Zi's wind of Radiant Essence was still swirling around the weapon, dispelling the Bright Yang spiritual qi. Attacks assailed him from both sides, forcing him to take a step back.

Yunan Zi and the man named Zhuang were both direct descendants. The other three were slightly weaker, but two were still late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. With Baibin Zi controlling a Spirit Artifact from above, the contingent Changxiao Gate had sent was clearly intended to overwhelm him.

He stood firm as the Changxiao cultivators slowly spread out to surround him. Baibin Zi, operating the Spirit Artifact in the sky, watched him carefully, the shadow of doubt in his mind refusing to disperse.

"Still no orders from the Daoist Master... How strange. Whether it's to kill or capture... there should be an order!"

A cold wind whistled through the upper sky. Baibin Zi was almost distracted. He looked up. Higher in the sky, a faint wisp of cyan was drifting northwest.

Baibin Zi was a high-level cultivator from Changxiao Gate. He certainly knew what that cyan wisp was. It was the "Treasured Tassel Spring Breeze" from the Sword Gate. It flew from the top of the Sword Peak, traveled all the way to Lake Xian to merge with the daytime sea breeze, and nourished the lands of Jiangnan. It was a precious commodity, but no one dared collect it within the Sword Gate's territory.

'Before merging with the sea breeze, the Treasured Tassel Spring Breeze travels through Sword Gate territory... Is this its path? ...Why is it blowing over the Profound Peak Gate?'

His expression froze. A white light flashed from his hand, and he snatched a rogue cultivator from the air nearby. The man had been enjoying the show and was caught completely off guard, nearly spitting up blood in terror.

Baibin Zi grabbed his throat and hissed, "Whose territory is this?! Wasn't Profound Peak eaten by... the Capital immortals Dao?"

The man was a local rogue cultivator. He stammered in fear, "Daoist, sir... Profound Peak hasn't had any territory by the lake for a long time! I heard that the entire area around Lake Xian was secretly returned to the Sword Gate. It's been Sword Gate territory for ages! The Xuanmiao Temple also hurried to hand over their land. From here all the way north, including more than half of Lake Xian's surface... it's all Sword Gate land!"

"Sir, they say that if a sword cultivator looks up from here, they can even see the glow of the Sword Peak!"

Baibin Zi and the others had been in seclusion for years. The moment they came out, they were pulled into this ambush on the lake, all within a day or two. They only knew the Capital immortals Dao had annexed Profound Peak; they had no idea about any of this. His heart pounded.

"So that's it! No wonder... He unexpectedly walked right into the 'trap'... No wonder!"
