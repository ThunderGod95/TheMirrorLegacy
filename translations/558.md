# Chapter 856: Calamity

On the riverbank.

The demonic smoke on the northern bank was heavy and dark. Cultivators from all factions in the north gathered in small camps on the shore. The major forces each occupied a corner, their auras converging and flowing down the river with an imposing momentum.

Even more northern rogue cultivators were visible further back. At a glance, the sky was full of fleeing lights, just waiting for the riverbank’s formation to break so they could flood into the south.

The rolling demonic smoke halted at the river’s edge. A bright checkpoint hung suspended in the air. Gleaming white bricks that radiated grandeur were fitted tightly together. The city gate towered high, with two white pillars at its base carved with many runes and mysterious incantations.

A brilliant light shimmered inside the city gate, as if aligned with a Bright Yang. The dazzling light radiated outwards, piercing the black smoke and forcing the devil cultivators to retreat.

At the very top of the checkpoint sat a young man clad in a golden Daoist robe. A palm-sized white disc, covered in intricate patterns, floated in front of him. The youth sat upright, quietly watching the cultivators on the other side of the riverbank.

He was accompanied by another figure in a white feathered robe, a spirit fan at his waist. He stood gracefully, carrying a sword in his arms. His gaze was on the north as he pondered.

Li Xizhi was originally supposed to report to Mount Bianyan, but the entire north had been engulfed by demonic smoke a few hours ago. Mount Bianyan stood isolated in the black fog, giving him an excuse to stop at the checkpoint.

After all, Li Xizhi had no desire to face the group of Chi Family members at Mount Bianyan. Besides, his own territory lay just beyond this grand formation, so he was all too happy to remain on guard now that something had changed.

He had taken a short blade from a devil cultivator, examined it carefully, and exchanged it for a Foundation Establishment Realm sword. It was completely brownish-yellow in color and was called Xushi. Because of its rather poor materials, its quality was not high and ranked near the bottom among Foundation Establishment Realm weapons.

After some careful inquiries, he learned that this sword actually came from Yuanwu Peak. It had been forged in the early years by Tang Shejun, a member of the Tang Family who had died while trying to break through to Purple Mansion Realm. The sword was now over a hundred years old.

“What a coincidence...”

Li Chejing’s Qingche Sword from back then had also been forged by the same Tang Shejun when he was the peak master of Yuanwu Peak. After looking at his options, Li Xizhi found nothing better and ultimately chose this sword.

“What exactly is happening at the Great Ning Palace...”

Half an hour earlier, the number of devil cultivators gathering at Li Ximing’s front line had grown. When some started to occasionally test the defenses, he had manifested his Immortal Foundation and stood atop the formation.

Regardless of Li Ximing’s personal strength, his late stage Foundation Establishment Realm Immortal Foundation, condensed with a fourth-grade technique, was truly intimidating. When Li Xizhi, also at late stage Foundation Establishment Realm, stood beside him, they were more than enough to deter the crowd. The riverbank had many crossing points, so the devil cultivators, seeing that he was not to be trifled with, naturally gathered elsewhere.

“Only the direct northern cultivators have gone to the Great Ning Palace, and they haven’t been seen since. The rest are easy to fool... They have no real fighting spirit...”

Li Ximing was no fool and picked his moments carefully. But even though many devil cultivators withdrew, his mood remained low.

He waited for a moment. A female cultivator in green robes flew from afar and landed at his side. She wore a light turquoise Daoist robe, with brilliant dharma light shimmering. Her beautiful face carried a hint of restrained anger, but she paused slightly when she saw Li Ximing.

“Greetings, Senior Lingu,” said Li Ximing.

This was Lingu Lanying, who was also guarding the riverbank. She had lost her mount and spirit pet during the earlier chaos, and had only just flown back in recent days to defend the riverbank.

She took out a jade talisman and handed it to Li Xizhi, speaking softly, “News from Bianyan.”

Li Xizhi focused intently as his spiritual sense probed the talisman. Lingu Lanying spoke bluntly, “News from Mount Bianyan... Chi Zhiyan is being forceful and decisive, ordering more troops and saying reinforcements will arrive soon. He’s telling us to hold this place.”

She laughed sarcastically as she continued, “On the other hand, my family received news that although he’s sent people back to recruit more cultivators, he’s also gathered all the members of his direct bloodline at Mount Bianyan. Clearly, he wants us to clash head-on with the devil cultivators...”

Li Xizhi sighed inwardly. Chi Zhiyan had never been a magnanimous person. Although he put on a good show of being gracious and approachable, his true nature was revealed the moment he had to act.

The Li Family had wanted to receive this order to hold, since their Moongaze Lake was just behind the defensive line. Li Xizhi and the others wanted the Azure Pond Sect to stand firm and resist the devil cultivators. So although Chi Zhiyan was acting out of his own interests, it ultimately aligned with the Li Family’s needs.

But the devil cultivators were pressing so fiercely that he was gathering up all the Azure Pond Sect direct descendants, Chi Family guest cultivators, and Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators back at Mount Bianyan, leaving the various families to hold the line. Clearly, he didn’t value their lives at all, he only wanted to squeeze out their last ounce of worth.

Li Ximing sat quietly on the radiant pass, exchanging a glance with his brother. Both of them understood perfectly and watched coldly, thinking, Mount Bianyan, though on the far bank and isolated in the north, is actually the safest place. Its layers of formations are formidable. The devil cultivators will flow downstream like water. They would rather crash into our weaker earthen dike than break themselves on that rock.

After all, the grand formation on Mount Bianyan could be seen from far away. Disregarding whether or not it could be breached, the first devils to charge it would certainly die. Meanwhile, the river crossing’s defenses were full of holes. If the devil cultivators could find just one weak spot, they only needed to reach out to grasp the wealth of Jiangnan.

Chi Zhiyan gathering his direct descendants at Mount Bianyan is truly a no-lose position. Even if Purple Mansion Realm cultivators never show up and all lines in Jiangnan collapse, it’s just another plundering of the north...

When the order came down, Lingu Lanying, Li Xizhi, and even the various families all saw the truth. This man was indeed a narrow-minded schemer. Now that he’d shed his mask, his actions basically spelled it out, Your own families’ foundation lies beyond the river. Surely the devil cultivators can’t break into Mount Azure Pond, can they? If you can’t hold it, that’s your own misfortune!

Li Ximing was silent for a couple of breaths, then replied, “What do you think, Senior?”

Lingu Lanying’s apricot eyes widened slightly as she answered, “We’ve already sent someone back to report to the sect master. If Chi Zhiyan is acting like this, how can the riverbank be held?!”

Li Xizhi shook his head slightly and said softly, “It’s too late. Besides, the sect’s disciples are very good at self-preservation. Would they really fight to the death with us? Even if they came here, they’d only watch from the sidelines.”

His words were tactful but clear. The Chi Family’s disciples were extremely privileged. Even if they were sent here, would they really follow the orders of people like Li Xizhi?

Li Xizhi paused for a couple of breaths, then added, “If they actually do send people over, I fear the elders would have their own demands, which would make things even harder to handle.”

“This...”

Li Xizhi had reminded Lingu Lanying of an important fact. It would be one thing if the Chi Family really came to guard the formation and took over command. But if things went even a little wrong and they demanded an escort to leave, what then?

The female cultivator looked at him with renewed attention and said gently, “After all, it’s still a force... Sigh! What exactly is happening at the Great Ning Palace? It doesn’t look like the north and south have completely fallen out... This place is full of holes. We can hold it for a while, but certainly not for days or months... Why hasn’t the Daoist Master said a word?”

Li Xizhi offered comfort, “The Daoist Master hasn’t responded. Perhaps he’s still fighting the devil cultivators. It’s been six hours. Though Purple Mansion Realm duels can be long, they wouldn’t stretch on for months. If we hold on long enough, perhaps there’ll be a turning point.”

Lingu Lanying fell slightly silent. She too knew that Moongaze Lake lay just beyond the grand formation, and the Li Family would naturally be more anxious than anyone. Meanwhile, her own Lingu Family, deeply rooted in the south, would likely be less affected.

Most of Lingu Lanying’s urgency was for her family’s disciples inside the formation and for the people of the counties that would suffer if the line broke. Her concern should be far inferior to that of the Li Family.

She settled down and said softly, “Besides the families on the riverbank, there’s also the Xiao Family, a Purple Mansion Realm immortal family. What if Daoist Master Chuting decides to intervene...”

She spoke the words, but in her heart she knew the hope was slim. Sure enough, she saw Li Xizhi shake his head. “The Xiao Family has been secluded for years. Their Daoist Master has long made it clear that he doesn’t want to interfere. He even went to the Northern Sea a while back. The devil cultivators aren’t stupid; they won’t even touch a scrap of Xiao Family territory.”

Everyone present reached the same conclusion in their heart, Xiao Chuting didn’t intervene even when Lixia slaughtered the prefecture and the Xiao Family’s own lands were massacred. There are so many hidden agendas in today’s north-south conflict, and he’s always been the most rational and meticulous. Why would he get involved now?

They didn’t dare to speak the words aloud, except for Lingu Lanying, who nodded and said, “Then I’ll return to the formation to stand guard.”

She rode the wind away, and only then did Li Ximing speak, his voice somewhat low, “Brother... Could the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators really be willing to sacrifice all these families here and let the northern cultivators flood south? Even the Azure Pond Sect would suffer a huge loss of vital qi... Why would they do that...”

“Hard to say.” Li Xizhi responded and asked, “Has the family replied?”

“Not yet.” Li Ximing activated a secret technique and spoke quietly, “But a few days ago, Zhouwei reached the seventh layer of Qi Cultivation Realm. He’s carrying a Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill and a Talisman Pill on this trip. With those two combined, he might soon have a chance at Foundation Establishment Realm.

“Foundation Establishment Realm... and he’s not even twenty yet... Even if he secluded himself for five years, he’d still only be twenty-five...”

Li Xizhi frowned, circulating his secret technique, and said softly, “That’s a bit too fast. It’s almost catching up to Daoist Master Junjian’s cultivation speed. Zhouwei’s innate talent is exceptional; he could have built up more strength. But the situation keeps changing, and there’s no time to go slowly.”

Li Ximing sat quietly atop the Radiant Pass, his voice soft. “Not necessarily. People like him can’t be measured by ordinary logic. For him, adapting to the times is more important than slow accumulation. If he establishes his foundation, what difference does one or two spell arts make? How many high-grade Bright Yang spell arts can our family even afford to let him learn before he reaches Foundation Establishment Realm?”

Li Xizhi paused, tilted his head to look at Li Ximing, and nodded in agreement, “Brother Ximing, you have a point.

“We have to get through this hurdle first.”

Li Ximing looked ahead. Dharma light illuminated the world, and torrential rain was pouring between heaven and earth. But it evaporated with a hissing sound before it could even hit the Radiant Pass beneath his feet.

The demonic smoke surged rapidly, countless tendrils of fleeing light shooting out from it, dragging rolling black clouds in their wake. Five beams of light flew close, heading straight for the formation beneath the two men’s feet.

Northern cultivators followed the five devil cultivators like a swarm of locusts, landing one after another in front of the formation. Li Ximing activated his Immortal Foundation and casually selected two of them, smashing down with force.

Boom!

A brilliant light shot out from the grand checkpoint. The Radiant Pass was best at honing and suppressing, and it also countered devil cultivators. Bright light flowed from it, causing the two being suppressed to curse loudly and hastily summon their dharma artifacts to defend themselves.

“Hmph...!”

Their bodies sank under the pressure. Their curses stuck halfway in their throats, turning into muffled grunts. Both of them were only at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, how could they endure such a blow from Li Ximing’s late stage Foundation Establishment Realm Immortal Foundation?

One of them shouted, “Back there! This guy’s Immortal Foundation is weird, like a solid object... Someone get over here and help!”

Li Xizhi drew his sword. His gaze swept over the five, picking out the one with the highest cultivation, a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm old devil. He vanished, and a misty golden glow danced in the air. He suddenly appeared behind the cultivator, casting a sleeve of Heavenly Glow.

Gold In Cloud!

The devil cultivator was so frightened that he hurriedly drew the long blade at his waist, but he was caught completely off guard. He didn’t even have time to release any blade energy as Li Xizhi formed another hand seal. He stepped to the side, splitting into several Rainbow Phantom Splits, each forming a seal and chanting.

The old devil was completely unprepared. Li Xizhi even had time to watch his reactions, finding his movements suspicious. All six phantoms drew their swords simultaneously, sending out arcs of white crescent-shaped sword light.

It was Li Xizhi’s first time wielding a Foundation Establishment Realm sword. Xushi allowed his sword light to carry half again its usual strength as it shone with a sharp brilliance.

The old devil finally found the chance to release a wave of chilling blade light, but it was instantly shattered by the sword light. His figure was flung aside in a splash of blood. A miserable howl hung in the air as he reappeared a few meters away, too terrified to stop as he frantically formed hand seals.

Li Xizhi saw that the man’s lineage was shallow, so he summoned a single rainbow light, then tugged and twisted it in the clouds. The man’s spiritual energy instantly fell into chaos. Li Xizhi casually stripped his spell art from his hands and advanced calmly.

The old devil couldn’t hold back any longer and shouted, “Help, quickly!”
𝘧𝘳𝘦ℯ𝓌𝘦𝒷𝘯𝑜𝑣𝘦𝓁.𝒸𝘰𝓂

A swirl of devil winds churned at his feet, revealing a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm female cultivator. She also held a sword, raising its light as she struck at Li Xizhi.

This female cultivator seemed to be of the rare Wood Virtue type of Immortal Foundation from Yue State. A wave of wood spirit qi rose as she swung her sword. Li Xizhi’s expression finally grew a bit serious, and his Immortal Foundation circulated, releasing a flow of multicolored clouds.

He brought two fingers together, and Heavenly Glow appeared. He casually pinched the surging sword energy, then flipped his hand to send out a sleeve of brilliance. The female cultivator’s spirit sword was now in his hand; it was merely at the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Floating Light Gathering! The northern cultivator was visibly stunned, her eyes filled with complete disbelief, There’s actually such a spell art!

Li Xizhi found it all very strange. He had never had the experience of casually leaving his opponent so utterly bewildered, and he felt a tinge of emotion. Since leaving seclusion, the enemies he’d faced were either the first breath of a Dragon Monarch, a prince from the Tuoba Family of Great Liang, or at the very least, deeply entrenched old devils like Chimen Difu with hidden backgrounds.

He’d always found those opponents so difficult to handle that he had almost forgotten that he was the Peak Master of Azure Pond Peak. When facing these northern Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators with no Dao lineage who relied solely on luck and brute strength, the difference was indeed stark.

Yet these two acted like they were facing a dire threat. Even though those last two moves had not been life-or-death struggles, the fact that they had been so easily toyed with revealed the terrifying strength of the man before them.

They exchanged secret messages, “The one before us is probably surnamed Chi! An old devil with years of experience, he’s not easy to deal with. We should call for reinforcements quickly...”

Li Family.

A continuous drizzle dripped and trickled among the treetops on Mount Qingdu. The atmosphere felt a bit gloomy inside the grand hall. The elder paced a few rounds in the hall, holding a letter in his hand.

He called someone in, his heart heavy, and said, "Go and summon the heir."

The letter contained some speculations by Li Ximing and Li Xizhi about the situation between the north and the south. Li Xuanxuan had just received it and glanced through a few lines, but it had immediately made him rather uneasy.

"The northern devil cultivators have lost their restraint and are swarming south. How could the defenses on the riverbank possibly hold?"

Li Xuanxuan read the letter over and over, unable to find peace in his heart. Li Ximing advised him to send the heir to the Eastern Sea, clearly implying they might not be able to hold the riverbank.

The letter even urged Li Xuanxuan and the others to flee to the Eastern Sea as well, which made the old man frown deeply and sigh heavily.

How could I abandon the lake and run? I have lived long enough already. If the north falls and the devil cultivators come south all the way to Moongaze Lake, I will still hold my ground to the last moment...

Someone needs to give an account if something happens to the sons and disciples. I should lead them to meet the ancestors in the netherworld. If the family is destroyed, there must be blood spilled.

He sat down and pondered for a few seconds, feeling much more composed in his heart. After a while, Li Zhouwei came in, wearing his armor. He was only eighteen years old, but he was already at the seventh layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, with strong dharma light emanating from him. He was almost progressing one layer per year.

Although the breakthroughs in the later stages of Qi Cultivation Realm were especially difficult and normally required several times the effort, at his speed, he would likely reach Foundation Establishment Realm at around twenty-two or twenty-three years old if he relied solely on self-cultivation.

But the later stages of Qi Cultivation Realm were quite different for the Li Family. They had the Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill and the Talisman Pill. After building up enough cultivation, they could first take the Breaking Realm Pill to break through, then steady their foundation before taking the Talisman Pill.

The Talisman Pill’s effects were not comparable to ordinary pills. The cultivation it provided was real and solid, as if achieved through self-cultivation. In some ways, it was perhaps even better, and one could immediately attempt to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Without waiting for him to be greeted, Li Xuanxuan waved Li Zhouwei into the hall and handed him the letter. Li Zhouwei glanced through it and frowned. After a moment, seeing his golden eyes flicker, Li Xuanxuan said, "According to your uncle’s description, the riverbank may not hold."

Li Xuanxuan thought of sending him to the Eastern Sea but worried he might insist on staying at home, so he hesitated and only asked, "What does Minghuang think?"

Li Zhouwei read the letter carefully again and replied, "Looking at the situation, if the riverbank falls and the devil cultivators flood into Jiangnan, they will likely take two routes. One goes down along Moongaze Lake, and the other squeezes through the wilderness between Shanji Prefecture and Lixia Prefecture.

"That route is caught between two Purple Mansion Realm powers, so it’s not an easy path. I’m afraid they will still attack our family."

Li Xuanxuan hadn’t expected him to mention this matter. Just as he was about to ask further, he saw Li Zhouwei softly say, "After I head to the Eastern Sea, you should split the family into two routes. One burrows a way to Lixia, the other drives the people toward Mount Dali. Senior White Banyan Fox and that Luken are on good terms with our family and can grant us temporary refuge."

Li Zhouwei explained the arrangements in detail. Li Xuanxuan listened and felt slightly relieved in his heart. He said, "There probably won’t be many people who can be saved in the mountains."

Li Zhouwei nodded and replied, "The devil cultivators could reach here in less than fifteen minutes. The nearly million people along the lakeshore wouldn’t even have time to gather in that short time, let alone all squeeze into the mountains..."

Li Xuanxuan fell silent. Li Zhouwei had no choice but to say, "It’s hard to predict these things. The riverbank might still hold. There are so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan, who knows which of them might act. We’re only making necessary preparations."

Li Xuanxuan nodded and said hoarsely, "There’s no time to lose. Take a group of people, pick some of the young talents from the various families, and bring the pills as well. I will have Kongheng take you there."

Li Zhouwei thought for a moment and said softly, "That works out. Lady An is about to give birth, and the Master Monk is considering the idea that Jiangnan is the Upper Evil Spirit Storage. It would be good to take her along to the Eastern Sea as well. Perhaps things will turn out differently there."

He was a decisive person, and the matter was settled neatly. He bade Li Xuanxuan farewell and immediately flew out of the hall and descended. Less than fifteen minutes later, Kongheng arrived with a few people and landed on the mountain.

The monk was always calm and peaceful, and years of cultivation had made him appear even more unfathomable. There were few clear distinctions among Master Monks, making it hard to guess his true strength.

Yet even those like Li Ximing who had broken through later than him had all reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. This monk probably wasn’t far behind either. The Eastern Sea was chaotic, and the white ape would find it hard to establish a foothold there, but Kongheng would be much safer.

When Kongheng saw Li Xuanxuan, he was very kind and said softly, "Please rest assured, my lord. Your esteemed family has accumulated much virtue and will surely turn calamity into blessing."

Li Xuanxuan disliked hearing talk of virtue and vice. He forced a smile as he sent the people out of the lake, then rode the wind back and sat in the grand hall, where he was once again left all alone.

The elder pondered deeply, unable to determine whether it was virtue or vice he had accumulated. He stopped thinking about it and quietly looked out at the rainy weather outside the window, where white frost had already formed. After a moment, a nine-foot-tall, burly man in white armor came in and silently stood in the hall.

"White ape!" Li Xuanxuan exclaimed. The old ape raised his head, his voice like rocks clashing, "Greetings, Master... this old servant has just returned from patrolling the lake."

The man and the ape had fled the raging flames in the marketplace all those years ago and had accompanied each other for decades, so there was no need to speak of their understanding.

He saw Li Xuanxuan’s unease and moved to his side to stand, then said, "This old servant’s Stone Embrace Slumber technique has been brimming with spiritual energy and running smoothly in recent days. Perhaps there is a Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough in the True Essence Dao, or maybe some spiritual item has emerged."

Li Xuanxuan nodded silently, not perceiving anything unusual from it. Just as he was about to speak, he suddenly felt a cold breeze enter from the door. Li Xuanxuan raised his head slightly, as if something had dawned on him, and was about to stand up when suddenly he heard knocking at the hall door

A handsome man in white entered. He had sword-shaped brows and star-like eyes, a handsome appearance, and held a slightly slender cold sword in his arms. His brows were furrowed slightly in worry as he looked inside.

"Xijun!" Li Xuanxuan was overjoyed and stepped forward, holding the letter in his hand, and asked, "Has your injury fully healed?"

"Greetings, Great Uncle." Li Xijun first saluted, coughed twice, and smiled, "It hasn’t fully healed yet. I was worried about the family, so I came out of seclusion early."

Yu Mujian’s sword strike was indeed formidable. If it hadn’t been for the Earth-View Bloodstone, Li Xijun would likely have fallen on the spot. After several years of recuperation, he couldn’t stop worrying about the situation at home and emerged from seclusion early, with his strength only barely recovered to sixty percent.

Li Xuanxuan was overjoyed, immediately pulling him over to find a seat. The white ape silently served tea. Li Xijun recognized him with a glance and said softly, "So it’s you... truly blessed with deep fortune, congratulations!"

The white ape cupped his fists and withdrew. Li Xuanxuan recounted the events of the past few years in detail. Li Xijun listened, his brows furrowing tighter and tighter.

After a long exhale, he replied, "As expected... I knew Azure Pond Sect wouldn’t have arranged anything good for my family... so it’s come to this."

He lowered his gaze, his eyes gradually reddening as he said softly, "I misjudged... I shouldn’t have trusted that Zhao Tinggui... he died and left everything to ruin my family...

"Qinghong has already ridden the thunder to seek him out..."

Li Xuanxuan didn’t know how to respond. The old man waited a moment and finally said, "But your injuries are not yet fully healed. You cannot act. It’s better to focus on cultivation and seclusion."

Li Xijun closed his eyes and exhaled, still carrying some sorrow. The Radiant Snow Pine Ridge began to circulate inside his body, driving all emotions from his mind.

His tone calmed, and he said softly, "Not necessarily... even with my injuries, I can still strike once or twice without issue."

He shook his head slightly, held one hand level, and revealed a shimmering light condensed from frost and snow in his palm. It was pure white and crystal clear. A wave of cold mixed with sharpness surged around it.

This was not quite a spell art, yet not exactly a spirit item either. It looked like a mass of highly condensed energy. With a thought from Li Xijun, the light leaped like a swimming fish, dancing in the air. Its fine scales were clearly visible as it flicked its tail and fell back into his palm.

"What is this..."

Li Xuanxuan had never seen such a thing before. For a moment he couldn’t figure it out. The old man was stunned for a second, then saw Li Xijun’s sword-shaped brows raise slightly as he said softly, "Sword Essence."

Lake Xian.

Li Qinghong rode the wind fifty kilometers out. The black smoke before her gradually faded, but the sky remained heavy and rolled with gray clouds. The sky was the same gray on both the north and south sides of the lake, dimly hiding the sun.

She flew for a while, and somehow her mind turned again to those two, and she pondered in secret, So it seems at least Crimson Reef Island has been offended. The east and west reefs of Crimson Reef Island have not gotten along in recent years. I don’t know whether Guo Hongjian’s faction is east or west, or if there’s any room to maneuver.

As for Yu Jiang, judging from Guo Hongjian’s attitude, he’s also a powerful figure in the Southern Sea...

As she flew south, she also realized it would be impossible to return to Mount Bianyan, and she felt a sense of relief, That’s fine too. There’s no need to follow their orders... I’ll just return to the riverbank and help guard the lakeshore for my family...

The devil cultivators were already pressed up to the riverbank. She no longer had the heart to deal with that group on Mount Bianyan. Like Li Xizhi, she just wanted to hide as far away as possible.

Turning a corner of Lake Xian, she glimpsed the radiance overflowing from Profound Peak Gate’s Shanji Prefecture. Light flowed in all directions. When she approached, she could faintly see a towering, majestic mountain suspended above Shanji Prefecture.

The mountain loomed vaguely in the clouds, emanating a hazy glow. She could feel her body growing heavier as she drew closer to Shanji Prefecture. She looked up thoughtfully and thought, It must be a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability.

Such power could only belong to Daoist Master Changxi of Profound Peak Gate. Only then did she understand why the demonic mist had stopped at Lake Xian and why the devil cultivators had not crossed into Jiangnan.

The threat hangs high above in the sky... who would dare put even a single step over the lake?

She quickly flew past and vanished into the wilderness by the riverbank. But a beam of golden light caught up and stopped brightly before her, revealing a woman in a Xiang robe.

The woman was dressed in Xiang colors, with a round face and almond eyes, and held a small golden mountain in her hand. She was Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak.

She looked worried as she stepped forward and softly greeted, "Qinghong, little sister."

Li Qinghong had thought she was at the Great Ning Palace, so she was surprised to meet her here. She nodded in reply.

Kong Tingyun spoke softly, "It’s been so long. Why don’t you come sit in my sect for a while?"

"Hmm?"

As soon as she said that, Li Qinghong felt something off. Kong Tingyun had returned from the northern ruins and settled at Mount Yan Pass. The two had even met at Mount Yan Pass days ago, so it was indeed strange to say ‘long time no see’...

That could have been considered a polite greeting from Kong Tingyun, but at this critical time of conflict between the north and south at Azure Pond Sect, it was hardly a leisurely moment. The timing really didn’t make sense.

She was clever enough to not immediately refuse or accept. Instead, she asked, "I should have taken a moment to pay a visit when I passed by Shanji Prefecture, but I noticed something strange in the north..."

Kong Tingyun replied softly, "Something has happened in the Great Ning Palace!"

She moved a few steps closer and used secret techniques to transmit her voice, "Did you think it was strange that the north and south armies are now at odds? That’s because all the Mahas and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from both sides have entered the Great Ning Palace! Now the northern demon horde is out of control, and the southern cultivators have no protection at all!"

Li Qinghong’s pupils widened slightly as Kong Tingyun continued, "My sect’s Daoist Master had a grudge with a few of the new demon leaders, so he didn’t go. I don’t know exactly what happened, but Anhuai Heaven has now appeared in the great void, and all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have entered it."

Li Qinghong’s voice was slightly hoarse as she asked, "The north is already strong, and my second uncle is still in the Great Ning Palace. The defenses along the riverbank are hastily built... how can we possibly resist the northern demon horde...

"Of course, we cannot."

Kong Tingyun nodded firmly, then hesitated a moment and asked softly, "Do you know which route the demon cultivators will take when they move south?"

Li Qinghong had been traveling across the north and south for a few years, so of course she knew. She answered, "After crossing Xu State, they could either enter Wu from the riverbank west of Mount Xiping or follow the entire riverbank south. Any spot would let them into Yue State..."

Kong Tingyun nodded, a solemn expression appearing on her round face, and she said softly, "Right now, only Daoist Master Yuan Xiu remains in the Azure Pond Sect, and he has entered the Great Ning Palace. Meanwhile, Golden Feather Sect has four Daoist Masters, with two of them currently guarding their sect. If you were a demon cultivator moving south, where would you attack?"

"Of course, it would be the Azure Pond Sect..." replied Li Qinghong.
𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝒆𝓵.𝓬𝓸𝒎

At this point, Kong Tingyun no longer hid anything, treating Li Qinghong as one of her own, and spoke in a very gentle tone, "the Azure Pond Sect has seen its Purple Mansion Realm cultivators fall one after another, and its top experts are nowhere to be seen. It’s at its lowest point in five hundred years. Yuan Xiu has been trapped in Anhuai Heaven, with no way to receive word from him. Yet the core members of the Azure Pond Sect like Chi Zhiyan are still at Mount Bianyan!

"Now that the northern demons are out of control, do you think the other immortal sects have no means to influence them? Ever since the events at Anhuai Heaven, the entire situation has taken a sudden turn. At that very moment, they decided to go with the flow, and a new chessboard emerged—targeting Azure Pond!

"Isn’t this situation a perfectly timed, heaven-sent blade? The other immortal sects are taking advantage of the Azure Pond Sect’s weakness to cut out the roots of the demon sect! Even the remaining northern demon cultivators and high-level Buddhist cultivators are happy to watch this scene unfold and are deliberately staying hidden..."

Her voice grew heavy, her expression solemn, "Right now, the Azure Pond Sect faces a great calamity, and all the other sects are just watching from the sidelines! Little sister, I fear it’s not wise for you to return."
