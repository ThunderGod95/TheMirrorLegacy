# Chapter 798: Depart

Mount Yan Pass.

Li Qinghong had only been cultivating at the pass for a few months when an order from Azure Pond Sect arrived. It was then passed along within the pass until it reached Zhao Tinggui of Moon Lake Peak. The man rode the wind to the peak of the pass, bringing a group of people in tow.

Li Qinghong came out of her cave dwelling to greet him. The white-robed Zhao Tinggui gestured for the others to stay outside the main hall and entered alone.

His expression was calm, but Li Qinghong sensed his mood was low and softly said, “Daoist Friend Tinggui.”

“I wouldn’t dare... Senior is too courteous.”

All of Zhao Tinggui’s Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators at Mount Yan Pass were being transferred out. He had no idea how many would be lost at Chengshui Tomb, which placed immense pressure on him. On top of that, he had to explain the situation to the families and factions of these cultivators, which was an utterly messy affair.

How could he explain the inevitable casualties to everyone? They’d just end up transferring more Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and he would be the one making enemies. They wouldn’t dare hate Azure Pond Sect, so wouldn’t they then direct that hatred toward him?

He wasn’t the kind of person who liked making enemies, but he was being forced into this role. Naturally, he felt extremely irritated inside, yet he remained polite and said, “I received the sect’s order to transfer everyone. After reading it, I saw how urgent it was and rushed over at once.”

Li Qinghong acknowledged him, and Zhao Tinggui sighed, “One cannot shirk the sect’s orders. Please take care, senior. After all... we now share fortune and misfortune. My junior brother just fell in battle. I truly don’t want anything else to happen.”

Li Qinghong nodded and simply replied, “I’ll be heading north. I’ll trouble you to look after Yuexiang.”

She didn’t know who would be leading the northern expedition, nor how dangerous it might be. She had already prepared herself for the possibility of dying.

Worried about Li Yuexiang, she said a little more, and Zhao Tinggui replied with a serious expression, “Please be at ease, Senior. I have always treated her as one of my own peak’s disciples...”

When he saw the lingering worry on Li Qinghong’s face, Zhao Tinggui paused for a moment, then spoke solemnly, “My parents passed away early. Though I do not claim to be a good person, I’ve always regarded my peak’s disciples as my own siblings. Since I’ve promised your esteemed family, I will certainly keep my word.”

Li Qinghong let him speak. Still, the order had been marked as urgent, and there was no time to delay. She exited the cave dwelling, summoned Li Wushao and Kongheng, and broke through the sky toward Mount Bianyan.

In recent years, Kongheng had spoken less and less, seemingly growing increasingly immersed in silent cultivation. Li Wushao, as usual, wore a serious expression. It was only at this moment that Li Qinghong found a chance to speak with him in detail.

As they rode the wind, she softly said, “About that matter with the White Serpent Gu’er... Lanying feels deeply apologetic. After all, affection must go both ways...”

“My lord.” Li Wushao was momentarily startled before he understood, then rasped, “We serpents are not like humans. We don’t concern ourselves with mutual affection. If the scent cannot arouse desire, then it simply cannot. Even if emotions run deep, it’s all empty talk if the body doesn’t respond. There is no such thing as mutual affection for us, my lord, you overthink it.”

His words caught Li Qinghong by surprise, leaving her stunned for a second. Li Wushao continued calmly, “This was already common when I was in the Eastern Sea. The high-ranking Pristine Water white snakes had difficulty bearing offspring, so they took on hundreds of wives and concubines. The lower-ranking Valley Water gray snakes and Water Mansion black snakes served as their mates, producing offspring like grains of sand.

“It's not so bad with higher cultivation... but when one's cultivation is low, even if two snakes are in love, a single call from a white snake is enough to make them lose their minds and run off to be his consort.”

Li Wushao’s expression turned complicated, as if many words were lodged in his throat. He said quietly, “It seems there’s still discrimination by bloodline even after forming my Foundation Establishment... My father once said that our kind, the Hooked Serpents, would be better off dull and ignorant. But to possess human-like intelligence and yet be unable to resist our physical instincts, that is our greatest sorrow.”

Li Qinghong looked away as she listened, unsure how to comfort him. Li Wushao continued softly, “Even if there is mutual affection, once we return to our true forms and inhale each other’s scent, we feel instantly repulsed. Disgust wells up uncontrollably from the heart! Such is the nature of us demonic creatures.”

Kongheng, who had been silent, finally opened his eyes and said with a hint of heaviness, “It’s not just demons, humans, too, are not necessarily above such things.”

Kongheng’s words made Li Qinghong think of her family’s heir. She fell into silent reflection, and Li Wushao said no more.

This incident might have been a minor matter in the world of Hooked Serpents, but it had led Lingu Lanying to personally pay a visit, which had embarrassed Li Wushao. The chance to freely speak his thoughts now gave the old serpent much relief.

The group rode the wind and quickly descended into the mountains. Most of the cultivators had already arrived, and many familiar faces could be seen.

Li Qinghong looked up. A middle-aged man with black hair and golden robes stood at the highest position. His brows were sharp and fierce, and he exuded menace, as if he might transform into a tiger or leopard and pounce at any moment.

Golden light rippled across his body. He held a grand, ornate golden bow in his large, powerful hand. He stood alone atop the stone platform, with core disciples of the Immortal Sect bowing beside him and Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of all families paying their respects.

“Uncle...”

The sight brought Li Qinghong back to decades ago in an instant. Her father Li Xuanling had still been alive, and Li Xuanfeng was the family’s most gifted cultivator, newly ascended with high spirits.

She had gone up the mountain with her elder brother Li Yuanxiu, while her second brother Li Yuanjiao laughed and praised Li Xuanfeng’s godlike archery skills. Even before she had seen him, Li Qinghong had already looked forward to meeting him.

She lowered her eyes and silently thought, Uncle may have had another breakthrough.

Li Xuanfeng waited in the mountains for a moment, and the cultivators arrived as ordered. He glanced around and saw Li Qinghong and the others present as well. The white serpent was present, and the woman beside it was likely Lingu Lanying.

On the other side stood several cultivators from the Ning Family, two disciples from Moon Lake Peak, a few guest cultivators that the Azure Pond Sect had recalled from the Eastern and Southern Seas, and three representatives from the Golden Feather Sect. In total, there were sixteen Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Naturally, those in the Qi Cultivation Realm and Embryonic Breathing Realm had been drawn from the mountain’s own ranks. Their numbers were few, because they weren’t much use in battle. Moreover, the Azure Pond Sect refused to send out core sect disciples. After years of internal upheaval, it was difficult to mobilize many Qi or Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators at all.

“Midnight approaches. Everyone, let us depart,” Li Xuanfeng commanded, and his own family members responded immediately. The guest cultivators from Azure Pond Sect and the Golden Feather Sect, mostly seasoned veterans, were respectfully deferent and came over at his word.

He drew a jade vessel from his sleeve. It was the Ning Family’s Everflowing Jade Cloudliner that belonged to Ning Wan. He tossed it lightly into the air and it instantly expanded into a massive boat. Everyone boarded one after another.

Ning Heyuan, slightly slower to move, took to the skies with him. He threw out a piece of gauze from his sleeve, which shrouded everyone’s figures, and then smiled, “Well then, everyone. Why don’t we talk a bit?”

Li Xuanfeng had already been observing for a while. The guest cultivators the Azure Pond Sect had sent were all assimilated cultivators from the Eastern Sea. Their strength was mediocre, but at least they had experience dealing with devil cultivators and were skilled in survival techniques. Though they wouldn’t do much in a direct fight, they could still stall a few devil cultivators.

Only the three from the Golden Feather Sect were of real interest. One carried a talisman sword on his back and claimed to be Zhuang Cheng, a cultivator from the Smoke Valley Desert. Another was a man over two hundred years old, also from Smoke Valley, who called himself Lin Shouye.

The last one was an old Daoist who looked like he was only there to make up the numbers. He seemed to have only just entered the Foundation Establishment Realm, and had a visibly unsteady aura. He called himself Bai Yinzi of Smoke Valley and constantly wore a bitter expression.

The Golden Feather Sect differed from the Azure Pond Sect in several ways. It was looser in its control over techniques and Essence Gathering Pills, imposed less exploitation from above, and also had stricter checks on forced annexation. Many great families had continued for centuries under its rule, and they clearly had more cultivators in the Qi Cultivation Realm than the Azure Pond Sect.

Moreover, the families under the Azure Pond Sect still hadn’t recovered from the persecution and chaos under Chi Wei before his death. The former generation of prodigies had been wiped out, and the new generation was unwilling to be handed over to the Azure Pond Sect so easily. With such a shift in tides, even their Foundation Establishment Realm numbers now lagged far behind.

As for the rumor that most Dao lineages in Yue State stem from the six sons of Chongming Hall, making them more refined and highly competitive to the point where their elites often surpass those from Wu State... Who knows if it’s true or not. But judging by the two before us, their strength seems decent enough.

As Li Xuanfeng pondered, the others, including Li Qinghong, introduced themselves.

Suddenly, Bai Yinzi’s eyes lit up, and he leaned in close to Li Qinghong, lowering his voice, “Sirs and madams, this humble one is a cultivator from a small temple in Smoke Valley... Senior Donghe visited us back in the day! He even stayed there for quite a while...”

Li Qinghong immediately realized he was referring to the place where their family had collected the Golden Yang Radiant Origin. However, she had never seen this person before and couldn’t verify his claims, so she simply nodded politely and let it pass.

Bai Yinzi had no choice but to sit back down at her polite but noncommittal response and listen as the others in the boat began to chat.

The Golden Feather Sect cultivators were all experienced. In particular, Lin Shouye was a veteran of over two hundred years. He quickly struck up a conversation with several Eastern Sea cultivators. After some back-and-forth, they began to understand one another better.

After a brief moment, Ning Heyuan spoke in a deep voice, “Everyone, we’re heading to Chengshui Tomb this time to clash with the devil cultivators of the Murong Family. These aren’t your ordinary devil cultivators, so I urge you to stay vigilant.”

Although the direct descendents of the Murong Family would be handled by Li Xuanfeng and Tang Shedu, the other devil cultivators were not to be underestimated. Fearing the others might grow careless, Ning Heyuan added, “Are any of you familiar with Chengshui Tomb?”

None of the cultivators answered, until Lin Shouye’s eyes slowly rose to meet Ning Heyuan’s. He said hoarsely, “It is the royal tomb of the Ning State’s imperial lineage, and was once fortified by ancient formation arrays. Several centuries ago, Duke Xu of Xu State broke through the formation in alliance with local clans and looted all the spirit treasures within...

“It’s probably just a hollow shell now. But the spiritual energy inside remains rich, and since the local sects that once held it fled overseas, it’s become the perfect place to hold and trap the devil cultivators.”

Ning Heyuan nodded and said, “Senior, your insight is impressive.”

Lin Shouye gave a faint chuckle and replied, “I once trained there in my early years. There are rumors that a grotto heaven lies hidden within Ning State, and someone once entered it through Chengshui Tomb. However, I cannot say whether it’s true or not...”

Ning Heyuan was genuinely startled. What he thought was mere flattery now seemed to carry real weight. Still, he offered a noncommittal response, “Such rumors do exist...”

Lin Shouye stroked his beard and said no more. But Zhuang Cheng, the one with the talisman sword on his back, spoke in a deep, steady voice, “After all, Duke Xu died suddenly not long after breaking the formation. There must be strange evils lurking within Chengshui Tomb. If those devil cultivators exploit it, we’ll be lucky to suffer only minor losses. If the tide turns, the consequences could be far worse.”

Lin Shouye nodded approvingly and said, “Fellow Daoist Zhuang is absolutely right. Xu State’s immortal cultivation began its decline from that very point. It weakened by the day, until even the once-glorious Golden Tang Gate fell into decline. That eventually led to the southern push by the buddhist cultivators... and the intervention of True Monarch Shangyuan...”

At that time, Shangyuan was merely a Daoist Master, but he had now advanced to become a True Monarch, a figure spoken of like legend. Naturally, he could only be addressed as True Monarch now.

When Lin Shouye mentioned True Monarch Shangyuan, several people’s expressions turned complicated. As a member of the Golden Feather Sect, he himself wasn’t deeply moved, but many present had personally held off the buddhist cultivators and witnessed Shangyuan’s power firsthand. It stirred much emotion within them.

Lingu Lanying nodded lightly as she listened, the jade-green hairpin swaying behind her. She spoke gently, “The Murong Family’s belly-born heads are quite well known. Many of their techniques excel in fighting the many with the few, so you all must be careful.”

As they conversed, Li Qinghong remained silently observant. She soon noticed the mist outside the boat growing denser. Demonic energy was drifting about, and mountains were rising and falling in the distance. The thunder pool in her qi sea began to stir restlessly, clearly agitated by the surging aura of monsters and demons.

Chengshui Tomb...

Li Qinghong peered through the mist using her eye technique and vaguely saw ruins below. Several streaks of demonic light drifted within the clouds, moving back and forth as though searching for something.

She studied the terrain closely and realized she might have been here before. When she had once used a ritual altar to call thunder, she had visited many sites throughout Xu State to collect lightning, and this place seemed familiar.

This wasn’t called Chengshui Tomb in the altar’s records, but rather Anhuai Prefecture in Wei State... Looks like Ning State was founded after Wei fell and repurposed this site as a royal tomb... thought Li Qinghong.

Back then, there had been a few sects in the area that maintained a power balance and they treated her, merely a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator back then, politely. There must be several geomantic lines that made the area traversable, and quite a few cave dwellings as well.

These devil cultivators are likely holed up inside... This place is also close to Mount Tangdao, where the Golden Tang Gate resides...

The group gradually fell silent. Li Xuanfeng stood with his bow on his back as he gazed intently into the distance. The command token in his hand flickered with light, as though drawing something toward it.

Soon, the command token's light reached its peak and runes appeared one by one. Li Xuanfeng studied them carefully, calculated the distance, then took the bow from his back.

He spoke in a deep voice, “Tang Shedu and the others have arrived. Everyone, prepare yourselves.”

Sure enough, just as he finished speaking, a white light rose within the distant fog. A massive white human head floated into the sky, its enormous bluish-black eye sockets wide open, while two bloodshot red eyes peered out from within. Bloody tears dripped down its cheeks, and its pale fangs gleamed with a ghostly white light.

“How dare you?!”

The giant head immediately opened its mouth, its neat rows of teeth spreading like doors. Countless bluish-black dots of light gushed forth, swarming through the air and transforming into snakes, insects, ants, and scorpions. They fell like a monsoon rain, sprouting wings and dispersing in search of prey.

Li Qinghong had once seen Murong Xia, the reincarnation of a Maha. The belly-born head that the monk had released wasn’t this large. It had expelled the living souls of people that were capable of speaking, laughing, and even thanking Murong Xia...

Murong Xia was a Maha after all. His belly had been cultivated to the level of a blessed land. This Murong Family descendent, by contrast, is far inferior... One glance and it’s clear this is just a demonic technique...

Clarity dawned in Li Qinghong’s heart. Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng’s eyes narrowed. The ferocity of his expression was terrifying enough in his current middle-aged appearance that it drew glances from all around.

The middle-aged man slowly raised his golden bow. A golden arrow leaped from his waist and landed perfectly on the string. As the shimmering string drew taut, a piercing hum rang in everyone’s ears.

Whrrr...
