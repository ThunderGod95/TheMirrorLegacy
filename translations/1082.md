# Chapter 1082: The Sequence

The palace stretched deep, its walls concealing many secrets.

Brilliant light filled the hall. Kudzu flowers, scattered by the courtyard wind, piled up against the steps. A young man stood quietly at the palace gate, dressed in an imperial robe of deep purple-blue, intricately patterned with white-gold thread.

Behind him, a eunuch stood stiffly, carefully holding a golden birdcage. Amidst the swirling spiritual light, a small sparrow could be seen hopping restlessly within.

The bird was no bigger than a man's palm. It had two long, blue-white tail feathers, pitch-black claws, and crimson eyes. Its long, purple-blue beak was cocked to the side as it peered at the outside world with boundless curiosity.

The young man on the left, his golden eyes glinting, was Li Jiangliang. He glanced at the sparrow, then lowered his gaze, saying nothing.

This sparrow was a Spirit Beast of the True Qi Dao known as a "Tanzhen." It was said to be able to command water and fire and balance yin and yang. They had been extinct for many years. When Yang Zhuo ascended the throne, the Yang family scoured the world for treasures to present as tribute, and this bird was prized above all else!

Yang Zhuo himself was quite fond of the creature, always keeping it by his side to dote on.

In the courtyard before the palace, two cultivators were dueling with swords. The elder appeared to be in his early twenties, while the other was much younger, perhaps just past ten. Neither used their cultivation, relying purely on their swordsmanship. Yet, their supreme control over their blades was evident as they clashed with a sharp, ringing clang, light and shadow flowing around them.

Emperor Song, Yang Zhuo, watched with his arms crossed, a look of keen interest on his face. He turned his head slightly.

"Jiangliang... the Lingu family presented a treasured blade. While it's no Spiritual Artifact or Spiritual Treasure, it _is_ an antique from the previous dynasty, and of the True Qi Dao. Which of the princes do you think it suits?"

Li Jiangliang simply bowed his hands.

"The First Prince is refreshing and unconventional, with a refined appearance, and excels at discussing the profound. For him, to hold the sword is to hold oneself. The Second Prince is a peerless talent, bright as the full moon, with a clear and noble bearing. For him, to hold the sword is to hold its edge... It truly only depends on Your Majesty's expectations."

Yang Zhuo shook his head, smiling. He didn't look at Li Jiangliang, only at the duel.

"I saw the limits of their talent long ago. When it comes to heirs, I am inferior to King Wei."

Yang Zhuo had once roamed and cultivated in Simin. He had fathered many children, far more than most Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, but they were all scattered among the common folk. These two princes had only been found and brought back after he became emperor. The First Prince was named Hui, and the Second Prince was Jiong. Both were accomplished for their young age.

The First Prince, Yang Hui, was the eldest at twenty-eight and had recently reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. The Second Prince, Yang Jiong, was more talented. At just past twenty, he was already a cultivator at the ninth level of Qi Refining.

In the depths of the palace, there was also a third son, only three years old, who had been born after the ascension. Li Jiangliang had seen him. The child had been born treading on water and fire, a crimson dot between his brows. He was clearly extraordinary. Li Jiangliang understood what Yang Zhuo meant—these first two princes had simply been born too early.

Li Jiangliang considered this for a moment and bowed.

"Your Majesty..."

Yang Zhuo waved his hand, cutting him off.

"But if I truly must compare the two before me, I prefer the younger one. At least he shows some edge."

Li Jiangliang glanced at Yang Jiong, whose sword was flashing faster and faster. He was about to speak when a long, drawn-out announcement echoed from the palace hall, shattering his words.

"His Excellency, the County Governor of White River and General of the Southern Conquest, Li Jiangxia, requests an audience!"

Li Jiangliang froze, his expression flickering. Yang Zhuo, however, turned with a broad smile and clapped him affectionately on the shoulder.

"Your brother is here."

A general in black armor strode swiftly into the courtyard. He was powerfully built, with an imposing aura and the same blazing golden eyes. It was, indeed, Li Jiangxia.

After the general bowed at the foot of the steps, Yang Zhuo smilingly helped him up. "Congratulations!"

Li Jiangxia knew the emperor was referring to the recent birth of his son and daughter. He hurriedly bowed in thanks.

Yang Zhuo waved his hand again. A eunuch immediately stepped forward bearing a jade tray. 

"Today, as it happens, I have another joy to add to yours."

The jade tray was brought before Li Jiangxia. In its center rested a blue-gold token, inscribed with four characters: "Purple-Gold Profound Mystery."

Yang Zhuo declared, "I decree that General Li shall receive the Purple-Gold Profound Mystery and enter the Feng Wu Hall to command the troops. From this day, you are relieved of your temporary commissions abroad."

Li Jiangxia had always been highly valued. He had been temporarily granted a divine ability to lead the campaign in the south, then later to attack Shanji and contend with the Merciful One, earning considerable merit. Yang Zhuo was now using this as a justifiable reason to station him permanently in the Purple and Gold Palace!

While Li Jiangxia's capabilities were outstanding, this was, in large part, Yang Zhuo's favoritism. If Li Jianglong had been the one temporarily wielding the Profound Mystery back then, his achievements might not have been any less. Ultimately, it was just a convenient excuse to promote someone he favored.

However, receiving the Purple-Gold Profound Mystery was not the same as being a true Holder of the Profound. He had merely been promoted from a temporary wielder to a temporary receiver. The real benefit was that he no longer needed to be commanding troops on the frontier to receive the blessing of the divine ability. Like Li Jiangliang, it would now be with him at all times—a massive boon for his cultivation! The only thing separating him from a true Holder of the Profound was the title itself.

Li Jiangxia valued nothing more than the cultivation of his divine ability. How could he not be ecstatic? He bowed deeply.

"I will surely pacify all troubles for my Emperor and bring peace to our Song nation!"

Yang Zhuo gave a faint smile and bade him rise.

"A message came from Jinghai this morning," he said softly. "Daoist Master Zhaojing asked about the situation in the Southern Borderlands. Jiangliang and I have discussed it, and we plan to support the Demon beasts there to maintain the balance."

"Why don't you take the 'Profound Water Stone of the Far Ridges' and make a trip? While you're at it, you can reorganize those Shaman Kingdoms you conquered."

"As for White River..."

Yang Zhuo's voice was light.

"Do you have anyone to recommend?"

Both brothers' hearts clenched.

White River was no ordinary post. It was situated between Tangdao Mountain and Moongaze Lake. It was obvious they couldn't just send a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to guard it. Whoever was sent would first receive a divine ability from the Purple and Gold Palace! This was a tremendous opportunity.

Li Jiangliang sank into deep thought.

'How many Holders of the Profound does the Great Song currently have?'

'The most prominent are the two Military Commissioners at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm, Situ Huo and Liu Bai. They hold divine abilities and possess the power to truly stabilize a region. They certainly can't be moved.'

'The rest are my brother, Li Jiangxia, and myself... That's already four! Jiangxia might not grasp the gravity of this, but I've been by the Emperor's side and know many secrets. There are only two or three positions left in the Purple and Gold Palace!'

The best candidate in Li Jiangliang's mind was his own second brother, but the topic was far too sensitive. He lowered his eyes.

"The Sima Family has a promising talent named Sima Xunhui. He is already at the late-Foundation Establishment Realm, skilled in planning, and a first-rate talent..."

"Sima Xunhui."

Yang Zhuo chuckled softly.

"He has no merits and no faults. How could I justify such an appointment? The Great General strongly recommended your second brother, Li Jianglong, yet I don't hear you mentioning him!"

Li Jiangliang flushed with embarrassment.

"I was only trying to avoid suspicion!"

Yang Zhuo shook his head, still smiling, and clasped his hands behind his back.

"Isn't Sima Xunhui also a son-in-law of Ting Province? Ning Wan recommended someone named Li Yuanqin, who I hear is also from a direct bloodline in Ting Province. Tinglan was even more amusing, pointing to a junior of your own Li family. If we were truly avoiding suspicion, where would it end? Don't overthink it. You are dismissed."

Mortified, Li Jiangliang gave his assent and retreated alongside his brother, leaving the emperor standing alone, hands clasped behind his back. The bird in the cage chirped, its song clear and melodious.

Yang Zhuo took a step. A gust of wind blew kudzu petals onto his boot. He looked at the flowers piled on the steps and remarked,

"How vigorously they grow!"

Once the two brothers were out of the main hall, Li Jiangxia's handsome face was wreathed in smiles.

"The Feng Wu Hall... it suits me well."

The high officials of the Great Song were split into three branches: the martial branch, Feng Wu; the civil branch, Fengzhen; and, presiding over them all, the Purple and Gold Palace. However, the Song Emperor did not strictly separate civil and military, and concurrent appointments were common.

Li Jiangliang, however, seemed lost in thought. He snapped back to himself and offered a congratulations.

"This is perfect. I'll go back with you, brother, and meet those two wonderful children!"

"Of course!"

---

Moongaze Lake.

The mountain forest trembled. A hollow rumbling echoed from a cave, mixed with the sharp rustle of wind.

Fine sand in front of the cave-dwelling danced and leapt with the wind. The stone door vibrated violently as dazzling silver light poured from its seams, flowing like a river down the mountainside.

_BOOM!_

The stone door, which had not moved in years, suddenly burst open. A surging wave of silver light blasted outward, causing the sky to darken and thunder to roll. The clouds scattered, revealing flashing stars, and the surrounding trees toppled as the ground was bathed in starlight!

A young man emerged from the cave-dwelling. His features were cold and stern, his bearing extraordinary. His eyes glittered with an intense silver light, giving him a somewhat cruel appearance. Yet, a trace of joy between his brows, like a spring wind melting ice, softened much of that coldness.

It was Li Suining!

"Immortal Foundation, achieved!"

He had spent a year in secluded meditation on the mountain, adjusting his breath and condensing his True Essence to achieve the Immortal Foundation of the Great Void Revolution Art. He had calculated the sequence, prepared to shift the times, and claimed his divine duty: the Divine Sequence!

But his face held more than just joy; it held the profound peace of having survived a great calamity. A film of cold sweat even glistened on his brow.

The difficulty of this path had far exceeded his imagination!

It wasn't as if he, Li Suining, had never cultivated or established a foundation before. The Sacred Scroll of the Star Court he practiced in his past life was also a fifth-grade art. But the difficulty of this seemingly less-noble art was far, far greater!

This was because the Great Void Revolution Art had condensed an extra "Void Core" in his sea of qi. The art mentioned that this core could be dissolved during Foundation Establishment to aid the process. A true genius, however, would turn this core from illusory to real, vastly increasing their power after reaching the new realm.

Having been reborn, and with resources far exceeding his previous life, Li Suining had already endured decades to reach Foundation Establishment. How could he possibly settle for second best? He had gritted his teeth and forced his way through. But the process had tormented him. If not for his past life's experience and the Essence Gathering Pills, he might very well have perished.

'I finally, finally made it through!'

'The Divine Sequence. Its primary marvel is "calculating the sequence," which is precisely a calculation art!'

'It's not that our family lacks calculation arts. The ability of Daoist Master Li Que'wan, the Whole Pill, to transform calculations rivals even Qiushui's.'

'But unlike the calculation arts of the Whole Pill or the Shaman Dao, the marvel of the Divine Sequence relies heavily on celestial phenomena.'

'Unfortunately, in the current era, the stars are in disarray and the heavens are abnormal. The power of this marvel is greatly weakened, making calculations extremely troublesome.'

'Only a few minor marvels for controlling lightning remain. The one unique aspect is self-preservation: "If the life-mandate is defied, the Divine Sequence will know."'

'The Untraceable Presence can block calculation arts, shielding one from divination. The Divine Sequence has a similar effect. Divine abilities like Serene Listen will find it very difficult to hear my inner thoughts, and I will sense their attempt...'

'...However, the Daoist Master on the other end will likewise sense that their divine ability has failed and realize something is amiss.'

'But, according to the scroll, the Divine Sequence cannot hide from Life Divine Ability-class powers, like Bright Yang or Sheji.'

As for "shifting the times," Li Suining found this far more useful. When cultivating the Divine Sequence, the more cultivators one's actions influenced, and the vaster their divine abilities, the more "radiance" would be added to his Divine Sequence.

'The Divine Sequence only gains the marvel of _actively_ shifting the times at the Purple Mansion Realm. But for a Foundation Establishment cultivator, a "hidden dragon in the abyss," this added radiance is not to be underestimated... This radiance can be used for calculations!'

The final marvel, the 'concurrent divine duty,' was something Li Suining understood poorly. It mentioned 'attaching to a Grotto-Heaven or Blessed Land' and 'entrusting one's life-mandate...'

The art also mentioned that the Divine Sequence was closely related to the Radiant Qi Dao. It had once been complementary to the Spirit-Crown Tassel of the Radiant Qi Dao.

It said that cultivators of the Heaven-Governing Dao could use the Spirit-Crown Tassel to supplement this Divine Sequence... It all left Li Suining in a half-comprehending daze.

'The Radiant Qi Dao is said to be controlled by Buddhist cultivators. Who knows... maybe my Divine Sequence is also prime material for converting to Buddhism!'

He gave a sarcastic laugh.

It seemed the Heaven-Governing Dao had truly lost its luster over the long years. Not only were its main functions incomplete, but it also lacked all the minor, practical applications like using Li Fire to consume wood-elemental medicine or using Pit Water to control water and repel Demon beasts.

The only thing worth mentioning was the "Qi Core" that he had used all his strength to preserve within his Dantian.

This Qi Core had already condensed during his Qi Refining days. As he broke through to Foundation Establishment, it had transformed from illusory to real, and was now named the 'Heaven-Governing Thunder Mansion.'

According to the Great Void Revolution Art, the Heaven-Governing Thunder Mansion could store qi and accumulate lightning. More importantly, it served as a 'False Mansion' used to attach to a Grotto-Heaven or Blessed Land for cultivation.

He studied it for a while, a deep puzzle forming in his mind.

'The Heaven-Governing Thunder Mansion is the core of the Great Void Revolution Art. So why, when it comes to the critical details, does the immortal art say nothing at all? It took me a tremendous effort to accommodate this Qi Core during my breakthrough. Was it really just to store an extra ten or twenty percent of True Essence and lightning? What a joke!'

An extra ten or twenty percent of True Essence and a place to store lightning was certainly not weak. But Li Suining was a direct descendant of the Moongaze Immortal Clan. How could he care about such trivial scraps? To put it bluntly, if he asked Li Jiangzong to refine a dharma artifact for him, it could also store that much True Essence and lightning, and probably do it better!

He reviewed the art again and again, his suspicion growing.

'How strange. Is the Great Void Revolution Art truly a _complete_ immortal art? Why is the description of the immortal foundation so obscure? It feels as though... the key principles have been concealed.'

What he had obtained from Liu Changdie back then was indeed titled the Great Void Revolution Art. But what had ended up in his hands was, in fact, the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment chapters of the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence! Of course it was profound and abstruse. The numerous secret arts had all been redacted and sealed away—all of them in the hands of Li Ximing!

Although Li Suining had felt the art was cohesive and complete back then, now that he had successfully cultivated its foundation, he could finally sense that something was wrong.

He could only assume it was a limitation of the art itself. He sighed, overcome with emotion.

"The Heaven-Governing Dao... so renowned in antiquity! If I could one day complete its Dao Lineage, what infinite power and boundless marvels would it hold!"

Li Suining sighed inwardly. He finally stepped out of his seclusion and reached the entrance. An old man was waiting for him, dressed in plain clothes and holding a lamp. He was sitting on the steps, sighing and tracing the patterns on the stone with his hand.

"Old Du!"

The old servant assigned to him immediately leapt to his feet, his vision blurring with tears. He stammered, "The Heavens be praised!"

Tears streamed down his face.

"I... I thought so much time had passed... that something had happened to Young Master... This is wonderful. This is truly wonderful..."

Since Du Dou had been assigned to Li Suining, his status had risen like a boat on a high tide. Not only did no one dare show him disrespect, but his own cultivation resources had multiplied several times over, and even his children and grandchildren had benefited... These tears were not just for Li Suining's success; they were also filled with his own profound relief.

"The art had a few bottlenecks, so it took some time," Li Suining said, comforting him with a smile.

"Come! Let's go report the good news to the Old Master!"

But Du Dou suddenly stopped him, wiping the tears from his face.

"Young Master, wait!" he urged, his voice tense.

"Hm?"

Li Suining's brow furrowed as he saw Du Dou's nervous expression.

"Young Master Ning, you don't know! The war between the north and south has grown fierce! A while ago, a great monk came, called... called Vast Cicada! He fought until the sky and earth turned dark. It took several Daoist Masters just to hold him off... and he still came and went as he pleased!"

Li Suining frowned.

"Vast Cicada!"

The old man nodded frantically.

"The Daoist Master has already been transferred to the south! The lake is undefended right now... The other masters gave strict orders. All direct descendants are to remain in the mountains cultivating. No one is allowed to leave... Even Lord Jiangchun has entered the inner formation!"

Li Suining's expression changed. He clasped his hands behind his back, turned, and paced a few steps before the cave. He stopped at the edge of the steps, his voice sharp.

"Is that true?!"
