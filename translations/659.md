# Chapter 659: Meeting Heyun in the Abyss

Li Zhouwei calculated the days in his mind before stepping out from the main hall. As he walked through the corridors, An Siwei was already waiting in the side chamber, bowing respectfully.

"Your Highness, will you be visiting Madam Chen today..."

"With Kongheng protecting her, there's no need for daily visits. Let's see the eldest young master instead!"

Madam Chen had been with child for some time now, and Li Zhouwei had been visiting her more frequently. However, calculating the days, he realized it had been quite a while since he'd seen Li Jiangqian. The boy was already six years old—nearly time to begin his cultivation training.

"The eldest young master is still on the island, Your Highness, please..."

Li Zhouwei raised his head slightly and asked in a gentle tone, "What's he doing on the island?"

"The various branches throughout the island have gradually settled down. The eldest young master said he wanted to see the clan members before coming to pay his respects to Your Highness."

Li Zhouwei nodded and stepped outside. As they reached the great hall's entrance, he spotted a bustling crowd surrounding the child as they approached. Servants trailed behind carrying book boxes and large umbrellas, busy and flustered. Li Zhouwei turned back with a chuckle.

"Those junior members certainly follow him around every day."

This laughing remark sent chills down An Siwei's spine. He quickly whispered, "Your Highness, the young master is from the maternal An clan after all. The entire An family takes great pride in this honor. When the young master comes to the island for leisure, it's only natural that several people would attend to him..."

"Mm."

Li Zhouwei bent down and lifted the approaching Li Jiangqian into his arms. The crowd that had been chasing behind immediately fell to their knees in a mass. The child turned around in his embrace, and Li Zhouwei asked, "Qian'er, how was the island?"

Li Jiangqian looked up, his face still carrying traces of lingering joy as he replied cheerfully, "What a bunch of people, father! You took me to see the shores, but it's really no different from the island proper. Once you step out of this great hall, everything looks the same."

Li Zhouwei carried him toward the hall while An Siwei and the others remained waiting outside. Father and son walked into the sunlit main chamber, and the child continued, "Father speaks of close relatives, but I don't see how close they really are. They're all just common people, all wearing the same expressions. As for the cultivators... we've built the framework, and they hang from it."

Li Zhouwei glanced at him sideways and said softly, "That's order. Though people have emotions, they're also driven by profit. This framework that distributes benefits—that's order, whether large or small, good or bad."

Li Jiangqian lowered his head in thought for a moment, then suddenly looked up. "Qian'er doesn't understand. How can there be good and bad distinctions?"

Li Zhouwei smiled, a hint of appreciation rising in his eyes as he spoke gently, "For our Li family, if this framework benefits the common people, then it's good. The other clans also take this as their standard, maintaining the strictest control—this is where our family's laws and principles reside. Some noble families think our punishment and oppression of direct-line commoners, minor branches, and collateral members with different surnames is too harsh. That's because their order exists to serve the cultivators."

Li Jiangqian stared at him blankly, words reaching his lips only to be swallowed back down. His intuition told him he shouldn't ask, so he could only murmur inwardly, 'But what use is being good to them... common people are useless anyway...'

He averted his gaze, listening as Li Zhouwei continued softly, "This framework uses profit as its skeleton, bound and adorned with kinship and favor—only then can it remain stable and unbroken."

Li Jiangqian nodded as he listened. After chatting for a while longer, Li Zhouwei waved for someone to take the boy away. He sat alone on the steps as the sun moved westward, its rays falling across his dark red robes.

The fine golden embroidered patterns caught the light and gleamed. Li Zhouwei finally withdrew his gaze, paced a couple of steps, and Chen Yang hurried up from outside the hall. Li Zhouwei asked, "Still no news from the mountains?"

Chen Yang looked somewhat disheveled as he replied quietly, "No news..."

Li Zhouwei's voice grew heavy. "Even if we can't find the fox clan, that deer demon Lu Ken in the demon cave should have some information... Are you telling me you can't even find that deer demon?"

Chen Yang clasped his fists respectfully. "Your Highness, the demon cave in the southern foothills of Mount Dali is tightly sealed, and we haven't seen any lesser demons coming or going. Elder White Ape captured some passing demons to question them, but several didn't know anything. Only recently did we hear that Lu Ken has gone out."

Li Zhouwei frowned and turned around, thinking to himself, 'Whether he's truly gone out or just pretending—perhaps Dingjiao's matter is too difficult to handle... He knew in advance and refuses to meet.'

This situation was becoming quite troublesome. Although Dingjiao had shown considerable sincerity, Li Zhouwei had responded cautiously, saying only that he would help pass along the message. But now they couldn't even catch sight of a demon's shadow...

After pondering for a moment, he replied, "Continue investigating."

Chen Yang acknowledged and withdrew. Li Zhouwei made his calculations, 'If there's no news for the next few years, then most likely Lu Ken refuses to meet. I'll just have to tell the truth. After all, our family made no advance promises, so we shouldn't offend the dragon clan.'

Li Zhouwei put away the several reward items from the jade box. Looking at the five Essence Gathering Pills, they were indeed all dull and gray—he couldn't tell whether they were made from humans or demon beasts. He organized everything properly and sent it to Mount Wu for his seventh great-uncle Li Ximing to examine.

'It seems seventh great-uncle still has two Essence Gathering Pills that the Ning family gave him. We can use those first.'

According to Li Ximing, those two were almost certainly refined by the Xiao family, both filled with pure spiritual energy. Li Zhouwei dispatched An Siwei to make a trip to Mount Wu to inquire, while he pondered the situation.

Quite a few people in his family could use these items.

His father Li Chengliao and younger uncle Li Chenghuai both had cultivation levels ready for secluded cultivation at any time. Those with slightly lower cultivation included his aunt Li Minggong in the great desert, An Siwei just now, and Li Wen who stood guard outside the hall with his golden hammer...

Though their cultivation was described as "slightly lower," after taking a talisman pill, they too would have sufficient cultivation to attempt Foundation Establishment. Li Zhouwei only had two usable pills in his possession.

He calculated quietly, 'Father and younger uncle definitely need one reserved.'

Li Zhouwei planned to give at least one Essence Gathering Pill to someone outside the family. After careful consideration, he thought, 'Essence Gathering Pills are spiritual medicines that assist with Foundation Establishment—extremely attractive... Being able to give out Essence Gathering Pills versus not being able to is completely different treatment... As long as one is given out... the rest will eagerly await their turn!'

Since Li Zhouwei knew that the Xiao family could also refine Essence Gathering Pills now, rather than them being monopolized by the Azure Pond Sect alone, he felt more relaxed. Even if those five Essence Gathering Pills had problems, the losses wouldn't be too great—at worst, he could compensate with other items and trade with the Xiao family.

After waiting like this for a while, An Siwei approached from outside the hall, carrying a jade box and speaking respectfully, "Your Highness, the items have been delivered. Master Ximing wasn't in deep seclusion, and these two spiritual pills have been retrieved."

Li Zhouwei casually put them away, dismissed An Siwei first, calculated the days, and decided to distribute these items when the time came for sacrificial ceremonies. He then began reading technique manuals in the hall. As light and shadow alternated several times, Li Wen from outside the hall approached with some urgency, calling out in a rough voice, "Your Highness! The Shen clan from north of the river has come calling!"

...

**Eastern Sea.**

The Earth Abyss stretched in gray-black darkness, with points of rainbow light shuttling through it. Li Xizhi rode the rainbow light through the surging Radiant Essence and evil qi until he stopped before a stone wall.

He transformed into rainbow light and slipped through a crack in the wall, shuttling through the deep darkness for a while before stopping in a somewhat cold cavern.

*Drip.*

The clear, cold sound of water echoed as something massive and black coiled at the cavern's ceiling. Pure black pupils opened as a hissing serpent's voice emerged.

"Young Master."

Li Xizhi nodded slightly, the jade bottle in his hand flashing with brilliant light. He chuckled and said warmly, "Quite good luck. I searched through the earth veins for a while and discovered a stream of **Deep Sea Radiant Essence**. Though this substance has been extinct for many years and its uses have gradually been lost to time, it's still a rare treasure."

"Congratulations, Young Master."

The black and red qi within the jade bottle moved like water, gently rippling. Li Xizhi was obviously quite satisfied as he flipped his hand to put it away. Li Wushao spoke in his hoarse voice, "News has come from the Si family. Please have a look, Young Master."

Li Xizhi had arrived at this place just as the earth veins shifted. Radiant Essence and Lesser Yang light drifted about, impacting the spiritual qi within his body and intertwining with the immortal foundation in his qihua acupoint—an extremely dangerous environment.

Fortunately, the talisman he'd received was **Rainbow Pierce Skyway**. When this dense and overbearing Radiant Essence and Lesser Yang light impacted his body, it was quickly and easily dissolved, allowing him to get by reasonably well in these earth veins.

But while he could endure it, Li Wushao was suffering terribly from the burning, his entire body sizzling and smoking. Li Xizhi had no choice but to protect the old demon, following the earth veins until he found a relatively safe cave where he first settled Li Wushao.

Upon arriving here and checking the Golden Feather Sect's maps, he discovered a water vein nearby that connected directly to the Eastern Sea above. Li Xizhi's mind turned, and he understood much immediately.

So he settled the old demon here to carefully guard this water vein while he went out to collect spiritual materials. Now that he'd returned, he'd indeed received news from the Si family as expected.

Li Wushao's voice was low but carried considerable admiration as he spoke, "After Master went out for several days, a spiritual talisman came flowing down this water vein, rushing straight toward the cave dwelling. I intercepted it."

Li Xizhi took the spiritual talisman from his hands and sighed, "Daoist Master Yuanxiu truly hasn't entered seclusion—this is wonderful!"

No matter what, Li Wushao was still a century-old demon. How could he not hear the change in tone? This scared him out of his wits, and he was secretly horrified, 'Yes... to be able to calculate that we're here, it must be Si Boxiu's handiwork. This spiritual talisman's origins are unclear—I mustn't speak carelessly!'

He immediately understood and fell silent. Li Xizhi took the spiritual talisman and indeed found it contained much information, written in Si Tongyi's tone. After reading through it generally, he began to think.

'The Si family retreats steadily... it seems they're no longer a significant force... With me missing and Southern Sea demonic cultivators in chaos, the Lingu Family can barely take care of themselves... The situation is truly excellent for them...'

'Chi Fubo is still cautious, still unwilling to act rashly, replacing his trusted subordinates bit by bit... But Ning Hejing can't hold back anymore...'

The letter mentioned that Ning Hejing had frequently left the Eastern Sea in recent months, privately moving in and out of the sect, having long conversations with Chi Xunxiao's trusted followers.

'I wonder if Chi Fubo knows—it's like placing a sword at Chi Fubo's throat...'

Besides these two pieces of news, there was also information about Li Quantao going to the Li family. Li Xizhi didn't mind this: 'Quantao has no cunning—he won't harm my family. At most he'll be used by others. My family's heir has already achieved Foundation Establishment Realm. The only ones in the Azure Pond who could scheme against him are Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Though Chi Fubo has some schemes, he's isolated and can't accomplish great things.'

Another piece of news made Li Xizhi furrow his brow: 'Uncle Yuanqin... left the sect once and met with someone unknown.'

For Si Yuanli to obtain such timely information about these matters, his control over the Azure Pond probably hadn't truly weakened much. Li Xizhi wasn't worried about this—his only concern was for this uncle Li Yuanqin.

'I just hope he won't be accidentally harmed...'

After searching through the spiritual talisman several more times and finding no other functions, Li Xizhi crushed it—this served as a response to Si Tongyi on the other end. He asked gently, "How are your injuries?"

"Still manageable..."

Though Li Wushao had a foul mouth and often cursed, serpents were actually extremely patient by nature. The impact of two types of evil qi and Lesser Yang light within his body wasn't something that could be easily endured.

Li Wushao only said in a hoarse voice, "Though painful, it's much lighter than Merging Fire and Converging Water injuries. Our clan is often tormented by dragons, and Converging Water injuries are commonplace."

Li Xizhi's talisman qi only worked on himself and was helpless against the injuries within Wushao's body. After giving him medicine, he said gently, "Ning Hejing is overbearing—I don't dare leave you behind. Fortunately, there's no Radiant Essence here, so rest well."

"Young Master should go as you please and needn't mind me. When the earth veins shift and the two qi and one light gush forth, it's also when treasures are most abundant. Since Young Master isn't afraid, don't waste this opportunity."

The old snake lowered his head and stopped responding. Li Xizhi had no choice but to transform into rainbow light and fly from the cave. He casually sealed the cave entrance and plunged back into the intense Radiant Essence, heading eastward.

After traveling over a hundred li, Li Xizhi suddenly frowned. Colorful light flashed between his pupils as his gaze penetrated the dense Lesser Yang light, and he suddenly spotted something.

In a patch of Lesser Yang light, evil qi rolled and churned. Lying in the earth vein was a feathered beast, large as a table—a beautifully formed, brilliantly colored fish with wings extending from beneath its ribs. It had a large round head, a flat fish snout, and orange feathers on both wings that kept flapping as if struggling.

Li Xizhi cautiously stopped, slightly frowning as he thought, 'A Dawn Rayfish? That’s one enormous Dawn Rayfish!'

Li Xizhi wasn't unfamiliar with Dawn Rayfishes—he'd seen one before, but they were only palm-sized. He'd never heard of one as large as a table. Seeing this Dawn Rayfish lying motionless on the ground, he became alert and observed carefully.

As time passed and noon arrived, the Lesser Yang light weakened, with some even transforming into sunlight within the intense spiritual energy. Li Xizhi felt a chill by his ear as a faint, calm, and elegant voice arose:

"What is Fellow Daoist Xizhi waiting for?"

Such a sentence suddenly emerging in the utterly silent earth vein, spoken in such a calm tone, was enough to frighten an ordinary cultivator's soul from their body—especially when two qi and one light were currently rampaging about, and even Foundation Establishment cultivators wouldn't linger here long.

'Purple Mansion?!'

Li Xizhi was greatly alarmed. The radiant light on his body instantly rippled outward, and several phantom figures scattered from his body, fleeing in different directions. Orange-red coloration flew up from these figures.

**Gold in Cloud**!

The orange-red light points Li Xizhi had transformed into leaped through the air several times before materializing. He swept out a sleeve of rainbow light, turned to draw his long sword, and indeed found someone already standing behind him!

"Oh?"

This person seemed surprised by his casting speed and appeared quite astonished, yet didn't move at all, standing with hands behind his back. When Li Xizhi saw who it was, he immediately relaxed and smiled wryly, sheathing his sword and politely cupping his hands in respectful greeting.

"Greetings, Senior Heyun!"

The person before him had bright, piercing eyes, elegant and natural bearing, with hair bound neat and tidy, sleeves and collar perfectly pressed, even the hems on both sides symmetrically aligned. This was none other than Dongfang Heyun!

Dongfang Heyun nodded politely, performing a standard return bow that would put cultivators from south of the river to shame, and smiled. "We haven't met in years—Fellow Daoist has truly advanced greatly in strength!"
