# Chapter 372: Generation After Generation

"Whoa!"

As soon as Wang Xun spoke, the two brothers were stunned, secretly amazed. After all, Wang Xun was an immortal descendant of a Golden Core Realm cultivator, and his understanding of spirit roots was on a completely different level compared to the Li Family's.

The Li Family's Snake Dragon Tree was merely between the Embryonic Breathing Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm, while Wang Xun immediately offered a Foundation Establishment Realm item, leaving the brothers speechless.

Wang Xun, seemingly unaware of their amazement, continued to explain nonchalantly, "This Wanglin Blossom has the effect of alleviating worries and sustaining life, and its flowers bloom like red jade. Normally, consuming them can calm the mind, eliminate distracting thoughts, and enhance cultivation... In life-and-death situations, chewing and swallowing the flowers can sustain the body and prolong life. From our family's experience, this can sustain a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator for several days. The more consumed, the less effective it becomes. However, if the quantity is sufficient, it can sustain someone for up to half a month without any issues."

Upon hearing this, Li Yuanjiao was immediately tempted. He stared at the red-yellow almond-sized seed, his thoughts racing, Our Mount Huaqian has a spirit spring... I wonder if it can support this spirit root. The flowers can be consumed for cultivation, given as gifts, or sold to wealthy clans!

Although sustaining life for a few days seemed insignificant for a small clan like the Li Family, it was quite valuable for a large clan. Combined with certain pills and talismans, it could enable a heavily injured Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to make it home.

For large clans like the Xiao Family, who possessed numerous elixirs, the chances of survival were significantly higher as long as there was still a breath left.

Seeing the two brothers deep in thought, Wang Xun smiled gently.

"As for the Essence Gathering Pill, our Wang Family has those, as well as better pills. However, such items are of no use to me, so I did not bring them. I only have a few bottles of Essence Gathering Pills for rewards."

After saying this, he took out a jade bottle from his storage pouch and flicked his finger. A pill flew out, snow-white and crystal clear, emitting a pleasant fragrance. Wang Xun smiled and said, "This Essence Gathering Pill is of high quality, certainly not inferior! You may inspect it, but merely exchanging your sword intent for these pills might seem like I am bullying you with my status."

The Essence Gathering Pill, when taken for the first time, could greatly enhance the probability of achieving Foundation Establishment Realm and was an excellent cultivation pill. It was not particularly rare, and the materials required for its production were not exceedingly expensive. However, the recipe and materials were monopolized by the three sects and seven gates, only used as rewards for disciples, making it quite rare in the Yue State.

In Wang Xun's eyes, these were merely common supplementary pills and not particularly valuable, hence he felt it was an inappropriate offer.

Li Yuanping carefully inspected it, finding the fragrance delightful. Li Yuanjiao, upon seeing the pill, was startled, his eyes widening in shock. His back was cold, and he exclaimed, "This is an Essence Gathering Pill?!"

The Li Family had seen Essence Gathering Pills before. Li Tongya had taken them in the past, and there were mentions of them in the family records. Li Yuanping, not being well-versed in cultivation, was unaware, but Li Yuanjiao had memorized the records.

The Essence Gathering Pill the Li Family had obtained was white with gray patterns and coiled in shape, causing dizziness with a single whiff. Yet, the pill before them was bright, smooth, and delicate like a jade bead, filling the room with a nice fragrance; completely different from what they had seen before.

Greatly shocked and speechless, Li Yuanjiao's mind was filled with a terrifying question.

If this is an Essence Gathering Pill... what did our ancestor take back then..?

Wang Xun, noticing Li Yuanjiao's reaction, thoughtfully glanced at him and swirled the small cup on the table.

"The Essence Gathering Pill, named for its ability to consolidate one's essence and remove impurities, uses the Azure Amber Spirit Grass as the main ingredient, combined with twelve supplementary herbs, refined with three specific types of flames..."

Wang Xun appeared knowledgeable about medicinal herbs and pill formulas, calmly explaining as he noticed Li Yuanjiao's reaction.

Li Yuanjiao, feeling a chill down his spine, asked in a low voice, "Senior, if the pill has gray patterns, is coiled in shape, and its spiritual qi is intense with effects similar to the Essence Gathering Pill... Can you identify what kind of pill that might be?"

"Gray patterns?"

Wang Xun pondered for a moment, his expression turning cold, and replied in a low voice, "In Jiangnan, there are many different Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace techniques that incorporate human blood qi into pills. When mortal and spiritual energy combine, they can form certain patterns... Those are pills made from other human's essence and qi. Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace techniques produce pills that are far superior in both quantity and quality compared to ordinary pills. If the streaks are gray, it means that some kind of immortal foundation might have been used. These pills are often taken by the core members of devil sects. Consuming it significantly boosts cultivation and has astonishing effects."

Although Wang Xun's voice was not loud, it exploded like a thunderclap. Li Yuanjiao staggered a step backward, looking at the person in front of him in disbelief. He almost couldn't breathe but managed to squeeze a reply out of himself.

"Thank you, Senior... We will choose the spirit root!"

While responding, his mind finally cleared up and many of his doubts were resolved, though such realization filled him with increasing dread.

Granduncle once said he thought his talent was mediocre and that achieving Foundation Establishment Realm would be a life-or-death struggle... He hadn't expected it to happen so smoothly! So it was... it was... because of the pills?!

That's why it was so easy for him to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm back then! Of course, in order to make my granduncle a bait for Maha, he must succeed in his breakthrough... If he failed and perished, the Maha would simply find another target and the bait would be lost...

Wang Xun continued to chat with Li Yuanping while taking out a jade box, placing the spirit root inside, and handing it to him.

"I will cultivate in this side courtyard for a few days. The Family Head can stay nearby, so he won't have to worry about me running away with the sword..." he reassured softly.

Li Yuanjiao listened to their polite conversation in a daze and unknowingly walked out of the side courtyard, still in a trance. Wang Xun's words kept echoing in his mind.

In Jiangnan, there are many different Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace techniques that incorporate human blood qi into pills. When mortal and spiritual energy combine, they can form certain patterns... Those are pills made from other human's essence and qi...

Wang Xun's words were vague, but his eyes and hints were extremely clear. "Pills made from human's essence and qi" clearly meant Human Pills... made from the blood qi and essence qi collected from annual slaughters!

He walked in a daze to the main hall, where Li Yuanping, looking worried, called out repeatedly. Li Yuanjiao seemed to wake from a dream and hurriedly took off his storage pouch from his waist.

With a grave expression, Li Yuanjiao gently patted the storage pouch, pouring out several jade bottles that clattered onto the table. He picked up one and poured its contents into his palm.

This pill was the most common Jade Sprout Pill, mostly distributed from the Yundan Peak of the Azure Pond Sect. The Azure Pond Sect's pills were of particularly high quality, favored by rogue cultivators, making them easily recognizable.

The Jade Sprout Pill was a pale yellow color, with nothing special visible on the surface. Li Yuanjiao scanned it repeatedly with his spiritual sense and finally found faint, curly patterns.

The alchemist's skill was exquisite, making these patterns almost imperceptible. They were colorless, blending seamlessly with the pill.

Li Yuanjiao's eyes reddened, and he quickly poured out all the pills from his storage pouch, searching frantically. Finally, he found the Snake Essence Pill made by Xiao Yuansi for the Li Family last year and hurriedly poured it into his palm.

This pill was a pale red color, slightly smaller than the previous one, with a smooth and round surface. After flipping it over a dozen times, Li Yuanjiao could not find a single pattern on it.

I knew it! No wonder the Azure Pond Sect collects blood qi and resentment qi every year; most of them must be used for this! The Azure Pond Sect releases thousands of pills annually, sustaining half of the Yue State... How many circulate in the market?

Li Yuanjiao slowly closed his eyes, knowing that even within the Li Family, almost everyone had taken these pills. Only a few from the generation of Xi and Yue, who had just started cultivating, had not yet taken any...

Seeing his brother's inexplicable expression, Li Yuanping grew extremely anxious. Li Yuanjiao spoke in a low, deep voice, "Brother Ping, all the pills released by the Azure Pond Sect are made using mortal blood qi... Their high-level techniques remove the resentment qi, leaving only the blood qi and essence qi, making it just another ingredient, letting it go unnoticed by people... That pill Granduncle took back then was not an Essence Gathering Pill. The Chi Family knew Lord Chejing would never take that pill but would leave it for our family. They used another's immortal foundation to specially refine it... It might have been the Boundless Ocean!"

After explaining his deductions in detail, Li Yuanping stood still, staring at his brother, speechless for several moments. He slowly sat down, his face bewildered, muttering, "We have all consumed them... Every cultivator in Yue State takes these pills... The Azure Pond Sect has existed for five hundred years. Rogue cultivators, sect cultivators, clan cultivators—whether they know it or not—have been consuming these pills for generations! I have taken them, my father took them, my grandfather took them, and so did our ancestors... You and I... we have been eating humans, and we are also descendants of those who eat humans."

After finally processing this shocking news, he trembled and asked, "In your opinion, do any other clans know?"

"I have no idea."

Li Yuanjiao shook his head slowly, his expression complex, and said, "It is hard to say about the Yuan Family, but Xiao Yuansi is a righteous gentleman and must be unaware of this. As for the Xiao Family, having dominated for so many years, I cannot believe... not a chance, that they do not know."

At the peak of Mount Lijing.

Li Qinghong slowly clenched her fair and delicate hands into fists. The bluish-gray mirror faintly reflected her fine features. The spiritual sense magnified by the mirror covered not just Lijing Town but far beyond. She had heard every word exchanged between the two clearly.

"So that is how it is..."

She recalled the few pills she had consumed, wondering how many men, women, children, and elders had contributed their blood qi to those pills. A wave of nausea swept over her. Beside her, Lu Jiangxian was stunned, his heart sinking.

"The Azure Pond Sect... what kind of trickery is this? This means that the entire Yue State, and even all of Jiangnan, have been consuming these pills..."

For a moment, he was at a loss for words. After all, Lu Jiangxian came from a society that was governed by strict laws. Internally, he drew a line for the Li Family.

No slaughter, no blood sacrifice... I cannot bear to see that. If the Li Family gets involved in this, I might as well use the Profound Light to destroy them... But now, what should I do?

Lu Jiangxian's already limited knowledge was concentrated in the realm of shamanic spells and talismans. When it came to alchemy, his understanding remained at the level of those few alchemical books he had studied. Naturally, he could not identify the issues with these pills.

Furthermore, back when Li Tongya took the pills, Lu Jiangxian was just a novice. If Wang Xun had not pointed it out, he would have had no awareness of the problem contained within.

"Forget it. If they have unknowingly eaten these human meat buns, can it really be considered a crime...?" He sighed as he focused intently on the mirror, its profound light radiating and clearing the minds of the people below him, waking them from their state of growing inner demons.

Seeing the gradually awakening group, Lu Jiangxian felt troubled again. If the Li Family knowingly continued to consume these blood qi pills in the future... what then?

"Logically, past actions cannot be judged, and addressing it now would be too conspicuous. Moreover, these pills, refined from pure blood qi, would not trigger the talisman seeds' warnings... It is impossible to monitor the Li Family constantly..." Lu Jiangxian sighed deeply, shrinking within the mirror's world.

He murmured quietly, "The world is filthy... it is impossible to climb up cleanly. Let's take it one step at a time. Now that the Li Family has their own alchemist, they have room to maneuver. Let's see how they handle this!"

————

The members of the Li Family were deeply shaken by the news that had just been revealed to them. Meanwhile, in the side courtyard, Wang Xun gently held the long sword in front of him, hesitating for a moment as he appeared lost in thought.

"This Li Family still adheres to the righteous path, a rarity under the rule of these Jiangnan powers... But I wonder how long they can endure in such a corrupt world..."

The young man's eyebrows slightly furrowed, showing a hint of compassion. Even his own Wang Family could only avoid the world, what more could a mere Foundation Establishment Realm family achieve?

The currents of the world were like a torrent, and even his family's True Monarch could only protect the clan, let alone consider anything beyond that.

"The Heaven Dao is flawed, and we are powerless... If it were not for my family's teachings of seclusion, we would have been destroyed in that great calamity..."

Wang Xun brought his two fingers together and gently stroked the green-white sword. The clear, bright sword aura reflected in his eyes, filled with innocence, kindness along with... deep pain and guilt.

Although he came from a prestigious family, he had traveled the world, but he was unfamiliar with southern customs. Knowing that the Li Family dared not offend him, he could have easily given a few pills to appease them and avoid further entanglements.

However, as he traveled, he saw only joy and strict laws under the Li Family's governance, making him find them endearing. He felt compelled to offer something better, hence he had taken out the spirit root and given it to the Li Family willingly.

"Jiangnan is indeed as described in the books, with various factions pulling strings and everyone being powerless. Only the Yue Cultivating Sect seems somewhat righteous..."

With this thought, Wang Xun could not help but feel a sense of doubt and pondered, "That True Monarch is not a benevolent person, yet the Yue Cultivating Sect has adhered to the rules set by the Immortal Lord for so many years without overstepping their boundaries... which is truly puzzling."

He mulled over it but could not figure it out. Naturally gifted with an innate connection to the way of the sword, he was not adept at pondering these schemes and conspiracies. He shifted his thoughts and felt the grief and indignation within the spirit of the Qingche Sword.

"That Li Family Sword Immortal has indeed suffered an unjust death..."

Wang Xun let out a bitter laugh. Having traveled in the north, he found it to be dead and stagnant under the Buddhism rule, with everything remaining the same year after year. The Maha forever remained Maha, and the lowly commoners forever remained lowly commoners, filled with despair.

Jiangnan, on the other hand, was constantly chaotic, filled with betrayal and slaughter. Today, someone might break through the Qi Cultivation Realm and forge an artifact to annex another clan, and tomorrow, that person might be killed, resulting in the annihilation of their clan... It was not any better.

Placing the Qingche Sword on his knee, Wang Xun formed a seal and performed a spell, extracting strands of white sword intent. He sighed as he muttered quietly to himself, "If I had to choose, I would rather be born in Jiangnan... At least there is a path to take."
