# Chapter 712: The Northern Brocade River King

As the demon prostrated himself before the array, Li Zhouwei suspected that the cultivators from Dense Cloud Cave were still inside. He took a step forward, the light from his halberd casting a heavenly glow, and demanded, “This king smells humans on your territory. How many cultivators are there? Are they for boiling or for stewing? Or are they envoys from some other power?”

The question made the snake demon realize why this powerful figure had demanded he come out rather than entering the array himself. “This lowly demon has no great backing,” he said respectfully. “I was unaware of Your Majesty’s arrival and would never dare to harm you. The ones in the array are from a small, local power… called Dense Cloud Cave. They came to deliver some blood-food to me.”

He continued, “A new Bright Yang Purple Mansion Immortal Clan has appeared to the south, and they want to claim this land. They’re a rather stubborn lot. Though I do not fear them, I can’t be bothered to deal with them. I accepted the blood-food from Dense Cloud Cave and offered to introduce them to my great king.”

“Oh?”

Li Zhouwei remained outside the array, seating himself on the ground. “Your great king intends to meddle in the affairs of mortals?”

“Of course not…” The snake demon hesitated for a moment, but deciding this wasn’t exactly a secret, he focused on pleasing the golden-eyed beast before him. “It’s just a small matter. Baijiang Creek is the main waterway here, and my king cultivates the Dao of Converging Water. As the master of these waters, it is a simple thing for him to control the spiritual springs and, by extension, influence the spirit rice paddies…”

He lowered his head. “The people from the White Ye Immortal Sect also seem to have other matters to discuss with the Great King… As for what those are… this one does not know.”

As he spoke, his gaudy, multicolored robes pooled on the ground around him. Li Zhouwei judged from his appearance that his true form was likely a patterned python. Just as he came to this conclusion, two more cultivators flew out from the cave on the mountain. The leader was a woman wearing heavy, garish makeup, her face a mask of vigilance as she descended.

The snake demon didn't recognize Li Zhouwei, but no one from the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion could ever forget him. The moment he had appeared before the mountain, the disciples from Dense Cloud Cave had identified him. Within a few sentences, their own Foundation Establishment cultivator had been summoned.

Li Zhouwei secretly tightened his grip on his halberd. The Concealed Plunder Gold in his Juque Palace flared, and he silently activated Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, pushing his spiritual qi to its absolute peak. The patterned python demon heard a frantic shout from within the array.

“Manghuazi! Don’t let him fool you… He’s from the Li clan!”

The python demon, Manghuazi, looked up in a daze. Li Zhouwei’s expression was unchanged, but a single point of golden light suddenly erupted from between his thick brows.

*Boom!*

A deafening crack echoed from above as a golden flash of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light flickered through the air, gone in an instant. The light was so bright it brought tears to Manghuazi’s eyes. He scrambled to his feet and summoned a demonic wind, trying to flee.

But the woman in heavy makeup had just exited the array and flown right into the path of the attack. It struck her with a resounding bang, sending a shower of fiery sparks from her body as white smoke billowed forth.

“Aiyee… the pain!” she shrieked.

With the snake demon right in front of him, how could Li Zhouwei let him escape? Using Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light on him would have been a waste. He had first used the brilliant flash of light to take down the strongest of the Dense Cloud Cave cultivators. Only then did he raise his Grand Ascension Halberd.

“And where do you think you’re going?”

Manghuazi was shocked, furious, and deeply ashamed. He assumed Li Zhouwei had used some bizarre Immortal Foundation or strange shamanic art to trick him. He summoned a bone-white dharma treasure and brandished it, snarling, “You—”

He only managed to get out a single word before the Grand Ascension Halberd was at his chest. A black and red halo, a signature of the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts, flew out, melding with the bright light and casting an inky shadow. Manghuazi had no time to speak; he could only grit his teeth and block with his dharma treasure.

*Clang!*

The halberd slammed into the bone artifact with a dull thud. Manghuazi’s face went white, and he nearly reverted to his true form.

Li Zhouwei had been at the Foundation Establishment Realm for over a decade, spending far more time on his techniques than on cultivation itself. His constant struggles against the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion had forged him into an exceptional warrior. Though only at the mid-stage of his realm, he was a veteran of a hundred battles, his cultivation base incredibly solid.

Manghuazi was also a mid-stage Foundation Establishment demon, but his skills were unremarkable. He was no match for Li Zhouwei. The moment their weapons met, he knew he was in trouble. Only the quality of his dharma treasure saved him from total humiliation.

But Li Zhouwei simply applied pressure, turning the Grand Ascension Halberd so its specially crafted crescent blade hooked the bone artifact, trapping it in a surge of radiant light.

Manghuazi couldn't pull his weapon free. He saw another bright light gathering between Li Zhouwei’s brows and felt his soul tremble in terror. ‘What kind of man is this?’ he thought, aggrieved. ‘He must be a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion cultivator! A figure like the Northern Brocade River King himself! This is like using a butcher’s cleaver to kill a chicken!’

He took a sharp breath, drew upon his spiritual qi, and activated his Immortal Foundation, Concealing Dust Mist. A cloud of absolute darkness erupted from his mouth, shrouding his form completely and hoping to make the light between his foe’s brows lose its target.

“A cheap trick!”

Li Zhouwei’s eyes snapped open, blazing with a golden light that pierced through the darkness. The Way of the Bright Yang was not lacking in perceptive arts, to say nothing of his own innate ocular abilities.

“By my decree!” he commanded.

A spark of fire exploded, and the white smoke scattered. Manghuazi let out a wretched cry as a rain of blood fell from a new, gaping hole in his chest. “Please, My Lord, spare me!” he shrieked in a panic. “Report to my great king first, it won’t be too late to kill me then…”

Before he could finish, the Grand Ascension Halberd descended from the sky. Manghuazi could no longer maintain his human form and reverted to a massive, brightly patterned python. He crashed into the forest below, and the halberd followed, pinning him through his vital point, seven inches below his head, rendering him immobile.

Li Zhouwei had not even used his full strength. His Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner remained in his sleeve, and he had not yet prepared the Sun's Resonant Radiance Art. The demon was subdued. He strode to the python’s head and ordered, “Summon the Northern Brocade River King.”

While Manghuazi was swiftly defeated, the others from Dense Cloud Cave fared no better. Li Chenghui’s reputation was well known, and with their leader already injured by Li Zhouwei, none dared to challenge him. They scattered in retreat.

Li Minggong held her Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier. The woman who had taken the first hit managed to steady herself and maintain the defensive array. “Are you from Moongaze Lake?” she yelled from the edge of the barrier. “My Dense Cloud Cave has not offended your immortal clan! Why do you attack me?”

“Dense Cloud Cave?” Li Minggong shook her head, her voice ringing out. “We were ordered to eliminate demons. All we see here are a few demonic cultivators colluding with evil. We see no one from Dense Cloud Cave.”

The woman was speechless. Contacting the demon wasn’t a major crime, but being cornered by the Li family like this, they could say whatever they pleased. Fury rose in her heart. “Don’t push us too far!”

“Push you too far?” Li Minggong found this laughable. She recognized the woman now—it was Miaoshui of Dense Cloud Cave. They had clashed before, and back then, neither had shown any mercy. She raised the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, puffed out her cheeks, and blew gently.

With her breath, the Pure Feather Li-Fire within the brazier erupted in a flurry of crimson and white feathers, drifting down toward Miaoshui’s face.

Miaoshui, of course, remembered Li Minggong, but in her memory, the girl had been a nobody, easily beaten within twenty exchanges. She hadn’t given her a second thought. But now, as the feather-like flames drifted toward her, she felt a stinging pain on her skin.

She was already injured and her spiritual qi was in turmoil from Li Zhouwei’s attack. In contrast, Li Minggong, newly equipped with the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, now wielded an enhanced Pure Feather Li-Fire. For a moment, Miaoshui was completely suppressed. Even more terrifying was Li Chenghui, standing right behind Li Minggong!

Li Minggong alone was more than she could handle, to say nothing of Li Chenghui watching like a tiger. “Quickly, come out of the array and help me!” Miaoshui cried.

The great array belonged to Manghuazi. It was easy enough for Miaoshui to exit, but she couldn’t simply retreat back inside. The few people still within the barrier heard her plea and hesitated.

‘Li Zhouwei is out there, too,’ they thought. ‘Going out now would be suicide.’

The weakness of a motley crew like Dense Cloud Cave was once again on full display. Not a single person moved. Miaoshui was livid. “Staying in the array is just waiting to die! What’s the difference?” she snarled.

Finally, someone rode the wind out of the array, shouting that they were coming to her aid. The old man, Qu Bushi, ever the opportunist, immediately grabbed his own dharma treasure and moved to assist Li Chenghui. Li Chenghui held one hand out flat, and six silver-white talismans of profound punishment rose into the air, spinning around his wrist and emitting an intense, crackling light.

“Where Yang culminates, the Six Thunders are born!”

Qu Bushi tied up one opponent, and Li Chenghui’s silver lightning immediately surged forth, striking the other. The demonic cultivator didn’t even utter a word, only a world-shaking scream as black energy rolled off his body.

Though Li Chenghui’s cultivation was not yet at the level of the late Li Qinghong, his mastery of lightning arts was only a step behind. A single bolt had nearly knocked his opponent unconscious. Li Qinghong had possessed great talent for cultivation and a passion for the spear, but she had little aptitude for spellcasting. Li Chenghui was entirely different. Not only was his cultivation method the more complete Celestial Cloud Thunder-Questioning Method, but he had spent his life practicing amidst the thunderstorms of the Eastern Sea. By the time he reached Foundation Establishment, the Li family was already a great clan, and the resources he received were far superior.

Most critically, all of Li Qinghong’s lifelong research into the profound-light secret arts of the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring had been left to the clan!

Wielding his dharma treasure, he was a truly imposing figure. His opponent was a demonic cultivator, and within twenty exchanges, the man was already half-dead. Qu Bushi watched, his eyes burning with excitement.

“Excellent, excellent… The Li clan is truly on the rise! Li Chenghui alone is formidable enough, and they still have Li Zhouwei!”

The old man had cultivated for many years and had a sharp eye. Li Chenghui’s Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman was clearly superior to the Crimson Flame Brazier, and he could see at a glance that Li Minggong relied on the power of her treasure, whereas Li Chenghui’s strength was his own.

While Li Chenghui suppressed the demonic cultivator in a matter of moments, Li Minggong steadily kept the pressure on Miaoshui. She knew the woman was cunning and that calling her allies out was merely a ploy to create a chance for her own escape. She remained vigilant, never giving her an opening.

It was only when Li Zhouwei returned, having subdued Manghuazi, that Miaoshui finally understood there was no escape. “For your esteemed clan to suppress a member of the water clans like this… Do you hold the Northern Brocade River King in such low regard?” she said in a low voice. “My cave master has already paid his respects to your Daoist Master. Our two families have reconciled. Why must you do this to me?”

She was playing dumb, but Li Zhouwei didn’t bother to answer her. He simply felt the moisture in the air thicken. The creek began to rise, the waters of Baijiang Creek churning below them. He crossed his arms and waited.

Li Chenghui sensed it too and narrowed his eyes.

“It’s the Northern Brocade River King!” Qu Bushi said in a panic.

As if on cue, a waterfall erupted from the surface of the creek, spraying white water high into the sky. A magnificent, aquamarine chariot burst from the waves, shimmering in the light. Two rows of shrimp soldiers and crab generals rode the water, flanking the carriage as the creek surged, flooding the base of the mountain.

Manghuazi, pinned to the ground, gave no reaction, but a wave of relief washed over Miaoshui. Though still surrounded by enemies, she couldn't help but smile to herself. ‘Now things are truly messy… With me and Manghuazi on the same side, it couldn’t be clearer who’s in the right and who’s in the wrong, could it?’

At the front of the carriage stood a hunchbacked old man in a heavy, ink-black coat, holding a conch shell that seemed entirely out of place. The carriage sped toward the base of the mountain. “I wonder which mountain’s great lord you might be?” the old man called out in a gravelly voice. “If this little snake has disturbed you, there was no need to go this far…”

His words were polite, but his expression was anything but. If not for Li Zhouwei’s unusual appearance, he likely wouldn’t have bothered with even that much courtesy. Hearing this, Miaoshui quickly shouted, “My Lord, these are the soldiers of the Li clan! They attacked Manghuazi without any provocation…”

Li Minggong gritted her teeth, and the flames from her brazier burned hotter. But a clear, cold voice cut through the air from within the carriage.

“Shui Zhao… enough!”

The old man in black, Shui Zhao, fell silent. The crystal curtain of the carriage was drawn aside, and a man stepped out.

He was tall, dressed in a turquoise, silk-brocaded shortcoat, over which he wore a white velvet cloak embroidered with a scene of a great green sea. One could faintly see fine, azure scales covering his neck, giving him an air that was both demonic and majestic.

The moment he appeared, Li Zhouwei recognized him.

‘So, it’s you…’

The suspicions Li Zhouwei had been harboring were finally confirmed. A wave of relief washed over him, and he had to suppress a laugh.

Years ago, as a guest of the Dragon Prince Dingjiao, Li Zhouwei had been entertained with wine and song aboard his vessel. The entertainment had included a battle between two noble beasts for sport… one was a Treasure-Scaled Ferry-Beast, and the other was an Azure-Necked Flood Dragon. Before Dingjiao, they were like two dogs, tearing into each other for their master’s amusement.

This Northern Brocade River King—was none other than that same Azure-Necked Flood Dragon!

He even recalled Dingjiao asking for his opinion on a technique, the Converging Water Profound Light. The memory had stuck with him. So when old Qu had mentioned a master of the Dao of Converging Water who used a profound light to create maddening illusions and dissolve people into blood, the connection had immediately formed in his mind.

Seeing him now, he knew his guess was correct. Li Zhouwei’s face remained impassive, but inwardly he was laughing. ‘I heard the Dragon Prince valued him highly. Whenever the prince passed by Baijiang Creek, he would specifically send for him. Well, how is this not sending for him specifically? Excellent!’

As Li Zhouwei recognized the Azure-Necked Flood Dragon, the Northern Brocade River King’s sharp, authoritative gaze swept over the scene. His face was a mask of clear displeasure—until his eyes met Li Zhouwei’s.

In a single instant, his expression shifted from calm to startled, and from startled to utter, abject terror. The Azure-Necked Flood Dragon was horrified. He immediately rode the water over, and before the stunned eyes of everyone present, he arrived before Li Zhouwei, bowed deeply, and said with the utmost respect:

“Greetings, Great King… A lowly demon under my command has been so blind as to offend Your Majesty… I am overwhelmed with shame and fear. I will have this thing’s life at once and prepare a snake stew for you.”

The Azure-Necked Flood Dragon turned his head, and the look he gave the pinned Manghuazi was filled with a chilling hatred and disgust, as if he were looking at something utterly repellent.

“Shui Zhao,” he commanded coldly. “Kill it at once!”
