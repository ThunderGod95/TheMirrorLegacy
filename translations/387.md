# Chapter 496: Generation Of Cheng and Ming

Mount Qingdu had been here for nearly ten years now. The earth vein had shifted, and three small peaks had emerged on either side, varying in height. The tallest of these mountains rose about a hundred ren, reaching halfway up the main Qingdu Peak, while the shortest stood at fifty to sixty ren. Many houses had been constructed on these slopes. [1]

The highest secondary peak was Talisman Peak which was reserved all year round for Li Xuanxuan, along with several apprentices that were practicing the Talisman Dao.

As for the lower peaks, they were occupied by the brothers from the minor sect of the Li Family‚ÄîLi Chengchu and Li Chengyou.

By now, those two brothers had successfully condensed the Jade Capital Chakra. They had been working alongside Li Xicheng to manage family affairs and were considered reliable.

Xicheng conducts himself well... The two brothers have been raised in Qingdu Cave Dwelling since childhood as well; they are both loyal and dependable.

Li Yuanjiao rode the wind and landed back at Mount Qingdu. The cave entrance atop the mountain was brightly lit, and guarded by two men. The stone steps he descended led to a huge cave dwelling.

The former Snake Demon Cave Dwelling was now known as Qingdu Cave Dwelling, having been renovated by the Li Family over the decades. The holes in the walls were neatly arranged, and though the spiritual energy here was not particularly strong, it was extremely spacious and capable of accommodating several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Supporting Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators was a challenge for many prestigious clans. Thanks to Li Tongya's foresight in claiming this site years ago, the Li Family faces no shortage of space even with an increasing number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators now.

The fire vein on Mount Wutu has been developed, and Kong Gusun of the Profound Peak Gate is still overseeing it, ensuring its stability. Ximing has started to relocate there... Qinghong is in seclusion again; no wonder it feels so deserted here.

As he was observing the scenery before him, Li Xijun approached on the wind and bowed respectfully.

"Greetings, Second Uncle."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in response and asked, "When do you plan to attempt a breakthrough in seclusion?"

Although Li Xijun had always been dependable when it came to work, he had lingered at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm for some time now, accumulating his cultivation. Given the majestic aura he now possessed, he seemed ready for a breakthrough.

"Probably within these few days," he replied respectfully.

Li Xijun and Li Yuanjiao wandered around the Qingdu Cave Dwelling for a while when a faint sound suddenly caught their attention.

Li Yuanjiao remarked, "Ahead is..."

"Most of the children of the Cheng and Ming generation are cultivating in this cave dwelling," Li Xijun replied.

It was only at this moment that realization dawned upon Li Yuanjiao.

"More than ten years have passed without us noticing, and the children from the generation of Cheng and Ming have grown up..."

The two of them rode the wind forward and found a group of teenagers gathered in the courtyard, sparring with each other in excitement.

These boys and girls were, of course, the children of the Cheng and Ming generation in the family.

This was the first time Li Yuanjiao had seen this group of children. He gently observed them, concealing his presence. Since these children had yet to reach the Jade Capital Stage, he could easily hide himself without using the power of his Profound Patterned Bottle.

Li Xijun had been in seclusion for several years, dedicating himself to rigorous cultivation with little time to spend with family, so he had only seen the children a few times before. He too performed a hand seal to conceal his presence, then stood among the clouds and watched them.

The youngest among them was only six, while the oldest was about fifteen or sixteen. Their cultivation levels ranged from the first to the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

"No wonder Brother Cheng said there's no one who particularly stands out... Most of these children can only be considered slightly above average."

Li Xicheng, the least talented among the Xi and Yue generation, had already reached the Celestial Whirl Stage at fifteen. Although the generation of Cheng and Ming was flourishing, most of its members in the major sect were promoted from the minor sect. Li Xicheng and a few cultivators of the Xi and Yue generation were yet to have children, leaving no one with extraordinary talent.

Li Xijun's gaze lingered on the group in the courtyard. While none was particularly outstanding, the oldest boy was tall and spoke with an air of confidence.
ùòßùìá‚ÑØ‚ÑØùë§‚ÑØùò£ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìãùëíùëô.ùëêùò∞ùëö

With thick eyebrows and sparkling eyes, he held a spear in his hand and stood in the center of the courtyard, managing his younger brothers and sisters, who all seemed to respect him.

Li Xijun observed him closely as he organized the matches among the children, instructed his younger siblings, and helped the injured ones. He found him rather interesting.

Li Yuanjiao, focused intently on the scene below him, noticed the boys and girls chatting together and felt a swell of happiness as he floated down.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

"Brother Liao!"

Li Chengliao, now sixteen, was the oldest among the children. With thick eyebrows, he appeared unremarkable but commanded attention as he stood with a sword in hand. He had just finished training with the other disciples and invited them to sit together.

Once they were seated, Li Chengliao took a central position. One of the younger disciples asked, "Brother Liao, what are you discussing today? Immortal Foundation?"

Li Chengliao replied, "You all come to me for answers, but there are only a few paths to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm in our family. If you want to find out how miraculous it is, you should just cultivate it yourself."

"Big Brother, you're being unreasonable!"

The girl beside him smiled, her round eyes sparkling and her eyebrows gracefully arched.

"Not many in our family managed to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. You're a direct descendant with exceptional talent, capable of succeeding in anything you cultivate. We may not be as gifted as you, so we listen for fun... How can we realistically hope to achieve it?" she remarked.

The other boys and girls nodded in agreement glumly. However, a child in the corner piped up, his voice clear and assertive.

"Sister Gong, what you said isn't necessarily true. My father told me that our great-great-grandfather didn't break through to Jade Capital Stage until he was over twenty, and he still managed to establish Boundless Ocean! Foundation Establishment isn't just about talent."

For this group of teenagers, achieving Foundation Establishment was a rare feat, a mark of a great master. The miracle tales of the immortal foundations were passed down through generations, growing more enigmatic with each retelling. Naturally, they all aspired to establish one.

Li Chengliao nodded, adopting the tone of an elder.

"Chenghui is right! Everyone should cultivate diligently. We're all disciples of the major sect and have entered Qingdu. Even if we cannot achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm, we must at least become Qi Cultivators at all costs. We cannot disgrace our lineages!"

The disciples responded with murmurs of agreement. Although a few teenagers exchanged competitive glances, the overall atmosphere among their generation remained harmonious.

Li Chengliao smiled at his brothers and sisters and continued, "I heard our clan has a new method called the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique, a Grade Four cultivation manual. After consuming the Long Marching Pheasant Flame spiritual qi, one would be able to establish an immortal foundation known as Pheasant Li March."

The girl named Li Minggong eagerly asked, "What's so special about it?"

"How should I know?" Li Chengliao replied, somewhat annoyed. The teenagers erupted into laughter, their eyes filled with longing as they began discussing the technique. Meanwhile, Li Chengyu fell into deep thought.

Standing beside Li Yuanjiao, Li Xijun remarked softly, "Not bad, they all conduct themselves properly... At least they've grown up in Qingdu Cave Dwelling and receive teachings every day."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly. His nephew, who was still standing nearby, added with a touch of regret, "It's a pity that although these children are far more talented than their parents, they still seem mediocre. Their chances of achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm are slim."

Li Xijun's words were tactful. However, without encountering any opportunities, these children were unlikely to reach even the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Yuanjiao hummed softly, a rare tenderness filling his eyes as he smiled and said, "In the past, my granduncle was also the most mediocre among his three surviving brothers, with only the hope of reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm. Who would have thought he would become so famous in Jiangnan today? As long as one possesses a spiritual orifice, there is always hope."

He paused before remarking, "It's a pity that the immortal mirror has never favored these children. They can be pillars of support, but never leaders."

Li Xijun lowered his gaze in silence. With a smile, Li Yuanjiao suggested, "Let's go down and have a look."

1. Ren is an ancient Chinese measurement unit. 1 ren = approximately 1.6 meters. ‚òú

Li Chengliao was busy picking up wooden weapons scattered on the ground when the lively chatter of his brothers and sisters suddenly fell silent. The quietness was so profound that one could hear a pin drop, with only Li Minggong's nervous voice breaking the stillness.

"Brother Liao... Brother Liao..." she called.

Li Chengliao looked up and saw a young man standing before him, dressed in white with a sword at his back, exuding an extraordinary aura.

The teenager's eyes immediately sparkled with excitement as he nervously exclaimed, "Liao'er greets Youngest Uncle!"

Li Xijun was momentarily taken aback, only now realizing that this child was the eldest son of Li Xicheng. He had seen him before, though the boy had not been named at birth. A decade had passed, and he could hardly recognize him.

"Your name is Li Chengliao?" he asked, slightly embarrassed before quickly introducing Li Yuanjiao. In a gentle voice, he said, "Come, Liao'er... Meet your granduncle."

Li Chengliao then noticed a middle-aged man standing beside Li Xijun. He had eyebrows that were close to each other above his sharp eyes and was clad in a simple black robe with a sword at his back.

Granduncle?!

Who else could be referred to as granduncle by Li Xijun so respectfully?

Upon seeing Li Yuanjiao's attire, Li Chengliao felt a surge of awe and excitement. He kneeled and bowed deeply, trembling slightly.

"Chengliao greets... Granduncle!"

The other teenagers, who had just raised their gazes, lowered their heads again, not daring to make eye contact. They bowed together and said in unison, "Junior greets Granduncle!"

Li Chengliao's gaze was fanatical, forcing Li Yuanjiao to look away slightly. He raised his palm gently, gesturing for everyone to stand up.

If Granduncle Tongya were here, these kids would be so overjoyed they'd lose their minds!

Despite his inner thoughts, Li Yuanjiao had always regarded his family members with kindness.

"Which lineage of the major sect are you all from?" he asked gently.

"Li Chengliao, eldest, directly from the second lineage!"

Li Chengliao spoke first, and the girl next to him, Li Minggong, the eldest girl in the group, added respectfully, "Li Minggong, the eldest sister, and granddaughter of Yuanwan from the first lineage."[1]

"Li Chenghui, grandson of Yuanyun from the second lineage."[2]

The twelve children introduced themselves in order of age. Li Yuanjiao nodded, calculating their ages. The most talented, Li Minggong and Li Chengyi, were about the same as Li Xicheng.

He gently encouraged them, "Cultivate diligently. There are many cultivation techniques available in the clan. Aside from a few that require spiritual qi that are too difficult to gather, you can read through them and choose the techniques you wish to practice."

The teenagers responded eagerly.

Li Yuanjiao glanced at the weapons scattered on the ground, which were mainly spears and swords, with very few bows.

"You can practice with any weapon you like; you don't have to limit yourselves to these three. We wish to have people wielding all sorts of different weapons. The clan can also acquire specific cultivation techniques for you from the market," he added.

"Have any of you ever killed anyone? Have you ever slain a demon?" he asked.

When he saw all the children shake their heads, Li Yuanjiao formulated a plan in his mind. He turned to Li Xijun and said, "Inform Xicheng that there are many Qi Cultivators in the family now. Tell the others not to kill the Embryonic Breathing Realm demons caught in various prefectures and towns... Send them over for the kids to train with."

"Understood," Li Xijun replied with a smile. The generation of Cheng and Ming did not seem scared; instead, they all looked eager for the new experience.

Li Yuanjiao paused before saying, "As for killing people... there will be plenty of opportunities for that in the future. There's no need to rush into it so early..."

Putting aside the direct descendants of the Li Family who had perished, there were now more than fifty guest cultivators who had died‚Äîsome by demonic beast attacks, others at the hands of rogue cultivators and devil cultivators.

Although Jiangnan was calmer than the Eastern Sea, incidents of killing and robbery were still prevalent.

Li Yuanjiao instructed the children on their cultivation. Under Li Xijun's excited persuasion, he also reluctantly demonstrated the Jing Dragon King to the younger generation.

At first, Li Chengliao and the others cheered, but when the grayish-green serpent dragon bared its fangs and claws, fear gripped them instantly. They dropped their weapons and slumped to the ground with pale faces.

Rejecting Li Xijun's suggestion to divide his immortal foundation into snakes, shrimps, crabs, and fish to torment the kids from the Cheng and Ming generation, Li Yuanjiao departed with Li Xijun. They flew on clouds and mist, disappearing over the cave dwelling.

The children took a long time to calm down after the two left, but they were now more envious of the power of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.

Li Chengliao's heart raced as he looked at his brothers and sisters beside him, all of them visibly excited.

"Come on, let's cultivate!" he urged.

Li Yuanjiao, observing Li Xijun's amused face, could not help but chuckle softly.

"You really are Qinghong's nephew... Both of you are the same when fooling around! What a handful."

He continued with a fond smile, "When she was a child, she insisted on using a spear to hook peaches, tricking Brother Yun into catching them. The peaches hit Brother Yun, causing him to cry loudly while she laughed joyfully, refusing to stop until Brother Xiu came to scold her."

Li Xijun smiled, clearly seeing the warmth in Li Yuanjiao's eyes. Since Yuanjiao was talking about Li Xijun's other elders, he merely listened and refrained from commenting.

After reminiscing for a moment, Li Yuanjiao snapped back to his senses and realized he had lost his composure. He returned to his usual serious demeanor, but his tone softened as he remarked, "The children are all good and very adorable."

Li Xijun cupped his fist and replied gently, "I've spoken with Brother Ming about Uncle Xuanxuan; he's been wanting to meet you."

"All right, I'll go and see him now," Li Yuanjiao replied simply.

Li Xijun nodded and left, heading to Mount Wutu first to inform Li Ximing, ensuring that Li Yuanjiao would not walk in on any embarrassing situation.

Li Yuanjiao was fully aware of the situation but chose not to talk about it. Instead, he waited for the right moment before slowly descending onto Mount Wutu.

On Mount Wutu...

Li Ximing had already tidied up the place and was waiting for his arrival. Once the uncle and nephew were seated, Li Yuanjiao listened as Li Ximing respectfully recounted the events.
ùíáùôßùôöùìÆùô¨ùôöùì´ùíèùì∏ùìøùìÆùíç.ùì¨ùô§ùì∂

He resisted the urge to ask, "Did Xijun teach you that?" and spoke in a deep voice, "That's not a bad idea... Hengzhu Gate has been established for many years. What did your grandfather say?"

Li Ximing quickly replied, "Xijun asked him, and the old man insisted on finishing the talismans for the next two years before leaving. It will take some time."

"As long as he's willing to go," Li Yuanjiao said.

He looked Li Ximing up and down before nodding in approval.

"Not bad. You're almost at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm."

Li Ximing quickly explained, "I could have made a breakthrough, but I feel that I've been progressing too quickly lately. I worry that my foundation isn't stable, so I haven't attempted to break through yet."

"Hmm."

Li Yuanjiao nodded. Given that Li Ximing had received the teachings from both the Xiao and Li families in his cultivation, Li Yuanjiao believed that he would not make such a simple mistake.

As he glanced around the courtyard, he noticed a painting hanging in the corner, mostly completed. It depicted Li Ximing seated in a white robe, his expression calm and serene.

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly and commented, "That painting is very lifelike."

Li Ximing nodded awkwardly, prompting Li Yuanjiao to turn to him and ask, "Do you like it?"

Li Ximing was taken aback by the question and replied, "It's just a painting..."

With a sigh, Li Yuanjiao turned and left, hands clasped behind his back.

1. This is the first time Li Yuanwan has been mentioned. He is the child of Li Xuanxuan and one of his concubines. So Li Minggong is Li Changhu's lineage. ‚òú

2. Li Chenghui is the child of the child of Li Yuanyun and one of his concubines. So he is from Tongya's lineage. Likewise, Li Chengyou and Li Chengchu are also children of the child of Li Yuanyun with ANOTHER concubine. These children with grandmothers who are concubines are all from minor sect. ‚òú
