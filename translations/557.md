# Chapter 854: Yu Jiang

Li Qinghong leveled her silver spear at her opponent with one hand, while the other hand formed two fingers pointing diagonally at the ground. Bright lightning gathered at her fingertips. As raging gray fire shot toward her, she brought her slender hand to her lips, exhaled a breath of lightning, and intoned, “When the sun reaches its height, it births six thunders!”

A thunderous boom rang out as six dazzlingly bright silver-white rays of light emerged before her. Six slender, elegant command tokens flickered simultaneously, and their runes lit up one by one.

Boom!

The six ancient command tokens aligned their bases, forming a six-sided silver-white array in the air. Explosive silver-white lightning leaped out and soared into the sky. It met the gray fire and instantly blasted it into ash, filling the sky with silver-white fragments.

Not only was this silver lightning incredibly powerful, it also followed the mana connection of the gray fire back to the red robed man’s palms. It flickered on and off, sending a numbness through both his hands.

“This!”

The red robed man’s expression changed dramatically. He hurriedly shook off the spell art in his hands, dropping a clump of gray fire that gleamed with silver light as it shuddered and contracted in the air.

Boom!

The gray fire, no longer under his control, hit the ground like thunder and exploded, sending gray dust flying everywhere. It fell like rain. He stared at the six dharma artifacts as if he’d seen a ghost.

Although Crimson Reef Island’s east and west sides were at odds and Guo Hongjian had suffered because of it, the Merging Fire Command Token he held had been granted by the island itself and was considered excellent among Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. But now when his opponent produced six command tokens of similar, if not higher, quality, Guo Hongjian was at a loss for words.

“Ah?”

Then he looked at her fine dharma artifact spear and the mysterious greenish-white feathered robe she wore, each piece no worse than his own, and felt shock and confusion rise within him, Am I the Purple Mansion Realm descendant, or is she? How could a single family have so many high-quality treasures?! What is this?!

He was frozen in shock, but Li Qinghong didn’t wait for him. Using the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens in real combat for the first time had yielded surprisingly satisfying results. She deftly formed a hand seal with her slender fingers.

The six command tokens suddenly leaped up. One started to crackle with lightning and rose to float upside down over another below, while the other four positioned themselves at the east, west, south, and north.

She parted her vermilion lips and said coldly, “Rabbit enters Dragon Palace, bestow the Profound Punishment.”

Guo Hongjian only heard the thunder roar. He clasped his hands together and slapped them down on his command token. A pillar of gray Merging Fire shot skyward, enveloping him. He heard the clouds herald thunder as the roiling Merging Fire wrapped around him.

Boom!

A silver-white lightning bolt descended from the sky, and the Merging Fire surrounding him exploded. A silver-white glow ate its way through the gray flames, making them sizzle and hiss.

Fortunately, the lightning only flickered for a moment before vanishing. Guo Hongjian’s face turned pale, then regained some color. He dispersed the flames, his hands slightly numb, and flung out a sleeve of black smoke, secretly relieved, Thank goodness we’re not in the Eastern Sea!

Unfortunately, we’re not in the Eastern Sea... Li Qinghong felt a tinge of regret. She drew back her dharma seal, and the silver command tokens gathered together to form a six-sided silver formation.

It’s a pity I’m not skilled in spell arts... I can only partially activate these Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens. They cannot be fully utilized...

These two invocations were not her own invention but were inscribed within the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens when she had refined them. There were six in total, each very powerful, but controlling them was extremely cumbersome. Li Qinghong hadn’t had the artifact for long and had barely deciphered two of the spells. She sighed inwardly, The first spell is still decent... but the last one falls far short of what the description says... Maybe it’s because of the changes in the heavens, and the thunder no longer exists. If this were the Eastern Sea during the Falling Water Rising Storm, this strike could at least injure him.

A thought flickered in her mind. She flipped her hand over, and all six thunder tokens leaped apart and floated at her side. Her feathered robe glowed greenish-white, and her spear pierced through the thunder shadow in an instant.

Her spear danced, spreading a field of purple sparrow shadows in the air. But Guo Hongjian was a direct descendant of Crimson Reef Island and had managed to regain his footing during the exchange. His command token flew up, capturing two points of gray light.

He formed a seal and shouted, “Go!”

The two gray lights shot toward Li Qinghong at lightning speed. Gray fire erupted around her and dove into her mana. She used her mana to disperse them, swung her spear across, and slashed at his chest, only to see a black round shield materialize in front of him. The two collided, and purple lightning exploded.

The black shield fell away, smoking, and Guo Hongjian seized the chance to pull back. Li Qinghong’s spear never paused, but as she thrust to pursue him, the gray fire on her body burned ever fiercer. It clashed with the lightning and gave off thick black smoke, forcing her to retreat a step.

Merging Fire shortens lifespan and damages life force. It transforms into artifacts to dispel evil, and like a malignant tumor, it burns stronger with every moment it’s allowed to burn...

Now that the Li Family’s legacy had grown more complete, she could now recognize many famous Dao lineages. Li Qinghong instantly recalled the nature of Merging Fire and dared not allow the flames to burn unchecked. She stopped immediately.

Sure enough, the gray fire clung to her mana, rapidly burning through her mana. Merging Fire could also damage her Dharma robe, yet withdrawing her mana would damage her Cyan Sparrow Plume.

She had no choice but to press her two fingers together and activate her Immortal Foundation. The purple lightning on her body grew denser until it gradually suppressed the Merging Fire. Guo Hongjian hailed from Crimson Reef Island, so he had used this move successfully many times. Knowing her reaction, how could he give up?

He thrust his palm forward to restrain her and shouted, “Fire, come!”

Two streams of gray fire spewed from between his lips and poured into his palm. They were then guided by his Merging Fire command token, transforming into two talisman seals that shot toward her face.

Li Qinghong sidestepped and raised her spear, summoning lightning. But the spear shadow seemed a bit too thin amid the raging Merging Fire. It only split the Merging Fire into two sections, but the flames still clung to her. She let out a muffled groan, and her eyes suddenly glowed with purple light, Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique!

She spat out a point of white light from between her apricot lips. It expanded rapidly in the air, not to block the Merging Fire before her but to softly and elegantly bypass it and shoot toward Guo Hongjian.

“Hm?”

Boom!

A waterfall of purple lightning expanded, flowing like clouds and rain in the air. The spell art in Guo Hongjian’s hands was instantly shattered by the lightning, and the intense purple lightning struck toward him. His face turned pale, and he hurriedly pulled out a talisman.

The Merging Fire on Li Qinghong’s body lost its mana source and dimmed slightly. She swung her spear and forcibly extinguished it, though her chest still felt slightly stifled. The Merging Fire on her mana shield continued to burn fiercely.

She freed her hand to form a seal, and the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens instantly retracted to form a barrier between the Merging Fire and her Dharma robe. The purple lightning waterfall condensed for two seconds before slowly dissipating.

Guo Hongjian stumbled out, covered in dust, and coughed up two mouthfuls of blood, which transformed into lightning and drifted away. He spat bitterly, “What formidable thunder arts... what spell art is this from...”

Li Qinghong withdrew her mana. The Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens were arrayed in front of her, shielding her from the Merging Fire. Sure enough, the Merging Fire struggled to burn through the dharma artifact and weakened from having nothing else to consume.

She let out a quiet sigh and thought to herself, Indeed, it is as sturdy as ancient dharma artifacts...

The Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens had a long history and were crafted long ago. Although they weren’t as indestructible as Li Encheng’s Water Wall Pearl, which could even serve as a defensive dharma artifact in its base form, they were still extremely strong. Guo Hongjian’s Merging Fire was not enough to trouble them.

One often suffered from internal reverberations in battles involving thunder arts. After taking a hit from Profound Thunder, Guo Hongjian’s core was shaken, and he had no choice but to pause and recuperate. He could only watch helplessly as his spell was neutralized.

He stared heavily at her and thought, She’s rather troublesome... Since I can’t take her down immediately... it’s inevitable that other devil cultivators might gather...

The two were now in a brief stalemate. Li Qinghong also scanned the demonic smoke. Suddenly she froze, and together with Guo Hongjian, turned to look into the depths of the black smoke. A wild wind swept by, revealing a pair of black boots as a young man emerged.

He wore a black robe and was dressed like a devil cultivator. His sleeves were tightly bound with gray cloth, giving him a lean, capable look. His exposed fingers were slightly pale.

His face was somewhat pale, and his eyebrows slanted upward, giving him a sharp appearance. His gray eyes held an inscrutable light. He crossed his arms over his chest, squinting as he surveyed them. His gaze passed quickly over Guo Hongjian and settled on Li Qinghong, examining her silently.

Li Qinghong didn’t recognize him and took a cautious step back. But Guo Hongjian’s expression brightened. His eyebrows rose as he called out, “Fellow Daoist Yu?!”

His spirits soared instantly and his red robe started to billow. The flames of hatred surged in his heart, and with them a spark of greed. He shouted, “Daoist Yu, help me kill this woman quickly... she has many treasures on her. Let’s divide them together!”

Daoist Yu acted as if he hadn’t heard. He glanced at Li Qinghong, then turned his head, looking at Guo Hongjian with a frown. “What are you supposed to be?”

Guo Hongjian’s face turned pale and then green. He realized this man had a strange temperament. Holding back his anger, he said softly, “I am Guo Hongjian of Crimson Reef Island. A few years ago, I visited the Southern Sea to ask you for a talisman...”

When she heard him call out Daoist Yu’s name so eagerly, Li Qinghong had already been on guard. How could she just stand by and watch them get acquainted? She leaped into the air, riding lightning, and shot through the layers of demonic clouds, heading south.

Purple light streaked through the air in the blink of an eye. Guo Hongjian immediately sensed it and his face turned anxious. He threw out gray fire to intercept her, shouting, “Daoist Yu... we can’t let her escape!”

But the black-robed youth in the sky remained unmoved, arms crossed as he watched the show. Only then did Guo Hongjian rise on his fire, but a white bolt of lightning immediately materialized above him. Having just been hit by one, he was instantly terrified out of his wits. All his mana rushed into his Merging Fire command token, and a fierce blaze of Merging Fire enveloped him in an instant.

Psshh...

This white bolt of lightning looked fierce, but when it struck the Merging Fire, it vanished without a trace. No purple lightning waterfall fell. Guo Hongjian froze in shock, and then his expression darkened. When his gout of Merging Fire fell away, he saw that the lightning-augmented glow from Li Qinghong’s Dharma robe was astonishingly fast. She had already flown south.

He landed with a sullen face and looked back at Daoist Yu. The young man wore a mocking smile, as if it was none of his concern.

“Yu Jiang!” Anger flared in Guo Hongjian’s heart, but he gritted his teeth and restrained himself, speaking coldly, “You have quite the patience, Daoist.”

In truth, Guo Hongjian didn’t know this man very well. He had heard of this man’s reputation while stationed in the Southern Sea at the large continent of Danjungwulo and had deliberately gone to visit him to exchange for a talisman.

The Southern Sea had once been home to a major Dao lineage of Buddhist cultivators, and so was full of devil cultivators. An ancient Revered One had once attained enlightenment in Danjungwulo, but now it was very chaotic. The talisman had helped Guo Hongjian a lot, so he had a deep impression of this man.

This man always stayed in the Southern Sea. Why did he suddenly come to Jiangnan... Could it be that he also wanted a share of the spoils...

The black-robed youth, Yu Jiang, watched coldly. His long brows rose as he examined Guo Honjian with a hint of amusement. He said, “If you insist on seeking death, don’t drag me down with you.”

“You!” Guo Hongjian was truly so infuriated that he nearly exploded. His hands folded behind him, he immediately started cursing, “Yu Jiang! I never knew you were such a coward to be so afraid of a mere family thunder cultivator! The two of us fear no thunder. You could have restrained her dharma artifact, and I’d have bound her with Merging Fire. We wouldn’t even need to fight her directly to capture her! Why shrink back like this?!”

“Oh?” Yu Jiang let out a cold laugh, his eyes narrowing dangerously. He replied, “I have never seen a family’s thunder cultivator with such a marvelous dharma artifact and such ancient spell arts.”

“You!” Guo Hongjian snapped back sarcastically, “Who doesn’t have a few lucky opportunities? What does that prove? Couldn’t the Azure Pond Sect have lent her the dharma artifact? So from now on, you’re just going to back off every time you see a cultivator with a remarkable dharma artifact or ancient cultivation techniques?!”

Impatience flickered in Yu Jiang’s eyes as he replied coldly, “The Profound Thunder she used was the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling. Do I really need to explain who controls that grotto heaven now? With so many suspicious details... Aren’t you afraid that Dongfang Heyun is watching from the sidelines?”

The youth swept his sleeve and mocked, “If he decides to take a stroll and kills you like a cat playing with a mouse, who would you go to for justice? Tianwan? Guo Shentong? Could you even find them?

“And even if you did, would they be able to figure out who did it? Even if they guessed, would they dare to utter a single word in front of the Converging Water True Monarch? A single breath from Beijia could leave a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator nursing a century-long injury!”

“This... you... you!” His words were truly sharp. Guo Hongjian’s face turned green, then red, but he found himself unable to retort. He also knew what Yu Jiang meant by a single breath. The gap between a True Monarch and a Daoist Master was like heaven and earth.

Moreover, there were historical examples...

There was an account in the ancient texts of the Valley Water True Monarch named Tianyi. He was once wounded by Earthly Element, his dharma body shattered, leaving only a wisp of Metallic Essence that was about to dissipate. He encountered a greedy Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but blew him to death with a single breath.

Guo Hongjian paused for a few moments, pondering silently, and finally fell quiet.

After hearing this, the matter indeed felt a bit ominous. Guo Hongjian stiffened his face, unwilling to lose face, but also mindful of this man’s talismanic prowess. He didn’t want to offend him and could only mutter stiffly, “I did not understand the subtleties. Thank you for the advice, Daoist.”

Idiot...

Yu Jiang couldn’t be bothered to waste more words with him. Every Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters’ attention was on the grotto heaven. Every moment counted for slipping into Jiangnan. He stepped forward, his mind filled with that thunderous radiance, and muttered softly, “Li Qinghong...”
