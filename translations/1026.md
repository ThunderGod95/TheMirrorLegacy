# Chapter 1026: Nantanchen

Gardenia Scenery Mountain was perpetually covered in a sea of white blossoms. Whenever the wind rose, they would cascade from the mountainside like a waterfall, scattering across the surrounding forests and dotting the landscape with specks of white.

Li Suining arrived on the wind, his silver light flashing. A man in crimson armor stood waiting on the mountain, his dharma power exceptionally deep. His tiger-like eyes were bright and piercing, his presence majestic. It was Ding Weizeng.

"Senior Ding!"

He had clearly been waiting for some time. Seeing Li Suining, he nodded and spoke politely, "The young master has arrived. Please, follow me up the mountain."

Ding Weizeng was Daoist Master Zhaojing’s confidant and had always represented the Daoist Master’s will on the island. His politeness toward Li Suining wasn't born of familiarity, but rather from the fact that Daoist Master Zhaojing had personally promoted Li Suining, creating a sense of closeness.

Beside Ding Weizeng stood a long-bearded old man who appeared ancient. His cultivation was not low, but his features were somewhat shifty and weaselly. Upon seeing Li Suining, he hastily clasped his hands in greeting.

"Nanzhang Ku pays his respects to the young master!"

A strange feeling washed over Li Suining, but he maintained a courteous expression and returned the gesture. "Greetings, Guest Retainer."

This so-called Nanzhang Ku was, in truth, Situ Ku of the former Golden Tang Gate. After the Buddhist cultivators annihilated the Situ family, their bloodline and Dao lineage were carved up by the various powers. The branch that fell into the Li family’s hands was sent to the Eastern Yue territory and merged into what was now the Seven Lineages of Nanzhang. They had all adopted the Nanzhang surname, and he had long since ceased to be called Situ.

Li Suining had rarely heard of Nanzhang Ku. After all, the man had a disgraceful past and had only survived thanks to Ding Weizeng. He had always kept a low profile. In the previous life, Ding Weizeng had perished early—perhaps this man had also fallen in some forgotten battle.

Standing behind Situ Ku was a middle-aged man with sharp, rugged features. His clothes were ordinary, yet they couldn't conceal his keen aura. His eyes lit up when he saw Li Suining.

'Nantanchen!'

Understanding dawned on him in an instant. 'The Daoist Master came out of seclusion to meet with the younger generation. Nantanchen is a genius, and he’s already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm… and he’s an alchemist. It’s only natural he’d be summoned for an audience. So we’ve run into each other here!'

'No wonder Guest Retainer Ding came personally.'

The Nanzhang remnant lineage had finally produced its first Foundation Establishment cultivator after so many years. It was a momentous achievement, one the Daoist Master would surely want to witness. At this moment, Nantanchen had not yet been granted his new name and was still called Nanzhang Chen. Li Suining simply bowed to him with a smile.

"This senior has a truly impressive bearing."

Nanzhang Chen was a talent, but more importantly, he had been born at the right time. In the last life, neither Li Suining nor Pu Xinya had lacked talent, but they had both reached the Foundation Establishment Realm a step too late. Their impact on the grand course of history paled in comparison to figures like Nanzhang Chen and Jinguang.

This life would be different, but it was still essential to build connections with these key individuals. Though Nanzhang Chen's origins were less than savory, he had died a warrior's death in the end. The He family, who held such a high station at the time, hadn't they just surrendered in the end? Li Suining didn't hold grudges from his past life, but he couldn't help but feel a certain fondness for the man, and his smile was exceptionally warm.

This left Nanzhang Chen feeling overwhelmed. Although he was at the Foundation Establishment Realm, his background made him an outcast in the lake region, unloved and uncared for. The only person he could rely on was Nanzhang Ku, whose own problems were even more troublesome. He had heard that a genius from the main lineage would be ascending the mountain with him and had braced himself for arrogance. This reception was a complete surprise, and he waved his hands in dismissal.

"You praise me too highly, my lord."

Ding Weizeng watched them with a smile. Nanzhang Ku remained at the foot of the mountain as the other three began their ascent.

The mountain path was an ocean of white blossoms piled high on the bright jade steps. Li Suining was composed, but Nanzhang Chen grew visibly tense, his jaw clenched tight. He kept his head bowed the entire way, not daring to look up.

He knelt rigidly before the steps of the summit and called out, "This junior cultivator pays his respects to the Daoist Master!"

The mountaintop was devoid of luxury. A simple table held only a tall white jade teacup and a long-necked white porcelain vase with a glazed pattern, their elegant simplicity complementing each other perfectly.

The Daoist Master was engrossed in a jade slip. He raised the cup, took a sip, and set it aside.

Within the cup, a multicolored light shimmered. A clear, brownish-yellow aura undulated within, surging toward the heavens before converging back into the small porcelain vessel, as if drawing all the colors of the mountain peak into itself. Faint, majestic sounds of chanting scriptures echoed in the air.

With a soft _clink_, the Daoist Master placed the lid on the cup, and all the phenomena vanished, leaving only the tranquil Heavenly Light flowing across the mountain.

This item was none other than the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual extract, Radiant Spirit-Vessel's Glow. Consuming it could aid in the practice of spell arts!

With the Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise in his possession, Li Ximing naturally knew how to use it. One had to maintain the luminance of either the Supreme Yang or the Supreme Yin, ensure a stable spiritual atmosphere, and then brew the extract with a pot of gentle Valley Water, sipping it slowly as it steeped.

The Radiant Spirit-Vessel's Glow was no larger than a quail's egg when dropped into the cup. As the spiritual water was poured in, it began to tumble gently. Li Ximing had steeped it with three pots over half a month, and the extract had only shrunk by a tiny fraction.

Yet in that short time, his practice of spell arts had been a whirlwind of inspiration. Activating and applying his techniques felt more effortless than ever. His Tread on Flames technique, which had been stagnant for years, was now showing signs of loosening, as if a breakthrough was imminent.

'Of course, I specifically set aside time to rest, but the effect of this item cannot be understated… It’s about three to five times my normal cultivation speed. For techniques like Tread on Flames, which is already boosted by the Valley Wind Guide-Fire, the result is terrifying—it can reach nearly ten times the normal speed!'

'What a treasure. It seems it will last for a year, maybe a year and a half… I can use it slowly. On other days, I just need to maintain it with Valley Water.'

If he spent that year and a half entirely on Tread on Flames, it would be equivalent to ten full years of dedicated practice—more than enough to use the technique with ease and hold his own in most fights.

He was in a good mood. After slowly absorbing the last wisp of the Radiant Spirit-Vessel's Glow from his Shengyang Acupoint, he set down the jade slip and finally turned his attention to the three visitors.

"Suining, you've reached Qi Refining!"

Li Ximing nodded with a smile, raising an eyebrow to silence Li Suining’s impending words of gratitude. He then looked to Ding Weizeng.

"Is this the genius from the Nanzhang lineage?"

Ding Weizeng quickly nodded and replied respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, yes!"

He gestured and began the introduction. "He was raised solely by his mother and took her surname, Nanzhang. His mother's family has been close with the Ye clan for generations, so they are quite intimate. It is a rare blessing that they produced a genius such as him."

The Nanzhang bloodline was mixed, containing not only a large portion of Eastern Yue blood but also descendants of old lake clans, numerous outer branches of the former Yu family, and finally, the Situ family. Over the years, the Li clan had intentionally diluted the bloodlines, disrupted ancestral ties, and sent many distant relatives bearing the Ye surname to intermarry. The bloodline was actually quite good now, with no clear lines of patriarchal descent to trace. But the perception of others was not so easily erased. The stigma of being a "remnant clan" was still an unpleasant label.

Li Ximing glanced at the young man with interest. "And he can perform alchemy?"

"Yes!" Nanzhang Chen quickly kowtowed and answered.

Li Ximing gave him another look. "Rare."

There were quite a few people in the lake region who could perform alchemy; even the Li family's direct line had produced one later on. The rarity was not in his ability to practice alchemy, but in possessing alchemical talent without sacrificing cultivation talent. The handful of other Alchemists on the lake were all stuck at either the Embyronic Breathing or Qi Refining realms, making them largely useless.

Li Suining knelt silently to the side, feeling no surprise.

In his previous life, Nantanchen had been the one to take charge of all alchemy in the lake region. Though he failed to gain the trust of King Wei, he received several Classics from Daoist Master Zhaojing. While not an official disciple, he held a status akin to one. His talent was beyond doubt.

Just as expected, Li Ximing's interest was piqued. He began to test him. "What pills have you refined?"

Nanzhang Chen raised his head slightly, his voice steady. "I attempted a trial in the lake region a few days ago. Lord Ding gave me the formula for the Three Perfection Breakthrough Pill. This humble one was incompetent and only produced a single pill from one furnace."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow and looked at Ding Weizeng. The Dharma Protector clasped his hands, presented a jade bottle in his palm, and answered, "I was watching at his side. It was his first time refining it."

Li Ximing didn't take the bottle. A sweep of his spiritual sense was enough. The joy in his heart solidified, and he sighed inwardly. 'Rare indeed! Although he can't compare to me in my youth, this is still first-rate talent!'

Li Ximing possessed Talisman Qi, which allowed him to ignore all difficulties related to fire control, making alchemy far easier for him. The benefits had compounded all the way to the Purple Mansion Realm, becoming more significant with each major realm. It was this ability that had allowed him to single-handedly supply the entire Li family back then, and it was why he could still refine pills with ease as a Purple Mansion cultivator, achieving what others could not.

Nanzhang Chen had no Talisman Qi, yet he had managed to produce a pill on his very first attempt with the advanced Three Perfection Breakthrough Pill. Although the result was just one pill, it was a testament to his exceptional talent. Li Ximing smiled. "Who is his father?"

Nanzhang Chen looked slightly embarrassed. Ding Weizeng spoke up. "He is said to be… from Eastern Yue… the seed left behind by a certain profligate son of the Tian family in Eastern Mountain Yue…"

"Oh?"

The Tian family had been active in Eastern Yue for many years, so such an occurrence wasn't surprising. Li Ximing sat up straighter, his gaze sharp. "Said to be?"

That single phrase sent a shiver down Nanzhang Chen's spine, causing him to bow lower. Even Li Suining felt a tremor of fear. Fortunately, Ding Weizeng immediately responded in a low voice. "This subordinate investigated personally. The matter is true; his father did indeed come from the Tian family. However… I privately asked the Tian Family Head… he refuses to acknowledge him."

Nanzhang Chen was, after all, a Foundation Establishment cultivator. While the Tian family currently lacked a pillar of support, they certainly didn't want one appearing out of thin air to usurp their position. Li Ximing chuckled. "Then let him stay in Nanzhang. There's no need to go back. It's excellent to establish one's own surname. If a few more people like you emerge, Nanzhang's future will be bright indeed. The many surnames of Nanzhang have achieved a profound unity; I will permit you to establish a new surname for yourself."

Nantanchen had waited and waited. Though he hadn't hoped to return to the Tian family, he had feared being classified as a member of the Eastern Yue. He prostrated himself in thanks. Li Ximing casually tossed an alchemy book into his hands and instructed, "Master all the formulas in here. In the future, the responsibility for the lake region’s pills… may very well fall upon your shoulders!"

Overjoyed, Nantanchen took his leave. Li Ximing's tone softened considerably as he turned to Li Suining. "How is your progress with your cultivation technique? You have also read Daoist Master Yuanbian's formation scrolls. What are your thoughts?"

Li Suining answered respectfully, "The Daoist Master's learning is as vast as heaven and earth. This junior can only burn the midnight oil and strive to advance! As for the cultivation technique… its profoundness is beyond my imagination. My cultivation speed… I believe it to be quite slow."

"Although the technique is difficult, you must practice it diligently." Li Ximing rubbed his temples and shook his head with a wry smile. What Li Suining had received was the Qi Refining chapter of the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence; of course its profundity was beyond imagination. He continued casually, "I will be using a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource for my cultivation. It has the effect of aiding spell arts, and when I use it, its efficacy will permeate the mountain, leaving behind some of its mystical properties. You and your brothers… and your elders should all come here to cultivate for a time."

"But the main reason I summoned you concerns the Dao of formations. Daoist Master Yuanbian is bound by certain karmic ties and cannot accept you as a disciple, but studying in his manor is permissible. However, it would require you to leave the lake region and travel to the Eastern Sea."

"The timing isn't right at present. Wait until I have finished with this spiritual item. Let all of you share in its benefits. In a year or so, you can depart."

The words were spoken calmly, but they struck Li Suining like a thunderbolt, leaving his mind blank. 'Go to the Eastern Sea? If I go to the Eastern Sea, how can I monitor the situation of the world? How can I give my secret warnings?!'

A dreadful realization seized him. 'I absolutely cannot go to the Eastern Sea!'

But the Daoist Master’s words, while framed as a reward, were a command. How could he refuse? His mind raced. He immediately dropped to his knees, his voice filled with shame. "The Daoist Master has shown such consideration for this junior, and I am deeply humbled. However… in cultivating my technique this year, I have become keenly aware of my own lack of talent… far inferior to my uncles. Whether it is cultivation or the Dao of formations, if I am to repay the clan… I must first reach the Foundation Establishment Realm."

He lowered his head, his voice cracking. "This opportunity to study was obtained through a debt the Daoist Master owes… This junior does not wish to be half-hearted, waste the chance, and bring shame upon the Daoist Master’s name. I only hope to first achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm here on the lake before considering matters overseas!"

Li Ximing studied him for a long moment, then nodded slightly. 'That's fine too. The Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence is indeed too difficult. It has frightened the child.'

Thus, he said, "Your parents have passed away, and your ancestral line is thin. It is indeed not suitable for you to travel far. You should stay and produce an heir first… to give your parents a proper accounting! I will have the old master find a suitable match for you."

Out of the wolf's den and into the tiger's maw. This time, Li Suining could not refuse. Mortified, he could only grit his teeth and agree. Just then, Li Ximing's expression changed slightly. He looked up. "All of you, leave!"

He raised his sleeve, sweeping the two of them down to the foot of the mountain. A peal of laughter rang out from beyond the mountain's protective formation. 

"Daoist friend Zhaojing! I have come to offer my congratulations!"

Li Ximing didn't have time to reply. He quickly put away the Radiant Spirit-Vessel's Glow from the table and replaced it with ordinary tea. Only then did he call out with a smile, "So it is Daoist friend Sima who has graced me with his presence! Please, come in and we shall speak!"

He stepped out of the formation, only to see three figures standing in the Great Void.

The leader was a man in white robes with a sword at his waist—Sima Yuanli, without a doubt. He held a box in his hands, a smile on his face.

Standing some distance from him was a woman in a light cyan Daoist robe. Her features were gentle, her figure tall and slender. A smile touched her lips, and two strings of blue and white jadeite beads were tied at her waist, accentuating her narrow waistline. She offered a salute and said softly, "Daoist friend Zhaojing!"

"Daoist Master Kuang Yu, what a surprise."

Li Ximing’s surprise was genuine. He looked more closely and saw another person standing behind her.

This man did not look old. His hair was neatly tied in a topknot, his clothes were immaculate, and his expression was placid, giving him an air of great composure. He raised his hand in a formal greeting. "Greetings, Senior!"

Truthfully, this was the first time Li Ximing had been called "Senior" by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. He found it rather comical. Setting aside his confusion for the moment, he smiled. "And this is…?"

Kuang Yu pushed the man forward and said seriously, "This is Daoist Master Nanwu. His Daoist title is not often used these days. Our friends in the Eastern Sea all call him Daoist Master Guo. You may address him as such… we are all family here!"

"Oh?"

To be referred to by one's surname rather than a Daoist title usually implied a prestigious origin. The reputation of the Guo family of Crimson Reef Island was immense, and with Kuang Yu’s mention of the Eastern Sea, Li Ximing immediately became vigilant. He asked, half-convinced and half-skeptical, "The Guo family… Daoist friend, are you…?"

At his words, the newly met Daoist Master Nanwu shook his head repeatedly, a hint of disdain in his expression as he replied with a smile, "I would never dare to cultivate Merging Fire!"
