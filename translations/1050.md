# Chapter 1050: Six Harmonies

The river surged, its waters churning violently. A long, pale-green stone wall, etched with mysterious patterns, stood firm against the relentless assault of the waves. High above on a magnificent veranda, a man in crimson robes gazed into the distance, his expression somber.

Beside him stood a man in black, who appeared more mature and possessed a much deeper cultivation. He wore a polite smile.

"You've worked hard, brother-in-law," he said. "The Changrang Army is now stationed on the bank. You can leave this place to me."

Addressed as such, the man in crimson turned, revealing a face with well-defined features. It was Li Jiangzong, now in charge of affairs, having successfully emerged from his seclusion after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The man in black was Sima Xunhui, the husband of Li Queyi. Since Li Queyi and Li Jiangzong were siblings born of the same father, their bond was exceptionally close, which naturally extended to a warm relationship with Sima Xunhui.

Li Jiangzong sighed. "Then I'll leave it in your hands, brother-in-law."

Sima Xunhui was a man adept at leveraging connections. Whatever his private thoughts, he always managed to maintain harmonious relationships between the various families.

"I visited the lake once, years ago," he said with a warm smile. "I still remember how the scenery of the lake and river are the jewels of Jiangnan. I even fished on the river. Being stationed here now is a true feast for the eyes."

Representing both the Song imperial court and the Sima Family, Sima Xunhui was stationed on the riverbank to guard against any southward advance from the north. Though his forces were not large, their presence helped share the burden on the Li family. Li Jiangzong maintained a courteous tone in response.

"It's the rainy season, so the river is wider than usual. I went out on the water yesterday. The constant clashes these past few years have left many casualties, feeding the fish until they're plump. But their bellies are full of human fingernails. They're inedible now."

Sima Xunhui fell into a contemplative silence. Li Jiangzong then pointed.

"Guest Retainer Ding's ambush was a success yesterday. He brought back another group of captives, including a Zhao general. He's being held in the pavilion. You should go see him."

The two descended the stairs together. Sima Xunhui's expression turned serious.

"This is precisely why I've come! My family's Daoist Master observed him for a long time, intercepting the approaching Maha in the Great Void to finally capture him. We have your clan to thank for your cooperation!"

Li Jiangzong waved his hand dismissively.

More than three years had passed since the great war that had founded the Great Song. On the northern bank, the grand formations had been rebuilt behind towering city walls, garrisoned with heavily fortified troops.

Perhaps the war three years ago had dealt a heavy blow to the north as well. While the past three years had seen considerable friction, with occasional probing incursions by the Merciful One or Maha, no major conflicts had erupted. A fragile peace had settled over the region.

The Li family had benefited greatly from this lull. Li Minggong, Li Zhouda, and others had fully recovered from their injuries, their cultivation and Dao-Profundity showing marked improvement. Li Jiangzong, too, had survived his fated trial of life and death. Yet, a deep worry still clouded his heart.

‘King Wei is injured… From what Daoist Master Qinghu said, it's serious. He'll certainly be out of commission for the next few years. Daoist Master Zhaojing remains in seclusion, and there's been no sign of him. Everything at the lake requires troubling Daoist Master Qinghu. This can't go on forever…’

Li Jiangzong led the way to the highest veranda. Though it was still early, the sixteen lampstands in the plaza were blazing brightly. The doors to the grand hall were shut tight, and two guards knelt before them, their heads bowed in silence.

It was clear someone was already inside. Li Jiangzong calculated the time and understood. He turned back with a smile.

"It seems my father has come to the shore. He's in the hall… This is a good chance for you to meet him."

"So it's my father-in-law!"

Li Zhoufang lacked talent and his cultivation was mediocre, leaving him with little reputation to speak of. But he was, after all, Sima Xunhui's father-in-law. The scion of a Purple Mansion Realm clan straightened his robes and followed his brother-in-law closely. Just as Li Jiangzong took a step forward, the doors to the hall creaked open of their own accord.

His father, Li Zhoufang, was indeed inside, but he stood at the very back of the hall. Flanking the main seat were a woman dressed in red with golden trim, from whom waves of True Fire Qi emanated, and a stout man in brilliant armor with the sharp jaw and fierce whiskers of a tiger. Both stood turned to the side, silent.

In the center of the hall knelt a man with a pale, fierce countenance. His armor was exquisite, but he knelt with his eyes closed, exuding a stubborn defiance.

Though he was clearly a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, his face was smooth and hairless, and his head was completely bald where his helmet had been removed—all signs pointing to him being one of the Buddhist cultivators.

As Li Jiangzong stepped inside, Ding Weizeng immediately cupped his fist in salute.

"Daoist Master Qinghu gave orders not to harm him," he whispered, "but he refuses to speak."

They all exchanged glances, their eyes finally settling on Sima Xunhui. But the cultivator from the Sima Family was just as clueless.

"I'm afraid we must wait for the Daoist Master's command!" he said with a wry smile.

Just then, the entire hall was suffused with a hazy white light, like a gentle morning mist. The stout, tiger-whiskered man collapsed to his knees as if a mountain of gold had toppled.

"Your subordinate pays his respects to the Daoist Master!"

Seated on the main throne, where no one had been a moment before, was a middle-aged man in a white and gold Daoist robe.

His long eyebrows were relaxed above a pair of authoritative eyes, and a brilliant golden light shone from between them. His features were natural and his expression was casual, yet he emanated an aura of inviolable dignity.

'A Daoist Master!'

It was Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing!

Perhaps due to his ever-increasing mastery of divine abilities, Li Ximing looked subtly different from how he was remembered. His features had undergone a slight transformation. Li Jiangzong dared not look too closely, but he sensed that his eyebrows were a little longer, the bridge of his nose more prominent. Though he looked the same, he now possessed a striking and commanding presence.

A surge of joy and apprehension washed over Li Jiangzong. He froze for a second, then pulled back the foot he had placed on the stairs and dropped to his knees with a thud.

"This junior pays his respects to the Daoist Master! Congratulations on mastering a great divine ability!"

While Li Jiangzong had been relatively relaxed in his own family's hall, Sima Xunhui was already on edge. He reacted instantly, kneeling right behind his brother-in-law. A calm voice then drifted down from above.

"Jiangzong, you've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. Good."

Li Jiangzong quickly offered a few auspicious words about the Daoist Master's divine protection. Li Ximing smiled faintly and gestured for him to rise.

"All of you, rise."

Sima Xunhui scrambled to his feet and moved to stand beside the figures at the side. Li Jiangzong swiftly glanced up. Seated in the guest chair, though he hadn't been there a moment ago, was a man in green robes. He didn't dare look at the man's face, but judging by Sima Xunhui's deferential posture, it could only be Daoist Master Qinghu.

Neither of the Daoist Masters displayed any overt power, yet the atmosphere in the hall had become profoundly solemn. Only the captive Zhao general's face flushed red. He raised his head, his eyes burning with hatred, and opened his mouth to shout a curse.

But at that exact moment, Li Ximing, having just accepted a cup from Li Minggong, turned his gaze upon him.

His face was like warm, lustrous jade, the divine light in his eyes softly veiled. He resembled a profound spirit seated within a sacred shrine, the floating white light in the hall like the curtain before it, making him mysterious and impossible to look upon directly.

That single glance caused the Zhao general's expression to go vacant. In an instant, it was as if something invisible swept across his face. The hatred, like a cloud of foul energy, was utterly blown away, vanishing without a trace. He shuffled forward on his knees, his eyes filled with a deep and irrepressible reverence. He began to weep.

"This subordinate greets you, my lord!"

The spiritual locks binding him fell to the floor with a clang. The man stood, then knelt again below the main seat, just in front of Ding Weizeng, blending seamlessly and respectfully into the ranks of the Li family.

For a moment, a chilling silence fell over the hall. Even Ding Weizeng's eyelids twitched, a sliver of cold fear piercing his heart.

Li Ximing gave him no glance. He nodded slightly at Sima Xunhui, and the direct descendant of the Sima Family immediately bowed. Li Ximing took a sip of tea and spoke quietly.

"Speak."

The word was clearly directed at the Zhao general, who answered with utmost reverence.

"This subordinate is Li Ju, a native of the northern mountains. I cultivate under the jurisdiction of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. I followed Maha Vast Cicada south and served in the army…"

Li Ximing's expression grew thoughtful. He looked toward Sima Yuanli. Daoist Master Qinghu nodded, his face grave.

"This year, I observed large-scale troop movements on the opposite bank, all from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. I felt the north was planning something, so I devised a plan to capture one of them… It's a fortunate coincidence that you've come out of seclusion, fellow Daoist. We can discuss our countermeasures."

Li Ximing frowned slightly.

He knew the name 'Vast Cicada', of course. He even knew—from his encounter with Nuxiao and the Merciful One years ago—that this Maha also possessed Wei-Li blood!

'This is not good…'

As he considered this, Sima Yuanli studied his expression and let out a soft laugh, his voice tinged with envy.

"Congratulations, fellow Daoist Zhaojing… Remarkable… truly remarkable!"

He had emerged from seclusion today, his Life Divine Ability, 'World's Radiance', now fully mastered!

A Life Divine Ability held a unique significance for all cultivators in the world. It was not only a shadow that loomed over those of lower cultivation but also a crucial means of perfecting one's status in the Purple Mansion Realm. Now that he had succeeded, he seemed to have transcended the mundane, appearing almost like a different person.

'It truly wasn't easy!' Li Ximing thought with a surge of emotion.

The cultivation of a Life Divine Ability was heavily dependent on one's Dao-Profundity and destiny, making it incredibly difficult. For Li Ximing, the challenge had been even greater. This period of seclusion had lasted five or six years, and he had come dangerously close to failure.

'I was too hasty… Although I refined pills every year and grew more proficient in the Bright Yang Dao, my Dao-Profundity was still a step behind… If not for that portion of Soul-Listening Purple Intent Qi, which perfectly compensated for this weakness… I would have failed again!'

Currently, Li Zhouwei's Dao-Profundity was just shy of a Great Daoist Master's. When Li Ximing had entered seclusion, his own was merely that of an ordinary early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Many Daoist Masters with far greater Dao-Profundity had failed to master a Life Divine Ability, let alone someone like him.

But with this single success, his Dao-Profundity had advanced considerably. He felt a profound sense of relief and triumph, as if a great weight had been lifted. He raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"Just a bit of luck…"

Sima Yuanli shook his head, sighing with admiration.

"I wouldn't say that. First, your clan's destiny is strong. Second… you are brilliant, fellow Daoist. My own elders have advised that if one cannot achieve the Dao through a Life Divine Ability, one should, if their talent permits, make it their second divine ability. After all, they become harder to cultivate later on. Making it third is even more difficult. To wait until you encounter the Purple Mystery to practice a Life Divine Ability… that's practically asking for trouble!"

Sima Yuanli felt a genuine pang of envy. His own Dao lineage was well-defined, and a Life Divine Ability was now the foundation of his Dao, yet he had absolutely no confidence in mastering it. The situation was urgent, however, and he couldn't afford to stagnate. How could he not be envious seeing Li Ximing overcome such a monumental hurdle?

Li Ximing listened to his words with a faint smile.

With this divine ability mastered, the world he saw was entirely different.

Spheres of profound light, like luminous pearls, hung above everyone's head. They varied in color and brilliance—some were bright and full, others dim and withered—each corresponding to the person's Spiritual Qi cultivation. This was the world as perceived by 'World's Radiance'.

In other words, everyone in the hall was under the sway of his Life Divine Ability. In fact, its influence extended beyond the hall, covering everything within the range of his spiritual sense.

The wonders of this Life Divine Ability were divided into two main parts. The primary function acted upon Li Ximing himself, described in the texts as: ‘Born of the sacred, foundation of kingship, master of the Six Harmonies, balancer of heaven and earth, companion to gods, interrogator of the cosmos.’

This aspect was linked to his personal Dao-Profundity, influence, and status. Once activated, it would bestow the blessing of 'World's Radiance', manifesting a 'Light of the Six Harmonies' that could impose binding edicts and dispel calamities.

This 'Light of the Six Harmonies' was intrinsically tied to 'World's Radiance' and deeply connected to his Dao-Profundity in the Bright Yang Dao. Besides its use in combat, it could also be used for divination and seeking the Dao—to "balance heaven and earth, interrogate the cosmos."

Beyond the Light of the Six Harmonies, the secondary functions highlighted the unique nature of a Life Divine Ability.

If one were to compare a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to a mortal, 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' would be a sharp weapon, and 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' would be a suit of armor. In contrast, this aspect of 'World's Radiance' was like one's appearance, strength, bearing, and fortune—intangible qualities.

This divine ability was not something to be activated or retracted like 'Audience with the Celestial Gate'; it was more like a natural elevation of his own being.

'World's Radiance' didn't cover a physical area so much as it permeated the web of power and relationships within a faction.

This divine ability governed promotions and demotions. Those he favored and protected would receive the grace of 'World's Radiance', causing Heavenly Light to manifest within their sea of Qi, which would in turn fortify their righteous thoughts and illuminate their true nature.

Through this mystical connection, he could command absolute loyalty. It allowed him to instantly sense any dissent or resentment from subordinates like Ding Weizeng and Qu Bushi.

If he sensed such feelings and grew angry, a mere verbal rebuke could strip them of their cultivation. For those at the Qi Refining or Embyronic Breathing stages, it was trivial. He could even demote a peak Foundation Establishment Realm expert like Ding Weizeng to the mid-stage with a single sentence, erasing decades of hard work in an instant.

Furthermore, the 'Light of the Six Harmonies' had a corresponding power. A gentle sweep of the light could befuddle a person's spirit, causing them to forget themselves completely and follow his every command as if it were a sacred edict.

'It's not as if they are reborn as a new person, like a monarch's reincarnation… but unless another Purple Mansion expert's special Life Divine Ability breaks the spell, the person will remain loyal to my instructions until they die! Over time, their own will would be completely lost… Even if another Purple Mansion cultivator intervened, they couldn't be saved.'

At the same time, as the culmination of the Bright Yang arts, 'World's Radiance' could resonate with 'Audience with the Celestial Gate'!

When 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' was used, it would summon a host of golden-armored soldiers from the heavens. These summoned soldiers possessed only the strength of Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment cultivators and had little more than basic combat instincts. Without a special technique from the Wei Kingdom, they were useless against a Purple Mansion Realm expert and could be wiped out in a single breath.

But this was where the 'companion to gods' aspect of the 'Light of the Six Harmonies' came into play. A single touch of the light would vastly increase the intelligence of the golden-armored soldiers. If his Dao-Profundity reached a sufficient level, he could even use the Light of the Six Harmonies to merge the divine abilities, creating a golden-armored immortal general capable of fighting other Purple Mansion Realm experts.

'This… must be a manifestation of the Wei-Li Celestial Dynasty's arts!'
