# Chapter 705: The Shifting Spiritual Aura

"Father!"

Li Zhouluo looked up from his desk and saw the man standing in the doorway. Surprise and delight washed over him as he hurried down from the main seat to greet him. "Father! You're out of seclusion!"

Li Chenghuai smiled and nodded. Li Zhouluo, his face flushed with excitement, led his father to the seat of honor. "Congratulations, Father! This is wonderful news!" Overjoyed, he momentarily forgot his worries. "You've established your immortal foundation! A fourth-grade one at that... and with the Dharma robe Grandfather left you, you'll surely soar like a great roc!"

Li Zhouluo was well aware of the complicated history between his father and grandfather, but having recently met Li Xizhi, he had been captivated by the man's charisma. He felt a sense of shared glory and even saw him as a role model, so he was quick to put in a good word.

But Li Chenghuai was not one for pleasantries. He seized on his son's earlier distraction, his gaze sharp. "A clan brother, you said? Which one?"

Li Zhouluo had no choice but to bow and explain. "It's about Que'wan... Someone in the prefecture has accused her brother of using her influence for personal gain..."

"Let me see."

Li Chenghuai took the letter from his son's hand. He glanced at it, noting that both parties were involved in the shipping business, then flipped through the documents Li Zhouluo had prepared. A scornful laugh escaped him, and he slammed the papers down on the desk with a sharp crack.

"What utter nonsense!" he scoffed. "This is 'abusing influence'? That's 'abusing influence'? By that logic, we might as well lock up every cultivator's family in a formation and raise them like two-legged pigs!"

Li Zhouluo had rarely seen his father so furious. "Father," he said quickly, "there's more to it... If I simply suppress the matter, it will only serve as proof and harm Que'wan's reputation..."

"Of course I know there's more to it!" Li Chenghuai sneered. "What are they saying behind her back? That she was just lucky, that she stumbled into good fortune when an elder passed by the prefecture? I'll bet the people jealous of her could line the shores of the entire lake! All this scheming instead of focusing on their own cultivation. Pathetic!"

Li Zhouluo didn't dare say more.

"Have him come in," Li Chenghuai commanded.

Li Zhouluo sent for the accuser. Soon, the sound of footsteps approached, and a middle-aged man in fine brocade robes entered. He saw Li Zhouluo and bowed with a smile. "Greetings, my lord!"

His father was still sitting silently behind him. The man's friendly tone sent a shiver down Li Zhouluo's spine. He quickly stepped aside, remaining silent.

The middle-aged man froze, his eyes finally landing on the figure in the main seat. He recognized Li Chenghuai at once, and a flash of pure terror crossed his mind.

'He reached Foundation Establishment?'

"Li Dongti greets... my lord!"

"So it's you..." Li Chenghuai squinted, recognizing the man as a member of a relatively close branch family. "I hear Li Que'wan's brothers have been throwing their weight around. Is there any truth to this?"

Li Zhouluo, though intelligent, was still young and lacked his father's cunning. But at this point, there was no turning back.

Li Dongti understood his predicament. If he stuck to his story, he might face punishment, but to show weakness now would be a death sentence. "It is true!" he cried out in a sorrowful voice.

As he watched from the side, Li Zhouluo saw his father dip an index finger in ink. With a speed that was nearly invisible, his finger danced across a sheet of paper, tracing a talisman.

The moment Li Dongti finished speaking, a dull *thump* echoed in the hall. The paper burst into brilliant flames and burned to ash.

"The audacity!" Li Chenghuai's voice was ice.

In a single step, he closed the distance and slapped the man across the face. The force snapped Li Dongti's head back, sending a spray of blood and teeth across the floor. Before he could fall, a backhand caught him on the other cheek, sending him flying.

Li Zhouluo was horrified, afraid his father might kill the man. "Father! Father, mind your hand!"

Li Dongti tumbled several times before coming to a stop. It took him a long moment to recover. He prostrated himself on the ground, mumbling incoherently, "My lord... how can you... enforce the law... like this..."

"Like this?" Li Chenghuai flicked his sleeves. "No need for theatrics. My immortal foundation can discern truth from falsehood." He paused, a cold smile touching his lips. "You... and the rest of you cowards hiding in the shadows... can all prepare for disaster."

**Azure Pond Sect.**

The grotto-heaven on the highest peak of the Azure Pond Sect faced east, a place where the essence of the sun and moon gathered amidst ethereal white clouds. It was the most spiritually dense location in the entire mountain range; the ambient spiritual qi was so thick it seemed perpetually on the verge of condensing into dew on the grass and trees.

Li Ximing waited on the immortal peak for only a few moments before a clear laugh rang out. An elder in azure robes appeared at the mountain gate. He looked vigorous, holding a golden talisman in his hand. "I was wondering which esteemed guest had arrived," he chuckled. "It's Zhaojing!"

That Li Ximing had come to see him first instead of Xiao Chuting was a great compliment to Daoist Master Yuanxiu. It put him in an excellent mood. Sensing from a distance that Li Ximing was waiting respectfully before the gate like a disciple, he lifted his chin, his laughter growing heartier.

Li Ximing returned the smile. Once the elder was close enough that others couldn't hear, he bowed. "This junior greets the Daoist Master! Zhaojing was able to break through in peace largely because Daoist Si Yuanli blocked the demonic cultivators and secured the northern territories of Yue. I am deeply grateful!"

Yuanxiu quickly waved him off. "My friend, what are you saying?" he said, his aged voice full of laughter. "Yuanli is your junior. There's no need for such formality. Besides, it was Li Xuanfeng who turned the tide on the river... Yuanli was merely doing his duty."

Yuanxiu was an old fox, after all. Li Ximing was just glad he had waited until he was close to speak quietly.

"Please," the old man said, gesturing.

The two Purple Mansion cultivators proceeded into the grotto-heaven. Inside, the spiritual qi was so rich it dripped like dew. A massive pool of Pristine Water, shimmering like a sheet of emerald, dominated the space. A potent wave of Pristine Water power washed over them, causing Ding Weizeng, who followed behind, to grimace in discomfort.

Above the pool hovered six magnificent thrones carved from green jade. The dense spiritual energy, mixed with the light of the Dharma, created an almost tangible, iridescent glow that illuminated the entire cavern.

Countless Pristine Water cultivators had likely broken through in this very place. Yuanxiu gestured for them to be seated, but he did not take the main throne himself, instead choosing the highest one to the side.

Li Ximing used his divine ability to shield Ding Weizeng from the oppressive aura of the Pristine Water and took a seat on a lower jade throne. He was about to speak when he paused, his expression shifting. Above him, Yuanxiu also stopped, then let out a cold sneer.

"Qingtangyin of Mount Changhuai has fallen! The old miser was stingy to the very end! He wouldn't even invite guests to witness his Golden Core breakthrough... The old ghost!"

Li Ximing immediately understood. The Profound Light between his brows pulsed faintly. "The spiritual aura has changed!" he said in surprise. "It's too early... The era of the Upper Evil Spirit Storage should be at its zenith..."

The smile vanished from Yuanxiu's face, replaced by his usual stern demeanor. "Early is hardly the word for it," he said, shaking his head. "Zhaojing, have you not noticed? The Upper Evil Spirit Storage has been laughably weak. Forget demonic cultivators... it hasn't even given rise to any special spiritual lands or treasures..."

'I've been in seclusion day in and day out,' Li Ximing thought wryly. 'What could I possibly know about any of that?'

Outwardly, he maintained a faint smile and nodded slowly as the light between his brows flickered. "Indeed..."
