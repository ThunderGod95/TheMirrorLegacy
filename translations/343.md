# Chapter 409: Settling

"Yu Xiaogui is dead."

Li Yuanjiao had heard many rumors and lived through the death of his family's ancestor. With a quick glance, he instantly grasped the situation at hand.

The two families had a blood feud, and Li Yuanjiao, feeling no sorrow, sighed in relief that the turmoil was finally settling.

"Fei Wangbai fell to an unknown swordsman. He fell with just a single attack... Yu Xiaogui met his end at the hands of my granduncle, armed with only a Huashang Fruit and his Qingche Sword... It took just a single strike too. The Three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of the lake are now all dead..."

The Azure Pond Sect would not ease its grip on prestigious clans just because their Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had fallen. The tributes that were due would still be demanded under the guise of honoring past legacies. These families would still be labeled a prestigious clan for another fifty years so that the sect could drain all their remaining resources before discarding them for good.

Should a few more Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators emerge in the Li Family or annex additional territories, their required tributes would undoubtedly increase, mirroring the substantial offerings made by the Yuan Family, who paid far more than the Li Family.

The scene of Yu Xiaogui's death was strikingly magnificent, with jade scattered all across the ground. Li Yuanjiao observed in silence, then left the cave to survey the Yu Family's territory for a while.

Under the Yu Family's governance, conditions had significantly improved over the years. Now, at least, their subjects led decent lives. Despite Yu Mugao's sinister and brutal nature, his bold reforms to the clan system and his elevation of commoners not born into the family all led to positive progress.

Understanding the situation, Li Yuanjiao put away the mirror. As the familiar stone wall of his cave dwelling came back into view, he murmured, "Chi Buzi's visit has indeed unsettled my family... The long-term consequences of it are still unclear."

The day's events had caused frustration to accumulate within him. Li Yuanjiao took the Qingche Sword from its place and started practicing his sword techniques.

It was not until he had practiced for half the day that he felt the mounting pressures begin to dissipate, and he sensed a slight improvement in his skills.

Sitting cross-legged, he began to clean the sword. At that moment, a man in brown robes and a jade crown approached, his face breaking into a broad, respectful smile.

"Clan Brother! Clan Brother! Good news!"

It was none other than Shamoli. Despite being older than Li Yuanjiao, he had learned the ways of the world and preferred addressing Li Yuanjiao as his clan brother with familiarity.

"Clan Brother! There's good news from Lijing! Daoist Master Chuting has appeared in Mount Yu and vanquished dozens of devil cultivators lurking over there! He has already returned to Xianyou Peak... The devil cultivators in the Xiao Family's territory have scattered, fleeing in all directions!"

Xiao Chuting has returned!

Li Yuanjiao silently sighed in relief, a smile breaking across his face.

With Xiao Chuting in command, the Xiao Family's plight will be solved... My family will be safer as well.

With that in mind, he patted Shamoli's shoulder and replied, "That's indeed good news! Keep watch for a while; I'll cultivate in seclusion now."

Shamoli then nodded and silently withdrew.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

As news spread, the cultivators on the mountain breathed a sigh of relief and the crowds at the foot of the mountain rejoiced. They did not understand the intricacies of the struggle but knew that the Xiao Family backed the Li Family. Hence, the return of such an important figure was naturally a cause for celebration.

The generation of Yuan and Qing, who held important positions across various mountains and towns, were elated too. Having returned to Lijing to report on their duties, they gathered in Li Yuanping's central hall to offer their congratulations.

The generation of Yuan and Qing originally numbered over ten, but now nine remained. Excluding Yuanjiao and Qinghong in the mountains, and Yuanping who managed family affairs, most of them were Li Xuanxuan's concubine-born children.

There were four sons and two daughters‚Äîthe eldest was thirty, and the youngest just over ten, each holding a significant role within the family. Two among them possessed spiritual orifices, though their talents paled in comparison to even Li Yuanping's and were nearly indistinguishable from mortals.

"Greetings, Family Head!"

This group, representing nearly half of the Li Family's worldly influence, gathered in the hall. Li Yuanping greeted them with a warm smile and helped his siblings to their feet.

Their unruliness during Li Yuanxiu's reign had completely vanished. Everyone had a warm smile on their face and was devoted to the family.

It was not that Li Yuanping was better at leading the family than Li Yuanxiu; it was rather because his siblings had married, settled down, and started families of their own.

The distinction between those with spiritual orifices and ordinary mortals was profound. While it was challenging to produce heirs with such rare traits, these siblings endeavored to conceive them, aiming to nurture children as remarkable as their father, Li Xuanxuan.

According to the Li Family's rules, concubine-born children from the major sect identified with spiritual orifices by the age of six could be sent to the mountains for training. With their precious children cultivating on the mountain, the parents naturally shifted their allegiances to become staunch supporters of the main lineage.

This was a strategy Li Yuanping understood well. By boldly promoting key positions, he eased his own burdens considerably. Over the years, his warm relationships with his brothers had greatly strengthened their bonds.

With a laugh, he chirped, "Although this is good news, all of you shouldn't have gone out of your way to make this trip."

After exchanging pleasantries, the group pushed forward a man with a broad, round face‚Äîthe eldest son born to Li Xuanxuan from a concubine. After some extended conversation, one of them said, "There are still untapped talents within our family, talents that have been overlooked and underutilized by the clan... We've come to bring them to your attention, Family Head!"

"Oh?"

Li Yuanping's interest was instantly piqued.

The man continued, "These two brothers are the sons of Master An... They are also part of the Li Family."

He motioned, and two teenagers, about thirteen or fourteen years old, stepped forward. Dressed in cloaks with their hair neatly tied back, they wore gold bracelets on their wrists and had round faces with dark eyes.

Both bowed formally as they greeted him respectfully.

"An Siwei greets the Family Head!"

"An Siming greets the Family Head!"

They were the only children of An Zheyan and Li Feiruo. The siblings both possessed spiritual orifices and had attained the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm by the ages of thirteen and fourteen!

However, their aura seemed unsteady, indicating they had only recently achieved this breakthrough. Nevertheless, their progress still astounded everyone.
ùëìùëü‚ÑØùò¶ùìåùò¶ùò£ùëõùëúùìãùëíùìÅ.ùëê‚Ñ¥ùìÇ

Li Yuanping studied them intently and suddenly exclaimed in surprise, "Both of you... are cultivating the

Guardian of the Courtly Path technique?!"

Both brothers nodded, prompting Li Yuanping to secretly sigh in relief.

No wonder they've advanced so quickly... The Guardian of the Courtly Path is known for accelerating progress in the Embryonic Breathing Realm while slowing Qi Cultivation; but it's impressive nonetheless.

Although they can't match An Jingming's progress at fourteen, they're still better than many of our external cultivators. Not just the Chen Clan, but their speed also matched even those in my family who have received a talisman seed!

He shook his head and stated firmly, "Given your current level of cultivation, I don't have any responsibilities for you."

The other siblings and the An brothers were dismayed upon hearing Li Yuanping's statement. Li Yuanping, however, continued, "I'll write a letter to find a cave dwelling on Mount Huazhong for you two to focus on your cultivation so you can swiftly achieve the Qi Cultivation Realm... The clan will have significant duties for you by then!"

"Yes!"

The brothers readily responded, clearly elated upon hearing this.

Li Yuanping immediately wrote the letter. The An brothers accepted it and respectfully withdrew.

Meanwhile at the Xiao Residence...

Xiao Chuting broke through the void and descended lightly atop Xianyou Peak. The water in the cold pool was crystal clear and icy as usual. Sitting down, he gazed at a mountain rock across the bank, lost in thought.

Battles of wit had left him exhausted. As Xiao Chuting settled on the rock, he was suddenly reminded of his dead elder brother, Xiao Chuchou.

The brother, with whom he had discussed current events and changes in the world by that pool for years, had been consumed by him and transformed into one of his half-realized divine abilities.

Xiao Chuting knew in his heart that even if he had not consumed Xiao Chuchou, his brother's days were numbered due to his old age. Xiao Xianyou had orchestrated everything masterfully, making the best use of every resource.

There's no turning back...

Devil cultivators had wreaked havoc, and Xiao Chuting ensured that those of the Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realms on Mount Yu Qi met their ends in both miserable and humiliating ways.

Despite his efforts, he could not pursue the demon cultivators who had fled to the Purple Smoke Gate for revenge. Instead, he was left to vent his frustration by eliminating just a few of their masses.

The land of Jiangnan was exceptionally fertile with deep earth veins enriching it. Planting a few seedlings guaranteed a bountiful harvest the next year. Although tens of thousands had perished on Mount Yu, the population would flourish again within a few generations, much like crops. Therefore, the losses sustained by the Xiao Family were relatively minor.

Despite his many successful schemes over the years to turn small investments into large profits, the old man's face remained gloomy. He could never quite satisfy his ambitions. Silently, he picked up his white jade fishing rod and began to fish.

After a long while, a messenger arrived, announcing that Xiao Guitu, the family head, had come to pay his respects to the old ancestor.

Xiao Chuting hummed in acknowledgment. Xiao Guitu quickly ascended the mountain path, dressed in casual clothes. With a happy look on his face, he said respectfully, "Junior Guitu greets the Daoist Master!"

"Hm."
ùíáùôßùôöùìÆùîÄùìÆùíÉùô£ùì∏ùíóùíÜùíç.ùôòùíêùíé

Xiao Chuting gave him a brief glance and asked, "Chi Buzi looked for you?"

Xiao Guitu bowed and replied, "With the protection of the dharma artifact from the old ancestor, I didn't fail too badly before the Daoist Master of Azure Pond. However, I was still influenced by his divine ability. I also asked Guiluan regarding the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Li Family."

Xiao Chuting shook his head gently and replied, "That's fine. Chi Buzi has since returned to the Azure Pond Sect after visiting Moongaze Lake... We don't know if he was injured, but he had likely retreated hastily after being warned by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Li Family."

Xiao Guitu nodded thoughtfully, then asked, "What of Mount Dali's demon den?"

Xiao Chuting remained silent for a moment before responding evasively, "Send someone to the South Sea to fetch Xiao Yuansi, so Guiluan need not wait any longer."

"Understood!" Xiao Guitu replied and respectfully withdrew.

Xiao Guiluan had stayed with the Xiao Family at the foot of Xianyou Peak for just over half a month, reconnecting with old acquaintances to gather information about Mount Yu.

Her father, learning it involved the Xiao and Li Clans, adamantly refused to meet with Li Qingxiao.

Yet, with dozens of Spirit Stones presented, the door that was once closed suddenly opened, transforming formal strangers into eagerly welcomed guests.

Xiao Guiluan was not surprised by his father's greed and spitefulness. It seemed that with the right incentive‚Äîparticularly an expensive gift and Xiao Guitu's tacit approval‚Äîa door once closed could indeed be opened.

With Xiao Guitu's clandestine support, arrangements concerning Mount Yu proceeded smoothly, and Xianyou Peak even dispatched a few guest cultivators to stabilize the situation.

Good news continued to arrive. While Xiao Guiluan wondered how much longer she would have to wait for Xiao Yuansi to return to Xianyou Peak, she received news of his imminent return.

Perhaps Xiao Chuting's presence allowed for the reallocation of resources, facilitating Xiao Yuansi's reassignment from the South Sea.

Xiao Guiluan quickly sought an audience with Xiao Yuansi, who readily accepted. Subsequently, Xiao Guiluan entrusted an alchemy furnace to Li Ximing, asking him to remain with the Xiao Family, then bade farewell and departed.

Upon her return to Li Residence, she learned that Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong, the Li Family's main pillars, were cultivating in seclusion. Understanding that the family's situation had stabilized, she was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Two years swiftly passed. Li Yuanjiao had been waiting for news from the Azure Pond Sect, but heard nothing nor did their Purple Mansion Realm cultivator appear in the sky as he feared. Day and night, he wondered if the Immortal Official managed to deceive the sect. With no catastrophic developments, he finally felt a measure of relief.

The devil plague had also diminished, no longer presenting the collective threat it once did while it was ravaging several prefectures. Now, the scattered devil cultivators spread malevolence throughout the Yue, Wu and Xu States, leading to a steady stream of smaller, yet more frequent disasters.

During this period, some devil cultivators infiltrated the Li Family's territory. Thanks to the family's thorough and detailed household registration system, these invaders were quickly discovered after harming just one or two people. These Embryonic Breathing Realm devil cultivators proved not particularly formidable and were easy to eliminate.

The Li Family's sacrificial ritual that took place every five years was approaching once again. With Chi Buzi's blood beads, the preparations this time were even more elaborate. Access to Mount Dali was heavily restricted. Li Qinghong, having emerged from her seclusion after advancing to the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, was tasked with the preparations of this ritual.

The Li Family now boasted a plentiful number of Qi Cultivators. However, due to the secretive nature of their sacrificial ritual, seeking external assistance would necessitate fabricating an elaborate tale. Therefore, the main family opted to undertake the task themselves, starting with a search around Moongaze Lake.

The bottom of Moongaze Lake shimmered. Dark waters flowed, swirling up clouds of gray silt. Li Qinghong and Li Yuanjiao stood in the water, their mana light deliberately dimmed to blend with the underwater shadows, waiting patiently.

Li Qinghong's jade armor, an heirloom of the An Family, was enchanted with a Water Avoidance Spell, providing her comfort in the water. Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao's mastery of the River One Qi Technique enabled him to navigate the water as naturally as a fish.

Moongaze Lake was deep and teeming with demonic creatures that had already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. After two months of meticulous searching, the pair finally encountered a catfish demon of no significant background.

Glug, glug...

As the distant waters rushed in, Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong exchanged a knowing nod.

Suddenly, they spotted a beast swimming swiftly through the dark waters, as large as a hut, with its long whiskers flinging about. It opened its massive mouth to gulp water, swallowing several times before spitting out bone fragments.

Large, flat forehead... Sticky, slippery saliva... It's definitely a catfish demon.

This catfish demon, only at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and with a poor bloodline, lacked significant legacy and intelligence. However, it excelled in water control and swam swiftly. Once startled, it could dart away instantly, making it nearly impossible for the duo to catch up to it underwater.

Beneath the lake, demonic creatures of the Foundation Establishment Realm lurked, and this particular catfish demon, with its low intelligence, roamed the waters haphazardly. Should Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong inadvertently stray into the territory of another demon general, it could spell trouble for both of them.

Li Yuanjiao racked his brain for a while before deciding to rent a Qi Cultivation Realm water-aligned formation plate known as the Muddy Water Talisman Flowing Formation from the Yuan Family. While the catfish demon foraged, he set up the formation in its lair and waited.

As the catfish demon blundered forward, Li Yuanjiao activated the formation. A blue light rippled open instantly and a greenish-blue barrier emerged from the lakebed, seamlessly merging with the water, isolating the area completely.

Startled, the catfish swiftly turned and shot out like an arrow, only to collide with the Muddy Water Talisman Flowing Formation and causing the entire formation to shake slightly.

Since the catfish demon's skin was thick, it showed no reaction of pain. After a moment's pause, it attempted to flee again in a different direction.

"It's done!" exclaimed Li Yuanjiao.

This demon, inexperienced in battles with cultivators and unfamiliar with formations, panicked. At that moment, Li Yuanjiao drew his sword and advanced.

Buzz...

His bright white sword qi sliced through the lake, leaving two long waves in its wake. The catfish demon responded by expelling water from its mouth, which transformed into multi-layered shields.

This spell was primitive, typical of a wild demonic creature with scant mana. The arc from Li Yuanjiao's Celestial Moon Slash technique cut through the water shields and pierced the catfish demon's body, creating a small gash.

Despite its large size, and tough scales which had mucus and mana protection, the sword arc managed to still pierce through and damage the demon's scales and bones. Writhing in pain, the catfish rolled on the lakebed.

As Li Yuanjiao raised his sword to strike again, Li Qinghong quickly interjected, "Brother, your sword qi is too powerful, I fear you might accidentally kill this demon. My thunder techniques are better suited for capturing it alive. Shall I take over?"
