# Chapter 518: Returning To Qingdu

"I see," Li Yuanjiao murmured.

Back then, Kong Tingyun did not use a single spell to deal with Wushao. Although Profound Peak Gate may not match Azure Pond, she should have one or two spells as a direct descendant. She must have been wary of me and did not use her full strength...

After Li Xizhi had finished explaining, he glanced at his younger brother and said, "This should be the Kui Light spell we got at home. It's perfect for Eighth Brother's cultivation path and will be even more effective when you reach the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

Although Li Xijun was defeated in just a few moves, he did not show any frustration. Instead, a spark of curiosity crossed his face.

"Brother Zhi! What are the limitations of your spell?"

"I was just about to share," Li Xizhi nodded with a small smile as he elaborated, "Heavenly Glow excels at both striking and snatching. Excluding direct lineage secret legacies, Floating Light Gathering ranks among the best in Azure Pond. However, the effectiveness of this spell relies on the opponent's sword cultivation and the quality of the sword they wield."

"If you could unleash sword essence or wield a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, it would have been challenging for me to snatch your sword," he explained.

He paused, glancing at Li Yuanjiao, and continued, "If it were the Qingche sword, not only would I fail to take it, but I might also end up with my fingers cut and bleeding profusely. Additionally, if the sword's intent is still sealed within, I'd likely lose my cultivation along with two pieces of my flesh."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, feeling significantly reassured by this information, and asked, "What if an Azure Pond Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator casts this spell?"

"Well, it's a sword that belonged to the Sword Immortal, so it should be quite difficult to take," Li Xizhi replied.

He thought for a moment, then added, "But the tactics of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator are unpredictable, and we don't know their spell's grade. It could likely still create a disturbance, affecting the opponent's swordsmanship."

"I see," Li Yuanjiao replied thoughtfully and then asked, "Has Yu Muxian practiced this spell?"

Li Xizhi understood the concern in his question but replied respectfully, "I have no idea..."

Li Yuanjiao resolved seriously, "Then I hope I can keep the sword intent within the blade, in case one of my descendants is talented enough to comprehend it and become a sword immortal. At the very least, it can be used against Yu Muxian instead of being wasted..."

Li Xizhi sighed internally, bowing to his father as he said, "I have also been keeping an eye on Yu Muxian... He's been quietly refining dharma artifacts in the sect this year. But he's a genius, and he has already... broken through to the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

As expected...

Li Yuanjiao showed no surprise. He pressed his lips together, remaining silent.

His son continued, "Fei Qingyi, the female disciple of the Fei Family who trained at Yuanwu Peak, has broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and mastered the Ni Water Pure Rite technique. She is well-liked by Yu Muxian and loyal to him. If this continues, it could spell trouble for us."

"Hmph!" Li Xuanxuan frowned, his anger palpable.

"The Fei Family hasn't sent anyone to visit in years! They've likely forgotten how my second uncle saved their family with his sword and liberated Glacial Cloud Peak!"

Li Yuanjiao remained unfazed and replied softly, "This is how the world operates. The Fei Family is defending Fei Qingyi, and there's nothing we can say about it. We can only focus on our own matters."

Li Xizhi cupped his fist slightly, refraining from responding. He then hurried to change the subject, sharing details about the creation of the dharma artifact with Cheng Jinzhu. After a moment of thought, Li Yuanjiao took out a piece of blue-and-white ore from his storage pouch and asked, "Is this Ni Water Cold Iron suitable for crafting that dharma artifact?"

"Oh yes, now I remember," Li Xizhi replied, realization dawning on him, "Yes, of course. This will reduce some costs... When it's finished, I'll have someone send it home."

Li Xizhi implied that he would cover the expense of making the dharma artifact. Li Yuanjiao studied him for a moment before saying, "I'll leave it to you then. When I return home, I'll have someone send the cold iron here."

Li Xizhi nodded and said, "I'll try to gather some news about Situ Mo in the market and report back to the family. Please take care of Huai'er..."

He glanced at Li Chenghuai in his grandfather's arms, showing a hint of reluctance in his eyes. Rolling up the hem of his feathered robe, he searched his pockets but could not find anything to leave for the child.

In the end, he could only blurt out a single sentence.

"I'll choose one or two dharma artifacts and send them home for him later."

"Of course," Li Xuanxuan replied, still cradling his grandson tightly.

Li Yuanjiao added, "Your mother also gave you a younger sister in your absence. She has already condensed her Profound Scenery Chakra. Her name is Li Yuexiang, and she shows promising talent... I'll send her to visit you soon."

"What?!"

Li Xizhi was taken aback, unable to hide his surprise. He smiled wryly and thought to himself, So much for complaining that I didn't write to you when my wife gave birth to Huai'er! You didn't even bother to tell me I have a younger sister! And she's probably already seven or eight years old now...

Despite grumbling internally, he was delighted by the news. Of course, he dared not talk back to Li Yuanjiao and merely responded politely. Li Xuanxuan beamed with pride, mumbling something about 'like father, like son'.

After bidding their farewell, they fetched Kongheng from the side yard and set off into the night.

Li Xizhi escorted his family out of the prefecture and when he turned around, the two old men approached him with fawning smiles.

Resuming his courteous yet distant demeanor, he asked, "Does the Golden Tang Gate run any business in the market?"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Yuanjiao and his group did not linger, hastily departing on the wind. As they headed west, he worried that Situ Mo might be lurking in the shadows while they were flying out in the open. He glanced at Kongheng and asked, "Master Monk, Situ Mo is likely colluding with Buddhist cultivators in Zhao State to plot against us. You're a Buddhist cultivator of true Dao lineage, do you know of any way to protect us? I don't expect us to remain undetected, but I would like an early warning if those in Zhao State manage to deduce our whereabouts."

"Benefactor..." Kongheng replied, looking a bit ashamed.

"The methods of Zhao's Buddhist cultivators and their power of deduction with the support of Maha's power surpass my own. I can only rely on my Dao lineage to protect myself from their schemes and deductions... There's little else I can do..." he sighed dejectedly.

"No need to blame yourself, Master Monk," Li Yuanjiao reassured him. It had been a casual question, yet Kongheng's kindness stirred feelings of shame over his own perceived incompetence.

Li Yuanjiao nodded thoughtfully.

At least they can't deduce Kongheng... there's still some room for maneuver.

The group rode the wind until they reached the vicinity of Moongaze Lake, finally allowing themselves to breathe a sigh of relief. Mount Qingdu was peaceful. Its grand formation was intact, and the territories under their rule seemed tranquil, basking in the sunset.

Li Yuanjiao exhaled, and a young man in black flew over from the distance. It was Li Wushao, who had sensed their approach through their spiritual connection. He cupped his fist in greeting, landing respectfully before them.

"Wushao greets Master."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly as Kongheng excused himself and returned to the island where he stayed. Li Xijun and Li Xuanxuan descended on the mountain together.

Li Qinghong flew out to meet them, clad in her jade armor and carrying a spear behind her. As soon as the siblings met, they fell silent, though both were eager to share their updates. They eventually took turns recounting what had transpired during each other's absence.

"Zhang Yun? Zhang Huaide?" Li Yuanjiao asked skeptically.

Since Zhang Huaide was from the Zhang Family and seemed to have significant background resources, the Li Family had long suspected him to be a disciple of the immortal sect who had veered toward the devil dao. Now, with Zhang Yun personally protecting him, those suspicions were confirmed.

"Yes, it seems that the Golden Feather Sect was not only involved in the devil plague, their Purple Mansion Realm cultivator also closely monitored the incident, and even sent their own direct disciples to manipulate the devil plague in their territory," Li Qinghong remarked.

"That's to be expected. After so many years in the Golden Feather Realm, the treasures accumulated by the clans are certainly tempting. Moreover, the prominent clans have already monopolized the Golden Feather's cultivation and secret techniques, and they've long been eager to eliminate any competition," Li Xuanxuan replied with a small sigh.

"Aside from Golden Feather and Azure Pond, several of the other seven gates, such as Changxiao and Purple Smoke, have pushed disciples who have little hope of making further progress to pursue the devil dao. While they may not dominate the situation, they can certainly still benefit from the scraps," he added.

Li Qinghong then continued, "Since Zhang Yun's departure, those devil cultivators have grown increasingly bold, capturing cultivators throughout the barren mountains. It's not just our family; I heard that the Shen Family, an immortal clan in the Yue Cultivating Sect bordering the northern barren mountains, had also sent people here... They must have been forced back by Zhang Yun."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head as he gave a word of caution.

"Don't worry about them... just avoid provoking them."

Li Qinghong nodded in agreement before taking out a jade box, smiling as she presented it.

"Look at this!"

Li Yuanjiao took the box and scanned its contents with his spiritual sense. It was a red fruit wrapped in dark gray leaves, beating like a heart.

His expression shifted to one of delight as he remarked, "This is Blood Sun Fruit... Luken is truly efficient! Xizhi happens to be in Libu Prefecture right now; let him take this to the Foundation Establishment Realm alchemist."

Li Yuanjiao stored away the treasure carefully. With that, the matter was finally settled. Li Xijun still seemed concerned about the wound on his wrist and reminded Li Yuanjiao to rest. Upon hearing that, Li Qinghong also urged him to return to his cave dwelling for proper rest.

Li Yuanjiao acknowledged their advice but headed to Li Yuanping's courtyard instead. He intended to take medicine and delay his seclusion for another year or two so that he could keep Li Yuanping company.

However, when Li Yuanping heard that he was injured, he closed his door and refused to meet Li Yuanjiao.

Unable to overcome the insistence of his siblings, Li Yuanjiao reluctantly retreated into seclusion to heal his wounds.

As Li Xijun flew toward the mountain's peak, he spotted a girl of about eight or nine standing on a rock. Dressed in white, she squinted against the sun, a smile illuminating her face as she called out, "Brother!"

"Xiang'er!" Li Xijun replied with a warm grin.

Li Yuexiang resembled her mother, Xiao Guiluan, with her fine eyebrows and phoenix eyes. Even at a tender age, she exuded grace. Though still a child, she carried herself with the maturity expected of a teen.

She twiddled her thumbs nervously and said, "Father only came to see me once, then went into seclusion again..."

As the only girl in the Xi and Yue generation, Li Yuexiang was cherished by her elder brothers. However, her mother, Xiao Guiluan, had raised her with discipline, instilling a sense of humility in her. The frequent and prolonged absences of her father only heightened her unease.

Li Xijun sighed, fully understanding the situation. Many privileged children were born into clans where their parents were already Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. To these parents, what seemed like a brief period of seclusion often resulted in them emerging to find their children had already become teenagers. After yet another period of seclusion to polish their cultivation, they would realize their kids had grown into adults in the blink of an eye.

"In truth, Brother Xizhi and Uncle Jiao also don't see each other often. Both of you are raised by your mother... Your father has a lot of responsibilities to the family. You must be understanding..." Li Xijun assured as he gently consoled the girl who looked like she was about to cry.

At this point, Li Yuexiang had already begun her training as an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. Taking her hand, Li Xijun distracted her, smiling as he said, "I brought you a little nephew. How do you think your mother will feel about him?"

Li Yuexiang pouted, saying glumly, "He's just another one who can't see his father..."

Li Xijun could only respond with an awkward smile as he led her up the mountain.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

At Lake Xian's estuary...

Clad in a golden robe, Situ Mo rode the wind on golden light with a grim expression. He flew along the riverbank, hands clasped behind his back while remaining silent.

The demonic creatures lurking in the river below saw the brilliance above and fell still, too intimidated to even move. Situ Mo's expression darkened even more as thoughts raced through his mind.

What a missed opportunity! The Li Family will be on high alert now, making it even harder to deal with them. Catching them off guard like this is a rarity... Who knows when the next chance will arise?

While he was lost in his thoughts, a yellow light erupted from Lake Xian, revealing a muscular monk with a clean-shaven head and a flushed body. His fierce gaze bore down on Situ Mo as he exclaimed, "Situ Mo! What have you done? This is a disaster! It's absurd!"

Situ Mo's expression darkened, and he retorted through clenched teeth, "Better than you, old man! You're too scared to even show your face! That pathetic Wrathful Dao lineage you cultivate should be called the Cowardly Dao lineage instead!"

"Watch your mouth! The Wrathful Dao lineage isn't some cowardly Dao lineage! I've been deducing for three years... The Li Family has too many ways and secret tricks up their sleeves! Although they don't dare to kill you, they could strike me down with some talisman or sword!"

Situ Mo sneered, but he did not deny it. He had indeed hidden a lot of trump cards up his sleeve too. He simply laughed and mocked, "You can only blame your Wrath Dao lineage for being torn apart. How many even remember Maha's death and are actually seeking revenge? If they cared, a little Master Monk wouldn't even be here in the first place."

"What do you know?! Nothing is more important than preserving the Dao lineage! When someone ascends to the position of Maha again, it will be easy to capture the Li Family!"

Situ Mo paused, realizing that the monk had made a valid point. He cast a wary glance at him and then shouted, "If that's the case, why are you messing around in the south?!"

The big monk chuckled with a fierce glint in his eyes.

"Since the Li Family killed the Maha, perhaps the key to ascending to that position again lies within them... What's wrong with giving it a try?" he asked.

The expression on his face suddenly darkened again, returning to its wrathful form as he reprimanded, "Do not question me! Besides, I explicitly told you to kill only Li Xijun, bring his body back, and leave that monk alone! Why did you set up an ambush and ruin the entire plan?!"
ùöèùï£ùêûùó≤ùê∞ùïñùêõùêßùï†ùïßùöéùöï.ùêúùöòùó∫

A sinister expression crossed Situ Mo's features as he replied, "What use is Li Xijun? If we're going to kill, we should take out Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong instead!"

"You're making a mistake! What do you know? Clans fear nothing more than a lack of successors. Killing Li Xijun, even if he's injured, would cause more anguish than seriously wounding Li Yuanjiao! If we crippled Li Xijun, the Li Family will resent us for fifty or sixty years and could even risk their downfall!" the monk yelled out furiously.

Situ Mo fell silent but was sneering inwardly.

You think I don't know that? Monks like you are good at deducing. If I were to simply kill him, the cause and effect would be settled instantly. Would you still stay around and help me if you deduced that this wouldn't help your breakthrough to Maha? You'd just wash your hands of this and walk away... Where else would I find a capable ally who isn't afraid of the Li Family?

If I'm going to kill someone, I need to aim high!

The monk continued berating him but failed to vent all his frustration. In the end, he only asked, "How long will it take you to return this time?"

"Probably ten years..." Situ Mo replied, giving him a troubled look, "The Profound Peak Gate has sent a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to oversee things overseas. She is rather formidable... I think her name is Kong Tingyun. I have no choice but to deal with this situation."

He widened his eyes and continued coldly, "It would be best to find a chance to eliminate her, so we won't waste time... I have to stir the pot too. We can't let Profound Peak and Golden Tang be on friendly terms again..."
