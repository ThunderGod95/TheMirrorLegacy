# Chapter 803: The Peacock's Old Affairs

‘Tinglan is still looking for me…’

Li Ximing doubted Tinglan cared that much about him. Ten to one, she was just anxious to use the pills and worried he would vanish into seclusion for another decade.

‘After all, I’ve already read the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill formula, the Profound Peak Gate affair is settled, and she took the Purple Mansion Realm formation. Now that she has the materials, she’s too embarrassed—or finds it too difficult—to ask anyone else to refine it...’

He sat down with the two cultivators.

“I promised Daoist Friend Tinglan we had important matters to discuss,” Li Ximing explained, covering for the alchemy. “I was gone for several years and delayed things, so she came looking.”

Houfu just nodded and poured tea. Lingdu, however, was quite enthusiastic. The old man smiled.

“Zhaojing’s alchemy skills are profound. Perhaps she wants you to refine pills. In any case, it’s a good thing. We previously thought Zhaojing was severely injured and in seclusion, so we only put in a token effort to search. Now that we see you are safe and sound, I’m not sure how to reply to her.”

Lingdu clearly wanted no part in Purple Smoke’s affairs and was using one sentence to ask Li Ximing for a clear answer. Li Ximing understood his intent.

“There's no need to trouble Senior with messages. When I am free and return to Jiangnan, I will naturally find her.”

Although Tinglan was from the Green Pine Dao lineage, the Great Xiukui Monastery was no slouch either, being a former subordinate of an immortal estate. Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain was overseas. None of the factions had any incentive to curry favor with her; it was purely a matter of personal relationships. Since no one here was exceptionally close to Tinglan, the matter was dropped.

Li Ximing took the opportunity. “I spent several years healing in the Eastern Sea and have no news from Jiangnan. I wonder what the current situation is...”

Houfu disliked idle talk, perhaps worried that explaining too much would lower his status. He sipped his tea silently. Seeing this, Lingdu replied:

“Zhu Gong entered Shanji Prefecture and established a new mountain gate called the Sacred Writ Gate, another Profound Enterprise lineage. That noble, Li Zhouwei, fled to the sea. I heard they lost someone who cultivated lightning.”

Li Ximing’s gaze dropped. He set the teacup down and unconsciously wiped his hands on his robes. “Oh... haih...”

His buoyant mood from recovering his injuries instantly plummeted, replaced by an empty hollowness.

‘Li Chenghui left no bloodline... This is all my fault. My planning was insufficient. He should have been a pillar suppressing the clan's destiny, but because of my lack of foresight, he was killed so carelessly.’

The family only had so many pillars, and only a handful were selfless. Li Ximing knew exactly who they were. Grief and sorrow washed over him. It was a testament to his control that he didn't lose his composure, but for a moment, he truly couldn't speak.

Lingdu was experienced and saw at a glance that Li Ximing had lost a prized junior. He shook his head slightly.

“Whether it’s clan inheritance or bloodlines, it's all the same. Out of ten juniors, six are mediocre, three are useless profligates, and the one who shows promise has to drag the other nine along. That’s bad enough... but the more promising they are, the more we push them into danger to train them.”

“We masters and elders all hope that one outstanding junior will be the one to turn the tide in a crisis. If they perish achieving that, it's a worthy death. But more often than not, it doesn’t happen that way. It's the abrupt, accidental deaths that leave a tightness in your chest, a strength you can't use... just bitterness and rage!”

He stamped his foot.

“When I was young, I had a junior with excellent talent and an honest temperament. If he were alive today, he would have reached the Purple Mansion Realm. But he went on a routine trip to a market in the surrounding seas, and in one careless moment, he died in a woman’s bed. He didn't even use his talismans or protective treasures.”

“We investigated later. You couldn’t even blame the kid for being stupid. The woman was just a rogue cultivator. He wasn't manipulated by some supernatural art; it was purely love turning to hate. She just hated him for being a philanderer. It just shows that even for elders like us who have mastered divine arts, when someone's luck runs out... we can't save them in time.”

Hearing this, Li Ximing said quietly, “Senior speaks the truth. My family also has a romantic. It isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as they are clever. It's just that his talent wasn't high, making his future even more difficult.”

Of the three, only Houfu was young and childless, and the Great Xiukui Monastery wasn't his problem to worry about. He should have been carefree, yet his brow furrowed at the topic.

“Daoist Master Cao only worries about his own descendants. He doesn't know the anxieties of our sect lineages. You can’t divide the inheritance equally. Not only do the disciples below hate their martial brothers, they start to hate you. Our thirty-six peaks have more than fifty factions, all busy promoting their own relatives. It's more than a tangled mess. In the years I've been cultivating, the disciples beneath me have already split into six cliques.”

The two offered a word of comfort. Li Ximing tactfully composed himself. Houfu glanced at Lingdu, and the elder from the Nine Mounds lineage finally spoke, smiling.

“Since Zhaojing is here, it must be destiny. Zhaojing, you fought Changxiao... is your Dharma body well? Did you happen to see the silver bottle?”

Lingdu and Li Ximing weren't particularly close. Asking about a Dharma body was taboo. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with a worse temper might have stormed off. But the other party's faction was powerful, and Li Ximing had a calm demeanor. He only frowned.

“It still has some damage. I saw the silver bottle. It is extremely formidable.”

Lingdu's voice grew grave. “The Mirrored-Mirrage lineage is powerful. Since you were struck by that bottle, Zhaojing, you must not return to Jiangnan anytime soon... Changxiao will detect you.”

Li Ximing's heart pounded, his pupils dilating slightly.

‘Why didn't I notice anything?!’

Li Ximing had suspected early on that Changxiao’s divine art left a mark, but he hadn't found the slightest trace... and he had specifically used the Immortal Mirror to check!

‘Impossible... Something is amiss. How could it evade the Immortal Mirror? That insidious bastard probably guessed I had a way to detect it and deliberately held back... feigning and probing...’

Lingdu glanced at him. “We few lack ocular arts and cannot see clearly. However, my Nine Mounds lineage possesses a Shade-Cleansing Pool that can cleanse a Dharma body...”

He paused briefly, his meaning becoming obvious.

“However, there is a matter I was hoping to discuss.”

Li Ximing looked up slightly. Lingdu said softly: “Purple Mansion Realm spiritual fire... I wonder if Zhaojing is interested?”

Li Ximing’s heart leaped, but his expression remained neutral. “Oh? Which type might it be?”

The highest-grade Dharma Art of the Li family was undoubtedly the sixth-rank Great Radiance of White Brilliance. This technique had strict requirements: it needed the Purple Mansion Realm Radiant Fire to practice. Li Ximing had coveted it for a long time. Now that he asked, Lingdu seemed caught off guard.

“I do not know which one it is... In short, it is neither Molten Fire nor Blazing Fire.”

Having just escaped a perilous situation, Li Ximing was hesitant. “Perhaps you could elaborate.”

Lingdu nodded. “Zhaojing has likely heard that something happened at the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour. There is unrest everywhere. Before our Great Daoist Master left, he speculated that a Merciful One from the temple must have perished.”

Li Ximing was confused about this. This Great Daoist Master of Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain was a dignified late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, equal in strength to Maha. He had no need to placate the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour, yet it sounded like he had been summoned.

“The Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour certainly carries itself with prestige.”

Lingdu immediately caught his meaning. “Years ago, the Peacock ancestor of the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour had connections with our lineage. The previous Temple Master also rendered a great service to our Mountain Lord. He is bound by sentiment to look after the Peacocks...”

“No wonder!”

The Peacock Sea was clearly suppressed by Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain, yet the place was teeming with peacocks. It was rare for Immortals and Buddhists to have good relations. Li Ximing had been suspicious.

Lingdu continued, “Thus, with a Merciful One perishing, he had to go, both for logical and personal reasons. The Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour has four Merciful Ones. One has fallen, one must report to the Buddhist Pure Land, and another must host the Great Daoist Master. That leaves only one free.”

“The item we mentioned is in the Peacock Sea. It is an inheritance left by an ancestor of the Dantai family, deeply related to the Peacocks. It was discovered many years ago, but we feared that any disturbance would force us to split it with the Peacocks. Given his personal ties, the Great Daoist Master couldn't possibly support us, so we never made a move. Now is the perfect opportunity.”

Li Ximing mostly understood. He rubbed his teacup for a moment but didn't agree, smiling instead. “Since it is a treasure of the Dantai family, where do I come in?”

Lingdu paused slightly. “First, the formation is difficult to break. Second... that Merciful One will likely sense us and come. We will be below retrieving the item, and we need Zhaojing to block him for a moment.”

Now Li Ximing understood. Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain didn't want to tear face with the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour. They needed an unrelated person to take the blame. The price was the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual fire from the inheritance.

‘It's possible... before I arrived, they were planning to make Houfu the villain. They were just discussing it. Then I suddenly showed up. These two figured that after the Wei-Li incident, I wouldn't fear offending some Buddhist cultivators... so they're using a spiritual fire to push me out front.’

Li Ximing didn't dare believe this was truly left by a Dantai ancestor. But at the least, the two of them spoke of this inheritance as if it were their own backyard, which meant they were confident. Li Ximing was hesitating when Houfu suddenly spoke:

“Zhaojing, if that Merciful One comes, Senior Lingdu cannot face him. Regardless of whether you or I step forward, that Merciful One will fight relentlessly. If we duel and our identities are exposed, it’s trouble. Why don't we step out together? Two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators should be enough to intimidate him into retreating. We won't even need to fight, which reduces the risk of exposure by ninety percent.”

Houfu had the Great Xiukui Monastery behind him, so his words carried weight. This proposal was much more comfortable. Even if something went wrong, Houfu would be there to share the consequences. Li Ximing was tempted. He specifically asked:

“Is the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour backed by the Way of Compassion or the Way of Emptiness?”

“It is the Way of Compassion.”

Li Ximing relaxed slightly.

His grand-uncle, Li Xuanfeng, had killed eighteen Master Monks of the Way of Emptiness by the river, destroying a great destiny for that line. If this thing had even the slightest connection to the Way of Emptiness, Li Ximing wouldn't touch it. Pondering this, he nodded.

“We can try it.”

“Excellent!”

Lingdu nodded, smiling. “We must trouble Zhaojing to cultivate on the mountain for a time. We will finalize the preparations. When the time comes for it to appear, we will call you. Afterward, we will ask Zhaojing to meet the Great Daoist Master and proceed with the cleansing.”

Ultimately, Li Ximing decided he needed the cleansing to ease his suspicions. The three poured tea, acknowledging each other, and the matter was settled.

***

Moongaze Lake.

The bright moon dominated the lake, its light rolling across the sparkling waves. Around the shore, beams of white Dharma light frequently took flight, speeding toward the central island, heading first to the central hall. After a brief stop, they would shuttle toward the rear halls.

At the head of the main hall still sat a man in black robes, a writing brush in hand. Three years had passed, but Li Zhouluo's face hadn't changed much. He merely handled the petitions with much swifter action, his expression no longer the 'facing a great enemy' look of the past.

He quickly set the brush down and glanced at the sky. It was only midnight.

Ever since Li Xuanxuan had announced the three-year inspection, Li Zhouluo's workload had visibly shrunk.

Those prefectures and peaks that used to submit petitions for every trivial matter had suddenly grown brains, cleverly including their proposed solutions in the reports. Those clan members from certain branches who had been dead as pigs, relying only on connections, suddenly came alive, running diligently about the island every day. The clan members governing the outer territories abruptly became selfless and incorruptible. Meanwhile, the main branch members touring the periphery suddenly became fountains of strategy, spotting corruption at a glance and indignantly exposing waves of dirty officials, resulting in the downfall of a Dou family member.

‘Such diligence...’

Li Zhouluo suddenly realized he barely had to lift a finger. Even disciplining a few external families prompted a crowd of indignant clan members to lead the charge. All of this was good, naturally, except that the Qingdu cultivators had grown slightly cold. Although still respectful, they lacked their previous warmth.

He understood that his handling of the Li Chengpan affair three years ago had been poor. The status and power of the Qingdu cultivators were based on the need for those in authority to suppress the main branch. His favoritism had been too obvious, turning the matter into a confused mess. Later, he proactively established the 'legacy shelter' system, which naturally made it hard to win their affection.

‘But... none of that matters...’

Li Zhouluo firmly remembered Li Xuanxuan's words: *Do what you can with the power you have.* He was just here to earn enough goodwill before stepping down. Thinking this, he felt much better.

He pondered a moment. A man in plain robes was waiting nearby. Li Zhouluo finally noticed him and smiled.

“Uncle Chengpan, how are matters in the west?”

This was the same Li Chengpan from back then. The 'blood petition' incident had nearly forced him to imprison the Qingdu contingent. Although the investigation later cleared things up—with only a Li Hun being found guilty—Li Zhouluo could no longer use him in an official capacity, making him an assistant in the hall.

Li Chengpan bowed. “Everything is in order. This year's harvest from the spirit mines has been turned over to the clan.”

Li Zhouluo sighed softly. Calculating the time, the legacy inspection wasn't far off.

‘The old master said to grant the legacy shelters early. Let them be happy for a while, lest Jiangqian starts playing the bad cop the moment he comes out. That would be too obvious...’

The current spiritual atmosphere was Inward Heart Surging Profundity, which favored Fire-virtue. Li Jiangqian's seclusion definitely wouldn't last long. This matter couldn't be delayed.

Just as he was thinking, a clear breeze seemed to pass through the courtyard, slowly revealing a figure. It was a middle-aged man in a black, feather-like robe, a two-foot-long ink-jade pendant at his waist. His brow ridges were slightly high, and his eyes held a hint of a smile.

“Father!”

Li Zhouluo startled, rushing down the steps, overjoyed. “You've come out of seclusion!”

Several years had passed. Li Chenghuai's cultivation had stabilized further, a pure, thick gray brilliance circulating in his hair. His features weren't striking, and his Untraceable Presence technique concealed his immortal foundation, making him appear even more unremarkable. He nodded lightly.

“The ancestral sacrifice is approaching, and the family needs someone to oversee the situation. I estimated that Jiangqian was also about to emerge, so I came out. I toured the island. The family is quite lively, and the atmosphere is good. You've done well.”

Li Zhouluo knew exactly why this was, and felt ashamed. He lowered his voice. “Father... you misunderstand...”
