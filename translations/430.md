# Chapter 576: Two Arrows

Li Yuanjiao glanced over the letter, his expression relaxing as a slight smile appeared at the corners of his mouth. Tucking the letter into his robe, he didn't say much, but turned to Zong Yan and asked in a quiet tone, "How have the island's finances been over the past few years?"

"After covering expenses, we have a surplus of only two spirit stones... as for construction, formations, and rewards... those cost even more..." Zong Yan took out the records, looking a bit embarrassed. Located in such a remote area, Zongquan Island had little income in recent years, though the population had grown. If they counted the costs of formations and spirit paddies, the island had actually operated at a loss.

The Li Family hadn't expected any major returns from this outpost in the Eastern Sea, simply wanting a foothold there. Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and replied, "No matter."

As they were talking, the dark clouds outside the island parted, and a variety of fish and turtles swam through the open space. A creature with a fish's face and bird-like wings descended outside the formation and called out, "Humans below, open the formation at once."

"It is Huiyao," Zong Yan said with some tension.

Li Yuanjiao waved a hand and replied, "Let him in."

With that, he returned to the main hall and took his seat. Before long, Huiyao entered—a creature resembling a black carp. Huiyao had once accepted both bribes and threats from the Li Family to conceal certain offerings.

Now, Huiyao had transformed his form, appearing with a fish face, a human body, and scaled wings beneath his arms. As soon as he entered, he announced, "Li Yuanjiao! So you have finally come out of seclusion! Something big has happened!"

Having read the letter Li Qinghong sent, Li Yuanjiao had a general understanding of the situation. Sipping his tea, he asked, "Oh? Does the Dragon Son of the Zhunan Water Palace have kinship with that fallen demon king?"

Huiyao paused, realizing that this person had his own background. Rubbing his hands together, he shook his head. "Not kin, exactly. Our faction never saw eye to eye with the demon king's. You have stayed in this remote place for so long, and now you finally have a chance to return."

Li Yuanjiao wasn't particularly interested in the internal politics of the dragon clan. Frowning, he asked, "Are you saying... this situation will affect us here? You are planning to return with the Dragon Son?"

Huiyao shook his head, a trace of envy flashing across his face. "I have not even reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, where would I get that kind of good fortune? I am just accompanying a few higher-ups from the palace back. When we leave... there may well be a new master appointed here."

Li Yuanjiao gave a slight nod. Huiyao then lowered his voice and continued, "But for now, with no one governing the seas, it is a prime opportunity for us to expand... I hope you could lend a hand..."

He added in a fawning tone, "If we gain higher status within the palace... it will be easier to help our allies, will it not?"

Li Yuanjiao understood immediately, but he had no desire to be used as a pawn by this demon. Shaking his head, he sighed, "I have an assignment at the moment, so I fear I will not be able to assist."

Huiyao added, "Oh, there is still plenty of time... It is only a rumor for now. When the time comes, all you need to do is join forces with me to kill a few demons, and that will be the end of it... My Hui clan... will certainly offer generous thanks."

Li Yuanjiao glanced at him, nodding noncommittally as he thought, When the family needs talisman qi, perhaps it will be worth considering.

Pleased, Huiyao took his leave, riding the wind in high spirits. Li Yuanjiao then turned to Kongheng. "Master Monk, could I trouble you to guard the island for a few days? I need to travel outside."

He planned to visit Splitreed Island but didn't give specific details. With arrangements made, he stepped off the island and flew northward on the wind.

Converging Sea.

When Li Xuanfeng spoke, Zhong Qian's face lit up with joy, and he nodded, bowing deeply. The initial shock he felt gradually eased, replaced by a sense of confusion, "Could it be that even the Devil Gate has such righteous individuals? Not only does he not want my precious herbs, but he also does not ask for compensation! And he is going to slay that demon..."

Having grown up in the Eastern Sea, Zhong Qian was naturally wary, always prepared to humble himself or bow if needed, but rarely trusting anyone as truly honorable. He thought to himself, But this man's aura is overwhelming, and he doesn't seem to mean me any harm. I'll just have to wait and see what he does... as long as he doesn't catch me off guard... I still have a chance to escape with this ancient talisman in my hand."

While he pondered, Li Xuanfeng finally spoke, his voice calm, "Come with me. Let us go meet them."

"Yes!" Zhong Qian had no choice but to obey. As he exited the formation and looked up, he saw that the dark clouds overhead were spreading out unimpeded, and he couldn't help but exclaim in alarm, "Senior, the island's protective formation is not active. That demon can sense my aura—it is likely already on its way."

"That is exactly what I want." Li Xuanfeng replied casually, stepping down the stone stairs.

Yuan Huo'e and several others waited respectfully at the foot of the mountain. Seeing the additional figure behind Li Xuanfeng, they dared not ask questions and instead greeted him in low voices, "Greetings, Daoist."

Zhong Qian noticed the respectful expressions on the faces of the market's attendants and realized that the man beside him was not only powerful but also held a high reputation within Azure Pond, with a prestigious status. He silently wondered, Could he be from the Chi Family?

Before he could think further, Li Xuanfeng approached the attendants, shook his head, and said, "This demon is coming for him. When the fighting begins, protect him."

Yuan Huo'e didn't fully understand, but as Li Xuanfeng had come on the Daoist Master's orders, there was undoubtedly a reason. He didn't dare question it, only nodding and respectfully replying, "Understood!"

Li Xuanfeng then looked back at Zhong Qian and said quietly, "This demon must hate you deeply. Stay with these men, and do not leave the formation."

Hearing this, Zhong Qian finally believed him. There was no way Li Xuanfeng would go to such lengths just to play games with him. Cupping his fist, he said, "May I know Senior's name?"

"I am Li Xuanfeng, under Daoist Master Yuan Su." As soon as he finished speaking, a massive wave surged in the distance, moving closer with the sound of thunderous roars.

Li Xuanfeng looked toward it, standing with his hands behind his back, and remarked pointedly, "The domain of Azure Pond is vast; it is not like the Eastern Sea where one claims land by occupying islands. The structure differs greatly from that of the Eastern Sea—there are distinctions between family clans, immortal peaks, and Daoist Masters that should not be generalized."

Zhong Qian responded thoughtfully, "It sounds similar to the Dragon Palace's structure... I am enlightened, Senior."

Rain began to fall in a light drizzle. Nearby, Yuan Huo'e appeared increasingly uneasy. This water ape was a late Foundation Establishment Realm demon, and if Li Xuanfeng struggled or, worse, perished here, it would spell disaster for him.

The pressure from Yuan Su, the Ning Family, and the Li Family was no small matter. After a moment's hesitation, he finally steeled himself and sent a message through a secret technique, "Daoist... this demon is no small threat... Why not return what it seeks, make peace with both sides, and let the matter pass?"

Li Xuanfeng shook his head. He appreciated Yuan Huo'e's cautious suggestion, as the two clans had some rapport, and he replied kindly through the same secret technique, "The Daoist Master sent me to eliminate this demon."

Yuan Huo'e immediately understood, nodding as he retreated and respectfully saying, "If the Daoist needs anything, a call will bring us to the fight."

Li Xuanfeng gave a slight nod, not underestimating the demon's power but mindful that, with Yuan Su's instructions in mind, he had to handle this task alone first. He didn't dismiss Yuan Huo'e's offer of assistance outright.

After only a few breaths, a white light appeared in the distance, drawing closer. It was indeed a massive water ape, its fur white with a metallic sheen, large enough to rival a building, with eyes as big as carriage wheels glowing a deep crimson.

The water ape was a strange sight—its white fur glinted with metallic tones as it surged forward on the waves, holding a massive pillar in its hands that looked like a formidable dharma artifact. Landing at the edge of the island, it roared, "Old Yuan! You finally came to your senses... Not bad, not bad. Now, let me come down and take a look..."

The water ape's voice rolled like thunder, reverberating above the island. Zhong Qian felt a tremor of fear, yet his eyes fixed on the middle-aged man before him, who finally drew his bowstring.

Swish!

From his quiver, an arrow leaped nimbly upward like a golden phoenix, obediently fitting itself onto the string.

In that instant, everyone felt a prickling chill on their backs, as if their skin were being sliced by knives. The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators managed to withstand it, but Zhong Qian stumbled back several steps, his lips cracking and dripping red blood. His face felt as if it would bleed, and he was inwardly terrified, By the heavens... this Daoist wasn't bluffing! That bow... that arrow...

Beside him, Yuan Huo'e was equally startled, frozen in shock for several breaths before realizing he needed to shield Zhong Qian. Both self-doubt and awe swirled in his mind, How could I have been so foolish? How could someone favored by a Daoist Master be anything but formidable? With such mastery over the bowstring, there is likely no one else in the entire Yue State who could match him...

Li Xuanfeng, fully focused, was oblivious to the reactions around him. His bowstring held steady, a gleaming golden arrow aimed skyward. With a calm release, he shouted, "Strike!"

The brilliant golden light vanished in an instant. Li Xuanfeng drew his bow once more, slowly rising on the wind to adjust his angle, squinting at the distant target.

The water ape, still basking in its own arrogance, hadn't finished speaking when the island's great formation blazed into action again. Startled, the water ape stomped furiously as though being toyed with, roaring, "Yuan Huo'e! You—"

Before the ape could finish its angry tirade, pain tore through its left eye, and it shouted in shock, "How dare you! How could..."

"Argh!" The water ape barely had time to raise a defensive light over its face before the arrow exploded with a thunderous blast. The massive demon let out an earth-shaking cry, sending seawater crashing upward as clouds scattered in all directions.

Buzz.

A slender thread of golden light shot back to its origin. The water ape recoiled rapidly, clutching its left eye as blood poured down like rain from the sky, dripping steadily.

Zhong Qian wiped the silver-white beast blood from his face. The rain of blood that followed was blocked by the formation that had sprung up around them. He heard Yuan Huo'e beside him marvel, "With just one strike... that old demon has already lost an eye..."

Looking up at the golden streak soaring across the sky, Zhong Qian felt for the first time a hazy glimpse of what mastery over weaponry truly meant. Excitedly, he remarked, "Everyone says weapon mastery falls short of immortal techniques, and immortal techniques are inferior to divine abilities... But now, it seems... it is not that weaponry is lacking—it is that those wielding them fall short!"

"Hahaha!" Yuan Huo'e laughed heartily, shaking his head. "This Daoist comes from a Family of sword immortals... though he is but one of their younger generation. If you had been born a few decades earlier and witnessed the likes of Li Tongyao the Celestial Moon Sword or Li Chejing the Qingsui Sword... that would show you the peak of weapon mastery! Even..."

Yuan Huo'e paused, reminiscing. Though he had never witnessed these figures himself, he had heard enough stories to last a lifetime. Watching the battle unfold in the sky as though admiring a fine scene, he recounted the tale of the sword that once cleaved Maha.

This story was widely told in Yue State, though lesser-known in the Eastern Sea. Those around listened in wonder, utterly amazed.

Above the market.

Li Xuanfeng's archery excelled in suddenness, with speed and immense power, often yielding effective results in just one strike. He wasn't surprised that his first arrow had injured the careless demon. Riding the wind, he pursued.

The demon, now wounded, had only a dark, empty socket where its left eye once was, while its remaining eye glared with anger and visible shock, still shouting, "How is this possible! Who are you? How dare you! I am..."

At that point, the ape's expression changed, and its massive form began to shrink rapidly, deflating like a balloon. The water ape spat out several mercury-jade tokens, dull and pale, which spun protectively around it.

Buzz!

The second arrow streaked through like a meteor, shattering the mercury-jade token in front of him. The water ape let out a frenzied roar, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

An Immortal Foundation technique? Impressive! Li Xuanfeng cast a glance at the arrow as it obediently returned to his quiver. The mercury-jade token was a specialized spell crafted with Immortal Foundation energy; the arrow hadn't pierced the water ape directly but had instead shattered the token before returning.

It has the flavor of a substitute-death spell... Li Xuanfeng had battled countless demons in the Southern Border and was familiar with all manner of strange demon techniques. Unfazed, he drew his bow once more, releasing two arrows in quick succession.

The water ape, which had spent years refining its five mercury-jade tokens, was horrified that one had been shattered so quickly. In panic, it recited incantations to cast spells, but the golden arrowlight came at it once again, forcing it to raise the remaining tokens in defense.

Boom!

The power of this arrow was not as overwhelming as before, only bursting in a flash before him. The water ape, gritting its teeth through the impact, suddenly paused, then broke into a grin. "So he cannot use that attack too often! Almost had me fooled!"

Just as the water ape prepared to recall its defensive spells, it was stunned to find that the clear light and protective energy before it had spread and was now forcefully pushing its spells aside, trapping them in an eddying vortex like mud.

Buzz!

Terrified, blood dripped from the water ape's ears and eyes. A sharp pain tore through its abdomen as a flash of golden light streaked by, opening a fist-sized wound that oozed silvery blood.

He's trying to kill me! He really means to kill me! This isn't just intimidation or a warning! Realization finally dawned upon the water ape. From the very start, it had fallen completely out of sync, losing its usual rhythm in combat. Coming alone to this island, it had played directly into its opponent's hands, responding to strength with its own weaknesses. It had taken two arrows from an unknown powerhouse, and its strength was already halved.

The water ape excelled at stealth, underwater movement, sea control, and spell manipulation—all these skills, along with its eighteen secret arts and demon-control talismans, had been rendered useless, leaving it with significant injuries.

The water ape was well-connected and understood the significance of what it was facing. Seeing that someone from the Azure Pond Devil Gate was determined to take its life, it muttered, "Master... the Master cannot even protect himself... has given up on this old ape... no wonder... no wonder..."

Activating its Immortal Foundation to the fullest, it began to fade from view, disappearing into thin air, yet its spirit was utterly crushed. Feeling hollow and icy, it looked at the figure before it, a man clad in black-gold armor whose face was obscured. A mixture of pain and a deep, cold despair filled its heart. "Today, this old ape... shall meet its end here!"
