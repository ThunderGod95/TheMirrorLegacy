# Chapter 407: Departure

The object, neither talisman nor seal, flipped and hovered slightly before condensing into a small bluish-gray orb that emitted flashes of mana light. It was easy to tell at first glance that it was no mundane artifact; it was the very treasure Li Yuanjiao remembered his family had discovered in a cave dwelling.

"I see... This was that person's last resort."

Chi Buzi recognized it instantly. After observing it briefly, he took a moment to chastise himself for his earlier greed. Who would have guessed that the Supreme Yin Moonlight was a lure set by that old schemer?

Suppressing his greed, Chi Buzi thought to himself, This old thing is probably an ancient monster by now... I shouldn't rush things and coax out his secrets first. Maybe within them lies my opportunity to form a core and acquire my own essence!

The shamanic spell was still rooted deep within his soul, yet Chi Buzi felt no fear as he focused on the talisman qi.

It's a mere shamanic spell... In eighty-three years, when the True Monarch emerges from his seclusion, this spell can be dispelled easily. But securing that ancient relic is truly a treasure, I must secure it before meeting the True Monarch!

While he contemplated his next move, the Water Mansion Immortal Official suddenly grew vigilant and snapped, "What concern is it of yours? This is the legacy of the immortal position bestowed by the Immortal Court! It's mine alone to claim... Don't even think about it!"

However, Chi Buzi was not really listening to him. He was fixated on the promise hidden within his words—A legacy of an immortal position! A chance at the Dao Embryo!

Breathing heavily, Chi Buzi's thoughts raced with possibilities.

Could it be true? Does this ancient being truly believe in the Immortal Court? If so, how can I ensure my safety against Pristine Water? The True Monarch is ruthless—once he learns of this, the Azure Pond Sect won't protect me... It could mean more than just my demise.

Chi Buzi was adept at quick thinking. Within moments, he had weighed all possible outcomes.

In this case, it's better to vanish overseas and plot quietly in secret to claim this legacy than to be silenced or killed.

He rubbed his tired eyes, only then noticing his horrible state. He organized his thoughts.

I Investigated the Moongaze Lake, searched the soul of a Li Family member... and fell into the trap of this old thing...

His divine abilities were impaired, and chaotic moonlight energy surged through his body—a direct consequence of his daring gaze upon the immortal position.

A decade or so of recovery should suffice.

Despite the potential risks, Chi Buzi felt indifferent; encountering such ancient relics was worth any personal loss, especially since the power of the immortal position seemed extraordinary at first encounter.

"First, I need to restore my eyes."

Rolling up his sleeves, Chi Buzi began scooping up some river mud, deftly molding it into two thumb-sized balls which he then inserted into his empty eye sockets.

The two mud balls fitted into his sockets nicely. Closing his eyes, he performed a hand seal and cast a divine ability. A burst of colorful light emerged, and when he opened his eyes again, the mud balls had become real eyeballs that could move around.

This will suffice for now! I must have damaged my eyes by gazing directly at that immortal position... I'll craft proper replacements once I return to my sect for some blood qi.

Now with his new eyes, Chi Buzi's vision had become clearer and his mind turned sharper.

Although he had tasted the formidable power of the ancient being when he assaulted his sea of consciousness, Chi Buzi remained skeptical.

Could the Dao Embryo legacy really be so easily obtained? I could not even scan it with my spiritual sense, who knows what it is? If Pristine Water believes this, I'll be as good as dead.

As this thought crossed his mind, Chi Buzi's expression hardened as if recalling something.

"Old thing, is the Li Family even aware of your existence?" he asked.

"I've hidden in their house for decades but never spoken to any of them and have long erased their memories," the Water Mansion Immortal Official replied nonchalantly.

The Immortal Official's tone was dismissive, but for Chi Buzi, it was a matter concerning his own safety. He whispered fiercely, "I'll go silence them and reclaim the divine ability that I've leaked while I'm at it!"

Although Azure Pond and Mount Dali had promised not to perform blood sacrifice in the northern foothills, there was no problem in killing a few mortals. As for the divine power, it was referring to the scattered blood beads on the ground.

Chi Buzi was not after those spirit items, knowing they would soon dissipate. However, he feared they might be exploited by others. He opened the void, only to be stopped by the Immortal Official's harsh admonition.

"How dare you commit such acts that defy the natural order!"

His words carried weight, and after counting silently to four, Chi Buzi sighed deeply and reluctantly halted, replying coldly, "What an old-fashioned man you are! We, who possess divine abilities, are not the same as those mere mortals and lowly cultivators... How absurd it is for us to be bound by the same moral constraints fabricated by the mundane world!"

The Immortal Official snorted coldly and was about to respond when Chi Buzi cut in sharply, "Let me ask you this, old thing... When the heavens and the earth were first formed, were there any morals, laws, or honor when there was nothing but the vast land?"

Caught off guard, the Immortal Official responded, "There were none."

Chi Buzi smiled coldly and then continued, "In the earliest days of humanity, those who emerged first were revered, while those who followed were deemed lesser. The powerful became emperors; the meek, their slaves. The so-called morality was nothing more than a set of rules crafted by the revered to control the lesser, by emperors to dominate their subjects, and by elders to discipline the young."

He continued, "When the elders died, and the young became wiser and ascended to power, they preserved the established order. Over time, it morphed into a system of superiority and inferiority, morality and etiquette."

"Morality and laws are mere constructs; they exist if you believe in them and vanish if you don't. Now, as a revered figure with divine abilities, I can set my own rules. Why should I bow to the whims of those long gone?" he challenged.

The Immortal Official retorted in anger, "Slaughtering the innocent and disrupting the peace of heaven... Do you not fear the repercussions of karma?"

Chi Buzi scoffed and muttered darkly, "Karma? It is but a toy in the hands of the Mahas, and the people are mere livestock under my divine abilities. How adorable do you think these creatures are? They despise me, yet they would eagerly take my place."

With a sinister smile, he added, "As for the repercussions, it's nothing more than a feeble cry... a pitiful delusion."

Despite the distance, Chi Buzi's location was still within the perception of Lu Jiangxian's divine sense. With the help of the shamanic spell in his soul and his own divine sense, Lu Jiangxian could read every thought in his mind.

"THis is the only thing I can do since Chi Buzi's visit was too abrupt..."

With talisman qi that could elude even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Lu Jiangxian tried to bluff in away that would entice a potential Golden Core Realm cultivator. As long as Chi Buzi did not dare to gamble with Pristine Water's vision, it was naturally impossible for him to report anything.

The soul of the Immortal Official, though under Lu Jiangxian's influence, retained considerable autonomy. Armed with complete knowledge of Immortal Court systems from his past life and the Sacrificial Rituals Method's instructions in the mirror, he had managed to deceive Chi Buzi for the time being.

If contradictions arose, the Immortal Official would assume his fragmented memories were to blame, rather than suspect that his soul had been fabricated by another.

As long as Chi Buzi refrained from probing into the Pristine Water, the ever-watchful soul would ensure any slip led swiftly to his demise, which was far preferable to falling at Moongaze Lake.

"Once I finish using this man and ensure they won't be able to track me down, things will be easier."

Lu Jiangxian relaxed, a hint of anticipation coloring his face.

The Immortal Official's inquiry into today's events will certainly extend to the cultivation method and other secret techniques of the Azure Pond. He might even uncover aspects only accessible to those of the Purple Mansion Realm... Once Chi Buzi ventures to Moongaze Lake, I'll connect to his soul and extract his memories.

Surveying the area around Moongaze Lake with his divine sense, Lu Jiangxian sifted through the family treasuries. While there was nothing new, the Ding Family had a new set of legacies that included a Grade Two cultivation method of little significance.

Nevertheless, Lu Jiangxian noted down the cultivation technique before leisurely returning to the mirror. Chi Buzi's blood beads were still rolling on the ground.

These could be useful...

Although the beads contained only a modest amount of Chi Buzi's divine abilities, the shamanic path excelled in harnessing dharma blood. The abundant quantity was more than sufficient for Lu Jiangxian's purposes.

Just a bit more persuasion is needed for the Li Family to surrender them to me...

Aside from divine sense and the Supreme Yin Moonlight, the mirror's ability to interact with the outside world was limited. Unless someone triggered the mirror's fate, it was impossible for it to move, let alone pull someone into the realm within it.

Lu Jiangxian, though desiring the blood beads, had to wait for the Li Family to offer them to him.

Li Yuanjiao and the others watched Chi Buzi ride the wind and disappear into the distance, exchanging surprised glances.

"An official from the Dangjiang Creek Water Mansion? An Immortal Mansion?"

"It must be the reincarnation of some metallic essence..." speculated another.

The Li Family was more knowledgeable now.

Li Yuanping nodded in agreement.

"Brother is right, but considering what we've seen at home, how could it manifest a metallic essence...?"

They stopped abruptly, exchanging knowing looks with each other before swiftly changing the subject.

"The one possessing the Daoist Master's body seems reasonable enough, but who knows what he might do next."

Li Xuanxuan, noticeably more relaxed, wiped the sweat from his brow and added softly, "I'm also unsure if this Daoist Master will regain consciousness and seek revenge. We must prepare for all possibilities..."

Turning to Li Yuanjiao, he asked, "What do you think about relocating overseas?"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head slowly and replied, "We would need at least two family members at the Foundation Establishment Realm to consider establishing a branch overseas. Currently, sending anyone would be futile—they'd merely be marching to their demise."

He paused, then proposed, "Why don't we discreetly send Ximing to the Xiao Family to consult with Ancestor Yuansi? We could have Ximing fostered under his tutelage in the guise of practicing alchemy."

Li Yuanjiao gradually regained his composure and continued elaborating, "Ancestor Yuansi is a warm and generous elder. Under his guidance, Ximing will surely thrive, learning much more than he would at home."

"Moreover, should disaster befall the Li Family and we face annihilation, the Purple Mansion would surely attempt to erase us. Without divine abilities, fleeing would be futile. Xiao Chuting, who has sheltered Chen Taojing, a suspected remnant of the immortal sect, will likely use his divine abilities to conceal Ximing's whereabouts as well, ensuring our family's legacy endures," he added.

Li Xuanxuan sighed as he sat down.

"Ancestor Yuansi has already done much for our family... The debt of gratitude we owe is immense, and I would not involve him further unless absolutely necessary."

Li Yuanping, who had been listening quietly, nodded slightly, then cupped his fist and excused himself.

"I will make the necessary arrangements."

Li Xuanxuan gave him a nod, then turned back to Li Yuanjiao.

"In these perilous times, perhaps you should take the mirror, seal the ancestral hall, and retreat to Mount Wutu for safety."

Li Yuanjiao performed a hand seal, then carefully collected the red beads from the ground and placed them in a jade box. Once done, he picked up one and examined it in the moonlight.

The bead's radiant red hue, shadowed by a faint gray mist, shone particularly brightly. Staring at it for an extended period stirred a deep-seated sense of unease and irritability within him, feelings that were difficult to put into words.

As soon as he secured the beads, Li Yuanjiao felt the talisman seed within him stir and was immediately delighted.

Oh, they can be used as an offering in the sacrificial ritual..? I knew these were good stuff!

"This is a serious matter. We must consult the mirror," he replied to Li Xuanxuan.

With that, he activated the complex formation, entered the ancestral hall, and pushed open the heavy stone door. He kneeled and bowed deeply before the mirror.

"I, Li Yuanjiao, the disciple of the Li Family that is beset by calamity and faces great peril, respectfully request the Profound Light to protect and preserve... I pray for your supreme guidance..."

After completing the ritual and offering deep bows, the mirror's light gradually dimmed before descending before him, indicating his prayer's success.

Li Yuanjiao had studied several books of prayers from the mirror, dedicating himself to understanding these mystical incantations. He often wondered why the mirror required such elaborate rituals, assuming it was a reflection of its exceedingly high status.

However, his recent encounter with a metallic essence claiming that he was the Immortal Official from the Dangjiang Creek Water Mansion governed by the Immortal Lord, had left him deeply unsettled. Piecing together all he knew about the mirror, a startling possibility emerged.

Perhaps this mirror serves a vast immortal mansion in a realm beyond our skies! Maybe it is merely a medium for communicating with this distant celestial realm...

If this were truly the case, then everything made sense! Perhaps Chi Buzi had inadvertently met a specific criterion—maybe an offense against the Immortal Mansion or he was destined to become a physical sacrifice, thus allowing an Immortal Official to descend to the mortal realm!

With these thoughts unraveling in his mind, the potential of mighty forces behind the scenes slowly became apparent. Li Yuanjiao dared not speak of his suspicions aloud but held them close in his heart.

Feeling a surge of excitement, he wondered, Does expressing our gratitude to Supreme Yin meant... we'll be able to reach the immortal mansion as long as our cultivation is high enough...?

Suppressing his wild speculations, Li Yuanjiao carefully stored the mirror and exited the backyard. He nodded to his father and announced respectfully, "I'm going to Mount Wutu to cultivate!"

Li Xuanxuan exhaled deeply, nodding in return as he watched his son leave. He then proceeded to close up the formations, ensuring all traces were concealed within the secret chamber before leaving to meditate as well.

As soon as Li Yuanjiao returned to Wutu Peak, he was greeted warmly by Xiao Guiluan.

"How was it?"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head and replied, "Nothing to worry about, it was just a false alarm."

He quickly changed the subject.

"The family plans to send Ximing to the Xiao Family to study alchemy... I'll need you to make the journey as well."

"Understood," Xiao Guiluan responded succinctly, taking to the winds without further question.

Li Yuanjiao felt a pang of guilt and unease in his heart. Xiao Guiluan trusted him completely, yet he had to keep secrets from her.

After all, having experienced it firsthand and hearing it from Li Tongya, the talisman seed could indeed protect against the Purple Mansion Realm Cultivator's deceptions. Only those who received the seed could lie directly to Purple Mansion Realm cultivators without fear of detection.

Xiao Guiluan did not have such protection from a talisman seed, and knowing too much would probably only endanger her.

"Hm?" Li Yuanjiao paused, a sudden thought striking him.

The Yu Family has been too quiet!

Compelled to investigate, he took out the bluish-gray mirror and soared northeast, over mountains and forests, before landing at the Yu Family's cave dwelling.

The highest cave, richest in spiritual qi, was heavily fortified by a grand formation. The entrance was also sealed tightly with multiple layers of spirit formations.

Inside, Li Yuanjiao found the cave floor littered with shiny jade fragments that were still rolling around. Blue, green, red... They scattered across the ground, reflecting off one another. The cave was also filled with various crystals from ceiling to floor, and the ground was blanketed with fine white salt.

A skeleton, colored like jade but broken in half, lay collapsed. The upper section of the skeleton had fallen to the ground, cleanly severed, the cut so smooth and flat it seemed almost polished.
