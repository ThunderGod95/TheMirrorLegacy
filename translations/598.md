# Chapter 935: Orchid

Several months later, at Moongaze Lake.

Formation lights shimmered across the lake isles, reflected in the serene azure waters. Above the main continent, cultivators came and went. Streaks of light chased each other as they descended around the lake. An air of prosperity and bustle filled the scene.

A cloud veiled in white spiritual gauze silently drifted in from the east. As Chen Xuanyu came to a stop above the lake, Li Qinghong stepped forward and immediately expressed her thanks, "Thank you for all the trouble along the way, Senior."

"It’s nothing." Chen Xuanyu nodded, hand resting on his sword. The blue sash on his pleated robes fluttered in the wind, giving him an elegant air as he spoke lightly, "I merely circled Xifeng Island a few more times. It took little effort, and it's hardly worth calling trouble."

He seemed somewhat distracted, clasping his hands as he said, "I still need to make a trip to the Great Western Plains, so I won’t impose further."

Li Qinghong studied his expression carefully and replied gently, "This junior understands. If you will be staying long in the west and not in Tongmo Prefecture, I’ll send Xijun to visit you there instead."

Her words responded to an earlier invitation from Chen Xuanyu, spoken with good reason. Yet Li Qinghong noticed his gaze shift slightly before he nodded and replied, "Very well."

He swept his blue-and-white patterned sleeves, performed a parting salute, and rode his cloud westward. Li Qinghong silently watched him leave, her almond eyes lowering.

Throughout the journey, Li Ximing kept both hands tucked into his sleeves, seemingly feeling chilled. As he and Li Qinghong passed over Xifeng Island with Chen Xuanyu, they saw no sign of Li Xijun, but that didn’t mean they returned empty-handed.

Remnants of Merging Fire still blazed fiercely above Xifeng Island, with gray-red clouds churning in the sky. It was clearly an ominous sign. At the time, Chen Xuanyu had glanced twice, then said to the aunt and nephew, "I fear a Merging Fire cultivator has fallen."

Upon hearing those words, Li Ximing’s heart sank halfway to ice. As they traveled, he flew fifty kilometers with the wind, three times hesitating and looking back, finally asking, "Do either of you elders feel a chill in this place?"

Li Qinghong remained silent the entire time, offering no reply.

Li Ximing felt nothing but a bitter northern wind in the area. Li Qinghong had to call him twice before he came to his senses and followed along, floating all the way back to the island.

There, dressed in crimson-black robes, Li Chengliao stepped forward and greeted them respectfully, "Greetings to both elders."

Li Qinghong stepped into the hall, flipping her hand to store away her long spear. Li Ximing quietly followed and sat down to the side. Li Chengliao then recounted the matter regarding the visitors from Azure Pond Sect.

Li Yuanqin and the others had returned the bow and waited aboard the Dawn Cloudliner under the Heavenly Glow for some time, but never disembarked again. The remaining visitors, including Ning Hemian, had roamed the island for a few days before bidding farewell on their behalf. The cloudliner had then departed.

Li Qinghong gave a faint sigh and said, "You handled this matter well; there was little else to be done. Returning the bow will surely spark some debate, but it has nothing to do with our family. Just observe and leave it be. And what of Azure Pond?"

Li Chengliao promptly replied, "There’s unrest in both the Southern and Eastern Seas. It seems the Lingu Family is backing the Si Family, and they’re coming on strong. A few days ago, there was discussion to send Uncle Xizhi to the Eastern Sea."

Li Qinghong nodded. Since Li Xizhi hadn’t come to inquire at home, it likely meant the Li Family didn’t need to interfere. As for Li Chengliao, not seeing Li Xijun return left him faintly puzzled, but noticing the poor mood of the two before him, he dared not probe and only said softly, "In recent months, a fire sparrow has been circling above the lake, appearing and disappearing, seemingly searching for something. It moves with great speed, and we haven’t been able to catch it..."

"Has it harmed anyone?" Li Qinghong asked, and seeing Li Chengliao shake his head and gesture that the matter could wait, she dismissed him. Li Ximing immediately grew restless, excused himself, and sped off toward Mount Qingdu.

Li Qinghong waited in the hall for several seconds before Li Ximing rushed back, descending on radiant light and exhaling in relief, "Aunt! Xijun’s life jade is intact, only slightly dimmed!"

Seeing his spirits lift, Li Qinghong couldn’t bear to say more and only nodded lightly, thinking to herself, If someone at the Purple Mansion Realm interfered... then of course it wouldn’t shatter. Against such divine powers, these simple tricks are barely worth mentioning!

Li Ximing clearly understood this as well, but seeing that Li Qinghong showed no joy, he simply sat beside her. The Yang Li Red Sparrow Banner flipped back and forth in his sleeve. He took it out and began silently refining it.

After fifteen minutes, Li Qinghong suddenly looked up and saw a hazy red light rising into the sky. She scrutinized it for a second, then drew her spear, saying, "I fear it’s a Molten Fire demonic creature!"

The aunt and nephew rode the wind beyond the formation, and sure enough, standing outside was a fire sparrow as tall as a person. Its eyes gleamed with spirit as it examined the two. Its body was wreathed in hazy flames, each feather distinct. Yet its aura was murky and its strength unreadable.

Unlike ordinary sparrows, its neck was longer and more graceful, while its wings were slightly larger. Its eyes glowed gold-red, and the hazy firelight it gave off made the two feel a searing pain on their faces

Unclear of its origins yet sensing no hostility, Li Qinghong cupped her hands and said, "May I ask, fellow Daoist..."

Flames before the fire sparrow condensed into two ancient seal-script words, Slaughter Jun. It then spoke in human tongue, its voice high and sharp, "I come bearing the directive of Daoist Master Junjian, please receive the decree within the formation."

"Daoist Master Junjian?"

The two were stunned for a moment. Though they didn’t know what command Tu Longjian had issued, they dared not show any disrespect. Li Qinghong recognized the flame as indeed from the Molten Fire Dao, but they had never before received a directive from him and couldn’t tell if the fire sparrow was real or fake.

The grand formation on the island behind Li Qinghong was only at the Qi Cultivation Realm. It was meaningless as a defense against Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators like them. She wasn’t worried about anyone intruding, and the fire sparrow seemed proper enough, so she suppressed her unease and spoke softly, "Please."

"Very well!" Her gesture of trust softened the fire sparrow’s tone. It stopped in front of the island's main hall, flapped its wings to stop the pair from inviting it inside, and opened its beak to spit something out.

Thump.

Li Ximing’s face flickered with the glow of Molten Fire, its light casting shifting shadows across his cheeks. He heard a heavy plop as something landed before him, a pitch-black jade box that rolled once, and he instantly snatched it up.

His spiritual sense surged into it instantly, and he saw a thumb-sized white stone, radiating brilliant Radiant Light like mist and smoke. Within the whiteness ran intricate, luminous patterns. Daylight churned within the box like a swirl of bright white sunfire—just brushing it with his spiritual sense caused his Immortal Foundation to tremble.

Radiant Sky Stone!

The thing he had dreamed of day and night was finally in his hands. Li Ximing’s pupils widened and his face lit with joy as he looked up, only to see another dark shape spew forth from the fire sparrow’s beak.

It landed with a thud in front of him. It was a corpse, rigid and still as it lay face down.

The young man’s gaze fell on the corpse’s snow-white longsword. Li Ximing’s brows twitched violently, furrowing downward while his brow rose upward. He craned his neck back, his face blank with confusion.

He stood frozen, clutching the black jade box, then slowly bent down to grab the corpse’s collar and turned it over, studying the face. The man’s face was charred black almost to the bone, yet the remaining details of his cheeks and frame matched.

In his heart, Li Ximing thought, This must be Xijun.

He picked him up and noticed two slashes on Li Xijun’s neck. Clearly, he had been decapitated more than once.

Squinting, he heard the fire sparrow chirping rapidly, "...so he killed Guo Hongyao and Guo Hongkang to seize the spirit item... was then spotted by Guo Hongjian... fled heavily wounded and collapsed on a small island... was found by two rogue cultivators and beheaded... but he killed them right before dying..."

Li Ximing listened in a daze, his heart seething with hatred but with no one to direct it toward. Thoughts churned within him until he realized... he hated himself most of all.

He vaguely heard his aunt Li Qinghong choke out a thank you, and the fire sparrow opened its beak again, its voice resonating, "The Radiant Sky Stone is delivered. Our matters are now settled!"

The flames before him surged upward as the bird transformed into a streak of radiant fire and soared into the sky. Li Ximing remained numb and unaware. The corpse in his arms had only been held together by spellcraft. Now that the spell had faded, a burst of cold swept forth.

The chill raced from his neck to his face, and suddenly his arms felt empty. The solid weight vanished.

Clink, clatter

Red stones spilled to the ground. He reached out to grab them, but they had already tumbled down his robes and struck the floor. Looking down, he saw a full set of heart, lungs, spleen, and liver that were each crimson-red, stone-like in texture, smooth and glistening, lying on the stone tiles. A scent of pine wafted through the air as heavy snow began to fall all around.

The snow drifted down from the heavens, carrying waves of pine fragrance, settling softly upon his robes. Snow piled upon Li Ximing’s shoulders as rustling sounds filled his ears.

He thought, Of course... when he was on the brink of death, he took Earth-View Bloodstone to stay alive.

Li Ximing stared at the Bloodstone in the snow, struggling to reconcile the scattered red rocks with his dashing, elegant younger brother. Then he heard Li Qinghong’s voice beside him, "Ming’er, gather his things."

She took out a jade box and carefully picked up the organs one by one, placing them inside with crisp clinking sounds. Then she scooped two handfuls of pine-scented snow and gently sprinkled it over them, speaking softly, "I’ll take care of this—just gather the rest."

Only then did Li Ximing come to his senses. He gathered the remaining items and clutched them to his chest, soaring off the island atop Radiant Light. Glancing back, he saw snow blanketing the entire island. A cold wind rose from the forest, circled the sky three times as if reluctant to part, then drifted steadily eastward.

————

Li Ximing returned the items to his cave dwelling, then hurried back out, riding the wind to hover above the lake. He watched the snowfall until the sky began to brighten, then slowly made his way back inside.

Several items sat quietly on his desk. The most striking was the glinting Han Lin, but next to it lay the now-revealed ancient dharma artifact, the Chongming Profound Insight Screen. A pitch-black jade box rested on one side, while the dharma robes from Crimson Reef Island were piled to the other.

Li Ximing picked up the snow-white longsword and turned it over in his hands a few times before setting it aside. Then he reached for the storage pouch. Li Xijun’s storage pouch was plain white. Li Ximing, who also knew the Li Family’s secret techniques, easily broke the simple restriction Li Xijun had left in place.

His spiritual sense swept through it and found it nearly empty. There were only just a few neatly arranged spirit stones, some talismans, pills, and a handful of precious golden talismans of the Shamanic Dao, with one already used.

Aside from those, there was only a single, small jade box and nothing else.

"Is this the storage pouch of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator? He must’ve planned for this all along, and been willing to trade his life for that item! That’s why he left everything else behind!"

It felt like he’d been slapped across the face. The haze on his expression vanished, replaced by a grief so raw it surged to the surface. His eyes shut tight, as his jaw clenched.

It was a long while before he could collect himself. He coughed up two mouthfuls of blood that never touched the ground. They turned into Radiant Light midair and dissipated.

Li Ximing rested by the desk until the sun rose high. At last, he wiped his mouth and took out the sole jade box from the storage pouch. It was no bigger than a palm, ordinary in texture, and cold to the touch.

He had thought it might be a treasure plundered from Crimson Reef Island, but upon closer inspection, he realized the jade box was of Li Family make. It was a standard issue for their direct descendants, used to store dharma artifacts.

Thinking it over, Li Ximing couldn’t recall anything that Li Xijun would need to take out instead of leaving at home. He murmured, "Could it be... that he left something inside?"

Li Ximing placed the box on the table, set both hands on the edges, and gave a gentle tap. The lid popped open by itself.

He glanced inside, his pupils dilated suddenly, and he cried out, "You!"

His hands trembling, he slowly lifted the lid entirely. Inside, resting on white silk, lay a pale-blue, lapis-lantern orchid. It was a sight that was all too familiar, yet no matter how many times Li Ximing imagined the possibilities, this flower should never have appeared here!

This dharma artifact was an exquisitely crafted woman’s accessory. Each stamen glistened under sunlight, and every petal unfurled in graceful beauty. It was like a venomous scorpion, stinging him full-force in the face.

Li Ximing leaped to his feet, covering his eyes, shaking his head again and again like a drunken man as he stumbled backward three or four steps before collapsing onto the ground.

Crash!

The jade tables and stools clattered to the floor. The lapis orchid, like a vengeful ghost, fell from the desk and rolled a couple times before coming to a stop right before him.

Basking in the warm sunlight, the orchid still held the elegant charm of youth. It lay quietly on the floor, its petals glowing with golden hues and its shadow casting a blooming silhouette.

Li Ximing squinted at it, as his breathing grew hoarse. Memories flooded back; those strange little moments, Xijun’s frequent downcast eyes, and a bitter voice echoed in his ears.

You make your mess, and I’m the one who has to clean it up.

No wonder... no wonder... you... you didn’t let her go! Of course! A cautious man like you, how could you have let her go?! Xijun... you... you!

He slowly raised his head and let out a sound that was part wail, part sob, "You killed her!!"
