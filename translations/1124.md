# Chapter 1124: The Vassal's Inscription

Spiritual Qi surged through the ethereal clouds and mist.

Blazing radiance flickered between toppled jade pillars. Steps that seemed carved from white jade glowed faintly. Li Minggong ascended them all, reaching the peak. She turned slightly, a perfectly measured smile gracing her stunning features.

"Please wait for a moment, Your Lordship. King Wei will be here shortly."

The Daoist Master behind her, clad in green robes with a gourd and scroll at his waist, wore a solemn expression. It was none other than Daoist Master Qinghu, Sima Yuanli.

"Of course… of course…"

Sima Yuanli quickly agreed. He watched her depart before beginning to pace the mountaintop.

He had visited this place more than once but seldom had a moment to appreciate it so idly. Truthfully, the Li family's Gardenia Scenery Mountain was not overwhelmingly powerful—its formations were merely at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Yet, it possessed an undeniable grace, a profound calm and presence that spoke of a lineage risen from chaotic times.

Just like the woman who had just left.

He meandered, gaze drifting. Rounding a slight bend, he found the central pillar gleaming with a bright light. He looked closer and saw a line of words carved into it, the handwriting resolute and powerful.

"The great desert wall has crumbled, making it arduous to gather qi. Should I fall, Heavenly Light will converge, sands will smoke, and Radiant Essence will overflow. I have bound it with a formation for the benefit of later generations."

"Li Clan Disciple, Ximing."

Sima Yuanli stared, momentarily stunned. A storm of complex emotions washed over him as a realization dawned. Only now did he understand how ignorant his bewilderment had been all those years ago, sitting in his sect, when he first heard of Li Ximing's achievements.

'That day, I looked down upon the world's heroes and thought them lacking. I never knew that talents were rising everywhere, swimming hidden in the abyss, sacrificing everything for the chance at a single, glorious leap!'

He was so lost in his silence, so staggered by this revelation, that he failed to immediately notice the young man stepping through the air to stand upon the mountain. He froze, then swiftly turned, his face once more arranging itself into a respectful smile.

"Greetings, King Wei!"

The young man looked as though he had just emerged from seclusion. He slowly opened a pair of golden eyes, and one could faintly perceive flames surging within them, blazing with power.

"There is no need for such ceremony."

Sima Yuanli smiled and went to greet him. Li Zhouwei, seeing him approach, spoke softly:

"I asked you to come, Daoist Master, for two matters."

"First, This King must make a trip to the Western Sea. Please inform the Grand General to maintain strict vigilance against Zhao and Shu."

If Li Suining had not already verified this matter, Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing would never have felt at ease leaving Moongaze Lake at the same time. But even so, the necessary arrangements could not be neglected.

"Second, I need to borrow the Huai River Map."

Almost before the words had left his lips, Daoist Master Qinghu naturally untied the scroll from his waist. He held it forth in both hands without a moment's hesitation or thought, presenting it to Li Zhouwei.

"Qinghu shall obey the King's command."

A flash of interest flickered in Li Zhouwei's golden eyes. He realized the Daoist Master before him had been prepared for this—perhaps ever since Vast Cicada's fall, he had been waiting for him, King Wei, to come and 'borrow' the Huai River Map.

Yet, even when faced with such an ultimate treasure of the Bright Yang, not a trace of greed showed in those golden eyes.

"Do not worry. When the matter is concluded, I will certainly return it to Daoist friend Qinghu—and the proper compensation will not be forgotten."

He took it casually, holding it in one hand. He raised it before him and gave it a gentle shake.

_Shhhla!_

The satin-like cord binding the scroll instantly dissolved. A brilliant, warm, and gentle radiance flared as the Spiritual Treasure revealed its true form!

Vast river waters surged and swelled. The brushwork moved like waves, like a Flood Dragon, a tempest of tumbling billows. It felt less like unrolling a map and more like unfurling a stretch of endless, pure white. The roar of a mighty river instantly echoed in his ears. But then, a Heavenly Light burst forth, a majestic pass rose, and an imposing city wall stood firm within the river, unmoving against the raging torrents.

A few lines of golden light appeared at the end of the scroll.

Sima Yuanli's gaze twitched as if he had seen something terrifying. A hint of panic flickered in his eyes, and he quickly looked down at the ground.

This artifact had been in his possession for decades, and its inscription had always read:

Huai River Map. Cui Yan of Boye. The 317th year of Zhenghe.

The characters were stark and distinct, without the slightest error—it was the handwriting of a True Monarch! It had not changed in a thousand years!
But as King Wei unrolled the map, an unprecedented, dense web of golden patterns spread over the scroll's edges. The golden characters of the inscription at the end lit up, one by one:

'Huai River Map. Your humble subject, Cui Yan, crafted this in the 317th year of Zhenghe.'

…

The sky and clouds were one, bathed in brilliant light.

The darkness of the Great Void was suddenly torn apart. Pale yellow light spilled through as a Daoist strolled out. His robes were immaculate, his demeanor perfectly calm. He trod upon the shifting, ephemeral light of the Lesser Yang, which tumbled and rolled beneath him. He drifted to a stop above the sea surface and smiled.

"Old senior… this is the Western Sea!"

Only then did an old man hurry out from behind him. His face was a little pale, and he looked weather-beaten. His somewhat cloudy eyes swept their surroundings.

"This old man has spent his life drifting through the Eastern Sea, but this is a true feast for the eyes. I'm afraid I'll need some guidance from you, Daoist friend."

These words made the Lesser Yang-cultivating Daoist Master smile and shake his head.

"Old senior jests. Nanwu has only accompanied a disciple-brother here once, so I am hardly familiar with it. We shall just have to see what arrangements senior Zhaojing has made."

The two were precisely Guo Nanwu and Yan Dushui!

After Li Ximing had settled his affairs, he spent some time in the Western Sea, hoping to drum up some pill-refining business. He had given Guo Nanwu a command token and sent him on a trip to the Eastern Sea.

But having Guo Nanwu be the one to handle this had given Yan Dushui quite a start.

The Guo family had once taken refuge in the outer seas. The West Curtain Sea, where Yan Dushui resided, was one of the closest locations to the outer seas, and he actually recognized Guo Nanwu!

'I heard… he is practically a disciple of that Great Daoist Master from Mount Qusi.'

He, Yan Dushui, was old, but he certainly knew of Mount Qusi! To put it bluntly, that immortal mountain was a top-tier Daoist tradition in the entire Southern Sea, and it was faintly backed by an ancient inheritance. While it couldn't compare to the Nine Mounds… it wasn't far off!

In truth, Guo Nanwu's status was far from low—much higher than his own. This old Daoist Master had lived in seclusion for many years, and plying Guo Nanwu for news along the journey had left him reeling.

'That Li Zhouwei obtained the King Wei title… he's already that formidable?'

After their long journey, his expression had grown solemn. He drifted down into the mountains. When he saw Li Ximing approaching to greet him, Yan Dushui's smile broadened, and he hurried to speak.

"Daoist friend Zhaojing, long time no see!"

A hot wind rustled through the mountains, where tall pill furnaces stood. Rolling flames leaped at their bases, casting colorful light. The Daoist Master looked over with a smile. After a few pleasantries, his expression shifted to one of surprise and emotion.

"Senior Yan… you have truly toiled these past years!"

He had seen Yan Dushui years ago when he visited the Nine Mounds. He had seemed much older than their very first meeting. Time had flown by, and seeing him again, things were different once more.

Although the old man's face had not changed much, when Li Ximing activated his Life Divine Ability and simulated the Light of the Six Harmonies, he immediately sensed that something was wrong.

'His vital essence is blazing, visible even outside his physical form. His divine ability is brilliant, but it fluctuates erratically within his six senses… He must be using some spiritual item to cling to life… His days are numbered!'

Noticing the deep emotion in Li Ximing's expression, Yan Dushui shook his head.

"To see the mortal world's great seas and famous mountains before I fall is an excellent thing."

They chatted for a moment before Yan Dushui's face filled with guilt.

"I promised to take action for you back then, Daoist friend. Who knew my body would fail so quickly? I am not of much use now, but I will do my best!"

Li Ximing sighed.

"Senior's Dharma body is unwell. To engage in battle would burn through your life-mandate at an alarming rate. How could Zhaojing turn a blind eye? Please, do not mention it again!"

This deeply moved Yan Dushui, though it also left his thoughts more muddled.

"But I have already crossed ten thousand li to come here…"

Li Ximing shook his head gravely and asked, "Senior mentioned long ago that our two families share ancient kinship. Are you willing to speak of your arrangements? Which of your disciples is cultivating in the Nine Mounds? If I should encounter them in the future, I can look after them."

Yan Dushui hadn't crossed ten thousand li just to see the sights. He had come, first, to repay a favor, and second, to settle his final affairs. Li Ximing's words were spoken with such consideration that the old man's eyes reddened.

"Zhaojing… such high-minded righteousness… I only regret that Lin Yi did not know you sooner… Now I have no way to repay you…"

Seeing Li Ximing wave his hand dismissively, Yan Dushui did not delay.

"That child of mine is named Yan Chuan. He is a disciple under cultivator Cao Tingwen of the Nine Mounds' Zhiyan Peak. The Nine Mounds will provide him with spiritual items. If he fails to break through, he will return to my tradition to find new disciples. As for my life's wealth, it is all deposited with the Nine Mounds…"

Li Ximing nodded.

"If this child achieves a divine ability, will he be counted as a disciple of the Nine Mounds?"

Yan Dushui fell silent for a moment before saying, his voice thick with tears, 

"He should be… But according to the rules of the immortal mountain, if he fully enters the Nine Mounds, he can no longer manage his clansmen below. Several hundred thousand of my disciples are on the sea. While their lives won't be in danger… I fear their future development will be entirely out of his control!"

After all, those people were still under the banner of the Nine Mounds, so they wouldn't be snatched up and eaten by some Demon beast. But how Yan Chuan would view his own clan in the future was truly hard to say.

Li Ximing paused, adopting a pensive look.

"I have an idea."

Yan Dushui looked up, his eyes filled with hope.

"Why not find another way out for your esteemed clan?" Li Ximing said. "I've heard there is a Daoist Master Xie Hu in the Tanping Desert. He is an upright man with a high cultivation, and he is known for honoring his promises. He seems especially suitable."

Yan Dushui was not without other contingency plans; he had disciples placed elsewhere. He had originally hoped Mount Qusi would be willing to accept a Yan clan disciple, but now this unrelated name had appeared. And yet, he found his heart stirring.

'Far away in the Western Sea is even better… If I can find a Daoist Master like this as a backer and bring a few disciples over, that would be a fine escape route.'

He sighed.

"I am utterly destitute. The only Valley Water I have left is for the younger generation. The only thing I have to offer is this broken old body…"

To extend these last few years of his life, Yan Dushui had exhausted nearly every spiritual resource he possessed. Li Ximing, however, spoke with a serious expression.

"I know a Daoist Master Dao Mian who has a good relationship with Xie Hu. You can use his introduction to pay him a visit."

The Daoist Master smiled.

"Do you remember that place where the 'Exiled Qi' spiritual item is stored?"

Understanding dawned on Yan Dushui. He said thoughtfully, "This…"

Li Ximing smiled.

"That cave-mansion is preserved by 'Exiled Qi'. Apart from your family's secret method, no one can find it. Even if you lead them there, they forget the location the moment they turn away… Not only is it filled with all kinds of yin qi, it also contains ancient shamanic patterns from the Underworld!"

"This Daoist Master Xie Hu cultivates 'Upper Shaman,' so his Daoist tradition can be said to fall within the Underworld's sphere. He is also a man intent on seeking the Dao. If you tell him of this, how could his heart not be moved? Regardless of whether it's useful to him, he will certainly go and take a look. If it proves to be of great use, the grace of attaining the Dao is as heavy as Mount Tai! What is taking one disciple in comparison? Even if you asked him to kill someone for you… it would not be impossible!"

Yan Dushui stared blankly, silent for a long time before muttering,

"True… I am a dying man, so I have no fear of him trying to force the secret method from me… The Yan family is also under the protection of the Nine Mounds, so I don't need to fear his schemes…"

"And the incense in that cave mansion is almost gone. Once it burns out, the place cannot be found even with the secret method. There is no benefit for him to be ungrateful…"

Li Ximing smiled.

"You need not worry about that. I have been here for several months and have heard of this Daoist Master Xie Hu's reputation. He opened a mystic realm with others, and his word is his bond. A Daoist friend who accompanied him fell within, but to honor a promise, he was willing to travel a thousand li to deliver even the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness to that man's descendants."

"I saw him again later and refined a pill for him. He even questioned me in detail about Mount Wu!"

Yan Dushui was skeptical of such rumors, but a light gradually kindled in his eyes as he listened to Li Ximing's ambiguous smile.

"It's the perfect opportunity to invite him back, let him tour the Eastern Sea, and pick a junior he finds most pleasing to be his disciple…"

"Exactly!" Yan Dushui looked deeply moved. "Many thanks to Daoist friend for the guidance!"

But once the words of thanks were spoken, Yan Dushui's mind raced. He didn't believe for a second that this was about any deep feelings between their families. Li Ximing was helping him for a reason; he clearly wanted something. That line about 'killing someone' sparked a thought.

'What do I have that's worth him coveting? It's nothing more than a favor from this Daoist Master Xie Hu.'

Yan Dushui spoke.

"Daoist friend, you are so considerate of me, I must repay this kindness! But as for killing someone… I am old. I do not wish to create more enemies for my descendants. However, if a disciple of my clan successfully enters his tutelage, and Daoist Master Xie Hu gains from his trip to the east, he will surely owe a favor. I will definitely have him repay this kindness to you, Daoist friend!"

Li Ximing waved his hand and smiled.

"Daoist friend, you are too polite. If we can truly gain a favor from Daoist Master Xie Hu, and the Li family draws closer to him, how could your esteemed clan's disciple… not receive more favorable treatment?"

If Xie Hu was truly as loyal and righteous as claimed, a disciple under his wing would have no need for such a favor. It was far better to trade it to the Li family. The two of them reached a silent, mutual understanding. Yan Dushui immediately prioritized this matter, saying solemnly,

"I shall go pay him a visit right now?"

Li Ximing smiled faintly.

This was a matter that truly only he, Li Ximing, could have orchestrated. Only he and Yan Dushui had entered that place together and understood what it contained. And as someone within the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, who had connections to both the Great Xiukui Monastery and the imperial scions of the Underworld, he understood better than anyone how precious that cave mansion truly was!

'Apart from Yan Dushui, no one else can find that place. But I have the Immortal Mirror. As long as I've been there once and know the general direction, I can find it again… I just have to wait for Que'Wan to reach the next stage, and I can let her take a look.'

He swirled the contents of his cup.

'Yan Dushui doesn't have the Profound Mystery incense; he can only enter one last time. My family, however, has some…'

For some reason, the terrifying image of the Middle Vast Jade Mountain flashed before his eyes. Once bitten, twice shy. The memory made him hesitate.

'Many things in this world are better left unknown… That place… It's best to get the secret method from Yan Dushui's own mouth, to have a perfectly justifiable reason. Besides, once the Profound Mystery incense burns out, the cave mansion will disperse. I can't let him use up that final wisp. That way, I'll have a chance to replenish it in the future.'

He took a sip of tea and smiled.

"Just one thing. If this matter succeeds, I hope Daoist friend will leave a thread of opportunity. Do not let the cave mansion dissipate entirely. My family has a junior who cultivates shamanic arts. If she can reach the Purple Mansion Realm, I hope she, too, can enter and take a look."

This made Yan Dushui's eyes light up. He nodded in pleasant surprise.

"That would be Que'Wan, correct? She is in seclusion at the Nine Mounds. I heard that great personage mention her. A true genius! What wonderful fate, wonderful fate. I will remember this."

Seeing him so eager to forge more connections, Li Ximing chuckled. He found Dao Mian and sent the two on their way. Only then did he quietly pace back to his courtyard. He refilled his own cup with clear tea and smiled to himself.

'There was no need to clash with him head-on, and no need to persuade him with great wealth. If all goes smoothly, I'll be the one earning a favor from him.'
