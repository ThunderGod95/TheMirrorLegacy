# Chapter 423: Shattered

When the devil cultivator surnamed Qiu saw Zhang Huaide's pathetic state, he could not help but wonder about the man's true abilities.

The Ancestor Difu sent this person, but I can't tell his purpose here... From the look on the ancestor's face, this guy likely has some background. Perhaps he has some trick up his sleeve!

Gritting his teeth in frustration, the devil cultivator pushed his palms out. White qi surged forth as he tried to resist the thunder talisman Li Qinghong unleashed with a yell. The two attacks collided with a loud noise and Qiu tried forcing it away with all his might.

Li Qinghong's Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique was the highest-grade spell available in the Li Family. Spells and techniques were strictly controlled by the three sects and seven gates, so the Li Family was unable to obtain other secret techniques of comparable quality.

BOOM!

The talisman in front of Qiu exploded. Purple lightning crackled aloud, and white smoke billowed in every direction.

"AHH!"

The devil cultivator cried out in pain, his palms now scorched black. But before he could even catch his breath, a brilliant sword light had emerged from the smoke and dust, heading directly for his neck. The devil cultivator had no choice but to use his hands to defend himself.

His spell was shattered by Li Qinghong's thunder talisman, and the Qingche Sword, a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, flashed with deadly precision, cleanly severing five of his fingers. Blood streamed from the stumps as his eyes burned with rage.

"Damn it, Zhang Huaide! Qiu Ji is getting out of here!" he screamed.
ùòßùìáùëíùëíùë§‚ÑØùëèùìÉùò∞ùë£‚ÑØùò≠.ùò§‚Ñ¥ùòÆ

The light in Zhang Huaide's hand continued to intensify. Li Yuanjiao had readied the last remaining Foundation Establishment Realm talisman from his clan in his hand while gripping the Qingche Sword with his other, his gaze fixated on Zhang Huaide.

As Li Yuanjiao's gaze locked onto him, Zhang Huaide felt a sharp pain in the center of his forehead but remained calm and unafraid.

"Pitiful fool! I shall let you witness the true power of a devil cultivator's secret technique!" he declared coldly and arrogantly.

The devil cultivators around him were thrilled, eager for him to strike. Zhang Huaide lifted the red mirror up high. Five jade rings appeared around him as he recited loudly, "By the grace of the Heavens, preaching across ten jungles and the underworld, I call upon the law of the four seas and the great void... The Blood Imperial Void Escape Spell!"

The mirror in his hands flickered as his body transformed into a blood-colored stream of light. It was no larger than a fist, trailing a long red tail as it swiftly moved away.

The field fell silent.

The devil cultivators were too stunned to even utter curses. Among those who had been contemplating escape but were surrounded by the Li Family, the ones most aware of Zhang Huaide's shamelessness reacted the quickest.

Taking advantage of the crowd's distraction, the devil cultivator seized an opening. With his hammer, he shattered the mana shield of Tian Youdao‚Äîthe weakest among the group‚Äîand struck him squarely in the chest.

Crack!

A sickening sound of splintering bone filled the air.

"UNCLE!"

Tian Zhongqing's anguished cry pierced through the chaos.

Qiu Ji's figure blurred as he retreated, enveloped in a blood-red light, moving in a direction different from where Zhang Huaide had vanished.

Of course, Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong were not going to let him escape. They rode the wind and gave chase, not anticipating that Qiu Ji would be heading straight toward Xu Gongming, who was armed with a dharma artifact.

While Xu Gongming was fighting another devil cultivator and saw Qiu Ji approaching, his eyes immediately lit up.

If I can delay him for even a moment, it might earn me some credit!

With that thought in mind, he swung his dharma artifact‚Äîthe Ebony Saber‚Äî in an attempt to intercept Qiu Ji. Unfortunately, since the family had no legacy to help him wield a saber effectively, he could not even manifest proper saber qi.

Qiu Ji, annoyed by the interference, sneered at the audacity of the puny ant whom he could easily crush with a strike of his palm.

"How dare you, vermin!" he roared angrily.

Without hesitation, Qiu Ji unleashed a blast of white qi, which instantly enveloped Xu Gongming's Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifact, shattering it instantly. The white qi also breached his protective mana shield, striking his cheek with devastating force.

As flesh and blood splattered everywhere, Xu Gongming plummeted from midair with a cry, no longer able to maintain his footing. Madam Dou rushed to catch him, attempting to dispel the malevolent qi from his face.

Meanwhile, the Li siblings pressed on, pursuing Qiu Ji. At that moment, An Zheyan, who had received a beating from Zhang Huaide earlier, regained his strength and moved to intercept the hammer-wielding devil cultivator who was in the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

He had always been close to Tian Youdao. Upon seeing the state he was in, An Zheyan's rage boiled over as he yelled out in anguish, "SCOUNDREL!"

An Zheyan, at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, forced the devil cultivator back with a powerful palm strike, gaining an overwhelming advantage. The devil cultivator spat out blood at the impact, now too disoriented to even take flight.

BOOM!

The combined efforts of the group quickly overwhelmed the devil cultivator. They battered him into a bloody mess and incinerated him with a barrage of fire spells, reducing him to a charred heap.

Tian Zhongqing had already descended to his uncle's side. Tian Youdao's bloody chest was no longer moving, and was lying on the ground with a pallid face.

The hammer had struck him squarely in the chest, causing his eyes to bulge and the area around them to turn purple. He had also broken several bones when he plummeted from the sky and hit the ground with extreme force. The once venerable old man now lay limp and paralyzed in his nephew's arms, blood staining the ground all around him.

On the other side, one of the people fighting Kongheng shouted, "Hey, Zhang has fled!"

"Damn it, let's retreat too!"

These two brothers, who had been fighting Kongheng half-heartedly, quickly apologized to him before also escaping.

The last devil cultivator, Zhang Mutong, faced the worst fate. The blood wind he summoned was instantly shattered by Shamoli's lightning, and he was not as powerful as Qiu Ji and so failed to take flight several times. The members of the Li Family closed in on him and brandished their dharma artifacts fiercely.

All sorts of dharma artifacts and spells rained down on him instantly. His red-glazed beads deflected some attacks, but Shamoli's persistent strikes kept disrupting his blood wind, preventing his escape.

Zhang Mutong endured a few more breaths than the other devil Qi Cultivators. In his desperate struggle, he managed to injure a few more people before finally being dismembered. After being incinerated by fire and struck by lightning, he was completely dead.

As the situation settled, Li Yuanjiao and his sister returned as well. However, Li Yuanjiao looked pretty upset to have come back empty-handed.

Qiu Ji had been incredibly ruthless, using every secret spell at his disposal to escape. Despite their River Crossing Torrential Step, which was adept at evasion, it proved less effective against Qiu Ji's relentless escape tactics. Even with their skills, they struggled to find a way to secure his capture.

As they strayed further and further away from home, they eventually had to give up and turn back, fearing that the enemy would lead them into a trap.

"My lord..."

Among the injured, Li Xuanxuan and Tian Zhongqing fared worse, but Li Xuanxuan was doing slightly better since he had the support of his monkey. Tian Zhongqing, however, held Tian Youdao's corpse with tears streaming down his face.

Xu Gongming had lost consciousness. Half of his face was reduced to exposed bone, presenting a truly horrifying sight. Despite the severe disfigurement, he sustained no further serious injuries. His dharma artifact had absorbed much of the attack's force, which was already weakened in the first place due to Qiu Ji's injuries.

Among the guest cultivators, Li Qilang and An Zheyan were the least injured and were tending to the others on-site. Madam Dou cradled Li Xuanxuan, who appeared extremely aged, in her arms. At that moment, they looked like father and daughter instead.

While everyone was tending to their wounds, Xiao Guiluan approached her husband and announced softly, "Elder Tian has fallen."

Li Yuanjiao tightened his grip on the Foundation Establishment Realm talisman in his sleeve as he watched Granduncle Tian lying lifelessly on the ground. Standing with his sword in hand, he could not bear to look at Tian Zhongqing's pained expression and sent Li Qinghong to console him instead.

About an hour later, as the sky began to dim, Li Qilang handed two storage pouches to Li Yuanjiao, and then approached Tian Zhongqing to offer a few words of comfort before leaving him to grieve in silence.

Kongheng approached silently with his staff, the copper rings on it jingling with each step he took. Li Yuanjiao, overwhelmed with complex emotions and still grappling with his own suspicions, lowered his gaze.

"Many thanks for your help, monk."

Kongheng shook his head slightly, then walked over to Tian Youdao's limp body. He quietly recited a few sutra verses, as if offering a blessing for the deceased.

However, Tian Zhongqing suddenly raised his head and let out a loud wail.

"Go away, bald donkey! Nothing good happens when you guys are around!" he shouted in anguish.

However, Kongheng remained unruffled. He retreated a few steps, then addressed Li Yuanjiao warmly, "I will be cultivating at the little island near the lake. If your esteemed clan needs anything, they may come find me there."

With that said, he rode the wind and swiftly departed. The remaining people began taking their leave too as the hues of the crimson sunset and the blood-stained ground overlapped with each other. Li Qinghong offered a few more words of comfort to Tian Zhongqing who then picked up Tian Youdao's body, and apologized to Li Yuanjiao before he left.

In the forest, only the core members of the Li Family remained.

Li Yuanjiao stood alone. Li Xuanxuan coughed slightly before wiping the trail of blood from the corner of his mouth.

"There is no fault in choosing and weighing the costs..."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slowly, gripping the green and white Qingche Sword tightly.

"I understand. As I hold this sword, it is only right that I prioritize the clan's interests above all else, even if it means bearing dirt and grudges."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Tian Youdao, younger brother to Tian Yun, was Li Xuanfeng and Li Jingtian's uncle. He was an elder of significant status in the Li Family and one of the few who had broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. His death at the hands of the devil cultivators was a significant loss.

The funeral ceremony was simple. Apart from the immediate Li and Tian families, the other guests showed little grief and some even felt a sense of relief.

The battle had killed two devil cultivators, one of whom was a mid-stage Qi Cultivator. Naturally, the Qi Cultivators in the family were too excited by the prospects of the spoils to be mourning at the moment.

Meanwhile at the central hall in Lijing Town, where the head of the Li Family, Li Yuanping, who handled the family affairs, also served as the center of the Li Family's secular power. Originally magnificent, the hall now showed its age, with worn bricks on the steps visibly marking the passage of time.

Since the Li Family had been accused of indulgence and luxury, Li Yuanping had not made any attempts to repair the building and simply used it as it was. Today, it was Li Yuanjiao who occupied the seat, all dressed in white, with two storage pouches before him.

An ordinary Qi Cultivator typically carried only about ten Spirit Stones on them, with a net worth ranging from thirty to forty stones. However, they had seized a total of forty-six Spirit Stones from these two devil cultivators alone. Even the Li Family would struggle to produce this amount of wealth within such a short time.

Of the eleven cultivators who participated in the battle, five were direct family members. Xu Gongming and Tian Zhongqing, both at the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and severely injured, earned three Spirit Stones for contributing the most. Li Qilang received two.

The old monkey and Shamoli, who were at the mid-stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, acquired two Spirit Stones each. An Zheyan, at the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, received six. Ten more were allocated as Tian Youdao's death gratuity, and the remaining eighteen were confiscated.

The external guest cultivators eagerly stepped forward to receive their share. Xu Gongming, disfigured and concealing his appearance with a mask, smiled despite his condition.

When Tian Zhongqing approached to claim the substantial sum of thirteen Spirit Stones, Li Yuanjiao personally gave him a few bottles of medicine and asked him softly, "With Grand Uncle's passing, is this gratuity received by Tian Rong, his only son?"

Tian Zhongqing, having already composed himself, quickly responded in a respectful manner.

"Old Master, Tian Rong has always tended to mistreat maidservants... During the mourning period, he became heavily intoxicated and was secretly killed by several maidservants with a hairpin in the dead of night. It seems this sum will likely be claimed by the eldest and legitimate grandson, Tian Ling."

"Oh."

The external guest cultivators showed no surprise. Tian Youdao's only son was considered a disappointment; he not only lacked good judgment but also got into conflicts with multiple families. Even the king of Mount Yue, Li Jiman, harbored deep disdain for him. It was Tian Youdao's deep affection for his son that led him to protect him at all costs.

Now that Tian Youdao had been dead for half a month, any discussion of his death was overshadowed by the good karma he had accumulated during his lifetime. Whether his death was disgraceful or not was of little concern, and even Tian Zhongqing himself showed no interest in determining who was responsible.

Li Yuanjiao stroked his beard and sighed.

"Since Granduncle is no longer around and has left behind this orphan, we will send him to the mountains for cultivation. From now on, the responsibility for his training will fall under the main family."

"Understood!"

Tian Zhongqing bowed and the guest cultivators began to withdraw, heading toward the town's tavern amidst their happy chatters.

Li Qinghong, who was observing the situation, realized that Li Yuanjiao's actions and compensation were also a form of a test. "I need to send someone west to inform Aunt Jingtian," she said, feeling somewhat disheartened.

"I've already done that," Li Yuanjiao replied, dismissing the blood qi, resentment qi, and cultivation technique on his desk. He picked up the hammer and the glazed beads, both of which were low-grade Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts. The hammer was unremarkable and could be sold off easily.

"This string of red glazed beads is a valuable dharma artifact... The runes within are quite profound; they can release mana light for protection. It'll be useful for the juniors," he remarked thoughtfully.

With a flick of his wrist, a red light was released from the beads, which was accompanied by a flowing neutralizing force. Li Yuanjiao assessed its power and determined it could neutralize most early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm spells.

"How about calling it..." Li Yuanjiao mumbled as he began thinking of a name for it.

Li Qinghong, concerned that he might come up with something uncreative like Red Light Beads or Crimson Light Beads, quickly interjected with a smile.

"I see that the beads are made of Rouge Glaze. They share the hue of dusk and hold all sorts of runes in them... Why not name it Glazed Dusk?"

Li Yuanjiao thought for a moment, then nodded in agreement.

"Good. Send it to Xijun."

The remaining items were mostly spirit items and Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts of unknown origins, and likely plundered from others. Altogether, they were worth about ten Spirit Stones. Since Li Yuanjiao had recently sold a batch of spirit items and dharma artifacts in the family vault, these truly helped.

Combining all the Spirit Stones he had gathered, Li Yuanjiao finally accumulated one hundred and twenty pieces together. He handed them to Li Qinghong with a sigh of relief.

"Please take these to the Yuan Family, sister."

Li Qinghong nodded. Li Yuanjiao hesitated briefly before taking out the bluish-gray mirror which he handed over respectfully. He then retrieved the Foundation Establishment Realm talisman and continued, "I'm worried that Zhang Huaide and Qiu Ji might still be plotting against us and could ambush you on the road... It would be better for you to make the trip with the mirror, just in case."

As he watched Li Qinghong depart on the wind, Li Yuanjiao took a deep breath. Counting the days, he took out a Jade Sprout Pill and murmured quietly to himself.

"It's time to cultivate in seclusion and break through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm..."

Upon riding the wind and returning to Mount Wutu, he saw Xiao Guiluan standing in the courtyard, smiling and gazing at him. Li Yuanjiao was puzzled but did not expect to see her phoenix eyes crinkle up as she said warmly, "It's time for you to think of a name again!"

Having been husband and wife for many years, they shared a deep bond and understood each other well without words. Seeing Xiao Guiluan caressing her tummy, realization immediately dawned upon Li Yuanjiao.

"WHAT?!"

He was both astonished and delighted. They already had a son when he was an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, and now that they were both Qi Cultivators, the chances of having a child were even slimmer. He never expected much while bedding his wife, treating it as a way to bond with her.
ùòßùëüùëíùëíùò∏ùò¶ùò£ùëõùëúùò∑ùëíùìÅ.ùò§ùò∞ùìÇ

Xiao Guiluan's unexpected pregnancy was joyous news to him. Laughing heartily, he kissed his wife and replied, "I wonder if it's going to be a boy or a girl... This child is truly a late arrival!"

After spending a tender moment together, Li Yuanjiao focused on preparing for his breakthrough.
