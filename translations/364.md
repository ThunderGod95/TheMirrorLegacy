# Chapter 450: Lying In Wait

Yang Xiao'er smiled as she stepped closer and quietly replied, "My family's ancestor also praised him, saying he was a heroic, kind, and amiable man... It took him only thirty years to establish his foundation, and all four of his sons are remarkable talents..."

Yang Xiao'er spoke with unmistakable respect, perhaps influenced by her affection for Li Xizhi which in turn fostered her positive impression on the elders of the Li Family.

Li Xizhi, however, was surprised as he listened.

How is this possible? I-It's... been nearly a hundred years... My great ancestor was merely a mortal! How could Yang Tianya possibly remember him...? What is the meaning of this?!

Li Xizhi had read the Internal History before and knew all the truths.

Although it was not surprising for her to say that great grandfather was talented... What did she mean by kind and amiable? It would be a better compliment to say that he was cunning and bold! Not many in my family are kind and amiable... Yang Tianya... This Yang Tianya!

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Li Xizhi could only laugh and say, "He was not as accomplished as Old Ancestor Tianya who... after his recent breakthrough, must be nearing the peak of Foundation Establishment, with the Purple Mansion Realm soon within reach!"

"It won't be that easy," Yang Xiao'er simply muttered, her gaze drifting toward the distant sky as she added softly, "The Lixia Immortals are coming."

Li Xizhi followed her gaze and spotted a large gray boat in the air. A middle-aged man who was clad in snow-white fox fur with slightly elongated eyes stood calmly at the bow against the breeze.

"Man on Mount Feather, Xiao Yongling!"

Xiao Yongling carried an unassuming aura and did not appear particularly exceptional, yet he commanded respect and admiration. After all, he had fought three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators alone in Yuyuan Market, preserving the most prosperous hub for the Xiao Family and earning himself a formidable reputation throughout Yue State.

This battle had left Xiao Yongling gravely injured, but thanks to the Xiao Family's treasured panaceas, not only was he saved, but his strength also greatly increased.

Now standing at the bow of the boat, he offered a light nod and smile to Li Xizhi, who hurriedly returned the gesture while Yang Xiao'er cupped her fist respectfully.

She mused, Rumor has it that Man on Mount Feather and Celestial Moon Sword knew each other for a long time and were close... So it must be true then!

After a brief wait, cultivators from the three sects and seven gates arrived. As Daoist Master Yuan Su and Daoist Master Qiushui stepped out of thin air, colorful lights of their divine abilities began to rise. Above Mount Dongli, a gap soon appeared in the sky, revealing collapsed pavilions and mountain peaks.

The disciples moved in an orderly procession through the gap, disappearing swiftly into the skies. From Mount Dongli, rich spiritual qi poured forth and spiritual energy surged powerfully. Streams of spiritual qi descended from the void, causing the spirit water to churn and the spirit flames to flare. This disturbance roused the rogue and devil cultivators, who had been lying in wait on the mountain, into action.

An hour later, the air was filled with dust, debris, and fragments of pavilions raining down as the rogue cultivators erupted into cheers.

"The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven has fallen into the sea!"

Meanwhile on Mount Qingdu...

Li Yuanjiao emerged, riding the wind as Moongaze Lake celebrated his breakthrough with rainfall. He navigated through the mist, shrouding the lake in mist. He glided through it, feeling free and unrestrained.

As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Li Yuanjiao enjoyed a noble status. Such a breakthrough would leave anyone beaming with joy, and he had not felt this proud in many years. Soaring above the Fei Family's territory, he gazed at the bright stars, having left Yue State and arrived in Xu State.

This area, governed by the Yue Cultivating Sect, was considered very safe. Beyond it lay the wild hills—a far more perilous route avoided by most cultivators. Given the dangers near Mount Dongli, Li Yuanjiao preferred to take a longer detour.

The night deepened, yet he did not dim his mana light. He was secretly hoping to encounter some devil or rogue cultivators to rob, thereby replenishing his dwindling storage pouch.

In such a wilderness and armed with the mirror, Li Yuanjiao was naturally eager for such encounters.

Unfortunately, the cultivators in the mountains were mostly of the Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realms—who were wise enough not to provoke a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. After an uneventful flight that lasted several days, Li Yuanjiao finally arrived at the territory of Profound Peak Gate.

The mountain gate of Profound Peak loomed like a giant bear hibernating in the morning sun, intimidating yet awe-inspiring. Reflecting on Daoist Master Changxi's achievements of moving the mountain all the way from Xu State, Li Yuanjiao felt a flicker of yearning for the Purple Mansion Realm.

How many more years must my family wait before we produce someone of such caliber...?

As he prepared to ride the wind around the mountain, a female cultivator dressed in a light-yellow dharma robe soared into the sky and halted him in his flight. She cupped her fist respectfully and asked softly, "Kong Tingyun from Profound Peak greets fellow Daoist... May I ask which peak you represent?"

Her discerning eyes immediately recognized the extraordinary nature of the Qingche Sword behind Li Yuanjiao. Coupled with his Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit, he appeared rather majestic amidst the clouds and fog, leading her to assume he was a cultivator of high standing from one of the three sects and seven gates.

Li Yuanjiao returned the gesture, responding in a deep voice.

"I am Li Yuanjiao of the Li Family from Lijing... Pleased to meet you, fellow Daoist!"

"Ah, the Sword Immortal Clan," Kong Tingyun noted with admiration, then added softly, "What brings you to our territory? I'd be happy to assist in any way I can."

Knowing it was imprudent to reveal his true intentions, Li Yuanjiao simply stated, "I seek passage to the estuary of the Great River... I wonder if Profound Peak could facilitate this...?"

Upon hearing his request, Kong Tingyun chuckled softly. Her eyes glinted as she responded, "If Brother Jiao has come here seeking the treasures of Dongli, I'm afraid you'd be disappointed!"

"Hmm?"

Li Yuanjiao maintained his composure though his motives were quickly discerned by this woman, and simply smiled.

"Why do you say that?" he asked.

Kong Tingyun explained, "Brother Jiao is smart enough to think of navigating the Profound Peak's territories to reach the sea, but each family's land here is well-fortified. Wherever rogue cultivators descended, they fall under the jurisdiction of that sect."

"Not just in Profound Peak, but also among the Sword Sect, Red Reef, and Snow Ji. All Dao lineages are united and have set up ambushes. No rogue cultivator would be able to slip through," she added.

She continued gently, emphasizing, "The Dongli Sect has left behind many valuables, including dharma relics and the Dao lineage of Daoist Master Cui Mu of Dongli. Even if they decay, they will do so within the confines of Yue State—it's absolutely impossible for them to reach the eastern sea. Two groups have already come seeking these treasures, and both were turned away by Profound Peak..."

Upon hearing this, Li Yuanjiao chuckled self-deprecatingly and shrugged as he replied, "It seems the world is full of clever people... small schemes are indeed laughable."

Observing his unruffled demeanor, Kong Tingyun's regard for him grew. She smiled faintly and offered a word of advice.

"This matter is highly confidential. While I can't divulge too much, Brother Jiao should know that the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven is under close watch...

"Don't be fooled by the joy of the rogue and devil cultivators. Anything they touch, anyone they meet, and all traces they leave within three days of departing Dongli are monitored. The ordinary items will be overlooked, but nothing of the Purple Mansion Realm will be able to slip through..."

Li Yuanjiao felt a chill down his spine as he nodded slowly. Kong Tingyun, mistaking his reaction for prior knowledge, exclaimed, "Forgive me for flaunting my knowledge, I have forgotten about the close ties between the Xiao and Li families!"

Li Yuanjiao reassured her repeatedly, and Kong Tingyun, looking at his Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, hesitated briefly before saying, "Actually, there is a small matter for which I might require Brother Jiao's assistance..."

"What is it?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

Kong Tingyun explained, "I was guarding one of the estuaries a few years ago and once encountered a Foundation Establishment Realm demonic creature in Lake Xian that is linked to the sea... Unfortunately, I wasn't strong enough to vanquish it alone. I am the only Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator on Yunyue Peak so... could I hire Brother Jiao to assist me?"

Li Yuanjiao's suspicions arose, and he replied tactfully, "Your sect has many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... Why not seek their help?"

Kong Tingyun pursed her lips and answered, "There are many factions within the sect, and not all get along harmoniously... I have always stayed neutral and don't want to be seen as favoring any particular peak..."

This explanation slightly alleviated Li Yuanjiao's doubts. With the mirror in his possession, he felt confident in his abilities, and besides, knowing Profound Peak Gate's good reputation, he could not help but ask, "What kind of demonic creature is it?"

Kong Tingyun looked up with bright eyes and explained, "It is a Hooked Serpent that resides at the bottom of Lake Xian. It fled there after losing a battle to the Azure Water Serpent Dragon of Wave Island in the sea... I wish to obtain the two hooks on the snake's tail."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, then answered with a smile, "I do have time to assist, but I must visit an old friend along the way first."

Kong Tingyun nodded slightly and said softly, "That's fine! I await your arrival in Profound Peak."

After a brief chat, Li Yuanjiao departed on the wind. Kong Tingyun watched him disappear into the sky and paused among the clouds, musing to herself.

"What a cautious person he is..."

————

Leaving the Shanji Prefecture of Profound Peak Gate, Li Yuanjiao found a deserted mountain in a remote area and landed there. Reluctant to use his Qingche Sword, he summoned his mana to form a cave dwelling. After setting up a simple Embryonic Breathing Realm formation around it, he settled down and began to cultivate in silence.

He had no old friends in the northern Yue State; he had only mentioned that to Kong Tingyun as a precaution—to let her know that someone knew of his whereabouts, should he meet an untimely end.

Sitting in the cave, he thought to himself, Although the estuary is currently under the control of the Profound Peak Gate, that doesn't mean I can't intercept someone midway... Even if it's not as busy as the estuary, catching one or two passersby would be worthwhile.

I'll spend some time cultivating on this deserted mountain path and see if I'll find one or two trying to escape... If it's a devil cultivator, I'll take them down with a palm strike, and if it's a rogue cultivator... I'll assess the situation further.

After waiting a day, the distant surge of spiritual qi and energy signaled the fall of a grotto heaven. Estimating the time it would take for those from Mount Dongli to reach here, Li Yuanjiao then closed his eyes and cultivated for over a day before taking out the mirror. He invoked it, activating its ability that allowed his consciousness to travel between heaven and earth.

Xianjian's current range of vision was vast, covering an entire county's land. It encompassed not only the large area from Yufu Prefecture to Shanji Prefecture but also the border city of Yufu Prefecture and a considerable portion of Shanji Prefecture.

The range of the immortal mirror now spanned an entire prefecture, covering a vast expanse within Yufu Prefecture and Shanji Prefecture. In fact, it even provided clear views of Yufu Prefecture's border town and half of Shanji Prefecture.

With a quick scan, Li Yuanjiao detected three mana lights and seven blood lights weaving through the chaotic wilderness mountains. Without further hesitation, he emerged from the formation and flew toward the nearest devil cultivator.

As soon as he crossed over a mountain, sure enough, he spotted two devil cultivators cautiously flying close to the ground, attempting to conceal their presence. However, they were starkly exposed under the scrutiny of the immortal mirror.

One late-stage and one early-stage Qi Cultivators...

Li Yuanjiao suppressed his aura and approached stealthily, his sword in hand. When he was within the range of the cultivators' spiritual senses, he suddenly leaped up and executed the River Crossing Torrential Step, launching an attack.

The devil cultivator barely managed to exclaim "Who?!" before Li Yuanjiao was upon him. He was a middle-aged man wielding a skeletal dharma artifact.

"A Foundation Establishment cultivator?!" he exclaimed in shock.

The greenish-gray serpent dragon coiling around Li Yuanjiao's body surged forward, striking the face of the early-stage female Qi Cultivator fiercely. His Qingche Sword unleashed a greenish-white sword aura that left the man dazed.

Clang!

The Law of Celestial Moon was a lethal move combined with the ambush. The man could not even manage to cast a spell or reach for another dharma artifact in his storage pouch in time. Within moments, his head was sent flying and his body exploded.

Li Yuanjiao collected the man's storage pouch in the shower of blood before stepping forward to crush the severed head aside and casually cast a fire spell, reducing the man to ashes without giving him a chance to defend himself.

Turning around, he saw that the dragon serpent had devoured half of the female devil cultivator's body. Her face was pale—clearly lifeless. Li Yuanjiao frowned, activating his immortal foundation to make the serpent dragon spit her out. After collecting the storage pouch from her body as well, he destroyed the corpse with a spell.

These two bear a resemblance... they must be father and daughter.

The devil cultivator's severed skeletal dharma artifact that had been destroyed by his sword aura continued spewing resentment and blood qi. Li Yuanjiao swiftly picked it up and flew to the next blood light.

Arriving at the destination, he found it eerily empty, despite the mirror's earlier detection of a devil cultivator. He happily speculated, "A dharma artifact that can conceal presence...?"

As soon as Li Yuanjiao voiced this thought, the cunning devil cultivator soared upward, hurling a jade bottle with intricate patterns at the distant ground. From his other sleeve, he flung a blood-colored talisman.

Li Yuanjiao sneered as the serpent dragon coiled around his body and sprang into action, swiftly capturing the jade bottle lying on the ground. With a swift wave of his sleeve, he obliterated the blood-colored talisman in front of him and went in pursuit of the fleeing devil cultivator.

The devil cultivator produced another jade bottle in desperation and exclaimed, "Senior! This is the Profound Yang Radiant Fire!"

He smacked the bottle, sending it flying to the ground while simultaneously tossing his storage pouch aside. Without wasting another moment that would allow Li Yuanjiao to unsheathe his sword, he quickly clasped his hands together and performed a hand seal to cast a spell.

Profound Yang Radiant Fire!

Li Yuanjiao caught the jade bottle with one hand and drew his sword with the other. However, the devil cultivator had already unleashed his secret technique, transforming his entire body and facial features into blood. Surging blood flames enveloped his ghostly pale head as it flew away at a speed surpassing that of typical Qi Cultivators.

Clang!

Green and white sword arc from Li Yuanjiao's Celestial Moon Slash technique whistled through the air, blowing the man's head up. The blood flames had fizzled into black smoke before pieces of the poor man's head could even touch the ground.

How ruthless... You could have escaped if your opponent were any other early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator!

Li Yuanjiao marveled at his own decisive actions, grateful for the supremacy of his sword which had narrowly prevented the cultivator's escape.

"Drat!"

While he was engaging with the man, the remaining devil and rogue cultivators had long fled. None of them were visible through the immortal mirror. Li Yuanjiao landed to collect the discarded storage pouch, stashing it swiftly into his chest pocket.

Without further delay, he soared on the winds, tracing the predicted route of the fleeing cultivators. Soon enough, he spotted a rogue cultivator flying cautiously on the wind.

"Excellent!"

Pleased, fog swirled on his face, concealing Li Yuanjiao's face as he descended in front of the man and bluntly made his demands.

"Storage pouch."

The rogue cultivator jumped like a frightened bird. After scanning with his spiritual sense, his legs buckled as he landed, hastily untying the storage pouch from his waist with a pitiful plea.

"Senior, s-spare me! Everything I have is here!"

Noting the kneeling rogue cultivator's shaky voice but stable hand on the ground, Li Yuanjiao chuckled. He took the pouch, laughing hoarsely as he mocked, "No mediocre cultivator could escape from Mount Dongli. Drop the act... You're just afraid I'll kill you."

The rogue cultivator's heart pounded as he repeatedly pressed his forehead to the ground. Li Yuanjiao peered into the pouch, finding only a Yang Nourishing Technique—a cultivation method from Dongli Sect, a portion of Fire Baleful Qi, and nothing else useful save for a bunch of insignificant items owned by the rogue cultivator.
