# Chapter 795: Purple Geng Broad Valley

Li Xuanxuan arrived at the main hall. The lamps within were blazing brightly. Li Zhouluo was still present, having apparently just finished handling administrative affairs, and was now cultivating a Dharma Art. He formed a seal, and five or six dazzling golden rays circled his fingers, emitting a piercing shriek.

The moment the elder arrived, the young man opened his eyes, halted the Dharma Art, and descended from the main seat.

"Elder, you've arrived," he said respectfully.

Li Xuanxuan nodded, coughed, and replied, "You've worked hard these days... The West Bank affair is troublesome. You are caught between several branches with no one you truly trust. It's a difficult position... Have you heard about Li Xixuan's situation?"

Li Zhouluo bowed. "This is this junior's duty. As for the elder's matter... there have been some grievances on the isle recently. However, they are not directed at you, Elder. Most of the blame is aimed at Mount Qingdu, claiming it harbors treacherous villains who are sowing discord in the clan."

He led Li Xuanxuan to a seat nearby. "I have read the letter you sent me a few days ago, Elder. The situation is indeed thorny."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head. "When the ancestors set the rules, they decreed that if main branch disciples lacked spiritual apertures, they could not serve as officials or merchants. But the isle is rich in spiritual energy, and the main branch holds a respected status. These children do not separate from the family and continue living on the isle. They want to maintain their main branch status while also gaining favor to enter official posts... I’ve thought it over and over. These two prohibitions cannot be relaxed. If they enter the shore territories carrying the title of a main branch direct descendant, even a fool sitting in that post would have people lining up to deliver money... to say nothing of the harm a few cunning ones could do. That would be ruinous."

Only after Li Xuanxuan had firmly stated his position did Li Zhouluo speak in a low voice. "Junior has also reflected on this recently. The isle is indeed too idle. Everyone is living right under Mount Qingdu's watch, which isn't comfortable. Those two rules absolutely cannot be relaxed. But we can compensate elsewhere. We can loosen the oversight on finances... It’s hard to criticize them for receiving some wealth from their cultivator siblings. Yet, the competitive methods used against external families cannot be applied to them, or it will harm the peace between the four branches. They are mortals, after all. There is no harm in letting them enjoy some comforts."

Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan replied in a weary voice, "You must not underestimate mortals. These people are the future parents of cultivators. I fear we are fostering a trend of extravagance... The clan rules must be changed, but they cannot be changed by you... You are the sole seedling of the Fourth branch. If you offend the clansmen, your entire branch will be isolated."

Li Zhouluo hadn't considered that point. He nodded slightly, listening intently as the elder continued.

"The plan now is to placate them for a few years and ensure you can step down from your post intact, preferably having earned a benevolent reputation. This is crucial so that the Fourth branch can maintain close relations with the other three branches in the future."

Dili Guang had already withdrawn. Li Zhouluo personally served the elder tea as Li Xuanxuan continued.

"How many people are currently receiving favor?"

Li Zhouluo replied, "I have strictly followed the clan rules and not granted favor easily. I only granted it to the orphans of a few uncles and brothers who died in battle. The remaining mortal clan members pleaded relentlessly. My heart softened somewhat, and after careful consideration, I arranged some very minor official posts for them..."

He did not expose Zhoufang and his brother, claiming only that his own heart had softened. Li Xuanxuan sipped his tea and replied:

"Tomorrow morning, you will bring men to my courtyard to plead on Li Xixuan's behalf. Make sure to bring Zhoufang; I see he has been very anxious lately... After pleading, you will retrieve Li Xixuan."

Li Zhouluo respectfully agreed. The elder continued, "Once you bring him back to this hall, you will announce that you cannot bear to see your brothers and sisters suffer and have already considered the matter of granting favor and promoting mortals."

"Let Mount Qingdu handle the selection. Use a secret inspection method. Assess candidates based on their character, their parents' merits, their knowledge, and their loyalty and piety. Promote the descendants and observe them for three years. Announce the list at the sacrificial ceremony three years from now."

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouluo. The elder continued, "Do not mention the number of positions in the list. First, keep them settled for a few years. After three years, having promoted individuals from every branch, you can step down from your position. Earning their reputation is enough. Then we wait for Li Jiangqian to come out and play the villain... That child is fierce, ruthless, and clever. He isn't afraid of offending anyone. They will have their hands full."

Li Zhouluo felt complete admiration for the elder. Few in the clan understood his awkward predicament. Li Xuanxuan was, as always, the one elder who genuinely considered his welfare. Deeply moved, he replied, "Thank you, Elder."

Li Xuanxuan nodded. "Although the isle is united in intent, few are willing to take the lead. Of the four who troubled you that day, Li Chengzhi and Xi'e are easily pacified. Li Xixuan is currently locked up. Only Li Chenghao is stubborn. He cares deeply for the clansmen and acts with seasoned cunning. It would be best to send him away. The rest will then be a dragon without a head."

"Although I arrived in secret, I have already shown my face. The isle will soon know. You understand what to say... I don't need..."

He was halfway through his sentence when the sound of hurried footsteps came from outside the hall. Dili Guang's voice was urgent. "Patriarch, an urgent report from the isle."

Li Zhouluo glanced at Li Xuanxuan, who nodded. "Bring it in."

Dili Guang strode forward, bowed to both men, and reported respectfully, "Young Master Zhouming has arrived on the isle. He went to the courtyard of the Yuanwan Branch and caused a huge disturbance. Tonight, the clansmen invited elders from other branches, and they were wailing in the courtyard. The Young Master cursed them until they fled in all directions. The several elders are extremely embarrassed."

Li Zhouluo was stunned. Li Xuanxuan, however, showed no surprise. He rose from his seat and said flatly, "That monster stirs up trouble everywhere. You and I will go and capture him right now."

Li Zhouluo understood the elder was going over to back Zhouming up. He nodded. "Elder, please..."

The two rode the wind together, swiftly descending upon a residence on the isle. It was a large, antique-style complex. The central courtyard was in chaos. Several middle-aged men stood there, their faces flushed red amid the uproar.

Zhouming, dressed in red robes, was instead sitting calmly in the main courtyard, his fan resting beside him, a faint smile on his face. Surrounded by the furious yet silent expressions of the crowd, he truly looked the part of a dissolute aristocratic scion.

When Li Xuanxuan and Li Zhouluo landed in the courtyard, a wave of exclamation erupted. Everyone dropped to their knees. Zhouming also leaped from his seat and bowed. "Greetings, Ancestor! Greetings, Patriarch!"

Li Xuanxuan swept his gaze over the scene. "You're causing trouble again! With so many elders present, what right do you have to speak? Yet here you are, lecturing your brothers."

Zhouming quickly replied, "Ancestor, I was just passing this place when I heard weeping from the courtyard. I suspected that perhaps Grand-uncle Li Xixuan was advanced in age and this was a funeral. Only after listening did I learn that Grand-uncle Li Xixuan has gone to live on Mount Qingdu..."

He crossed his arms and said angrily, "When I saw them rushing to divide the family property, holding a funeral mourning in advance, this fire in my heart... I just couldn't stop it..."

"You... You're spouting venom!" a middle-aged man nearby flushed crimson again.

Zhouming laughed. "It's not dividing property? Then what is it?"

Chaos erupted. Li Chenghao immediately stepped forward, pulling the two sides apart and silencing them. He glared at the surrounding people until everyone in the courtyard finally shut their mouths.

Li Chenghao was one of the few remaining cultivators of the Chengming generation. Besides the two at the Foundation Establishment Realm, he had the highest cultivation. His two brothers had gone with him to the river, but he was the only one to return. He had even lost an arm, which Li Ximing had later restored.

Now, his daughter had also died in Funan. He was a man of great hardship and merit, seasoned by the vicissitudes of the world. He was beyond comparison to this group of people who only lived on the isle.

'The Elder is playing favorites. Arguing with Zhouming will achieve nothing; he'll just turn the questions back on us. I must seize the current situation.'

He raised his brows and bowed. "Elder, Young Master Zhouming has caused a disturbance in the courtyard without reason, insulting his elders and clansmen. I request he be handed over to Mount Qingdu."

But Li Xuanxuan was even more cunning. He immediately nodded and replied, "Correct. Come... escort the Young Master to Mount Qingdu."

Dili Guang quickly stepped up and escorted Zhouming away. The young man snapped his fan shut and departed resentfully.

Li Xuanxuan coughed, reaching out to help Li Chenghao up. He spoke warmly, "It's good you are here, child. I was just looking for you. I have an important clan matter to entrust to you."

Although Li Chenghao was stubborn, he deeply respected Li Xuanxuan. Hearing this, he quickly rose and followed him out respectfully, leaving the courtyard full of people exchanging glances. Some wanted to leave, some turned to Li Zhouluo to plead their case, and others began apologizing for the trouble.

Li Xuanxuan had dissipated the storm in the courtyard with just two sentences. Taking Li Chenghao out was also not a spur-of-the-moment decision.

Once outside the courtyard, the elder walked for a moment and sighed. "Child, Li Minggong and Li Chenghuai are both in seclusion. There aren't many elders left in the clan, so many things must fall on your shoulders... The Profound Peak Gate has relocated, Cui Jueyin has returned to the isle, and the various families of the Eastern shore and the wilderness beyond are all in Jiangxia's hands. The authority of the Milin Mountains to command the Eastern shore cannot be left vacant. I must ask you to make a trip and take charge of the palace affairs in his stead."

This was a task that was both demanding and offered little reward. But Li Chenghao flicked his robes and dropped to the ground with a thud. His voice was exceptionally low. "If the Lake commands, Chenghao will not shirk death! But Ancestor, please do not send me away just to stabilize the island..."

He knocked his head heavily on the ground. "When my clan uncle made his move, this junior only acted to protect Chengpan. But this situation in the clan is definitely wrong, and it must be changed. Our Moongaze Li clan is raising a flock of idle mouths on this isle, a bunch of Purple Mansion immortal descendants who only farm! What decency is there... It must be changed, Elder..."

Li Xuanxuan helped him up. "I know your heart. You also grew up in the courtyard with Li Chengliao and the others. Otherwise, you wouldn't have fought so desperately in the north back then. No one of the Chengming generation is a coward. This is what I am thinking... Take the younger generation of the clan... those who dare to fight, especially those without elder backing, take them all with you. Let them follow you, learn, and see the world..."

"Thank you, Elder!" Li Chenghui nodded repeatedly.

Li Xuanxuan offered a few more words of comfort and sent him off. He stood there, clasping his sleeves, taking a breath and releasing it. He leaned against a lacquered wooden pillar of the corridor, gazing at the night scenery. Patches of purple qi were visible at the horizon. Just as he was wondering, he saw Dili Guang rushing up.

"Elder," Dili Guang reported, "People from the Purple Smoke Gate have arrived! It’s a large, lively procession, and they are insisting on seeing you."

"So soon!" Li Xuanxuan was both shocked and overjoyed. For a group from the Purple Smoke Gate to arrive at this specific moment, demanding to see him by name, it must be about the formation. He immediately hurried off. Dili Guang's cultivation was lower, and he broke into a sweat trying to keep up.

They reached the main hall in moments. Wen Wu was already waiting, chatting warmly with Li Zhouluo. Seeing Li Xuanxuan, his face lit up with a smile. He retrieved two carp-shaped wooden boxes from his sleeve and laughed. "Senior is as kind and gentle as ever. It warms this junior's heart just to see you... The two children from your clan are doing very well. Li Quexi asked me to bring a letter. I figured since the children are so filial, I made a special trip to Ziqi Peak and brought Li Queyi's letter as well!"

Wen Wu had a very agreeable way of doing things. He passed the letters into Li Xuanxuan's hands. The elder smiled and accepted them. As a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator, he didn't even need to weigh them to feel the significant difference in weight between the boxes. He put them away with a flick of his sleeve and replied, "We have truly troubled you, sir... The children from my family are slow. We must trouble Senior Brother to guide them well."

Wen Wu laughed heartily. "Senior, you may not know, but our Purple Smoke Blessed Land holds an annual competition, with contests separated by cultivation level. Little Junior Sister's Dharma Arts are profound and her reactions are extremely fast. She delightfully secured sixth place in the Embyronic Breathing division and received an award!"

"Everyone in the sect knows she is from the Moongaze Immortal Clan. They all give her a thumbs-up, saying she has the same flair Shen Yanqing had back in the day..."

Li Zhouluo nodded repeatedly and asked, "I wonder how Li Queyi..."

Wen Wu picked up smoothly. "She is also striving hard! Within the sect, the coordination between Dharma Arts and cultivation methods for Qi Refining cultivators is already well-established, and their Dharma artifacts are very powerful. Among all the early-stage Qi Refining cultivators, Li Queyi placed thirty-first, just missing the top thirty. Though regrettable, her 'Celestial Moon Sword Arc' stunned the audience and even made the Peak Lord of Qi Sword Peak raise his eyebrows!"

Wen Wu selected only the pleasant news to share. Li Zhouluo was also pleasantly surprised. "The Purple Smoke Blessed Land is truly formidable. She never grasped it at home, yet she masters it immediately after joining."

Li Xuanxuan smiled and brought the topic back, pointedly ignoring Li Queyi and praising Li Quexi instead. Wen Wu paced and nodded, the pair of gold and white talismans at his waist clinking together.

"Senior," Wen Wu said, "I have come this time regarding the Daoist Master's affairs. I heard from my Peak Lord that the Daoist Master from your esteemed clan entrusted our Blessed Land with a Purple Mansion Grand Formation. After all, the Daoist Master's skill in formations is exquisite. The original plan was to ask the Daoist Master to set it up personally, but a Purple Mansion formation is not the work of a day or two, so we came over first."

He observed the expressions of the two men and continued formally, "The matter of a formation concerns the continuation of a Dao lineage. It is often said it cannot be lightly taught to others. Our Paradise also considered this, which is why we dared not come to build it rashly. Our dispatch this time is to first forge several components related to the formation platform. This timing should allow us to wait for Daoist Master Zhaojing's return. He can inspect everything personally before we proceed to the next step."

His words perfectly displayed the grace of the Supreme Yang Dao lineage. He retrieved a heavy, purple-gold scroll from his sleeve, patterned on both ends with deer, birds, and scripture symbols. He tucked it into his robes first, saying:

"For this task, the Muzuo Peak, Tianzhen Peak, and Cuiging Peak of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land have joined forces. We have dispatched five Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, twenty-seven late-stage Qi Refining cultivators, two master refiners, six artisan refiners, one formation master, and four formation artisans, for a total of thirty-two members, led by myself, Wen Wu , first disciple of Mu Zuo Peak."

He presented the purple-gold scroll to Li Xuanxuan. "Senior, this grand formation requires thirty-two 'Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails.' Each must be one hundred and eighty *ren* long and three *zhang* and two *chi* in circumference. All specifications, runes, and spiritual materials are recorded in this scroll. Please verify them, Senior."
