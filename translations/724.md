# Chapter 724: The Secret of the Essence Gathering Pill

Li Ximing tore through the Great Void and descended upon Gardenia Scenery Mountain. After settling in, he sent a messenger to summon Li Zhouwei and took a seat at a table. Cui Jueyin, not daring to sit, stood respectfully to the side.

As Li Ximing asked a few questions about matters overseas, which Cui Jueyin answered with deference, a figure was seen ascending the mountain path.

The man was tall and lean, radiating a powerful, athletic energy without appearing overly muscular. At a glance, he seemed formidable but not extraordinary. His golden eyes, however, were another matter entirely—one look was enough to inspire a deep-seated awe.

The moment Cui Jueyin saw those golden eyes, his mind went blank.

'An imperial descendant? The Li family of Moongaze Lake has a legitimate bloodline!'

The Cui family might mistake many things, but they could never be wrong about the Wei-Li lineage. The man before him might not be on par with the Crown Prince Li Xunquan of old, but he was certainly at the level of Li Xuan, who had nearly restored their dynasty. Shaken to his core, Cui Jueyin immediately bowed low.

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

Li Zhouwei, who seemed to be in good spirits, did not recognize the man before him. He offered a slight nod and a grunt of acknowledgment, his expression quizzical.

"Minghuang," Li Ximing said with a smile, "this is a direct descendant of the Cui family."

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouwei. "Ah, from the Cui clan," he said, nodding. "There is no need for such ceremony."

Cui Jueyin respectfully stepped aside as another man came up behind Li Zhouwei. This newcomer was a mountain of a man—burly and broad-shouldered, with a pair of golden hammers in his hands.

A hint of pleasure touched Li Zhouwei's face. "Daoist Master, Li Wen has succeeded! He has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

This was indeed Li Wen, who had been in seclusion at the spirit jade mine in the Helin Mountains. Li Ximing's eyebrows shot up. "What a stroke of good fortune!" he exclaimed with a laugh.

And what fortune it was. Among all the Li family members, Li Wen’s breakthrough to Foundation Establishment was a perfect confluence of timing, location, and opportunity. Li Ximing had assessed him long ago; the man’s chances were far slimmer than those of the fallen Li Chengliao, yet he had been the one to succeed.

Li Ximing looked at him with a sense of wonder. "You cultivate the path of Jade True, and your innate talent is comparable to An Zheyan's. A breakthrough should have been beyond your destiny. Yet, during your time as a Qi Refining cultivator, a True Monarch achieved their Dao, causing a surge in the world's jade essence and giving you a sliver of a chance."

"Then you went into seclusion. The family was embroiled in the war between the north and south, and the Essence Gathering Pills that were once unobtainable became available. You were also in the newly discovered spirit jade mine in the Helin Mountains, a place blessed with its own spiritual nexus. Not even a direct disciple of the Azure Pond Sect could ask for better circumstances."

"You were in seclusion for seven years, and the breakthrough must have been incredibly difficult. But then, the master of Mount Changhuai fell. The spiritual feedback from his death, 'Inward Heart Surging Profundity,' was beneficial to the Ancient Merging and Immortal Daos, and especially to those in seclusion. And the path of Jade True is a branch of Ancient Merging. You truly had every advantage!"

Li Wen, a simple and honest man, merely knelt and nodded.

Li Ximing let out a hearty laugh. "With all that, how could you possibly have failed?"

Li Zhouwei smiled and nodded in agreement. Li Wen, in his booming voice, said, "It was all just luck. But the real congratulations belong to you, Daoist Master. One Purple Mansion cultivator on the lake is worth more than a hundred of me."

Li Wen was one of the old guard. Li Ximing remembered seeing him by Li Yuanping’s side since he was a child and recalled the old man's bitter tears when his father had died. The memories warmed his heart, and he felt a surge of genuine delight, repeating, "Excellent, excellent!"

Cui Jueyin watched from the side, taking careful note. Though he was confident this rough-hewn man wouldn't last fifty rounds against him, his close relationship with Li Ximing was clear.

"Jueyin," Li Ximing said, turning to him, "what cultivation art do you practice? What scriptures have you studied? What techniques have you mastered?"

Cui Jueyin quickly replied, "I cultivate the 'Eternal Brightness Steps,' a fifth-grade art. I have studied most of the family's Bright Yang scrolls and have trained in the required magical arts, radiance techniques, ocular arts, and movement skills. Among my peers on the island, I rank in the top three."

He continued, "In combat, demonic and rogue cultivators are no match for me. As long as our Dao paths are not in direct conflict, I can hold my own against mid-stage and even late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. Against noble demon beasts of the same level in the sea, I can fight them to a standstill."

Li Ximing nodded, satisfied. He then instructed Li Wen, "Take this young master of the Cui family down and arrange a place for him to stay on the island."

Cui Jueyin rose to leave, his gaze still lingering on Li Zhouwei.

"Once everything is settled," Li Ximing said with a smile, "you can have a proper talk with my Minghuang."

As the two departed, Li Ximing’s expression grew serious. "This journey was indeed fruitful."

He recounted his gains, taking out the _Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass_ for Li Zhouwei to inspect. "Cui Jueyin is not one to boast," he concluded. "If he says he can 'hold his own,' his strength must be comparable. With his wide range of techniques and deep cultivation, you are likely the only one in the family who can definitively suppress him. If Cheng'e or Weizeng were to fight him, they would be at a disadvantage within a hundred rounds, and in serious danger if the fight went on longer."

Cui Xianye had clearly not been perfunctory. While it wasn't the all-out support of Li Xunquan and Li Xuan's era, he had still sent one of his family's most outstanding disciples.

"The Cui and Li families emerged from the same Wei dynasty," Li Zhouwei said, nodding. "Of the four Wei-Li True Monarchs, the Cui clan claimed two. They have been loyal for generations, a trait that remains even now that they are but a single branch. Their situation is far better than ours." The Cui clan of Chongzhou Island could trace its lineage directly, unlike the Li family, which had to publicly deny its heritage.

Li Zhouwei produced a letter from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing. It was Li Chenghui's report on the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion.

Li Ximing read it carefully, his interest piqued. "Since the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion have a legacy, could they have..."

He was, of course, thinking of the Immortal Mirror fragment he had once obtained from a Secret Diffusion cultivator. He didn't need to say it aloud; Li Zhouwei understood.

"On matters concerning the Purple Mansion, we cannot rely on a single source. This may not be as simple as it appears. Our family has many other priorities at the moment, and this Dharma Artifact is not something that can be dealt with in a year or two. We should observe for now."

"As for Wenhu... he holds the legacy of the Dense Cloud Cave, so we cannot kill him carelessly. Let's place him under house arrest to recover and slowly gather information. If this matter proves true, we won't be without a card to play."

"Proceed as you see fit." Li Ximing had complete faith in Li Zhouwei's judgment. He took out the _Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire_ that Changxi had given him and tasked Li Zhouwei with planning the construction of the high platform.

"What is the status of the Jade Court for the Courtly Red Dust Qi?" he asked.

The _Aged Courtly Path Sutra_ practiced on the lake was also a Purple Mansion art, but its Courtly Red Dust Qi required a massive Jade Court. This was the very reason the Li family had been mining in the Helin Mountains.

"We gathered enough material years ago," Li Zhouwei replied. "The mining operations in the Helin Mountains have ceased. But our family has been in turmoil these past years, and we've had no mind to build any Jade Court. The quarried jade is piled up like mountains, most of it still in the Helin range, not yet transported back."

"Besides," he added, "building this Jade Court is an enormous undertaking that would drain our resources and manpower!"

From Li Zhouwei's tone, Li Ximing understood the issue. When it came to moving mountains and hauling stone, who was better suited than their neighbors at the Profound Peak Gate? It was a simple matter of him giving the word. "That's easily solved," he said. "Write a letter to Kong Guxi and ask him to send some of his Earth Virtue Foundation Establishment cultivators to help us move the materials back. We can then use the immortal foundation to construct the Jade Court. We should use these next three years to get it done."

"Also, ask Kong Guxi for a handwritten letter from Changxi authorizing us to move our family's Foundation Establishment spirit root to the island."

With these matters arranged, Li Ximing prepared to enter seclusion. He handed over one last item—a small, purple-flamed cauldron. "This was Yu Yuwei's Dharma Artifact. Send someone to return it."

Even if the cauldron didn't bear the Tuoba family's mark, the Li family would not covet his belongings. With the Yu family scattered, and Yu Yuwei himself having been estranged from them, sending it to Li Quantao to decide its fate was the proper course of action.

After settling the miscellaneous affairs, Li Ximing gave his final instructions. "Our family is experiencing a golden age, the likes of which we haven't seen in a century. With you presiding over the 'Bright Yang' path, we have An Siwei and Li Wen for 'Jade True,' Chenghui for 'Celestial Thunder,' Minggong for 'True Fire,' Chenghuai for 'Upper Shaman,' and the Elder White Ape for 'True Qi.' Externally, we have Qu Bushi of 'Earth Virtue,' Miaoshui of 'Converging Water,' Cui Jueyin, who also follows 'Bright Yang,' and Ding Weizeng of 'Hengzhu'..."

"Excluding those in the dungeon, those under seal, and Jiang Huzi who is near death's door, our family has eleven Foundation Establishment cultivators. We have already caught up to the Yuan family of old, and that's with me overseeing everything... At a time like this, we must be even more cautious."

By Li Ximing's count, their eleven cultivators were still one short of the twelve needed for the _Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire_. Moreover, not everyone was available; each was busy with their own duties. They were still short-handed.

"Who else in the family has a chance at Foundation Establishment?" he asked.

Li Zhouwei knew the roster by heart. "If Chen Mufeng and An Siming from back then were still alive, they could be attempting it now. The two from the Tian family died in seclusion, and we've lost a third from the Jade Court Guard during their breakthrough attempt. The Xu clan has declined... but there is a Fei Qingyi from the Fei family. The descendants of the Western Tan have many Qi Refining cultivators, but they were severely weakened after changing their surname, and none are ready for a breakthrough yet."

"Only Chen Yang is very close."

"Chen Yang..." The name finally registered with Li Ximing. "He cultivates Pit Water... a pity, but he can free up someone else. As for the Fei family... there was a Fei Qingyi who served my elder brother. She could be useful."

The topic of breakthroughs brought a sudden silence. After a moment, Li Ximing asked, "Are there any Essence Gathering Pills left from the ones the Azure Pond Sect gave us? Bring one for me to see."

"Of course."

Li Zhouwei sent someone to fetch them. A short while later, Chen Yang arrived with the pill. Li Ximing glanced at him, took the pill, and immediately dismissed him.

"We received seven from the Azure Pond Sect in total. Father, Aunt, Uncle, Siwei, Li Wen... that leaves two."

The Profound Light in Li Ximing's brow pulsed as he scanned the pill. Finally, he closed his eyes and ground out a single word through his gritted teeth.

"Good!"

The Li family now possessed the formula for the Essence Gathering Pill and could refine it themselves. They were no longer reliant on begging others for something they barely understood. With a single look at the formula and the pill, Li Ximing immediately saw the truth.

The principles behind the Essence Gathering Pill were similar to the methods Purple Mansion cultivators used to extend their path or use spiritual items to aid in mastering divine abilities. Li Ximing had some knowledge of both. Though his skill in magical arts was lacking, his mastery of alchemy was profound. The answer came to him with crystal clarity.

"An Essence Gathering Pill, no matter how many precious secondary ingredients it contains, is fundamentally defined by one primary ingredient. In ancient times, they used 'Lanhu Spirit Grass,' an impossibly rare herb. The modern method is to tailor the ingredient to the individual. For a Pit Water cultivator, the best ingredient would be a Pit Water-aligned material, preferably refined using a divine ability. That would create a true Essence Gathering Pill, far more effective than the one-and-a-half-success-rate versions."

Their own ancestor, Li Tongya, had consumed such a treasure pill, meticulously refined by a Purple Mansion expert, which was why his breakthrough had been so effortless.

Li Ximing sighed internally. "The best choice for the primary ingredient is a fellow cultivator of the same path. A demon beast is the next best thing. Only as a last resort should one use treasure medicines—three at best, one at the very least."

"Now I understand why the direct disciples of Purple Mansion sects have so many successful breakthroughs. They all share the secret of the Essence Gathering Pill and never publicize it. The pills they release, with their paltry success rates, are given to guest elders and peak lords as 'inner sect treatment.' Secretly, they give better ones to the obedient and worse ones to the rebellious or threatening. They might even use a conflicting primary ingredient to sabotage someone. The actual effect is entirely in their control!"

Li Zhouwei's head snapped up, his eyes flashing with dawning horror. The calm in his gaze was instantly replaced by a venomous, astonished rage. "The ones the Azure Pond Sect gave our family!?"

"They were the worst kind. And not just the worst kind!" Li Ximing finally dropped all pretense of restraint, his voice turning vicious. "I've inspected the primary ingredients. They were all Veiled Yin and Radiant Essence! Why did Chengliao fail his breakthrough?! His foundation was Bright Yang! To take an Essence Gathering Pill of Veiled Yin and Radiant Essence... it is unconscionable!"

The five Essence Gathering Pills from the Azure Pond Sect had gray markings, indicating they were made from demon beasts and treasure medicines. Li Ximing had inspected them himself before allowing the family to use them, but back then, he couldn't discern the differences in their immortal foundations.

Li Zhouwei closed his eyes. He finally understood why his father, Li Chengliao, had failed so quickly after only a few years in seclusion, with barely a celestial phenomenon to mark his passing. He understood why they had all used the Essence Gathering Pill, yet his aunt Li Minggong and An Siwei had passed through with danger but ultimately survived... while his father, whose disposition and cultivation art were the finest among them, had failed.

Li Ximing exhaled slowly, the light in his eyes sharpening. "I still remember... back then, Lord Xuanfeng exchanged for an Essence Gathering Pill from the Azure Pond Sect for Second Uncle Li Yuanjiao. He recognized it was a 'human pill' and refused to use it, giving it to Yuan Huyuan instead. Yuan Huyuan then successfully broke through to the Earth Virtue realm... Thinking back, it must have been an Earth Virtue Essence Gathering Pill. Earth buries Pit Water... what a perfect 'Earth buries Pit Water'..."

He took a moment to process the treachery. "The Chi family is destroyed. Chi Fubo and Ning Hejing are dead, their bones scattered... otherwise, I would have torn them to shreds with my own hands!"

Though he spoke with fury, Li Ximing knew that Si Boxiu must have been aware of the truth. Even Si Yuanli likely understood it perfectly! They simply kept it to themselves.

'After all, given the situation at the time, weakening our family was something the Si clan was happy to see... They had no reason to warn us.'

Seeing Li Zhouwei's head bowed in silence, Li Ximing didn't know what to say. He could only sigh. "Among the three cartloads of spiritual items from the Xiao family, there were two Pit Water treasure medicines. Bring them to me for alchemy. Once this pill is refined, I will enter seclusion to work on my divine abilities... A great enemy is approaching."

When he finished, Li Zhouwei had already composed himself. He nodded and withdrew. "Leave the family's affairs to me, Daoist Master. Do not worry."

...

On the lake, spring turned to autumn, and time slipped by. For a Purple Mansion cultivator, a year was little more than a single session of seclusion. Though Li Ximing had mastered his divine ability, his proficiency with its associated arts was lacking. He started with the simplest one, Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light.

Fortunately, having the divine ability made mastering the arts much faster. He had also studied the technique before, so he made some progress. In the midst of his training, he made a trip to the Xuanmiao Temple.

Sumian was as welcoming as ever, but when Li Ximing inquired about the Secret Diffusion Sects, their conversation drifted to old tales, and he couldn't glean any concrete information. After much consideration, Li Ximing realized he would likely have to ask the Daoist Master Changyun, the power behind the Brahma Cloud Cave.

But before he could set out, as he was passing through the territory of the Profound Peak Gate, he felt a ripple in the Great Void. The spiritual qi of Still Earth surged. Descending to the ground to inspect the ley lines, he found that a new mountain had risen within the Profound Peak Gate's domain.

'Someone failed their breakthrough and perished!'

This event, while tragic for Changxi, was expected by Li Ximing and the other Purple Mansion cultivators. The repercussions of 'Inward Heart Surging Profundity'—suppressing Earth and inhibiting demons—were no joke. It had already drastically shortened Changxi's own remaining lifespan; it was only a matter of time before it claimed one of his Foundation Establishment cultivators.

'I should return to the mountain. Changxi might come looking for me.'

This was another cultivator who had fallen into the pit that had claimed Li Chengliao and Yuan Huyuan.
