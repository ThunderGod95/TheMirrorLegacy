# Chapter 525: Mutuo

The Eastern Sea spanned thousands of li, with jagged rocks jutting out across its vast expanse. Waves surged endlessly from the boundless east, one after another, crashing upon each other. The islands scattered across the horizon were linked, their landscapes vastly different from those inland. The brilliant morning sun began to rise from the edge of the sky, casting rays of light in all directions.

It was Li Qinghong's first time venturing overseas, and she was deeply captivated by the sight. Unable to hold herself back, she asked, "Is this the end of the world... where immortals reside?"

Kong Yu stroked his beard with a smile and replied, "If you travel eastward all the way to the edge of the Eastern Sea, you will reach the Endless Void Abyss. There, the seawater reverses and falls into the abyss, descending slower and slower until it becomes vapor, rising back up and returning to the sea."

Taking a moment to recount the past, Kong Yu continued, "There is no air, no spiritual qi, nor the great void. That place is called Outer Heavens. In ancient times, cultivators and members of the demon race embarked on journeys to the Outer Heavens from the four seas, and none have ever returned."

Li Yuanjiao nodded. He had heard about this from Li Xizhi before and now asked, "If that is the case... why would anyone go there?"

Kong Yu sighed with a touch of sentiment. "When a cultivator attains the Golden Core Realm, they gain Fruition Attainment and can replace heaven's will with their own. Beyond that is the Dao Embryo, but what lies beyond the Dao Embryo? There is no path left to take...

"It is said that in the past, it was impossible to leave. The four seas were bound by a heavenly barrier. But during the immortal-devil war at Pingming Ford, the heavens lowered by three zhang, and the earth rose by nine chi. Since then, the four seas became unbound, and the practice of cultivation became unrestricted. It is said that those with Dao Embryos sense that the true path lies in the Outer Heavens, so they journey there."

Li Yuanjiao silently nodded, while Kongheng, who had been listening intently, spoke up. "So that is how the immortal sects view it... Our Buddhist sect holds a different perspective."

He had an awkward look on his face and apologized first for what he was about to say. "According to our scriptures, the battle at Pingming Ford is referred to as the Karmic Filth of Past Lives, marking the division between the previous and future incarnations of the Buddha. In the past, immortals and their laws ruled the world, with the Xia people reigning supreme. In the future life, the rise of Buddhism followed, as the Hu and Jie people replaced the Xia."[1]

Kongheng had spoken cautiously, yet the faces of the group still darkened. Kong Yu, however, seemed to reflect on it thoughtfully and remarked, "After the battle of Pingming Ford, the Wei State was destroyed, and the states of Qi, Liang, Zhou, and Yan rose and fell‚Äîall under the rule of the Hu and Jie people... Perhaps the Buddha's words were a prophecy of fate."

Kong Yu gave a wry smile and murmured softly, "Five hundred years ago, the southern immortal mansions still had dreams of reclaiming the northern lands. But after the fall of several immortal mansions, all that is left is infighting in their own small corners. The Buddha's words were not entirely wrong! Immortal law has collapsed, and what remains in the south are the paths of devils!"

The Profound Peak disciples behind them exchanged puzzled looks, and one of them asked, "Master's words do not make sense. We vanquish demons and eliminate evil, enjoying the freedom of the heavens and earth... How does that connect to devil paths?"

Kong Yu's face was filled with bitterness. He tightened his grip on the wooden staff and glanced at Li Yuanjiao before sighing. "All of you are still young... You do not understand the ways of the world yet. It is not just about vanquishing demons and eliminating evil. Take one wrong step, and you too will become a devil yourself. And as for the freedom you speak of... there is no such thing."

The disciples, some thoughtful, others defiant, remained silent. Kongheng chanted a Buddhist prayer, his face filled with compassion, as if deeply resonating with the sentiment.

Li Yuanjiao, observing Kongheng's demeanor, surmised that the Profound Peak Gate had likely either been coerced or willingly participated in some unsavory deeds during the devil plague. He shook his head slightly and said in a gentle voice, "Your gate has done rather well under the circumstances."

Kong Yu chuckled grimly and pointed ahead, changing the subject with a smile, "Up ahead is Splitreed Island, the first landing point of the Eastern Sea!"

The Eastern Sea was divided into five major regions. Beyond Lake Xian lay the Crimson Reef Sea, a region full of jagged rocks and home to countless islands. Looking ahead, the group saw a huge island rising in the distance.

This island was vast, covered with various pavilions and towers. Countless cultivators flew up and down, and in the distance, parts of the island were hidden within clouds and mist, its full extent unknown.

Kong Yu smiled and said, "This place is called Splitreed Island. The fire veins here are astonishingly active, surpassing even the volcanic deserts... It is one of the great wonders of the Eastern Sea."

The group was filled with awe, and the Profound Peak disciples bombarded Kong Yu with questions. The old man beamed with pride as he explained, "The island gets its name from Immortal Yingze of the Moonlight Origin Mansion. Legend has it that the immortal captured the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch here, known as Kuaili!

"This Devil Monarch had attained the Lesser Yang Fruition Attainment, becoming undying and indestructible. The immortal, unable to fully destroy him, forced him to reincarnate and start his cultivation anew. Using a white jade hairpin, the immortal divided him into three parts.

"One part was cast into a place known as Beiming, where it transformed into a woman known as the Empress Beiyao. Another part was thrown into the western Great Western Plains, becoming the Devil Lord Xiyan. The last part sank to the bottom of the Eastern Sea, where it was claimed by the Dragon Clan, now known as the Dragon Monarch Xiyang of the Eastern Sea."

Li Yuanjiao, both astonished and unsettled by what he heard, silently reflected on the culture of the Eastern Sea. Such stories would never be spoken of so openly in the Azure Pond Sect, yet here in the Eastern Sea, they were freely shared.

He could only ask, "Are all three of them Golden Core Realm cultivators?"

Kong Yu replied, "It is known that Empress Beiyao and the Dragon Monarch are both Golden Core Realm cultivators, but the one in the Great Western Plains is merely a legend..."

"If that is true... that means a single Lesser Yang Fruition Attainment was split into three Golden Cores, and all three became Golden Core Realm cultivators?"

One of the Profound Peak disciples then asked in confusion, "How is that possible?"

Kong Yu chuckled and answered, "What does a brat like you possibly understand? Back in the day, the nine offspring of the Converging Water Hornless Dragon were born from the dissolution of a single Golden Core into nine, each forming its own Golden Core... The mysteries of the Golden Core are far beyond the grasp of small cultivators like you!"

The group started chattering and discussing this. After a while, a female cultivator approached, radiating joy. She was dressed in a pale yellow-green feather robe and was riding on pink clouds. She first greeted Kong Yu as she cupped her fist, "Greetings, Clan Uncle!"

She then turned eagerly to Li Yuanjiao and said, "Brother Jiao, you are here! What a coincidence! Come with me, let's rest over there."

The group of young disciples followed Kong Yu and were led away for their training. Kong Tingyun glanced at Li Qinghong with surprise and admiration in her eyes. She then smiled and said, "So, this is Sister Qinghong... your reputation precedes you."

She exchanged a few friendly words, clearly taking a liking to Li Qinghong. The group landed at the Profound Peak Gate's station, where Kong Tingyun said, "Would you like to rest for a bit, or head quickly to the marketplace out in the deep sea? Situ Mo is treacherous and devious. If I stay away too long, something might happen..."

Li Yuanjiao and the others were just as eager to get moving, so they all agreed and flew off together. Li Yuanjiao, not wanting to miss a chance to gather more information, asked, "When Senior shared the story of Splitreed Island, he talked about Empress Beiyao and Dragon Monarch Xiyang as if they appear often... Do the Golden Core Realm True Monarchs often reveal themselves overseas?"

"They do not appear all the time, but they do show up occasionally... Overseas, we can speak more freely... They are unlike the Pristine Water True Monarch, who has not dared to show his face for over a century," Kong Tingyun answered as they traveled.

Kong Tingyun chuckled lightly and continued, "He is totally shaking in his boots! The Pristine Water Fruition Attainment is no ordinary one... Many are keeping their eyes on him."

1. Jie people were members of a tribe of northern China in the fourth century. During the period of the Sixteen Kingdoms, they were regarded by the Han people as one of the Five Barbarians.

Hu people were non-Han Chinese populations.

Xia people was the ethnicity name of Han Chinese before the rise of the Han dynasty in the 2nd century BC. ‚òú

Li Yuanjiao nodded thoughtfully, and his once terrifying impression of Pristine Water True Monarch faded significantly. The invincible aura surrounding him seemed to diminish, and he remarked quietly, "The Eastern Sea is truly a different world."

As they flew, Kong Tingyun reminded them, "There are a few powers in the Eastern Sea that you cannot provoke, and I am sure you are aware of them, but I will still mention them again."

After ascertaining that Li Yuanjiao was listening intently, Kong Tingyun began, "The first is the Dragon Clan... In the four seas, the Eastern Sea's Dragon Clan is the most powerful, a top-tier force. The Dragon species are also fiercely protective of their own. As long as it is a True Dragon, you must not offend even a single one."

Everyone nodded in understanding as Kong Tingyun continued, "Next are the various demonic entities‚Äîsometimes called Immortals, sometimes Ghost Officials‚Äîor even strange, unnatural beings formed from combinations of metallic essences, fate, and ill omens."

She shook her head and added, "There is not much you can do when you encounter one. Even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators avoid some of them, while others might only make you sneeze."

"In the mainland, there are emissaries of death who monitor these things so you rarely see them, but overseas, it is a different story. The Eastern Sea is vast and boundless, hiding countless unknowns..."

She paused before continuing, "As for the other factions, there has never been a day without bloodshed. In the end, it is all for their interests."

Kong Tingyun waited for a moment before leading them to the water. After calculating the time, she said softly, "The Eastern Sea is too vast. Just flying would take us forever. It is better to rely on the water veins, which not only save us mana but are also much faster."

Li Qinghong glanced around and noticed several others nearby, warily watching each other as they waited. Kong Tingyun whispered, "In just a few breaths, the water veins of the sea will surge. When the water rushes in, we will use the Water Command Technique to ride the current to the Scarlet Pristine Sea, where my family's marketplace is located."

Just as she finished speaking, the surrounding waters began to tremble and rush eastward. Large and small bubbles rose, and the ground beneath them shook violently as lightning flashed across the darkened sky.

Li Yuanjiao, having traveled the Eastern Sea for over a year, was well-versed in its ways. He calmly said, "My immortal foundation is Boundless Ocean... Let me handle the water control."

With that, a serpent dragon formed under his feet, coiling in the sea and transforming into a bluish-gray light ring that enveloped everyone, swiftly carrying them eastward with the surging current.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scarlet Pristine Sea, Golden Sack Island.

There were several islands in the Scarlet Pristine Sea, and Golden Sack Island was a medium-sized one. The Golden Tang Gate had established a firm presence here, reinforcing it with great effort.

Situ Mo, dressed in gold, sat sternly at the head of the hall, his face dark. Below him, a man kneeled on the ground, trembling as he reported, "My lord... the crab has come to demand another thousand people... he says he will return in three days."

Situ Mo's expression grew darker, and he replied in a low voice, "I see."

Although the Golden Tang Gate was an immortal gate, it still had to abide by the rules of the Eastern Sea. What was due had to be paid. The crab was merely at the Qi Cultivation Realm, but it had a serpent dragon backing it. As much as Situ Mo resented it, he had no choice but to swallow his anger.

His foul mood was not just because of this; the records on the table also vexed him. As the sole direct descendant on this island, he had secretly obtained these sect records and had been reviewing the events from years ago.

"In the sixth lunar month, the Yu Family joined the gate, and Wan Huaqian became famous in the prefecture for his formation techniques... The Yu Family then ambushed and killed members of the Wan Family, framing the Ji Family... The Wan Family retaliated by attacking Mount Hua, and the Xiao Family sent a warning to the Yu Family... slaughter ensued... and the prefecture was besieged..."

Throughout the destruction of the Ji Family, the real forces behind the scenes were the Yu and Xiao families, along with the broader power struggles between the Azure Pond and Golden Tang. In hindsight, it was clear that Li Tongya was merely a pawn in Xiao Chuting's larger scheme.

"Xiao Chuting manipulated the situation brilliantly, weakening both the Jiang and Yu families and almost subjugating the entire eastern shore, while propping up the Li Family as a loyal supporter... truly masterful."

Situ Mo silently acknowledged the cunningness of Xiao Chuting but knew that he lacked the strength to confront the Xiao Family for now. He filed away his grudges, awaiting a day when he could settle the score.

But Xiao Chuting is a formidable opponent... I must continue to feign ignorance for now, lest I end up caught in Man On Creek's schemes. As he pondered, he suddenly realized that there had been no news from Kong Tingyun for quite some time. This raised alarm bells in his mind.

That woman is never quiet for long. Could she be scheming something?

He quickly ordered, "Go fetch Master Monk Mutuo!"

Watching his subordinate leave, Situ Mo felt a chill of unease run down his spine. Not long ago, he had considered getting rid of her to reclaim control, but after probing her twice and suffering minor setbacks, he had to admit he had underestimated her.

Damn it... It is easy to fool the idiots in the sect, but once outside, none of them are simple... Situ Mo silently fumed.

Li Yuanjiao had been difficult enough, and even that monk seemed like no pushover. Kong Tingyun was sly, and even Li Xijun was quick-witted. Inside the Golden Tang Gate, he could fool his seniors and juniors, but outside, he had suffered one setback after another. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, cursing aloud, "No wonder the Golden Tang Gate is declining... It is full of idiots!"

As he was in the middle of cursing, a burly, bald man barged into the hall, his face red with irritation. He growled, "What now?"

Seeing him, Situ Mo's temper flared even more. He shouted, "You filthy monk! All you do is chase after skirts! Are you even keeping an eye on Kong Tingyun?!"

Mutuo shot him a sideways glance and muttered a mantra under his breath while retorting, "What do you know?! In the Great Zhao, as long as you are a monk, even princesses get on their knees and let you do what you want with them. But here in the south, at least they still know how to cry and run..."

Situ Mo's face darkened further, but he restrained his disgust. Then, suddenly, Mutuo's expression changed. He hesitated before asking tentatively, "She is not on the island..?"

Situ Mo had anticipated this, and his face remained unchanged. Mutuo hastily resumed divining, his face paling as he poured more energy into his divination. After a while, he finally muttered, "She is not in the Scarlet Pristine Sea!"

Situ Mo's face showed a slight shift, his mind racing. Several names flashed through his thoughts, and then a moment of realization struck him. He hesitated, then said, "I heard Splitreed Island was attacked by some kind of demon creatures recently, with many casualties, right?"

Mutuo blinked, realization dawning on him.

"You are saying... Kong Tingyun went to pick up disciples from the sect?"

Situ Mo nodded hesitantly. Mutuo quickly exclaimed, "This is a perfect opportunity! We may not be able to break through the island's great formation, but we could ambush her on the sea route! Let us both go‚Äîwhen we get close enough, I will do the divination again!"

Situ Mo immediately flew into action, rising into the air with Mutuo by his side. As they neared the coast, doubt crept into his mind.

That woman knows I have a Buddhist cultivator here‚Äîwhy would she make such a mistake? Sect disciples... Does Profound Peak Gate not have other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to send? This is too convenient...

Suddenly, a thought struck him, and he almost shouted, "Quick, check where Li Yuanjiao is!"

Mutuo blinked in confusion.

"Did we not agree we would not go after the Li Family for another ten years?"

"Just do it!" Situ Mo snapped.

Mutuo's face twisted with frustration. "I am not even in the Yue State! How am I supposed to do that now? We are already close to the sea route... Why not just focus on Kong Tingyun?!"

Situ Mo gritted his teeth but relented, fixing his gaze on the approaching water surge. He growled, "Fine, but first check if Li Yuanjiao is in the Eastern Sea! Start with him!"
