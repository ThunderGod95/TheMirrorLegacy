# Chapter 698: The Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly (Part 2)

Xiao Yuansi hesitated. The old man was not one for grand displays. He raised his eyes to Li Ximing’s face, which, while unchanged, seemed entirely different.

"Ming'er…"

The face before him was well-proportioned, with long eyebrows and pale golden eyes that watched him with a gentle smile.

'Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing.'

The simmering frustration that had always seemed clenched between his brows, a look of gritted teeth and repressed anger, was gone. It had vanished completely, replaced by a single point of celestial light shimmering on his forehead.

His restless, slightly anxious gaze had also disappeared. Li Ximing's eyes now held a warm and gentle smile, free of the melancholy resolve of one marching willingly to his death.

With these two burdens lifted from his expression, his entire face came alive. He was no longer the Li clan's desperate, last-ditch gamble. He was Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing.

Tears welled in Xiao Yuansi’s eyes. Under the watchful gaze of the crowd, he could only sigh.

"Daoist Master Zhaojing's fortunes are profound. This old man has basked in your light."

Li Ximing smiled and helped him up. Daoist Master Changxi, standing nearby, spoke in a warm and friendly tone, his heart filled with envy.

"Master, this way, please," Li Ximing said respectfully.

Everyone knew about the pill Xiao Yuansi had given him. They also knew how he had been reprimanded by Xiao Chuting and returned from the Northern Sea in disgrace. For the ten years Li Ximing was in seclusion, Xiao Yuansi had been either a joke or a topic of gossip among the direct lines of the major sects and clans.

Li Ximing had heard snippets of this. By coming to welcome him personally, he wanted to show everyone and restore his master's honor.

That was the first reason. The second was that Xiao Chuting had also come to Moongaze Lake. He was already on the island. True to form, the Daoist Master never involved himself personally and had simply allowed Xiao Yuansi to come from the mountains. Li Ximing naturally seized the opportunity, making it clear to all that the bond between the Xiao and Li families was as strong as ever.

Though a small gesture, it was greatly beneficial to the Li clan. Li Ximing escorted Xiao Yuansi into the mountains and saw him settled in a courtyard before returning to the main island. There, he heard from An Siwei that Xiao Chuting had already left his gift and departed alone.

Li Ximing nodded in understanding, but Daoist Master Changxi, who stood beside him, quietly lowered his gaze.

'So, Xiao Chuting is avoiding me…'

Though newly ascended and not as adept at discerning such subtleties as the more seasoned Purple Mansion cultivators, Li Ximming could see it plainly. A sense of dread grew in his heart.

'This situation with Changxi… it really is a mess.'

But no matter how close the Li and Profound Peak Gate were, and with Changxi here to offer congratulations, Li Ximing could not avoid him as Xiao Chuting had. He sat down with the Daoist Master in a mountain garden filled with blooming gardenias.

"A fine Bright Yang domain," Changxi said with a smile. "I wonder what name Daoist Master Zhaojing has chosen for it?"

Li Ximing poured him tea. "I have named this place Gardenia Scenery Mountain," he said politely. "It will be my place of quiet cultivation from now on."

"Excellent!" Changxi exclaimed. He took an item from his sleeve and placed it on the table. Inside a jade box lay a perfectly round white pearl. It radiated a brilliant, hair-thin rainbow light and was faintly carved with the image of a tiger looking over its shoulder, giving it an incredibly domineering aura.

Daoist Master Changxi's face flickered between youth and old age, shifting on the hour. He currently had the appearance of a middle-aged man, a jade pendant on his chest and a joyful expression on his face.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, our two families have supported each other for a century. My family's Tingyun and your Yuanjiao were the closest of friends. Now that you have achieved your divine ability, my heart is filled with joy. I have prepared this humble gift for you."

His tone was exceptionally pleasant, and he no longer called Li Ximing ‘little friend.’ A man several centuries old was humbling himself to call someone not yet a hundred years of age ‘Daoist Friend,’ while tactfully bringing up their old ties. It was the height of courtesy.

'His lifespan… is truly running out.'

Li Ximing could tell with a single glance that the item was at least of the Purple Mansion level, likely a Purple Mansion dharma artifact. It was relatively new, probably less than a century old. While it couldn't compare to treasures like the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal or the Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing, it was far beyond any of the Li family’s current artifacts.

'This is too valuable!'

Li Ximing was not naive about the significance of a Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly. But these Purple Mansion cultivators were a stingy lot. They would freely give away Foundation Establishment treasures, but Purple Mansion items were out of the question. The assembly was more about showing face and demonstrating goodwill by attending.

As for gifts? One couldn't expect Purple Mansion dharma artifacts or materials. At best, you might receive a fourth-grade technique. More often, it was ancient curios, rare treasures, or obscure manuals that wouldn't compromise the giver's status.

For Changxi to offer a Purple Mansion dharma artifact, his intentions were crystal clear. He wanted to create a debt that he could call upon to secure a future for the Profound Peak Gate.

As if reading his thoughts, Changxi smiled. "This artifact is called the 'Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger.' It is a mid-grade earth-element dharma artifact. It was not refined by my own divine ability but was acquired on my travels. It cannot compare to a dharma treasure, but it is quite serviceable."

"Refined by a divine ability?" Li Ximing asked, intrigued.

Changxi chuckled, his voice turning aged as he explained, "Dharma Artifacts can be roughly divided into three types. The first is made by taking an excellent artifact embryo and infusing it with one's divine ability. After a century of refinement, it becomes a dharma artifact, perfectly attuned to its master."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. "It's that simple? Then why are there so few dharma artifacts in Jiangnan?"

Changxi stroked his beard. "Firstly, a good embryo is difficult to craft. Furthermore, since the tool is refined by a divine ability, it is bound to the same nature as its master's power. It requires constant nurturing, which drains the mind, and it will revert to its original form if separated from the divine ability for too long. It sounds easy, but such items are very difficult to pass down."

Li Ximing immediately recalled the nine gate-viewing spirit embryos that Daoist Master Tianque had spent a century forging at Daoist He's place on the western shore of Moongaze Lake. It was indeed no simple task. He nodded, and Changxi continued.

"The second type is more common, like this Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. These are forged by Purple Mansion-level artifact refiners. Their quality varies, from high to low. The lowest grade is inferior to even a good spirit embryo, while the highest can rival a dharma treasure."

"They are also classified into upper, middle, and lower grades. A mid-grade tool is comparable to one refined by a divine ability, but it is a treasure that can be passed down through a family, and it is not restricted to a single cultivator's essence."

"As for so-called dharma treasures…" Changxi's expression turned self-deprecating, and he shook his head. "In truth, they are merely ancient dharma artifacts from before the celestial shift, like the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. Back then, they were just dharma artifacts. Now, we must call them dharma treasures… To think they are a cut above all modern dharma artifacts. It’s quite ironic."

Hearing this, Li Ximing understood a great deal more, and his estimation of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal rose even higher. 'No wonder Yuansu could dominate everyone with a single divine ability. He himself is formidable… but that Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal is also no simple item.'

Changxi glanced at him and hesitated, then, as if to curry more favor, he spoke again with a smile. "I once heard of another method of artifact refinement from long ago. It is no longer viable, but it is an interesting story to share."

"Please, Senior, tell me!" Li Ximing was eager to learn more.

Changxi stroked his beard and began his tale. "It is said that a thousand years ago, cultivators with an immortal foundation had a method of refining artifacts by gathering the will of the masses. It was exceptionally effective. Ancient cultivators lived among the people, using their divine abilities to connect with them and draw upon the thoughts and will of the populace to temper an artifact, granting it a spirit. This was called the 'Refining Radiance Art.'"

"We can still see traces of it on many of the ancient dharma artifacts we find. The highest-grade magic treasures of that era also possessed this capability."

A bomb went off in Li Ximing’s mind. The next thought surfaced uncontrollably.

'Lu Qi!'

'Isn't that my Immortal Mirror?!'

'The highest-grade magic treasures!'

His mind went blank for a moment as a torrent of complex thoughts rushed through him.

'No wonder I couldn't see through the Talisman Seed even after achieving my divine ability… No wonder it allows mortals to cultivate, no wonder it has the miraculous Lu Qi. It truly is an immortal tool!'

'And the Supreme Yin Profound Light is so powerful! Now that I've reached the Purple Mansion Realm, its might is even harder to fathom. A child could probably wield it and injure a Purple Mansion cultivator… What in the world could allow for such a thing? Only a true dharma treasure could have such power!'

He forcibly shoved the thoughts from his mind, struggling to maintain his composure. Without missing a beat, he asked, "Then why is it not possible now? Has the method been lost?"

Changxi was no fool. He immediately sensed Li Ximing's emotional fluctuation. Though he could never have guessed the Li family possessed such an item, he assumed Li Ximing was simply awestruck by the tale. The old man sighed. "It is no longer possible, but the method was not lost. I was very interested in this in my youth and searched everywhere, poring over many ancient texts, and managed to find some information…"

A look of confusion crossed the old man's face, and he frowned. "It is said… that the method itself was taken. Some say stolen, some say seized, and others say it was 'proven' or 'attained.' But all accounts lead to a single name."

"A name…" Li Ximing felt a sudden reluctance to hear it, fearing some world-shaking name would fall from the old man's lips.

But Changxi had already spoken: "Su Xikong."

"Su Xikong…" The name was very familiar. Li Ximing instantly recalled it. When Yu Muxian returned from the north and fought two opponents at once, he had revealed this venerable name. The various masters that Li Xuanfeng had killed had also chanted it: "The Acharya taught me, granting me the art of Su Xikong, the principles of Shakya… Su Xikong is the Revered One!"

Changxi nodded in confirmation. "Correct. The loss of this method is likely related to him. After he attained his Dao, the power of such artifacts diminished by eighty percent. In the century that followed, they grew weaker year by year, their related abilities fading away."

"After four hundred years, most of the dharma artifacts created by the Refining Radiance Art had lost all their power. Only a few that were close to the level of dharma treasures and had a strong connection to a Fruition Attainment managed to retain some semblance of their might, though they were far from what they once were. And no one since has been able to use this method."

Silence fell between them. Li Ximing immediately thought of the situation in the north and formed several conjectures. From Changxi's expression, he probably had his own ideas as well, though he would not voice them.

The topic came to a close. The old Daoist Master smiled and pushed the jade box forward. Li Ximing looked down at the glittering artifact, hesitating.

'Do I accept it… or not?'

…

Mist and clouds swirled through the mountain courtyards. Li Ximing had not yet taken the head seat, but rows of jade cushions and tables had been set out, and the crowd was growing.

Li Jiangqian sat at the head of the left courtyard, lightly raising his jade cup. Beside him was a cultivator in azure robes with a transcendent air and a calm expression. He was at the Foundation Establishment realm—the Azure Pond Peak Master, Si Tongyi.

Si Tongyi was of a similar age to Li Zhouwei. With Li Ximing's sudden breakthrough, he no longer dared to address Li Xizhi as a peer. But he was a man who could swallow his pride, and he had immediately struck up a conversation with Li Jiangqian, seating himself right next to him.

He was now pointing out various cultivators below and introducing them in a friendly manner. "That is Cheng Jinzhu of the Sword Gate. He is a good friend of your Changtian Peak Master… and a renowned sword cultivator in his own right."

Li Jiangqian followed his gaze and saw a man with a sword on his back sitting among the guests. His expression was placid, and the seats around him were empty, a clear sign that others were reluctant to sit near him.

"Thank you for the information, honored uncle," Li Jiangqian said with a warm smile.

Si Tongyi did not dwell on Cheng Jinzhu and proceeded to introduce the other guests in order. Li Jiangqian scanned the surroundings, his thoughts lingering on the few Daoist Masters seated on clouds above.

On a cloud platform to the west sat a man with broad shoulders and thick eyebrows, dressed in a fire-patterned Daoist robe. His every breath was like an invisible flame that slightly distorted the spiritual energy around him. This was Daoist Master Tianque of the Golden Feather Sect.

With Daoist Master Tianyuan of the Golden Feather Sect nearing the end of his life, Daoist Master Tianhuo in seclusion, and Daoist Master Qiushui making her presence known in the world, things had changed. After Daoist Master Zipei's fall, Qiushui had become one of the top Purple Mansion cultivators in the Yue State. Her status was too high, so Daoist Master Tianque, who usually guarded the Wu Kingdom, had come in her stead.

The representative from the Azure Pond Sect was, of course, Daoist Master Yuanxiu. The old man always wore a stern expression. Li Jiangqian didn't look at him, instead mentally tallying the attendees.

'Of the Three Sects… Golden Feather and Azure Pond are here. Yue Cultivating Sect did not come.'

Both sects had their own agendas but had shown face. The Yue Cultivating Sect had closed its gates, so its absence was expected. Li Jiangqian was more concerned with the Seven Gates.

'No word from the Snow Wings Gate… that sect hasn't been seen in the world for centuries.'

'The Sword Gate, the Chen Clan, and the Xiukui Monastery did not send their Purple Mansion masters, only their direct lines. Their response is… proper, but neutral.'

The Myriad Radiance Sword Gate and the Great Xiukui Monastery had no strong allegiances, so their actions were normal. Besides, Cheng Jinzhu's status was not low. The other gates, however, had made clearer statements.

'The Profound Peak Gate's delegation is the most impressive, followed by the Xiao Clan. Xiao Chuting came in person… though I hear he only showed his face for a moment and left. Only a few people saw him.'

'The Purple Mansion masters of the Purple Smoke Gate and Slaughter Jun Gate are not in their sects, so they sent their successors. Their seats are still empty, as they are still on their way.'

He raised his gaze. At the head of the southern seats was a Daoist Master with a cheerful face. Beside him sat a woman in red, Bi Yuzhuang, wearing a golden bracelet and a bright smile.

'The Hengzhu Sect sent Daoist Master Hengli and Bi Yuzhuang… They also show a great deal of respect.'

Li Jiangqian surveyed the entire assembly, all while making pleasant conversation with Si Tongyi, his mind crystal clear.

Of the Seven Gates, the Changxiao Gate had not come.

Not only were Changxiao Zi and Cheng Yan absent, but even their disciples had merely offered congratulations before leaving, not even taking a seat.

Aside from the Three Sects and Seven Gates, few cultivators from Jiangbei had come, with the notable exception of the Shen Clan. As for the major immortal sects of the Wu Kingdom, not a single one had appeared.

'Hengzhu and Changxiao are at odds… and our clan has had its own share of trouble with the Changxiao Gate…'

Li Jiangqian lowered his eyes, realizing the situation was not as bright as it seemed.

'Behind our clan, we only have the Xiao Clan and the Profound Peak Gate. Xiao Chuting is a wanderer… he won't make a move casually. And once Daoist Master Changxi falls, the entire Profound Peak territory will become a burden.'

'If things go wrong then, will we have to lean on the Hengzhu Sect? They are a righteous sect, it's true… but Hengxing and the others are quite calculating…'

He could not fathom the relationships between the Purple Mansion masters. He could only look up to the head table. His father, Li Zhouwei, was in the first seat of honor, and beside him was Kong Guxi of the Profound Peak's Kong family. The two were deep in pleasant conversation, a sight that made Li Jiangqian hesitate to raise his cup.

'Profound Peak… they are a hot potato. We absolutely cannot catch it…'
