# Chapter 287: Slaying Demons and Receiving Talismans

Li Tongya landed in the mountains as low wolf howls echoed through the forest. Clouds and mist shrouded everything in complete darkness. Sweeping his spiritual sense across the cave entrance, he felt a strong wave of demonic and bloody qi.

Resting his hand on the hilt of his sword, he advanced, quickly conjuring a flame with his left hand and flicking it into the cave.

The flame rose in the thick demonic qi for two breaths before flickering out. Li Tongya gazed at the giant creature in the cave expressionlessly, gripping his sword silently.

"Why must you press me so hard, Fellow Daoist..."

A raspy voice echoed in Li Tongya's ears. The demon had long sensed Li Tongya's approach but had relied on the large formation to remain hidden in the cave without making a sound.

The dense fog of Mount Bianyan obscured everything, creating a desolate and uninhabited atmosphere that rendered spiritual senses ineffective.

Assuming that a proud Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would dislike the trouble of a tedious search, the demon retreated to its cave, waiting for Li Tongya to leave the area.

To the demon's surprise, Li Tongya decided to descend into this area instead. Aware only that Li Tongya possessed some powerful dharma treasure, the demon dared not confront him directly.

The demon's voice turned harsh as it snarled, "I am a general under a demon king named Sanjun... I advise you to retreat quickly to avoid angering the demon king!"

"A demon king? If you had that kind of backing, you would not have dared to stay in Xu State!" Li Tongya countered, having gained this information from his secret meeting with the banyan fox.

The demon hesitated, realizing Li Tongya was not one to fall for bluffs. "You're a cultivator of the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Dao, not a demon-taming master. Besides, we demons often have dealings with cultivators... Why must you corner me so?" it asked.

Seeing Li Tongya unmoved, the demon's voice grew shrill as it pleaded tearfully, "I do not prey on cultivators or cause trouble... I live a solitary life on Mount Bianyan and only consume a few mortals when hunger compels me. It's the natural order of things! Why must you persecute me so, Exalted Immortal? Both your cultivation along with my demon power and intelligence have been hard-earned; why must we fight to the death?"

The wolf demon had cultivated in Mount Bianyan for many years where the practices from the north and south of Xu State intersected, hence it had learned much from both sides.

"I fled from the north and was fortunate enough to encounter a Maha or Dharma Master. He predicted my destiny, saying that if I cultivated in Mount Bianyan for a hundred years, a man would come to save me, bringing me great opportunities...! Now, the time is near. Please spare my life, Exalted Immortal..." it continued pleading.

Li Tongya ignored its pleas, silently accumulating sword qi. The wolf demon, realizing its pleas were futile, finally gave up hope and shot out of the cave like the wind.

A huge gray wolf, the size of a small house, appeared before Li Tongya, radiating intense demonic qi. Its ferocious green eyes burned brightly, and its thick, fluffy fur bristled. The demon spun around a few times frantically, trying to escape.

Li Tongya had anticipated this, drawing his sword instantly to unleash a brilliant sword aura that locked onto the wolf demon and descended forcefully. The wolf demon had no choice but to turn and face him directly.

Its expression was one of both shock and anger as it howled angrily, "Immortal, you are destroying my Dao!"

"...Not just your Dao."

Deep blue-colored serpent dragons appeared behind Li Tongya, which was different from the dark green water of Moongaze Lake. The waters of Mount Bianyan were colder, lending the serpent dragons their vivid deep blue hue.

The two serpent dragons snarled, moving menacingly as Li Tongya bellowed fiercely, "I want your life too!"

The wolf demon glared at Li Tongya, gritting its teeth as it remarked, "The Jing Dragon King, huh?"

It then spat a beam of green light which split into nine streams, shattering and dissipating Li Tongya's sword qi.

The wolf demon's Dao foundation was the Earth Shaman's Blessing, and it was powerful as it knew many secret techniques and nurtured a beam of green light in its chest.

When Li Tongya's sword qi was instantly dissipated, he was forced to summon two serpent dragons for aid. Despite the setback, his sword continued striking the wolf demon relentlessly.

Although the wolf demon was stronger, it had no intention of fighting Li Tongya as it thought to itself, This person doesn't seem to be a powerful sword immortal. He's just an ordinary cultivator, and these cultivators always group together. Killing one brings more trouble... I must find a chance to escape. I am just a small forest demon and cannot afford to provoke these immortal sect disciples!

With a long howl, four black shadows appeared from the forest below like a gust of wind. These were the Qi Cultivation Realm subordinates of the demon, who rushed up the mountain in response to the demon's call. Unexpectedly, several beams of mana light surrounded them almost immediately, revealing the members of the Li Family who now have them surrounded.
ùôõùíìùìÆùíÜùîÄùíÜùôóùì∑ùíêùô´ùíÜùô°.ùíÑùì∏ùì∂

"I knew it! You've come prepared!"

The demon grew more frightened with its focus still solely on escaping. However, it was prevented from doing so due to Li Tongya's continuous sword qi.

It realized that while this cultivator was not an overwhelming threat, he was tenacious and difficult to deal with; clearly not someone who could be defeated quickly.

"Please, Exalted Immortal... Spare my life!"

The massive demon continued fighting Li Tongya with its green light, but was anxious and kept begging for mercy. It kept a wary eye on Li Tongya, afraid he might pull out some talisman or treasure to finish it off in one blow.

Li Tongya remained expressionless, his sword qi flowing continuously. He thought to himself, This demon is not easy to deal with. I could use the Qingche Sword or the mirror... but the mirror's power is too great. If it turns the wolf demon into minced meat in one blow, this trip would be in vain.

Li Tongya's spiritual sense touched the mirror, faintly feeling the power of the Supreme Yin Profound Light within it. He knew that if he were hit directly by one of the mirror's beams, he would not survive. Although the wolf demon was stronger, it might not be able to withstand its might either.

The wolf demon made a decisive move, realizing that its situation was unfavorable. It was not sure if there were any other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators among the beams of mana light below.

With a long howl, it fired out another two brilliant beams of green light from its throat, but this time they were mixed with blood which made them stronger than the one before. The two serpent dragons summoned by Li Tongya were dispersed, and two beams of green light flew toward Li Tongya.

"Good!" Li Tongya praised, drifting back as he sheathed his sword. With his left hand, he gripped a tightly wrapped long sword behind him, unsheathing a cun of the green and white blade.

Buzz...

The swords in the hands of Li Xuanling and the others below vibrated uncontrollably, and the rusted sword fragments among the corpses in the mountains shook.

The wolf demon, terrified, gathered its demonic power and quickly erected a shield as it shrank back in silence.

"This cultivator indeed has some treasure!" it muttered softly and fearfully.

With the mere draw of the Qingche Sword, Li Tongya had managed to halt the two beams of green light. The sword arc from the Celestial Moon Slash shone brightly, clashing with a loud clang, knocking the beams askew and back to the ground where they dissipated into green sparks.

"Awoo...!"

The wolf demon's green light, a power it nurtured daily, was far superior to the two serpent dragons Li Tongya summoned with his Boundless Ocean. The broken spell caused the demon to spit out blood, staining the ground a bright crimson. Its demonic qi fluctuated wildly, clearly indicating severe injury.

Li Tongya twirled his sword, not giving the wolf demon a chance to catch its breath. The sword's glow split into three beams of white light this time.

"Threefold Moonlight!"

The Qingche Sword still contained a sword intent that had been nurtured by Li Chejing. Li Tongya didn't need to use a cow cleaver to kill a chicken; he only needed to use the sword to execute his sword technique. The Celestial Moon Sword Intent was fleeting but grand, making the demon feel like it was indeed facing a formidable foe.

The three beams of moonlight circled the wolf demon which were followed by Li Tongya's sword qi, forcing the demon to retreat step by step. The sword qi made its fur stand on end, and amidst the relentless assault, the demon repeatedly begged for mercy.

In a duel, the role of a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact was significant, especially an immortal sword that seemed to have gained sentience.

The wolf demon unleashed several spells, trying to ride the wind with its demonic qi, but the Qingche Sword struck it down each time, gradually leading it to complete despair.

Li Tongya, with his abundant mana, used the Qingche Sword to disperse the wolf demon's spells and suppress it. The demon, now exhausted and out of power, growled dangerously, "Why do you insist on destroying my Dao and taking my life today, fellow Daoist? I just cannot understand why I must suffer such a deadly fate!"

Its voice was no longer pleading, but instead was now dripping with hatred.

Li Tongya merely waved his hand in response. The Qingche Sword suppressed the exhausted wolf demon, who could no longer resist. The sharp blade hovered over its brow.

Li Tongya smiled and said, "You want to eat humans, so I will eat you. It is as simple as that."

With that, he struck the wolf demon with his palm, sealing its Dao foundation, then proceeding to seal its Qihai Acupoint and Shenyang Mansion as well. Just to be safe, he took out a few talismans and slapped them on the demon before dragging its massive body down the mountain.

Once out of the misty mountain, radiant sunlight flooded the surroundings, casting the scenery in a bright and cheerful light. Li Tongya landed at the foot of the mountain where several small demons were tightly bound‚Äîa pair of early Qi Cultivation Realm wolf demons, an old mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm wolf, and a peak Qi Cultivation Realm bear demon.

The members of the Li Family were in good condition. Li Xuanfeng engaged the bear demon in combat while the others handled the three smaller demons, eventually subduing the bear together.

All of them were seasoned in demon extermination, except for Shamoli, who, in his eagerness, sustained a heavy blow that left him somewhat dispirited. Fortunately, the rest of the group seemed unscathed.

Seeing Li Tongya descend with the wolf demon in tow, everyone instantly felt relieved. Li Xuanling said, "Brother Feng was about to go up the mountain to find you, but we stopped him."

Li Tongya nodded. With the presence of the external cultivators, he did not say much and only gave a simple instruction to the group.

"Let us return home."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Back at home, Li Xuanxuan had already made the necessary arrangements for the sacrificial ritual. The external cultivators were given Spirit Stones and dismissed. Shamoli returned to Eastern Mount Yue. Since Li Feiruo was pregnant, An Zheyan had paused his cultivation to keep her accompanied at the foot of the mountain.

The Li Family had not held a sacrificial ceremony for several years, making this year's ceremony particularly grand. The altar was divided into two‚Äîone at the foot of the mountain, holding a Qi Cultivation Realm demon, and one on the mountain, where the wolf demon and other demons were placed.

With so many eyes watching eagerly, the sacrificial ceremony could be understood as a local custom. Bringing a Qi Cultivation Realm demon to be killed could be seen as a way to intimidate and reassure the people. However, having the ancestor painstakingly capture a Foundation Establishment Realm demon general to slaughter on the altar would certainly arouse suspicion.

The atmosphere at the foot of the mountain was lively while the mountain top was much quieter, with only the direct members of the Li Family present. The round altar was polished to a reflective shine, and was engraved with intricate patterns.

The wolf demon, with its six senses now sealed and cultivation suppressed, was immobile, kneeling like a puppet on the platform.

Among their own, there was no need for any disguises. The altar displayed the gleaming bluish-gray mirror prominently, reflecting the moonlight and drawing attention.

"The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine with unwavering devotion year upon year. We exterminate demons to safeguard the fields, observe the three yuan festivals and six regular festivals, and maintain reverence, ensuring to pay timely respects... Through the smoke of our offerings and the blood of our sacrifice, we call upon the gods, seeking their blessings."

Despite its unwillingness, the wolf demon succumbed easily under the jade knife. The rising blood qi, mingling with the light-colored incense smoke, flowed onto the surface of the mirror.

Lu Jiangxian gently swept his sleeve, condensing the incense and essence qi before him into colorful clusters of light. He picked one up and murmured, "This is the first time it has been so plentiful..."

Almost like harvesting cotton, he lifted a strand of the colorful light, bundled it up, and condensed it into a blank Foundation Establishment Realm talisman.

"Li Yuanjiao... or Li Qinghong..."

Foundation Establishment Realm demons were rare, and those that could be easily captured without any backing were even rarer. This blank talisman would determine the harvest for a long time to come...

"Li Yuanjiao... logically, he should be the future successor to Li Tongya's position, suppressing external families. His cultivation talent is quite excellent, only slightly inferior to Li Qinghong's... Li Qinghong has a strong desire for the Dao, is diligent in cultivation, and has the highest compatibility with talisman seeds since the founding of the Li Family. It truly is a difficult choice..." Lu Jiangxian mumbled as he pinched another wisp from the cloud, extracting a gray talisman at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Gathering the remaining cloud, Lu Jiangxian thought to himself, Let's use the power of deduction to decide.

Lu Jiangxian, now far more skilled, had mastered many techniques in shamanic spell and talisman arts. He had used most of the power of deduction taken from Liu Changdie, and now drew another strand, using the remaining cloud as a propellant. Closing his eyes, he deduced for a moment and received only one word before him.

"Jiao."

Lu Jiangxian shrugged, flicked his finger, and the white talisman floated toward Li Yuanjiao's forehead. His vision darkened as he saw a jade-colored brush stroke sketch out the words‚ÄîFlowing Qi Swallowing Spirit.

The bearer of this talisman could absorb qi swiftly, command clouds, disperse spirit mist, and ascend freely between heaven and earth.

The thin writing in the second line exuded a chilling aura‚ÄîIce Bones Frosty Flesh.

This talisman qi could also enhance the efficiency of qi absorption, allowing one to command snow and ice, greatly benefiting the cultivation of frost-related techniques.

"The Li Family does not have any frost techniques..."

Lu Jiangxian glanced at the options, then picked the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit talisman before sending the gray talisman into Li Qinghong's Shenyang Mansion.

After a pause, a dark red seal script[1] appeared before his eyes, looking extremely fierce and bearing the words‚ÄîVast Sky Fierce Sparrow.

The bearer of this talisman could move with exceptional agility, adept in both evasion and combat. Their bravery would be intensified at the sight of blood, enhancing their blood qi... making them formidable in battle and masters of wind manipulation.

"Not bad."
ùìØùôßùôöùíÜùô¨ùôöùíÉùô£ùô§ùíóùìÆùìµ.ùôòùô§ùô¢

Lu Jiangxian flicked his finger once more, embedding the talisman qi into Li Qinghong's Shenyang Mansion.

A sense of curiosity stirred in his heart as he mused, This talisman qi is indeed peculiar, varying so distinctly in each person... This Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow talisman seems similar to Li Tongya's Deep Ocean Long Whale talisman. When Li Xiangping received his talisman, the offering was merely an early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm demon, yet he acquired the Evade Death, Prolong Life divine ability. While the quality of the talisman qi is significant, it seems like its recipient matters too...
