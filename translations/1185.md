# Chapter 1185: The Rank Designation of Treasured Earth

His voice was resolute, echoing through the vast celestial land. The multi-hued clouds in the sky quivered at his words. Behind a hazy curtain, a golden light pulsed. The Dao Rector paused for a moment before speaking.

"Let chaos reign—how could it possibly reach Myriad-Prosperity Heaven?"

His voice remained as placid as still water.

"Our Myriad-Prosperity Dao Palace is the foremost palace of Tongxuan Palace. Our Founder is ranked among the Five Immortals below the Profound. He cultivated according to the Profound Image of the Tongxuan Master, making Him a renowned Tongxuan Immortal. Even Wuguang must show us due respect. What have we to fear from a world in turmoil?"

Wang Ziya felt the words lodge in his throat, leaving him momentarily stunned. The being behind the curtain spoke again, a hint of emotion coloring his tone.

"When our Founder passed from this world, he left instructions that our Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition was to keep to itself and not violate the immortal codes. For thousands of years, this venerable one has not stepped outside, even if the heavens themselves were to collapse. That is how we have preserved ourselves to this day. It is you who has now been moved by ambition..."

His tone turned accusatory.

"But a chaotic era gives rise to many Divine Monarchs and Imperial Monarchs. The divinity of Earth Virtue lies in establishing a domain. What ability do you have to achieve the intercalary status needed for such a feat?"

Hearing this, Wang Ziya cried out against the injustice, knocking his head on the ground.

"What ambition could this disciple possibly have!"

"If you have no ambition, then why is your resolve shaken by this chaotic era and the sight of a Left-Hand Path!"

The Dao Rector's voice was haunting. Wang Ziya gritted his teeth and replied.

"Because I feel it is an injustice to the disciples of our Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition!"

His answer caused the light within to burn hotter. Wang Ziya was already an old Daoist who had cultivated for many long years. When his temper flared, he feared nothing.

"This junior fails to understand. While the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao may be a divergent path of demons and heresy, it is still a viable method for engaging with the world. This old man may lack the skill to establish a divine domain, but what of the many disciples in this grotto-heaven? If we permitted the path of the Purple Mansion Golden Core, how many of them could extend their cultivation by centuries, giving them a chance to attain an Auxiliary or Intercalary Position!"

"Nourishing one's nature by absorbing qi is all well and good, but now everyone rushes headlong into this ancient Immortal Dao. How many years have been squandered? And when they inevitably fail, they are told they simply lack the destiny to become an immortal ancestor... What a monstrous error!"

He clenched his jaw.

"Since you brought up my Grandmaster... did you know he had two sons? They were full brothers, both with meager talent and faint life-mandates. Grandmaster knew they were not destined for greatness in cultivation, so he secretly sent Qu Tan to the Qusi... And just as he predicted... Qu An cultivated in Myriad-Prosperity Heaven his entire life and died a minor acolyte, barely able to even manipulate his qi. But Qu Tan... he eventually became a Daoist Master!"

"What a world of difference lies between them!"

Having poured out all his thoughts in a rush, he pressed his forehead firmly to the ground again.

"I implore the Dao Rector to grant this request!"

Wang Ziya kept his head lowered, waiting in silence. An unknown amount of time passed before the curtain stirred faintly and a cool voice drifted out.

"The Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao... most of its practitioners are driven by greed. The more people who cultivate it, the more turmoil is stirred up in the world. You have cultivated for hundreds of years. How can you debate me on such a fundamental principle?"

"Of the three great Immortal-Demon Wars, two were caused by the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao... I see the fourth is not far off. Do you wish for our Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition to contribute yet another chaos-monger to this world?"

The rebuke left Wang Ziya speechless. His expression was complex, and he found himself at a loss for words. The Dao Rector behind the curtain, however, softened his tone slightly.

"You don't understand the gravity of the situation... This Left-Hand Path was originally under the command of demon lords. By coupling one's life-mandate, a demonic embryo is raised, instantly shedding the mortal form. One then roams and cultivates with a Dharma Body, often using blood sacrifice and drawing heavenly condemnation. Because the physical form is abandoned, one is greatly tormented by the three calamities. It is an utterly wretched path..."

"The reason it was called a 'celestial embryo' was because cultivators abandoned the Dao Body they were born with far too early, using their original body as a demonic embryo to host their Dharma Body... It was mostly practiced by lower-level cultivators. As the Encompassing Profoundity Orthodoxy entered the world, this path was heavily suppressed and gradually faded away, which allowed the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao to rise to prominence."

"It's unknown which of the Three Profoundities studied the celestial embryo and refined it with profound arts. Instead of coupling the life-mandate, they simply nurtured one's nature, an extreme Quest for Gold. Once one could resonate with a Profound Mystery position, their life-mandate would naturally be completed..."

"It is a wondrous method, certainly, but it destines its practitioners to seek everything externally, endlessly accumulating things without rest, stirring up chaos to seek the recognition of a Profound Mystery position... After the order of the Heavenly Dao collapsed, some even picked up old scriptures and revived ancient ways, making great use of blood sacrifice. They used techniques like the 'Diverse Mansion Co-forging Art' to create a Diverse Mansion, a crude imitation of the ancient demonic embryo, to gain some shallow power. It is precisely because the order has collapsed that these old traditions have reared their heads again... When will the strife in this world ever cease?"

Wang Ziya knocked his head on the floor several times with loud thuds. He lowered his gaze and said,

"The Dao Rector thinks on a grand scale, but this junior only wishes to give my fellow disciples a chance... Even if this art is forbidden within the grotto-heaven, I ask that you allow Junior-Nephew Wu to leave early, so as not to hinder his progress."

"He is no peerless genius. He has no backing or support. Even with the name of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition... he will only end up laboring for the benefit of others..."

The curtain stirred, as if the figure within realized he could not persuade him. A nod of agreement was finally given. Only then did Wang Ziya rise, a smile gracing his features. He lifted the Crystalline Jade Branch and said formally, 

"I have found an excellent disciple for you from the mortal world!"

He carried the Crystalline Jade Branch right up to the curtain before retreating. Then he picked up the ceramic urn and sighed.

"And a Profound Medicine from the Guanhua Dao Lineage..."

The Dao Rector listened carefully as he recounted the entire story, still in a state of disbelief.

"It truly is a Profound Medicine..."

Wang Ziya had long since exhausted his amazement at the item.

He simply said, "I have heard that in ancient times there were immortal medicines. Since the Guanhua tradition cultivates under the Lesser Yin, they must have had some left over from that era. Later, someone cultivated within the Weak Water, which allowed for its preservation. I don't know its exact origins..."

His words, however, made the Dao Rector behind the curtain shake his head.

"You only know half the story. In ancient times, there were five categories of immortal medicines: the Divine, the Indestructible, the Undying, the Inundating Water, and the Yang Talisman. There are also five medicines of Daoist Masters: the Sacrificial, the Gold, the Stone, the Profound, and the Transmutation. This is precisely a Profound Medicine... Though precious, it is a creation of a later age... Today, only a handful of lineages know how to concoct it. This one was likely bestowed by Mount Luoxia."

This was a legend of truly ancient times. Even Wang Ziya couldn't help but raise his eyebrows.

"There were five categories of immortal medicine! I wonder what treasures they were?"

The Dao Rector chuckled.

"I cannot recognize them all. I only know that the Yang Talisman was the medicine of the Supreme Yang. It was the first to be lost to time, yet its fame is the greatest. It is said that by consuming this medicine, one would immediately gain the bearing of Yuyi and could become an official of the sun!"

"Don't look down on the Yuyi Immortals for being subordinates. In ancient times, people wouldn't have traded that position even for a common Auxiliary or Intercalary Position!"

At these words, not only did Wang Ziya look up in shock, but even Lu Jiangxian, who had been observing quietly from the side, showed a flicker of emotion.

'The Woven Jade Dao of Yuyi... so there is such a path one can walk...'

But while he was lost in thought, the Dao Rector had continued speaking.

"As for the five medicines of Daoist Masters, four of them require Metallic Essence as an ingredient. Only immortals who have attained a position can refine them. Transmutation Medicine is for transformation, Profound Medicine is for reincarnation, Stone Medicine is for reviving the living, and Gold Medicine is the most precious, used for reincarnating to seek the Dao. It requires an entire portion of Metallic Essence!"

"Only the Sacrificial Medicine is an item of the Encompassing Profoundity. It is also an extremely wondrous thing, capable of silently perfecting one's life-mandate, enhancing one's constitution, improving one's aptitude, and elevating one's divine abilities..."

Lu Jiangxian's head snapped up, a look of genuine astonishment finally on his face.

'Perfecting one's life-mandate, enhancing one's constitution, improving one's aptitude, and elevating one's divine abilities...'

What was this?

Talisman Qi!

He had spent years in the mirror, witnessing the miraculous effects of Talisman Qi. He had even seen it act as a conduit, elevating Chi Buzi's Pristine Water divine ability. Hearing the word 'Sacrificial,' how could he not be suspicious? He was already seventy or eighty percent certain!

'Among the five medicines sought by ancient Daoist Masters, the Sacrificial Medicine is very likely Talisman Qi. Even if it isn't, it is almost certainly closely related to it!'

This Profound Medicine of Reincarnation, which the Guanhua Dao Lineage had passed down for generations and treated as a priceless treasure, was merely on par with the Talisman Qi that every member of the Li clan possessed—something they even used wastefully to supplement their cultivation.

The only thing that gave Lu Jiangxian pause was the mention of Encompassing Profoundity.

'Back then, beneath the Lingyang Immutable Palace, the Encompassing Profoundity Orthodoxy once inscribed "Alchemists Must Hearken to Me," which shows that since ancient times, sacrifice has been a method of their tradition... After all, it belongs to the Heavenly Dao...'

This was somewhat at odds with Lu Jiangxian's own speculations about his past life's background. He couldn't find an answer now, but there was a silver lining.

'By this logic, it's perfectly normal for the Li clan, as descendants of the Wei-Li of the Encompassing Profoundity, to have preserved the tradition of sacrifice from ancient times. It even serves as evidence of their status as the orthodox Wei-Li...'

He pondered for a moment. Wang Ziya glanced expectantly at the curtain and said in a low voice,

"This matter was entrusted to us by Wei Xuanyin, the current successor of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao. If we agree, then this reincarnated and re-cultivating 'Horn Wood' Daoist Master will fall into our Dao!"

The Dao Rector also showed a trace of delight, saying quietly,

"He certainly knows how to choose a lineage... This is a fine path. 'Horn Wood' is not like 'Upright Wood,' which is incorruptible in death. Horn Wood is the wood of life and proliferation. The moment it falls, it immediately rots and turns to mud, which is known as decaying soil. When a mountain has decaying soil, it collapses, which is transformation, and is thus considered 'Proclaimation Earth.' When earth has decaying soil, it becomes fertile, which is nourishment, and is thus considered 'Treasured Earth.' It fits perfectly within our Dao!"

Wang Ziya hadn't considered it in such detail. Only now did he realize how much thought had gone into it. He exclaimed in admiration, "This is a great fortune, an affinity between our Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition and the Guanhua!"

Lu Jiangxian had researched Proclaimation Earth extensively and had already considered this point. As he mused, his gaze finally fell upon the ceramic urn. In truth, his divine sense had been hovering over it from the very beginning. The spiritual senses of these minor cultivators couldn't see through it, but he saw its contents as clear as day.

'So this is a Profound Medicine.'

Inside the urn was an origin-embryo refined from all sorts of spiritual materials. Its application was extremely ingenious, like a core but not a core, like an artifact but not an artifact. It was arguably the most profound treasure Lu Jiangxian had ever seen, a true testament to its creator's Dao-Profundity.

'Using porcelain of Returning Earth as the container, filled with a meticulously blended, ultimate Valley Water, and within it is sunk a peculiar Wu Earth Life-Mandate Origin-Embryo refined from True Fire and Mansion Water...'

This item was undoubtedly a gift from the Mount Luoxia lineage. Not only that, but in Lu Jiangxian's view, this Wu Earth Life-Mandate Origin-Embryo had definitely been tempered with Wu Earth Metallic Essence, making it seem as if it were a natural creation!

Lu Jiangxian had seen Penglai's methods of rebirth before. At that time, Li Xijun was supported by Talisman Qi, which secretly nourished his life-mandate. Therefore, Daoist Master Pu Yu had taken a different path, regenerating through a secret art...

'Penglai must have other methods as well. Different traditions have their own ways of refining Profound Medicines...'

But no matter how wondrous it was, once it entered his divine sense, it was analyzed completely. Not to mention, that sliver of Qi Lanyan's True Spirit was already in his pocket.

While he was thinking, Wang Ziya had already kowtowed and withdrawn, leaving only the two world-shaking treasures before the curtain. Lu Jiangxian finally averted his gaze, his attention falling upon the curtain itself.

It was called a curtain, but it was no more than ten inches across, more like a veil of gauze. It was simply draped over an altar, giving it a natural appearance.

This was a Rank Designation.

The immortal Xu Xiang was, after all, a renowned great cultivator of the Three Profoundities. It was not surprising for him to leave a Dharma Treasure behind in the grotto-heaven. But this was no ordinary Dharma Treasure; it was a Rank Designation, mortgaged against his Fruition Attainment!

Although this Rank Designation had an extremely high origin, it did not appear as imposing as the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. Instead, it exuded an aura of profound concealment and obfuscation.

'It is founded upon the "receptivity" of Treasured Earth's concealing soil. A peculiar Rank Designation that has claimed almost all the receptive characteristics of that Fruition Attainment!'

This wondrous power was so vast that the entire Myriad-Prosperity Heaven was hidden beneath it, isolated from the world. Lu Jiangxian could see but not reach an ordinary grotto-heaven, and if not for the presence of Qi Lanyan, whose name had been registered, this Myriad-Prosperity Heaven would also be shrouded in a faint veil!

He could almost certainly conclude that this item was specifically used by Xu Xiang to protect Myriad-Prosperity Heaven.

And what was even more wondrous... the method used to construct this Myriad-Prosperity Heaven was exceptionally profound. The more he looked, the more familiar it seemed. In a few moments, he had seen through it. This grotto-heaven was established using that ancient immortal art, the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core!

'Although there are slight deviations, it's at least seventy or eighty percent similar in how the azure aether is established.'

This meant the grotto-heaven was created with the aid of Xu Xiang's status, using his position to conceal it. Since he was also the master of the 'Treasured Earth' Fruition Attainment, the depth of this grotto-heaven's concealment was second only to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance!

But Xu Xiang had already left this realm and logically shouldn't have been able to maintain it for long. It was this Rank Designation that had taken Xu Xiang's place in guarding the grotto-heaven, allowing this concealment to be constantly maintained. The grotto-heaven, in turn, became an ingenious restraint and vessel, resonating with the Rank Designation of receptive soil, preventing it from returning to the Fruition Attainment. The two sustained each other, achieving a balance that was both brilliant and subtle!

Based on Lu Jiangxian's judgment, when the True Monarch of Nurturing Life and Prosperous Treasures left this realm, his Dao-Profundity must have been approaching the level of an Immortal Lord to possess such divine abilities!

'No wonder he is so famous. To lower-level cultivators, his name is the most renowned in the Tongxuan Daoist tradition, even eclipsing that of the head disciple. It's a pity... I don't know if it's because he only cultivated the "Establishment of the Azure Aether" and not the "Evasion of Calamity and Tribulation," or if he was simply unwilling to hide...'

But even such a supreme treasure slowly faded under his gaze, gradually revealing the appearance of the Dao Rector who controlled the entire Myriad-Prosperity Heaven.

Behind the faint curtain, within a small, profound cavern, was a single round object. Its hair and beard billowed like tangled threads of bronze and iron. Embedded in its face, a pair of earthy-yellow eyes blazed with the light of a scorching sun.

It was a severed head!

The mark at the neck was perfectly neat, severed by some sharp weapon, revealing a pristine white windpipe. Upon its smooth forehead, its long, bronze-colored hair was tied back loosely, secured by a black Daoist crown. Faintly visible on the crown were densely packed runes—it appeared to be the head of a Daoist.
