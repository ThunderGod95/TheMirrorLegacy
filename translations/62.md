# Chapter 63: The Sacrificial Ritual Method

After bidding farewell to Li Chejing, Li Tongya saw his father coming from the backyard, his hands clasped behind his back. With a stern expression, he instructed in a raspy voice, “Go and take a look at that mirror.”

Tian Shoushui, Li Xiangping’s father-in-law, had passed away two years ago. He left behind a collection of wooden toys for his grandson, Li Xuanfeng. Ranging from wooden horses to bows, the collection was complete. Tragedy struck when Li Xuanfeng was at such a tender age that he could only pick up the smallest pine wood doll—Tian Shoushui slipped and fell while moving in the heavy snow, ultimately succumbing to his injuries that very night.

Li Mutian had personally buried Tian Shoushui and spent an entire night conversing in front of the grave with Ren Ping’an. The chill of that night had greatly taken a toll on Li Mutian’s health, leaving his voice permanently hoarse.

The three of them were former soldiers. Tian Shoushui was the brave one, Li Mutian was the cautious one, and Ren Ping’an was the quiet one. Now, the brave one had succumbed to his injuries and passed away. The cautious one now had a large family, but his once sharp mind had gradually turned dull. Meanwhile, the quiet one continued to oversee Jingyang Village on behalf of the Li Family, ensuring the annual land taxes were dutifully paid without fail.

The death of Tian Shoushui had been quite a blow to Li Mutian, causing him to age rapidly over the past few months. Thanks to Li Chejing’s spells and supplements, he seemed to be looking slightly better lately.

His outward appearance had improved and his white hair had regained luster, yet his eyes betrayed a lingering fatigue. Although he could still stand up straight, he could not mask the slight slowness in his movements and speech.

Li Tongya walked up to his old man to assist him, only to be curtly dismissed. Li Mutian muttered irritably, “Didn’t I tell you to check on the mirror in the backyard?”

With a wry smile, Li Tongya headed to the backyard. Meanwhile, Li Mutian made his way to the threshold of the courtyard door, using the wall as support. Leaning against the door frame, he sat down and massaged his weak leg with his frail hands.

“Damn it. I can’t believe I’ll have to rely on a walking cane soon, too,” he muttered.

In the backyard, Li Tongya studied the mirror that was hovering under the moonlight. He noticed blurry words appearing across its surface and quickly extended his spiritual sense toward the mirror.

Lu Jiangxian’s divine sense reacted within the mirror. He recalled the set of instructions he had made last night based on the Essence Conversion Technique’s requirements, then coined a new name for it before sending it to Li Tongya’s spiritual sense.

A wealth of information immediately surged through Li Tongya’s mind, manifesting as a new technique: The Sacrificial Ritual Method.

This method requires the ritualistic slaughtering of monsters as part of a sacrificial ceremony, conducted amidst the burning incense of the entire clan. The offerings of incense, soul, blood essence, and spiritual power to the mirror will be returned with a talisman qi.

The talisman qi has a range of miraculous effects, including enhancing one’s cultivation, sharpening the six senses, strengthening bones, improving innate abilities, and remedying various deficiencies...

Since there were more details in the Sacrificial Ritual Method, Li Tongya had to close his eyes and absorb the knowledge for about fifteen minutes before opening his eyes, feeling astounded.

He hastily fetched a carving pen and blank wooden slip, then began to document the technique he received. By the time he was done, it was already dawn and he quickly rushed out to find Li Xiangping.

————

Li Xiangping was cultivating in the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche. Ever since he reached the Azure Essence stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm not long ago, his progress had significantly slowed down. At this rate, breaking through to the Jade Capital stage seemed a distant goal, requiring six or seven years at least. A failed attempt could potentially double that time.

Just yesterday, the Wan Family had sent Wan Yuankai to negotiate a plan against Ji Dengqi. Wan Yuankai had successfully condensed the Jade Capital Chakra and broken through the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

“It seems like the Wan Family now has two cultivators of the Jade Capital stage. And with their head, Wan Xiaohua, having reached the Jade Capital stage five years ago, it’s likely he’s already broken through the Nascent Spirit stage and attained the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm,” Li Xiangping murmured to himself.

He narrowed his eyes thoughtfully.

Our family has grown stronger, but so has the Wan Family. The urgency of their pleas for assistance continues to escalate. It’s likely that the Ji Family is growing stronger too.

The three families are now in a state of latent growth. The Ji Family is consolidating their new territories, the Wan Family is silently building up their power, and our family is steadily growing too. Sooner or later, confrontation will be inevitable once the Ji Family has completed their territorial consolidation, the Wan Family bares their fangs, and our family is strong enough to fight. We better start preparing as soon as possible.

Just as Li Xiangping was analyzing the situation of the three families, he saw his second brother, Li Tongya, coming into the cave with a wooden slip in hand.

“Take a look at this, Third Brother,” he offered with a smile.

With a puzzled expression, Li Xiangping unfurled the slip and read, “The Sacrificial Ritual Method?”

His astonishment grew as he read. “This seems rather similar to the Reception Method, which uses the mirror as a medium. Did you receive it from the mirror itself?”

Li Tongya nodded with a smile, then retrieved the Celestial Moon Slash technique manual from one of the shelves and began reading it carefully.

After reading for a while, Li Xiangping reflected, “This method requires incense offerings from a thousand people and a demon of the Embryonic Breathing Realm in exchange for a gray talisman, the incense offerings of ten thousand people and a demon of the Foundation Establishment Realm for a white talisman... That’s quite a challenging feat.”

Li Tongya’s smile faded slightly as he answered with a troubled look on his face, “Tempting as it is, even the simplest sacrifice ritual is beyond our family’s current capabilities.”

Li Xiangping chuckled, then carefully put away the wooden slip. “There’s no rush. Besides, it’s not that easy to find demons of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. By the way, there’s something else I wish to discuss with you.”

He glanced at Li Tongya, who was reading a sword technique manual on a stone stool, then proposed, “I’m considering forming a militia with representatives from each of the four villages, one from five households, trained in martial arts to prepare for emergencies.”

Li Tongya, sensing the gravity of the situation, nodded and asked, “Has the Wan Family sought assistance again? Are things that dire already?”

Li Xiangping shook his head and replied, “Not only them. I’m also concerned about Mount Yue in the west. The spiritual energy at the northern foot of Mount Dali is slowly recovering too. Although the people from Mount Yue haven’t been seen for years, it’s best to be prepared.”

“You’re right.” Li Tongya nodded in agreement, then said, “Waiting until those on Mount Yue threaten our borders to organize village guards would be too late. Not only do they have shamans, but there are also barbarians with long hair and tattoos among them. They are undoubtedly formidable opponents.”

Li Xiangping rose to his feet, straightening his clothes with a smile. “Xuanxuan is still too young to command respect, and despite Qiuyang’s age and influence, I’m hesitant to entrust this task to others. I would feel more at ease if you personally oversee this, Second Brother.”

“Don’t worry, leave it to me,” Li Tongya assured him with a smile.

The two brothers exited the cave dwelling and chatted with each other on their way back to Mount Lijing. Liu Rouxuan was already waiting for them at the courtyard entrance and quickly walked up to them as soon as she saw them.

“Young Chief,” Liu Rouxuan greeted and bowed slightly to Li Xiangping.

Her face then lit up with delight as she stepped closer to Li Tongya and said, “My dear, I’m pregnant.”

Li Tongya’s face instantly brightened up with joy as well. He laughed heartily as he lifted her in his arms. “For real?” he asked.

“Of course! What cause would I have to lie to you?” Liu Rouxuan’s cheeks flushed as she retorted softly.

Li Xiangping chuckled at both of them and said, “Congratulations, Second Brother.”
