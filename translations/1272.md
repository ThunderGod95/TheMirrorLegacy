# Chapter 1272: Lu An

Xiangxiang.

In the skies above, purple clouds churned, while the earth below was a field of splendor. Flashing restrictions and undulating silver light could be seen, within which pavilions, some ruined and some whole, lay dormant, exuding an intoxicating aura.

Li Que'wan descended on the wind, a sigh escaping her lips.

‘The sheer abundance of resources in Luoxia is astonishing. No wonder it has produced so many talents over the last millennium!’

She was not the only one in awe. Nearby, Jia Zan, having arranged matters for Tao Jiexing and his own juniors, had rushed out to watch. He too stared, speechless for a long moment.

His Jia Clan had always been unassuming in Luoxia. As in-laws of the Wei Clan, they had received many favors, yet in a thousand years, this was the first time they had been the ones to shelter the Wei. Jia Zan himself had never imagined the Mountain's Edge Hall would be this magnificent!

‘I fear it may be second only to the Tao Clan...’

The old man gazed for a moment, his eyes welling with tears.

‘Without high-level cultivators in positions of power, all glory and nobility are but fleeting smoke.’

No matter how splendid they were or how deep their foundations, they were ultimately just a clan. When fortune turned, they faced the calamity of their divine abilities being severed. The Wei, Ju, and Qiao clans were all proof of this. Even at the height of their power, when the Wei Clan could make all of Luoxia hang on their every breath and even the Tao Clan had to yield to them, now in their time of decline they were less respectable than the upstart Yu Clan.

‘The foundation remains, but the descendants no longer have the ability to use it!’

He stood with his back stooped, as if he had aged a great deal, yet he forced a smile as he hurried before the young woman and spoke softly,

“I have inquired about all the secret arts and techniques. I will now lead the immortal maiden to retrieve them.”

Li Que'wan offered a polite smile in return.

“Senior is too kind. This junior is merely following orders to gather the spiritual items. Their disposal is for the Great King to decide; I cannot claim to be taking them for myself.”

Jia Zan shook his head and sighed.

“Throughout history, once a celestial mountain is conquered, its treasures are to be swept clean. The only exception was when the Great Zhao conquered Luo by proclamation; Fu Qiyan fell before he had the chance to collect them. Otherwise, those in the Purple Mansion Realm would have been spared, while those who were not would have perished. It is the same now. If you do not take these things, immortal maiden, do you truly think we can hold onto them?”

The old man stood with his hands clasped behind him, sighing again and again. Li Que'wan felt she could say no more, so she simply followed him into the grand hall, listening as he spoke.

“I have taken stock of the inventory. There are a few items that will be useful to a Daoist Master, so I thought to bring them out first.”

The doors to the hall rumbled open, and a light bloomed in the darkness. On a high platform, wisps of crimson light emanated from a box, inside which countless wondrous transformations shifted restlessly. Li Que'wan’s expression changed slightly. She took a step forward and saw, as she had expected, a crimson and white stone of mercury lying within the box, pulsing as if it were breathing.

Jia Zan forced a smile. Seeing her reaction, he knew she had recognized it. He spoke in a low voice,

“This item is called the Three Primal Mercury... Since the immortal maiden cultivates the Whole Pill Dao, I imagine I need not say more.”

How could Li Que'wan not know of it?

This item was as precious as the Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue. Because it was tinged with a trace of Harmonising Metal Qi, it was all the more unique. It was said to possess the ability to empower spell arts, making it an exceptional material for forging spellblades.

Ancient cultivators often used this item to craft Spiritual Artifacts as well. Due to its gentle nature and wondrous properties, it was a common addition to many Whole Pill Spiritual Treasures—it was even said that the Un-harming Stone of the Great Xiukui Monastery was made with it!

‘This is a sizeable piece! It could serve not just as a supplementary component, but as one of the primary materials!’

She was deeply tempted, but feigned a look of shock and replied,

“How rare! Only an aristocratic clan could have preserved such a spiritual item—did Golden Oneness truly not come to claim it?”

At the mention of Golden Oneness, Jia Zan’s expression grew complicated. He explained,

“The Azure Profoundity High Sect did indeed make inquiries through various channels, and some rumors reached our ears. Generally, however, items hidden within a mystic realm are exceedingly difficult for outsiders to divine. Back then, Old Master Wei had taken this item to verify his Metal Virtue and had no intention of handing it over... so it was overlooked.”

Li Que'wan nodded and smiled.

“Which Dao did the venerable Old Master Wei cultivate?”

Jia Zan lowered his gaze.

“The 'Wandering Metal' Dao... He was a genius in his own right, but it was his misfortune to encounter the Wandering Metal Dao... He squandered his entire life before reaching the Purple Mystery. He later traveled to Yinghua and entered his final meditation there.”

Li Que'wan nodded silently. She stored the spiritual item away and stepped out of the hall, only to pause, her gaze turning toward the south. Jia Zan sensed it as well and, greatly alarmed, took a step back, a horsetail whisk already in his hand.

Unseen until now, a figure was standing against the setting sun!

The man stood eight feet tall, with a commanding presence. He wore a Daoist robe, a golden sword hanging at his waist. His eyes were narrow, fixed upon the two of them as a potent golden qi surged from his body. He approached slowly, step by step.

Upon seeing the man, Jia Zan adopted a humble posture and hurried forward with a smile.

“Daoist Master Lu... Greetings, Daoist Master Lu!”

The man ignored him, his sharp gaze holding a hint of disdain. He remained silent, rebuffing the old man’s fawning words. As he drew near, Jia Zan began to break out in a cold sweat and tried again with a smile,

“Daoist Master... have you come seeking King Wei?”

The man finally raised an eyebrow and sneered.

“Daoist friend Jia, you seem to be living quite comfortably!”

Jia Zan had expected the Lu Clan’s attitude to be poor, but he never thought their representative would be so openly malicious from the very start. He could neither afford to provoke the Lu Clan nor claim to be in the right, so he could only retreat another step and say politely,

“Why does Daoist Master Lu say such a thing... I was merely following the tide of events...”

The Daoist Master’s eyes grew fiercer. With a flick of his sleeve, he flipped the golden sword from his waist into his hand, raised it, and pointed it directly at Jia Zan, his voice cold.

“Nonsense! There is no one more shameless than an old fool like you!”

Jia Zan felt a wave of menacing golden qi wash over him. With a sword pointed at his face, he secretly gritted his teeth and retreated once more.

“Daoist Master, you overstate things!”

After just a few words, Li Que'wan had grown wary. Sensing the situation was turning sour, she stepped forward and said gravely,

“Daoist Master Jia has already pledged allegiance to Song and is the garrison commander of Xiangxiang. By drawing your sword, friend Daoist, are you acting on behalf of the Zhao Court?”

The man turned his head, his sharp eyes locking onto Li Que'wan as he spoke softly,

“Are you Daoist Master Suyun?”

Li Que'wan nodded calmly and replied,

“I am. And you are, Your Excellency…?”

The man clasped his hands behind his back, his demeanor toward her noticeably less frigid. He spoke in a measured tone,

“I am Lu An, of the Lu Clan from Chun City in Gu Prefecture. The Daoist Master who was captured by King Wei is my younger kinsman.”

‘As I thought...’

Lu Fu had been captured alive by Li Zhouwei and suppressed within a Spiritual Treasure, a truly miserable fate. It was only natural for the Lu Clan to come seeking his return. However, Li Zhouwei had campaigned in every direction, pacifying the entire Luoxia region in the blink of an eye with world-shaking momentum, which made the Lu Clan’s response seem rather slow.

Li Que'wan took a step forward, shielding Jia Zan.

“Has Daoist Master Lu come to demand an explanation?”

The anger in Lu An’s eyes deepened.

“You underestimate me. Our nations are at war. His capture by King Wei was due to his own inferior skill. What grounds are there for demanding an explanation? However, this old ingrate refused to provide aid. That is something I, Lu, cannot overlook!”

Seeing Li Que'wan shield him, Jia Zan grew anxious. Lu An’s words ignited a fire in his heart, but he suppressed his temper and stepped forward.

“King Wei’s divine might is boundless, and I, Jia, am willing to serve him to the death! Though I knew Daoist Master Lu Fu, we were but passing acquaintances. How can you speak of ingratitude?”

The golden sword in Lu An’s hand tightened, its light growing brighter. He laughed in fury.

“You, whose surname is Jia! When Luoxia was first settled, your Jia Clan migrated from the lands of Long. It was through my Lu Clan’s mediation that your family was settled in such a fertile place… Do you still remember how you wagged your tail and begged for pity back then?”

He sneered.

“You claim you have not been ungrateful? If you dare swear a Dao oath before me now that you truly intended to mount a rescue over Xiangxiang and were merely too late to arrive, then I, Lu, will never hold this against you again!”

Jia Zan’s face alternated between ashen and pale. He was stunned and truly did not dare to answer. Shame and indignation warred within him, and his anger swelled.

“For a thousand years, has the Jia Clan ever failed to treat the Lu Clan with the utmost hospitality when you passed through Xiangxiang? On the several occasions Gu Prefecture was besieged, was it not my Jia kinsmen who were the first to respond? Even if your Lu Clan helped settle us back then, my ancestor paid with a spiritual item. Was that not enough?”

He gritted his teeth.

“It seems that for a single act of assistance, the Lu Clan expects a thousand years of subservient gratitude!”

“The audacity!”

That sentence ignited the Daoist Master’s fury. A flash of golden-white light flared as sword qi swept out. Li Que'wan immediately took a step forward, her expression frosty. Forming a seal with two fingers, she met the golden light head-on!

She cared little for the feud between the two clans, but Jia Zan was the most cooperative of the Purple Mansion cultivators in Luoxia. His level of power aside, his contributions were significant. If he were to be injured so easily, not only would it demoralize others, but it would also damage Li Zhouwei’s prestige!

Sand-Pointing Curse Art.

Her slender, fair fingers pinched together, catching the golden-white light. In that instant, a whistling wind arose. The brilliant golden light froze before exploding into a sky full of Cinnabar, scattering like crimson snow on the wind.

This move stunned both Jia Zan, who had retreated several steps, and Lu An. He seemed not to have expected this Daoist Master with a single divine ability to so easily neutralize his sword art. But consumed by rage, he paid it little mind. He frowned and said,

“I have no wish to harm you. Step aside!”

But before the woman could reply, the sky suddenly blazed with light. A torrent of fiery golden flame, like a meteor, grew larger as it streaked from the south. 

A cold voice echoed across the heavens.

“I gather the profound light to quell this injustice!”

A beam of radiance descended from the clouds, striking Lu An and causing his movements to falter for a fraction of a second. The golden light had already transformed into a crimson-robed youth with grim, fierce eyes. He drew back a spear and lunged, his thrust carrying the full force of his fury!

It was Li Jiangqian!

Li Jiangqian had departed from the lake and arrived at Xiangxiang. Instead of landing rashly, he had used a Spirit Probe to observe the situation from the shadows. He had never imagined he would find his own sister being harassed by a mid-stage Daoist Master. How could he possibly stand by? He descended with killing intent pouring from him!

‘Li Fire.’

Lu An frowned at once, forced to turn. He reversed his grip on his longsword, holding it flat against his forearm to block the attack. With a deafening clang, the sword met the golden spear!

In an instant, gold and fire intertwined as baleful energy roiled. With one hand, Li Jiangqian spun the long spear around. He brought two fingers to his lips, his sharp golden eyes fixed on Lu An. With a slight movement of his lips, he spat out a stream of ancient, amber-colored Li Fire.

Southern Brightness Heart-Fire!

With his divine ability newly achieved, Li Jiangqian’s fire was more potent than ever!

Lu An’s attitude towards him had been dismissive, easily blocking the spear with the flat of his blade. But as the flames surged forth, his expression finally changed subtly. He twisted aside, a small jade bowl appearing in his other hand.

As a member of the Lu Clan, he had no shortage of treasures. As a cultivator of Metal Virtue, he was naturally prepared to deal with all manner of flames!

Watery light swirled in the bowl and poured out, attempting to suppress the flickering heart-fire. But the flame was terrifyingly fierce. The spiritual bowl, deployed in haste, was momentarily pushed back by the blaze, and the Li Fire nearly licked Lu An’s face.

Both men shuddered, realizing they had underestimated their opponent. To the side, Li Que'wan was both shocked and delighted. She strode forward.

“Brother!”

Though she called out to him, the seal in her hands was already complete. The color of Cinnabar surged like a dragon, pressing toward Lu An’s back.

Lu An’s gaze flickered. He took a casual step and drifted away, effortlessly evading the myriad attacks from every direction to stand untainted in the sky.

Present Departs Old.

The sight made Li Jiangqian’s heart skip a beat, but Li Que'wan, who had received guidance from Li Zhouwei, saw it clearly. Though it was the same Present Departs Old technique, Lu An’s mastery of his divine ability and his Dao-Profundity were far greater, making his execution leagues above. She was not surprised. Seeing that he had ceased his attack, she did not press forward, but said in a solemn voice,

“Your kinsman is still being held by King Wei. We have no intention of using him as leverage, but it would be unwise for Daoist Master Lu to act so wantonly.”

Lu An’s expression was grim. He gave Li Jiangqian a long look, his actions halted by the sight of those golden eyes. He turned his cold gaze to the distant Jia Zan and said,

“My kinsman spoke recklessly. It is only right that he suffer for being captured by King Wei... If he is returned safely, we will naturally compensate you for his offensive words.”

“However, there is one thing I must ask the immortal maiden.”

He showed no trace of awkwardness. His expression turned grave as he asked quietly,

“This Profound Bestowal Glazed Talisman… does it belong to the Dantai Clan?”

Li Que'wan did not wish to bring trouble to the Dantai Clan, nor did she wish to answer him. Lu An seemed unconcerned. He turned, shot one last, icy glare at Jia Zan, and said,

“Old fool, for the sake of Ting Province, I will let you off today. But if I ever see you in the north, you will not escape these next few strikes!”

With that parting shot, his figure dissolved into a stream of golden light and vanished. Jia Zan was so furious his face was a mask of white and blue, yet he never spoke a word in retort, merely enduring it in silence. Only now did he approach and bow.

“Many thanks to both Your Highnesses!”

Li Jiangqian smiled.

“There is no need for such courtesy!”

Jia Zan had seen that pair of glittering golden eyes and observed the youth’s bearing and similar features. He understood at once.

‘This must be the Eldest Prince.’

A brief glance was all it took for the old man to sense that this newcomer was not someone to be trifled with, likely far more difficult to serve than the immortal maiden before him. But at this point, he no longer cared. With a heavy heart, he said in a low voice,

“From now on, I can only ask for your guidance...”

The crimson-robed youth understood his meaning. He stepped forward with a smile.

“Daoist Master Jia has forsaken darkness for the light, first by ceding Xiangxiang and pacifying Liangchuan, and then by offering this mystic realm. You are surely a great Meritorious Official. We will be sure to report your many labors.”

Despite the recent friction, he seemed to have grasped the situation quickly. He cast an unconcerned gaze over their surroundings, his mood clearly improving. He teased,

“Wan'er, you are here on orders to collect spiritual items… Have you kept an eye out for anything for your elder brother?”

Li Que'wan couldn't help but laugh.

“That will have to depend on King Wei’s arrangements.”

Jia Zan shook his head repeatedly, a look of immense relief on his face, though whether it was genuine was hard to say.

“This old man was just lamenting the difficulty of finding items for the Whole Pill Dao, feeling I had failed to repay the immortal maiden’s care... But now that I see Your Highness, I know there is a perfect way to show my gratitude—please, follow me!”

Li Jiangqian glanced at him and smiled.

“Oh? The Jia and Wei clans also have some expertise in Li Fire?”

Jia Zan smiled faintly, a rare glimmer of pride in his eyes.

“An ancestor of my Jia Clan once studied under Daoist Master Yi Chuan. The Daoist Master cultivated Lesser Yin and had mastery over water and fire. My ancestor inherited his mantle and became renowned for his Fire Virtue!”
