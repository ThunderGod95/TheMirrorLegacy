# Chapter 763: The Xia Migration

**Moongaze Lake**

Brilliant sunlight bathed Pingya Island, casting the long shadows of its towers across the stone steps. Ascending those steps tier by tier, Kong Guxi knelt before the main hall's entrance. To his left and right, cultivators hurried past, none paying him any mind.

The array formation at the Profound Peak mountain gate had been easily shattered, their ancestral lands were lost, and the entirety of Shanji Prefecture had fallen. Fu En, who had been in seclusion for a breakthrough, had died catastrophically, unleashing a pillar of Geng Earth Qi into the heavens. Yehui himself had appeared at their mountain gate, shaking the Wasteland to its core. The Kong family members could do nothing but beat their chests in despair.

The Profound Peak Gate had treated the common people and cultivators under their rule well, and their influence was deeply rooted. The half-million people who had migrated with their clan and their affiliates all wept, and a chorus of grief rose to the heavens.

The Profound Peak Gate was, for all intents and purposes, destroyed. Kong Guxi had long been prepared for this and was not surprised. Though his grief was profound, he still set about stabilizing the situation.

The fact that he had now abandoned the Wasteland to rush here for an audience was due to a single reason: Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing, had not been seen in four months, while Daoist Master Yehui was unharmed and had appeared multiple times in Shanji Prefecture.

Even more damning were the rumors spreading among the great clans and immortal sects: Daoist Master Zhaojing had been attacked by Yehui and another Daoist Master working in concert. Whether he had fallen was unknown, but at the very least, he was said to be gravely wounded somewhere in the Eastern Sea.

The news had made Kong Guxi’s legs weak. Hearing further that the northern Funan territory was under attack, he used it as a pretext to come to the island and seek an audience with Li Jiangqian.

Now, as cultivators ignored him or shot him disdainful looks, whispering amongst themselves, Kong Guxi’s heart grew heavier. Behind him, Kong Qiuyan knelt obediently, not daring to even lift her head.

After a long wait, a voice called from above.

"Lord Kong, the Young Lord will see you".

Kong Guxi quickly gathered his robes and hurried up the steps. Passing through two sets of hall doors, he saw a young man in dark red robes seated in the main chair. It was Li Jiangqian, the current head of the household. Standing beside him was a woman in a cloud-silk dress—Li Que'wan.

Li Jiangqian had been sitting in this hall for five sleepless days. It wasn't just him; the entire Li family's upper echelon was in constant motion, while the lower ranks were silent with fear. To put it bluntly, the entire clan was frozen in a tense silence.

The situation was incredibly difficult. Kong Guxi was no longer the master of the Profound Peak Gate; he was someone to be avoided. Without access to information, he couldn't grasp the situation, but even he could smell that something was terribly wrong. How could others not?

Though the young man before him was only at the Qi Refining realm, Kong Guxi bowed with the utmost respect.

"Greetings, Young Lord".

"Lord Kong, you're too polite".

Li Jiangqian seemed calm, showing no signs of panic as he replied evenly. "Is there an urgent matter, my lord?".

Seeing Li Jiangqian’s composure, Kong Guxi felt a measure of his own anxiety subside. His main purpose for this trip was simply to see the Li family's state for himself and get a sense of his own position. He didn't dare ask too many questions, instead saying respectfully, "We were guarding the Wasteland when a group of cultivators arrived from the east. They claim to be from Crimson Reef Island and wish to gather qi. I did not dare to stop them... so I came to ask the Young Lord first".

Li Jiangqian subtly clenched his fist within his sleeve. "Gather what qi?" he asked in a low voice.

Kong Guxi replied, "The Guo family members said they wish to gather the qi of the people's lament. Over in Shanji Prefecture... Daoist Master Yehui has already given his approval. I still have half a million people in the Wasteland, all loyal followers. Their grief is potent; one can act as ten. The Guo family hopes to gather qi there".

'They came so fast...' Li Jiangqian thought, falling silent for a moment.

The relationship between the Li family and Crimson Reef Island was extremely tense. Although their Purple Mansion masters had yet to meet, there was no shortage of enmity between their subordinates. Crimson Reef was also on friendly terms with Capital immortals Dao, making this group's arrival a highly complex matter.

If Li Ximing were actually at home, waving them away would be a trivial matter. The fear was that with Li Ximing absent, Capital immortals Dao and Crimson Reef Island were colluding, using this as a pretext to interfere on the Eastern Shore.

'Daoist Master Yehui of Capital immortals Dao fought with our Daoist Master. He must be certain our Daoist Master is not at the lake. This is trouble...'.

He nodded. "I understand. Please wait for a moment, my lord. I will consult my elders and give you a reply".

Kong Guxi nodded quickly and retreated, his heart pounding with fear. Some things didn't need to be asked. Just by making this trip, the atmosphere of the situation told him more than enough.

After the man had left, the great array of the hall sealed shut. Li Jiangqian sat down, a hint of exhaustion on his face. "Wan'er," he said quietly, "I know your cultivation is important, but I had to call you out. This matter is too great".

Li Que'wan asked, a little uneasily, "The Daoist Master...".

"It's true. He has not returned for several months". Li Jiangqian rubbed his wrists. "His absence is a small matter; Capital immortals Dao's reaction is what's truly alarming. Situ Mo has crossed the mountains again and is eyeing Funan covetously. Capital immortals Dao has already consolidated its hold on Shanji Prefecture, and the situation on the Eastern Shore is growing more unstable".

"Elders Minggong and Chenghui have both gone to Funan, and Ding Weizeng and the others have gone to the Eastern Shore. Father is in seclusion. If a fight breaks out, we can only save either the Wasteland or Funan".

"What is the elders' decision?" Li Que'wan asked.

"Save Funan". Li Jiangqian’s gaze was heavy. "As I see it, if Capital immortals Dao pushes south, Purple Smoke Gate and the Sword Gate cannot sit idly by. Shanji Prefecture is easy for Capital immortals Dao to attack but hard to defend; they cannot hold it for long. Once some compromise is reached and they withdraw, the Wasteland cannot be held either".

"And if the Wasteland falls, the Xiao family will also be uncomfortable. Funan belongs to our family alone, but the Wasteland does not. It is easier to retake the Wasteland after it's lost than to save Funan once it has fallen".

Li Que'wan nodded in agreement, then added worriedly, "But this matter with Crimson Reef Island...". She paused, glanced at her brother, and then continued, "Right now, only the Purple Mansion realm and the other immortal sects know our Daoist Master is missing, so we can maintain a calm facade. But the next step is for everyone, inside and out, to know our family is in trouble... Since you are preparing countermeasures, brother, even if the Wasteland is abandoned, our weakness will be exposed sooner or later".

Li Jiangqian sighed. "Kong Guxi isn't making a scene. He hasn't shed a single tear. He's too perceptive. If a stupider leader had come and thrown a fit, our family would have the perfect excuse to abandon the Wasteland, let him rebuild the Profound Peak Gate as a buffer, and delay our weakness from being exposed...".

After a moment of thought, Li Jiangqian summoned a subordinate. "Go and make it clear to Kong Guxi. Crimson Reef shouldn't even think about causing trouble on our territory. If they want to gather qi of resentment, they can go back to their own overseas domains and collect it. They have more than they could ever use; why come to our home?".

After the man left, Li Jiangqian pulled out a letter, his brow furrowed with impatience. "I'll write to Jiangxia at once. The Wasteland can be lost, but the people of Profound Peak must be evacuated. Tell that boy to keep himself alive. If he dies at the hands of Capital immortals Dao or Crimson Reef, I, his older brother, will have to avenge him".

Li Que'wan nodded silently. She saw another figure approach from below, emerging from the shadows like the wind. He was clad in pitch-black Dharma robes with a black jade pendant at his waist, his expression grim. Li Jiangqian quickly stepped back and bowed respectfully.

"Grand-Uncle".

Li Chenghuai nodded. "I've just returned from the north. Capital immortals Dao has made a move. They've sent a man named Wang He to consolidate the power of the Wang clan in Jiangbei".

The Funan Wang clan was involved in the family's strategic layout around Xiaoshi Mountain in the north and was also key to Funan's stability. This was no small matter. "What happened?" Li Jiangqian asked. "Our family is in some trouble at the moment, and Wang Quwan is in seclusion at the lake. With the head of the Funan Wang clan absent, I fear they won't be able to stand against Wang He's influence...".

To his surprise, Li Chenghuai shook his head. "The one in charge of the Wang clan... is Wang Quwan's younger brother, Wang Quyu. He went against all opposition and barred Wang He from entry, refusing to see him. He then led a contingent of his clansmen from their home to meet your brother. They have already been integrated into the various mountain defenses and are standing guard together".

Li Jiangqian nodded slowly, pacing back and forth twice. It was the first piece of good news he had heard in a long time. Li Chenghuai also seemed pleased. "I thought that when trouble started, Funan would be the first to become unstable... After all, a large portion of the Wang clan's main branch is still under Capital immortals Dao's domain. For them to provide timely aid like this and stabilize Funan...".

"Although we still can't rule out the suspicion that they're placing bets on both sides, this move from the Wang clan is undeniably beneficial. Once this is over, they should be rewarded".

Li Jiangqian nodded. "The Wang clan has deep roots in Jiangbei; they have the capital to hedge their bets. With his own sister in seclusion at our lake, he naturally couldn't meet with Wang He. This just goes to show that Wang Quyu has excellent control over his branch of the family".

Li Chenghuai sighed. Li Jiangqian then recounted the situation with Crimson Reef Island, and the good mood from the news vanished. "The cultivators of Crimson Reef are difficult to deal with," Li Chenghuai said. "Their Merging Fire arts are exceedingly venomous, damaging one's life force and essence. We should consult with Brother Chenghui on this".

**The Eastern Shore**

In the center of the Eastern Shore's dense forests, and further east still, stood a mountain at the border between the Wasteland and the Eastern Shore proper. It was not particularly grand, but it was covered with numerous towers and pavilions, bustling with cultivators coming and going.

In the main hall at the mountain's peak, a burly, golden-eyed man rose from his meditation, his breath flowing like light. As he stepped down, several of his trusted aides immediately approached him, bowing respectfully.

"Third Young Master!".

Li Jiangxia lifted his chin. "How much time has passed?".

"Reporting to my lord, two months have passed".

Li Jiangxia's cultivation talent was extremely high, second only to his elder brother Li Jiangqian's within the family, and his resources were first-rate. He never worried about cultivation bottlenecks, only about whether his foundation was solid enough or if he had mastered enough arts. He had spent two months breaking through to the fifth layer of Qi Refining and still felt he had energy to spare. He asked in a deep voice, "Have you seen the Daoist Master?".

He was in command of the various families on the Eastern Shore, and his generous and forthright personality had naturally attracted a group of loyal followers, including many minor officials. Upon hearing his question, they all hesitated and shook their heads.

Li Jiangxia's expression immediately darkened. He had them report the latest news, and his eyelids twitched as he listened. "Where are the various lords stationed?" he asked again.

The cultivators bowed their heads and mumbled evasively. One guest elder stepped forward. He seemed to be from the Wasteland, at the early Qi Refining realm, and had only pledged allegiance in recent years. His surname was Fu, and he had switched his allegiance from the Profound Peak Gate early on.

He seemed rather clever. "Reporting to the Young Master," he said with a smile, "my family received news from Kong Guxi. Lords Minggong and Chenghui are both in the Funan territory".

Li Jiangxia looked up, taking note of the man. He glanced around and waved his sleeve. "Everyone, return to your duties. There's no need for so many of you here...". He paused, a faint, unreadable smile on his face. "Guest Elder Fu, you will stay".

The crowd hastily departed, leaving only a few of his personal aides in the hall. Just then, a Jade Court Guard brought a letter up from below. Li Jiangxia began to read it as he spoke. "You have good sources of information".

He scanned the letter in his hand and saw that his family's elders were indeed in Funan. He understood at once.

'Crimson Reef Island is also getting involved... Li Jiangqian intends to abandon the Wasteland... It's not a bad strategy, and it's easy to relocate the Profound Peak Gate's cultivators. But Li Jiangqian, oh Li Jiangqian... have you considered the half-million common people in the Wasteland?'.

'Crimson Reef Island, Capital immortals Dao—which of them isn't looking to make a profit? The moment we abandon this place, those two won't play your game of relocating people to bolster Shanji... They will be eaten clean and taken away!'.

Frustrated, he waved the Jade Court Guard away. The guest elder, Fu, was pleased with the praise and stepped forward. Seeing that only Li Jiangxia's confidants remained, he cupped his hands and whispered, "Young Master, Capital immortals Dao is watching like a tiger, and their troops will surely march east. The Wasteland and the Eastern Shore have benefited from your grace for years and are both your pillars; neither should be lost. I hope the Young Master prepares early".

Li Jiangxia stood with his hands behind his back. "What preparations?".

Guest Elder Fu lowered his voice. "When Capital immortals Dao attacks, first abandon the strongholds connecting the shores. When the enemy reaches Funan, you can dispatch troops to the Second Young Master's side to relieve his pressure. Then, when the Profound Peak arrays can no longer hold, you should cede the Wasteland and retreat to the Eastern Shore. The various lords will surely come to your rescue. The Wasteland may be lost, but the Young Master's own forces will be completely preserved".

Li Jiangxia understood his meaning instantly. He glanced at the man. "You mean the elders would come to rescue the Eastern Shore, while Funan is caught between the Golden Tang Gate and Capital immortals Dao, its rear cut off by cultivators crossing the river. My second brother's forces would be utterly routed, losing both land and men".

Guest Elder Fu simply smiled without a word. He watched as Li Jiangxia put away the letter and looked up at him. Those golden eyes flashed as he lifted his foot, revealing a boot of black iron with gold trim. Fu was stunned. "Young Master, what is...".

*BAM!*

He felt a massive force slam into him as a heavy kick landed squarely on his chest, accompanied by the sound of cracking bones. His entire body flew through the air, crashing into a pillar with a loud boom and then tumbling, breaking several more pillars before spitting out a mouthful of blood.

"Pfft!".

Li Jiangxia’s gaze was glacial, as if he were about to devour the man alive. He took a step forward, and with a sharp *shing*, he drew the sword from a nearby aide's scabbard. The bright blade pointed directly at Guest Elder Fu's forehead.

"You son of a bitch... My brother and I might squabble amongst ourselves, but that's for the Li clan to take power from the Li clan... What the hell are you? You dare come here to sow discord and play these treacherous games?!".

Guest Elder Fu didn't know where Li Jiangxia got such strength. A burning pain spread through his chest. He opened his eyes to see a pair of ruthless golden pupils staring back at him. The easygoing and generous young master was gone, replaced by someone with a terrifyingly cruel edge.

"Young Master!".

Li Jiangxia pressed the sword to his neck. An aide, who knew this man was courting death but hadn't realized how badly, quickly tried to intervene. "The Fu clan is, after all, an external family of Profound Peak. At this critical time... it is not advisable...".

'Profound Peak...'.

Li Jiangxia paused. He grabbed the man by his collar and lifted him into the air with one hand. The young man was already powerfully built, and Fu broke out in a cold sweat from the pain. He heard the youth's cold voice say, "If your words were to leave this room, everyone from Profound Peak would have to kneel on Pingya Island, and Kong Guxi would have to flay you alive to protect his ancestral lineage!".
