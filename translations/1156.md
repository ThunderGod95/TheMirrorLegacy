# Chapter 1156: A Fatal Turn

The small, ornate branch landed in a palm, sending tremors through the divine abilities of all present. The first to react was not Li Zhouwei, nor was it the cultivators of the North and South clashing across the land, but the one who stood high above the roiling Exiled Qi.

Wang Ziya!

The divine abilities of this great cultivator from grotto-heaven were consolidated and steady. It was only after his battle with the Dui Metal Sword Immortal before him grew heated that the auras of his various powers began to faintly emerge. The gourd in his hand effortlessly absorbed its surroundings, continuously sweeping the sky clean of golden qi.

It was obvious that this Spiritual Treasure, brought from grotto-heaven, had been prepared specifically for Cheng Xunzhi!

Because of this, Wang Ziya still had the capacity to observe the situation on the ground. But when he saw that ornate branch leap forth, the great cultivator’s expression changed drastically. A thick wave of fear washed over him, and he roared,

"Qi Lanyan! How dare you!"

What was the Crystalline Jade Branch?

Long ago, when Tongxuan Palace was founded, it accepted qi refiners from all corners of the world and proclaimed itself the very font of the Immortal Dao. Its three founding True Monarchs established the celestial palace and personally planted a spirit root. All the renowned Dao lineages of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition were present. In the end, they selected a disciple to manage their affairs in the mortal world; his surname was Shangguan, and his given name, Zidu.

For over a century, Shangguan Zidu presided over Tongxuan Palace as the three True Monarchs took turns preaching the Dao. Qi refiners from across the world flocked to listen. The spirit root, having absorbed so many profound truths, sought to attain a Metal nature. But alas, it fell just short. It perished on the spot, its entire body transforming into Wu Stone.

Shangguan Zidu summoned the patriarchs of the various lineages, divided the stone into seven pieces, and bestowed them upon the seven great Comprehending Profoundity branches of the era. From then on, whether those lineages split or merged, a piece of the stone would be passed down as a symbol of their shared heritage.

The piece in Qi Lanyan’s hand was the symbol of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao, a small branch from the original Guanhua Dao lineage.

Wang Ziya, of course, understood Wei Xuanyin's intentions. This artifact hadn’t been given to Qi Lanyan for battle. To hold it was to represent the honor of Guanhua; it was meant to save his life in a moment of crisis!

But that by no means implied the ancient Spiritual Treasure was weak. It had been refined and passed down by generations of Daoist Masters of Comprehending Profoundity for millennia. With that much effort, even a common stone could be refined into a Spiritual Treasure, to say nothing of an artifact with such a noble origin.

This was the source of his terror.

'He isn't a Wu Earth cultivator, but if he can unleash even a tenth of its power and kill or cripple this White Qilin, who will bear the fury of the great powers of the North and South? Guanhua? The Qi Clan?'

The last person caught off guard, Daoist Master Houfu, had been grazed by the light of the Crystalline Jade Branch and his body and soul were nearly obliterated. If not for his Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch, not even a speck of bone would have remained. Tinglan, though protected by a Spiritual Treasure of her own, had also been grievously wounded.

The Great Daoist Master was seized with panic and drew a azure stone artifact from his sleeve. The second person whose expression changed was Lin Chensheng of the Great Xiukui Monastery.

This Daoist Master could never forget how his elder had died before his very eyes. The fluctuations of Wu Earth from that small wooden box were seared into his soul. A chill crept over his body, and the vicious fires of hatred blazed in his eyes, stabbing toward Qi Lanyan like swords.

But the light came too quickly. Li Zhouwei was already at the point of exhaustion. The multicolored light in his eyes flared as he felt the world recede from him, only managing the faintest stir of his spiritual sense.

A purple talisman in his sleeve, long since saturated with dharma power, burst into flame of its own accord. The four golden characters of the Capital Immortals Great Dao flared to life, raising a vista of white mountains and purple waters before him. Spirits and deities rose up behind him, lending their power to the defense.

It was the purple-patterned talisman he had received from the Capital Immortals Dao all those years ago.

It wasn’t that the Li Clan had never acquired Purple Mansion Realm talismans, but the way of talismans had its inherent limitations. They required spiritual ink and special paper, which made them useful at lower cultivation levels. But as one’s cultivation rose, the resources became prohibitively expensive, and their cost-effectiveness plummeted.

By the Foundation Establishment Realm, their shortcomings were already apparent. At the Purple Mansion Realm, materials capable of channeling a divine ability were so costly that it was simply no longer practical. Settling for lesser materials meant a drastic drop in power. Aside from figures like Duanmu Kui or Si Boxiu, who were masters of the Shaman-Register Dao or hailed from lineages with unique inheritances, few Purple Mansion cultivators were willing to waste their efforts on talismans.

But in all fairness, the power of this talisman from Yehui was considerable. It was clearly a high-quality item obtained from grotto-heaven.

The Capital Guard divine ability it unleashed was no weaker than a defense mounted by Yehui himself. Yet as the multicolored light drifted forward, the purple waters evaporated, the white mountains crumbled, and the assembled deities bowed their heads.

It all scattered like dust on the wind.

The Heavenly Light in the sky dimmed, and the pitch-black manifestation that had cloaked the horizon vanished. The eyes that had always shone with a brilliant gold light snapped shut, and King Wei threw his head back.

"Splash!"

A soft sound broke the silence of the lake.

Wang Ziya’s face was grim. The azure stone in his hand was scalding hot and covered in thick, multicolored light, a web of cracks spreading across its surface. There was no regret in his eyes, only terror. He completely ignored the sword light racing toward his face, his gaze fixed anxiously on the youth above the water.

'I don't cultivate the Whole Pill. The divine ability of this Blade-Shifting Stone is limited... I'm afraid... I can't protect him!'

"Crack..."

A chorus of shattering sounds filled the air as the Primal Summit armor broke apart. There was no spectacular flash, no overwhelming aura. Under a dozen horrified gazes, Li Zhouwei tipped backward and fell like a falling star, crashing into the lake and sending up a colossal wave.

The battlefield fell silent. Divine abilities retracted. Every gaze, filled with shock and horror, moved like lightning to land on Qi Lanyan’s face.

The young man was still kneeling, the flesh of his face knitting itself back together at a visible rate. His eyes finally reappeared, staring south with an unwavering gaze.

Qi Lanyan’s eyes were suddenly crystal clear.

He struggled to his feet and took a step. A movement technique activated, carrying him several li in an instant. He rushed toward the lake and plunged into the water, where he finally saw the young king.

His ink-black armor was gone, replaced by a tattered, gold-patterned robe whose shredded fragments drifted in the current.

King Wei's entire upper body was bare, covered in a dense network of porcelain-like cracks. In several places, golden-white organs and bones were visible. Rivulets of blood, thick as mercury, floated in the water, coalescing into tiny golden spheres.

Qi Lanyan took a step forward, then froze.

The young man’s tightly shut eyes snapped open.

His face was a mask of colorful cracks, and his normally golden eyes were now swimming with a thick, multicolored light. His entire aura had changed, twisting into something demonic. Qi Lanyan felt the hair on his body stand on end. His throat constricted as a massive hand clamped down on him.

The man before him was trembling from head to toe, clearly enduring immense agony, yet his multicolored eyes were fixed on him, radiating an unnatural chill. Before Qi Lanyan could think, the fist fell.

Qi Lanyan’s Upright Wood Spiritual Treasure, no matter how profound, had long been dimmed by the Great Daoist Master’s Sword Intent and the three impacts from the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. It could not recover. The divine protection of Upright Wood that had enveloped him, once as unyielding as metal, had failed.

"BOOM!"

His fragile neck splintered with a series of sharp cracks. His face caved in as shimmering, elixir-like blood sprayed into the water. The face that had just finished healing shattered like porcelain under the blow.

'Ushering Spring’s Dawn'!

Qi Lanyan reacted in a flash, dissolving into verdant wind to retreat. Time seemed to resume across Lake Xian as divine abilities flared back to life with a deafening roar.

Before everyone’s eyes, the verdant wind rapidly reconverged several li away, forming Qi Lanyan’s headless body. But something else was faster: a seamless, ancient golden spear.

Descending Radiance Equal Edge!

Facing the approaching spear, Qi Lanyan froze for a heartbeat before realization dawned. Limitless fear flooded his heart. He recklessly cut off his divine ability and summoned a sword technique.

But dark clouds were already roiling overhead. Something had been lying in ambush, and now it revealed itself.

It was an object the size of a man’s arm, covered in purple-and-gold patterns and split into three flanges, upon which were carved majestic scenes of slaying demons. It was the Demonbane Cleaver Mace.

The mace had been gathering power in the clouds for some time, its range vast enough to cover half of Lake Xian, easily enveloping him. Now, it responded, and a bolt of lightning descended.

The bolt was neither silver nor purple, but an ethereal, weightless cyan. It seemed as light as a feather, yet it fell with the force of a mountain, striking Qi Lanyan squarely.

Compared to the triple thunderbolts from before, this attack was weak—weaker, even, than the storm that had covered a hundred-li radius. But as it struck the young man, it sent a tremor through his entire body, so violent that he couldn't even hold his sword.

The Demonbane Cleaver Mace’s Cloud-Patrol technique was designed for ambushes, accumulating power in the clouds to unleash a punitive thunderbolt. The Li Clan had rarely used it, but this specific bolt had a unique effect.

A direct hit inflicted overwhelming, unbearable pain.

It was a power normally used to punish disciples. By all rights, someone of Qi Lanyan’s skill should never have been struck head-on. But now, he was utterly spent and had no choice but to take the blow. In an instant, his powers scattered, and he nearly tumbled from the sky.

"Puchi..."

The Descending Radiance Equal Edge pierced through his chest.

Qi Lanyan’s headless form hung frozen in the air. A fist-sized hole ran clean through his torso, and a faint, dark-golden light pulsed around the wound, as if in response to some unseen call.

The heir of Guanhua was immobilized.

Qi Lanyan cultivated Horn Wood. When it came to suppressing injuries and healing wounds, his Dao lineage was among the best in the world. Losing a head or having his heart pierced was not, in fact, a grievous injury.

But his body began to tremble violently as a wave of intense pain and weakness flooded his mind. At his weakest moment, the Sword Intent wound at his waist had been triggered for a second time.

'He knows... that Wandering Metal is the most dangerous thing to me right now.'

Qi Lanyan knew it, too. Years of study within the Guanhua lineage and Wei Xuanyin’s personal tutelage had given him a perfect understanding of his own injuries.

'Wandering, though it consumes, does not exhaust the root. It is the metal of storing and nurturing, symbolized by a golden coffer or ore-rich earth.'

That was a direct quote from the Guanhua Dao Canon. Wandering Metal was a form of metal that nourished other things. The Dui Metal wound in his body was a latent form of Vault Metal.

'Nourished by Wandering Metal, the Vault Metal grows stronger. The injury... it becomes more severe. The first time I was hit by the Descending Radiance Equal Edge, that's what triggered the Sword Intent.'

But back then, he had two Spiritual Treasures suppressing it. Now, not only was he at the end of his rope, but he also lacked the protection of his Upright Wood Spiritual Treasure. In an instant, the Dui Metal Sword Intent flooded his entire body.

That was the fatal blow.

'Does he... understand the principle behind it? Probably not. But this White Qilin has taken lives amid chaos and bloodshed since he was a child. He knows how to seize an opportunity. That opening flashed by for an instant, but he never forgot it.'

That strike of Wandering Metal had dramatically reversed their roles. Bitterness filled Qi Lanyan’s heart as he struggled to turn and face the figure to the south.

King Wei stood in the air, a spectral presence. Spiderweb cracks of colored light covered his upper body and face, and his eyes blazed. He pointed his long halberd diagonally toward the ground, his arm trembling.

He, too, was a spent arrow.

Though his dharma body was on the verge of collapse, his Life Divine Ability kept Qi Lanyan’s mind clear. He remained silent, disbelieving. Only now did a sliver of doubt enter his mind.

'He was hit by the Crystalline Wu Earth calamity from the Crystalline Jade Branch... and he can still fight...'

Qi Lanyan’s headless body stood alone above the lake. Nourished and empowered, the raging Dui Metal Sword Intent spread from his waist through the rest of his body. But the tenacious life force granted by his Horn Wood divine ability and his profound Dao-Profundity were still fighting back, desperately trying to stabilize his body.

The injury was terrifying, but as long as a flicker of his Horn Wood power remained, a few moments were all he needed to pull himself back from the brink of collapse.

But the Huai River Map descended, and the golden halberd, blazing bright, tore through the air toward him.

In the sky, Wang Ziya, who had been fighting with ease, was now at a disadvantage because of his earlier intervention. He couldn't disengage, and the Blade-Shifting Stone in his hand was saturated with multicolored light, rendering it useless.

He could only sigh. Ignoring the Sword Intent before him once more, he turned his gourd. But in the next instant, the unassuming Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch appeared in the sky.

Lin Chensheng’s eyes were filled with hatred and bloody tears. He had forced his way out of his own fight long ago, ignoring his injuries to cross the battlefield. He had taken several hits and had blood in his mouth, his face pale as paper. But he formed a hand sign, and the Supreme Yang Radiance descended, blocking Wang Ziya’s path.

His eyes, full of bloody tears, stared across the sky at Wang Ziya, making the old man tremble. He didn't know how to respond; he had lost even the will to speak.

As for the other northern cultivators, some were tied down by their opponents, while others simply looked away. Most, however, just watched in silence.

Qi Lanyan had controlled Jianghuai for years, stirring up trouble. Had he only harmed one faction’s interests?

He had made far too many enemies. Even the roiling Exiled Qi was sealing off any chance of escape. He had made a single miscalculation and fallen into this predicament. Even though he only needed a few breaths for his Horn Wood power to save him and restore his fighting ability, not a single person on Lake Xian was willing to lift a finger.

'Do I have regrets? Impossible. Is this a failure? Not entirely.'

The headless body stood quietly, unconcerned, even as the Sword Intent at his waist climbed unstoppably up his torso. His aura was shattered by a Bright Yang Spiritual Treasure, and before the descending halberd, his body was as fragile as a shard of porcelain. Finally, it shattered.

The phenomenon of Horn Wood erupted toward the heavens.

His flesh sloughed off his body piece by piece, exploding into fine beads in the air that sprouted buds and became mulberry and catalpa saplings, scattering across the lake. His bones leaped out one after another—the smaller bones became dark swallows, the larger ones, wild geese, all crying mournfully as they fell and stirred the waves.

From his shattered body, an intense and undeniable verdant wind burst forth, nourishing all things with its endless life. It rose and fell, a wind in the sky and a branch on the earth. It scattered across the two shores, where mulberry and elm trees sprouted, and among them, the faint figures of common people could be seen, making their homes.

'A divine ability has fallen!'

Only then did a wisp of Wu Earth light appear.

The Crystalline Jade Branch!

The ancient treasure flared brightly, snatching the soul and True Spirit from the dim light. Its misty radiance swirled elegantly before it settled into a hand as pale as white jade.

A man had appeared from thin air. He wore a white robe, and his black hair cascaded down his back like a waterfall. His handsome face was gentle and serene in the gloom, brightening the desolate night.

The Grand Preceptor of the Zhao State.

'Wei Xuanyin.'
