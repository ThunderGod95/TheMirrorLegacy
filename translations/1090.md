# Chapter 1090: The Yin-Sanctum of the Great Fissure

The young man took a single step within the balanced energies of his pocket-realm. He turned, his gaze falling upon a box resting on the threshold of his courtyard. From it, he retrieved a letter and began to read it carefully.

As he finished, his expression tightened slightly, betraying a flicker of surprise. He flattened one hand, folded the letter with the other, and tapped it gently against his palm.

"Vast Cicada... the Precious Tusk Golden Land... the heritage of the Undefeated King of Brightness..."

Back then, he had been merely at the Embyronic Breathing stage, his power just beginning to manifest, when Kongheng had seen him. The first thing that monk had called him was the Undefeated King of Brightness. A monk like Kongheng, who held the great Dao in his heart, rarely spoke with such certainty.

This fact made the young man raise an eyebrow, his golden eyes flashing.

'Destiny? Or a plot? The Undefeated King of Brightness was backed by the Great Liang... and also the Touba family... Yet they've barely lifted a finger in the struggle between north and south...'

He set the letter aside, picked up the several that had arrived before it, and read them one by one before placing them in his storage bag. Finally, he retrieved a jade bottle.

'Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill. Three of them.'

Li Ximing had urgently requested these pills from Sima Yuanli, but he had underestimated Li Zhouwei's cultivation speed. By the time they were delivered, Li Zhouwei had already begun the process of elevating his divine ability.

In Li Zhouwei's estimation, the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' wasn't exceptionally difficult. The Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light suited him as if it were tailor-made—especially now that his Dao-Profundity had advanced. While this divine ability had its challenges and couldn't compare to the 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread', which had perfectly matched his breakthrough into the Perilous Tread realm, its completion was still a natural progression.

'And these Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pills... every one used is one gone forever. Granduncle will certainly need one for his next divine ability, and I will require one to break through to Purple Mystery. The last one will find its purpose soon enough.'

Having refined this divine ability, much of the overly tyrannical and fierce baleful qi that clung to his features dispersed, transforming into a majesty as calm and deep as a lake. He pinched his fingers to make a quick calculation, his bearing possessing an even greater grace.

'It took me six or seven years to elevate this divine ability... Jiangqian should be in seclusion by now. As for Que'Wan... the 'Whole Pill' secret method is difficult. She should still need more time.'

His gaze hardened slightly. He followed the jade steps up to the pavilion and, within the cloud-wreathed structure, found a specific cabinet and gently opened it.

Inside lay a small box, half-filled with a swirling, azure-white qi contained in five small bottles.

This was something Li Ximing had found when he first ascended to this pocket-realm. It was Spiritual Qi left behind by the original owner—very likely a remnant of Li Jiangqun from all those years ago!

After he emerged from seclusion this time, he absolutely had to pay a visit to the fox-kin!

'Granduncle took one bottle out back then, but after long deliberation, he couldn't find a single person he dared to ask about it. He ended up hurriedly sending it back. Now, after what happened with the Chunyi Dao Gate, he's even more afraid to speak... If I'm to get answers, the fox-kin are my only option.'

He took one of the bottles, strode forward, and stepped out of the pocket-realm. His figure materialized in the vast, faintly glowing great hall. He scanned his surroundings, finding that nothing had changed. Everything was as it had been.

He was in no hurry to leave the hall, however.

'I am already at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm. With my various Spiritual Treasures, cultivation methods, spell arts, and even the White Qilin fate... those enemies I once struggled to face are now nothing special. Even Helian Wujiang and Shilou Yingge combined are no longer necessarily my match!'

'The only ones who can truly suppress me now are figures like Wei Xuanyin or Sparrow Carp Fish...'

His reappearance would be enough to cause a massive shift in the current situation. Every day he remained hidden was another day of initiative gained. He could not afford to be exposed, and he was unwilling to let anyone on the lake even know he was out!

He simply took a jade pendant from his sleeve, sensed it for a moment, and then activated it.

Almost in the same instant, a streak of golden light shot through the air and materialized in the hall, revealing a figure whose white-gold Daoist robes shimmered. Who else could it be but Li Ximing?

Li Ximing had been refining pills in the mountains. The moment the jade pendant hidden in his sleeve, which he constantly monitored, lit up, his heart filled with a boundless, apprehensive joy. He pretended he needed to retrieve some medicinal supplies, took a single step into the inner formation, and saw the golden-eyed, white-robed young man standing in the dim hall. A wide smile split his face.

"Minghuang... you've succeeded?"

Li Zhouwei smiled. His eyes swept over Li Ximing, and he seemed to notice something. He took the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill from his storage bag and said with a grin:

"We saved a pill!"

"Excellent! Mid-Purple Mansion Realm!"

Li Ximing exclaimed in praise, then took a neatly folded, ink-black robe from his sleeve.

"The Primal Summit recovered on its own some time ago. I've been keeping it safe for you!"

The moment the armor saw Li Zhouwei, it leaped up like a young swallow returning to its nest. With a soft _shing_, it draped over his body, transforming into a robe. Its base color was as dark as ink, emblazoned with the golden, fang-baring visage of a qilin. The edges of the sleeves were trimmed in gold, granting him an air of supreme nobility.

Li Ximing voiced another word of praise, but he could no longer hold back his anticipation.

"Well?" he asked urgently. "How is it?"

Li Zhouwei, of course, knew what he was asking. He laughed, raised his sleeve, and gave it a light sweep.

In that instant, the world transformed. A thick, gritty wind slammed into their faces. The dim lamp stands, the flickering candles, and even the distant, gleaming profound tower—all of it faded, plunging them into utter darkness.

In a disorienting flash, they found themselves in a crimson desert scourged by rolling whirlwinds. The land was desolate and vast, filled with the hissing of sand. Countless broken weapons and sundered armor lay half-buried, exuding a thick, boundless, and gloomy baleful qi. It was a scene of complete devastation.

Li Ximing spun around. The great hall's doors were gone. Behind him stretched the same endless desert. In the pitch-black sky hung a lone, golden-yellow orb—a dying sun that loomed like a colossal beast.

Li Ximing sucked in a sharp, cold breath, his brow furrowed in profound shock. He turned back.

"This is the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead'!"

"Correct! The Great Fissure Broken-Blade Marvelous Art divine ability—'Crimson Severing Arrowhead'!"

Li Zhouwei smiled. Between his brows, the stark sign of a solar eclipse appeared, utterly black and devoid of light. He replied:

"Using the Emperor Qi's Light here provides twice the result for half the effort. All Yang Cusp 'inverse position' arts are not only enhanced, but their dharma power consumption is also drastically reduced!"

"Even better, this divine ability flickers in and out of existence, making it incredibly difficult to block with Spiritual Artifacts or Spiritual Treasures. When used against an enemy, it excels at catching them completely off guard!"

His tone carried the undercurrent of meticulous calculation, revealing that he had already formed numerous plans.

"The dying sun here, the broken armor, the blood-soaked desert, and even the Sun-Surging stars in the sky—all of it is mine to command. Not only that, but I can pair them with all kinds of profound, ancient spell arts to create even more wondrous effects!"

Li Ximing pondered this for a moment and murmured:

"It's... a sanctum for nurturing balefulness!"

"It's more than that!"

Li Zhouwei stood bathed in the light of the dying sun, looking down at the endless, cold baleful qi clinging to the desert floor. He raised his brows.

"The Imperial Codex states: 'An Emperor who slaughters his people destroys his own walls. An Emperor who herds dissenters raises his own executioners.'"

He continued:

"This desert holds an even greater marvel. Unless an opponent can shatter this divine ability in a single blow, any harm they sustain here—be it to person or possession—will be 'recorded.' While it has no immediate effect, when they leave this desert, that portion of harm can be left behind, severed from them."

"Conversely, any healing or recovery they attempt here will be 'stolen.' When they depart, that stolen portion of vitality can be obliterated within the desert."

Li Ximing's brows shot up, then knitted together.

"This is..." he said, stunned. "Could this be like the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal... to think such a divine ability exists! It's so domineering. Who could possibly resist it?"

"Not quite."

Li Zhouwei shook his head with a smile.

"This isn't a Dao of imprisonment; it can't truly trap anyone. Its strength lies in its wondrous, flickering nature. In combat, it drags an opponent down, as if hurling the setting sun at them. It's an art, not a domain. It relies on constant, unpredictable change, appearing different to every observer... Its true profundity is difficult to put into words."

"Granduncle, you hadn't entered Wanling Grotto-Heaven, but Zong Chang once possessed a Yin-Exhaustion art that was somewhat similar..."

"As for comparing divine abilities... within a Dao Lineage, each of the five Daos has its own function. It's pointless to compare them one-to-one. If you insist... the 'Valley Water' Dao has the 'Spring of Rebirth', also known as the Undying Spring. As a standalone divine ability, what can possibly compare to that? And that's not even considering the cycles of generation and restriction."

Li Zhouwei's expression grew more complex as he continued:

"A Dao Lineage always has its marvels. If it seems weak, it's the person who is weak. If it's strong, it's the person who is strong. Even a lineage as pathetic as the Capital Guard still managed to produce someone like Yehui."

Li Ximing crouched down, scooping up a handful of the fine sand. The surface layer was comfortably warm, but just beneath, it was heavy and dark, thoroughly soaked with blood, like silt. He sighed.

"It's truly real..."

He stared at it, his spiritual sense already flaring out, connecting with his Immortal Artifact.

In his Spirit Probe vision, everything before him, though manifested by a divine ability, was not an illusion. It was only far in the-distance, beyond the bounds of the "hall," that the scenery became unreal, dissolving into the expanding edge of the ability. He could vaguely sense that it was possible to pass through that edge and land back in the formation.

This realization made Li Ximing think of something.

"The Precious Tusk Temple?!"

His intuition screamed at him: one of the foundations of Vast Cicada's bizarre and inescapable Precious Tusk Temple was very likely this 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead'!

The suggestion, however, did not seem to surprise Li Zhouwei. He simply offered his own deduction.

"Granduncle's guess is sound. The two likely share a common origin. The difference is that the Precious Tusk Temple lost the ability to appear and disappear at will, while the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' lacks the Temple's function of drawing people in deeper... It's highly probable that Vast Cicada used some profound art to link it to the Precious Tusk Golden Land, using the Great Fissure Broken-Blade Marvelous Art divine ability as nothing more than a springboard!"

Li Ximing nodded with a sigh, finally understanding.

"I felt a sense of crisis that day. It must have been in response to this."

He let the blood-soaked sand fall from his grasp, dusted off his hands, and turned his gaze back to the domain, his brow furrowed.

"What I truly don't understand... is why this divine ability... feels as gloomy as a demonic art!"

Li Ximing was, after all, a Bright Yang cultivator. He was a Daoist Master who had achieved his own divine ability; in the current age, he was a great cultivator. He knew exactly what the aura of a Bright Yang divine ability should feel like.

He remained baffled.

"It feels nothing like Bright Yang!"

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"I knew you would ask this."

He lifted his head. His ink-black robe stirred, though there was no wind. The golden light around him intensified as the massive sun within the domain began to set. The western sky fell as the eastern rose, and finally, points of starlight emerged on the far-eastern horizon.

Li Zhouwei's dark hair whipped about in the gale. He raised a hand.

"Granduncle, look!"

Li Ximing fixed his gaze on the eastern horizon. Four stars twinkled there, arranged in an open-boxed '匚' shape, slanted northward, narrower at the opening and wider at the base. The pattern was incredibly familiar, and Li Ximing watched it with a thoughtful expression.

Li Zhouwei said,

"Those are the Sun-Surging Governing Stars!"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing instantly.

"The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!"

That artifact belonged to the Great Xiukui Monastery. It had been lent to him twice before, symbolizing Ning State's adherence to the Wei orthodox calendar... When he used the compass's power, those exact four stars would appear on its surface!

Li Zhouwei spoke again, his tone solemn.

"You have undoubtedly heard of High Radiance and Yang Cusp... but do you know their origin? High Radiance is the first of these four stars. Yang Cusp is the last. This is the principle behind the 'forward grasp' and 'reverse grasp'!"

"These four stars, in their rotation and transformation, each represent one of the five Bright Yang divine abilities!"

Li Ximing fell silent for a moment. "...That's one short," he said.

"Exactly!"

Li Zhouwei's eyes shone with brilliance.

"I once cultivated the Supreme Radiance Profound Dharma Body divine ability, which is now my 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread'. From that art, I learned a phrase: 'Through the descent of six-nines, one reaches the realm of regret. Only then comes the heart that shatters the arrowhead, the will that clarifies all.' And another: 'A Treasured Artifact with a fissure (wèn) attains completeness.'"

"I didn't understand the principle back then. But now that my Dao-Profundity has advanced and I have mastered the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' from the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light, I finally grasp the mystery! The one divine ability not counted among those stars... is the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead'!"

He explained:

"The five Bright Yang methods undergo the 'descent of six-nines.' This refers to the transformation of peak yang into yin, and extreme yin back into yang. First, it forces the Emperor to tread peril. When his task is complete, a single regret remains. That regret _is_ the 'heart that shatters the arrowhead'!"

"Thus, 'a Treasured Artifact with a fissure attains completeness.' A 'wèn'—a fissure—is when an object is broken but not yet separated. The 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' is precisely that fissure in the 'artifact' of Bright Yang. It is the yin-sanctum within Bright Yang itself!"

"Only with this yin-sanctum can an Emperor turn peak yang back to yin and find a path to rebirth. Only with this yin-sanctum can a Crown Prince defy imperial power and walk the path of the Yang Cusp. And only with this yin-sanctum can Bright Yang itself take a step back, preserving itself in the face of the true First Manifestation—the Supreme Yang. That is the meaning of 'Severing' (duàn) in its name!"

"In all the heavens, the only power that dares to encompass all five Daos, that _can_ encompass all five, is the Supreme Yang! The Dao of Bright Yang is defined by four brightnesses that form the stars, and this one, single yin!"

His eyes were as bright as gold, shining like a fifth star in the firmament. He spoke softly:

"This is one of the great secrets of the Bright Yang Dao. I doubt more than a handful of people even in ancient times ever knew it. It was only when I achieved this divine ability, when the Dao-Profundity my Talisman Qi had accumulated over many years fed back into me and I communed with the White Qilin fate, that I was able to sense it."

"And precisely because 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' is the yin-sanctum of the Bright Yang Dao, it isn't limited to Bright Yang cultivators. It can also be cultivated by those of the Lesser Yang, Baleful Qi, and even Hengzhu Daos as a supplement!"

Li Ximing was so profoundly shaken by this revelation that he was unable to speak for a long time. The gales within the domain intensified, roused by Li Zhouwei's words. Just as a new phenomenon was about to manifest, all color and sound suddenly retracted, and the entire scene scattered and vanished like a fleeting dream.

The crouching-beast sun, the endless blood-red desert—all of it dissipated. The dim, somber great hall reappeared around them. Li Ximing stood motionlessly in the hall, lost in thought for a long time.

Li Zhouwei watched him quietly.

He could, of course, see that Li Ximing had barely made any progress on his 'World's Radiance'. That Life Divine Ability was notoriously difficult to begin with, and Li Ximing seemed to have hit a wall, his progress stalling. The ratio of effort to reward had become terribly skewed. For the sake of the clan, his time was far more profitably spent refining pills.

But while Li Ximing thought of the clan, Li Zhouwei was thinking of him.

'If Granduncle can master 'World's Radiance' and wants to protect himself in these chaotic times, his next divine ability will surely be 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread'... He could rely on these three divine abilities to reach the mid-Purple Mansion Realm!'

''Imperial Observation of the Origin' is too difficult, and 'Eternal Brightness Steps' is too inferior. The true barrier blocking him from reaching Purple Mystery is likely the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead'.'

He watched Li Ximing's pensive, silent form, and his gaze filled with a flicker of hope.

'Granduncle...'

'The Old Master always said... Granduncle is a man of great fortune. If that's true... if he can survive after I am gone... then his only hope of ever passing Purple Mystery lies in the words I have spoken today...'
