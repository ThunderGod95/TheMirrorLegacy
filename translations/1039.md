# Chapter 1039: Each Harbors Ulterior Motives

The curses raining down from the zenith grew louder and more furious with each passing moment. Li Zhouwei saw the crisis reflected in Minghui’s blazing eyes. He swung his halberd back, bracing it against the golden artifact descending from Chiluo, and a sudden realization dawned in his mind.

‘Mingxiang and Minghui are both from the Lotus Temple. If this man can be trusted, the threat from him is lessened. That general from the Zhao State is the real trouble.’

He surged upward, his divine ability activating as a tremendous flood of dharma power poured into his Spiritual Artifact. The Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, which had been wavering behind him in a halo of fire, snapped back into position. With a series of grinding creaks, it intercepted the barrage of lights, its own azure-yellow radiance dimming for a moment.

The respite was fleeting. In that single instant, Li Zhouwei had already mounted the Heavenly Light and charged, his halberd aimed directly at Taixi’s smug, horse-like face.

Taixi was a man who cherished his life-mandate above all else. Aware of the danger, he had been on guard from the start. Even from a great distance, the sight of that gleaming, cold edge made his heart sink. He gritted his teeth and hastily recalled the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl. Forming a seal with his hands, his lips buzzed as he incanted a spell.

"Edict!”

A brilliant flash of color materialized in his hand—a shimmering golden radiance that let out a piercing shriek as it tore through the air, diving like a hawk.

Taixi had not been idle these past years. Though the Enlightened Artifact he had painstakingly planned to forge was lost in the catastrophe at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, setting him back decades, he had managed to salvage his efforts and refine this single ray of brilliant, golden light.

Unleashing it now, the ray multiplied in the air, transforming into a thousand dazzling streams of color that swarmed toward Li Zhouwei. They struck his Dharma Body with a cacophony of sharp impacts, erupting in showers of violet flames.

“Hah!”

But as Li Zhouwei’s Heavenly Light ascended, a furious fire ignited in Minghui’s eyes. His gaze shifted. The multicolored light that had been relentlessly pounding the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, nearly bringing the Spiritual Artifact to its breaking point, now redirected without hesitation toward Li Zhouwei himself.

From each of Minghui's shoulders, a new head emerged, each with exquisite features and wide, staring eyes. They chanted in unison. One conjured a disorienting, decadent rain, while the other unleashed a bewildering, layered glow. The multicolored light intensified, cascading down with overwhelming force to suppress the Heavenly Light.

Yet, as this pressure bore down, flooding the world with brilliant color, an even more potent radiance surged from below:

_Sovereign's Perilous Tread_!

When charging, _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ possessed the power to cut through chaos and restore order. Minghui’s three spell arts, each profound in its own right, inadvertently struck a point of mystical resonance. The golden patterns on Li Zhouwei's face blazed, and his eyes shone with sudden clarity.

Being besieged by multiple opponents was only helping his fate-sense, causing the power of _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ to escalate rapidly.

The golden glimmers that had been squirming across his Dharma Body were violently thrown off. In that same instant, the Grand Ascension Halberd’s edge screamed through the air and arrived directly before Taixi’s face.

The horse-faced Maha’s pupils reflected the roiling fury of the attack. His mind was a tempest, a landslide, a tsunami.

‘Ming… hui…’

He was loath to admit his own spell arts were ineffective, but Minghui’s attack had triggered _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_. The ability to restore order had undeniably elevated his opponent’s mystical power to a higher level. It looked like a mistake, but the malicious intent behind it was as clear as day.

The Lotus Temple was proficient in Daoist methods, far more familiar with the Immortal Dao than any of the Seven Phases. To claim Minghui was unaware of the Bright Yang’s profound qualities would be utter nonsense. But infighting was rampant among Buddhist cultivators, and there was nothing he could do about it—especially not with a halberd inches from his face. There was no time to think.

Taixi, after all, was not without skill. With a grim clenching of his jaw, he spat something out from his mouth.

The object was a pristine, jade-like white. It was a skull carved from jadeite, its eye sockets deep and empty. A storm of violet lightning crackled within its jaws as it shot forward, clamping down on the halberd’s cold edge with a deafening clang.

The Grand Ascension flared with brilliance. The _Attachment_ technique activated, and a phantom-like image of the bright halberd leaped through the air, striking Taixi’s horse-head like a bolt of lightning.

“Boom!”

Heavenly Light and violet flames exploded. The massive golden body stumbled back several steps, nearly falling. The halberd instantly pulled back, only to be caught again by roiling crimson flames that appeared from nowhere, hooking onto its crescent blade and halting its movement.

“Clang!”

Beside Li Zhouwei, the light suddenly intensified. An emerald vajra scepter, engraved with Sanskrit, had silently appeared at some point. Concealed amidst the dazzling Treasure Light, it dropped without a sound.

It was a strike from Mingxiang, the cultivator with the highest cultivation in the vicinity.

Mingxiang had, of course, seen the conflict between his disciple-brother and Taixi with perfect clarity. Though he didn’t know the reason for their animosity, his loyalty was to his own. He could have intervened to block the halberd, putting Li Zhouwei in an even more precarious position. Instead, Mingxiang had deliberately waited until after Taixi took the hit before making his move, and he had chosen a lethal, offensive strike.

But the very appearance of this emerald vajra scepter made Minghui’s expression change. ‘Not good,’ he thought.

Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes flashed; he too saw it clearly. The object seemed unremarkable, yet it brought a grave look to his face. He twisted his body to dodge, simultaneously using his halberd to block while once again activating the _Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light_ on his brow.

“Hummm!”

After years of cultivation, the power of _Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light_ was gradually approaching its theoretical limit. It bathed the world in a terrifying, brilliant light. Yet Mingxiang, seated cross-legged in the sky, simply raised his hands. With his left palm facing up near his chin and his right palm facing down over his waist, he canted his body slightly and chanted:

“Three receptions, three poisons, the cardinal bonds submit. You burn your own roots of virtue; the saints offer no salvation.”

In that moment, a light from the Buddhist Land shone down, like specks of sweet dew. The _Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light_ was met with a thousand points of resistance, its glow diminishing and scattering in five directions. Bathed in the Bright Yang’s radiance, the vajra scepter broke free. After only a slight pause, it continued its descent, trailing a kaleidoscopic afterimage as it crashed down with a deafening clang.

‘His Dao-Profundity is truly high. The Lotus Temple’s mastery of both Immortal and Buddhist arts is no empty boast! And this golden artifact is likely just as formidable!’

Witnessing this exchange, Li Zhouwei was secretly stunned. He raised his halberd high, left with no choice but to meet the vajra scepter head-on.

“Clang!”

A shower of sparks erupted from the Grand Ascension’s bright, curved blade. The shaft of the halberd bent dramatically, as if bearing the weight of a colossal mountain. Countless sutras materialized on the vajra scepter, projecting phantom images in all directions.

‘A seal!’

The vajra scepter was clearly designed to suppress dharma artifacts. Its power, long accumulated, was terrifying. But at the same time, the golden patterns on Li Zhouwei’s face flared, and the color of his eyes shifted from dark gold to pure, molten gold.

_Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ responded.

As the number of his attackers suddenly increased, the blessing of the White Qilin’s fate-sense surged, amplifying _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_. The power of his Dharma Body divine ability skyrocketed, reaching one hundred and fifty percent of its normal capacity. A brilliant Heavenly Light ignited all over his body.

Li Zhouwei’s charge had been crushed by the vajra scepter before it could even begin. But now, holding the Grand Ascension in just one hand, he raised his other with lightning speed. In a sweeping motion, he snatched the golden pearl that the Five-Eyed had sent flying toward him. The piercing radiance stopped dead, barely an inch from his face, before being violently crushed.

“Screee…”

The golden pearl, still possessing a spirit of its own, creaked and groaned in his palm, struggling desperately to escape. Li Zhouwei showed no triumph, his expression only growing colder.

“Boom!”

Meanwhile, dark clouds roiled in the sky. A bolt of purple lightning descended, narrowly striking down a hidden ray of light that Taixi had concealed, causing Minghui to sigh inaudibly with relief.

‘He came prepared, too…’

Li Zhouwei had yet to use his most crucial Spiritual Treasure or _Audience with the Celestial Gate_. He had clearly understood Minghui’s hint and was still preparing to deal with Gongsun Bei. The problem was, Li Ximing was nowhere to be seen, and the cultivators from the Song Court had not arrived. These other cultivators were not to be trifled with.

Just as expected, no sooner had Li Zhouwei dealt with Mingxiang on his left than Chiluo reappeared, sword in hand and radiating killing intent. He brought his blade down in a furious chop. The Mahas were all ruthless opponents. Even with his powerful Dharma Body, Li Zhouwei found himself pinned in the air by their combined spell arts and golden artifacts.

Chiluo’s crimson-gold sword slashed down. But the divine ability within Li Zhouwei was still boiling. His immense dharma power and extraordinary Dao-Profundity all surged toward a single point. _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ activated, and somehow, through the overlapping layers of multicolored light, he managed to recall the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, raising it just in time to block.

“Clank!”

What they heard was a sharp, clear ring of metal on metal, as if something golden had been struck. The air hummed, and for a moment, the vision of every Buddhist cultivator swam.

“Pfft!”

It was the sound of Chiluo coughing up blood.

The Five-Eyed’s scalp tingled.

‘The Pure Yang Bracelets have appeared!’ he thought in horror.

Chiluo, facing the attack head-on, had never imagined that Li Zhouwei, who had been locked down by their combined assault, would erupt with such explosive force after only a few exchanges. The power of his divine ability was absurd. A chill shot through him, and the world before his eyes shattered into a million confusing pieces. His head felt like it was about to split open.

Li Zhouwei had already let go of the golden pearl. The Grand Ascension halberd snapped straight, unleashing a blast of shattered Heavenly Light. His powerful hand was now empty. He allowed Mingxiang to suppress his Spiritual Artifact, ignored the pearl as it shone with boundless brilliance, and surged forward in an all-out offensive, his hand reaching for Chiluo’s neck.

In that split second, only the Five-Eyed’s golden pearl was close enough to potentially intervene.

But the Merciful One’s eyes lowered slightly. He did not move to propel the pearl. Nor did he dare do nothing at all. Instead, a greedy light flared in his eyes. With a flick of his thumb against his knuckle, his body dissolved into light and reformed beside the golden pearl, using their connection to teleport. He clapped his palms together and aimed straight for the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, which was now isolated and powerless in the air, seeking to seize it amidst the chaos.

But the light on Li Zhouwei’s brow had already turned to darkness. For one brilliant instant, countless streams of black-gold light erupted, drowning out all other colors in the vicinity.

_Emperor Qi's Light_!

“Aaargh!”

The first to scream was, naturally, Chiluo. Struck by the Pure Yang Bracelets, his senses were in disarray, the world spinning around him. Nearby, Minghui was quietly slacking off, having released his pressure on the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella. The Five-Eyed, blinded by greed, was right behind him, trying to snatch the umbrella. Not a single person came to Chiluo’s aid.

A powerful hand clamped down on Chiluo’s neck. The black-gold light swept down from his face, and in an instant, his crimson head was mottled with countless cracks. As the hand tightened its grip, the sound of shattering glass filled the air.

“Crack!”

Chiluo’s glass-like eye was the first to go, embedded and crushed by Li Zhouwei's thumb. The hand gripping his face seemed to expand rapidly, its knuckles growing thick, its claws sharp. Countless sinister scales sprouted from the skin, tripling its power in an instant.

“BOOM!”

The Spiritual Treasure had already shredded his spirit, and now Emperor Qi's Light poured into him. _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ was operating at one hundred and fifty percent of its power. Even though Chiluo was a subordinate of the Golden Lotus Seat, his Dharma Body tempered for centuries, his head was now as fragile as any common glasswork. It exploded with a deafening bang.

“Sshhh…”

A shower of sand and glass-like fragments rained down from the sky. A Buddhist cultivator’s Dharma Body had no weak points. Chiluo’s headless body burned with a bright flame, but his entire being, down to his very bones, was riddled with the Yang Cusp power left by _Emperor Qi's Light_. His hands were still pushing against Li Zhouwei’s arm. The Merciful One was filled with a towering rage and horror, but he could only feel his Dharma Body breaking apart.

The Five-Eyed was scared out of his wits. But having already put on a show of greed, he didn't dare drop what he was holding. He could only suppress the umbrella and retreat as fast as he could, his mind reeling in terror.

‘Heavens! That’s horrifying!’

He fled for his life, his mind utterly shaken by King Wei’s decisive brutality, muttering incoherently.

‘The Buddhist Lord be… bah… the Immortal Lord be praised… we’re on the same side… same side!’

Li Zhouwei, however, had no time to spare for him. The moment he crushed Chiluo’s Dharma Body, he spun around without a shred of hesitation. Chiluo was riddled with Emperor Qi's Light, his Dharma Body ruined, but it had not come without a cost. Li Zhouwei had let go of the Grand Ascension, and the weapon was now suppressed by the emerald vajra scepter. The halberd’s tail quivered, tugged by his divine ability, constantly trying to break free, but the radiant pressure only tightened. He had no time to breathe. A single moment of relaxation would mean forfeiting the advantage he had fought so hard to win.

He activated _Sovereign's Perilous Tread_ again, deflecting Taixi’s spell arts one by one, and finally managed to grab the tail of the halberd. But Mingxiang was the strongest Maha present. His reaction was just as fast. He hadn’t spared so much as a glance for the fallen Chiluo; his sights were clearly set on the Grand Ascension. He would never give Li Zhouwei the chance to reclaim it. The emerald light rapidly converged, and in the end, Li Zhouwei was a fraction of a second too slow. A jade-green glow stained the halberd, rendering it almost completely immobile.

Watching this unfold, Minghui wanted to cry his heart out. Tears of despair streamed down his face.

‘Disciple-brother… oh, disciple-brother! Do you not understand the concept of holding back? You’re going to get Master and me killed!’

But he couldn’t blame Mingxiang. The master and disciple duo hadn’t dared tell him the truth about what happened on the lake. They had concocted a story about wearing down the other Buddhist cultivators with the goal of making a profit. Naturally, Mingxiang was now focused on making a huge profit. How could he possibly let the Grand Ascension go?

A flicker of regret crossed Li Zhouwei’s eyes, but he wasn’t entirely surprised. Bracing himself against the spell arts of the Five-Eyed and Minghui, he put all his strength into one arm, his golden eyes blazing as he stared intently at the emerald vajra scepter.

“Pfft!”

No matter how much the two of them held back, a direct hit was still a direct hit. A flush of red rose to Li Zhouwei’s face as the dharma power inside him precariously completed its circulation. The golden phantom appeared once more, slamming viciously into the scepter.

“Clang!”

As powerful as the emerald vajra scepter was, it was no match for the Pure Yang Bracelets. It let out a mournful cry, as if it had been slapped hard, and flew high into the air. The emerald light pinning the halberd, deprived of its source, quickly faded. But just then, a figure materialized from the air, holding a purple bowl. He had been waiting for this moment. He swooped down and trapped the Spiritual Treasure just as its momentum died.

It was Taixi.

This man had converted from an Immortal to a Buddhist cultivator. He was utterly cunning and understood Immortal cultivators better than most. He had timed this moment perfectly. Pouring all his dharma power into the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl in his hands, his spiritual sense frantically broadcast into the Great Void.

‘General Gongsun, now is the perfect time!’

Seeing this scene, Minghui’s heart sank. A terrible premonition struck him with the force of a physical blow.

‘Li Ximing still hasn’t made a move?… Could it be… he’s not here?’
