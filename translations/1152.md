# Chapter 1152: Upon the Lake

Light and shadow danced upon the water. Sima Yuanli arrived on the wind, drawing ever closer to the shimmering surface of the lake, clutching a gourd in one hand while untying a scroll from his waist with the other. A heavy sorrow filled his heart.

Sima Yuanli knew exactly why Yang Ruiyi had sent him.

'The Purple Smoke sect is a major power, dear to the True Martial lineage. With a Great Daoist Master hidden away, attempting a breakthrough, the lives of people like Tinglan and Wenqing are far too precious to risk.'

The situation was a landslide, an avalanche thundering toward an irreversible conclusion. In a bloody battle of this magnitude, cultivators like them—practitioners of Martial Cultivation or the Profound Arts, and even people like Lingu Lanying and Cheng Qian—were not meant for the front lines.

Beyond delivering the Huai River Map, he, Sima Yuanli, had at least one other inheritance to offer. Daoist Master Yuanxiu had been the grandmaster of talisman arts in the Yue State. To this day, he had barely used any of his talismans—a fact the Yang family had not failed to notice.

'How difficult…'

Bitterness filled his heart as he hurried onward. The Celestial Gate was now close. Beneath it, a man in ink-black robes sat cross-legged amidst the brilliant heavenly light. His long halberd stood planted in the churning water, utterly motionless.

Sima Yuanli came to a stop before him and lowered his gaze.

"King Wei!"

A severe glint on the water's surface wavered for a moment. The man in green robes produced a jet-black stone box from his sleeve. With his gaze lowered, he said:,

"I encountered a fellow Daoist, Lin, on my way here. He implored me to deliver this to you, King Wei."

Li Zhouwei inclined his head. Sima Yuanli opened the stone box, revealing a circular plate within. He held it up. Its surface was a sheet of gold, etched with runes in the eight cardinal directions encircling a dense ring of pale white incantations. At its very center, a brilliant golden light pulsed.

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!

This was one of the foundational artifacts of the Ning State, an heirloom of the Su Clan of Jiangbei. Though it was forged in a more recent era, its miraculous power was undeniable.

Years ago, Li Ximing had merely borrowed this compass and, with only the body of a divine ability practitioner, had injured Helian Wujiang, a master at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm. Now, in the presence of the White Qilin, the compass blazed with heat. It suddenly felt as heavy as a mountain, causing Sima Yuanli's hands to dip.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flickered. A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed the item was ownerless.

"After this battle, I will go and thank him personally."

Even an ownerless Spiritual Artifact normally required time to refine, but he merely took it with one hand and the compass instantly accepted him as its master. It sank into the space between his brows, transforming into a faint, golden sigil of the Sun-Surging Governing Stars that flowed with a dim, white light.

He narrowed his eyes slightly, a smile touching his lips as he felt the myriad wonders flood his mind.

'An excellent treasure!'

Sima Yuanli did not stop there. He immediately produced a porcelain bottle from his sleeve. Holding it in his palm, he hesitated for a long moment before speaking softly.

"Daoist Master Zhaojing was extremely concerned about you standing guard here, King Wei. He spent the last two days seeking treasures from various houses and finally came to me."

"When the Donghuo fell back then, it was handled by Senior Ning and Daoist Master Zhang. But the Emperor's body descended upon Yufu Prefecture, and my lord had a fortuitous encounter, obtaining a Treasure Pill of the Second Manifestation's Vast Yang. Today, I offer it to you, King Wei."

Li Zhouwei glanced down, his eyes already assessing the contents of the bottle.

"White Dew Blood?"

"The very same!"

Though Li Zhouwei was no alchemist, he could discern the spiritual materials used. Li Ximing had long ago prepared the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill and other medicines for him, but they were still a step below a treasure pill refined from such a potent spiritual substance.

"When I have the chance, I will repay Daoist Master Qinghu."

With Li Zhouwei's acceptance, Sima Yuanli finally took a step back. He presented the Huai River Map with both hands and declared in a solemn voice:

"King Wei, please take this map!"

At his words, the golden-eyed young man turned to look at him and smiled.

"Daoist Master, this is your only protective treasure. Giving it to me is one thing, but this battle is unlike any other. Are you prepared?"

Sima Yuanli answered respectfully, "The Emperor personally summoned me to the palace and bestowed upon me the Profound Water Stone of the Far Ridges!"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"And what are the Grand General's arrangements?"

Sima Yuanli replied, "The Grand General did not inform me. However, I heard he is personally attacking Shanji, and that Situ Huo and the others are already by the lake to provide support… As for that one…"

He trailed off, raising his head to look at the mountain peak towering in the east. He focused on a point where thunder rolled and autumn dew fell in sheets.

"It should be done."

The instant his words fell, myriad streaks of rose-colored light erupted into the sky, like a million dawns breaking at once. They pierced the clouds, and as the auspicious mists shifted, they revealed what lay beneath: ten million eyes!

The rosy light reflected in Li Zhouwei's eyes. A cold sneer formed on his lips as he abruptly took the scroll.

The instant the Spiritual Treasure left Sima Yuanli's hands, he felt a sudden emptiness and was stunned to find his connection to it had been completely severed!

A jolt went through him.

'He had already made allowances for me!'

"BOOM!"

The clouds in the sky converged with incredible speed as an immense golden body descended, its arrival heralded by a great tremor of Sanskrit chants.

"We exchanged blows too hastily a few months ago, and it was hardly satisfying. King Wei, please grant me your guidance!"

"DONG!"

Zhelu's thousand eyes moved as one. Darkness crawled up the sky, where a colossal setting sun hung at the edge of the world. A long halberd, like a golden comet, streaked across the heavens, trailing a long wake of white light as it descended to kill!

Zhelu's words were fearless, but at the sight of the halberd, his expression turned grave. He formed a seal with his hands, his thousand eyes wide, as the enormous golden mountain manifested once more.

But a sound rose from all the waters between heaven and earth. A sheet of azure light swept in, wrapping heavily around the golden mountain. Sima Yuanli's green gourd shone with a profound light as he went all-out, his expression grim!

Li Zhouwei, however, merely narrowed his eyes.

A ripple of gray was already spreading across his halberd. The familiar power of Valley Water gathered and swirled, blending all colors into a dim, heavy light.

'Sunless Deceit!'

Murong Yan!

The Zhelu in the sky was a preeminent figure among the northern Maha. In an ordinary fight, he alone could have contended with Li Zhouwei. That this was merely a probe, yet they still added Murong Yan to the assault, showed just how vicious Qi Lanyan's intentions were.

This divine ability of Valley Water warped the surrounding world, surging forth from within the dim domain of the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead.' The River-Wall Staff leaped from the Great Void, falling abruptly. The face on Murong Yan's grotesque skin-bag was twisted with savagery!

"CLANG!"

The two weapons collided. Valley Water clashed with Bright Yang, and the sheer force of the impact sent the River-Wall Staff flying high. Murong Yan's expression shifted.

This was not his first battle with Li Zhouwei… in fact, the very first clash in the war between North and South had been between them. But back then, he had held the advantage of strength. Things were different now!

Feeling the strain in his hands, he steeled himself and opened his mouth wide, just as he had done all those years ago. A pitch-black shadow, coiling like a serpent, pulsed within his maw as his mouth swelled grotesquely, rolling with demonic light.

But the golden eyes that watched him no longer held their former gravity. They were filled with cold mockery.

A sign of a solar eclipse flared to life between Li Zhouwei's brows. The profound, bottomless darkness did not obscure the sigil there; instead, it overlaid the white pattern of the Sun-Surging Governing Stars, causing it to erupt with an intense, new color.

The first to react was the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!

This compass had been forged during the fall of Wei and the rise of Ning. It followed the old Wei traditions while heralding the new era of Ning. Its power was rooted in the Sun-Surging Governing Stars, making it perfectly attuned to the fluctuations between positive and negative Bright Yang. Its primary aspect was 'Sun-Surging'—an incredibly profound art for enhancing the power of the Yang Cusp!

When Li Ximing had borrowed it, he could only activate one or two of its abilities, unable to enjoy the true blessings it conferred upon its master. But in Li Zhouwei's hands, the compass was like a tiger that had grown wings.

Emperor Qi's Light!

The distant setting sun suddenly began to rise again. An impossibly dense stream of black-gold light erupted from it at an unprecedented speed, coalescing into a torrential pillar of light that pierced the heavens as it descended!

Murong Yan had never anticipated such a turn of events. His pupils dilated as the black-gold radiance poured into his technique, causing his skin-bag to inflate at a visible rate.

The sun shone high overhead, and Murong Yan was paralyzed. But the King Wei of today was not the same Li Zhouwei who had once faced him with the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light technique. The lingering sun itself now commanded the Emperor Qi's Light, and his halberd, already a blur of motion, stabbed forward!

"CLANG!"

The Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions, rushing to the rescue, was frozen in place by a brilliant light. The golden halberd danced like a dragon, smashing through layer after layer of gray Valley Water before slamming into Murong Yan's body!

Streaks of black-gold patterns appeared on his swollen, ball-like torso. His Valley Water art, cultivated for nearly a century, was instantly overwhelmed. In just a few breaths, it detonated!

It was as if another sun had risen in the dark, sand-swept world. Murong Yan's first layer of skin shattered. The powerful new arms that had grown forth were bathed in heavenly light, and rivulets of gray blood streamed down his skin.

A direct scion of the Murong family, a cultivator at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, renowned for his 'Valley Water' technique's defensive and evasive properties, had his art shattered and was wounded in a single exchange!

He staggered back, but Li Zhouwei did not pursue. Instead, he spun his halberd back, hooking a golden spear that had shot out of the Great Void!

Sima Yuanli was nowhere near strong enough to block Zhelu; even his hasty defense was strained. The thousand-eyed Maha had already descended from the sky, pressing down on him.

The golden spear, struck by the halberd, flew high into the air. Zhelu had already conjured a vast rose-colored light to bear down on him. But the light washed over Li Zhouwei's face as if it were nothing. The glittering halberd blade tore through the radiance, its power magnified, and stabbed onward!

'As expected…'

Qi Lanyan had used this Liangli Maha's greed for treasures to drive him forward, but the cunning old master had not lost his head. On the contrary, he was on high alert.

'Is Qi Lanyan really so kindhearted? He sent Murong Yan and me here because he values our talent for escaping… What trump card is the South holding? Could this be fatal?'

His Buddhist arts specialized in void illusions, and his thousand eyes were designed for such techniques. Against Li Zhouwei, he was at an absolute disadvantage.

A single charge of 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' was enough to shatter his arts; its disruptive power was among the best of all divine abilities and had already nullified nearly half his Dao-Profundity. And now it was clear that the White Qilin's innate resistance to illusion arts was also terrifyingly high!

He had no choice but to clasp his hands together, locking the halberd in place. He endured the sharp pain and the sound of splintering bone that came from his palms as he broke his opponent's momentum. His golden lips moved.

"By my decree!"

A stream of golden powder flowed forth, suffused with the light of Dawn Qi. It whistled through the air and sprinkled across Li Zhouwei's face. The White Qilin's expression finally shifted, a flicker of pain crossing his features.

Zhelu's heart soared!

'His dharma body has its limits! My illusions are useless, but the Dawn Qi I spent so long preparing will be effective!'

But just as joy surged through him, he felt the light above dim. A brown pouch etched with profound patterns appeared in midair.

The pouch pulsed gently, and a powerful wind blew out. The wind was as gentle as a spring sunbeam, yet it drove away all traces of haze, instantly dispersing the Dawn Qi that lingered in the air. Zhelu's expression changed instantly.

"The Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch!"

"The Great Xiukui Monastery!"

The wind was like an illusion. Before it could dissipate, a cascade of brilliant light fell from the sky. It was a golden-white so dazzling and dense it seemed to solidify.

Supreme Yang Radiance!

The beam of light cut across the world, forcing the water on the lake to part like a gleaming golden sword. It fell at an impossible speed, slamming into Zhelu.

"Tssss…"

The light was like a virulent poison, searing through his blinking dharma eyes, burning through golden skin and jade-like flesh. Zhelu shrieked and scrambled back, his very soul on the verge of scattering!

It was the first time the Maha Liangli of the Way of Emptiness had ever lost his composure so completely!

The fame of this Supreme Yang light seemed to shake the very heavens, sending tremors through the Great Void. Layer upon layer of illusory colors intertwined as countless greedy eyes fell upon the brown, patterned pouch.

'The Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch…'

At the same time, Murong Yan looked up. A bell with profound patterns was swaying gently. A man in robes embroidered with shamanistic runes stepped out of the void. Black mist rose from his hands and lunged toward Murong Yan.

The newly ascended Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery, Lin Chensheng!

His appearance was a signal of profound importance. The Great Void fluctuated violently. Baleful winds surged up from the earth, and mountains of Baleful Qi rose and fell like waves, as if a grim ink wash painting had been unfurled over the landscape.

To the left stood a refined, middle-aged man holding a spell-sword, his gaze clear. To the right was a youth in heavy armor, his expression fierce, a shuo saber in one hand. A faint scar on his face stood out starkly under the heavenly light.

The two stood in the sky like twin, inexhaustible fonts of Baleful Qi, causing the very air to freeze and snow to begin falling.

The uncle and nephew, Helian Wujiang and Helian Wumeng!

As the sky-blotting Baleful Qi poured down, Helian Wujiang remained expressionless, his hand slowly tightening on his sword. He looked into the distance, where a man now stood among the mountains of Baleful Qi.

The man was eight-chi tall and wore golden boots, a gold-and-crimson saber slung across his back, his gaze sinister. He stood upon clouds as white as cotton, yet they moved with the nimble grace of serpents. His eyes were like a demon's, glowing with red light.

Helian Wujiang touched his throat. The scar, thin as a bloodline, had healed, but a chill remained lodged deep in his heart.

'Situ Huo…'

And in the clouds farther still, purple light and frigid qi were racing toward them, seemingly mingled with a faint golden aura. The Great Void to the north trembled without cease. An Imperial scion stood with halberd drawn while a Maha manifested its true form.

The light of divine abilities and the glow of Buddhist Lands wove together, merging into a patch of absolute darkness in the sky. The small lake had likely never borne the weight of so many Daoist Masters and Mahas. Pulled by their immense power, the earth veins and fire veins below began to shift, growing abnormally active as they pushed toward the surface.

A chill filled the heart of the ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom. His years on the northern frontier had given him vast experience. His gaze was now heavy, the refined air around him long gone, replaced by pure killing intent.

'I fear no one on Lake Xian will hold back today. Killing and surviving will depend on skill alone… and for every great power that falls, how many lesser families will rise on their remains?'
