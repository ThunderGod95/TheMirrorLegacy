# Chapter 941: Murong

The Great River surged. On the north bank, brilliant radiance shone where rows of monks stood in silence. Within the clouds, golden bodies flickered, their forms and features varied. They appeared and vanished in the sky, staggered according to their cultivation and rank.

At the very zenith, a mass of crimson True Fire gushed endlessly, converging into a long arch bridge. Spiritual fire ascended, climbing the sides of the arch, and coalesced at its apex into a pavilion. This structure, set upon the bridge's tower, had six corners and was wreathed in roiling, crimson flames.

A long-faced man in golden robes sat within the pavilion, leaning against a low table. His hands were clasped, his right loosely holding a pair of jade chopsticks, which he used to poke and turn over the four small dishes on the table.

Kneeling on both sides of the arch bridge were armored soldiers. They were not living beings, but figures sustained purely by blazing fire—like spectral suits of fiery armor suspended in mid-air. Their golden, burning eyes, hidden beneath the helms, gave off a sinister air.

After a short wait, a figure approached from the mountains. He was a mountain of a man, built like a barrel, with a wild, tangled beard covering a face whose cheeks were a dark, purplish-black. He strode in without ceremony and plopped down directly opposite the long-faced man.

He flicked his thick, sausage-like fingers, materializing a pair of silver chopsticks, and immediately began snatching food from the dishes. The long-faced man’s expression soured. He slapped his own chopsticks down with a clack and cursed.

"Such barbarian habits!"

"What?"

The thick-waisted brute shot him a glare.

"Are you not a barbarian? Or am I not a barbarian?"

This retort shut the thin-faced man up. He let out a sharp "Heh," and replied:

"We are masters of the Central Plains now. The Murong family has no shortage of handsome men, so how did it produce an uncouth lout like you, Murong Yan! What a waste of a name. Coming down south here, you're just giving people ammunition to talk... bringing up the Northern Barbarian past."

The burly man sneered.

"Jiangnan is half the mainland. It wasn't necessarily worse than the north back in the day. You Central Plains folk are so quick to call them 'Southern Barbarians,' but did anyone make a peep when True Monarch Shangyuan 'toured the north,' or when Duanmu Kui was acting the tyrant? Even Jiang Boqing dared to toy with a King-Marquis. You talk about decorum?"

Shangyuan was now a True Monarch, so even when arguing, they had to refer to his past actions delicately as a "northern tour." They were far less polite about Duanmu Kui. But bickering was just their way; they were clearly old friends. Murong Yan snagged two more bites of food and said:

"White Qilin is just across the river. Daoist Friend Yingge, if you're too concerned with 'face,' or if you're scared, just let me go test him again."

"It's not that I'm afraid of him."

Shilou Yingge's eyes narrowed slightly. He refused to be baited by the taunt, his tone level.

"Bright Yang is a dao that favors the strong and venerates power—the strong get stronger, the weak get weaker. Even if he hasn't mastered all five Dharmas, if he's even touched upon the Purple Mystery and gained a hint of true mastery, forget me. Even Qi Lanyan would have to be cautious."

"But as he is now... he just broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, his life-mandate is incomplete. In the end, he's just an initial-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with a few tricks. You alone would be more than enough to overwhelm him, let alone the two of us."

Murong Yan roared with laughter, his fleshy cheeks bunching up.

"Your calculations are sound. When I first heard about him, I was dismissive. So what if he's 'blessed by fate'? The Bright Yang dao is in tatters; how much of a blessing could he really have? It's not like having 'fate' on your side means you don't need to train in secret arts or cultivation methods. The Wei Emperor didn't conquer the world relying on fate. Back in the day, few of the Wei crown princes could truly suppress their peers, to say nothing of now."

"It was only when I heard that the prodigy from the Tiefu Kingdom, Helian Wumeng, had fought him recently. Apparently, even when White Qilin was unarmed and without a Spiritual Artifact, Helian Wumeng couldn't easily defeat him. That's when I started to take him seriously."

He, Murong Yan, was also a prodigy of the Murong family. The north was vast, far more populous than the south, a gathering place for royal clans, imperial descendants, and immortal heirs. They intermarried, spreading powerful bloodlines far and wide. To fight his way out of such a crowd and achieve the Purple Mansion Realm made him a first-class figure in his own right.

More importantly, the northern Daoist traditions held the rich legacies left behind by the many fallen celestial dynasties, immortal sects, and immortal gates of old. Whether in spiritual objects or bloodlines, how could they be compared to the disciples the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had scraped together after fleeing south to develop the barbarian lands? If not for the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's origins from Green Pine Temple, which allowed them to acquire a few Dharma Treasures and Spiritual Treasures through ancestral connections, and if the north wasn't so internally divided, this whole conflict wouldn't have dragged on for so many years.

In all the years of conflict between north and south, it had, frankly, only ever been a few Buddhist cultivators acting on their own, heading south when they saw an opportunity. There had rarely been a full-scale Purple Mansion Realm war. They mostly used local rogue cultivators for manpower, yet that alone had been enough to force almost all the Daoist traditions in the Yue State to unite. The disparity in strength was already immense...

'Aside from the Jade True Monarch, Duanmu Kui, and those other inhuman exceptions... the Three Yuans, Two Purples were passable. But as for today... the south has no one worth a second glance!'

Shilou Yingge stopped toying with his chopsticks and poured himself a drink.

"Helian Wumeng is a prodigy, but he is similarly unfledged. The day he steps over the immortal threshold, dons the Ying-Copper Armor of Great Xia, wields the Bulwark of Ten Thousand Cities, and swallows the Iron Edict Elixir refined by Helian Fan, I fear only the young master of the Touba family could compare. At that point, you and I... we will both be his inferiors."

This made Murong Yan's eyes go wide, but the reputation of those Spiritual Treasures was too great. With that said, he couldn't find a retort. He could only narrow his eyes, his fierce look fading as he said coldly:

"His ancestors were magnificent, but his line is now in decline. He just doesn't have any other prodigies of his generation to compete with for spiritual items. If all the treasures of my Murong family were given to one person, who could possibly stand against them?"

"That's a meaningless comparison!"

Shilou Yingge shook his head.

"If you're going to argue like that, why not complain that you were born into the Murong family instead of the hovel of a commoner or a tenant farmer? Besides, your Murong family's current glory is entirely thanks to the grace of Emperor Xuan. You can't compare your situation to his at all!"

His Murong family was one of the greatest beneficiaries among the Northern Barbarian. They had lost to the Fuqi family in the war for the Celestial Dynasty and were in a precarious position, completely lost during the Turmoil of the Three Teachings. Fortunately, the Mandate of Heaven was revived, and Emperor Xuan of Yan, Murong Jie, emerged.

This emperor took command in a time of crisis. He first used military force to suppress the Three Teachings, then issued an edict:

"The Buddhists, who follow the gradual path of cultivation and realization, walk a Great Dao. The Demonic preserve their nature and practice their arts... The Immortal, who cultivate the methods of divine ability to return to the origin, also shall not lose their venerable status."

This edict, known as the Imperial Edict of Central Xuan, redefined the Immortal and Demonic paths not as Daoist traditions, but as advanced spell arts. Only Buddhist cultivators were practicing the "true path of cultivation," and they turned to worship the Way of Compassion.

From then on, the order of the Daoist traditions in the Yan Kingdom was clear. Those with high talent cultivated the Immortal or Demonic paths. When their lifespan was exhausted, if they possessed sufficient divine ability, they could convert to the Way of Compassion. Although this didn't guarantee success every time, the gains were significant, and the accumulated experience grew ever richer.

Once the Buddhist Dao became a viable path for Purple Mansion Realm and Diverse Mansion cultivators, the internal conflicts rapidly eased. After all, no matter how demanding it was, no one minded having one last escape route when all else failed. The Way of Compassion also adopted the doctrine of "a stomach big enough to tolerate all," fostering mutual benefit. From that point, it grew uncontrollably. The Buddhist Land expanded at an astonishing rate, and its path developed unique wonders, distinct from other Buddhist cultivators, seemingly vying for supremacy among the Seven Aspects.

Although this over-expansion led to fierce competition within the Buddhist Land—making it less stable than the other six Aspects, whose positions rarely changed in a century—the Murong family had turned disaster into fortune. They had climbed step by step to the peak and now had deep foundations in all three paths: Demonic, Buddhist, and Immortal. The Demonic and Buddhist paths, in particular, complemented each other perfectly. Murong Yan naturally had the right to be arrogant.

He changed the subject.

"Helian Wumeng was deep in enemy territory; he definitely wouldn't use his full strength. His Tiefu Kingdom ranks last among the King-Marquis clans; he doesn't dare act rashly. As I said, he's unfledged. A draw is normal."

"You, however, have no such worries. It's the perfect time for you to fight him! Your divine abilities are more numerous than his, and you have more Spiritual Artifacts. I hear he doesn't even have a decent weapon. Just be careful... the situation is unclear. We are here to probe. Don't develop any killing intent, and don't pursue too deeply."

He continued in a low, haunting tone:

"Helian Wumeng has already reached Xuanmiao Temple. From there, he is probing that... Zhu Gong. Let's not even mention her injuries; even at full strength, she can't gain any advantage against Helian Wumeng. Yi Shu... Tinglan will definitely go."

At the mention of Daoist Master Tinglan, his gaze grew complicated. After all, she was also from Qi, and they had known each other in their youth. But his expression quickly smoothed over as he replied:

"Even so, I will remain here to support you and prevent the remnants of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition from trying any tricks."

Murong Yan's expression was unchanged. He nodded.

"The armies of the other Dao paths have not yet arrived. We are just testing the waters."

He dissolved into demonic smoke and vanished, leaving Shilou Yingge sitting alone in the pavilion, his expression gradually becoming placid.

'Luoxia is acting completely hands-off. Their attitude is truly ambiguous... Murong Yan claims the Wu Light Daoist tradition simply doesn't want to be drawn in, but... it looks more like disdain.'

'And the north... our interests are a tangled, chaotic mess. Even when a consensus is reached, there's always room to maneuver. The various powers have different attitudes toward Li Qianyuan. Some are aggressive, some conciliatory, one party is even vaguely sympathetic... But delaying the Wei Emperor's fall is something everyone secretly agrees on... If the Wu Light Daoist tradition refuses to get involved, the other families won't stop at just extracting benefits...'

He raised his cup, showing no particular animosity toward the Li family across the river, nor any of the rumored insistence on restoring his Shi-Lou clan. All his actions seemed to be mere political posturing. Only a deep, cold indifference remained in his eyes.

'The Great King doesn't care... but I must. The Gao family's future is in our hands. Even the Cui family is playing it safe now. If we stubbornly cling to this so-called 'ancestral debt of gratitude,' it will surely push my Gao family into the abyss...'

'My family already lost once during the chaos at the end of the Liang... All we have left is a veneer of respectability. If we lose again... the Gao clan will cease to exist!'

...

The Great River.

Sinister demonic qi surged into the air, transforming into gusts of frigid wind. The barrel-chested brute materialized. He paused for just a moment as the demonic qi shifted, becoming plates of gleaming, bright armor that affixed themselves to his body.

But his expression held none of the excitement of an impending battle. The eyes nestled in his fleshy face showed none of their earlier impudence or recklessness. They were as calm as water, filled with meticulous calculation.

'Such a rare, perfect opportunity...'

He stood suspended above the river, billowing demonic qi mixing with a colorless, hazy radiance that swirled around him. It shot into the sky, rapidly staining the northern horizon a pale, ashen gray.

A heaven-shaking roar rose from below, but Murong Yan's gaze was fixed dead ahead.

In almost the same instant, a man clad in golden scale armor, with the Radiant Sun King's Halberd hanging at his waist, appeared on a high cliff overlooking the river. He stared across the distance, his pair of golden pupils stabbing forward like daggers, drawing a distinct smile from Murong Yan.

The demonic smoke on the riverbank billowed higher. Without a word, he slowly raised his hand and drew a long weapon from the Great Void.

The object resembled a sword, but its hilt, shaped like an iron dragon's open mouth, was attached to a solid, rounded iron shaft. The shaft was segmented, like bones joined together, and at four feet, it was a good deal longer than a typical sword.

He waited only a moment before his figure vanished. The rolling demonic smoke on the riverbank swelled in response, surging forward like a tide as his thunderous voice exploded in mid-air:

"Murong Yan of the Yan Kingdom has come to seek instruction!"

Simultaneously, an invisible, misty water gathered rapidly, casting a vast, shimmering curtain of light across the sky that flickered in and out of view.

Divine Ability: Sunless Deceit!

Murong Yan was no benevolent fool. Even though he estimated his opponent was no match for him, and that he himself possessed an extra divine ability, he had no intention of being polite when he wasn't absolutely certain of crushing him. The moment his Spiritual Artifact flew, his powerful divine ability enveloped the area.

The light between heaven and earth dimmed instantly. On both riverbanks, the assembled forces looked up, confused. The sun was clearly high in the sky, a brilliant Supreme Yang, yet its piercing rays could no longer reach the ground. A dull gloom fell over both shores.

This gloom was not true darkness. Though gray and hazy, everything was still visible, but all colors had become dull and lifeless.

Only the pair of golden eyes on the cliff remained bright.

Li Zhouwei, trapped within the divine ability, felt its effects most keenly. The instant his opponent struck with full force, the rushing water vapor told him everything:

'Valley Water... This is a Valley Water divine ability.'

In the heavy gloom, all the divine abilities and dharma power within Li Zhouwei's body grew sluggish. Valley Water was a Dao that manifested in the world, and his opponent was a direct-line Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Murong family. This divine ability was a preemptive strike, designed to seal his power and seize the initiative!

The golden-eyed man was a fraction of a second too slow in summoning his own divine ability. Murong Yan's Spiritual Artifact was already upon him. The bizarre iron weapon, trailing thick demonic smoke, rushed his face. Li Zhouwei only had time to twist his body and take a single step back.

Murong Yan was not surprised. His "Sunless Deceit" was designed to gain the upper hand, and its effects only grew stronger as his opponent fell into his rhythm!

His Spiritual Artifact had not missed, merely been deflected. But Li Zhouwei wasn't the only one who had bought time; Murong Yan's free hand was already forming hand seals for a spell art!

In that same instant, however, Li Zhouwei halted his retreat. He thrust his hand forward, a large palm piercing the roiling demonic wind, fast as lightning, snatching directly for Murong Yan's throat.

'How arrogant! I have a demonic cultivator's body; I'm not afraid to trade injuries with you!'

A light flashed in Murong Yan's eyes. He aborted the Dharma Art and met the attack with his own palm, pushing his divine ability even harder. But the man before him had already raised his other hand, blocking the incoming Spiritual Artifact with his forearm. Brilliant radiance shone from within his sleeve armor, revealing an inconspicuous golden ring on his wrist.

He wasn't using a Spiritual Treasure—he was meeting the attack with the physical body of the Pure Yang Bracelets!

"Clang!"

A dull clang rang out as the weapons collided. A spark of radiance erupted. Provoked, the Spiritual Treasure released a blinding light, and the suffocating gloom was instantly vanquished. The frozen Heavenly Light finally began to flow again.

Li Zhouwei's figure dispersed and reformed, now at point-blank range. The demonic winds buffeting him dissipated on contact with his dharma body. A bright radiance had lit up between his brows.

But Murong Yan didn't pause, nor did he show any surprise. He stared directly into those golden eyes as the demonic wind howled around his face. A hissing sound emerged from his lips, and something alien could be seen stirring within his mouth.

'Edict!'
