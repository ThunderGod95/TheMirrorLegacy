# Chapter 692: Reactions from All Sides

Li Ximing answered quietly. Li Xuanxuan immediately wiped away his tears and smiled.

“This is a joyous occasion; there should be no tears. Tell me, what of your divine power?”

With a gentle wave of his sleeve, Li Ximing released a stream of celestial light that flowed from his cuff. It traced the contours of the hall’s decorations, plating the entire chamber in a luminous sheen and sealing it off from the outside world.

“It is the Bright Yang Art’s divine power: Audience with the Celestial Gate,” Li Ximing explained softly. “The Azure Pond Sect possesses the *Secret Records of Dongli*, which they obtained from the Dongli Sect’s grotto-heaven. They long ago deduced that I cultivate the *Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art* and were aware of the mysteries of our family’s Radiant Origin Pass. At the time, they paid it little mind.”

“What they didn’t know,” he continued, “is that while I used the *Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art* for my Foundation Establishment, I later converted my cultivation to the fifth-grade *Radiant Essence Scripture*, which shares the same spiritual affinity. It was with this scripture that I reached the Purple Mansion Realm. Hence, the divine power is called Audience with the Celestial Gate.”

Li Xuanxuan looked slightly puzzled. He frowned in thought before asking, “Does this mean that the divine power one forges from the Radiant Origin Pass can differ? That cultivators with different grades of Immortal Foundations will awaken different divine powers upon reaching the Purple Mansion Realm?”

Li Ximing paused for a moment. “The differences are not so great,” he said. “Excluding a few rare exceptions, only techniques of the fifth grade or higher can typically produce a divine power. Whether it is called Radiant Origin Pass or Audience with the Celestial Gate, they are both manifestations of the same Bright Yang Art. Their areas of expertise merely differ slightly.”

“As for sixth or seventh-grade techniques, perhaps their divine powers are even stronger. I have never seen them.”

The celestial light between his brows flickered as he spoke, a thoughtful expression on his face. “Upon forging this divine power, I realized that it is more closely tied to my personal Dao than to the technique I practice. It is as though I am beginning to transcend the constraints of the technique itself. Perhaps this is the difference between nature and fate. The Purple Mansion Realm touches upon fate, and it seems one is no longer bound by the limits of a cultivation art.”

He paused again, choosing his next words with care. “Connecting with the Great Void gave me a faint premonition. It seems the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao is limited by its techniques. Reaching the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm and breaking through to the Golden Core is the absolute limit. Once you forge a Golden Core nature and attain Fruition, you no longer need a technique at all. Your cultivation relies entirely on your own understanding.”

He lifted his teacup and took a small sip. “Perhaps the ancient methods of qi cultivation have arts that can be studied beyond the Golden Core, but the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao ends with the Golden Core. Once you attain Fruition and become a True Monarch, a single thought can alter the world. What technique could possibly guide such a being?”

Li Xuanxuan nodded. After a quick calculation, he said in a low voice, “I have heard that the *Answers to the Beggar Beneath the Mulberry Tree*, a text bestowed by an immortal, is the only known seventh-grade. Fifth and sixth-grade scriptures must be the pinnacle of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao.”

Li Ximing nodded in agreement. He touched a finger to the space between his brows, then gestured outside. The rainbow clouds in the sky instantly dissipated. “Chenghuai cultivates the *Art of Concealed Profundity*. This radiant display is not good for him. It’s best to put it away for now.”

“How has the family fared these past ten years? And what of the world?”

Li Xuanxuan sighed and shook his head, a clear sign that the decade had not been easy. But now that the family had a Purple Mansion cultivator, those past struggles seemed insignificant. “Most of the changes have been in Jiangbei,” he said with a measure of relief. “Daoist Master Changyun’s Chengyun Gate has seized a large territory and stabilized the situation. Two other Purple Mansion cultivators from overseas have also settled there, and now sects and families of all sizes are sprouting up everywhere.”

“Jiangbei is a nexus of spiritual qi, which has also invigorated the wild temples in the untamed lands across the river. The spiritual energy there grows stronger by the day.”

Those untamed lands were on the same terrestrial meridian, situated between Moongaze Lake and the Profound Peak Gate. In the past, the spiritual qi there was sparse, home to little more than desolate temples. Now, with the meridian flourishing, new sects and families were rising.

“As for our family,” he continued, “we’ve faced more and more probing from various factions, all directed at Zhouwei. They’ve been using the Golden Tang Gate and the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion as their pawns to test our relationship with the dragonkin, growing bolder with each attempt.”

“The visit from the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion today was the culmination of that. Had you not broken through, we would have faced considerable trouble.”

“Where is Zhouwei?” Li Ximing asked.

“He feigned a trip to the Eastern Sea to hunt demons, but he’s actually positioned across the river,” Li Xuanxuan explained. “He anticipated that the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion were planning a major assault across the river to the north bank and was preparing to counter it in secret. Your breakthrough disrupted everything, and the situation has completely changed.”

“Not only did the Three Sects not cross the river, but they sent people to offer congratulations and provocations. I don’t know what they were planning.”

Li Ximing nodded. “Whatever their plan was, it no longer matters. Within three months, all the major sects will send representatives with gifts. We must focus on making the proper arrangements.”

He hesitated for a long moment before finally asking, “Is there… any news of my aunt?”

Li Xuanxuan’s breath caught in his throat. “It’s… hard to say,” he said softly. “Qinghong has been away for too long. Five years ago, the jade talisman lost its spiritual nourishment and went dim. It can no longer show her fortune or peril.”

A calm resolve settled in Li Ximing’s heart. “Once things have stabilized,” he said, reassuring his grandfather, “I will discuss it with Zhouwei. We will assess the situation and decide whether to pay a visit to the dragonkin and ask them about this.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded repeatedly. Just then, a sound came from outside the hall. With a thought from Li Ximing, the heavy doors swung open on their own.

Two figures entered. The young woman wore a light red, cloud-patterned satin dress with a silver necklace. A talisman brush hung from her waist, and the cuffs of her sleeves partially concealed a few sheets of talisman paper. She wore no makeup, her skin fair and her eyes bright with spirit. She smiled, her eyes curving into crescents, and bowed respectfully.

“Junior Li Que’wan pays her respects to the Daoist Master!”

The young man beside her was dressed in a pleated robe of purple and white, its crossed collar and cuffs embroidered with patterns of Radiant Fire. A white jade pendant with a golden tassel hung from his waist. His gaze was bright, and he carried himself with a bold and refreshing air.

“Li Jiangqian greets the Daoist Master!”

Li Ximing looked up and gestured for them to approach. Li Que’wan, a sixth-level Qi Refining cultivator, seemed a bit shy. Li Jiangqian, who was already at the seventh level, was quicker to speak.

“Ancestor has broken through to the Daoist Master realm! The whole family is celebrating. Seeing the looks on those fools’ faces was so satisfying.”

Li Ximing chuckled. “You two are advancing too quickly,” he advised. “There’s no need to rush your cultivation. Spend more time practicing your arts.”

“This junior understands.”

After bowing, Li Jiangqian smiled. “Before, we didn’t know Ancestor would emerge from seclusion so soon. The family was short on Foundation Establishment cultivators, so I discussed it with Wan-mei. I would push for a breakthrough first to help the family, and she could take her time.

“But now, it seems that’s no longer necessary!”

Li Jiangqian’s words pleased Li Ximing, who nodded in approval. “Your father,” he asked with a curious smile, “how many children does he have now?”

“In the last decade, he has given me four more younger brothers,” Li Jiangqian replied respectfully. “The little ones haven’t been assigned duties in the clan yet, but they are all showing great promise.”

Li Ximing sipped his tea and chatted with them a while longer. Soon, An Siwei descended on the wind before the hall. “Reporting to the Daoist Master,” he said respectfully, “the envoys from the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion have arrived from across the river.”

Li Ximing had been sitting for less than a day, but the Three Sects had acted with impressive speed. “How did they deal with Floating Cloud Cave?” he asked casually.

An Siwei bowed. “The Floating Cloud Cave is in utter chaos. Everyone scattered like birds and beasts. The sect elders and guest elders stormed the main pavilion to divide the treasures. The Cave Master, fearing punishment, took his own life. His body was torn apart by the crowd and vanished in a flash of light, leaving only his head behind.”

“In the midst of the chaos, the other two sects of Xiaoshi Mountain stormed the Floating Cloud Cave. Under the pretext of purging traitors from the Daoist path, they rounded up and imprisoned the remaining cultivators. They took the heads of all involved and brought them here. Zaixingzi’s entire faction has been trampled to dust… not even bones could be found. They gathered all their spiritual items and sent them over as well.”

“The cultivators from the other two sects have already escorted the men from Floating Cloud Cave to the north bank, bringing the heads and spiritual items with them.”

Li Xuanxuan was left speechless by the account. Li Ximing sipped his tea without a word. Only Li Jiangqian, standing to the side, rubbed the jade pendant in his hand and sneered.

“Such a swift response. In the end, only Zaixingzi’s faction and a late-stage Foundation Establishment Cave Master are dead. They’ve certainly adopted a humble posture… rushing to offer their faces to be slapped on the very day our Daoist Master breaks through, not even daring to wait a single night.”

He paused, calculating. “Judging by the timing, the chaos on Xiaoshi Mountain must have begun the moment the Daoist Master revealed himself. Otherwise, it would have taken half a day just for the news to reach them, let alone for them to arrive before nightfall.”

“Someone must be pulling the strings from behind.”

Li Ximing was well aware that it wasn't just the Golden Tang Gate behind the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion. Even the Golden Tang Gate was only targeting his family because there was something in it for them. “Bring the items forward,” he said softly.

An Siwei withdrew and returned a moment later with a row of jade boxes. He opened the largest and most ornate one, revealing the head of an old man, his face a mask of regret, his hair and beard standing on end.

Celestial light shifted from between Li Ximing’s brows, and the spell concealing the head’s true appearance dissipated. It returned to its state at the moment of death. The features were the same, but where was the regret? There was only astonishment and rage.

He lowered his head and sipped his tea. An Siwei confirmed, “This is indeed the man.”

With a gentle wave of his sleeve, blood began to seep from the sealed head. “Que’wan,” he said, “check his bloodline.”

Li Que’wan understood immediately. She placed one hand on the wrist of the other, formed a sign with two fingers, and lifted a drop of blood with her spiritual qi. As she chanted an incantation, a silvery mercurial light shimmered within the blood. “A fish with a red tail,” she murmured. “Its house is destroyed. Its son, a beast that devours its parents. Distant kin.”

She drew a talisman and pressed it to her wrist, dispelling the silvery light. “He had few children, and his parents, both rogue cultivators, died long ago. His eldest son despised him and has just slain his parents, only to be killed by another.”

The shamanistic talisman art she used was quite accurate. Li Ximing nodded. “It seems the chaos was real. There is indeed a Purple Mansion cultivator keeping an eye on Xiaoshi Mountain.”

Whether Li Que’wan’s divination was precise or not, it was certain that a Purple Mansion cultivator was directing events from behind the scenes. Li Ximing dismissed the two juniors and turned to An Siwei. “Have them leave the reparations. The guest elders may all return. The two Cave Masters, however, will come up to see me. I wish to have a long chat with them.”

***

**Azure Pond Sect, Main Hall.**

Dantai Jin, dressed in fine robes, waited before the hall. A moment later, a guard invited him in. He took a few steps, crossing the threshold and ascending the misty white steps into the grand chamber.

Si Yuanli was practicing calligraphy, seemingly in a good mood. Dantai Jin walked up to him, clasped his hands in a salute, and smiled.

“Sect Master!”

“Brother Dantai, you’ve arrived!” Si Yuanli laughed heartily and produced a small letter from his sleeve, handing it to him with an air of self-satisfaction.

Dantai Jin took it and read it closely, his face immediately lighting up with pleasure. The note contained only a few short lines:

*On the twenty-second, Daoist Master Buzi appeared on Lufang Island in the Southern Sea. He was traveling at great speed using a divine power, seemingly in pursuit of a demon. He appeared for only a few breaths to conduct a magical search before vanishing.*

“Chi Buzi has shown himself!” Dantai Jin knew exactly what Si Yuanli meant.

More than a decade had passed since the turmoil in the Azure Pond Sect, and Chi Buzi had shown no reaction, concerning himself only with his own affairs. The message was clear: he couldn’t care less. If he had possessed even the slightest concern, he wouldn’t have needed to return to the sect; even a single word would have prevented the tragedy of the past.

Dantai Jin’s smile faded, and he lowered his gaze. In a voice barely above a whisper, he asked, “Daoist Master… could it be that he holds a grudge against a certain someone?”

A man of Si Yuanli’s caliber understood immediately. A flicker of fear crossed his heart as his expression grew hesitant. He knew exactly who Dantai Jin was referring to.

‘Lushui!’

“Who can say?” Si Yuanli’s face remained dark and uncertain. “Perhaps he holds a grudge against Chi Wei. The man is resolute in his pursuit of the Dao and is a master of deception. When Chi Wei was alive, you couldn’t see his true nature at all. The moment Chi Wei died, he was like a different person.”

He kept his next thought to himself.

‘Even if he does hold a grudge against Lushui, so what? Ning Tiaoxiao’s resentment was so deep he gave up cultivating his divine power, but what did it accomplish? He only hated himself to death.’

Chi Buzi was a clever man. Si Yuanli didn’t believe he would make such a mistake. At most, he simply wanted to leave the Azure Pond Sect behind.

‘My only worry is what will happen after the old ancestor passes…’

Si Boxiu was a master of talisman arts and possessed several excellent legacies, but time was running out. Si Yuanli was waiting for a Moon Radiance Glazed Fruit to enter seclusion himself.

He stared at the painting on his desk for a moment, then lifted his brush to inscribe it.

Suddenly, Dantai Jin cocked his head as if listening. Si Yuanli paused, his own ears twitching. A vast, resonant voice was passing through the Great Void, echoing through the hall.

“I, Zhaojing, Li Ximing of the Moongaze Li clan, have this day achieved the Bright Yang divine power! I hereby proclaim my clan an Immortal Clan of the Purple Mansion Realm. In three months, a celebratory rite will be held. All fellow Daoists are welcome to attend!”

“Zhaojing, Li Ximing of the Moongaze Li clan…”

Si Yuanli’s hand froze mid-stroke. The half-written character stopped abruptly, leaving a large blot of ink on the painting that spread like a stain, utterly ruining the masterpiece.

*Crack.*

The expensive white-bristle jade brush in his hand shattered. Fine jade powder trickled through his fingers, dusting the painting below. It settled over the face of the old flood dragon at the center of the work, obscuring its eyes in shadow.

“How is this possible…”

Si Yuanli’s composure, cultivated over years, instantly broke. His brow furrowed, his eyes glazed over with shock as he met Dantai Jin’s equally incredulous gaze.

‘A Purple Mansion cultivator in just over a decade?! Li Ximing?’

Dantai Jin looked up, his shock quickly morphing into a grim expression of regret. “I fear we’ve fallen into a trap,” he said in a low voice. “Not just you and I, Sect Master, but likely more than ninety percent of the Purple Mansion cultivators in Jiangnan… We all underestimated him.”

Si Yuanli’s mental fortitude was extraordinary. He took a slow breath, then waved his hand decisively.

“Say no more! Go and visit Li Xizhi at once!”
