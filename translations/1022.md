# Chapter 1022: A Difficult Position

Fachang’s expression was initially one of doubt, but then he saw Minghui smile.

“Senior may not recognize me, but I have certainly heard of you. I was also present at the Great Yang Mountain Dharma Assembly, watching from the foot of the stairs… I remember you well!”

His words were undoubtedly a little tactless. After all, Fachang had gone to Mount Dayang to be reprimanded. Minghui’s claim to have been watching from below meant he had witnessed the full extent of Fachang’s disgrace. Yet, Fachang merely sighed.

“I’ve made a fool of myself in front of you, Minghui.”

Minghui laughed. “A fool? Senior is too kind, but I wouldn’t call it that! After you came down from the mountain without a word and went to the foot of the dais, I was the next one to go up. The great one rewarded me with a slap that nearly took my head off. It was a blow to my body, but a sting to my master’s heart!”

Fachang was suddenly at a loss for words. He was good-natured, but not a fool. He understood the hidden meaning perfectly.

‘A slap to you, Minghui, was a slap to Jinlian's face.’

Although the Way of Joyful Bliss was nominally under the command of Mount Dayang, they were the most rebellious faction in private. They didn't dare to disobey openly, but they were no strangers to shirking their duties and playing tricks. The problem was, the Way of Joyful Bliss was too influential. Unless they made a fundamental error, Mount Dayang had no real way to deal with them. Slapping a disciple’s face was little more than a helpless act of venting.

From his tone, Fachang knew that the Way of Joyful Bliss was still resentful toward Mount Dayang, and it was precisely this streak of cunning defiance that he needed.

But he couldn’t speak rashly. The eminent masters of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm had been actively involved in Mount Dayang’s affairs for years, hoping to use its influence to restrain the Seven Phases and realize their vision of a paradise on earth. They not only relied heavily on Mount Dayang but were themselves part of its heritage. So, for the moment, he remained silent.

Minghui glanced at him, understanding that the stubborn monk still held some respect for Mount Dayang. He adjusted his sleeves and smiled.

“Please, let’s speak inside!”

‘Finally, someone with a brain at Lotus Temple…’

Having stood there awkwardly for what felt like an eternity, Fachang nodded quickly. He took two steps forward, but when he saw Jinlian swaggering over, he could no longer contain himself. He turned, pressed his palms together, and pleaded,

“Your Eminence, please put away your Dharma Treasure!”

Jinlian’s eyes widened, his mouth opening as if to curse. Minghui, looking embarrassed, stepped between them to block their line of sight.

“Please, don’t be offended, don’t be offended…” he said, smiling.

As he spoke, he pulled a golden kasaya from his sleeve. With a gentle flick, he draped it over Jinlian, tying a knot at his chest that covered the offending object.

“Please!” he said again.

Fachang’s expression softened considerably. He moved past them and ascended the golden steps behind the main hall. Jinlian sneered from behind him.

“Fachang! You are caught up in superficial appearances! In my Dao, I view a person as I would a white skeleton. With further contemplation, they are nothing more than the five virtues and twelve streams of qi. The sacred teachings speak of Glazed Contemplation. If you cannot let go of a bit of nakedness, how can you ever let go of the world?”

Fachang took another step forward and, with his palms pressed together, replied,

“It is precisely because I cannot let go of the world.”

Jinlian laughed.

“Those who cannot let go cannot take hold. Those who cannot take hold cannot save. Those who cannot let go of the world wish to control it. And when masters all seek to control… they inevitably fall into endless conflict. What then becomes of the world? Only those who can let go of the world can transmit the sacred teachings and let the people be responsible for themselves. Fachang! It is this inability to let go that all cultivators dislike.”

A smile touched the lips of this Maha, who seemed more like a bandit lord. For a fleeting moment, his eyes grew brighter, filled with a touch of radiance, and he exuded the divine air of the master of Lotus Temple. Fachang simply turned his head away and did not respond.

Minghui wasn’t a student of doctrine, but he knew how much trouble his master could be. His heart pounded in his chest.

Years ago, after Jinlian’s first visit to Mount Dayang, he had barely set foot back in Lotus Temple before spouting utter heresy. He had called the Great Adoration Dharma Realm the “Great Landlord Realm” and the Way of Great Desire the “Lesser Landlord Realm”—as if they were the twisted heirs of the great landlord's side branch, just waiting for the landlord to die.

The Way of Emptiness was the Way of the Headless and Brainless, and the Way of Discipline was the Way of the Selfish and Mute. As for Wrath, it bred fools, and Compassion harbored mongrels. All others were “heretical paths that greatly deceive the masses.”

At the time, Minghui had hastily added, “Only our Way of Joyful Bliss is truly radiant!”

But Jinlian had only spat back, “Pah! Neither joyful nor blissful. It is the Way of Vicious Suffering!”

With this precedent, Minghui truly feared his master would call them the “Great Landlord Realm” to Fachang’s face. He quickly interjected to smooth things over, gesturing for Fachang to sit.

“How does Senior plan to proceed?” he asked, cutting off any further discussion.

Fachang pressed his palms together. “I need to borrow two Maha. If that’s not possible, one will do. But I will need many more Merciful Ones. After all, the Lotus Temple’s Dao lineage is prosperous, with abundant incense offerings… you are not lacking in that department.”

Minghui nodded and glanced at his master. Jinlian was looking back at him, a silent understanding passing between them.

‘Going south… this is definitely about confronting the one by the lake…’

This was a deeply troublesome matter, and Lotus Temple had suffered for it before. Minghui’s heart hammered in his chest with an unspoken anxiety. Jinlian, however, watched Fachang with a heavy gaze.

“So, Fachang is determined to have me go south,” he said, his voice low.

Fachang frowned. “With all due respect, this is a fine opportunity for a Maha, and it will greatly aid in the refinement of your Dharma Body. What… what is the meaning of this, Daoist friend?”

Minghui’s heart skipped a beat. Jinlian, his expression unchanged, sneered. “I need no help. I can achieve it on my own. But if I am injured, all my previous efforts might be wasted. Lotus Temple has stayed out of this matter for the sake of stability…”

Fachang grew even more confused. “Naturally, I would prefer not to trouble Your Eminence to act personally,” he said quietly, “but why are the other Maha of your esteemed Dao… or rather, why is this Maha Minghui, not tempted?”

Minghui cursed inwardly, but his face was a mask of sorrow. “I cannot bear to see the devastation of living creatures!”

“Ah?”

The word caught in Fachang’s throat. He paused, a look of sudden realization dawning on him.

“If you have any requests, Daoist friend, please state them freely!”

Master and disciple fell silent in unison. Fachang gritted his teeth. “If you two Great Masters are willing to act on my behalf and go south to reduce the coming slaughter, I am willing to offer you the Dharma Realm’s Triple-Venerable Purple Aura Fruit!”

Minghui’s brow furrowed, but the moment the words were out, Jinlian slapped the table. He spread his legs wide, rested his hands on his knees, and grinned.

“Now that’s more like it!”

“Then it is settled… I will not disturb you any longer!”

Fachang let out a breath of relief. Finally, he wouldn’t have to look at the man anymore. He rose to his feet at once, so eager to leave before Jinlian could say anything else that he didn’t spare another word. He stepped into the Great Void and vanished.

For a time, only the master and disciple remained in the vast, empty golden hall. Minghui opened his mouth to speak, but stopped when he saw Jinlian rise, his smile gone, his expression as cold as ice.

“This matter could not be refused. It is, after all, a good thing. The conflict between north and south was postponed once already. To refuse again would certainly arouse suspicion. We simply had to raise the price before agreeing.”

Their concerns were the same. Minghui lowered his voice. “This is all my fault for implicating you, Master!”

Years ago, he had caused a disaster. Jinlian had merely glanced at his dharma artifact and brought a great calamity upon himself. Not only was his painstakingly cultivated Immaculate Body of the Buddhas shattered, but even his soul had been damaged. It took him a full century to recover, which indirectly cost him an opportunity during the north-south conflict and delayed Minghui’s own ascension to the rank of Maha until now. Yet, neither of them felt a shred of resentment.

The reason was simple: the methods of that great figure were too terrifying. Although Jinlian was not physically in the Buddhist Land, he was still under the watchful eye of a mighty power. He had dared to peek so brazenly only because a trace of his True Spirit was anchored in the Buddhist Land, with a Dharma Master as his guarantor! Any disturbance from his prying would surely have alerted the Dharma Master. If all was well, he could have claimed the prize for himself!

But even though his True Spirit was anchored in the Buddhist Land, he was grievously injured, and none of the other cultivators noticed a thing! Even when Hongshan Maha Liangli saw Jinlian in person, he only lamented his failure to cultivate the Immaculate Body. And this terrifying power was unleashed merely from viewing Minghui’s severed arm within the dharma artifact!

‘It was either the Underworld or another True Monarch. If it was the Underworld, they could have simply annihilated Minghui, or made it so that no one could divine anything about him, as they did in the past… Why act like this?’

Although neither knew what Jinlian had truly experienced or what kind of technique had afflicted his soul, they had long since identified the suspect as being on the level of a True Monarch—and one who possessed great power but could not reveal it in the outside world!

Later, when the Li family’s Bright Yang manifested, Minghui reported it at once. Initially, without a second thought, they had locked their sights on that Monarch Father, the Wei Emperor, Li Qianyuan.

‘It fits perfectly…’

But upon deeper reflection, Jinlian felt something was wrong.

‘The heavenly might of Wu Earth is so immense, how could there be such a flaw? If Li Qianyuan possessed such power, why would he stand by and watch Luoxia inflict such harm?’

The Bright Yang Dao was a lineage where the strong grew stronger and the weak grew weaker. Its situation was plain for all to see—it was an orthodoxy of extreme defiance. If Li Qianyuan still possessed such ability, it meant he was in excellent condition, powerful enough to slap a Dharma Master twice without anyone daring to object. Why go through all this trouble?

Furthermore, no matter how divine that person’s abilities were, the northern cultivators’ reverence for Luoxia was real. They couldn’t believe Luoxia had miscalculated. Thus, the two shifted their suspicion to the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition.

‘It must be a True Monarch from the Encompassing Profoundity Dao… one who cannot show himself at present… or who is plotting something. Since there is turmoil between north and south, perhaps this is when they intend to use us!’

Jinlian didn’t dare say more. He only whispered, “Now is not the time to speak of this. I had intended to walk a straight path to radiance, but my cultivation has run into problems these past years. My soul is afflicted, and my progress has stalled. I had no choice but to secretly practice a body-splitting art, dividing my soul to conceal my injuries…”

“I’ve managed to cover it up for now, but I cannot leave the Buddhist Land. I still require a large amount of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, so I can’t be of much help. I’ll have your disciple-brother go with you. He is ignorant of these matters… you must look after him in all things… and try not to make it look too obvious…”

Minghui nodded vigorously, a bitter taste in his mouth.

‘If I weren’t afraid of arousing suspicion, I would never go south. Even if I did, and Li Zhouwei slapped my face, I would say, ‘Thank you, thank you.’ If he tried to kill me with his halberd… I would bare my chest to receive it! But now… I can only watch how the situation develops…’

Before he could speak, his expression changed abruptly. He pulled a shining jade talisman from his sleeve. The patterns on its surface shifted rapidly before it shattered with a sharp crack, turning into white sand that trickled through his fingers.

He raised his head, trembling with apprehension, and looked at Jinlian. 

“There’s… there’s news from Yinzhou Island!”

“Yinzhou Island?”

Maha Jinlian froze for a second, then reacted almost instantly.

‘The channel we established through others… the trade deal with the Li family… there’s been a development!’

The two monks shot to their feet, their eyes meeting. A numbing premonition surged through them both.

‘Could it be… that the great one… intends to use us now!’

Eastern Sea.

A storm was brewing, the winds howling fiercely.

On the island, golden light shimmered and dharma radiances intertwined. A few cultivators patrolled between the islets as waves crashed on either side. Midway, they spotted a figure.

He had the refined air of a scholar, dressed in a simple white robe. He flew through the air with an elegant yet urgent posture. The driving rain beat against his protective light, making it gleam brilliantly.

It was Cui Jueyin.

The direct descendant of the Cui family had returned home years ago, and his cultivation had grown ever more profound. Perhaps due to some secret art he practiced, his eyes shone with a piercing light.

But his usually steady brows were now knitted with anxiety. The escaping light beneath his feet sped up, and soon he was riding the wind down toward the sea. The water below was dark and murky, as if countless flood dragons were slithering through its depths.

In the distance, Chongzhou Island was visible. Its shores were lined with Cui family cultivators, and various altars and treasure halls had been erected in a solemn display. Before he could even land, a middle-aged man rode the wind up to meet him, his face a mask of misery.

“Second Brother!” he sighed.

Cui Jueyin nodded silently, following the man’s gaze toward the horizon. Clouds were gathering, morphing into the dim glow of Converging Water, like cascading waterfalls of interwoven light.

The middle-aged man whispered, “Second Brother… what are we to do? You… you always have a way…”

Hearing this, Cui Jueyin let out a heavy sigh.

He wasn’t wrong. When Li Ximing came to the island all those years ago, Cui Xianye had been genuinely terrified. The disciple he sent, Cui Jueyin, though not the most talented, was the most adept at handling matters. It wasn’t a matter of loyalty; he was simply afraid an ignorant disciple would offend Li Ximing and bring disaster upon the island.

And Cui Jueyin, having served for decades in a key position at Moongaze Lake, had seen his share of schemes and betrayals. He was a world apart from the sheltered disciples of Chongzhou Island. Shaking his head gently, he replied, 

“Juechen, since the visitors are from the sea, what other way is there? We can only be respectful and serve them well.”

Just as he finished speaking, the sea below began to churn violently. A muffled roar echoed as the water bulged upward like a hill. A colossal creature broke the surface, sending up a tremendous splash.

A dark shadow instantly enveloped the entire shoreline. As the waves rolled back, two dark, massive shapes were revealed—it was a beast the size of a mountain, covered in scales.

As light reflected off its scales, the entire coast fell silent, the water shimmering. Cui Jueyin silently stepped aside. Cui Juechen, looking rather timid, took a step forward, bowed low, and said respectfully, “This humble cultivator, Cui Juechen of the Chongzhou Cui Clan, greets the envoy!”

A long, droning sound emanated from the beast’s mouth, kicking up a spray of white foam. Then, a cold, arrogant voice barked from its back.

“Who are you! Where is Cui Xianye!”

A cold sweat broke out on Cui Juechen’s brow. Before he could answer, the giant beast before him let out a ferocious roar. A green fish descended from the sky, riding the water. It had a pair of scaly wings under its gills, and its huge fish eyes glared at him with clear displeasure.

“How dare you be slow in a matter concerning the Flood Dragon Palace! Such audacity!” it sneered.

The overbearing declaration sent a stir through the Cui family members, who began to whisper among themselves. Cui Jueyin also frowned inwardly.

‘I heard that when this Dharma Protector came in previous years, he was always very polite… A few days ago when we sent a report to the Flood Dragon Palace, he refused to see us. Now he arrives so aggressively. It’s clear his attitude has soured… Could it be that he finds the bribe insufficient… and wants to raise the price on the spot…’

This was his first time meeting this particular sea patroller. He’d heard the demon was transferred from the south, originally a minor demon who had somehow gained favor and risen rapidly through the ranks. Now, he was notoriously difficult to serve.

The Cui family had, after all, once offered a spiritual item to the Eastern Wanderer. For years, they had held a certain standing among the Dragon-kin. When several of their respected elders had died after failing to break through, the Dragon Palace had even sent representatives.

But without a Purple Mansion Realm expert, all past glory was fleeting. Their standing declined day by day. The previous sea patroller was already discourteous, and now a minor demon transferred from some forgotten corner had the post and could throw his weight around with the Cui family!

“Patroller Hui… Patroller Hui, you misunderstand!”

Cui Juechen had already been given a hard time by him in the sea and was clearly on edge. His body trembled as he dropped to the ground in a full bow, crying out,

“Grandfather… he failed in his breakthrough attempt and perished last year!”

He had clearly reached the same conclusion as his brother. He took out several storage bags from his sleeve, offered them up with both hands, and said respectfully,

“We are deeply remorseful for our late report. These spiritual resources… are an apology to Your Excellency!”

The green fish-like demon sneered and, in a flash, snatched the storage bags from his hands. But his expression remained ugly. He clutched the bags tightly and said coldly,

“An apology? Do you think your grandfather here came to this post just to hear you apologize? I showed you some decency because of your family’s connection to the lake, but it seems I’ve given you too many smiles. You’ve grown insolent!”

His face was hideous, and beads of slime dripped from it. He tucked the storage bags into his sleeve, his tone dripping with sarcasm.

“Well, well… who dares to give me a hard time… Daoist Master Yangya… what a temper he has!”

Thank you for all the blessings! I’m very grateful!

Wishing everyone good health and great fortune!
