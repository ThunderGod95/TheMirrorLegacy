# Chapter 1014: Before the Formation

A flash of silver reflected in his eyes, and a deep chill settled in Cheng Yan’s heart.

'The Stormshatter Wedges.'

The Azure Pond Sect’s Stormshatter Wedges!

This treasure originated from the path of Encompassing Profoundity, a thunder-aspected artifact of the Dharma path. Within that single silver glint lay one thousand eight hundred and twenty-one individual wedges. Just ten of them could shatter an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm formation. All of them, gathered together… it was one of the few treasures in Jiangnan capable of rapidly dismantling a Purple Mansion Realm formation!

Changxiao had obtained his Dao Lineage from a Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven in the Eastern Sea. As the first Purple Mansion Realm cultivator raised by the Changxiao Gate, Cheng Yan knew more about this artifact than most disciples of the Azure Pond Sect itself.

But beyond the power of the Stormshatter Wedges, the implications they carried sent an even colder dread through him.

'They wouldn't have just fallen into his hands. The Azure Pond Sect must not only approve of this, but they must be offering their full support! Ning Wan is useless now, so it must be that man Si… that Si wants me dead, too…'

'And behind the Azure Pond Sect… it’s most likely the Yang Clan…'

'This shouldn't be happening… it absolutely shouldn't…'

But in the space of a single thought, the silver light in Li Zhouwei’s palm had already scattered into a sky full of flowing streams. Each stream materialized into a silver-white, handleless, diamond-shaped blade over three feet long, covered in profound patterns of lightning.

Rumbling thunder crackled and arced between them. The sky became a starfield of silver points, densely packed yet orderly, spreading to every corner of the heavens. It was like a vast, suffocating net, descending with crushing weight.

Every eye in the sect turned to Cheng Yan, but the Daoist Master had no more time for contemplation. No matter how the situation had changed, he could not stand by and watch the Stormshatter Wedges destroy their great formation!

"Voom…"

A dense brilliance of Wu Earth finally erupted, its power shaking every corner of the mountain. The light twisted and coiled as it rose, transforming in a breath into a colossal umbrella that soared into the sky. It was a tapestry of brown and yellow, interwoven with patterns of gold and green, blotting out the sun and blocking every last streak of thunder and light.

"BOOM!"

The silver-white lightning flowed uselessly across the umbrella’s canopy, rapidly ground away and shattered by the Wu Earth brilliance. With light and thunder held at bay, the Changxiao Gate was plunged into darkness. Cheng Yan’s voice boomed like thunder, echoing through the night sky.

"Li Zhouwei! By unleashing such demonic slaughter… where do you place the True Qi of the righteous path!"

But the profound Bright Yang Celestial Gate, hanging above the light and thunder, did not waver in the slightest. The golden-eyed young man took a step forward. The space between his brows blazed, and the Bright Yang radiance from within the Celestial Gate surged up his robes.

"Changxiao pledged allegiance to the north, and you, Cheng Yan, are a lecher and a degenerate. How dare you speak of True Qi? I did not come today for the sake of True Qi! Nor do I intend to uphold any universal radiance. Instead…"

He bared his teeth in a grin, his eyes cold.

"I have come to avenge Lake Xian."

Before his words faded, a brilliant radiance erupted. Cheng Yan’s body flickered with the glow of Wu Earth. Not daring to be careless, he crossed his hands before his chest and summoned a pearl.

The Wu Earth spirit embryo, the Wu Bloom Pearl!

The Wu Earth brilliance was incredibly dense, like the unfathomable depths of the solid earth itself. It received the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, causing ripples of deep purple fire to flare across its surface.

"Rumble…"

The Wu Earth brilliance trembled but stood firm against the Bright Yang, showing no fear. Its light, however, was rapidly diminishing. A flicker of joy rose in Cheng Yan, but then a spark of Supreme Yang flared within the hidden light. The two radiances resonated, and the spirit embryo in his hand suddenly became searingly hot!

He poured his divine ability into the spirit embryo with all his might while searching for an opening. He saw that the Audience with the Celestial Gate in the sky remained motionless, locked firmly onto him, and that Li Zhouwei himself was merely employing a simple spell art from his brow.

Cheng Yan had, after all, been a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for over sixty years. Even if his talent was somewhat lacking compared to the geniuses of his generation, his methods were seasoned and ruthless. He showed no sign of retreat. He snapped his head up, shaking loose a speck of brilliance.

Wu Earth divine ability, Immortal Without Flaw!

This speck of brilliance, a fusion of divine ability and spell art, seemed ordinary but carried a different quality. The Daoist Master’s expression shifted, turning grim, but he was supremely confident in his power.

'Such arrogance… Even if I haven’t progressed in recent years, do you really think you can defeat me so casually!'

The brilliance expanded at an incredible rate, pulsing in the air as if breathing. Within it, a seven-colored light merged into a profound unity of white, transforming into a torrent of Heavenly Glow. But Cheng Yan felt a searing heat on his face. He raised his brows slightly and realized the young man was already upon him!

"Voom…"

A sharp, brilliant halberd descended. Strands of tangled white radiance fell like ropes, carrying the power of the Sun's Resonant Radiance Art, flaring and dying amidst the brilliance. Cheng Yan’s voice was like ice.

"Bright Yang… even Bright Yang must bow before Wu Earth!"

His Art-Suppressing, Light-Quelling Wu Brilliance had been exceedingly difficult to cultivate. Combined with his Wu Earth divine ability, Immortal Without Flaw, it was built around the supreme concept of Wu Earth Flawlessness—perfect for subjugating all arts and buying him time to maneuver! The moment he neutralized the tangled hidden light, he would immediately flee into the Great Void!
'Even if you are a White Qilin, you possess only two divine abilities! How can you possibly spare the attention to stop me while dealing with my Wu Brilliance!'

But the words had barely left his mouth when a golden light leaped from the halberd, creating a second, identical golden halberd that bypassed the clash and stabbed directly at Cheng Yan’s face!

Cheng Yan was no Buddhist cultivator; he had no intention of underestimating this strike. He was forced to manifest his divine ability to block the Bright Yang. In that slight pause, the radiance between the golden-eyed youth’s brows swiftly turned to darkness, revealing the sign of a solar eclipse.

Emperor Qi’s Light!

From the eclipse sigil, countless streams of light emerged, black at their tips and golden at their tails. They were like nimble, venomous snakes, carving graceful arcs through the air and kicking up a furious storm of dharma power.

The spell art was so potent it sent a wave of heat across Cheng Yan’s face, leaving him with a lingering fear.

'What a terrifying spell art! Good thing my Wu Brilliance is already in place!'

And just as he expected, as the thousands of black-and-gold streams stretched out, the ethereal, immortal-aspected brilliance swelled in response. It became like the solid, unshakable earth, swallowing every last ray of light without exception!

Cheng Yan finally broke free and stepped into the pitch-black of the Great Void. Just as a sliver of doubt rose in his mind, he felt a sudden chill from above. He snapped his gaze upward.

Hanging in the Great Void was a Purple-Gold Thunder Mace. Lightning flashed across its surface, which was covered in dense, profound patterns—engravings for slaying demons and dispelling evil. A purple-gold light shone down, unleashing a sea of thunder!

Cheng Yan’s Protective Spirit Umbrella was still down on the mountain. Caught completely off guard, he was instantly trapped in the lightning sea, unable to maneuver. But the Purple-Gold Thunder Mace wasn't finished. Its light grew ever more brilliant as it unleashed a massive thunderbolt.

"BOOM!"

Cheng Yan’s Wu Bloom Pearl immediately shot up, meeting the thunderbolt head-on and exploding into a shower of brown light.

Thanks to the principle of Wu Earth quelling thunder, even a surprise attack of this magnitude only caused his face to pale. But the heavens seemed enraged. Thunderbolts descended one after another, nose to tail, each one thicker than the last, hammering him until he was overwhelmed.

Yet amidst the intersecting lightning, Cheng Yan’s expression changed. His divine ability, Immortal Without Flaw, though not a Life Divine Ability, was exceptionally wondrous. It sent him a dark premonition, a sudden, dreadful understanding.

'Not good!'

Sure enough, patches of radiance began to appear in the Great Void, revealing the form of the Celestial Gate. He could no longer be bothered with the lightning; he immediately leaped from the Great Void back into the physical world!

But while Cheng Yan had been momentarily trapped, the solar eclipse sigil in the physical world had not paused for an instant. The darkness within it had deepened, and the streams of light emerging from it had split from one to two, and two to four. They moved like demon gods from the Nine Nethers, unfurling their full might to blanket the entire sky.

The speck of Wu Brilliance, truly worthy of its flawless nature, was not outdone. It expanded in sync, becoming a hazy, benevolent brown-yellow fog that sheltered all living things. But it was a river without a source. Its last dregs of divine ability and dharma power were wrung dry in an instant, and it collapsed with a deafening roar.

"BOOM!"

The countless black-and-gold streams that had been bound within it erupted forth, blotting out the sky as they swarmed through the air. Cheng Yan, who had just finished maneuvering, was instantly forced out of hiding, his face a mask of shock—he had only just managed to form a single spell art!

'His words… they weren't just talk…'

A sense of crisis unlike anything he had ever felt washed over the Daoist Master. Between his own life and the Changxiao Gate, he chose the former without a moment’s hesitation.

The spirit umbrella protecting the mountain from the Stormshatter Wedges vanished in an instant, reappearing in his palm. He immediately opened it, and it swayed under the assault of Emperor Qi’s Light like a lone lotus leaf in a downpour.

Cheng Yan showed no signs of panic. Even though everything had exceeded his predictions, he had already tossed another Spiritual Artifact into the Great Void to resist the lightning. A pale white talisman appeared before him as he simultaneously unleashed the spell art in his hands.

'The Form-Dissolving Mind-Shift Talisman!'

He had no intention of getting entangled with this White Qilin. Li Ximing and Si Yuanli had yet to appear; if the situation changed, it would almost certainly be a fatal development!

The talisman combined with his spell art and instantly released a boundless radiance. Before the talisman even fully activated, hazy clouds of mist were already rushing out, attempting to freeze every divine ability and spell art in place.

'By my decree!'

With the protective layer of his spell art gone, the demonic scene of the solar eclipse and Emperor Qi's Light was finally revealed to all the disciples of Changxiao Gate. The sky was no longer obstructed. A faint smile touched Li Zhouwei’s lips as an object materialized before him.

It was round like a Golden Core, wrapped in countless golden threads, and as red as flame. It pulsed with the glow of Radiant Fire. It was the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument.

Swarm of Light!

An immensely vast suppressive force instantly spread across the area. Cheng Yan’s Form-Dissolving Mind-Shift Talisman activated in the nick of time. His divine ability circulated, not only cleverly evading the sky full of light streams but also transforming him into a scattering of Wu Earth brilliance.

He left behind only an endless, disorienting mist that spread through the air, meant to interfere with Li Zhouwei’s judgment.

Li Zhouwei’s expression, however, did not change much. He allowed the Wu Earth brilliance to flow past him. His own divine ability remained unshaken, hanging high in the air, ready to strike, preventing any long-distance escape.

Only his golden eyes brightened slightly. He turned his head and stared coldly to his left.

"A joke."

Cheng Yan’s spell art was decent, but back then, even Helian Wumeng’s Thousand-Hundred Body had failed to deceive his golden eyes. What was a mediocre talisman in comparison?

Cheng Yan had been searching for an escape route when that sudden gaze locked onto him, making his blood run cold. But it was too late! He had made several mistakes in that single instant… and even though he wasn't seriously injured, even though he might have had other options, the combination of those errors was fatal.

Beneath the radiant Celestial Gate, there was suddenly no one there.

Sovereign’s Perilous Tread.

The young man’s face arrived before Cheng Yan almost at the same instant he turned, so close he could see his reflection. Complex, scale-like golden patterns were mirrored in Cheng Yan’s pupils. The Daoist Master only felt his throat tighten as an iron hand clamped down on it, a suffocating sense of danger flooding his mind.

'Damn it!'

A powerful, wrenching force slammed into him. Before the stunned eyes of his entire sect, the Daoist Master of Changxiao Gate had his divine ability shattered. He was lifted by one hand and held high in the air!

Cheng Yan had calculated a thousand possibilities, wracked his brain, but he had never imagined this. The moment he activated a spell art and a Purple Mansion Realm talisman should have been his safest… how could he suddenly be captured! But no matter how much he failed to understand, his heart was filled with nothing but icy despair.

His connection to his Spiritual Artifact, the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, had been severed!

Not only that, but the instant his opponent’s hand closed around his neck, a sharp, piercing pain shot through his mind, and his vision went black.

The eyes of the young man before him were a sea of pure radiance, and the light between his brows had become tangible. Cheng Yan awoke as if from a dream, but it was far too late. His divine abilities were still surging toward his neck in a desperate struggle. Under the suppression of the Bright Yang divine ability and the Swarm of Light, his head tore itself free from his neck without hesitation!

Back then, Helian Wumeng, whose Dharma Body was formidable and who excelled at close-quarters combat, had only managed to escape in a sorry state after Li Zhouwei had locked his throat. Cheng Yan had some skill in spell arts, but how powerful could his Dharma Body be?
What’s more… Li Zhouwei was no longer the same man he once was. He had now mastered Sovereign’s Perilous Tread!

Cheng Yan's head had just taken flight when another large hand clamped down on the back of his skull. Dazzling Heavenly Light transformed into an endless tide of white, pouring in through his eyes, nose, and ears, accompanied by a sharp, grating sound like scraping metal.

"BOOM!"

The head let out a miserable roar. Searing Heavenly Light erupted from Cheng Yan’s wide-open mouth. His body, still trapped in Li Zhouwei’s grip, forcibly snapped in half at the chest and, powered by his divine ability, tried to fly into the Great Void!

But Li Zhouwei merely squeezed the head lightly, not even bothering to look back.

What met Cheng Yan’s fleeing torso was the massive Celestial Gate emerging from the Great Void. Its two enormous white pillars slammed down with a roar, wreathed in roiling purple flames. They crushed him back into the physical world, shattering all his Wu Earth brilliance and pinning him firmly in mid-air.

A pale white scroll hung from the top of the Celestial Gate, tied with a thin golden thread. It swayed gently, still rolled up, yet it bound the entire gate together, turning it into an immovable object.

"Rumble…"

The endless white light continued to pour from the head. All its flesh and blood were incinerated, leaving only a jade-like, brown-yellow skull. Its jaw trembled, emitting a low plea.

"My lord… my lord…"

The young man smiled.

"You’re too polite, fellow Daoist. It seems you weren’t carrying the Yongjing Profound Ring after all. We waited and waited, but it was all for nothing."

He casually tossed the skull to the base of the Celestial Gate, took a step forward, and let his gaze drift down to the mountain sect below.

'Making three Spiritual Treasures move, having the Stormshatter Wedges respond, and me killing you personally… if you have a next life, this will be something worth bragging about.'

But the entire Changxiao mountain sect had become a sea of dead silence. Tens of thousands of people stood on the mountain, yet the only sound was the rustling of wind through the forest. This silence spread from the peak all the way to the base. Not a single person dared to ride the winds. Not a single person dared to look up.

Countless cultivators lowered their heads in terror, standing rooted to the ground, a single thought echoing in their minds:

'How long did that take? A mighty Daoist Master… a venerable master of divine abilities… how long did that even take?'
