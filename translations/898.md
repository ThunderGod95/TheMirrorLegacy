# Chapter 898: Consolidation

Just as he finished speaking, a cold wind gusted. Ning Wan arrived, riding a flurry of snow, and landed nearby. She seemed slightly surprised to see Li Ximing but nodded in greeting.

Tinglan gave her an extra glance before composing herself. "Since Zhaojing has already decided," she said softly, "I will not say more. I shall explain it to you here."

"My Purple Smoke Gate was once known as the Purple Smoke Abbey, just a minor abbey in this region. We had our own small Daoist tradition and were loosely affiliated with the Wanling Upper Sect. During the age of the Immortal Mansion, Jiangnan was relatively peaceful, and our cultivators often traveled the mortal world."

"Later, our founder, Taixu, returned from his studies. His divine abilities shook heaven and earth, and he established the Supreme Yang orthodoxy for the Purple Smoke Gate. However, the 'World's Radiance' lineage we possess is not a remnant of the Supreme Yang. Its origins are far older. The cultivation art is literally titled 'World's Radiance,' not 'Luminous Heart.' It was left behind by an ancient cultivator of the Li clan who fled south during a calamity."

Li Ximing listened intently as she continued.

"The required Spiritual Qi must be gathered daily from the very first bright ray of dawn. During the collection, it is supplemented and refined with various spiritual items to produce it. This is different from the common techniques in Jiangnan; it uses the Method of Pure Light. It is suitable for all four seasons, and the collection time is not long."

"Our sect has three portions prepared. Even if we needed a few more, it wouldn't take long. As for what Purple Smoke wants in return..."

Tinglan sighed softly. "In this current situation, it's complicated. Although Purple Smoke possesses this cultivation art, it is tied to an old rebellion. No one cultivates it anymore; just keeping it is taboo. We would rather exchange it for a different Purple Mansion Realm art. That would at least provide another path for us."

Li Ximing nodded to himself. The two parties were allies and had to face the situation in the north together. It was natural they wouldn't create complications for each other. This was, without a doubt, the most sensible arrangement.

He hesitated for a moment. His family didn't have many arts they could trade. Even as allies, the *Radiant Essence Scripture* was not something to be given away. The only Purple Mansion Realm arts they could publicly offer were the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra*, the *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass*, the *Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra*, and the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra*.

'The *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass* was from the Cui family. Azure Pond and Xiukui already divided the arts from the Golden Tang Gate; Purple Smoke likely received a share as well...'

Sure enough, Tinglan spoke softly.

"The *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* belongs to the 'Jade True' lineage. I heard that after the Jiang family was destroyed, it ended up on the lake. The Yu family of that era entered Yuanwu Peak. I've overheard seniors discussing it; back then, word was that the lineage's qi had been severed. One could only sigh in regret."

"Now, however, the 'Jade True' path is experiencing a great resurgence. I hear your esteemed clan can already cultivate it... and has even developed a method for gathering its specific qi..."

Li Ximing smiled.

"That part isn't difficult. The only issue is that Courtly Red Dust Qi is scarce. Even with the auxiliary methods my family employs, the next available portion won't be ready for over two years. If you give me a portion of the Luminous Heart Origin Qi now, I will have that portion of Courtly Red Dust Qi delivered to Purple Smoke when it is ready."

Tinglan naturally understood how rare Courtly Red Dust Qi was; its value was far greater than that of the Luminous Heart Origin Qi, and it was just as difficult for the Li family to acquire. If it weren't, Li Queyi, who was currently cultivating at Purple Smoke, would have started practicing the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* long ago. Who would pass up a complete Purple Mansion Realm Daoist tradition? She understood his offer of one portion now implied a larger, ongoing exchange, so she simply nodded, settling the matter.

Ning Wan had been listening quietly the entire time. As a cultivator from Azure Pond, she was well aware that her sect had a hand in the Jiang family's destruction. Although Azure Pond's disciples couldn't practice this art, a copy was almost certainly hidden away in their Daoist repositories. She simply kept silent, not wanting to spoil the trade.

With the deal struck, Tinglan rode off on the wind to retrieve the art. Li Ximing had already memorized the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra*, so he didn't need a physical copy; he could just transcribe it from memory. He took this brief opportunity to voice the question bothering him.

"I noticed Tinglan was extremely guarded... That rebellion must have been a major affair."

At this, Ning Wan's expression turned regretful. She replied:
"You can't blame her. The matter is incredibly complex and difficult to speak about... I know a few vague details, at least. I can try to explain."

"The 'World's Radiance' lineage is passed down by Ziqi Peak. Back then, Ziqi Peak was at its zenith and had held the inheritance for a long time. One of their disciples achieved the rank of Daoist Master, taking the Daoist name Ting Qian."

"When this Ting Qian... became a Daoist Master, his own master, Daoist Master Yuanjing, was guarding the sect and in closed-door cultivation. The other two Daoist Masters, Zipei and Zimu, were away on personal matters. One had fled to the Eastern Sea, and the other... had vanished without a trace. This unexpectedly left Ting Qian in charge."

Ning Wan seemed hesitant to continue, her voice dropping.

"At the time, Ziqi Peak was poised to become the foremost peak. This Daoist Master Ting Qian was not only powerful, but he also had a disciple under him... who was also exceptionally talented. But when he attained his divine ability... he let his base nature take over. He acted perversely, forcing her and several other disciples to dual cultivate with him... And within the entire Purple Smoke Gate, not a single person spoke out."

Her voice became almost inaudible. She turned her head away, sighed, and continued.

"When Daoist Master Yuanjing emerged from seclusion, he was initially joyful to hear a new Daoist Master had appeared, but he was immediately struck speechless by the situation. He summoned the disciples for questioning. Naturally, they all claimed it was consensual, weeping uncontrollably. But with his Life Divine Ability in play, who could tell if they were sincere? They even brought in one of Xiukui's Spiritual Artifacts, but unexpectedly, this particular Life Divine Ability was somewhat insidious. The investigation became a tangled mess and only brought more scandals to light."

"The scandal was public for a time, but what happened next was kept from the outside world. We only heard that Ting Qian was executed, and the female disciple committed suicide in indignation. Daoist Master Yuanjing was devastated and never recovered, eventually perishing in the west. After that, the matter was never spoken of again."

Li Ximing was shaken by the story, his brow furrowed deeply.

Apart from Chi Wei, who had become corrupt in his old age, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's moral standards were undoubtedly higher than those overseas. The lower ranks were debatable, but at least they maintained appearances. And in earlier eras, the rules were even stricter. This, however... this was truly difficult to comment on.

'Daoist Master Chengyan of the Changxiao Gate did far worse... and it only earned him a few jokes. A Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, if he truly wanted dual cultivation partners, wouldn't need to be so extreme... Ning Wan probably understated the situation. That female disciple must have been an important direct descendant of the Kan and Wen families.'

'This rebellion likely caused a generational gap in the Purple Smoke Gate. It directly cost them two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and one promising candidate. Otherwise, the Great Daoist Master wouldn't have needed to go all the way to the lands of Qi to recruit Tinglan, an outsider who started her cultivation late, as a disciple.'

They both fell into a strained silence, wary of the taboo topic. After a long while, Tinglan returned, riding a stream of Purple Qi. She appeared much calmer as she passed a jade slip and a jade bottle from her sleeve to Li Ximing.

"Here you are."

Li Ximing accepted them calmly. He swept his spiritual sense over the jade slip and saw the title written within:

*Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart*

This cultivation art was indeed fourth-grade, on par with the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra*. Li Ximing stored it away and offered his thanks. The two Daoist Masters then turned the conversation to the situation in the mountains. Ning Wan spoke first.

"The Way of Emptiness has retreated, but they will certainly return. The Way of Great Desire was hit hard, so they probably can't dispatch any experts for a while. But the powers *behind* the Way of Emptiness have gauged our strength. They won't give up. They will eventually come again."

"It's just that with their retreat, the north is now desolate. The temples are empty. Monks and Master Monks alike, not a single one remains. There is nothing... except for masses of common people, slowly migrating north. These people... are difficult to manage."

"We absolutely cannot send our own people to occupy that territory; it would just stretch our forces thin for no gain. But if we ignore them, there are many demonic cultivators in the north. Countless people will die... Yet if we try to bring them to Jiangbei..."

Ning Wan looked worried. "These people are all fervent followers of the Buddhists. They don't even fear suicide. I'm afraid bringing them here would be inviting trouble. We would only end up adding to the slaughter."

Li Ximing understood her anxiety. The Baijiang Creek region was sparsely populated, so he asked.

"Daoist Friend, your Life Divine Ability... could it save them?"

Both women shook their heads. Ning Wan answered.

"This has nothing to do with divine abilities. They genuinely believe in suffering in this life to enjoy bliss in the next, and that falling to the demonic path means certain hell. They aren't being influenced by any power; this is their true faith."

Hearing this, Li Ximing realized just how thorny the problem was. When comparing the Immortals and the Buddhists, the Immortals were far behind in winning the 'hearts of the people.' He sighed internally and said.

"Then our only option is to send ten or twenty people to guide them to the territory of the Lotus Temple. Otherwise, having hundreds or thousands slaughtered at the foot of our mountain... it reflects poorly on us."

"That is one way to handle it."

It was undeniably absurd. They had just driven back the northern forces, and now they had to send the refugees *to* them—even if it was to the Way of Joyful Bliss's Lotus Temple. It was an extremely uncomfortable solution. Tinglan's expression was grim, but given the circumstances, she could only concede.

"After all, the Lotus Temple hasn't made any hostile moves so far. That 'Jinlian' in particular has an ambiguous attitude. For now, we should try to keep that Daoist tradition stable. It's best if we don't give them a reason to get involved."

Tinglan then took a jade talisman from her sleeve and handed it to him. "The situation in the north could change at any moment," she reminded him. "If something urgent happens, I will use this talisman to alert you. When that time comes, I must ask you to come north immediately to help us resolve the crisis."

Li Ximing, with his divine abilities and Spiritual Artifacts, might not be able to confront Maha, but he was unquestionably the best choice for suppressing the Merciful One. He had experience, and the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition clearly needed him. Li Ximing, however, naturally wanted more time to prepare. He quickly cupped his hands.

"I happen to be on the verge of mastering one or two Dharma Arts. Since you two Daoist Friends will be guarding the mountain, I will return to my seclusion!"

This was, after all, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's home turf, so Li Ximing didn't overstep. His objective achieved, he agreed to their request, transformed into a ray of light, and departed, landing back at the lake.

With the Li family's forces all stationed at Baijiang Creek and Tangdao Mountain, the lake estate felt deserted. He flew into the main hall and found Li Jianglong listening to a report from a man in white robes.

The white-robed man was strikingly handsome and carried himself with an elegant air; it was, of course, Fei Qing'yi of the Fei family.

'Right, the Fei family. I need to send them to Xiukui soon. Fei Qing'yi himself, however, can stay for a bit. Tangdao Mountain is short on manpower, after all.'

Seeing Li Ximing materialize from a flash of light, Fei Qing'yi dropped to his knees with a thud. Li Jianglong also rose from his seat and bowed deeply to the Daoist Master.

"Greetings, Lord!"

Without needing a gesture from Li Ximing, Li Jianglong spoke respectfully.
"The family's second contingent of cultivators, led by Guest Elder Fei, is preparing to depart as reinforcements for Jiangbei. After the handover is complete, Jiangxia will lead his people and transfer to Tangdao Mountain to defend against the north."

Li Ximing waved his hand, dismissing Fei Qing'yi. His gaze fell on a youth standing to the side. Li Jianglong immediately introduced him.

"This is my clan cousin, Li Jiangzong. He is a talent from the first branch and used to follow Lady Minggong. He is currently on the island, managing affairs in Qingdu. Among the brothers of the first branch, he is the most promising."

"Mm."

Li Ximing had heard of him. He saw the young man's expression was respectful and calm, and he nodded inwardly. He wasn't exceptionally brilliant, but in these times, one couldn't ask for too much. Talented and obedient was good enough.

He didn't expect much from Li Zhouming, anyway. The family had four branches, and for the first branch to produce someone like Li Jiangzong was already fortunate. He smiled.

"You've been working hard."

"It is this junior's duty!"

Li Jianglong bowed again, speaking deferentially.

"It's just that... a few months ago, my wife conceived, and I am overjoyed. But I have long been unable to settle on a name. Now that I see you, Daoist Master, I was hoping you might bestow a name, to let the child be blessed by your spiritual grace!"

'Clever. Seizing every opportunity.' Li Ximing thought, smiling and shaking his head. Still, it was good news. He pondered for a moment and replied.

"...This is truly a name your father should choose. But since you have asked me, I will oblige. A great war is imminent, chaos is rampant, and so many have gone north. We should choose an auspicious name. Let us designate the name 'Huan' (Return)."

"Li Suihuan."

Li Jianglong immediately prostrated himself, tears streaming down his face as he spoke with profound respect.

"This junior thanks the Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing glanced over and saw Li Jiangzong, standing behind Li Jianglong, looking thoughtful. He nodded to himself.

'He may not be as shrewd as Jianglong or Jiangxia, but at least he understands what just happened.'

One had to understand that of all Li Zhouwei's children, only Li Jiangqian had a name (Qian - 迁) that used the 'movement' radical (辶). The others—Jianglong, Jiangxia, Jiangliang—did not follow the generational naming convention. There was even an implicit intent in the clan law to exclude them. For Li Jianglong to have a son now, naming him was a major political issue!

Li Jianglong seizing the opportunity, insisting that he, the Daoist Master, provide the name, and immediately prostrating himself—it was all because he didn't dare make such a presumptuous move himself. He was just asking for a name, but it was *which* name that mattered.

Faced with this little scheme, Li Ximing felt rather complicated. He just waved his sleeve.

"Things are difficult for the family right now. You may also have to go north. Be careful."

To put it bluntly, aside from Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan, everyone was expendable in the current struggle against the north. Yet even as Li Ximing wanted to keep those two by his side on the island, he worried. If they never experienced real combat, never struggled on the brink of life and death, they would never be properly tempered.

'Reaching the Purple Mansion Realm isn't just about talent. Without my master, without my brother Xijun, without all those years of suffering and setbacks our family endured, how could I possibly have passed that threshold?'

'Jiangqian is doing better, but Que'wan... she's had it too easy. She's been protected too well all these years. Just letting her cultivate peacefully isn't right.'

He remained silent for a long time before his body dissolved into a stream of light and floated away. He reappeared in the center of the island, where he found Li Que'wan. As expected, she was cultivating, practicing her arts. Her cultivation base was solid, only a single step away from the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. Li Ximing bade her rise and spoke softly.

"Go into seclusion for now. You don't need to polish your cultivation base any further. In the events to come, you will be required to face the enemy."

Hearing this, Li Que'wan's expression turned solemn. She bowed and immediately withdrew.

The inner sanctum of the island fell empty and silent. Li Ximing felt a wave of hesitation.

'I can't rest easy sending them out for 'experience' if I have to watch over them constantly. Forget it... I'll just have to take it one step at a time.'

It used to be that several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators would discuss the Li family's major affairs. Li Ximing was just a junior then; he didn't have to lead, just fill in the gaps. Now, he was a Daoist Master with a divine ability, the *only* Daoist Master. Those beneath him were full of their own thoughts but dared not speak. And there was certainly no one left who dared offer him advice...

'Even Grandfather speaks to me with veiled caution now... How can I expect anything from anyone else?'

He finally made his way to the main hall. He saw the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda standing there, having reverted to its true form. Within it, one could faintly see the roiling energies of water, fire, wind, and thunder.

He transformed into a ray of Heavenly Light and flew into the pagoda, sealing the entrance behind him with his divine ability. He landed directly on the highest level, the Pavilion of Northern Palace Thunder. He wrapped the jade talisman Tinglan had given him in his power and suspended it within the lightning, setting it so that it would shatter at the slightest disturbance. Only then did he close his eyes. His spiritual sense soared upward, reaching for the Talisman Seed within his Shengyang Acupoint.

Tinglan would use the talisman to alert him, but his family was large and had many affairs. If a guest arrived or trouble brewed while Li Que'wan was in seclusion, his family members would come to the pagoda and find no one. That would be a problem. This setup was to prevent that.

'If I had a Traversal Token, this wouldn't be so complicated... Still, it's good that I've obtained the information on the Life Divine Ability.'

In an instant, the scenery before him shifted. He had arrived in another realm, and an incredibly dense wave of Spiritual Qi washed over him. He sat down within a field of pristine light and took out the *Tread on Flames* manual.

'I've been practicing these Movement techniques for years... I've already gained some insights. With one more push, I'll have fully mastered *Tread on Flames*.'

'Let the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition deal with Tangdao Mountain. If Tinglan never calls for me, I can continue studying the *Radiant Celestial Wave Art* and the *Arranged-Mansions Celestial Yang Escape Art*. One more completed spell art means fewer injuries when the time comes!'
