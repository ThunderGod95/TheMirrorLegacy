# Chapter 490: Cry

The burly man in front of Li Qinghong was momentarily stunned before recalling his purpose. Realizing the tough stance she had taken, he could only humble himself and soften his tone.

"I was indeed rude and offensive before... I wish only for a Wanglin Blossom! Please help me, fellow Daoist!"

Seeing him relent, Li Qinghong pulled a jade box from her storage pouch and replied kindly, "Saving lives is important. You can take it first."

The burly man's face lit up instantly with joy. Without pausing to express his gratitude or discuss any rewards, he nodded vigorously and took the flower, then dashed away like the wind.

Once he was gone, Li Qinghong lowered her spear and descended to the ground. Purple lightning flickered all around her, and below, Li Xicheng beamed with joy.

"Congratulations, Auntie!" he exclaimed, beaming.

She chuckled softly, ruffling Li Xicheng's hair.

"When I entered seclusion on the mountain, you were still a boy who dropped his spear because of thunder... Now, in the blink of an eye, you're already thirty years old. I can hardly recognize you!"

Li Xicheng also chuckled and could barely contain his happiness.

"I'm just glad you broke through successfully, Auntie!"

"Where's Brother Jiao?" Li Qinghong asked as she tightened her grip on the spear, "Now that I've finally reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, I'm itching to challenge him!"

"Hahaha..."

Laughter echoed from afar as a man in black rode in on the wind, his expression full of pride.

"You've really succeeded, Qinghong!"

"Greetings, Ancestor!"

It turned out to be Li Yuanjiao, who had been summoned by the person whom Li Xicheng had sent to summon him. All the cultivators bowed in haste.

Li Yuanjiao rarely showed such joy, laughing heartily.

"This is great!"

With a wave of his hand, he dismissed the external cultivators. He then looked Li Qinghong up and down, and upon seeing her gentle smile, praised, "I expected no less of an ancient method like the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique. The thunder and lightning you can harness, along with purple light flowing around you, give you a more powerful aura than me."

Li Qinghong laughed and replied, "I've achieved the Profound Thunderpool immortal foundation. I've transformed my sea of qi into a thunderpool, with purple and silver qi rising and thunder crackling everywhere around me—it's quite impressive."

With that, she brushed her hair back with a satisfied smile on her face.

"I've studied several spells at home, and the Profound Thunderpool is unsophisticated yet amazing. It was likely created at the same time as the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. However, there are some differences compared to today's immortal foundations."

She extended her hand, summoning purple thunder that coalesced into a deep purple rune. It shimmered with a radiant purple light, bobbing lightly above her palm.

Li Qinghong had clearly expended considerable energy to form this Thunder Rune, as her face turned slightly pale. She then went on to explain, "This is the Secret Origin Profound Thunder. It's extremely effective for killing and banishing demons and can be supplemented by the thunder of heaven and earth. Combined with the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique from the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, its power is astonishing!"

"This Profound Thunder is difficult to preserve; the only way to store it is in my sea of qi's Thunder Pool using the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique. I can then unleash it during battle, catching opponents off guard and posing a significant threat."

The Profound Thunder emanated a menacing aura, making Li Wushao gulp nervously as he thought quietly to himself, When the fairy first emerged, the thunder in her hands repelled me. I assumed it was incredibly powerful, but I didn't realize she still had the Profound Thunder in reserve... In a life-and-death battle, I could easily be caught off guard and easily be killed in just two strikes.

Li Yuanjiao's eyelids twitched with excitement, and a look of delight sparkled in his eyes.

"The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique may be challenging to master, but it's worth it! With this secret technique and the methods to supplement it, it significantly enhances combat power."

Li Qinghong clasped her palms together, returning the Thunder Talisman to the Thunder Pool.

"The Profound Thunderpool also can create an altar for spellcasting, allowing communication with heaven and earth to summon heavenly thunder."

Her fine eyebrows suddenly knitted slightly as she hesitated.

"However, I've heard that heaven and earth are different now compared to ancient times, so I'm uncertain if this spell will still work..."

As they spoke, Kongheng appeared out of the blue, riding the wind with a smile on his pale face. He lowered his gaze and addressed Li Yuanjiao before the woman.

"Kongheng greets Benefactor. Congratulations on establishing your immortal foundation too, Benefactor!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded politely, while Li Qinghong responded with a quick nod.

"Master Monk, you've also made significant progress in your cultivation. Congratulations to you as well," she commended.

"Yes... yes..." Kongheng replied, lowering his gaze as he chanted a sutra under his breath diligently, excusing himself as he continued his descent.

Li Yuanjiao observed Li Qinghong's furrowed brow and explained everything to her. After listening thoughtfully, she replied, "My technique comes from Thundercloud Temple. It seems to have some origins in Liao River Temple... but I still have a lingering doubt."

Tilting his head, Li Yuanjiao prompted her to continue her train of thought.

"This Thundercloud Temple is clearly associated with ancient Buddhist cultivators, yet the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique belongs to the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao! It makes no sense that it doesn't require reciting Dao scriptures while tapping on a wooden fish."

Li Yuanjiao frowned in confusion. After contemplating for a while, he still could not find an answer and decided to note it down.

"I'll ask Kongheng about it one day," he affirmed.

Li Qinghong nodded, then descended the mountain with her brother. She then asked, "How did an extra demon general find its way to our home during my absence?"

Li Wushao, who had been hiding behind them, finally seized the opportunity to speak.

"I'm Li Wushao, a lesser demon born in the Eastern Sea. I mistakenly entered Lake Xian and was fortunate to be taken in by the master to join Qingdu..."

Li Yuanjiao's mouth twitched as he sighed and interrupted him, "Where did you learn to sugarcoat things like that? That's not what happened. The Kong Family from Profound Peak Gate requested my help to eliminate this demon. Our family happens to be in need of Foundation Establishment Realm combat power, so I asked for a suitable technique to tame it."

"I see," Li Qinghong replied with a nod.

Li Wushao chuckled awkwardly, but Li Qinghong scrutinized him and teased, "Can't you transform into someone better looking or at least one that will make others feel at ease? You don't look trustworthy right now, so you can't blame me for being cautious when I first saw you."

Both Li Yuanjiao and Li Wushao paused. Li Yuanjiao shook his head helplessly at his sister's teasing smile.

"Do you have to always make fun of me?" he sighed.

Li Qinghong grabbed him, her eyes sparkling with excitement as she urged, "Come on, let's spar!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded, and the two of them soared into the air. Li Qinghong, not in a hurry to draw her spear, summoned a purple thunderstorm in the middle of her palm. With a flick of her wrist, a brilliant purple light surged forth.

A grayish-green serpent dragon coiled around Li Yuanjiao. Since his cultivation progress had improved in recent years, the serpent dragon looked even more vivid and fierce this time, its claws and fangs bared as its scales shimmered. With a roar, it leaped into action.

Boom!

The purple thunder struck the serpent dragon, causing it to roar in pain. Deep green water splashed down like rain, drenching their surroundings. Li Yuanjiao then advanced, wielding his sword under the protection of his immortal foundation.

The Jing Dragon King was unique; not only did it possess strong true essence, but it could also control water. When combined, it formed a water serpent dragon; and when separated, it transformed into snakes, shrimps, crabs, turtles, swords, axes, and halberds. This meant Li Yuanjiao did not need to bear the brunt of Li Qinghong's thunder, as he could simply leap away.

Despite his slight advantage with his immortal foundation, Li Yuanjiao did not let his guard down, and treated it as though he were facing a formidable opponent.

Others might underestimate his sister, thinking that getting close to a thunder cultivator like her would force her to defend herself and refrain from casting spells. However, Li Yuanjiao knew better. He had not seen Li Qinghong's spear skills in years now, and he was uncertain of her current prowess.

Sure enough, Li Qinghong smiled and drew her Duruo Spear. A pale purple light erupted from it as she thrust it fiercely forward at the speed of lightning. The spear turned into a blur, darting toward him successively like birds.

Clang!

Li Yuanjiao unleashed a dazzling green-white sword light. However, instead of clashing directly with him, Li Qinghong pivoted, using a deflection to redirect the force. She spun her spear and struck heavily to the side.

Oh no, she has read our family's sword techniques before and is very familiar with the Celestial Moon Slash technique!

Li Qinghong's talent with weapons far surpassed Li Yuanjiao's. With a thrust, a lift, and a swing, the purple lightning scattered. Li Qinghong retreated quite a distance but her pale purple spear shadow moved in direction, attacking Li Yuanjiao relentlessly.

Years of training had refined her skills. No longer limited to the Wing Clipper Spear Technique and Dragon Reflection, she wielded both spear techniques and spear energy with ease. Understanding that Li Yuanjiao relied heavily on a single, powerful sword strike, she closed the distance.

Li Yuanjiao's vulnerabilities were becoming evident. He struggled to keep up, using only his sword qi defensively. With each of Li Qinghong's attacks, the pressure intensified, forcing him to retreat.

His expression darkened as the sword light in his hand flowed like water, splitting into three pure white streams of light—sharp and agile.

"Threefold Moonlight!" he yelled out fiercely.

The three sword qi condensed, moving autonomously like spirits, each glowing with a bright white light. Li Qinghong recognized the technique and a grin broke out across her face as she twirled her spear in excitement.

"Brother, you've mastered it!" she exclaimed.

Li Yuanjiao did not respond. Instead, he seized the moment to sheath his sword, then drew it again to execute another Celestial Moon Slash technique. Li Qinghong danced with her spear to defend herself, but the three streams of light flowed and flew toward her forehead.

Her eyes ignited a fierce purple as the spear in her hand crackled with silver-white and dark purple lightning, roaring violently through the air. With a sweeping motion, she struck out, shattering the sword light before her.

Two pure white sword lights sprang from the rising lightning, landing on her wrist before abruptly dispersing.

"If you keep fighting, you'll bleed!" Li Yuanjiao warned with a smile.

Li Qinghong lowered her weapon, sighing with some regret.

"I've underestimated the Law of Celestial Moon! I guess it's impossible to overcome a Grade Five sword technique with brute force!"

"No need to be so modest, Qinghong. You might have been able to withstand those two sword lights. I've only just mastered it, but my strength has increased significantly. If you had returned a month earlier, I doubt I would have been able to hurt you at all," Li Yuanjiao replied, shaking his head.

"This time I got lucky. If you had unleashed the profound thunder as soon as you arrived or used the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique when I approached, I would have been in serious trouble. I would be injured before the fight even started and wouldn't even stand a chance against you," he added.

Li Qinghong put away her spear, offering a respectful bow.

"In the past, I was able to focus on practicing secret techniques and spearmanship because Brother Ping and you managed the household... Now that I've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, I can share your burden!"

"It's great that you feel this way, but we can still manage for the next few years," Li Yuanjiao replied, looking at her warmly.

"Perhaps you can look into the Blood Sun Fruit and... spend more time with Brother Ping," he suggested.

Li Qinghong bowed her head silently and responded with a soft hum, understanding her brother's unspoken concern.

Suddenly, someone approached, announcing respectfully, "Report to the ancestor, we have news from the desert in the west!"

"From Uncle?"

It was rare for Chen Donghe to bring news, and Li Yuanjiao quickly calculated the time. Realizing that it had not been long enough for Chen Donghe to finish gathering a portion of Golden Yang Radiant Origin spiritual qi, he felt a sudden unease in his chest.

Sure enough, the man bowed again and continued, "It's news about a death..."

————

Smoke Valley Temple.

The weather in the desert was perpetually dry. Chen Donghe had been living here for over ten years now and had long grown accustomed to it. One early morning, he called out softly, but there was no response.

His keen eyesight as a Qi Cultivator allowed him to see the frail figure of the old woman even in the dim light—seemingly lifeless, like a pile of firewood on the bed.

He stood frozen for a moment in silence.

"I suppose it's time to go home..." he murmured quietly to himself.

He gathered his belongings from the table and the wall, storing them in his storage pouch.

Carefully, he lifted Li Jingtian from the bed and stepped out into the yard. The sand scorched his feet, and he recalled how Li Jingtian always wanted to be carried.

"It's pretty cloudy today. It's rare to get such good weather in the desert... What a pity."

As he carried her on his back, he thought of how Li Jingtian had longed for a place with more rain, only to have passed away during the night in this barren landscape of yellow sand.

"Fellow Daoist Donghe!"

Bai Yinzi, the master of Smoke Valley Temple, had come to see him off. The man had tears glistening in his eyes as he whispered softly, "My condolences... My condolences..."

Chen Donghe maintained a stoic expression as he bid farewell to everyone. The cultivators of Smoke Valley looked at him with sorrowful pity, and he offered polite nods in return, carrying his wife on his back as he made his way through the wind.

It took several days to traverse the desert. Chen Donghe stopped midway to wipe the dew from Li Jingtian's face. Her skin felt stiff where he touched it, as hard as cowhide, and even frostbitten. She looked terrible.

Li Jingtian had been gone for a long time, yet no one had noticed.

Chen Donghe had ventured out during the evening, hoping to gather energy at sunset, but he had missed her critical moment. When he returned, he found her clutching the sheets at the edge of the bed, with a pained look on her face yet already devoid of breath.

Tian'er...

While Chen Donghe was lost in thought, he found himself at Mount Xiping. The earth veins here were thin, and the spiritual energy felt cut off. Although clouds and mist enveloped the mountain, and the sunset glow painted the sky beautifully, it was ultimately just an ordinary mountain.

No one would choose to linger in such a place. No matter how steep and towering Mount Xiping stood, how it blocked the southeast water veins and shaped the Smoke Valley Desert with its presence, it remained unrecorded and overlooked.

However, Li Jingtian loved this mountain.

Chen Donghe landed on the mountain and navigated it with familiarity, pushing aside the bushes and trees on the summit. There, he found two small black rocks and engraved them, making them into two stone tablets. They stood out remarkably against the mist and moisture of the mountain fog. Tilting his head, he gazed down at the endless sea of clouds and fog swirling beneath him.

From this vantage point, he could see the entirety of Moongaze Lake, several renowned immortal mountains, and even Mount Lijing and Mount Qingdu, looming hazily in the distance.

This was a spot Li Jingtian often visited, but the long journey back and forth took several days, and Chen Donghe could not always find the time to accompany her. Every visit brought her immense joy as if they were celebrating a festival together.

He gently laid her down on one of the stone platforms, exhaling softly, and leaned back against the stone wall wearily. Resting her head on his shoulder, they both stared into the distance in silence.

The wind howled around them, and the mountain felt cold and lonely today. Chen Donghe had always been quiet. He never spoke unless Li Jingtian did.

In the distance, the vast white clouds gradually transformed into a golden and red ocean under the morning glow, rolling and surging into various shapes.

The clouds flowed from afar, and the dark cliffs began to vanish into the whiteness, along with a pale, stiff corpse and an old man.

Sob...

A cry broke the silence, echoing from the boundless white clouds.

It was the heart-wrenching wail of an old man, choked with grief.
