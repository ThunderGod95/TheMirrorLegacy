# Chapter 943: The Wounds That Breed Hatred

Rain fell from the churning clouds over Shanji Prefecture. A woman in purple robes hovered in the air, one hand forming an incantation seal while the other held a pale, greyish-white gourd. As she chanted, torrents of azure and blue flame coiled around her, swirling like a pack of savage Flood Dragons.

On the opposing side, black smoke billowed and converged. A blood-red radiance slashed across the horizon, a crimson longsword piercing the air to strike the surging conflagration. It was instantly repelled by the overwhelming power of the Immeasurable Water and Fire, shattering into plumes of dark mist.

Amidst the demonic smoke stood the Helian family's genius, a four-eyed demonic cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm. A bloody light pulsed from his eyes, and his face was split in a wide, eager grin.

"The Supreme Minister's Gourd truly lives up to its reputation!"

The purple-robed woman within the flames ignored him. Her beautiful eyes shifted, focusing intently on a spot within the mists. A middle-aged man stood there, possessing striking features with a high-bridged nose and deep-set eyes. He was turned slightly to the side, revealing the glowing longsword, short blade, and whip hanging at his waist.

'Helian Wujiang!'

This mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master wasn't renowned for his combat prowess. His cultivation path was completely unlike Helian Wumeng's Heavenly Embryo Dao; he followed the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao.

'His Dao-Profundity is far greater than Helian Wumeng's. The Helian family's rise is largely thanks to him. He almost single-handedly pulled the Tiefu Kingdom from the brink, which is the only reason Helian Wumeng is even alive today.'

'This man doesn't focus on spell arts, artifact crafting, or alchemy. He is singularly devoted to increasing his Dao-Profundity.'

Tinglan knew this path well; two of the seniors from her own Purple Smoke Gate were masters of it.

This type of Daoist Master commands a wider range of divine ability transformations and possesses a more comprehensive set of skills. They are often the ones capable of reincarnation, or of developing new variations based on their unique Dao Lineage.

Therefore, while he might not unleash any devastating spell arts himself, he could undoubtedly counter her own. With the ferocious, wide-open brawler Helian Wumeng on the attack, and a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert of profound Dao-Profundity watching coldly from the sidelines... this was an incredibly dangerous situation.

But the middle-aged man in the clouds made no move. His deep-set eyes gazed from afar, fixed on the small, grey-white gourd within the roaring flames. He sighed inwardly with admiration.

'Zimu's Supreme Minister's Gourd... Such an exquisite method!'

As a fellow cultivator who specialized in divine abilities and the study of Dao-Profundity, his gaze lingered for a few extra breaths. He turned his head slightly, watching Helian Wumeng pounce fiercely through the air.

He condensed his divine ability into a thin line, sending a silent message:

"The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition still has power in reserve. Houfu's location is unknown, and there may even be a Great Daoist Master who hasn't yet shown their hand. Do not be reckless. Follow the plan and just tie her down. If she pins you with a Spiritual Artifact and reinforcements arrive, we will be in mortal danger!"

Helian Wumeng looked like he was thoroughly enjoying the fight, all while constantly analyzing his opponent's spell arts. But despite his gleeful expression, he was no fool. He gave a silent acknowledgement.

The sky was growing dim. Helian Wujiang's brow furrowed slightly as a jade pendant in his hand flashed. At that exact moment, a clear beam of light shot across the river, and a voice called out, "Is that Daoist friend Tinglan?"

Helian Wujiang and Helian Wumeng exchanged a look. They immediately turned and stepped into the Great Void.

The two foreign Purple Mansion Realm cultivators paused in the Great Void, not leaving immediately. Helian Wumeng stowed his long-handled blade, looking somewhat sullen. He forced a smile at the man beside him.

"This is dull. It's nothing like the Great Desert. Out there, you kill or you die. If you can't win, you flee, heal up for a few years, and try again. The South... it's just so lukewarm."

"The South is stable. The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is all one family; it's not comparable," Helian Wujiang replied calmly, his voice tinged with melancholy. "We're being prodded into action on this river, but we must not become a weapon in someone else's hands. After our family's lineage was broken, we struggled through hardship to get where we are today. We absolutely cannot afford a setback."

He lowered his voice. "However... it was good that you didn't mention the Profound Qi Art. That belongs to the Touba family. They've always been well-protected, and on top of that, a new genius emerged from their ranks a few years ago. The King of Dai is in his prime, just one step away from mastering the Five Methods, and he's a close friend of Daoist Master Chiguang. This is a critical time. We absolutely cannot afford to offend them."

"Everyone knows there's something wrong with that art, but _who_ says so... that carries a very different meaning. Forget youeven those few Merciful Ones in Jiangbei... has a single one of them dared to speak up?"

"Don't be fooled. Murong Yan may look like a brute, and Shilou Yingge is insufferably arrogant, but neither of them will breathe a single word about it."

"I understand, Uncle." Helian Wumeng pondered for a moment. "Could it have come from Tuoba Chongyuan? When the Second Young Master died suddenly in the South all those years ago, it caused a huge uproar across the Mobei. I heard he was killed by Dongfang Heyun. If Dongfang Heyun killed him, could he have obtained one or two of his spell arts or techniques? And could they have passed to someone else?"

"It's possible." Helian Wujiang's expression was grave as he shook his head. "Although Emperor Wu of Liang admired the laws of Great Wei and held the Wei Emperor in high regard, things have progressed too far. The Touba family can no longer have any involvement with the Li clan."

"Even if, for the sake of argument, they were providing secret aid, there would be no reason to use such an obvious calling card. The machinations at play here are deep. You and I must not get involved."

His eyes were dark, simmering with a profound hatred. "We just need to wait for our chance," he hissed, his voice low. "The powers that besieged our Lord... we will skin them alive and eat their flesh. Only then can we appease our Lord's spirit in heaven!"

Hatred was clear on Helian Wumeng's face, though it lacked the deep-seated venom of his uncle's. Though he was the impulsive one, he now clasped his hands and ground out through his teeth, "We will endure for now... but we will make them pay."

---

Having made their decision, the uncle and nephew duo turned and flew north. Back over Shanji Prefecture, the great flames finally subsided, retreating into the small, grey-white gourd. Daoist Master Tinglan descended on the wind, moving to greet the beam of clear light arriving from the river.

The light resolved into an old man with a full head of white hair, leaning on a wooden staff. He stopped in the prefecture and clasped his hands in greeting. Though Tinglan was clearly weighed down by worry, she forced a smile. "Senior Shanbai! Thank you for coming."

This was Daoist Master Shanbai, a rogue cultivator from the coast. He looked slightly awkward as he replied, "I was waiting on the river for a good while. When I saw someone crossing, I thought I'd lend a hand."

Tinglan silently checked the jade pendant in her sleeve. It was no longer flashing, which meant the situation at Moongaze Lake had also been resolved. She let out a quiet sigh of relief and smiled. "Please, this way."

Daoist Master Shanbai had always been on good terms with both Purple Smoke and Xiukui. However, his territory by the sea was near the Xiuyue Mountain Gate, placing him, strictly speaking, under Xiuyue's jurisdiction. Houfu and the others, aware of this, had never pressed him for help. He, in turn, had tactfully spent all these years in "seclusion" to avoid the issue.

Now, with a lull in the conflict between north and south, the two sides were locked in a stalemate, and the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition had barely enough power to defend the river. Daoist Master Shanbai had finally decided to stop waiting. He'd used "coming out of seclusion" as an excuse to visit... naturally, he was here to assess Zhu Gong's injuries.

The two entered the array. The mountainside was still in disarray, with order only barely maintained. Daoist Master Shanbai was a fastidious man; he frowned immediately at the sight and shook his head. "Zhu Gong's subordinates are Eastern Sea demonic cultivators, after all. They're useless! Look at these new disciples they've recruited. What have they been taught? How can you call this a proper Dao Lineage? Is her heart even in this..."

Tinglan was respectful toward the old Daoist Masterfar more so than she had been with Daoist Master Sumianand her words were candid. She sighed. "She has a free-spirited nature. In her eyes, managing all this is a waste of time she could be spending on her divine abilities. If the Dao Lineage wasn't in danger of failing, and if she didn't need Jiangnan's treasures, she wouldn't bother with any of this."

Shanbai just shook his head. "How does she justify it? The Secret Diffusion affair is over. Does she think she didn't get enough Mihua Spirit Elixir? Does she want to take more from you? Or is she still hoping for the Elucidation of Chongyuan's Supplemental Law? That's a pipe dream."

The Mihua Spirit Elixir was famous. It was an incredibly potent elixir from the Secret Diffusion Daoist Tradition, capable of washing away impurities, shoring up one's foundation, and granting immense benefits to cultivators of Earth Virtue and Metal Virtue. Though Shanbai hadn't known Zhu Gong's motive before, the situation had since become clear.

But at his words, Tinglan was unable to answer. She silently lowered her eyes.

Only Tinglan knew the truth. The South hadn't gained a single extra benefit from the Secret Diffusion affair; what they appeared to get was all they got. They hadn't seen so much as a shadow of the Mihua Spirit Elixir! As for the Elucidation of Chongyuan's Supplemental Law, it was completely missing. Everyone knew it was in the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, so one by one, they all came to suspect the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. It was a silent, bitter grievance. Shanbai was rightZhu Gong truly did covet those things.

She quickly composed her expression and offered a tactful smile. "Senior, you worry too much. Sister Zhu Gong is after the Three-Inch Earthen Core from the Great Xiukui Monastery. As for the Mihua Spirit Elixir... we do not possess any."

Shanbai nodded, stroking his beard. It was impossible to tell if he believed her. The old man simply sighed. "How many come to hate their afflictions, how many families perish seeking the Dao. Are the waves of the Vermillion Sea not yet treacherous enough? Why must you walk through fire?"

Tinglan turned her head slightly. Her usually delicate, smiling face was now completely serious, revealing an iron-clad resolve. "To plant a golden lotus in the flames, why should one spare their own life-mandate?"

The old man stared, stunned for a moment. He suddenly realized that while Tinglan was gentle, she was friends with the radical, reckless, demonic-cultivator-born Zhu Gong. The two of them, it seemed, had something fundamental in common after all.

He sighed and fell silent. They continued to the deepest part of the cave residence. The surroundings grew darker and more desolate, with no attendants to be seen. The disciple leading them was visibly trembling. Tinglan stopped before the chamber door and called out tentatively, "Daoist friend Zhu Gong?"

"Ah... Tinglan."

A voice answered from within, faint and ethereal, echoing in the empty chamber. A gust of warm air rushed out, carrying a few scattered red petals that tumbled to Tinglan's feet.

The petals were a delicate red, but they were riddled with small holes, as if something had gnawed on them, leaving them in a sorry state. Zhu Gong's voice suddenly grew urgent. "Is the old Daoist Master here? Thank you, thank you both, my benefactors!"

Daoist Master Shanbai's expression changed. He looked up, his pupils narrowing. He heard a _shasha_ sound, like the earth itself cracking like porcelain, accompanied by the rustling of countless small things crawling. The old man formed a seal for a divine ability, made a quick calculation, and frowned. "When was she also struck by a Veiled Yin injury?"

The old man sighed. "This is disastrous!"

If Daoist Master Shanbai could see it, Tinglan was not far behind. She froze, a flicker of guilt in her eyes. "I'm afraid... she was hit by a stray beam from Wei Xuanyin's dharma artifact," she whispered. "Veiled Yin lies dormant before erupting. This is... this is difficult to treat."

"Please, old Daoist Master, stabilize her injuries first. I will go find Zhaojing and bring him here."

**Tiger's Frontier Mountain, Kuidu Palace.**

_Clang... Clang..._

The drawn-out ring of metal on metal echoed endlessly through Kuidu Palace. The sound waves overlapped in the vast, sealed hall, sometimes slow and resonant as a temple bell, sometimes fast and sharp as a smith's hammer, ringing without cease.

A purplish-black alchemy cauldron stood in the very center, vibrating unstably. It was as if something was sealed within, and its every violent struggle caused motes of golden light to flare.

'What a spirited creature...' Li Ximing's face was pale. An excessive amount of divine ability and dharma power poured from him into the cauldron, relentlessly intensifying the True Fire in an attempt to forcibly refine the thing inside.

This pill was unlike any he had ever refined. The initial stages had been simple, and Li Ximing had proceeded with practiced ease. But the moment the Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat and the Non-Falling Golden Cloud merged, the situation in the cauldron changed instantly. The pill had come to life.

The raging True Fire had burned beneath the cauldron day and night for four months, yet the thing inside only grew more stubborn. It had long since begun to shudder like a living creature, leaping and thrashing in a frenzy, desperately trying to escape.

'And every single moment of its struggle drains a sea of my divine ability and dharma power... If the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron weren't a Purple Mansion Realm Spiritual Artifact, completely immune to the pill's impacts and requiring no effort to stabilize, this refinement would have failed long ago!'

'The pill scripture didn't mention this at all! The power of these two spiritual items combined is terrifying. Forget the old River-Center Cauldron... even the Treasure Elephant Cauldron wouldn't have been able to withstand this for long!'

He cursed Fuxun internally, guessing the demon king probably hadn't known this would happen either. 'Instead, the scripture just mentioned various _other_ adversities: unstable Spiritual Qi, poor harmonization of ingredients, clashes between the flame and the Spiritual Qi... I went through all of those. Thankfully, I'm experienced, and I had the help of the noble from the Azure Manifestation Dao, so I navigated them smoothly.'

'Add in this insane drain of divine ability and dharma power... It's lucky he found me. Anyone else would have ruined his entire batch of pills by now.'

Fortunately, after nearly four monthsone hundred and eight days of refiningthe creature finally reached its breaking point. After one last wave of convulsions, the two spiritual ingredients ceased their resistance, and the entire cauldron fell silent.

Li Ximing finally relaxed. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire blazed, illuminating the entire hall. But then he heard a low, hoarse, mournful cry.

"Second Uncle... Second Uncle..."

It was the Demon King, Qingyan. His eyes were red, and he was overcome with emotion, tears streaming down his face. His hands were clenched into fists, pressed so tightly against his legs that he was sobbing, unable to speak.

"Fuxun... Fuxun... If he takes this pill and still cannot cultivate, how can he ever face returning to Three Delusions Mountain!"

Li Ximing hadn't expected such a violent reaction. Qingyan must have known this elder as well. He paused in silence for a moment, then the True Fire in his hands blazed even more fiercely.

Golden and red light flashed, burning the Demon King's face bright red in the firelight, his tears drying instantly.
