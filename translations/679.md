# Chapter 679: Departure

By the time Kongheng descended on the wind back to Mount Qingdu, the sky had completely darkened. Li Xuanxuan was waiting in the main hall, the old man’s spirit still unsettled, not yet recovered from the terrifying vision he had witnessed.

When Kongheng and Li Ximing landed safely, Li Xuanxuan hurried to greet them. Seeing them both unharmed brought a flicker of joy to his face, but as he looked from one to the other—at Li Ximing’s wistful expression and Kongheng’s complicated one—his relief faded.

“What is…?”

“Venerable Elder.”

Kongheng placed his palms together and bowed respectfully. “This humble monk is about to depart,” he said in his gentle voice. “I will travel through the prefectures, leave Jiangnan, and journey to other lands.”

“What!” Li Xuanxuan was stunned. “Have we offended you in some way, Master Monk?” he asked urgently. “We’ve been together for decades…”

The old man’s thoughts raced. “That monk, Fu Xia, was spouting nonsense. He was almost certainly targeting our family! You mustn't take it to heart, Kongheng.”

As Li Xuanxuan spoke, Kongheng simply held his hands together in a bow. “Venerable Elder, you have a fortunate countenance,” he said softly. “The first half of your life was fraught with hardship, but few trials remain ahead. It is best to worry less.”

Li Xuanxuan had no reply to that and could only nod.

“I have long considered Zhouwei’s situation,” Kongheng continued. “I originally thought we would have to trouble someone to purchase a Supreme Yin spiritual object from overseas, as they are exceedingly rare. Fortunately, I heard your clan has acquired a Supreme Yin Dharma artifact, which will serve perfectly.”

He retrieved a manuscript from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing. The pages were filled with meticulously handwritten characters, as small and neat as flies’ heads, clearly penned by the monk himself.

“Follow the methods in this book,” Kongheng instructed. “It will protect the mother and suppress the child’s spiritual nature, preventing it from being overwhelmed by the Bright Yang.”

Li Ximing was deeply moved and accepted the manuscript.

“However,” Kongheng added apologetically, “since I cannot perform the ritual myself, it will be difficult to grasp the precise balance of power. Too much Supreme Yin can cause its own problems. You must all be exceedingly careful and proceed with caution.”

“We will!” Li Ximing promised.

The monk bid farewell to Li Xuanxuan and made his way out, following the stone steps down to the halfway point of the mountain. The deer was lying numbly by the path, watching them quietly.

Kongheng paused. “He should not have done this to you,” he sighed.

With that, he took out the White Jade Demon-Subduing Staff.

In the moonlight, the treasured artifact had shrunk to the length of a forearm and the thickness of a finger. It gleamed brightly, its intricate patterns faintly visible on the surface.

“Now I have no choice but to make a trip to the north,” Kongheng lamented. “These items must be returned to the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple. The staff and the Mysterious Tiger-Stripe Kasaya are precious, and the sarira must be enshrined in a pagoda.”

Li Ximing had expected as much. ‘That old monk was cunning after all,’ he thought with a bitter heart. ‘He used every trick in the book, even sacrificing his own life, to force Kongheng to travel north. An ancient cultivator like Kongheng is a significant figure. He might survive the journey, but it’s doubtful his lineage will remain intact.’

The artifact was truly formidable. Merely holding it out caused waves of five-colored light to ripple across its surface. Li Ximing took a closer look, mentally calculating its power. ‘This is definitely not for the Foundation Establishment Realm. It’s at least equivalent to a Purple Mansion spiritual artifact. Three such items… they truly spared no expense.’

Kongheng lightly tapped the deer’s head with the staff. “Your crime did not merit this. You should be freed.”

The deer let out a whimper and thrashed on the ground. Its fur fell away like leaves in the wind, revealing a bloody, human form that rolled out from the mess.

The man’s face was smeared with deer blood. He looked dazed as he bowed. “Thank you, Master Monk.”

Kongheng draped a robe over him. “The dead cannot be brought back to life,” he said softly. “You must learn to accept your grief.”

The man lowered his head, his expression lost. “I have known only hardship since I was a child,” he mumbled. “Always hungry, always cold. I grew into a man with nothing to my name. My wife traveled a thousand miles to marry me, and we shared everything. Now she has been wrongly killed… I have nothing left to live for.”

Kongheng looked down at him. His mind-reading ability told him the man’s will to live was gone. He turned his head away.

‘If I had accepted the Pure Land’s call and embraced that karmic destiny, not only would this man have become a deer-bodied Arhat, but his wife might have been reborn in the Buddhist lands.’

Fortunately, the man was from Jiangnan, not from the lands where Buddhism held sway. If he had known more about the doctrine, he might have blamed Kongheng. As it was, having been both harmed and saved by the monk, he was merely confused.

Kongheng sighed gently. “Why not follow me north?” he offered. “You can seek answers from the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple as well.”

The man paused, a flicker of resentment in his eyes, but he nodded. His black hair fell out in clumps. He put on the offered robes and silently fell in line behind Kongheng.

Li Ximing watched this unfold with a nod of his own. He escorted them to the lakeshore. The night was deep, and the bank was silent and deserted, the only sound the soft crunch of their feet on the sand.

“You have come far enough, Ximing,” Kongheng said, pressing his palms together and urging him to return.

Li Ximing stopped and looked at him for a long moment, a sudden realization dawning on him. ‘With Kongheng’s departure, of those from my generation, I am the only one left.’

“Master Monk,” he said softly, “if you ever pass by Moongaze Lake again, please stop and rest. It would be my honor to host you. But perhaps by then, I will have failed and perished. Things will have changed, and this land may no longer bear the name Li.”

A faint smile touched Li Ximing’s lips, and his usual, slightly anxious demeanor shifted. “When that time comes,” he said with an air of self-possession, “do not perform last rites for me. Let me be utterly gone.”

“I would have no face to meet my ancestors, my father, or my elders.”

Kongheng placed his hands together in prayer and sighed, but said nothing more. With a final farewell, he departed. Li Ximing watched as the two figures walked away under the moonlight, eventually disappearing into the northern woods, before finally riding the wind back up the mountain.

His progress in the Jewel Steps realm was agonizingly slow. This brief emergence from his seclusion had caused little stir, as he had made scant progress—no more than ten or twenty percent of the way through his studies.

‘I fear even ten years may not be enough,’ he thought, his heart heavy as he landed back on his peak.

### The Eastern Sea

On the back of the Azurewater Scaled-Beast, among the cluster of palaces, lay a wide-open plaza. A high, azure platform stood at one end, set with three jade tables. Dingjiao sat at the head.

Below, two massive water beasts were locked in a vicious battle. One was a water elephant with thick, snow-white scales and long, sharp tusks. The other was a long-tailed, single-horned serpent, the horn on its brow glowing with a brilliant light.

The horn’s pale blue radiance cast a hazy mist before it. The water elephant thrashed and rolled, blood gushing from its eyes like springs, flowing down its scales and transforming into pearls as they hit the ground.

“Minghuang!”

Dingjiao’s majestic voice pulled Li Zhouwei’s attention back. The Dragon Prince was leaning against a seat of jade and coral, its armrests carved into the shape of two pristine white hook-serpent heads.

“What do you think of this profound light?”

Li Zhouwei set down his jade cup. “This Converging Water Profound Light is a fourth-grade art,” he noted, “but it excels in illusion and lacks killing power. Its myriad transformations can easily dazzle an opponent, but they cannot inflict lethal harm. In a one-on-one fight, it would struggle against a foe skilled in defense.”

Dingjiao nodded in agreement. Below, the two beasts fought to the death, but the Dragon Prince watched with a detached air, his pale blue eyes unfocused as he sipped his wine, his mind clearly elsewhere.

Li Zhouwei had been in the palace for some time. The Azurewater Scaled-Beast had already completed a full tour of the Vermillion Sea. Dingjiao, having tired of music and dance, had ordered the water beasts to fight for their entertainment.

Li Zhouwei had learned from a nearby demon attendant that the beasts were a Jewel-Scaled Ferry-Beast and an Azure-Necked Flood Dragon—neither was an ordinary creature. Either one could dominate a stretch of water on its own.

His own Wushao, meanwhile, wouldn't even have a chance to take the stage in the Eastern Sea. Only beasts like Lingu Lanying's White-Scaled Hook-Serpent or the Whole Pill Water Ape from the Converging Water Sea would have such an opportunity.

‘But before a True Dragon,’ Li Zhouwei reflected, ‘they are nothing more than playthings.’

He watched for a moment longer. As the Converging Water Profound Light gradually weakened, the Jewel-Scaled Ferry-Beast began to counterattack. Though he found the sight of such creatures fighting intriguing, his mind was preoccupied.

‘I wonder what has happened at the lake. Why have they kept me here for so long?’

His business in the Southern Sea had been concluded long ago, and he should have left. Yet Dingjiao and Bai Rong had insisted on taking him on a tour of the sea. The journey had been uneventful; it was clear they simply wanted to delay his return.

Though worried, Li Zhouwei could do nothing about it and had resigned himself to the situation. Just as he was lost in thought, a demon in silver armor with a gold mask and silver fangs hurried up the palace corridor. He carried two short halberds on his back and was clearly no ordinary soldier.

The demon approached Dingjiao’s high seat and seemed to whisper something using a secret technique. Dongfang Dingjiao’s hand, holding the jade cup, froze in mid-air, though his expression remained unchanged.

A moment later, the demon general bowed and departed. Dingjiao resumed his casual posture. Across from him, Bai Rong was clearly growing weary of the spectacle. He finally stood up with a smile.

“This has been a most pleasant conversation, but I cannot be away from my mountain for too long. I mustn’t impose on Your Highness any further.”

Dingjiao rose, exchanged a few pleasantries, and escorted them out of the hall. As they passed through the corridor, the two demon generals were still locked in a life-or-death struggle, their blood spattering and turning to pearls in mid-air, rolling to Dingjiao’s feet unnoticed.

After seeing them off, Dingjiao returned to the platform alone, the smile vanishing from his face.

The armored demon had obviously brought bad news. Dingjiao’s deep composure had allowed him to remain perfectly at ease in front of his guests, but the moment they were gone, his expression turned grim.

The Dragon Prince’s white horns began to glow faintly. He stood in silence, leaning on the azure railing, staring down at the two generals—demons who stood above tens of thousands of their kind—as they tore each other apart.

Though the esteemed guests had left, Dingjiao had not spoken, so the two creatures dared not slacken their efforts. They fought until their scales were shattered and their horns broken, the ground littered with dripping blood and rolling pearls.

Still, Dingjiao said nothing. He narrowed his pale blue eyes, and a suffocating tension filled the hall. It was obvious to anyone that the White Dragon Prince was in a foul mood. The guards on either side began to tremble, not daring to look up.

After a full quarter of an hour, a demon general with bulging gills and black armor could bear it no longer. He knelt down, trembling with fear, and said respectfully, “Your Highness, the Dragon Monarch’s birthday has just passed. It would be… inauspicious for high-ranking demons to die in a duel.”

This general, Ranwu, had served Dingjiao for many years and was no ordinary subordinate. At this moment, with the prince’s anger palpable, he was the only one in the hall who dared to speak.

Dingjiao didn’t answer. With a dark face, he turned and strode back into the hall, the doors slamming shut behind him with a boom.

The demon general felt as if a death sentence had been lifted. Terrified, he silently waved his hands frantically. The two combatants below immediately ceased their fight, kowtowed several times toward the main hall, and scrambled away.

Outside, a wave of relief washed over the attendants. Inside, the hall was empty, silent, and gloomy, lit only by the faint glow of lamps.

Dingjiao walked all the way to his high seat, then with a sudden sweep of his sleeve, sent a cascade of jade pots and cups crashing to the floor with a series of sharp, clear clinks.

His face abruptly elongated, revealing rows of sharp, white fangs. Snowy-white dragon whiskers sprouted from his neck, and the color of his eyes deepened intensely. The tables and chairs in the hall began to tremble and rattle.

“Mount. Luo. Xia!”

He ground out the name, his voice like thunder, yet it was trapped within the hall, echoing off the walls and making everything vibrate.

***

Once they were clear of the sea’s surface, where the Azurewater Scaled-Beast waited in the shallows, Bai Rong’s reason for leaving became clear. He produced his two-wheeled chariot, flopped onto it with a groan, and sighed.

“Gods, that was exhausting!”

All the elegance and composure he had displayed were thrown to the winds. He reverted to his lazy, slovenly self, his feet dangling over the side of the cart as he whined and refused to even steer the artifact.

After so long under the sea, Li Zhouwei found the fresh scent of the sea breeze incredibly refreshing. With Bai Rong on strike, he had no choice but to pilot the chariot westward, back toward the mainland.

Bai Rong lay there for some time, only stirring when they reached the salt lake. “Careful, slow down,” he mumbled, before adding with a laugh, “Life as a dragon is just that boring. They can’t wander around human territory, and no matter how much trouble the sea demons get into, it’s never as interesting as what humans come up with. That dueling spectacle… humans were bored of that back in the Zhou Dynasty! I was about to die of boredom.”

Li Zhouwei grunted in acknowledgment, offered a few words of praise for Dingjiao, and then asked softly, “A lot must have happened at my family’s lake while we were gone. Do you have any news, senior?”

He was worried about his family and had been rushing back, but Bai Rong had advised him to slow down, which suggested the problem wasn’t critical. Now was his chance to get answers from the fox.

Bai Rong paused for a moment. “Nothing much,” he said with a smile. “A Merciful One from the Way of Wrath saw an opportunity and came sniffing around to drive away your family’s monk. If you had been at the lake, the other cultivators would have been delighted to get a measure of your true power.”

The fox didn’t bother with pretense. He gazed at the distant sea view, his tone calm. “You have to understand, Bright Yang isn’t just a power that allowed Buddhist cultivators to topple an immortal dynasty. There was also a Bright Yang Buddhist figure, the Undefeated King of Brightness!”

“If that monk had truly accepted the Way of Wrath and its karmic path, with you present at the lake, it would have been a perfect reenactment of the old tale. They would have dragged you, a White Qilin, into their Pure Land to become the new Undefeated King of Brightness and packed you off to the north!”

“Oh?” Li Zhouwei pictured Kongheng’s face in his mind.

Bai Rong shook his head and chuckled. “But even a Maha couldn’t persuade him, let alone a mere Merciful One. I told you it was a minor problem. There was no need for us to get involved, and besides, it was a good precaution to take.”

Li Zhouwei thanked him softly. “So, Buddhist cultivators can also cultivate Bright Yang…” he mused.

“‘Bright Yang’ is a Fruition Attainment. It doesn’t distinguish between immortal, Buddhist, demon, or devil!” Bai Rong said, shifting to a more comfortable position. “The Undefeated King of Brightness was a creation of Buddhist methods to begin with. After Su Xikong seized the ‘Radiant Essence,’ the Buddhist lands gained their glorious light, and their cultivators gained treasured artifacts. Just imagine how wonderful it would be for them if they could also get their hands on ‘Bright Yang’…”
