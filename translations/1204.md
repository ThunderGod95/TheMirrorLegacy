# Chapter 1204: Xianyao

The sea surged, wreathed in clouds and mist. Yet upon this vast expanse of water lay a reflection, a dark and gloomy patch where no sky could be seen, shrouded in dense darkness and pierced only by an occasional ray of multicolored light.

Above the water, a mountain peak soared into the clouds, its base never touching the ground. It floated there, veiled in an illusory, multicolored light akin to a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability, hidden from the eyes of passing cultivators.

But the knowledgeable all knew this mountain was called Overlook, and it had hung suspended in the world for many years.

Riding his Li Fire, Li Jiangqian stopped here and swept his gaze about, faintly spying the shimmering radiance of the Capital Guard, and after using a divine ability to announce his presence, a plainly dressed, humble man emerged to lead him, saying:

"Please come inside, Your Highness. My master has been waiting for a long time."

Li Jiangqian nodded and stepped inside, discovering a landscape of rolling, verdant hills. Though there were no grand palaces, scattered Daoist temples dotted the mountain, lending it an air of refined elegance.

Li Jiangqian was somewhat surprised.

'This is no small place.'

The art of suspending a mountain was far more difficult than simply moving one. Without a specialized Dao lineage, it was a truly vexing task; back when Daoist Master Xiao moved Mount Xianyou, he had even needed to borrow the spiritual impetus of the Capital Guard's Dao. Thus, even though Li Jiangqian had long heard that Overlook Peak was a floating mountain, he had not expected it to be so large.

But seeing it now, the mountain far surpassed the peaks of the lake; it was a full sixty percent the size of the Milin Mountains!

"A truly extraordinary sect entrance!"

Even if this Daoist Master Xianyao was well-known among the Purple Mansion Realm rogue cultivators and possessed some foundation, this display of power seemed beyond his means, so Li Jiangqian took careful note. As the two descended upon the mountain, they were greeted by the expected sight of white mourning attire and an atmosphere of profound grief.

A young man emerged from a high hall to greet them. His face was like pale jade, and like Li Jiangqian's own sister, a vermilion dot adorned the space between his brows. His spiritual energy was profound and unpredictable, and he should have appeared otherworldly, but the deep grief on his face made him look haggard. He performed a salute and said:

"I did not expect you to arrive so quickly, fellow Daoist... please forgive our state."

He hurriedly led Li Jiangqian inside, where many disciples were kneeling and chanting scriptures before a memorial altar. In the center of the room sat a large coffin covered in faint golden, profound script. It looked dark and lusterless, but it trembled faintly, occasionally lurching violently as if something were struggling within.

As Li Jiangqian glanced aside, Cheng Qian lowered his voice and said:

"My master relied on this Overlook Peak to achieve the divine ability 'Eastern Feather Mountain,' but his powers were varied and impure, which made his death very troublesome; even the Underworld sent people, who watched until his soul dissipated before finally departing."

Bitterness filled his eyes as he spoke:

"But though his soul has scattered, his Dharma Body remains. His organs have each claimed their own consciousness and now fight amongst themselves. Since it is my master's body, I cannot bring myself to destroy it, so I could only seal them all inside this coffin and let them struggle."

Li Jiangqian adopted a look of compassion as he inwardly mused:

'It seems... he has been dead for some time.'

Li Jiangqian, of course, felt nothing. He had not come because of the Daoist Master's death—in fact, he found it rather convenient. Hiding his expression, he heaved a heavy sigh, offered incense, and put on an appearance of being burdened with sorrow. He then pulled the young Daoist Master's hand and said in a pained voice:

"When the old master visited our lake all those years ago, he offered much guidance. My elders were deeply grateful and always instructed me to show him great care... I never imagined something like this would happen."

At these words, Cheng Qian shook his head and replied:

"The old man was talkative and feared offending your lake. He simply felt that because of a past connection, there were some things he had to say. Fortunately, Senior Zhaojing was most considerate and did not hold it against him..."

Xianyao's words at the lake back then had implied that the Li family's campaign to exterminate demons across ten thousand li was ill-timed and would likely bring disaster, which had made Cheng Qian extremely anxious—the Bright Yang had always been overbearing, how could they tolerate such criticism? Once discord was sown, who would care about his good intentions!

Now that Li Jiangqian had brought it up this way, he relaxed slightly and sighed to himself:

'Thank heavens it was Daoist Master Zhaojing! Now that my master is dead, aside from Qinghu, who is a friend of the family, few are willing to visit the mountain. Yet it is the Li family who has come!'

Li Jiangqian, meanwhile, weighed every word and phrase, secretly realizing:

'A past connection... there's more he isn't saying.'

He held his questions for the moment and completed the formalities. The two then entered a side hall and sat at a table, where Cheng Qian took the lead in brewing tea. Li Jiangqian, secretly suspicious that a mere Xianyao could warrant the Underworld's intervention, offered his thanks and said:

"The Capital Guard often deals with mountain spirits, so that's not surprising... I wonder if the old master's divine abilities were simply too profound, or if there was some deeper reason that prompted the Underworld to send its agents."

Cheng Qian pursed his lips and answered:

"In ancient times, Capital Guard cultivators had more than just the path of attaining the Dao in this life; there was also a way to become a guardian of a region after death by arranging the Five Virtues. Many cultivators hoped to become Garrison Profound spirit-ghosts after death, a path which held its own wonders. Furthermore... my master's path involved a collision between 'Wu Earth' and the 'Capital Guard.' Wu Earth can subjugate all things, while the Capital Guard captures ghosts and spirits. When a ghostly being gains the authority to subjugate all things, it becomes even more tyrannical, hence this tribulation."

Li Jiangqian mulled this over for a moment, thinking it sounded similar to his sister's path of the Divine Corpse, and smiled.

"Extending one's existence after death falls under their jurisdiction? If that's the case, shouldn't the Underworld also have a say in the Mercury Transformation technique?"

Though Li Jiangqian's tone was jocular, his words had a sharp edge. As it happened, Cheng Qian was a Whole Pill cultivator and knew something of the Mercury Transformation; a flicker of unease appeared in his eyes, but he still replied:

"In this day and age, the Capital Guard is in decline and one hardly even sees ghosts, so extending one's existence after death is out of the question. Heaven and earth have changed. The lords of the Underworld were afraid he would tap into some ancient power of Wu Earth and bring disaster upon the world. After all..."

He glanced hesitantly at Li Jiangqian and continued in a low voice:

"A position in the Capital Guard was once held by a Wu Earth Golden Core cultivator. My master's elder cultivated both paths based on this precedent. That figure... is also one of the predecessors explicitly worshipped by the lords of the Underworld."

'Hm?'

Li Jiangqian had only been probing around the edges, but one sentence had unexpectedly hooked a huge fish. His attention sharpened instantly, and his heart pounded.

'I never thought... I'd hear about the origins of the Underworld from him!'

Although Mount Luoxia and the Underworld were both world-renowned, the lords of the Underworld were not as open and transparent as the powers of the north. Every Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in the world knew that Mount Luoxia hailed from one of the few great Comprehending Profoundity lineages, but the Underworld's connection to the name Encompassing Profoundity was only ever glimpsed through faint historical traces!

He appeared only slightly surprised, but he was already concentrating fully as he casually remarked:

"Was there a Dao Lineage passed down? It seems the world underestimated the old master, for him to possess such a grand Dao!"

Cheng Qian heaved a heavy sigh and said:

"A grand Dao is out of the question... I know nothing of any Dao Lineage. To be frank, fellow Daoist, this technique was taught by Bai Ziyu! All these legends were things he revealed back when he was trying to win my master's trust... why would he explain it all clearly to me? I only heard a title, the 'Profound Monarch Gongbei Xuantu Siming,' and a Daoist name, 'Shaoxu.'"

'Bai Ziyu... Yehui... he obtained the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. It all connects.'

This was the second time Li Jiangqian had heard the title of 'Profound Monarch,' but before he could inquire further, Cheng Qian continued:

"I don't understand these titles and Daoist names, but Bai Ziyu said that some people also called him Gong Xu, and that this title was so lofty as to be boundless."

'So lofty as to be boundless...'

A ripple went through Li Jiangqian's heart, and he immediately asked:

"It is my own ignorance, then. In the saying 'Wu Light of Luoxia,' hasn't the position of Wu Earth always been held by a lord of the Mount Luoxia?"

With one simple sentence, Li Jiangqian had pointed to two extremely crucial points: the specific Fruition Attainments of Mount Luoxia, and the era in which the True Monarch behind it had attained the Dao!

Cheng Qian paused for a moment before replying:

"Wu Earth is, of course, the position of the lord of Luoxia. Perhaps this other lord held an Auxiliary Position..."

Li Jiangqian knew the other man's knowledge was limited, and a cloud of doubt formed in his mind:

"'Wu Earth,' 'Heavenly Glow'... Mount Luoxia must have no small number of True Monarchs..."

Each lost in their own thoughts, the two fell silent. After a long moment, Li Jiangqian spoke:

"I never knew... that Yehui's inheritance was so precious. No wonder his ambition was so great."

Cheng Qian shrugged without answering, his expression one of long-held envy. Li Jiangqian then put aside his own thoughts and said softly:

"I heard you mention... a past connection..."

Cheng Qian fell silent for a moment, then said:

"Does Your Highness know... my family was originally from a clan in Jishui Prefecture? The place no longer goes by that name; by its location, it would now be in Baihai. My master's birth name was Lian Dong. He cultivated in that area and had an enemy he spent half his life scheming against, a man who was both foe and friend."

Doubt rose in Li Jiangqian's eyes.

"My knowledge is shallow..."

Cheng Qian shook his head.

"Actually, fellow Daoist, you do know of him. That Daoist Master's surname was Kong, his given name Yanxi."

Li Jiangqian understood at once. "Daoist Master Changxi!"

"Precisely."

Cheng Qian began to pace slowly as he spoke:

"You must know of Daoist Master Changxi's origins. When the Bright Yang patrolled the world, it destroyed his Kong Clan because of a certain youth... But what you may not know, fellow Daoist, is that this youth came from Jishui Prefecture. And among his wives and concubines was a woman named Lian Mei—my master's own sister."

"My master's enmity with Kong Changxi was forged at that very moment."

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian began to understand, and just as he expected, Cheng Qian continued in a somber voice:

"The Bright Yang's success was fully supported by the Lian family's ancestor, who even presented the clan's treasured bow to allow that prince of the Bright Yang to communicate with a secret treasury. The ancestor had a good eye but failed to grasp the larger situation. The moment the Bright Yang left, the Lian clan was immediately carved up, their fate little better than that of the Kong Clan. And because my master had received the Bright Yang prince's favor, he was captured by several Daoist Masters and forced to open that same treasury."

"It was called Yang Director Ridge, a domain once used by the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate to guard the Eastern Sea."

Li Jiangqian narrowed his eyes and nodded as the young man continued:

"Yang Director Ridge was forced out of the Great Void and completely partitioned. The assembled Daoist Masters then went their separate ways. Among them was an old Capital Guard master who had attained the Dao thanks to guidance from Sima Hu and had been friends with the Sima Family for generations. This was Senior Daoist Master Yuanxiu, whose Daoist name was Chulong. Being old and having no children or disciples of his own, he took my master in. He saw that the ruins of Yang Director Ridge still possessed some wondrous qualities, so he raised it up and renamed it Overlook."

"And that is the Overlook Peak of today!"

He smiled faintly and said softly:

"Speaking of which, my Dao has deep connections to both the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the Bright Yang imperial clan. Back then, the Supreme Yang was at its zenith, and Daoist Master Chulong took pride in offering guidance from its tradition. He hoped my master could advance further, and reflecting on the fateful offering of the bow to the Bright Yang, he gave him the name 'Xianyao.' A 'yao' is a bow decorated with mother-of-pearl, and in this case, the mother-of-pearl was, of course, the Supreme Yang."

Li Jiangqian finally understood and nodded slowly, but Cheng Qian's expression suddenly changed as he spoke in a haunted tone:

"Later, when Daoist Master Zhu Kui rose to prominence, he gravely wounded my master's master, who died from his injuries. With his dying words, he made my master finally understand—why did the Bright Yang choose the Lian clan? Why could the Lian clan's treasured bow communicate with a secret treasury? And why was my master captured and taken to open Yang Director Ridge, a place a thousand li away?"

"The Lian clan was no ordinary family. They hailed from the Six Surnames of Guanlong from the Wei era, descendants of King Baiyang!"

'The Six Surnames of Guanlong!'

Li Jiangqian had not expected this answer, nor had he anticipated the other man to be so direct. His gaze froze, fixed upon him, as realization dawned in his mind:

'What a move, using the Six Surnames... With each reincarnation, the Bright Yang must have dragged them along through its rises and falls. Even with their descendants scattered across the mainland, the Bright Yang could still pinpoint every single branch!'

'Without the Bright Yang, with the noble bloodlines of the Six Kings from their peak in the Wei era, they would at least have had a firm foothold in the major sects...'

Cheng Qian simply rose to his feet and said:

"Over the years, my master gathered a great deal of information about the Bright Yang, and through it, came to understand more and more about the youth who had once favored him... When he spoke those words to Daoist Master Zhaojing at the lake, it was not idle chatter. It came from a desire to repay a debt of gratitude!"

A ripple of emotion showed in Li Jiangqian's eyes as he said, "No wonder!"

This revelation instantly threw Li Jiangqian's carefully chosen words into disarray. He held his cup, silent for a long time, before finally speaking quietly:

"In that case, fellow Daoist Cheng Qian... what are your thoughts?"

The grief on Cheng Qian's face deepened, and his expression grew somber as he spoke:

"I am but a minor cultivator at the beck and call of the Song. What thoughts could I possibly have? I have met the Song Emperor. Overlook Peak stands by the sea, controlling several domains. Since the Song court will not enter Fenkuai, they wish to establish a protectorate here to represent their authority. This profound mountain is no longer mine to command."

"It is just that my master foresaw this situation long ago. He left me with a final instruction, saying his homeland was in Baihai. He told me to guard this mountain for ten years, and once the struggling in the coffin ceases, I am to submerge it with Converging Water and scatter the remains in Baihai..."

His face grew a shade paler, his expression complex as he said:

"At that time, I will deliver Overlook Peak to the Song court, venture onto the mainland, and seek a chance at survival!"

In that instant, Li Jiangqian saw the terror in his eyes and understood at once the source of his anxiety:

'When Liu Bai died, he was here on this mountain. He saw the true face of the Underworld with his own eyes. The Great Song has set him on this path, but it will not be responsible for his life.'

'And the Lian family's affairs will not remain secret for long. With my father on the verge of verifying the Dao, Cheng Qian lacks the power of someone like Situ Huo to truly hold the profound. Even if a protectorate is established, the position would likely not fall to a Daoist Master with but a single divine ability. Nor can he rely on Dragon-kin like the Cui family. Loyalty and gratitude are irrelevant; standing on the front line between north and south, he will become a prize in the eyes of the Buddhist cultivators—a prime target to convert or kill in their campaign against the Bright Yang.'

'Only my father needs him, and he has no choice but to rely on my father.'

He sized up the handsome young Daoist Master before him, his mind a sea of clarity:

'Very clever... whether it was because Xianyao understood long ago and warned him before his death, or because he is sharp enough to have figured it out himself, Cheng Qian is now in the same boat as my family!'
