# Chapter 767: Retreat

Guan Gongxiao clasped his hands, still confused. He lifted his head, his forehead no longer pressed to the floor, and his voice remained low.

"This junior is dull... I still do not understand. According to the reports from the surrendering Profound Peak disciples, the one in the secret chamber was Fu En. Daoist Master Zhaojing investigated it, and when I later took his belongings, everyone also said it was Fu En."

Before Yehui could answer, Guan Gongxiao bowed respectfully again.

"This junior understands the Daoist Master's meaning—that all things can be weighed. But Kong Haiying was a Purple Mansion seed and exceptionally talented. How can this be compromised? If we simply let this be glossed over, and Kong Haiying breaks through, I fear he will be no less a threat than Li Ximing."

A flicker of approval finally appeared in Yehui's expression. He nodded, and with a pinch of his thumb and forefinger, he flipped the brownish-yellow jade token in his hand, revealing the golden character carved upon it.

【Kong】

The Daoist Master spoke softly.

"How could I not know? I have met Kong Haiying personally. We fought, we drank together, we even allied to deal with that pig-headed Guo E. I am familiar with his aura. I would not mistake it."

His gaze grew complex. "The one in that secret chamber was Kong Haiying. The aura was clear. Everything else might be wrong, but that point is undeniable."

Understanding dawned on Guan Gongxiao. He replied respectfully, "This junior understands! This is the Li family's 'sincerity.' They spread the news that it was Fu En to save face, while in reality, they handed Kong Haiying over to us as a tacit plea for peace... No wonder... no wonder..."

With that piece solved, everything else clicked into place. He continued, "Therefore... the heavy defenses at Funan and the emptiness of the Profound Peak Wasteland follow the same logic. If not for the Daoist Master's guidance, this junior would have nearly blundered into disaster!"

Yehui's gaze, however, did not rest on him. It drifted past, settling on the 'Kong' character in his hand with an illusory emptiness. His heart felt hollow.

'He is well and truly dead...'

Guan Gongxiao was still thinking, stating respectfully, "Daoist Master, rest assured. The Kong clan's lineage... I will wipe it out..."

He was halfway through his sentence when Yehui shot him a weary look. The Daoist Master's eyes were sharp-cornered, and his exhaustion only made them look more vicious. Guan Gongxiao froze instantly.

"Give Purple Smoke Gate some face," Yehui said coldly. "Kill, kill, kill... You've come all the way from the overseas to Jiangbei, and all you can think about is killing. Look at the Chengyun Gate over there. Learn from Zhong Qian! Chengyun Gate is already the leader of Jiangbei's righteous path, and you are still here, obsessed with killing!"

Guan Gongxiao bowed in terror. "This junior knows his crime!"

Yehui slapped the jade token onto the table. "When you are inland, you follow inland rules! You must play their games. If I hadn't made that trip personally back then, Gongsun Bofan would have defected to Chengshui Marsh long ago. Why would he ever serve you, Guan Gongxiao!"

Guan Gongxiao lowered his head. "There are half a million commoners in the Wasteland who hate Capital immortals Dao. If we do not use them as blood food, we are leaving countless enemies behind!"

A flicker of real anger stirred in Yehui. "Still thinking with that overseas brain !" he cursed. "Li Chenghui already showed you how it's done, and you still haven't learned! Why is the Dense Cloud territory still in chaos? When you take the Wasteland, you do not touch those half-million people. You show great magnanimity. Then you turn heaven and earth upside down—depose the main branches of the lesser clans and elevate the secondary ones; support the outsiders and punish the insiders. The foundation of Profound Peak, its people, will instantly dissolve. They are about to be absorbed by Purple Smoke anyway; they won't have a chance to correct it. By then, they'll only have one or two Foundation Establishment cultivators left. In three generations, the hatred will vanish!"

Guan Gongxiao could only nod in agreement.

Daoist Master Yehui continued in a calmer tone, "From now on, I will not show my face often. Baiye will do the same. Dismantle the great clans, carve up the spirit fields, and forbid annexations. We will no longer walk the path of blood-qi. We will operate as a righteous path."

Guan Gongxiao whispered, "Many of the Dao methods in our sect rely on blood-qi. We will have to rely on our overseas footholds for supplies."

Yehui shook his head. "Learn from the North. Apply heavy pressure and exploitation, forcing those below to secretly refine blood-qi themselves. Then, we shall 'exorcise demons and defend the Dao.' And just like that, the blood-qi is ours. You can learn something from every direction... You still have much to improve upon."

"Learn from the Li Clan's centralized control over the populace, but not their rigid self-restraint. Learn from the Golden Feather Sect's laws against annexation, but not their defensive lack of ambition. You can learn how Chengyun Gate manipulates public opinion to pose as righteous, or how Xuanmiao Temple tricks its disciples into bitter cultivation, all to gather qi for their Daoist Master... Even Situ Mo, that opportunist... his methods are worth your study."

"And that blood-qi. From now on, our own disciples use less of it. Using it to heal injuries is fine, but don't let people see you walking around radiating turbid energy, looking like an obvious demonic cultivator!"

The Daoist Master stood and paced down from his seat. Glancing at Guan Gongxiao's expression, his voice finally took on a trace of solemn gravity.

"Your aunt died early, before she could bear me an heir, and I am too tired to remarry. Capital immortals Dao will belong to you and your Guan clan in the future. If not for your mother's dying wish, I would have lost patience and replaced you as Young Lord long ago. I would never have taught you this much. You would do well to remember that."

Guan Gongxiao was overcome with gratitude. He knocked his head respectfully on the floor three times. "Uncle's guidance will be remembered, every word. The Daoist Master is the Lord of Capital immortals Dao, today and for a hundred, even a thousand years. Gongxiao will serve you faithfully, without a second thought."

"Haha!" Yehui laughed twice, then cursed, "Scram... You certainly learned how to flatter quickly enough."

As Guan Gongxiao retreated, Yehui was struck by a moment of contemplation. He stood and murmured to himself.

"Having a descendant like Gongxiao may not be a bad thing. Someone brilliant like Li Zhouwei is too risky; if he doesn't ascend to the clouds, he plunges into the abyss. Someone weak and mediocre like Kong Guxi is just talentless trash destined for ruin. And those like Zhong Qian or Li Xijun are gifts from heaven, far too rare. Someone who is simply willing to learn and willing to listen... that is enough."

***

**The Wasteland.**

As the sky darkened, Kong Guxi stepped out of the hall, only to see a crowd of people rushing up the peak. The old man leading them was his own brother, Kong Guli, his face a mask of shock and terror. He yelled:

"Ninth Brother! Capital immortals Dao is attacking!"

The situation was so urgent that Kong Guli forgot all honorifics, shouting his sibling's ranking. Kong Guxi was too stunned to care. His hands and feet went numb. "How many?!"

Kong Xiaxiang, standing to the side, had long since lost the arrogance in his brow. "We heard the Capital immortals Dao Young Lord, Guan Gongxiao, is leading them personally! There are more than ten Foundation Establishment cultivators. The sky is filled with the light of their techniques! Our scouts took one look from afar and fled back immediately."

"I already went down to give the order, telling the main lineages and cultivators in every prefecture to escort the populace and retreat. Most of them are loyal..."

"Guan Gongxiao is here!"

Kong Guxi was terrified. He gritted his teeth. "We already had evacuation plans, but they came so fast... We won't be able to stop them. I fear few will survive..."

As he spoke, Kong Guxi immediately turned back into the hall. "Qiuyan! Grab everything!"

Just as Kong Qiuyan acknowledged the order and turned to leave, a massive explosion tore through the sky. A gray cloud blazing with fierce flames appeared, casting a white-hot crimson glare across the heavens as rings of clouds shot toward them.

*BOOM!*

A torrential rain of Merging Fire poured down, smashing into the mountain's defensive array and causing it to shake violently. The great hall swayed, forcing Kong Guxi to ride the wind and burst through the array's barrier.

The figure in the sky stood atop a cloud-ring, wielding a token of Merging Fire, his back lit by billowing gray flames. Who else could it be but Guo Hongjian?

"Kong remnants! Come out and die!"

As the Gate Master of Profound Peak, Kong Guxi was not lacking for artifacts. With a light flick of his sleeve, he summoned a pale green mountain peak and a deep black banner. Grasping the flag, he sent the mountain flying up to meet the flames.

"Daoist Friend Guo, why such burning anger!"

He already hated Guo Hongjian to the bone, but he couldn't afford to offend Crimson Reef Island. Even with a belly full of rage, he couldn't let a single sharp word escape.

He had only just activated his artifact when the scalding Merging Fire crashed down, covering his defenses and causing the artifacts to groan and crackle. He heard incantations from the other side and vaguely saw a red light speeding toward him.

Merging Fire damages one's essence and life; it was one of the most insidious Dao lineages. He wouldn't dare let it strike him, frantically raising the black banner to defend himself.

But Kong Guxi had little talent to begin with and had spent the first half of his life as a wastrel with almost no combat experience. Guo Hongjian, while not particularly bright, had survived numerous life-and-death battles. He feinted, then unleashed a rope of fire from his other side, attempting to hook Kong Guxi's artifact.

*CLANG!*

Fortunately, Kong Guli arrived in time. The old man was far more experienced in fighting. He thrust out a spear, hooking the fire-rope and triggering a blinding flash in the air. Guo Hongjian was just about to shout a threat to boost his own morale when a thunderous roar erupted from below:

"Dog thief!!"

A man in a golden-armored mask burst upward, spear in one hand, axe in the other. His face was hidden, but the eyes visible through the mask were shot with crimson blood. "Do not harm my Profound Peak Gate Master!"

He shot through the flames like a streak of golden light, splitting the cloud-ring with his axe and sending Guo Hongjian stumbling back. Only then did Kong Guxi manage to escape. He looked up to see radiant light bloom in the sky as the white Steps of Radiance descended. Cui Jueyin appeared, saying softly:

"Gate Master, leave this to me! Take the others and retreat first."

Kong Guxi scrambled back. He tried three or four times but couldn't extinguish the flames clinging to his artifact; his own robes were beginning to smolder. Kong Guli stepped closer, helping him put out the Merging Fire as the other Kong Foundation Establishment cultivators gathered around.

Kong Guxi looked at the black clouds massing on the horizon. Fu Yuezi was fighting with extreme ferocity; his Immortal Foundation, 'Heavenly Gilded Helm,' activated, he glowed with golden light, coordinating with Cui Jueyin's techniques to tie down their opponent. But more figures were flying in from the distance. Kong Guxi was horrified.

"Capital immortals Dao attacks with such force. What of Moongaze Lake?"

"We heard Capital immortals Dao forces are attacking Funan, and Situ Mo has also taken the opportunity to push south. Funan is in peril!" Kong Xiaxiang replied.

Kong Guxi shuddered. "The Situ family... they were once our allies, and now it has come to this... What do you all advise?"

Kong Guxi had already ordered Kong Qiuyan to pack their valuables. The meaning was obvious. The others, no matter how slow, understood. They bowed.

"Capital immortals Dao's momentum is too great. We must retreat."

Kong Guxi wailed, "But... but the Wasteland still holds the people of my Profound Peak."

Several men immediately grabbed him to pull him away. Kong Guxi's mouth cried in sorrow, but his feet were very soft. With just two tugs, he was moving, taking off on the wind. The group flew away like a gale, nearly leaving Kong Qiuyan, who was still gathering the valuables, behind.

Kong Qiuyan, her expression awkward, hurried to catch up with the other disciples. Kong Guxi immediately ordered, "Quickly! Inventory the spirit items and artifacts!"

The Foundation Establishment cultivators hurriedly began taking stock. Having already lost their mountain gate once, losing their new headquarters didn't seem quite so painful. Only a few disciples, whose families were still in the Wasteland and now likely lost, began to sob quietly.

Kong Guxi dispatched a few of them, instructing in a low voice, "I have already crushed the jade talismans. Every prefecture knows to flee. If you are worried, you may go and provide support."

Most of the Profound Peak disciples who remained loyal were related to the Kong clan by blood or marriage; their relatives had already been transferred to the Lake. Only a few held local defensive posts not far from here, so they scattered to assist them.

Kong Guli felt uneasy. "Gate Master, we are abandoning our territory and fleeing. Will Moongaze Lake punish us?"

"It should... be fine..." Kong Guxi paused, lowering his head. "Capital immortals Dao came with overwhelming force. The Daoist Master will likely be relieved that we simply survived. As for punishment... it shouldn't be too severe..."

He sighed. "Never mind Guan Gongxiao, we also had that peak Foundation Establishment cultivator Guo Hongjian. His Merging Fire is ferocious. We are not his match. If we had been any slower, and one of them caught us, we might not have kept our lives. If the other one joined, escape would have been impossible."

The group stood in silence. After a while, the eastern sky was covered by the black clouds, and Moongaze Lake's first mountain on the eastern shore, [Dense Forest], gradually came into view. Only then did Kong Guxi's terror truly set in. He looked back several times and whispered:

"Go see the Third Young Master first. Li Chenghuai... we can pay respects to him later..."

He sped toward the eastern shore boundary, only to find the area bustling with cultivators moving back and forth; it was far from stable. Kong Guxi landed and sent someone down to ask. A moment later, a man descended quickly from the main hall—tall, with golden eyes and long hair, walking with a steady gait.

"Third Young Master!"

Li Jiangxia had been run ragged these past few days. The hearts of the people in the Wasteland were unsettled, requiring him, a direct descendant, to personally stabilize many situations. Now, with Capital immortals Dao attacking, the trouble had multiplied.

Though Li Jiangxia looked worried, he was still polite to Kong Guxi. He nodded curtly. "What is the situation in the east? I saw Lord Cui's light heading over. Did he intercept them? Is the Gate Master injured?"

Kong Guxi replied, "It is shameful. The Capital immortals Dao forces came too quickly. Guo Hongjian is powerful. Daoist Friend Cui intercepted him. Crimson Reef Island harbors ill intentions. I did not dare remain and retreated early. I am not injured."

Not long ago, Li Jiangxia had bound Fu Jie and sent him over, and Kong Guxi had endured the pain of executing him personally. But both men tactfully avoided the subject, acting as if there was no friction between them.

Li Jiangxia merely lifted his head slightly. "The Profound Peak populace is still in the Wasteland. Has the Gate Master arranged for disciples to bring them to the eastern shore?"

Kong Guxi found it difficult to speak. He paused before saying, "There were arrangements. But Guo Hongjian arrived too quickly. We... fled in panic and lost our composure. But I have sent disciples to clean up."

Hearing this, Li Jiangxia lowered his gaze and nodded. He asked again, "The primary lineages of the minor clans and the orthodoxies of the small temples under Profound Peak's rule. Were they brought out?"

Kong Guxi grew uneasy. "No... But they received the message. We will count them when the time comes, and see how many were saved."

Li Jiangxia lifted his chin, thoughtful. "Since the Gate Master has already escorted his disciples here, have them fall back to the eastern shore. Proceed to the border between the shore and the Wasteland, and according to the situation, support Lord Cui's retreat."

Kong Guxi nodded repeatedly. Behind Li Jiangxia, An Xuantong sighed inwardly, bowing his head in silence.

'What a pity. The foundation of Profound Peak... finally reduced to nothing. Standing before me is truly no longer the Gate Master of Profound Peak, but merely a remnant of the Kong clan!'
