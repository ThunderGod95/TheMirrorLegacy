# Chapter 878: All Tinted Rose

The massive black-purple bowl continued to loom in the sky, its hollow, circular center glowing with a radiance like intertwined branches and leaves that blanketed the heavens. Pale golden, curling clouds spread outward and settled motionless above.

Now that the true form of the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl had been revealed, not a single person across Jiangnan or Jiangbei could rise on wind. All were forced to the riverbanks. Even Li Qinghong, riding Celestial Thunder and bolstered by a feathered robe, could only hover forty meters above the ground.

She looked upward as the rumbling from the sky slowly descended. All the cultivators around her were wounded, but she clutched her spear tightly and turned toward Si Yuanli.

She asked quietly, "Senior, do you have a treasure that can ascend?"

Si Yuanli was intently examining the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl, bitterness filling his heart. Just as Si Boxiu had granted the Huai River Map, the monks above summoning Maha’s bowl technically didn’t count as direct intervention... But the Maha’s control over Master Monks was unlike that of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. When the stubborn Master Monks claimed they were slaying a demon, who could really argue?

"The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl is nurtured by a Maha... now that it's revealed... who could possibly ascend..." Si Yuanli murmured, "He’s dead set on using these Master Monks to exchange for a competent Merciful One... If they can’t share in the treasures of Anhuai Heaven later, this alone is still a worthwhile reward..."

Although Li Qinghong didn’t fully understand the intricacies of Buddhist cultivation, she had heard that many Mahas were deeply moved and personally intervened when Tang Shedu rebelled. At this moment, Li Xuanfeng's appeal was likely even greater...

Just as Si Yuanli finished speaking, the sky-darkening Kongsijiang Demon Bowl began to shift again. The two black rings on the bowl began to gradually glow golden, and a distant, ethereal decree echoed.

"Compassionate karmic fire. Burn the wicked, and punish the evil!"

The voice drifted down and lasted only a moment before everyone instinctively covered their ears. The black-purple hue in the sky turned deep crimson, and the multicolored clouds transformed into a fiery blaze.

The entire sky now seemed to burn with erratically flickering flames. A thunderous roar followed, "The karmic fire is here, the fiend is doomed!"

As the voice rang out, Si Yuanli’s heart jolted, and he silently began to pray, Please, let nothing go wrong...

***

Inside the Demon Bowl.

Boom!

Li Xuanfeng stood within the blazing deep crimson flames ignited inside the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl. The flames clung to him like a shadow, climbing along his armor, their tongues licking and crackling with metallic clangs.

The eight monks saw the flames, exchanged glances, and burst into laughter, shouting in relief, "The karmic fire has come! The fiend is doomed!"

Li Xuanfeng’s spiritual sense roiled within the fire but was soon forced back into his body. He could feel a searing heat around him, causing the mana in his body to hiss and crackle.

He glanced down and sneered, "Karmic fire? It’s nothing but a fusion of the True Flame, Merging Fire and Molten Fire!"

But the combination of all three fires had weakened the golden qi protecting him. The once indestructible white armor began to groan and crack under the strain, creaking loudly from the burning.

The eight monks thrived in the fire, surging forward like fish in water. Even as he spoke, Li Xuanfeng had already drawn the golden spear from his chest. The white bowstring twanged, releasing five white arrows.

Now, not only was the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl suppressing him, but the blazing triple flames were also burning fiercely. The flash of white light had far less might than before.

Bang!

The Astral Qi on Li Xuanfeng’s white bow weakened in the flames. The five arrows managed to block only five monks. The remaining three rushed forward, forming hand seals, "The ācārya taught me to invoke the Suxikong method, the Shijiali art..."

Ding dang...

Three intricately patterned golden chains flew from their hands, links interlocking as they coiled around Li Xuanfeng’s body. Sparks flew as they climbed up his arms, only for Li Xuanfeng, who had been waiting, to condense golden qi into giant hands, seize the chains, and yank fiercely.

Clang clang clang clang clang...

The sound of the chains striking the white armor thundered like rolling drums. The three monks were stunned as a tremendous force surged along the chains. Sparks exploded as they were pulled straight toward the white-armored figure.

Their spiritual senses flared. They saw the other five monks already closing in behind Li Xuanfeng, five dharma artifacts aimed at his back. Suddenly, realization dawned in their hearts, His spiritual sense must be scorched by the karmic fire, he can’t sense the situation clearly anymore!

Joy overtook fear in their hearts. They lunged forward, deeper into the embrace of that pale, rune-marked face, and shouted, "Die, monster!"

Boom!

Li Xuanfeng’s eyes had turned entirely pale-white. He unleashed a massive blow that shattered their dharma bodies. The three monks below him suddenly erupted with golden radiance.

Unfazed, his fist moved like a blur of light, smashing down upon the three below. Shards of glass-like limbs flew into the air as three anguished screams rang out, "Li Xuanfeng... you’re seeking death!"

But golden qi struck the massive dharma body without restraint. The three monks were already injured with missing heads or limbs, but three cries of regret and fury rang out as Li Xuanfeng yanked them toward him.

"You! How utterly foolish!"

None of the three had expected such ferocity. They were annihilated in an explosion of shattered shards of colored glass and drifting petals. Li Xuanfeng let out a muffled groan.

Crack!

Five dharma artifacts pierced through his body, dragging golden qi in their wake. He swept his white bow around in retaliation, but his movement had grown sluggish and heavy. The five monks leapt back nimbly, each retreating and laughing in unison.

"Excellent!"

Clatter...

Pale-golden qi flowed like blood, trailing down his armor's etched lines. It turned into a white mist in midair and dissolved into the flames. Li Xuanfeng slowly straightened.

Two spears had pierced through his body, with one entering at the left rib and exiting the back, the other transfixing his chest and abdomen. Both bore ornate golden patterns, releasing radiant light that seeped into him.

His left leg bore web-like fractures from a monk's war hammer. Two massive wounds had opened in his abdomen, revealing karmic fire dancing and burning in a hollow inside his white armor.

"Hahahahaha!"

The five monks retreated together, wary of a dying counterattack. Yet they all breathed a sigh of relief. Rather than feeling triumph, it was more like a weight had lifted from their shoulders.

Li Xuanfeng had judged correctly; the karmic fire in the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl was indeed a fusion of three fires. But each fire was of the Purple Mansion Realm. The five had known from the moment they saw it that his death was inevitable!

"No matter how powerful your white armor is, it’s rootless, like floating duckweed! How could it withstand such flames?"

His vision had been obscured and body grievously wounded, but he had still insisted on dragging three down with him. Now, all the five needed to do was guard against a dying blow, and wear him down bit by bit till he died!

Pleased with their advantage, the five monks each began plotting. They slowly and subtly widened the distance between each other. The glow around their bodies was not only watching Li Xuanfeng, but also wary of one another, If I can bring down a few more... wouldn't I earn a greater share of fate?

As the glow behind their heads grew stronger, their eyes began to shift. Their peripheral vision tracked each other’s movements. Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng stood motionless, raising his white bow.

His entire body was shattered, hollowed out by karmic flames burning within. His aura weakened bit by bit, yet he still stood firm, the string of his bow quietly humming.
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

What is he doing?

The five were momentarily stunned as he drew his bowstring back to a full moon. Some chuckled, and one monk wielding a hammer even laughed aloud, "Bathed in karmic fire, what could you possibly shoot!"

Despite the mocking words, all five tightened their guard. Mana surged within them, ready to intercept at any time. It wasn’t carelessness; they simply didn’t want to be the first to make a move and risk falling to a teammate’s betrayal. And so, all five froze in mutual hesitation.

Li Xuanfeng raised his bow and aimed it straight at the hammer-wielding monk. The latter’s expression darkened, while the other four immediately smiled and activated their dharma artifacts, rising higher into the air.

Buzz!

A thunderous roar rang out as the white glow vanished from Li Xuanfeng’s bowstring. The other four simultaneously hurled their dharma artifacts at the hammer-wielding monk, whose face changed drastically as he cried out in horror, "You fools, how could you be so careless!"

Buzz...

The white light shimmered in Li Xuanfeng’s hand, but the white arrow materialized in front of another man, whose face bore a wrathful vajra expression.

Sword in hand, startled and furious, his voice thundered, "You dare!"

"Sowing discord..."

"Good!"

The hammer-wielding monk’s expression darkened, while the other three rejoiced. For the first time, they felt admiration for the white-armored man before them, Pity, how many arrows can he still fire? No matter his schemes, death awaits!

Li Xuanfeng was clearly engulfed in karmic fire; there was no faking that. His mystical arrows had grown weak and feeble. The three relaxed, sneering internally, Tricks of an insect! All he’s doing is helping us claim more glory!

While the five circled in midair, Li Xuanfeng pulled back his bow once again, and this time, a golden-red arrow shimmered on the string.

The arrow was slim but blindingly bright. It was the very mystical arrow forged in Green Pine Temple’s Mirage Mirror Heaven and tempered by Merging Fire and Binding Ring. It was highly resistant to flames. The other five had long melted in karmic fire, while this one merely glowed red.

Li Xuanfeng focused completely. Golden light burst from his white bow, gathering in his palm. Dense Astral Qi poured out like water, forcing the karmic flames around him back three feet.

He no longer looked like a man at the end of his rope. On the contrary, he was even more terrifying than before. The edges of his shattered white armor burned with searing brilliance, stirring fear deep in the soul.

Buzz...

All five froze as the familiar dread of death returned in full force. As Astral Qi surged outward, they all let out sharp howls in unison, shaking the flames around them, "Aaah!!"

Unbelievable shock filled each of their hearts. A single thought surfaced in all their minds, Impossible!

A torrent of golden light erupted like a pillar that connected heaven and earth, parting the karmic fire and converging into the golden-red arrow, which screamed with an ear-piercing shriek.

This arrow was forged from all the Astral Qi Li Xuanfeng had accumulated over countless shots. Over twenty years ago, he had used it against Yu Muxian and nearly killed that genius in a single strike...

Now, after twenty years, twenty years of late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm, of bloodshed and killing, every arrow held the force of years of effort. How could this accumulated force not be terrifying?

When the karmic fire scorched him, he realized his white armor could no longer protect him. But his decades of combat experience, far exceeding the battles these monks had ever seen, he made a split-second calculation and unleashed this arrow.

Buzz...

The five Master Monks in the air were instantly engulfed by Astral Qi. One after another, they and their dharma artifacts were devoured until they were completely erased in that overwhelming storm of Astral Qi.

The brilliant golden light flooded the entire Kongsijiang Demon Bowl. The mountain-sized artifact trembled, letting out a dreadful, muffled roar.

The two closest monks didn’t even have time to groan as their bodies and souls were obliterated in an instant. Even their dharma artifacts turned into golden dust as they were completely annihilated.

The next two had unfortunate comrades shielding them, one blocked by the white arrow, the other by a teammate’s body, yet they too were reduced to ash. Only two faint streams of light flickered in the karmic fire, falling earthward like meteors and veering northward toward reincarnation.

The last monk managed to shift half a step before his body vaporized into nothingness. He only had half a head remaining. His eyes were filled with disbelief, and he had no jaw left to speak. The head tumbled into the karmic fire with a dull thud.

"Ugh..."

He barely formed a mouth, but not a single word emerged. The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl grew dim. The white-armored man now stood before him, eyes cold and resolute. Hde stomped down without hesitation.

Crack!

Shards like colored glass scattered amid the rolling flames. The severed head still held a pleading look in its eyes, but it was crushed underfoot. The supreme golden qi shattered soul and spirit alike, ending his life.

Silence finally returned within the karmic fire. Li Xuanfeng was surrounded by the remains of monks and scattered dharma artifacts. The fire’s tongues licked at the white armor, gradually consuming the golden qi that cloaked him.

Drip!

Autumn dew trickled down Li Xuanfeng’s armor, only to evaporate into nothing in midair from the fire. He slowly pulled the golden spear from his chest and dropped it before him with a clang.

Crack...

He crushed the glass beneath his foot, then slowly sat down. The two Immortal Foundations within him had been reduced to a thin, flickering layer.

He had a faint smile beneath the pale-white runes as he sat atop a mound of broken dharma bodies like a man on his throne. His white bow was lodged in the chest of a corpse as it rested gently in his palm.

Beneath his feet stretched a field of shattered limbs like stained glass. There were arms, legs, snarling faces, and vajra-like bodies, all lying still in the karmic fire. The white bow stood beside him, glowing faintly.

He slowly adjusted his breathing as he waited for the remaining monks to arrive.

But perhaps the other Mahas had intervened, or perhaps the remaining Master Monks were not fools and had already withdrawn. The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl hovered motionless in the sky, but with no monks to sustain it, it lingered for no more than ten seconds before reluctantly fading back into the great void.

Li Xuanfeng sat atop the mountain of monk corpses. The scenery of Jiangnan finally returned in his flame-dimmed eyes.

The surging river flowed east, eddies curling through currents fast and slow. Its cold indifference remained timeless. Jagged rocks jutted up; waves rose and fell. The view was no different than before he entered the formation.

Only now, the river’s surface was crowded with petals, drifting and scattering freely. They clustered together, flowing with the current from west to east, rushing toward the distant Eastern Sea.

His eyes shifted slightly, turning north, along the river’s stretch of fifty kilometers from north to south. The ground was covered in glassy shards, all tinted rose.

"Truly beautiful," he muttered.
