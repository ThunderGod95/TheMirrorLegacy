# Chapter 957: Planning for What Comes After

The heavy rain over Lake Xian had just ended. The skies had cleared, and Li Qinghong stood atop the lake, riding thunder. This part of the water was completely empty, with no trace of people. Li Xuanxuan and the white ape stood beside her.

Moongaze Lake was crowded with people and too conspicuous for a fight, so the group naturally wouldn't make a scene there. Instead, they found a random spot on Lake Xian to land. This was the quietest location in the inland region, with only two lake-dwelling demonic creatures passing by on patrol. When they saw several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, they didn’t dare interfere and pretended not to see them as they slipped away across the water.

Two small boats passed by in the distance, manned by disciples of the Kong Family. They circled around, spotted Li Qinghong from afar, recognized her, offered a distant bow, and continued on their way.

Li Zhouwei raised his hand with his palm facing up. A surge of blazing Radiant Light burst from his palm, forming two armored soldiers by his side. Their white-scaled armor shimmered under the sunlight, with matching silver boots. Their faces bore neither helmets nor features, just a blank expanse of pale light.

Both wielded spears and carried bows on their backs, exuding an imposing presence.

As for Li Zhouwei himself, he held a halberd across his body. Radiant Light gathered at the arc in the center of the weapon, where two halberd blades joined to form a razor-sharp edge that gleamed menacingly.

Kongheng pressed his palms together before his chest, his narrow eyes squinting nearly shut. He chanted softly, and pale golden runes flew from his crimson lips and white teeth and started to circle him.

Li Zhouwei flipped his halberd upward. The Radiant Light at its center rippled, releasing an invisible, colorless glow that instantly covered a section of the lake. White steam hissed up from the surface.

Across from him, Kongheng fared better. He merely felt the blinding light crash against his face like fire, which made it hard to lift his gaze. But as a Buddhist cultivator, he wasn’t afraid of such forces and was not greatly affected.

But the sudden heat was harsh on the lurking demonic creatures nearby. They began sweating profusely and grew restless. After exchanging glances, most of them lost their curiosity and quietly dispersed.

"Da Sheng!"

But Li Zhouwei didn’t stop there. With a command, a stream of flame shot out from the arc and draped over his body. Radiant Light rolled across his armor, and fire spiraled beneath his feet.

Bang!

A sonic boom erupted over the lake. An instant later, the long halberd was already upon Kongheng. The monk finally opened his eyes a little, and suddenly parted his palms, sending forth a burst of golden runes.

The golden runes transformed into chains in midair, clinking noisily as they wrapped around Da Sheng like serpents. Li Zhouwei flexed his forearm, and his halberd shuddered violently, breaking most of them apart.

Kongheng’s hand seal changed in an instant, and his eyes opened slightly wider.

The golden light behind him condensed into a large orb. Then, a massive figure emerged with a thunderous boom. A golden upper body took shape, six arms spreading wide through the air, covered in dense golden script. Its golden face, marked with two broad horizontal lines, glowed with red light and radiated immense authority.

A towering, six-armed Vajra in golden armor rose upright from the golden light.

"Decree!"

The Vajra's eyes widened, and all six of its arms tugged on the golden chains in unison. A heavy metallic clatter rang out as every chain tightened at once, bursting forth in a dazzling flash of golden light.

The golden-armored Vajra was as large as a temple. Its eyes were as wide as windmills, casting a massive shadow over Lake Xian. In front of it, Li Zhouwei looked like a small colt tethered outside a gate. His dharma artifact was yanked taut in an instant.

Kongheng had struck with his full strength, using Buddhist cultivator secret techniques. Li Qinghong and the others all nodded in approval.

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard, lifting his white brows in mild surprise. He turned and said with a smile, "A monk cultivates the heart and is free from worldly affairs. When he strikes, he does so with everything and holds nothing back."

Kongheng wasn't the type to joke around or show favoritism. This strike alone would have disarmed most Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Dense golden chains wrapped tightly around Da Sheng, making Li Zhouwei feel a sudden heaviness in his hands.

Without a moment’s hesitation, he opened his mouth and spat out a beam of white light. The white light shot upward like a white rainbow, not toward Kongheng himself, but directly at the golden-armored Vajra behind him.

It was the Radiant Origin Pass. A white pass formed in the air, dispersing the golden glow in an instant. The Radiant Origin Pass excelled in suppression, and was especially effective against incorporeal spell arts. The Vajra was suppressed into a blur in a flash.

Kongheng nodded slightly when his opponent seized the chance to retrieve his dharma artifact. In theory, using the Radiant Origin Pass to suppress the opponent directly was the best strategy. Like Li Ximing had demonstrated, once the enemy was pinned down, casting spells and chanting incantations became difficult, while draining their mana and gaining the upper hand became easier over time.

But using an Immortal Foundation to suppress the opponent's spell arts might seem like a waste, since too much mana expended with each rise and fall, while the opponent could simply dismiss the spell and cast anew. But Li Zhouwei was facing Kongheng.

Kongheng’s cultivation excels in defense, and he far surpasses me in level. If I were to use an Immortal Foundation to suppress him directly, I’d be meeting strength with strength and weakness with weakness. Even if I manage to save myself this time, next time I’ll be bound by those golden chains, thought Li Zhouwei.

He had instantly capitalized on his opponent’s lack of offensive power and used his Immortal Foundation to grind down Kongheng’s spell arts, rendering them ineffective and preserving his own safety. As for the mana cost...

If I can shift this duel into a contest of mana, then that’s a win in itself!
𝑓𝑟ℯ𝘦𝓌𝘦𝘣𝑛𝑜𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂

The Radiant Origin Pass shimmered for a moment and shattered the phantom in the air into golden light. Kongheng flicked his sleeve, scattering the charging armored soldiers, and said lightly, "Come."

A bronze monk’s staff appeared in his hand. He lifted it into the air and slammed it down with tremendous force. Li Zhouwei raised his brow and brought his long halberd up to meet it.

Clang!

Li Zhouwei wielded an ancient dharma artifact from a grotto heaven, while Kongheng’s weapon was a guardian treasure he had cultivated with since his mortal days. Though it had been refined for many years and was extremely durable, it still couldn’t compare to such a treasure.

The sharp tips on the arc of the halberd gleamed and let out a metallic snap as they hooked into the arched head of the monk's staff. Li Zhouwei had been waiting for this moment. He twisted the halberd, unleashing a burst of Radiant Light flame.

The monk’s staff was firmly caught by the halberd’s hook and couldn’t break free, taking the full brunt of the Radiant Light flame. It crackled loudly as it sizzled, still hanging on the halberd and unable to detach.

Flame washed across Kongheng’s face, forcing him to retreat a step and laugh, "Good!"

His bronze monk’s staff suddenly twisted, writhing like a snake before slipping free from the halberd’s hook. Li Zhouwei, knowing this move wouldn’t finish the monk, followed through with a thrust.

With a shout, Kongheng flung away Li Zhouwei's dharma artifact. He clapped his palms together before his chest and let out a low cry, forcibly halting the halberd’s momentum.

He caught a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact with his bare body?

A flicker of astonishment appeared in Li Zhouwei's eyes. He knew the monk’s physical strength was formidable, but he hadn’t expected him to be this strong. With a thought, Radiant Light burst forth from Da Sheng.

Cough cough!

Kongheng had barely received the blow, but his palms were now scorched and seared from the heat. He quickly let go of the artifact, allowing the blazing Radiant Light to slam into him. He scrambled away in a rather disheveled state.

He ducked forward, lowered his gaze, and flung out a sleeve of golden runes in the same motion. Before the runes could fully form in midair, the long-watchful Radiant Origin Pass came crashing down from the sky. Yet Kongheng remained unfazed.

The heir has only just broken through. His control over his Immortal Foundation must still be unrefined. The Radiant Origin Pass is no ordinary spell, but a projection of the Immortal Foundation itself. Each rise and fall stirs tremendous fluctuations in internal mana! thought Kongheng.

As Li Zhouwei activated his Immortal Foundation, Kongheng’s eyes abruptly flared with golden light. He pressed his palms together and exhaled sharply, "Ha!"

The cry tore through the air like bamboo splitting or silk tearing, shaking the lake's surface into waves. Kongheng had been a Master Monk for many years, and this shout struck precisely just as Li Zhouwei’s mana flow turned. The Immortal Foundation trembled, and Li Zhouwei's face flushed red as he nearly spat out blood.

Kongheng immediately made his move. When the Radiant Origin Pass trembled, not only did a stream of golden runes shoot forth, but the golden figure it had nearly worn down rose again. It reached out with six arms and released a cascade of golden chains into the sky.

Li Zhouwei immediately quelled his internal turbulence, but his opponent had already taken the initiative. Gold light flickered in his eyes, while Kongheng's expression remained firm and unwavering.

It had to be said, aside from his lack of offensive techniques, Kongheng had nearly no weaknesses. Even under the terrifying pressure of Li Zhouwei’s Great Fissure Golden Eye, which enhanced his perception technique to a fearsome level, Kongheng was unaffected. The Radiant Light’s power to dispel and suppress misfortune had little impact on his Buddhist radiance.

I’ve yet to complete Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light... otherwise, I wouldn’t be this helpless... Li Zhouwei exhaled deeply as he was forced to retreat.

But given that his strength was already far inferior, this retreat placed him squarely in the monk’s tempo. Kongheng’s golden chains swayed in the air, while the cluster of golden runes transformed into a small golden wooden fish to resist the Radiant Origin Pass.

The Radiant Origin Pass couldn’t be dealt with by a mere spell, but if the Li Family knew Kongheng well, could Kongheng not know the Li Family just as well? No matter how many wooden fish were crushed beneath its weight, each rise of the Pass triggered another wave of Buddhist resonance, reinforced by golden chains that forced him back into confinement.

Kongheng conducted himself with the utmost seriousness. Even with the clear advantage, he showed no openings. He cautiously tightened the golden chains little by little. After nearly a hundred exchanges, Kongheng finally ceased chanting, and Li Zhouwei planted his halberd to the ground and stopped.

The reason was simple. If the fight continued, it would become a duel to the death. Though the golden chains couldn’t kill Li Zhouwei, escaping them would still cost him vital qi. This was just a sparring match, so there was no need to go that far.

Li Zhouwei handed the halberd to one of his armored soldiers. He had advanced smoothly throughout the battle. After a long moment of reflection, he nodded and said, "I’ve gained much from this exchange."

Kongheng gave a bitter smile and shook his head, only now realizing he had been a bit too harsh. He said softly, "A monk bullying the young with strength... it's hardly justifiable."

"Ah." Little did anyone know, but Li Xuanxuan had been watching with great delight. After all, Li Zhouwei had managed to break through Kongheng’s defenses once. If it had been any other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, they would have had quite the headache. Fortunately, it was Kongheng he had faced. The old man chuckled and said, "Good... very good!"

Li Qinghong had been smiling gently the whole time and said little. The group rode the wind back to the shore, and only then did she speak softly, "Zhouwei, though your cultivation is still shallow, your strength is beginning to show its edge... From now on, I’ll entrust the lake to you and I can rest a little easier."

Li Zhouwei appeared to realize something and nodded heavily. He waved his hand, dismissing Kongheng, the white ape, and the others. Li Qinghong patted him lightly and said with a smile, "Don’t forget, Yuan’e hasn’t been refined yet. You’re only wearing it. Once it’s fully refined, your strength will grow even more."

Li Zhouwei nodded naturally. Li Qinghong continued in a gentle voice, "Our family has given what it can to aid you—armor, halberd, techniques, spell arts, spirit pills... We’ve done our best. Just by being born into this family, we can’t offer you anything better..."

Li Zhouwei was sharp. He sensed something strange in her tone and said gravely, "Please be at ease. I’ve only ever felt overwhelmed by the abundance, never its lack. Minghuang holds the house oath and all its strictures close, and would never dare violate them!"

Li Qinghong let out a soft sigh. It was as if she relaxed, though there was a trace of lament in her breath. She said quietly, "I know... but there’s one matter I must speak with you about."

She paused, then spoke warmly, "Our family's minor sect, when dealing with those of different surnames, has always supported anyone with sufficient innate ability with spirit resources. Chen Yang, who had the highest innate ability, was even granted the Qingdu treatment... I once discussed with my brother that if someone shows the potential for the Foundation Establishment Realm, our family will ensure they receive the necessary cultivation methods.

"But those early families who followed us, like the families of Lijing, though now grand households, were originally farmers. Ultimately, they rarely had the potential for Foundation Establishment Realm, so those cultivation methods have simply sat unused."

She glanced at the lakeshore and said softly, "Now that the lakefront has been unified and the various families serve under our banner, people like An Siwei and Chen Yang show promise of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm. They must be given the chance; don’t let family prejudice cloud your judgment.

"If they succeed in reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm and are willing to take on a post under our house, let them stay. If not, and they seek better prospects elsewhere, then let them go with this bond of goodwill and let them take their families along."

These words left Li Zhouwei silent. Compared to the Azure Pond Sect, their family had little allure for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Without true emotional ties, wouldn't these people be happier choosing their own place to cultivate and establish their own house, rather than living under someone else's roof?

Only the old man at the side furrowed his brow upon hearing this and said softly, "Qinghong, what are you..."

Li Qinghong spoke softly, "Our household has little need for extra hands right now. It's best to advise any cultivator who breaks through to the Foundation Establishment Realm to go their own way. If they remain here by the lake, I fear they’ll fall prey to schemes from the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

"Our family has done right by them. As for techniques, so long as one has enough innate ability and access to spiritual qi, everything except our core secret techniques has been open for study. Spirit resources and items have been distributed annually by every peak and branch; those with higher innate ability receive additional support, and even the opportunity to cultivate on the island. Whenever there’s danger, our own kin were the first to step forward. The other houses respect us for this and this is the bond we share.

"But those are things we can afford to give. Once they reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, however, they will need certain resources that our ancestors risked their lives to obtain, or I did myself. I can only give them to my family. We can no longer afford to give to others... and if we withhold those things, resentment will grow. That would only ruin the goodwill we’ve built."

The woman said gently, "What I mean is... our family must prioritize the Purple Mansion Realm above all. We must avoid creating side troubles. Once provoked, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator’s divine ability can stir countless consequences. It’s better to advise them to leave first, and preserve our bond. Why risk everything for just one or two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators?"

Li Zhouwei finally nodded and said softly, "I understand. So long as our family has no Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of its own, if those of other surnames or minor sects reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, we should first urge them to take their families elsewhere."

Li Qinghong smiled at him, then turned to gaze over the lake. At her side, Li Xuanxuan said nothing. After a long silence, she turned and said, "Uncle, take care of your health."
