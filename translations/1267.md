# Chapter 1267: The Wei Frontier

Xuanwei's move was ruthless, yet it also provided a convenient explanation for why the Tao Clan—descendants of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition who had cultivated the three yin for generations—had so readily surrendered to the Song; put nicely, it was to collect the remains, but put bluntly, it could also be seen as an act of pique, and perhaps the man before him had other intentions, but from Li Zhouwei's standpoint, there were just as many factors to consider.

‘Bringing this head back... what will be the world's reaction?’

Xuanwei did not appear worried about the situation spiraling out of control, but Li Zhouwei had to be, for if Xiyang Abbey still cherished old ties, or felt it was a matter of face, and sent a disciple down the mountain to handle this, what kind of impact would that have on the situation in Luoxia?

The Tao Clan was causing trouble for those great Daoist traditions of Comprehending Profoundity, and Li Zhouwei was naturally happy to see it, watching coldly from the sidelines, wishing these people would entangle each other and reveal more news from the mountain... but the prerequisite for all of this was that it could not affect his own plans!

‘Luoxia must be as steady as Mount Tai; it must remain stable at least until Daoist Master Xiao's important matter is concluded, and no complications can be allowed to arise!’

For this reason, his reply was quite decisive, leaving no room for discussion, which gave Xuanwei a slight pause. The middle-aged man looked deeply at Li Zhouwei, seemingly unable to discern his true objective, and said,

"It might be somewhat troublesome for King Wei to hold Luoxia for long... The Great Adoration Dharma Realm is not far from here, with only Mount Liangchuan standing in the way..."

Li Zhouwei did not answer him, instead stating,

"The Tao Clan must have a cultivator who is a Holder of the Profound."

The meaning was clear, and it was also Li Zhouwei's repayment to that Song Emperor. Xuanwei did not have many doubts, saying softly,

"That's not a problem... Of the three Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in my clan, I have already entered the Profound Pavilion and cannot serve the Song. Besides Jiexing, there is one other Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, who is my direct eldest son, named Shidao. He has been cultivating in his cave dwelling all this time."

"He, along with the entire Tao Clan, can defend Luoxia for King Wei."

Xuanwei's voice grew softer as he turned to Tao Jiexing and said,

"Go and invite Shidao over."

At these words, Tao Jiexing silently lowered his gaze and departed, which did not surprise Li Zhouwei.

The moment this Daoist Master Xuanwei had finished reciting his Dao lineage in the pavilion and declared himself of the Profound Pavilion, it already signified that this man could never serve the Song. In essence, Xuanwei was from the same background as Qi Lanyan and Wei Xuanyin—a direct descendant of Comprehending Profoundity!

No matter how far he had fallen, he was still a cultivator of the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect, an orthodox cultivator of the Comprehending Profoundity. Tracing his ancestry upward, he had legitimately studied under True Monarch Shoulou, whom he called his Grand Master.

In the Great Song, his status was so esteemed that it was not the least bit inferior to Yang Ruiyi's. Just as Yang Ruiyi could not possibly turn to the Buddhists or the Zhao, Xuanwei could absolutely never openly stand with the Great Song's faction.

‘If I could truly make use of him, I wouldn't have to worry about Luoxia's safety at all…’

But Xuanwei's affair was a matter for the great Daoist traditions, and the benefit would also be the Great Song's. Li Zhouwei was not one to give up so easily. Instead, he stood up and said nonchalantly,

"This king can understand Senior Tao's concerns, but the safety of Luoxia is also of paramount importance. If senior has a strategy or method to stabilize this place, then your clan's Daoist Master need not personally brave the hail of arrows."

Xuanwei pondered for a moment, then said,

"King Wei has already slain Gongsun Bei, so the Zhao court is surely terrified. The likes of Jiang Toushou are fierce in appearance but timid at heart. Their divine abilities are sufficient, but if ignored, they will certainly emerge from Zanmen and cause chaos. Yet, to mobilize a large force would be rather unworthy..."

He said with a serious expression,

"My Tao Clan possesses a treasure, built by our ancestors in Xiyang Abbey long ago, of infinite marvels. If Shidao takes this item to Boye, with the assistance of one or two divine abilities, he can ensure that the likes of Jiang Toushou will return with nothing to show for their efforts."

Tao Shidao was said to possess merely two divine abilities, and Jiang Toushou would certainly not be alone when he emerged from seclusion. This statement was truly difficult to believe, but Li Zhouwei was not polite in the slightest, saying,

"Can these words be trusted!"

Xuanwei smiled and turned around, and a man entered from outside the pavilion. He carried a sword on his back, his lips were tightly pursed, and his face was slightly thin and pale, but his pair of eyes were large and bright.

His apparent age was close to Xuanwei's, yet his gaze held a sharpness that bored straight into Li Zhouwei, his eyes filled with astonishment and a fighting spirit. Xuanwei gently pulled him over and said,

"Shidao, greet King Wei!"

"I have long heard of your great name."

His voice was soft and hoarse, causing Li Zhouwei to look at him sideways. King Wei was somewhat surprised and said,

"Your clan is truly full of hidden talents!"

Tao Shidao was already at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm!

This Daoist Master was said to be Daoist Master Xuanwei's son, only about twenty years older than Li Ximing; he could absolutely be considered a genius!

‘No wonder Xuanwei is so confident. To think that Yang Ruiyi miscalculated him as well... It seems he's also a sword cultivator, already capable of deciding the course of a great battle...’

But unexpectedly, the one in a greater hurry was Tao Jiexing, who followed behind him. His gaze repeatedly met Xuanwei's, and finally, he took a step forward and said in a low voice,

"Reporting to King Wei, I went out just now and glanced eastward from afar. I sensed a multicolored light reaching to the heavens. A high-ranking Buddhist master must be coming; we need to prepare early!"

Li Zhouwei's gaze sharpened in an instant.

"The Great Adoration Dharma Realm or the Lotus Temple?"

Xuanwei nodded impassively, and Tao Jiexing said,

"It is... the Lotus Temple."

His eyes were truly formidable. From a thousand li away, with just a single glance and no need to discern any aura, he could vaguely guess the identity upon entering, and said,

"I'm afraid it is... Mingzang of the Lotus Temple!"

At these words, Tao Shidao only frowned. Xuanwei was stunned and a little uneasy.

"It's actually him? Does the Lotus Temple truly intend to interfere after all..."

Just hearing that it was the Lotus Temple, much of the iciness in Li Zhouwei's brow dissipated, and he said nothing. Xuanwei understood his meaning and smiled,

"Shidao, you take the Lacquer Cloud Branch and make a trip."

Only then did Tao Shidao's fervent gaze shift. Without another word, he transformed into a streak of light and vanished. Li Zhouwei was much more satisfied in his heart,

‘Though I couldn't get Xuanwei himself to stand guard, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm is absolutely enough... Whatever treasures the Tao Clan has, he can also wield them skillfully, so it won't be a case of their power going to waste.’

But then, the Xuanwei before him finally spoke with a grave expression,

"My Tao Clan has one more presumptuous request—I hope King Wei will agree to it."

Tao Shidao's intervention had put Li Zhouwei in a much better mood, so he said,

"Please speak."

Xuanwei raised his brows,

"North of Luoxia, there is a place called Badger Prefecture. Is King Wei aware of it?"

Li Zhouwei said with great interest,

"Naturally, I am aware."

The expression on Xuanwei's face gradually became serious as he said,

"Badger Prefecture was once in the hands of the Chen Clan. The Chen Clan and my Tao Clan were on good terms in the past, and they borrowed a treasure from us, the White Curtain Old Dream Tower, to stabilize a mystic realm... But unexpectedly, the tides of the world turned, and we later lost contact. This treasure has been left in the Chen Clan's possession ever since."

"We hope that when the Great Song obtains it one day, you can fulfill the wish of my Tao Clan!"

As soon as these words were spoken, their meaning was all too obvious. Li Zhouwei grew increasingly vigilant in his heart and couldn't help but sigh internally,

‘This matter is no secret among the great Daoist traditions after all...’

Li Zhouwei, however, had no intention of agreeing. Seeing his hesitant expression, he just smiled and said,

"Is there more?"

Xuanwei sighed softly,

"I ask that King Wei grant my Tao Clan a portion of Yin-Leap Qi!"

‘Yin-Leap Qi.’

Li Zhouwei was first taken aback, a strange feeling rising in his heart, then he couldn't help but laugh.

"The forces on the lake are weak and our foundation is still shallow. Where would we get any Yin-Leap Qi... Why does senior say such things? Perhaps it would be better if I made a request to the Song court on senior's behalf; they might just be able to satisfy the Tao Clan's request."

Xuanwei's expression was melancholic as he said,

"The Tao Clan is asking in all sincerity..."

Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal, the expression on his face gradually turning cold. He interrupted him faintly, saying,

"I wonder what the Tao Clan thinks this king has come to Luoxia to do? Because the Tao Clan has been sensible, I have shown more courtesy. Yet Daoist Master Xuanwei seems to think this king came to compromise and capitulate, with your conditions growing one after another..."

He set down his cup and said inexplicably,

"On the contrary, I have a question to ask you, Daoist Master."

"King of Wei, please speak!"

Xuanwei replied, only to see the person before him say,

"The various families have operated in Luoxia for many years, but presumably none have been here as long as the Tao Clan. Through all the ups and downs over the years, the Tao Clan has seen it all. I wonder... do any of the families possess territories such as mystic realms?"

Tao Jiexing was calmer, merely a little puzzled, but Xuanwei's expression changed slightly as he answered,

"There are..."

‘As I thought!’

Li Zhouwei's expression did not change, but he sneered in his heart.

‘Even a cunning rabbit has three burrows... to say nothing of these divine ability clans that are like local tyrants?’

Xuanwei had a foreboding premonition. Seeing that he did not answer, Tao Jiexing picked up the conversation and said eloquently,

"The Qiao and the Wei were originally subjects of the Great Wei. Back then, this place was also the temporary palace of the High Radiance True Monarch, who raised up a mystic realm, so it all belonged to the Wei court. The Qiao Clan was stationed at the Bountiful Yang Grotto, and the Wei Clan stood guard at the Mountain's Edge Hall."

"When Wei was destroyed, one of the Qiao Clan's Daoist Masters died in battle, and another surrendered to Qi, plundering the Bountiful Yang Grotto bare. He occupied it for himself as his personal place of cultivation, but now the divine ability inheritance has been severed, and his own family members can no longer enter."

"The two families took advantage of their proximity. The Wei Clan's Mountain's Edge Hall was similarly taken for their own. In their early years, they produced many talents, and the inside was magnificent, but in recent years their divine ability has also been severed. Although Jia Zan is very close to them, it's clear he can't go to that place either."

Li Zhouwei smiled with an ambiguous meaning.

"Things of the Bright Yang are not so easy to use, are they?"

Tao Jiexing, suspecting nothing, nodded and said,

"They no longer dare to cultivate the Bright Yang. Over the years they've changed many things... and cultivated other Dao lineages..."

Xuanwei remained silent, only watching King Wei's expression. Tao Jiexing paused for a moment and continued,

"The Yang and Ju, on the other hand, were generals of Liang. Their origins were not particularly high, and although they had disciples who entered Comprehending Profoundity, none achieved anything too astonishing, and no one was willing to return... so naturally, they have none."

"The Yu Clan is somewhat special. Their ancestor lacked the ability to raise up a mystic realm, but he snatched one from another family. Unable to move it, he moved his own clan from the outside to this place. They've always kept it under tight wraps..."

Li Zhouwei frowned slightly and said,

"Since recent antiquity, the methods of creation from the Great Void have fallen out of practice. The families of Luoxia are truly capable to have maintained them until today?"

Xuanwei stroked his beard, while Tao Jiexing showed a hint of a smile, finally saying,

"It is all thanks to my Yinling."

"My Dao follows the line of the Viewing Pavilion and Xiyang, and we naturally have the Veiled Yin mystic realm, the Yinling Palace. It was established by borrowing the power of the True Monarch's Dao-attainment back then and remains as stable as Mount Tai to this day. The other families have all relied on the power of my Yinling to avoid the hardship of maintaining their mystic realms."

Li Zhouwei said quietly, There is more than just this one."

As soon as he spoke, Xuanwei trembled slightly.

From the moment Li Zhouwei had stepped into the Tao Clan's Yinling Pavilion, he had recognized at a glance that this object was a spirit pavilion used to stabilize and connect to a mystic realm. Its aura extended all the way into the Great Void, faintly linked to something else.

And Tao Shidao had not been in some cave dwelling at all, but in the mystic realm, which was why Yang Ruiyi's intelligence had been flawed.

His current Dao-Profundity was extremely high. With just a subtle sensing, he realized that the linked object was extremely similar to the Hall of the High River in the Cui Clan's possession.

If Cui Jueyin had not brought the Hall of the High River, he might have had some doubts, but now that he had seen it, he recognized it at a glance!

‘It must be an artifact of the former Wei!’

And a spirit pavilion of the Bright Yang, one set down during the time of the Wei Emperor, could not possibly be placed in the Veiled Yin Yinling Palace!

Xuanwei's heart tightened as he replied,

"King Wei is brilliant. My Tao Clan's ancestors went through several wars and have a deep foundation. A Governing Yang Grotto once surfaced in Yinling. An ancestor used his divine ability and dharma power to maintain it, pushing the Yinling Palace to suppress it, causing it to be temporarily suspended in the Great Void..."

"This grotto has numerous restrictions inside. The ancestor wished to leave it for the training of the younger generation, but unexpectedly, the various mystic realms later became increasingly unstable. While the Yinling Palace could still be entered and exited at will, the Governing Yang Grotto became precarious, and even those with divine abilities had difficulty entering... Yet they were unwilling to let it go, so it has been hanging there ever since, awaiting a change in the spiritual climate..."

‘That’s a fine way of putting it.’

A trace of regret flashed in Li Zhouwei's eyes.

‘As expected, the Central Plains has many Bright Yang remnants. It's a pity that mystic realms are suspended high in the Great Void and cannot be moved by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, otherwise my own house wouldn't have had to go through so much trouble...’

He pondered for a moment, and Xuanwei had already said with a serious expression,

"If King Wei is interested, I, Tao, am willing to present this item to you!"

But the young man slowly shook his head, his eyes seeming both cold and playful as he said,

"Senior Xuanwei, you are mistaken."

Xuanwei raised his head slightly. The golden eyes before him held a warm smile, and King Wei smiled and said,

"The former officials of Wei are now this king's subjects, and as for the mystic realms of the former Wei, since they have fallen into my hands, they are this king's property. How can there be any logic in using this king's things as a gift to this king?"

Xuanwei stood frozen on the spot, his expression changing several times. For a moment, he was at a loss for how to reply, as if he had realized something. His thoughts churned, and he frowned as he said,

"If that is the case, my Tao Clan will still be needed to stabilize the mystic realm for King Wei and open it slowly..."

Tao Jiexing also nodded and said sincerely,

"This is no lie. This mystic realm was already damaged and is barely maintained by relying on the legacy of our ancestors. Now, we only need the Yang Clan to contribute a little effort, and in a matter of a few years, King Wei will be able to enter and explore it carefully."

"A few years?"

King Wei took the royal battle-axe from his waist and smiled,

"That won't be necessary either. Just let it fall."

‘Fall!’

"King of Wei... you mustn't!"

Tao Jiexing's expression changed abruptly, and he said urgently,

"The spiritual climate here has been stable for many years. It has already fluctuated greatly due to the fall of General Gongsun, and the Qiao Clan's Bountiful Yang Grotto is already in extremely poor condition. If another mystic realm were to fall, it would shake the heavens and the earth, and it would surely trigger a chain reaction!"

He said in a deep voice,

"At that time, my Tao Clan can certainly stay out of it, but the Qiao Clan's Bountiful Yang Grotto will surely fall first. When a Bright Yang realm falls to the earth, the Wei Clan's Mountain's Edge Hall will likely be shaken as well..."

Before the young man could finish his words, Xuanwei had already stopped him, gently shaking his head. Tao Jiexing stared blankly for a moment, while the smile on the young man's face before him grew brighter and brighter.

"Perfect. It saves me the trouble of collecting them one by one."
