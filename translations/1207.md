# Chapter 1207: Arrogant Wood

'I'd long heard that Zhong Qian was a man of character, a true gentleman, though not as carefree and chivalrous as Tu Longjian. Seeing him now, it's clear he has a deep sense of gratitude. Moreover... judging by the circumstances of today's trade, Chang Yun intends to curry favor with my family... If there are no outside interferences, he will most likely come as well.'

Li Jiangqian, worried that a divine ability might be used for concealment, had specifically left a jade talisman for Zhong Qian. He had also asked him to notify those on the lake as soon as he received word of Chang Yun's return, so he could position himself to gauge the gap in strength between the two sides. Confident that he had overlooked nothing, he offered his thanks and finally returned.

As evening approached, the setting sun burned like fire over Moongaze Lake, draping the palaces in crimson clouds. The scenery was magnificent. Li Jiangqian rode a stream of fire, his mind still abuzz with calculations:

'Zhong Qian's divine ability has progressed so rapidly; the Golden Feather Sect must have given him significant support from behind. In that case, he carries considerable weight. As long as he's willing to act on my family's behalf, he might even be able to tie up some of the Golden Feather Sect's attention.'

The internal situation in Western Shu was unclear, but Li Jiangqian did not believe that the interests of Mount Changhuai and the Golden Feather Sect were necessarily aligned:

'At the very least, the Golden Feather Sect prefers to work with intelligent people; they dislike even their opponents being overly stubborn or foolish, to say nothing of their allies. An imbecile like Qing Jifang, with his unguarded tongue and caustic temperament... Tianhuo is arrogant by nature, and Tianque is quick to anger—how could they possibly work together? One could glean a great deal from the Golden Feather Sect's great battle at the White River all those years ago.'

His thoughts raced as he guided the fire to land within the palace. He finally let out a breath, his gaze sweeping over the dim and gloomy halls. With a moment of leisure, his focus returned to himself.

'All matters have been arranged; now I just wait for their news... This is a perfect time to cultivate.'

Li Jiangqian now possessed the Great Scripture of Radiance's Southern Brightness Heart-Fire, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, and his trump card, the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method. Though he had only just broken through, his abilities were already top-tier among cultivators with a single divine ability.

But he had not forgotten his family's marvelous art, the Great Radiance of White Brilliance!

He merely glanced at the art and understood it instantly. Opening his Profound Acupoints, he began to resonate with its light, feeling an unparalleled compatibility with his own divine ability. For a time, he was lost in it, unable to pull himself away.

Li Ximing had personally proven the power of this marvelous art, and its difficulty was no less than its might. With the speed of Li Ximing's two spiritual fires, it had taken him a full year to produce a single strand of red radiance. It only grew more difficult after that; it took him over ten years to form a golden radiance! He had once sighed to Li Jiangqian:

'If you want to cultivate it to great completion, even without bottlenecks, it would take two hundred years of ceaseless effort. Add in one's own cultivation and miscellaneous duties, and it would easily take four or five hundred years, and others might not even match my pace!'

But after a long immersion, Li Jiangqian slowly opened his eyes, which were filled with astonishment. The first time he sensed the Radiant Fire, he spread his palm, and within it, three strands of red light were already darting about!

As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in charge of the Great Scripture of Radiance, his experience cultivating the Great Radiance of White Brilliance was naturally different. 

Li Ximing's understanding back then had been correct; the principle of the Great Radiance of White Brilliance was that by fire's reflection in a bronze mirror is Li-Light gathered. 

A spark of fire from an external source was worlds apart from the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire condensed from one's own very life force—in other words, this art was forged for the Great Scripture of Radiance itself!

When the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire was placed within his Profound Acupoints, the art finally connected with his Great Scripture of Radiance... He had clearly not spent much time cultivating it, yet he already possessed three strands of red radiance. Beyond his own cultivation, the advancement of the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire, like an increase in the fire's source, would also increase the number of red radiances!

'For ordinary cultivators, this number has an upper limit. The Great Scripture of Radiance has its limits, after all, adding ten or so at most. But for me, that's not necessarily the case... once the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire grows stronger...'

But as his thoughts reached this point, a thoughtful expression appeared on his face. His gaze fixed on the three strands of light in his hand, pulsing silently, as he slowly connected them to the Talisman Qi within his body.

Greedy Snare of Profound Li!

His golden pupils widened slightly. In an instant, the three points of red radiance in his hand flared, growing hazy and indistinct as they projected three shimmering reflections!

These three reflections flickered for a moment before being instantly extinguished by the golden-eyed youth. The surprise in his eyes danced for several long breaths before he reined in his emotions.

'At this rate... once I have five strands of golden radiance... this art will be at great completion for me!'

This made him narrow his eyes with a smile. Only then did he notice the jade pendant at his waist responding continuously. His expression returned to calm, and with a wave of his sleeve, the hall doors creaked open.

He saw the man below had been waiting between the palace halls. It was old man Qu. He bowed deeply and said with some urgency:

"Your Highness... a Daoist Master has come to the lake... he has been waiting for seven days. The Young Master sent people to search everywhere for you and left me here to wait..."

Li Jiangqian made a quick calculation, a hint of confusion in his voice as he asked:

"Which divine ability cultivator?"

Qu Bushi pressed his head to the floor and said respectfully:

"These humble ears are unworthy of hearing the great lord's name..."

Hearing that the visitor had not given a name, Li Jiangqian understood and felt a surge of secret joy:

'Nine Mounds is quite direct! It's just a shame my sister cannot be moved. The main hall is sealed, so she cannot meet with those below, forcing him to wait here for nothing.'

He was already in high spirits and immediately smiled:

"Please have him come to Gardenia Scenery Mountain!"

He instantly stepped into the Great Void, riding a trail of fire, and appeared on the mountain. By chance, a Daoist Master was also descending. He wore a tall crown and white robes, with a handsome face, and his body surged with the blazing fire of a divine ability—a cultivator of Fire Virtue!

There were many Fire Virtue cultivators in the world, but the major powers were mainly distributed among the Four Seas, Mobei, and the Feather-Shedding Land; they were rather few in Jiangnan. Even rarer, the fire on the man's body was both arid and mercurial; he was a 'Blazing Fire' cultivator.

Li Jiangqian was quite surprised. He cupped his hands in salute and said:

"Daoist friend, you are..."

The other man smiled slightly and replied:

"This humble one is Fu Chi... Daoist friend probably doesn't recognize me... though I have cultivated in Jiangnan before. My secular name is Dantai Jin."

Li Jiangqian understood at once:

"So it is you, Daoist friend!"

In that instant, he grasped Daoist Master Yuanxiu's arrangements from all those years ago. Overcome with emotion, he said:

"Daoist Master Yuanxiu... was truly formidable."

A trace of gloom flashed across Dantai Jin's face, clear evidence that he still cherished the memory of his master. He nodded lightly and said:

"Master... was also an old friend of my grandfather. The two were the closest of friends, but it's a pity my grandfather was not fated to possess a divine ability... I broke through a few years ago, so I changed my attire and went to the old lands of the Southern Sea to pay respects to Master. I visited the place where he fell, collected some water from the Southern Sea, and sent it back to Nine Mounds to be placed before my grandfather's memorial tablet..."

"I hadn't expected to receive your clan's message. These spiritual items are valuable, so I brought them along on my way."

The man's words made it sound convenient, but judging from Dantai Jin's attire, the Daoist Master had likely planned to mourn Daoist Master Yuanxiu in the Southern Sea for three years, only to be called back by this matter. Li Jiangqian simply said:

"We have truly troubled you, Daoist Master!"

Dantai Jin shook his head and said politely:

"It is nothing. In the future, here in Jiangnan, I must ask King Wei to look after me."

He did not say much more. Taking a seat, he produced a scroll and said seriously:

"Daoist Master Cao read your clan's letter and retrieved the spiritual items for me to deliver."

He then continued:

"As for the Metal Virtue item, we have a Mind-Gathering Malice-Suppressing Gold. It is an item of 'Wandering Metal'. Not only does it meet all your requirements, Daoist friend, it is also the gentlest of Metal Virtues, compatible with Dawn Qi."

"As for an item of Dawn Qi, my Daoist tradition has few. Furthermore, your request stated it could not be a spiritual light. Only a Night-Crossing Hanging Stone meets your clan's requirements!"

The materials Liu Changdie had selected were all common items of the current age. An ordinary family might not possess them, but in the hands of Nine Mounds, they were naturally nothing special. Li Jiangqian nodded with delight, but the other man laughed and said:

"It's a pity that 'Harmonising Metal' is no longer available and is difficult to find in the world. Otherwise, you would not need to resort to 'Wandering Metal' for your formation."

Li Jiangqian clearly remembered that his family had never mentioned a great formation to Nine Mounds. Growing slightly wary, he smiled and said:

"How can you tell?"

Dantai Jin paused for a moment before replying:

"These spiritual items and resources have rather distinct characteristics. Besides, where is Daoist Master Zhaojing cultivating? And where is King Wei? Surely the two Daoist friends are not planning to go to the Eastern Sea?"

Understanding dawned in Li Jiangqian's heart. His expression unchanging, he sighed:

"Impressive!"

He suddenly understood the man's meaning.

Dantai Jin was from Nine Mounds, so he naturally knew of Li Que'wan's recent breakthrough. Counting the divine ability cultivators, the Li family now had four in the Purple Mansion Realm! And King Wei among them was a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator! They were on the verge of rivaling an immortal sect, but Moongaze Lake... could not support four such cultivators!

'My family has the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, so I have always felt that our spiritual qi was boundless and never had this concern. But in the eyes of an outsider, our great formation is not the Azure Pond Sect's Tianyuan One Dao Spiritual Formation. Moongaze Lake is already crowded with cultivators. At best, the lake's island can support King Wei, and the Milin Mountains can support my great-grand-uncle. My younger sister and I already feel the strain on our resources...'

Furthermore, the man's Daoist tradition was profound; he had been able to deduce a great deal just from the requirements for the spiritual items. This served as a reminder to Li Jiangqian, who made a mental note of this potential oversight. Shaking his head, he said:

"Though not spot on, it is not far off... my family intends to establish a formation on the western shore."

Dantai Jin nodded. The youth before him, however, wore a solemn expression as he said:

"When the time comes, if there is trouble, I will have to ask for the assistance of you two Daoist friends."

Dantai Jin had just mentioned needing King Wei's care, so he could not very well drop the topic now. He nodded.

"That is only natural. I am currently visiting old friends and must return to the Azure Pond Sect once more. In the future, I should be acting alongside Senior Ning."

'So that's how it is. Although Dantai Jin is close with Sima Yuanli, in terms of Daoist tradition, he still belongs to the Azure Pond Sect...'

With this, Li Jiangqian was even less worried that the man would refuse to help. He accepted the jade box Dantai Jin handed him and, with a flick of his finger, opened the lid. The Mind-Gathering Malice-Suppressing Gold, which was to serve as the formation's core, was the size of a fist. Its surface was as smooth as a mirror, its fluctuations exceedingly faint.

The Night-Crossing Hanging Stone was of a slightly lesser quality. Though it was a fine specimen, it could not even be considered mid-tier among Dawn Qi items. Together, the two were roughly equivalent in value to the spiritual fire; clearly, Nine Mounds' sense of proportion in the exchange was extremely precise:

'After all, our family's spiritual fire isn't anything special...'

Li Jiangqian tested the waters:

"Then the matter of the spiritual fire is now settled."

Dantai Jin nodded with a smile. He did not stay long. After a final salute, he rode the wind to take his leave, stepping on the raging Blazing Fire as he entered the Great Void. He cast one last look at the land below before slowly withdrawing his gaze.

'Forty years... four divine ability cultivators...'

He felt as if he were in a daze. He traveled south in silence, crossing a vast plain, and soon an immortal peak appeared before him. The mountain was lofty and imposing, with layered cliffs and precipitous peaks, adorned with palaces of every description.

Dantai Jin stirred his divine ability with some unease. Soon, a voice tinged with doubt came from within the great formation:

"Which Daoist friend has come to my Sima Family?"

A hint of a smile touched Dantai Jin's lips as he replied:

"This humble one is Fu Chi."

There was a brief silence from within the formation before a streak of green light flew out, manifesting into a figure in the Great Void. It was a middle-aged man in green robes, his complexion slightly pale, with a long, dark beard. He stared intently at him.

"Brother Dantai!"

Sima Yuanli was already over two hundred years old, yet in that instant, his eyes reddened. He hurried across the Great Void, took the man's hand, and said with excitement:

"Excellent! You... you succeeded!"

In all his years of moving among powerful figures, Sima Yuanli had often shown a false face to others. Only now was his expression one of pure, unadulterated excitement. Dantai Jin, having just returned from the place where Daoist Master Yuanxiu had fallen, was filled with sorrow. Unable to stop himself, he shed tears and said:

"Master has fallen!"

As Sima Yuanli led him inside, he covered his face. His voice choked with sobs as he said:

"The Quest for Gold is a martyrdom for the Dao. The old master's wish has been fulfilled..."

Once they were inside the formation, Sima Yuanli immediately brought out his old master's last words for the young Daoist Master to read. Tears streamed down Dantai Jin's face. He also noticed that the Daoist Master beside him had a weak aura and a pale complexion. He couldn't help but ask:

"Yuanli... what's wrong with you..."

Sima Yuanli was already filled with gloom. Hearing his words, he lowered his eyes.

"I... I made another attempt to attain a divine ability... I failed, and was injured..."

Dantai Jin was shocked. He activated his divine ability and placed a hand on Sima Yuanli's wrist. After a moment, he frowned.

"You were too hasty!"

"How could I not be hasty! In the struggle between the north and south, which major figure does not have three divine abilities, which one does not possess a Spiritual Treasure! This is an era of great contention..."

Sima Yuanli's face was pale, his eyes even dimmer as he spoke:

"The old Daoist Master left behind so many resources... I passed the stage of nurturing my divine ability early, and I had potent medicines to consume while condensing my immortal foundation... but... I have already failed three times! I don't know how many spiritual items and resources I have poured into this... enough to allow a Foundation Establishment cultivator to reach the Purple Mansion Realm... How can I remain calm..."

His tone grew melancholic, and he choked out:

"I am only afraid that I will fail to live up to the old Daoist Master's cultivation!"

Dantai Jin said with difficulty:

"But you cultivate 'Upright Wood'! The 'Upright Wood' that is as unyielding and proud as metal! Master was proud and ruthless, yet also possessed a patient heart. He had clearly stepped into the Purple Mystery but concealed it for so many years, allowing those jumping clowns to run rampant... If you had only learned a tenth or two of that..."

Sima Yuanli's expression, however, grew composed. He said quietly:

"When my brother and I first began cultivating the Dao, the Daoist Master said we were humble and without pride, capable of yielding and concealing our true selves. How is that the aptitude for Upright Wood? It was Master's incredible treasure—a talisman from the Wuguan Daoist tradition, combined with a Pure Qi spiritual item—that forcibly elevated me... But you speak of pride... what kind of world is this today!"

"Two paragons of martial might have risen in this age, making Bright Yang king. The Supreme Yang is but a cloud of past glories; only a single Dui Sword has attained reverence. The Tang Dao shattered like jade, the King of Lake Xian was martyred, Qi Lanyan, with the nobility of his Daoist tradition, leveraged great power to protect his Dao, and Kong Tingyun, with her humble station, dared to mend the heavens with her very life... what qualification do I have for pride? At most, all I have is a measure of admiration."

He sat upright, a hint of detachment now coloring the calm on his face as he said mockingly:

"I do not know... why the old Daoist Master had me cultivate 'Upright Wood'. My own path has not been righteous, nor have my methods been honorable. The most unyielding of us was actually my older brother. He even dared to defy a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator... yet he was sent to cultivate Water Virtue..."

The Daoist Master's gaze was complex as he looked at the reflection in his jade cup and smiled:

"His schemes... none of the cultivators back then could understand them. That year, when Anhuai Heaven had just fallen, he had already reminded me to search for traces of True Qi cultivators. Later, on the very day of his breakthrough, ninety-nine percent of cultivators could not have imagined he would draw down a sky full of Pristine Water to aid his Quest for Gold and Gathering Wood... As for his arrangements for me, I am often slow to realize, and more often than not, completely puzzled."

Dantai Jin studied his childhood friend carefully and said softly:

"At least Master trusted no one. So, Yuanli... you are far more fortunate than Daoist Master Qiuhu."
