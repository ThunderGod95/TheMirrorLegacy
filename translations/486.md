# Chapter 721: Intervention

Li Xuanfeng held the small seal in both hands. He kneeled quietly on the ground and was feeling the cold touch in his palms. The seal was indeed small, it was only two fingers wide and three fingers tall.

Coiled atop the seal was a strange serpent, somewhat similar to the Hooked Serpent Li Wushao back home. However, this one was densely covered in feathers, with two long wings extending downward to shroud the sides of the seal.

Similar to a Hooked Serpent and with the seal’s name and Yuan Su’s Immortal Foundation in mind, could it be the legendary Pristine Water Feathered Serpent of old? thought Li Xuanfeng.

The seal was a pale golden hue throughout, perfectly uniform without a single impurity. Threads of bluish light flowed across its surface. Simply holding it made the skin feel cold, as though it weighed nothing at all.

This is certainly a spirit item and possibly an ancient one. I’ve heard it was gifted by Daoist Master Donghua, which would make it not only rare but likely one of the finest of its kind. It was worthy of upholding Yuan Su’s renown, thought Li Xuanfeng.

He remained silent as he was waiting for someone among the skyborne figures to speak. The seal, drawn by the lingering mana from Yuan Su’s passing, emitted a soft glow that cast a cyan-gold sheen across his collar.

He waited a long time, yet silence persisted. The flute song lingered briefly, then the stern-faced Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Azure Pond Sect’s in azure robes finally broke the silence with a calm voice, "The Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal belongs to my Azure Pond Sect. Naturally, it should be returned to its rightful owner."

Xiao Chuting remained silent, floating in midair. The purple-robed female cultivator suddenly spoke coldly, "Si Boxiu, is this seal truly Azure Pond Sect’s or does it belong to the Ning Family? You’d best make that clear! Or are you saying the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal should fall into your hands?"

This person was indeed Si Boxiu, a cultivator of Azure Pond Sect. Now he stood with hands clasped behind his back, responding bluntly with a resounding voice, "This matter is not yours to meddle in!"

At last, Daoist Master Pu Yu spoke, his figure drifting among the misty clouds, he said with a soft voice, "Please, seniors. No need for haste. The Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal is the relic of the late Senior Yuan Su. Naturally, it should be given to his descendants. With so many Daoist Masters present, this is evident to all."

He first turned to the purple-robed female cultivator and said gently, "Fairy Zipei, all of us here shared some degree of kinship with the late Yuan Su. Of course, we would not allow his possession to fall into the wrong hands."

Daoist Master Zipei nodded. After speaking, Pu Yu turned to look at Yuan Xiu, "Senior Yuan Xiu, let this item first be returned to the Ning Family. If Azure Pond still wishes to handle it further, let that be arranged internally within the sect..."

Si Boxiu remained relatively courteous to him, nodding with a neutral expression. Zipei simply flicked her sleeve, sending a wave of violet mist sweeping outward. She glanced coldly around and said, "Everyone need not linger here. No matter what, this item will never fall into the hands of outsiders."

These words seemed directed toward the hidden Purple Mansion Realm cultivators within the great void. A heavy silence followed. Her eyes brimmed with violet radiance as she swept her gaze through the void, seeing through all veils.

Though Li Xuanfeng never raised his head, he heard everything clearly. He had seen many spirit artifacts such as Yuanwu’s Cloudsunder and Binding Ring, and even the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. Yet this seal in his hand likely surpassed even that as it drew so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to covet it.

Zipei was one of the peak cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm. With a single sweeping gaze, she saw all with perfect clarity. Most of those who had been watching from the void quietly withdrew. Several even clasped hands politely before vanishing into the great void.

In just a few seconds, all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators dispersed. Partly out of respect for Zipei’s strength and partly out of wariness toward the Purple Smoke Gate and Azure Pond Sect. Soon, the field cleared except for one lingering figure.

Daoist Master Zipei crossed her arms. At her waist, a violet celestial sword lit up with dazzling brilliance. She spoke in a low voice, "Qing Jifang... What business brings you here from Mount Changhuai?"

As soon as her voice fell, a gray-robed youth appeared. He was holding a floating gray jade pearl that emitted streams of gray mist. He smiled and said, "Surely you jest, senior. Why shouldn't I be here? My Mount Changhuai in the Wu region is also one of the Six Chongming lineages. With such a great event unfolding, it's only right to come investigate and lend a hand."

He had only just appeared, and while the faces of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators remained composed, a sense of unease rose within them. Xiao Chuting held his white jade fishing rod and lowered his gaze as he thought to himself, As expected... even Mount Changhuai’s hidden force has made a move... I wonder if True Monarch Taiyi has already reached the late-stage of the Golden Core Realm... a pity for Shangyuan.

Clearly, the surrounding Purple Mansion Realm cultivators sensed from Qing Jifang’s words that Mount Changhuai had intervened and they each felt a foreboding within, though none let it show on their faces.

Only Qing Jifang remained calm and carefree, standing at ease with the hovering gray pearl in his hand. Though the others didn't express it, he could sense their wariness clearly and so he stood quietly, content.

By now, the situation had evolved beyond the mere ownership of the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal. Even Mount Changhuai’s True Monarch had seemingly become involved, altering the balance instantly. The assembled Daoist Masters fell silent, each deep in thought.

Taking advantage of their momentary distraction, Qing Jifang drifted gently down to the spring’s edge, gazing at the silent Li Xuanfeng and offering a faint smile.

As Qing Jifang looked at the old general with gray-black eyes, sharp brows, and a face subtly weathered from the absence of treasured panaceas, he felt a sudden, strange sense of familiarity. There was a ruthless dominance in the man’s presence that stirred something deep within him.

As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Qing Jifang had long mastered divine sight. A brief glance was enough to uncover the source of this familiarity. He paused, surprised, then smiled incredulously. He exclaimed, "I knew it! This face looked so familiar... What a coincidence. No, how uncanny! So it’s you!"

Li Xuanfeng kept his head lowered, saying nothing. But Qing Jifang burst into laughter and muttered, "Born of a yang father and bore the Three Nine True Talisman. Mother died by yin, with the Shamanic Blood Talisman. Brilliant, truly brilliant. Jiang Boqing’s methods are indeed formidable."

He bared gleaming white teeth and, as if recovering from amusement, called out, "Hand it over."

His laughter and cold demand drew the attention of the Purple Mansion cultivators above. Li Xuanfeng raised his brow and glanced at him but did not move.

Qing Jifang fell silent. Though Li Xuanfeng hadn’t moved at all, the gray mist surrounding him suddenly clashed with an unseen force which produced metallic ringing sounds. Qing Jifang sharply raised a brow and looked skyward.

There he saw Daoist Master Pu Yu in his blue-and-white robe nodding with a gentle smile, forming a spell with two fingers. The gray mist in Qing Jifang’s hand grew more agitated until a violet immortal sword appeared. Held between slender and fair fingers, it pointed directly at him. The sleeve’s purple silk unraveled and dissipated into violet mist.

Daoist Master Zipei stared coldly at him. Her red lips parted as she spoke bluntly, "You're welcome to try."

Though Qing Jifang was only at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm and clearly not a match for Zipei, his stance was firm. He stared in silence. The tension thickened to the point of suffocation. After over ten seconds, he finally said coldly, "You're not afraid, senior?"

Li Xuanfeng waited silently. At last, the golden-robed woman who had remained motionless in the air descended like a breeze, a leaden glow shimmering around her.

Her face remained hidden behind a veil of white gauze, concealing her features as she spoke gently, "Regarding today’s matter, my Golden Feather Sect shares the same view. Since Mount Changhuai is friendly with us... perhaps you could give me this courtesy."

Only after she spoke did Qing Jifang’s expression ease. With the Taibai Star still gleaming in the sky above, he could only reply, "Since this is Senior Qiushui’s stance, let this dharma artifact be handled by the Golden Feather Sect..."

Zhang Qiushui was cautious, unwilling to accept the words directly. She responded softly, "This is a matter for Chongming. I only hope it’s resolved properly, without losing decorum."

With Daoist Master Qiushui stepping in, the confrontation in the sky finally cooled. Qing Jifang gave Zipei a deep look and said quietly, "Your breakthrough is near, Daoist Master. Better to concern yourself with preserving your life."

With that, he pierced into the great void and vanished. Zhang Qiushui saw him off without a word, then calmly produced a crystal-clear jade flask.

She tipped it slightly, pouring a stream of clear wine into the air. The droplets landed on the reef below with crisp sounds, releasing a gentle, intoxicating fragrance.

After emptying the flask, she put it away. Her figure slowly faded until she too disappeared.

For a moment, heaven and earth fell silent. The spring murmured mournfully and the remaining Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the air said nothing. The sound of the flute left behind by Yuan Su’s passing echoed gently over the sea, evoking sorrow.

The flute’s melody clearly carried divine power. Fish and shrimp that leapt from the sea now lay limp on the reef, while faint sobs could be heard from the deep ocean below. Some demonic creatures must have heard the sound and been overwhelmed, they too were wailing at the seafloor.

The remaining Purple Mansion Realm cultivators present were all old acquaintances of Yuan Su. In life, he had been sharp-tongued and fond of sarcasm, not well-liked, so only a few had stayed behind.

None of them used divine ability and mana to resist the flute’s effects. Instead, they allowed themselves to be carried by its pull. As if they were lost in memory, all of them fell silent.

Li Xuanfeng listened for a while, his face tinged with sorrow.

He had followed Yuan Su for a long time. At first, it was more coercion than companionship. But later, Yuan Su had personally sought cultivation techniques and spirit armor for him, treated him as a junior or even kin. Though it was calculated, there was sincerity too. He had helped Li Xuanfeng through many hardships.

In the end, Yuan Su had pushed him to eliminate names on a certain list of cultivators. Yet Li Xuanfeng understood it was to prepare for matters after death. He couldn’t bring himself to hate him. He also knew Yuan Su had taken his uncle Li Chejing into the southern border. But now, everything felt uncertain.

"Hate... who should I hate? Who can I hate? They say everyone has hidden burdens... but if a burden exists, does that absolve guilt?" muttered Li Xuanfeng.

Now that this Purple Mansion Realm backer had passed away, it was impossible not to feel sorrow. Yet within that sorrow, he tasted the searing sting of betrayal. The mourning face of Li Tongya at his uncle’s death flashed before his eyes again. Li Xuanfeng bit his lip until blood spilled.

He remained kneeling on the ground when Zipei appeared beside him, frowning as she said, "Get up... Li Xuanfeng."

In an instant, all of Li Xuanfeng’s emotions vanished. He suppressed them once again into his heart, forming a cold, steely composure. He stood up quietly and said with respectful voice, "Greetings, Daoist Master Zipei!"

Her tone remained curt as she said, "Come with me to the Purple Smoke Gate."

Yuan Xiu's face darkened at once, but Daoist Master Pu Yu quickly stepped in to smooth things over, speaking gently, "How about this. If you both still trust me, let the Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal remain with me. I will accompany you to the Purple Smoke Gate myself.

"Senior Yuan Xiu can return to the sect first to handle matters and bring back Yuan Su’s descendants. The three of us will witness the spirit artifact recognize its master, everything will be proper."

Pu Yu, with his refined features and gentle smile, spoke smoothly. Yuan Xiu considered for a moment, then sighed with reluctant resignation. He waved his sleeve and said to Zipei, "Kan Xuyu... take care of yourself."

His form quickly faded and vanished. Daoist Master Zipei's expression remained unchanged. As Li Xuanfeng stood, still not fully reacting, he suddenly realized the seal had already been passed into Daoist Master Pu Yu’s hand.

He stood silently atop the clouds, listening as Daoist Master Pu Yu clicked his tongue in admiration, studying the seal’s carvings and sighing. He said, "So this is what the true Feathered Serpent looks like! Only the lineage of Daoist Master Donghua would know. After all, the Immortal Mansion’s Lord saw it firsthand. If even his records are inaccurate, then nothing in the world can be trusted."

After a while of praise, he began calculating with finger signs. Li Xuanfeng noticed faint traces of blood appear in Pu Yu’s palm, yet this strange Daoist Master turned the blood into fragments of mana and continued calculating relentlessly.

"Xinyou Lucid Marsh Seal," he murmured... "To convert killing intent into suppression, to use the radiance of twin metals to summon Pristine Water... what a brilliant method. When this seal descends, it births slaughter beneath Xinyou, turning flat ground into a lucid marsh. No wonder it holds the makings of a true Dharma relic."

While he continued studying the seal on his own, Daoist Master Zipei finally spoke after a long pause, "I wondered when you became so kind. Turns out all your roundabout kindness was just to get your hands on this spirit artifact and examine it. Truly meticulous scheming!"

Pu Yu hummed in vague agreement, continuing to observe the seal carefully. The group soon emerged from the great void, reappearing in a realm filled with swirling violet mist.

Jagged peaks rose one after another, large and small, their summits appearing and vanishing within dense violet clouds. The mist coiled and swirled like silk, rising skyward with immortal elegance. Pavilions and towers gleamed with magnificence, and cultivators rode the clouds to and fro. It was a truly celestial scene.

Purple Smoke Blessed Land!

This was clearly the mountain gate of the Purple Smoke Gate. Daoist Master Pu Yu soon lifted his head to take in the view and praised, "What a blessed land indeed. In this very place, True Monarch Taixu attained his Dao and became a True Monarch, founding the Dao of Purple Essence. My grandmaster came to congratulate him, and even brought back a bit of dawn purple qi to craft a dharma artifact for my master."

At the mention of this, Daoist Master Zipei's expression finally softened somewhat. She spoke gently, "How flourishing the Six Chongming lineages once were... and now we've fallen to this. Had the founding patriarch not met with misfortune... perhaps things wouldn’t have ended up this way."

Daoist Master Pu Yu replied with a sigh, "True Monarchs Taiyu and Taixu, what a pity... If they hadn’t passed on one after another, the Green Pine Dao lineage might still have had a chance to rise again."

"Some people simply didn’t want to see it happen!" Zipei replied coldly. The two continued conversing while admiring the blessed land’s scenery, not bothering to avoid Li Xuanfeng listening to their conversation. After a few moments, Zipei finally remembered him and asked in a low voice, "Li Xuanfeng... which Li Family are you from?"
