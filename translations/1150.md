# Chapter 1150: Present Departs Old

His voice echoed through the mountains, stirring the roiling wood-qi. The Daoist Master of the Cheng clan rose to his feet and said through gritted teeth,

"There's no turning back now. I see it clearly—the grand conflict between north and south requires a blade this sharp. As for where that cultivation art came from, and who provided it... I imagine Your Majesty already has an answer."

He took a step back and bowed low, his forehead touching the ground. He sighed.

"If the opportunity arises... I beg Your Majesty, for the sake of our past friendship... please lend him your aid!"

Li Zhouwei stood with his hands clasped behind him, murmuring,

"Sea of Desire... Maha Liangli... Tian Langzhi."

A heavy gloom settled over his heart as the pieces clicked into place.

He had once suspected that Lingmei, the Sword Immortal, was a kinsman. Though he now knew otherwise, he still remembered the debt of gratitude he owed the man. He also understood just how impossibly difficult it would be for the Sword Immortal to avenge such a blood feud in the current climate.

'The Way of Great Desire... they're at the height of their power. In the eyes of the Underworld, he is a fine sword indeed...'

He raised an eyebrow.

"And what is Tian Langzhi's background?"

Cheng Jiuwen heard him and lifted his head, his eyes slightly reddened. He spoke in a low voice.

"He began as an immortal cultivator, following the Jade True path and receiving the inheritance of the ancient Heavenly Lang Terrace Daoist Tradition. He was also skilled in the Way of the Sword before he defected to the Buddhists... Now... he has lived for at least seven lifetimes. It is highly likely he is already an eighth-reincarnation Maha!"

Li Zhouwei frowned.

An eighth-reincarnation Maha!

Within the Buddhist cultivation system, a ninth-reincarnation Maha could enter the Chandana Forest and take a seat beneath the various Dharma Masters, qualified to inherit their position at any moment. An eighth-reincarnation was already among the highest echelon of Buddhist combatants, suppressible only by a perfected divine ability!

It was impossible to know what state Lingmei would be in after his breakthrough, but trying to slay that monster with a newly formed fourth divine ability would be harder than ascending to the heavens. And that wasn't even considering the Peacock Sect at the height of its power backing him. A swordsman can only advance, never retreat, but with his heart-devil involved, the consequences could be catastrophic...

'No wonder Cheng Jiuwen doesn't dare let him break through...'

While Cheng Jiuwen's heart sank at the thought of Lingmei's certain doom, Li Zhouwei's mind latched onto two extremely sensitive Dao lineages.

'Geng and Dui!'

These two Dao lineages, the most volatile in the world, were not merely two paths of Metal Virtue. They were the exclusive domain of the master of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. Lingmei wasn't just a Sword Immortal; he was a Great Daoist Master with a very sensitive identity!

The heir to the late True Monarch Taiyu!

And True Monarch Taiyu's fall pointed directly to the True Monarch of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition!

A flicker of shock and cold light passed through his eyes. He asked softly, 

"Senior Lingmei... which Geng Metal divine ability does he cultivate?"

Cheng Jiuwen slowly shook his head, but the mountain wind carried three faint words to their ears.

"Present Departs Old."

The mountain wind blew cold, and a sudden silence fell between them. Cheng Jiuwen composed his sorrowful expression. Li Zhouwei turned, his golden eyes gazing down from above. He saw a gloomy wind swirl through the mountains, from which a man dressed in black materialized.

The man's features were plain, but a seal of office hung at his waist. His expression was complicated as he spoke in a strained voice,

"Greetings, Your Majesty."

Yang Ruiyi.

Clearly, the news of Li Zhouwei stopping at the Sword Gate with such fanfare had spread across the north and south almost instantly. How could Yang Ruiyi not know?

His complex gaze shifted slightly to the profound pine tree as he said in a low voice,

"Urgent matters call for flexibility. I did not intend to disturb Senior."

A gentle breeze seemed to rustle the pine's needles, but no words came. Only Cheng Jiuwen's expression was one of pure shock. He wasn't surprised by Yang Ruiyi's appearance; besides Ting Province, the Grand General had long held the authority to access the outer rings of several of the Song Kingdom's Purple Mansion grand arrays. No, it was the name of that divine ability!

'Present Departs Old'!

Cheng Jiuwen was a Dui Metal cultivator himself. Geng and Dui were closely related; how could he not recognize this divine ability? Shock and terror filled his heart, driving all other thoughts from his mind. He scrambled to his feet, murmuring,

"'World's Revolution'!"

His face was a mask of grief and elation. He gritted his teeth and demanded, 

"This... You were the one who taught him?!"

Compared to the complexity he'd shown before Li Zhouwei, Yang Ruiyi's face was a mask of calm. He stared at Cheng Jiuwen, his voice indifferent.

"It was inevitable, and it was Cheng Xunzhi's own choice. He is a dignified cultivator at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm; did you think he would have no inkling? When he wielded his sword and channeled his qi, his prowess was extraordinary, reaching a level that would have astonished even Duoling. Do you truly believe he harbored no suspicions?"

His gaze bore into Cheng Jiuwen.

"You know as well as I do. He studied that page on The Sword of Pure Yang Qi, Establishing Yang and Controlling Bitterness day and night. He pondered it endlessly and knew it by heart, yet he could never discover its owner... How could he not have been suspicious!"

"Therefore, it had to be 'Present Departs Old'."

Cheng Jiuwen stood frozen, his eyes filled with doubt as he stared blankly at Yang Ruiyi. The Grand General took a step forward and said with admiration,

"To cast aside the old and establish the new. Shangqing did the same all those years ago, willingly abandoning his status as a noble of Gu Prefecture for the sake of a new beginning. It suits him perfectly."

Cheng Jiuwen remained rooted to the spot, his gaze downcast. He seemed to have a thousand questions but could not voice a single one. He stood there for a long time, and the cold, elegant peak of Sword Gate Mountain fell silent once more.

Yang Ruiyi shifted his gaze, finally forced to meet that pair of golden eyes.

This King Wei, sitting so calmly on a mountain peak, was obviously not here for a leisurely stroll through the Sword Gate. His actions were a clear declaration, a move that had put the entire Yang clan in an impossible position.

In King Wei's situation, any other Daoist Master from Jiangnan would have no choice but to resent Qi Lanyan for the grand strategy, with no opportunity to question the decision. They wouldn't even sense anything amiss with the trade-offs made behind the scenes. But he was different.

Yang Ruiyi had considered that King Wei might be enraged. He had planned to compensate Ting Province after the great battle. He had even considered that Li Zhouwei might march his troops into the White River, trading one crisis for another... He'd even entertained the one-in-a-million chance that Li Zhouwei might sense something, refuse the order, and come to Shanji Prefecture to negotiate.

But Li Zhouwei had instead established his divine ability at the Sword Gate, a declaration to both north and south.

'He's putting on a show for Qi Lanyan.'

Qi Lanyan's goal was to exploit the painful fact that Ting Province had to be defended, coupled with the Underworld's desire to damage Bright Yang's interests, in order to deal Li Zhouwei a crippling blow.

But Li Zhouwei had tossed Ting Province aside like a piece of trash, ignoring all of the Yang clan's directives, and announced to the entire world that he was at the Sword Gate. With this, Qi Lanyan could only choose between Ting Province and Li Zhouwei!

And he, Yang Ruiyi, was facing the exact same choice!

The moment Li Zhouwei displayed his divine ability at the Sword Gate, Yang Ruiyi had no choice but to have him participate in the battle at Shanji. His tacit understanding with Qi Lanyan had its limits. If Li Zhouwei were to retreat to Ting Province now—a province unprotected by Martial Cultivation—then without him, Qi Lanyan's full-scale assault on Shanji would inevitably end in failure, or worse.

Yang Ruiyi raised his head, staring into those golden eyes. Their coldness was a clear warning.

'He doesn't care what becomes of Ting Province. He wants to be the one who decides where the war between north and south is fought. He wants to determine the future course of the entire conflict. He is forcing Guanhua and the Great Song to fight an unprecedented, no-holds-barred war at Baihai Creek!'

He let out a deep sigh. The subtle premonition he'd had was finally coming true—he just never imagined Li Zhouwei would tear off his docile facade so suddenly, bypassing him to put Qi Lanyan in checkmate. And he never thought it would happen so fast.

The Grand General of Song was weighed down by these thoughts, momentarily at a loss for words.

But as he stood there in silence, King Wei rose to his feet. His frame was not overly tall, but with his broad shoulders and trim waist, he cast a long shadow. In the dimness, only his golden eyes glittered.

"Grand General!"

The two words hung in the air, sharp and final, sending a chill deep into Yang Ruiyi's bones. He forced a smile and took a step forward, but the King of Wei wasn't looking at him. His gaze was fixed on the cup in his hand as he said coolly,

"It seems the only 'greater good' left is the one that requires sacrificing for my sake!"

Yang Ruiyi's heart jolted. Staring into those blazing golden eyes, his ominous premonition finally became reality.

'Qi Lanyan calculated the Underworld's interests perfectly. On the surface, he tossed the decision to my Yang clan, but in reality, he gave me no choice at all. What was that, if not a way to drive a wedge between us?'

Now, Li Zhouwei's display of power had thrown the problem right back at them on his clan's behalf. But could he, Yang Ruiyi, admit the Underworld had tacitly approved? Could he shift the blame to those great figures?

Though the cultivators of Jiangnan were oblivious, the two of them were no fools. As soon as Li Zhouwei understood the truth of the matter and refused to be a sacrificial lamb for the Underworld's interests, the facts would be laid bare. The one who had conspired with Qi Lanyan could only be him, Yang Ruiyi!

He took a deep breath, forcing himself to remain calm. There were no more excuses to be made. He said respectfully,

"I am willing to dispatch cultivators to defend Ting Province."

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes bored into him.

"Since the Grand General is so knowledgeable about the northern cultivators' forces," he said quietly, "I'm sure you can protect Ting Province well."

Yang Ruiyi lowered his head, understanding the unspoken threat. He fell silent.

Li Zhouwei watched him quietly.

He hadn't come to the Sword Gate alone without confidence!

By establishing his Bright Yang here, he was sending Qi Lanyan another message: regardless of whether the Yang clan had schemed against the Li clan before, with Bright Yang standing tall, a confrontation between them was now inevitable.

'Wang Ziya can't cross the river; he can only support Qi Lanyan from Jianghuai. Yang Ruiyi... he knows the northern deployments... but Qi Lanyan does not know the southern layout under the shroud of Exiled Qi.'

Once the Yang and Li clans had their confrontation, an attack on Ting Province became impossible for Qi Lanyan. Under these circumstances, the Great Song would never allow him to destroy the province. However many men he had at the White River, Yang Ruiyi would have just as many to counter them, perhaps even taking command personally. And with Li Zhouwei at Shanji, the undefended Baihai Creek would be free for the taking!

This was the complete opposite of Qi Lanyan's original goal. He would be better off fighting a major battle at Baihai Creek, where he might at least have a chance to target Li Zhouwei in the chaos!

'From this moment on, the only possible outcome is a great battle between Song and Zhao at Baihai Creek!'

Of course, even though Li Zhouwei had Qi Lanyan completely figured out, he couldn't bet everything on his opponent behaving as expected. He shifted his golden gaze and said,

"I will defend Lake Xian."

'This presents a difficult choice for Qi Lanyan, but for me, it's easy to handle. Yang Ruiyi isn't the only one who knows the northern situation. I have the Spirit Probe!'

By defending Lake Xian, Li Zhouwei would hold the geographical advantage, overlooking the entire tactical situation at Xuanmiao Temple from a superior position. Meanwhile, Li Jiangqian would guard the river, providing a view of the deployments at the White River, preventing the possibility of Qi Lanyan flying into a rage and trying to spite him out of sheer frustration.

With this double guarantee, he could even supervise Yang Ruiyi's deployments on the lake!

Yang Ruiyi understood. He knew Li Zhouwei wanted to constantly remind Qi Lanyan that he was on the eastern front. He clasped his hands in agreement.

"As Your Majesty wishes."

As the words fell, King Wei dissolved like smoke into flashes of radiance. Yang Ruiyi watched him go with a complicated expression, his gaze falling upon the shimmering surface of the lake to the north.

A brilliant Celestial Gate, covered in profound patterns, was rising majestically!

The sight made Yang Ruiyi close his eyes, his lips moving silently. He heard a soft thud and saw that Cheng Jiuwen had prostrated himself on the ground. With a complex gaze, he said in a low, earnest voice,

"The Sages of the Underworld write with the strokes of a dragon, bringing peace to the world. We minor cultivators can only obey, willing to be their treasured swords... We only hope... we only hope! That our sharp blades may one day return to their sheaths!"

This Daoist Master of the Sword Gate, usually so cold and stern, had sensed an extreme danger and did not hesitate to bow before him. At that moment, Yang Ruiyi was still immersed in his anxiety over the loss of control. As his eyes fell upon the man, he felt a surprising pang of pity, a sense of shared misfortune.

'Return to their sheaths... How many of us can? Me? Cheng Xunzhi? Li Zhouwei? Even... the Emperor?'

But the imperial descendant of the Yang clan, the direct heir of the Underworld, remained silent. He took a step back and vanished like mist, leaving Cheng Jiuwen to straighten up, still kneeling on the ground, his expression cold and sharp.

…

"Clang!"

A clear, bright chime echoed in the night sky. On the mountaintop, a Daoist quietly held a small bronze bell, his expression serene. In the distance, the Celestial Gate stood upon the lake's surface, its heavenly light reflecting in his pupils.

'A pity it's Lake Xian, and not Moongaze Lake.'

He gazed at the shimmering heavenly light, as if seeing past the hazy white veil to a pair of cold, golden eyes—eyes without a trace of hesitation or pity, casting aside the great lake that birthed and raised him, his fierce, ambitious gaze staring like a wolf or a tiger at the vast lands of Jianghuai.

A touch of wistfulness entered his expression, but he could see no hint of the divine ability's colors from the south. The disciple behind him stood silent for a long moment before asking timidly,

"Master... the reinforcements from the White River..."

Perhaps it was Wang Ziya sighing and shaking his head nearby, or perhaps Qi Lanyan's mindset had changed completely. He did not get angry. Instead, he said very calmly,

"Have them return for now."

Fan Kang, as if granted a great amnesty, hurried away. Wang Ziya stood with his hands behind his back and said softly,

"Such a fast reaction."

Qi Lanyan showed no regret. His gaze was calm as he said,

"He is Li Zhouwei."

Wang Ziya frowned.

"A pity..."

"No pity."

Qi Lanyan stared intently at the riverbank.

"I've said it before. If he's at Baiye Creek, I'll fight him at Baiye Creek. If he's at Baijiang Creek, I'll fight him at Baijiang Creek. Now that he's at Lake Xian, I'll fight him there all the same. It will be nothing more than a battle unseen in five hundred years. At least for now, I still have the upper hand."

"Besides..."

He suddenly smiled, the silk ribbon at his waist floating gently, gathering wisps of immortal light.

"This incident won't be without consequences. At the very least, it leaves a mark on the Underworld's attitude. Once is a precedent, and twice is a pattern. Once trust is broken, it can never be fully restored."

"He might not be ignorant of the Underworld's ill intentions," Wang Ziya said.

Hearing his Martial Uncle's words, Qi Lanyan replied,

"The key isn't that he understands. It's that the Underworld knows he understands. The Underworld was united in their stance on Li Qianyuan, but their attitude toward him is ambiguous. But for those great figures, suspicion is as good as guilt. The entire point is to make them suspicious."

Wang Ziya drew a sharp breath. He watched as Qi Lanyan straightened up, his eyes burning bright, fixed firmly on the myriad rays of heavenly light that shot into the sky from the lake's surface.

"As for now... we shall see who comes out on top."
