# Chapter 923: Settling All Affairs

Li Zhouwei sat on Mount Dali for some time, making significant gains before he bid farewell to Qingyu Qian. He descended the mountain with the White Ape, departing amidst the respectful murmurs of the Demon beasts lining the path.

'The Dragon-Fox Pact certainly exists, but the foxes are clearly leaning toward neutrality,' he mused. 'Even if pressured to align with the Dragon-kin, they just want to live in seclusion on Mount Dali and avoid the world's affairs as much as possible…'

'This isn't just a gap in strength; it's a geographical limitation. The Dragon-kin, even in their decline, still possess an entire sea. Mount Dali, however, is only by a lake. They dare not get too involved in Bright Yang matters…'

He turned his head slightly toward the White Ape and asked in a low voice, "Did you manage to find out anything?"

The White Ape immediately bowed, his voice aged. "I heard the Demon beasts in the caves say… there is another great king in the mountains, even more formidable than the Demon King Tingfu. He is said to have fur as white as snow and a noble bloodline, but he has not shown himself in recent years. As for anything more… it is difficult to say if it is true or false."

'Even more formidable…'

Li Zhouwei immediately understood the implications.

'Qingyu Qian is already preparing to cross the immortal threshold. That means this hidden Demon King must be at the Four Divine Abilities level, at least. Add to that the fox clan's old ancestor, who may have received guidance from an immortal… their strength is truly considerable…'

'And Elder Bai Rong reached the stage of nurturing a divine ability just one hundred years after his Foundation Establishment. That's nothing for a human, but for a Demon beast, whose cultivation speed is inferior, he is an incredible genius… He has likely benefited immensely from the Dragon-Fox Pact.'

Although he had not met Bai Rong this time, he had gathered a great deal of information and gained a clearer understanding of the greater situation. He traveled as a beam of light, reflecting inwardly.

'In the end, everyone has their own interests. I must listen to all sides if I am to find an opening in this predicament…'

He returned to the lake, still lost in thought. He rode the light, tore open a path through the Great Void, and landed on Qingdu Peak. The small courtyard was somewhat desolate. He saw an old man by the door who had set out two wooden racks, apparently sunning a suit of armor.

Li Zhouwei had actually seen Li Xuanxuan once upon his initial return, but they'd had no time to talk before he had to hurry off to the mountain. Now, bearing news of Bai Rong, he landed in the courtyard.

"Daoist Master, you've come."

Li Xuanxuan's spirits seemed low, but he still managed a smile. "Although everyone said you would reach the Purple Mansion Realm, your breakthrough still made people worry. Seeing you standing right here truly sets my heart at ease."

The wrinkles on his face bunched together. Despite all kinds of restorative medicines, the old man's vitality had not been strong in recent years. Coupled with his constant worrying, he looked even more aged.

"It is all thanks to the old master's great fortune and protection," Li Zhouwei replied with utmost respect. He glanced at the armor in the courtyard and realized it was perfectly ordinary—mortal armor.

Li Xuanxuan smiled. "It's the armor from my youth, from the campaign against the Eastern Yue. I like to sun it when I have time. Even though the clan's bureaus use dharma power to maintain it, keeping it spotless, it just… lacks a certain something."

Li Zhouwei offered a word of praise. Li Xuanxuan sighed and sat down, shaking his head in sorrow. "A pity about Chenghao. Zhoufang hasn't been able to leave his house these days, completely overcome with grief. He has always been so diligent… I have never seen him like this."

Li Zhouwei was momentarily speechless. Li Chenghao had not been popular in the family, his cultivation was low, and all his children were dead. In the entire clan, only Li Zhoufang was still grieving for him so intensely.

Li Zhouwei could only reply, "This debt will be repaid, sooner or later. For now, we should arrange Jiangzong's affairs as soon as possible. That should provide some comfort to Big Brother."

Li Xuanxuan fell silent, then said in a hoarse voice, "You are a Daoist Master now. Your brothers and elders are all afraid of you. Not only do they not dare to speak with you, but they whisper behind his back that Zhoufang doesn't know what's good for him. Many of those people were promoted by him or received protection through his efforts. It's as if his decades of hard work meant nothing. It is good that you have this sentiment."

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flickered. "This junior understands."

He took a step forward, picked up the brush pen from the table, and smoothed a sheet of paper with his other hand. With a light touch, the brush moved like a dragon, swiftly writing a single vertical line of eight characters:

*'Great desire is emptiness; this enmity must be avenged.'*

As he finished writing, the paper immediately became soft and fine, like silk, glowing with a snow-white luster and a faint golden light. Li Zhouwei turned his head and said softly, "The family has delayed giving an order because they fear someone has surrendered to the Buddhists. They are afraid of praising him too highly, only to have it cause an uproar later. But since the old master has spoken, it is also wrong to simply ignore it. When I return to Gardenia Scenery Mountain, I will send this calligraphy to my uncle's grave."

Li Xuanxuan nodded and sighed. Li Zhouwei chatted for a few more moments, relaying the news about Bai Rong and inquiring about the old man's health. He did not leave from the courtyard but instead stepped into the Great Void, reappearing on Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

At this moment, Gardenia Scenery Mountain was covered in gardenias. The jade tables, usually empty, were now piled high with a dazzling array of dharma artifacts and cultivation arts. Beside them stood several large chests, filled with countless treasure medicines.

The Heavenly Light on the mountain was inherently bright; illuminated by all these treasures, the entire peak was truly glowing.

Li Zhouwei scanned the scene, knowing instantly that these were congratulatory gifts from various sects and cultivators. Anything that made it to Gardenia Scenery Mountain was no ordinary item. Most were from powers on the level of the Three Sects and Seven Gates, or from Purple Mansion rogue cultivators. The lesser gifts had, of course, been sent to the clan treasury.

'So lively! I wonder how many of them forced me out of the lake, and how many only stopped when they saw me enter the sea!'

He had not held a banquet and had used "secluded cultivation" as an excuse to refuse all Purple Mansion visitors. But this display wasn't because of some Jiangnan custom; it was because *everyone*—related and unrelated, from Jiangnan and Jiangbei—had come to offer congratulations. Judging by the sight before him, even after filtering out all the worthless items, the remaining gifts were far more substantial than those Li Ximing had received when he achieved his Dao.

The world was fickle, and human relationships were thinner than paper. When Li Ximing reached Foundation Establishment, he was a nobody, so when he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, people were still watching coldly, waiting for a show. Now, they were all shamelessly fawning over him. Even a few of the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions that prided themselves on their righteousness could not escape the custom, and their gifts were heavier than before.

He reached out, picked up the bound gift register, and read through it carefully.

'Everyone from all of Jiangbei and the Yue State, with the exception of the Changxiao Gate and the sealed Snow Wings Gate, has sent their respects. Even the devastated Sacred Writ Gate sent someone…'

'Outside the Yue State, there is Shahuan, Slaughter Jun, Jingyi… even Dingyang Zi from Qize sent a gift. There's even an unrelated Ni family from the Wu State…'

He read the list from top to bottom, from west to east; countless small clans had come to congratulate him. From north to south, innumerable small sects had sent their best wishes. Looking at the list, it seemed as though not a single person wished him ill.

'Never mind the enemies. Of the more amicable parties, only Chunyi, Southern Songzhou Luoshe, and a few others made no move. As for the gifts, only Slaughter Jun, the Xiao Family, and other close allies sent what was expected, without any particular extravagance…'

He raised his sleeve and, without ceremony, swept this first great haul into it. These items might not be of great value to a Purple Mansion cultivator, but they were more than enough to be used as rewards or to bestow upon subordinates.

As for the few chests of treasure medicines, they were not of much use to him, so he left them there for Li Ximing to use in alchemy.

He then placed the eight-character calligraphy into a jade box and dispatched someone to deliver it. He also asked after Li Ximing, learning that he had already taken a pill and entered seclusion.

Li Zhouwei thus remained on the mountain for several days, studying the Radiant Celestial Wave Art and the Arranged-Mansions Celestial Yang Escape Art. Light and darkness alternated, and time flowed by. Soon, Chen Yang came up to report, kneeling on the stone steps of the mountain.

Neither Li Zhouwei nor Li Ximing had any specific arrangements for such things, but as they were in high positions and their divine abilities were respected, their subordinates dared not be anything but thorough. When Li Ximing was on the mountain, Ding Weizeng would report. Now that Li Zhouwei was present, Chen Yang came.

The black-robed man knelt respectfully. "Reporting to the Daoist Master. The artisan from the Purple Smoke Gate has returned. The dharma artifact is repaired."

"Present it."

Li Zhouwei set down the jade slip in his hand. Two men worked together to carry the Grand Ascension up the steps. Its circular arc gleamed, bright and pure, instantly filling the mountain with a radiant, curved light.

The golden-eyed young man simply raised his hand. The Grand Ascension immediately flew up from its stand and landed obediently in his palm. The Daoist Master weighed it. "Not bad."

The damage to the Grand Ascension had not been severe; the blade had merely been slightly skewed. After being nourished by his divine ability for a time, repairing it had not required much effort. But with his simple approval, the artifact refiner could return and report his mission a success. He bowed deeply.

Li Zhouwei asked casually, "What of the Viewing Pavilion Platform? Have the people arrived?"

Chen Yang was perceptive and knew exactly what he was asking. "Daoist Master Qiuhu has already appeared at Azure Pond Mountain. After receiving the Daoist Master's letter, Chu Minglian arrived at the lake last night. He is currently awaiting your orders."

Li Zhouwei waved his hand, dismissing the Purple Smoke cultivator, who kept his head bowed low. "How are Daoist Master Qiuhu's injuries?"

When this topic was raised, Chen Yang immediately prostrated himself, lowering his voice. "It is said there are no unusual signs… however… the Azure Pond Sect has promoted Ning Wan's confidant, Lin Wuning, to be the Peak Master of Yuanxing Peak. The position of Peak Master of Qi-Plucking Peak was given to Lord Yuanqin. The personnel from the Eastern Sea have all returned… The previous Peak Master of Yuanxing Peak was a Ning family junior who made a complete mess of things. He was dismissed."

Li Zhouwei silently shook his head. "The Si family has few descendants, and Si Yuanli may not even come out of seclusion. Elder Qiuhu wants to cultivate a few Ning family members, but Elder Yuansu has no heirs. With Hejing and Heyuan dead, and a large batch of people purged, the spine of that faction has been broken… If Zhao Tinggui had lived to this day, there might have been a chance, but the situation is difficult to salvage now."

However, the Ning family's affairs were not his to manage. Ning Wan still had a long life ahead of her. As long as her divine ability did not fall, she would have plenty of time to promote her people. Hearing the good news about Ning Wan's health, Li Zhouwei tapped his cup, deep in thought.

'This one spirit embryo… it's not enough.'

The Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire was extremely useful. It allowed a Foundation Establishment cultivator to assist a Purple Mansion cultivator in the refining process. With the spiritual materials on hand, Li Zhouwei didn't even need to expend much energy. An occasional tap with his divine ability would be enough to forge a spirit embryo aligned with his own power.

But there were two problems. First, the spiritual materials were limited. Once this batch was used up, he would have to use his own divine ability to refine more, a process that would take over a decade and seriously delay his cultivation. Second, a spirit embryo was not like a Spiritual Artifact; it required constant nourishment from his divine ability. One was manageable, but any more than that would also impede his cultivation.

Li Zhouwei currently had two great treasures he had carried up from the Foundation Establishment Realm: the Grand Ascension and the Yuan'e. One was a weapon, the other a suit of armor. Both were suitable for nurturing a spirit embryo.

'The Grand Ascension definitely comes first. But the Yuan'e armor is no longer of much use to me as it is. It also needs to be refined. A spirit embryo consumes divine ability… it would be best if I could upgrade it to a Spiritual Artifact.'

He dismissed Chen Yang. Stepping through the Great Void, he arrived at the Viewing Pavilion Platform. With a gentle toss, he set the dharma artifact upon the high platform, his mind churning.

"Should I go and ask Hengzhu… or Golden Feather… And how could I possibly afford the price?"

A moment later, the burly, red-clothed old man had arrived on the platform. Facing Li Zhouwei, Chu Minglian was clearly not as relaxed as he was with Li Ximing. He bowed, nervous and subservient.

Li Zhouwei activated his divine ability. The platform was instantly bathed in golden light, enveloping the dharma artifact. He glanced to the side and noticed a young man standing properly beside Chu Minglian, who now looked rather excited. The young man bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

This young man was, of course, Li Jiangzong. Li Jiangqian had already arranged for him to study under this refining master, saving Li Zhouwei the trouble of giving the order. He now looked somewhat ashamed as he bowed again. "The Daoist Master's single letter cured my father's heart-sickness. This junior is endlessly grateful!"

Li Jiangzong found it difficult to understand his father's obsessive loyalty to their grand-uncle, Li Chenghao. As his own cultivation had risen, he had gradually entered the family's center of power. He was on a path of steady advancement and being entrusted with important duties; he was naturally mindful of the family's many kindnesses to him. His father's recent behavior had been an extreme headache, a thorn in his back. Yet, it was impossible to say his father was *wrong*, so he could only go along with Li Zhoufang's dramatics.

Fortunately, Li Zhouwei's eight-character calligraphy had been delivered to the gravesite. Li Zhoufang had spat out a large mouthful of blood and had finally begun to recover. Li Jiangzong's daily, agonizing headache was at last resolved, and his admiration for his Daoist Master uncle had grown even deeper.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him, appearing satisfied. He asked a few questions about his cultivation and said softly, "Apply yourself diligently. Reach Foundation Establishment soon."

He had just finished speaking when Ding Weizeng approached and whispered, 

"Reporting to the Daoist Master. A direct disciple from the Great Xiukui Monastery has been waiting at the lake for a long time. He refuses to leave, insisting he must see one of the lake's Purple Mansion cultivators."

Li Zhouwei frowned. "He *must* see a Daoist Master?"

Ding Weizeng nodded. Li Zhouwei could only sigh. "Then let him come up."

After all, the Great Xiukui Monastery had just sacrificed one of its Purple Mansion cultivators. Li Zhouwei still felt a measure of respect for them. As soon as he agreed, a black-robed man riding a gray wind approached from the distance, led by the lake patroller, Qu Bushi. He landed before them and bowed deeply.

"Greetings, Daoist Master Minghuang! This junior cultivator, Lin Ya of the Great Xiukui Monastery, has come on my master's orders to pay respects and offer congratulations!"

Li Zhouwei had not held a banquet, but he had already collected the gifts on the mountain. He frowned. "Daoist Master Zhaojing is healing, and I am in seclusion stabilizing my cultivation. We have not been active on the lake. We have made your esteemed monastery wait!"

"Not at all! We wouldn't dare!" Lin Ya hurriedly demurred, not daring to waste the Daoist Master's time with pleasantries. He immediately took a glittering golden box from his sleeve and said in a low voice, "My master heard that Daoist Master Zhaojing was injured and was extremely concerned. He specially ordered me to deliver two spirit pills, as a sign of the friendship and concern between our two clans."

He gently used his dharma power to open the lid. Inside lay two brilliant white pills etched with fine patterns. They were Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills!

The Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill had come from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. Its greatest effects were to advance cultivation and, crucially, to repair the dharma body. It was clearly a pill commonly used by the Purple Mansion cultivators of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, and the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions had acquired the most. Their clan had obtained three; the last one had been consumed by Li Ximing and was gone.

Li Zhouwei himself had used this very pill to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. He was extremely familiar with it. The pill's ability to heal the dharma body was incredibly enviable, and what's more, it was inherently of the Bright Yang Dao.

He began to voice a polite refusal, but the disciple from the Great Xiukui Monastery immediately adopted a look of terror, emphatically expressing the monastery's sincere goodwill. Only then did Qu Bushi step forward to receive the pills.

Having presented the gift, Lin Ya secretly let out a sigh of relief. He continued respectfully, "My master also bid me to inform the lake that the Gao family's Daoist Master has already left Chengyun Marsh. The Chengyun Gate has already submitted to the Huai River Dao and has sent its name to the Profound Governance Pavilion, acknowledging itself as a sect of the Zhao State."

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, though upon careful consideration, it was not particularly surprising.

Lin Ya continued, "It is said that King Bolie has now gone to the Capital immortals Dao and is meeting with Daoist Master Yehui within the sect."

The rest did not need to be said. With the Chengyun Gate setting a precedent, they were presumably also discussing the matter of allegiance. Li Zhouwei nodded. "I am aware. Thank you to your esteemed monastery for the reminder."

He watched Lin Ya ride the wind and depart, then tucked the box into his sleeve, his mind working.

'Yehui's judgment wasn't wrong; in fact, it was extremely precise. The Gao family coordinating with the Buddhist cultivators' push south was just a "good cop, bad cop" routine…'

'As for the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill… the Great Xiukui Monastery has explicitly stated that the pill recipe is in the hands of the Golden Feather Sect. They themselves are still using the Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill. While that pill has the advantage of being convenient and cheap, it cannot hold a candle to this one when it comes to healing the dharma body… It would be best if I could trade for the recipe from Golden Feather.'

He mulled this over, then glanced at Qu Bushi and said softly, "Is there any movement on the north shore?"

Qu Bushi replied quickly, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, there is no major movement from the north. However, every few days, a few Master Monks come south to harass us, attempting to bypass the lake for reconnaissance. They have clashed with the garrisoned cultivators on the north shore several times, but there have been no major casualties."

Li Zhouwei was not in a particular hurry to cultivate; his main priority was to master the few new Dharma Arts he possessed. Therefore, he had no special requirements for his cultivation location. He nodded.

"I will go to the north shore and stand guard."

But in his heart, he held a more hidden concern.

'If someone from Mount Luoxia wishes to see me, it would be best if they did not enter our great array. They shouldn't even get close to Pingya Island or the south shore… It would save a lot of trouble.'

…

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

The pavilion was brightly lit, with stone lamps casting circles of cool, clear light. Li Ximing sat within, slowly opening his eyes and exhaling a long breath of white mist.

The Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill was a spirit pill for healing the dharma body. Furthermore, his severed body parts had already been retrieved thanks to Yehui's favor, making the restoration process a hundred times simpler.

Added to that was the dense Spiritual Qi within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. In merely half a year, his dharma body was essentially healed. He stood up, feeling a sense of comfort and fluidity throughout his body. The stiffness and discordance that had plagued him were finally gone.

With a turn of his thoughts, he departed that space and reappeared within the lightning-wreathed Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda. He emerged to find a woman in a red dress sitting cross-legged outside the main hall, quietly waiting while cultivating.

It was Li Minggong, returned from Qize.

Hearing the stirring of his arrival, the woman immediately opened her eyes and said respectfully, "Junior has returned from Qize and has an important matter to report!"

Li Ximing, his dharma body fully repaired, was in an excellent mood. He smiled and nodded, raising a hand. A sheet of bright light gently lifted her to her feet. With a single step, he was back on the mountain.

Gardenia Scenery Mountain still had its familiar appearance of white flowers and jade tables. However, one glance was enough to see a brilliant light glowing from the distant Viewing Pavilion Platform, where the flames of creation burned bright. It was clear the process of forging the spirit embryo had begun. Li Ximing arrived leisurely, only to find several chests of treasure medicines at his feet.

"What is this…"

Li Minggong hurriedly explained, "These are the congratulatory spiritual items for Daoist Master Minghuang! The Daoist Master gave instructions to leave them for you, my lord, to use for alchemy."

Li Ximing clasped his hands behind his back and looked closely at the contents. He immediately sensed something was amiss and cursed, "A bunch of snobs! What? *Now* they know how to send proper gifts?"

Li Minggong was inherently intelligent and naturally understood his meaning. She had, after all, handled the congratulatory gifts when Li Ximing himself achieved his divine ability. Though those gifts had also been packed in chests, the quality of the treasure medicines had been nowhere near what lay before her now. She immediately lowered her gaze, saying nothing.

Fortunately, Li Ximing's flash of irritation passed. He motioned for her to sit and asked, "How did it go?"

Li Minggong quickly replied, "The Daoist Master was overjoyed and praised you endlessly, calling your alchemy skills truly divine… He immediately had his people retrieve the items and personally wrote a letter of thanks for me to bring back and present to you."

"Oh?" Li Ximing was not surprised. He watched her take out two jade boxes and a letter. With a flick of his finger, the letter flew into his hand. He began to read it carefully:

"…Fellow Daoist's skill in the Dao of alchemy… is truly the rarest I have seen in my life… a peerless talent… The quality of this pill is something I have never before witnessed! To use Bright Yang fire to refine a Pit Water pill… only a true grandmaster could accomplish such a feat…"

The letter went on, filled with page after page of flowery praise. The more he read, the stranger he felt. He couldn't help but laugh out loud, teasing the red-dressed woman beside him, "How boring! This must have been ghostwritten! That old stick-in-the-mud Dingyang Zi is far too stern and humorless. How could he possibly say such things!"

"He must have just pointed to a smooth-talking disciple and ordered him to write it!"

How could Li Minggong possibly dare to laugh at a joke between Daoist Masters? She shrank in on herself like a quail, eyes fixed on her own nose, silently praying for mercy. But as Li Ximing joked and scanned the letter, he suddenly froze.

It turned out the old fellow had included another request at the very end, swearing that there would be a generous reward, and had even attached the spiritual materials with the letter, begging for more treasure pills…

"So he's gotten a taste and has *this* in mind!"

He lightly tapped his finger. The jade boxes beside him flew open. One contained supplementary herbs, which he ignored. The other revealed glistening black scales. They were Cangzhou Serpent Scales! Three whole scales!

"That Dingyang Zi! He must have connections in Cangzhou!"

Li Ximing was startled, but then he laughed heartily. The last time had been a favor to help refine a spirit embryo. This time, he could openly demand payment. He immediately pulled out a brush and paper. As he wrote, he instructed Li Minggong, "You go and tell that Dingyang Zi that Bright Yang and Pit Water inherently clash. That last batch I sent him was a gesture of gratitude for him refining my spirit embryo. I was feeling generous and didn't want to disappoint his request, so I used a unique secret method and even threw in a considerable amount of my *own* Pit Water spiritual items to refine six pills! How can he expect that every time? He wants six pills again? That's not happening!"

Li Minggong nodded quickly, understanding that he was negotiating.

Li Ximing shook his head and continued, "You just go and give him this reply: for these three Cangzhou Serpent Scales, I will give him twelve pills, minimum. If he wants me to dip into my own family's stash of materials, I can give him fifteen, tops. He can decide for himself how he wants to repay me."

"Yes!"

Li Minggong accepted the letter he had written, bowed respectfully, and immediately flew off on her True Fire. Li Ximing, his mood steadily improving, summoned Ding Weizeng.

"Where is Minghuang?"

Ding Weizeng bowed quickly. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, he is currently standing guard on the north shore."

Li Ximing-nodded. He rose into the air on a beam of light. Closing his eyes, the vision he had seen in the grotto-heaven reappeared before his mind's eye: an endless expanse where sea and sky merged into one, a long chain of reefs, and a boundless stretch of azure blue.

'The Strait of Ten Thousand Isles!'
