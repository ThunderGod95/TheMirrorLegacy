# Chapter 1140: The Water of the Spring of Rebirth

‘Changli.’

Li Ximing listened with a smile and nodded, but Li Zhouwei turned, shaking his head.

“Since you’ve decided, then Changli it is,” he said. “Our family is built upon the clan. We’re not like the Golden Feather Sect with its two distinct Dao-paths. Since we already have generation names, there’s no need to start a tradition of Daoist titles. That would only disrupt our customs.”

Li Jiangqian offered a faint smile.

“It’s just that my younger brothers all have the potential for the Purple Mansion Realm. If we brothers can share that, it would lessen any distance between us…”

At the mention of affairs between the brothers, Li Ximing simply turned his head and pretended not to hear. Li Zhouwei shot him a glance and said,

“Since he’s a Holder of the Profound, that’s a matter for the Yang clan. We will not interfere.”

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian clasped his hands quite naturally.

“I’ll remember that.”

He then took his seat. Li Ximing first pressed a jade slip into his hand for him to read carefully. Li Jiangqian memorized its contents and, without needing any prompting from his elders, crushed the jade slip in his palm. Only then did Li Ximing nod and begin to recount the events of the past few years.

Li Jiangqian held his cup and listened for some time. When he heard his elder mention in passing how Li Zhouwei had annihilated the fifth-generation Maha, body and soul, with a single swing of his battle-axe, he couldn't help but swallow a mouthful of tea.

“Since Vast Cicada was a treasured figure to a powerhouse in the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, this matter can’t possibly be over,” Li Jiangqian said.

“In terms of interests, they no longer have a reason to contest our family and have withdrawn from the northern coalition. But monks like them are obsessed with cause and effect. The failure of such a great figure carries immense significance… they are the ones we must be most wary of.”

Li Zhouwei was not surprised, but Li Ximing grew pensive and nodded gravely.

“You have a point…”

A momentary silence fell over the hall. Li Jiangqian was eager to finally see the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance he had longed for, but since the two Daoist Masters made no move, he waited in silence.

Li Zhouwei stood with his hands clasped behind his back, slowly walking out of the main hall. He paused at the entrance, his gaze fixed quietly on the horizon.

Li Jiangqian felt a flicker of doubt, but Li Ximing’s expression shifted slightly. He motioned for him to remain calm, then rose and stood at the front of the hall, waiting as well.

The setting sun sank rapidly below the horizon, swallowed by the encroaching darkness. Long after the last sliver of red had vanished, the two familiar figures they were expecting had yet to appear. A glint of understanding flashed in Li Ximing’s eyes as he lowered his head in thought.

The golden-eyed youth waited patiently until the dead of night before a smile of amusement touched his lips.

“So, they really can’t perceive Jiangqian?”

Li Ximing hesitated for a moment.

“That is… interesting.”

They weren't waiting for just anyone. They were waiting for emissaries from the Underworld. The two Underworld emissaries, Zhang Gui and Wang Long, were responsible for overseeing all Purple Mansion breakthroughs in this region. The Underworld was a terrifying place, its reach all-encompassing. Not a single cultivator who broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm in Jiangnan could escape their notice. Li Zhouwei had once asked Dingjiao about it, and the Dragon Prince had told him:

“Every person in the world is recorded on a list in the Underworld. For those who cultivate the path of the Purple Mansion and the Golden Core, the Underworld can even know their exact cultivation level and the arts they practice!”

The Underworld likely used this list to keep track of Purple Mansion cultivators and manage the Quest for Gold.

“When Great-Granduncle broke through, Zhang Gui and Wang Long came here,” Li Zhouwei continued. “Judging by their conduct, both emissaries are likely trusted agents of the Yang family. They revealed two things… First, Yang Tianya. They knew a storm was coming and that the Azure Pond Sect was on the verge of decline. By revealing the existence of a Purple Mansion cultivator from the Yang family, their goal was to prevent friction between our families and avoid chaos in the turbulent times ahead.”

“And the second thing?”

“That… there was no name.”

Li Jiangqian listened quietly from the side as Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

“You mean… it’s likely that his name is not on their list either?”

The youth paced a few steps.

“This list of theirs can be avoided even by the Shaman-Register Dao and the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature,” he said in a low voice. “It certainly wouldn’t contain the names of True Monarchs. The status of a Talisman Seed is exceedingly high. Even that dignitary from the Yang family couldn’t perceive it directly, so it’s only natural that they failed to record you or me.”

“There’s one other possibility… the Azure Insight Origin Mirror.”

At these words, Li Jiangqian’s eyebrows twitched. Li Zhouwei’s expression was grim.

“Whether it’s the former, the latter, or a combination of the two, the Underworld has little control over Ting Province—a place where even the Martial Cultivation Star dares not shine. If that’s the case, then the Underworld, which is otherwise unstoppable, can only rely on observing phenomena to determine if someone has achieved a breakthrough!”

Li Jiangqian processed this and fell into contemplation. After a long while, he said,

“Then this is a good thing. I suspect the moment I take a single step off this lake, the Underworld will know.”

The three of them waited until dawn, but the figures from the Underworld never appeared. Leaving Li Zhouwei to continue cultivating in the hall and watch over the mortal world, Li Ximing finally led Li Jiangqian into the domain.

Even after cultivating here for many years, Li Ximing was still struck by the sheer density of the spiritual energy upon re-entry, to say nothing of Li Jiangqian, who was visiting for the first time. His expression changed.

With a simple gesture, he asked in astonishment,

“Yin and yang… perfectly balanced?”

Li Ximing had experienced something similar before, so the sensation wasn't as profound for him. For Li Jiangqian, however, it was the first time in his life he had felt such a perfect equilibrium. It felt strangely alien. He closed his eyes and exhaled deeply. When he opened them again, two faint red lights flickered within his pupils.

“Great-Granduncle… since entering this place, my Radiant Fire divine ability has become both more vigorous and more gentle.”

“Oh?”

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. He watched as Li Jiangqian, his eyes shining with a rare intensity, looked around, ascended the steps, and made his way to the High Firmament Pavilion. He lightly touched the jade platform, and a tremor ran through his body.

An unknown amount of time passed before he opened his eyes again, a look of profound shock lingering within them. He remained silent for a long time, then turned his head abruptly. Li Ximing was standing quietly behind him, his gaze calm and deep.

Li Jiangqian was silent for a moment before hearing him laugh.

“I’ve already checked for you. The family possesses the Great Scripture of Radiance and the Grasp of Ninefold Heaven. The other three—Position Arising from Entanglement, Burning Annihilation, and Concordant Conquest—are all here in the pavilion, complete.”

Li Jiangqian nodded, a strange look on his face.

“Position Arising from Entanglement and Concordant Conquest… Radiant Fire cultivators aren’t known for manipulating fate… yet there are two Life Divine Abilities!”

Li Ximing had never considered that point. He pondered it now.

“True… When your father gave me the Southern Emperor’s Profound Snare Method, he mentioned that the trigrams Dui (Reflecting Metal), Kan (Pit Water), and Li (Radiant Fire) form a single entity. Now that you bring it up, Pit Water cultivators are also famous for their abundance of Life Divine Abilities…”

Li Jiangqian seemed lost in thought. He nodded in understanding and, without further hesitation, walked into the pavilion. He sat cross-legged, took out the Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam, and began to read it intently. Within four hours, he had grasped its essence. He brought out the Heavenly Nurture Urn, held a flame in his mouth, and gently exhaled.

A swarm of simple, apricot-yellow Southern Brightness Heart-Fire surged forward, suspending the Spiritual Treasure in mid-air. It suppressed the Radiant Fire within the artifact, aiding in its refinement, while Li Jiangqian himself began to circulate the wondrous power within the Golden Core-like treasure.

Li Ximing glanced over.

“What technique is that?” he asked, curious.

Li Jiangqian opened his eyes and smiled.

“Great-Granduncle, the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire is a manifestation of my own life-mandate; it is one with me. Not only can it refine spiritual artifacts and execute techniques on my behalf, but its aura is also identical to my own!”

Although Li Ximing’s Valley Wind Guide-Fire could control flames, it couldn’t imbue them with life as Li Jiangqian’s could. It could only rely on its simple spiritual nature to tend to an alchemy furnace. He felt a pang of envy.

“A pity that Radiant Fire is useless for alchemy or artifact refinement. Otherwise, one person could do the work of three. For everything heaven grants, it takes something away… this is a perfect example.”

He sighed, then said, “I won’t disturb you any longer. But remember, within the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, there is a copy of the Southern Li Ingestion Method. It is a unique Radiant Fire art for cultivating the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature. Since you have already manifested your divine abilities, you would do well to study it.”

Li Jiangqian acknowledged his words. Watching his elder depart, he sat down cross-legged, seemingly to meditate on the profound arts.

But from the conversation, he had realized that the state of the world was far more complex than he had ever imagined, and his family’s background was shrouded in greater mystery. His thoughts were in turmoil, yet a new, complicated resolve was forming within him.

‘The great tides of the world are sweeping up the Bright Yang… but even Dharma Masters can fail. Haven’t I witnessed the power of the master of the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance? Mount Luoxia may be tyrannical, but one must cross blades to know who is truly stronger.’

His heart was resolute, but his expression turned cold.

‘As for my brothers… the likes of Li Jiangxia and Li Jianglong are mere pawns for the north and south, ornaments on a king’s banner. They hold profound power but do nothing with it, merely waiting to be used in some grand calculation. Should the situation change, they will vanish like the morning dew. They are of no concern.’

---

Li Suining had waited in the hall for three days. At first, he was confident. But by the fourth day, with the main seat still empty, he began to grow anxious.

‘There shouldn’t have been any changes,’ he thought, a knot of doubt tightening in his chest. ‘I haven’t done anything, and there was no fluctuation of spiritual energy on the lake!’

It was no wonder he was so nervous. In his second life, he had exhausted himself, using every means at his disposal to elevate the Li clan’s strength far beyond its former glory, only for it to result in an even swifter annihilation. How could his heart not pound with dread? After waiting for another hour, he could bear it no longer and finally decided to enter the formation.

But just then, the faint sound of footsteps echoed from outside. A man entered the hall with a powerful, confident stride. Seeing Li Suining, a warm expression lit up his face.

“Elder Brother!”

Li Suining quickly returned the greeting.

“So, it’s you, Fourth Brother!”

The visitor was Li Suihuan. He looked at his brother eagerly, but seeing it was not the time for casual conversation, the eldest royal grandson spoke politely, 

“I have an urgent report. Daoist Master Nanwu has come to visit. Do you know where King Wei is?”

Guo Nanwu was by now a long-standing associate of the Li family. Not only did the two Daoist Masters know him, but even the core descendants were familiar with the Daoist Master who cultivated the arts of the Lesser Yang—and Li Suining was certainly no exception.

During the catastrophe on the lake in his second life, Guo Nanwu had already been at the middle stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. While he hadn't been able to provide decisive aid in the end, he had played a significant role in the conflict between the north and south. Whether he managed to escape the final calamity was something Li Suining never saw.

What had left an even deeper impression on Li Suining, however, was another Daoist Master: Yin Juexi, a direct descendant of the Yin family and a successor of the Mount Qusi lineage.

Truthfully, though Li Suining was profoundly grateful to him, to this day he couldn't understand why that Daoist Master had traveled thousands of miles to throw himself into the fire, protecting their family at any cost.

‘This Daoist Master Nanwu… though his help was from a distance, he more than fulfilled his obligations to us. But why has he come to the lake at a time like this?’

Li Suining raised a hand and said tactfully,

“I paid my respects to King Wei a few days ago. He had some minor matters to attend to and asked me to wait here. He should return shortly.”

The golden-eyed youth nodded amiably, seemingly unsurprised that his second elder brother was always in attendance before a Daoist Master. He was about to speak when a brilliant light flared and then scattered. Joy filled his eyes, and he bowed deeply.

“Greetings, Great King!”

Li Zhouwei waved a hand dismissively, not bothering to ask the reason for his presence.

“Show our guest in.”

As he spoke, he turned to Li Suining and gave him an imperceptible nod. The signal sent a jolt of delight through Li Suining.

‘It’s good news, just as I’d hoped! They’ve concealed the signs of Daoist Master Changli’s breakthrough!’

Li Suining’s cultivation made him exceptionally sensitive to spiritual energy. Seeing that there had been no fluctuation whatsoever in the world or its energy throughout the entire process, he was filled with joy. He gave Li Zhouwei a deep, respectful bow and, taking the hint, withdrew with his younger clan brother.

A Daoist Master entered from outside the hall. His robes were immaculate, and his bearing was composed. Upon seeing Li Zhouwei, he immediately lowered his gaze and said respectfully,

“Greetings, King Wei.”

Li Zhouwei’s impression of him was favorable. He nodded politely.

“Daoist Master Nanwu, are you here looking for my granduncle?”

Guo Nanwu nodded, though he didn’t seem particularly enthusiastic.

“I’ve come to Ting Province to deliver something on behalf of another.”

He produced a pristine white jade vase, elegant and luminous, and a jade slip inscribed with dark patterns that gave it a somber feel. The Daoist Master lowered his eyes.

“Fellow Daoist Cang Tiaozi of the World’s Navel, at the request of Senior Zhaojing, has sent a vial of Water from the Xuanmiao Great Treasury's Spring of Rebirth and the Surrogate Body Ascension Art.”

The moment he finished speaking, a ray of heavenly light descended, solidifying before them into the form of a man in white-gold Daoist robes. With a smile, his gaze fell upon Guo Nanwu.

“We’ve troubled you, Nanwu.”

“It was nothing!”

Guo Nanwu replied quickly, his expression turning serious.

“The water from the Spring of Rebirth is stored within a Spiritual Artifact. Cang Tiaozi intended to deliver it to the lake himself, but when he performed a divination, the blocks shattered. He surmised that the mainland is a place where many golden-rank powers manifest their presence, so he dared not come and entrusted this junior with the task.”

Li Ximing wasn't sure if this was good news or bad. He shook his head with a wry laugh and accepted the items.

“You’ve come at just the right time. A few days later and you would have missed me.”

Guo Nanwu bowed, a hint of bitterness on his face.

“The Southern Sea has grown more turbulent in recent years. Although this junior possesses a few minor arts, I am not skilled in combat. I’ve managed to get by only by relying on the prestige of the Qusi clan, but it has been a harrowing experience.”

Li Ximing’s smile faded.

“Do you require my assistance?” he asked, his tone serious.

Guo Nanwu hastily shook his head.

“I wouldn’t dare trouble an immortal like yourself. The Qusi are capable of handling it. It’s just… I cannot stay long.”

Seeing his predicament, Li Ximing said at once, “Say no more.”

He had already set a date with Minghui. After cultivating in Xinyu for over half a year, his time was nearly up, and he had no intention of delaying. As he escorted Guo Nanwu out, his spiritual sense moved, engraving the mysteries of the Surrogate Body Ascension Art into his mind.

‘Surrogate body ascension… borrow a form for concealment, reflect the spirit within, evade disaster and calamity…’

As he absorbed the information, a tremor went through him, and his mind filled with astonishment.

This Surrogate Body Ascension Art was a method for using another body to evade disaster. More importantly, the art had no strict requirements for the vessel itself—it merely needed to be nurtured with a mouthful of this spiritual water. From that point on, the surrogate body would be utterly transformed.

He was secretly delighted. Seeing that he already possessed the few types of spiritual materials required by the art, he stored the technique away and turned to Li Zhouwei.

“I’m going to make a trip to Yinzhou first. If all goes smoothly, I’ll also return this Mansion Water bottle that holds the water from the Spring of Rebirth.”
