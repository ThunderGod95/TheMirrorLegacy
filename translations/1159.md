# Chapter 1159: Taming the Tiger

A jolt went through Li Ximing. He swallowed a medicinal pill, and the joy in his heart quickly subsided as he rose upon the wind. He raised the wood-grained Spiritual Urn high, peered into its depths for a moment, and unleashed its divine ability.

Store and Combine.

In an instant, heavy layers of multicolored light poured from the urn, falling upon the two golden-bodied figures. Like a great whale drawing in the sea, it cared not for brilliant light, golden water, blessings from the Buddhist Land, or empowerment from the Daoist Tradition—it drained them all without a trace!

The two Merciful Ones, caught in the roiling Radiant Fire, were in utter agony. How could they withstand the divine power of such a Spiritual Treasure? Their expressions changed in unison.

‘Li Ximing is here!’

They didn’t even have time to exchange a glance. They immediately circulated their divine abilities, abandoning their protective light in a desperate attempt to return to the Buddhist Land!

To be fair, their skills were not lacking. One served beneath the Lotus Seat, while the other held the Seat of Developing Wisdom. Together, they could have held their own against most cultivators with a single divine ability. Even with reinforcements arriving, they should have had a chance to escape.

But they were no match for Li Jiangqian, who was protected by a Spiritual Treasure. The Southern Brightness Heart-Fire was simply too formidable!

This flame was a unique form of Radiant Fire whose power varied according to the user’s life-mandate. When first condensed, its might already surpassed Li Ximing’s Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame. After being further empowered by Talisman Qi, its strength had doubled. Only the exceedingly rare Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire in Li Ximing's possession could definitively suppress it.

This flame resonated with Li Jiangqian's own Radiant Fire ability, moving with his thoughts. It didn’t just burn in one spot. To make matters worse, the Merciful Ones’ weapons were of poor quality. After dozens of exchanges, their hands were slick with molten gold.

Forced to fight bare-handed for the remainder of the battle, they were left dizzy and disoriented by the heat.

In stark contrast to their humiliating struggle, Li Jiangqian grew more comfortable with every move. His eyes shone brightly as he nodded to himself in satisfaction.

It was, frankly, an embarrassing memory. Just after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, his first opponent had been Touba Ci, a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator and a dignified imperial descendant of the Great Liang. His ambition had been crushed, beaten so soundly he couldn't even retaliate. If Li Zhouwei hadn’t arrived in time, he would have been grievously wounded within a few rounds, leaving him with a bitter sense of failure.

But fighting these two, he finally understood the kind of opponent a cultivator of his level was meant to face. The feeling was exhilarating. The longer he fought, the more seamlessly he integrated his skills, his attacks growing ever more relentless.

‘Now _this_ is more like it!’

Seeing the two about to self-destruct to escape, Li Jiangqian reacted in a flash. The Radiant Fire Spiritual Treasure he had kept ready in the Great Void descended abruptly. Countless golden threads erupted from it, ignoring the Merciful One from the Lotus Seat and wrapping entirely around the one from the Seat of Developing Wisdom.

Li Ximing understood instantly. He circulated his divine ability, forming a hand seal and chanting an incantation.

“By my command!”

The Light of the Six Harmonies from his World’s Radiance ability cut across the Great Void and descended in an instant. The divine power to confine and dispel evil activated, causing the Merciful One to choke as his inner power seized up and dissipated.

In that brief moment, his companion exploded beside him.

But the resulting cloud of pink light offered no aid; it was immediately smothered by an impossibly thick layer of Li-Light. The vast power of Store and Combine constricted around him, snaring the Merciful One and leaving him no chance of escape.

Then, the bright white Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire poured down from above. The Merciful One let out a horrifying shriek, but he was pinned by the other Radiant Fire Spiritual Treasure, unable to move. Helpless as a small boat on a stormy sea, he was drawn into the urn.

“Grand-uncle… what an incredible ability!”

Li Jiangqian immediately rode a wave of Radiant Fire to draw closer. Li Ximing had aggravated his injuries again, and his face was a shade paler. After he coughed twice, the boyish attendant spirit appeared, taking the Spiritual Treasure from his master’s hand to suppress its power. Only then did Li Ximing manage a smile.

“It’s this Heavenly Nurture Urn that’s so powerful. Against Buddhist cultivators… especially these ones with little real substance… it truly strikes at their weakest point.”

Li Jiangqian finally noticed his grand-uncle’s condition.

“How are you?” he asked in a low voice.

Li Ximing waved a dismissive hand and briefly explained the situation to the west, but his gaze, fixed on the riverbank, was filled with dread. The clash of gold and fire was growing more intense by the second.

“Where is the venerable Daoist Master Chen?”

Li Jiangqian hesitated for a moment.

“He crossed the river.”

“He crossed the river!”

Li Ximing stared at the utter chaos unfolding on the White River.

“He shouldn’t have gotten involved!” he said under his breath.

Li Jiangqian silently shook his head.

“The Golden Feather cultivators didn’t arrive that early. Senior Chen Yin was in a fierce battle with Shilou Yingge and was already wounded when the chaos erupted behind them. The old senior didn’t know it was the Golden Feather Sect; he thought it was Liu Bai’s group retreating south from Tangdao Mountain. He told me to guard the bank while he went across to provide support.”

Li Ximing was stunned for a moment.

“Such courage,” he couldn’t help but remark.

Li Jiangqian just shook his head noncommittally, saying no more. As they watched with growing concern, the golden light to the north gained a decisive advantage. An intense chill swept through the air, causing countless shards of ice to form on the great river’s surface.

Just then, a streak of azure light shot across the Great Void, staggering to a stop before them. Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin, materialized. Li Ximing coughed again and stepped forward.

“Venerable senior… are you alright?”

The old man had a sword on his back. His face was grim, his aura severe, and blood stained his lips. His gaze softened only when it fell on Li Ximing.

“I’m fine…”

Even as he spoke, he coughed up more blood, which transformed into rolling flames and dissipated in mid-air. His Mansion Water arts were a match for True Fire, but his Dao-Profundity was clearly inferior to Shilou Yingge’s. All he said was,

“The Golden Feather cultivators are holding them back…”

Li Ximing’s heart settled somewhat. He saw Chen Yin pause, his expression growing complex as he looked at him.

“I saw several Daoist Masters from the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition,” he said hesitantly. “Among them was a Daoist Master Tianhuo. He asked me to relay a message to Zhaojing.”

“Please, speak.”

Surprise flickered across Li Ximing’s pale face as he turned to listen. Chen Yin’s voice was deep.

“He said… the favor from years ago… I repay it today to my friend, Daoist Master Zhaojing.”

---

Xuanmiao Temple.

Black clouds hung heavy over the mountains. Cold, dense raindrops pattered against the eaves. Disciples huddled together between the palace halls, shoving one another as they stared in dismay at the churning black-green miasma to the south.

“Something terrible has happened… out on the lake…”

“Where is everyone? Where are the elders?”

A great master had descended the mountain not long ago to pacify the region. The disciples had faith in the northern cultivators’ forces, but the celestial phenomena were too bizarre to ignore. They gathered and went to find Qi Lanyan’s disciple, but he was nowhere to be found.

“Where else could he have gone?”

“Who knows?”

The rain intensified, driven by the wind into the grand hall. It slicked the vermilion wooden beams with a cold sheen. The disciples looked up, and through the gloom, they finally saw it—a speck of white.

The next moment, that point of white had already streaked across the sky, radiating a brilliant Heavenly Light. It was the immense, domineering form of the Celestial Gate.

In an instant, the entire Xuanmiao Temple erupted into chaos. Despite the protection of the grand formation, the disciples felt as if they’d been pounced on by a starving tiger. They fell like scythed wheat, stumbling into one another and collapsing to the ground. An eerie silence fell, broken only by the chattering of teeth and the rustle of robes.

But the stream of light shot past without a second glance, continuing its northward flight until it vanished into the clouds. Only then did a burst of radiance explode, and a golden figure emerged from the Great Void, filling the air with a purple aura.

The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master from the White Ye Immortal Sect appeared, his voice booming.

“Greetings, King Wei! Yehui has come as promised!”

“Bai Ziyu!”

A voice like thunder, imbued with Buddhist might, rolled through the air. The golden figure in the sky condensed, revealing a Majestic Jeweled Visage. He wore a kasaya and held a jade pestle, and behind him, a vision of a great lotus bloomed and faded. It was Mingxiang of the Lotus Temple.

Yet he was a wretched sight. His jade-like face was a mask of humiliation. Though his kasaya glowed brightly, countless fine cracks spiderwebbed beneath the surface.

His voice was laced with disbelief and fury.

“After the defeat at Lake Xian, you dare to rebel so soon!”

The thunderous accusation seemed to kill the last glimmer of hope. The sky dimmed, the earth trembled, and from the ground, purple-black royal banners rose. Countless streams of light shot across the lake.

“The Song army is here!”

"Boom!"

Silver lightning erupted across the sky, filling the night with tens of thousands of electric lances that illuminated the mountains. Nearly half the candles in the great hall flickered out. The ancestral portraits hanging at the head of the hall swayed violently in the wind, their faces shifting in the flickering light, appearing grotesque and terrifying.

“Where is Lord Qi?” a trembling voice cried out from the mountainside. Before anyone could answer, a rain of multicolored light fell before the formation, accompanied by a wave of cheers. A man’s heroic voice echoed through the night:

“Qi Lanyan has been executed by King Wei! The Zhao army is defeated! Open the formation at once and welcome the king’s forces!”

"Boom!"

Silver lightning crawled across the heavens, illuminating the face of the man high above and making the colorful cracks on his skin appear even deeper. Li Zhouwei’s gaze swept past the Buddhist light entangled with purple water and fixed on a point beyond it.

Another stream of pink Buddhist light was tumbling within the purple torrent, struggling against a heavy, oppressive peak. It had finally broken free from Yehui’s divine ability.

It was Maha Zhelu of the Liangli rank, from the Way of Emptiness.

This Maha had been wounded by Li Zhouwei on the lake, but he had never imagined that Qi Lanyan would fall. He had immediately turned to launch a sneak attack on Wenqing of the Purple Smoke Gate. By the time the situation had turned, he was already retreating, only to be intercepted at Xuanmiao Temple by Yehui, along with Mingxiang.

Though Yehui often concealed his true strength, his divine abilities and Dao-Profundity were not to be underestimated. The three divine abilities of his Capital Guard Dao Lineage all possessed suppressive power, and his Western Heaven Plateau ability could sever the flow of spiritual energy and seal the Great Void. Having come with clear intent, blocking two wounded opponents for a short time should have been simple.

However, the Capital Guard arts were notoriously vulnerable to purification by brilliant light. Though Mingxiang’s Enlightened Artifact was shattered, his personal strength was largely intact. His desperate struggle tied up most of Yehui’s attention, allowing Zhelu to slip free.

“You have some nerve!”

Situ Huo, who had been stewing with regret over his stolen glory, saw his chance. His eyes lit up, the pattern of the Monarch’s Lost Sheep on his weapon flared, and he lunged with his golden-red saber to intercept the fleeing Maha.

In contrast, Cheng Jiuwen remained perfectly calm, standing quietly behind the Celestial Gate. He only occasionally glanced toward the northwest, his face etched with worry.

Li Zhouwei seemed to sense it. His eyes, swirling with color, shifted, but he did not move to stop the escape.

His condition had improved, but facing Zhelu now would be a severe strain. A Liangli-rank Maha fighting for his life, one who might even abandon his physical form to escape, was no less dangerous than one at full strength.

Instead, his gaze swept through the heavy purple qi and settled on Mingxiang.

The Maha from Lotus Temple was locked in a fierce struggle with Yehui. When he saw Li Zhouwei looking at him, his eyes flickered. Yehui, riding the purple torrent, glanced at Li Zhouwei and then toward the distant black-green miasma.

“King Wei!” he called out in a low voice.

A seed of doubt sprouted in Li Zhouwei’s mind.

‘Mingxiang is supposed to be guarding Shanji. The northern cultivators must have others stationed there as well… But Yang Ruiyi came here in person. Under the cover of his Exiled Qi, there’s no way Mingxiang could have escaped so easily!’

An image flashed in his mind: the Underworld Treasure Hall that had held off Wang Ziya for over a dozen exchanges at Lake Xian. He extended his spiritual sense with Spirit Probe, directing it toward the western region of Baiye.

He saw only a vast, tranquil expanse of Exiled Qi. There were no signs of a battle.

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouwei.

‘Shanji is protected by a sophisticated formation laid by the north; it’s a hard target to crack. Yang Ruiyi made a feint, merely trapping them with Exiled Qi while he interfered at Lake Xian. Once he saw the situation was stable, he immediately bypassed Shanji and entered Jianghuai to seize Baiye first!’

It was undoubtedly the correct strategic move. Shanji was a tough nut, but the Jianghuai region across the river was a ripe prize. With Guanhua gone, every major power coveted it. The Western Shu forces might have already pushed to the White River by now. If Yang Ruiyi had gotten bogged down at Shanji, he would have been ceding territory across the river.

With Xuanmiao Temple lost, Shanji was isolated and helpless—a fish on the chopping block. Just as Li Zhouwei had ordered his forces to bypass the White Ye Immortal Sect’s headquarters, Yang Ruiyi had bypassed Shanji to claim the lands on the other side.

‘And by doing so, he can also rally the forces I sent—Lin Chensheng and the others—to reinforce Tangdao Mountain.’

The Way of Great Desire would surely know of their crushing defeat at Lake Xian. With Jianghuai now masterless, the Baihai forces would have regrouped. Tian Langzhi would certainly join forces with Mount Dayang to press the attack on Tangdao Mountain and seize that critical bridgehead—and Yang Ruiyi would be there to contest it.

In an instant, Li Zhouwei had deduced the strategies of both the Yang Clan and the Way of Great Desire.

‘One move, with three more in mind. Jianghuai is already theirs for the taking. The Song state needs to hold it as a future springboard to the north, the final piece to control the entire region. The Western Shu need the White River and Tangdao Mountain to gain a foothold in Jianghuai. And Mount Dayang and the Seven Aspects need to reclaim their losses by taking that same fortress to control the region.’

‘The next great battle will be fought on Tangdao Mountain, the most important peak in all of Jianghuai.’

He had received word that Li Ximing was safe, and now his strategic thinking was clear. It was, at last, a piece of genuinely good news. With three major powers vying for control of Tangdao Mountain in the west, the remnants of the Baihai forces, the intercepted cultivators, and the Buddhist monks would have no capacity to resist him here.

The King of Wei retracted his Spirit Probe. With a final, faint glance, his figure soared into the air. He shot past Xuanmiao Temple, continuing north without pause, leaving only a fading whisper in the air:

“General Situ, I leave this place to you!”

Situ Huo couldn’t have been happier. He let out a hearty laugh and immediately accepted the command. A thick golden qi billowed up, sealing the sky.

The Heavenly Light streaked northward, crossing vast tracts of land until a new scene leaped into view.

A colossal demonic figure stood between heaven and earth. A long halberd radiating Profound Qi swept across the sky, crashing down upon a towering golden peak. There, a man in white robes, as small as an ant, calmly held a treasured saber.

Daoist Master Changyun had managed to intercept Touba Ci here.

But under the golden radiance, another Spiritual Treasure hovered in the air—an ivory-white ceremonial tablet, no longer than a hand. It cast a halo of light that seemed to shatter a celestial dam. A torrent of power emerged from the Great Void, a rolling wave of white qi flowing from north to south, isolating the space and blocking several other attacks.

Within that white qi stood a young man in a fluttering black robe, holding a spear. A vertical line was slowly forming on his brow. His spear was sharp, but he was at a disadvantage, suppressed by a Maha who had leaped from the streams of light.

At that moment, the Heavenly Light brightened. The Buddhist cultivators looked up to see the Celestial Gate descending as the sky darkened. The Maha’s head snapped up. Though his power was faint, undisguised hatred blazed in his eyes.

‘He’s here!’

This Maha was none other than Bashan.

He was a longtime confidant of Maha Nuzi and a talent born with immense strength. The Way of Great Desire had been reluctant to let him join the battle at Lake Xian, using an excuse to keep him in the rear, but Qi Lanyan had summoned him anyway. When the battle turned, Bashan was one of the first ordered to retreat. However, Daoist Master Changyun, intimately familiar with the northern forces’ deployment, had specifically intercepted and trapped him here.

Bashan had risen from an Arhat under Nuzi to the rank of Maha. His debt of gratitude to Nuzi was as heavy as a mountain. To him, the Way of Great Desire and the Buddhist Land were one. Though he had escaped and didn’t know the final details of what happened at the lake, he had learned of Nuzi’s fall.

Though a Buddhist, he was a man who remembered his debts. The hatred in his heart boiled over. Seeing the King of Wei cutting a path of destruction straight to him, he naturally pinned all his enmity on the king's head, his eyes nearly splitting with rage.

The Heavenly Light that had shielded the scene dissipated. Bashan froze for a second, stunned.

‘He’s grievously wounded and hasn’t recovered, yet he chased me all the way here. Could this be my chance for revenge?’

That was the power of the Crystalline Jade Branch!

Bashan was almost certain that the king’s divine abilities were just a bluff.

The next moment, he abandoned the man in black and strode across the Great Void. A mountain-like golden palm descended toward Li Zhouwei. Ignoring his own depleted body, he pushed his divine abilities and dharma power to their absolute limit, burning them as fuel for a raging golden fire.

To his utter delight, the young king only seemed to notice him when he was just a few dozen feet away, finally turning his head to look.

‘He’s been struck by a deep and terrible calamity!’

He was ecstatic. Li Zhouwei, however, remained impassive. The long halberd in his hand twitched, and the corner of his mouth curved into a slight smile.

‘I made it in time…’

Just as the golden palm was about to land, the darkness in the sky receded. The King of Wei simply vanished. The smile on Bashan’s face froze. A black boot materialized from the void and kicked squarely on the back of his massive golden head.

"Boom!"

The giant golden body hung in the air for a moment before plummeting to the earth like a meteor. He had barely stabilized himself when the mountains and rivers condensed from a Bright Yang Spiritual Treasure descended upon him. Pitch-black darkness once again crawled across the sky as a setting sun blazed to life.

Emperor Qi’s Light!

This Dharma Art, enhanced by numerous empowerments, had long ago surpassed its original limits. Even cast casually, its power was immense. Now, resonating with the Crimson Severing Arrowhead and Li Zhouwei’s own injuries, it had reached a new height.

A thick pillar of black-gold light descended from the heavens and struck Bashan, causing splashes of molten gold to fly from his body. He let out an earth-shattering roar.

“AOOOH!”

The young man stood coldly in the sky, the colorful cracks on his face flickering. Though he looked as if his body might shatter at any moment, his tone was calm, stating a simple fact.

“If I hadn’t needed to use your accumulated power that day, did you think a clown like you could have ever touched this king?”

The golden body below erupted in a wretched howl, but the King of Wei remained unmoved, his icy gaze filled with scorn. The stream of black-gold light in the sky intensified, and the screams of the Way of Great Desire’s rising star echoed across the heavens.

This only deepened his smile.

Two full breaths passed. The King of Wei’s ear twitched. His cracked face snapped around. The golden qi was vibrating violently as a huge, ferocious tiger leaped out. Its divine power was weak, but its savage aura remained undiminished.

At the same moment, Bashan, bathed in light, played his final card. Burning his divine abilities to their very dregs as the price for one last strike, he sacrificed his own life-mandate and lunged straight for Li Zhouwei.

But what greeted him was the dazzling Celestial Gate descending from above.

The sarcasm in Li Zhouwei’s eyes faded, replaced by a genuine smile.

“You finally came out.”

The mark on his brow glowed. He shifted to the side, and a large hand reached deep into the Great Void. As easily as pulling an object from a bag, he grabbed the black tiger by the scruff of its neck, halting its attack cold. With his other hand, he swung his black halberd level, and the flat of the weapon smashed into the tiger’s head.

Li Zhouwei was gravely injured, yes, but how much better could this man and beast possibly be after fleeing all the way from the lake?

"Crack!"

The tiger’s glazed, jewel-like eyes instantly shattered, blown apart by the force of the blow. A mournful cry escaped its throat, a sickening mixture of shattering teeth and cracking bone that echoed across the sky.

Li Zhouwei’s figure vanished.

Bashan’s eyes widened as a vertical sliver of golden light grew rapidly before him. The edge of the long halberd descended in silence and touched his face.

Splitting Light!

His sturdy head shattered before the Radiant Sun King’s Halberd. Next came the powerful dharma body he had spent centuries cultivating, along with its countless flashing, profound runes. Before the might of the Bright Yang, it was all crushed bit by bit, leaving not a single trace.

He was annihilated on the spot.

"Boom!"

A blinding golden light shot skyward, so intense it seemed to scorch the man’s black robes. But he simply brought two fingers together and casually wiped the blood from his halberd’s edge. He strolled through the storm of flying sand, lifted the limp, barely breathing black tiger, and fixed it with a gaze as cold as ten-thousand-year-old ice.

Golden tiger blood streamed down his arm, covering the colorful cracks in his skin. Every gaze that swept over him immediately retracted. Even Touba Ci, high in the sky, discreetly looked away, his heart pounding with shock.

‘That’s the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth… Even a Great Daoist Master who took that head-on would have to retreat and recuperate…’

‘He just killed Qi Lanyan while under the effects of the Crystalline Jade Branch… a proper disciple of Guanhua… How is he… acting as if nothing happened? He chased him for a thousand li and killed another Maha from the Way of Great Desire!’

‘This is what being afflicted by a calamity looks like? This is a body on the verge of collapse? He looks wounded, certainly, but it seems as if…’

The descendant of a True Monarch, a prince of the Great Liang’s imperial clan, looked on in a daze. He wasn’t sure if it was just his imagination, but a startling thought flashed through his mind:

‘His divine abilities have grown broader.’
