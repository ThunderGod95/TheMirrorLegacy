# Chapter 387: Benefits

"Brother Xuan!"

Li Qiuyang flew close to the ground with Li Xuanxuan beside him, whose face was ashen. He was dragging the scorched monkey along, occasionally pulling out a talisman from his sleeve and tossing it behind them.

BOOM!

The talisman barely emitted a glow before a blood-red hammer shadow crushed the spell into countless fragments.

The man holding the hammer laughed heartily.

"You must be from a rich family, so full of treasures!" he mocked.

They chose a path shrouded in infernal fire to escape, but Li Xuanxuan's luck was never good, and they soon ran into a devil cultivator. This one, wielding a large hammer and seeming to be quite powerful, appeared to be in the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Xuanxuan and the monkey were already in terrible shape, and Li Qiuyang was only an unrefined Qi Cultivator, making them no match for this opponent. They immediately turned to flee for their lives.

"Fortunately, this guy's techniques are broad and slow, unlike the previous devil cultivator. This gives us a bit more time," Li Xuanxuan said as he touched the jade pendant in his sleeve, formulating a plan in his mind.

Although his internal mana was almost depleted and he could not increase his speed, he used the River Crossing Torrential Step to dodge left and right, managing to hold on.

The devil cultivator chased them on a rolling black cloud, brandishing his hammer and toying with them like a cat would with mice. Occasionally, he would speed up, forcing Li Xuanxuan to use talismans to fend off his attacks.

This devil cultivator was clearly more experienced in combat than the previous dual-wielding one, methodically depleting their mana and forcing Li Xuanxuan to exhaust his talismans.

"Brother Xuan‚Ä¶ this is not working. Let me cover the rear," Li Qiuyang whispered through gritted teeth to Li Xuanxuan, whose face looked ghastly.

"No need."

Though his mana was nearly depleted, Li Xuanxuan gripped the jade pendant inside his robe tightly, boiling with anger as he thought to himself, According to this pendant's guidance, Qinghong is just a li away. I'll show you the consequences of bullying a Li Family member!

Seeing Li Xuanxuan's determined tone, Li Qiuyang silently followed him.

Qi Cultivators were extremely fast. They had been running for only a few breaths before a woman appeared ahead.

The woman seemed to be in her late teens, clad in bright white jade armor that shimmered with an azure light. Her almond-shaped eyes were filled with anger, tinged with a hint of purple. She held a spear, its tip pointing downward.

She had an attractive face that exuded a heroic aura. The ribbons on her jade armor fluttered in the wind. Her hair was simply tied up in a ponytail with a plain jade hairpin and her jet-black hair flowed freely in the wind.

"Lady Qinghong!"

Li Qiuyang, seeing hope in despair, was overjoyed. He finally understood the source of Li Xuanxuan's confidence earlier. They staggered to her side, breathing a sigh of relief.

The devil cultivator's face darkened, intimidated by Li Qinghong's imposing presence. He slowed down but upon realizing she was only a mid-stage Qi Cultivator, he laughed mockingly.

"Damn, these cultivators look prettier one after the other‚Ä¶ with weak cultivation but such grand airs. One might think she is an immortal general!" he sneered.

Noticing her impressive artifacts, he remained unafraid. He had killed many and knew that the cultivation methods of Jiangnan's families and rogue cultivators were mostly rubbish that did not use pure qi and not worth worrying about.

His own cultivation came from techniques passed down by powerful devils, comparable to Grade Four immortal techniques of Jiangnan. He sneered and shouted, "Little female cultivator, you‚Äî"

Before he could finish, Li Qinghong lunged forward, her jade armor jingling. A bright purple spear shadow flowed like a dragon, striking in an instant.

The devil cultivator swallowed his words right away, raising his hammer to block the incoming attack. The spear, crackling with bright purple lightning, transformed into a dragon, smashing against the blood-red hammer with a loud bang, emitting a brilliant purple spark.

BOOM!

The devil cultivator felt a surge of annihilating thunder force travel through his hammer. His dharma artifact emitted a series of mournful wails, and a flash of lightning burst between his palms, releasing tendrils of black smoke. His face quickly turned pale.

Li Qinghong knew this place was not suitable for a prolonged fight and preferred a quick resolution. She immediately drew her Duruo Spear, seizing the opportunity of her opponent's arrogance. She launched the Fei Family's ultimate technique‚Äîthe Dragon Reflection.

For some reason, the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow talisman qi within her surged upon seeing this devil cultivator. Dark red light flowed from her elbow to the spear, adding extra power and might to her weapon. The thunderous dragon-like shadow struck, causing a tremendous thunderclap that left the devil cultivator at a severe disadvantage.

"A thunder cultivator?!" the devil cultivator groaned, his hands dropping powerlessly. He felt his cultivation dwindle, and even his dharma artifact slipped from his grip, clattering to the ground.

Panic-stricken, he wailed loudly, "When did Jiangnan produce such a powerful Dao lineage?!"

Abandoning his dharma artifact, he whipped up a blood-red whirlwind and hurriedly fled into an alley.

"Only an idiot would fight her with all these treasures lying around! Whether I can win or not, my cultivation is already half gone!"

Specialized in escape techniques, the devil cultivator disappeared at the end of the alley in the blink of an eye, leaving his hammer on the ground.

Li Qinghong watched him go with a smile, unhurried. Her delicate hand twirled the spear and rested it behind her. With her other hand, she crafted a talisman in the air, emitting mysterious purple patterns.

Bzzzt... bzzzzt‚Ä¶

The thunder talisman formed before her, glowing brightly. The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique she practiced was ancient and profound with several secret techniques attached to it, this being one of them.

Li Qinghong chuckled softly, flicking the talisman like a meteor after the fleeing devil cultivator. Without waiting for the result, she picked up the hammer and calmly turned to her uncles, saying softly, "Uncles, we should leave quickly."

Li Xuanxuan and Li Qiuyang were awestruck by her spear's power, nodding hastily. The three of them took off, flying just a few chi before a loud explosion sounded from the market.

BOOM!!

Purple lightning erupted, and black smoke rose. Several screams and curses ensued, with a few red lights and demonic smoke shooting up. Li Xuanxuan and the others ducked instinctively, even the monkey looked terrified and distanced itself from her.

Hearing the commotion, Li Qinghong calculated their next steps. Realizing her brother Li Yuanyun was missing, her heart sank.

"Uncle‚Ä¶ where is Brother Yun?" she asked softly.

Li Xuanxuan and Li Qiuyang exchanged glances, unsure of how to respond, leaving only the sound of their sighs. Li Qinghong understood immediately and flew on in silence.

On the Guli Road.

Li Yuanjiao and his group waited for a while, chasing away some scavenging rogue cultivators before seeing Li Qinghong approach with the others. He hurried to meet them, staring at Li Xuanxuan's condition in shock.

"Father?!"

Li Xuanxuan raised his head, his left leg crooked and dangling. He looked emaciated and withered, his eyes half gray and half white. He gave a weak smile and managed to croak out softly, "Jiao'er!"

Though Li Yuanjiao had minor grievances with his father, he still cared deeply for him. He quickly supported him, asking gruffly, "What... happened to you?!"

"Ah!"

Li Xuanxuan, despite his haggard appearance, was filled with the joy of survival, unable to hide his glee. He exclaimed with a hint of pride, "Nothing I have done in my whole life compares to what I have achieved in this past hour!"

Li Xuanxuan used to think of himself as mediocre and incompetent. Reflecting on the multiple times he had skirted the edge of death, he could not help but feel a bit of pride in himself, his eyes brimming with tears. He thought to himself, It must be Second Uncle's spirit in heaven protecting me! It must be his accumulated virtue...

At this moment, Li Xuanxuan deeply understood why Li Tongya had handed down the River Crossing Torrential Step and the accompanying Blood Escape Technique, insisting that the direct lineage must practice them diligently.

Without these two secret techniques, he would have perished at who knows where. As these thoughts crossed his mind, tears began to trickle from his eyes, burnt gray by the fire.

Everyone was deeply moved, and for a moment, no one remembered Li Yuanyun. Only Li Qinghong, who clutched her spear, wept silently. Li Yuanjiao, feeling distressed, handed his father over to Xiao Guiluan who was skilled in healing, and comforted him for a while longer before they all returned home together.

On Lijing Peak.

Li Yuanjiao and his group returned to the peak, sending Tian Youdao and An Zheyan off, one to Xianyou Peak and the other back to Cloud Crowned Peak to survey the situation and gather news. Li Yuanjiao personally helped Li Xuanxuan into the cave dwelling to treat his injuries while the remaining cultivators returned to their respective peaks.

Li Yuanping hurried up to check on Li Xuanxuan, personally tending to him for a while. Li Qinghong called over Li Xicheng and Li Xijun, informing them of what had happened to Li Yuanyun, and they waited for the chaos in the marketplace to subside before they could search for his remains.

The two brothers, grieving their father's death, were naturally filled with sorrow. Li Qinghong, having experienced numerous life-and-death separations herself, understood their pain the most and did not allow them to dwell on it. She gave them heavy and tedious tasks to occupy them before hurrying down the mountain.

The greatest loss in the disaster at Cloud Crowned Peak's marketplace was naturally borne by the Xiao Family. As Li Xuanxuan lay unconscious and recovering, Li Yuanjiao and Li Qiuyang estimated that the Xiao Family had probably lost dozens of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators and about ten Qi Cultivators.

The loss of these ten Qi Cultivators was not significant, as most were external and guest cultivators of the Xiao Family, with few true Xiao Family members. However, the loss of those dozens of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, including some true Xiao Family heirs sent down to gain experience, was substantial, and it was uncertain how many had escaped.

As for the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Chen Taojing, who fought against four opponents, although protected by the Boundless Ocean, it was easy for him to defend himself but hard for him to escape, thus he was likely dead.

Next were the various families of Lixia Prefecture and the rogue cultivators in the marketplace. Most of the families in Lixia Prefecture were vassals of the Xiao Family, also suffering losses in this disaster.

The Xiao Family had a significant influence, controlling two-fifths of Lixia Prefecture. Most of the remaining families were directly or indirectly controlled by the Xiao Family. Even the families on the eastern shore of Moongaze Lake, bordering Lixia Prefecture, were mostly under the Xiao's control, and many had suffered losses in the marketplace attack.

"As for the rogue cultivators, this disaster might have severed many lineages..." Li Yuanjiao sighed inwardly, puzzled. "But the Xiao Family is an important ally of the Azure Pond Sect, and the devil plague is said to be the dogs of the Azure Pond Sect‚Ä¶ How could the Xiao Family be caught off guard and bitten so hard by the devil cultivators?" he continued, muttering to himself.

He stroked his sword at his waist, murmuring quietly, "Either the Azure Pond Sect has fallen out with the Xiao Family, or the devil cultivators have gone rogue... or perhaps someone from the three sects and seven gates interfered, altering the overall situation."

Recalling the hints given by Yuan Tuan when she visited the Li Family, Li Yuanjiao dismissed these speculations. "If the devil cultivators spread out in Lixia Prefecture, it will be our Moongaze Lake that suffers," he mumbled, understanding the situation.

Feeling anxious, he wondered whether to take another pill to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm when the stone door in front of him rumbled open, interrupting his thoughts. Li Xuanxuan hurried out.

Li Xuanxuan had changed into a clean robe and most of his burn scars had healed, though his eyes still had a grayish hue. He looked emaciated and haggard, lacking his former solemn and dignified appearance.

"What about that monkey?!"

Li Xuanxuan's first question upon waking was about the obedient spirit beast he had brought back, causing Li Yuanjiao to smile wryly.

Turning to a nearby family soldier, he gave a command.

"Go bring that spirit beast here."

Li Yuanjiao watched Li Xuanxuan eagerly, who had been the head of the family for many years. Li Xuanxuan understood the unspoken request and happily took off the storage pouch from his waist, saying with a smile, "Let's see what we have gathered!"

The family's finances had been in poor shape for many years, so both Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping were keenly interested in what Li Xuanxuan had managed to collect during the disaster at the market. They both nodded eagerly.

Rustle‚Ä¶

Li Xuanxuan reached into the storage pouch and poured out a stream of treasures, most of which he had taken from the storage pouch of the dual-wielding cultivator. The rest included a few robes and some pills.

The dharma artifacts were all of the Qi Cultivation Realm. There were four low-grade and inferior-grade artifacts, which were not worth mentioning. The highlight was a medium-grade artifact, a large oval-shaped earth-yellow shield called the Six-Stone Cloud Plate, a well-crafted item known for its sturdiness.

As for how they knew its name and origin, the shield's edge had a small inscription on it that said, "Six-Stone Cloud Plate, medium grade, Yuanwu Peak, forged by Yu Muxian."

"This..?!"

Both men were rendered speechless by the discovery. It was the first time they learned that the term medium grade referred to the mid-stage of Qi Cultivation Realm within the sect.

Li Yuanjiao hefted the Six-Stone Cloud Plate, finding it light and handy, and remarked, "It is indeed the work of an old acquaintance‚Ä¶ Yu Muxian does have some skill indeed."

"After all, it is from the long-lost Molten Metal Cave technique," Li Xuanxuan said quietly as he heard many rumors in the market. He stored the Six-Stone Cloud Plate away and brought out a pair of twin blades.

These twin blades were also medium-grade, and they were flat and thin. Without the devil cultivator's mana, they showed a faint blue-green hue. They examined them for a while but found no signature, indicating they were not from the three sects and seven gates.

Li Yuanjiao swung the blades, which emitted a thin blue blade qi. It was thinner and sharper than sword qi, requiring specific skills to wield it properly.

"Let's call them Azure Blades."

The Li Family's collection of Qi Cultivation Realm artifacts was limited, with none of medium grade until now. The Azure Blades were a pair of artifacts, significantly increasing their value. Naturally, Li Yuanjiao carefully noted them down and stored them away, considering their potential future use.

The form of each dharma artifact determined the reach and range of its qi and aura, each with its own characteristics. Having a variety of different weapons in the family's repertoire was greatly beneficial.

"There is also the large hammer that Qinghong has. I wonder what grade it is," Li Xuanxuan said thoughtfully. After sorting through the dharma artifacts, he set aside the pills and picked up a jade slip from the table, marveling at it.

"It is strange that this devil cultivator carried his legacy so openly. Perhaps he had no fixed residence and nowhere else to store it," he mused.

Li Yuanjiao scoffed and offered a different perspective.

"If not for this, how could devil cultivators grow so rapidly in Jiangnan? They probably copied countless copies and spread them widely. It is no wonder they have several copies in their storage pouch!"

Li Xuanxuan found this explanation reasonable. He had seen the bizarre resilience of devil cultivators with their numerous backup plans, unafraid of damaging their bodies or their cultivation. Many rogue cultivators, unable to resist temptation, naturally turned to the devil cultivation in droves.

He placed his spiritual sense into the jade slip, and a few large characters appeared in his mind: Blood Dharma Manual. Annotated by Anonymous. Part One.

Li Xuanxuan dared not delve deeper, merely noting the title mentally. He was puzzled and mumbled, "Blood Dharma Manual... Why does this name sound so familiar?"

Blood Dharma Manual...

Li Xuanxuan pondered for a moment and vaguely remembered hearing Li Tongya mention this cultivation method before. It seemed to be a method from the Golden Feather Sect, with the first volume marked as Grade Four, containing only the Qi Cultivation Realm section.

"It appears that even among the devil cultivators, they use cultivation methods to control and threaten each other. After all, devil cultivators are selfish. Without such control over their cultivation paths, they would have scattered long ago..."

"It should be more than that." Li Yuanjiao paused slightly and contemplated for a moment. Not all devil cultivators had hopes of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. There must be other connections or methods of control among these devil cultivators.

"It is not surprising that the three sects and seven gates have devil cultivation methods... But finding a Golden Feather Sect method on a devil cultivator within Azure Pond Sect's territory is interesting. Could it be that Azure Pond's devil cultivators have secretly defected to the Golden Feather Sect?"

Li Xuanxuan was filled with doubt, and he murmured, "Or perhaps... The devil plague was something both the Golden Feather Sect and Azure Pond Sect tacitly approved of or even intentionally facilitated. But if that is the case..."

"What good would that do?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

He was all dressed in black and stared intently at his father, puzzled as he continued, "The clans and rogue cultivators have been supporting Azure Pond for years! To allow them to be slaughtered by devil cultivators just like that doesn't make sense... Azure Pond would have to send people to re-establish control next year, and areas ravaged by the devil plague would be desolate for decades. Small families and rogue cultivators would take nearly a century to grow again... It is like giving away their egg-laying hens for others to enjoy!"

"Maybe... the devil plague has another purpose."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head, shifting his thoughts as he read through several black jade slips one by one.

There were escape techniques like the Sacrificial Blood Escape, likely the blood wind the devil cultivator used to escape, a reincarnation method Belly Ghost Infant, and a method to convert from immortal to devil cultivation, Blood Conversion Scripture...

In total, there were five techniques. They all required human blood, spiritual energy, resentment qi, and human heads‚Äîall of which were not good things. The two only read the summaries to gain a rough understanding of the devil cultivator's secrets.

Devil cultivators also started from the Embryonic Breathing Realm, but instead of immediately progressing to the Qi Cultivation Realm after condensing the six chakras, they combined them into what was known as a Diverse Mansion.

Once this Diverse Mansion was formed, the Juque Court, Shenyang Mansion, and Qihai Acupoints would be merged, and their body ceased to be the basis of cultivation. Instead, it became something like a boat on a sea of suffering in Buddhism cultivation.

The intricacies of this method were profound and mysterious, seemingly possessing a strange power that tried to draw the reader's spiritual sense into it, compelling them to follow the outlined cultivation path. Fortunately, this power was not strong, and the two quickly regained their senses after a moment of confusion.

Li Xuanxuan, knowing he did not have strong willpower, did not dare delve deeper and quickly released his grip on the jade slips.

"The Diverse Mansion... so the term Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace Technique refers to this..."

Li Yuanjiao had also heard about it when Mu Rongxia ventured south, mentioning something about nurturing a human head in the belly, though it was slightly different. In any case, cultivation paths varied greatly, making it hard to fully comprehend them.

Just recently, when I went to Cloud Crowned Peak Market, the four Foundation Establishment Realm devil cultivators surrounding it radiated the glow of immortal foundations... What does that mean then?

As Li Yuanjiao was busy pondering these thoughts, Li Xuanxuan silently picked up the black jade slip titled Blood Conversion Scripture.

CRACK!

With a squeeze, Li Xuanxuan crushed the jade slip and put away the remaining four. He turned to Li Yuanjiao and instructed, "Store these in a secret chamber. Having these methods as references will ensure our younger generations won't be caught unprepared when facing devil cultivators."

Li Yuanjiao nodded then picked up a jade bottle from the table, examining it carefully. The bottle was slightly larger than a typical pill bottle and was pale blue in color.

Using his spiritual sense to probe inside the bottle, he found it contained clear, cold spirit water with a faint black hue, about half a bottle's worth. It swirled as if it were a single entity, emitting waves of coldness that made Li Yuanjiao shiver.

He murmured softly, "Spirit water of heaven and earth..?"

Li Xuanxuan took it from him hurriedly and shivered from the cold. Though he had seen many spirit items in the market over the years, he had never encountered spirit water of heaven and earth.

"Perhaps it is? Or maybe it is some special kind of spiritual qi of heaven and earth..." he wondered aloud.

Seeing Li Yuanjiao carefully storing it away, he quickly added, "Better place it in the clan's vault just in case."

The remaining pills were scattered and few were usable. There were two blue bottles: one containing blood qi and the other containing resentment qi, roughly the essence of over a thousand people. There were also some heads and organs of Qi Cultivators, used for spellcasting, which they quickly buried.

Not knowing how to handle the two blue bottles, they decided to store them away for now. The thirty-odd Spirit Stones were the real prize, bringing Li Yuanjiao great relief.

The devil cultivator's loot was quite substantial, considering that typical Qi Cultivators carried only five or six Spirit Stones. This one had thirty-five, which was enough to keep the Li Family afloat for the next five years.

"It is a shame we cannot keep the storage pouch... It must be quite valuable with such a large space! The devil cultivator did not seem that powerful, I wonder where he stole it from..." Li Xuanxuan lamented.

Storage pouches were the easiest to tamper with, and even the pouches of the direct Li Family members had traps set within them. Given the urgency of the situation, he had not considered the pouch's quality and did not dare to keep it.

After dividing the spoils, both were in high spirits. Some clan guards arrived, followed by an old monkey about five chi tall, with a face full of wrinkles and intelligent eyes, silently bowing and looking up at Li Xuanxuan gratefully.

The old monkey had healed and was now free of the fire poison. Li Xuanxuan noticed its advanced age now that it was clean and groomed well enough. Washed clean of soot, its fur was snow-white. It was short and only reached up to Li Xuanxuan's chin.

"If I may I ask..." Li Xuanxuan hesitated, unsure whether to address it as a fellow Daoist or senior. He noticed that the monkey's throat seemed damaged, and was only able to make sounds. He asked gently, "What is your name?"

The old monkey shook its head, pointed to Li Xuanxuan, and then to its own forehead. Li Xuanxuan seemed to understand and asked, "Fellow Daoist, would you like to stay with us, the Li Family?"

The old monkey nodded repeatedly. Li Xuanxuan was overjoyed. This monkey, a Qi Cultivator at the fourth heavenly layer who likely understood medicine and spirit plants, was a valuable addition to his family.

"Well then, you shall be part of our family from now on and take our surname," Li Xuanxuan said tentatively.

The white monkey nodded, opened its mouth, and spat out a jade pestle. Li Yuanjiao, watching Li Xuanxuan accept it, was also delighted and commented, "The Wanglin Blossom on Mount Huaqian has yet to sprout. Maybe it could help."

Li Xuanxuan agreed and explained the situation to the monkey, then ordered a guard to escort it to the mountain. Turning back to Li Yuanjiao, he smiled and said, "Do not be fooled by those flashy dharma artifacts. This old monkey is far more valuable than them! Tomorrow, we will have it learn to write, record its knowledge and techniques, and our clan will gain another legacy."

"That's a brilliant idea, Father," Li Yuanjiao praised. He also had the same idea. He picked up the green jade pestle and mortar, both low-grade artifacts but valuable as a set.

He thought for a moment before saying, "These shall be named the Jade Pestle and Jade Mortar."

Li Xuanxuan's mouth twitched, realizing his son's lack of creativity in naming for the very first time. He shook his head and remarked, "I'm sure Guiluan is the one who named Xizhi, yes?"

"Yes," Li Yuanjiao replied, puzzled by his father's sudden question. Li Xuanxuan merely smiled and continued shaking his head in amusement.

Li Xuanxuan recuperated in the cave dwelling for several days. While waiting for news from Cloud Crowned Peak, Li Yuanjiao decided to stay on Mount Lijing and learn about family matters from his father.

Li Xuanxuan started from the death of his father, Li Changhu, speaking for two full days. Just then, a clan guard reported that Tian Youdao and An Zheyan had returned.

Tian Youdao, who broke through to the Qi Cultivation Realm at sixty, now looked like an old man, dressed in a gray robe. He was sent to check on the situation at Cloud Crowned Peak.

Cupping his fist solemnly, he reported, "Chen Taojing fought against four enemies, holding out for half a day before finally dying of exhaustion. Before his death, he shouted, The Great Ling Dao lineage is no more, shaking the heavens with his voice."[1]

Li Xuanxuan and Li Yuanjiao exchanged glances, both feeling a sense of foreboding. Tian Youdao continued in a serious tone, "With his death, the green water floated over Cloud Crowned Peak like rain and mist. The smoke rolled southward, carrying a group of devils with it."

"Southward?"

They both relaxed slightly. As long as the devils did not scatter across Lixia Prefecture, it was a good thing. Li Yuanjiao whispered, "Southward probably means toward places like Mushroom Forest Plain..."

This made the actions of these devil cultivators particularly suspicious. Originally gathered from places like Mushroom Forest Plain, they attacked the Xiao Family's market and then immediately returned home, clearly showing that they were targeting the Xiao Family.

After Tian Youdao finished his report and left, An Zheyan hurriedly approached. Though his personality was still rather carefree despite experiencing great ups and downs, he spoke in a brisk, fiery manner.

"Reporting to the Family Head! The great formation on the Xiao Family's Xianyou Peak was active for six days, isolating them completely and making us wait anxiously. When the formation finally lifted, the Xiao Family members only came out to lead us inside. We met with Young Master Guitu, who said that despite the attack, the Xiao Family suffered no major losses, only losing two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. The Daoist Master has returned to the peak, so there is no need for concern."

"So the Daoist Master has returned..." Li Yuanjiao waved him off. He was unable to discern how much of Xiao Guitu's words were true, but knowing that the Xiao Family was their backing, they had to believe it regardless.

"Let us just wait and see..." Li Xuanxuan muttered.

After An Zheyan left, the old monkey eagerly came forward. It communicated with Li Xuanxuan through gestures, and he finally understood the issue with Wanglin Blossom.

"The spirit spring on Mount Huaqian is insufficient; it cannot provide enough spiritual energy..." Li Yuanjiao repeated.

He remembered Wang Xun's remark about the fragility of the Wanglin Blossom. The spring on Mount Huaqian was clearly not enough to sustain this spirit root. After thinking it over, he suddenly said, "Among the eastern shore families... The Rui and Pu families near us seem to have a spirit spring, right?"

Sending troops to the eastern shore was already part of Li Yuanping's plan. It would resolve internal conflicts, tribute collection, and uphold righteousness, as those families used commoners as ingredients for their medicines.

"Given this, we must deal with those families." He sent word to Li Yuanping. Since the devil cultivators hadn't headed west, Li Yuanjiao didn't rush to consume the pill. Instead, he focused on cultivating, aiming to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm before the year's end.

With the market destroyed, Li Xuanxuan could not return, so he took advantage of the insights gained from his near-death experience to go into seclusion and cultivate. Li Qiuyang, having not spent time with his family for years, went home.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

It was snowing heavily at the end of the year.

Snow was rare in the past two years, making this year's end special. Perhaps it was meant to honor those who perished in the recent calamity as it fell even more heavily.

The world was blanketed in white. Li Yuanping stood on a high watchtower, looking down at the troops below, who were restless and shivering in the cold winter.

He brushed the snow off his clothes. Beside him stood Li Ximing, who was already nine years old and at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Wrapped in fur, he accompanied his father in the snow.

Li Yuanping's face remained pale, but compared to the past two years, it had become more withered, and his hair was slightly graying. He had dyed it black on purpose, which made him look a bit younger at least.

As the devil cultivators came and went, countless lives were lost along the way. It took the Li Family several months to gather information. Some said these devil cultivators had wandered to the territory of the Purple Smoke Gate, while others said they roamed the Mushroom Forest Plain.

It is the Yuan Family who should be worried, Li Yuanping thought to himself. Having dealt with the affairs of Mount Yue recently, he took the opportunity to settle the matters at home while the devil cultivators had yet to march toward Moongaze Lake.

This included his long-contemplated plan to deploy troops to the eastern shore and bring order to the chaotic families there.

"Family Head, it is time."

A youthful voice brought him back to reality. Before him stood Li Xicheng, clad in armor and holding a long spear. The experiences of recent years had matured him, making him more capable in both speech and action.

"Yes," Li Yuanping nodded, looking down once more at the troops below. They had been standing in the heavy snow for a while, appearing lethargic. The other four contingents had already set out, leaving only this one to depart.

Having received the order, Li Xicheng hurried down from the high platform and mounted his horse. The heavily armored horse beneath him had a cultivation level higher than his own and stood quietly in the snow.

"Hyah!"

Cold snowflakes scattered as he spurred his horse forward, leading the group of young soldiers through the snow-covered forest. He could not shake the confusion in his heart.

The eastern shore families are weak... With just one Qi Cultivator and a few Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, it would be an easy task. Why bother using the clan's younger members as soldiers? Isn't it unnecessary?

This time, the Li Family mobilized over five thousand people, divided into five groups. The other four groups were composed of clan soldiers, but due to a lack of manpower, Li Xicheng's group included young members of the clan, led by himself.

Maintaining a steady pace through the forest, Li Xicheng could not understand the clan's intentions. The snow fell softly, and his thoughts wandered.

The Family Head said it was to rectify the clan's customs, hence using the clan's young members as soldiers... But there had been no prior training, and suddenly we are marching through the snow at night. What use could it serve..?
ùöèùóøùó≤ùêûùö†ùïñùêõùóªùóºùêØùïñùöï.ùöåùóºùó∫

The more he thought about it, the more puzzled he became. This recruitment felt abrupt, almost like rounding up criminals, forcefully dragging the young members along. Most of them had bad records.

Suddenly, realization dawned upon him. Looking back at the soldiers trailing a dozen steps behind him, he gulped silently.

"Perhaps... they are not needed at all..."

1. Just my guess here, the Great Ling Dao lineage probably refers to the Lingyu Gate's lineage as the River One Qi Technique Chen Taojing cultivated originated from there. ‚òú
