# Chapter 1076: The Unblemished Robe

The one who had come alone to the Profound Governance Pavilion was, of course, Vast Cicada. He stood in the great hall, sleeves tucked, looking both awkward and resigned.

"Lord Wei Xuanyin was offering sincere guidance... but I completely missed the point!"

When Vast Cicada had first left the Profound Governance Pavilion, Wei Xuanyin, knowing he was bound for the south, had offered a few extra warnings out of respect for the Tao family's kindness. But how could this monk possibly have listened? He had sneered inwardly, convinced that Wei Xuanyin was merely trying to stop him so he could seize the Bright Yang's destiny for himself. Now, returning in disgrace, he finally understood that Wei Xuanyin's words had been entirely true.

Hearing his words, the white-robed man flicked his sleeves and rose from the main seat, sighing.

"In the confrontation between North and South, the game hinges on hidden and open pieces. My North plays the white stones, crushing others with overt power. The South plays black, seizing victory through cunning and surprise. Li Ximing is an open piece; Yang Ruiyi will inevitably do all he can to protect him. To kill him, you must rely on the unexpected. And right now, your only unexpected move is the Precious Tusk Golden Land."

His gaze grew sharp.

"But are you truly willing to part with it? If the Precious Tusk Golden Land manifests on the lake and is suppressed, the Dharma Realm will have every justification to step in. They will undoubtedly reclaim the Golden Land. Can you afford such a gamble?"

Vast Cicada sighed endlessly.

"You see it clearly, my lord. It was only my own petty heart that refused to listen to counsel. The destiny tied to slaying Bright Yang is wonderful, true, but if I lose the Golden Land... it's hard to say who will be slaying whom in the future."

He was here to beg, after all. He lowered his stance, thoroughly debasing himself before finally revealing his true purpose.

"Fortunately... I now have a much clearer picture of Li Ximing's capabilities. My chances of success are greater now."

He bowed awkwardly.

"It's just... is it possible for me to continue serving you, my lord, and remain in Jiangbei?"

The monk understood the situation perfectly. The Great Adoration Dharma Realm wanted him to stay in Jiangbei. However, Mount Dayang had suffered disastrous losses this time. Many on the mountain were already watching the Dharma Realm with suspicion, and someone needed to take the fall. If Qi Lanyan continued to press the matter, and Jiang Toushou filed a formal complaint and shifted the blame, Vast Cicada would inevitably be unable to stay.

The only person who could possibly appease Qi Lanyan... was the master of this Profound Governance Pavilion.

But Wei Xuanyin's expression was calm. He shook his head.

"At the assembly of the various Daos, Fellow Daoist Yao already decreed that Martial-Nephew Qi would have full authority over Jiangbei's affairs, while I would focus on containing the Shu region. Why do you come asking me?"

Vast Cicada, his words blocked, grew even more awkward. He paced anxiously for two steps. Wei Xuanyin sighed.

"Return to Jiangbei. This is a matter you must discuss with Martial-Nephew Qi in person. Go and see him—be bold about it."

Vast Cicada had been thoroughly and miserably outplayed by Qi Lanyan; how could he dare to face him? He was about to beg for mercy, but one look at Wei Xuanyin's expression made him swallow his words, his mind sinking into contemplative silence.

Wei Xuanyin remained silent.

'That martial-nephew of mine is iron-willed on holding Jiangbei. How could he possibly let go of a powerful asset like Vast Cicada?'

'Lanyan has far too few people under his command. His repeated schemes were all designed to make Vast Cicada lose prestige and support on Mount Dayang, leaving him with no more room for error. Only then would the monk be forced to obey his every command... He never intended to drive him away. He's probably even planning to sell the Dharma Realm a favor, bypassing Mount Dayang to ally with them directly!'

Wei Xuanyin had practically raised the man; how could he not see through such a simple ploy?

'To Lanyan, it doesn't matter who hinders Bright Yang, as long as they are substantial enough to reduce the chance of King Wei succeeding in his quest—or even to kill Li Ximing outright. The Buddhist cultivators certainly share this goal, but they are only half-allies. They want the karmic destiny of Bright Yang to fall to their own Dao, not to any other, leading to mutual interference... He is trying to consolidate his power.'

As Wei Xuanyin mused, Vast Cicada's expression slowly cleared. He began to understand where his true path out of this predicament lay, and joy bloomed in his heart.

'No wonder! No wonder Jiang Toushou already sent a message to Mount Dayang, yet Qi Lanyan made no move! I assumed Wei Xuanyin had suppressed the news. So this was the real reason!'

Overjoyed, Vast Cicada bowed and offered his thanks repeatedly before departing in a hurry. His figure quickly vanished over the edge of the Profound Governance Pavilion's vast stairs. Wei Xuanyin watched him go, then rose from the main seat. He lifted his left hand, turning it palm-up to reveal a surface as smooth and white as jade.

A pinpoint of flickering, unstable color leaped from his palm. As it did, Wei Xuanyin's entire form began to change. His shoulders narrowed, his long hair billowed out, and his eyes grew rounder, gradually taking on a dark, grayish luster.

He tilted his head, listening intently for a long time. His gaze flickered, bright and dark. Only when the moon had climbed high in the sky did he finally retrieve a small jade bottle from his sleeve.

The bottle was about a finger tall, sealed with a white jade stopper. With a slight shake, it instantly shattered, releasing a surging, transformative wisp of purple-and-white qi that coiled around his fingertips.

But Wei Xuanyin remained silent, his brows knitted tightly as he stared at the wisp of qi.

'This is the fourth portion... and the last one Fellow Daoist Yao left behind. I cannot afford to fail again.'

This wisp of qi looked insignificant, but its value was beyond words. It was the Flawless Deficient Yin, the material required to cultivate the final divine ability of the Veiled Yin Dao: the Life Divine Ability known as the Unblemished Robe!

In the current era, the lineage for cultivating Flawless Deficient Yin was severed. To obtain this qi, one had to acquire the "Yin-Leap Qi" from the Supreme Yin Dao and convert it through a complex series of transformations.

But the Supreme Yin Dao had been hidden for many years. Every portion of Supreme Yin Moon Radiance was precious, and the Yin-Leap Qi was just as rare. Although a fair amount had been passed down in the Immortal Mansions of the South, the supply was finite. If he failed again... Wei Xuanyin's path to the Dao could be stalled for a dozen, or even several dozen, years.

This terrifying prospect made Wei Xuanyin stare at the qi in his palm, his expression fraught with uncertainty.

The Unblemished Robe was the most difficult divine ability of the Veiled Yin path to achieve. It was once also called the "Robe of Concealed Flaws." If cultivated through the orthodox Daoist Tradition, it could "cover all omissions, smooth all errors, achieve a flawless state, and perfect the yin body." It perfectly corresponded with the concept of consummation, which was why it was meant to be the final ability one cultivated.

Of course, in Zong Chang's Dao Lineage, it was called the "Strange Minister's Boon." It was a crude substitute, really, and didn't even require the Flawless Deficient Yin. Its core concept had already fallen completely into the demonic path, so it was naturally not so difficult to achieve.

'But no matter how difficult it is, it shouldn't have caused me to fail three times!'

Wei Xuanyin was a genius rarely seen in the world. His Dao-Profundity was extremely high. While he couldn't compare to the ancestor, Wei Guanyan, who founded the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao, his cultivation had long since surpassed that of his late master, Tao Ping. And even Tao Ping had only failed twice when cultivating the Unblemished Robe!

'Could it be that the Dao itself has changed with the passage of time? But in all these years, Bright Yang has not been restored, and no one else has successfully cultivated the Veiled Yin path...'

This mystery spread like a shadow in his heart. In the end, Wei Xuanyin pulled his hand back. The shattered jade bottle reformed in his palm as if time were flowing backward, resealing the wisp of qi. He placed the bottle on the table, remaining utterly silent.

'...If any remains from the old Immortal Mansions, it is possible the various houses of the Supreme Yang might still possess some...'

---

Clouds drifted through the mountains. The distant tremors quickly faded, and a flurry of white snow drifted down from the treetops, piling up beside the jade benches. Li Ximing stood alone on the summit, pacing thoughtfully.

'The people from Mount Dayang have retreated to Bianyan...'

He paced the summit in disbelief, unfurling the golden scroll in his hand. A few lines of large characters were written across it. Li Ximing read them over and over, his heart filled with emotion.

'Conferred as the General Who Pacifies the Huai, and concurrently as the Military Commissioner of Golden Tang...'

This was no small reward. The title of Military Commissioner of Golden Tang was already on par with Liu Bai's command over the Protectorate of the Tranquil Sea. Adding the rank of General Who Pacifies the Huai on top of that effectively made him the head of the military, granting him control over the entire situation in the North.

With the Buddhist cultivators in retreat and the dust settling, Yang Ruiyi would soon return to the Wilderness to keep a watch on Shanji. Tangdao Mountain would then be handed over to Situ Huo. The entire region, from Caishan to the White River, would fall under Situ Huo's command.

'Cheng Qian, myself, and even Tinglan... we will all be under his command now.'

He gave a bitter smile.

"So, it was Situ Huo all along!"

A man standing nearby shook his head slightly.

"Thinking about it now, it really couldn't have been anyone else..."

The man was not tall and had a reserved expression. His face was fair as jade, marked with a vermilion dot between his brows. The spiritual-light around him was profound and unpredictable, giving him an air of someone truly detached from the mortal world.

This man's surname was Lian, given name Wo. He was Daoist Master Cheng Qian of Overlook Peak, a cultivator of the Whole Pill Dao. Though not old, he was the favored disciple of Daoist Master Xianyao, a Purple Mansion Realm rogue cultivator.

Daoist Master Xianyao cultivated on Overlook Peak and was said to be very old. Li Ximing had heard of his Dao lineage before but had never seen any of its followers in the world. Only after asking did he learn that Daoist Master Xianyao was a rogue cultivator.

'Daoist Master Xianyao never established a sect. He simply raised his immortal mountain high into the clouds, concealed it with a grand formation, and thus isolated himself from the myriad of lesser cultivators. There are no formal disciples on the mountain, only a few pupils and his kin, which is why he is known as a rogue cultivator.'

Although both were called rogue cultivators, Daoist Master Xianyao was far more thorough in his isolation than Daoist Master Changxi. When people cursed Daoist Master Changxi and called him a rogue cultivator, it was mostly an insult; he had, in fact, established a formal Dao lineage, but it was one so insignificant that no one paid it any mind.

Seeing that Cheng Qian was easy to talk to, Li Ximing had asked about his past. He had achieved his Dao around the time the Great Ning Palace fell, making him older than Li Ximing.

Despite this, he remained extremely humble toward Li Ximing. He had originally called him 'Senior' at every turn, and only after Li Ximing's gentle insistence did he switch to 'Fellow Daoist,' though he remained just as polite.

Li Ximing had been at Caishan, which was just at the foot of the peak, for some time now and had gotten to know him.

'This man may be sheltered, but he is exceptionally intelligent. You'd never guess he spent his entire life before the Purple Mansion Realm cultivating on a mountain. After all, one would need a great deal of wisdom to reach the Purple Mansion Realm almost entirely as a rogue cultivator.'

Now, hearing his comment, Li Ximing turned to ask,

"Why do you say that?"

Cheng Qian smiled humbly.

"My old ancestor has some friendship with him and has met him a few times. His spiritual boots are incredibly formidable. They were found by Situ Tang in the First-Layer Mountain. If you're just talking about spiritual boots, probably none in all of Jiangnan can compare. Having held on for this long, he was bound to throw himself into the North-South war; it was only a question of with whom he would ultimately side with."

Li Ximing nodded. He shook his sleeve, and the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body emerged, already perfectly restored. It was whole and complete, pulsing with a faint, deep light, looking even more vivid than it had originally.

'The Supreme Yin Moon Radiance is truly incredible. My Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body has already returned to its peak, far faster than my own body is healing...'

The injuries he'd sustained this time were nearly as severe as those from his duel with Helian Wujiang. However, with the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body absorbing much of the damage, his situation was far better. After the battle on the lake ended and Vast Cicada's group retreated, Li Ximing had immediately consumed a Treasured Star Body-Spirit Pill to prevent any further complications. The ancient pill's effects were excellent, but full recovery was not a matter of a few short days.

'Vast Cicada...'

That monk's power had far exceeded Li Ximing's imagination. Aside from his status as a Bright Yang descendant, the most important factor was the four words Tinglan and the others kept repeating: Precious Tusk Golden Land.

Li Ximing only half-understood what it was, but he had a strong feeling it was related to the Precious Tusk Temple that had trapped him during the fight. It was almost certainly that wondrous art that could pull a person into its multiple layers.

'The first layer was the plaza before the temple. The second was the great hall with the five golden statues. There was an even deeper inner chamber beyond that, but the Xuan-Ox interrupted before I was pulled in...'

The reason Li Ximing had instantly taken out the Prosperous Dragon Pearl was because he had sensed an profound crisis... Tinglan had mentioned this monk was even more powerful in the North. It was entirely possible he had already been restricted while fighting on the lake!

'Vast Cicada will be a terrible threat in the future. I must find out more about this Precious Tusk Golden Land. I heard it was a relic left by the Undefeated King of Brightness... If it could be used to aid the Bright Yang cause, it would be an incredible boon.'

He had specifically asked the Daoist Master beside him, but unfortunately, Cheng Qian knew nothing about it, having never even heard the name. Li Ximimg could only drop the subject. But now that his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was restored, his mind was already calculating his next move.

'The Northern cultivators have retreated and lack the ability to launch another attack in the short term. This might be my chance to get away... perhaps to go overseas...'

He still had another item in his sleeve: a fist-sized, crystal-clear glazed pearl. It was the Prosperous Dragon Pearl given to him by the old Daoist Master of Mount Qusi, which had once sealed the Unfettered Xuan-Ox.

This Prosperous Dragon Pearl had been an immense help in the great battle; its importance could not be overstated. Li Ximing felt strongly that he should make a trip to Mount Qusi to return the item to its owner and express his gratitude.

'Since he rushed to send the Prosperous Dragon Pearl to the lake, he must have known about the power of the Precious Tusk Golden Land and sent it specifically to help me... He almost certainly knows the details!'

On the other hand, Li Ximing knew that no pie falls from the sky. The more eager Mount Qusi seemed to help, the more questions he had.

'It's good that the Mount Qusi lineage is friendly, but I can't let this debt of gratitude grow too large. I must clearly understand their motives before I can decide how to proceed.'

Of course, this was only one of his reasons for wanting to leave. Just as important was the appearance of this new Military Commissioner of Golden Tang, Situ Huo!

'Yang Ruiyi has always treated me well. If I were to personally ask him for leave to step away, he would almost certainly agree. But once Yang Ruiyi returns to the Wilderness and Situ Huo takes command of Tangdao Mountain, things will be completely different!'

Li Ximing was keenly aware that his relationship with the Golden Tang Gate was far from good; in truth, there was significant enmity between them. It was only because Situ Tang had a greater talent for making enemies—having offended just about everyone—that the grudge between them seemed comparatively minor.

Even so, Li Ximing had no desire to be ordered around by him. It was best to get out while he could, before the official transfer of power, to avoid a mountain of trouble later.

And so, under the pretext of entering seclusion to heal, he went into his cave-dwelling. He immediately drew up a golden scroll, stating with great sincerity that his own strength was meager and he wished to borrow the power of Mount Qusi to help defend the Great Song. He sent this scroll into the Great Void, then immediately calmed his mind and focused on his recovery.

'Even if I am not permitted to leave, I must recover my strength as quickly as possible to face whatever troubles may come...'
