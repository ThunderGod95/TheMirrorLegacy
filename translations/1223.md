# Chapter 1223: Desert Battle

‘So it truly is a Lesser Yang spiritual formation…’

Radiance rippled through the Great Void. As a faint gray light enveloped the sky, the towering white pillar in the distance grew ever clearer. Shangguan Mi gave it a cursory glance, only to hear a cold sneer beside his ear:

“I wonder which Daoist tradition this is, to have set up a ‘Lesser Yang’ grand formation… In this day and age, what great Daoist tradition of the Lesser Yang would ever be passed down to that Wei villain.”

Qing Jifang could tell at a glance that this was not the style of Jiangnan, and wasted no more time, saying only:

“Daoist Master Ni!”

As he spoke, a man immediately stepped forward in the Great Void. He appeared prim and proper, but his aura was unstable. One of his eyes was blind, the socket a dark void riddled with wounds from metal, covering half his face. It was none other than Daoist Master Hongyan of the Ni clan.

This Daoist Master was once a pillar of the Sword Gate, but had entered the Kingdom of Shu due to shifting circumstances. Because he hadn't put forth his full effort in the desert back then, Qing Jifang held a grudge against him, working him to the bone for the past few years. It could be said he faced tribulations annually.

This Daoist Master was entirely different from Li Muyan. After all, he was the sole Daoist Master of the Ni clan and had disciples cultivating at the Sword Gate. He held no extravagant hopes for reward in the Kingdom of Shu, knowing that self-preservation was paramount. He appeared deferential on the surface, but when faced with danger, he would flee without hesitation—upon encountering a powerful foe on the Tao River, he turned and ran without a second thought, stunning Jiang Yan who had traveled from afar. Yet, it was precisely because of this that he managed to carve a path to survival from a desperate situation where all his mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm colleagues had fallen.

Yet Qing Jifang was a cruel and vindictive man. He spared no thought for Wang Long who had died in battle, nor did he show the slightest kindness to Wang Long's junior, Wang Yi, at his side. Instead, seeing Hongyan flee back to Shu in one breath, thereby lessening the infamy on his own name, he revealed a look of considerable approval. Finding Hongyan more pleasing to the eye, his tone surprisingly softened:

“Go and test the grand formation. If you make any headway, yours will be the primary credit!”

Hongyan sneered inwardly but cupped his fist in salute, steeling himself as he descended from the Great Void. Soon, he neared the grand formation shimmering with white light, sighed to himself, and raised the spiritual jade in his hand.

Almost the instant he appeared, a brilliant torrent of Radiant Fire poured down, flashing before him. A figure had yet to arrive, but laughter already drifted over:

“I have long heard of Senior Ni's great name! To what do I owe the pleasure of this distant visit?”

Hongyan stood silently. The apricot-red flames before him flickered, and a young master in crimson, gold-patterned robes emerged. He had thick, black hair bound by a dark crown and a golden hairpin, with only two loose strands fluttering at his temples. His eyes were long and narrow, his brows set a bit close, and his eyes glinted with a golden light, as if golden flames danced within.

The youth stood with his hands behind his back, a smile on his face, as eager as a host welcoming a guest. He remained close to the grand formation, however, ready to retreat inside with a single step. Hongyan gave him a slightly surprised look and said in a low voice:

“King Wei has raised a formation in the desert, encroaching upon our territory. I have been ordered to attack.”

Hongyan's reply was perfectly delivered, leaving no room for maneuver. The instant his voice fell, a hazy flame erupted from his five fingers, forming into a spear that shot straight for Li Jiangqian's face!

The hazy fire surged forth, rolling through the sky like an ocean wave, threatening to engulf the young man before him.

Molten Fire Divine Ability: Sire of the High Mounds!

Bright flames swiftly crawled across Hongyan's face like a luminous golden tattoo. The aura of the spear in his hand swelled as it shot forward.

The spear, flying with lightning speed, let out a hum as it was stopped mid-air by a plain-looking bronze basin. Hongyan, however, felt a scorching heat on his face, and his peripheral vision caught a glimpse of apricot-amber.

Southern Brightness Heart-Fire!

Though Hongyan did not recognize the object, he could still feel a faint stinging on his face. With a flip of his palm, the spiritual jade leaped out and transformed before him into a small jade pagoda, instantly suppressing the flames.

“Senior!”

Hongyan looked up to find the youth's appearance utterly transformed. His chest had become faintly transparent, revealing churning flames that rose and fell as if a Golden Core were floating within. Beams of Li-Light radiated out, so bright they made one's eyes ache.

Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument!

The moment this Spiritual Treasure appeared, he felt an intangible suppressive force emerge. His already injured dharma body grew sluggish, just as a piercing golden beam erupted from his opponent's chest.

Hongyan instantly gathered his energy, bringing two fingers together before his chest and projecting a similar beam of blazing dharma light!

“BOOM!”

The two beams of light clashed in the sky for a moment, but Hongyan's expression turned grim. The flame within his dark, empty eye socket flickered once before dying out, its strength failing. Correspondingly, the glow of the Molten Fire in the sky began to weaken, diminishing at a visible pace.

It had been a great fortune for him to escape the Tao River with his life. Far from being healed, his metal-inflicted wounds still festered with a foreign divine ability that he had yet to purge. Had his Molten Fire not been a rare fire-aspected Dao with healing properties, he would have collapsed long ago!

Fortunately, his opponent's Li-Light seemed to have been unleashed in haste and was on the verge of losing control, giving him a moment's respite. He quickly evaded and began to urgently regulate his internal energies.

Li Jiangqian's figure emerged from the Li Baleful Qi of the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument that blanketed the sky. The eldest young master of King Wei raised a hand to the golden hairpin in his hair. With a pull and a twist, the chopstick-like pin transformed into a profound golden spear adorned with Li patterns!

He raised his arm, pointing the long spear to the heavens. Treading upon the roiling Li Baleful Qi, he had an air of utter boredom as he spoke with contempt:

“Senior, your injuries are not light. I'm afraid you're no match for me. A fight would likely cost you your life. Why don't you have that Qing fellow come himself!”

Hongyan's energy was already in disarray, and hearing the youth address him repeatedly as 'Senior' actually made him pause.

‘Such arrogance!’

At these words, Qing Jifang's expression in the Great Void darkened. He shot a gloomy glance toward Qing Zhuo behind him. The middle-aged man was pinching his fingers in calculation, frowning and shaking his head as he whispered:

“Something is obscuring my calculations… strange… It would be best to be cautious.”

Qing Jifang could only say in a low voice:

“Wang Yi, grant him his wish!”

A divine ability instantly flared and shot down from above. It was a lean man dressed in hemp mourning clothes, a sword in his hand and a grim, cold expression on his face.

But the moment he landed in the mortal realm, the grand formation lying dormant on the ground like a colossal beast flared to life, its brilliance erupting outward. The man instantly felt a scalp-tingling sense of danger!

‘Not good!’

The Li-mist abruptly parted, revealing a Daoist Master in gold and white robes seated cross-legged in the center, having appeared at some unknown time. He was shrouded in a faint glow of Supreme Yin light, and from his palm rose a vast, majestic beam of light covered in innumerable runes!

‘Li Ximing!’

Great Parting Golden Radiance!

“Puh!”

The Daoist Master had only just appeared, and though he was on guard, he only managed to slightly turn his body before the great Dharma Art struck him full-on. He coughed up several mouthfuls of blood and plummeted from the sky like a bird with a broken wing, crashing somewhere into the desert below.

Li Que'wan held a Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, secretly empowering a concealment effect so that the immense disturbance from Li Ximing's casting went completely unnoticed in the Great Void. Though they failed to lure out Qing Jifang, Li Jiangqian felt no regret and instead retreated decisively.

Indeed, as the pillar of light illuminated the sky, Qing Jifang's expression remained unchanged, and he paid no mind to whether Wang Yi lived or died. Instead, his face lit up with glee as he manifested as a cloud of gray qi, his divine ability aimed squarely at the seated Li Ximing! At the same time, he bellowed:

“Daoist Master Danyin!”

In response to his call, a speck of red suddenly lit up the dim Great Void. An aged hand abruptly shot out, already nearly upon Li Ximing, clawing straight for his back.

Great Daoist Master of the Sun clan—Danyin!

The Great Daoist Master's capability was evident from his first move. Some unknown divine ability or spiritual artifact responded, causing the Great Void to stagnate as if one were wading through a mire. Although it wasn't a complete lockdown, it was still enough to plunge him into a dangerous predicament!

What was worse, the winds in the Great Void began to howl as another Daoist Master arrived, riding his divine ability, manipulating metal and fire. It was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Qiu family, one of the Nine Surnames, intending to cut off his retreat!

“You truly think highly of me!”

Li Ximing showed no fear. He opened his eyes, a smile on his face.

Did he dare to leave the formation and use such a powerful Dharma Art without any precautions? A golden disc had already lit up within his sleeve. Four bright stars suddenly reversed their course, and a brilliant radiance exploded outward!

‘Sun-Surging inverted, disorderly stars shaken!’

Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!

This ceremonial artifact, which had performed miraculous feats time and again, blazed with light. Four points of brilliant gold separated to shield him as Li Ximing's figure vanished—the compass shifted one's position in the mortal world, making it immune to the Great Void's lockdown!

‘The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass…’

The moment this light appeared, the expression of Qing Zhuo, who was holding the line in the Great Void, flickered for an instant.

‘They really took it out. Did that Daoist Master on the lake truly have the skill to eradicate the problem early on, or is Li Zhouwei just toughing it out?’

But Qing Jifang in front wasn't thinking about that. He merely frowned, and after a brief pause, a speck of gold lit up before him in the Great Void.

A spiritual sword surging with a heaven-piercing golden aura!

Qing Jifang was not afraid. Instead, he gave a cold laugh:

“I knew you were here!”

Dense gray qi gathered between his two fingers, and he clamped down on the spiritual sword as if plucking something from a bag. No matter how the sword's body let out sharp, piercing hums, it could not break free!

‘If Cheng Xunzhi were here, I would naturally have to spit up some blood. But you? A nobody, and you dare stand in my way!’

The owner of this sword was none other than Cheng Jiuwen!

Qing Jifang's foul temper was one thing, but as a direct descendant of the Qing family, his divine abilities were by no means ordinary. He had clamped the Sword Gate Daoist Master's spiritual sword between just two fingers!

But Cheng Jiuwen watched him calmly. The three divine abilities behind him flared brightly. Qing Jifang immediately released his fingers as a round pearl in his hand leaped up to suppress the Daoist Master. His eyes still held a look of disdain as he formed a hand seal and chanted:

“By Qi's decree, the Profound Mountain suppresses all!”

As his words echoed, the pearl in the sky transformed. The gray qi there roiled like a cyclone, sweeping away all the golden qi in the sky. It even began to wrest control of the spiritual sword from Cheng Jiuwen's hand, attempting to draw it into the Spiritual Treasure!

The spiritual sword in Cheng Jiuwen's hand was not bad, but he ultimately lacked Sword Intent. Under such a powerful divine ability and dharma power, he seemed on the verge of collapsing. Worse still, the Great Void behind him suddenly trembled. A cultivator wielding twin maces emerged, wreathed in a dense purple light, and smashed them toward the back of his head!

Shangguan Mi!

Although this Daoist Master's divine abilities were not profound, he was a valiant warrior. With the interference from Mount Changhuai's supreme Spiritual Treasure above, Cheng Jiuwen fell silent for a moment and immediately reached for his sleeve.

But as he did so, he felt a solemn, almost tangible gaze from the Great Void stab into his face. Cheng Jiuwen expressionlessly blocked the incoming twin maces and looked toward the Great Void, where he saw a Daoist Master in gray-green robes watching him with a burning intensity.

Daoist Master Guanlan, Qing Zhuo.

This direct descendant of Mount Changhuai was holding the line in the Great Void. Though he said nothing, he was already pinching a gray talisman in his hand, his gaze calm and forceful.

Cheng Jiuwen's expression grew heavy. He held back for the moment, understanding the other's meaning:

‘The techniques of my Sword Gate can be used against anyone… except a direct descendant of the Qing clan, and especially not against the Qing clan's Spiritual Treasure… He's holding the line in the Great Void, so he absolutely has a mission to protect Qing Jifang and the inherited Spiritual Treasure…’

But in that brief exchange of glances, Qing Jifang had already soared up, weaving several times through the sword light Cheng Jiuwen had barely managed to raise to block him, and headed straight for the grand formation!

At the same time, divine abilities of every color dyed the sky in a dazzling display. Three figures at the initial stage of the Purple Mansion Realm appeared, attempting to surround the streak of Radiant Fire that was rapidly retreating through the sky.

Li Jiangqian took a step back, his back to the grand formation. He joined forces with Cheng Qian, who had rushed out, brandishing his long spear while his gaze took in the larger situation.

His expression was grim. He seemed to casually glance across the Great Void, but he noticed another area with booming thunder and golden qi that lit up all directions. His heart sank instantly.

‘Changyun didn't come, only Zhong Qian is here. He's holding back that Qiu family Daoist Master from the Nine Surnames in the Great Void… Although he has the upper hand, defeating his enemy won't be a quick affair.’

‘Grand-uncle is in trouble…’

On the other side, Li Ximing had just escaped on the starlight. Before he could even catch his breath after appearing before the formation, a figure materialized like a phantom.

This person was dressed in red, with white hair and a face full of wrinkles. His eyes were colorless but held a cold, resolute look, like a falcon. He stood quietly where Li Ximing had landed, and without a word, he looked up, the colors in his palm rising and falling like waves:

Divine Ability: Falcon's Roost.

‘Gathering Wood!’

Li Ximing had encountered Gathering Wood cultivators before; Daoist Master Luo from the Southern Borderlands back then was a Gathering Wood Purple Mansion cultivator. But Daoist Master Luo was a minor cultivator from a desolate land, while the Danyin before him was a Great Daoist Master of 'Gathering Wood'!

The moment Falcon's Roost was unleashed, its aura was completely different. A sense of danger erupted in Li Ximing's heart. He didn't hesitate to form a seal and cast a spell, summoning a field of blazing, brilliant light with the Light of the Six Harmonies.

Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire!

The flames pounced like a vicious wolf, smashing against the gray-green light. Like a hot coal falling into snow, it instantly bloomed with thousands of fire sparks, creating countless expanding holes. The red-robed Great Daoist Master's expression wavered slightly.

Li Ximing's guess was correct. The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire was renowned for its might, and Danyin cultivated 'Gathering Wood'. Even as a Great Daoist Master, he couldn't afford to be careless. He released the divine ability in his hand and produced an object from his sleeve.

The object was a bowl, crafted from jadeite, with an ancient and simple design. Only the words 'Mount Changhuai' were carved on its rim. As the old Daoist Master gave a gentle wave of his hand, a green light poured out from within, transforming into a sky-filling waterfall!

‘Converging Water!’

Merging Fire could make all things retreat, could solidify lead and mercury, and incinerate wood and earth; in battle, it had almost no natural enemies. Only between water and fire could this True Hornless Dragon, also a Great Sage, contend with it! Seeing the words 'Mount Changhuai' on the bowl, Li Ximing understood:

‘He came prepared!’

Although his Merging Fire was endlessly powerful, it was temporarily suppressed by the waterfall-like Converging Water. The Great Daoist Master before him seized this fleeting opportunity, his divine abilities flaring as he attacked with his full strength!

Gathering of Bitter Herbs!

In an instant, an ocean of jade-green spread out, and countless plants and trees covered everything, carrying a strong intent of imprisonment and sealing. The heavy, muddy feeling of the Great Void appeared once more. Li Ximing went all out, and a bright Celestial Gate descended from the heavens, crashing down upon the ocean!

“BOOM!”

A dull sound echoed through the night sky. To Li Ximing's astonishment and alarm, 'Audience with the Celestial Gate,' which had always been known for suppression and refinement, simply sank into the woods without making much of a splash.

‘Not good!’

Li Ximing's plan was thrown into disarray in an instant. He was greatly horrified, but the Great Daoist Master showed no surprise and had already taken a step forward, the light of Falcon's Roost once again appearing in his hand!

Though it wasn't a suppression technique, Li Ximing felt his entire body turn sluggish, his movements slowing several times over. He already had the Huai River Map in his hand, but it was unfurling at a turtle's pace.

His opponent's divine ability was already at his face.

At this critical juncture, the Daoist Master decisively gave up on moving. The Qingchi at his waist suddenly responded, sending out ripples of blue-green water that slowed the incoming divine ability by half a beat!

Following that was a surge of vast purple water that enveloped Li Ximing. With a powerful tug, it actually managed to pull him a whole zhang away from the divine ability's path. The palm strike missed its mark, finally landing on his chest.

Li Ximing's face turned pale in an instant, but from behind him leaped a brilliant light of the Lesser Yang!

Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil Spirit Formation!

Ministerial Fire.

The nature of this light was peculiar. It easily passed through the divine abilities covering Danyin and struck the Great Daoist Master without any hindrance, causing him to pause for a moment. With this brief respite, not only did Li Ximing move away, but the Huai River Map also flew up, and a radiant pass erupted from it, suppressing the verdant light!

“BOOM!”

The entire desert lit up. Danyin spat out a mouthful of flame, his expression still calm, but he abruptly raised his head. Another person had appeared in the sky, surrounded by vast purple waters, looking ethereal and otherworldly. He laughed:

“The old codger has become a Great Daoist Master!”

“Yehui?”

Danyin was clearly somewhat familiar with him, and a trace of disdain flashed in his eyes:

“A dog that fled from a lost battle and betrayed its master!”

Yehui was unconcerned, a smile on his face. The Great Void behind him rippled continuously, as if something were about to break through. He planted one foot on the Spiritual Treasure, helping Li Ximing pin down the man before them, while his other hand drew a sword technique. He held it three inches before his lower abdomen, the blade's edge rising past his brow, and said faintly:

“Three Sanctuaries Profound, I pray, summon the All-Governing Spirit.”

The moment his voice fell, the Daoist Master's eyes turned a startling gold.

This gold was not like Li Zhouwei's; it filled his entire eyes, a brilliant, piercing gold that was like light and lightning, captivating the soul. And the moment he finished speaking, two objects finally broke through the Great Void behind him!

One was round like a jade ball, covered in lightning patterns and suffused with an extremely dense heavenly thunder. The other was a palm-sized talisman, black with white patterns, emitting a brilliant light that suppressed a surging, unceasing fire of destruction. A pair of illusory golden arms extended from Yehui's back, one left and one right, grabbing the two objects and smashing them downward!

‘Hm?’

For the first time, Danyin's expression changed drastically. He was filled with shock and uncertainty as he desperately raised his hands, gathering all his divine abilities before him.

“BOOM!”

The entire desert turned stark white.

The piercing white light caused the entire desert to tremble violently. Numerous gazes shot over, and only then did they see his appearance, all showing looks of horror.

Yehui's blue robes billowed. His once nimble eyes were now filled with a rich gold that spread across his face from the corners of his eyes like cracks. His once neatly tied black hair whipped about wildly in the wind. The heavenly thunder and fire in his hands were exceptionally strange, connecting to the heavens in a berserk, unending torrent!

His figure only flickered for a moment in the white light that illuminated the world before landing in front of the Great Daoist Master. In the brief instant that followed, hundreds of punches infused with heavenly thunder and fire had already landed on the barrier of green light the Great Daoist Master had erected!

“BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM…”

Danyin was already at a disadvantage against thunder and fire. As the explosive thunderfire rained down, his divine abilities finally shattered, and he shot away like an arrow released from its string, plunging deep into the desert and causing a world-shaking boom!

Yehui seemed like a different person. His cold and calm demeanor was gone. Laughing loudly, he leaped into the air and followed, diving into the desert and stomping down hard:

“BOOM!”

The desert lit up again for a moment. For a time, this man was like a god, with thunder and fire connecting heaven and earth, an awe-inspiring sight. In coordination with Li Ximing's Spiritual Treasure, he had managed to temporarily gain the upper hand against a Great Daoist Master!

The Daoist Master in the white and gold robes had just recovered from that palm strike. He spat out a mouthful of blood and stared blankly at the sky. Looking at his old acquaintance controlling thunder and fire like a deity, he was in utter disbelief:

‘Is this… Yehui?’

‘With this kind of divine ability… what was the point of all that trouble with Changxi… Oh… no wonder he was so disdainful back then. If not for the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and my intervention, he could have beaten that old senior to death right through the Profound Peak Gate's grand formation!’

But he had no time to be surprised. A dense gray wind was already blowing towards him. The gray-robed man's gaze was cold and venomous, like a sharp sword that wanted to pierce him with a thousand holes!

Qing Jifang.

He returned the look with a cold laugh, placed two fingers to his lips, and with a forceful puff, blew out a brilliantly incandescent white flame:

Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire!

Qing Jifang gave his sleeve a gentle shake. The cuff opened wide, shimmering with light, and from it leaped a dense mass of earthen mountains, one after another, to block the flames. His other hand flipped, and a white jade fan appeared, which he waved gently!

A gray wind surged out, smashing head-on towards Li Ximing. He forcefully suppressed the injuries within his body and shook his sleeve. The Heavenly Nurture Urn had already leaped up. Even though this Spiritual Treasure was being used in a hurry, with a turn of its mouth, it still sucked in all of the gray wind.

What Li Ximing had not expected was that under the cover of the roiling gray wind, the white jade fan itself had flown over at some point. It was before him in an instant, just at that awkward moment when his old strength was spent and new strength had yet to be born. His Huai River Map was even still suppressing Danyin and could not be moved. He could only channel the Light of the Six Harmonies in an attempt to dodge.

“Thud!”

But how could a treasure from Mount Changhuai be so easily dodged? The white jade fan rode the Great Void, rising and falling with uncanny strangeness. He could only silently endure the blow. In an instant, his face turned ashen, stinging with a burning pain. Even though the Light of the Six Harmonies had dissipated most of the force, it still made it difficult for him to open his eyes, and his spiritual sense blurred.

Qing Jifang's expression was calm. He was about to make his move when he seemed to sense something and abruptly dropped down. This allowed Li Ximing to leap into the air and retreat several steps. While using a divine ability to dispel the grayness on his face, he also reached back and grabbed the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!

Having missed his chance, the Daoist Master frowned and looked down at his feet. It turned out that a ghastly white fire was already climbing up his clothes!

The mountains summoned by his dharma power seemed endless, crashing into the fire one after another. An ordinary flame might have been blocked, but the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire was no ordinary flame. Instead, it burned ever more fiercely, showing signs of rolling back up towards him!

‘The fire is an excellent fire! Even my Mount Changhuai rarely sees its like. What a waste for him to be using it!’
