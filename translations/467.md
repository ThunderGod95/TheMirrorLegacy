# Chapter 680: Entering The North

Northern Mount Yue.

The sky was shrouded in mist, but Li Xijun stood bathed in a snowy glow with his eyes shimmered with white light and a sword at his waist. He looked down to see the Dili family's troops enter the city below. A cloud of snow emerged beneath Li Xijun’s feet as he activated Snow On Pine, carrying him in an ethereal drift.

"Minghuang is intelligent. He has already taken on a Mount Yue title. Let’s test the ruler of Northern Mount Yue first."

Of course Li Xijun had made similar arrangements, but he chose to test the boy first. Now that he saw that everything had been properly arranged, he nodded and felt much more at ease.

Li Ximing watched in a trance. He had a mix of envy and satisfaction in his expression, his gaze lost in thought. He took out a jade bottle from his robe and said, "He has reached the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. If he takes this pill, he’ll reach the sixth... I also have Bright Spirit Powder for him. If he takes it with the pill, the Qi Cultivation Realm will be within his reach."

Li Xijun nodded, placing the items in his robe. As he looked up, he saw two forces leaving the city under the cover of night. "I’ve heard that the ruler of Northern Mount Yue is no mediocre leader. He’ll serve as Minghuang’s whetstone."

Li Ximing nodded, then suddenly asked, "Xijun, have you studied the Radiant Essence Scripture carefully?"

Li Xijun shook his head and replied, "I do not cultivate this Dao. I've only skimmed it for reference. Why do you ask?"

Li Ximing fell silent, gathering his words before speaking softly, "I have studied the nine secret techniques for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm. They are all extremely difficult. Mastering three grants a fifteen percent success rate. Mastering all nine still offers less than a fifty percent chance, and that’s without factoring in one's personal conditions."

The Li Family naturally lacked an optimal environment for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Li Xijun did some calculations in his head and murmured, "If one truly masters all nine secret techniques, then the chances of success would be quite high."

"It’s nowhere near that simple!" Li Ximing smiled wryly as he replied. "Each secret technique is extremely difficult. You’ll need decades to master even one!"

"It’s that hard?" replied Li Xijun. But then, his expression changed as though he understood something.

He thought to himself, No wonder Ning Wan and the others have been stuck in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm for so long... She may not even have all nine techniques to practice!

Li Ximing paused before saying, "However, the scripture also records several spirit items that can aid in breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm... Such as the Radiant Celestial Stone, Qilin Crow Spirit Husk, and White Blood Sap."

Li Ximing listed several spirit items, each a rare and precious treasure. He then continued saying, "All of the spirit items are at the Purple Mansion Realm..."

Li Xijun nodded slightly and replied, "Give me a list of the items. I’ll have Xizhi investigate and make inquiries in various places. Finding a lead would be ideal."

Meanwhile, in Chan Pass.

"Two passes and six towns." Li Zhouwei took out a map and examined it carefully. A vast plain dotted with numerous strongholds and a major town lay behind Chan Pass. Further beyond the plain was Moonlight Valley, another crucial pass which guarded the remaining five towns and the royal court.

In the past, their ancestor, Li Xiangping, had been able to move freely in this region. However, that was primarily because of two factors. First, he had a small and inconspicuous force. Secondly, a great drought had struck at the time and the lands of Mount Yue had just been ravaged by Jianixi. The region had been in complete ruin.

Now, with thousands of troops under Li Zhouwei’s command and with control over Chan Pass, where Xiangping had once been cornered in the north, their fate was bound to be different.

Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment and thought to himself, Better to press the attack in one swift strike.

Li Zhouwei descended from the pass and swiftly mounted his horse. He ordered the Mount Yue general, Du Dou, to gather the troops and slaves. Standing atop the platform, he held his halberd up as his armor gleamed with a cold light.

Some of the soldiers of the Mount Yue forces wore armor, while the slaves were mostly bare-chested. It was evident that Du Dou had at least somewhat trained them, preventing complete disorder; however, they were still far from disciplined.

The warriors of Mount Yue looked around in confusion, as if it made no difference to them who their commander was. Only the eyes of a few revealed greed as they stared at the weapons piled atop the platform.

Li Zhouwei’s gaze swept across the filthy and wretched faces of the Mount Yue soldiers. A strange red glow began to emanate from his halberd, as if it could captivate souls. The Mount Yue warriors instinctively raised their heads toward him.

Those stationed to guard the pass were not of noble birth; in fact, most were slaves. They lifted their heads weakly, watching batches of provisions being brought onto the platform as they whispered among themselves.

"Gentlemen." Li Zhouwei’s voice echoed within the pass. It was deep and low as it hung in the air. It carried an almost bewitching quality. "I am the Grand Concord of Radiance, commanded by the Mandate of Heaven to conquer the Northern Court. It is my intention to first slaughter the esteemed families and distribute the farmland in towns taken by our forces. When we conquer the Northern Court, all slaves shall be freed from their servitude."

"Distribute farmland?"

"Freedom from slavery? Does this general truly mean it...?"

Li Zhouwei paused, then repeated himself. His voice became more ethereal and carried a mesmerizing force. The doubt and suspicion in the Mount Yue warriors’ eyes gradually faded away and was replaced by a surging, fervent greed.

A touch of red began to glimmer deep in their eyes. They exchanged glances and stepped forward one by one to pick up the weapons before them. They were as fervent as a pack of starving wolves.

Chen Yang stood to the side and stared blankly. The voice had sunk into his brain without resistance. Even as a cultivator at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, he felt a momentary surge of excitement.

However, Chen Yang had a resolute mind. He quickly regained his senses and looked up at Li Zhouwei’s glowing, ghostly eyes before hastily lowering his head.

His heart quivered as he thought, So this is what Jianixi was like back then!

Dili Youjie stepped forward to report; he had already organized the troops and assigned personnel. Li Zhouwei’s spirit horse moved swiftly, leading the orderly tide of soldiers as they surged toward the towns hidden in the night.

The large town only had few guards to begin with. Before they could even react, several arrows shot through the air, felling them instantly. A few shamans swiftly scaled the walls and the gates swung open with a thunderous crash.

Li Zhouwei rode into the town atop his horse, the golden glow in his eyes flickering faintly. He could feel the soldiers following him in a trance-like state, as if a deep-seated instinct was gradually awakening within them.

He quickly reined in his horse and looked toward the stone tower at the village entrance. His silent yet frenzied troops poured into the town like waves splitting against rocks. They swept through the settlement in eerie silence.

A cacophony of voices rose around Li Zhouwei as he stared at the stone tower, a strange thought suddenly surfacing in his mind, I should be seated in a temple, presiding over an ancestral shrine...

He stood still as whispers spread like a Buddhist chant among the Mount Yue warriors. They all murmured. "In conquered towns, slaughter the esteemed families first, then distribute the farmland. When the Northern Court is conquered, all slaves shall be freed."

The Mount Yue warriors repeated the chant under their breath as they ran through the town. Small fires ignited across the settlements as they fought in the darkness. The cries of battle grew louder and louder, until they merged into a singular voice. "Grand Concord of Radiance!"

The chant made the Mount Yue warriors flush with battle fervor. Behind Li Zhouwei, Kongheng clutched a string of plain wooden prayer beads. He twisted them so tightly that they creaked. He was unable to conceal the shock on his face as he murmured, "A name destined for victory... Grand Concord of Radiance..."

A wisp of gray smoke gathered beside Kongheng, and the haunting voice of Li Wushao rang out. "Master Monk... what are you thinking?"

Kongheng merely shook his head with a bitter smile and replied, "Wushao, you are overly cautious..."

As the two Foundation Establishment cultivators conversed in hushed tones, Li Zhouwei spurred his horse forward and swiftly passed through the crowd. After securing control of the town, he rode toward the surrounding villages, bolstering his forces by another two or three hundred men. They marched quickly, leaving only a trail of blood behind them.

Li Zhouwei sent Chen Yang and Dili Youjie to lead separate units to conscript more troops while he galloped forward without hesitation. He no longer lingered in these villages and swiftly advanced toward the next pass.

But before Li Zhouwei arrived, a gust of gray wind swept past and deposited two jade bottles in his hands. One was green and the other white, but both bottles were exquisitely crafted.

Li Zhouwei inspected the contents using his divine sense before swiftly stowing them away. The valley before him was narrow, with troops stationed on both mountains. The pass was wedged between two gorges and appeared somewhat dilapidated.

His troops were lined up neatly as they paused for a brief moment at the valley’s entrance. Li Zhouwei looked to the side and addressed a Mount Yue soldier beside him, "Is this Moonlight Valley?"

The soldier nodded, bowed, and respectfully replied, "My lord, this place once belonged to the Moonlight Family, named after the rumored priest Yue Zhu[1]. During the great drought, the priest was slaughtered by the Easterners, yet it remains known as Moonlight Valley."

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes slightly, thinking to himself, So, it was here, slaughtered by my ancestor.

Raising his halberd, he gazed at the narrow valley ahead and murmured, "Take this pass, then I’ll find an opportunity to break through."

1. Yue Zhu (月珠) means Moon Pearl in Chinese ☜

Northern Mount Yue Royal Court.

Flames flickered quietly in stone basins within the palace. A thin man with unkempt hair sat on the throne of Northern Mount Yue, gently tracing the inscriptions on a stone tablet in his hands.

The King of Northern Mount Yue, Xian Du, did not appear particularly imposing. His name was also a common one among the people of Mount Yue. Yet, if he had maintained his grip on the throne amidst a sea of esteemed families, his methods were undoubtedly extraordinary. Yet, he merely sat in silence and examined the stone tablet in his hands.

The tablet depicted a grand and turbulent scene. It showed a figure adorned in feathers and beast bones standing upon a sacrificial altar. Above the altar, storm clouds churned and a demon loomed in the sky.

Beside him, a high priest clad in beast bones and feathers knelt on the ground. Xian Du stared blankly at the image for a long time before asking, "Still no word from Mount Wu?"

"My king, we have tried eight times, but there has been no response. There is no sign of communication whatsoever." The high priest shook his head silently. He showed little fear. If anything, there was actually a trace of relief as he replied, "My king, perhaps this is for the best... Once the children pass the shaman transition, they will no longer need to ascend the mountain. Year after year, has a single one who went up the mountain ever returned? They have likely all been taken by the masters."

"Now that Mount Wu is silent, perhaps Master Jiao Zhongzi and Master Mu Moli have gone to the Eastern Sea. Does this not make things easier for us?"

Xian Du’s gaunt face was filled with unease. He shook his head heavily and gently placed the stone tablet down. He said quietly, "You fail to see the real threat. If Master Jiao Zhongzi has encountered trouble, then the dog of Eastern Mount Yue’s Li Family, Li Jiman, is watching us closely. The Great Jueting is but a hundred and sixty kilometers from Chan Pass. Two passes and six cities are nothing before a Foundation Establishment cultivator. They can be erased with a flick of a finger."

The high priest nodded submissively, though he thought to himself, If Mount Wu has truly fallen... how many of us could possibly escape? It would be better to surrender to Li Jiman, at least we’d have a chance to survive...

Xian Du was still deep in thought when a Mount Yue warrior rushed into the hall, shouting, "My king! There’s trouble at Chan Pass!"

Jiao Zhongzi really has run into trouble!

Xian Du sprang from his seat as if he had been struck by lightning, gritting his teeth as he asked, "Is it Li Jiman himself? Or a force from the Li Family?"

The warrior hesitated for a moment before replying, "My king! The Li Family has stationed troops at Great Jueting. The surrounding tribes, finding no way to survive, then deceived their way into Chan Pass... The garrison commander, Du Dou, was captured and defected to their side. Now, their forces are advancing northward and have breached the pass!"

"So it’s a rebellion!" Xian Du let out a small breath of relief as he asked, "Which tribe is leading this? Who is their chief? How many troops and cultivators do they have?!"

The Mount Yue warrior bowed and reported, "The rebel king calls himself the Grand Concord of Radiance... Perhaps he belongs to the Grand Concord Tribe, but we do not know their exact numbers. Rumor has it that the Dili Tribe outside the pass is secretly supporting them."

"Grand Concord Tribe? Never heard of it! What nonsense is this?" said Xian Du.

As the ruler of Northern Mount Yue, Xian Du knew every major tribe in the region. He knew their strength, their numbers, and their lineage. He even remembered the names of many of the mid-sized and minor tribes. However, there was no record of a Grand Concord Tribe at all in his memories.

Xian Du immediately furrowed his brows. He wasn’t concerned about a force of a few thousand men. But it would be another matter entirely if the Dili Tribe, which was likely under the control of the Li Family, had received Li Jiman’s silent approval.

That wretch is scheming against me day after day! thought Xian Du.

Neither Xian Du nor Li Jiman were mere figureheads. Northern Mount Yue and Eastern Mount Yue had long been wrestling for power in the shadows. But as vassals, neither dared to openly start a war without explicit orders.

A significant weight had vanished from his heart once Xian Du realized that this was merely a rebellion. At the very least, it meant that nothing had gone wrong with Mount Wu. Otherwise, the invading force would have been the Li Family itself.

Reassured, he simply said, "What’s there to panic about? At most, he has three or four thousand troops and a handful of shamans. What threat could they pose?"

But the Mount Yue warrior before him was drenched in sweat and his voice dropped to a hushed whisper. "The so-called Grand Concord of Radiance claims to have Mount Wu’s command... He is spreading rumors that Your Majesty has lost contact with Mount Wu... Please, my king... please..."

A frisson of alarm ran through Xian Du. It was true that Mount Wu had not sent anyone down in a long time. When he saw the warrior’s hesitant demeanor, he immediately grasped the implication but chose to remain silent.

Mount Wu has been silent for too long... The esteemed families of the realm are growing restless. They are using this as an excuse to probe Mount Wu’s status! thought Xian Du.

Xian Du quickly recognized this as a veiled message from the esteemed families, but he forced himself to remain calm and replied in a deep voice, "It is but a mere insignificant rebellion. Why should we disturb Mount Wu over this? Do you think you or I could bear the consequences if they take offense? I shall quell the uprising myself!"

"I have misspoken, my king!" The Mount Yue warrior, cowed by Xian Du’s reprimand, broke out in a fresh sweat as he repeatedly kowtowed. He then responded, "It’s just that... it is said that this man resembles Jianixi. My king, you must be cautious!"

"I am well aware!" Xian Du already knew his enemy was no ordinary opponent once h heard that they had easily deceived their way into Chan Pass,. Turning to his map, he decided to abandon the towns beyond the pass. His gaze was fixed on Moonlight Valley as he murmured, "Mobilize the troops immediately. I shall personally lead the campaign. March to Moonlight Valley and trap him outside our heartland."

He kicked the warrior aside as he strode forward. The Mount Yue warrior scrambled back to his feet in terror. Xian Du was at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and had long suppressed his breakthrough. He was particularly formidable among those of a similar level. That single kick left the warrior winded and trembling.

Donning his armor and grasping his spear, Xian Du swiftly departed from the royal court. His mind raced as he issued his orders in a steady voice, "Order Xian Zhunfu to lead five thousand troops down the eastern path along the lake. Check if we can enter the valley from its side. I shall personally lead seven thousand of my elite forces to Moonlight Valley. If we hold the pass, this threat will be of no consequence!"
