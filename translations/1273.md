# Chapter 1273: Provisions

"Much obliged!"

Li Jiangqian, not nearly as proper as Li Que'wan, merely smiled and nodded at the old man’s words, and then strode forward like a shooting star, crossing the barrier with the elder to enter the Jia clan’s great formation; after passing a profound staircase engulfed in blazing flames, he saw a pavilion.

While great clans stored their treasures in palaces, halls, towers, or pavilions—with pavilions being quite rare—Li Que'wan, who followed slowly behind, smiled at the sight and said:

"A Blazing Fire?"

Jia Zan was slightly surprised and nodded.

"Fairy Suyun is truly sharp and perceptive. Indeed."

A crimson light rippled over the octagonal pavilion. In the very center stood a table, seemingly made of wood, and upon it, a flame indeed danced!

This fire was no more than three fingers wide and one finger long. Its flowery flames bloomed like specks of starlight, each blossom resembling a magnolia, blooming quietly on the tabletop. Yet, just drawing a little closer brought a surging sense of danger.

Li Que'wan said softly:

"A Blazing Fire is a fire of vigorous release. It cannot be sealed, nor can it be left static, for it will exhaust itself if stored for too long. It must be nurtured with wood qi. A pavilion, open to the wind on all four sides, and a wooden platform, providing ceaseless nourishment year after year—your clan has certainly been thorough."

Jia Zan had intended to offer some flattery, but once she spoke, the surprise on his face became genuine. He could not help but say,

"Impressive."

"This fire was passed down by an ancestor and is called Profound Rhombus Flowing Flame. It is a fire of transformation, capable of breaking formations, destroying the body, and searing metal and stone."

Thanks to Li Ximing, Li Jiangqian had seen quite a few flames. Now, as this strand of Blazing Fire entered his sight, it immediately made him nod slightly:

‘At a glance, its power is slightly inferior to my Southern Brightness Heart-Fire, but it can be considered high-grade.’

After all, with his divine ability newly formed, Li Jiangqian's Southern Brightness Heart-Fire was the strongest flame in the Li clan besides the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire; it was a leader among spiritual flames and not easily surpassed.

Jia Zan, however, only paused for a moment before saying seriously:

"Your Highness, this fire has a unique characteristic... as a Blazing Fire, it can transform spiritual impetus. Once activated, its range is wider than ordinary spiritual flames. If one is besieged, it is quite effective at breaking the encirclement!"

Li Jiangqian nodded, listening as the old man said:

"Furthermore, this fire was born in the Great Void. Once it returns to the Great Void, it becomes elusive and as swift as lightning, beyond the reach of ordinary people."

"Back when the Thunder Palace fell, my ancestor perished suddenly. Many of his belongings were plundered by those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and lost. Only this fire escaped into the Great Void, leaving all the cultivators behind as it roamed the world. At that time, the Great Void was fractured, making divine abilities difficult to use. Yet after more than six years, it unexpectedly wandered back to Luoxia on its own and returned to the clan."

He sighed faintly and continued,

"It was only then that the clan knew for certain that the elder had truly fallen."

Li Jiangqian seemed lost in thought, then suddenly said,

"At that time, were all the great clans of the world serving the Thunder Palace?"

Jia Zan smiled and said:

"Of course! The True Qi was in the hands of the Thunder Palace. The entire world was its subject; how could they not serve?"

Li Jiangqian narrowed his eyes and said with a smile,

"I wonder which True Monarch that was?"

Jia Zan answered without hesitation,

"This one should be called a Divine Monarch. He came from the True Dao Sect and was named Divine Monarch of Vast Illumination, True Qi, and Profound Grandeur. He was also a member of the Thunder Palace and fell when it collapsed."

He chuckled and said:

"True Qi... though the Upper Rite is good, its abilities are unclear. It can't compare to True Qi, which is easy to learn but difficult to master. All the dynasties favored True Qi. The Thunder Palace set an example. Later came the Zhou, who had the True Rite Platform; the Liang, who had the White Swan Palace; and Emperor Zhaowu of Zhao also tried to establish a Tianwu Hall, but it was seized before it could be used. Only the Wei Emperor didn't bother—he really had no need."

Li Jiangqian stood with his hands behind his back and put the item away for the time being. Jia Zan continued to lead him forward. They crossed a broken bridge and finally saw a treasured hall blazing with crimson fire. Pushing the door open, they entered to see three crimson jade slips already placed on the jade platform at the head of the hall.

He hadn't shown much heartache over the earlier Profound Rhombus Flowing Flame, but now, seeing the Dao lineage of his ancestor, he was genuinely dejected. The whiskers by his lips trembled as he said,

"Your Highnesses, this is a secret method passed down by my clan's ancestor, Daoist Master Qingwei of the Guanhua Daoist tradition, called the Bright Xiezhi Escape Method... It was originally an ancient spell art, quite different from those of today. After several improvements by our predecessors, it has gradually come to align with modern methods."

Although he felt the sting of loss, his actions were decisive. He formed a seal in his palm, released the first two jade slips, and delivered them one after the other into the young man's hands.

Li Jiangqian first took the version simplified by a descendant to read, but his brow furrowed and he let it go. He immediately turned to read the ancient version, and only then did a look of appreciation appear. After reading through it, his hand holding the jade slip suddenly tightened.

The so-called 'Bright Xiezhi Escape Method' was true to its name—it was an art for protecting oneself and one's Dao. It was mostly used in combat, allowing one to transform flames for self-defense. Upon mastery, one could nurture a spiritual flame within the body, which could take on ten thousand forms.

What surprised Li Jiangqian the most was that this art, just like the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method, was a orthodox nature art for sensing one's life-mandate!

‘And my Great Parting Scripture is also an art for nurturing fire in the heart and lungs, which vaguely corresponds with this. This Jia clan ancestor was likely a cultivator of a similar Dao lineage!’

Since he already possessed the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, Li Jiangqian didn't have high hopes for external spell arts. Yet the surprise this item gave him was simply too great. Even if placed in the Grotto-Heaven Pavilion, this type of special ancient escape method, which was also a life-mandate sensing art, would surely be outrageously expensive!

This made the corners of his mouth curve up slightly, and he turned his head to ask:

"I wonder... which Dao did this Senior Qingwei cultivate?"

Jia Zan looked up and said:

"My ancestor cultivated the Li Fire. He attempted to test the Supreme Yang with the body of the Great Li Narrating the Sun, but in the end, his Dao-profundity was just short, and he failed at the final step. When he attempted his breakthrough, True Monarch Guanhua was also present to watch over him."

The Jia clan naturally had a deep foundation to have survived to this day, but it was obvious that in all the generations since, no one had come closer to the golden position than Qingwei.

What Li Jiangqian coveted most were the cultivation method and the method for the Quest for Gold, but it was needless to even think about it; those things were surely no longer in the Jia family's possession. He could only turn his hopeful gaze to the last jade slip.

Jia Zan quickly took it down and said in a low voice.

"This is a qi-ingestion method."

It was an ancient immortal method!

The greatest difference between these Luoxia clans and others was that they had ancestors who once cultivated the ancient Immortal Dao on the mountain. Li Jiangqian had long suspected this.

‘They would never rashly select people to go up the mountain. Instead, they would place a copy of a qi-ingestion method in these clans, allowing every disciple to try reading it. Only when someone with exceptional talent appeared would they be sent up the mountain.’

Even though most of these so-called exceptionally talented individuals who went up the mountain would end up with the so-called 'ten years of no progress, leave the mountain and enter the world', Li Jiangqian was certain the clan must have such an item. He took it without ceremony, and as he held it in his palm, a sea of complex scripture appeared before his eyes.

'Shaoming Ingestion Method'.

Li Jiangqian had carefully studied the Southern Li Ingestion Method from Wanling Heaven, observing and learning much from it. Now, upon reading this one, he was immediately filled with awe and shock.

‘It's completely different!’

The Southern Li Ingestion Method was a practice of qi-ingestion that looked up to the Dao of Li-Light. It was said to be a golden scripture with profound script, requiring one to achieve communion and unity with heaven and earth to seek the divine and miraculous. But the Shaoming Ingestion Method, while also claiming to be a qi-ingestion practice, stated that of the ten thousand paths of the Immortal Dao, one's own path is unique. By using this ultimate book of Dao, one could attain inner wholeness, and thus, the divine and miraculous would arise spontaneously!

The world often said that qi-ingestion methods were the ancient Immortal Dao. Li Jiangqian had thought they might be different, but he never expected the doctrinal arguments between them to be so vastly divergent. If not entirely separate paths, the difference at least far surpassed that between different Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao methods!

‘No matter how different the cultivation methods of the Purple Gold Dao are from one another, they are still based on Embryonic Breathing and Qi Refining, aiming to fully cultivate the five divine abilities... How could their core doctrines be so fundamentally different!’

This left him speechless for a long time. After a while, he came to his senses, only to find that Jia Zan was gone, having hurried to the entrance of the hall to greet someone. Li Que'wan also turned around, her face lighting up with joy.

At some unknown time, a person had appeared before the hall's entrance. He wore deep black robes, and his golden eyes held a smile. Behind him, Cui Jueyin stood to the side, extremely respectful—it was none other than his own father, Li Zhouwei!

Li Jiangqian quickly strode down and said joyfully,

"Greetings, Father!"

There was a hint of a smile in Li Zhouwei's eyes as he said,

"I thought you would be fast, but I didn't expect you to be this fast!"

The speed at which Li Jiangqian achieved the Concordant Conquest had exceeded his expectations. But given that the Bright Yang father and son were one, it was also within reason. Li Jiangqian simply bowed deeply and said with a smile,

"It is all thanks to Father's grace!"

"Enough."

Li Zhouwei chuckled and stepped forward. Jia Zan also came up respectfully and said ingratiatingly,

"Greetings, King Wei! This humble cultivator was just leading their Highnesses to collect spiritual items and did not greet you from afar. Please forgive me!"

When Cui Jueyin took control of this place, he had already seized control of the great formation and all rights of entry and exit. It was only natural that Li Zhouwei's arrival was silent, so he couldn't be blamed.

"You've been troubled, Daoist Master Jia."

After Li Zhouwei offered a word of comfort, Li Jiangqian said seriously,

"Father, please take a look!"

He presented the Shaoming Ingestion Method. Li Zhouwei only skimmed it for a moment before a strange look appeared on his face. He turned to Jia Zan.

"An ingestion method from the Guanhua Daoist tradition?"

"I wouldn't dare claim so!"

Jia Zan, thinking he had seen through something, quickly said,

"The Guanhua Dao inheritance is housed in Tongxuan Palace, and was later moved to Zhaoyao Mountain. We descendants wouldn't dare to touch it lightly, much less pass it on. This method was written by our ancestor to be left in the clan; it just has a trace of Comprehending Profoundity's air to it."

"A trace of Comprehending Profoundity's air."

Li Zhouwei glanced at him, a strange feeling growing in his heart.

‘Between the Three Profoundities, there are great differences in philosophy and cultivation, to the point that they are now quite distinct…’

After all, back then there was the saying, 'The two Lus once resided before the golden lock', but now there was no sign of the Three Profoundities being interconnected.

‘Communing and unifying with heaven and earth—ancient cultivators did have such a step. I've heard that ancient Purple Gold cultivators could use this to nurture divine abilities from their immortal foundation…’

This had a rather inexplicable quality to it.

‘If... the difference between the Comprehending Profoundity method and the Encompassing Profoundity method lies in this step of communing with heaven and earth, wouldn't the collapse of heaven and earth have cut off most of the Encompassing Profoundity methods, while the Comprehending Profoundity methods remained unrestrained?’

‘The Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition has all but vanished now, with only the Underworld remaining. Could this be related to that factor?’

Li Zhouwei's gaze shifted to meet Li Jiangqian's equally intense eyes. He set the matter aside for now, put away the Shaoming Ingestion Method, and asked

"Is the Mountain's Edge Hall cleaned out?"

Seeing Jia Zan hesitate, Li Zhouwei ordered.

"Qing Feng, go with Daoist Master Jia and pack everything up."

He turned to the side and said,

"Bring the things from Li Fire, Whole Pill, and Bright Yang here first."

Cui Jueyin bowed and hurried off. Only then did Li Zhouwei stand with his hands behind his back. Li Que'wan immediately said

"Reporting to Your Majesty, someone from the Lu clan had arrived."

Li Zhouwei's gaze darkened as he looked over. The scroll at his waist flickered, and Heavenly Light spread out to seal the great hall. Li Jiangqian then stepped forward and said with a smile,

"The man's name was Lu An, mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm. He found an excuse to come see us and caused a bit of a commotion. His divine abilities are profound, but his attacks were perfunctory. The Lu clan's attitude is good; they don't want to get involved in this mess."

"On the one hand, he helped us pin down the Jia clan's location, and seems to not want them to remain in Luoxia. Perhaps he still has some friendly feelings for the Jia clan."

Li Zhouwei said quietly, "How did Jia Zan react?"

Li Jiangqian said, "He didn't make a move either, just observed from the side. Perhaps he also understood."

Li Que'wan said softly, "This Daoist Master Lu gave me a start, but fortunately, I knew after one exchange that his divine abilities weren't serious; it was just a minor scuffle. After all, the person is still in our hands. We ignored him, and since the Lu clan is a great clan, he was in a difficult position. He knows Bright Yang is domineering and might not give them face, and coming to us obsequiously would damage their prestige. So he chose to question Jia Zan's crime and convey a message in passing, so as not to lose too much face."

Hearing this, the crimson-robed young man laughed and said:

"Being captured alive by Father isn't disgraceful, but coming to ransom someone is too damaging to one's dignity. They found an excuse in Lu Fu's disrespectful words. It was choosing the lesser of two evils."

"But..."

Li Que'wan said in a low voice,

"He recognized the Profound Bestowal Glazed Talisman. The other clans probably have their suspicions as well. He specifically asked if I was from the Dantai family. I don't know if he was reminding me of something or trying to find something out."

After listening to the two juniors, Li Zhouwei already had a plan in mind and said,

"The two Lus received teachings from Azure Profoundity. Perhaps they will show some consideration on his account. We just need to ask."

After speaking, his hand was already at his sleeve, and from within he retrieved the Heavenly Nurture Urn.

The urn no longer had its original wooden color, but now bloomed with patches of gold and white. Faint wisps of golden qi, like white mist, overflowed from its mouth. Even for Li Zhouwei, lifting the object felt heavy.

And on the rim of the urn lay a thumb-sized Daoist acolyte. Her face was filled with apprehension. Having witnessed the many divine abilities, she immediately jumped down, transformed to the size of a doll, and bowed.

"My lords... that... that Daoist is cooped up inside. He asked me more than a dozen times, saying to 'please' have me come out and plead for him to see King Wei."

Li Que'wan had a strange expression. Seeing this spirit creature, she understood.

‘A dignified Daoist Master of the Lu clan using the word "please" to a spirit creature... he must really be afraid.’

Even Lu An couldn't hold back and found an excuse to travel a thousand li to come here, let alone Lu Fu, who had been stuck in the urn for so long without any news! The Heavenly Nurture Urn was no benevolent item; it was draining his divine abilities with every passing moment!

Li Zhouwei tilted the profound urn, and a stream of gold and white light flowed out. It transformed within the hall, not flying away or circulating divine abilities, but solidly materializing into the form of a man.

As a direct descendant of the Lu family, Lu Fu had a handsome and gentle appearance and was dressed simply. But now he was injured and in a difficult situation, looking a bit disheveled. He glanced around, let out a breath, and said:

"Greetings, King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. Lu Fu, looking as if he had survived a calamity, lowered his eyes and said,

"I, Lu, was ignorant of your divine abilities and spoke arrogantly. Today, I have finally learned the intensity of Bright Yang. Thank you, King Wei, for your guidance..."

He had been defeated on the spot during his lecture, suppressed, and captured alive, yet he did not seem discouraged. His eyes were filled with the emotion of having survived a disaster. He bowed deeply, appearing calm and natural, which made Li Zhouwei smile,

"Daoist Friend Lu is quite magnanimous."

But Lu Fu said, "It cannot be summed up with a word like magnanimity. My elder brother once said that the affairs of the world are like raging waves; the boatman does not know when he will rise or fall. Even for my Lu clan, the number of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who have fallen to the grand tides of fate are too many to count on both hands. I, Lu, relied on grace and my family's standing to avoid this calamity. It was not my own skill, yet it was my disaster to avoid. At times like these, one should be vigilant and self-reflect. How could I act with a childish temper?"

His gaze was clear as he sighed softly and said with a smile:

"King Wei's divine abilities are enough to suppress a Great Daoist Master. To be captured alive by King Wei is no shame for me, Lu Fu. If the day comes when Bright Yang illuminates the world, it will instead be my honor."

Li Zhouwei carefully observed his expression, then with a light flick of his finger, tossed the small cauldron back and said with a smile:

"Daoist Friend Lu, forgive this king for not seeing you off."

Lu Fu also said no more. He gave a deep bow, then transformed into a golden light and drifted away. Li Jiangqian remained standing, watching his departing back with some regret, while Li Que'wan praised,

"The Lu clan's reputation is well-deserved. Impressive."

This man appeared relaxed, but as a direct descendant of Gu Prefecture, Lu Fu had likely suffered fewer setbacks in his cultivation than the number of Purple Mansion Realm spiritual pills he had consumed. To have such magnanimity was no easy feat.

Li Jiangqian had an inscrutable expression. Before he could say more, he saw Jia Zan enter from outside the hall with a complex look on his face. He bowed and said,

"Greetings, Daoist Masters!"

He didn't say another word, but behind him, Cui Jueyin's eyes held a hint of excitement, and his face was slightly flushed as he said respectfully,

"Reporting to Your Majesty, the many spiritual items in the Mountain's Edge Hall have been collected... Although this place was originally a Bright Yang official residence, it has been changed beyond recognition. Most of the Bright Yang items were sent away long ago."

He lifted his sleeve, revealing a jade talisman the color of Heavenly Light. It was only the size of a fingernail, and the script upon it was profound and as dense as ants. Cui Jueyin presented it with both hands and said seriously.

"Only this item, left behind by the Wei family ancestor who was stationed at the Mountain's Edge Hall at the time, was kept by the Wei clan as a memento!"

He personally delivered it into Li Zhouwei's hands. The King of Wei glanced at the front, then twisted it between two fingers to turn it over, revealing a bright seal script that had already refined itself!

'Mountain's Edge Talisman'.

This item was also a Spiritual Artifact of no low quality. It had no combat functions, but its effect was extremely unique!

‘Once this talisman is triggered, it will immediately shine countless rays of Heavenly Light in the surrounding area, called 'Loyal Vassal's Profound Light', to cover an area and suppress all cultivators. Although it cannot be moved, its power is considerable!’

And its special feature was that it did not require control via divine ability, nor did it need to be infused with spiritual sense. A light touch with a divine ability was enough to activate it, which meant that the wielder did not need to distinguish between friend or foe, nor divert their attention.

‘Unfortunately, it has one flaw. This light clashes with the Crimson Severing Arrowhead. Once they collide, it will immediately dissipate and revert to its original form…’

It was the first time Li Zhouwei had encountered a Bright Yang item with such a decisive counter, but he didn't mind.

‘This is perfect to take back for grand-uncle. He doesn't have the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, and he's a bit limited in combat without many techniques. This feature of operating on its own without needing to divert attention will greatly save his mental energy!’

As he mused, Cui Jueyin saw that he had no questions and continued,

"As for items of the Whole Pill, they are simply too rare. This subordinate searched everywhere with Daoist Master Jia and in the end, only found one in a side hall."

He suppressed his emotions and turned his hand over, taking out a lead box.

A lead box was filled with mercury water, in which a thumb-sized vermilion fruit was soaking. It resembled a fruit, yet not quite, as if it were made of stone, and it emitted a red glow. Li Que'wan recognized it at a glance.

"The 'Sand-Transforming Cinnabar Stone', which excels at condensing spiritual impetus and amplifying effects!"

The Wei clan already had the Three Primal Mercury of the Whole Pill. To hope for more gains was truly difficult. Finding this spiritual resource was truly a surprise. She was a person easily satisfied, and holding it in her hands, she felt a sense of pleasant surprise.

‘If a Spiritual Artifact needs this, I can forge it. If not, I can use it to create a couple of secret talismans, which could be of great use at a critical moment.’

"As for the Li Fire..."

Cui Jueyin became excited. He stepped forward, bowed, and with a wave of his sleeve, a row of jade boxes was laid out.

The five boxes at the forefront opened on their own. First, a brilliant Li-Light flashed, and a wave of energy like fiery magma rushed forth. In the center box lay a single petal, like white jade.

"This is the Yin Sun Radiance Leaf, obtained from the Feather-Shedding Land. It dispels yin malevolence and removes evil light, a first-rate Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item! On either side are the corresponding Yin Divination Li Branches, which were obtained at the same time."

Indeed, the jade boxes on either side were slightly dimmer in color. Each held a pale white branch. Although their radiance could not compare to the flower petal in the center, they had just barely reached the level of a spiritual item!
Beside them was a golden pill, its halo as light as gauze and as vigorous as the rising sun, with dots of crimson patterns drawn on its surface.

"This item was left behind when an ancestor made a breakthrough in alchemy. It was made using the Heavenly Star Li Stone, the Surging Li Treasure Leaf, and many other spiritual items..."

Jia Zan sighed slightly, his expression much better than before—after all, it was the Wei family's things being given away. He pointed to the last item, a blood-red stone glittering with crimson light, and said,

"This one is the Vast Li Fragrant Blood, left behind when a Purple Mansion Realm demon beast fell. It contains extremely potent divine ability essence. I heard there were originally three portions, but after years of use... only this one could be found..."

Then, with a powerful wave of his sleeve, the rest of the jade boxes flew open. There were glittering Surging Li Treasure Leaves, fiery White Wild Apricot Fruits, and the interweaving glows of various Li Fires, some bright, some malevolent. For a moment, Li Fire surged forth, and crimson light flickered!

The spiritual impetus throughout the great hall boiled ceaselessly. The Li Fire qi, so dense it had reached its peak, seemed as if it would burst out of the hall, startling the several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators present.

Li Jiangqian stood frozen on the spot, shock and joy intertwined in his eyes. He could not help but swallow.

Four Li Fire spiritual items, one Li Fire treasured pill, and thirteen Li Fire spiritual resources!

No wonder Cui Jueyin was so excited, even finding it somewhat incredible.

Among them were even three items of extremely high quality and grade. That Yin Sun Radiance Leaf was no worse than the Parting Si Apricot Fruit that Ji An had used to break through to the Purple Mystery realm!

What did that mean?

The Li Fire items alone would be enough for the Li clan to build two more entire Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil Great Formations!

‘Such a huge amount of spiritual resources... even if I were to turn the entire Southern Borderlands upside down and scour it, the Li Fire spiritual items I'd find might not compare to what's in this hall! Even the so-called Lingyu legacy—any benefits it might hold for me, Li Jiangqian, would surely fall far short of this!’

No wonder Li Jiangqian's expression changed as well. Even though the young man had made an estimate in his heart long ago, at this moment, he finally had a true concept of the so-called wealth of the Central Plains.

‘The world's resources are mostly in the mainland, and the mainland's resources are mostly in the Central Plains…’

He said, his voice a little hoarse,

"To think the Wei clan's foundation is so profound. How many other spiritual items are there!"

Jia Zan quickly bowed and sighed,

"Your Highness misunderstands. The Wei clan once had a Great Daoist Master of Li Fire who fell after his breakthrough. His Dharma robes and Spiritual Treasures were taken back by the mountain. They used spiritual resources as compensation and sent his other belongings over as well—and more than half of this has already been used, otherwise there would be even more!"

‘More?!’

Li Jiangqian was both enlightened and shocked. He scanned the Li Fire items in the hall with envious eyes, his throat moving slightly as he could not help but look at Li Zhouwei.

Li Zhouwei was already seated in the main seat, carefully reading the jade slip in his hands. Seeing Li Jiangqian look over with raised eyebrows, a mix of shock and doubt on his face, a trace of amusement flashed in the King of Wei's eyes. He stood up and said with a smile.

"Jiangqian, take it all."

Li Jiangqian shot to his feet, took a step forward, then turned his head back. He opened his mouth but couldn't speak, only meeting his sister's secretly smiling eyes. His father had already strode down, walking past him and leaving a faint voice behind:

"Even if you have to smash your way through with spiritual items, you will first smash your way to the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm for me."
