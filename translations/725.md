# Chapter 725: Transforming into a Mountain

Li Ximing returned through the Great Void, materializing on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. He listened to Li Wen's report and inquired about the Profound Peak Gate.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, there have been tremors in Shanji Prefecture since midnight, and the sky has been overcast. The Profound Peak Gate announced to the public that the Daoist Master was moving a mountain."

The phenomena caused by Earth Virtue cultivators were tied to the earth's meridians, so nothing could be gleaned from the sky. With the Profound Peak Gate's Purple Mansion formation active, Changxi's explanation was plausible—it did seem as if a new mountain had simply appeared. From the Great Void, however, the truth was clear: someone had failed their breakthrough.

Li Ximing asked, "Where is Minghuang, and who is managing the clan's affairs?"

Li Wen replied, "To the Daoist Master, the clan head has gone to the Baijiang Creek. The eldest young master is currently in charge."

Hearing that Li Jiangqian was in charge, Li Ximing continued, "As I emerged from the Great Void, I saw a great deal of activity on the lake. What's happening?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master," Li Wen answered, "the eldest young master has relocated the declining clans from the island to the lakeside, settling them beneath the six gatehouses. He has also moved direct descendants at the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment realms onto the island."

Li Ximing nodded. He inquired about Li Zhouwei's sons: the eldest, Li Jiangqian, was managing the clan; the second, Li Jianglong, had gone to the Profound Peak Gate; the third, Li Jiangxia, was handling affairs on the eastern shore; and the fourth, Jiangliang, had just left home to focus on his cultivation.

"And the youngest son? Is he like his brothers?"

Li Ximing had heard nothing of the fifth son, Li Jiangnian, so he asked. Li Wen responded in a muffled tone, "The youngest master is growing older. His eyes have lost their color, and he lacks the heroic bearing of his brothers."

Li Ximing had never met the fifth son, but for Li Wen to say such a thing implied a problem far more significant than simply being "lacking." He understood and dismissed the man.

He had only been seated for half an hour when Changxi's divine power indeed appeared in the Great Void. Though the Li clan lacked a Purple Mansion formation that would necessitate a formal entry, Changxi still halted his approach as a courtesy and announced himself before entering.

The old Daoist Master had the appearance of a middle-aged man. A jade pendant hung on his chest, and his face was ruddy, his voice resonant. Yet even Li Ximing, who was unskilled in divination and physiognomy, could see that his divine ability was leaking uncontrollably, agitating the earth meridians. The man was on the verge of death.

No one dared to provoke him in this state. Li Ximing spoke gently, "Senior, you've arrived! I heard the earth meridians in the Profound Peak Gate's territory were unstable. Has something happened?"

Changxi sat opposite him, his expression placid. "Fu En has fallen," he replied. "My territory has merely gained a new mountain."

His detached manner left Li Ximing at a loss for words. After a moment, Daoist Master Changxi spoke again. "Zhaojing, I am about to pass on and transform into a mountain. Have you given any thought as to where this mountain should rest?"

Li Ximing immediately understood that Changxi's condition was far worse than he had imagined. Perhaps it was the shock of failure, or perhaps the effects of *Inward Heart Surging Profundity* were reaching their peak. With less than two years to his tribulation, the old man could no longer hold on.

'Thank heavens I wasn't wandering outside, heading for the World's Navel... If he had died suddenly, things would have become very complicated.'

He let out a breath and began to consider Changxi's final arrangements.

'According to him, he'll become a mountain after he dies. A Purple Mansion cultivator's final transformation... that mountain will likely be extraordinary. A treasured land.'

Li Ximing had little interest in holding onto Shanji Prefecture; he wasn't even confident he could protect the Profound Peak Gate's main sect. It would be best if Changxi passed on right here by the lake. His clan would gain a Geng Mountain.

'But I can't just say... "Senior, could I trouble you to die on my land?"'

It was an awkward thing to ask. Since Changxi had brought it up, he must have a plan. Li Ximing could only say, "Senior, do you have arrangements? We will follow your wishes."

Changxi glanced at him and nodded. "Even if you don't say it, Zhaojing, I understand. Shanji can't be held, and my own sect's gates may not be defensible. I won't simply hand a prize to the enemy. The Xuanmiao Temple also follows the path of Earth Virtue. Daoist Friend Sumian has invited me there to discuss the Dao at Baihai Creek. I sense my time is near, so I came to invite you to accompany me."

With that, Changxi produced a jade box from his sleeve. Nestled inside was a perfectly round white pearl, emanating fine, colorful rays of light. A carving of a tiger looking over its shoulder adorned its surface, illuminating the room. "Zhaojing, take it," Changxi said.

The mid-grade Still Earth Dharma Treasure, the *Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger*! After being offered and refused, it had finally landed in Li Ximing's hands.

Li Ximing no longer refused. He reached out and took the box. The white pearl was cold to the touch with the chill of Baleful Earth Qi, and the carved lines of the tiger were so distinct they were almost sharp. As Changxi voluntarily withdrew his divine power, ceding control of the Dharma Treasure, Li Ximing's own Bright Yang ability began to infuse it.

The *Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger* was a Dharma Treasure, even more powerful than the *Chongming Profound Insight Screen* the Li clan had once refined. If not for Changxi willingly transferring it, the refinement process alone would have taken an unknown amount of time. As soon as he held it, its abilities naturally unfolded in his mind.

First, it possessed the protective power of Still Earth. This was an excellent defensive ability that could not only release a *Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen* to envelop the user's body, but also passively grant Li Ximing a *Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption*, reducing the damage he took from all divine abilities except those of the Twelve Qi and Fire Virtue.

Second, the *Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger* had a marvelous earth-burrowing ability called *Sea-Crossing Profound Evasion*. It allowed the user to travel through the earth's meridians like an Earth Virtue cultivator, moving at an incredible speed.

Finally, there was the *Geng Tiger Dao*, which could transform the Dharma Treasure itself into a Geng Tiger to traverse the Great Void. While it had little combat prowess in this form, it possessed a remarkable stealth capability. Unless trapped by a formation in the Great Void, the Geng Tiger would dive deep into the void at the slightest touch of a Purple Mansion divine ability, making it extremely difficult to intercept.

Beyond these, there were numerous minor Earth Virtue abilities. The Dharma Treasure itself was a Purple Mansion-level symbol of Still Earth. If Li Ximing's own cultivation deepened, he could even use it to cast spells freely. It was just as when Sumian had borrowed the power of Li Ximing and Changxi to heal Ding Weizeng; if Changxi hadn't been present, placing the *Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger* nearby would have achieved the same effect.

'A fine Dharma Treasure... Changxi may not have had a great reputation in his life, but he certainly had some impressive items tucked away. This treasure is truly useful.'

Despite the growing pressure, Li Ximing was quite pleased with the *Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger*.

He sent someone to inform Li Zhouwei, then rose to leave with Changxi. As they entered the Great Void, the old man said, "Zhaojing, although the *Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger* is more compatible with my and Sumian's abilities, it doesn't offer anything truly exceptional for us—its functions overlap with our own. After discussing it, we agreed it would be better for you to have it."

"In any upcoming direct confrontations with Purple Mansion cultivators, we'll be relying on your *Audience with the Celestial Gate*."

That was his stated reason, but Li Ximing knew it wasn't just about their abilities. While *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was indeed a combat-oriented art, the real issue was that his own position was now fundamentally opposed to Yehui's. "Zhaojing understands," he replied.

Changxi continued, "The *Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger* also shares a common trait of Earth Dharma Treasures—it's essentially a demonic path item. Besides nourishing it with divine power, you can also refine it with blood qi and resentful energy for even greater benefit. Over time, it might undergo even more wondrous transformations."

This gave Li Ximing pause, and a suspicion immediately formed in his mind. The Dharma Treasure was mid-grade; perhaps Changxi had been the one to advance it. But Changxi quickly preempted his thoughts: "I considered refining it that way in the past, but the item is too much of a chicken rib for me. Besides, the amount of material needed is vast. Such resources are scarce within the seas, and I never managed to secure much. I used most of what I had to refine something else."

He pointed to the jade stone on his chest. Li Ximing had been noticing it for some time. "This is the *Qi Stone Demon Embryo*," Changxi said. "I started refining it two hundred years ago, spending most of my life's savings on it. If I weren't bound by the ambiance of *Inward Heart Surging Profundity*, with the waters of the Eastern Sea descending and thunder ascending, I wouldn't have ended up in this state."

Hearing the name, Li Ximing was inwardly shocked, but his expression remained thoughtful. Changxi chuckled. "This art is a secret of my lineage. It harms the heavens' harmony but can extend one's life. It's not good for one's reputation, and it has many drawbacks. Even the ancestors who used it did so in secret."

'Why is he telling me this?'

Li Ximing hesitated for a moment, but Changxi had already turned away. His voice grew deeper. "Actually... the various houses are very wary of the orthodox Earth Virtue path, especially cultivators who walk the demonic path. Other lineages can be ignored, but an Earth Virtue cultivator who is *also* an orthodox demonic cultivator inspires fear in everyone. Though the great houses benefited from the transformation of the Thunder Palaces, no one wants to see a repeat of that."

Li Ximing actually knew a little about this. Though he didn't know where Changxi was going with this, he seized the opportunity to ask, "I've read about the *Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace Dao*. After the Purple Mansion realm, the difference between it and the Purple Mansion Golden Core path is not that great... When you say orthodox demonic path... do you mean like Tuoba Chongyuan?"

"Something like that," Changxi said leisurely. "The *Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace Dao* and the Purple Mansion Golden Core are one and the same—both are the demonic paths of the current age. But there were demonic cultivators in ancient times as well, otherwise why would Kuaili have been a Demon Monarch? The Tuoba clan is also a branch of the orthodox demonic path."

The old man snorted. "Arts are not taught lightly, so orthodoxies are born. If this side has an orthodoxy, so does that one. Those who attain Fruition don't pass down their own techniques; they bestow lesser arts upon others. By the time it reaches people like us, we use Foundation Establishment texts to control those below us. Isn't it all from the same source? Just as commoners bow their heads to our direct lineages, we too must bow our heads to the orthodox lines. To be another's plaything—is that not the natural order of things?"

He seemed to recall the painful memory of his clan's "one-incense-stick" legacy. He took a couple of deep breaths. On the verge of death, he pushed himself to materialize on a dark mountain cliff. He and Li Ximing descended towards the Xuanmiao Temple. The person who came to greet them, however, was not Qiuxin, but a pale, beardless, middle-aged man: Kong Guxi.

Someone from the Profound Peak Gate had already arrived.

Kong Guxi craned his neck, looking as terrified as a plucked quail. His already large eyes were wide with fear, making his Daoist robes hang loosely from his frame, as if on a coat rack.

He drifted over, was impatiently shoved aside by Changxi, and stumbled into a clumsy kowtow before bursting into tears. Changxi ignored him and looked only at Sumian. The old abbot stood with his hands tucked in his sleeves, his face etched with anxiety.

Changxi asked, "Which courtyard? Have you made the arrangements, Daoist Friend?"

Sumian quickly led the way to the far end of the cliff. "Daoist Friend..." he began anxiously, "that thing..."

"Ah!" Changxi took the *Qi Stone Demon Embryo* from his neck and pressed it into Sumian's hand. "No third person knows of this item."

Li Ximing, who had been standing by with a downcast and respectful expression, felt his mind race.

'No third person knows? But you just told me!'

'What is Changxi doing? Is this leverage? A hint? The *Qi Stone Demon Embryo* is bad for one's reputation and has many drawbacks... Is he leaving me a way to force the Xuanmiao Temple's hand in the future?'

Li Ximing's composure held; his expression didn't flicker. Sumian silently accepted the item and replied, "I will do my utmost to protect the Profound Peak Gate."

They had now reached the courtyard. An area a hundred li across had been cleared out, clearly in long anticipation of Changxi's death. It was a barren patch of yellow earth, save for a few frail blades of grass sprouting from the ground, swaying in the spring breeze.

Stones had begun to fall from beneath Changxi's robes, clattering and kicking up dust. He hurried into the courtyard. His robes billowed, but there was no grace in the movement—he looked like a bird throwing itself into a net. He sat cross-legged on the cot.

The Xuanmiao Temple was simple and unadorned, and this courtyard was no exception. As he sat on the cot, he looked so cramped it seemed he couldn't even stretch his limbs.

"Kong Guxi!" Changxi called.

Kong Guxi flew up, then immediately plummeted from the air. He landed nearby, ignoring the indignity of his ancestor sitting forlornly in the courtyard, and stared at him with a terrified, outstretched neck.

Changxi murmured, "Kong Guxi, my Kong clan rose from humble beginnings. We were never fated to have a Purple Mansion cultivator. But a True Monarch was reincarnated and slaughtered my people, transferring their destiny to me. I was to ascend to the Purple Mansion realm only to be a stepping stone for another..."

At these words, Kong Guxi lowered his head in silence. Li Ximing frowned, and fear flickered in Sumian's eyes. Standing beside Li Ximing, he sighed, "He's grown senile! Such things cannot be spoken..."

As if ignited by the words, Changxi seemed to grow intensely hot. He kicked out his legs and rolled up his sleeves, hesitating before finally saying, "Follow Daoist Master Zhaojing's orders."

Kong Guxi nodded again. Changxi could no longer sit upright. He fell onto the cot, tossing and turning as a deep rumbling began to sound from beneath the earth.

At last, Changxi spoke his final words: "When I die, I will become a mountain, six hundred and twenty-one ren high. To the north, there will be three peaks, a hundred paces apart. To the east and south, nine peaks in total, covered in persimmon trees. The sunny slopes will be rich with red copper, the shaded slopes with white gold. From the true south, a spring will gush forth white jade, flowing south to form a creek that empties into Lake Xian. The waters will teem with vipers and black turtles. The descendants of my Kong clan may pay homage from afar, but they are forbidden to ascend."

"This junior will remember!" Kong Guxi sobbed.

Daoist Master Changxi let out a muffled grunt. "The pain is killing me!"

His cry was like a thunderclap. The earth meridians beneath them swelled as if inflated, and menacing white stones and massive peaks burst from the soil. Mountain peaks shot up like bamboo after a spring rain. Kong Guxi couldn't keep his footing.

His staggering, choked farewell to his ancestor was completely swallowed by the earth-shaking cataclysm, heard by no one. The ground beneath them rose dramatically. Red copper, white gold, and twelve peaks appeared one by one. A spring gushed forth, and trees grew so rapidly they formed a dense canopy, from which the faint sound of cicadas could be heard.

Changxi's words had all come to pass, without the slightest deviation.

The courtyard and the old man were gone, as if they had been an illusion. All that remained before Kong Guxi was a Daoist robe, hanging from a tree branch, swaying silently. The forest was terrifyingly quiet, filled with the shadows of branches.

He carefully pulled it down. After taking a few bewildered steps, he finally heard the cries of alarm and praise from the Xuanmiao Temple cultivators at the foot of the new mountain.

Kong Guxi thought, 'There should be laughter, too, shouldn't there?'

**A Note on the Essence Gathering Pills**

The Li clan received a total of seven Essence Gathering Pills from the Azure Pond Sect, all of the Veiled Yin and Radiant Essence type. The first two came from the Ning family, originally obtained through a trade between the Azure Pond Sect and the Xiao family.

These two were consumed by Li Chengliao and Li Minggong (it was originally meant for Chenghuai, but his cultivation path change caused a delay, so Minggong took it). At that time, the Ning family no longer had a Purple Mansion cultivator, so the decision was effectively Chi Zhiyan's. According to the plot, the Xiao family and the Azure Pond Sect had an ongoing trade relationship in pills. Xiao Chuting was in the Northern Sea at the time, and Chi Zhiyan knew the Li clan did not consume blood-qi pills, so he specifically selected those from the batch traded with the Xiao family.

Another point some readers might not know is that grey-patterned pills can also be refined from demon beasts, with slight differences. Li Ximing can distinguish them. I forgot to clarify this when the next five pills were used.

I was in a rush yesterday, so I'm making detailed corrections today.
