# Chapter 835: Seeking Guidance

The world went dim as the Great Void flickered. Ning Wan dropped Dantai Jin off on North Dan Island and flew for a thousand miles before the disquiet in her heart began to subside. Still, a cold sweat covered her body, and the lingering fear was palpable.

‘So this is a demonic fiend of Metallic Essence,’ she thought, her heart still racing. ‘No wonder the ancient records say that after the war between Immortals and Demons, these fiends ran rampant, and even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators couldn’t ensure their own safety. A great cultivator, empowered by divine abilities, could be killed in an instant… I always thought it was an exaggeration, but the reality is truly terrifying.’

The demonic fiend that Si Boxiu had become was likely of the Upright Wood dao, but it was mixed with some other unknown dao lineages, making it unnaturally horrifying. The sharp, majestic aura of Upright Wood, carrying with it wind, rain, and thunder, shot straight to the heavens with an intensity she had never witnessed before.

Such a fiend was born to live in the Great Void; outrunning it was impossible. At first, Ning Wan hadn’t fully grasped the danger. But when she estimated she wouldn’t last ten moves against it, a cold sweat of terror broke out. Only then did she notice that the surrounding Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were all fleeing, each faster than the last. Even Chi Buzi was nowhere to be seen.

‘No wonder the Metallic Essence creature inside Anhuai Heaven was able to catch that Purple Mansion cultivator off guard and devour him in one bite. A fiend born from Senior Yuanxiu's failed apotheosis is already this terrifying… A Metallic Essence creature left behind by a True Monarch… it must be no different from a True Monarch’s avatar!’

Still shaken from the experience, she was now on high alert, her senses sharpened to their absolute peak. At last, she detected a faint, azure shadow stepping through the Great Void. When it was still several dozen feet away, she snapped, "Who's there?!"

_Splash!_

A sheet of Pristine Water coalesced before her, and Chi Buzi stepped from the Great Void into the mortal world, now only ten feet away. ‘It must be the Chou-Gui Hidden Form,’ Ning Wan thought, a numbing sensation creeping up her spine. ‘The divine abilities of the Pristine Water dao are truly bizarre, capable of deceiving even the spiritual sense of a Purple Mansion cultivator. If Chi Buzi wanted to assassinate someone, anyone who hasn't crossed the immortal threshold of Purple Mystery would likely fall victim.’

Chi Buzi, however, simply smiled at her. "I came to ask fellow Daoist Ning," he said, "where is the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal?"

He had no ulterior motive. After all, Yuansu was dead, and the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal was an excellent treasure for trapping others. If he could borrow it, it would be a great help in his Demon-hunting endeavors. But the speaker may be careless, while the listener is not. Yuanxiu had just warned her before his death. The question struck Ning Wan with a jolt of fear.

"Reporting to Senior," she answered quickly, "when my elder fell, I was in seclusion. It happened that Lord Yuanxiu was also in Anhuai Heaven at the time. The seal was lost shortly after..."

"Oh?" Chi Buzi glanced at her, a smirk on his face. "What's the matter? Has the name of Azure Pond lost its weight? Or is Si Boxiu so incompetent that he doesn't even know who took it?"

In the next instant, understanding dawned on him. His expression turned grim. "There's a problem with that seal," he said coldly.

Ning Wan lowered her head, silent. Chi Buzi narrowed his eyes, took a step back, and studied her intently.

"Your elder... lost the seal. That is the seal of the Feathered Serpent. Is someone trying to use this as a pretext, using the methods left behind by the Feathered Serpent to destabilize the authority over Pristine Water?"

‘Please, just stop talking…’

The question made sweat pour down Ning Wan's back. She didn't nod, nor did she shake her head, simply standing in place as if she hadn't heard a thing.

But Chi Buzi was a man of immense cunning. In the past, he might have been tempted to serve Du Qing to the death. Now, however, he only wished for the two sides to cause as much chaos for each other as possible, so Du Qing wouldn't come looking for him. As for contacting the party that was making trouble for Du Qing, the thought never even crossed his mind.

‘Given Du Qing’s personality, the only way the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal could have gotten out is if it poses no major threat to him. At most, it's a minor annoyance. If I truly sided with someone trying to shake his Fruition Attainment over Pristine Water, I’d be the first to die a violent death!’

‘As for Ning Wan here, she needs to stay alive. It’s best to have a few Purple Mansion cultivators at Azure Pond to keep Pristine Water busy, so he doesn't think of me.’

He thus said, "Don't touch it. Your life depends on it."

Ning Wan nodded emphatically. Satisfied, Chi Buzi rose on the wind, a cold sneer in his heart.

‘I’ve witnessed the ceremony I came to see. Very good, a green-eyed ghost, is it? And you, mottled chicken… Your Lord Chi will have you join Yuse as a ghost!’

## In the World of the Mirror

A brilliant hall of shimmering light stood amidst pristine white clouds. The white bricks gleamed, and a jade platform was set in the center of the courtyard. A woman in tea-white robes stood guard, a stark white circular pattern adorning the spot between her brows, her expression reverent.

Beside her sat a white-robed immortal, his hand resting on the jade platform. Before him hovered a circular screen of light, the size of a washbasin. Within it, winds howled and lightning flashed, but the muffled roars were contained, reduced to faint vibrations.

On the other side of the platform, six jade slips glowing with a soft light stood arranged in a circle on a table.

Lu Jiangxian watched the changes in the mirror intently. He saw the handsome young fiend being bound by a gray Dharma Treasure, then slowly dissolving into points of deep green light that were dragged into the Great Void. The wind and rain over Shitang gradually subsided, but the once-clear weather had transformed into a humid, oppressive heat that seemed to radiate from the mirror.

He withdrew his gaze and pondered for a moment before picking up a jade slip. "He cultivated four paths of Upright Wood," he mused. "According to the Daoist scriptures in the archives, they were Journeying North, 'The Path Dedicated,' 'Scrutinizing Words,' and 'Carpenter's Measure'..."

"The fifth path he cultivated was 'Falcon's Roost,' from the 'Gathering Wood' dao... Perhaps he hoped to be accepted by drawing on the ancient scripture's description of Gathering Wood: 'Cultivators gather like a flock of birds coming to rest.'"

"The logic is not flawed."

Lu Jiangxian's understanding of the Dao was profound, and he quickly analyzed the core of the problem, sighing softly. "Among the Five Virtues, the paths of Dui (Reflecting Metal), Kan (Pit Water), Li (Radiant Fire), and Gen (Still Earth) are True Positions. These so-called supreme True Positions are inherently complete and reject supplementation. But the Upright Wood dao is a position of accumulation and reception; it naturally welcomes supplements but struggles with excess."

"A clever idea. The 'Falcon's Roost' he chose fittingly casts the Upright Wood as a fierce, descending falcon, seeking to roost within the Intercalary Position of Gathering Wood."

He waved his hand gently, and the scenes replayed in the mirror. "It's a pity," he lamented. "His four Upright Wood paths were too dominant, and the Fruition Attainment of 'Gathering Wood' was empty, offering no branch to perch on. His method for seeking the Metallic Essecne was also a complete mess. Naturally, he failed!"

Though Si Boxiu had failed, his struggle and careful deliberation placed him in the top tier among the many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators attempting their breakthrough. It was a lamentable end.

He let the jade slip for 'Clear Dusk Rain' dissipate, yet one question remained. "But where did the 'Pristine Water' come from? Even if he had concealed a measure of Pristine Water within him beforehand, it shouldn't have been enough to make the heavens rain, much less the Clear Dusk Rain that represents the Fruition Attainment of Pristine Water. He must have used some method to borrow Du Qing's authority."

He looked down at his own palm in thought, replaying Si Boxiu's series of actions in his mind.

"Was it the Pristine Merging Owl Pool? The bird-like circling was a feint, a symbol of achieving Gathering Wood, and should have nothing to do with Pristine Water... As for swallowing the finger..."

Lu Jiangxian was almost certain that this method was not something Si Boxiu had invented on the spot! He must have been emulating the breakthrough method of some ancient Golden Core, or perhaps even Dao Embryo!

‘To have figured out the method of combining Upright Wood and Gathering Wood without a master is commendable. But to inexplicably cause the heavens to rain down Clear Dusk Rain, there is definitely something more to it.’

Thinking of using Gathering Wood to ascend was the limit of his own genius. But the finger-swallowing method... even Lu Jiangxian was stunned by it. It wasn't a symbolic substitution from within the Fruition Attainment process; it was a direct imitation of the actions of some ancient Golden Core or Dao Embryo cultivator!

‘The Sima Family truly has some hidden treasures… What else would one expect from a family that traces its lineage back to the ancient state of Zhou…’

Lu Jiangxian pondered deeply, murmuring, ‘A pity… he didn't know you're supposed to spit it out _after_ you succeed…’

Those were the exact words spoken by the Underworld emissaries. Lu Jiangxian had observed them with his spiritual sense; they were not the same two from Li Ximing's breakthrough, but likely the ones responsible for the Southern Sea or the Shitang region. They were just as bizarre-looking.

‘This means the Underworld also knows of this method.’

Although Lu Jiangxian could read Daoist arts, the most critical secrets were obviously encrypted or passed down orally. He would likely never know the full story. He didn't dwell on it. ‘There is still plenty of time… the clues will only multiply. I wonder what Chi Buzi thinks, having witnessed this. He values his own path to the Dao above all else; this should convince him that his future lies with my faction.’

In the time since Li Ximing had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the number of Daoist scriptures Lu Jiangxian had accessed had grown exponentially. Most importantly, he had obtained a small portion of the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition!

Daoist Master Yuandao’s lineage was well-ordered and meticulously preserved. Not only did the texts require sigils to decrypt, but each art had a corresponding oral incantation. Fortunately, the tradition was generous, and the library collections available to inner disciples were quite rich. Though they didn't touch upon many Purple Mansion Realm techniques, the knowledge Lu Jiangxian gained had opened his eyes.

‘Nine Mounds is a Supreme Yin tradition, so these Purple Mansion techniques are of little use to me. However, this narrative of the Three Profoundities is worth studying.’

According to the writings of the Nine Mounds tradition, there were originally three progenitor paths in the world of cultivation, known as the Three Profoundities: Azure Profoundity, Encompassing Profoundity, and Comprehending Profoundity. No matter how the great Daoist traditions of the world had changed, they could all be traced back to one of these three.

Jiangnan's famous Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and the Peacock Sea's Nine Mounds Daoist tradition, both originated from Azure Profoundity.

‘And according to the decree read by the Golden Feather Sect, both Luoxia's Wu Light and Golden Feather Sect itself are Comprehending Profoundity traditions. Almost all of Jiangbei follows the Comprehending Profoundity path.’

"As for Encompassing Profoundity, I have yet to find any orthodox lineage. There are quite a few who have obtained remnant inheritances, like the Capital immortals Dao and the Changxiao Sect, but they are not considered orthodox."

‘This explains the Capital immortals Dao's predicament in Jiangbei. Their tradition is completely different from the others, and they’re seen as foreign imposters. The only ones who could be considered distant kin, the Changxiao Sect, are sharpening their knives… No wonder Yehui didn't dare to stay long in Jiangbei.’

Having sorted out the system of the Three Profoundities, Lu Jiangxian suddenly understood the framework of the current era and the source of the subtle discrimination and prejudice among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

As for how his previous incarnation, the leader of the Azure Profoundity and Supreme Yin—who might have also embodied the Supreme Yang—had fallen to his current state, well, that was an interesting question.

"At the very least, this Mount Luoxia is almost certainly up to no good. While the Dragon-kin are slightly better, they are ultimately a different species. The road to recovering my strength is long..."

Right now, the fragment of his main body within the Secret Diffusion Secret Treasury was not an easy thing to retrieve.

‘The Secret Diffusion Secret Treasury hangs in the Great Void, perpetually sealed. It opens for only a few days each year, hanging there in plain sight, yet I cannot take it.’

With all eyes in Jiangbei watching, and Li Qianyuan forced into the open, Lu Jiangxian was too cautious to even show his face. He had no idea how many True Monarchs were surrounding that small territory and had no intention of trying to retrieve the fragment by force.

Moreover, everything from the surge of spiritual energy in Jiangbei to Li Qianyuan's reincarnation had been obviously orchestrated. Almost everyone on that path had been replaced by followers of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition. The Chengyun Gate was even controlled by Golden Feather people. The sense of danger was overwhelming.

"Perhaps, retrieving that fragment will depend on this True Monarch."

He flicked his sleeve, and the mirror and jade slips on the platform vanished. A speck of violet lightning appeared in his palm, his expression growing complex.

‘Li Qinghong.’

Li Qinghong was one who had received a talisman from him. Back then, she had entered the Grotto-Heaven with Zikang. Lu Jiangxian had watched her fight her way from the south of the Grotto-Heaven to the north, all the way to the Hall of Thunder.

Finally, she had laid eyes on the endless draconic form of Beijia.

Li Qinghong had transformed into a Thunder Body by consuming lightning, but the connection through the Talisman Seed had not been broken. In fact, Lu Jiangxian had even received some feedback from it, though it only slightly enhanced his spiritual sense—better than nothing.

Although Lu Jiangxian only had a vague understanding of the Dragon Monarch Beijia's plans, planting such a key pair of eyes among the Dragon-kin was an excellent move. Even if Li Qinghong could only guard the Thunder Pool, it was enough for Lu Jiangxian to glimpse a piece of the puzzle.

‘This Dragon Monarch Beijia is not only extremely ambitious, wanting to become a True Dragon, but he is already preparing to assail the Dao Embryo realm!’

The matter of True Dragons involved that 'Azure Profoundity Son,' but no matter how Lu Jiangxian looked at it, a True Dragon was an existence at least above the Dao Embryo realm.

"Something that even a True Hornless Dragon at the peak of the Dao Embryo realm could not achieve back then, how could it be done without the authority of a Dao Embryo? Although the Dragon-kin have improved generation by generation and have been plotting for ages, to continue the great undertaking of their predecessors, one must at least reach the Dao Embryo realm."

He pondered for a long time before finally looking at Shaohui, who had been waiting patiently.

The Lesser Yin Celestial Attendant immediately bowed. "Reporting to the Mansion Lord, your subordinate has completed the composition of the 'Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity.' It is complete with a table of contents and contains body arts and spell arts sufficient to cultivate a divine ability. I have come to offer it to the mansion's library!"

The Lesser Yin Celestial Attendant was formed from the Sparrow demon Fuyu and had cultivated the Lesser Yin in her past life. When Lu Jiangxian, speaking through the Zhengao, had tasked her with compiling a scripture, the Celestial Attendant had been quite earnest, organizing the entire scripture from her past life that had led to her divine ability.

This was no small feat. After all, she had been a Demon beast before and now had a human body. Without a decent grasp of Daoist arts, organizing such a thing would have been difficult. Lu Jiangxian took it and glanced through it, nodding to himself.

‘Her efficiency is much higher than Dangjiang's!’

The 'Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity' led to the 'All-Fragrance Sinks' divine ability, a rare fourth-grade technique. Given Shaohui's own limitations, pushing this technique to the Purple Mansion Realm was her limit, so it naturally wasn't of the highest grade. Lu Jiangxian gave a slight nod. "It is adequate," he said casually.

One cannot make bricks without straw. After finishing this scroll, asking Shaohui to write another Purple Mansion Realm technique would be asking too much. "There are still Daoist scriptures in the mansion's library," Lu Jiangxian said. "Read them well. There is much to do over with Zhengao. Manage things properly."

The woman in the tea-white dress quickly withdrew. Lu Jiangxian thought to himself, "Given Chi Buzi's efficiency, Northern Buddhists are about to suffer!"
