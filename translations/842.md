# Chapter 842: A Farewell

The Hall of the Locust Soul did not keep Li Jiangqian waiting long. Before the heavy rain could even begin to subside, a black wind swept down from the north, arriving on the northern shore with a menacing roar.

But as soon as it crossed over Cold Cloud Peak and left Jiangbei behind, the storm seemed to lose its nerve. The black wind dissipated and the malevolent aura vanished, leaving only a withered, bald old eccentric flying low over the lake. He approached the grand formation array and bowed, his voice a wail.

"This humble one is Daoist Wu Gui, one of the eight great protectors before the throne of the Jiangbei Hall of the Locust Soul... I beg an audience with the noble of the Immortal Clan!"

Li Jiangqian had already given orders to have Daoist Wu Gui watched, so a guide was immediately dispatched to lead him in. Wu Gui hurried inside, and upon entering the main hall, he was struck by an oppressive and terrifying majesty. His gaze lifted to a pair of golden eyes gleaming from the shadows, and he immediately dropped to his knees.

"This humble cultivator greets the noble of the Immortal Clan! My Hall Master is engaged in a dispute with the Brahma Cloud Cave and could not come himself. I am here to apologize to the Immortal Clan on his behalf..."

With a single glance, Li Jiangqian knew this Wu Gui was far more astute than that old rat. Perhaps he had a better understanding of the powers in the Purple Mansion Realm, or perhaps he was just a natural coward.

'Hmm... this one seems more sensible. He might even end up serving under a True Monarch someday.'

Li Jiangqian adopted a stern tone and replied, "So, it is you, the men of the north! The Hall of the Locust Soul may have inherited its sacred lineage, but does that give you the right to ignore the rules of the Immortal Dao? To slaughter commoners at will and send this fiend to wreak havoc upon my river!"

Of course, Li Jiangqian had no idea if the man had actually used any blood qi techniques on the river, but he knew in his bones that this Daoist was far from clean. The accusation terrified Wu Gui, who stammered, "My lord... my lord... That beast Black Rat has committed many evils, and our Hall Master is also greatly displeased with him. He gave this humble one a direct order to capture him and bring him back for severe punishment. This is also our way of thanking you, my lord, for teaching him a lesson on our behalf..."

'Daoist Bai could say something like that? That donkey-brained idiot... could words like these actually come out of his mouth?'

Li Jiangqian understood that the man before him was merely smoothing things over to complete his mission. Since he had no intention of getting involved anyway, he took the offered olive branch and relented. "The Hall Master is right. He does indeed require proper discipline. As the leader of a major power, such actions are unacceptable."

Hearing this, Wu Gui hastily explained, "Precisely! Precisely! The Hall Master also said he intends to punish him by sending him away... to a remote outpost in the east to supervise low-level cultivators mining spirit veins. He will only retain his post as a warehouse keeper..."

Li Jiangqian shook his head inwardly. One plague after another. He drew out a token, intending to let Wu Gui retrieve the prisoner himself, but a wave of caution made him reconsider.

'I can't let them meet. This Black Rat is clearly a dead man walking, marked for death by someone else. Wu Gui is a complete fence-sitter. If he sees my family's treasure and lets his tongue slip later, he might bring some great power down on us to take our Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda.'

He changed his tune. "Wait here. I'll have someone bring him up."

Wu Gui nodded repeatedly. Li Jiangqian, meanwhile, pulled a message from Wang Quwan from his desk. Recalling that the man was in seclusion at Panglu Ridge, he asked in a low voice, "A remote outpost? To which mountain has he been assigned?"

Wu Gui quickly replied, "It is near the White Ye Immortal Sect, beside White Treasury Prefecture. As for mountains... there seem to be several ridges nearby, but no major peaks."

Li Jiangqian acted as though he had only asked out of idle curiosity and quickly lost interest. Secretly, however, he unfurled a map under his desk. A quick check confirmed his suspicion: Panglu Ridge was located in White Treasury Prefecture. The dominant local clan was even the Wang clan, a branch of Wang He from the Capital immortals Dao.

'Hoh.'

Not daring to involve himself any further, he watched as Qu Bushi escorted the prisoner in. The man, having spent only a few hours within the swirling winds of the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda, was already trembling uncontrollably. His Foundation Establishment Realm was clearly built on a weak foundation, likely a fluke achieved with blood qihe was nothing compared to the Wen brothers.

'Perfect. Since he reached the Foundation Establishment Realm through blood arts, his healing abilities will be exceptional. Once he returns and supplements his energy, these minor wounds will vanish. He'll be ready to handle the True Monarch's business right away...'

As he mused, a sudden uproar filled the hall.

"You damned plague! You dare to refine blood qi on the territory of the Immortal Clan! If I don't beat you to death, you plague-ridden cur, I won't be able to face the Hall Master when I return!"

The moment Wu Gui saw Black Rat, he began to curse and beat him. His words, of course, were a desperate attempt to save the man's life. Li Jiangqian watched in amusement, allowing the tirade to continue. Black Rat's face contorted with resentment, and he opened his mouth as if to retort.

*Slap!*

Daoist Wu Gui's hand was a blur, a single strike filling Black Rat's mouth with blood. Li Jiangqian clicked his tongue inwardly and gave a slight wave of his hand. Qu Bushi immediately shoved both men out of the hall.

Wu Gui's curses faded as the doors closed. Li Jiangqian gazed at Wang Quwan's letter and decided against a reply.

'A man as clever as him will understand something is wrong when I don't respond.'

The envoys from the Hall of the Locust Soul were sent on their way. As expected, Daoist Bai was caught up in a conflict with the Brahma Cloud Cave. The master of the cave was Pingwang Zi, the very same man who, years ago, had come with Wenhu to pay respects to Li Ximing, using the name of Chengyun Gate to secure his escape. Now, the tables had turned, and it was this old fox's turn to face misfortune.

'I wonder if he'll die at the hands of the Hall of the Locust Soul, or perhaps sooner, at the hands of Chengyun Gate... He is, after all, a man of Chengyun Gate in both name and deed. And then there was that Daoist Wenhu. If Wenhu hadn't died, he would be the one playing this role now...'

Li Jiangqian pondered this again and again. In his time, Wenhu had been a master of schemes and deception, yet Li Ximing had annihilated him with a single breath. Though Li Jiangqian had not been present, he remembered how Li Chenghuai had returned from the mountain deeply shaken, his skin slick with a cold sweat.

The young man in the black robe, seated upon the main throne, slowly set the letter down. His gaze was fixed on the vortex of fate that was Jiangbeia massive, swirling maw that could tear any genius to shreds. His expression was nearly cruel as he murmured a silent refrain.

"Fortune exhausted bars the Mansion's gate; a shallow fate prevents a greater state."

When Li Ximing had spoken those words, they were filled with melancholy. When Li Chenghuai had recounted them, he was full of lingering fear. Now, from Li Jiangqian's lips, they carried a cold cruelty and a deep-seated vigilance.

He sat with his back to the light, crumpling Wang Quwan's letter ever tighter in his fist. A brilliant flare of Radiant Fire leaped from his palm. Red and yellow flames twisted and writhed, swiftly incinerating the paper. A fine, gray dust drifted from between his fingers, scattering across the steps below his throne.

## Purple Smoke Gate

Within the blessed land of Purple Smoke, ethereal clouds of mist drifted and coiled. A rosy dawn broke, its golden radiance weaving through the purple light that flickered in and out of view among the clouds. At the very highest point, upon the Purple Terrace, the lights merged into a single, dazzling purple-gold brilliance.

The two protectors standing before the terrace wore solemn expressions. Beyond the flowing river of purple qi, the throne at the head of the hall was magnificent, its carvings profound and mysterious.

Daoist Master Tinglan, clad in autumn-yellow robes, stood amidst this vast sea of clouds. Today, however, she was not in the seat of honor but stood to the side, her body slightly bowed in a gesture of immense respect.

For on the throne sat another, a man dressed in a purple-gold Daoist robe, a scripture held loosely in his hands as he read with quiet intensity.

His face was strikingly young, with eyes like stars and slightly thin lips. His features were so perfect they seemed sculpted, like an immortal statue in a temple, yet he possessed an air of transcendent aloofness that set him far apart from the mortal coil. The simple act of him lowering his head to read was enough to captivate any gaze.

Tinglan's own bearing was exceptional, but standing beside this man, she seemed like a mere attendant deity, not daring to move an inch.

After an unknown amount of time had passed, the purple-gold light on the terrace began to recede. The man closed the book in his hands. Only then did Tinglan raise her hands, respectfully presenting a box of pills.

"Reporting to Martial Uncle, the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill has been successfully refined. We requested the aid of Daoist Master Zhaojing of the Li clan of Wei. A total of four pills were created... they are here."

After speaking, she also produced the original clay pot. "The Immeasurable Water and Fire is here as well!" she announced with reverence.

The man she called Martial Uncle closed his eyes for a moment. He took the pills with a turn of his hand, revealing irises of purple-gold. Then, pinching his fingers together, he began to calculate, his every movement as serene as a temple deity's.

The Purple-Robed Daoist Masters voice was like a deep, resonant bell. "The Great Ancestor... has manifested in the world."

Tinglan nodded respectfully. "Reporting to Martial Uncle... after I returned from meeting you in the Southern Sea, all the lineages of the Supreme Yang Dao gathered to discuss the matter. It was decided that our gate and Azure Pond Sect would handle it."

Hearing her words, it was clear this man was none other than the long-missing Daoist Master Zimuthe only great Daoist Master in the entire Yue State's Supreme Yang Dao lineage who had perfected all five Daoist divine abilities!

Daoist Master Zimu had clearly only just arrived. He listened to her report and stated flatly, "Xiukui sent Houfu, and the Hengzhu Immortal Dao sent Hengxing."

Tinglan cupped her hands in deference. "Martial Uncle's divine abilities are vast. Though you were not present, you knew exactly who each sect would send."

Zimu's perfectly sculpted face remained unchanged, but his tone was laced with disappointment. "The heavens do not favor our Supreme Yang Dao."

Tinglan paused, uncertain. Zimu sat quietly and continued, "Lou Xing was once hailed as the Dao Child of the Xiukui Dao, seen as the next great Daoist Master. His combat prowess is formidable, but his cultivation is lacking. He has been stagnating at the Purple Mystery stage for countless years, wasting endless life-shortening remedies in a desperate attempt to break through. If an event of this magnitude cannot even stir him from his seclusion, it seems he does not have much time left."

Daoist Master Lou Xing was of the same generation as the Three Yuans of Azure Pond. Zimu could lament his fate, but Tinglan wasn't a match for even a single one of the man's divine abilities; she would never dare to comment. She lowered her head and listened as Zimu spoke on. "When he and I pass from this world, the Supreme Yang Dao will have no more champions. The final rays of the Green Pine Temple's last golden age will be extinguished."

His words made Tinglan's head snap up. Zimus voice was soft. "The great Azure Pond Sect, a power on the level of an upper sect, nearly collapsed entirely. Now, it leans on a Daoist Master who cultivates frost and has only just entered the Purple Mansion Realm. The Sword Gate's reputation was once so great it sought to emulate the Thunder Palace and uphold the morals of Jiangnan. For centuries, it has been in steady decline, now relying on the Li family for backing, too timid to even step outside its own gates."

"Xiukui and Hengzhu are both branches of the Moon Radiance Branch. The Great Xiukui Monastery will soon be left with only Houfu and Kui Qi. The Hengzhu Immortal Dao is fierce and unyielding; their war with the Murong family shattered the very lineage that had just begun to show promise. Hengli and Hengxing... they were propped up by the very last dregs of the Hengzhu foundation..."

"Cultivation Transcendence has entered seclusion and is no longer in the Yue State. Once I am gone, this blessed land of Purple Smoke will be left with only you."

Tinglan was speechless. "But... but no matter what, we are still the Supreme Yang Dao..."

Zimu gave a cold laugh. "A fine Supreme Yang Dao, indeed. A Supreme Yang Dao that doesn't even cultivate the 'Supreme Yang'!"

Tinglan dared not speak again. The great Daoist Master took a step forward, his voice low. "The Immortal Mansion has been in seclusion for years. Li Jiangqun was even besieged and killed at Moongaze Lake. Where do you think the deterrent power of the Supreme Yang Dao comes from? It used to be our Dharma Treasures! One Pristine Water, one Cultivation Transcendencethose two are still fighting in the heavens! Others may not know what kind of person Pristine Water is, but how could we not? The only one who might have intervened to protect us, Cultivation Transcendence, no longer even comes to Jiangnan. And that 'Yuzhen' has gone to the Northern Sea to establish a new lineage!"

"Ultimately, it is the Supreme Yang Dao. All five houses can sit at the same table. A Purple Mansion Realm expert from one house is an expert for all five. A great Daoist Master is a great Daoist Master for the entire Yue State. To put it nicely, it's mutual aid. To put it bluntly, it's collusion, a force to intimidate all of Jiangnan... Now, with Lou Xing and myself gone, tell me, can the five houses combined even compare to a single Golden Feather family?"

"Most importantly... there are no more great Daoist Masters. Yuandao will not get involved... and so, the Supreme Yang Dao will have no more great Daoist Masters."

His gaze drifted to the distant sea of clouds as he spoke grimly. "Li Jiangqun bought the Supreme Yang Dao another five hundred years, but even that must come to an end. Our cultivators fail time and again to break through to the Golden Core Realm. Azure Pond was forced to cede Shitang, and a man as domineering as Lou Xing didn't even raise a single question..."

Tinglan met his solemn, statue-like eyes. "Whether he is still alive remains unknown."

After a long moment of contemplation, Tinglan said respectfully, "But... how can the Supreme Yang Dao truly decline? The younger generation has its share of brilliant talents. We could summon a dozen Purple Mansion Realm experts at a moment's notice. If a great war were to break out in Jiangnan, surely the Underworld would not allow it."

Zimu held the scripture in his hands, his tone placid. "The Underworld has been too lenient with you, so much so that you now see them as your protectors. When the time comes that Jiangnan not only lacks great Daoist Masters but also cultivators with the *potential* to become one, who knows how long they'll have to wait to harvest Metallic Essence. Do you think the Underworld can't devise another plan? If they change their minds one day, all of you will become little more than stray dogs."

He continued with detached coolness, "The mortal world's Fruition Attainments of Wu Light and Luoxia make you all tremble with fear, keeping you on edge day and night, too afraid to even voice a complaint. Yet the Yin Division of the Underworld and the powers of the North are factions of the same caliber, and you feel no fear of them. It seems you have been kept in this pen for so long that you can no longer even see where your masters are placing their game pieces."

Tinglan was speechless. She could only bow low. "I beg Martial Uncle... for guidance!"

Zimu's figure was imposing, making Tinglan appear small and delicate before him, barely reaching his shoulder. Her expression was a mixture of confusion and unease.

Zimu smiled faintly. He paced once around the Purple Terrace, as if bidding a final farewell to the blessed land that had birthed and raised him. He reached out and gently patted her head in a comforting gesture.

"Rest assured. No matter how bad things get, you can always hide in the blessed land. The spiritual shield will be left for you. There is no need to return the Immeasurable Water and Fire to me. As long as there is no news of my demise, the blessed land will remain safe. Should I perish, you can offer the Dharma Treasure as tribute, following the example of the Tuoba family."

"The legacy left by my own master, my martial sisters, and even Ancestral Master Taixu has allowed me to perceive the mysteries of the Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence. I will now journey to the far east, to the source where the purple qi flourishes, to seek my path."

He raised his eyebrows, and his eyes began to glow with a purple-gold light. His lips were as red as vermilion, his face as smooth as porcelain jade. Layers of purple qi billowed from beneath his feet, and his voice took on the resonance of a Brahma chant:

"On this journey to the far east to seek Fruition Attainment, if I see the purple qi coming from the east, behold the Celestial Capital's Purple Tenuity, hear the vast music of the Empyrean Heavens and the chorus of a hundred immortals; then the dying embers of incense will be restored, fallen wood will become scripture, and the deer and birds will all come to bow before me. The twenty-three mountains and one realm of this Purple Smoke Blessed Land will then rise from the earth, ascend beyond the heavens, and transform into a grotto-heaven."

Hearing his proclamation, Tinglan fell to her knees, kowtowing endlessly. When she had completed the nine prostrations and finally looked up, the throne before her was empty. All that remained was a single, sparkling, perfectly round purple-gold orb.

"A Dharma Treasurethe Purple Qi Immortal Origin Mystic Shroud!"
