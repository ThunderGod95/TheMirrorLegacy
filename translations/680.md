# Chapter 680: Two Qis

“‘Bright Yang’…”

Li Zhouwei considered the past. The fall of the Wei and Li dynasties had been orchestrated by Buddhist cultivators, so it was only natural that the northern Buddhists would have designs on the Fruition Attainment. “So it would seem,” he ventured, “that with the death of the Undefeated King of Brightness, the Buddhists lost their bid for the ‘Bright Yang’ Fruition Attainment.”

“Correct.”

Bai Rong’s mouth snapped shut. It was a long moment before he uttered the single word. Li Zhouwei took the hint and asked no more, sitting quietly on the Dharma artifact as it flew on.

‘Dingjiao…’

The Dragon Prince had certainly treated him well, but a deep-seated suspicion lingered in Li Zhouwei’s heart, a doubt he never dared to show, given the Dragon Clan’s immense power.

‘The Azure Pond Sect and Mount Luoxia are no saints, but is the Dragon Clan any better? The matter of the thunder-swallowing scheme is still unresolved, and for thousands of years, the dragons have rarely played a noble role…’

The Dragon Clan’s plot to devour the thunder had been in motion for years. Li Qinghong’s fate in the sea was still unknown, and there was no way Dongfang Dingjiao was ignorant of it. Yet the Dragon Prince had acted as if nothing was amiss, laughing and conversing with him, treating him with immense warmth.

Throughout his stay in the palace, Li Zhouwei had maintained a calm facade, offering smiles where appropriate. It was all the face he could give Dingjiao. Firstly, the Dragon Prince’s station was noble. Secondly, by befriending him, he hoped he might create even a sliver of a chance for Li Qinghong’s survival.

‘And in the worst-case scenario, if the matter with the Dragon Clan is already beyond saving and our elders are doomed, I absolutely cannot let the dragons think our family harbors a grudge. Saying nothing, acting as if I don’t care at all, is the best course of action.’

If he were to bring up Li Qinghong to Dingjiao, it would lay his concerns bare. The consequences of a refusal from the Dragon Prince were not something the Li family could endure. And so, Li Zhouwei had acted as if he had no worries in the world. Only now, away from the dragon palace, did he allow himself to think on it.

‘Dingjiao’s casual attitude means one of two things: either the thunder cultivators involved in the scheme will at most lose their cultivation and not their lives, or he sees me purely as a White Qilin, an entirely different species from the Li family members I consider kin.’

Despite Dingjiao’s repeated courtesy, Li Zhouwei found it impossible to truly connect with him, let alone reveal his inner thoughts. All their interactions had been polite formalities. ‘The true nature of my family’s relationship with the Dragon Clan, the real reason for Dingjiao’s friendliness… the answers will likely only surface after the thunder-swallowing affair concludes.’

‘Unfortunately, Bai Rong and Dingjiao delayed me for too long. I can no longer go to the Southern Sea. I’ll have to wait for the next opportunity…’

Li Zhouwei spent some time cultivating cross-legged on the artifact before they finally reached Moongaze Lake. The moment they arrived, Bai Rong sprang to life.

“Next time something like this comes up, you can count me out, even if it kills me,” the fox sighed. “It was both boring and exhausting…”

He was a homebody who preferred to stay holed up on his mountain peak and was already eager to return. He flatly refused Li Zhouwei’s invitation to stay and fled on his artifact as if escaping a plague.

Li Zhouwei, meanwhile, rode the wind down to the island. As he made his way to the main hall, he found a youth in pleated robes waiting outside. The boy’s body radiated a golden spiritual qi as sharp as a sword. Seeing Li Zhouwei, he quickly stepped back and bowed.

“Third Brother!”

“Zhouluo, you’re here.”

Li Zhouwei had only met this fourth brother of his a few times, but Li Zhouluo bowed with profound respect. “It has been a long time, Third Brother. You labor so hard for the family, traveling far and wide. We other brothers are not as capable and can only help with small matters at home. The thought fills me with shame.”

Li Zhouwei gave him a surprised look and nodded. “You’re too kind, Fourth Brother. We all simply have our roles to fulfill. Since you have reached Qi Refinement, you are a pillar of the family. You must not belittle yourself.”

“I will take your words to heart.”

Li Zhouluo smiled. His innate talent was second only to Li Zhouwei’s among the Zhou generation. As a descendant of Li Xizhi’s line, his aptitude was naturally high. Though he lacked a Talisman Seed, he had reached Qi Refinement at eighteen, only slightly slower than Li Xijun had been.

His golden aura flowed like stalks of wheat, splitting into six streams that circled his body with long, fiery tails, as nimble as sparrows. It highlighted the brightness in his eyes, giving him the sharp, spirited air of youth.

He was cultivating the *Gleaming Gold Spirit-Searching Art*, a rather impressive ancient technique. The Li family had recently acquired the Gleaming Gold Feather Liquid when they broke a great restrictive formation, making it possible to practice the art. As the first to do so, Li Zhouluo was naturally full of vigor.

Li Zhouwei had a good impression of him. He nodded and smiled. “I have reviewed the *Gleaming Gold Spirit-Searching Art*. I believe it has the potential of a fourth-grade technique, no worse than any other. Cultivate it well.”

This unexpected praise brought a thrilled look to Li Zhouluo’s face. He followed Li Zhouwei into the hall.

“Where are First Brother and Second Brother?” Li Zhouwei asked casually, referring to Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang. They were older than him, so he had seen more of them over the years and knew them better.

Li Zhouluo smiled. “They are both in seclusion beneath Mount Qingdu. They are expected to reach Qi Refinement within the next two years.”

“Excellent!” Li Zhouwei praised, partly for his two brothers’ progress and partly in approval of Li Zhouluo’s open and generous attitude. His voice softened considerably. “My father has been in seclusion for a long time, and Aunt Minggong and Uncle Chenghuai are also at the point of breaking through to Foundation Establishment. The sooner you all reach Qi Refinement, the sooner you can take up the family’s burdens.”

Li Zhouwei knew his own standing. Few uncles could speak to him so casually, let alone his brothers. He clapped Li Zhouluo on the shoulder. “Both Kongheng and I have left the Eastern Sea, leaving Zongquan Island unguarded. Once your two older brothers emerge from their seclusion, the three of you should discuss who will lead a party to the Eastern Sea to stand guard.”

“As the family head commands,” Li Zhouluo said respectfully.

Li Zhouwei smiled and dismissed him, his previously heavy mood lifting considerably. He walked up the steps to the rear hall, where Li Xuanxuan, having heard the news, was hurrying to meet him, his face filled with hope.

“Minghuang, what did the Dragon Prince have to say?”

Li Zhouwei first invited him to sit down in the hall. He hesitated for a breath before speaking softly. “It is still uncertain if there is a chance for a turn of events. At the very least… His Highness Dingjiao gifted me a treasure in thanks.”

He took out the Concealed Plunder Gold and recounted his journey, omitting and altering details as necessary. The old man shook his head as he listened, and in turn, told Li Zhouwei about the incident with Fu Xia.

Finally, Li Xuanxuan dropped the subject. He took two jade slips from his robes and placed them in Li Zhouwei’s hands. “Minghuang,” he said gravely, “we must begin preparing the spiritual qis for the two children.”

Li Zhouwei accepted the slips, his spiritual sense sweeping over them.

“Bright Parting Blazing Essence: One must find a place where the earth’s veins of Li Fire converge. Then, using four types of Li Fire—Profound Yang, Contemplating Fire, Celestial Yang, and Surging Li—one must refine baleful fire, extracting the essence of the four Li Fires. This essence must then be exposed to celestial light for six months to produce a single wisp. Ten wisps make one portion.”

“Supreme Instrument Whole Mercury: One must find a place where the properties of things change and transform. Using a treasure from a Whole Pill cultivator as a nexus, yin and yang spiritual objects for balance, and five-element treasures for regulation, one can produce a single wisp every one hundred and eighty-one days. Ten wisps make one portion…”

This was the gist of the two slips; the rest of the details were operational techniques and tricks. The texts were far longer than typical qi-gathering manuals. Li Zhouwei had already read them.

“Both of these are troublesome,” Li Xuanxuan said in a low voice. “The complex methods are a secondary concern. The main problems are finding the spiritual fires and a place where the properties of things change… Do you have any ideas, Minghuang?”

Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment. “Grand-uncle Ximing has a Li Fire flag,” he asked. “It contains five types of Li Fire. Do you know which ones they are?”

Li Xuanxuan had already considered this. He took out the crimson-yellow flag. “I’ve already asked him. It has five types of Li Fire, but only Contemplating Fire and Surging Li match our needs. The other three are different. We are still missing two.”

“He also gave me the location of a place in the Eastern Sea with Li Fire earth veins, perfect for gathering qi.”

Li Zhouwei thought for a moment and immediately had a plan. “Elder, do you remember the Intercalary Sun Art? The only spiritual fire in the family belongs to Grand-uncle Ximing, his Long-March Pheasant Flame. That fire was converted from Profound Yang Li Fire.”

At his words, the old man nodded. “So, if we reverse the art to convert it back to Profound Yang, we’ll have one of the two we need. We’ll just be missing Celestial Yang. Where can we find that?”

“There’s no need to look elsewhere.” Li Zhouwei shook his head. “Elder, you probably haven’t read the Intercalary Sun Art in detail. Celestial Yang is also part of the conversion process. We can first use Profound Yang for the refinement, then use the Contemplating Fire and Surging Li from the flag. While that’s happening, someone else can convert the Profound Yang into Celestial Yang. They can then return and continue the process. There is no need to search for it.”

“Good.” Li Xuanxuan nodded in sudden understanding.

“Aunt Minggong cultivates fire arts,” Li Zhouwei continued. “She will have to make the trip. Have her take An Siwei and a few others to the Eastern Sea. From what I see, the location Grand-uncle gave is near the Suzhù Reefs, so it should be relatively safe.”

Li Xuanxuan, however, doted on the younger generation. “Minggong and Siwei are always burdened with tasks. It seems a bit unfair…”

“The arrangements will be handled properly,” Li Zhouwei said soothingly. “We can use this as an opportunity. When they return, we will give them Essence Gathering Pills and have them break through.”

“Excellent!” Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan relaxed considerably.

Li Zhouwei was always decisive in handling clan affairs. He was already thinking about the Supreme Instrument Whole Mercury. “A place where the properties of things change and transform… I’ve never heard of such a thing, but I know a place that fits the description perfectly.”

Li Xuanxuan had been agonizing over these problems for some time. He raised his eyebrows expectantly.

“Chengshui Marsh!” Li Zhouwei declared. “That place was the site of a great battle. It was once suppressed by the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal, turning it into a sea of Pristine water. Then, it was transformed into converging water by the combined efforts of several Purple Mansion cultivators. I can think of no place that better fits the description of a place where the properties of things change!”

“As for the Whole Pill treasure… the family possesses a drop of mercury of a rather high grade. It belongs to a Whole Pill cultivator, so others cannot use it, which is why it has been kept in storage. Now is the perfect time to use it.”

Hearing how easily he had arranged everything, Li Xuanxuan readily agreed.

“However,” Li Zhouwei added, “Chengshui Marsh is dangerous. It would be best to have a Foundation Establishment cultivator overseeing the operation. We will have to ask Elder White Ape and Li Wen to make the trip.”

“You arrange it as you see fit!” With the spiritual qis for the children now secured, Li Xuanxuan was greatly relieved and departed in high spirits.

The hall fell silent. Li Zhouwei waited for a moment before taking out the jade slip recording the Intercalary Sun Art. He stroked the patterns on its surface, his eyes narrowed in thought.

‘What a powerful technique… what a convenient technique…’

He knew this had come from Tu Longjian. He even suspected that the Intercalary Sun Art was one of the most crucial core legacies of the Dongli Sect. The thought was chilling.

‘This thing… why isn’t a single secret art locked? How could it not be locked! To be read so freely by anyone!’

No one in the world would be foolish enough not to place security restrictions on their cultivation arts. Their own family’s *Great River and Grand Mound Scripture* had been sitting inaccessible for nearly a hundred years for that very reason. How could a great power like the Dongli Sect leave such a critical legacy completely unguarded?

‘And the Whole Pill treasure… Chengshui Marsh just happens to exist… and we just happen to have a drop of mercury. Even if the mercury wasn't suitable, there’s still that Purple Mansion spiritual object stored with Hengzhu.’

Li Zhouwei pushed the thoughts aside. He casually approved the scrolls on his desk, setting down his vermilion brush before allowing himself a moment of contemplation.

‘Now even Kongheng has been forced away. If more trouble comes, it will be difficult to handle…’

Elder White Ape was about to head north to gather qi. The family once had many Foundation Establishment cultivators, but now their ranks felt empty. After a moment, he summoned Chen Yang.

Chen Yang, now at the fifth level of Qi Refinement, entered and cupped his fist in a salute.

“Zongquan Island has been empty for too long,” Li Zhouwei said in a low voice. “First, have Guest Elder An make a trip to the Eastern Sea. If Uncle Cheng is out of seclusion, have him return at once.”

He paused, then added, “If there is any other news, write back immediately.”

Chen Yang bowed and departed. Li Zhouwei sat in silence for a quarter of an hour, then abruptly waved his hand. The great doors of the hall boomed shut, sealing him off from any outside disturbances or prying eyes.

While the sun was high, he took out the stone box containing the Bright Yang object, the Concealed Plunder Gold.

‘Once this object leaves the deep sea, it must not be exposed to moonlight. A single glimpse of the moon will instantly transform it into Balanced Qi.’

A pale gray spiritual water swirled inside the box, reflecting a tiny point of bright yellow light. His spiritual sense, however, could detect nothing. Li Zhouwei simply channeled his spiritual qi and raised the box before him.

He felt a faint heat on his brow, and the bright yellow reflection in the box vanished in an instant.

A point of bright light appeared within his Shengyang Acupoint. His spiritual sense felt as hot as fire. Li Zhouwei steadied his mind and began to circulate the art for Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. The point of light immediately shot downward like a falling comet, trailing a searing tail of flame through the twelve-storied tower of his throat and plunging into his Juque Palace.

Li Zhouwei kept his eyes closed for a long time as light and shadow flickered around him. Finally, he exhaled a breath of celestial light that filled the hall with a brilliant golden glow. He opened his eyes, the gold within them slowly fading.

“A fine treasure.”

The flow of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, which had previously circulated sluggishly in his Juque Palace before slowly rising to his Shengyang Acupoint, was now several times thicker and moved with incredible speed. With just a thought, it could erupt from between his brows in a matter of breaths.

‘Never mind how much its power has increased, this speed of circulation finally makes it usable in actual combat…’

He had not been practicing Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light for long. A normal cultivator at their peak could mobilize it in a few breaths. By the time he perfected this Dharma light, he might be able to unleash it in a single breath.

The Concealed Plunder Gold was far more useful than he had imagined. Li Zhouwei was in a good mood, but he wasn’t satisfied yet. He left the hall, took to the air, and flew to Mount Qingdu, where he retrieved two jade slips from the ancestral shrine.

Both techniques were appendices from the *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun*.

One was a sixth-grade Li Fire profound light: Great Parting’s White Brilliance! The other was a fifth-grade Solar Li Fire art: the Sun’s Resonant Parting Art!

‘My family’s Bright Yang lineage is closely related to Li Fire. Cultivating Great Parting’s White Brilliance should be as suitable for me as it is for a cultivator of fire virtue.’

‘As for the Sun’s Resonant Parting Art… although it is not a Dharma light, it is a Solar Li Fire art. Since the Concealed Plunder Gold is a solar Bright Yang object, it might even provide an enhancement!’
