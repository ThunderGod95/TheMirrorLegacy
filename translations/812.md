# Chapter 812: The Jia-Yi Configuration

'Underground... a white light...'

He mused internally, 'The Chengyun Gate built an underground palace. I heard its deepest part lies beneath Xiaoshi Mountain. Perhaps it’s related to the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage... Secret Diffusion, Secret Diffusion... both are of the Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage. Their ancestors were the same branch.'

As the master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, Li Xizhi now possessed extensive knowledge. Although he couldn't access the core Dao repository of the Azure Pond Sect, over a decade of studying their vast collection of texts had still granted him a profound foundation.

'Earlier, I speculated the Immortal Mirror was an immortal artifact from the Moonlight Origin Mansion. But how is it suddenly connected to Mirrored-Mirage? Since the Moonlight Origin Mansion shares its source with the Supreme Yin Dao lineage, it definitely shouldn't be the same path as Mirrored-Mirage. If it is, then something is wrong...'

Li Xizhi pondered for a moment, sheathed his sword, and stepped out of the pavilion. He crossed through his residence and passed the threshold, arriving at another estate.

Li Xizhi’s grotto-mansion had two layers of restrictions, inner and outer. He didn't need servants waiting on him; rather, he was wary of anyone spying on his techniques. Thus, he kept no one within the grotto-mansion itself. Only upon entering the attached residence did he finally see figures. After passing through several more courtyards, a woman in palace attire greeted him.

"You've finished so early this time... did something happen?"

Li Xizhi replied: "I had a breakthrough earlier. It's a good thing."

The breakthrough Li Xizhi mentioned was, naturally, in the [Five-Color Sinking Expanse Sword Art]. This was a sword technique that emphasized both swordplay and Dharma Arts equally. Li Xizhi possessed the Talisman Qi [Rainbow Pierce Skyway], so cultivating in seclusion boosted his Dharma Arts, which in turn applied to this [Five-Color Sinking Expanse Sword Art].

This was an exceptionally difficult sword art, but Li Xizhi only needed to focus on practicing the swordplay. Not only was the difficulty massively reduced, but the process even showed faint signs of pulling his sword Dao cultivation upward in reverse. His long-stagnant sword Dao was advancing once again.

Yang Xiao'er had been his wife for many years, and Li Xizhi naturally understood her concerns. He placated her with a sentence, then extended his hand, palm up, and smiled.

"Look."

A bright, warm-white stream of light floated up from his palm, shifting into yellow and white hues. They interwove and roamed like the sky clearing after rain, a rainbow suddenly appearing, its colors blending, before condensing back into the warm-white light and sinking down.

Yang Xiao'er didn't feel the slightest sharpness from it. She blinked, then realized with joyous surprise: "Sword Essence?"

Li Xizhi smiled and nodded, speaking softly: "Years ago, when I descended on Dew Pot Island to fight for the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda, the dragon kin didn't intervene, but there were more than enough cultivators from the Southern Sea. While Dharma Arts are strong, they are easily countered by specialized artifacts. Now that I have Sword Essence, future matters... will be much more convenient."

Yang Xiao'er smiled and agreed. Her expression turning serious, she turned, retreated, and firmly shut the doors on both sides. The grand array activated. She then retrieved a talisman from her robes and pressed it to the door, causing dark light to flow across its surface.

Ensuring they were completely alone, she stepped forward and whispered: "I asked my family. The current spiritual aura is changing rapidly. With the demonic cultivators purged, life is flourishing. Small clans and sects are springing up like bamboo after the rain. The entire Shitang region is linked... The islands are almost all covered in Ginseng-Timber Wood... The family noticed."

The spiritual aura of the Southern Sea's Shitang region had always been Crossing Peril and Solidifying Enterprise. It was a pure Earth Virtue spiritual aura, beneficial to demonic cultivators and Earth Virtue, and balanced toward all Twelve Qi, yet it curiously did not suppress lightning. The rampage of demonic cultivators in recent years was inextricably linked to this aura. In the last few years, this aura had grown increasingly unstable and was already reaching its time of decline.

When a spiritual aura rises, it can uplift countless cultivators and nourish spiritual objects. But when it declines, it requires the sustenance of those same cultivators and the symbolism of spiritual items just to maintain its existence. Li Xizhi’s suppression of the Shitang demonic cultivators had severed the last thread keeping the aura clinging to life, accelerating its collapse.

This had forced the master of Thunder-Hearing Island to defy the Azure Pond Sect's pressure and personally attack Li Xizhi. In the end, even that Purple Mansion from Thunder-Hearing Island was suppressed in the Great Void by a single talisman from Yuanxiu. This affair was incredibly complex behind the scenes, but the story that circulated externally was merely that the Lord of Thunder-Hearing Island had challenged Li Xizhi and narrowly lost by a single move.

Even disciples of immortal sects could only vaguely perceive it as a conflict of interest between Shitang North Dan and Thunder-Hearing Island, or at best, part of the struggle between the righteous path and the demonic path. Only Li Xizhi and a select few others knew that Purple Mansions had actually clashed within the Great Void.

But Yuanxiu pushing Li Xizhi to the forefront immediately unsettled Yang Xiao'er. She began to investigate the true aim behind suppressing the demonic cultivators and altering the spiritual aura, returning to her sect several times to probe her family for information.

She brought up the Ginseng-Timber Wood, and Li Xizhi nodded, replying: "When I inspected Shitang back then, I saw that the Ginseng-Timber Wood the Lingu Family planted on the islands had already spread everywhere. I knew purging the demonic cultivators was just a matter of time. The Ginseng-Timber Wood is lush and vibrant, never withering through the seasons, an evergreen vine in this Southern Sea climate. Now these small clans and sects are rising... and sure enough, they've started raising the Lingu Family's Wu Oakworms..."

"Although the Lingu Family withdrew from this place, most of its lifelines are still held by the Azure Pond Sect... or rather, by the Lingu Family. Otherwise, why would they have given it up so easily? It’s just that this spiritual aura is constantly changing. I fear something is about to happen."

Yang Xiao'er's expression turned grave. She whispered, "This is only what's on the surface... There is another meaning. According to my brother's research, Ginseng-Timber Wood is pillar wood. In ancient times, this category was called Jia Wood. The Wu Oakworms are also aspected wood, wood of vibrant life and propagation, which is called Yi Wood. When the two combine, it is the Jia-Yi configuration. You pacified Shitang, and though not the head of the Azure Pond Sect, you are a pillar. Shitang is birthing new small clans, which is also propagation. This is also a Jia-Yi combination... There are too many such analogies. Looking back at when the Lingu Family ruled Shitang, most of the events fit this pattern."

"The elders in my family predict that the transformation of Shitang's spiritual aura will take at least another year or two... and there is a seventy percent chance it will transform into the [Jia-Yi Configuration]. It is shifting to favor Wood Virtue..."

Li Xizhi understood immediately. He let out a heavy breath and said, "Jia and Yi combine, taking the image of Metal. The [Jia-Yi Configuration] likely benefits Upright Wood. Daoist Master Yuanxiu and the Lingu Family have been cooperating for many years, not just one or two. I was just handling the cleanup... He wants to attempt the Golden Core realm in the Southern Sea... But he clearly only has four Divine Abilities. Has he cultivated a fifth?"

Yang Xiao'er lowered her gaze. "He probably couldn't find a fifth Dao lineage, but his lifespan is what it is. Even for a Wood Virtue cultivator, he doesn't have much time left. He has to make the attempt now, whether he's ready or not. Do you remember Anhuai Heaven? I heard the Dao repository of Anhuai Heaven was burned by Daoist Master Yuanxiu. Perhaps he already found a substitute for the fifth Divine Ability back then. He didn't want anyone else to know, so he ruthlessly burned it. Now, driven to desperation, he is preparing for a final gamble."

Li Xizhi rubbed his temples. "That makes sense. I heard that among the Three Yuans of the Azure Pond Sect, Daoist Master Yuansu had the highest talent, but lacked Dao lineages. Daoist Master Yuanxiu also far surpassed Yuanwu. Now he's attempting the Golden Core; even in death, he wants to go out with a bang. It’s just that if he dies, I'll be the one held over the fire."

Yang Xiao'er nodded silently. Chi Wei annihilated generations of geniuses, and Chi Buzi vanished. If Yuanxiu dies, the Azure Pond Sect will be left without a single Divine Ability cultivator. But, as a Supreme Yang Dao lineage, no one would dare offend them directly. Their overseas interests, however, would be impossible to protect...

Although Li Xizhi had a brother in the Purple Mansion realm and was himself a vital figure in the Azure Pond Sect, meaning Thunder-Hearing Island wouldn't dare touch him, the Shitang region he had governed for so many years would likely be lost.

What worried her more was Dantai Jin's attitude. She whispered, "Dantai Jin is acting as the Sect Master now. If something happens to Daoist Master Yuanxiu, and he doesn't transfer you back, husband, that will be real trouble... His backing from the Nine Mounds Dao lineage is not simple; they don't fear ordinary Purple Mansions!"

"It shouldn't come to that." Li Xizhi shook his head. "He won't leave me in this place. There are far more important places than the Southern Sea. Even if he wanted to gift Shitang to the demonic cultivators, sending the Lingu Family would be more appropriate. I am a stabilizing presence right now. Dantai Jin needs me... I only fear that the Miao Family and Changxiao are colluding. That would be troublesome."

As the couple was speaking, the dark light on the door suddenly trembled. Yang Xiao'er immediately fell silent. A few breaths later, a knock came:

"Knock knock... Sir, Lord Quan has returned to North Dan and wishes to report to you!"

Li Xizhi's interest stirred. He gave his wife a slight nod, calming her anxious mood, before pushing the door open and saying warmly:

"Have him bring the person up."

Soon, Quan Yuduan strode quickly into the estate, followed by a youth in black robes who looked around with some apprehension. Behind him was the sword-bearing Si Xunhui, while Li Wushao followed grimly at the very rear.

"Greetings, Master / Grandfather / Lord!"

Li Xizhi scanned the group first, not spotting Li Chenghuai. His expression unchanging, he pondered for a moment before nodding to Li Zhouluo with a smile.

"Seats!"

Once everyone was seated, Li Xizhi raised an eyebrow. "How did Chenghuai reply?"

Quan Yuduan presented a letter with both hands. "The Young Master did not reply, but he sent back this letter for you, Sir."

Li Xizhi accepted it, placing it on the desk without opening it. He smiled at Li Zhouluo. "Zhouluo, you must be weary from the road. This has been a hard journey. I have already prepared a residence for you. Go and rest first."

Li Zhouluo had no objections and nodded quickly. Li Wushao led him away. Li Xizhi was most concerned about the Immortal Mirror fragment. Logically, since he had just viewed the vision, there was no way Si Xunhui and the others should have exited so quickly. He frowned.

"Xunhui, what of the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage?"

Si Xunhui gave a wry smile and shook his head. "Master, we entered the underground palace and reached the deepest part. There was an altar inversely flooded with Converging Water, a world within itself... but inside it was total darkness, assaulted by water, fire, and lightning. Those Foundation Establishment cultivators went deeper, while we could only cling to the edge and endure. We collected one or two useless spiritual items and had no choice but to retreat."

Li Xizhi understood immediately. "It seems it requires at least a Foundation Establishment cultivation base... It's beyond our reach for now. It hasn't been easy for you either, holding out for several years. These years of being flooded by water, burned by fire, and struck by lightning have also been greatly beneficial to you. Go and cultivate..."

Si Xunhui bowed and presented a jade slip, saying respectfully: "I spent time on the journey recording all the obstacles within. It is all documented here. This can also serve as reconnaissance for the sect; perhaps it will fulfill another disciple's opportunity."

Li Xizhi chuckled and shook his head. Currently, the fastest cultivator of the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage was Si Xunhui himself; who else could cultivate it faster than a young master of the Si clan? The slip was of little value. He just waved his hand, dismissing him.

After Quan Yuduan also withdrew, Li Xizhi finally picked up the letter. He unfolded it and read, staring blankly for a long moment before refolding it with a long sigh.

"Hai..."

Yang Xiao'er emerged from the hall again. Li Xizhi ground some ink and said quietly, "The child wants to come out, but still has some lingering knots in his heart. I'll persuade him. I'll seize the opportunity these next few years to keep him by my side, and then have Zhouluo wed and send him back... When the tides rise in the Southern Sea, we won't have the good treatment we enjoy now!"

***

Moongaze Lake.

Dawn had just broken, its light flowing over thousands of homes. The continent was orderly. Golden light pooled on the floor tiles of the great hall.

Li Jiangqian, dressed in crimson robes, was pacing the hall. The policy of Merit Shelters and Dao Stipends had been implemented for several months, requiring the clan to supplement a massive amount of details and regulations. This, combined with the timing of the rites, left him pressed for time. Being a cautious man, he ultimately decided against risking the hunt for a Foundation Establishment Demon.

He reflected that it wasn't much of a loss. He had just broken through to Foundation Establishment, and receiving the rites now would only stabilize his cultivation and push him to the threshold of the mid-stage. It would be better to wait five or ten years, ideally receiving the rites while at the mid or late Foundation Establishment stage, where he would need to spend more time grinding his cultivation anyway.

'If it weren't that the Purple Mansion realm is too far off, and I lack complete certainty, it would be even better to condense a Divine Ability before receiving the rites! After all, there are shortcuts for Foundation Establishment cultivation, but there are no shortcuts for condensing Divine Abilities in the Purple Mansion realm... Even if there were, the cost would be enormous for only a ten or twenty percent boost. If the Talisman Qi's wondrous ability to boost cultivation could also be used at the Purple Mansion stage, it wouldn't just be saving three to five years of effort!'

Although there was no Foundation Establishment Demon to sacrifice, the rites were still overwhelmingly complex. With two major affairs stacked together, he had been run off his feet for months.

Of course, as the recipient of the talisman seed, he too had sensed the phenomenon days ago. After the initial joy, only a vague anxiety remained.

'I heard cultivators from several sects have returned, and Si Xunhui also returned fully loaded, already taking Uncle Zhouluo to the Southern Sea. Yet, there’s still no word from Wang Quwan.'

It wasn't that Li Jiangqian cared for the man; he was currently the clan's only Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage. If he perished in that underground palace, who knew how many years it would be before they could retrieve that treasured sword!

He mulled it over. Just as Miaoshui finished healing from her injuries and emerged from seclusion, her cultivation having greatly improved, the clan's available Foundation Establishment manpower eased up. He dispatched Miaoshui to Chengshui Marsh to provide support. After all, that woman used to operate in Jiangbei before her surrender; she understood the dynamics of various places and was less likely to attract trouble.

He was pondering this when Cui Jueyin entered the hall, bowed, and reported:

"Clan Head..."

Li Jiangqian had summoned him. He politely bade him rise and smiled.

"I heard something these past few days. Several cultivator families in the clan's West Residence have either hired guest elders, invited other clan members, or simply taken the field themselves to instruct their disciples in Dao debates."

Cui Jueyin replied, "This subordinate has also heard. This matter... is difficult to criticize..."

"It's fine," Li Jiangqian said. "But we cannot let them monopolize it. Please organize several guest elders to also establish an academy in Milin. Offer free instruction to the mortal clan members in their studies... Once the first few batches have passed their examinations, we can rotate these personnel out."
