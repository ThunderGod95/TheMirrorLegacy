# Chapter 413: Brothers Bound Together

After two years of careful nurturing, Lu Jiangxian observed the murky qi of heaven and earth surging within the mirror, accompanied by flowing golden light and a subtly rising aura. With his divine sense, he traced the connection from the mirror to the talisman seed.

"Li Xuanfeng has established his foundation..." he murmured.

The feedback from Li Xuanfeng's breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm was even less substantial than before, only slightly strengthening his divine sense and the Profound Light, just like when Li Chejing first broke through to the Qi Cultivation Realm.

The subsequent breakthroughs of other Li Family members in the Qi Cultivation Realm gradually showed diminishing returns, generally lacking any significant qualitative change.

Now that I have the means, I need to grow a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator...

As Lu Jiangxian's mastery of shamanic talismans grew stronger, he gradually possessed more shamanic techniques. To his dismay, all of them were of the Moonlight lineage, which drew unwanted attention and made it likely that all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would covet any Auspicious Children[1] he raised...

I'll just have to wait for the Li Family to offer that Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's dharma blood before I can plan further.

The talisman qi was condensed by mixing essence qi, incense, and soul. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's dharma blood could not be obtained easily, and Lu Jiangxian had to rely on the ritual performed by the Li Family to get it inside the mirror.

"It's a pity that the mirror can't house cultivators for now... Otherwise, everything would be much easier!"

He mused to himself for a while before a fragmented voice reached his ears.

"The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine with unwavering devotion year upon year... Observing the three yuan festivals and six regular festivals, we maintain reverence—ensuring to pay timely respects... Through the smoke of our offerings and the blood of our sacrifice..."

Swoosh.

A white light pierced through the layers of gloomy clouds and mist, landing in Lu Jiangxian's hand while a series of red beads also appeared on the table. Lu Jiangxian used his mana to secure them and first examined the talisman qi in his hand.

"It's a mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm demonic creature."

He assessed that the talisman qi was somewhat weak. Mount Dali was challenging to access, and most of the demonic creatures in Moongaze Lake were cunning and grouped together; capturing this demon must have been quite a feat.

"It is good that I still have reserves."

Lu Jiangxian had saved many excess Qi Cultivation Realm gray talisman qi left over from the Li Family's previous sacrifice rituals. He drew out a strand and combined it with the weak gray talisman qi in his hand. The Li Family still had plenty of talisman pills, so no further additions were necessary.

His divine sense swept over the jade platform on the mountain where the Li Family members who had received a talisman seed stood.

"Talisman qi can assist in breakthroughs and improve cultivation progress... It is best bestowed upon a Qi Cultivator. Since the generations of Xi and Yue are still Embryonic Breathing cultivators, it is better to save this until there is a Foundation Establishment Realm white talisman to give out."

Then again, talisman qi could only be granted to those who had received a talisman seed. After much consideration, Lu Jiangxian's gaze settled on Li Xuanxuan, who appeared emaciated and aged after narrowly escaping death with the Blood Escape Technique previously.

Sixty years of arduous effort, and now his cultivation path has been obstructed... Perhaps I should bestow this talisman on him. With a pill, he should be able to elevate to the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

With a deft movement, the gray talisman flew into Li Xuanxuan's brow like a meteor.

A light appeared before Lu Jiangxian's eyes and several gray characters emerged—Holding Profit and Keeping Prosperity.

Unlike in the past when the Li Family members had several talisman qi to choose from, Li Xuanxuan was given only one option.

This particular talisman qi, though uncommon, could slightly enhance the success rate of alchemy, talisman drawing, and other hundred arts of immortal cultivation. Based on Lu Jiangxian's current understanding of talisman qi, it should also be able to balance fortunes, calm storms and mitigate any potential turmoil.

"This talisman qi is a decent one for Li Xuanxuan... It's a blend of fate and divine ability. With its protection, he should be able to live a few more years."

After bestowing the talisman qi, Lu Jiangxian returned his attention to the blood beads on his table.

With a gentle manipulation of his mana, the blood beads quickly melted and merged, forming a fist-sized crimson jade pearl. Lu Jiangxian swept his divine sense through it, silently discerning the divine ability it harbored.

I knew it... Chi Buzi's Dao foundation is the Heavy Murk.

If Chi Wei could advance to the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, then surely the Azure Pond Sect must have a complete set of cultivation techniques to build the Dao Partners. I wonder which metallic essence these Dao Partners are after...

Observing the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Jiangnan, they all seem intent on avoiding cultivating the same Dao lineage. If it is the Pristine Water Origin Talisman Essence they are looking for, will it impact the Pristine Water True Monarch?

Lu Jiangxian's limited understanding of cultivation realms above the Purple Mansion left him with a nagging doubt.

I guess I can only wait for a more suitable time to gather further information...

When blood was spilled on Mount Lijing's jade platform, the catfish demon collapsed immediately. Blood light and incense slowly floated away, invisible to the onlookers.

Li Xuanxuan was closely monitoring the younger ones in the family when he suddenly felt something stirring in his Shenyang Mansion. A gray light appeared and the mana in his body surged.

Stunned by the unexpected surge in mana, Li Xuanxuan's face flushed. After a few moments, he grasped the situation and quickly seated himself cross-legged.

The Li Family members quickly stepped back, and after the time it took for a stick of incense to burn, Li Xuanxuan's cultivation realm had risen from the fourth to the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He slowly exhaled and opened his eyes.

"Congratulations, Father!" a group of juniors said in unison.

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard, smiling broadly as he explained the function of his new talisman qi to his family.

"I never thought I'd receive talisman qi at this old age, and its effects align so well with my needs... With this, my success rate in crafting talismans has improved!"

He laughed, then cheerfully pulled Li Yuanjiao closer and said, "Maybe I should stabilize my cultivation for a few years, then use that talisman pill to reach the late stage of Qi Cultivation Realm and boost our family's combat power."

Li Yuanjiao naturally congratulated him and nodded in agreement, inwardly pleased with the outcome.

Despite that, the blood of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had not been particularly impactful. It had merely produced a gray talisman. While it looked more refined than usual and glowed slightly brighter, it was still just a gray talisman and too ordinary to be given to Ximing or Xijun.

By the time a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator emerges in our family, those two children should also be in the Qi Cultivation Realm... Perhaps by then, we should hunt for a Foundation Establishment Realm demon to request a talisman for them.

Two separate sacrificial rituals were being conducted at the mountain. The one hosted by those who had received a talisman seed in the Li Family took place atop the mountain, while another happening at the foot of the mountain was overseen by Li Xicheng. As the eldest of the generation of Xi and Yue, Li Xicheng led the others in his generation in a ceremony that was both lively and vibrant.

Li Yuanping had planned everything meticulously. Although Li Xicheng initially felt awkward about not receiving a talisman seed, his role in managing the ceremony proved to be a strategic decision. It not only prevented him from feeling out of place but also provided valuable exposure for the younger members of the Xi and Yue generation.

Feeling the weight of his responsibilities, Li Xicheng had begun preparing half a year ago. Now, with the ritual successfully completed without a hitch, he finally let out a sigh of relief and noticed only then that his back was soaked with sweat.

As soon as he changed his clothes after descending from the sacrificial platform, someone came over to inform him that Li Yuanjiao wished to see him.

Without further delay, Li Xicheng hurried up the mountain. Upon entering the main hall, he saw a man dressed in a black robe sitting at the center, his brow furrowed with concern.

Ever since the passing of the Old Ancestor, Second Uncle rarely smiles...

Unbeknownst to Li Yuanjiao, these changes in him were more apparent to Li Xicheng, who, being significantly older than his younger brothers, remembered vividly what Li Yuanjiao was like in his youth.

Given his kind and generous nature, Li Xicheng was an empathetic person. He kneeled and greeted, "Xicheng pays his respects to Second Uncle of the fourth lineage! Congratulations on your significant advancement in immortal cultivation!"

1. The Auspicious Children in this context refers to whoever in the Li Family that received a talisman seed. ☜

Although Li Yuanjiao originated from the first lineage as a direct descendant of Li Changhu, he had been adopted into the fourth lineage as a direct descendant of Li Chejing. However, the major sect on the mountain was close-knit and typically overlooked such nuances, paying attention to these distinctions only during formal events.

Unbeknownst to Li Xicheng, whose heart ached to see the changes in his second uncle, Li Yuanjiao also harbored feelings of guilt toward him.

Back then, this child wasn't picked for the talisman seed and I had to make him leave the mountain... And now, I have to take away the spiritual qi of heaven and earth aura that he rightfully deserves to his younger brother...

Though Li Yuanjiao felt guilty, his decisive nature did not allow him to dwell on it for long. He paused briefly before saying warmly, "Xicheng, now that you've broken through to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, it seems that your cultivation efforts are paying off."

"Cheng'er dares not feel complacent about his progress," Li Xicheng replied modestly.

After a brief conversation, Li Yuanjiao said bluntly, "Uncle Donghe has managed to gather that Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi in the west. It's estimated to arrive in a year or two. This spiritual qi is extremely difficult to collect; the family has spent seven years just to gather a portion of it... Since this resource is so scarce, I'm afraid not everyone in the four lineages can receive it. It will only be allocated to the second lineage..."

Li Xicheng was slightly taken aback before he hurriedly replied, "Xijun is now also at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm! It's better for Second Uncle to reserve this spiritual qi for himself! Cheng'er is not as talented and fears wasting such a precious resource... I cannot bear to make my younger brother wait another seven years."

Li Yuanjiao had not even finished speaking when Li Xicheng interrupted him. He halted his speech, sitting up straight with a hint of dangerous suspicion in his eyes.

Hm?

Having led his family, commanded soldiers, killed adversaries from Mount Yue, and dealt with corrupted nobles, Li Yuanjiao was accustomed to cunning and deceit. Consequently, Li Xicheng's display of loyalty aroused his suspicion, causing him to narrow his eyes as he scrutinized the young man closely.

Yet, upon observing Li Xicheng, he saw clear, honest eyes. Despite Li Xicheng's plain appearance and weak presence, his gaze was filled with trustworthy sincerity.

"You..."

Li Yuanjiao averted his gaze, secretly ashamed of his skepticism. He nodded and said solemnly, "If that's what you truly think... then very well, you may leave now."

As Li Xicheng bowed and was about to leave, Li Yuanjiao's mood lightened. He laughed warmly and sighed, "Ah! You're... You're truly a good older brother... Xijun is fortunate to be your younger brother!"

Li Xicheng turned back and shook his head. He bowed to Li Yuanjiao again and said warmly, "Second Uncle, as the eldest of my generation, whether it's Xijun, Ximing, or Xizhi who is currently training in the immortal sect, they are all my younger brothers. Brothers bound together by blood should stay united. Covetous envy or struggles for power are not in my nature, nor do they interest me."

This was the first time he had spoken so boldly to Li Yuanjiao. Standing with his spear slung behind him and his robes billowing, his expression was earnest. In his mid-twenties, the young man was at the height of his heroic vigor that lent a dignified air to his ordinarily plain and almost overly honest face.

"Good!"

Li Yuanjiao tapped his knuckles on the table and sighed, feeling a weight lift from his heart. He chuckled, beckoning Li Xicheng closer. Taking a jade bottle from his sleeve, he said, "This is our family's secret Barrier Breaking Pill. Take it and break through to the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Strive to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm before thirty... it will do you good. This potion is astonishingly effective, a treasured ancestral elixir that must remain a secret."

"Understood!"

Li Xicheng's face lit up as he accepted the bottle. After taking a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, he patiently awaited further instructions.

Li Yuanjiao waved his hand with a smile and said, "Go now, find a cave dwelling and attempt your breakthrough in seclusion."

Li Xicheng nodded then retreated. Li Yuanjiao took out several pills and spirit items from his storage pouch, arranging them on the desk before writing a brief note to Li Yuanping.

"Cheng can be the mainstay of the clan. He is respectful to his elders and cherishes his younger peers. Second Uncle lived frugally when he was still alive, and the second lineage suffered. Wutu Peak shall provide the sustenance and spirit resources he needs."

After putting away his brush and ink, the smile on Li Yuanjiao's face slowly faded. He gazed into the distant sky, piercing through layers of clouds, and thought he saw a handsome and dignified face smiling back at him.

Brothers bound together by blood should stay united...

Big Brother...

Meanwhile on Mount Lijing...

Li Ximing had not returned home in two years. Upon his return, he and his father, Li Yuanping, discussed family affairs late into the night. After their long conversation, he first visited his mother, then Madam Dou.

Madam Dou, the wife of Li Xuanxuan and mother of Li Yuanping, was a distinguished Qi Cultivator within the clan, known for her formidable abilities.
𝕗𝕣𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝚋𝚗𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹.𝚌𝕠𝚖

Li Ximing, who had always been dearly loved by his grandmother since childhood, was now also a Qi Cultivator. Upon their reunion, she eagerly handed him pills and spirit items, whispering, "These are from your grandmother's maternal family... Just use them without reservation!"

Li Ximing smiled wryly as he accepted them, then spent a few days settling a few family matters. Finally finding some leisure time, he sat on the stone steps of the small courtyard under the moonlight and began meticulously organizing his medicine pouch.

Xiao Yuansi had prepared a set of medicine-gathering techniques for him. Li Ximing had devoted himself to studying it and was now seeing modest benefits. At least, he could now store most spirit items of the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms without damaging their medicinal properties.

Brother Cheng invited me to Eastern Mount Yue. He has probably prepared a few spirit items... Big Brother always puts others before him...

As he was lost in thought, a sudden tap on his shoulder startled him. Unguarded in the safety of his own home's formation, he looked up with a smile to see a figure with sharp eyebrows and bright eyes.

"Xijun!"

Li Xijun, usually somber and reserved, rarely smiled. Seeing his brother after so many years brought a smile to his face as he leaned in, sniffing. "You have a strong scent of herbs on you!" he commented playfully.

Li Ximing replied with a warm smile, "That's how Master Xiao's medicine-gathering technique is... The scent is quite potent but it can sharpen your mind and soothe your soul."

"You seem to have softened up quite a bit," he added.

Li Xijun stood with his hands clasped behind him. Among the brothers from the generation of Xi and Yue, he most embodied the Li Family's spirit. While Li Xicheng was generous and Li Xizhi was graceful, Li Ximing was gentle. Only Li Xijun remained cautious and skeptical, carrying his sword with him everywhere he went.

Li Ximing chuckled and asked, "I heard you've been training diligently on Mount Yuting every day... What brings you home so suddenly?"

"Second Uncle sent for me."

Li Xijun's face turned slightly gloomy as he continued in a subdued tone, "I wonder why Uncle Jiao summoned me up the mountain. He spoke of Big Brother's generous nature, insisting that it not be taken for granted... He also mentioned that I am more talented and should watch out for my big brother."

His gray-black eyes shimmered in the moonlight, giving him a particularly striking look as he added with a hint of suspicion, "I wonder if he's indirectly blaming me... Given my big brother's nature, who wouldn't get along with him? Could someone be gossiping..?"

Li Ximing replied softly, "Uncle Jiao lost his brother when he was younger... Perhaps he was just being emotional and fearing that history would repeat itself. I've heard that the performances in the Liyuan Theater below the mountain often leave the audience in tears, regardless of their age."

The two fell silent for a while. Li Xijun, cradling his sword, finally spoke softly after a long pause.

"Brother Cheng is gradually taking over home affairs. Our half-brothers have families of their own, you and I are approaching the Qi Cultivation Realm and Second Uncle is nearing the Foundation Establishment Realm... The clan's future will soon rest in our hands."

He turned his head slightly to the side, the cold blade in his arms catching the moonlight and gleaming coldly as he chuckled.

"Study well with the fire, while I take to the snowy paths... With your medicine and my blade, the clan has nothing to fear!"

Li Ximing laughed in cheerful agreement.

"Indeed!"

The two brothers shared spirit wine under the moonlight, conversing through the night—from Azure Pond to Jiangnan and its northern reaches. It was only when dawn broke, painting the world in golden red, that they staggered to their beds.
