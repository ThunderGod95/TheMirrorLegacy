# Chapter 950: The Scroll

The man was clad in green robes, cinched with a golden tassel. His figure was slender, and his blue-black hair whipped about in the snowy wind. Against the backdrop of the frozen blizzard, he looked utterly transcendentâ€”and he was the spitting image of the man in the painting.

His eyes, however, were what truly defined him. They held a hint of a smile, flashing with a azure-purple light that seemed to contain the very essence of his divine ability. They were the perfect finishing touch, adding an immensely uncanny and transcendent aura to his presence.

Suiguan.

Li Wushao stood quietly and respectfully, showing no reaction at all. He behaved as if the person who had just taken the painting from his hand was Li Zhouwei or Li Ximing, and he simply waited in silence for his next instruction.

'This!'

Li Ximing, however, had already shot to his feet inside the pavilion. He stood on high alert, as if facing a formidable foe. His lips were pressed into a thin line, betraying his tension as he felt the near-terrifying Pristine Water divine ability radiating from the man. The Heavenly Light between his own brows dimmed slightly in response.

'Speak of the devil and he appears! Was he lying in ambush this whole time? Did he hear what we were saying?'

'Is he here for Minghuang... or has he sensed something else amiss?'

Li Zhouwei was less surprised than his grand-uncle; he seemed to have anticipated this. He rose out of respect and gave the man a slight nod, lowering his gaze.

"Li Minghuang Zhouwei of the Moongaze Lake Li Clan greets the Great Daoist Master."

Only then did Suiguan shift his gaze from the painting, a mocking light in his eyes. He casually placed the scroll back into Li Wushao's hands as his azure-purple pupils slowly drifted over.

"Oh?"

His handsome face turned to the golden-eyed man.

"To this day, people are still raising Hooked Serpents? I suppose it's for the hooks on their tails."

The shock in Li Ximing's heart finally began to subside. His expression quickly softened, and he replied politely, "Li Wushao was one of our ancestor's Spirit Beasts. Back when our clan was weak, he rendered great service. He is an honored guest-elder of the family; we would never presume to 'raise' him."

"Most Hooked Serpents lack any significant pedigree, to say nothing of one from the Mansion Water Dao." Suiguan shook his head. "How rare. I was wondering why those youngsters from the Heaven-Probing Pavilion were so interested. So it's a trusted Demon beast acting as a confidant, that's not so surprising... It's just exceptionally rare for a Mansion Water Hooked Serpent to possess such talent... and the Morning Cold Rain at that."

His words made it perfectly clear to both of them: this man had been eavesdropping when Quan Yuduan and his disciple-brothers were speaking. A chill crept into their hearts.

'...All these Pristine Water cultivators have the same temperament... It's bad enough their minds are so sharp, but they're also masters of concealment... It's just that bastard Chi Buzi is more insidious and unscrupulous. This one, by contrast, has an added layer of domineering arrogance...'

Suiguan's expression remained neutral, but he strode forward and sat down at the round table in the pavilion. He smiled. "No need to be so courteous. Sit."

As soon as he was seated, Li Wushao moved naturally to pour tea, filling the cups for all three Daoist Masters. Li Ximing watched him furtively, noting that his expression was normal and his eyes were clear. There wasn't the slightest trace that he was being controlled by a divine ability.

'What a terrifying Life Divine Ability... I can't very well use my own divine ability to probe him right in front of Suiguan, but his expression, his movements... they all seem to stem from his own free will. There's nothing wrong at all!'

While he observed Li Wushao, Li Zhouwei was studying the renowned Great Daoist Master from Pristine Speech Heaven. His hand rested on his teacup as he mused silently:

'He's making no effort to conceal his cultivation base; it's on full display. He is a great practitioner who has completed all five arts. He wears no expensive adornments, quite different from the one at Luoxia... In terms of cultivation, Suiguan is nearly on par with the master of Mount Luoxia. But a fight is about more than cultivation; it comes down to divine ability, lineage, spell arts, and Spiritual Artifacts. Although Suiguan shows no outward signs of power, judging by his ageless appearance and the rumors linking him to the Golden Core realm, even the master of Luoxia would have to be wary of him.'

Before either of them could speak, the Great Daoist Master stared into his clear tea, his expression growing thoughtful. His voice dropped, becoming low and resonant.

"I heard... the Li clan has one who has attained a divine ability, serving under the banner of the Dragon-kin... I wonder, do you still have contact with them?"

Although no one spoke of it openly, the relationship between Du Qing and the Dragon-kin was notoriously bad. The incident where the True Hornless Dragon devoured the Feathered Serpent was known to all. It was a clear sign of Converging Water's domineering desire to annex Pristine Water. Even after this True Monarch Lushui, Du Qing, achieved his Fruition Attainment, rumors persisted that he dared not step foot outside of Jiangnan. Their relations were, of course, terrible.

The moment Li Ximing heard this, his heart sank. Li Zhouwei, however, replied, "Years ago, the Dragon-kin disseminated the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring. A clan elder happened to acquire it and, left with no choice, ventured deep into the Eastern Sea. She eventually transformed into lightning, and we have had no contact with her since."

Suiguan laughed. "Not bad at all. Li Qinghong... one rainbow, one cloud. Beijia is certainly living the good life these days. It's just a pity there are no true heroes left in the world, letting one or two of those vile dragons run rampant in the Eastern Sea!"

Li Ximing had been about to respond, but those words made him snap his mouth shut. He adopted an impassive expression, pretending he hadn't heard a thing. Suiguan, however, continued with a dark sort of humor.

"You don't need to worry about me causing trouble for her. In this climate? Forget me, even Du Qing himself wouldn't bother making a trip to the Eastern Sea.

"Other people care about their reputation. Beijia is the most shameless of all. He had the gall to brazenly ask an immortal for a title. Lying in wait for Du Qing in the Inner Sea? That's exactly the sort of thing he _would_ do."

After that, not only did Li Ximing lower his head in silence, but even Li Zhouwei found it difficult to respond. He had to stiffly change the subject.

"To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Great Daoist Master? What guidance do you have for us?"

Li Zhouwei asked. Suiguan took a sip of tea. "I came looking for you, of course."

He said, a smile playing on his lips, "I came out of Pristine Speech Heaven only to find a massive upheaval. I finally had a few useful people under my command, and now they're all gone. To make matters worse, that pack of pigs and dogs from the north is getting aggressive again. It's all deeply unpleasant."

The smile in his eyes finally faded, replaced by a sharp chill. Outside the pavilion, the falling snow hung suspended in the air, frozen solid beyond a certain radius. It was clearly enveloped by his divine ability, undetectable to any ordinary person.

"And now, I intend to cross the river to handle some business. And... to tidy up the scenery a bit."

As he spoke these words, a chill went through both listeners.

Suiguan might throw around names like Du Qing, Beijia, and "vile dragons" casually, but for years, everyone had regarded him as an extension of True Monarch Lushui's will. His actions were seen as Du Qing's intentions. The implications of his statement were therefore profound.

'Does this mean True Monarch Lushui truly intends to raise the banner of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition once more?'

"What... arrangements does the Great Daoist Master have in mind?"

Suiguan glanced at the small cup in his hand and smiled. "I want your Li clan to cross the river."

"And not just your clan. The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition must cross. The Azure Pond Sect must also cross."

Although his face was smiling, his violet-green eyes were haunting, like a placid pond that looked clear but was, in fact, a bottomless abyss that swallowed all light.

Li Zhouwei was silent for a moment before asking in a low voice, "Does the Great Daoist Master intend to wage war against the North?"

Suiguan chuckled. "What's all this talk of 'war'?"

At his words, the pavilion fell utterly silent. The Great Daoist Master rose slowly and paced a few steps, gazing out at the sky full of frozen snow.

"Within a year and a half, Qi Lanyan will inevitably start a dispute. I want them to smash their heads against the iron wall of Shanji and be driven back, losing Xuanmiao in the process..."

His face was still smiling, but it was impossible to tell how much of what he said was truth and how much was deception. He spoke as he took the scroll back from Li Wushao.

"I just need you to participate. And for the Li family to provide some of its cultivators."

"Cultivators," coming from him, clearly didn't mean Embyronic Breathing or Qi Refining peasants. He meant Foundation Establishment Realm practitioners, at the very least.

The two fell silent, considering his words. Suiguan turned his head, seemingly unconcerned, and picked up the scroll again.

He produced an ink brush from thin air, dipped it lightly into the tea in his cup, and then unfurled the scroll. He gently dotted the brush twice within the painting's empty eye sockets.

_Drip!_

Instantly, the sound of Pristine Water echoed, dripping without end. Grotto-springs seemed to gush forth as clouds and rain churned. A damp, watery qi spread through the air, forming layered veils of pale green mist.

Violet-green pupils materialized within the two empty sockets. The faint green that had merely hinted at the color of the robes rapidly expanded, flooding the painting with full, vibrant color. The entire scroll came to life, as if Suiguan himself were standing within it.

"Ning Wan will arrive first. When she does, your Li clan and the Azure Pond Sect are to cross the river and pin down the enemy. Those few Purple Mansion Realm rogue cultivators will be deployed alongside you."

He held the top of the scroll and rolled it up with gentle, meticulous care. He even retied the silk ribbon, making the entire package neat and tidy before placing it on the table.

Li Zhouwei watched silently, the light in his golden eyes flickering. He could faintly sense the surging Pristine Water power contained within the scroll. Suiguan had already turned and was slowly descending the steps, his voice drifting back with that same mocking laugh.

"Your family... being pinned against the riverbank by all those northern figures... Don't you have any temper at all? Make a list. If there's anyone who's rubbed you the wrong way, feel free to 'invite them to view the painting' when the time comes."

Before his voice finished echoing, the green-robed man had vanished. The world of frozen snow instantly resumed its motion. A whistling, cold wind gusted into the pavilion, sending ripples across the surface of the tea.

"Caw!"

The long, drawn-out caw of a distant crow punctuated the scene as the blizzard, and all its attendant noises, returned to life. The world was no longer silent.

"Huuu..."

Li Ximing let out a heavy breath. He saw that Li Wushao still hadn't noticed anything unusual and was standing quietly at his side. "You may go," he said.

Li Wushao bowed and swiftly departed. Only the two Daoist Masters remained in the snowy pavilion. A faint Heavenly Light enveloped them, and in a flash, the pavilion was empty.

The two traveled by light, reappearing a moment later within the Cloud-Gathering Southern Sky grand formation on Cold Cloud Peak. The lanterns lining the path brightened slightly at their arrival. Li Ximing glanced at the scroll in his handâ€”he did not open it, of courseâ€”and passed it to Li Zhouwei. Li Zhouwei found a private, secure vault to hang it in, and then the two vanished in silence.

They flickered into existence within the inner sanctum of their own Purple Mansion formation. Only then did Li Ximing lower his eyes and dare to speak, sighing as he shook his head.

"In this world... there are truly no safe places left."

"Suiguan's command... Tinglan and Houfu will find it impossible to refuse. Besides, the situation with Qi Lanyan is their problem to begin with, so they have no reason to decline. This matter is set in stone."

Li Zhouwei nodded, reflecting, "Although I don't know his true objective, as long as Suiguan is willing to make a move, the situation will change completely. We must be prepared."

His golden eyes were full of calculation. Li Ximing said in a low voice, "He most likely came here for this scroll, to use it as a trump card. First, he wants to take advantage of the fact that you are difficult to divine, which will let him catch the North off-guard. Second... he wanted to meet you."

"This matter... I fear I shouldn't get involved."

They had both arrived at the same conclusion. Li Zhouwei's expression was grim. "Grand-uncle is right. It's long been said that his behavior is erratic, that he may not even be human. How much of what he says can be trusted? What if this is just Pristine Water's master expressing dissatisfaction with Mount Luoxia's recent actions, making a subtle move? Suiguan isn't known for caring about his subordinates. As pawns in their game, how many of us can expect a good outcome? Grand-uncle, you absolutely must not get involved."

"His words were mainly directed at me. After all, I'm the one who cannot be divined. At most, grand-uncle should remain here to guard the lake and prepare for any sudden changes."

Li Zhouwei calculated for a moment, then continued, "Fortunately, according to his timeline, we have about a year and a half. That's barely enough time to try and touch the Immortal Foundation... More importantly, the Grand Ascension should be ready by then. At least I won't have to fight them bare-handed."

Li Zhouwei had clashed with the northern cultivators once or twice before. While he hadn't suffered any major losses, fighting empty-handed was incredibly frustrating. Now that he was about to face even more intense combat, having a proper weapon was essential.

Li Ximing quietly explained the situation with Qize. Li Zhouwei simply said, "A year or so is enough time for you to travel to the Eastern Sea, handle your affairs, and return to cultivate. Besides, your methods are far more advanced than before. Even if something happens on the mainland, you'll be able to sense it from a thousand li away."

Seeing Li Ximing's thoughtful expression, Li Zhouwei added in a low voice, "Our family possesses the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, which is far more miraculous than any ordinary grotto-heaven. No matter where you are, as long as it's safe, you can ascend to it. If something happens on the mainland, and I get a moment to breathe, I can crush a jade talisman to alert you. You can then enter the Heaven, and we can meet and discuss matters in detail, even if we are a thousand li apart."

They couldn't send messages across such a distance, but the grotto-heaven provided a clever solution. Li Ximing smiled.

"That's an excellent idea! For this next year and a half, if you are in seclusion within the Heaven, it won't matter if I'm far off in the Barbarian Lands or all the way in Wu State. I can just fly into the grotto-heaven, and I'll be right by your side, ready to discuss things instantly."

"Exactly." Li Zhouwei smiled, but added with a touch of regret, "Unfortunately, I am being watched. I can't enter the Heaven as freely as you can, grand-uncle. I'll only be able to use the excuse of 'seclusion' to cultivate for a while when Ning Wan and the others arrive to take my post... If the North stirs up trouble, I may not even get that peace."

"For now, the Qi Lanyan contingent is focused on Shanji. Things should remain quiet for a while."

Li Ximing offered a word of comfort, then his expression grew serious. "Since we have the Radiant Qilin Refining Art, why don't you first take the Neck Feathers to Golden Feather and exchange them for the spirit flowers? When I return from the Feather Transformation Pool, I'll start the furnace immediately! What good will relying on just one or two spirit pills from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition do?

"This is no time to be stingy with resources. We need to refine that Immortal Foundation as soon as possible. Use the Azure Talisman, and have you achieve the Body Divine Ability. That is what matters."

Li Ximing had a point. The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition had limited stock; they would only give one or two pills, and it would incur a debt of gratitude. But with Li Ximing's current alchemy skill, if he were to refine Bright Yang medicinal pills, who knew how many he could produce in a single batch!

Regarding the Azure Talisman, however, Li Zhouwei had other ideas. He said nothing, but thought to himself:

'No matter how the situation develops, to achieve my goals, I need as many variables on my side as possible. The Azure Talisman is a variable that no one can divine. Once I use it, that advantage is wasted. I'd rather take a few more pills than expend it. I'll keep it hidden in my Shengyang Acupoint... at a critical moment, it will be of great use!'
