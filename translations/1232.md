# Chapter 1232: Forced by Hate

Yuyang Prefecture.

Although the lands of Yuyang were remote, its earth veins were exceptionally potent; to the west, the mountains of Tongmo Prefecture formed a solid barrier against the desert sands, and with its abundant water veins, it was truly an excellent place for cultivating water-aspect arts.

Yet the excessively flat terrain also presented an inherent weakness, much like the Mushroom Forest Plains, offering no natural defenses to hold; the Sima Family's mountain gate was the only immortal mountain nearby, and even after generations of the Chen Clan had dredged the water veins, they had only just managed to compensate for the deficiencies in the earth veins, making the land barely usable.

High platforms towered over this vast plain, their grand halls mostly roofed with blue-black tiles interspersed with the color of white jade, and upon the main seat, an old man with drooping eyelids held a cup of tea in silence.

The middle-aged man standing within the hall, meanwhile, appeared unremarkable—dark, lean, and tall, with a loyal and honest expression on his face, the light of True Qi flickering unstably around his body—this was none other than the Chen Clan's Holder of the Profound, Chen Wenyao.

Chen Yin had placed him by Li Jianglong's side early on, allowing him to claim some small merit in backing the winning dragon; later, through extensive networking and his own considerable skill, he ultimately entered the Purple and Gold Palace even earlier than Sima Xun would.

His bearing now carried a palpable authority, yet upon entering the grand hall, he remained utterly respectful to his clan's old Daoist Master, bowing before the honored elder and asking with concern,

"Your Grace's injuries…"

"It is nothing."

A hint of gratification finally appeared in Chen Yin's perpetually somber eyes as he looked at him; setting down his cup, he coughed twice and said,

"This secret art from Daoist Master Xiao draws its concept from the Mansion Water losing its vastness, greatly diminishing yet never running dry; I have not yet reached the point where my lifespan is ending and I cannot move, so it is difficult to circulate without sustaining some injury…"

A complex look entered Chen Wenyao's eyes as he nodded silently and said,

"With Daoist Master Xiao providing such aid, our family does not know how to repay him; as for spiritual resources and spiritual items, he surely has no lack of them…"

"Repay?"

Chen Yin smiled, his aged eyes as still as an old well, and said,

"There is no such thing as a free benefit in this world. Did I abandon Yuyang to save Moongaze Lake for a few spiritual resources and spiritual items? The Xiao Clan operates on the same principle; when such people appear to want nothing from you, it must be because what they truly desire cannot be known to others. Perhaps… what they want is my life."

Chen Wenyao's expression shifted slightly as he said urgently,

"Your Grace, why would you say such a thing!"

Chen Yin shook his head and said,

"What is so surprising about it? A cultivator in the Purple Mansion Realm is a treasure from head to toe. While their lifespan is long, they gather spiritual resources, refine pills and artifacts, and achieve a lifetime of skills; when they are about to perish, whether by offering up a spiritual item or fighting to the death for someone, they can provide a mouthful of blood for their family. The Dharma Body itself is a treasure. Changxi… set a fine example for me."

This statement silenced Chen Wenyao; his expression was complicated, and he remained speechless for a long time before Chen Yin said,

"It's just a pity… I am truly too old. I have no brothers or children still living, so I cannot even use that great method the Xiao family obtained for seizing and continuing one's path. Having failed the first time, the way forward is now blocked, leaving me to only waste away time and again."

Chen Wenyao found it even harder to speak. He raised his brows, watching the old man sit fixedly on the main seat, his expression sinister and completely different from the one in his memory. But he understood; this old Daoist Master was desperately and anxiously waiting to cross into the Purple Mystery, and Chen Wenyao could discern his thoughts:

'His Grace truly doesn't care about anything anymore. He even… even feels that the Xiao family's secret art is too good, too precious, too clean, and has side effects that are too light, such that he cannot rush through the Purple Mystery…'

And still he feels it is not enough! He wants to be faster—what path could possibly be faster? If killing one person is not enough, should he try a hundred? If a hundred is not enough, then he will kill a thousand, or even ten thousand, a hundred thousand…

'The Martial Cultivation Star shines brightly, but it is no Thunder Palace, and still less a Wanling; it is merely a projection of a bygone might, as easily pierced as a thin veil meant to conceal the truth. Success has become a garishly painted artifice. Even a butcher of ten thousand like Situ Huo can become a general; if a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator truly wanted to take a shortcut, there are a thousand ways to do so overseas!'

The old man's kindness to him was as weighty as a mountain, and he was acting for the clan's safety, so Chen Wenyao could only try to persuade him,

"There is still time… in ten or twenty years, there is great potential for a turnaround!"

Chen Yin fell silent, his gaze lowered. Just then, he saw a cultivator approach to pay respects, who hastily knelt before him and said,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, a message has arrived from the Second Young Master!"

At these words, Chen Wenyao's expression changed, and Chen Yin stood up straight away, his face grim as he ordered,

"Present it!"

The man immediately presented the letter in his hands. The old man glanced at it, and a long-absent look of joy finally rose in his eyes as he laughed heartily and said,

"Good! The boy has brought us honor!"

Chen Wenyao quickly took it to read. As he saw Chen Yin begin to pace around the hall with light steps and a long sigh, Chen Wenyao read the letter—it was about a marriage between the two families—and immediately exclaimed with delight,

"It seems Your Grace's reckless venture to the lake was not in vain!"

"Haha!"

Chen Yin let out a great laugh, shaking his head and saying,

"This is not entirely my achievement. That Daoist Master Changli is no easy character to deal with; he would never agree so readily. It was Yuanzhuo who performed well and earned their favor!"

Chen Wenyao was also thrilled, nodding repeatedly and sighing,

"This is wonderful!"

After laughing, the old Daoist Master on the high seat stepped down and said with a serious expression,

"Now that you and Li Jianglong are joined by marriage, when you see King Wei, you can also address him as 'uncle' based on your new family ties!"

Chen Wenyao had never experienced such a thing and hesitated slightly, saying,

"Wouldn't that be too sycophantic?"

"Sycophantic?"

Chen Yin's eyes widened as he said,

"Who would dare say a word! Li Zhouwei only has a few direct descendants; after three generations, the relationship is no longer so close, and they only intermarry with a few families. There are plenty of people who wish they could call him that but don't have the right!"

Chen Wenyao quickly cupped his hands, still feeling somewhat awkward. He changed the subject, saying seriously,

"We still need to prepare a betrothal gift…"

"Of course!"

A shrewd glint flashed in Chen Yin's old eyes as he said,

"We must make this wedding a grand affair and send a lavish gift back to the Li Clan, so that all of Jiangnan can see… only then can you have a bit more composure in the great battle to come!"

Chen Wenyao said,

"Spiritual resources… I have a portion on hand… As for the rest…"

The old man's expression did not change as he said,

"Leave it to me… Give me that [Secret Art of the Submerged Dragon's Metamorphosis]."

At these words, Chen Wenyao's expression changed slightly. He reached into his sleeve, took out a light green, jade-like slip from his robes, and placed it between his palms, saying softly,

"This junior has already studied it and committed it to memory."

Chen Yin gave the jade slip in his palm a heavy look and said,

"I will personally make a trip to the lake and present it to the Li family as a betrothal gift."

Chen Wenyao had not expected him to actually have such an idea and, feeling deeply uneasy, tried to dissuade him in a low voice,

"I understand that Your Grace values the sentiment of the Xiao family raising the Li Clan from obscurity, but I'm afraid this is improper… This item was a personal gift from Daoist Master Xiao and is extremely important; it could be considered the Dao-attainment secret art of another's lineage. For him to have given it to us was already incredibly generous—how can we pass it on to another? The Li Clan does not cultivate water-aspect arts, so it will be of little use in their hands… Why bother…"

Chen Yin's expression remained unchanged as he said flatly,

"It is precisely because this came from the Xiao family."

The old Daoist Master began to pace,

"Xiao Chuting is exceedingly calculating. If this item did not have a purpose, why would he have given the original to me? He even specifically said I could dispose of it as I saw fit. Rather than a jade slip, it is more like a pledge of allegiance, to be delivered into the hands of the Li Clan to make one point clear."

"That Chen Yin is indeed cooperating with the Xiao Clan."

Chen Wenyao's brows furrowed deeply as he said,

"This slip alone."

"It's enough."

Chen Yin clasped his hands behind his back, turned his head, and said,

"For one, that Daoist Master Changli is extremely perceptive; as soon as he sees the various coordinated elements within, especially the secret arts of the Vast Ocean, he is bound to become suspicious. For another… don't you forget where Zhaojing cultivated in his early years, and who his master was… how could he not recognize the Xiao family's secret arts!"

The look in his eyes was indifferent,

"Even if he were to intervene and save me on account of… the fact that I will be working for Xiao Chuting in the future, it would be a good outcome."

Chen Wenyao was moved for a moment. After pondering for a long time, he finally sighed and said,

"This junior is afraid that… Daoist Master Xiao's ambitions are too great. With our Chen Clan caught between two families, I fear… there is a risk of being dragged down with them!"

The middle-aged man seemed to have other thoughts. Seeing that his Daoist Master did not answer him, his gaze grew complex and his eyes glistened as he said in a low voice,

"Since I was young, I have known that my family walks a grand and righteous path. Though we are not some earth-shattering sect, we are a reputable power known throughout Jiangnan. Even when we must maneuver between the various great families, we have always stood firm…"

He seemed to have a heart full of sorrowful matters, saying mournfully,

"Back then, when Xiao Chuting rapidly mastered two divine abilities, Your Grace even told my uncle… you guessed that he had most likely used a forbidden method and lamented it greatly. My branch of the family has some friendship with the Xiao family; Xiao Chuwu was an ancestor's benefactor, and Xiao Chuchou was an ancestor's dear friend. We also recognize his 'Long Cloud's Gloom'. My father told me in private that he only hated that the Heavenly Dao did not flourish, that such spell arts could become widespread in the world without any retribution. He said: 'If it truly requires the blood of one's own kin to reduce the obstacles to seeking the Dao, then it is better not to seek this Dao at all.'"

The color in Chen Yin's pupils gradually began to shift as he coldly watched his junior, understanding that the man was subtly trying to dissuade him. But Chen Wenyao continued in a hoarse voice,

"Furthermore… Bright Yang… is not an unsinkable ship… This junior is now a Holder of the Profound, so the clan does not face the danger of annihilation. Why must we cling to them so desperately… When something happens, how are we to fend for ourselves!"

"Too late!"

Chen Yin, however, remained completely unmoved, sneering as he said,

"Ever since Xuanyu died and I accepted that pill from the Xiao family, our family has had no path of retreat—did you think I couldn't see the risks in the Li Clan's glory? If Xuanyu had not died, I could still have learned from Sima Yuanli, keeping them half-close and half-distant, but he is gone. Who is there to bear the great burden!"

"The great feud between the Sun Clan and my family has gone on for too long. Ever since their family gained the Qing Clan's favor, they have flourished day by day, producing talent after talent. That Danyin has also passed into the Purple Mystery, and his 'Gathering Wood' art can devour water; once a great conflict erupts between Shu and Song, if I have not reached the realm of a Great Daoist Master, I will surely be killed by him!"

"I have heard of the feud with the Sun Clan since I was young, and now I must continue to hear of it until I die of old age. Perhaps it will last even longer than the days of Shu and Song standing together… Western Shu will be destroyed, but since Sun Miaoqing became Qing Zhuo's concubine and Song Yunbai's master, the Sun Clan cannot fall!"

"When that time comes, even if I escape one calamity, my demise will only be a matter of time. Once the dust settles and the Emperor ascends the throne… our great families will be nothing but a basket of rotten fish and stinking shrimp, not even comparable to the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition… Who will be left to shelter us!"

Hate and fear intertwined in his eyes as he stood up, pushed open the doors, and pointed at the towering, ornate pavilions outside, his voice cold with an anger that seemed to stem from bitter disappointment,

"You people will die a death more wretched than an ant's! How dare you even think to question whether Bright Yang is a good ship!"

"But if you don't board this ship, your entire family will drown tomorrow—only you! Only you, as a Holder of the Profound, have some use. You can eke out a meager existence, barely able to poke your head above the water to breathe, but for them, having you is enough!"

Chen Wenyao was stunned into place by this barrage of questions, his pupils dilated. The old man's expression was glacial,

"Did you think I spent my whole life abiding by the rules and upholding righteous cultivation only to, in my twilight years… drag my old face around everywhere? To cast aside even the reputation built by my ancestors! Why?!"

The veins on the old Daoist Master's face were prominent, his features contorted with an unprecedented hatred and anger as he said through gritted teeth,

"Without the Xiao family, without a shortcut, I cannot cross into the Purple Mystery!"

Chen Wenyao had only known that this old man had single-handedly pushed him into his current position, but he had never imagined the other had such long-term plans; as if struck by lightning, he stood there, suffocated, unable to react for a long time.

"Cough, cough… cough…"

Chen Yin began to cough violently, then took a ragged breath and said,

"I understand your concerns. Whether King Wei can succeed is ultimately an unknown. For now, we will not concern ourselves with matters at that level; they have offended so many people, there are bound to be complications in the end…"

"Even if their entire clan faces a catastrophe, we can pick out a batch of those close to them, bear the pain, and deal with them… at most, one branch of the family will perish! Isn't that how it's always been done? But I have never heard of anyone being purged merely for a marriage alliance. If such a thing were to truly happen, then be it the Sima Family or the Xiao Clan, no one could escape… Why would we need to worry so much about it?"

"Yes…"

Chen Wenyao remained silent for a long time, his eyes slightly red. He answered in a low, dispirited voice, and offered the jade slip to the old man, murmuring,

"It was this junior who was shortsighted…"

Chen Yin waved his hand wearily, gesturing for him to leave. The old man sat alone in the empty hall, his eyes equally unsettled and filled with a deep sense of crisis.

He stared so intently at his teacup that it was as if he could see the vast snow that once filled the sky over the Northern Sea, and the old man who sat in that snow, stubbornly holding a fishing rod.

'Xiao Chuting… your path… can it truly be walked… Is this to have me killed before the great event, to eliminate a competitor in the struggle for Lingyu Gate's legacy, or do you genuinely intend to help me overcome this trial…'

'If you were truly acting out of consideration for our past friendship, you should also fear that I might be forced by the general situation to betray you and side with the Golden Feather… Why are you not the least bit wary of me…'

His gaze was obscure and utterly bleak,

'Now… the Golden Feather and the Li Clan must have reached a compromise over the 'Whole Pill'; it's even possible the Li Clan has received a favor from Golden Oneness. Under such calculations, where do you get the confidence… that Li Zhouwei and I… will still be able to help you then?'

In the end, he could not see through the schemes of that old man on the Northern Sea. He could only stand alone with his hands clasped behind his back, finally letting out a long sigh after a long while,

'So be it… so be it… First, I will give the Li Clan a hint or two. With the marriage alliance in place, even if we must oppose Golden Oneness, it will be Li Zhouwei standing at the forefront. No matter what, the situation will not become too unbearable!'
