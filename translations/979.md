# Chapter 979: Imperial Scion

Rumble!

The storm in the sky intensified. Li Zhouwei's movement seemed random, but his target was clear. His hand, wreathed in roiling Heavenly Light, abruptly closed, yet his divine ability gently shielded the spiritual object within. His other hand shot up, sliding along the halberd's shaft, and with a deft twist, brought the weapon up into a block.

He brought the halberd in his left hand back, slashing diagonally across the sky to block his right flank. A sharp clang rang out as it parried a silver dagger that struck like a venomous wasp. The keen white blade, caught on the halberd's crescent-moon guard, hissed with billowing green smoke.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes swept the scene. Just as he'd expected—it was Zong Chang.

The woman's robes billowed, revealing glimpses of her form—one moment, fair and beautiful flesh, the next, a white-boned skeleton. As the turbulent divine ability washed over her, a pair of lilac-hued breasts could be seen swaying beneath her garments. She held one hand protectively in front of her, already clutching a gleaming white, newly acquired Jade True spiritual object.

From this single exchange, Li Zhouwei already had a clear assessment:

'The Veiled Yin dao's movement and traversal speed must be superior to Bright Yang. In fact, it's easily one of the fastest among all daos... I just secured the spiritual object, and she already managed to snatch an item and launch another attack on me!'

Although the downpour of Pristine Water obscured his vision, Li Zhouwei could sense that all the various treasures were being fiercely contested. His heart turned cold.

'What a Veiled Yin cultivator. She'd rather ignore the other treasures just to come and harass me!'

The instant the thought formed, the halberd in his hand flipped, erupting with blazing golden light. Zong Chang merely smiled. Her eyes, brimming with a wicked aura, strained in unison and then popped from their sockets, transforming into two ghostly shadows.

An intense Veiled Yin aura pulsed outward. Li Zhouwei felt the surrounding rain and cacophony instantly fade away. A vast darkness spread beneath his feet, and from within that gloom, a pale light emerged, revealing countless hands.

The hands were icy and silent. In unison, they raised their index fingers, the other four fingers pressed to their palms, pointing directly at him. Thousands upon thousands, densely packed, they surged from above, below, and all sides, unleashing a Veiled Yin radiance that washed over him, bringing with it a wave of profound fatigue.

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes. He reversed his grip on the halberd with one hand and formed a two-fingered sword sign before his chest with the other, pointing skyward. Between his brows, the eclipse sigil—a white ring around a black core—reappeared!

Emperor Qi's Light!

Myriad streams of light, golden-fronted and black-tailed, erupted from between his brows. Each possessed a sharp spiritual awareness. In an instant, they blanketed the dark dimension, then scattered down like rain to meet every single pointing finger.

Boom! A roiling storm of power exploded. The two forces clashed relentlessly, one wave after another, triggering a cascade of detonations. Zong Chang's divine ability and dharma power were greater, causing the Veiled Yin light to mass ever more densely. But Li Zhouwei's Emperor Qi's Light was of a higher quality, even carrying traces of Supreme Yang power. It devoured all the surging radiance that rushed toward it.

Bright Yang and Veiled Yin clashed endlessly in the boundless darkness until, with a final, deafening roar, the illusion shattered. The vast, green rain reappeared, and the sound of colliding divine abilities once again filled his ears. A thin, dark sheet of Valley Water drifted down from an unknown source. Li Zhouwei looked up. The eclipse sigil between his brows, though slightly dimmed, was still erupting, its power sweeping toward the now pale-faced Zong Chang!

The woman's expression flickered, her eyes filled with faint astonishment.

'Bright Yang Inversion... he's using the Yang Cusp Wandering Light to counter my Yin Exhaustion Myriad Arrows Art... A fine response. But of course. He wants to replace the World-Guarding Imperial Monarch; how could he not be proficient in the Bright Yang Inversion arts? And how could those arts possibly be weak!'

'I miscalculated!'

In that instant, the dense barrage of Emperor Qi's Light was upon her. Zong Chang couldn't spare a moment to pacify the roiling divine ability within her. Her delicate body went limp, transforming into a wisp of white wind, swaying amidst the streams of light. Before she could fully withdraw, she realized her opponent was already charging in for the kill!

Zong Chang forcibly suppressed the urge to raise her sleeve and unleash the Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light. Her mind was perfectly clear:

'The Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light is an art of illusion. The Bright Yang path's specialty is charging headlong into peril to shatter all doubt. I absolutely cannot be careless!'

The Veiled Yin path was the mortal enemy of Bright Yang, their histories entangled in endless conflict. But under Li Qianyuan, Bright Yang had risen to a position of supreme authority, causing the Veiled Yin path to be hunted to near-extinction. When Bright Yang later shattered and Veiled Yin re-emerged, nearly every Veiled Yin Dao Lineage felt a bone-deep chill of lingering fear. In the years since the Bright Yang diaspora, the Veiled Yin Dao Lineages had been studying it relentlessly from the shadows. A single Veiled Yin Dao Lineage might not grasp the full spectrum of Veiled Yin transformations, but it would absolutely know how to counter Bright Yang!

Her Dao Lineage, Zong Chang's, and Wei Xuanyin's Dao Lineage—both understood Bright Yang!

Instead of retreating, she advanced, bracing herself against the oncoming streams of light as she thrust her silver dagger forward. The resulting collision sent a sickening flush of green and white across her face, but it successfully halted her opponent's charge. Only then did a light finally begin to glow from within her sleeve.

Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light!

Li Zhouwei's brow furrowed. He knew his opponent must have a deep understanding of his dao. He thrust the halberd forward as his eyes blazed with golden light. High above, iridescent clouds and Heavenly Light converged. His 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' divine ability instantly bore down!

The roiling powers of Bright Yang and Veiled Yin rushed together. The resulting explosion should have been world-shaking, but at the very instant of impact, Zong Chang's eyes flew wide. Li Zhouwei also turned his head, a flicker of surprise on his face.

Every sound within the churning Pristine Water abruptly ceased. All the cultivators nearby looked up as one. A piercing shriek filled their ears as a brilliant white radiance surged from the ground, punching a hole straight through the heavens. It split the rain clouds, forcing them to part.

The white light that filled the sky flashed for a blinding instant. Even Yehui, standing off to the side, turned to look. A single thought flashed through everyone's mind:

'Sword Intent!'

Though everyone's attention was captured, the clashing divine abilities in the sky didn't pause for even a fraction of a second. Zong Chang gave a faint smile, and the vast, orderly palace manifested behind her once more.

'Chamber of Doubt'!

The moment this divine ability appeared, Li Zhouwei's halberd, the Grand Ascension, began to seethe, its weight fluctuating wildly. This allowed her two silver daggers to twist free. The woman herself plummeted back into the deep palace, vanishing into the white mist.

Her figure reappeared several miles away, leaving only the 'Chamber of Doubt' to face the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate'. The illusory palace spun lightly, its halls shifting and windows contracting, before it dissipated completely.

'So that was her escape plan...'

Li Zhouwei retrieved his Grand Ascension, his gaze sweeping over the weapon with a hint of doubt.

'A divine ability specialized in escaping... It can even influence the weapon in my hand...'

The 'Chamber of Doubt' was, without question, the most effective long-distance escape divine ability he had ever seen, and with a minimal cost. As it was a 'Veiled Yin' art, his 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' had great difficulty in suppressing it.

She had clearly only come to probe his strength. Not wanting to waste any more time, Li Zhouwei swept his gaze aside and spotted a man with a sword standing not far away.

The man was eight feet tall and simply dressed, his attire resembling that of the Shu region. His face was surprisingly young, long, and with broad eyebrows. His eyes weren't large, but they were exceptionally calm as they swept across the low-hanging rain clouds.

Clang!

He sheathed his sword. Roiling golden energy circled him. Though he only looked to have just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, his aura was incredibly potent. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator he'd been fighting had taken a blow from his sword and fled, leaving behind only a small, golden 'Geng Metal' spiritual object, which floated down into his hand.

The sword immortal casually caught the spiritual object and strode away on a path of light.

Li Zhouwei looked away, his mind stirring.

'I wonder which sect that sword immortal belongs to... I'd heard there was a sword immortal of the Supreme Yang Dao in the Northern Sea, and now here's a Metal Virtue sword immortal! This Donghua Heaven is truly alluring. All these figures who normally refuse to emerge from their mountain retreats... today, they've all come swarming to this Grotto-Heaven!'

Li Zhouwei had heard of another sword immortal who cultivated in Qize, known as the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal. But that individual had reached the Purple Mansion Realm long ago and was far more powerful. It couldn't be this man...

His thoughts flickered and were gone. He tore through the rain, speeding toward the nearest battle. Halberd held bright, he raised an eyebrow and took in the scene.

The area was a swirl of chaos, with five or six cultivators entangled in battle. A very old-looking Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was trapped mid-air, flanked by two Merciful Ones. He gritted his teeth, his divine ability strained to its limit, clearly struggling under the pincer attack.

Most of the Merciful Ones who could enter this place were followers of the Lotus Temple. These veterans knew various Dharma Arts, possessed Treasured Artifacts, and had tough, durable Dharma Bodies. An ordinary early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would be hard-pressed to deal with them. Three in formation would be a headache even for a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert. Although the old man had perfected a divine ability, he was still overwhelmed by the assault from two.

But Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flashed. He saw another Merciful One speeding toward them, clearly a compatriot of the first two. The newcomer's face was lit with joy, and at his waist hung a jade ring that pulsed with the unmistakable aura of an Immortal Dao artifact!

Li Zhouwei was already streaking toward them. Seeing this, he showed no mercy. He dove from the sky, his halberd a blur, crashing down like a golden comet. With a resounding clang, he smashed into a halo of light.

Boom! The halo shattered, and a Merciful One tumbled out from the blinding light. His face was a ghastly purple-green, like a vengeful spirit. His expression changed, a deep chill seizing him. He scrambled to look up, only to be met by the sight of a gleaming halberd point stabbing directly at his face!

"Not good!"

The man's reaction was lightning-fast. His body swelled like a balloon. He opened his mouth wide and spat out a jet of golden light. Instantly, five-colored radiance flared, lotus flowers bloomed, and the tinkling of crystal chimes filled the air. But the Grand Ascension didn't slow in the slightest, roaring as it smashed down!

The golden light the Merciful One had spat out was shattered like glass by the massive halberd. It only managed to slow the Grand Ascension for a fraction of a second. The halberd's 'Attachment' ability manifested, creating a phantom double. The real and phantom halberds struck the purple-faced Merciful One from front and back simultaneously.

Pitiable wretch. Caught off guard, the lotus divine ability he had just started to circulate was blocked by the 'Attachment' phantom. The true Grand Ascension smashed into him a moment later. He let out a wretched cry. His forward momentum instantly ceased, and he was blasted backward even faster than he had arrived, crashing into the ruins with a thunderous boom that sent up a waterfall of spray.

Splash... Li Zhouwei had already spun his halberd, resting it against his back. He formed a two-fingered sign at his chest, and as the sigil between his brows flashed, he decisively unleashed Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

The purple-faced Merciful One was reeling from the blow. Heavenly Light raged inside him, and violet flames licked across his skin. Dazed, a grievous, cracking wound already spreading across his chest, he had only just pushed himself upright when the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light descended...

Boom! A massive column of water exploded upward. But the light from Li Zhouwei's brow did not pause. It transformed into a golden beam that lanced across the heavens, exceptionally bright in the storm, its color intensifying with every passing moment.

One misstep had led to a cascade of errors. He was pinned to the ground by the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, unable to move, relying solely on his tough Dharma Body to barely resist. As he felt the divine ability's power escalating, he cried out in despair:

"Quick, save me!"

This cry made the two Merciful Ones attacking the Purple Mansion Realm expert falter. The old man, however, was overjoyed. He peered at the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light lancing through the rainy night, found the divine ability's aura familiar, and deliberately shouted:

"Is that Daoist Friend Zhaojing?! This humble one is Yan Dushui. I implore you to save me!"

"Yan Dushui?"

Suspended in the air, Li Zhouwei didn't answer. Instead, he abruptly looked up. His halberd, which had been gathering power, flicked upward as if to parry, plucking a golden pearl from thin air.

The pearl was no larger than a thumb, but it struck with immense force, causing Li Zhouwei to shudder and interrupting his Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. A flash of surprise crossed his eyes.

"Not bad."

He was only mildly surprised, but the purple-faced Merciful One below was scared witless. While that pearl wasn't his life-mandate bonded Treasured Artifact, he had still spent decades refining it as a backup, even infusing it with 'Wandering Metal', a spiritual resource that aided concealment. It was designed for powerful sneak attacks. How could it be parried so easily!

'Back when Helian Wujiang fought Chiluo, it must have been just like this!'

But what truly made his eyes burn with fury was that the golden-eyed man in the sky manifested a brilliant Celestial Gate behind him. With a flex of his arms and a flick of his halberd, he suppressed his Treasured Artifact, the 'Xiao Xu Pearl', beneath the divine ability!

'That disgusting suppression divine ability!'

Li Zhouwei didn't stand on ceremony. The pearl was clearly made of fine materials. Even if he couldn't trade it, he could try to dismantle it later and extract the resources. That would be excellent. When Suiguan had attacked and Taixi fled, the golden ring used to bind his weapon had also ended up in Li Zhouwei's possession. Both items would have their use.

Having casually suppressed the man's Treasured Artifact, he had no intention of letting him go. He executed 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' and rode the light to charge down!

Knowing his opponent was too strong, the purple-faced Merciful One already wanted to retreat. He had no desire to be injured. Gritting his teeth, his divine ability surged:

"If you two don't come now... I'm not holding on to this treasure!"

That shout was finally effective. The other two Merciful Ones assessed the situation. They weren't going to take down Yan Dushui anytime soon and might end up losing everything. They exchanged a look and shot over to help.

But now it was Yan Dushui's turn to sneer. His own vast divine ability erupted, attempting to pin both of them down!

The purple-faced Merciful One couldn't spare a thought for the other battle. He wasn't Zong Chang, with her deep Dao-Profundity! He didn't have her counters! This golden-eyed fiend had already passed through the obstructing golden winds and glazed light he'd spat out as if they were water, and was now right in his face!

With utmost reluctance, he could only summon his life-mandate bonded lotus throne, unleashing a boundless radiance to defend himself. But the thick golden light brought him no sense of security. The eclipse sigil between his opponent's brows was already flaring, making his every hair stand on end.

'This Grotto-Heaven is suppressed by a Dharma Treasure; I can't even connect to the Buddhist Land! How can I possibly fight him!'

'Forget it! I don't want it!'

With lightning speed, he unhooked the jade ring and threw it straight at Li Zhouwei's halberd. Glowing sigils erupted across his skin as he burned all of his Dharma Body power as fuel for an escape art, using that single instant to leap away.

"You want it? Then take it!"

Li Zhouwei's seemingly unstoppable halberd flicked delicately, hooking the jade ring. He didn't even glance at it. His eyes were fixed on the fleeing streak of light. From between his brows, thousands upon thousands of golden-black streams of Emperor Qi's Light erupted in pursuit!

Emperor Qi's Light was nothing like the cumbersome Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

Thousands of golden-black streams of light gave chase, accelerating until they finally struck their target in the far distance. A silent explosion blossomed. The streak of light tumbled from the sky like a broken-winged bird, trailing smoke as it fell. Only then did Li Zhouwei look away.

The two Merciful Ones attacking Yan Dushui, seeing the tide turn, had long since fled, abandoning their target. The old Daoist Master flew over, his pupils filled with terror, seemingly at a loss for words.

The scale-like, golden profound patterns on the victor's face were slowly fading, but they couldn't conceal the ferocious aura of battle clinging to him. His dark golden eyes swept over, startling the old man so badly he almost fell out of the air.

"A mistake, a mistake! I mistook you for someone else... no relation! Daoist friend... my apologies, my apologies!"

'Mistaken identity?'

Li Zhouwei was noncommittal. The old Daoist Master was cunning; he'd only shouted that name to scare off the two Merciful Ones. He likely still had other treasures on him. Now, under Li Zhouwei's gaze, he grew wary once more.

Li Zhouwei glanced at him and said indifferently,

"My grand-uncle has mentioned you, Senior. So it's not quite 'no relation'."

"Oh!"

Yan Dushui was both embarrassed and delighted. Clearly, the White Qilin's reputation was great, and he'd recognized Li Zhouwei's lineage earlier. He seemed genuinely surprised that Li Zhouwei knew of him. The old man's eyes, which looked quite profound, darted about as his mind clearly raced. He said hurriedly,

"'Good... good! Our two families were once acquainted! This Grotto-Heaven is fraught with danger... why don't you allow me to assist you, Daoist friend...'"

He made it sound pleasant, but he just wanted to ride Li Zhouwei's coattails.

Li Zhouwei wasn't interested. He possessed the 'Spirit Probe' ability, allowing him to avoid disaster and seek fortune. Traveling alone, he could go wherever he pleased. If someone tagged along, all his erratic movements would arouse suspicion, and he'd have to invent excuses, to say nothing of splitting his gains.

Besides, he didn't trust this old man. He smiled faintly and replied,

"'I wouldn't want to burden you, Senior. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Shilou family is looking to challenge me later. It would be terrible if you were injured in the crossfire.'"

Yan Dushui had wanted to leech off his good fortune but was also afraid of being caught up in his karmic entanglements. He had been worried, and Li Zhouwei's words gave him the perfect excuse. He quickly seized the opening, sighing dramatically and offering a few more apologies before hurriedly retreating.

Li Zhouwei, having heard his name before, treated the encounter as a minor interlude. Since it concerned his grand-uncle, he didn't dwell on it. Without even inspecting his new treasure, his 'Spirit Probe' swept the battlefield, and the situation became clear.

"'That's about it... This place has been picked clean.'"

Although the Pristine Water and Clear Dusk Rain continued to fall, the sounds of battle had clearly subsided. This place was dangerous, and everyone was conserving their divine abilities. Those who failed to snatch a treasure didn't linger, moving on to other locations. Those who had succeeded were long gone.

Thus, he rode a beam of light and swiftly departed. As he flew, he flipped his hand over, revealing the jade ring.

This was the treasure he had just seized. It was palm-sized, composed of two concentric rings. It shimmered with a smoky, crimson-infused light, its color so captivating one couldn't bear to put it down. Li Zhouwei weighed it gently, and after a quick scan with his spiritual sense, he understood its nature.

He possessed a 'Jade Smoke Mountain' artifact, which was made of 'Highbright Profound Jade'. The Aged Courtly Path Sutra mentioned that if 'Highbright Profound Jade' was soaked in Water Mansion for a century and refined with a great divine ability, it would nurture a new kind of spiritual jade: one that shimmered with a smoky, crimson-infused light. That was this 'Supreme Goodness Profound Jade'.

The outer ring of the artifact was this 'Supreme Goodness Profound Jade', a spiritual resource on par with the Purple Mansion Realm level. And there was a lot of it—if dismantled, it would yield three to five full portions!

The inner ring was a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual object called 'Cascading Profound White Jade'. It was an excellent item for those on the Jade True path, capable of expelling demons and even reconstructing a Dharma Body. If resonated with using one's divine ability and dharma power, it could even help bring a Jade True divine ability to perfection.

But Li Zhouwei's standards were high. He could see clearly that both the 'Cascading Profound White Jade' and the 'Supreme Goodness Profound Jade' had been fused into this ring shape by someone with immense dharma power. To dismantle it for its raw materials would be a criminal waste.

'The original owner of this ring, ten to one, intended to refine it into a Spiritual Artifact. That's why they would expend so much divine ability and dharma power to fuse the two jades and specifically forge them into this shape. It's just that circumstances didn't allow it, and they never finished...'

The ring's value was high. With so many cultivators practicing the Jade True path, this would be a supreme treasure in their eyes. Li Zhouwei put it away, thoroughly satisfied. He sighed inwardly.

'This... this is the legacy of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition. A horde of Daoist Masters descending upon the fallen to carve up the spoils. Every one of them is making out like a bandit, grabbing items worth hundreds of years of cultivation. If the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition were still at its height, just how formidable would it be!'

'Such a colossus... how could it have fallen just like that?'

Li Zhouwei looked away and continued speeding across the land. He found nothing else. The scenery changed, and soon he arrived above a sprawling ruin. Closing his eyes, he sensed a powerful sealing and containment aura, just like the one at Xinhu Palace.

But he was too late. The place was empty, save for one or two damaged Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues wandering aimlessly.

"'Already picked clean...'"

He was beginning to understand. The initial frenzy was over. Now, either a more important location had been discovered and cultivators were working together to open it, or... cultivators were simply fighting each other, unwilling to leave empty-handed.

Rain began to fall again, the torrential Clear Dusk Rain once more descending upon the world. He flew for a time, then his gaze suddenly sharpened. He squinted into the distance.

Through the downpour, pinpricks of bright dharma light flashed, flickering in and out of view. Someone was fighting on the move.

"'What a coincidence.'"

Li Zhouwei cast a cold gaze in that direction and shot forward. After only a breath or two, he adjusted his course, dispersed his aura, and came to a stop in the rain. He held his halberd steady, quietly watching the space ahead.

The Pristine Water churned. A streak of light tore through it.

The approaching cultivator, riding a streak of light wreathed in baleful qi, was moving incredibly fast. He flew right to the spot, his divine abilities gathered. When he suddenly saw Li Zhouwei, he froze. Surprise flickered across his handsome face before it turned to ice.

Despite being caught in a pincer, he remained calm. His hands drifted from his waist, sliding past the hilts of a sword, a saber, and a whip. His voice was deep and low.

"'How may this Daoist friend instruct me?'"

Li Zhouwei casually stretched his arms, a seemingly natural movement that completely blocked the man's path. His halberd pointed diagonally at the ground, letting the rain hiss and evaporate against the Heavenly Light wreathing its blade. He spoke, his tone full of amusement.

"'Didn't you mention to my elder... that you wished to witness the might of an Imperial Scion?'"

He was smiling, but his expression was glacial. The scale-like golden patterns on his face began to glow, and the halberd, which had been pointing at the ground, slowly rose.

"'Minghuang is here.'"
