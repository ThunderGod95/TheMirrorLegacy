# Chapter 512: Battle with Situ Mo

Boom!

The golden formation trembled faintly, shaking the forest and causing leaves to fall like rain. A young man in white lay on the ground, facing the sky.

Boom!

Li Xijun listened silently, confirming that Situ Mo had already engaged in battle with Kongheng and had no time to focus on anything else. Only then did he press his hands against the ground and sit up.

White light flowed through Li Xijun's eyes, but there was no sign of pain. He gathered his mana in his hands and, with a steady motion, grasped the radiant, golden Dinglin Piercer and slowly pulled it out of his chest.

The talisman he received before was the Radiant Snow Pine Ridge, which kept him calm at all times. Though the situation had been dire, and the Dinglin Piercer had struck quickly, Li Xijun had not reacted slowly either.

His eyes, capable of piercing illusions and seeing through falsehoods, allowed him to calculate the trajectory of the Dinglin Piercer quickly. Using the River Crossing Torrential Step, he skillfully dodged its most dangerous points. Although the weapon had pierced through his body, it had not struck a vital area, leaving him with only a wound.

As talisman qi circulated through his body, he pulled the piercer out without flinching and began to wonder, "Even so, this Dinglin Piercer is a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact. It seems really weak... Even if I avoided the vital point, it should have left me seriously wounded. Could it be that Kongheng had intervened...?"

While pondering this, the piercer was fully removed from his body. He wiped away the blood, and examined the weapon. The Dinglin Piercer was about seven chi long, covered in ridges, and shining with golden light. It struggled in Li Xijun's hands, trying to break free and fly into the sky. He had to use considerable effort to just hold onto it.

After sealing the piercer with several Spirit Sealing Techniques, Li Xijun was finally able to free his hands to heal himself. He applied some ointment on the wound, swallowed a pill, and sighed with relief as his strength recovered by sixty percent.

The Dinglin Piercer fluttered weakly in the air before falling to the ground, trembling slightly. Li Xijun's thoughts raced as he pondered to himself, This is trouble... Situ Mo is a direct descendant of the Golden Tang Sect. I am not sure if Kongheng will be able to handle him...

The Quanwu Mountain Range, located in the center of Yue State, was several days' journey from Moongaze Lake, the Xiao Family, or the Profound Peak Gate, making it impossible to call for aid.

Li Xijun turned back to the golden formation, and white light appeared in his eyes. The brilliant light of the formation gradually blurred, revealing the scene within it.

BOOM!

Kongheng was wielding a bronze monk's staff, emitting golden light to resist Situ Mo's dharma artifact. His mana light was soft yet immense, while Situ Mo's was sharp and intense. The clash of their golden lights echoed with thunderous force.

As Li Xijun pushed his talisman qi to the limit, a figure cloaked in the mysterious spirit mist within the formation was also revealed.

"That's... Second Uncle?!" Li Xijun gasped.

The black-robed middle-aged man stood cautiously at the edge of the formation, his face dark. In his hand, a green-white sword light flickered, growing stronger with each passing moment as he waited for a flaw in Situ Mo's defense.

"So, it was him who intervened to protect me!" Li Xijun let out a breath of relief, realizing why the Dinglin Piercer's power had been so weak. He felt more at ease now and confidently began casting layers of spells, keeping the peculiar dharma artifact pinned under his foot.

————

Within the golden formation, Kongheng steadied Li Xuanxuan, showing no signs of panic. As the formation activated, Li Yuanjiao's voice had already reached Kongheng.

Kongheng's surprise stemmed not only from Situ Mo's revelations but also from the unexpected timing of Li Yuanjiao's intervention.

With Li Yuanjiao silently intervening, Kongheng no longer had to worry about Li Xijun. Though the blow Li Xijun suffered seemed severe, Kongheng, with his knowledge as a Buddhist cultivator, did not consider it a serious concern.

As a sharp golden light surged toward him, Kongheng used his monk's staff to repel Situ Mo's attacks, silently reflecting to himself, He's indeed cautious, following us all the way here...

Although Kongheng had some tricks up his sleeve, more than enough for survival but not for killing, he was not afraid of Situ Mo and remained confident that he could protect both himself and Li Xuanxuan.

Yet, he still sighed at Li Yuanjiao's caution, thinking to himself, He was worried about alarming Situ Mo, so he even deceived his own people... Since Senior Xuanxuan hasn't noticed anything, it's even less likely that Situ Mo would suspect a thing!

Situ Mo tested with two attacks, but the monk before him remained as calm as still water, his defense unyielding like an immovable mountain.

Situ Mo sneered and taunted, "Found yourself a bald monk to play guard dog, eh?"

Situ Mo understood that the monk's methods were strange and was careful not to underestimate him. Three golden shields floated around him, covering him completely while he held a saber, watching for an opening. After a moment's thought, he performed a hand seal and muttered, "Come!"

Outside the formation, the Dinglin Piercer began to struggle violently, thrashing on the ground. Li Xijun had long been prepared for this and had covered the weapon with spirit-sealing talismans. He stomped down on it with his foot, brought his fingers together, and released a flash of cold light.

Grade Four spell, Slaughter Jun Kui Light!

True to its reputation as one of the Li Family's highest-graded spells, the white light burst forth, releasing a chilling energy that froze the Dinglin Piercer solid, cutting off the flow of mana and suppressing it completely.

Inside the formation, Situ Mo's expression changed. Li Xijun, only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, should not have been able to resist his dharma artifact, and should have already been killed by the Dinglin Piercer. Now, with the weapon unresponsive, he felt deep unease growing within him, sensing things were slipping out of his control.

Yet, Li Xuanxuan's earlier behavior had seemed completely genuine, and Kongheng's shock had also been real. Situ Mo, who had grown up surviving on his wits, could see through pretense, and now found himself hesitant and unsure.

Meanwhile, Li Xuanxuan, seeing Situ Mo's hesitation, began to piece things together based on Kongheng's demeanor. A hint of relief crossed his face, which only made him look more pleased in Situ Mo's eyes, adding to the latter's irritation.

Situ Mo's eyes flickered suddenly as he made up his mind. He pulled out a talisman from his robe, clasped it between his hands, and began to cast a spell.

Kongheng, naturally, could not just stand by idly. He quickly raised his bronze staff, focusing on protecting Li Xuanxuan from afar by disrupting Situ Mo with bursts of golden light. However, his defensive nature made it hard to break through Situ Mo's golden shields.

Situ Mo cast a mocking glance at Kongheng before shaking his wrist and releasing six streams of light that landed on his own body. The tiny streams glimmered over his acupoints—Zanzhu, Tongziliao, and Chengqi—gradually lighting up his eyes with a golden glow.[1]

In this life-and-death confrontation, Situ Mo was not foolish enough to announce his techniques aloud. However, Li Yuanjiao, who was still observing from the shadows, had read the Spirit Eye Perception manual and recognized these critical eye acupoints. He realized Situ Mo had sensed that something was amiss.

What a shame! His dharma artifact is formidable, and he hasn't shown any openings!

Knowing he could not stay hidden much longer without being discovered, Li Yuanjiao seized this fleeting opportunity. His sword flew out of its sheath as he raced toward Situ Mo, executing the Celestial Moon Slash technique.

Clang!

A sharp green-white light filled the air. Situ Mo's spell was interrupted, yet he seemed more pleased than surprised. The golden saber at his waist, which had been accumulating power, suddenly shot forward as he laughed.

"I knew it!"

Li Yuanjiao's sword arc shifted, shattering Situ Mo's golden shield, but was met by the saber qi he had been gathering for a long time. Internally, Li Yuanjiao couldn't help but admire Situ Mo's slyness.

What a cunning man!

Situ Mo's ability to stop his own spell midway and secretly charge his saber qi showed that he had anticipated Li Yuanjiao's move. It was possible that Situ Mo had never cultivated perception techniques seriously and had only acted to lure out a hidden enemy.

"It really is you, Li Yuanjiao!"

Though Situ Mo had forced Li Yuanjiao to reveal himself, the power of the Celestial Moon Slash technique still exceeded his expectations. His saber qi only managed to block it for a moment before shattering like brittle wood.

1. Acupoint locations: Zanzhu is at the start of the eyebrow, Tongziliao is near the tear duct, and Chengqi is near the outer corner of the eye. ☜

Situ Mo shouted, "Ha!"

Before the words even left his mouth, three golden shields materialized before him while he instantly moved several zhang away, spitting out a small, round red pill. The pill spun once in the air and dissolved into smoke.

"The techniques of the Golden Tang Gate!" Li Yuanjiao sighed as he watched. Situ Mo had not yet had time to feel relief when he felt a cold sensation behind him. A grayish-green serpent dragon materialized, its jaws snapping toward his neck.

Clang!

Li Yuanjiao struck aside the three golden shields, but the serpent dragon was blocked by the light emitted from Situ Mo's dharma robes. Situ Mo quickly formed a hand seal, sending out a burst of golden light that shattered the dragon.

With a venomous tone, he growled, "Some Celestial Moon Slash technique... hardly impressive!"

But before he could even finish speaking, three more streams of silver light darted toward him, gleaming brilliantly like the moon. They spun and danced in the air, weaving through the gaps between his three golden shields, aiming for his upper, middle, and lower body.

Situ Mo was startled, and golden patterns appeared on his hands as he tried to grab the incoming light, but his grasp closed on nothing but air.

The three sword lights moved too swiftly, slipping between his defenses like snakes slithering inside his robes. Unable to cast another spell in time, Situ Mo could do nothing as the sword lights struck his body.

His golden robe once again emitted light, releasing a surge of white mist that dissolved the three sword lights that were aimed at him, forcing Li Yuanjiao to withdraw his attack in vain.

Situ Mo let out a sigh of relief, now drenched in sweat, and spat sarcastically, "Well... well... quite the sword technique!"

At the same time, deep green serpent dragons rose beneath Li Yuanjiao's feet while sword qi churned in his hands. Inwardly, he felt helpless.

I'm afraid I won't be able to take him down... My mastery of the Threefold Moonlight is lacking...agile but not powerful enough. What a pity.

Situ Mo stepped forward, his hand performing seals as he cautiously engaged Li Yuanjiao in back-and-forth attacks. Sword qi and saber qi clashed, producing resounding explosions.

Kongheng, not skilled in offensive techniques, stood nearby, his monk's staff emitting golden light within a one-zhang radius around him. Though he used the golden light to strike at Situ Mo, it merely distracted him for a moment, failing to cause any real harm.

The Golden Tang Gate has been in Xu State for years, once a major power that frequently clashed with Azure Pond... Even though they've declined, their foundation runs deep and they're hard to deal with.

Kongheng knew it wasn't just the Golden Tang Gate—even Situ Mo himself was no easy opponent.

Li Yuanjiao had missed his chance for an overwhelming strike, and with his most powerful sword technique already used, he found himself unable to gain the upper hand.

Sure enough, Situ Mo scattered two of Li Yuanjiao's sword qi with a wave of his hand and sneered.

"Is that all your family's swordsmanship has to offer? You were lucky enough to have a sword immortal as an ancestor, which barely elevated your family to a prestigious clan... You are nothing but a bunch of opportunists."

While mocking him, Situ Mo's hands did not slow down. He raised his Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact to fend off Li Yuanjiao, rapidly forming six seals in succession. Finally, he clasped his hands together, his ring finger hooking over the middle finger while his index fingers crossed, leaving the other three fingers pressed together.

With a loud bang, golden light burst from Situ Mo's palm, forming a small dagger about the size of a finger that darted into the air, circling once before streaking toward Li Yuanjiao with the speed and force of lightning, shrieking as it cut through the air.

Situ Mo knew all about the Li Family, but Li Yuanjiao knew little about him. Feeling an intense sense of danger, Li Yuanjiao's back went cold. Quickly, he slapped his pouch and summoned a large brown shield—Six-Stone Cloud Plate!

The golden saber came too fast—Li Yuanjiao didn't even have time to retrieve a talisman. He poured all his mana into the shield, and the deep green serpent dragon coiled around it protectively.

BOOM!

"Ugh..."

A tremendous force hit his arm, and the Six-Stone Cloud Plate shuddered under the impact. A sharp pain shot through his wrist as the golden light pierced through, forcing him to retreat with gritted teeth.

The Six-Stone Cloud Plate let out a mournful sound as a bloody hole appeared in Li Yuanjiao's wrist. He had no time to assess the injury before the golden saber, having circled behind him, streaked back toward his heart.

Situ Mo, after releasing the golden saber, took only a moment to catch his breath before charging forward with his sword. He swung down with a sweep of golden light, while the Six-Stone Cloud Plate, now with a small hole in it, struggled to block the cold, piercing advance of the golden saber.

Li Yuanjiao spun around, drawing his Qingche Sword to parry Situ Mo's strike, barely managing to deflect the blow. The Six-Stone Cloud Plate shot upward to block the golden saber.

Creak...

Though the golden saber was not as terrifying as when it first appeared, it still caused Li Yuanjiao to stumble backward. He retreated several steps, shrouding himself in Profound Patterned Spirit Mist, trying to put some distance between himself and the deadly golden saber that coiled like a viper, ready to strike again.

Hum!

Li Yuanjiao braced himself, clutching a talisman and preparing to counterattack. But just as the golden saber was about to strike again, Kongheng recited a mantra, and the saber suddenly froze midair.

Situ Mo's face twisted with rage as he shouted out angrily, "You damned monk! Must you interfere?"

With Kongheng's intervention, Li Yuanjiao had enough time to activate his Profound Patterned Bottle, concealing his presence and disappearing from sight.

Situ Mo immediately grew cautious. Li Yuanjiao was no ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator—if caught off guard, he could be dangerous.

Scanning the area with a venomous gaze, Situ Mo quickly performed another hand seal. The golden saber obediently returned to his hand and vanished.

I should've mastered a perception technique... Wasting time on this Golden Blaze Saber cost me. Otherwise, I could've killed all three of them today!

Situ Mo exhaled deeply. Knowing he had missed his chance, he was not willing to risk further conflict and exhaust himself.

Then, a sudden sense of impending doom gnawed at his heart.

This is not good...

He did not waste time on empty threats, simply raising his hand. In the forest, the formation flags rose from the ground, returning to his grasp as the golden formation vanished.

Golden light surged beneath his feet, and several golden shields floated around him for protection. Tall and imposing, he spoke with a cold, ominous tone.

"We will settle this another time!"

Before his voice had even fully faded away, Situ Mo had transformed into a streak of golden light and flew away at incredible speed, disappearing over the horizon in mere moments.

"Granduncle!" Li Xijun hurried into the formation, calling out twice.

Li Xuanxuan quickly pulled him into an embrace, carefully looking him over before letting out a long breath of relief.

"You nearly scared me to death!"

Li Yuanjiao's face was pale, the glow of the Qingche Sword in his hand dimming as he sealed away the remaining sword intent. The hole in his wrist was large, revealing a glimpse of bone beneath.

Without saying a word, he summoned a stream of water from the nearby pool, filling the wound before placing a hand over it, making it appear fully healed.

Kongheng, knowing this was merely a temporary fix, gently advised, "These wounds cannot be left untreated. Please use some healing pills and medicine to heal it as soon as you can, or it may hinder your future cultivation."

Grateful for Kongheng's help, Li Yuanjiao's expression softened as he responded, "Thank you for saving me, Master Monk."

Meanwhile, Li Xuanxuan, having checked Li Xijun's wounds, rushed to his son's side and carefully examined him. But with Li Yuanjiao's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation, the elder could not tell how serious the injuries were. He could only mutter anxiously, "Oh dear! Oh dear..."

Li Yuanjiao glanced at him in surprise, the corner of his mouth curving slightly upward for a brief moment, before turning back with a sigh of regret.

"It is a pity... That man had quite the skill. I could not gain the upper hand."

"Second Uncle!"

Li Xijun smiled and pulled out a gleaming golden artifact from his storage pouch, presenting it with both hands as he bowed his head respectfully.

"...That may not be the case."
