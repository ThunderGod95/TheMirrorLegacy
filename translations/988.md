# Chapter 988: Double Fire

Brilliant Heavenly Light cascaded down as gardenia petals danced upon the breeze.

A Daoist Master in gold and white robes sat cross-legged in the mountains. His hands formed an intricate seal, held protectively before his sea of qi. Guided by this seal, streams of the Bright Yang Heavenly Light divine ability surged into his body, sinking deep within.

Within his sea of qi, his Celestia Gate divine ability shone with a brilliant light, relentlessly grinding down and suppressing a treasure that was as perfectly round as a Golden Core. Under this prolonged assault, the divine ability inherent in the treasure flickered, its light waning as it steadily weakened.

An unknown time passed before the Heavenly Light finally descended. The Golden Core-like treasure trembled violently. The layers of protective light surrounding it dissipated, and the ambient Heavenly Light instantly swarmed in like a frenzied tide, surging into the treasure and dyeing it a brilliant Bright Yang gold.

'It's finally refined!' Li Ximing's heart trembled as joy surged through him. As expected, a flood of information poured directly into his mind.

The Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument!

He snapped his eyes open and raised his hand. The Spiritual Treasure, still resembling a Golden Core, materialized in his palm. It was entirely crimson, encircled by intricate rings of golden thread that converged into five distinct, lustrous bands. Li Fire spiraled around it, radiating an intense, scorching heat.

'A Li Fire Spiritual Treasure! And one closely related to Profound Rituals!'

As his thoughts focused, the wondrous functions of the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument flooded his awareness. There were five in total!

'The first wondrous function is Li-Expanse. It manifests as a unique "Li-Light" within a grotto-heaven, described as "a variegated light, as vast and deep as the Eastern Sea." It can obscure illusions, envelop a large area, and serves to confuse and bind targets. Its range was immense, far exceeding the jade ruler I have, the Sichuan. As long as I provides sufficient dharma power, it can even expand indefinitely to blanket an entire territory.'

'This Li-Expanse may not have had much effect on Li Zhouwei, but that was only because he shattered it with his 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread'. Any ordinary Daoist Master who fell into its range would be severely restricted and would have to expend great effort to escape.'

The second function is Double Radiance. It's an exceptional combat technique, incredibly fast, possessing a force that both repels and annihilates. Once an enemy is struck by the light, a "parting" force activates, continuously pushing them back.

Furthermore, the power of Double Radiance can be augmented by a Li Fire infused by its owner. Although it can only hold one type of Li Fire at a time, the Double Radiance will adopt that fire's unique properties and power. Its potential for customization is immense.

'Right now, I can only infuse my Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame. That should enhance its spiritual quality and its ability to refine metals. If I ever find a Li Fire renowned for its destructive might, like the Heavenly Apricot Rain... its power will ascend to yet another level!'

These first two functions are each comparable to the primary ability of a high-grade Spiritual Artifact, yet they are merely supplementary. The true power of the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument is concentrated in its third function: Profound Snare!

The five rings of golden thread are forged from a material called Daylight Pure-Axis Gold, which was refined for a century in the Golden Crow Radiance Flame until it became incorruptible, unmelting, and utterly indestructible. When Profound Snare is activated, these five threads descend from the heavens, each transforming into a distinct beam of light.

This light can disperse Dharma Arts and bind armaments; its applications are wondrous and many. Its only weakness is Converging Water. If the user possesses extremely high Li Fire Dao-Profundity and has cultivated the relevant Dao Lineage, they can unlock even more variations. At the peak of mastery, when the Dao Lineage is complete and Dao-Profundity is supreme, the user's Dharma Body can instantly swap positions with any of the five threads—a truly profound tactical advantage.

Even for someone like Li Ximing, whose own Dao Lineage doesn't align perfectly, the indestructible nature of the Daylight Pure-Axis Gold alone makes this ability incredibly formidable!

The remaining two functions are Dao-Cultivation and Swarm of Light. The first, Dao-Cultivation, assists in cultivating divine abilities related to the Li Fire and True Fire paths, making it a treasure for passing on a lineage.

When the Swarm of Light function is activated, it rouses the spiritual essence within the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, causing it to cast down a brilliant radiance used to suppress "heretical" paths and annihilate evil spirits...

The awkward part for Li Ximing, however, was that this "suppression of heretical paths" also seemed to affect the modern Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. As the Spiritual Treasure's owner, he was immune, but if he were fighting alongside allies, activating Swarm of Light would be... inconvenient.

'...Still, these are all outstanding functions.' As Li Ximing's thoughts settled, a sense of shock crept into his mind:

'No wonder Daoist Master Yuansu was able to dominate back then with just a single Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. Even mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators feared him. These ancient Spiritual Treasures are truly terrifying... On top of that, he had united both his Life Divine Ability and Body Divine Ability... Who would possibly dare to provoke such a figure?'

'Besides, the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal was a relic of the ancient Feathered Serpent and was rumored to have the potential to become a full-fledged Dharma Treasure. This Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument is likely a few steps below that.'

His thoughts had barely faded when he immersed his spiritual sense into the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, intending to examine its inner workings. What he found, however, made him pause.

He had not expected to find a vast, intricate, and profoundly complex Daoist treatise crashing into his consciousness!

The Spiritual Treasure actually contained an inheritance, a legacy named the Southern Li Ingestion Method. It was an orthodox, ancient Immortal Dao technique for ingesting qi!

This was nothing like the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, nor was it some "Heavenly Embryo Shamanic-Talisman" path. It was the most authentic, orthodox Immortal Dao inheritance: the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature.

It consisted of tens of thousands of flowing characters, written in a profound golden seal script, all infinitely mysterious. It expounded upon the Great Dao of Li Fire, focusing on resonating and merging with heaven and earth to "seek the wondrous." This "seeking the wondrous" was their 'Yellow-Cap' stage. "Attaining it in the body" was the Daoist Master stage. "Achieving the position" made one a True Monarch or a 'Feathered Sage'. As for terms like Embyronic Breathing, Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment Realm, or Purple Mansion Realm... there wasn't a single mention in the entire text!

Li Ximing read it again and again, and realization suddenly dawned: 'This is the Dao Lineage of that Sword Immortal King!'

'That Sword Immortal King had made it very clear back then. The Yinghua Wang family cultivated the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature. In his eyes, the modern Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao—which calls itself the Immortal Dao—and the orthodox Demonic Dao of the north were one and the same. Both were nothing but heretical, deviant paths.'

'A genuine cultivation method from the ancient immortals! No wonder it had to be preserved inside a Spiritual Treasure!'

Li Ximing was secretly overjoyed, his heart pounding with excitement. 'I've heard the threshold for this ancient Immortal Dao is extremely high. But... if a junior from my family could actually cultivate it, and I gave them this Spiritual Treasure... wouldn't they wield the power of an ancient immortal cultivator?!'

He was stirred with ambition, but as he tried to delve deeper into the text, he suddenly realized something was wrong. He frowned, a new sense of shock dawning on him. 'What... what is this...'

He was a dignified Purple Mansion Realm expert, backed by divine abilities and a century of cultivation, yet after reading only the introduction, he was left baffled, barely understanding half of it!

'How is anyone supposed to cultivate this?!'

His Dao-Profundity might not be the highest, but he was still a Purple Mansion Realm expert! Even though Li Fire wasn't his specialty, his Bright Yang path was closely related to it. He had read Li Jiangqian's Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun with ease and gained significant insights. But this... this method was even more difficult to comprehend than the Golden Book of Divine Attendance!

The Golden Book of Divine Attendance is also difficult, but from a Purple Mansion Realm perspective, its difficulty is one of complexity. This Southern Li Ingestion Method is difficult because it's abstruse. It's obscure to a terrifying degree!

He was dumbfounded. He'd never imagined this was what "extremely high threshold" meant. He had to awkwardly abandon his previous ambitions, his mind filling with doubt.

'How could this be? There must be something missing... Surely no cultivation method is this difficult to understand. What kind of heaven-defying genius would it take to even begin this path?'

'In that case, it's completely unsuitable for my family members. A person who might have reached the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivating the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao could waste their entire life on this and achieve nothing. Even someone with the talent to reach the Purple Mansion Realm might fail to cultivate this method! I'd just be leading them to ruin.'

Li Ximing let those thoughts rest and examined the inheritance again. He suddenly noticed something else. The Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument didn't just contain the Southern Li Ingestion Method; there was also a message left by its previous owner.

This person identified himself as Daoist Master Nanzhao Lu, from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. He had lived during the time of the Great Liang, cultivated the Dao of Li Fire, and was a Great Daoist Master who had achieved 'Completion' in his divine abilities.

More importantly, he didn't mention Wanling Heaven. Instead, he identified himself as a cultivator from the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion!

'The Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion?'

Li Ximing was not unfamiliar with this name; most people in the Yue State knew it. The Azure Pond Sect's famous Yi Mountain City, located in the southern part of the Yue State, had been constructed by the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion!

'Daoist Master Nanzhao of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition... that means the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion also belonged to that tradition. The "Mansion" later vanished, so it would be logical for Lu to take refuge with Wanling Heaven, which was part of the same Encompassing Profoundity tradition.'

After all, a Li Fire Great Daoist Master who had completed his divine abilities was a top-tier expert in the world. He wouldn't be treated poorly anywhere; even Wanling Heaven would have welcomed him with open arms.

The message was brief, just a few sentences introducing his background. But the tone at the end grew somber:

"My Encompassing Profoundity tradition once governed heaven and oversaw the earth, and all obeyed. But the Sheji betrayed the Dao, leading us to this state. Now we must submit, resting our hopes in the distant profound... Yet they still call themselves the Upper Sect, using the Tianwu prestige to rule the world and 'correct' the four quarters. They act as if they are the second Thunder Palace—it is nothing but a feast held within a tomb!"

"This year, this venerable one will seek to attain the 'Li Position'. If I succeed, the Southern Fire (Mansion) will rise again, and our lineage will have a breath of life remaining. If I fail... then there will be no radiance left for us."

"Whoever finds my "Bright Instrument"—your cultivation will be when Wanling Heaven falls!"

Li Ximing read the message several times and sighed inwardly. 'This Daoist Master Lu... he saw things clearly. It seems the Wanling Upper Sect truly cannot let go of its former status as the Thunder Palace. They refuse to lower themselves. All these years, they've continued to clean up the messes in the world, "exorcising demons and defending the Dao," which has offended countless people and put all the other great powers on high alert.'

With a light flick of his hand, the Spiritual Treasure dissolved into a streak of light and settled into his sea of qi. Only then did he notice a jade summons token in his mountain dwelling vibrating, signaling that someone was reporting.

The person who arrived was Li Jianglong, looking extremely respectful. He was accompanied by Ding Weizeng. Both of them bowed deeply at the foot of the steps, a grand gesture of obeisance.

Li Jianglong spoke respectfully, "Sir, the matter you assigned us half a year ago has not yet been resolved. We sent men to the Shahuan Kingdom three separate times, but we found no news of the Daoist Master you seek. We were told he has not returned in many days..."

Li Ximing possessed a spiritual jade ring, and its most suitable new owner was this Daoist Master Zhusheng of the Shahuan Kingdom. He had sent people to make contact long ago, but he hadn't expected the man to be impossible to find.

"No matter." Li Ximing calculated on his fingers; more than half a year had passed. He glanced down at Ding Weizeng, noting that the man had been stalled at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm for some time. He was at the "Completion" stage but had no clear path forward. Li Ximing sighed inwardly before asking, "What news is there? How are things on the lake?"

Li Jianglong replied respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, the riverbank is still in turmoil. Structures on the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter continue to collapse; the place is a ruin now. There has been no news from the north for many days, we don't know what they are waiting for. Only a few monks from the Wilderness come down occasionally, but Jiangxia is keeping watch."

Li Ximing's focus sharpened. "How are the Mushroom Forest Plains?"

The man had managed the family's affairs for a long time without issue and was highly proficient. He immediately understood the implications of the question and replied, "The Azure Pond Sect has shown no reaction, sir. They are continuing to consolidate their forces."

"Hmm..." Li Ximing mulled this over, then looked down at Li Jianglong with a smile. "And how is Suihuan doing?"

Among all of Li Zhouwei's descendants, only Li Jianglong had borne a son. He was born during the great conflict between North and South, when all the cultivators had gone to war, and so he was named Li Suihuan. Li Ximing himself had chosen the name and remembered it well. At the mention of his son, Li Jianglong immediately bowed again. "He has been tested, sir. He possesses spiritual apertures and is currently practicing Embyronic Breathing. He seems to have a fair bit of talent."

"Good!" Li Ximing had just acquired the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination. It was a technique that could be practiced openly, and it even came with its own innate Spiritual Qi. He smiled. "Your father obtained an ancient cultivation method in the grotto-heaven. It is of the Li Fire path, with different merits from your elder brother's technique. Since the timing is so fortunate, let him be the one to cultivate it."

"My deepest thanks, Daoist Master!"

Li Jianglong was visibly overjoyed. Li Ximing chuckled, happy to make the arrangements and bestow both of the fine cultivation methods he'd acquired. But then, Li Jianglong knelt once more and kowtowed. "This junior's cultivation has reached the threshold. I was preparing to enter seclusion to break through to the mid-stage. But after managing affairs for these past few years, I finally have this chance to see you, Daoist Master... and I wished to ask for guidance."

Li Ximing nodded internally. Li Jianglong truly had dedicated a lot of time to managing the lake's affairs these past years; Li Ximing wouldn't have offered such favor—granting a name and a cultivation method—otherwise. Hearing his request, he smiled. "Do you have anyone in mind to recommend as your replacement?"

Li Jianglong replied, "Fifth Uncle is kind and magnanimous, he handles difficult matters with ease, and he has a carefree, unconventional demeanor. This junior cannot hope to match him..."

"That boy?" At the mention of Li Zhouming, Li Ximing shook his head and laughed. "He's only been kept in line recently because Xia Shouyu has him under control. Who is he capable of managing? Don't throw your Fifth Uncle to the wolves."

This frightened Li Jianglong so much he ducked his head, a cold sweat breaking out. "I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare," he stammered. Fortunately, the Daoist Master seemed to pay it no mind. He simply took a sip of tea and mused aloud:

"The Wilderness is too important right now, so Jiangxia can't be moved. Little Cui has returned to the island. Ding Weizeng isn't skilled in internal affairs. We're out of people who are talented in both governance and warfare and who also command enough prestige to keep everyone in line."

"Aside from you and your brothers, the Jiangque generation has more women than men of note. Only Jiangzong has shown real promise. Don't entrust him with the full burden yet. Just give him an official title and let him act as your deputy for a while. Have 'Minggong' teach him the ropes. We'll consider it a test."

"This junior obeys!"

A single, casual sentence from Li Ximing was enough to trigger a massive political shift on the lake, one that involved the transfer of power between the family's main branches. Yet he showed no hesitation, his face still holding a faint smile. "Don't look down on him just because his cultivation is low for now. We're lucky to have him."

Li Jianglong nodded repeatedly and quickly departed. Only then did Li Ximing's smile fade. Within his sea of qi, the Purple-Gold Thunder Mace was already suppressed. He stared quietly at the drifting gardenia petals.

'I have enough Li Fire and Whole Pill spiritual materials, but I still haven't identified a key Converging Water material. This upcoming grand gathering of cultivators... many people will surely be seeking artifact refiners. I should be able to get the final materials for the spiritual armor there. I also need to visit Qize. Zhouwei has confiscated a growing number of Treasured Artifacts from those Buddhist cultivators. It might be time to negotiate with the Lotus Temple.'

'Come to think of it... I have a lot of Spiritual Artifacts on me. I need to re-evaluate them. It would be best to trade some for items that are more useful. With Spiritual Artifacts, quality trumps quantity. To think I'd live to see the day where I have too many!'

The thought made him laugh aloud. Just he, Li Ximing, now possessed the Sichuan for control, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger for mobility, and True Fire, Li Fire, and Merging Fire for offense. The newly acquired Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman was also likely a protective Spiritual Artifact focused on a unique wondrous ability. He was frighteningly well-equipped.

'All these treasures... they're worth more than my own life. If I'm not careful, a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators might just ambush me to steal them all...'

Just as he was mulling this over, a clear, bright voice rang out in the mountains. "Daoist Friend, are you present? Kuang Yu has come to visit!"

Li Ximing recognized her voice immediately. He knew she was here to repay the favor concerning the Soaring Profound Chaos Stone. He rose to greet her, "I am truly honored..."

"You're too kind." Daoist Master Kuang Yu, still clad in her light azure robes, smiled as she landed in the clearing. "I hurried back to find Daoist Friend Liaoluo. He was quite fortunate; despite spending so long in the grotto-heaven, he wasn't seriously injured and even managed to acquire several benefits."

She sat down gracefully at the stone table, retrieved a white jade box from her sleeve, and placed it on the table with a smile. "He mentioned that he ran into your family's Daoist Master Minghuang, who was with Yangya. Afraid of a misunderstanding, Liaoluo retreated early. He heard you were looking for Bright Yang materials, so he gave me this Victory General Stone. It's a spiritual resource..."

Kuang Yu paused, raising an eyebrow. "Perfect for refining spiritual armor, I hear!"

Li Ximing was startled for a moment, then he understood. He had promised Dingyang Zi long ago that he would ask around for artifact refinement materials on his behalf. News of this must have spread from another Daoist Master. He mused inwardly:

'She, Xuanyi, and Liaoluo must all be in the same circle, or perhaps from closely related Daoist traditions. They are separate from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, but still friendly toward it.'

His mind settled, he opened the jade box. Inside lay a thin slice of jade, glowing with a brilliant radiance. A dense wave of Bright Yang qi washed over him. He accepted the item and bowed his thanks. "Daoist Friend Kuang Yu, you have solved a great difficulty for me."

Kuang Yu smiled. "It's nothing. This is mutually beneficial. There's no point in exchanging endless pleasantries."

Her straightforward manner left a very good impression on Li Ximing. He thought again of the spiritual jade ring, and after a moment's consideration, he asked, "Daoist Friend, do you happen to know Daoist Friend Zhusheng of the Jade True path?"

Kuang Yu nodded, a slightly puzzled look on her face. "Naturally, I know of him..."

She hesitated for a moment before explaining, "To be clear, the Three Yuans of the Azure Pond Sect were active in the Southern Sea in their early years. All three are highly capable and forged many friendships. My grandfather, the cultivators of Mount Qusi, and even Mount Jingyi—before it split from the Southern Sea faction—all had dealings with Daoist Master Yuansu."

"Xuanyi and Daoist Master Qiuhu actually met when they were children and know each other very well. I, on the other hand, was studying at Hengzhu, so I didn't see them as often."

"As for Daoist Master Zhusheng, he is closer to Daoist Master Yuanxiu. If you need a favor from him, you'd have better luck asking the newly ascended Daoist Master Qinghu."

"I see!" Li Ximing nodded to himself, silently mapping out these relationships. 

"Thank you for the guidance, Daoist Friend!"

Kuang Yu smiled and added, "The old Daoist Master of Mount Qusi is still around, and he excels at artifact refinement. If you have such needs in the future, I can also formally introduce you to Daoist Friend Liaoluo..."

Her eyes were bright. She tilted her head slightly, revealing the elegant contours of her profile. Though her voice was soft and gentle, it carried an unmistakable tone of serious conviction.

"The Supreme Yang has lost its brilliance, but you and I are more or less on the same side. Tianwan is devoted to the Immortal Dao and doesn't harbor much ill intent, but we still have Changxiao, Baoqing, and Jinghai to worry about... It's difficult to predict the future, but we must be prepared."

"It is always good to have more dealings with allies."

Li Ximing was taken aback for a moment, then nodded with great seriousness. He sighed inwardly. 'She knows a great deal as well. But then, she has followed Hengzhu for so many years. It's only natural that Hengxing would give her some guidance in the end.'

He met Kuang Yu's smiling eyes, poured her a cup of tea, and raised his own. "I will definitely pay them a visit!"

## Beihai Sea

Dark colors shifted and the void trembled. A gray streak of light traversed the gloomy Great Void. Within the oppressive darkness, fleeting glimmers of illusory light flared, as if countless vast and terrifying shadows were submerged deep within, revealing only a scale here or a claw there.

On the surface of the sea below, wind and rain churned the waves. A woman with a pure and clear demeanor stood silently in the downpour. Beside her, the Dragon King's colossal form stood immobile, his expression frigid, not speaking a word.

CRACK! A bolt of lightning tore across the night sky, bleaching the world white for an instant. It illuminated a red-haired, golden-robed man standing nearby, his expression inscrutable. He spoke in a low, haunting voice, "Wanling Heaven has fallen."

He held a mirror in his hands. An image flickered within it—a crescent of light, blue on top and white on the bottom, floating in the Great Void. The image wavered, sometimes clear, sometimes blurred, but one could vaguely discern endless ruins and a landscape littered with shattered bones.

The Beihai Sea Dragon King, standing beside Daoist Master Xiang Chun, spoke with a calm expression, his voice raspy. "It is indeed empty. The Encompassing Profoundity tradition has no face left. They didn't even bother to conceal their actions... This is a demonstration of power—showing that the once-great Wanling Upper Sect has fallen so low that any stray dog can tear flesh from its bones!"

On the other side, Dongfang Changmu's expression grew icy. "This was expected. Tianwu's radiance is so overt... it's hardly dignified. And the Wanling Sect is even worse. The Encompassing Profoundity daoist tradition is scattered to the winds, each branch protecting its own territory. How many of them have ever truly united for a common cause?"

Nearby, Xiang Chun lowered her head slightly, listening as Dongfang Lieyun asked, "Who obtained Lin Hengjiang's Dao Lineage?"

Dongfang Changmu shook his head, looking puzzled. "I wasn't able to detect it. Perhaps someone concealed its trail."

This small interlude didn't hold their attention. The thunder overhead grew more intense. Dongfang Changmu lowered his voice. "The plans of all the great families are coming to fruition. The White Qilin is currently on the border of the Underworld's territory. All three sides are entangled..."

"The Yang family has the Underworld's support and is determined to seize the 'Position of True Qi'. The conflict between North and South has conveniently flattened most of the obstacles within the Yue State. All that Yang Jinxin lacks now is the final catalyst."

Dongfang Changmu's eyes were filled with a mixture of dark gloom and fervent anticipation; he was even trembling slightly with excitement. Dongfang Lieyun's expression likewise flickered with emotion, and he slowly closed his eyes.

"The entire Yue State is like dry tinder in the peak of summer. Layer after layer of oil has been poured upon it. All it lacks is a single spark... and in an instant, a storm will erupt. A storm that will capsize the entire order of the south."

Dongfang Lieyun's brows shot up. He snapped his eyes open, staring intently at Dongfang Changmu. In that instant, the rift that divided the various branches of the Dragon-kin seemed to vanish, replaced by a shared, surging ambition and a restless agitation that could no longer be suppressed.

"Success or failure... it all hangs on this final step."

Dongfang Changmu's eyes were bright. He replied with cold certainty, "He is an Immortal. He cannot be wrong."
