# Chapter 906: The Flying Mountain Descends

Caishan.

A sinister, evil energy pervaded the air. A mist of Azure Crow Qi roiled through the mountain forest, surging and receding like a restless tide.

A vast, dark shroud covered the sky, from which a thousand golden eyes flickered, casting down fine, swift beams of golden light. Below, the two Merciful Ones stood with dimmed auras, their faces etched with fury.

Daoist Master Luo gripped his short blade, his expression grave.

There had originally been four Merciful Ones here: one of the Way of Compassion and three of the Way of Emptiness. He and his ally had arrived early and eliminated one, leaving three.

One of the Way of Emptiness was no real threat, merely an annoyance. Another, however, served under the seat of Developing Wisdom and was quite resourceful. But the most lethal was the one from the Way of Compassion, the Merciful One who commanded Arhats. The three of them, united, were enough to suppress him.

Fortunately, his opponents were unfamiliar with the dao of Gathering Wood. The fight had dragged on long enough for him to strike down the weakest of them—who had fled to parts unknown. The remaining two were far less of a threat. Still, he too was growing weary. If not for the Thousand-Eye Nurturing Light Robe in his hands, which was specifically crafted to counter the Way of Compassion's methods of housing souls and commanding Arhats, he would be in far greater trouble...

He, Daoist Master Luo, was far from his limit, and farther still from defeat. Though he struggled to vanquish his enemies, the Merciful Ones' transformations were limited, making it even harder for them to capture him. The fiends merely cycled their Divine Abilities, occasionally sending beams of Azure Crow Qi soaring into the sky. Their spiritual senses remained active, still locked onto Li Ximing and the other person in the heavens. There was no doubt about it: Li Ximing, facing Helian Wujiang, was in even greater peril than he was.

***

Li Ximing’s true form manifested amidst the baleful aura. Golden-red flames coiled around him like coiling drakes, forcing back the roiling, congealed baleful qi.

Before him hovered the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, radiating a brilliant light that enveloped his Dharma body. To his side, a greenish-yellow spiritual ruler floated, emitting ripples of mountains and rivers. It not only repelled the surrounding sea of baleful aura time and again but also measured the illusions within it, reducing them to wisps of black smoke.

But his condition was far from good.

The battle hadn't been long, but he now lacked the Divine Ability or dharma power to restore the half of his head that had been bitten off. He retained that terrifying visage, his body covered in wounds from the baleful aura, which clung to him like persistent black smoke.

After clashing with Helian Wujiang for some time, he had begun to understand his opponent's strengths. Aside from that venomous, single eye on his chest, his Body Divine Ability was also exceptionally strange.

Li Ximing's Audience with the Celestial Gate could empower his Dharma body, but only to a limited extent. Helian Wujiang's Dharma body was significantly stronger. While not the most formidable in the Purple Mansion Realm, it was composed of countless layers of baleful aura.

This baleful aura gathered and dispersed without form. Spell arts below the Purple Mansion Realm could no longer harm him. Even Divine Abilities and spell arts *at* the Purple Mansion Realm level were slightly weakened upon impact. Most troublesome of all, this Body Divine Ability resonated with the 'Rakshasa Sea'—the baleful sea that now filled the sky—allowing him to recover continuously. He was incredibly difficult to deal with.

To make matters worse, his opponent's long whip was extremely agile. Li Ximing's Spiritual Artifacts and Divine Abilities were, on the whole, rather cumbersome. In just a few dozen exchanges, his opponent had already forced him to use the miraculous power of the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass twice—reversing the Bright Yang, shaking the stars, and escaping certain doom.

Each time he reversed the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, four bright stars would appear. Now that he had used it twice, two of those stars had dimmed. Although its power was undiminished—perhaps even more profound—his connection to the Spiritual Artifact limited him to only four such uses in total.

'I don't know how Kui Qi is faring. This Helian Wujiang is formidable. If this drags on... I'm going to be sacrificed here!'

It wasn't that his loyalty to the Supreme Yang was so profound, but Moongaze Lake was right by the river. He had no time for further hesitation. His spiritual sense locked tightly onto the sword-wielding figure within the black qi, not daring to relax for an instant.

As expected, Helian Wujiang gave him no quarter. A glint of golden light pierced through the roiling black qi once more, like a silver vase shattering. A chill shot up from his Shengyang Acupoint as an intense premonition of crisis washed over him.

"Om!"

He couldn't see his opponent's Spiritual Artifact or Dharma Art, but he preemptively activated Tread on Flames. The instant the flames ignited around him, he snapped his head up, focusing all his Divine Abilities and dharma power into a single point, his spiritual sense screaming at its absolute limit.

There was nothing.

"Omm..."

But the first thing to shatter was the greenish-yellow ripple of mountains and rivers. The vast range of the Shichuan and the measuring profundity of the Monarch's Balance worked in perfect concert. Li Ximing finally, faintly, perceived the direction of the attack. Tread on Flames flared, and he twisted his Divine Ability.

The Radiant Sun King's Halberd was incredibly cumbersome and, in that split second, impossible to swing in front of him. But as Li Ximing used Tread on Flames to step through the fire, he moved to place himself directly behind the Spiritual Artifact!

'The Radiant Sun King's Halberd can't move in time, but I can move to let it block for me!'

BOOM!

The gleaming Radiant Sun King's Halberd in the sky looked as if it had been struck by a heavy, iridescent blow. It was flung high, followed by a deafening crash and an explosion of Bright Yang radiance.

Li Ximing abruptly spat out a mouthful of blood and tumbled out of the flames from his Tread on Flames. A network of fine, hairline cracks appeared on his chest, like a swarm of tiny ants. Yet, a relieved smile touched the corner of his mouth.

Only then did he see it clearly. The iridescent object was pitch-black, blade-shaped, and no larger than a man's palm. It was exceptionally sharp—it was the short blade from Helian Wujiang's waist.

The blade's light was insidious. As the dust settled, the roiling sea of baleful aura finally began to part, revealing the gash the blade energy had torn through it.

The measuring power of the Shichuan had certainly played a huge role, but it was the Radiant Sun King's Halberd blocking the blow that had been key to saving his Dharma body from being severed. That short blade was terrifying. Whether it was the Shichuan or the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, anything put in its path would have been damaged. The Shichuan, being a spirit embryo, might even have been shattered... and that spirit embryo was crucial to maintaining the current stalemate. How could Li Ximing allow it to be so easily destroyed?

Blood wet his lips, but he had no time to rest. A Celestial Gate rose from beneath him, its Heavenly Light brilliant, suppressing the Dharma swords that lunged from the baleful qi. The attack forced the owner of those five pale fingers to shudder and reveal his form. He stood before Li Ximing, clad in black and silver armor, robes fluttering, gaze icy.

Helian Wujiang had arrived.

The Celestial Gate stood among the clouds, trembling slightly as it was engulfed by the rolling baleful aura. Its once-gleaming white bricks were now dull. Dragon banners and phoenix chariots plunged into the miasma; treasured canopies and streamers fell silent, flapping weakly against the baleful tide. It seemed the gate was failing to suppress the sword.

The bright Heavenly Light was momentarily blocked. The space between Helian Wujiang's heart and lungs suddenly split open, and that eye rotated once more. Golden light flared, freezing Li Ximing in place as that terrifying maw appeared again.

"Puchi!"

Li Ximing dissolved into fire and fled with his Divine Ability. The man snapped his head around, only to see a gleaming compass appear once more, its chaotic stars shaking and trapping him on the spot.

The man in the platinum Daoist robe materialized a short distance away, panting slightly as he immediately swallowed a pill.

The timing just now had been perfect, but Li Ximing hadn't had the chance to unleash the destructive light of the Bright Yang.

Half his head was still missing, and one arm had been lost to the enemy's binding-and-devouring attack moments before. His lips were still moving, chanting an incantation, as he used his Divine Ability to steady himself within the roiling baleful aura. He was a miserable sight.

On the other side, Helian Wujiang, draped in his black and silver armor, stared at him silently. The eye on his chest blinked slowly. He held a longsword in one hand and a Dharma whip in the other, his outer robe billowing in the wind.

The wound in his abdomen was healing amidst the baleful qi, seemingly no longer a major issue. However, streams of Bright Yang radiance flowed within it, constantly being suppressed by the baleful aura. Clearly, it wasn't just the chaotic stars holding him; Helian Wujiang was also focusing on mitigating the pressure in his stomach.

Meanwhile, a bright white gash had appeared on Helian Wujiang's shoulder, but it was already regenerating within the baleful qi. The longsword in his hand shimmered, clearly brewing another spell art.

'That demonic art is truly terrifying...'

Li Ximing showed no sign of despair, merely exhaling with suppressed frustration.

That eye was one of the most tyrannical Dharma Arts Li Ximing had ever encountered. It froze, then devoured. It was impossible to evade. The first time he'd seen it, he had been caught off guard, and as the fight intensified, dodging it had only become more difficult.

Yet Helian Wujiang seemed to be expending very little energy. The only sign of strain was the increasingly vibrant Bright Yang radiance in his gut. If he hadn't paused to suppress it, Li Ximing wouldn't have known he was burdened at all.

"Bang!"

As his longsword glowed and his whip recoiled, the light of the chaotic, shaking stars began to fade. That face, with its high brows and deep-set eyes, looked over once more.

Li Ximing's hand decisively pressed down on the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass again, once more in a reverse grip.

'He's preparing to flee...'

Helian Wujiang's expression darkened. The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass was an excellent item. The last retreat had already brought Li Ximing to the edge of the baleful sea. If he used it again, escape would be easy. All his effort would have been for nothing.

'A pity...'

Just then, a streak of Azure Crow Qi shot up from below, carrying a sinister demonic light, and latched onto Helian Wujiang's silver boot, causing the man to frown.

It was Daoist Master Luo, finding a moment to provide support.

Unlike the grave, cold focus he afforded Li Ximing, Helian Wujiang looked almost insulted. His brow furrowed deeply. His Dharma swords, which he had been about to sheathe, flashed out again, bursting with brilliance.

"A rat from a heretical sect... How dare you!"

But that wasn't all that rushed him. A black cloth covered in a thousand eyes followed—it was the Thousand-Eye Nurturing Light Robe, Daoist Master Luo's most famous possession, which he had spent a lifetime nurturing.

Helian Wujiang was dismissive, but his expression turned serious at the sight. He spat a breath of baleful qi onto his sword, which immediately flared with light, blocking the incoming sheet of golden beams.

But the moment his attention was divided, the Audience with the Celestial Gate rose from the other side, parting the baleful sea. A beam of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light shot across the sky!

'He's not fleeing? He's attacking instead...'

Helian Wujiang snapped his head back, raising one hand. He gathered the rolling baleful qi, forging it into a baleful ray to block the white light, letting the scorching Hidden Light burn against his defenses.

'In your current state, what threat could you possibly pose?!'

Li Ximing slowly raised his head. With his Dharma body so injured, the Heavenly Light couldn't emerge from his brow; it could only be released from his palm. Though only half a head remained, he tilted his face slightly. His hand, at last, seemed to grip the spiritual compass, as if preparing to escape.

But as his dharma power flowed into it, he silently, soundlessly chanted in his heart:

'Still not showing yourself? You've been lurking for so long, do you really have the patience to wait? Do you want to earn this favor from me or not? Because I'm leaving!'

"Splash..."

At that exact moment, rain began to fall again, this time with a faint purple tint. Helian Wujiang's pupils shrank. His eyes struggled to look up, and only then did he realize.

A pair of treasures had appeared from within the clouds.

One was a round, flat jade medallion, carved with square lightning patterns, like a palm-sized talisman. The other was a black, white-patterned object, similar to the Shichuan spiritual ruler but slightly smaller, and it gleamed brightly.

The flat, bright jade medallion had been gathering power for a long time. It unleashed a torrent of silver-white lightning, crackling with danger. The black, white-patterned talisman pulsed like a living thing, breathing out a torrent of crimson flames that arrived in an instant!

Helian Wujiang broke out in a cold sweat. The eye on his chest blinked once and actually flipped over, revealing its pitch-black reverse side.

Faced with lightning and fire, his first instinct was to protect the eye!

BOOM!

The silver-white lightning and crimson flames instantly drowned him, streaming down his gleaming black-and-silver armor and erupting in clouds of black smoke. The pervasive baleful qi shot into the sky as the 'Rakshasa Sea' boiled violently. Even his longsword was struck by the blast, and its torrent of baleful energy and lightning was forced to stop.

"Awoooo—"

This lightning-flame was clearly potent and had been stored for some time. It made the man in the sky tremble violently and let out a blood-curdling shriek, causing everyone on the battlefield to pause.

But it was far from over. Daoist Master Luo, having made his move, quickly turned to block the pursuing Merciful Ones. Above Helian Wujiang, however, the rain clouds dispersed, revealing a towering white, flying mountain peak that pierced the heavens!

The Great Void immediately began to heave, as if suppressed by an immense weight. A layer of hazy white light crept onto Helian Wujiang's armor, seeming to lock him in place.

Helian Wujiang's pupils instantly turned blood-red. Wisps of baleful aura streamed from the corners of his eyes, flowing down his cheeks. The Incessant Calamity shifted, and countless peaks of black qi surged forth to collide with the flying white mountain in the sky.

"Clang..."

Caught off guard, he spat out a mouthful of black blood. The wounds on his face, deep enough to show bone, slowly began to close. His deep-set eyes stared fixedly at the sky.

"Who!"

But the lightning and fire in the sky only grew more ferocious, revealing a young man.

He rode a scaled, avian beast and wore a deep blue, intricately patterned robe. His face was youthful, his chin slightly pointed, giving him a handsome appearance. He cradled a sword, his long hair unbound and scattering in the wind.

The young man's eyes were bright. He smiled and announced:

"White Ye Immortal Sect, Yehui."

As soon as he spoke, a dense rain of purple, iridescent fish fell from the sky. Each was the size of a calf, with scales of varying shades, and each wore a white, skeletal human head. They blotted out the sky, transforming into a torrent of purple water.

Sorrowful Southern Water

Eastern Feather Mountain is a flying mountain, a spirit-monster of the earth and rivers, given wings to become a suspended peak. Sorrowful Southern Water is a river of the netherworld, a demon-ghost of the streams, wearing human heads to become an irretrievable current. Now, as it descended, it beat down the baleful aura, shattering it into motes of cold, dark energy that fell to the earth.

Just who was Yehui? He was the heir to the orthodox Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition, from the same lineage as Changxiao. Helian Wujiang, caught off guard, found his Divine Abilities greatly diminished and was in imminent danger. The lightning and fire still refused to cease, crashing down upon him.

"Hahahahahaha!"

With Yehui's appearance, Daoist Master Luo's true colors were revealed. He looked like a petty villain who had just gotten his way. Though his rash attack had earned him a beating from the two monks, scattering his dark energy, his face was filled with a gleeful, vindicated smile. He nodded to Yehui from afar.

Clearly, Daoist Master Luo's intervention had not come from nowhere. He obviously had a close relationship with Yehui and had been tipped off long in advance. That was why he had disregarded his own safety to pin Helian Wujiang down!

"Yehui! Have you thought this through?!"

The situation had reversed in an instant. The large-bellied monk on the other side roared in fury, grinding his teeth.

"You come from a clean background and could have stayed out of this! But you chose to stand with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Don't blame us for being merciless!"

The young man in the sky looked amicable enough. He merely smiled at the words, but his eyes were filled with an icy, boiling rage.

"Bald donkeys... You bring three or four Merciful Ones to my very doorstep, abduct my disciples, attack my mountain gate, and demand my juniors surrender. And now you ask me if I want to 'stay out of it'?"

"I'll 'stay out' of your mother's bald head."
