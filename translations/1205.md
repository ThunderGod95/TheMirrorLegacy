# Chapter 1205: Wielding the Lesser Yang

His thoughts moved quickly, and he immediately stood up with a sigh.

"My father often recalled the old clans of the Wei era. He once traveled far to the Eastern Sea to protect the Cui family, using his own position to help that old Daoist Master Cui achieve his cultivation. His only regret was the scattering of the six clans… To think that what was once far on the horizon is now right before my eyes!"

The youth's expression grew solemn as he replied,

"Since we share this old connection, how can I simply watch a fellow Daoist struggle alone and unaided in the Song court? From now on, feel free to come up to the lake."

Cheng Qian, his heart filled with anxiety, gave a deep bow and said in a low voice,

"I would not dare disturb Your Highness. It is simply that I must not disobey the charge of my ancestors. Stationed here in Jiangnan, I see the radiance of the Bright Yang and cannot turn a blind eye."

Had Cheng Qian a choice, he never would have involved himself in Jiangnan's machinations, yet from his Lian family's origins to his master Xianyao's accomplishments, all bore signs of the Bright Yang. The Song court's stance was clear; how could he dare to refuse!

The youth in crimson robes, however, saw through him completely. He pulled Cheng Qian down to sit, his gaze glittering with a daunting golden light that held a measure of authority.

"King Wei cultivates the Bright Yang, which is the path to becoming a Human King and an Imperial Monarch. Since you are of the six clans, fellow Daoist, I'm afraid there can be no question of simply witnessing the Bright Yang's radiance and then parting ways after a brief acquaintance. You should think this through carefully."

Cheng Qian's gaze turned grave and his expression sank, understanding that the man before him was no simple character. This person did not want a vague attitude, but demanded a clear stance!

He paused only for a moment before saying,

"To this day, I am still a subject of the Song. Overlook Peak has not yet been returned, so I dare not make any major moves."

Li Jiangqian seemed to have anticipated his words, a smile touching his eyes as he replied,

"I am not forcing you, fellow Daoist, merely making a point… In the grand scheme of this world, all are but chess pieces, each with a place, be it black or white, making calculations simple. But if a piece is ambiguous, someone will inevitably come to test its quality."

He added faintly,

"To wait until then to declare yourself would not only be unseemly, but it might also invite disaster."

Cheng Qian felt a chill and nodded silently. The prince finally took his seat, his former expression replaced by one as warm as a spring thaw, a smile gracing his features.

"Now that I know you are one of our own, I have a private matter to ask of you, fellow Daoist, aside from official business."

Cheng Qian raised an eyebrow as the man continued,

"I wonder, what divine ability have you cultivated?"

Having now shown his willingness to align with the Li family, Cheng Qian naturally would not be evasive about his divine ability. He answered seriously,

"My divine ability is called 'Golden Book Sequence'. It is a path that bridges other Daos, cultivating the Dao of the Earth Wu-Shaman. It can transform resources and often displays miraculous effects that adapt to the situation."

"'Golden Book Sequence'…"

A cultivator's divine abilities were rarely known to others, their specific marvels being an especially great taboo in the world of cultivation. For Cheng Qian to reveal so much already showed tremendous sincerity. Li Jiangqian began to ponder,

'It doesn't seem like Awaiting the Supreme Divine… It must be a another of Whole Pill. In that case, he shouldn't possess the same kind of skills as Que'Wan, which makes things easier.'

With that, he swept a sleeve, revealing a pitch-black whip. It lay coiled like a living thing, slowly writhing. The prince said gravely,

"When slaying an enemy, King Wei obtained this whip and entrusted it to me. Have a look, fellow Daoist."

"'Baleful Qi'?"

Cheng Qian was still hesitating over whether he had made the right move when the man produced a Spiritual Artifact with a flip of his hand. He was so startled that he hastily took a step back, his shock evident.

The old Daoist Master Chulong of his Dao Lineage had been a rogue cultivator, and the spiritual items of the Capital Guard were famously scarce, leaving them destitute. Most of his life's savings had been invested into this very mountain, leaving behind just one Spiritual Artifact and one spirit embryo. Since Daoist Master Xianyao cultivated Wu Earth, the spirit embryo naturally couldn't be kept. His master's Spiritual Artifact had also been given to Bai Ziyu as payment for help in cultivating a divine ability, and as for Daoist Master Xianyao's own spirit embryo, Cheng Qian, a cultivator of the Whole Pill, was equally unable to retain it…

After all these twists and turns, all Cheng Qian had left besides his own spirit embryo were the Subduing Sword—the culmination of Daoist Master Xianyao's life's work—and the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, acquired from Daoist Master Qinghu in his later years. And both of them were Wu Earth artifacts!

While the Whole Pill, as a Dao of Transformations, didn't directly conflict with Wu Earth, it was still somewhat powerless against its might. Even Awaiting the Supreme Divine dared not command the sun and moon, let alone Cheng Qian, who lacked a divine ability to forcibly commandeer items for his use…

From his own private experience, he found these Spiritual Artifacts to be incredibly heavy, consuming his dharma power like flowing water, and they were not the least bit docile.

And Helian Wujiang had been the Tiefu King, after all. Though the Li family might look down on this Dao Baleful Cold Iron Whip, it was no weaker than the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, and was even more compatible with the Whole Pill.

To Cheng Qian, it was incomparably precious.

'Cultivators of the Whole Pill are rare these days. There was the Golden Feather in the past, and I fear the Li clan will follow in the future. A rogue cultivator like me cannot hope for perfection; this is truly an excellent choice.'

Cheng Qian felt a stir of interest. Coupled with his intention to get closer to the Li clan, he clasped his hands and asked,

"Your Highness means to say…"

Li Jiangqian said,

"You are one of us now, Cheng Qian. I am overseeing the construction of a grand formation and am short some spiritual materials and resources. This trip out was partly to search for them."

The spiritual item for the formation's core is the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance, supplemented by Metal Virtue and Dawn Qi, which have been entrusted to the Nine Mounds—the Li clan originally possessed the Night Supplanting Bottle, a source of Dawn Qi, but unfortunately, the time required to smelt it down was far too long. Otherwise, shattering this somewhat useless Spiritual Artifact would have served the purpose perfectly.

As for the seven spiritual resources needed for the formation nodes, Li Jiangqian was preparing to entrust the task to Daoist Master Cheng Qian, who had just inherited a batch of spiritual items and resources. He specifically asked about items related to the Lesser Yang, and Cheng Qian replied,

"Lesser Yang items are few. My master once obtained a share, but it was later traded away by a senior. However, on the list you mentioned, fellow Daoist, is the Reflecting Metal 'Radiant Strange White Gold'. I have two portions of that right here, as well as some 'Dawn Essence Treasure Maple' that an old friend of my master possesses."

These three items were clearly not enough to trade for the Dao Baleful Cold Iron Whip. Cheng Qian said with a serious expression,

"As for the other four, I will find a way…"

Li Jiangqian's voice dropped slightly.

"The sooner the better! Whether in two or three years, or as long as five or six, it will be of great use."

Cheng Qian's expression shifted slightly. He gave a small nod and said,

"I understand…"

Unexpectedly, Li Jiangqian did not hesitate in the slightest, immediately placing the Dao Baleful Cold Iron Whip into his hands. How could Cheng Qian dare to accept it? He instantly tried to refuse, but Li Jiangqian said with utmost gravity,

"My father upholds the Bright Yang's Mandate of Heaven and is the subject of much envy. The various Buddhists all wish for nothing more than his demise, yet they are defeated time and again, unable to challenge the king's might. Thus, they plot against our members and subjects, causing my brothers to grow fearful and seek shelter with the Song… Since you know the current political climate, you must understand that if you go out to sea, you will likely be targeted."

A subtle change came over Cheng Qian's face, and he did not immediately reply. The eldest son of King Wei's voice carried a note of warning as he continued,

"You will be gathering spiritual resources for my family. First, you must maintain secrecy; this will also protect your life. Second, be cautious above all else. Travel through the lands of Song whenever possible. For any risky ventures, you must never rely on luck!"

He produced a talisman as he spoke.

"If you run into any trouble, you can call upon my family for aid at any time. Should you truly fall into someone's hands, an extra Spiritual Artifact will give you a better chance to save your own life."

This was what Li Jiangqian truly believed. He had assumed his family's first Purple Mansion Realm subordinate would be from the Yin family, had also considered that Cui Jueyin might achieve his breakthrough early, and had even thought of Guo Nanwu.

'But now it seems this Daoist Master Cheng Qian might well be the first.'

But Cheng Qian was different from Guo Nanwu. He had no Qusi backing him. This was a good thing, as it forced him to rely completely on the Li clan, making him far more trustworthy, but it was also a bad thing… A single misstep, and he could become a weak point for others to exploit.

A living Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master—one who cultivated the Whole Pill, no less—was far more valuable than any Spiritual Artifact or spiritual item. Cultivating one of their own was an incredibly arduous undertaking. Li Jiangqian felt no particular compassion; a simple calculation of worth told him that this Daoist Master could not be lost under any circumstances!

'He is still in charge of Overlook Peak, and his elder just died in battle for the Great Song. Even if the Underworld is cruel and merciless, it would be against their own interests to let something happen to him at this juncture. Otherwise, I wouldn't have him running this errand for me.'

But there was always a chance of an accident. If this Daoist Master Xianyao had made any personal enemies in the past, and something happened to Cheng Qian now, his family would not even have the standing to utter a single word of protest.

Cheng Qian gazed somewhat blankly at the solemnity in Li Jiangqian's eyes, then slowly nodded and accepted the whip.

"My thanks, Your Highness."

Li Jiangqian gave a slight nod without another word. He left the mountain in a flurry and immediately set off for the Chengyun Gate, leaving Cheng Qian to stand silently on the mountain, watching him go.

The talented young Daoist Master paced heavily, remaining silent for a long time. After what felt like an eternity, he slowly made his way to the rear hall. The vibrations from the coffin grew more violent, causing his expression to flicker.

The words of his master, Xianyao, seemed to resound in his ears, one layer upon another. Overwhelmed by an indescribable complexity of emotions, Cheng Qian fell to his knees and prostrated himself deeply.

'There is only one path to follow to its end… I can only hope that this man has some chance of succeeding.'

…

Wind and rain raged as thunder rolled across the sky. A torrential downpour cascaded onto the sea's surface, where a faint tremor could be felt. Flashing bolts of lightning plunged deep into the ocean, past massive chambers of glazed coral, illuminating a palace hidden in the pitch-black depths where one could not see one's own hand.

A gray-haired man stood amidst the water, his eyes emitting a misty red glow. Beneath his feet, myriad waves churned as if they were his subjects. At the foot of the glazed jade steps knelt a general, his head bowed low, the hand he pressed against the floor trembling slightly.

"He was eaten?"

The gray-haired man slowly turned his head. The red in his eyes flickered with electricity, revealing a suffocating power as a low laugh escaped his lips.

"Eaten at Danping Reef… I had you watch over him, and it turns out he was just a meal for Dongfang Siyun."

"Come… tell me, how am I supposed to explain this to the White Qilin!"

These words filled the kneeling Lu Xu with boundless terror. His father, the Dragon King Beihai, was already enraged. The slightest misstep, and he would surely end up in a dragon's maw!

He lowered his head and said in a hushed tone,

"My lord, this subordinate followed my King to… to see the Eighth Young Master… and could not keep watch. However, I had left Ying Hebai, whom the White Qilin once mentioned, to patrol the sea there… but he…"

A gaze as sharp as a sword fell upon him, and Lu Xu's voice trembled as he spoke.

"He was taken away by Ping Yan from Yinzhou Island. Ping Yan said they were going to Moongaze Lake to see the Li family… The lords once said we could act as we saw fit regarding matters of the Li clan."

Dongfang Lieyun's gaze coiled around his head like a phantom—it was utterly malevolent, chillingly cold, and his terrifying voice was devoid of any inflection.

"How did Dongfang Siyun know."

"My King!"

A frigid chill seized Lu Xu's heart. He kowtowed repeatedly, his voice urgent.

"Ying Hebai was absent, allowing his people to come and go freely. It must be… that he was spotted on his way to find me, my lord! The Si Sea Dragon King already possesses four divine abilities, having mastered Heretical Seeking and Revering the Eastern Lord. He would have been able to sense him…"

But his words caught in his throat as a pair of massive hands clamped around his neck, hoisting him high into the air in an instant. The overwhelming threat of death filled him, and a whimper escaped Lu Xu's lips. The Dragon King's voice was ghastly.

"Hidden in a Valley, how could he 'seek' anything! The Profound Maiden resides at the World's Navel, and Danping is one of the Valley Islands. Even with all his power, that Si Sea Dragon King would have been completely blind—Who was it! Who!"

By the end, the Dragon King's voice had become a world-shaking roar. His huge hand tightened rapidly, producing a series of sharp cracks. The renowned Xu Water Demon King did not dare to struggle in the least, only managing to whimper for his life.

"Gulp…"

The Dragon King's throat bobbed with a faint swallow. He finally raised his other hand, seized the Demon King's arm, and yanked with sudden force.

"Rip!"

An intense radiance of Ling Water rippled outwards. Dark blue demon blood slithered down the Dragon King's arm like a swarm of nimble snakes. He had brutally torn off the Xu Water Demon King's arm and placed the bloody limb into his mouth. With a single light chew, it slid down his throat and into his stomach. A flicker of greed crossed Dongfang Lieyun's eyes, but he finally released his grip, casually tossing the Demon King to the floor.

"My King! Thank you, my King!"

Lu Xu had no time to tend to his wound, his pale face filled with relief. He knocked his head on the floor several times and stammered,

"My King… he went out by himself… my King… that auspicious beast ran outside on its own…"

The Dragon King sat in the dense darkness, his crimson eyes fixed coldly upon him, still saying nothing. Lu Xu summoned every ounce of wit he possessed, wracking his brain in a daze. In the suffocating silence, he at last found an excuse. He kowtowed, and with trembling words, finally managed to say,

"My lord… that… that island of the Li family… Lady Xiang Chun and a rogue cultivator visited it… My lady… my lady is of the Valley Water… Perhaps it was… perhaps it was she who sensed that Valley Island…"

At these words, the Dragon King's gaze grew profound, and a hoarse laugh rumbled in his throat.

"You mean… Zhongli Chun?"

Lu Xu dared not speak the name, only continuing to kowtow on the floor. Dongfang Lieyun, however, had already risen to his feet, his heavy footsteps echoing through the hall.

"You do have some quick wits about you. Not bad. Zhongli Chun went there long ago; it's been over a century since she came from the Northern Dark Mansion to establish her mountain in the Beihai Sea… Beiyao is Northern Lesser Yang… That auspicious beast was originally driven out by the White Victory Dao. The True Monarch has many plans; it's not surprising she would go take a look on Northern Lesser Yang's behalf. I am aware of this matter."

He turned his head, his tone flat.

"Perhaps Dongfang Siyun was always fixated on that slim chance of inquiring about the Dao and has been watching Xiang Chun for a long time. He must have seen her come to the sea to confirm something and followed the trail… and that's how he stumbled upon the auspicious beast."

Having unraveled it to this point, Dongfang Lieyun's face took on an even more sinister cast.

"He is gluttonous and lecherous, accustomed to tyranny thanks to the favor of Dragon Monarch Xiyang. Years ago, I beat him to the punch regarding Xiang Chun, sealing her in the Beihai Sea, and he has hated me inexplicably ever since. It would be no surprise for him to eat something just on a whim."

Seeing he had managed to save his life, Lu Xu finally showed a trace of post-calamity relief. He kept his eyes lowered and said softly,

"It's just that… we still need to provide an explanation to King Wei."

At the mention of this, fury surged in Dongfang Lieyun's eyes once more, but his voice was light.

"He's lucky he knew his limits. If he had eaten Liu Changdie as well, I would have dragged this matter before the Dragon Monarch himself today just to humiliate him!"
