# Chapter 1259 Deploying Troops

"King Wei!"

Jia Zan lowered his gaze, not daring to speak. The colors in the distance had already closed in rapidly. Leading them was a soft, sparkling expanse of Heavenly Light, like a descending staircase of profound power, that transformed into an elegant youth with a black ruler and ink brush at his waist.

It was Cui Jueyin!

Following close behind him was an expanse of pale white light, from which emanated the sounds of clashing armies. It resembled a white vapor, yet it burned and flickered like a flame, coalescing into a middle-aged man whose movements were as swift as the wind. He dropped to one knee, performed a salute, and they all declared in unison:

"Greetings, my King!"

Cheng Qian was a step slower than Kuang Hong. Still dressed in white, he appeared humble and taciturn. Only after he landed did Liu Changdie, clad in a brocade robe, and Lin Chensheng, dressed entirely in black, reveal themselves from behind.

On this campaign, there was no doubt that all of Li Zhouwei's subordinates were united. Yet, a subtle hierarchy could be discerned among them. Cui Jueyin was the first to have pledged his allegiance to the Li clan, and his surname alone was enough to make him stand out, giving him an air of command over the others.

Kuang Hong, who had personally received Li Zhouwei's orders, was nearly his equal in standing, and the battle intent in his eyes was the most conspicuous.

As for Cheng Qian, also from one of the six great families of Guanlong, he appeared far more reserved. In terms of intimacy, he was no match for Cui Jueyin; in terms of background, Kuang Hong left him in the dust. Even in combat, his 'Whole Pill' status was a source of great awkwardness...

As for Liu Changdie and Lin Chensheng, one was a figure of the elder generation while the other had come under orders. They were a step behind, bringing up the rear. Jia Zan took it all in, a sense of secret dread washing over him.

Although the divine abilities of the few who had arrived did not seem particularly formidable, this was only Xiangxiang! A great battle was still raging in Ruzhou, where the divine abilities displayed were earth-shattering; there was likely more than one cultivator at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm there!

But before he could properly assess these masters of divine abilities, King Wei at his side had already turned and shot him a glance.

"Open the formation."

Even though he had anticipated it, those two words still sent a cold sweat down Jia Zan's back. He clenched his jaw, momentarily rendered speechless.

He, Jia Zan, had surrendered so quickly precisely because he understood the situation clearly. But for that very reason, he was also keenly aware of the predicament he now faced. How had his Jia family managed to survive all these years?

It was nothing more than two things: cultivating relationships and maintaining prestige. As long as the Jia family remained in Luoxia, even if their fortunes waned, they could always rely on their vast resources to make an attempt at the Purple Mansion Realm!

But if his Jia family showed disrespect to the powers on the mountain, they could forget about any goodwill! For the sake of his clan, Jia Zan's best course of action would have been to die fighting here. That would have prevented the immediate loss of Xiangxiang's Purple Mansion grand formation, and the city would not have been considered completely fallen!

'Afterward, some great lord would hear of it, let out a few sighs of regret, and our family's centuries of prosperity would be restored.'

'But is it worth it?'

The price would be his own life and that of the Wei family's rising star. In these chaotic times of war, could two families without a Purple Mansion Realm expert truly survive on another's territory, sustained by a few empty sighs of pity?

More importantly... surrendering without a fight was already a great humiliation. There was no turning back!

'This is Li Zhouwei, not Yang Ruiyi!'

But in that brief moment of hesitation, a profound sense of crisis washed over him. Jia Zan saw those golden eyes begin to narrow. He dropped to his knees with a thud, formed a seal for a divine ability that lit up two jade talismans, and presented them to Li Zhouwei with a lowered gaze.

"Reporting to King Wei, the spiritual formations of the Jia and Wei families can be activated with these two talismans!"

At these words, Kuang Hong's eyes lit up, and Li Zhouwei slowly turned his gaze and nodded.

"Jueyin."

All of them were at the Purple Mansion Realm, and every Daoist Master present understood the importance of Xiangxiang's two grand formations. To control them meant securing their rear, giving them a real chance to defend this location. The difference between taking the formations and not was as vast as that between heaven and earth!

When Yang Ruiyi and Li Zhouwei had decided on a strategy of 'raiding,' they had never expected to capture Xiangxiang outright. Their original goal was to cause chaos throughout the territory, then divide and conquer it piece by piece. Li Zhouwei's secret arrival and his suppression of Lu Fu had simply been a gamble to see if he could use the man to open these two grand formations!

Jia Zan's willingness to concede was, naturally, a wonderful turn of events!

Cui Jueyin immediately stepped forward to gently accept the talismans. Li Zhouwei's plans shifted in an instant. He helped the Daoist Master to his feet and said with a smile:

"Daoist Master Jia, you've come from Yinling?"

That old fox Jia Zan was incredibly shrewd. He hastily raised a hand and said:

"Yes... yes! Daoist Master Xuanwei is in seclusion and has not yet emerged!"

Li Zhouwei glanced at him with great interest before turning away. Another idea had already surfaced in his mind, and he gave his orders:

"Cheng Qian, Jueyin, take these talismans, go and assume control of the two grand formations. Solidify our rear and act as the situation dictates!"

The two assented and departed on the wind. Li Zhouwei immediately turned to Yin Juexi and said in a low voice:

"Juexi, Senior Yuanbian, you two are to leave at once for Boye and see if you can breach the Qiao family's grand formation. It would be best if you can, but if not, hold your position, observe Zanmen, and watch for reinforcements from Guanzhong in Northern Zhao!"

The pair immediately stepped into the Great Void. Li Zhouwei finally turned to the last person, Lin Chensheng, and said softly:

"There is still no news from Ruzhou. Daoist Master Changyun is truly capable to have held up those two families for so long. I must trouble Daoist Master Jingzhao to head southwest and keep an eye on Xiaoshi Mountain. Be wary of a surprise attack on Xiangxiang from Western Shu."

After speaking, he avoided the nearby Jia Zan and sent a silent message using a divine ability:

'Daoist Master, you can veer a little to the west. If you see the light of divine abilities flare up over Zanmen and Boye, with flames that soar to the heavens, you are to immediately head north and reinforce Kuang Hong!'

Lin Chensheng nodded impassively and went on his way. Jia Zan had listened to the series of commands, his heart growing anxious.

'What about Yinling? Why is he ignoring the Tao family?!'

The old Daoist Master was filled with fear, and he was resentful that the Tao family was content to watch the tigers fight from their mountain. He knew their reputation was far greater than his own, and he wished Li Zhouwei would just conquer them immediately, forcing those Daoist Masters to also surrender to the south...

'That way, if there is a day of reckoning... I'll at least have someone famous in front of me to take the fall!'

Seeing that Li Zhouwei was making no move against the Tao clan, he felt a vague sense of unease. He glanced at the shimmering Celestial Gate beneath his feet, and after a moment's hesitation, he understood.

'This Lu Fu is going to be difficult to handle!'

Lu Fu cultivated the Present Departs Old, and his current state was unknown. But even if he were severely injured, who besides Li Zhouwei could possibly suppress him? Others might not know, but Jia Zan was well aware of Lu Fu's temperament; out of pride and for the dignity of the Lu clan, he would never surrender!

'Unless he's killed on the spot!'

But who was Lu Fu? He was from the Lu clan of Chuncheng in Gu Prefecture, and his family was registered there. His claim of being a descendant of the 'Two Lus' was not just idle talk.

Although the Two Lus had failed to verify the Dao, as disciples of True Monarch Xu Xiang of the Numinous Treasure, their cultivation path meant they had many disciple-brothers, apprentices, and grand-apprentices in both the Comprehending Profoundity and Azure Profoundity. All of these people later became incredibly influential figures!

Lu Fu's status was far beyond anything Jia Zan could compare to. If he were killed, an unknown number of people would be offended. Gu Prefecture would certainly dispatch men, and what's more, the great families of Luoxia would no longer dare, nor would they be able, to surrender to Li Zhouwei!

A plan began to form in his mind, and his heart suddenly brightened. He had found a way out. He said urgently:

"The Lu clan is a great one. If Your Majesty kills him, it will surely make all discerning men in the world afraid to welcome you. I am willing to escort him to Gu Prefecture... I will act as a mediator and persuade them, and I will surely earn the endless gratitude of the Lu clan..."

'A heaven-sent opportunity!'

Jia Zan was incredibly excited. If he could secure this task, he could conceal the real reason for his surrender and instead become a great hero who ensured the safe return of a Lu family descendant!

But to his slight confusion, King Wei did not answer. Instead, he reached into his sleeve and took something out.

It was a brown urn, which looked like wood, yet was not.

The Celestial Gate suddenly rose, and the golden light beneath it flared, about to sense the Great Void and escape. With a soft command, King Wei tossed the urn high into the air. It swelled in the wind, and a brilliant, multicolored light shone from its dark, gaping mouth.

"Go!"

The Heavenly Nurture Urn.

Lu Fu had been suppressed for a long time, and his attempts to break through the divine abilities had left him grievously injured and powerless to resist. Swept up by the multicolored light, he transformed into a streak of gold and was drawn into the Spiritual Treasure.

The man's divine abilities were by no means weak; he had simply had the misfortune of encountering Li Zhouwei. He was the strongest cultivator the Heavenly Nurture Urn had ever imprisoned, and the Spiritual Treasure shook violently for a moment, absorbing a tremendous amount of divine ability and dharma power before settling into his palm.

Jia Zan fell silent as he watched, the joy that had filled his heart turning to bitterness. Only then did Li Zhouwei look toward the Daoist Master from Luoxia, a thoughtful expression on his face.

He would never allow a local power like Jia Zan to remain in Xiangxiang, nor could he allow him to accompany any of his other forces. The cultivators he led were mostly in the initial stage of the Purple Mansion Realm and were simply no match for the man before him. If anything went wrong, who knew what schemes the old fox was plotting?

He simply smiled and said:

"I'll have to trouble you to come with me, Daoist Master."

Jia Zan stared at him blankly, but he was already seized by the Heavenly Light and swept into the sky. Obscured by a divine ability, they shot northward at an incredible speed!

This completely disoriented the old man. He stared blankly at the scenery rushing past beneath his feet, his brow furrowed in thought.

'Where are we going?'

True, the spiritual qi in Luoxia was dense, making travel through the Great Void far slower than flying in the physical world. But flight in the physical world produced a blazing trail of light from one's divine abilities. The Bright Yang was not a Dao that excelled at concealment; even with an obscuring art, it could at best fool the eyes of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. To a Purple Mansion expert, they would be as clear as day!

Yet he saw King Wei remained unhurried, and spoke softly:

"What are the origins of the Jia and Wei families?"

Jia Zan replied in a low voice:

"The ancestor of the Jia clan... was named Ping. He cultivated under Daoist Master Yi Chuan, a disciple of True Monarch Guanhua. Later, he entered Tongxuan Palace, which led to the founding of my Jia family. His son followed Tian Chen... We have long since fallen into decline."

With a somewhat probing tone, he turned his head and said:

"The Wei clan, on the other hand... their ancestor was actually a disciple of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao. They later produced a very famous great cultivator named Wei Kan, who was once a genius of the Wu Light Dao."

The name sounded familiar. Li Zhouwei had heard it before; he was a figure from the Immortal-Buddhist Debates during the era of Emperor Lizong of Zhao. The demon beast from the Western Sea had mentioned him. Li Zhouwei's expression shifted.

"Luoxia?"

"Yes..."

Jia Zan sighed.

"But as Your Majesty knows... it is exceedingly difficult for Purple Mansion cultivators to have children, especially those devoted solely to their cultivation. The Wei clan already had a small population, and since he was the sole heir of the main line and died childless, the family's fortunes naturally waned."

A bitter tone crept into his voice as he continued:

"The great families of Luoxia... Your Majesty may hear that we live glamorous lives, but this is not the age of the Encompassing Profoundity's rule. Without a True Monarch, decline is inevitable. In my father's day, he was at least qualified to go to the Grotto-Heavens to seek the Dao, but he was sent back down due to insufficient aptitude. He was passing through Zanmen when I was born, so he named me Zan. By the time the family was in my hands, we no longer even had the qualifications to enter a Grotto-Heaven and try our luck."

He watched King Wei's expression as he spoke, tears streaming down his face.

"A junior of the Wei clan is currently in seclusion, attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. I risked death coming south in the hopes that Your Majesty would not attack the grand formation and ruin his cultivation... Now, I also hope Your Majesty will not conduct a simple raid before returning to Song, leaving Xiangxiang to suffer the flames of war once more..."

A look of determination entered the old man's eyes.

"If Your Majesty can help him achieve his Dao, I am willing to cast aside all my pride and assist you in pacifying Luoxia. I ask for nothing more!"

The man before him watched him with a smile and said softly,

"Do you truly mean that?"

A rare smile touched Li Zhouwei's lips, but Jia Zan sensed something was amiss. The words had already been spoken, however, so he could only nod grimly. King Wei said,

"I'm afraid you won't dare."

A chill bloomed in Jia Zan's heart, but he dared not ask more. He could only bow his head and endure it, feeling the intense blaze of light rush past him. Before long, the landscape of Yinling rapidly came into view.

Li Zhouwei didn't pause in the slightest, simply flying past. He continued north, openly passing through the two patrolling spiritual senses below as he maintained his course!

The two spiritual senses lingered for a moment before quickly vanishing. Jia Zan watched the landscape continue to shift below him. As if realizing something, he raised a sleeve to wipe his forehead, feeling deeply anxious.

He was an intelligent man. Earlier, he had assumed Li Zhouwei was testing the Tao family, but just after passing Yinling, he instantly understood.

What lay further north?

The northern gate of Luoxia: the Ju clan's territory of Liangchuan.

There lay Luoxia's only great mountain, a strategic pass in the grander scheme of things: Mount Liangchuan!

The Ju clan's great mountain separated the two regions. Its terrain was as treacherous as Tangdao Mountain, and its spiritual energy and earth veins were dense and strong. A few prefectures beyond this mountain lay the Great Adoration Dharma Realm!

If this pass were on the border between two nations, it would surely be garrisoned with vast numbers of troops, guarded by several masters of divine abilities, perhaps even a Great Daoist Master. Even though it was now deep within the heartland, its rich spiritual energy meant that the cultivation conditions for the Ju family's geniuses were even better than those of the Tao clan!

All of Luoxia, and indeed all of Northern Zhao, had been unprepared for Li Zhouwei's arrival. No one could have predicted that Xiangxiang would surrender in an instant, that the Tao clan would shut its gates, or that Li Zhouwei would push so deep into Zhao territory to arrive here!

'The Ju clan's Daoist Master was killed by the Murong family while fighting for a treasure in Wanling Heaven... They've been without a Purple Mansion expert for a long time. That means... this great mountain... is currently without a single Daoist Master to guard it!'

Jia Zan understood the crucial point:

'Even if no one is guarding it, the great Mianchi Prefecture lies beyond the mountain. The Daoist Masters there may not belong to Luoxia, but for a place of such strategic importance, even without a resident guardian, it couldn't be conquered quickly. The moment it came under attack by divine abilities, they would surely come to its aid...'

Li Zhouwei's reason for bringing him here was perfectly clear.

Jia Zan's heart sank into an icy abyss. He clasped his hands inside his sleeves, his knuckles turning white as his grip tightened.

'He wants me... to trick them into opening the gates, to take Liangchuan without shedding a single drop of blood!'
