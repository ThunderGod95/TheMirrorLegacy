# Chapter 733: Peak Master

Li Qinghong finished speaking, and Cui Changfu grew suspicious, asking softly, “Fellow Daoist... what kind of spirit item are you seeking?”

Li Qinghong replied softly, “These things are hard to find inland from the Western Sea. They are Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm spirit items such as the Radiant Celestial Stone, Qilin Crow Spirit Husk, or White Blood Sap... No need for anything specific, just one of them will do.”

Upon hearing this, Cui Changfu’s expression eased slightly, and he said with a smile, “A Purple Mansion Realm spirit item? I once had a dose of Radiance Profound Essence... but it’s gone now!”

Li Qinghong was seeking these items to help a younger family member break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. It weighed on her mind. Although Purple Mansion Realm spirit items were hard to come by and she hadn’t held much hope, hearing this gave her a spark of interest. Her expression lit up and she asked, “Has it been traded to someone? Please share any information that you have...”

Cui Changfu finally believed her, this woman was indeed here for a spirit item. He seemed relieved and much less wary, speaking in a low voice, “Our branch... was once sent by Wei State’s Emperor Gong to venture beyond the outer seas, searching for Penglai. Emperor Gong was broad-minded and elegant. His reign was prosperous and generous, so our treasure ship carried many rare items.

“Later, chaos engulfed the sea, the Great Void shattered, and we lost contact. By the time the Qi State replaced Wei State, there was no news at all. The spirit items we had were used up one by one, until only two portions of Radiance Profound Essence remained.”

Li Qinghong listened closely as he continued, “One portion was given long ago to the Dragon family. Dongfang You drank it and gave birth to Dingyuan the Dragon Son. The other portion was sent to Mount Changhuai, where a Daoist Master used it to sire a child, who I’ve heard is called Qing Jifang. It was all thanks to the Radiance Profound Essence.”

Li Qinghong listened for a while and realized both doses had already been used. She was immediately disappointed. Cui Changfu noticed this and said softly, “Don’t be discouraged, Fellow Daoist... When the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven fell, I heard it was overseen by the two Daoist Masters, Yuan Su and Qiushui. That grotto heaven surely contained Purple Mansion Realm spirit items... Even if Chu Yi looted most of it, the Daoist Masters went there afterward. Surely they got their hands on something.”

When Cui Changfu mentioned Chu Yi, his tone grew awkward, his lips quivered slightly and he lowered his eyes. Yet his words were like a bell ringing through a dream. Li Qinghong suddenly understood and her heart lit up with joy, That’s it!

She hadn’t known before that the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven had passed through Yuan Su’s hands. Now that she realized it, he must surely possess Purple Mansion Realm spirit items. And since her second uncle served under Yuan Su, asking for them might not be too difficult.

At the moment, she cupped her hands in thanks and said, “Many thanks, Senior!”

Cui Changfu gave her a close look, stroked his beard, and nodded. Li Qinghong hesitated for a moment but still spoke up, “There is one more matter... My family also cultivates under the Bright Yang Dao Lineage. We are hoping to gather five Immortal Foundations to pave a smoother path for our family...”

Since the request wasn’t an easy one, she lowered her stance and continued softly, “If it’s convenient, I hope to borrow access to your esteemed family’s Dao lineage. We can exchange it with techniques... or dharma artifacts, or even spirit items. Whatever your family desires.

“If you are unwilling, I have no intention whatsoever of prying into your Dao lineage...”

Li Qinghong added a few more apologetic words. Cui Wanqing’s expression remained fairly warm, even slightly moved. But the old man of the Cui Family did not have the best look on his face. Cui Changfu responded in a hoarse voice, “I’m afraid, our ancestral Dao lineage cannot be shared.”

He rejected her firmly. Li Qinghong apologized, then took a spirit flower from her storage pouch and handed it to the two of them, saying softly, “Thank you for the information, Senior. This is the Wanglin Blossom, it can preserve life and ease sorrow. Please accept it as a token of gratitude.”

Fearing her prolonged presence might cause unease, she rode lightning into the sky and took her leave. Cui Wanqing seemed to have a good impression of her and saw her off, gently saying, “Take care, Senior.”

After sending Li Qinghong off, Cui Wanqing returned to the island only to see Cui Changfu still sitting where he was, tapping the table restlessly. His aged eyes were full of unease.

Curious, Cui Wanqing sat down beside the old man and asked softly, “Grandfather... this Senior Qinghong seems like a straightforward person. Her family has quite a few people with Bright Yang Dao Lineage. It’s not like they’re all one-of-a-kind. At worst, sharing one could be mutually beneficial...”

“Sigh...” Cui Changfu stroked his beard and didn’t respond immediately. He said in a low voice, “She may truly be a remnant of Wei's Li descendent...”

He pulled out a jade slip from his storage pouch, examined it carefully, then took out a map and studied it closely. He murmured, “Moongaze Marsh lies in Jiangnan. When Emperor Wu campaigned south, he passed through there... and met immortals within the marsh. Could a surviving bloodline really remain?”

Cui Wanqing was visibly moved and said quietly, “If she’s truly from the imperial family of old, Grandfather, why not help them? At most, it’s just a technique being exchanged... and we’d gain something in return anyway...”

Cui Changfu shook his head and said softly, “Not anymore...”

His expression suddenly became animated, his eyes sharp and piercing as he said, “Wasn’t the pain already enough? When Northern Qi State replaced Wei State, Li Xunquan raised an army in rebellion. Our ancestors crossed the seas carrying precious treasures to aid him, only to have their heads hung over Dianyang City for nine years, never taken down.

“When Li Xuan restored the empire, our great ancestors rushed to his side, taking with him two brilliant great-uncles. The kingdom fell again and they were slain. We lost three dharma artifacts, and even our treasure ship was left behind in Xu State.

“When the Dongli Sect was founded, my grandfather hadn’t even reached the Purple Mansion Realm. He rode the wind to join them, handed over all of Chongzhou Island to the Dongli Sect only for the Dongli Daoist Master to die suddenly. The sect to collapse and my grandfather perished in battle. If Dongfang You hadn’t come seeking a spirit item just then, we would have already...”

He sighed and said softly, “At this point, we truly can’t afford any more turmoil!”

Cui Changfu’s expression grew grim as he continued, “Moongaze Marsh lies in a land torn by four powers. Taiyi to the west, Taiqing to the south and east, and the Seven Releases to the north. What good position is that? Even Li Xunquan had True Monarchs aiding him and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators following him. Yet he still lost and died in defeat...

“This one is at least wise, not driven by greed to openly claim the name of Wei Li... but that’s as far as it should go. Only disaster awaits if we get too deeply involved with them!”

After hearing this, Cui Wanqing could only sigh and nod. Then she heard Cui Changfu say, “We must preserve our remaining lineage, only then will there be a chance to restore what was lost. If we follow any passing branch of the Wei Li bloodline without caution, that would be blind folly, with no hope at all!”

The conversation between the two members of the Cui family in Chongzhou naturally didn’t reach Li Qinghong’s ears. She rode the wind back on her journey, feeling a twinge of disappointment.

She had only made the request in the hope that the longstanding friendship between the Li and Cui Families might help. Even hearing a condition would’ve been something.

But Cui Changfu clearly wanted nothing to do with any karmic entanglements. His tone showed no softness. Li Qinghong saw this clearly, thus she didn’t push the matter and quickly took her leave.

“After all, so many years have passed, and the Cui Family suffered plenty of entanglements. They won’t trust easily...” muttered Li Qinghong.

The last immortal-devil war had ended with the Battle of Pingming Ford. Then Northern Qi replaced Wei, only to fall to Liang, which in turn was destroyed by Emperor Zhao’s father Fu Qiyan and King Yan, Murong Dechang. That was over sixteen hundred years ago. If the world hadn’t changed since, even a True Monarch would have long passed away, perhaps the old bonds had faded with time.

Later, when Dongli Sect was destroyed, many from the Cui Family died too. Showing even a decent attitude when facing someone from the Li Family, whose identity might not even be real... that’s already more than fair.

Thinking this way, Li Qinghong felt the Cui family’s reaction was understandable. She glanced westward and suddenly saw several Dawn Cloudliners tearing through the sky, leaving trails of Heavenly Glow behind.

The cloudliner was massive and radiated colorful light. Having paid tribute to one before, Li Qinghong instantly recognized it as the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner. Her heart jumped in alarm, Something’s happened inland!

Azure Pond Sect.

Azure Pond Sect was usually shrouded in mist and clear clouds. But perhaps due to the repeated failures and deaths during the breakthrough attempts to the Foundation Establishment Realm in recent months, the clouds now seemed much thinner.

From within the distant clouds, a streak of Heavenly Glow sped forth with six-colored trails. The man atop it was elegant and noble, it was none other than Li Xizhi.

Li Xizhi, riding the Heavenly Glow, rushed back from outside. As he entered the sect, he saw people bustling around. Landing atop Qingsui Peak, he was quickly greeted by his junior brother Yuan Chengzhao.

Yuan Chengzhao had not yet broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he was at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm. Holding a dharma artifact in hand, he looked a bit flustered.

Among this generation of the Yuan Family, only Yuan Chengdun had unmatched strength. He was one of the rare cultivators capable of contending with direct disciples of the great sects. Unfortunately, he had perished in the Eastern Sea. Of the remaining younger ones, only Yuan Chengzhao had any chance of a breakthrough.

The Yuan Family’s former pillar, Yuan Tuan, had also fallen in the Eastern Sea. Though the family's numbers remained intact, with these two core figures gone, they had no strong Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators left to speak of.

Though they now had the Chi Family’s support, pressure still loomed large. Yuan Chengzhao, staying in the sect, felt especially awkward. He sat blankly atop the peak and was unsure of how to face anyone.

Now, seeing his senior brother Li Xizhi, he was at even more of a loss, fumbling as he spoke, “Senior brother... I truly don’t know anything about the family’s affairs!”

“None of this is your fault, of course.” Li Xizhi frowned slightly, noticing with sharp eyes that Yuan Chengzhao’s clothes were thin yet immaculately white. It was subtly of higher quality than the average sect disciple’s garb.

He smiled gently and said, “What’s this? You’ve got new clothes now, I see.”

Yuan Chengzhao finally realized what was happening and was momentarily speechless. He then said in a low voice, “I... this... senior brother! Come with me up the mountain!”

Li Xizhi’s smile gradually faded. He followed quietly behind until they reached the small pavilion at the mountaintop, where the lights were dim and a piece of clothing lay draped messily over the desk.

Li Xizhi knew this little room like the back of his hand. With just one glance, he noticed that the sharp green-bladed sword that once hung on the wall had been taken down, it was nowhere to be seen.

Sweat formed on Yuan Chengzhao’s brow. He led Li Xizhi inside and, upon reaching the desk, dropped to his knees with a thud. He bowed in silence.

Li Xizhi seemed to have expected this. His expression was calm as his gaze swept over the robe draped on the desk.

The robe was a pale bluish-green, seamless in its make and glowed faintly with multicolored light. A silver ornament dangled awkwardly from the waist, haphazardly tossed on the corner of the desk.

Of course, Li Xizhi knew exactly what this garment was, it was the robe of the peak master.

Looking again at Yuan Chengzhao’s inner garments that were pure white and flowing, it was clear they were part of the same set as the robe on the desk. But with Li Xizhi’s sudden return, Yuan Chengzhao had only managed to remove the outer robe in a hurry, forgetting about the underlayer before rushing to meet him.

“Senior brother...”

The contrast made everything obvious. Yuan Chengzhao kept his head very low, sweating profusely. Yet Li Xizhi didn’t seem angry. His voice was cool as he asked, “The sword?”

Compared to the peak master’s position, it seemed he cared more about the sword that used to hang on the wall, the one once wielded by Li Chejing.

With Yuan Tuan’s whereabouts uncertain, Yuan Chengzhao had long lived under the discipline of his senior brother Li Xizhi, and had a deep sense of awe toward him. Now he was stumbling over his words.

“I... I...”

Although this senior brother was graceful and refined, back when he’d misbehaved, Li Xizhi had truly scolded him coldly and disciplined him with a ruler. Now, with red-rimmed eyes, he trembled as he said, “Senior brother! The Chi Family is coming... I was afraid they’d recognize uncle’s sword... so I hid it ahead of time!”

He hurriedly retrieved the sword from his storage pouch and offered it with both hands. Before Li Chejing had forged his spirit sword, he had used this very one to cultivate the Profound Water Sword Technique. The blade was simple, without any ornate designs.

Li Xizhi received it with both hands, then took out a jade box from his own storage pouch and carefully stored the sword away before speaking gently, “The Chi Family personally appointed you?”

Yuan Chengzhao nodded repeatedly, forcing himself to respond, “Yes... yes! They used the family as leverage, saying I absolutely had to take the peak master’s position...”

“Mm.” Li Xizhi’s expression didn’t change much. He nodded lightly, used one hand to help him up, and with the other, lifted the green robe from the desk and draped it over him, smiling as he said, “You, your cultivation is still a bit lacking. Once you reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, you’ll be able to hold the stage properly.”

Yuan Chengzhao began sweating even more, beads falling down as he muttered, “Senior brother! This was meant to be yours... I know the Master thought the same... it’s always been yours. I... I... had no power to resist...”

“What’s mine or yours!” Li Xizhi chuckled softly, patted his shoulder, and said gently, “I’ve returned after completing my task and still need to report to the main hall. Peak Master Yuan, you wait here first. Once I’m back, you and I shall have a proper drink.”

Yuan Chengzhao was at a complete loss and simply nodded. It wasn’t until Li Xizhi rode off on the Heavenly Glow light that he hastily pulled off the outer robe and tossed it back onto the desk, feeling as if he were in a dream, “Senior brother’s not angry at me... thank the heavens...”

He sat there dazed for a while, staring at the silver pendant that symbolized the position of peak master. His hands grew hot with excitement, and he couldn’t help but touch it twice.

Meanwhile, Li Xizhi rose on the wind, stepping through the moonlight and glow. His expression was gentle, but his eyes were cold. One hand was clasped behind his back, posture poised as he thought, Trying to manipulate me? You think this was Chi Zhiyun’s oversight? Unlikely!

What a clever ploy... Chengzhao’s not cunning, and he craves status, it’s only natural he’d fall into this trap. Qingsui Peak is still in the hands of the Yuan Family... nine out of ten, this was a reward for them. And in the end, they still get to strike a blow at me...

He looked refined and calm, wearing just the right trace of displeasure on his face, but inside there was no anger but only a cold smirk.

My Li Family has seven Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, the Profound Thunder Golden Bow, Bright Yang Rainbow Mist, and ties to the Xiao family in the east. Should anything arise, we could even force the Xiao, Ning, or Yang Families to intervene. We have so many cultivators across the peaks of Moongaze Lake. They’re a gift from the heavens, the perfect shield. Who among them would willingly give that up?

At this moment, the calm elegance Li Xizhi had cultivated since youth remained flawless, but inwardly his mind was calculating with precision. He was, after all, the son of Li Yuanjiao. On the surface, he seemed gentle but underneath, he had already seen everything with piercing clarity, At such a desperate moment, what else could this be but one hand wielding the stick, the other offering the sweet date? Very well... let’s see what kind of performance the esteemed masters put on next!
