# Chapter 1139: Changli

The Li Fire is the truest expression of flame. It neither waxes nor wanes. In the heavens, it is a radiant beacon of spiritual light; on the earth, a hidden brilliance concealed within Double Fire. It is of the second order of manifestation, the very pillar of True Fire. It is the scorching heat that incinerates metal and boils the seas, the fundamental power that masters the abyss and nourishes life.

His immortal foundation surged past the twelvefold tower of his soul as boundless illusions gave way. A brilliant light washed over the landscape of his mind, and crimson light dissolved, fragment by fragment. The youth with golden eyes and crimson robes lowered the hands he held clasped before his chest. In that instant, the mental vista—a sky filled with celestial beings and a man shackled in heavy golden chains—vanished as one, leaving nothing but a silent void.

A pair of deep golden eyes snapped open. The cold, decisive resolve from his vision, as unyielding as ancient ice, finally began to thaw. The gloom within the Profound Chamber started to recede.

A soft pop echoed.

Two golden-red embers flickered to life, and the dim Profound Chamber was flooded with an endless sea of apricot-hued light. Li Jiangqian’s eyes, now open, slowly scanned his surroundings. Within their usual brilliant gold, a faint crimson sheen now swirled. He stood unmoving amidst the boundless Li Fire, a faint smile gracing his lips.

'The Purple Mansion Realm, achieved!'

Yet he didn't move. Instead, he slowly closed his eyes, as if to contain a scorching power within. A sharp, stabbing pain flared between his heart and lungs, forcing him back a step. He drew a deep breath.

Pfft!

The next moment, an apricot-red halo burst from his lips. It rose before descending, hovering and swirling without end as motes of fire danced like the rustling leaves of a phoenix tree caught in an autumn wind.

He steadied his chest with one hand while raising the other. With two fingers, he plucked something from the swirling light, then clenched his fist. Straightening up, he smiled and opened his palm.

An apricot-yellow flame, no larger than a fingernail, danced in his palm. Its light was intensely bright, and a subtle, wondrous quality emanated from it, resonating with his very life-mandate. In an instant, like a bursting dam, it erupted in a flash of infinite golden-red!

The Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun states: "When the heart-fire is hidden and the sun has set, the south remains bright. By facing south, one governs the world."

'A fire born from the resonance of my life-mandate… This is a Purple Mansion-level flame!'

That pair of gold-and-crimson eyes swept through the hazy Li Fire. He raised his brows slightly, quickly realizing something was wrong.

The roiling Li Fire had reached its absolute peak the moment he broke through, yet this felt nothing like a typical Purple Mansion advancement. The Li Fire throughout the entire chamber was already decaying at an incredible rate, its color visibly fading before his eyes.

In the space of a single breath, darkness descended once more. Like a receding tide, it revealed dharma lamps that had been corroded to fragments by the Li Fire. A contemplative look appeared in the golden-eyed, crimson-robed man's eyes as he stared at the tightly sealed chamber door.

BOOM!

Riddled with holes from the corrosive Li Fire that had poured through it, the door shattered, revealing the scene outside.

The man outside the hall was an imposing figure with a terrifying aura. Golden patterns writhed on his ink-black robes, and his light purple feather cloak bloomed with intricate golden runes, forming a seamless whole. A king’s battle-axe hung inverted at his waist where a qilin seemed to leap into motion. In his hands, he held a wood-grained urn into which the last, thinned-out remnants of the Li Fire were pouring, with no hope of escape.

A pair of somber golden eyes shone from the darkness. His father’s gaze fell upon him.

'Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm!'

The man before him hadn’t unleashed any divine abilities, yet a fatal sense of danger washed over Li Jiangqian. He felt a moment of dazed confusion, and after the heart-stopping pressure passed, he was left in a state of profound shock.

'Three divine abilities?! How long has it been?'

The shock from Li Zhouwei was so immense that he stood stunned for a moment before noticing the middle-aged man at his side. He wore a white-gold Daoist robe, a dot of gold adorned his brow, and he exuded an air of carefree ease. The smile on his face was kind as he watched Li Jiangqian intently.

In the next instant, the young man’s face broke into a wide grin. With a shake of his robes, he crossed the distance in a few quick steps and knelt on one knee. His voice was sonorous and strong.

"Your son has not failed you! I have achieved a divine ability!"

He heard his father let out a laugh. He seemed to be in a good mood, his voice deep yet cheerful.

"Congratulations!"

That single word of congratulations dispelled the years of distance between them. A smile spread across Li Jiangqian’s face. His thoughts moved quickly, and he had already figured everything out.

"I’ve troubled you two Daoist Masters to stand guard… and to conceal my breakthrough for me!"

Li Ximing had just rushed back after receiving the news. Compared to Li Zhouwei’s stoicism, the joy on his face was undisguised.

"Rise and speak," he said warmly.

The newly advanced Daoist Master stood, his expression radiating high spirits.

"This junior has mastered the Great Parting Scripture. My heart-fire is now contained, and through resonance with my life-mandate, I have produced a new flame!"

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. He watched as Li Jiangqian opened his palm, and a surge of apricot-yellow flame erupted. It felt ancient and profound, its edges glowing with an amber Li Fire halo, its colors dazzling.

"A Purple Mansion Spirit Fire: the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire!"

"Hm?"

Li Zhouwei’s gaze shifted. He stared at the flame for a moment before reaching out and delicately plucking a wisp of it between his fingers.

The flame, so docile in Li Jiangqian’s hand, instantly swelled with violent power in Li Zhouwei’s grasp. It thrashed restlessly, radiating a destructive aura. But the faint scale-like patterns on Li Zhouwei's palm flashed once, and the flame was extinguished, leaving only a faint white mark on his skin.

Li Jiangqian knew better than anyone the true power of his Li Fire; his eyelids twitched as he watched. Li Zhouwei, however, merely offered praise.

"To think it has a sliver of the Supreme Yang’s might. Not bad."

Li Ximing was a true connoisseur of fire. His sharp gaze had long since identified the flame’s extraordinary nature, and he nodded in approval.

"Truly worthy of a sixth-grade technique! To be born with its own Purple Mansion Spirit Fire is remarkable. Even without any other unique properties, this alone is enough for you to stand firm among those with a single divine ability!"

"Indeed!"

Though he had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, Li Jiangqian’s attitude hadn't changed in the slightest. He lowered his eyes respectfully and said,

"Reporting to the Daoist Masters, this fire originates from the spell-type divine ability, the Great Parting Scripture. The 'Great' signifies immensity, a boundless expanse that alludes to the First Manifestation. 'Parting' refers to the fundamental, orthodox nature of the Li Fire. And 'Scripture' in this context means 'to record'—to use the vastness of the Manifestation and the orthodox nature of Parting to inscribe my Daoist arts!"

"For this reason, the Great Parting Scripture is also known as the Art of Gazing Upon and Describing the Sun. However, because the Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun emphasizes orthodox nature and the diligent cultivation of Li Fire, it is known by the former name."

Li Jiangqian paused before continuing.

"The character 'Li' is associated with the heart. This flame emerged through the resonance of my life-mandate, hence it is called a Heart-Fire. Its power is considerable, possessing an incinerating quality with a trace of the Supreme Yang’s demon-quelling might. And because it resonates with my life-mandate, it has gained an extra touch of the Bright Yang’s subtlety!"

Li Zhouwei already knew that Li Fire could resonate with one's life-mandate, but Li Ximing frowned as he listened.

"When you reached the Foundation Establishment Realm," he said softly, "you mentioned this art had a wondrous connection to the First Manifestation. I thought it was just a minor property, but I never imagined it would become so pronounced after achieving your divine ability. It’s often said that Li Fire is akin to Bright Yang, but I never thought it would also have ties to the Supreme Yang…"

Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"The First Manifestation is not named so for nothing. Is there any fire-virtue that does not yearn for the Supreme Yang? Even something as unruly as the Merging Fire has a lineage of spirit flames related to the Supreme Yang, to say nothing of Li Fire!"

Li Jiangqian nodded thoughtfully and continued, "Aside from the flame itself, the most wondrous aspect… is the Heart-Mansion."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. The crimson-robed youth smiled, and flames surged within his chest. His skin and flesh rippled like water, glowing with a deep red light. His heart and lungs had vanished. In their place, nestled within the cavity, was a small mansion with white bricks and red tiles, staggered in its architecture and glowing with a profound light.

"When ordinary cultivators absorb fire, they store it between the Juque and the Sea of Qi acupoints, or perhaps the Shengyang acupoint for the more talented. But my divine ability has reforged my organs, leaving only this Heart-Mansion to house the flame."

"The Heart-Mansion can directly consume Li Fire spiritual materials and woods with excellent effect. It can also contain and trap Spiritual Artifacts… though it’s far inferior to the Audience with the Celestial Gate ability, which specializes in confounding artifacts, it is still a decent tool."

"Furthermore, flames nurtured within the Heart-Mansion for many years will grow more attuned to me, harmonizing and becoming easier to control… I can even gather similar flames and refine them together within the mansion…"

A hint of bitterness touched his face as he added, "But… it still can’t compare to Grand-uncle’s Valley Wind Guide-Fire."

At his words, Li Ximing simply smiled.

"No need to prod me. I’m already on the verge of envying you!"

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian’s heart skipped a beat, already sensing what it meant. He pressed on, "And with the blessing of sunlight, the Great Parting Scripture excels at manipulating Li-Light. The Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun describes this as 'swallowing flame, plucking Li-Light.' The Heart-Mansion can refine Li-Light as well!"

"Beyond these abilities, the Great Parting Scripture is also of great use for movement. Whether traversing the mortal world or walking the Great Void, it provides a significant boost. If I were to cultivate a Great Void-walking technique, I could surely come and go as I please within the Great Void!"

"The other minor properties, such as being constantly wreathed in Li Fire or consuming wood to incinerate metal, are hardly worth mentioning."

Li Ximing, who had cultivated the Great Parting's White Brilliance, had been studying the Heart-Mansion of this new divine ability for some time. The more he looked, the more familiar it seemed. Now, hearing Li Jiangqian's explanation, he instantly understood.

"No wonder," he sighed. "No wonder the Great Parting's White Brilliance and the Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun are considered a set. They truly complement one another…"

Li Zhouwei, having listened to it all, spoke with a note of regret.

"If Grand-uncle had cultivated the Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun, the divine ability you possess today would be no less than that of Shilou Yingge or Murong Yan!"

But the man in the white-gold Daoist robe showed no sign of regret. Instead, he chuckled.

"If I had cultivated that Sutra, I likely wouldn’t have been able to achieve a divine ability at all without the proper Li Fire spiritual resources!"

He turned to Li Jiangqian and sighed softly.

"Now that you’ve also reached this realm, the family can finally breathe a sigh of relief."

With a wave of his hand, Li Zhouwei plucked an object from the Great Void.

It was perfectly round, like a Golden Core, and wreathed in countless golden threads. Leaping spiritual flames intertwined and swirled around it, shot through with iridescent colors. Streams of Li-Light pulsed from its poles, resembling fine golden threads that were exceptionally alluring.

The Li Fire Spiritual Treasure, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument!

This treasure had been suspended here for many years to aid Li Jiangqian in his breakthrough. Now that he had succeeded, it was finally free from its station!

Li Jiangqian’s eyes lit up at the sight of it. But this Li Fire Spiritual Treasure, a coveted item in all of Jiangnan, seemed to be nothing more than an ordinary object in Li Zhouwei’s eyes. With a casual toss, he threw the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument into his son's arms.

"Since you’ve achieved a divine ability," he said with a smile, "take it and use it!"

Li Jiangqian had received a promise of this from Li Ximing before and had been moved to tears at the time. He knew, however, that his father wouldn't be swayed by such displays. Overcome with joy, he let out a chuckle and tucked the treasure away without ceremony.

"Father is wise! This great kindness…"

"Enough! We’re family. There's no need for such politeness."

Li Zhouwei laughed, cutting him off, then his expression turned serious.

"Both the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and the Great Parting's White Brilliance require a Li Fire to fuel them. Your Southern Brightness Heart-Fire is rare, and it would be a waste to use it for that. Your grand-uncle has already made arrangements. You will have a suitable Li Fire when the time comes."

Li Jiangqian’s eyes grew even brighter with secret delight. He turned to Li Ximing, bowed respectfully, and shook his head.

"This junior has this one Li Fire, and it is enough. Grand-uncle possesses a Life Divine Ability and commands many spirit flames; their synergy produces a qualitative leap in power. Besides, a spirit flame is far too precious…"

Li Ximing shook his head slightly.

"There’s no need for modesty. While I have a knack for harmonizing flames, I’ve already taken on three and dare not add another. For a Bright Yang cultivator with no exceptional Dao-Profundity or Mandate of Heaven divine ability to harmonize three separate flames in a mere century of cultivation is already unheard of. If I continued to accept every spirit flame that came my way, wouldn’t that be a clear sign that something is amiss?"

Only then did Li Jiangqian nod, thanking him profusely. Li Zhouwei had not intervened. After listening, he handed his son a jade slip and gestured to the Heavenly Nurture Urn in his hand.

"This Heavenly Nurture Urn, combined with the Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam, has collected the phenomenon from your breakthrough. It is stored within the urn's power but has not yet been refined. Since it is the phenomenon from your own cultivation, you should spend some time to process it."

A smile touched his lips.

"A breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm can alter the very earth veins of a region. Capturing such a vast phenomenon cost this king a tremendous amount of dharma power. Even with significant losses during the collection, if you refine it properly, you are guaranteed to get at least one or two portions of Li Fire spiritual resources."

King Wei’s golden eyes flickered. He glanced at his son with amusement.

"And the thing you’ve been longing for is inside as well!"

Though he had expected it, Li Jiangqian still found it hard to believe. He accepted the Spiritual Treasure and connected his spiritual sense to it. From deep within, the blazing divine ability of an Upright Wood shone into his eyes!

It was a Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast!

His heart jolted with shock and joy.

"The Azure Talisman… it’s done, just like that!"

The surprise and excitement in his eyes were genuine. He took a deep breath, looked from his father to Li Ximing, and chose his words carefully.

"This junior has received a monumental kindness… I will say no more. If I can quickly solidify my divine ability, I will surely be of great help to the north and south… It’s just…"

Li Zhouwei understood his meaning.

"There is no rush. Breaking through in just ten years is already shocking enough. How could you possibly refine your second divine ability in one go? Fortunately, now that you have one, you can guide Talisman Qi. You may accept the Azure Talisman, but there is no hurry to raise your cultivation level."

Years ago, Li Zhouwei had set aside the refined essence from an Azure Talisman’s decree. Li Jiangqian had been hesitating, but these words made his eyes light up with satisfaction, and he nodded repeatedly.

Li Ximing exchanged a look with Li Zhouwei.

"Now that you have achieved a divine ability, there are certain methods we must teach you…" He smiled, his interest piqued. "But first… you should have a Daoist title."

This sentence truly sent Li Jiangqian into silent contemplation. He deliberated for a long moment, his golden eyes flickering, before a smile broke out on his face.

"Grand-uncle, your name heralds the bright dawn. Father, you are like the ascendant sun itself. This junior cultivates the Li Fire and serves you both. My only wish is that this Bright Yang will shine anew, and its light never fade…"

"The character 'Chang' represents the eternal sun. Therefore, let my title be Changli!"
