# Chapter 844: A Place of Secrets

A chill crept through Dangjiang. "Then what are you saying?" he asked.

Chi Buzi fixed him with an intense gaze, his pale azure eyes unwavering. "This is unavoidable," he began, his voice low. "The moment Pristine Water sees me, he'll grow suspicious of my cultivation. Do you really think he'll politely ask where I acquired the Chou-Gui Hidden Form, a Purple Mansion Realm technique? Whether I have it or not, he won't say a single word. He'll simply reach out and read my memories!"

"Once that happens, this will be about far more than a single Dharma Art!"

"And whether he finds anything or not, my death is certain. While you might remain safe in the heavens, you'll suffer a catastrophic loss and can forget about seeing anyone ever again."

Anxiety tightened its grip on Dangjiang. "What are you talking about? Weren't you chosen by the Immortal Lord? That True Monarch Lushui is only at the Golden Core realm. How could he possibly kill you?"

Chi Buzi shot him a somber look. "Chosen? What 'chosen'? When destiny presents an opportunity, the Immortal offers a path. If you can walk it, you do. If you fail, who cares if you die? Do you think the Immortal is short on Purple Mansion Realm cultivators? Is he going to return from beyond the heavens just to save me? It's one thing to borrow his name for a bit of clout, but you can't be naive enough to believe it's a guarantee of safety."

At his words, Dangjiang’s brow furrowed, his own anxiety mounting. 'He has a point,' he thought. 'Is there anyone in the heavens who doesn't possess some unfathomable power?'

Seeing Dangjiang at a loss for words, the hope in Chi Buzi’s heart faded into faint disappointment. "My cultivation is insignificant," he said. "But if something were to happen to me, I fear it would jeopardize the Celestial Palace's plans."

Dangjiang glanced at him as Chi Buzi continued, "I'm counting on you to plead on my behalf, to find a way out of this for me. If you could just get an audience with that Lord Zhengao from before, I believe there would be a chance."

Dangjiang hesitated. He himself needed Shaohui’s help just to see Zhengao, so he had little confidence. But this was a matter of life and death for Chi Buzi, a threat to his very path of cultivation. He had to try. He rose to his feet.

"You know how it is with that Lord," he said. "You can't just see him when you please. I only know the location of Lady Shaohui's celestial pavilion. I will go and ask for you."

But Chi Buzi was still filled with doubt.

He was a direct descendant of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and his mind was sharp. Over the years, he had learned more than a few secrets. He grabbed Dangjiang's arm. "The Immortal Lord… he governs yin and yang. It’s possible he has an incarnation in the mortal world. Ages ago, there was an immortal named Yingze who also held dominion over yin and yang. I wonder if they could be one and the same."

The suggestion made Dangjiang’s scalp tingle with dread. He wouldn't dare speculate on such a thing. "You want me to ask about the Immortal Lord's mortal incarnation? First, I have nowhere to ask. Second, I don't have the lifespan to survive asking! I couldn't even find out the name Immortal Official Li used when he descended to the mortal realm. This is a profound secret, a matter of celestial mystery. How could I possibly have the authority to inquire?"

"I'm not asking you to investigate..."

Chi Buzi looked at him, a headache forming. He knew for a fact that many people in the world were searching for Yingze, but the immortal never appeared, which was a deeply ominous sign. "This Pristine Water," he explained, "is known as one of the Six Scions of Chongming. His master *is* that immortal who governs yin and yang. He belongs to the orthodox Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition, and the number of immortals in his lineage is more than you can count on one hand. I’m not afraid of him picking a fight with the heavens. I’m afraid of what he might uncover, and the upheaval it could cause."

As Chi Buzi spoke, Dangjiang felt his blood run cold. His memories of a past life were of a minor water official in the Underworld; he had no frame of reference for figures of such terrifying power. "I understand," he said, his voice laced with fear.

"Be subtle," Chi Buzi urged. "Ask carefully."

At the instruction, Dangjiang lifted his head again. Masking his unease, he strode out, grumbling as he went, "Hmph. When it comes to delicate words, you think you're better than me? I don't need your coaching!"

He left through the courtyard gate. Only then did Chi Buzi allow himself to sit back down. He was, after all, in another's grotto-heaven. Even when alone, he dared not reveal a hint of emotion. He closed his eyes, entering a meditative state right where he sat.

White snow drifted down around him, slowly blanketing the courtyard. The fragrant scent of osmanthus blossoms filled the air—a scene that should have brought peace to one’s mind. But as he sat in stillness, his heart was a raging storm.

Chi Buzi’s words had been both a plea for help and a test. In that brief exchange, he had gauged Dangjiang’s position and keenly identified the crucial truth: he, Chi Buzi, was not important to the heavens. The Immortal's favor had been a casual gesture, and Zhengao had given Dangjiang no special orders concerning him.

This single piece of information gave rise to a deep-seated suspicion in the man's dark and cynical mind.

'This Immortal Lord is almost certainly Yingze. But he's been missing for years, which means he doesn't want the world to know of his existence. He must be advancing some secret plot. His relationship with Pristine Water can't be good. Since he's an immortal, the opportunity he gave me would never expose himself, nor would it allow Pristine Water to have any suspicions.'

'Once Pristine Water probes my memories, he'll find nothing. As for me... because I failed to complete my tasks before his return, I'll lose my life. No matter what Pristine Water does to me, my end will be a silent, unnoticed death. So, what role does Zhengao play in this? The method for seeking a Golden Core is priceless. How could I possibly earn it in just a few short years?'

He smelled a trap. A shadow instantly fell over his heart.

'Could it be that they're just using me? Making me hunt Demons for them all these years, knowing my offerings would never be enough. Then, when Pristine Water returns, I die, and that's that. They've already profited handsomely. They never had to find me a path to the Golden Core at all.'

Although Chi Buzi knew little about the true power behind the Immortal Palace, his mind worked in a particular way. He could extrapolate an outcome from the barest threads of self-interest in an instant. The conclusion was chilling: if his fortuitous encounter was not a deliberate part of some grand celestial scheme against Pristine Water, then the heavens would never disrupt their established plans for a pawn like him. He would most likely be left to die at the hands of Pristine Water.

***

Meanwhile, Dangjiang left the courtyard, walking with his head lowered. After a short while, he found a large pavilion within the palace. He presented his token, and a heavenly soldier went inside to announce him.

Soon, the soldier, clad in shimmering, scale-like armor and possessing handsome features, emerged. "Proofreader of the Profound Seven Pavilion," he announced in a clear voice, "the Celestial Attendant will see you."

Dangjiang had worried he would be turned away. Flooded with relief, he hurried forward, passed through a magnificent corridor, and entered a room where stacks of silvery-white jade slips were piled high. A woman in tea-white robes sat primly at a desk.

Shaohui looked weary. The stark white glow between her brows flickered faintly, a clear sign that recent days had not been easy. Seeing Dangjiang was no longer as irritating as it once was. "So it's you," she said. "Has something happened?"

Although Shaohui had been reassigned, Dangjiang was still nominally her subordinate, which was why he had been granted an audience. He immediately prostrated himself and cried out, "Years ago, Immortal Official Liu entrusted me with the duty of looking after the talented individual selected by the Immortal Lord! But now he has encountered a heavenly calamity and his life is in peril! I came to ask for your guidance, my lady!"

Shaohui frowned at his words. She knew he was talking about Chi Buzi. She had no time for such trivial matters, but she also wanted to avoid any blame. "What sort of trouble?" she asked.

"It's the same matter as before," Dangjiang said from the floor. "The True Monarch who oversees his Fruition Attainment, True Monarch Lushui, is about to return from beyond the heavens. My subordinate's breakthrough was achieved through a connection I facilitated, a connection that leads back to the heavens. The True Monarch will likely seek him out, and we fear it will cause trouble."

Shaohui shook her head. "Who would dare make trouble for the heavens? Let him be. When that True Monarch hears the heavens are involved, he won't kill him. The only issue is that the heavens have not yet revealed themselves to the mortal world. A sudden exposure might draw the ire of those above."

Shaohui's words resonated with Dangjiang's deepest fears. He wasn't as concerned about Pristine Water as the cautious Chi Buzi was; he was terrified of messing up the plans of his superiors. After he finished his obeisance, Shaohui spoke.

"Wait here. I will go and see the Lord."

Overjoyed, Dangjiang nodded eagerly and began to wait in the pavilion. After an anxious half-hour, there was finally movement. The woman in the tea-white celestial dress re-entered the pavilion, her expression thoughtful.

Seeing Shaohui step inside, Dangjiang hurried forward and asked respectfully, "My lady?"

Shaohui gave a slight shake of her head. "I consulted the Lord and received a few pieces of information. I will share them with you."

Her expression turned grave. She spoke with deliberation. "First, the Lord has issued no decree. The Immortal Lord taught him a Dharma Art merely as a reward for watching over you. He has no other connection to the heavens. It is not yet time for the heavens to manifest in the world. If he is captured by this Pristine Water, the trail of the immortals will simply go cold. There is no risk of exposing any trace of the heavens."

The words left a bitter taste in Dangjiang's mouth. He finally understood the full weight of Chi Buzi's suspicions.

Shaohui continued, "Second, considering his sincere desire for immortality, Lord Zhengao has left him a sliver of a chance. If he truly feels that Pristine Water will harm him, he may request a celestial official from the heavens to assess his situation and see if there is any room for maneuver."

Dangjiang's heart sank. "And which official might he request?" he asked weakly.

A wry, helpless smile touched Shaohui's lips. "Me."

She rose from behind the desk. "Go on. Bring him here."

Dangjiang had no choice but to retreat. He hurried back to the courtyard, where Chi Buzi sat unmoving at the table. With a grim face, Dangjiang quietly relayed the two messages.

Chi Buzi, however, let out a sigh of relief. He lowered his head. "Good. Take me to see her."

The news Dangjiang brought was not surprising. Chi Buzi had anticipated that Zhengao would leave him a path to survival, however narrow. This was enough. In fact, he had felt the shadow of this danger looming for a long time.

'The moment I went to that island to see Li Qinghong, I had to be prepared to be crushed by Pristine Water at any time. His return is neither unexpected nor premature.'

Back when he had spoken to Li Qinghong of betraying Pristine Water, Chi Buzi had only one thought:

'If I die, I die. I have to try!'

His resolve today was exactly the same.

He lowered his head, a look of grim satisfaction and burning ambition on his face. He wound his way through corridors past celestial generals and attendants, climbed the steps of the pavilion, and slowly approached Shaohui's desk. With a thud, he fell to his knees.

"Many thanks to my lady for saving my life!" he said with utmost respect.

Shaohui had never liked him, but seeing a great Daoist Master prostrate himself before her so completely, she composed herself and said softly, "Do you have a plan?"

Chi Buzi looked up, his pale azure eyes bright and full of spirit, without a trace of despair. "I am unwilling to give up this chance to enter the grotto-heaven and meet the immortals," he said in a low voice. "Nor am I willing to abandon my path. The only strategy now is to deceive Pristine Water."

"And to deceive him, I must not remember anything myself. As long as I know I'm lying, the True Monarch will know I'm lying."

Shaohui studied his expression. Though she had always disliked the man before her, she couldn't help but be moved by his conviction. "Continue," she said.

"I believe the only way for me to not know is to have my memories removed and stored somewhere else," Chi Buzi said softly. "After Pristine Water has inspected me and left, the memories can be returned. Only then can I escape his scrutiny. Once he returns to the Pristine Speech Heaven to recuperate, it will be much harder for him to keep an eye on me."

Shaohui frowned slightly as Chi Buzi continued, "I need a method to alter my memories right under the nose of a True Monarch without being discovered."

The celestial attendant before him shook her head. "It's more complicated than that. No jade slip can be used to record memories related to the heavens. The only way is to peel away a part of your soul to store them. But splitting a soul is far beyond the abilities of you or me."

"Besides," she added, "the pain of splitting one's soul is worse than being flayed alive."

Chi Buzi had not even considered the pain.

From his humble beginnings in the Azure Pond to his current station, he, Chi Buzi, had survived by unscrupulously seizing every opportunity that flashed before him. No matter how small the chance, even if it was a mere crack, he would scrape bone and shed skin to squeeze through it like a weed.

Chi Wei, Zhengao, Demons, or gods—whatever the powers that be needed him to be, Chi Buzi would become. With the Golden Core realm ahead, nothing was too precious to discard, and nothing was too bitter to accept.

'By my power alone, even if I were flayed alive a thousand times, I could never escape Pristine Water's grasp. He would crush me like an ant. But I don't need much. With just a sliver of assistance from a power on his level, I will have the right to deceive him.'

But upon hearing Shaohui's words, Chi Buzi did not nod in agreement. A chill went through him. "If I split my soul, how could Pristine Water not see it?" he countered.

"He won't waste time wondering what tricks I have up my sleeve. He doesn't need to. He won't bother with countermeasures. The moment he sees a matter involving a Golden Core breakthrough that could shake his Fruition Attainment, combined with a profound technique like soul-splitting, he won't permit anyone to interfere. He'll ignore any pressure from the Underworld and kill me with a single glance."

Shaohui pondered this for a moment. "I can ask about a method for separating memories," she said quietly. "Perhaps there is a spiritual artifact that can accomplish it. But how can you guarantee Pristine Water will leave? If he is as cunning as you say, he might return without a trace and leave just as stealthily. Without your memories, how will you know when to restore them? It's practically impossible!"

"Furthermore, even if you wait for him to leave and regain your memories, how will you know when he might suddenly reappear? A Golden Core cultivator can manifest in the mortal world in an instant! If the thought ever crosses his mind, he only needs to take half a step out of the Pristine Speech Heaven, and he'll immediately know everything!"

Seeing Shaohui shaking her head repeatedly, Chi Buzi remained calm. "This may seem difficult," he said in a low voice, "but in truth, I only need those memories when it is time to make an offering."

"As long as you, my lady, can find a way for me to deceive his eyes, I can arrange it so that I am drawn to hunt Demons, arrive at a certain secret location where I will remember this matter, make my offering to the heavens, and then forget it all again before I leave."

Shaohui's expression grew serious. She stared intently into his eyes, a deep and profound doubt surfacing. "Is there truly a secret place that even a True Monarch cannot see?"

Chi Buzi's eyes narrowed slightly. As he looked down, his expression took on an icy, calculated calm.

"I do, in fact, know of such a place. A corner of the world that even a True Monarch cannot perceive."
