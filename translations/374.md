# Chapter 469: The Meng Father and Daughter

Moongaze Lake was a thousand li away from Mount Azure Pond. Even a Qi Cultivator flying at full speed without rest would need two days and two nights to make the journey. Including time spent in meditation and resting, it would take about six to seven days for a round trip, meaning half a month would easily pass by.

Moreover, the Azure Pond Sect's territory was far from peaceful, with many large mountains that had to be avoided. Li Yuanjiao's letter was entrusted to the Yuan Family to deliver, and it took more than a month to receive a reply.

The Yuan Family valued the Li Family greatly. Since Yuan Huyuan was in seclusion, the letter was delivered by his eldest son. He respectfully handed it over, exchanged a few polite words, and then took his leave.

"...Handwritten on the evening of the 28th of Spring. Congratulations to Father for breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm... Does the family know about the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven? If you have acquired items from there, those below the Foundation Establishment Realm can safely be used, but any Purple Mansion Realm spirit medicines, secret techniques, or manuals must be sent to Azure Pond without delay...

...I have benefited greatly from the Eastern Fire. Yesterday, I reached the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Brother Ming is still young, so I hope Father will not be too harsh on him... I have also obtained several pill recipes in the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven, which I am enclosing with this letter. The family can profit from them, but do not spread them outside the family...

...As for Brother Jun's Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual, I have asked the Yang Family, and they said that there is no Purple Mansion Realm legacy of this technique in Yue State. However, there are some traces in the far northwest of Wu State, so he can continue his cultivation with peace of mind without worry."

After reading the letter, Li Yuanjiao exhaled deeply, a hint of satisfaction appearing on his face.

"Zhi'er has already investigated and found the answer before I could even ask about Xijun's matter. With this information, Jun'er can cultivate that technique without any worries."

Attached to the end of the letter was a small bead containing several pill recipes. The bead was crystal clear and quite beautiful. Li Yuanjiao examined it thoughtfully, musing to himself, Azure Pond's methods are indeed impressive... This bead is much more convenient to carry around than a jade slip.

He then channeled his spiritual sense into the bead and saw two pill recipes‚ÄîThree Aspects Breaking Realm Pill and Two Ways of Refining Renewal Spirit Pill, both of which were extremely difficult to refine and highly valuable.

Li Yuanjiao put the items away, thinking to himself, I should help Ximing break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm first and then study these two recipes... Azure Pond's spiritual qi is abundant, and Zhi'er is highly talented. With focused cultivation, he has even surpassed Ming'er.

With that thought, he leaped into the air, passed through the formation on Qingdu Peak, and descended toward the lake.

The weather was cold, and the dark green waters of the lake were still covered with pieces of floating ice. As he approached the lake's surface, waves surged and the dark green water rose, sending the ice crashing together with a crackling sound.

A large black serpent's head, as big as a carriage, slowly emerged from the water. Demonic qi surged, and spiritual light flashed as Li Wushao transformed into a black-clad youth, cupping his fist in greeting.

"Wushao greets Master!"

He bowed his head, exuding a powerful aura, and respectfully reported, "As per your orders, I have swept the five peaks along the shore and tamed three Qi Cultivation Realm demons and twenty-five Embryonic Breathing Realm ones, collecting twenty-six types of spirit items."

The demon lightly clapped his hands, stirring the water with his mana as he called out, "Come out, all of you!"

With that, the dark green waters split open as three demons flew out, clumsily standing upright in midair, suspended by demonic wind.

Li Yuanjiao glanced at them‚Äîa pair of fat green fish demons, one large and one small, were at mid and early stages of Qi Cultivation Realm respectively, and there was also a black lake turtle at the early stage of Qi Cultivation Realm, hovering nervously in the air.

With a casual wave of his hand, the three demons were dismissed with great relief. Li Wushao cupped his fist and continued, "Your servant has scouted the lake near the eastern shore and found no Foundation Establishment Realm demons. I have already sent some underlings to search deeper into the lake."

"As for the matter Family Head mentioned, Wushao has already identified several areas along the lake with strong spiritual energy. I have also sent the two green fish demons to seek out spirit juvenile fish that can channel spiritual energy for cultivation..."

Li Wushao continued, "I have also scouted the lakebed twice with An Zheyan and identified three locations with underground spirit veins that may contain mineral deposits. I have sent a group of lesser demons to dig and investigate; news should arrive soon."

"Good!" Li Yuanjiao nodded with satisfaction.

It had not been easy to tame a Foundation Establishment Realm demon, and to use Li Wushao merely as a bodyguard would have been a waste. Water creatures naturally admired strength and loved to gather in groups, and a Foundation Establishment Realm demon like Li Wushao held significant influence around the lake. Previously, the lake had only been a source of spirit items, but now, it could finally be fully developed.

Breeding spirit fish, collecting spirit items, mining veins, and gathering intelligence... These Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realm demons are different from human cultivators. They don't need to rely on Water Avoidance Spell to move freely on the lakebed, making them very efficient workers.

A small smile appeared on Li Yuanjiao's face.

And most importantly, there's no need to pay these demons a clan stipend!

Li Wushao noticed that Li Yuanjiao appeared to be in a good mood and secretly breathed a sigh of relief before saying, "These little ones have already become my subordinates, but they lack any protective talismans. Whenever rogue cultivators pass by the lake, they often catch one or two of them on a whim..."

Li Yuanjiao nodded and instructed, "Go to the Jade Court Guards and retrieve some identification jade tokens. Distribute them to the creatures of the Jade Capital Stage for protection. For those below the Jade Capital Stage, organize them into groups. Passing rogue cultivators will give our family some respect and no longer cause trouble."

"Understood!" Li Wushao responded promptly.

Li Yuanjiao then asked, "Since the demons in the lake are difficult to track, in your opinion, are there any Foundation Establishment Realm creatures near the sea entrance of Lake Xian that we could capture?"

After recruiting Li Wushao, the Li Family now had one fewer Foundation Establishment Realm creature to offer as a sacrifice for Ximing and Xijun's talisman qi. Li Yuanjiao had sent Li Wushao to search the lakebed for a while, but the demons there were quite cunning and elusive. As a result, Li Yuanjiao decided to turn his attention to the Eastern Sea.

Li Wushao replied, "In my opinion, aside from that Azure Water Serpent Dragon, the others near the sea entrance are all mediocre. If you wish to capture one, I am afraid..."

Li Yuanjiao shook his head, and Li Wushao immediately understood.

"With the formation plate in your hand, the creatures in the lake won't be an issue, Master. To kill or capture them is merely a matter of your will."

Li Yuanjiao nodded.

"In that case, capture a creature quickly before Kong Tingyun comes."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

As Li Yuanjiao and Li Wushao flew eastward, Li Qinghong went to Mushroom Forest Plain to enter seclusion, leaving Qingdu Peak rather empty. Li Ximing spent his days cultivating in the courtyard, with only Li Xijun guarding the mountain.

As the cold had not yet receded, Qingdu Peak, being quite tall, still had some snow at its summit. Li Xijun, who cultivated the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique, had taken advantage of the heavy snowfall in the previous months to break through to the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Having just come out of seclusion, he had not touched his sword for some time and was eager for a duel. He went around the mountain looking for opponents, eventually dragging Li Wen out of the Qingdu Cave Dwelling to spar with him.

Although Li Wen had reached the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, he was no match for Li Xijun in combat. His pair of heavy mace were particularly cumbersome while Li Xijun's sword technique was swift and agile, leading to his repeated defeats.

Dressed in white, Li Xijun wielded his sword, parrying Li Wen's two heavy maces to either side and then lightly tapping his sword against Li Wen's chest. He won three matches in a row, giving the burly man a good thrashing.

The burly man muttered a word or two under his breath, unable to come up with any words of flattery. He simply dropped his maces and fell to the ground, then said, "Young master... you are truly formidable."

Having just broken through to the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, Li Xijun's eyes sparkled with vitality.

"Brother Wen, your cultivation is commendable. Among the family branches, you are the only outstanding one. I hope you will continue to cultivate diligently and not fall behind," he said warmly.

The Li Family did not have many members in the Qi Cultivation Realm. Besides Li Xuanxuan, Li Xicheng from the foot of the mountain, Li Xijun himself, and Li Ximing in the alchemy room, Li Wen was their most trusted member.

Li Wen practiced the rapid cultivation method, Guardian of the Courtly Path, and became a Qi Cultivator before the age of thirty. While progress slowed down after reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm, his straightforward mind and diligent pursuit of the Dao allowed him to reach the third heavenly layer. He was on par with some of the external cultivators like Chen Mufeng.

Li Xijun had a positive opinion of this honest and loyal man, often seeking him out to practice combat techniques. Li Wen, in turn, did not disappoint, making significant progress over the past two years.

Li Wen nodded as he listened, his voice a low hum.

"I understand, young master."

Li Xijun smiled faintly as he sheathed his sword, and mentally calculated the days, thinking to himself, Ximing spends his days refining pills, yet his cultivation hasn't fallen behind much. At twenty-three years old, he's already at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. If I give him the white talisman from the pig demon, he might reach the fifth heavenly layer. If he reaches the eighth within seven years, with the help of talisman pills, our family could have a genius achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm in his thirties!

Thinking of this, Li Xijun mumbled to himself, "Perhaps I should ask Uncle Ping to relieve him of some more burdens..."

As he pondered these thoughts, Li Xijun walked for a while on Qingdu Peak, eventually arriving at the Alchemy Pavilion. He paused at the entrance, his expression turning strange when he heard moanings and grunting coming from within.

"My dear..."

After some time, the woman in the courtyard withdrew, and only then did Li Xijun step inside. He saw Li Ximing looking very relaxed while holding a jade slip, a satisfied expression on his face.

"Brother Ming," Li Xijun called out.

Li Ximing, seeing Li Xijun enter, put down the jade slip and tightened his belt, then smiled.

"What brings you here today?"

Li Xijun, who was naturally restrained in his behavior, frowned slightly, feeling the urge to reprimand him. However, seeing that Li Ximing was in a rare good mood, he decided not to spoil it and instead asked tactfully, "Where did that woman come from?"

Li Ximing replied, "She's a concubine from the Dou Family. It is difficult for cultivators in the Qi Cultivation Realm to have children... So, in my leisure time, I..."

Li Xijun let out a long breath as he noticed Li Ximing's anxious expression, and could not help but laugh.

"You are quite the lover of pleasures... I wonder who you take after."

Li Ximing forced a smile and said awkwardly, "Please, do not tease me."

Seeing that his brother's cultivation had indeed progressed with a growing aura, Li Xijun could not resist asking, "How long until you break through to the fourth heavenly layer?"

"About a year and a half," Li Ximing replied as if it were a matter of course.

Li Ximing had already broken through to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and Li Xizhi was at the fourth heavenly layer. Li Xijun sighed, "Your talent is truly enviable."

Li Xizhi was five or six years older than the two of them, so his higher cultivation level was expected. But with Li Ximing, who was of a similar age, it was different. He spent his days refining pills, occasionally reading alchemy texts, and in his leisure time, invited performers to listen to music, and was truly living a carefree life.

Li Xijun, on the other hand, spent his days diligently cultivating and honing his swordsmanship, yet he was still overshadowed, falling further behind with each step.

The cultivation gap between them was growing.

Fortunately, Li Xijun had a strong will and despite his frustrations, he maintained a calm demeanor. Although the two brothers had once had a big argument, Li Xijun, feeling guilty, could not stay angry for long. Meanwhile, Li Ximing, who had thoroughly enjoyed himself, felt comfortable, and there was no lingering resentment between them.

As Li Xijun pondered, Li Ximing shook his head thoughtfully and said, "Actually, every time I engage in such intimate acts, I feel an improvement in my cultivation. The radiant essence within me becomes more active, like a blazing fire... Perhaps that is why I have been able to break through to the third heavenly layer so quickly."

"Is that so?" Li Xijun was slightly taken aback, looking at him skeptically. "Are you sure you are not just making excuses to indulge yourself?"

Li Ximing feigned anger. "What are you talking about!"

The two laughed for a while, but then Li Xijun suddenly gazed into the distance, noticing two beams of light approaching from the east. They were intercepted by the Jade Court Guards as they neared the boundary and hovered in the air for some time.

"I'll go take a look," Li Xijun said softly before taking to the air. Due to the nature of his cultivation technique, the wind he summoned was cold and biting. In the lingering chill of the weather, he traveled swiftly and reached the Jade Court Guards within just two breaths.

The Jade Court Guard in front of him was from the Chen Family. Having just broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, he cupped his fist in salute upon seeing Li Xijun and reported in a steady voice, "My lord, these two claim to have been sent by the Xiao Family. They say they are here to see the ancestor and have a letter personally written by the Xiao Family's ancestor."

Li Xijun swept his spiritual sense over the two individuals, observing that one was an older man and the other a young woman. The old man had a dignified face with thick eyebrows and large eyes, and had reached the ninth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm. The woman, with fair skin and good looks, was only at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. She stood slightly to the side, glancing at him discreetly.

Seeing that the old man was at the ninth heavenly layer of his cultivation, Li Xijun subtly increased the distance between them before asking, "I am Li Xijun of the Li Family. May I ask which elder of the Xiao Family you have been sent by, and what is your purpose?"

The old man cupped his fist in response, saying, "I am Meng Taizhi, merely a rogue cultivator. Many years ago, while cultivating around the vicinity of the sword gate, I befriended ancestor Yuansi. Since my daughter's cultivation progress was lacking, he recommended that we come to the lake to find a place to gather the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth."

He then gestured to the young woman beside him. The woman, well-mannered and composed, bowed respectfully and said softly, "I am Meng Zhuoyun... Greetings, Senior."

Li Xijun accepted the letter handed to him by the Jade Court Guard but did not open it immediately. Instead, he used his mana to inspect it and, upon recognizing the familiar style of it, believed their story a little more.

"Please wait here for a moment. I will consult with my elders."

He then pointed out a place within the town for them to settle temporarily, instructing the Jade Court Guards to keep an eye on them before flying toward Lijing Town.

As a cultivator of Qingdu Peak, Li Xijun held a high status within the clan. He passed through the central hall where his uncle Li Yuanping sat at the head, with Li Xicheng listening beside him attentively.

By the time Li Xijun finished reporting the situation, Dou Yi had already unfolded the letter and presented it to Li Yuanping.

"...The Meng father and daughter have come to gather spiritual qi under the favor of our family's connection. They intend to stay for approximately twenty years. You need not treat them as guests out of regard for me, but they may be treated as guest cultivators and placed as you see fit. After twenty years, they may stay or leave at their discretion...

Daoist Taizhi is skilled in refining mineral essences, while his daughter, Zhuoyun, has trained under an alchemist overseas. They can both greatly contribute to your clan..."

Li Yuanping scanned the letter, confirming it was indeed written in Xiao Yuansi's handwriting. He then said, "Since it is at the request of ancestor Yuansi, send someone to ask the Meng father and daughter what they require and find a suitable place for them to get settled in."

Li Xicheng nodded in agreement, saying, "I will first test their abilities, then report back to the clan head."

Li Yuanping nodded. Xiao Yuansi's intention was clear‚Äîthis was a mutually beneficial arrangement for both the Meng Family and the Li Family, and it was a kind gesture. While the Li Family might not urgently need these two, it was a rare opportunity to repay Xiao Yuansi's favor, and they should respond appropriately.

He coughed twice, frowning as he added, "Remember to have someone keep an eye on them."

Li Xicheng agreed, respectfully saying, "The family's sacrificial ritual has already been arranged, awaiting only the return of Second Uncle and Senior Wushao."
