# Chapter 1065: Overlook

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Heavenly Light drifted through the mountains, where white flowers tumbled like waves. Li Ximing sat peacefully atop the summit, his aura stable. He held a secret letter, lost in silent contemplation.

'So, Fuxun... has actually established a cave in the sea.'

Li Ximing put the letter away, his gaze lowered as he mulled it over.

'Both Ying Hebai and the Xu Water Demon King came back then... But just looking at them, it was hard to tell if they truly understood the mysteries involved. Thankfully, Que'Wan has already left. Otherwise, according to Senior Liu's letter, Fuxun might have returned for a visit. The Wave-Suppressing Mansion is no place for secluded cultivation.'

After returning from the Nine Mounds, Li Ximing had naturally gone straight to Chongzhou. That Cui Changfu was now utterly deferential, constantly at his side. The moment Li Ximing stated his purpose, the Daoist Master immediately plunged into the sea to find Huiyao. Clearly, the Cui clan's entire attitude had been turned upside down.

Li Ximing was no stranger to this place; he had been a dignified Purple Mansion Realm expert back then, too. The only thing that could make the Cui clan so terrified was, of course, the visit from Li Zhouwei.

'Minghuang paid a visit, and that very night, Cui Changfu achieved his divine ability. The Cui clan was clearly terrified. Cui Changfu is actually older than I am, another dignified Purple Mansion Realm expert, yet he actually called himself "junior".'

Huiyao, that minor Demon, had been promoted time and again thanks to his connection to the Li family. He held nothing back, not daring to show the slightest neglect, which made the trip quite smooth. If there was one regret... it was only that Cui Jueyin was already in seclusion, and they had been unable to meet.

The Dragon-kin had not been slow to act. When Li Ximing returned to the lake from Chongzhou two years ago, he had already received Liu Changdie's reply. The letter also mentioned that the Wave-Suppressing Mansion had been protected by the Dragon-kin back then, for which Liu Changdie was eternally grateful.

The letter had given Li Ximing quite a fright. Only then did he understand that when Changxiao had hatched his plot, it was his own aunt who had intervened. But Liu Changdie hadn't fully believed the Xu Water Demon King's words, and neither did Li Ximing. He sneered internally:

'Back then, Aunt clearly said she wouldn't interfere. She wouldn't even see me when I fled to the Lie Sea. Those words must have been false. Perhaps it was for Minghuang's sake, or perhaps someone was making a move behind Liu Changdie's back. It certainly wasn't out of any personal sentiment.'

Now, intelligence from the sea was streaming in. He heard Fuxun had established a small Demon Cave on that island and sent out subordinates to gather news. The word was his injuries still hadn't healed, and he was searching for some Lesser Yang cultivator to heal him.

Liu Changdie was truly a loyal man; he was still writing back and forth to ask about this on Fuxun's behalf. Li Ximing, naturally, played dumb. It wasn't that he was heartless—he truly didn't have the guts to get involved. He only offered Liu Changdie a tactful reminder as he picked up his brush:

'The Demon King is now under the command of the Dragon-kin and cannot act rashly. You two should meet less often. If you absolutely must see him, Senior, please go to his island... It's better to avoid giving people grounds for gossip.'

Liu Changdie had reached the Purple Mansion Realm all on his own; he was a smart man. A hint was all he needed. He would naturally find a way to justify his actions.

He set the letter down. Beside him, Guo Nanwu looked over with a smile. Li Ximing flicked his sleeve, and a white jade bottle appeared on the table. He nodded to Guo Nanwu and chuckled.

"These pills for your Lesser Yang Dao were surprisingly difficult to refine. I suspect it's because the Lesser Yang begets yin, and the furnace possesses the Valley Visage. When yin and the Visage combine, they birth dampness and cold... Fortunately, the difficulty wasn't too high. I managed to get seven pills from one batch."

Guo Nanwu's heart sank at the first half of the sentence, but by the time Li Ximing finished, his face was wreathed in smiles. He praised:

"Senior's Dao-Profundity is astounding, and your alchemy skills are superb! We juniors are endlessly impressed!"

Li Ximing never thought he'd see the day his own Dao-Profundity was being flattered. He hastily swallowed his amusement. Seeing Guo Nanwu about to pay for the pills, he simply waved his hand in refusal.

He had successfully refined several batches of pills in the last two years, but the most important was the Sima Family's batch of Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder. He had secretly held back another two pills and hidden them carefully, intending them for Li Zhouwei.

When he returned from overseas, his cultivation had actually suffered somewhat because of the Yan Dushui incident. But he understood that his past cultivation speed during the Audience with the Celestial Gate had been a fluke, aided by the Talisman Pill and several other spirit pills. His own future cultivation path stretched out indefinitely. He just took a few pills from his own reserves to tide himself over, unwilling to use the precious Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder.

Guo Nanwu was indeed short on funds and accepted with gratitude. Li Ximing raised his cup, his eyes on the pills. He suddenly remembered that the man right in front of him _was_ a Lesser Yang cultivator, and he instantly became vigilant.

'…Everything is connected... Guo Nanwu is very useful right now. I can't let him get dragged in by Fuxun!'

He smiled at him and asked,

"Nanwu, have you been to the Eastern Sea at all in recent years?"

Guo Nanwu gathered his green sleeves, seeming to ponder the meaning behind the words. He hesitated.

"Not often. My family's juniors go more frequently... A lot has happened there, but I've been wary of the Eastern Sea's depths and haven't had a chance to investigate... I asked Daoist Master Kuang Yu about it a few days ago, and I was thinking of going to take a look."

As he spoke, his eyes carefully observed Li Ximing's reaction. Li Ximing immediately misunderstood, suspecting this was a lure from the figures behind Fuxun. He probed:

"Eastern Sea... I don't go there often anymore. The area around Deer Weeds Island is being watched by my enemies. It's dangerous. The world is in turmoil; it's not a good time to act rashly."

Hearing this, Guo Nanwu instead felt he had received several hints. He turned his cup silently, a sudden shock running through him.

'That's right! Why would the Li family kill my relatives for no reason? Several of the Daoist Masters never believed it. The divinations must have been wrong. It seems an enemy plotted this, and Senior Zhaojing knows about it... He just can't say it openly, so he's warning me discreetly: Deer Weeds Island is off-limits.'

'If he spelled it out, I would be dragged into the struggle between the Li family and their enemies... I just need to play dumb.'

He nodded gravely, even feeling a pang of guilt for his earlier suspicions.

"This junior understands!"

This complete failure to communicate had an unexpected effect. Li Ximing was delighted, thinking he had understood the hint immediately.

'So perceptive, so obedient... What a pity he isn't one of my family's juniors... A true pity...'

Guo Nanwu was sharp-witted and understood the bigger picture. Li Ximing had always been pleased with him and felt a growing appreciation for his talent. He listened as Guo Nanwu asked:

"Senior Zhaojing, what's the situation in the Wilderness now?"

Li Ximing gave a bitter smile internally, shaking his head with a sigh.

"It's hard to say... I've heard even Protector-General Liu has arrived in the Wilderness. With such a major mobilization, it's impossible for the north not to know. A conflict between the two sides is imminent. There really won't be many peaceful years left!"

Only because Yang Ruiyi himself had personally seen Li Zhouwei's injuries did the great general still show some leniency toward the Li clan and refrain from issuing a direct summons. But Li Ximing estimated he wouldn't be able to stay out of it. And the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument was still hanging in the inner formation to assist Li Jiangqian, which was a real problem.

But these things couldn't be said aloud. Li Ximing chatted idly about the manpower in the Wilderness when someone hurried up the mountain and reported in a low voice:

"Daoist Master Qinghu has returned from Shu and is in a private meeting with the General... He requests your presence now, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing sighed inwardly and stood up. Guo Nanwu tactfully took his leave, stepping into the Great Void to depart. Li Ximing, however, was secretly vexed.

'He's finally back. There's not much time left; we can't delay... I asked Sima Yuanli for that Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill long ago, but he just brushed me off. Those pills are incredibly rare. He won't part with one unless I "cut off some flesh"!'

His worries didn't end there; he felt a deeper unease.

'Minghuang is in seclusion, but there are still many who want to test him. That Maha Vast Cicada is on the other side of the river, and he's definitely targeting my family. We must be prepared... Both sides are gearing up. In one or two years at most, conflict is inevitable.'

When he entered the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance two years ago, Li Zhouwei could still speak with him at length. A mere two years was definitely not enough time for him to emerge, nor was it much time to truly assail the divine ability realm. He couldn't possibly come out to help now.

'Even though I've achieved the Life Divine Ability, I must be all the more cautious. I have to help Zhouwei endure this period... Only then will we have time to breathe.'

He had considered this long ago. His gaze dropped, and with a shake of his sleeve, a golden scroll was revealed. It was obviously well-read. Amidst its profound runes, several large, colorful characters appeared:

'Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.'

---

The Wilderness.

A dull, illusory radiance shrouded the mountaintop like an impenetrable shadow, concealing all traces beneath heavy black light. Within the great hall, inky blackness surged like a dark sea.

A man sat on the high seat. Though his features were plain, his armor emanated flickers of profound light. He sat quietly for a moment before another man entered from the front of the hall.

Nourished by a countless supply of Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder over the years, the divine ability of this Daoist Master Qinghu—Sima Yuanli—shone brilliantly. He had clearly reached a peak. There was even a faint fluctuation from his Shengyang Acupoint, suggesting a failed attempt to elevate his Immortal's Foundation within the last year or two.

What divine ability expert didn't experience a few failures? Sima Yuanli felt no regret, only relief that the timing was good. It had even given him time to make a trip to Shu. Now, as he stood in the hall, Yang Ruiyi immediately looked up and questioned him:

"How did that man, Qing, reply?"

His tone was blunt. Sima Yuanli hurriedly replied:

"General Qing agreed to move out from Shu and attack the Long region... But he stubbornly refuses to withdraw his troops from near Tongmo. And... he was utterly dismissive of your subordinate's proposal to join forces."

The Song Kingdom had a good geographical position. Several mountain ranges almost completely severed the connection between Shu and Song, leaving only a few passages like the Mushroom Forest Plains and Tongmo Prefecture. Qing Jifang clearly coveted them. Yang Ruiyi's expression darkened. He restrained himself and said:

"If he won't withdraw, so be it... Let the King of Yuyang remain in the kingdom... But how are we to deal with the forces at the Mushroom Forest Plains and Guyan?"

Sima Yuanli was visibly awkward.

"General Qing... General Qing said... he wasn't quite finished with King Wei after their last encounter."

That was far more blunt. Yang Ruiyi actually laughed in anger.

"What? He wants to kill Li Ximing to provoke King Wei? On any other day, fine. But at a time like this? He's doing this just to spite my Song Court!"

Sima Yuanli secretly watched his expression, his voice lowering as his form of address changed.

"I tried to be diplomatic for a long time, but Qing Jifang only offered one condition. He said... our Great Song's 'Martial Inheritance' is too fierce, that we've absorbed all the light of Martial Cultivation. He said there are vacancies for the Holder of the Profound, but the Celestial Grace doesn't fall on Shu. He hopes we... step back... and yield one more position to them."

Yang Ruiyi threw down his vermilion brush, slamming it on the desk.

"Absolutely not!"

Rage smoldered in his eyes.

He snapped, "This was settled long ago! You collect as much light as your ability allows. The current ratio for the Holder of the Profound positions is six for Song and one for Shu. This is what our court earned through its own power. How could we possibly just give it to them!"

"If that Qing Jifang has the ability, he should expand the 'Heavenly Splendor' himself and make the Martial Cultivation Star shine brighter! Naturally, there would be more positions for him then. That would benefit both nations. What logic is there in demanding I cede our share!"

Sima Yuanli quickly bowed his head, awkwardly rephrasing the other party's words more gently:

"Qing Jifang said... the Li clan is close with the Golden Feather. They should have joined Shu along with the Golden Feather, but our Great Song snatched them up first. He says that King Wei should also belong to Shu... In that case, the balance of Martial Cultivation light should be... four for Song and three for Shu."

Yang Ruiyi laughed in exasperation. "Absurd!"

He snapped the wooden slip shut and rapped it on the desk.

"Who does Qing Jifang think he is? Everyone detests him. The Golden Feather would help him? They couldn't be happier that the Li clan came to us! If he had dared to cross the Western Mountains back then, you think Li Zhouwei wouldn't have fought him to the death? And he still dares to speak of 'investiture'!"

Sima Yuanli could only lower his head in silence. Yang Ruiyi also composed his expression, standing with his hands behind his back.

"Pay this no mind," he said in a low voice. "I doubt the Shu Emperor will let him act so recklessly. But it's inevitable that a man or two will come to make trouble, thinking to grab a bit more territory to the east..."

Sima Yuanli glanced up. "In that case, who should we leave at the lake? Should we... ask King Wei to step in?"

Yang Ruiyi shot him a look, but ultimately shook his head.

"We don't need him," he said flatly. "Just manage your own affairs. I will leave Daoist Master Tinglan behind to guard the Mushroom Forest Plains. The two posts can watch each other's backs."

Sima Yuanli's expression changed instantly. He was responsible for the assault on Shanji; without Tinglan, it was like losing an arm. He gritted his teeth. 

"But Shanji..."

Yang Ruiyi didn't answer, a thoughtful look crossing his face.

"I vaguely recall... that junior of your family... Sima Xun, is it? He's at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm by now, isn't he?"

Sima Yuanli's face paled. He looked down, deeply unsettled.

"Yes... The boy has some ability. He was summoned by the Song Emperor... He's the most promising one in the family... He was granted the rank of partial general."

Hearing the words "summoned by the Song Emperor," Yang Ruiyi's original train of thought was disrupted. He frowned, thinking,

'If that's the case, it's not my place to interfere.'

He closed his eyes for a long moment, then suddenly spoke.

"Overlook Peak's Daoist Master Xianyao has been acquainted with your Sima Family for generations. Go to Overlook Peak on my behalf and invite him to the Wilderness for a talk."

Sima Yuanli hesitated.

"His lifespan is nearly at its end..."

Yang Ruiyi narrowed his eyes. 

"That's exactly what we want."

Sima Yuanli hurried away. Only then did Yang Ruiyi put down the wooden slip in his hand and pace quietly in the great hall.

'The struggle between the Dragon-kin and the Compassion Dao in Hetian will eventually end. The Way of Compassion is unwilling to suffer too many losses at sea. This war must be fought. Even if I don't make a move, the north will...'

He seemed vexed.

'I hear the Xiangxiong Kingdom is busy firing up its mountain furnaces to refine pills... They have no time to deal with Shu. Otherwise, they would never let that man Qing get so arrogant. Every great lord is making their own plans... But how can the great tide of the world be something any single person can maneuver!'
