# Chapter 1264 A Swift Collapse

Endless darkness shrouded the sky, and the divine pass that had faintly appeared within view receded into the shadows at an even faster rate, replaced by a vast, slumbering sunset!

The Crimson Severing Arrowhead.

Gongsun Bei's expression sank into the darkness as well.

It was true... he, Gongsun Bei, was indeed a master of divine abilities from Yanmen, a veteran of many great wars and rich in experience, yet his cultivation in that harsh and bitter pass had also left him lacking an extremely crucial treasure for achieving victory in combat:

Dao-Profundity.

This Shadowy Concealment Escape Art was one he had requested from the great Han Family, and its incantation was also taught by them; he had grasped its form but not its essence—even the meaning revealed in Li Zhouwei’s few words gave him a sense of sudden enlightenment.

Likewise, he finally understood why his Plea to Supplant the Night, which could dissolve Celestial Yang, seemed so frail before the Crimson Severing Arrowhead.

Another realization also surfaced in his mind:

‘With these words, I can surely take another step on the path of Dawn Qi.’

‘But alas... there will be no other chance.’

His face, swallowed by the pitch-black darkness, finally lit up, his pupils reflecting a heavenly light of utmost brilliance!

It was a majestic, domineering celestial pass of white bricks and purple flames, descending from the heavens.

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

Gongsun Bei's face brightened rapidly until it was a sheet of incandescent white. The general's grip on his blood-axe tightened, the last thought of retreat purged from his mind, his gaze turning ice-cold.

‘If death it is, then death it is! Better to die in battle than to be killed by cowardice!’

His Plea to Supplant the Night could not escape this blood desert, but that did not mean a ponderous divine ability like Audience with the Celestial Gate could easily suppress his Dawn Qi!

‘Desperate times call for desperate measures; who cares for the king's command now!’

He took a single step, and that streak of azure light once again shone from his body. Like a nobleman's carriage in the night, he silently drove out from beneath the Celestial Gate, hurtling a hundred li forward instead of back, his blood-axe raised high and pointed straight at Li Zhouwei!

He charged forward with ferocious intent.

‘Now this is more like it.’

Far from angered, Li Zhouwei was pleased. His golden pupils locked onto the radiance of the Discourse of the Eight Evasions on Gongsun Bei's body, his gaze unwavering as if trying to deduce every characteristic of the divine ability in this brief moment!

For him, this was a rare opportunity.

Be it Dawn Qi or Veiled Yin, the more familiar he became with these enemy divine abilities, the more assured his future actions would be; sometimes, a single small judgment or one correct response could affect the entire situation, perhaps even the lives of Li Ximing, Li Que'wan, and all the cultivators on the lake!

At this moment, facing the menacing charge of Gongsun Bei, the qilin markings on King Wei's face pulsed. He neither dodged nor evaded, but instead stood tall and met the attack, raising his long halberd with both hands in an upward sweep to block the blood-axe!

"Boom!"

A clang reverberated across the great desert, yet the sound was entirely contained by a blood-red radiance, unable to travel any further. Like all cultivators from humble and harsh backgrounds, Gongsun Bei's skill with weaponry was not lacking, and the armor on his body was the culmination of his life's work, but unfortunately for him, he had run into Li Zhouwei.

The Primal Summit and Sovereign's Perilous Tread activated in unison. The long halberd shimmered, not wavering in the slightest under the terrifying pressure. King Wei's face was just inches away, his expression placid as he suddenly released the tail of the halberd with his right hand!

Holding the halberd with a single hand, he shot his free hand out to seize Gongsun Bei by the throat!

Alarm bells screamed in Gongsun Bei's mind. The Unending Dawnfire behind him blazed, operating at full power to continuously weaken Li Zhouwei's Heavenly Light, but it was completely unable to stop that large hand.

It clamped down on his throat.

In that instant, Li Zhouwei felt as if he had seized a slippery, venomous snake. It struggled in his grasp with astonishing force and slipped away in a flash, leaving behind only the azure radiance of a divine ability that made his hand sizzle.

‘Even the Dharma Body of Sovereign's Perilous Tread is not effective...’

Gongsun Bei seized this momentary opening to finally break away. Yet he did not retreat, but instead concentrated all the radiance of his divine abilities and swung his long axe toward Li Zhouwei’s neck!

The young man paid him no mind; the Sun-Surging Governing Stars between his brows flickered, and for a moment, chaotic stars trembled amid a brilliant stream of light. He vanished from his spot, replaced by an unfurled scroll from which flowed the light of Bright Yang.

Gongsun Bei showed no fear. With his divine abilities empowering him and the Plea to Supplant the Night as support, he took a light step across, only to find himself surrounded by illusions. A bright, setting sun appeared, and crimson light manifested from nothing, trapping him in place.

It was the Primal Summit's Divine Art: Pivotal Radiance.

This divine art drew its imagery from the Crimson Severing Arrowhead; because its power was not particularly remarkable, Li Zhouwei had used it very few times. Yet now, facing a Gongsun Bei who had escaped the Heavenly Light, Pivotal Radiance proved highly effective, trapping him for a time.

By now, Li Zhouwei had appeared high in the sky. The hand seals he was forming were complete, his gaze chilling. A gale swept through, and the last sliver of the setting sun between heaven and earth finally sank below the horizon.

The canopy of the sky descended, and the only light over the great desert vanished, plunging everything into endless darkness. And in this darkness, there was a dripping sound.

The mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was momentarily stunned in the darkness.

Li Zhouwei was gone.

To be precise, the entire blood-red world of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead had vanished. Gongsun Bei's spiritual sense was a blur; there was nothing but darkness. It seemed to last for an instant, yet also for an eternity, leaving Gongsun Bei utterly bewildered.

‘What kind of divine ability is this?’

‘The Crimson Severing Arrowhead? I've never heard of such a thing...’

But in the instant this stray thought crossed his mind, a speck of crimson finally appeared on the horizon. It was a flowing drop of red, like a droplet of blood streaking across the pitch-black sky.

This blood was like a comet, an omen heralding an era of chaos, as it sheared the dark sky in two, revealing a gloomy gray firmament behind, a mist that stretched from heaven to earth, and—the distant Zanmen!

The Crimson Severing Arrowhead was undone!

Gongsun Bei had no time to withdraw; as the darkness receded, an endless torrent of black-gold light flowed out and converged upon him.

It was Emperor Qi's Light again!

This technique that inverted Bright Yang rushed toward him, but Gongsun Bei had no time for anything else; the divine abilities throughout his body trembled, constantly warning him that a fatal blow was imminent!

But before he could react, he felt as if a great hammer had slammed into his mind. A burst of colors exploded before his eyes, dazzling him, and in an instant, his consciousness became muddled, leaving him bewildered and helpless.

The Pure Yang Bracelets!

This Spiritual Treasure was formidable indeed; even as his Discourse of the Eight Evasions responded and continuously attenuated the effects, he was still stunned and trapped in place.

The bloody comet that had parted the Crimson Severing Arrowhead was now like a teardrop, plummeting at a terrifying speed directly toward Gongsun Bei!

‘Not good!’

The Crimson Severing Arrowhead had faded, revealing the entire scene and instantly alarming all the masters of divine abilities fighting nearby. Anyone could see that Gongsun Bei was in great trouble.

‘Save him, quickly!’

Just as expected, a brilliant multicolored light lit up the horizon. The nun manifested a world-shaking form and struck without hesitation, having no time to wait for an opportune moment. She did not even dare to attack Li Zhouwei, but instead rushed straight for Gongsun Bei!

But how could Li Zhouwei be unprepared? His Audience with the Celestial Gate had been waiting. It suddenly flared, smashing down like a meteor from beyond the heavens to firmly block the Maha!
And that streak of blood-light, like a gentle touch of color, softly draped itself over Gongsun Bei.

The Daoist Master regained his senses with extreme speed, and the instant the blood-light descended, he pushed his divine abilities to their absolute limit.

The Discourse of the Eight Evasions!

This divine ability, which had performed miracles time and again, brightened once more. Under the Daoist Master's desperate activation, illusions even appeared, as of a thousand palaces with esteemed ministers forming factions for personal gain, preventing the emperor's law from being carried out, seeking to negate the descending light just as it had done before.

But not only did the blood-light not weaken, its killing intent grew even stronger!

The young man, however, stood with his hands clasped behind him, his voice serene and cold, like light and lightning illuminating the world.

"I am the usurper and the regicide; the emperor himself cannot escape his fate. What need is there to parley with mere vassals!"

The Crimson Severing Arrowhead divine ability was the yin aspect of Bright Yang, but it was also an offensive art, known for 'sweeping away all troubles with the weight of ten thousand chariots.' It was an exceedingly difficult divine ability to master, one that Li Zhouwei had cultivated for twenty years to perfect.

And when the Crimson Severing Arrowhead was perfected, the light of its Karma-Transforming Pure Yin that appeared as the divine ability receded would reach its apex, manifesting the intent of a Lingering Sun's Killing Blow!

If the unperfected Crimson Severing Arrowhead was like rampaging across the land, accumulating the power of ten thousand chariots to wreak havoc, thus producing the Karma-Transforming Pure Yin to either escape or slay foes, then its perfected form was like a usurping general marching from the outer fiefs into the royal domain, returning to the palace to purge the old guard and seize the throne!

This was the root of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead's power as a killing art.

And the Crimson Severing Arrowhead was not even weakened by the Discourse of the Eight Evasions!

Li Zhouwei's gaze was ice-cold.

‘The Discourse of the Eight Evasions is the way of the noble minister, preventing the emperor's law from being applied and thus obstructing the sovereign. But when faced with a rebellious army bent on regicide and seizing the nation, the monarch cannot even protect himself—who would then parley with the old guard about evasions!’

"Boom!"

As if to confirm his words, the speck of crimson fell, freezing Gongsun Bei's figure in place as a crimson light flooded the sky, engulfing the entire scene.

Meanwhile, the sky on the other side brightened as radiances streaked over. Cheng Qian and Cui Jueyin had arrived as reinforcements from Xiangxiang, one after the other, striking from within the Great Void to jointly block the nun's golden form!

But be it the divine abilities or the Maha, there was no time to pay them any heed. All eyes turned to the dissipating bloody mist, where a terrifying scene was revealed to all.

Gongsun Bei was kneeling upon the fertile plains.

The general's head was bowed, his hand clutching his chest as fresh blood gushed from his mouth. The divine abilities throughout his body had withered to an extreme degree, as if a terrifying pressure had descended upon him, forcing him to his knees, unable to move.

Gongsun Bei raised his head.

A line of bloody tears trickled from between his brows, leaving a golden crack upon his face. The light of the lingering sun bathed more than half his face in crimson blood, a truly terrifying sight.

The intent of the lingering sun's killing blow permeated his body, not only damaging his divine abilities but also faintly clouding his mind!

Jiang Toushou and Xiaodisa saw this and fell silent.

‘It's over...’

It was not that he, Jiang Toushou, had been watching the tigers fight from a mountaintop, intentionally letting harm come to Gongsun Bei—it had all happened too fast! Gongsun Bei cultivated Dawn Qi, yet he had been routed in an instant before Li Zhouwei; not even an incense stick's worth of time had passed!

"Boom!"

Another earth-shattering sound erupted. Xiaodisa's aura surged as he forcefully drew upon multicolored light, stepping into the air and shining down countless hues. Jiang Toushou cursed inwardly; with but a single thought, a Merciful One had already been shattered in midair!

But a cold, bone-chilling voice echoed from the sky, ringing through the night.

"Gongsun Bei! There will come a day you'll wish to live in Chandana Forest, but will not be able to!"

This Xiaodisa departed leisurely on his multicolored light, yet still found the time to mock him!

All the Buddhist lights flashed at once. The world darkened as sand and stones were sent flying. The masters of divine abilities to the south either gave chase or laughed, stood on guard or were stunned in amazement, but all of them faded into a blurry background.

The reinforcements from Great Zhao had suffered a small defeat before Zanmen, but they routed at the first clash, leaving a Daoist Master kneeling on the ground as they scrambled back into the pass, not daring to look eastward.

They were even relieved, pleased that the one left behind was Gongsun Bei.

Li Zhouwei merely stood where he was, quietly watching all the colors retreat to the west, his aura firmly locked on the kneeling Daoist Master, his gaze unwavering.

He waited until all fell silent and the multicolored lights no longer shone. Night had deepened, and a tranquil darkness covered the land. One by one, masters of divine abilities appeared in silence, suspended in the sky like deities.

Gongsun Bei was not surprised. Xiaodisa's words did not provoke any reaction from him. He raised his blood-streaked face, gazing at the sky with a vacant yet relieved expression.

Even though his vision was still a field of crimson.

After a moment, Changyun's quiet voice was heard.

"What a potent killing light. Gongsun Bei... your inability to evade it can be considered a worthy death!"

Li Zhouwei shot him an inscrutable glance.

‘A member of the Zhang family, after all... what sharp eyes.’

This killing intent manifested only when the Crimson Severing Arrowhead receded, and once it appeared, it had to kill. If it missed, its power would be greatly diminished, and it would be unable to produce the light of 'Karma-Transforming Pure Yin' again!

The Li Clan had not encountered this for the first time; the Splitting Light ability from the Radiant Sun King's Halberd that Li Ximing had first obtained possessed a fraction of this same mystery—their strengths and weaknesses were identical, stemming from the same source.

That was why he had saved the Pure Yang Bracelets for the last moment!

Gongsun Bei below naturally could not discern this, or perhaps it no longer mattered whether he could. He kept his head held high, letting the bloody light wash over his face as a Spiritual Treasure descended, severing his connection to the Great Void.

He did not say a word.

The assembled cultivators were all trusted aides of the Li Clan and naturally remained silent. Only Yu Xi was horrified—he happened to know Gongsun Bei and was aware of his strength. Even accounting for the suppression between their Dao, it shouldn't have led to such an instantaneous defeat...

He was hardly any slower than Jiang Fuwang and his companion!

All along, Yu Xi had relied on his own divine abilities and was naturally proud, never needing to worry for his life. If not for his entire family being in Ruzhou, he never would have fought with his full strength in this great war!

Now, for the first time, he doubted whether he could survive against this King Wei, and a belated sense of shock and fear washed over him.

‘Thankfully I did not refuse King Wei—had I thought differently for even a moment, I would likely be the one kneeling in Ruzhou!’

Yu Xi was familiar with Gongsun Bei, and thinking to this point, he felt a chill, as if losing a close ally. He lowered his gaze slightly and said,

"General Gongsun..."

But his position was not right; he spoke only those two words before sighing, turning away, and retreating into silence.

‘The world has changed... the world has changed... Two died at Lake Xian, and now another is about to fall before Zanmen... The fall of every master of divine abilities in recent years has been related to this man!’

All eyes turned to Li Zhouwei.

But King Wei was still staring in the direction Xiaodisa had fled, a faint frown on his face. He had clearly heard the man's parting words, and he murmured softly,

"Regretting not joining the Buddhists sooner?"

Gongsun Bei heard his voice and finally showed some reaction. In a hoarse voice, he laughed.

"In my early years, I had a dear friend who cultivated the Buddhist Dao. We cultivated together at Yanmen. He was handsome and extraordinary, well-read in countless texts, and he guided my cultivation, telling me my destiny lay with Bright Yang. It was because of him that I left that harsh desert land to enter the world and serve the court. If King Wei asks whether I ever had the heart to join the Buddhists..."

His lips trembled slightly, his thoughts unreadable, as he admitted frankly.

"At least, I once did."

Gongsun Bei seemed to recover slightly. He raised his blood-axe to support himself on the ground and coughed up some more blood, his condition already much improved. But in this situation, escape was impossible even at his peak. He held no such hope, and merely said faintly,

"But I would not call it regret."

"My dear friend submitted to Compassion, and from then on forgot emotion and gratitude, forgot himself and others, and never saw me again. And I... I was a hero of Yanmen. After achieving my divine ability, I threw myself into the court, where I saw much filth... The likes of Xiaodisa and Jiang Toushou, I am ashamed to be associated with them. And yet the orthodox Daos, be they Immortal or Buddhist, were all ashamed to accept me..."

The red in his eyes gradually faded, turning into bloody tears that streamed down, revealing dim, dark eyes.

"When I roamed as a swordsman in Yanmen, I was the hope of my sect. I guarded my home and country, slew the northern barbarians, and was immensely proud. That place was small; the finest figures of that time could only sigh helplessly before me... Later, as my divine abilities took shape, I came to realize the vastness of the world and the insignificance of myself. I learned that the world is dim and gray, a place that breaks heroes!"

"And I, to advance was to court death, to retreat was to risk the annihilation of my clan... A hero? Not anymore. Just a running dog, a pawn, a cowardly general from a humble gate, a stray dog, living in constant fear, with nowhere to call home..."

"King Wei—just kill me!"

He gave a self-deprecating laugh, and after the last of the bloody tears had fallen, he slowly closed his eyes and said with admiration,

"There are indeed figures in this world before whom I can only sigh helplessly. To die at King Wei's hand is no disgrace; it is an honor to fall to such a great man!"
