# Chapter 1070: The Buddhist Head

Sima Yuanli had learned his lesson. He immediately threw the Spiritual Treasure in his hands, but Li Ximing didn't pause for an instant. Enduring the intense vertigo that came from overtaxing his divine ability and dharma power, his hands had already been forming a seal at his chest for some time, summoning something from far away!

_Omm!_

The torrential rain of Radiant Fire had not yet faded from the sky when the grand array, already shrouded in purple-gold light, began to rumble. Thirty-two beams of spiritual light rocketed upward, illuminating the heavens once more.

This was the Light of Purple Visage, drawn from the Purple Mansion Grand Array—the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array!

The majestic temple in the sky was in the process of disintegrating. A White Cicada darted through the cascading Glazed shards. Dazzling brilliance linked heaven and earth as a chaotic storm of multicolored Radiant Fire rained down. Caught between the red and purple flames, the figure of the young monk emerged.

Vast Cicada's eyes were sealed shut. His golden kasaya was crawling with flickering, golden Radiant Fire that caused the profound runes on its surface to pulse erratically. He was as still as a stone statue, utterly motionless.

The only exception was the three-finger-wide hole torn open in his chest. A faint, flickering Radiant Fire was visible within. Wrecked purple wisps erupted from the wound, revealing internal organs that looked like shattered Glazed crystal.

The Great Radiance of White Brilliance was, after all, one of the highest-grade spell arts. Li Ximing had amplified it to an entirely new level using the Valley Wind Guide-Fire, and had focused his entire will on condensing it within the pagoda. The resulting blast had completely surpassed Vast Cicada's expectations. It hadn't just wounded his Dharma body—it had punched clean through his heart.

Even worse, the Wondrous Dharma of the Radiant Cicada Molt, the art to which he'd entrusted his very life-mandate, was designed to shed his outer shell. If cast successfully, any injury short of his bones and sinews would vanish instantly. But the penetrating "Malice of the Golden Brilliance" left behind by the attack was now coursing through his entire frame. Even transforming into a White Cicada to escape its effects was useless!

Because of this, the thirty-two purple pillars of light resonating across the sky converged, bathing the monk's face in violet light. Vast Cicada remained immobilized. The Metal Malice from the Great Radiance of White Brilliance had temporarily paralyzed his Dharma body. Furthermore, the Light of the Six Harmonies infused within the attack had a powerful binding effect. The two forces worked in concert, leaving him unable to so much as open his eyelids.

_BOOM!_

The thirty-two pillars merged, coalescing into a dense, purple-gold radiance: the Broad Valley Purple Visage Light of the grand array!

At this moment of crisis, the pale golden Profound Window above Vast Cicada's head opened automatically, projecting a protective force. The monk's figure was like an ant swallowed by the onrushing, purple-gold flood.

Li Ximing coughed, but his expression held no joy. Instead, a flicker of regret passed through his mind.

'Times have changed,' he thought. 'When the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition modified this array for me, they sacrificed its offensive power. The Broad Valley Purple Visage Light is still useful against cultivators in the early Purple Mansion Realm, but against this monster's Dharma body... it's just too weak!'

With a single thought, he shot off without hesitation, racing toward a specific point in the sky.

Sure enough, while the attack had also caused the world to dim, its power was nothing compared to the Great Radiance of White Brilliance that had shattered the Dharma Temple. The Broad Valley Purple Visage Light was all thunder and no rain. A painful expression crossed the monk's face, but he stood firm within the purple light as his body emitted a series of sharp crackles.

In that instant, the monk slowly forced his eyes open, his pupils swimming with disbelief.

'Luckily, Li Ximing has no other decent spell arts left...'

His Dharma body was unstable. With some difficulty, he raised a hand to cover the wound on his chest. The corresponding exit wound on his back was already healing, and the tear in his kasaya shrank to the size of a pinprick.

But in a battle between Purple Mansion Realm experts, who would give him time to heal? A long scroll unfurled in the sky. The Huai River Map snapped open in the wind, unleashing a surge of heavy golden light. A vast and mighty fortress materialized from the light and descended with overwhelming power!

_BOOM!_

A terrifying shockwave radiated through the air. Beneath the descending fortress, countless treacherous peaks erupted. All manner of Bright Yang phenomena manifested—rivers ceased to flow, golden statues crumbled, armies scattered, and colossal palaces collapsed. The bells and drums of heaven and earth rang out in an unending chorus. Vast Cicada's Dao-Profundity was truly terrifying. In the instant the fortress fell, he had already managed to temporarily suppress the Golden Brilliance ravaging his body. Freeing himself from the injury's paralysis, he raised an eyebrow and shouted:

"Engage!"

The Profound Window above his head flared with brilliant light, managing to block the Spiritual Treasure for a fraction of a second. But the Huai River Map was no ordinary artifact; it couldn't be stopped so easily. It instantly locked onto his aura while curtains of white light cascaded down on either side, sealing off all avenues of escape.

'The Huai River Map... I should have expected it!'

Trapped within the Spiritual Treasure's domain, Vast Cicada's gaze turned grim. He glanced toward his pagoda, but the artifact he had so meticulously refined was still pinned fast by the Proclaimation Earth, completely immobile. The monk's expression changed as he slid his thumb from the tip of his middle finger down to the finger's base.

Just moments ago, Li Ximing had used the array's suppression to break free. He hadn't been retreating at all—he had been repositioning. Now, he thrust out his sleeve, and a large, immaculate white hand suddenly expanded. The Audience with the Celestial Gate, which he had previously used to empower himself, now descended, locking the Valley Water lotus within its grasp!

He had already used a Valley Water art to slip away from the Audience with the Celestial Gate once before. This man was anticipating him using the Borrowed Valley Water Grandeur Art to pull the same "golden cicada" escape ruse again!

'So he's not just some Alchemist who only knows cultivation!'

Vast Cicada felt a flash of both anger and admiration, but no panic. Since escape was impossible, he faced the boundless golden light pouring from the Spiritual Treasure. Enduring the searing pain in his chest, he decisively swung his sleeve and, committing completely, began to chant:

"Land of the Precious Tusk's golden edge, holy Dharma empower this vessel!"

The Profound Window above him contracted instantly, flying back into the spot between his brows. His aura surged, but now, nothing stood between him and the descending Huai River Map!

_DONG!_

The resonant sound lingered in the air. Vast Cicada staggered as if struck by a heavy blow. The nearly-healed wound on his back burst open again, returning to its full three-finger width. Two streams of white blood trickled from his nostrils, and his wide-open eyes were completely golden.

He was now trapped within a landscape of imposing mountain passes and winding rivers. The mighty fortress stretched to the horizon, towering and implacable. Atop its walls stood countless figures in golden armor, all leveling bows and spears, their eyes glaring with rage.

'I'm inside the Huai River Map!'

He looked up and saw Li Ximing, deathly pale, sitting atop the Audience with the Celestial Gate and desperately circulating his dharma power to recover. But his divine ability moved without delay. The moment he saw Vast Cicada trapped, Li Ximing abandoned the Valley Water lotus and prepared to descend upon the Spiritual Treasure himself, intending to sever the monk's connection to the Great Void.

Vast Cicada had already yielded three moves just to recover from his initial miscalculation. He could not afford to yield again!

His expression turned somber, his pupils reflecting the endless golden light of the Huai River Map. He swallowed a mouthful of blood laced with Radiant Fire as numerous phantoms began to manifest behind him. His voice emerged, low and ethereal:

"Precious Tusk as my vessel, a body to receive a reverent heart. Victorious Name, Dharma-form, let all who hear give praise. Let all brilliance manifest as one within me."

As he spoke, the shadows behind him took form. The image on the left sat in the full lotus position, a nimbus glowing behind its head. The image on the right bore three flowers upon its crown, its fleshy topknot coiled like a lotus. Vast Cicada himself strained, ripping the corners of his mouth wide open, back toward his ears. The entire upper half of his face peeled backward, revealing two rows of white teeth. The White Cicada within leaped forth, its fangs bared, and shrieked:

"Father! Would you kill your own son?!"

The cry was like a thunderclap shattering the heavens. It blasted the Huai River Map, causing the dimension to rattle and its light to dim as if in shame. Had it been an ordinary Spiritual Artifact, especially with its master Sima Yuanli otherwise occupied, it would have shattered. But the Huai River Map was different, and with Li Ximing's support, it teetered on the brink but miraculously held together.

This, however, was agony for Li Ximing. His face was ashen, his head spinning. He heard an earth-shattering explosion and dimly perceived countless golden beams erupting from the ground, lifting all Profound Mystery with them.

When the blinding gold and white light faded, Vast Cicada was gone. In his place, a colossal golden head was slowly rising.

The face soared into the clouds. Its nose was a mountain ridge, its dark nostrils exhaling iridescent mists. Its lips were pressed together in agony, its wrinkles as deep as gullies. Its eyes were not eyes at all, but two magnificent palaces. Countless monks bustled in and out, as if living within two Glazed orbs, all kneeling in pious worship.

Beneath the head was only a bloody, severed neck. There was no torso, as if it had been bitten clean off by some colossal, sharp-toothed beast. The true gilded form of this Maha Vast Cicada... was just a head!

A jolt of horror shot through Li Ximing.

"He's been fighting me with a mere incarnation all this time! This... this is his true gilded form!"

In truth, Vast Cicada's gilded form wasn't abnormally large. But unlike other Maha experts, his form _was only a head_. The sheer terror and scale of it thus far surpassed any other. When those two cavernous, palace-like eyes gazed down, the entire island fell deathly silent, plunged into absolute despair.

But Vast Cicada didn't hesitate for a second. With his true form revealed, the Huai River Map's suppression was at its absolute weakest. It was the perfect moment to strike!

"Hahahaha!"

A thunderous laugh rolled across the sky. The mouth gaped open to its fullest extent, a black hole that swallowed all color. Its teeth, white and sharp as blades, snapped down directly at Li Ximing.

Li Ximing's golden pupils saw it clearly: inside the head's cavernous mouth was the red-eyed White Cicada!

This White Cicada was no longer the delicate, almost cute creature from before. It was as large as a mountain, its many limbs hanging ominously in the darkness. Its compound eyes were comprised of thousands upon thousands of human eyes, all staring fixedly at him. Its mandibles clicked open and shut, drool dripping in anticipation.

A deep chill shot straight into Li Ximing's mind, and he cursed internally:

'What in the hell _is_ this Vast Cicada?!'

He knew he couldn't release the Huai River Map or move the Audience with the Celestial Gate. If his opponent reconnected with the Great Void, he would gain limitless support from the Buddhist Land. Bracing himself against the pouncing gilded form, Li Ximing clapped his hands together.

In that instant, all the Radiant Fire light converged. The Bright Yang Heavenly Light focused, transforming into puffs of vermilion Radiant Fire that scattered like smoke.

Tread on Flames!

An explosive _CRUNCH_ echoed through the sky. Vast Cicada's eyes blazed, erupting with two surging beams of white light that blasted Li Ximing from the air. The massive lips parted fiercely once more, but the mouth was now empty—the White Cicada was gone. Only a deafening shriek remained:

"AWOOOO—"

The sound shook the heavens and the earth. It made no distinction between friend and foe. Sima Yuanli, Tao Jiexing, and even the two Merciful One experts in the siege all faltered, their minds going blank for an instant.

But Li Ximing's eyes remained bright, completely unaffected. He vaulted into the air, his heart pounding with urgency. In the distance, the golden head suddenly shrank. The pagoda finally tore itself free from the Proclaimation Earth that had bound it for so long. And from behind him, the terrifying White Cicada lunged, its sharp mandibles aiming to shear him in two at the waist!

Time was running out. Vast Cicada could no longer afford a protracted fight. He was willing to damage his own Dharma body to take Li Ximing down _now_!

In this desperate, split-second crisis, Li Ximing felt no panic. The Light of the Six Harmonies vanished into his sleeve. The light of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body flared as he pushed its connection and induction to their absolute limits!

But the intense pain he expected never came. Li Ximing dimly saw a curtain of purple light descend, and he found himself enveloped in a swirling purple mist.

A faint, autumn-yellow color appeared at the edge of his vision, and a woman's soft, gentle voice whispered in his ear,

"How dare you!"

Li Ximing recognized the voice instantly. He turned and, sure enough, saw a delicate, unadorned face. Her eyes, which had once seemed soft, were now steely and strong, glaring fiercely at Vast Cicada. Seeing Daoist Master Zhaojing, she broke into a grin.

"Good. You're here."

...

The sky was dim, the world leached of color.

The rumble of chariot wheels echoed across the horizon. Dark, heavy clouds plunged the entire Jiangbei region into darkness. A Daoist Master wearing robes of white feathers and dark, profound patterns stood with an icy expression, the jade gourd in his hand pulsing restlessly. His heart was heavy.

After receiving Jinlian's message, Changyun had not broken his word. He set out immediately, his escape arts carrying him at incredible speed. But his mind wasn't on Minghui's plight at all.

'Strange... Yang Ruiyi is making such a massive play.'

This Daoist Master Changyun was a man of significant standing and had his own insights into the conflict between the north and south. He knew Yang Ruiyi would inevitably strike north, but he also understood the vast disparity between the two sides.

'The Great Song has its Holder of the Profound experts, it's true. But the nation's strength hasn't recovered. Those few Holders are only at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Even if they've gained some mystical power through Tianwu, they can't even match a standard Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. So what if you have five or six of them? You are their only truly decisive power...'

'It's not that the Great Song can't fight. But they absolutely cannot be fighting with the goal of seizing territory. Their strategy should be to strike at the North's forces, weaken them, and buy themselves more time to recover...'

'But given his current movements, Yang Ruiyi is spreading his forces thin, pushing them toward the Shanji region while he himself advances deep into enemy territory. Alone. I have no idea what game he's playing.' Changyun felt a headache coming on.

'If that's his plan, then Moongaze Lake is left without any major figures to defend it. Aren't they doomed?'

He was deep in thought when his expression suddenly changed. He raised his hand slightly and felt an invisible barrier obstructing his path. He acted instantly, drawing a small sword from his sleeve. He slapped a talisman onto the blade and shouted:

"Geng-Dui Phase-Shift, let the way be opened!"

Perhaps the barrier was only designed to keep people in, not out, or perhaps the small sword was simply extraordinary. It sliced a fissure into the pitch-black, gloomy light with surprising ease, making Daoist Master Changyun's eye twitch.

'This is bad... Don't tell me it's an ambush!'

But a piercing shriek suddenly split the air. The world before him shattered like Glazed glass, and a hand—once elegant and pale, now mangled and hacked down to the bone—leaped out and flew frantically toward him!

The palm of this large hand sprouted two eyes and a mouth, as if it had been carelessly grafted on from a corpse. It was now emitting a desolate, desperate roar:

"Save me! Save me! Daoist Master, save me!"
