# Chapter 1096: Azure Cliff

The pole-scythe, dripping with demonic qi, pierced through the air. In that split second, Li Jiangliang’s thoughts raced. He leveled a profound sword with one hand while pressing two fingers of his other hand against the flat of the blade, lifting it upward. Darkness surged behind him as the Great Void materialized.

"Boom!"

A wave of deep black Baleful Qi instantly billowed outward. The profound sword was of high quality, but it bent into a sharp arc under the force of the scythe. The impact sent a shock through their mental connection, and Li Jiangliang’s face paled. He used the momentum to take a single step back, falling into the Great Void.

But at that exact moment, the pole-scythe shot forward, its short hilt twisting and hooking down, instantly locking onto the profound sword.

"Clang!"

Li Jiangliang’s figure vanished, but the profound sword remained, trapped within the Baleful Qi. Helian Wumeng showed no sign of triumph, merely narrowing his eyes.

"Oh?"

Amidst the roiling Baleful Qi, the trapped sword suddenly resonated with the light in the heavens, dissolved into mist, and vanished without a trace.

Helian Wumeng’s figure disappeared at the same time.

Down below, under the light of the Azureglass Stars of the Western General, Li Jiangxia’s expression turned grim. He formed a hand seal, and the golden seal above his head erupted in blinding light. In the next instant, a mountain of Baleful Qi smashed down, accompanied by the roar of a thousand blade-lights.

"Boom!"

The white light from the sky cascaded down again. Helian Wumeng didn't even turn his head, but a new face suddenly appeared on the back of his skull. Its pupils were blood-red, its expression a savage grin. A crimson demonic light flashed from its eyes, erupting in the distance as a terrifying storm of Baleful Qi that blasted Li Jianglong out of the air as he tried to provide support.

The Azureglass Stars of the Western General unleashed myriad rays of light, descending with the storm of Baleful Qi blades, instantly drowning the faint golden glow from the seal.

The golden seal in Li Jiangxia’s hand was no simple item. It was a treasure from the Song Imperial Court known as the Vanquishing True Golden Seal, capable of resonating with the stars to neutralize hostile powers. With this treasure, an ordinary early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would never be able to defeat him so quickly.

But the power of the Supreme Yin, channeled through the Azureglass Stars of the Western General, was incredibly profound. It seemed to be relentlessly converting the ambient True Qi into a foreign, corrosive light, pressing deeper and deeper. Meanwhile, the Baleful Qi continued to pour down. After little more than a dozen breaths, the golden light began to flicker violently.

Li Jiangxia’s expression darkened.

'To counter me so effectively and so quickly… This man’s Dao-Profundity is definitely not to be underestimated!'

Despite being burned by the Lightless Water and Fire, Helian Wumeng showed no sign of weakness. Two more arms sprouted from beneath his armpits. One formed a hand seal, the other held a small bell. Coordinated with the blood-red face on the back of his head, he was now suppressing the other two cultivators all by himself.

Unfortunately, neither Li Jiangliang nor Li Jianglong possessed a Vanquishing True Golden Seal. The moment they were locked down by the Azureglass Stars of the Western General, their lives would be in immediate danger. They didn't even dare to leave the safety of the Great Void for long.

The three of them were Holders of the Profound. They should have been able to suppress an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Given that their ambush with the Lightless Water and Fire had succeeded, they should have been able to stall even a mid-stage expert. Instead, Helian Wumeng was single-handedly suppressing all three of them.

Li Jiangxia was not the only one in peril. The crisis was escalating so rapidly that even Xianyao turned his gaze, his face heavy with apprehension.

'The Helian family’s legacy…'

But there was one person present whose expression was fouler than anyone's.

It was Helian Wujiang.

The man’s face was cold and dark. He was steadily gaining the upper hand against Chen Yin, but his attention was almost entirely fixed on the Purple Mansion Realm junior from his own clan. He shot a worried glance at Helian Wumeng as his mind raced.

'Holders of the Profound… they really are something else. The Merciful One can't compare. One is a new Holder, and the other two are just temporarily borrowing its power, and with just a few treasures, they can actually hold Wumeng back!'

Helian Wujiang knew better than anyone what state Helian Wumeng was in.

The Iron Edict Elixir had been refined by their own ancestor, Helian Fan. From the time the Helian family first followed the Qi Emperor to the present day, with the Tiefu Kingdom now a vassal of the Zhao, Helian Fan was, without a doubt, the greatest prodigy their family had ever produced.

This prodigy had cultivated the Whole Pill, obtained an ancient Daoist tradition, and excelled at artifact refinement. He became renowned throughout the world for his demonic Baleful Treasured Artifacts, even going so far as to establish his own kingdom. The Iron Edict Elixir was the crystallization of his life’s work. Helian Wumeng had consumed it. And although the Ying-Copper Armor of Great Xia he wore was far from being fully refined—he was barely wearing the outer shell—his power was already terrifying. Even Helian Wujiang himself wasn't confident he could win a certain victory against him.

But what worried him even more was the other spiritual item in play.

'Lightless Water and Fire!'

A golden and vibrant purple halo had appeared, and Helian Wujiang had been the first to spot it.

His Helian family cultivated Baleful Qi, but they also had a deep understanding of True Qi. This particular path involved the mastery of water and fire. At its absolute peak, there was only one power, born from the Martial Truth Qi Malignance Essence. It was called the Tianwu True-Nature Divine Flame. Its might was in no way inferior to the five waters and five fires birthed from the Great Void itself.

This was an existence of an extremely high order.

In primordial times, the Heavenly Dao, through moral resonance, had given birth to five primordial waters and five primordial fires. Each one possessed a unique marvel on par with an immortal object. The Yuwu bird had obtained just one of them, and the mere mention of it made immortals pale. For True Qi to possess such a capability was astoundingly powerful.

The water and fire of True Qi existed in the realm between yin and yang. Where yin and yang are not manifest, water and fire are harmed. Thus, beneath the level of a True Monarch or a Golden Core's elemental fire, the path was vast and empty. There existed only six fires: Impermanence, Lightless, Measureless, Ungraspable, Boundless, and Limitless.

Each of these six fires was an incredibly dangerous spiritual item. In the hands of a Great Daoist Master of True Qi, any one of them could shake the heavens and the earth.

'These three Holders of the Profound may not be top-tier experts, but they _are_ Holders. They can resonate with the Martial Cultivation Star. Even if they can only draw on fifty or sixty percent of its power... if Yang Ruiyi shows up, Wumeng will be in mortal danger!'

Helian Wujiang had relied on his own skill to preserve the Tiefu Kingdom's sovereignty among the tribes of Monan. He was no fool, and he trusted his intuition completely.

'We didn't come here just to stand guard. If we don't lure the people from the Wilderness out... force their hand... how will we ever grasp the true situation? Who knows who else is lying in wait inside the Great Void... We can't wait any longer!'

Throwing all caution to the wind, he thrust his Dharma sword forward, gritted his teeth, and roared,

"Murong Yan!"

Helian Wumeng was treading on a mountain of Baleful Qi, watching as Li Jiangxia was about to collapse under his assault. Suddenly, an intense premonition of danger seized him. His head snapped up, his expression changing.

The fabric of the Great Void rippled and tore open. A glistening white sword descended.

The sword was three chi and seven cun long, with six faces, each intricately carved with beast-mask cloud patterns. It flowed with an incomparably condensed Jade True radiance and a dazzling True Qi, and it was held in the hand of a sword cultivator.

Daoist Master Zhusheng—Liu Bai!

Liu Bai was an immensely famous sword cultivator from an extraordinary Dao lineage. Empowered by his mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivation in both Jade True and True Qi, the moment his sword appeared, the air filled with boundless killing intent.

Helian Wumeng, caught completely off guard, had a sudden, horrifying realization.

'That Lightless Water and Fire… it was blocking my perception of the Great Void! This was their real objective!'

But there was no time to think. The sword was already upon him.

"Clang!"

The dense Jade True light slammed into the divine, profound armor, releasing a world-shaking hum. The sword light was fluid and unrestrained, not striking directly but flowing like water, probing and entering from every angle. It passed through Helian Wumeng’s body, erupting in countless sparks of baleful light.

At that same instant, a deep grey radiance appeared. Murong Yan’s massive form emerged, a power radiating from him that turned the world grey and white. But a beam of white light arrived even faster, spinning through the air before stopping in front of him and transforming into a small, exquisite purple pavilion that seemed to span the horizon.

A woman with a calm, dignified bearing stood upon it, her hands forming a seal.

It was Tinglan.

The appearance of her and Liu Bai stunned the remaining combatants. Even Murong Yan froze for a second.

'Tinglan? Liu Bai? Then… who’s guarding Profound Peak? Does Yang Ruiyi think Gongsun Bei and Qi Lanyan are dead?!'

A shriek that threatened to pierce their eardrums ripped across the sky. Helian Wujiang’s eyes looked ready to split from rage as his Dharma sword shot forward at terrifying speed.

'Wumeng!'

The sword cultivator, however, did not pause for a fraction of a second. Liu Bai's robes billowed as his longsword merged with the flow of his power, flashing with six distinct lusters, resonating with his divine ability, and answering the call of the world.

'Green Jade Cliff!'

In that moment, Liu Bai and Helian Wumeng seemed to vanish from the world, falling into a separate dimension. A pale, azure-white light pooled beneath them, lifting them into the boundless white clouds of the heavens. Countless streams of sword light instantly merged into one and slashed down.

The Pacifying Baleful Uniting Jade Sword Art!

To be immobilized by a divine ability and struck at point-blank range by a Jade True sword cultivator comparable to a Great Daoist Master... how could one possibly survive?

"Voom!"

The armor on Helian Wumeng’s body let out a sharp, mournful cry. Battered by the Jade True marvel, it was instantly blasted from his body. Helian Wumeng, dressed in black with gray-silver eyes, was left completely exposed to the blade.

Before Helian Wujiang’s bloodshot eyes, Helian Wumeng’s limbs were shorn from his body, dissolving into thick Baleful Qi in the roiling Jade True sword light. The white blade, not yet finished, consolidated and stabbed straight at his glabella.

Though Helian Wumeng was suppressed by the Azure Jade Cliff, his Baleful Qi divine abilities instinctively activated to protect him. His power converged, but it shattered continuously under the white blade, letting out a piercing wail.

Just then, Helian Wumeng finally broke free from the technique's influence. As his eyes opened, they instantly exploded into a mist of blood under the sword light. Dark blood streamed down his face. The flesh between his brows split apart, and a single pill shot out.

The pill was the size of a fingertip, pure silver-white, like condensed mercury. Dazzling red sand and shimmering silver light flickered within its intricate patterns, shifting endlessly.

The Helian family’s secret treasure: the Iron Edict Elixir!

The roiling Jade True light seemed to hit a wall, scattering in all directions. An extremely condensed, multicolored light of the Whole Pill erupted from the elixir, pouring down and enveloping Helian Wumeng. Before their very eyes, the man’s body dissolved into a wisp of Valley Water and scattered like smoke.

He had actually escaped the Azure Jade Cliff.

This sudden turn of events was completely beyond Liu Bai's expectations. He forcefully altered his sword technique, redirecting it toward the dissipating Valley Water. But Helian Wujiang’s Dharma sword arrived just in time, blocking his path.

"Boom!"

A clap of thunder shook the heavens. Murong Yan had no time for words. His eyes swept the night sky, and just as he'd feared, that bastard Yehui was nowhere to be seen. He cursed inwardly and roared,

"Go!"

Faster than his shout, a torrent of blood-red Baleful Qi and a beam of pure white Jade True dharma power shot across the sky, one in front, one behind, in hot pursuit.

Amidst the flashing streams of light, Li Jiangliang reappeared, his brow furrowed with anxiety. He then heard Li Jianglong’s calm voice in his ear.

"He's fine."

Sure enough, a moment later, the man within the dense Baleful Qi—Li Jiangxia—coughed up some blood. He emerged, riding the residual waves of water and fire. He looked at his two brothers and grinned.

"Let's go!"

The three brothers exchanged a look. Without a single word, they rode the wind up to Tinglan’s Purple Qi pavilion. Below them, their army was already crossing the river, a relentless tide surging over the land.

Li Jiangliang, not even pausing to catch his breath, stepped forward and looked at Tinglan.

"Senior! What now...?"

Tinglan nodded to them, her expression slightly odd.

"We bypass the White Ye Immortal Sect, defend Baixiang while attacking Bianyan, and relieve the Tangdao."

...

_Drip_

Deep shadows flickered in the hall. A man in Daoist robes hurried up the steps. Seeing the main hall door ajar, he quickly bowed.

"Reporting!"

He could faintly hear the voices of the Daoist Masters inside.

"Jiexing... is it true the Old Sir doesn't have the Flawless Deficient Yin?"

"Well... this..."

"Your family has a long and noble legacy. An ancestor of yours once cultivated at the Unmoving Temple... I have always held your family in high esteem. If you would be willing to trade it to me... you can name any condition you wish!"

Although two Purple Mansion Realm experts were in discussion, the situation was urgent. The Daoist-robed man couldn't worry about etiquette. He dropped to his knees with a thud, his voice full of joy.

"Master! Great news! The Song forces have crossed the river from the Wilderness, just as predicted! They’ve bypassed Baiku, Baiye, and Panglu Ridge... they're heading straight for Chengshui Marsh!"

His voice rang out in the quiet courtyard. The door swung fully open, revealing a small table in the inner courtyard. Two figures, both appearing as youths, were seated at it, a game board between them.

The one on the left was Qi Lanyan.

The Daoist from Profound Governance, the man pulling the strings in Jiangbei, smiled faintly.

"Daoist Friend Tao, this is my new disciple, Fan Kang."

His opponent was none other than the young Daoist Master from the Tao family, the one with the uncanny eyes, Tao Jiexing, who had been brought here by Li Jieyi. Qi Lanyan had clearly invited him for a reason.

Hearing Qi Lanyan's words, Tao Jiexing looked immensely relieved. He nodded quickly.

"Since they've crossed the river, I... I'll go at once!"

Qi Lanyan looked slightly disappointed but could only let him leave. He sighed, listening as his disciple gave an energetic report on the events in the west. He nodded.

"It was Liu Bai, as expected. It seems Yang Ruiyi is personally leading the assault on Shanji, so they're rushing to reinforce Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain."

He raised his teacup, glancing with one eyebrow arched at Fan Kang, who was still kneeling.

"They crossed. So what? Let them go a little deeper. What's the rush?"

The Daoist-robed man sighed, his heart heavy.

"That time... the siege on the lake against Wei... against _him_. Disciple saw firsthand how difficult it is to change the world's destiny. How can I not be anxious, Master...?"

Qi Lanyan set down his cup. 

"Yehui's methods are superb," he said coolly. "Leave this to him. Has there been any disturbance at all along the Capital immortals Dao?"

"As for Li Zhouwei."

Qi Lanyan paused.

"Everything is proceeding for the better. The only difference in the world's situation is that Li Zhouwei's injuries are far more severe. Although that allowed Li Ximing to cultivate the World's Radiance... that man is a nobody. He's just coasting on Li Zhouwei's reputation and managed to get that Merging Fire. Send someone with a spiritual water treasure to collect his flame. Any early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator can handle him."

"This time, Yang Ruiyi cannot allow Li Zhouwei to stay on the sidelines. He will definitely follow Liu Bai and the others, just like last time. If we play this right, we can delay him for another five or six years without altering the grand scheme."

Fan Kang was silent for a long time, his mind clearly elsewhere. His voice was choked with emotion when he finally spoke.

"Disciple... Disciple just doesn't understand..."

"Back then, during the siege on the lake, Master said it was a trivial matter and not to report it to Lord Wei. As a result, we couldn't dispatch Murong Yan or Gao Fangjing. And now... now... Master still doesn't plan to consult Lord Wei!"

The Daoist-robed man began to weep.

"Disciple is thinking only of you and him... Why... Why is Lord Wei completely unconcerned with any of this?"

Qi Lanyan had listened to the first part in silence. But that last sentence made his expression change dramatically. His eyes turned ice-cold.

"What does a whelp like you know!" he snapped. "Lord Wei is seeking the Dao and on the Quest for Gold! How could he possibly concern himself with such sordid affairs? If something went wrong, who would bear the responsibility?"

"Besides... Besides!"

Qi Lanyan seemed to deflate, his expression darkening as a murderous intent flickered in his heart.

'Xu Che fears the Celestial Gate; slacking, he fails to become a Woven Jade Immortal. Zitong seeks to spread the Dao; arrogant, he dies before the throne... A person on the Quest for Gold can never trust another’s word on whether they will achieve the Dao... If I let you spread this, killing you a hundred, even a thousand times over wouldn't be enough!'

'What Heavenly Element... what Great Divination... they are all false prophecies! My death would be nothing. But Martial Uncle... he is such a genius, with such ambition and such virtue! If he cannot ascend to that position... what path is left for any cultivator in this world?'
