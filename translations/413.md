# Chapter 545: Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence

In front of him, the golden light spread out in countless radiances, drifting through the air lightly. Lu Jiangxian held it in his hand, feeling a warm, gentle sensation, as numerous illusions unfolded beside him, with all kinds of colors streaming gracefully.

These visions alternated between scenes of union between men and women, sparrows taking flight, and orioles chirping, to resplendent bursts of light, lonely smoke rising, and even images of emperors in reverence, receiving crowns and ascending thrones. Ultimately, they transformed into a pure, glowing orb.

A sudden insight dawned within him: this metallic essence was fully named Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence, embodying growth, union, the harmony of male and female, celestial light, bright fire... all things related to the Bright Yang.

"The Sun Seeker Ring is indeed unusual... It is likely that Xu Xiao extracted it from the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. As for how it came to be within that token, I'd need to get my hands on the Purple Mansion Realm artifact to truly understand!" Lu Jiangxian pondered aloud.

His mind had already begun to linger on the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. As the metallic essence danced in his hand, a wealth of insights came to him—this essence could be used to transform demonic creatures, influence fate, and establish bonds between individuals. Its potential was powerful and expansive.

"So, this is the nature of metallic essence... it is astonishing to witness such marvels from just a single wisp!"

Holding the wisp of Bright Yang Metallic Essence, Lu Jiangxian's initial amazement faded into a more pragmatic contemplation of how he might use it.

"First of all, this must not be given to anyone else..."

He quickly dismissed the idea of bestowing it upon anyone in the Li Family, because even if they had the capacity to wield it, this single wisp would likely cause significant trouble if released!

If his guess was correct—if this metallic essence were to fall into the world, it would instantly lead to unchecked indulgence, spontaneous births, rampant growth of all things, and finally transform into a monstrous evil, bringing about wanton killing and attracting the wrath of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

"After all, metallic essence is a rare treasure to a cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm, especially when the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment seems to be within the possession of Mount Luoxia..." Lu Jiangxian mumbled.

Having seen both the Six Ding Merging Fire Token and the Bright Yang Metallic Essence, Lu Jiangxian began to formulate deeper insights. The crafting of Purple Mansion Realm artifacts was likely closely tied to metallic essences.

The Six Ding Merging Fire Token, for example, might have been forged through Merging Fire and thereby imbued with the qualities of a malevolent creature, which would explain its peculiar effects.

"If that is the case, then the Sun Seeker Ring contains the Bright Yang essence, while the Six Ding Merging Fire Token likely embodies the Merging Fire essence. By that logic, this mirror... should also contain an essence..."

Lu Jiangxian pondered thoughtfully to himself, recalling the mirror's continuous outpouring of Supreme Yin Moonlight as he speculated further, "It seems undeniably to be of Supreme Yin essence... Judging by its abundance, could it contain the entire Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment? It's definitely more than just Supreme Yin, given how the Supreme Yin Moonlight flows endlessly; like an unending stream."

Lu Jiangxian had traveled widely over the last century, studying countless texts, yet he had never encountered a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in the Supreme Yin system. The few Supreme Yin and Lesser Yin methods he found were of low grade, with none capable of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm.

He had never heard of a Golden Core Realm cultivator in the Supreme Yin system either; only one ancient immortal called Yingze seemed possibly related to Supreme Yin or Yang systems, but that was several millennia ago.

"At the very least, this Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual could be refined a few more times!"

Looking over the Bright Yang Metallic Essence in his hand which was emanating a gentle warmth, Lu Jiangxian thought to himself, With this metallic essence in hand, I finally have some influence over the external world, though I must be cautious and remain discreet to avoid attracting the attention of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

After some deliberation, he acknowledged both the advantages and disadvantages of wielding the Bright Yang Metallic Essence. It could potentially manifest as divine light to injure enemies, but such use would squander its value, and he resolved to employ it sparingly.

As for members of the Li Family pursuing this path, there were no other Dao Partners in Yue State, and the Wei-Li bloodline obscured things well enough to prevent suspicion.

Only the north presented a concern as he thought silently, The Mahas in the north harbor an unshakable blood feud with the Wei-Li Clan, and now Mount Luoxia also has designs on Bright Yang Metallic Essence... the north is best avoided!

Fortunately, the Mahas seldom venture south unless they are reincarnated, and Luoxia remains aloof, unlikely to meddle across vast distances. The Eastern Sea contains several Bright Yang Dao lineages, so issues should be minimal.

Drawing his thoughts back from the metallic essence in hand, Lu Jiangxian began to reflect on the yield from his journey to the Eastern Sea.

During the trip, he accompanied the Li Family, but spent most of his time drifting on the sea, rarely disembarking. When they did find the Green Pine Temple ruins, they bore traces of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, so Lu Jiangxian refrained from peering in too deeply.

Nevertheless, he had managed to gather a considerable number of techniques which supplemented his understanding of Metallic Essence, allowing him to piece together some key insights.

"Many of the techniques had ancient origins, often containing references to Metallic Essence Fruition Attainments."

These findings often mentioned various Yin and Yang Fruition Attainments. Some sources referred to three Yin and four Yang, while others cited five Yin and four Yang. However, one fact seemed consistent—Yin and Yang Fruition Attainments were not equal in number.

Similarly, many Fruition Attainments seemed isolated, and suspiciously so. For example, Shamanic Talisman, Jade True, and Merging Owl... these Metallic Essences emerged independently and it was rare to find more than one associated cultivation technique.

With these questions resting in the back of his mind, he was quietly contemplating when a familiar feedback suddenly came from the link within the great void. Lu Jiangxian understood immediately.

Li Ximing has broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm!

At the time, Li Ximing had been cultivating on Mount Qingdu when the Bright Yang Essence had brushed past him. He cultivated the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual, the Bright Yang system. This was equivalent to having a peak Purple Mansion Realm expert use their divine abilities to secure his breakthrough. With the opportunity laid so plainly before him and if he still could not advance, he might as well find a rock to hit his head on.

"This child is indeed fortunate..."

Were it not that Li Ximing lacked any apparent thread of fate, Lu Jiangxian might have really thought he was a Fated One.

Born into a clan, nurtured by his entire family, innately gifted for alchemy, with a penchant for secluded cultivation that keeps him from venturing out unless in the direst circumstances... He seems almost like a Fated One. Throughout the entire clan, only he has hope of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm.

Returning his focus to the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual before him, Lu Jiangxian was confident that with the assistance of the metallic essence, he could elevate the manual to an even higher level!

Once this manual is refined, I can explore combining Metallic Essence with talisman qi!

Time in the mirror world always seemed to flow like water. Back then, Lu Jiangxian always felt lonely and bored, now, time felt almost scarce.

Qingdu Cave Dwelling.

The Sun Seeker Ring spun once in midair before it lightly drifted down again. As it settled, all the extraordinary visions within the cave dwelling disappeared. Li Xijun caught the ring and examined it closely. It looked no different from before, and its materials remained indistinct. It also felt surprisingly light in his hand.

Inspecting it with his spiritual sense, the Sun Seeker Ring seemed quite ordinary, almost as if it were just a simple flying shuttle, though its materials were unknown. If Li Xijun had not witnessed the speed at which Xu Xiao rode on it, he never would have guessed it was a treasured artifact.

Nearby, Li Qinghong checked the mirror, finding no anomalies either. Li Xijun murmured, "Aunt... this should not be a bad thing."

"Indeed..." Li Qinghong nodded. The two studied the artifact for a while but gained no further insights.

Li Xijun then added, "Aunt, the altar described in your thunder technique has been completed... It has not been used since you went abroad. Now that you are back, you could test out the Celestial Thunder."

Li Qinghong cultivated an ancient technique, with an immortal foundation capable of summoning thunder from the heavens. Yet, with heaven and earth undergoing such changes, she was not certain if the attempt would work. After nodding lightly, she put away the Sun Seeker Ring and returned the immortal mirror.

With everything finally in order, Li Xijun felt no regret about the lost opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, having secured so many other crucial items. After leaving, he flew for a while before landing in Lijing Town.

Kneeling figures lined the steps of the central hall, and a cursory glance revealed many familiar faces, mostly from the Liu and Xu families, all bowing their heads with sobs filling the air.

Seeing this, Li Xijun descended, and a Liu Family member immediately crawled over, tearfully recounting old ties and grievances. Li Xijun offered polite comfort before quickly moving along.

As he approached, the Jade Court Guards on both sides kneeled in respect. He stepped into the central hall, which was simply but elegantly arranged. At the highest seat sat a middle-aged man with a square face and broad forehead.

Li Xijun greeted, "Elder Brother."

This was Li Xicheng, the current head of the family, who had served as the leader for several years. His experience had granted him a more tempered demeanor. He greeted his approaching younger brother with a quiet voice, "It's been a while since I last saw you... The Liu and Xu families have been kneeling here for an entire night. What do you think, Eighth Brother?"

Li Xijun stepped back and, with a gesture, replied respectfully, "Elder Brother manages the family, and I would not presume to advise."

Li Xicheng smiled, straightening his posture.

"The Liu Family will not receive heavy punishment; a night of kneeling is enough. They have fallen far and have little left to penalize. Let them disperse. As for the Xu Family, I plan to split them into branches. Xu Xiao is dead, and his lineage will be removed from the records. The other Xu branches, having reported the devil cultivator, will receive rewards."

He continued, "Captain Chen was killed by Commander Chen Mufeng himself. We will report that he died from devil cultivation techniques. His family will receive protection, and Chen Mufeng will be demoted from a battalion commander to a court guard."

Li Xijun listened as his elder brother went on, "As for Elder Qiuyang, I sent him a reward, but he declined it and returned to farming... I can only pass it down to his son. Elder Qiuyang has contributed immensely, though none of his children have any spiritual orifice. He has received all the recognition we can offer, but with his dao path severed... there is little else we can give him."

Li Xijun nodded.

"Elder Brother handles these matters well; I need not say more. As for Chengliao, there are additional rewards coming from the mountain."

They spoke a while longer until Li Xijun cupped his fist, sensing weariness beneath his brother's composed demeanor. After dismissing the Jade Court Guards, he spoke gently, "Elder Brother, appoint more assistants if needed... Do not exhaust yourself. Your health is important, as is maintaining your cultivation."

Li Xicheng hesitated before nodding slowly, his gaze dropping.

"I personally promoted Chen Mufeng... I bear some responsibility for this outcome," he said softly with a regretful sigh.

Li Xijun was about to say something when he saw a servant from the Clan Affairs Courtyard approaching. The servant bowed deeply and said, "The old clan head has summoned the two of you."

"Uncle Yuanping?"

The two brothers exchanged a glance, realizing something was amiss, and their expressions turned grave. Li Xicheng then whispered, "I will go up the mountain right away."

Neither dared to delay. They hurried up the mountain, and indeed, a solemn air greeted them. Entering the courtyard, they saw people coming and going. As they stepped into the inner courtyard, they saw someone lying on a bed.

Li Yuanping's face was pale as he leaned against the edge of the bed. Li Qinghong sat beside him, while his wife, Madam Ren, who had only reached the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, sat nearby. She was in her forties, with a few wrinkles lining her face, and she was quietly sobbing.

The two kneeled in fear, and Li Yuanping scanned them briefly. Though his voice was weak, it remained gentle.

"Years ago, my brother and I kneeled before Ancestor Tongya's bed. His words still echo in my ears... In the blink of an eye, I cannot hold on any longer."

Li Xijun and Li Xicheng offered quiet words of comfort. Having studied under him for many years, Li Xicheng felt a deeper bond with him and could not help but tear up. Li Yuanping then asked, "Where is Li Ximing?"

Bracing himself, Li Xijun replied, "Brother Ming is currently in seclusion, breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

Li Yuanping gazed into the distance, his lips pale as he whispered, "It's alright then..."

Madam Dou supported him, stricken with grief. She was Li Xuanxuan's primary wife and had managed the household for a period of time. Now, at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, she had reached her limit, with no path forward.

Madam Dou had borne two sons for Li Xuanxuan. One by one, both had died before her eyes. Decades ago, she had bid farewell to Li Yuanxiu, and now she was about to lose Li Yuanping as well. Her hair had turned white, and she was powerless.

Li Yuanping glanced around, many words left unsaid, and could only murmur quietly, "Cheng'er, from now on... you will have to rely on yourself."

Li Xicheng could no longer hold back his tears. He bowed deeply while kneeling, striking his head on the ground twice. Li Yuanping waved a hand, silencing him, then looked toward Li Xijun, "Xijun, I will have to trouble you to clean up Ming'er's mess... When the elders are gone, the family will depend on you."

Li Xijun lifted his head, locking eyes with Li Yuanping. He understood that Yuanping knew everything. His brows relaxed, and he replied softly, "Xijun has only done what the younger generation should do."

Li Yuanping let out a faint, hollow laugh, his voice weakening, "Elder Sister, I entrust the family affairs to you and Brother."

He gradually sank down, a faint, almost inaudible sigh escaping from his throat.

"Ancestor, it is not that I have failed you... the heavens simply did not grant me more time..."

In the stillness that followed, the light in his eyes dimmed. Beside his pillow lay two handwritten books, which Li Qinghong, wiping away her tears, picked up. One was titled Tales of the Desert, a compilation of notes left by Li Jingtian, and the other was A Chronicle of Thirty-Two Years of Household Management.

He had only ordinary cultivation, worked tirelessly his entire life, and left behind no secret manuals or rare techniques. The only books he wrote contained merely his lifetime observations. Li Qinghong carefully put them away and rose to her feet.

Those kneeling below remained silent. Li Qinghong surveyed them and spoke softly, "Arrange everything well... I will take him to the ancestral hall."

Li Xicheng nodded with a choked reply while Li Xijun stood frozen to the spot, staring at Li Yuanping's hand, as if recalling something. His hand slowly caressed the Hanlin sword without a word.

Li Qinghong then ascended on the wind and entered the ancestral hall, first reading the two books before storing them on top of a table.

The ancestral hall remained as quiet as ever. Rows upon rows of memorial tablets lined the walls, with incense smoke flowing between them. Li Qinghong stood silently for a moment, then spoke softly, "Grandfather... My brother and I have both reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, yet without you here, the family feels unsteady, and our hearts are empty."

Li Qinghong had heard every word Li Yuanping spoke on his deathbed. The sadness lingered in her heart. Usually reserved, she rarely spoke so much, but she muttered to the tablet of Li Tongya for a while before finally leaving in silence.

She did not have time to dwell on her grief. She bathed, changed clothes, and lit incense, praying continuously for three months to prepare to ascend the altar.
