# Chapter 848: Entering the Fray

Riding the winds, Chen Yang led the lively group on their journey home. The black-robed man stroked his beard with a contented smile, while Fei Tongcai and his cousin, Fei Tonglu, laughed until their sides ached, reminiscing about days long past.

During their early years of cultivation, their ancestor, Fei Wangbai, had been struck down by a single sword strike from Si Yuanli in full view of the clan. The event had become an inner demon for nearly every member of the Fei family. Yet here the two were, recalling those times with faces full of blissful joy, not a shadow of gloom in sight.

After they crossed the river, a crowd of Fei family members came to welcome them. They called out greetings, puzzled by the group’s infectious cheerfulness but joining in the festive mood as they headed toward the lake.

They had just reached the northern shore when they saw a refined, scholarly-looking Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator waiting for them. It was Cui Jueyin, who was supposed to be guarding the river.

Cui Jueyin’s smile was frozen. He came face to face with Chen Yang and was about to speak when Chen Yang’s bright, cheerful voice boomed out.

"Greetings, Lord Cui! What a coincidence!"

The shout left Cui Jueyin stunned and suspicious. 'Who is this man?' he thought. 'The Chen Yang I know speaks in a deep, measured tone and rarely smiles. When has he ever laughed so heartily?' With his brows unfurrowed and his features relaxed, he looked almost like a different person.

"Protector Chen…" Cui Jueyin replied, his suspicion slowly fading. He adopted a gentle tone. "I am under orders from the Family Head to lead you and Daoist Friend Fei to the lake. The grand array on Cold Cloud Peak requires maintenance. The rest of you may find lodging at a nearby peak. I will not see you off."

Fei Tongcai nodded repeatedly and sent the others back with Fei Qingya. He and Chen Yang then joined Cui Jueyin, and the three of them flew toward the lake. When they arrived at the great hall, it was completely empty.

Cui Jueyin closed the heavy doors and smiled at Fei Tongcai.

"Daoist Friend, please rest for a moment. I will take Protector Chen to make his report."

Fei Tongcai nodded with a smile.

His attitude toward Cui Jueyin was bizarre. He was merely at the Qi Refining stage, yet when facing a peak Foundation Establishment Realm expert like Cui Jueyin, he neither bowed nor lowered his head. Not only did he lack the usual fear of a higher-level cultivator, but he also treated him with the casual familiarity of a colleague.

Chen Yang observed this without a hint of displeasure. As he walked out with Cui Jueyin, he began to chat amiably.

"Lord Cui, I met a true genius in Jiangbei… such indomitable pride, unbending in the face of power…"

Cui Jueyin, however, wore a conflicted expression and seemed reluctant to listen. He cut in, "About Fei Qingya…"

"We can discuss that in detail later!"

The two entered the main hall, which was also deserted except for Li Jiangqian, who sat in the center with a grim expression. He squinted, his gaze filled with apprehension as if he were facing two monstrous beasts.

As Chen Yang and Cui Jueyin came to a stop, Cui Jueyin dropped to his knees in a deep bow. Chen Yang offered a slight, casual nod of respect. Li Jiangqian set down the vermilion brush in his hand and lowered his head to read a scroll, saying nothing.

The atmosphere in the hall instantly froze. The cheerful smile on Chen Yang's face grew stiff. Cui Jueyin, kneeling firmly on the stone floor, felt a sheen of sweat form on his neck. Silence reigned.

As time ticked by, Cui Jueyin finally broke the quiet, his voice low.

"Reporting to the Family Head… I fear… Baiku Prefecture is indeed… where *that one* has taken residence."

Chen Yang remained standing ramrod straight, a look of utter confusion on his face. Seeing this, Cui Jueyin began to sweat profusely. He heard Li Jiangqian’s soft command.

"Wake Lord Chen up."

Cui Jueyin scrambled to his feet and began casting spells, unleashing one Dharma Art after another, but the Chen Yang before him remained unresponsive. Finally, Cui Jueyin rolled up his sleeves, and while Chen Yang was distracted, he delivered two heavy slaps across his face.

*Smack! Smack!*

He had put his full strength into the blows. Chen Yang’s cheeks flushed crimson as he staggered back two steps, a dazed look in his eyes. He collapsed to his knees with a thud, his lips trembling as if he wanted to speak, but no sound came out.

Li Jiangqian rose, still averting his gaze from Chen Yang. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw wisps of Purple Smoke drifting out and coiling on the floor. He immediately bowed low, his voice respectful.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

A woman in autumn-yellow robes stepped into the hall. Cui Jueyin reacted just as quickly, bowing reverently. Only Chen Yang remained standing stiffly in the center of the hall. He cupped his hands in a salute and asked, "May I ask which Daoist Master has graced us with her presence…?"

At this, even Li Jiangqian was at a loss for words. He remained kneeling and pleaded, "I beg the Daoist Master… to save him…"

Fortunately, Tinglan was magnanimous and chose to ignore the remark. She formed a sword finger with two fingers and lightly tapped the spot between Chen Yang's brows.

Chen Yang instantly stumbled back a step. His eyes flashed a brilliant yellow before erupting in a blinding light that burned them to cinders, leaving only two dark, empty sockets. He fell to the floor with a crash, the back of his robes visibly soaked with sweat.

He fumbled on the ground, kowtowing repeatedly while ignoring the bloody tears that dripped from his empty sockets. Tinglan casually plucked a sheet of paper from the desk, picked up the vermilion brush, and with a few deft strokes, drew a pair of eyes.

She tossed the paper toward Chen Yang's face. In an instant, two new eyeballs popped into the blackened sockets, and a blank sheet of paper fluttered to the floor.

Tinglan had not yet mastered the Life Divine Ability; destroying his eyes before recreating them was clearly a clever workaround. She allowed Chen Yang a moment to recover before speaking softly.

"Now that all the players are assembled on your side, the True Monarch will naturally appear. Not bad. Finding the Monarch so quickly saves a lot of trouble later…"

Her tone was light. She glanced at the still-bowing Chen Yang and chuckled. "You're quite capable yourself, to still have some sweat left to shed in the Monarch's presence."

Fear and apprehension were the only emotions left in Chen Yang's eyes. His hands, pressed against the floor for support, were pale and trembled slightly. Li Jiangqian spoke up respectfully, "Daoist Master, there is still a Qi Refining cultivator who personally saw the Monarch and returned. He is nearby… should we have him come in?"

Tinglan shook her head and took the main seat, a hint of shock in her expression. "There's no need to see him," she said gently. "He's beyond saving. His original consciousness has been completely annihilated. What's replaced it is whatever the Monarch imagines him to be. If the Monarch thinks he's cheerful, he's cheerful. If he thinks he's optimistic, he's optimistic. If one day the Monarch thinks he should go rescue him, he'll grab a sword and go. No one can save him."

"As for… you…" Tinglan looked at Chen Yang. "You are a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, after all, and I intervened in time. Just lie low until the Monarch leaves, and this matter will be over."

In that short time, Li Jiangqian had observed a great deal. Chen Yang had been acting strangely, yet Cui Jueyin had been completely oblivious until the end. The influence was clearly far more widespread than he had imagined. "Should we isolate him… have him stay alone?" he asked quietly.

Tinglan considered this for a moment. "That's up to you. As long as you don't mention the Monarch's affairs, he's harmless. But it's best to have as little contact as possible."

"As for that young lady…" Tinglan's gaze swept over them again. "Give her a quiet environment, and assign a few female cultivators from the Fei family to live with her. There's no need to pick the talented ones."

Li Jiangqian nodded quickly. "This junior understands."

Tinglan's voice took on a meaningful tone. "You must understand, the Monarch will leave sooner or later, but *they* might not be able to. Even as a mortal, they are a prize. Not even a corpse would be left of them. If she's a cultivator… her uses are even greater. The willful and arrogant ones are not useful, but the obedient, cute, aloof, and cold ones… they are excellent material…"

Li Jiangqian looked up slightly, sudden understanding dawning in his eyes. A flash of killing intent sparked within him before he quickly suppressed it. "Thank you for the guidance, Daoist Master!"

Tinglan continued in a leisurely manner, "Ning Wan is watching over Li Quantao and his son, as well as matters in Jiangbei. It was convenient for me to make this trip."

She looked at Li Jiangqian and smiled. "The Li clan is truly of the Wei-Li lineage, and Li Zhouwei is a true White Qilin. Excellent, indeed. A match for Tu Longjian!"

The remark seemed to come out of nowhere, but Li Jiangqian understood her meaning perfectly. She was complimenting him for remaining largely unaffected, for being able to command the situation calmly through these bizarre changes. It had deepened her and the other Daoist Masters' conviction in the Li family's bloodline.

'A son of the White Qilin… a Golden Core bloodline… Only that can grant one a slight escape from the Monarch's influence.'

With those words, she dissolved into Purple Smoke and vanished. Li Jiangqian respectfully bid her farewell, then calmly raised his head and sat in the main seat. Below, Chen Yang was drenched in sweat, clearly terrified by his own actions on the journey back.

Li Jiangqian paused for a moment, then smiled. "Protector Chen! Regarding the Daoist Master's decree… how should we select these women from the Fei family?"

Chen Yang replied respectfully, "The jealous, the restless, the troublemakers, and those from branches unrelated to ours… supplement them with one or two gentle, kind ones who are our kin."

"A group of female cultivators will always have drama," he continued. "We'll just send them resources. If the Monarch arrives here and becomes displeased, should he want some entertainment, this will give him a quick way to vent. No matter what, the Fei family is his maternal family, and his time is tight. He won't linger in Jiangnan."

Li Jiangqian smiled. "It seems Protector Chen has returned to us."

He picked up his brush, his mind racing. 'The Daoist Master's meaning is clear. I wonder which immortal sects will get ideas about Fei Qingya. Driving a wedge between her and the Fei family in advance is good for my clan and for the other sects. After all, it's an awkward situation.'

'Thinking back, the incident with Chu Yi last time was in Yufu Prefecture, right near the Purple Smoke Gate…'

Making the connection, Li Jiangqian looked up and asked, "The current rising star of the Purple Smoke Gate's Mu Zuo Peak, Qian Lizi… she must be around a hundred years old now, right? Protector Cui, do you know her name?"

Cui Jueyin thought for a moment. "I believe… her surname is Han? As for her given name… that's difficult to know. She has used her Daoist title since joining the sect, so it's hard to find out her original name."

"I understand." Li Jiangqian nodded, deep in thought. "Protector Chen will be fully in charge of the Fei Qingya matter. Replace everyone who has had contact with her with female attendants. Lock down the mountain peaks where she cultivates, and don't let anyone in…"

"Especially my family members."

A plan had already formed in Li Jiangqian's mind.

'Since Daoist Master Tinglan said the Monarch makes things what he thinks they are, Chen Yang has already become an amiable and approachable senior in his mind. Perhaps if he goes over early, that wastrel will make a move, letting Chen Yang step in to help and set up some three-month agreement…'

'And since an amiable senior is representing my Li clan, whatever happens at Cold Cloud Peak probably won't be blamed on us. Let them deal with the fallout themselves…'

He added another instruction to put Chen Yang's mind at ease. "You don't need to have contact with her normally. When the True Monarch arrives, find an excuse to go into seclusion. There's no need for you to meet him again."

"Yes!"

Chen Yang’s expression finally calmed. He received his orders and exited through a side door. Li Jiangqian considered for a moment more, then commanded:

"Have Fei Qing'yi come up."

Soon, a man entered from outside the hall. He had been stuck on the island since his breakthrough, unable to even leave the main hall. His face was etched with anxiety as he bowed before the throne. "Greetings, Family Head," he said cautiously.

Li Jiangqian’s face was a mask of profound disappointment. He descended from his seat, his tone laced with frustration. "Daoist Master Tinglan just left!"

The words terrified Fei Qing'yi, who immediately kowtowed, his body tense with nervousness. Li Jiangqian pressed on, "How many times have I told you! The matter in Jiangbei is of utmost importance to the Daoist Masters! Who knows how many Purple Mansion Realm experts are involved, and you nearly ruined their grand plans! If not for our clan's intervention, the entire Fei family would have become a stepping stone for others!"

Fei Qing'yi had never imagined the situation was so dire. He remained frozen in place as Li Jiangqian continued coldly, "Listen well. The current Fei Tongcai has been afflicted by a spell art. No one is to see him. I will send him to guard a ferry crossing near Jiangbei, a post within our territory. His resources will be several times what your branch receives, and the benefits will be far greater. When the time is up, we will bring him back."

Fei Qing'yi started to thank him, but Li Jiangqian waved his hand dismissively. "There is something more important… Although Fei Qingya is unaware, she is the reincarnation of a Daoist Master. She is no longer a member of your Fei family. The Daoist Masters have given specific instructions: her cultivation technique is special and cannot be tainted by worldly ties. She is forbidden from seeing anyone and will cultivate on your Cold Cloud Peak. I will seal off those mountain peaks and leave a few people to accompany her. If anyone from your family disturbs her, it will be a crime punishable by the extermination of your entire clan."

Fei Qing'yi could never have predicted such a turn of events. A chill washed over him. 'Without a Purple Mansion Realm expert, we have no right to know anything… we're just cannon fodder.'

Li Jiangqian continued, "I am telling you this secret so you can control your family members. If it leaks and attracts enemies, not only will your Fei family be wiped out for harboring her, but my clan will also suffer greatly."

His tone softened slightly. "Daoist Friend Fei, these matters are top secret, known only to myself, Lord Cui, and a few others. I am telling you this out of the deep friendship between our families, so you understand the gravity of the situation. It is extremely serious. Because a direct descendant of your family appeared and disrupted their plans—and they couldn't just kill him out of respect for my clan—the Purple Mansion Realm experts are very displeased."

"This subordinate understands!" Fei Qing'yi's hand, extending from his sleeve, was trembling.

Li Jiangqian sighed. "This being reincarnated into Fei Qingya… in her past life, she cultivated the Way of Heartlessness. That's why she cultivates Cold Qi. If you behave, nothing will happen. But if you get too involved, too close, and something goes wrong when she is proving her Dao… and she needs to kill to sever her emotional ties, that is no laughing matter."

He had thoroughly intimidated Fei Qing'yi, who now began to thank him with fawning gratitude. Beside them, Cui Jueyin didn't dare lift his head. Only then did Li Jiangqian say, "Lord Cui, go with him. Handle this matter properly. Do not meet her personally; let the people we arranged earlier handle everything."

The two men quickly retreated. Li Jiangqian returned to his seat and let out a long, frustrated sigh.

He could never tell Fei Qing'yi the truth. One could never underestimate human greed. If Fei Qing'yi learned that his own relative had become a True Monarch's consort, it would undoubtedly trigger a terrifying disturbance. No matter how much he warned him to stay away, the man would assume it was a bluff and try to get closer.

However, the excuse for bringing Fei Qingya back had been Fei Qing'yi's breakthrough; he couldn't just lock him up and be done with it. He would remain a huge liability. For now, this elaborate deception was the only way to make everything fit with the series of commands that had been issued.

'I'll just have to play it by ear…'

He picked up his brush and wrote several more orders, frowning. "I also need to see the Old Master. I'll have him confine Uncle Zhouming. He'll have to suffer for a bit…"
