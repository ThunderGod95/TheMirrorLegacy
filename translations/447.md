# Chapter 618: Wandering Through the Great Void

Li Xuanfeng stepped out of the ancestral hall. The rain outside had lessened, but droplets still fell rhythmically onto the stone steps. His black-gold boots splashed through a shallow puddle of water collected at the threshold.

He glanced into the water, where his reflection gazed back—a face marked by age. His temples had turned white, his eyebrows thinned, and the lines of his face had blurred. His lips had grown thinner, and his deep-set eyes betrayed neither triumph nor joy but rather the weariness of one who had endured the pain of parting with life and death.

Li Xuanfeng was startled to realize how aged he had become. In that instant, he became aware of the toll taken by eighty years of struggle and hardship. Like most cultivators of the world, though his life expectancy placed him in his prime, the battles he had endured had left him prematurely weathered, unrecognizable from his youth.

He stepped into the main hall, where the threshold now seemed far higher than it had been in his younger years, rising all the way to his calves.

The juniors stood in rows along the sides. His elder brother, Li Xuanxuan, now a frail shadow of his former self, trembled as he stood at the highest position. Behind him stood a youth dressed in mourning robes, who was likely Li Ximing.

Further down stood Li Qinghong of the second branch, flanked by Li Xijun and Li Xicheng. Behind them, a scattered group of younger descendants waited. Li Yuexiang stood in a corner, accompanied by a hunched man dressed in black. A faint aura of demonic qi surrounded him, and he remained silent.

Li Xuanfeng immediately recognized the figure as a Hooked Serpent demon but refrained from commenting. Li Xuanxuan, his eyes brimming with tears, approached him and simply took his hand, saying, "Come, come."

In his youth, Li Xuanxuan had always ceded the spotlight to his younger brother whenever Li Xuanfeng was present, subtly stepping aside to give way to the more gifted sibling. Even now, he deferred, guiding his brother to the seat of honor.

The rest of the family bowed deeply and called out in unison, "Greetings to the Ancestor! Welcome home!"

Li Xuanfeng responded, "Rise."

Li Xuanfeng's gray eyes swept over the gathered family. He noted who met his gaze directly and who lowered their eyes in silence. He quickly discerned the state of the household. Having fought his way through rivers of blood in the southern border, his presence exuded a fearsome and commanding aura. His brief silence immediately drew the full attention of the room.

In a low voice, he began, "Yuanjiao perished in the grotto heaven. I have returned to bring his belongings home."

The assembled family remained silent, prepared for the news. Li Xuanxuan closed his eyes slowly, as though he had anticipated this outcome. Though the younger generation had tried to shield him from the truth, their expressions had long betrayed the reality of the situation.

Upon learning that only Li Xuanfeng had returned, the events that transpired within the grotto heaven became self-evident.

Li Xuanfeng could see the pain in his brother's face and chose not to dwell on it. Instead, he retrieved several jade slips from his storage pouch. Fixing his gaze on the gathering, he called out in a steady voice, "Li Wushao."

The black-clad youth dropped to his knees with a resounding thud, the sound echoing against the steady patter of rain outside. Li Xuanfeng narrowed his eyes slightly. Having slain countless demons, his mere glance struck terror into this Hooked Serpent, who now pressed his forehead firmly to the ground.

Li Xuanfeng said, "Li Wushao, Qinghong has spoken of your diligence, and Yuanjiao freed your spirituality before his passing. You are no longer bound to our family. If you have somewhere else to go, you may leave freely."

Li Wushao dared not say much. After all, the Li Family had treated him generously over the years, and as a loyal servant, his life within the family had been secure and comfortable. Returning to the Eastern Sea would only render him prey, a mere morsel for the dragon clans. Bowing deeply, he rasped, "Wushao is but a lowly demon, indebted to my late master's kindness. I would never dare to betray that bond."

Li Xuanfeng, uncertain about the rank of his family's demon-suppressing techniques, hesitated briefly. Before he could respond, a handsome young man stepped forward from the crowd. Carrying a sword on his back, his clear eyes were calm and resolute as he said respectfully, "Our family has rules for such matters. Why not leave this to Xijun for resolution?"

Li Xuanfeng nodded in agreement, then unrolled a series of jade slips in his hand. Speaking softly, he announced, "These three manuals were acquired from within the grotto heaven: Wei Radiant Celestial Pass Technique, Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique, and Azure Serpent's Return Technique. All are ancient techniques tied to our family. Except for the thunder technique, the others lack spiritual qi, but they can still be cultivated if the opportunity arises."

He handed over the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique with a glance at Li Qinghong. "As for this one, Qinghong, study it carefully."

Li Qinghong accepted it with a nod. Li Xuanfeng continued, "There are three Embryonic Breathing Realm manuals here as well. Two are Grade Four: Six Chapters Seeking Immortality and Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique. The last is a Grade Five Embryonic Breathing Realm manual, Insights of Taihua."

"A Grade Five technique!" The crowd murmured in astonishment.

Li Xuanfeng didn't pause, producing a deep golden halberd next. Its shaft curved like a crescent moon and was taller than an average man. "This is an artifact from ancient Bright Yang. The family may put it to use."

One by one, he laid out various rare spirit items. Finally, he brought forth a violet, circular jade talisman, presenting it with great solemnity. "This is a Purple Mansion Realm Talisman. When infused with mana, it can be activated. It shall be used to stabilize the family's fortune."

His gaze swept across the gathered faces. Seeing no trace of greed, his heart settled with some satisfaction. He gestured for Li Xuanxuan and said softly, "Elder brother, let us talk privately."

Li Xuanfeng hadn't seen his elder brother for decades. Though he'd returned this year, his responsibilities in the Eastern Sea meant he wouldn't be able to visit often. Faced with his brother now, he found himself at a loss for words.

Li Xuanxuan simply waved a hand. A faint, clear light emanated from several of his orifices, revealing the formation that the Hengzhu Dao Gate had placed upon him long ago. Accepting a jade box from Li Xuanfeng, he said hoarsely, "I shall see to burying Jiao'er."

He shuffled unsteadily down the steps. Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng took a moment to stroll around the area. Despite the potent medicinal properties of the pills provided by Tu Longjian, his internal injuries had yet to fully heal. He decided to prioritize his recovery and went off to tend to his wounds.

At the same time, the two elders retreated to the back courtyard, while those in the main hall rose to their feet. Li Ximing cupped his fist and said, "The elixirs required by the clan this year will be available tomorrow. Send someone to retrieve them from my Alchemy Pavilion."

Leaving these words, he departed. Li Yuexiang was preparing to take her leave when Li Qinghong stopped her gently, saying, "Your elder brother is stationed in the sect. The branch line must have someone to speak for it."

Li Yuexiang paused, nodded, and stayed. The group then divided the techniques. The Grade Five Embryonic Breathing Realm technique, Insights of Taihua, was naturally set aside as a secret manual for the main family. As always, the Li Family treated outsiders with generosity. The Grade Four techniques, Six Chapters Seeking Immortality and Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique, were allocated to the descendants of meritorious contributors.

As for ordinary external members and offshoot cultivators, they were already entitled to Grade Three Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques. This level of generosity was significant, rivaling what some other clans might reserve for their less-favored direct descendants.

Li Qinghong studied the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique carefully, pondering over it for some time. In her estimation, it did not surpass the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique significantly, save for its lack of reproductive side effects. However, it did not reduce life force consumption much either.

"Strange… This seems to be a result of changes in the world, not a flaw in the technique itself." Li Qinghong's mastery of lightning techniques was already profound. With two ancient lightning manuals in hand, she quickly made her judgment. She murmured, "Still, it contains many insights worth referencing. The Eastern Sea is currently experiencing Falling Water Rising Storm. Once the family stabilizes, I will retreat to an offshore island for seclusion."

Li Qinghong surveyed the group, and after a brief discussion about the family's recent changes, found no significant issues. Li Xijun then spoke softly, "News has arrived from outside. Ancestor Yuan Licheng of the Yuan Family failed in his Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough and perished in meditation. This prolonged rain outside is likely the celestial phenomenon marking his death."

Li Qinghong, prompted by this comment, recalled something and said quietly, "When I was fighting for treasures near Green Pine Island, I saved someone from the Han Family. I overheard that a Yuan Family cultivator had died. After all, they are allies..."

Li Xijun nodded, "I have already sent someone to investigate."

Li Qinghong frowned slightly and remarked, "I have heard that Ancestor Yuan Licheng once studied under Daoist Master Buzi. Later, he was exiled for committing a transgression. Now that Buzi is missing, and Yuan Licheng has passed, the Yuan Family is likely to face a difficult period."

Li Xijun looked at the unrelenting downpour in the sky and nodded slightly, "Let us hope this does not affect the sect. If we count the days, Brother Xizhi should be close to breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

In the world within the Mirror.

Lu Jiangxian held the Bright Yang Metallic Essence in his hand, and with his elevated inherent rank, he had spent half a month carefully linking it to the fetus before cautiously withdrawing.

Because it was still an unborn child, he dared not establish too deep a connection, fearing that the Bright Yang might ignite and destroy both mother and child. The task was extremely delicate; even with his mastery of immortal techniques, it had taken him half a month to establish a preliminary connection. Had it been his earlier self, such a complex task would have been impossible.

"Though difficult, it was flawless!" Lu Jiangxian marveled at the brilliance of his method.

Using the mirror's undetectable properties, he stored the Metallic Essence within the mirror and subtly extended its influence outward. Coupled with the True Insight Profound Method, even if Pristine Water personally inspected it, unless they first located the mirror itself, they would be unable to detect the child's anomaly. They would simply assume the child was born bearing a thread of fate.

As Lu Jiangxian admired his ingenuity, the mirror grew increasingly radiant with the fusion of the jade buckle. Retracting his divine sense, he closed his eyes and immersed himself in the experience.

It had been far too long since Lu Jiangxian had acquired a new component for the mirror. Compared to his earlier days in this realm—when pieces came one after another, rendering him unconscious for years—this jade buckle caused only a slight weariness.

"Three Talisman Seeds, the Supreme Yin Profound Light raised to the Purple Mansion Realm... these are but secondary gains." These upgrades did not move him deeply. Over the past half month, the jade buckle had gradually dissolved, granting the mirror a new, special ability. "Traversing the Great Void!"

The jade buckle had seemingly been the immortal mirror's original mechanism for entering the Great Void, but it had been extracted and condensed into its current form. Now, with its reintegration, this capability was restored to the mirror.

Lu Jiangxian finally let out a long breath of relief. After toiling in this realm for so many years, the immortal mirror could now connect to the Great Void and traverse it freely. Combined with the mirror's inscrutable nature, it meant that no one below the Golden Core Realm could hope to reach him.

Moreover, he no longer needed to be carted across the world by others. The immortal mirror could now float within the Great Void, allowing him to descend from any Talisman Seed at will.

Not only that, he could use the Great Void to communicate with any Talisman Seed and unleash the Supreme Yin Profound Light in a grand display, annihilating his enemies. This meant that if Lu Jiangxian resolved to kill a cultivator in the Purple Mansion Realm, there were few places in the world where they could hide.

Of course, the Great Void was an unpredictable realm filled with countless demons and entities. Attempting to strike across vast distances from within it was akin to lighting firecrackers next to slumbering Golden Core Realm cultivators.

With his thoughts sorted, Lu Jiangxian's spirits soared. Slowly forming a hand seal, the ritual altar outside—engraved with intricate patterns—began to transform. The pale grayish-blue surface of the mirror gradually turned bright white. Lu Jiangxian felt a chill spread through his entire being, and the illusions around him dissipated as the mirror vanished from its place.

————

Li Xuanfeng spent only half a month in seclusion, during which his injuries recovered significantly, almost to seventy or eighty percent. After all, the medicinal salve he applied was a rare treasure, with a single dose costing over a hundred and eighty spirit stones. Its efficacy was naturally remarkable.

"It is effective, but still... it cannot always be calculated like this..." Li Xuanfeng shook his head.

Upon reaching the late Foundation Establishment Realm or even the Purple Mansion Realm, the value of spirit stones diminished significantly. Genuine Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts, elixirs, and precious spiritual qi or spirit water were rarely traded with spirit stones. Instead, bartering became the norm.

He touched the storage pouch at his waist, taking out several letters and a few artifacts. Reflecting to himself, he thought, I will need to find an opportunity... to circle around the lake.

Back during the Azure Pond Sect's recruitment, he was not the only one from the family to leave for the southern border. Over the years, many of those who had left had either perished or suffered grievous wounds, leaving only a few still alive.

Upon hearing that Li Xuanfeng was leaving the southern border, these cultivators naturally wrote him letters. For those who had passed away, their relics were entrusted to the city for safekeeping. Since they had fought alongside him, the sentiment still lingered, and Li Xuanfeng felt obliged to visit the families of his fallen comrades to return their belongings.

As Li Xuanfeng pondered these matters, he slowly adjusted his breathing. Soon after, he emerged from the cave dwelling, his thoughts shifting, The immortal mirror absorbed the jade buckle but has not shown any reaction for some time. I should go check on it.

He made his way to the secret chamber, raising his brow slightly as a pang of alarm surged through his chest. To his astonishment, the altar stood empty, devoid of anything.

"What!" He froze briefly, his heart suddenly sinking. However, he faintly sensed something still present before him. Focusing his gaze, he noticed that the talisman seed within his body stirred. To his shock, a faint, illusory shadow appeared on the altar. "This is... an entry into the Great Void?"

At that moment, an intangible ripple spread outward. Outside, Li Qinghong abruptly lifted her head, her expression revealing a trace of joy. Her gaze seemed to pierce through the clouds, sensing the immortal mirror's shadow in a certain direction.

On a stone path, Li Xijun also raised his brow sharply, an instant comprehension flooding his mind. Just as a look of astonishment crossed his face, the golden and resplendent Alchemy Pavilion before him emitted a loud explosion, releasing a column of crimson flames. Li Ximing emerged from the flames, covered in soot. It was evident that the sudden realization had disrupted his pill refinement.

The two brothers exchanged glances and nodded in unison. Li Xijun spoke in a low voice, "It is the jade buckle!"

Li Ximing, highly gifted in alchemy, rarely experienced cauldron explosions. This was his first time ending up in such a disheveled state. With a casual wave, he cast a cleansing spell on himself and hurriedly joined Li Xijun in heading toward the ancestral hall.

Meanwhile, within the secret chamber, Li Xuanfeng continued to gaze at the now empty altar. Having encountered and learned much during his time in the southern border and through his interactions with Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, he quickly pieced together the situation. Numerous thoughts flashed through his mind as he deliberated before removing the Qingche Sword from his waist.

When Li Yuanjiao designed the altar, he had carefully considered various contingencies, even preparing for the possibility of using the Qingche Sword as a substitute. Li Xuanfeng gently placed the sword on the altar. It fit perfectly, as though it had always belonged there.

Behind him, the stone door shifted slightly, and several direct descendants of the Li Family hurried in. Li Xuanfeng waved his hand, signaling for them to leave.
