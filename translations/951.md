# Chapter 951: Perilous Tread

The Eastern Sea churned with restless waves.

Two streaks of light, one white and one gold, arrived in a flash. They crossed the churning waters and soon sighted Long Helm Island, shaped like a suit of armor.

Compared to its desolation over the years, Long Helm Island was now a bustling place. Cultivators in uniform attire flew back and forth, all busy Li family members dispatched here in recent years.

The two passed directly through the Great Void and landed on the island. Beneath the island's palace, levels of steps had been carved, leading deep underground. The pair descended, quickly arriving above the baleful lake.

In the pitch-blackness, the Wave-Suppressing Mansion sat atop the Dark-Seal Baleful Liquid, appearing exceptionally tall and noble. Endless baleful gales shrouded the air above it. The place was not only empty, but compared to when they had left, there was not the slightest trace of change.

The Li family's rules were strict. With no Purple Mansion Realm expert guarding it and no orders coming from the lake, the cultivators on the island feared disrupting something and did not dare set foot here. Li Ximing smiled faintly and said, "Please."

Liu Changdie's face was filled with astonishment. He had clearly sensed the wondrous nature of the array. He stroked his beard, his eyes flashing with surprise, too astonished for words. He only said, "What a treasure! A true work of heaven-defying creation!"

The two entered the Wave-Suppressing Mansion together, greeted by a vast, circular hall. The walls were carved with entwined turtles and terrapins, an intricate dance of black and white. Tables of deep blue with gold-inlaid patterns were arrayed neatly. The atmosphere was one of grandeur and majesty.

Li Ximing's gaze naturally locked onto the Feather Transformation Pool. The pool's water had become as warm and lustrous as jade, emitting waves of soft white light.

From the time he left this place, traveled to and from Poluoduo, and then refined several pills in succession, a full year had passed.

Now, the water in the pool was just one final step away from coalescing into a set of Neck Feathers!

Liu Changdie's perception was extremely sharp. Almost in sync with him, his gaze fell upon the Feather Transformation Pool in the center of the hall. He strode forward, leaned down, and stared intently at the pristine white dharma pool, shaken beyond words.

"Ximing... do you have control of this grand array?"

Li Ximing was the sole master of the Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array, so it moved like an extension of his own limbs. With a mere thought, his spiritual sense connected to the array and instantly recorded Liu Changdie's aura.

The moment Liu Changdie connected to the array, he pressed his hands to the pool's edge without hesitation. Streaks of silver light immediately began to flow around the water, accompanied by the clinking and clanking of chains.

"Vault-Beam Silver!"

The white water in the pool swirled rapidly. The water level dropped, vanishing completely in an instant. A silvery-white, metallic-looking feather lay at the bottom of the empty pool.

The Neck Feathers.

'So fast!'

Li Ximing used a divine ability to retrieve it, placing it in a box with satisfaction. Liu Changdie, however, remained focused. He gently brushed the white jade at the bottom of the pool. The surface swiftly turned transparent, revealing countless runes embedded within.

He stared, transfixed. A silvery-white light surfaced in his eyes as they reflected the myriad runes, as if he were using a divine ability to rapidly record them. He murmured, "Such an ingenious concept! How is this any different from creating a spirit tree or spirit flower from scratch! There must be a Water Mansion treasure here, borrowing its very 'position'!"

Li Ximing was stunned. Although he held the array disk, he couldn't tell what materials had been used. He mused internally, 'I already have the Profound Lake Primal Essence. Could there be something else hidden within the array? That would make sense!'

Liu Changdie looked up, his eyes blazing. "Ximing, if you dismantle the Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array, you will definitely be rewarded!"

"..."

Li Ximing put on an awkward expression of sudden realization. Liu Changdie, however, waved his hands, answering his own question. "No, it cannot be dismantled! It mustn't! Such a precious technique from a senior... it must be studied properly!"

He simply left Li Ximing standing to the side, becoming completely engrossed. Fortunately, he retained some lucidity. Though his eyes wouldn't move, he managed to say, "Please, lend me this treasured place for a time! Rest assured, Ximing, with the Vault-Beam Silver, the condensation speed of this spirit item will be at least half a year faster!"

Li Ximing nodded, satisfied. He subconsciously touched his waist and felt his jade pendant warm up. He knew Li Zhouwei had sent someone to retrieve the Profound Shell Flower-Leaves from the Golden Feather Sect.

'I can go to the grotto-heaven immediately and refine these leaves into pills. We can both take them.'

Thus, he wasted no time and made an excuse to leave. Liu Changdie, however, stood up abruptly, looking hurried. "Let's go out together. It's inconvenient for me on the island. Ximing, why don't you assign someone to run errands for me."

"That's easily done!"

The two Daoist Masters immediately exited the earth veins, traversed the Great Void, and landed in the main palace. The white-robed man in the main hall was startled and hurried over to greet them. "This subordinate pays his respects to the Daoist Masters!"

An Siwei was dressed in white. Though he still had the appearance of a middle-aged man, his entire demeanor had taken on a mature, almost aged quality. He had grown a long beard and removed the gold rings he used to wear, appearing very plain.

As the Li family's first Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator with an outside surname, An Siwei's talent wasn't terrible. Unfortunately, his cultivation technique was not profound, nor had he enjoyed abundant resources in his youth. He had only just broken through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. With the North-South conflict raging, sending him into battle would be a death sentence. Thus, he had been dispatched here along with Li Wen.

On the Riverbank, he might have been the most useless of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, perhaps even worse than Li Wen. But out here, he had no problem clashing with a few demonic cultivators. He was also loyal, making this a position that suited him well.

Li Ximing felt a sense of warmth seeing him. As they flew toward the center of the island, he asked about his recent life. Liu Changdie, however, wore a complex expression. He suddenly asked, "That An Zheyan... how is he now?"

An Siwei was stunned for a moment, then recalled that this Daoist Master had visited the Li family years ago. Perhaps they were acquainted. At the mention of his father, sadness clouded his face, and he quickly replied, "Father... he is ancient. He was retired at home, but he kept raising a fuss, insisting on seeing me. His time must be near. He was brought to the island yesterday... his mind is no longer clear. He just keeps shouting for duck soup..."

"Oh!" Liu Changdie replied. He adjusted his robes, his expression complicated, and asked, "Where is the old man? I shall go and see him!"

Liu Changdie knew An Zheyan. When he had been constructing the array for the Li family, the old man had been his liaison. Not only that, they had known each other in a past life... The first fortune he ever made... was from taking a spirit herb from Lixia Prefecture that An Zheyan was meant to discover in his prime.

Although he had been plagued by inner demons back then, he eventually attained great enlightenment, transforming all his obsessions into the will to seek the Dao, break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, and right his wrongs. But facing this scene now, his heart filled with an indescribable bitterness.

'In my past life, Old Man An was nowhere near the end of his lifespan at this point. I heard he was even trying to gather resources to make an attempt on the Foundation Establishment Realm... Seeing him like this... perhaps he simply lost the heart to continue.'

Li Ximing also felt a pang of sympathy. Since Liu Changdie wished it, he nodded his assent. The three descended and soon found the man in a courtyard.

The old man's head was still gleaming bald, but the white whiskers on his temples and chin were extremely long, hanging down to his chest. A leather cap hung from the side of his chair. He was leaning back, one hand on the armrest, the other on his forehead, looking drowsy.

The moment An Siwei entered the room, the old man shot upright. His eyes, wide and turbid, stared out. "Jingming! Is the Yu family here?"

An Siwei's face paled slightly. He moved forward to support him, speaking softly, "Father, a Daoist Master is here to see you."

Li Ximing remained silent. He remembered seeing him in his childhood: a strong, slightly simple and honest man. Although he had heard that An Zheyan was once a brutal Family Head, in all his years with the Li family, he had been a gentle and sentimental old man.

'There's no essence, energy, or spirit left in him. He's being kept alive solely by a few spirit medicines the An family managed to scrounge up...'

As Li Ximing stood silently, Liu Changdie's eyes reddened. He stood frozen in place. "Old Man An... Old Man An..."

The old man on the chair showed no reaction. Even hearing the words "Daoist Master," he merely groaned, his mouth trembling open. "Aiya... you... why haven't you left yet!"

Tears welled in An Siwei's eyes. "It's me... Siwei."

An Zheyan stared at him blankly, as if suddenly remembering something. His two old, withered hands shot out and grasped his. "Must... avoid wine... and avoid women..."

"Yes..." An Siwei choked out a reply.

The old man mumbled again, lost in confusion, "Be careful... in word and deed... always protect yourself..."

"Yes..."

"Do not... think of revenge..."

No matter what the old man muttered, An Siwei tearfully answered him. An Zheyan sat there, dazed, repeating the same few phrases over and over. Finally, his gaze seemed to focus on An Siwei's face. "Oh... and have children..."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. He was about to step forward and use a divine ability to keep him coherent a little longer, but Liu Changdie cried out, "Just let him go..."

In that instant, the old man's head slumped forward.

The final words An Jingming had spoken to him no longer echoed in his mind. The door to that inner room in the An residence no longer opened in terrifying ways in his fantasies. The dimness of the hidden passage was gone. The guilt and illusions that had tormented him in his dying years finally vanished, along with his life.

But as his son watched, the old, worn-out face remained frozen in a daze rooted in profound terror.

Liu Changdie couldn't bear to look. He turned his head away, retrieved a jade box from his sleeve, and placed it beside An Siwei. He hurried out of the courtyard. He and Li Ximing walked for some time before he lowered his head and said wretchedly, "He should be sent back to Mount Yuting for burial."

---

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

A faint medicinal fragrance permeated the white mist. A golden censer swayed gently, its ivory-white corners glinting with spiritual light. The Daoist Master lightly raised his hand, and eight streams of golden-white light, linked head-to-tail, landed in his palm.

Li Ximing let out a breath, stored the censer, and strolled out of the small courtyard. He ascended the steps of the pavilion and saw Li Zhouwei, who was cultivating quietly within.

"Eight Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills!"

He revealed a smile. The eight golden-white, scale-covered pills formed a circle, floating up and down as they were nurtured by the Bright Yang divine ability in his hand.

"Uncle-Grandfather has excellent alchemy skills!" Li Zhouwei took the four pills apportioned to him, letting out a laugh.

Li Ximing mused, "I find the medicinal strength is a step weaker than those from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. It's because the Bright Yang has been declining in recent years, so the spirit ingredients aren't as potent. They only have about eighty to ninety percent of the original efficacy. Fortunately, the quantity is sufficient, so it's not a major issue."

"It is already exceptional," Li Zhouwei said. "The Golden Feather Sect said they have plenty of Profound Shell Flower-Leaves in stock. The new one that blooms each year can be given to our family. If we get eight pills every time, it's more than enough for both of us to cultivate. What normal Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could dream of such conditions?"

"Haha." That much was true. Li Ximing laughed in agreement.

Li Zhouwei then lowered his voice. "Uncle-Grandfather... Senior Tingyun has appeared!"

"What?" Li Ximing's heart jolted, a mix of joy and complex feelings filling him. Though he had been prepared for this, he couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

Li Zhouwei continued, "Daoist Master Qiuhu has already reached the lake and is currently in the Wilderness area. I received word from her. Kong Tingyun has, in fact, already been to Shanji and retrieved several Kong family members. But Fu Yuezi... he couldn't wait until today. He perished in the chaos during the time Zhu Gong was away."

"Although there's been no word since, the territory of Xuanmiao Temple is in constant flux. From the North's intentions... it seems Xuanmiao has also been placed under Kong Tingyun's jurisdiction for the time being."

Li Ximing replied, "From what Suiguan told me, it was already a done deal. This is just the dust settling. Logically, we should meet with her, no matter what. The fact that there's no news probably means she can't cross the river."

"Is there any change in Ning Wan?"

At Li Ximing's question, Li Zhouwei just shook his head silently. "No difference at all. Just a hint of helplessness in her expression... I didn't speak with her for long. But... it's only eight months until the sacrificial rites. Jiangchun has already been brought back."

"This is the work of a 'great personage', after all." Li Ximing sighed and departed from the pavilion.

Li Zhouwei sat down cross-legged. The white, scaled pill appeared in his hand, and he swallowed it. 'While matters outside are still quiet, this is the perfect time to refine my Immortal Foundation!'

Spirit pills were normally used to temper one's divine abilities. But with resources now abundant, Li Zhouwei was eager to advance. Sovereign's Perilous Tread already possessed a cultivation base, and he was aiming straight for a perfect Immortal Foundation.

Within the grotto-heaven, light and dark were indistinguishable. Auras surged. After a long period of meditation, his sea of qi began to swell. The Sovereign's Perilous Tread dharma power within it, catalyzed by the spirit pill, rose rapidly. With one great push, it surged upwards!

A dark-golden color gathered as his dharma power churned. In a daze, he perceived radiance all around him.

The Sovereign's Perilous Tread Immortal Foundation was complete!

Perhaps aided by the spirit pill, the process was startlingly easy. The moment it formed, his mind achieved perfect clarity.

'Use the Bright Yang nature to "tread peril," and thus overcome it. The five Bright Yang divine abilities are not just abilities; they each represent one of the five predicaments of Bright Yang. And Sovereign's Perilous Tread symbolizes the monarch in a humble and dangerous position, with Bright Yang seeking to correct its stance!'

And Li Zhouwei, as one favored by Bright Yang but currently possessing a low cultivation, wasn't this the very meaning of Sovereign's Perilous Tread? Naturally, his progress was rapid.

'In contrast, Audience with the Celestial Gate is the "face" and "presence" of a fully realized Bright Yang, completely unsuited for my current situation. If the family had obtained Sovereign's Perilous Tread back then instead of Audience with the Celestial Gate, my breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm would have been far faster!'

'Even cultivating it now as my second divine ability, it should be much quicker than I originally anticipated!'

This realization prompted a deeper thought.

"If not for Luoxia's suppression, if reincarnated bodies like Chu Yi and Lin Feng cultivated Sovereign's Perilous Tread... it would be equivalent to Li Qianyuan himself embracing the perilous position and breaking the danger. Wouldn't that force Bright Yang to hang suspended in the sky, directly transforming him into the monarch-father of the world? That... is a terrifying thought!"

But he had no time for further reflection. He snapped his eyes open, a golden-white light flashing through them. He looked up, a thoughtful expression on his face.

On the main seat in the pavilion, the pristine white jade vase that was used to store the Azure Talisman was trembling slightly. As if it had received a summons, plumes of white, mist-like smoke emerged from it, but they could only circle the vase, unable to break free.

'Is this... the family's sacrificial rites?'
