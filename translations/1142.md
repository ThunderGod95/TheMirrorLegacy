# Chapter 1142: Numinous Treasure

At the summit of Mount Qusi in the Southern Sea, wind and clouds churned. Flames shot skyward from a crimson dais, golden patterns swirling within the light. Beneath rows of heavy bronze lamps sat a massive furnace, and within it, suppressed flames roiled and surged, their overlapping hues shimmering with the seven colors of the rainbow.

Beside the furnace stood a Daoist Master in sky-blue robes, his face slightly pale. He had pushed his divine abilities to their absolute limit, straining to control the brilliance contained within the forge. But even with his full power, flames still licked out from the furnace from time to time, forcing him to turn his head away.

This was none other than Daoist Master Liaoluo, the master of Mount Qusi and a cultivator at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm.

And in the bronze hall above, a handsome man draped simply in a white robe leaned against the master's seat, sipping wine. His eyes swept casually over the furnace before he set down his golden cup and turned to look elsewhere.

A woman was prostrated on the floor, holding a jade talisman and awaiting his questions. But he remained silent. Instead, Daoist Master Diyan rose and produced a letter from thin air.

He gave it a gentle shake, unfolding it. A single glance was all it took for his expression to turn sharp and severe. He released his grip, letting the letter dissolve into wisps of smoke, and turned back.

His dark-gold eyes, like orbs of forged bronze, fixed upon the dancing flames in the furnace. He watched the weapon slowly taking shape within and spoke, his voice calm.

"Six full years… You've done well enough, but we did add the 'Six-Slaughter Imperial Dominion' to the mix. It's still too slow."

Those words made Daoist Master Liaoluo break out in a sweat, a flicker of guilt in his eyes. He was about to speak when the Great Daoist Master turned away, his gaze falling on a bronze sword hanging on the wall. He reached out and decisively gripped its hilt.

"Clang—"

A sliver of cold light, fluid as water, flashed out. The Great Daoist Master had already reversed the blade, resting its edge in his palm. His fingers tightened abruptly, his divine power surging. With a sound of grating metal, drops of dharma-blood, dark-gold and viscous as mercury, trickled down the hilt like a tiny stream, dripping onto the weapon in the furnace.

The sight made Daoist Master Liaoluo's face change. Kuang Yu glanced up, a hint of worry in her eyes, but Diyan’s expression was unreadable. His grip tightened further, and with a sharp crack, the sword shattered in his hand.

The stream of dark-gold blood finally ceased. The man casually tossed the sword's remains to the floor as if they were nothing, then took the jade talisman from the woman’s hands and turned to her with a smile.

"Quite a harvest, I take it."

Kuang Yu quickly answered, "I began cultivating the spell art five years ago, but my progress was slow. Only now is my qi flowing smoothly. I will select a day to enter seclusion."

Diyan’s brow lifted with a hint of pleasure. Five streams of divine power responded to his will, pouring into the furnace fire.

"The path I showed you was not mistaken," he said with a smile. "You failed several times, but this 'Severance Art of Parting Ways'—which governs the division of yin and yang and a sovereign’s mortal peril—is more than it appears. It is also a wondrous method for Holding Yang to Cross Yin, a technique of the Yin Master of the Central Palace… It is merely a pity that your cultivation level cannot overwhelm Li Ximing's. Otherwise, your gains would have been far greater."

Kuang Yu nodded but dared not interrupt him.

The vibrant colors in the furnace fire began to contract. With Diyan’s intervention, Daoist Master Liaoluo’s expression eased. He let out a breath and stepped aside, watching as the five-colored flames gradually coalesced.

"This disciple was incompetent," he said, his voice laced with shame. "To have troubled your celestial presence…"

Diyan shook his head, his five divine abilities blazing like great suns in the sky, suppressing the furnace.

"Your cultivation is in Converging Water," he said. "This task could not have been finished by you. In the end, I had to act."

"As for this blood…"

He smiled faintly.

"My divine abilities are perfected, my nature prepared for the Quest for Gold. I am like the dawn that awaits the sun, the bird that hastens the day. This blood is like a spiritual substance. Sealing it within this weapon is an ancient method of Dawn Qi, a way to perfect the Bright Yang."

"His Highness has not yet passed the Purple Mystery stage. I will be staying here to cultivate anyway. I have time to slowly recover the vital energy I've lost."

Daoist Master Liaoluo sighed to himself and said no more. Time passed as the flames surged. After eighty-one days of tempering, Diyan struck the furnace lid with his palm. A brilliant golden light shot out and landed in his hand. The two beside him looked on, but all they could see was a hazy golden glow. Daoist Master Liaoluo, mesmerized, took a step forward.

"Such a divine weapon," he murmured. "I fear even an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator, one who achieved their realm through common divine abilities, would struggle to wield it."

Diyan examined the weapon for a moment, offered a word of praise, and said no more, a nostalgic look on his face.

Kuang Yu, however, was concerned about the dharma-blood her elder had used. Seeing that Diyan seemed unaffected, she bowed and took her leave.

"This junior will now enter seclusion."

She departed in good spirits. Seeing his junior martial sister finally cross a threshold that had held her back for years, Daoist Master Liaoluo also felt a sense of relief. He stood to offer his congratulations, but Diyan, still staring at the long halberd, asked,

"Has Shitang been pacified?"

Daoist Master Liaoluo quickly clasped his hands.

"The turmoil has all been settled. That Protector-General of Jinghai, Grand General of the South Liu Bai, has some skill. Aided by the light of True Qi, even the Great Konghai Temple couldn't take him down. This junior held back Thunder-Hearing Island while the Southern Songzhou Luoshe and Nanwu both took action. In the end, it was pacified."

"It's just that Liu Bai was wounded in the process."

After listening to Liaoluo, Diyan said,

"The oceanic threat had to be quelled. The northern cultivators joined forces, using a combination of opportune moments and manipulation to set up Shanji Prefecture to vex the Yang family. But the problem still needs to be solved. They dare to target the Yang family, but they don't dare to provoke the Underworld."

He gave a cold laugh as Liaoluo lowered his head.

"After all… the last person who provoked the Underworld perished, even with an immortal scripture in hand."

Diyan was noncommittal.

"The immortal scripture was never found. Even Mount Changhuai could only vent its frustrations by torturing Jiang Boqing. What was the use of looking? It only threw fate into chaos. You say Duanmu Kui fell, and you are not wrong. But did the Underworld truly win?"

Daoist Master Liaoluo shook his head, a hint of disbelief on his face, and remained silent for a long time. Diyan changed the subject.

"What was Nanwu's reply?"

Liaoluo paused for a moment before answering.

"Back then… without us, the formation array would never have been negotiated. He understands your intentions, Your Excellency, and has been quite proactive. In this disciple’s view, Nanwu… is a clever man. He understood the meaning behind my words."

Diyan’s expression remained unchanged. The mighty Great Daoist Master, long confined to this one place, took a step forward, his demeanor calm as he instructed,

"Have him deliver the halberd at once. There must be no delay."

Daoist Master Liaoluo immediately agreed and hurried away, leaving the Great Daoist Master standing alone in the grand hall. A hint of satisfaction touched his dark-gold features. He calmly put the jade talisman away, leaned back against the master's seat, and a cryptic smile graced his lips.

---

Xuanmiao Temple.

A forest breeze gusted through the mountains, causing the red candles inside the temple to flicker, their light wavering between bright and dim. High above, the portrait of the patriarch riding a donkey remained unmoved by the wind, his face a featureless blank.

Below, a Daoist stood quietly, clad simply in a robe. He held three sticks of incense, which he offered with great respect. A man at his side spoke in a low voice.

"My lord, the master from the Numinous Treasure Order has arrived… He should be coming down from the Qi region and is on his way here now."

Qi Lanyan looked up, bowed to the portrait of the patriarch Xu Xiang, and remarked,

"Since we are at Xuanmiao Temple, it is only fitting that someone from the Numinous Treasure Order should come."

The man lowered his gaze and said softly,

"With his arrival, this southern expedition will surely bear fruit…"

Qi Lanyan fell silent for a moment, then let out a breath of impatience. He was about to speak when another disciple reported from the side,

"Lord Touba has arrived!"

The Daoist master said no more. He watched as a Daoist Master in formal black robes approached, his eyes filled with killing intent. The newcomer was about to speak, but his gaze fell upon the True Monarch’s portrait above. He had no choice but to fold his sleeves and bow silently.

But the first Daoist master spoke, a smile on his face.

"So the Touba clan has learned to pay respects to a True Monarch of my Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition?"

Touba Ci looked up, unafraid.

"The 'True Monarch of Nurturing Life and Prosperous Treasures' guards Tongxuan Palace," he said flatly. "His Dao is all-encompassing, his traditions the most diverse. Is there any reason I cannot pay him respect? You, on the other hand, drove out the master of Xuanmiao Temple and took his place like a cuckoo in a sparrow's nest. You don’t think of the Comprehending Profoundity traditions, only of meddling in the affairs of the north and south. And now you raise its banner? Who doesn't know what kind of person you, Qi Lanyan, truly are?"

Touba Ci’s words were blunt, but Qi Lanyan showed no anger. He turned to face him.

"Although Sumian obtained the Dao lineage, he lacks the sect's esoteric mantras. Even if he learned the Dharma Arts, he is nothing but a charlatan. Establishing a sect in Jiangbei was part of the plan from the beginning…"

"Besides… he is inferior to Changxi, just as Qi Qiuxin is inferior to Kong Tingyun!"

He smiled.

"Your anger is useless now. You hesitated at Baixiang Valley and then sat back and watched outside the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain. And now, haven't you ended up in the same boat as me?"

Touba Ci did not refute him. He remained silent for a long time before finally saying,

"Since you summoned me to Xuanmiao, you must have a plan."

"Attack the Song."

Qi Lanyan turned, his eyes cold. Touba Ci was not surprised.

"Eight years have passed since that great battle. Vast Cicada died without a sound. His 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' was different from the Wei tradition, a testament to his Dao-Profundity. He was favored by the Fruition Attainment, so he must have progressed even further. This time, who will you send to stop him?"

"You fear him far too much."

Despite their myriad disagreements, both men were clear-headed when it came to their fundamental interests. Qi Lanyan let the matter drop. He bowed before the True Monarch's portrait and said quietly,

"Vast Cicada's death was meticulously planned by the Yang family. Otherwise, even with Li Zhouwei's heaven-defying abilities, how could he have outmaneuvered the master of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm? The 'Dawn Qi' has become a stable springboard for disrupting yin and yang. No matter how high his Dao-Profundity, he cannot avoid this path. Have Gongsun Bei take a Spiritual Treasure, and you join forces with Shilou Yingge. Even with Li Ximing and the others present, it will be enough to make him suffer a major setback."

"Three mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators?"

Touba Ci actually laughed.

"With Tangjin lost and Baiye Creek dividing east from west, there are only two fronts: one at Baiye and one at Shanji. You're using three cultivators to deal with Li Zhouwei. You might be able to suppress him, but are you abandoning Shanji?"

Qi Lanyan smiled but did not speak. Before he could, footsteps were heard outside the gate, and another Daoist appeared.

The man was tall and thin, with a crystalline white beard. He had the noble air of a green pine under a bright moon, utterly transcendent. He wore dark crimson robes and cradled a large gourd in his arms. Made of what looked like ceramic, it stretched from his waist to above his head. His mere presence made both men turn their heads.

But his eyes were not on them. He solemnly adjusted his robes, bowed to the portrait, and began to chant respectfully. After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, he finally dared to step forward and examine the portrait closely.

Qi Lanyan said, "Martial Uncle Wang, the original portrait was taken by Sumian. This one was painted by his successors in the temple."

The Daoist addressed as Martial Uncle Wang looked regretful.

"What a pity!" he sighed.

Touba Ci studied him for a moment, his expression changing slightly.

"Daoist Master, you are…"

The Daoist master smiled.

"This old Daoist's name is Ziya. I cultivate on Mount Deshan. My ancestors were from Guzhou Prefecture. We are not as noble as the Three Kings, nor as lofty as the Viewing Pavilion. We do not contend with the twelve families and four Dao lineages for worldly power, we merely serve the Numinous Treasure."

Although Touba Ci was a descendant of the Great Liang, the mention of "Guzhou Prefecture" startled him into silence. Wang Ziya stepped aside, and Qi Lanyan said,

"Baiye… I must trouble you, Martial Uncle."

Wang Ziya smiled faintly but did not reply. Qi Lanyan paused, then turned back to Touba Ci, his brow furrowed.

"Valley Water has an advantage against Bright Yang and would have been more suitable. Unfortunately, Murong Yan is an old bastard. I can only trouble the three of you… advance south from Baixiang Valley and crush those Wei descendants on the banks of the river!"

"I will lead the others and apply pressure at Shanji. Faced with Yang Ruiyi, those other fellows will have no choice but to go all out. Once you take Baiye, the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain will be isolated. The rest will fall into place."

This time, Touba Ci did not argue. He simply nodded, then rode the wind and departed. Seeing the barbarian leave, Wang Ziya shook his head.

"I have just emerged from a grotto-heaven to earn some favor. Don't make me offend people."

Qi Lanyan nodded repeatedly and saw him out with a smile. When he returned on the wind, the great hall was empty save for the disciple still standing there. His voice turned cold.

"He's still not out of seclusion?"

His tone was like ice, startling the disciple, who fell to his knees. Knowing he was referring to Fan Kang, he hastily replied,

"There has been no movement…"

"Go and call him out."

Qi Lanyan’s gaze was sharp, making the disciple jump to his feet and rush out towards the back mountain.

In the courtyard, the moonlight was like water, and a faint formation enveloped the immortal's cave. The disciple knocked urgently on the door, channeling his spiritual sense, and called out in a low voice, "My lord!"

Inside the dark cave, a Daoist in a white robe was sleeping fitfully on a couch. Hearing the faint sound, his pale, delicate face twisted in a grimace. He ground his teeth as if caught in a nightmare, then rolled over and fell to the floor.

"Ah!"

As if his soul had fled him, the Daoist scrambled to his feet and spat a mouthful of crimson blood onto the ground, which sizzled and corroded pits into the stone. He stood up dazedly, the chaotic sounds in his ears leaving him stunned and disoriented.

'This…'

He looked down at his own clean hands, his heart sinking into a dark pit of terror. The image of a gleaming halberd materialized before him, growing rapidly, making his legs tremble and leaving him speechless.

'The second life…'

A single halberd strike.

In his first life, he had managed to hold out until Wei Prefecture. But in his second life, his status and position were immeasurably higher… yet he, Fan Kang, had died a violent death when the central plains fell. That King Wei had hunted him down to Xuanmiao Temple, pursued him all the way to the Qi region, and, in front of the whole world, had smashed him to pieces with a single blow from his halberd!

Qi Lanyan, Yin Baiyue… they had all hidden in the Great Void, not daring to lift a finger to help!

Even now, awake, his mind was a stunned blank, followed by a thick wave of fear.

'It's changed… it's all changed… To fall so early, it means… I know nothing of what comes after…'

The calls from outside grew more urgent. He scrambled up from the floor in a panic, hastily wiped away the bloodstains, and stumbled out, his mind a blinding flash of white light.

'I must… I must escape him!'

He was completely awake now. Even if Jianghuai was lost, Qi Lanyan would not be in mortal danger, but he, Fan Kang, was different! If this ship couldn't protect him, it didn't matter how long it stayed afloat. If Fan Kang didn't save himself, death was certain!

At that moment, he could not think of gratitude or distinguish friend from foe. As long as that halberd did not strike him, he could ignore everything else!

'The Buddhist cultivators… perhaps… only the Buddhist cultivators!'

But Fan Kang knew it would not be easy.

He was currently Qi Lanyan's disciple. And who was Qi Lanyan? A direct disciple of the Viewing Pavilion, a man of esteemed status. Even if he were willing to join the Buddhists, no ordinary Maha would dare to accept him!

Not to mention the greater powers, even if Qi Lanyan didn't act, Wei Xuanyin would certainly step in to clean up the sect!

He made his way to the main hall in a state of terror, his expression now composed, his excuse prepared. He lifted his foot to enter, only to see a pair of eyes staring at him from within the hall's gloom.

"What happened?"

Fan Kang's face went white. He lowered his gaze.

"There was a problem with my cultivation. It injured my life-mandate…"

Qi Lanyan chuckled twice, his voice turning cold.

"Injured your life-mandate?"

Fear gripped Fan Kang's heart.

"Master… I…"

But the Daoist master raised a hand to silence him.

"Are you truly so afraid of me?" he asked quietly.

The light in the hall was dim, only the dark red candlelight flickered, casting shifting shadows across the Daoist Master’s face. Fan Kang trembled. But the man before him did not press the matter, instead asking in a low voice,

"Who did I send to attack Baiye?"

Fan Kang, kneeling on the floor, wracked his brain but could come up with no response.

"It was… It was Murong Yan and Shilou Yingge…" he stammered.

A smile immediately bloomed on that focused face. Qi Lanyan’s joy deepened. He turned and began to pace slowly around the hall, his thoughts becoming clearer.

'He truly can't divine it… The one who came down from the grotto-heaven on the lord's orders… the Heavenly Element of both north and south cannot calculate his presence… Since this Martial Uncle is willing to leave his mountain to help me…'

His gaze burned as he cast a subtle glance at the patriarch's portrait. The smile on his face deepened.

'This means that the matter with Vast Cicada had an effect. At least one True Monarch is displeased with Bright Yang losing control. They don't want Vast Cicada's fall and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm's withdrawal to allow Li Zhouwei to break through Jianghuai too early, to step into the central plains and throw the game board into chaos…'

'Regardless of who was behind Vast Cicada's death, it broke the rules. A little tit for tat… is not so shameful…'

The Daoist master's smile was inscrutable, but to the disciple kneeling on the floor, it was growing more terrifying.

'This didn't happen in my past life… He has a backup plan… He has aid from beyond the Heavenly Element…'

This plunged him deeper into despair. Because he had been killed so early by that King Wei, his knowledge of the future was already incomplete. Now, with this change, wasn't it like pouring oil on the fire?

Whether Qi Lanyan could gain an advantage was of no concern to him. He could only recall the days his master had spent in the Great Void, seething with anger but saying nothing. Fan Kang remained on the floor, unable to rise, a single thought consuming him.

'I must find a way out now! I cannot just sit here and wait for death. Even if Wei Xuanyin strikes me down… at least there's a chance for a wisp of my True Spirit to escape. That's better than being shattered by a halberd!'

---

Moongaze Lake.

The rain over the lake grew heavier, threatening a downpour. It pattered onto the undulating surface. In the center, a man stroked a green gourd, a worried look on his face.

"I must ask you to wait a moment, Daoist Master…"

Li Jiangzong stood respectfully by his side. Sima Yuanli nodded. He was about to ask another question when his expression suddenly turned serious. The sky lit up with color, the rain clouds dispersed, and a tall man in a black robe with gold trim descended from the air.

'His divine ability and Dao-Profundity… have grown again!'

Those terrifying golden eyes burned, carrying a hint of Radiant Fire. As they fell upon him, Sima Yuanli's heart skipped a beat.

'King Wei is here…'

Five years had passed in the blink of an eye, a rare period of extended peace. Li Jiangqian had naturally remained hidden in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, while Li Zhouwei had been in seclusion in the island, refining his Dharma Arts and studying Daoist texts.

And the text in question was the Scroll of Accomplishment and Fulfillment, brought back by Li Ximing.

When Li Ximing had gone to Qusi, he heard that the Yin family, to which Diyan belonged as King Zhaoming, once possessed a Radiant Golden Convergence Method, an immortal scripture on the art of seeking the Dao. Li Ximing suspected that the Sima family's Scroll of Accomplishment and Fulfillment, held by King Shouyi of the Situ family, might be this very secret.

But he couldn't discern its true nature. When the scroll fell into Li Zhouwei's hands, he managed to uncover some of its secrets.

'While it's not a method for seeking the Dao, it's still a fine treasure.'

The text recorded the visualization techniques of the Wei Emperor's conquests, likely intended for Bright Yang cultivators to use during breakthroughs. It probably also contained many secret methods. According to Li Zhouwei's observations, the original scroll must have had profound diagrams to accompany it; only by combining the two could one truly understand its mysteries.

'Few of the Wei Emperor's Dao lineages remain in the world. If I could obtain the original scroll from the Feng family, the benefits would be immense!'

After studying it intensely for half a year, he put it away, spending no more time on it. He emerged from seclusion not only because Sima Yuanli had requested an audience, but also because the eight years Li Suining had spoken of had passed.

He had just finished studying the Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method, and a fire still lingered in his chest. His gaze swept over Daoist Master Qinghu, noting his weak aura and desolate expression.

"The Daoist Master has been busy with imperial affairs," he said. "You've grown thin. How have things been lately?"

The green-robed Daoist Master was silent for a moment.

Sima Yuanli had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm long ago. The Upright Wood lineage he held was not as demanding of Dao-Profundity as Purple Qi, nor as complex as Xiukui. He even had detailed annotations from his predecessors. He had gained much from his studies and, with the luxurious supply of pills and spiritual items left by Daoist Master Yuanxiu, his refinement speed was extremely fast.

Yet, to this day, he had only one divine ability.

He dared not compare himself to Li Zhouwei, but he didn't think he was worse than Li Ximing. Yet, no matter how he cultivated, he couldn't elevate his immortal foundation. His most recent failure a few days ago had left him dejected. He simply cupped his hands.

"Reporting to King Wei, both Zhao and Shu have started border conflicts… Furthermore, it is said that Shilou Yingge and Touba Ci have traveled south alone and entered Xuanmiao Temple. Fortunately, the North's several probing attacks have all bypassed Profound Peak Gate… As for Western Shu, they have been fighting back and forth in Tongmo Prefecture, but have not disturbed Ting Province…"

The words seemed plain, but their weight was significant. Li Zhouwei frowned. 

"Traveled south alone?"

Sima Yuanli nodded, his expression complex.

"They should be under Qi Lanyan's command now. Things are different from how they were…"

Li Zhouwei knew what Shilou Yingge was capable of. Their battle in the grotto-heaven had been spectacular. If not for the interference of those two northern cultivators, escaping would not have been easy. Although his own divine abilities had greatly improved since then, if the enemy wanted to deal with him, they would surely send more than just Shilou Yingge.

"There was also a rather large-scale battle these past few years. General Liu was defending Shitang… against the Kongtong Sea… Several Purple Mansion cultivators considered whether to disturb King Wei, but fortunately, with the assistance of a few others… they managed to hold on."

Clearly, in the eight years since the conflict at Baixiang Valley, only Ting Province had been peaceful. The Song court was still going all out to pacify the Southern Sea and eliminate future troubles.

"The reason for disturbing King Wei this time is on the Grand General's orders."

He raised his eyebrows.

"Now that the nation's power is growing and the southeast is settled, Shanji Prefecture… the Grand General does not wish to wait any longer."

The words were decisive, but Li Zhouwei was not optimistic. He shook his head.

"Difficult."

The situation in both the north and south was clear. This single word hit right at Daoist Master Qinghu’s hesitation. He sighed and fell into thoughtful silence.

The Great Song's strength had grown considerably since its founding, one could even call it a leap forward. But the pressure from the northern cultivators and Buddhists was no small matter. There were four named mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators, all either immortal descendants or of imperial lineage.

And what worried Li Zhouwei the most was Qi Lanyan himself.

Qi Lanyan's schemes were not particularly brilliant, but he was ultimately a great cultivator from Comprehending Profoundity. Both his techniques and the treasures he wielded were first-class.

'Especially the treasures in his possession, they have some notable origins. Against him, Yang Ruiyi's advantage will be greatly diminished. The old method of suppressing people with Exiled Qi will likely be ineffective…'

'And besides that, Western Shu is watching like a tiger from the side.'

He only mentioned this one point and said no more. Just then, a streak of condensed, illusory color shot through the air and bowed before him. 

"Greetings, King Wei! Congratulations, King Wei!"

"Daoist friend Nanwu."

With Shitang pacified, Guo Nanwu, who had contributed to the Great Song's effort, had clearly profited. His spirits were high. He smiled and returned the bow.

"King Wei! The weapon is finished!"

At these words, a rare look of joy appeared in Li Zhouwei's eyes.

"Oh?"

Guo Nanwu took a halo of light, like a Golden Core, from his sleeve. It shone brightly in his hand. Before he could speak, the weapon saw Li Zhouwei and flew towards him like a young swallow returning to its nest. It landed in his hand, extending and transforming to reveal its true form.

The weapon was twelve feet and eight inches long, its shaft adorned with scales and intricate patterns, and it felt as heavy as a mountain. The tail was like a spear tip, and the crescent-shaped blade had two edges, as large as a small table. Held in the Daoist Master’s hands, it looked like a magnificent ritual object.

As he turned it, the patterns on the halberd flickered in and out of view, their undulating lines reflecting shimmering light onto his face, illuminating it.

Guo Nanwu said with a smile,

"This is the Halberd of the Second Manifestation, the White-Forged Rekindled King, named Grand Ascension!"

Sima Yuanli's eyes burned with envy. Even King Wei himself looked on with a fiery gaze.

"A fine treasure," he said.

The king's halberd was as heavy as a mountain, yet it seemed light in his hands. He gripped it with four fingers, resting the shaft against his elbow, and with a sudden flick—

"Hwoosh—"

A torrent of Radiant Fire surged forth, causing the heavenly light on both sides to ripple and scatter across the rain-battered lake, creating a field of shattered gold. The lake water began to churn violently. The man laughed.

"Rise!"

The halberd shot upright and struck the empty air with a heavy thud. In an instant, the wind and rain vanished, the lake became calm, its surface as smooth as a mirror, reflecting only the blazing Radiant Fire and brilliant light.

The joy in Li Zhouwei's eyes had yet to fade. The reforged Grand Ascension was a pleasant surprise indeed.

The weapon was wondrous, comparable to a Spiritual Treasure. What was even rarer was its ancient aura, a sense of vibrant perfection. It pulsed gently in his palm, conveying a feeling of intimacy.

The Halberd of the Second Manifestation, the White-Forged Rekindled King had three wonders.

The first was 'Bright King', its innate nature, a transformation of the old 'Luminous Grasp'. As long as the halberd's master wielded it, they would be blessed by heavenly light. Each time they suppressed an enemy's weapon, they would gain one ray of light. Eighty-one rays would form the Bright King's Dharma Light, and the halberd would shine with infinite splendor.

The second was 'First Strike', a transformation of the old 'Attachment'. Li Zhouwei had used it for many years, and it was his most common technique. As his enemies grew stronger, the halberd's shadow clone could often only serve as a distraction. But now, with the 'Bright King' blessing, the shadow clone would be even faster than the main body.

This thought made Li Zhouwei's heart stir.

The improvement seemed minor, but the enhancement it brought was exponential. It meant that when a northern cultivator engaged him in close combat, their full-powered strike with a spiritual artifact would only hit the 'First Strike' clone, while the Grand Ascension itself would cut through the air, coordinating with his 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' to strike the opponent's true body.

'Murong Yan and the others might manage, but if I encounter someone who specializes in spell arts, they will surely suffer a great loss!'

These two wonders were not even the most fearsome. The weapon now also possessed a third, 'Binding Light', which held the power to command and imprison. This was an ability derived from the 'World's Radiance'. Though attached to the halberd and dissipating after a single strike, requiring time to charge, its power was undeniably domineering. Combined with 'First Strike', it was a fatal combination. Furthermore, the stronger the wielder's Bright Yang divine abilities, the stronger this wonder would become.

Although the Halberd of the Second Manifestation, the White-Forged Rekindled King did not have many wonders, each one was terrifying, and they complemented each other perfectly. After years of nurturing, it had undergone Foundation Establishment and entered the Purple Mansion Realm alongside him. It was connected to Li Zhouwei's heart and mind, a testament to Daoist Master Diyan's extraordinary skill.

'Compared to this, the Primal Summit on my person is much inferior! Even accounting for Bright Yang's preference for halberds, the difference in the two smiths' skills is clear!'

What was even more remarkable was that Li Zhouwei could faintly sense a trace of dawn light harmony within it, something that should be impossible in the current age. It was like a gentle light flowing over the weapon, subtly absorbing radiance.

'In this era where ancient Bright Yang Spiritual Treasures are rare… the value of this halberd is absolutely terrifying. Even if I searched the entire North… I would never find another weapon so perfectly suited for me!'

'To reach this level, it wasn't just his skill, but also the preciousness of the spiritual materials. The gains from Vast Cicada were substantial, but likely not enough… Diyan must have supplemented it himself.'

Li Zhouwei's eye was sharp. He saw it at a glance. His golden eyes swept softly over the halberd in his hand as he sighed inwardly.

'The Sinking Savage Aged Gold that my grand-uncle sent over… probably wasn't even enough to cover his costs…'

With a thought, the formidable weapon in his hand dissipated like light, transforming into a round, Golden Core-like point of light that hovered in his palm. Li Zhouwei closed his hand around it and stored it away in his Juque Palace.

Only then did he look up and say with praise,

"I've troubled you, Nanwu."

Guo Nanwu bowed and smiled.

"As soon as this item was born, I brought it to King Wei. There is also a Valley Water treasure that Senior Zhaojing asked Daoist Master Liaoluo to refine. He has been busy reforging King Wei's weapon lately and has not yet begun. It will take some more time."

"No matter."

Li Zhouwei nodded and watched him depart. Sima Yuanli, having waited for some time, was growing restless, wanting to speak but hesitating. Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow.

"Please."

The two of them rose on the wind and flew towards the Wilderness. Sima Yuanli found a moment to speak, his voice filled with worry.

"It's… a private matter…"

The man in the black robe stood in the Great Void, slowly turning to the side. He listened as Sima Yuanli hesitated.

"A few years ago… that Chi Buzi appeared in the Western Sea."

When it came to Chi Buzi, Sima Yuanli felt both resentment and fear. He spat out the three words through gritted teeth. The King Wei before him seemed interested.

"And?"

"To seize the Fenglin bloodline from the Way of Joyful Bliss at Horizon's End of Contemplation, Chi Buzi fought a great battle with the eighth-generation Maha, Jinlian. The fight shook the Weak Water into the sky and alarmed all cultivators. In the end, it came to nothing…"

There was a hint of regret in Sima Yuanli's tone.

"Even Jinlian could do nothing to him… In that case, the Way of Joyful Bliss will have to back down. After all, Chi Buzi can stand guard at Fenglin Isle every day… but Jinlian cannot. You can't guard against a thief for a thousand days. And as it happens, this Jinlian has some karmic ties to Fenglin Isle. In the end, he will likely have to swallow this bitter pill."

"That Chi Buzi… unless he is ninety-nine percent certain, he will not act."

Li Zhouwei's expression was unreadable. He nodded.

"Fenglin Isle? What is the connection?"

Sima Yuanli clasped his hands, gathering his thoughts.

"Fenglin Isle is where the Weak Water resides. This Jinlian… was also a cultivator from Fenglin Isle. During the late Qi dynasty, the floods were severe. Emperor Wu of Liang killed the master of Fenglin Isle, who was said to be an ancient Auxiliary Position holder of the Mansion Water… After Emperor Wu slew Dongfang Tianye, he had repeated disagreements with Dragon Monarch Beijia. As a result, the Liang dynasty rose with floods and fell with floods…"

'Mansion Water… seeking a mansion through the waters…'

He pondered for a moment and understood instantly.

'No wonder. The method for seeking gold through the Mansion Water is likely in the hands of the Immortal Mansion.'

As for this Jinlian, Li Zhouwei held no great fondness for him. Even though the monks of the Lotus Temple had always been polite, the Li family's distrust of Buddhist cultivators was etched into their very bones. Hearing that Chi Buzi had gained the upper hand was, to him, good news.

He remained silent for a long time. Sima Yuanli, however, looked up and stopped in the dark, grand hall.

"Please!" he said formally.

Li Zhouwei strode into the hall and saw Yang Ruiyi standing on a high platform in the gloom. The man's face lit up with a smile as he descended.

"King Wei has arrived!"

Years had passed, but Yang Ruiyi had not changed a bit. His robes were a somber dark color, tinged with a bit more of the Underworld's gloom compared to Li Zhouwei's black and gold attire. He held a golden scroll, and his brow was furrowed with worry.

"With King Wei's arrival, my heart is much more at ease!"

After a brief pleasantry, Li Zhouwei got straight to the point.

"What are the arrangements for the battle?"

Yang Ruiyi didn't waste time either.

"It is said that the North is mobilizing frequently. There will be a major battle soon. If Qi Lanyan is to make a move, his main force will surely head for Baiye. Protector-General Liu has already returned. I intend for him to defend Baijiang Creek, while you and I go to Shanji!"

Li Zhouwei could tell that the Grand General was not focused on defense. He frowned.

"The Buddhist cultivators will not give up Tangdao Mountain. One of us four must guard it. Now, with Situ Huo and I at Baiye, and you at Shanji, it's impossible for Cheng Qian and his disciple to hold Tangdao Mountain. With Shilou Yingge and Touba Ci there as well, trying to conquer Shanji will be a real struggle!"

Tangdao and Baiye were west and east, one in front, one behind, like two slanted barriers with Baijiang Creek as the buffer zone. Li Zhouwei's consistent advice had been to defend the two barriers and fight the northern cultivators in the Baijiang area. In retreat, they could be blocked by Ting Province; on the advance, they could cut off the retreat route at Baixiang.

But Yang Ruiyi's meaning was to let Tangdao go, to fight for the uncertain gains of Shanji… Li Zhouwei could not agree.

Yang Ruiyi was silent for a moment, then replied as expected,

"I understand the situation… The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain does not have to be defended at all costs."

Li Zhouwei frowned, feeling this was too aggressive. He looked up at him and noticed the same anxiety in Yang Ruiyi's eyes. The general began to pace.

"This is the eighteenth year of Martial Cultivation. Eighteen years! The Great Song has been established for eighteen years, yet we haven't even recovered Shanji, which is right on our doorstep!"

He gritted his teeth.

"The Great Konghai Temple in the Southern Sea has long coveted Shitang. Now that it's pacified, the matter of the North must be dealt with immediately."

Although he sounded agitated, Li Zhouwei sensed something else in his tone. He sighed inwardly.

'This is not his wish. It must be pressure from above…'

But if things went south in the North, Ting Province would bear the brunt. Li Zhouwei was silent for a moment.

"Even so, we must not be hasty. Tangdao, Baijiang, and Baiye are mutually dependent, especially the two mountains. If we lose one, the other will not hold, and we risk losing all the territory on the other side…"

"I understand."

There was a shadow in Yang Ruiyi's eyes.

"There must be a change in the North's strength. We cannot be careless. Let's test them first. You…"

Before he could finish, both men looked up sharply, their expressions changing simultaneously.

The northern sky was already thick with dark clouds. Surging divine abilities suddenly appeared, weaving through the churning clouds. The greyish-white clouds descended abruptly, revealing a massive and terrifying golden body.

Yang Ruiyi's face contorted with rage. He took a step forward and roared,

"How dare you!"

His voice boomed like thunder, shaking the heavens. Li Zhouwei's gaze turned cold. He was already in the sky, watching the northern clouds roil as countless streams of illusory color flew from the north, trailing ten thousand streaks of light.

The entire sky was stained a myriad of colors by the escape lights and divine abilities, a dazzling display of profound light.

The northern cultivators had made their move.

The situation seemed to have taken Yang Ruiyi by surprise. While he was still considering a probing attack, Qi Lanyan had already bared his fangs, his intentions laid bare for all to see.

Gazing at the colorful streams rolling in from the north, Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes.

'We're at a greater disadvantage.'

In a conflict between two sides, seizing the initiative was often key. The brilliance from the north shore was so intense, heading straight for Baiye. How could Yang Ruiyi sit back and watch?

Yang Ruiyi's expression grew taut. He closed his eyes for a moment as if communicating with someone, then turned to the King Wei beside him, his voice urgent and grave.

"I must ask King Wei to rush to Baiye. I will go to Shanji immediately!"

The golden-eyed young man nodded calmly. His eyes, full of concern, were fixed on the north, but he was secretly sizing up the Grand General before him, his thoughts uncertain. He then stepped into the Great Void and vanished.
