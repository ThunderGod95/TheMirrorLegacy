# Chapter 762: Curse Fire

Li Ximing cultivated within the earth veins for some time, managing to temporarily grind away nearly half of the black flames within his Juque Palace. His bright Bright Yang Purple Flame had once again regained the upper hand, but he was forced to stop.

The reason was simple: as he steadily forced the fire out of his Juque Palace, the invisible and deep-black flames covering his body grew increasingly intense. They had already melted layer after layer of the surrounding cavern walls and were spreading into the earth veins. If he continued, this earth vein would transform into a fire vein, and a volcano would soon erupt on the island.

'No matter how stable this region is, it can’t simply endure a Purple Mansion-level flame burning indefinitely... When the time comes, it won’t just attract other cultivators to investigate; I’m afraid it will also cook all ten thousand or so people on the island alive'.

Li Ximing stopped. Fortunately, his current cultivation was worlds apart from what it had been. Furthermore, having just walked the line between life and death, his understanding of both Bright Yang and the Great Void seemed to have deepened significantly.

He immediately took out the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger and activated its divine ability. The entire earth vein rumbled and began to shift, moving several inches to the left. He then flicked a finger, and with a chiming sound, a jet of cold water erupted from the wall.

*Tsssss!*

He had linked the earth vein to the water vein. Surging groundwater poured into the chamber, and the surrounding water vein instantly released countless clouds of steam. The baleful qi in the earth vein sank immediately, but the dense curse fire still filled the space, instantly vaporizing the water as it entered.

'This ground-water is naturally nothing against a Purple Mansion’s arts, but its advantage is that it flows without end. It can prevent the fire-balefulness from accumulating, affecting the surface, or causing anomalies on the island that might attract unwanted attention'.

Sure enough, the steam generated by the water vein immediately rushed up through the gaps in the earth-baleful qi toward the surface. The rest of the groundwater refilled the area but could not get close to the flames, leaving only a chamber of roiling black fire and endless steam rushing upward.

'Now, what rises to the surface isn't fire balefulness. The qi will condense back into water, at most forming a large spirit spring. This kind of tectonic change is common. The traces are almost non-existent, and it won't harm the people on the island'.

An operation that would have been impossible during his Foundation Establishment realm was now accomplished with a mere flip of his hand. He used the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger to slightly reinforce the earth vein, then sat cross-legged again. Pinching his fingers to calculate the time, he realized several months had already passed.

"The family hasn't crushed the emergency jade pendant, so nothing too urgent must have happened".

"Furthermore, I am overseas and not injured to the point of death; I still retain a significant portion of my strength. The family should be safe. Even if Changxiao has it out for me, he likely won't trouble my family...".

"Second, this entire affair was handled through Purple Smoke Gate. If I had been struck dead by Changxiao instantly, Tinglan and Sumian could have pretended nothing happened and stayed out of it. But since I didn't die, they have both lost face in this matter. They will have to protect my family, at least somewhat".

"Only Zhouwei... he is the one in danger now. It’s a good thing he was already in seclusion, cultivating within the lake. I just don't know how he is".

"This *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art*... it’s becoming harder and harder to deal with".

Li Ximing had been afflicted by the curse for a long time now. Although he had forced most of the fire out of his Juque Palace, the flames on the surface of his body were now roasting him so fiercely that his skin flowed with a glassy, glazed light, growing more fragile by the moment.

'[Valley Wind Guides Fire] isn't wondrous enough to seize another person's flame and make it my own; it can only control my own flames or ownerless fire. Otherwise, I wouldn't be suffering like this...'.

Li Ximing remained troubled, but the profound relief of having escaped Changxiao’s grasp still allowed him a moment of grim humor.

"If I, Li Ximing, could actually seize another person’s flames for my own use, people might even believe I was the reincarnation of some Fire Virtue True Monarch...".

It wasn't just the bottleneck in expelling the flames; the curse's negative effects on his Dharma Body were becoming more pronounced. He felt a stinging pain in his forehead, and as the dual flames burned him inside and out, his divine abilities and Dharma power all felt icy cold, a sensation that was difficult to resolve. He could only suppress the flames, but the stinging forehead and the encroaching cold in his power were not so easily dismissed.

"At least *Audience with the Celestial Gate* drove most of the fire out of my Juque Palace," he mused. "That counts as a good thing".

By stabilizing his Juque Palace, his Dharma Body at least wouldn't collapse. Though the surface flames were troublesome, Li Ximing could still move and cast spells while enduring the curse.

'But in this state... it’s not suitable for traveling. And I’m afraid I’ll run right into Changxiao if I try to go back'.

He had luckily escaped during that storm, and Li Ximing guessed that the dragon clans might have intervened. Either by accident or through one of their pawns, someone had blocked Changxiao for him.

"Xiao Chuting is away in the Northern Sea, so it couldn't have been him. The others wouldn't be bothered. Senior Tu Longjian is in the Southern Sea... It could only have been a dragon. A pity... I still ended up using Zhouwei’s favor with the dragon clans. I've let him down".

Li Ximing understood perfectly how much that favor would have helped Li Zhouwei after his breakthrough; only after reaching the Purple Mansion realm himself did he truly appreciate the sheer power of the dragon clans. He could only sigh silently in guilt.

He tried to divert his thoughts, sitting in place for several more days to repair his Juque Palace, but the flames on his skin only burned hotter, and cracks began to spread across his Dharma Body. Anxiety finally gripped his heart.

"What a venomous art! And the Earth-Gazing Bloodstone is back in the family treasury... But even if I had it in my hands, it would likely be just a drop in the ocean against an injury of this magnitude".

If he wanted to preserve his Dharma Body, he would have to suppress the external flames, which meant giving up the ground he had taken in his Juque Palace. The past several months of effort would be wasted. But if he didn't suppress the external flames, his Dharma Body would grow weaker and weaker until it, too, showed signs of collapse.

Li Ximing could also use spirit items to mend the damage, but the *Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art* was not Yehui’s True Fire. These Foundation Establishment-grade materials would only treat the symptoms, not the root cause. It would just be delaying the inevitable for a few years and wasting his savings.

'If I don't want to just sit here and wait for death, the only alternative is to risk going out to search for a cure. But in this state, wreathed in a massive aura of fire... whether in the Great Void or the physical world, I’m like a shining lantern. Who wouldn’t see me?'.

He pondered this for a long time before silently raising his head.

His gaze instantly pierced the layers of rock above him, observing the ten thousand savages on the island—a group even more primitive than the Mountain Yue.

Since advancing to the Purple Mansion realm, Li Ximing understood many profound mysteries. Like every cultivator who reached this realm, he intrinsically understood how to consume blood qi, just as he understood how to fabricate a new body or how to occupy a Dharma Body with his Shengyang—it was all as natural as eating or drinking.

And that wasn't even mentioning that he was an alchemist.

If he just had the inclination, with his alchemy skills, he could easily refine a suitable pill to solve his current problem. With such a pill to suppress the curse, combined with his divine ability, he could drive the fire out completely without any risk or significant cost.

Li Ximing stared grimly at the surface for a long moment. His ear twitched. Finally, he closed his eyes. He retrieved a stone box from his sleeve and flicked it open, revealing a clear, bright spirit water inside.

He drank two mouthfuls before entering deep seclusion to continue the suppression.
