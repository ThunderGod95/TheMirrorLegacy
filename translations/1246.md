# Chapter 1246: The Supreme Secret

As Li Jiangqian’s golden eyes turned to him, Li Suining immediately lowered his head. While both possessed the golden eyes of a qilin, King Wei’s were reserved, whereas this Daoist Master Changli often made one feel as if they had thorns at their back, sending a chill down their spine.

In his previous life, he had considerable contact with Li Jiangqian. To put it mildly, His Highness was utterly ruthless. Interacting with him often required careful deliberation, and every counter-question he posed would leave Li Suining speechless and silent.

'He's formidable. He can turn any situation around, and even in the direst of circumstances, he can retreat unscathed… But he is precisely too formidable.'

By the end of his previous life, Li Suining had even begun to feel a pang of regret.

'I shouldn't have told him so much!'

The few Purple Mansion Realm masters in the family were all figures of unparalleled genius. As the grand situation developed to its final stages, considering all the various points of suspicion, it was absolutely impossible that they wouldn't figure things out!

Li Que'wan, Li Zhouwei, and even Li Xuanxuan, who lived for several extra decades in the second life, all had their own suspicions. How could this Daoist Master Changli, famed for his cunning and ruthlessness, not have his own theories?

'In the second life, he must have become suspicious, and even made his own judgments.'

This wasn't difficult to deduce. When Yao Guanyi came to Moongaze Lake, Daoist Master Suyun had no choice but to accept the battle, but she had sent a message in advance, asking this Daoist Master Changli to return. In the end, he failed to appear. Li Suining could believe that he had been obstructed, but… given that Li Jiangqian had fully mastered the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and his Great Radiance of White Brilliance had reached major completion, there were very few people who could have stopped him on his way south from the north!

'Although his return would have been useless… still… I should say a few words less…'

Li Suining was already feeling emotional. Furthermore, in this third life, he had come into contact with Li Jiangqian earlier due to the grand formation. As a result, His Highness saw through him in just a few exchanges, which secretly horrified him. He quickly bowed in salute.

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

"There is no need for such ceremony."

Li Jiangqian nodded at him. His spiritual sense swept over the purple jade slip, and in but an instant, a look of immense joy appeared in his stunned pupils.

"This… this is…"

Li Zhouwei waved his hand, signaling him not to ask any further.

"Keep it safe. Wait for Que'wan to come out of seclusion and give it to her."

Of course, Li Jiangqian knew how precious these things were. For other Purple Mansion Realm masters, a few decades might not be worth much, but for the two juniors who were racing against time, it was truly more valuable than a Spiritual Treasure!

Father and son sat down. Li Jiangqian immediately took the jade pot and filled three cups, but Li Suining did not dare to accept one and remained standing to the side.

Li Jiangqian did not hesitate. He immediately looked up and said with a serious expression:

"Father has rarely come out of seclusion. There is a matter concerning my path on the Dao that I must ask you about!"

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei glanced indifferently at Li Suining, who was standing aside, and shook his head with a smile.

"Speak!"

"Yes!"

Li Jiangqian replied respectfully.

"My divine ability is on the verge of completion. There are many Radiant Fire divine abilities, but I do not know which one to pursue next… If it is a Life Divine Ability, it should be between 'Position Arising from Entanglement' and 'Concordant Conquest'!"

He presented the several cultivation arts he had compiled. Li Zhouwei simply took them into his hands and raised an eyebrow.

"It is merely the difference between an Auxiliary and an Intercalary Position."

Li Jiangqian couldn't help but exclaim in admiration, nodding repeatedly, while Li Suining, standing to the side, felt his heart stir.

'This "Position Arising from Entanglement"… Daoist Master Changli never cultivated it in the second life… Even when he became a Great Daoist Master in the end, he left this path uncultivated, as a space for his own plans regarding Intercalary and Auxiliary Positions…'

Evidently, with Li Jiangqian's personality, he would have made plans for everything early on, starting from his very first divine ability. Listening, Li Suining hesitated for a moment before speaking in a low voice:

"The 'Radiant Fire' Dao is known for its brilliant and extreme prosperity that illuminates the world. Its position is suspected to be occupied, but it remains unclear to this day. After all, with water and fire being so rampant, it is truly difficult to observe. As for seeking a Fruition Attainment or an Auxiliary Position… they do not actually interfere with each other. A primary position favors an auxiliary one, so even if the Fruition Attainment is unoccupied, the Auxiliary Position will still be prominent."

As soon as these words were spoken, a moment of silence fell in the hall. Father and son exchanged a glance, both seeing the contemplation in the other's eyes. Li Suining waited quietly for a few breaths before continuing:

"As the saying goes: 'A primary position knows no intercalary; a collection position knows no auxiliary.' The primary position embodies the Five Virtues: Reflecting Metal, Still Earth, Radiant Fire, Pit Water and Upright Wood. The collection is the accumulation of the Five Virtues: Harmonizing Metal, Returning Earth, Merging Fire, Converging Water, and Gathering Wood. Si Boxiu died in an Intercalary Position, and Dongfang You perished in an Auxiliary Position. It all comes down to these eight words!"

He recited this passage verbatim, words spoken to him personally by Li Que'wan back then. But now, spoken prematurely in this great hall, they struck like a clap of thunder, shaking both father and son.

Li Zhouwei's golden pupils stared fixedly at him. He murmured the words once before saying softly:

"These eight words are worth more than a thousand pieces of gold, the downfall of countless heroes!"

Li Jiangqian's gaze was even more fixed, staring intently at the surface of the table as if lost in deep thought.

'It is said that a true teaching can be conveyed in a single sentence, while false teachings fill ten thousand books. How accurate! For thousands of years, how many heroes have been suppressed by the great Daoist Traditions with just these few maxims!'

This was the clearest dividing line. Be it the Golden Oneness or the Dragon-kin, they could generously give away Spiritual Treasures, they could freely offer scriptures and Daoist Traditions, and they could even support the Quest for Gold!

But such words would never pass their lips!

'Only when the greater situation absolutely demands it will they point out a path for lower-level cultivators, speaking only of Intercalary and Auxiliary Positions, but never explaining why one is intercalary and why one is auxiliary!'

"Because this is their true legacy—Spiritual Treasures, divine abilities, golden books, Dao inheritances, these are all superficial… Once in the hands of lesser cultivators, they will naturally circulate back over the years. Only these things! They will not reveal a single bit to the outside world!"

'Even my Li Clan can only hear such things with the secret support of the great figures within our own family!'

If even Li Zhouwei was deeply shaken, how much more so for Li Jiangqian, a cultivator of a primary position? His gaze was focused, his voice trembling slightly as he spoke in a low tone:

"In that case, divine abilities also have their distinctions. Position Arising from Entanglement is the key to seeking an Auxiliary Position, as was Si Boxiu's The Path Dedicated… He lost because of this divine ability!"

In that instant, Li Jiangqian's first reaction was one of relief that his family had the High Firmament Pavilion.

Was Si Boxiu's Dao-Profundity low? Not at all. Throughout history, anyone who could pursue the Quest for Gold was definitely above ordinary in Daoist wisdom. Li Jiangqian even suspected that the Great Daoist Master must have had some inkling in the end.

But it was of little use. Even for clan cultivators with noble and ancient legacies, the dao legacies they possessed were few and far between. Even his own dao lineage had to be supplemented in Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, let alone others. Often, once a divine ability was cultivated to this point, they would move on to the next, cultivating while searching. It was considered good fortune just to find a legacy, so how could they possibly choose the order? Let alone compare the differences!

Li Suining understood their feelings but did not stop, speaking in a low voice:

"There are actually two more lines, which are 'A contained position does not reject; a changing position does not reside'."

These eight words undoubtedly dropped like another storm in the great hall. Li Zhouwei's eyes shone brightly as he said softly:

"So that's how it is…"

His Dao-Profundity was already high, and he had studied the vast number of arts in the High Firmament Pavilion, giving him a deep understanding of the Five Virtues. He whispered:

"The contained positions of nurturing and storage… the two Daos of True Fire and Mansion Water are the most reowned. Those are the Five Virtues of Wandering Metal, Wu Earth, True Fire, Mansion Water, and Protecting Wood. As for changing positions, they are naturally headed by Geng Metal, with Geng Metal, Proclaimation Earth, Blazing Fire, Pristine Water, Renewing Wood!"

'A contained position does not reject; a changing position does not reside… Interesting…'

Li Jiangqian raised his head, momentarily speechless with emotion.

'This is a top-tier Dao inheritance! Just eight words!'

These sixteen words, in total, might not increase his chances of succeeding in the Quest for Gold by much, but at the very least, they could help him seek fortune and avoid disaster, and that was enough!

King Wei's gaze solidified, staring straight at him as he asked:

"Primary, Collection, Containment, Change… what is the fifth path?"

Li Suining said with a solemn expression:

"The 'Storage' of generation, reception, accumulation, and storing."

'That's right, the 'Storage' where Valley Water and Vault Metal reside… The great divine ability of Harmonising and Vault Lock also stems from the entanglement of these two paths!'

Li Zhouwei was silent for a long time, his eyes growing brighter as he murmured:

"Also five."

"Precisely!"

A hint of excitement entered Li Suining's tone.

"She… they said… this is called the 'Five Manifestations', also known as the 'Five Daos'. Like longitude and latitude, they are interwoven with the Five Virtues, forming the Dao and its virtue. One horizontal, one vertical, like a chessboard, like heaven and earth, they correspond with each other and are inseparable!"

His words were like a clap of thunder, parting the fog in their minds. Li Zhouwei's breathing changed. He slowly closed his eyes and stood with his hands behind his back, standing there in a daze, carefully sensing. Li Jiangqian beside him was also silent. Li Suining's words were enough to leave two Purple Mansion Realm masters stunned on the spot, instinctively sorting through their own Dao-Profundity.

Only four words remained in the minds of the father and son.

'So that's how it is!'

The two of them stood there contemplating, rapidly organizing the vast library of scriptures and experiences in their minds. It was as if they had grasped the guiding principle; the more they thought, the clearer it became, and the deeper they sank into contemplation, oblivious to the changing light and shadows around them, completely unshaken.

Li Suining dared not disturb them and waited quietly from the side. Day after day passed in this manner, and nearly half a month went by before King Wei finally let out a long breath.

"The Five Manifestations… if heard by a person of insight, it is enough to serve as the foundation for attaining the Dao!"

Beside him, Li Jiangqian's expression gradually grew solemn as he murmured:

"A primary position favors auxiliary and dislikes intercalary. From this perspective, my pursuit of 'Radiant Fire' is indeed a clear path!"

Li Suining nodded gently, but a thought grumbled in his heart:

'If King Wei attains the Dao, with your status as the eldest son, the path of Bright Yang would also be boundlessly bright! Disliking intercalary… doesn't mean it's completely impossible. You're the son of the Bright Yang Imperial Monarch, and the Bright Yang Radiant Fire is so compatible…'

Li Jiangqian pondered for a long time. Seeing that the young man before him had fallen silent, he finally let out a long sigh and said softly:

"Such a supreme secret of the Dao. I am deeply indebted for the lesson!"

With this, the path of Li Jiangqian's future had taken shape in his mind, and he appeared very satisfied, his face wreathed in smiles. Li Zhouwei's Dao was not among the Five Virtues, so his thoughts were more focused on the overall situation. He said faintly:

"In that case, Dongfang You's fall, which initiated the descent of water and the rise of thunder, was actually part of the Dragon-kin's plan. And back then, the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition's shift from Geng to Dui (Reflecting) also took advantage of this change…"

What did this mean?

Li Zhouwei's eyes shone brightly:

"As long as we can explain the actions of these people back then, we can predict their future movements—this is what's most important!"

"Since 'a changing position does not reside', is Pristine Water a changing position? It's simple to deduce that Chi Buzi is considering an Intercalary Position. Taking it a step further, that Lord of Pristine Water, is he also plotting something?!"

His thoughts moved with extreme speed, drawing one inference after another, stunning even Li Suining. Li Zhouwei's expression grew solemn.

"But these speculations are not for the moment… Looking at the current situation… there is one person who has become an imminent matter…"

"Daoist Master Xiao…"

Li Jiangqian nodded in agreement, his voice grave:

"Golden Oneness said he would surely fail. This is likely one of the reasons. Kan is a primary position, so he can only seek an Auxiliary Position…"

He said seriously:

"Since this matter has been brought up, I also have a report to make."

He continued without a pause:

"Something has happened in the Northern Sea… Daoist Master Xiao has come out of seclusion and personally visited the great Immortal Sect of the Northern Sea, the North Ring Sect, to converse with its master, the Great Daoist Master Zhensu, at sea… It is said that… the conversation was not pleasant, causing the celestial phenomena to change several times… In the end, Zhensu left in a huff."

Li Zhouwei frowned, and his son immediately added:

"First there were the changes in the celestial phenomena, then the news came from Xiukui and Purple Smoke. They seem to have some connection with the North Ring Sect. Besides, this matter has caused quite a stir in the Northern Sea… This Great Daoist Master Zhensu is a great cultivator who presides over the Northern Sea, a Great Daoist Master of long-standing fame."

"Everyone speculates that Daoist Master Xiao is now at least a Great Daoist Master!"

Li Zhouwei turned his gaze, understanding why he had specifically brought this up. After a slight pause, Li Jiangqian immediately said:

"The words of Golden Oneness are still ringing in our ears. Even if it's just for show… we should send a message."

Li Zhouwei tilted his head and said:

"Suining, do you know about the Lingyu legacy?"

'How could I not know!'

Li Suining's mouth tasted bitter upon hearing this. This matter could be described as the turning point in the relationship between Golden Oneness and the Li Clan. After this major event concluded, the Golden Feather Upper Sect's attitude toward Moongaze Lake cooled by a degree. He could only lower his head and say:

"I am naturally aware… In that contest… there were no winners."

A peculiar expression flickered across Li Jiangqian's face as he listened to Li Suining continue:

"Although this junior does not know the detailed circumstances… Daoist Master Su… fell under heavy protection. Golden Oneness had no choice but to retreat, and the several clans that participated in the struggle gained almost no benefits…"

"Daoist Master Xiao…"

He mentioned this name, and the gazes of both Li Zhouwei and Li Jiangqian fell on Li Suining's face almost simultaneously. The young man said faintly:

"Although he gained some benefits, it was not complete. It was divided among several parties, and so he perished while seeking the Dao, his body transforming into Pit Water, filling the heavens and the earth…"

It was uncertain whether Xiao Chuting would have succeeded even if he had obtained the complete Lingyu legacy, but the parts that were taken were a clear deficiency. His own King Wei had lamented at the time:

'Qi Lanyan gathered the northern forces and repeatedly caused trouble, and he also had the support of the Compassion Dao. If I had passed the Purple Mystery, I would not have been hindered by such insignificant characters! Allowing Daoist Master Xiao to be disturbed.'

After all, Situ Huo was absent, Yang Ruiyi was in seclusion, and Qi Lanyan led his men south—he was no Qing Jifang, and he possessed at least some skill. This, in turn, deprived the less severely injured Li Zhouwei of time for seclusion, preventing him from breaking through to the Great Daoist Master realm and delaying him for many more years…

'He failed, as expected…'

Kan and Li were close. Although it was not unexpected, a complex look still flickered in Li Jiangqian's eyes. He glanced at his father and said in a low voice:

"Even so…"

"Even so, we still have to help."

Li Zhouwei stood with his hands behind his back, his expression unchanged. He turned his head, his eyes shining with a golden brilliance:

"You said… he was not complete. The Lingyu legacy was divided?"

"So it is said…"

Li Suining was slightly taken aback but nodded. He watched as King Wei's expression slowly became intrigued.

"How long until the Lingyu legacy opens?"

Li Suining replied:

"By my calculations… perhaps twenty years… but this matter is being pushed by multiple parties, so I fear there may be changes."

The light in Li Zhouwei's eyes grew even more vivid as he spoke in a low voice:

"One last question."

He said, word by word:

"Will Daoist Master Xiao—come to the lake?"

Li Suining raised his head and was about to speak after a nod, but he was stopped by Li Zhouwei. He paced a few steps in the great hall and said faintly:

"I understand."

He stood quietly for a moment.

"I have gained much here. I will not disturb you further, Jiangqian!"

Li Jiangqian immediately understood, stood up, and followed his father into the Great Void. Their next step landed them in the dim inner formation. He, too, was lost in endless thought, remaining silent for a long time. He saw his father turn his head and suddenly say:

"You have gathered enough, haven't you."

"Nothing can be hidden from Father."

Li Jiangqian's expression remained unchanged as he took out a jade bottle from his sleeve and said seriously:

"This is Conquest's Blazing Qi, obtained from the sites where Radiant Fire cultivators fell. There are many such places in the world. Hengzhu's reefs and the southern mountain ranges are all suitable for gathering. It is the spiritual qi for 'Concordant Conquest'. I sent three people over, and they have already gathered enough."

"Good."

Li Zhouwei's expression was grave as he said in a low voice:

"What to cultivate and how to cultivate it is for you to decide. Within ten years, there will be a great battle. Your sister's divine ability is one of nurturing, so there is no need to worry. But if you have an immortal foundation on you, you must be careful, lest your cultivation be washed away."

It was rare for his father to speak to him with such a solemn expression. Li Jiangqian understood the seriousness of the matter and nodded heavily:

"I understand!"

He stepped on flames and drifted away in a hurry. Li Zhouwei, on the other hand, walked slowly and sat alone in the dark hall. With his palm facing up, a speck of radiance slowly appeared, pulsating with the perfected aura of an emperor.

'Imperial Observation of the Origin.'

What was different from before was that his Dao-Profundity was now purer, more radiant, as if it had undergone some form of integration, becoming even more unfathomable. Even this immortal foundation seemed more complete!

The gains from his earlier closed-eyed contemplation were no less than those from a great battle on the Jianghuai.

Li Suining's words had been enlightening. If his ever-rising Bright Yang Dao-Profundity had been too extreme and disorganized before, then these Daoist words, which transcended yin and yang to focus on the five elements, had consolidated all his scattered understandings outside of Bright Yang, making it more complete and flawless. The help this gave him was simply immeasurable!

He even had a faint premonition:

"With these words, my chances of stepping past the Purple Mystery in one go with this immortal foundation have even exceeded sixty percent!"

But there was little joy in Li Zhouwei's eyes, only surging contemplation as he murmured:

"So that's how it is. The so-called secret method of seeking change was not necessarily meant for us to see… This is right… this is right!"

'If that's the case, all plans must be overturned.'

His confidence was growing, and he could certainly step past the Purple Mystery and launch a northern expedition. But that was far from enough!

'Before, I had no choice, but this time, the breakthrough is not to resist a northern attack, but to take the initiative to advance north. I would become the one who has traveled from afar. How could the north just sit and watch? I could certainly achieve considerable results… but it would only add to Martial Cultivation's glory. What about the real benefits? How much would there be?'

The gain or loss of a few cities, spiritual items, or spiritual resources was not enough to determine the direction of any major situation. But the opportunity to break through to the Great Daoist Master realm first, this precious information and time advantage, once lost, would never return!

The key to the grand situation now lay with the Lingyu legacy, not the gain or loss of a single city!

"The Xiao Clan must be helped."

He, Li Zhouwei, would not give up any opportunity. The so-called threats and inducements from Golden Oneness, or the face of the Dragon-kin, would not change because he supported the Xiao Clan. What these people valued were the benefits for the greater situation. Those who would help him would not offer less because of this. If they didn't lend a hand in the end, it would only be because the benefits were not great enough, never because of something like this!

In fact, the more Golden Oneness threatened and induced, the more benefits they offered to persuade the Li family to convince the Xiao Clan to back down, and the more painful the price they ultimately paid, the more it proved the high probability of Xiao Chuting's success in attaining the Dao and the profound means of the great figure behind him!

'What's more, with Golden Oneness's methods, even cooperation can be made to look like persecution. Feinting to the east while attacking the west, using advance as a retreat—are they not capable of such things?'

Li Suining had not revealed much information, but it was enough for him to sort out the changes in the grand situation for the coming years. A plan instantly formed in Li Zhouwei's mind.

'First, I must elevate this immortal foundation, send it into the Shengyang Acupoint to shatter it, increasing the probability of success next time. With a second immortal foundation and various other aids, I would even have a ninety percent chance of succeeding in one go.'

'In this way, when I break through to the Great Daoist Master realm is entirely within my control.'

He stood up, his expression grave.

'The Chunyi Dao Gate said that the Lingyu legacy is in Huan Prefecture, which is still north of Luoxia. If I cannot conquer Luoxia, then supporting the Xiao family will require crossing the territory of the Great Zhao. Almost only I alone can go, and I won't even be able to support him with my full strength.'

'And the north is without a leader. Luoxia is at its most vulnerable right now. Qing Jifang is heavily injured, and Western Shu has no time to look east! Golden Oneness is at its closest with my family, and my prestige in the Great Song has reached its peak. I have already seized the perfect timing, favorable terrain, and popular support. These ten years are a heaven-sent opportunity!'

"As long as I am certain of my breakthrough to the Great Daoist Master realm, I can first obtain the support of the Song Emperor. With the body of a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, I can launch a surprise attack on Luoxia, catching them off guard and conquering it. I will drag the Song Emperor onto this warship and have the Daoist Masters of the Great Song secure Luoxia. Only then can my family fully support Daoist Master Xiao, and only then will people like Cheng Qian and Kuang Hong have a chance to intervene."

"As long as the timing is chosen cleverly enough, by then, the Great Song will have stabilized Luoxia and prevented a northern counterattack. I will receive the feedback of Talisman Qi. I just need a moment to catch my breath and break through, then I can descend upon Huan Prefecture as a Great Daoist Master with four Bright Yang divine abilities, fully supporting Daoist Master Xiao in seizing the Lingyu legacy and attaining the Golden Core Dao!"

"Once this major event is completed, Luoxia will no longer be important. If we can hold it, we hold it. It doesn't matter if we have to give it up!"

His expression was cold and solemn. Of course, Li Zhouwei knew that even with the complete Lingyu legacy, Xiao Chuting's chances of attaining the Dao were still pitifully small, and he also knew there would be trouble if he succeeded. But that was not his concern:

'Even if he fails, failure will have its uses!'

'But only a change at the Golden Core level is worthy of the great momentum of my becoming a Great Daoist Master. Whether Daoist Master Xiao succeeds or not is another matter. By stirring up the winds and clouds and intervening forcefully, the grandeur of Bright Yang will be made manifest!'
