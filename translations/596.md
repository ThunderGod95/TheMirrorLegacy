# Chapter 932: Penglai

Li Ximing entered the treasure vault alongside the red-robed disciples of Hengzhu Dao Gate. Chen Xuanyu walked ahead with him, while Li Qinghong quietly followed a step behind, somewhat lost in thought.

Though Hengzhu Dao Gate was considered orthodox, Li Qinghong dared not fully trust it. Still, whatever she needed to exchange, she could only go to Hengzhu Dao Gate and no other. There was no other reason; her family’s spirit item taken from Wang Fu belonged to the Ancient Merging Dao lineage and had already been revealed before the Hengzhu Dao Gate cultivators, who practiced the same Dao. There was no hiding it now. With Bi Yuzhuang’s desire plainly written on her face, Li Qinghong had no choice but to go along with the flow.

But when she thought more deeply, suspicion crept in, Could the Ancient Merging Dao spirit item Wang Fu brought out be part of Hengzhu Dao Gate’s plan? This journey was far too easy. Why did the Profound Peak Gate urge my family to make this trip? Surely, their motives lie elsewhere.

After this journey, Li Qinghong felt as though she had been led by the nose. Deep down, she already understood that what her family wanted and possessed had long been laid bare before all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

My family is not like the Xiao Family. We have no Xiao Xianyou laying a foundation for three hundred years, nor the scheming of Xiao Chuting. Ximing has cultivated Purple Mansion Realm secret techniques, but can the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators see it? If they can... hiding it is pointless.

Now, only one thought filled her heart, Whether my family can break through to the Purple Mansion Realm depends on whether the various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators will allow a cultivator surnamed Li among them. Even if it was allowed, it would be just a trial, the chance of success may still be pitifully low.

Even as she remained deep in thought, Li Ximing had already come to a stop up ahead.

A red-robed Daoist retrieved a small crimson-yellow flag from the spirit shield. It was embroidered with a red sparrow and had five rays of red light drawn around it. He introduced it, "This item was acquired by our Hengzhu Dao Gate from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven. It is called the Yang Li Red Sparrow Banner and possesses abilities to spew spiritual flames, dispel spell arts, vibrate with separation light, and impact spiritual sense.

"This treasure comes from a grotto heaven, so its materials are naturally excellent. Unfortunately, it was forged during the later years of the Dongli Sect and is not of ancient make. It's a few notches inferior in comparison."

When he saw that Li Ximing looked tempted, he reminded, "This dharma artifact’s flames are ferocious. It is best suited for cultivators of the Li Fire Dao. If your cultivation method clashes with it, you likely won’t be able to use it. Even if it is unrelated, the dharma artifact may burn the wielder... If the method isn’t of Li Fire, it’s best to at least be of Fire Virtue."

Chen Xuanyu glanced at it carefully, then softly said, "The Bright Yang Dao seizes light and captures flame. Its fire arts are just below the Five Fires. This piece would serve well in hand."

Though Chen Xuanyu had not seen Li Ximing act much earlier, he had already witnessed the power of the Radiant Origin Pass and now spoke kindly, "Ximing’s cultivation method excels at suppression. Li Fire can be used to refine items. Its incinerating power is just below True Flame, but it's more enduring and burns fiercer with time. It suits Ximing’s Immortal Foundation quite well."

Li Ximing nodded, set the item down, and continued browsing the vault. The three dharma artifacts from Wang Fu were all extraordinary. Naturally, Hengzhu Dao Gate would not bring out standard-issue dharma artifacts.

However, there was only one of the Bright Yang Dao among those currently displayed. This dharma artifact was a flask used to suppress enemies, and clearly too similar in effect to Li Ximing’s Immortal Foundation. There was also a powerful sword of the Cold Essence Dao, but since Li Xijun already had Han Lin, taking it would be redundant.

After careful consideration, Li Ximing still decided to take the Yang Li Red Sparrow Banner. Though it was a Li Fire dharma artifact, it came from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven of the Bright Yang Dao Lineage, and was thus suitable for Bright Yang practitioners as well.

Li Ximing turned to look at Li Qinghong. After she nodded, Chen Xuanyu took out a treasure pagoda and stored the artifact. He showed no joy, likely because his own arsenal was already complete. This item was probably destined as a reward for others.

The three of them took their dharma artifacts and went together to bid farewell to Bi Yuzhuang. The red-robed woman seemed to have received some news, and came forward with some hesitation, looking only at Chen Xuanyu as she softly said, "Fellow Daoist, please take this White Wan with you and help escort Qinghong and the other back to the Li Family. I leave the spirit veil in your care for now; someone from our Dao Gate will retrieve it later."

She revealed a swathe of white silk in her hand. It was clearly the concealment dharma artifact used earlier when ambushing Wang Fu. Chen Xuanyu did not ask further. He simply took the silk, bade her farewell, and departed with the two.

The red pavilion was suddenly quiet. Bi Yuzhuang sat down by the table, finally showing a trace of guilt. She let her head sink into her hands, unease creeping into her heart, Qinghong must think I sent Xijun away on purpose... harmed him... I was clearly helping her. How did it come to this?

She had a good impression of Li Qinghong. She had just praised Li Xijun, yet now found herself blamed for his death. Her heart was a tangled mess. When the red-robed Daoist stepped forward to report which dharma artifacts the two families had taken, she couldn't be bothered to listen and simply waved him away.

True, trading with an early Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator for a Purple Mansion Realm spirit item is an unbelievably good deal, but such things can’t be measured like that...

Bi Yuzhuang paced the room twice. That silver-white box still sat on the table. She gazed at it for a moment and silently thought, Let me hold onto it for her... If something happens in the future, this gives the elder a reason to lend a hand.

Penglai.

Penglai was said to be an immortal mountain above the Eastern Sea, appearing and disappearing at will. Most of the Three Sects and Seven Gates regarded it as a grotto heaven. Very few had ever set foot inside, and the cultivators within were scarce. There were only a scattered few dozen silhouettes across the vast white expanse.

The sky here was snow-white, with neither sun nor moon, yet quietly infused with radiant light. Mountain ranges undulated beneath the sea, which was itself white. Small islands dotted the water between the two vast white expanses.

Spirit fish swam within the sea, and reefs and spirit trees of all colors adorned the sea with vivid contrast. Two cultivators in ancient Daoist robes, their hair bound in ceremonial crowns, walked upon the water, chatting merrily.

A young man in white stood before them, hands clasped behind his back, curiously observing the scenery. Yet the two Penglai cultivators seemed not to notice him, walking straight toward him without hesitation.

The youth in white did not move aside; his form seemed illusory. The two Penglai cultivators passed straight through him as though he weren't there. He remained where he stood, gazing out at the sea as he sighed, "So this is Penglai..."

Lu Jiangxian had long been curious about this place. Strictly speaking, he had not truly entered it. He was watching a reflection within the mirror, a scene projected by the Immortal Mirror’s core, which, through talisman seeds planted in the great void, was channeling images back through the jade box that held Li Xijun’s soul.

Having been trapped inside the mirror for over a hundred years, Lu Jiangxian had endured immense psychological torment. Even watching these illusory visions returned from afar, he still conjured a physical form to walk through them—if only for a sliver of solace.

Though Li Xijun’s soul had left his body, the talisman seeds remained linked to him.

The people of the Li Family often believed that talisman seeds resided in the Qi Sea acupoint, for ever since they started cultivating, the small white seed could be sensed resting at the base of the Qi Sea. It was quite easy to recognize.

But as the one who had implanted them, Lu Jiangxian understood them more deeply. Once talisman seeds were introduced into the body, they did not just reside in the Qi Sea, but also within the Shengyang and Juque acupoints. If a Li Family member formed a divine ability, the talisman seeds could also be glimpsed within those two centers.

Rather than saying the talisman seeds were located in those three acupoints, it would be more accurate to say they could be visualized there through inner focus. That was why, though the Li Family had long feared others might detect the talisman seeds within the Qi Sea, in truth, even a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual sense probing the area would find it utterly empty.

Since Li Xijun's soul had been preserved and not dissipated, the talisman seeds naturally had not returned either. They remained linked to him, and once he obtained a new body and resumed cultivation, he would be able to see the talisman seeds within his Qi Sea once again.

Therefore, Lu Jiangxian had no concern that Li Xijun would fall into some prenatal confusion when his body was rebuilt, or that the cultivators of Penglai might uncover the secret. Even if they captured and interrogated Li Xijun’s soul, the talisman seeds would still function.

As for this round of Purple Mansion Realm contention, the gains are not insignificant. Lu Jiangxian followed the two Daoists, sorting through his thoughts, There seems to be little true resistance among the sects and factions toward the Li Family forming a Purple Mansion Realm. On the contrary, many appear willing to go along with the flow... After all, no existing Purple Mansion Realm cultivator bears a deep grudge against the Li Family. At most, it’s just the clashing of pawns, not a real conflict.

At worst, Changxiao Gate and Crimson Reef Island are somewhat unwilling, but it’s not to the extent of wanting to wipe them out...

After all, in the eyes of the Purple Mansion Realm elites, Li Ximing wasn’t particularly impressive. Giving him even a twenty percent chance was probably overstating it. In Lu Jiangxian’s opinion, more than half of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators thought the Li Family was currently just flailing. The one truly worth watching, Li Zhouwei, was still a long way off.

As Lu Jiangxian thought things over, the two Penglai cultivators ahead came to a halt. Two more figures descended from the Outer Heavens. The one in front wore the garb of a Penglai cultivator and was slightly older, with an air of immortality and Daoist grace.

He was followed by a youth wearing a Daoist crown, clad in gold-embroidered robes. His appearance was unremarkable, but a peachwood sword hung at his waist, and he had an enormous sword case strapped on his back.

It was luxurious and elegant, engraved with 128 cloud patterns. The case had sixteen sword slots that sealed sword qi within.

"Hmm?"

Lu Jiangxian trembled slightly in surprise. He actually recognized this person. It was the sword immortal Wang Xun of the Yinghua Wang Clan! This was the great-grandson of Xiaojin True Monarch of the Xiao Metal lineage, and the son of Daoist Master Yingyuan.

This youth had an impressive background. In his quest to witness the sword intents of the world, he had once visited the Li Family to observe Li Chejing’s sword intent, and had even left behind Wanglin Blossom seeds as compensation.

Now that his sword case had taken form outside his body, with all sixteen sword intents gathered, it was clear he had already cultivated a divine ability.

Though now honored as a Daoist Master, Wang Xun still retained a pure and lively spirit. His youthful charm was evident, and he was far more sociable than in the past. Smiling, he greeted the two Penglai cultivators, "Greetings, fellow Daoists."

"We dare not! We dare not!"

The two cultivators quickly stepped aside to avoid his bow, speaking in hushed tones, "This junior pays respects to the Daoist Master!"

"Eh." The middle-aged cultivator clearly didn’t care for such formalities. He stopped the greeting, waved the others away, and led Wang Xun back with a smile. "Fellow Wang, if I’m not mistaken, this is your first time visiting our Penglai Immortal Mountain."

Wang Xun nodded. The two descended directly down onto a barren mountaintop, upon which sat a dilapidated Daoist temple. It had a well out front, with a broken wooden bucket resting on the edge. It hardly resembled a place fit for a Daoist Master.

The middle-aged Daoist seemed entirely unbothered and pushed the door open. The two sat down in a side room within the courtyard, and started sipping tea. Lu Jiangxian casually sat on the threshold, his white robe embroidered with sun and moon motifs draping loosely as he listened with folded arms.

When the middle-aged cultivator took his seat, Wang Xun recalled some of the polite phrases he had memorized. He decided to start by praising the man's Dao lineage, and with a smile, glanced at the jade shelves on either side and said without thinking, "Fellow Daoist, your Dao Collection here is truly..."

He had only spoken halfway when the words caught in his throat. The jade shelves were completely bare. Where one would expect ancient books and jade slips, there was nothing but a single turtle shell.

Wang Xun stared in a daze. His compliment was stuck mid-sentence, and his rehearsed flattery now hung awkwardly in the air. Unsure what to say next, Lu Jiangxian glanced at him and silently thought, I thought the young Sword Immortal Wang had matured. Turns out he had simply memorized it all ahead of time.

Seeing his discomfort, the middle-aged Daoist quickly spoke up, "Just so you know, Fellow Daoist, here in Penglai Immortal Realm, we never keep books or slips on shelves. Our entire Dao lineage is stored within the Kongtong Immortal Text, preserved beneath the sea. If ever needed, we access it directly with spiritual sense."

Wang Xun let out a breath of relief and responded without hesitation, "To think such a treasure exists, this Immortal Realm truly lives up to its name."

His answer made the middle-aged Daoist pause, then smile and counter, "Do you know the reason behind it?"

"I’d be glad to hear it in detail!" Wang Xun was beginning to find his rhythm and replied cleanly.

The middle-aged Daoist chuckled. "This rule has been in place since the founding of Penglai Immortal Realm. It's been countless years and was established by an Immortal Lord, so no one has dared to violate it. The reason... is actually quite a curious tale."

He stroked his beard and began to recount slowly, "It is said that many immortals resided in Penglai in ancient times. Countless immortal arts and techniques abounded. Then, one such Immortal Lord named Chufu traveled the Nine Continents and encountered another Immortal Lord in the ancient Jin State.

"The two had a disagreement over their Dao lineages, and a quarrel broke out above the Jin River. As is often the case with immortals, their words held power, and the river began to flow backward, flooding a mortal army.

"The Immortal Lords themselves were unharmed, of course. But the Jin State’s army below was forced to retreat, altering a fate that was meant to be.

"As a result, both Immortal Lords were chastised by the Heavenly Dao, with endless roaring thunder. Chufu Immortal Lord had no choice but to return to Penglai... only to discover that the other Immortal Lord had secretly followed him. With his extraordinary auditory arts, he managed to overhear and read the entire Dao Collection of the grotto heaven!"

"What?" Wang Xun was stunned for a moment, and found it hard to believe, but upon reflection, it felt oddly reasonable. He replied, "After all, the arts of Immortal Lords are beyond measure."

The middle-aged Daoist sighed softly and answered, "Chufu only realized it afterward and flew into a rage. The two fought in the Outer Heavens, causing the Golden Crow[1] to shift from its place and the stars to veer from their courses... Several Immortal Lords came to watch the battle, and it disrupted the mortal realm's formation plates, making spiritual energy shift every three days...

"Though the two eventually reconciled and became friends, and the other Immortal Lord even gifted him a stele inscribed with immortal arts that was sunk into the sea, this tradition has been passed down ever since..."

He chuckled warmly, subtly revealing the depth of his Dao lineage, then glanced at the turtle shell on the jade shelf and smiled. "As for this turtle shell... After the two Immortal Lords became friends, Chufu took to placing a turtle shell on the shelf. He said the other Immortal Lord had practiced techniques for avoiding the Three Disasters and Nine Tribulations and for achieving immortality, and thus was overly cautious. The turtle shell was a gentle jab at his nature."

1. 金乌 (Jīn Wū), literally "Golden Crow," is a mythological creature in ancient Chinese legends, often symbolizing the sun. According to myth, there were originally ten Golden Crows residing in the Fusang tree in the eastern sea, each taking turns to fly across the sky and illuminate the world. However, one day all ten rose together, scorching the earth, and the archer Hou Yi shot down nine of them, leaving only one to represent the sun. In cultivation settings, “金乌离位” (the Golden Crow leaving its position) can metaphorically suggest a cosmic disturbance or imbalance in celestial order, often used to describe powerful battles or heavenly disruptions. ☜
