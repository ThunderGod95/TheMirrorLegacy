# Chapter 874: The Secret Diffusion Spirit Sword

"That master has already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, so his influence isn't what it once was. Let Chen Yang go without worry."

Li Ximing didn't say more. That single sentence was enough to make Li Jiangqian’s expression turn serious. He bowed and said:

"This junior understands..."

Li Ximing nodded at him and said softly, "I still need to make a trip to the Southern Borderlands. Qiuhu will watch over things at home, but I am leaving matters in your hands for now. Remember one thing: do not, under any circumstances, let any direct descendant interfere."

Even knowing Li Jiangqian was cautious, Li Ximing reminded him yet again. He retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, placed it in Li Jiangqian's hand, and waved him off.

"Go immediately and retrieve these spirit objects. We also have a 'Drum-Mystery Treasure Flower' and a 'Golden Obedient Flame Fruit' in our stores. Take them all out and have Minggong deliver them here."

Li Jiangqian left at once. Soon, Li Minggong was seen arriving within the formation. She prostrated herself and said respectfully, "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing helped her up and said in a low voice, "You have worked hard these many years... You have been with the family since our humble beginnings and have always been diligent. It's just that we had nothing good in the early days, and you were held back in terms of cultivation methods. I obtained a Purple Mansion Realm spirit pill from the Eastern Sea that can purify one's Dao foundation... It is perfectly suited for you."

Hearing it was a Purple Mansion Realm spirit pill, Li Minggong was first shocked and overjoyed. But she quickly frowned, bowed again, and said softly, "I am deeply grateful for the Daoist Master's consideration... But my aptitude is dull. The path beyond this Foundation Establishment Realm is a dead end for me... I am also old. Even with a perfected Dao foundation, it would just be a waste..."

"I only hope the Daoist Master will bestow it upon Jiangqian or Que'wan... Only then would its potential be fully used."

Li Ximing shook his head and replied, "Their contributions do not match yours, so it is not appropriate for them to receive such a great pill. That is the first reason. The second is... the cultivation methods they practice are of a very high grade. If not for my being at the Purple Mansion Realm, we would not be considered an Immortal Clan and wouldn't dare reveal such things. This spirit pill's effects are extremely limited; the improvement would not be significant for them. It is, however, perfectly suited for your immortal foundation."

Li Jiangqian had already presented the jade box. Li Ximing took out another freshly copied jade slip, placed it in her hand, and instructed, "Follow the cultivation art within this jade slip to achieve the best effect. All the spiritual resources have also been prepared. As for the treasure medicines for your True Fire, the family has not only prepared them but also procured an extra one, just in case. Go and use them."

Li Minggong could only accept it with thanks, her eyes brimming with tears as she replied, "It is a pity... my brother... he would have been the most suitable one."

Li Ximing waved his hand in silence, patted Li Minggong’s shoulder, and nodded to Li Jiangqian. He then transformed into a streak of Profound Light and departed. He flickered briefly over the island, paused, and then veered towards the roof of a mansion.

The Li family's direct line had seen their quality of life improve dramatically after moving to the Island. Li Chengzhi had lived in this mansion for the latter half of his life, earning more respect as he aged. Even with all the hurried construction across the island, this residence had been one of the first completed.

Large red lanterns hung before the gates, glowing faintly. Li Ximing gathered his sleeves and then reached out to knock.

*Creeaak...*

The door opened quickly, revealing an old man holding a lantern. He had no cultivation. He peered out, his gaze somewhat vacant, and stammered, "You... you are... the Daoist Master..."

Li Ximing did not answer, but the faint pulse of Profound Light from his brow said everything. Even if the servants had never seen him face-to-face, who on the lake didn't know of his prestige, riding the heavenly glows and commanding the Profound Light?

*Clang!*

The lantern immediately smashed onto the ground, rolling several times. Pale yellow oil and flickering flames spread quickly. The steward cried out, dropped to his knees, and began to kowtow desperately, his old hands braced on the ground.

The mansion's tranquility was shattered. A woman with elegant eyes and slender brows, dressed in a crimson, white-flowered skirt, hurried down the steps. "Uncle Dou?" she called out, puzzled. "What is happening?"

Li Ximing said softly, "Shouyu."

The voice sent a chill straight up Xia Shouyu's spine. Even after all these years since returning from overseas, Xia Shouyu still felt a mixture of terror and reverence for this voice, which had altered her destiny with a single word.

'Daoist Master!'

She rushed forward to greet him, but the Daoist Master in white-gold robes passed through the front courtyard like a beam of light, appearing directly before her.

"Take me to see Chengzhi."

She immediately lowered her head, bowing submissively, and led the Daoist Master forward. They had just passed through the central hall and were heading toward a room when they saw it was brightly lit. The faint sound of sighing could be heard, and a young man in red robes was kneeling silently on the floor.

Li Ximing gently waved his hand, stopping Xia Shouyu beside him. He gazed up at the portrait of the Daoist Master hanging high in the central hall, standing silently nearby, just as he had on that late night so many years ago.

Li Chengzhi was already very weak. A mortal's lifespan was merely sixty or seventy years; only those who reached Embyronic Breathing lived to one hundred and twenty. They had invited Sun Bai to see him, and with the help of a few cultivators, his condition was currently stable.

"The Daoist Master... The Daoist Master soars high in the heavens. What is it you are begging for? The Old Master has spoken to me several times... You must cultivate diligently. Reach the Foundation Establishment Realm first... That is more effective than any words. You are the direct grandson of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator... If you achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm, you will immediately be among the highest echelon..."

Li Chengzhi coughed twice. Li Zhouming’s voice, however, was firm, lacking the grievance it held back on Mount Qingdu.

"The Old Master thinks only of my well-being, but I know my own limitations. My hopes of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm are slim. If the Old Master hadn't constantly given me resources, I would be stagnating in the late stages of Qi Refining like my eldest brother... And Father only has so much time left. If I go into secluded cultivation again, I won't even be able to see him in his final moments. I might even force Father to see me off. There is no reason for 'Ming'er' to go into seclusion..."

"You... You just don't have the temperament for cultivation..."

Li Ximing lowered his gaze and finally pushed the door open. The room was thrown into chaos. Li Zhouming was first terrified, then overjoyed. The old man on the sickbed struggled to sit up and pay respects.

Li Ximing gently flicked his sleeve, sending both Li Zhouming and Xia Shouyu out of the room. He sat down in a nearby seat and seemed to let out a breath, looking at Li Chengzhi on the bed. His eldest son stared at him blankly.

"Father."

Li Ximing sat properly to the side. The two remained silent for a long time before the Daoist Master spoke in a low voice, "A long time ago... I used to think that if I had a son, it would be best if he was skilled in artifact refining. If not artifact refining, then the path of formations would also be fine... These are very important for the family."

"Later, you were born a mortal. I could only wish you a life of peace."

Li Chengzhi was very surprised by his arrival, so surprised he had nothing to say. He stared blankly at the Profound Light on his father's brow. After a long while, he finally said, "Thank you, Daoist Master."

"With a child like Zhouming, your son can die without regret."

The light in the room flickered. Father and son, brought together by the grandson's wishful thinking, sat like strangers. There were no sobs, no sighs of emotion. The Daoist Master waited for a quarter of an hour, then pushed the door open and left.

The central hall was pitch-black and gloomy. The opening of the door faced the portrait in the hall directly. Li Zhouming was kneeling in front of the room, this profligate's forehead pressed to the ground, waiting in silence.

Li Ximing stood quietly on the steps. His gaze, however, passed over the couple and settled on the hall's interior. The portrait of the Daoist Master was stirring faintly in the breeze. The small point of Profound Light, painted with gold lacquer, seemed to glow dimly in the darkness.

The Daoist Master in the painting was high above, his eyes indifferent, as if he had never changed. It suddenly struck Daoist Master Zhaojing with a sense of familiarity—a familiarity that silenced him.

An unknown amount of time passed. Li Zhouming waited and waited. Finally, his peripheral vision caught the corner of a white robe sweeping past him, and a command drifted to his ears:

"Go and cultivate in peace."

Li Zhouming raised his head. The Daoist Master had already departed as a streak of light. The profligate kowtowed three more times before scrambling to his feet and rushing inside. He looked toward the bed; his father was lying with his head tilted to the side, seemingly asleep.

Outside, the sound of rapid footsteps and the clash of weapons erupted, a noisy clamor. A voice shouted, "By order of the Family Head! The great formation is being adjusted today. The four direct lines, major and minor branches alike, are all to remain in their courtyards! No one is to take half a step outside!"

...

The Great River.

Night had fallen. The river surged, exceptionally beautiful under the clear moonlight. The air was slightly cold. From Jiangbei, several streaks of light flew over, landing one by one on the riverbank.

The leader was an imposing figure, dressed in white and red armor with a pale red cape billowing behind him. A sword hung at his waist, giving him an air of dominance and charisma.

This person was, naturally, Lin Feng.

But unlike the time of the great battle on the riverbank, his equipment was completely new. His cape shimmered with light. He had clearly reaped another great harvest and upgraded his gear. His original dharma sword was gone, replaced by the one at his waist—a long, elegant blade that glowed a brilliant, fiery red.

He was flanked by a woman on each side. A step behind them stood two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators as escorts: one, an old man in gray robes, the other, a young man in black robes. Neither appeared to have a high cultivation.

"This is far enough."

The man gave the order. The white-robed woman beside him looked aggrieved and whispered, "What kind of stunning beauty is she, that you must personally cross the river to receive her..."

This woman was none other than Song Yunbai of the Capital immortals Dao. Despite being a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, she only dared to complain tactfully to this man. Who would have thought that a charming girl in a blue skirt would step out from the side and snap, "Brother Lin is going to pick up my sister! What does that have to do with you?! You're nothing but a pretty mouth... you sure know how to use it!"

This charming girl was, of course, Fei Qingfei. She was merely a mortal, yet she dared to curse at a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. It was an extremely awkward situation. Song Yunbai could only lower her head in grievance, playing the part of the submissive.

"Alright, alright."

Lin Feng waved his hand. Song Yunbai departed reluctantly. Fei Qingfei was still complaining, muttering, "Honestly... one after another. We finally got rid of that Wang Xiaoxiao, and now there's this woman named Song. There are so many women in this world, and they all covet my family's man."

Lin Feng chuckled, paying little mind to her complaints. He gave an order, "Wu Gui, you have been to this Moongaze Immortal Clan before. You will lead the way... to the Fei family on the north shore."

"Yes!"

The four of them sped along, quickly reaching the Hanyun area. Wu Gui had only been to the island before and wasn't very familiar with the north shore. As they slowed down, an old man happened to be riding the wind nearby. Seeing the four of them, he called out joyfully, "Young master Feng!"

"Uncle Cai!"

The newcomer was none other than Fei Tongcai, the man who had escorted Fei Qingya back to the lake that day. He looked much more prosperous now, and his cultivation had improved considerably. He laughed, "I've been cultivating downstream, searching for a spirit material these past few days. I decided to travel upstream in my spare time. What a coincidence! Tsk... you've already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm! You're here to pick up Qingya, aren't you!"

Lin Feng nodded. Fei Qingfei leaned in affectionately. Fei Tongcai didn't even bother to announce them, leading the group straight up the peak. Fortunately, the patrolling cultivators had already been instructed and bribed, so they let them pass.

With Fei Tongcai leading the way, they soon landed on a peak. A commotion was coming from a courtyard where a woman with a cold, aloof temperament was standing. Across from her, another woman in Fei family robes was sneering, "My, how lofty we've become. How come your cultivation hasn't increased? People said you only got onto this peak through connections, but you refused to believe it. If the Family Head hadn't broken through, how could a minor figure from Jiangbei like you return to the peak to cultivate? Instead of being grateful, you claim your lover is here to take you away."

Someone nearby immediately tugged at her, whispering, "Stop talking..."

"Why can't I say it? She eats the family's food and uses the family's resources. We finally managed to support her to the Qi Refining realm, and now she says she's leaving for the north with her lover! She can do it, but I can't talk about it?"

Fei Qingya said in a low voice, "When I get to the north, I will naturally repay every one of these things. It's none of your business."

"None of my business? This..."

Lin Feng could listen no longer. With a cold laugh, he kicked the gate open. A torrent of flames surged out, instantly suppressing all other sounds. He roared, "Slut!"

"Brother Lin!"

Fei Qingya’s eyes lit up, and she rushed into his arms. Lin Feng wrapped an arm around her and said coldly, "The great Fei family... actually has a wretched woman like you!"

He thrust his palm out, and flames raged. Lin Feng was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator; how could a mere Qi Refining practioner withstand his attack? The woman instantly spat blood and collapsed. The courtyard erupted in cries of alarm. Wu Gui broke out in a cold sweat and looked at the black-robed Daoist beside him.

'This is Moongaze Lake!'

The Fei family might be insignificant, but the Li family was behind them! You have to see who the master is before you beat the dog. Moongaze Lake was not something the rabble from Jiangbei could compare to...

Fortunately, though Lin Feng was enraged, he retained some reason. The woman had collapsed to the ground, spitting blood and in great pain, but she was not dead. Fei Qingya was also stunned. The two guardians hadn't even had time to help before a loud announcement cut through the air:

"Protector Chen has arrived~"

'This is bad. We've been caught in the act!'

Wu Gui's heart pounded, but he saw that Lin Feng had actually calmed down. He looked at the black-robed young man descending from the sky and smiled.

"Protector Chen, long time no see!"

Chen Yang laughed as he landed, his expression one of pleased surprise. "Excellent! My friend, you really reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

As his feet touched the ground, he finally noticed the woman on the floor. "This is..."

Wu Gui quickly stepped forward and sighed. "My master just arrived and happened to overhear her hurling insults. He is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, after all, and couldn't tolerate such disrespect. He merely acted to discipline her a little..."

Chen Yang shook his head. He helped the unconscious woman up, using his dharma power to protect her heart meridian, preventing the smoldering Blazing Fire from slowly extinguishing her life force. He sighed, "How could ordinary people recognize a piece of unpolished jade like Qingya! Arguments are common, but she shouldn't have directed her words at you."

Lin Feng nodded slightly, glanced at Fei Qingya, and frowned. "This... the cultivation method Qingya is practicing is..."

Clearly, in Lin Feng's eyes, the "River and Stream One Qi Art" was worse than trash; it was an eyesore. Chen Yang, however, just laughed and replied, "This is a cultivation method from my family, one I specifically sought out for Qingya. It shares the same origin as my own Foundation Establishment Realm method... If the opportunity arises, she might be able to use my method... With Qingya's talent, I fear she won't stop at the Foundation Establishment Realm..."

"Oh?"

Lin Feng glanced at Chen Yang, a faint red light flashing in his eyes. He was clearly using some kind of ocular art. He nodded thoughtfully, a hint of pleasant surprise in his voice. "If it can connect to your esteemed family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method, it would save me the trouble of searching everywhere... I could just trade your family for a copy."

Chen Yang, however, let out a long sigh and shook his head. "If we had it, that would be for the best... It's just that the method to unlock my family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivation art was lost many years ago... It is said that only a cultivator of sufficient genius, profound, fortunate destiny, and who meets the criteria of the ancestors can open it. Because of this, it has remained untouched in our hands for all these years. It is very difficult to take it out for Qingya right now..."

"I see."

Lin Feng laughed heartily and raised an eyebrow. "Then let's forget it... I won't trouble your family for the cultivation method. I have my own means."

Fei Qingya, however, shot a quick glance at Chen Yang. Her arm, held in the man's hand, tightened slightly. She said tactfully, "Since we're already here... why not bring that cultivation method out for a look? If we can unlock it, not only will it save trouble later... it would also be a fortunate event."

Lin Feng smiled, covering her hand with his own, and replied, "Since you've said so, we'll have to trouble Protector Chen to bring it out. It will be a bit of entertainment, if nothing else."

Chen Yang had thought the chance was lost. He hadn't expected that a lover's whisper was indeed the most powerful persuasion. His help toward Fei Qingya during this time had truly paid off, prompting her to speak up at this critical moment. He hurriedly sent someone to retrieve the item.

Lin Feng turned his head and said gently to Fei Qingya, "You have suffered these past few years. From now on, you'll be with me. You will lack neither cultivation resources nor dharma artifacts. If you have any request, I will go to Secret Diffusion and get it for you."

Beside them, Fei Qingfei said indignantly, "Yes... yes, sister! I can't cultivate, so I can't get any of those things from Secret Diffusion. It all just benefits those other women. You should take one or two extra items, so it's not all a freebie for them!"

As soon as these words were spoken, Fei Qingya understood immediately. She asked suspiciously, "Them?"

Fei Qingfei, overflowing with jealousy, continued, "Who else? That Song Yunbai from the Song family, and that Wang Xiaoxiao from the ridge... they're both involved with Brother Lin right now..."

Fei Qingya's expression immediately darkened. She turned her head away, sullen. Chen Yang couldn't care less about their drama; he was just waiting for the jade slip. When it arrived, he had it presented. Lin Feng, feeling extremely awkward, seized the opportunity to change the subject. He nodded and said, "Xiao Yuan, you cultivate the water virtue. Your talent is not weak, and your fortunate destiny is not shallow. It's a perfect time for you to examine this item."

The black-robed young man at his side appeared taciturn, with a rather cold and aloof aura. He nodded, stepped forward, and took the jade slip. After studying it for a moment, he replied, "It truly is flawless, like an inert object... It's just... the aura on Qingya and Senior Chen... I seem to have encountered it in the east. I believe Su Yan, from the Capital immortals Dao territory, also cultivates this path... It's called the 'Jing Dragon King'..."

Chen Yang nodded repeatedly. "Precisely."

Before Xiao Yuan could speak again, Lin Feng replied thoughtfully, "He threw the Capital immortals Dao into chaos; he can be considered a top-tier figure. If your predecessor's cultivation method truly does choose its successor, perhaps we should let him try. The only problem is that he's hard to find."

He quickly shook his head with a smile and continued, "Setting that aside, I must thank Senior Chen Yang for taking such good care of Qingya all these years. Otherwise, who knows how much she would have suffered in a place like the Fei family."

Lin Feng stylishly retrieved a long box from his storage bag. He opened it gently, revealing a pure black Foundation Establishment Realm dharma sword lying within.

The sword appeared simple, entirely pitch-black with no ornamentation. Its form was a single straight line. Though shockingly simple from hilt to tip, it possessed an extreme spirituality. It was clearly no ordinary item.

The moment the box was opened, a plume of sword qi shot skyward. Its quality was definitely not low among Foundation Establishment Realm items. It possessed a degree of spirituality, and most precious of all, it was wreathed in an aura of 'Pit Water'. It had clearly been chosen with great care.

"This is a fine sword I acquired. I obtained four of them at the time: 'Black Creek', 'Falling Cassia', 'Sea-Parting', and 'Heart-Piercing'. They correspond to 'Pit Water', 'Supreme Yin', 'Converging Water', and 'Radiant Fire', respectively. All of them came from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition!"

He seemed casual, as if these items weren't particularly valuable to him. He gestured to the red dharma sword at his own waist and smiled. "'Heart-Piercing' is the one I wear, though I plan to give it to Yunbai. 'Falling Cassia' I gave to Senior Bai Yinzi, and 'Sea-Parting' went to fellow Daoist Han Li. 'Black Creek' I specifically saved for you, Senior!"

Dharma swords were sought after by everyone, to say nothing of a spiritual treasure like 'Black Creek', which no ordinary dharma sword could compare to! Yet from his mouth, they sounded as common as cabbages by the roadside, one after another. The Li family had many sword cultivators over the generations, accumulating their collection bit by bit, yet their entire arsenal was less than what he had just listed in a single breath!

Setting aside all else, Chen Yang himself practiced the sword. Moreover, this blade was a perfect match for his immortal foundation. Faced with such a temptation, he couldn't tear his eyes away.

Fei Qingfei, however, spoiled the mood by muttering, "All the swords from that Daoist tradition look the same. There's nothing special about them..."

Fortunately, Chen Yang was desperately restraining himself, otherwise he would have started cursing in his heart. He stared at the sword, mesmerized, and sighed, "This item is far too precious. How could I let you go to such an expense... I cannot accept it."

Lin Feng laughed and shook his head, but Fei Qingfei said proudly, "This is hardly precious at all! Brother Lin has a Geng Metal sword-shaped spirit embryo that has gained spirituality. *That* is truly precious! Right now, he even has to use a special dharma artifact to seal it, to prevent it from being exposed to the Great Void and seen by some Purple Mansion Realm cultivator... or from being drawn away by some Metallic Essence and escaping..."

"Aside from that spirit embryo, everything else is mediocre... Perhaps it's good to you, Senior, but to Brother Lin... it's already obsolete!"

Fei Qingfei was a mortal and had no contact with cultivation. Her words were clearly tactless. Although spoken with pride, they still made Fei Qingya frown in discomfort. She thought to herself, 'My sister has truly been spoiled rotten by him... She blurts out everything...'

Lin Feng, however, didn't mind. He stood with his hands behind his back, looked at Fei Qingya, and comforted her in a low voice, "Don't worry... I have the true Profound Order. They won't bully a junior to seize this spirit embryo from me."

"A spirit embryo?!"

Chen Yang's face was filled with shock. Lin Feng just smiled and said modestly, "It was just good luck... Secret Diffusion is not a Daoist tradition famous for the way of the sword. Although Xiaoshi Mountain was very famous back in the day, its main assets all came from the Wanling Upper Sect. I searched the entire Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition and only found this single sword-shaped spirit embryo. There were no other, more powerful spirit swords."

"Just this one..."
